A [[Neolithic]] and a late [[Bronze Age]] settlement have been found in the Springfield suburb, and the town was occupied by the [[Roman Britain|Romans]]. A Roman fort was built in AD 60, and a civilian town grew up around it. The town was given the name of ''Caesaromagus'' (the market place of Caesar), although the reason for it being given the great honour of bearing the Imperial prefix is now unclear \u2013 possibly as a failed 'planned town' provincial capital to replace [[Londinium]] or [[Camulodunum]]. The remains of a ''[[mansio]]'', a combination post office, civic centre and hotel, lie beneath the streets of modern [[Moulsham]], and the ruins of an octagonal temple are located beneath the Odeon roundabout. The town disappeared for a while after the Romans left Britain.\n\nIn 1199, following the commissioning of a bridge over the [[River Can]] by [[Maurice (Bishop of London)|Maurice, Bishop of London]], [[William of Sainte-M\u00e8re-Eglise]] was granted a Royal Charter for Chelmsford to hold a market, marking the origin of the modern town. An under-cover market, operating Tuesday to Saturday, is still an important part of the city centre over 800 years later. The city's name is derived from ''Ceolmaer's [[Ford (crossing)|ford]]'' which was close to the site of the present High Street stone bridge. In the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, the town was called ''Celmeresfort'' and by 1189 it had changed to ''Chelmsford''. Its position on the Londinium \u2013 Camulodonum Roman road (the modern [[A12 road (England)|A12]]) ensured the early prosperity of Chelmsford.\n\nThe town became the seat of the local assize during the early 13th century (though assizes were also held at [[Brentwood, Essex|Brentwood]]) and by 1218 it was recognised as the county town of Essex, a position it has retained to the present day. Chelmsford was significantly involved in the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381, and [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] moved on to the town after quelling the rebellion in London. 'The Sleepers and The Shadows', written by Hilda Grieve in 1988 using original sources, states: \"For nearly a week, from Monday 1st July to Saturday 6th July [1381], Chelmsford became the seat of government ... The king probably lodged at his nearby manor house at Writtle. He was attended by his council, headed by the temporary Chancellor ... the new chief justice ... the royal chancery ... Their formidable task in Chelmsford was to draft, engross, date, seal and despatch by messengers riding to the farthest corners of the realm, the daily batches of commissions, mandates, letters, orders and proclamations issued by the government not only to speed the process of pacification of the kingdom, but to conduct much ordinary day-to-day business of the Crown and Government.\" Richard II famously revoked the charters which he had made in concession to the peasants on 2 July 1381, while in Chelmsford. It could be said that given this movement of government power, Chelmsford for a few days at least became the capital of England. Many of the ringleaders of the revolt were executed on the gallows at what is now Primrose Hill.\n\nAn Anglo-Saxon burial was discovered at [[Broomfield, Essex|Broomfield]] to the north of Chelmsford in the late 19th century and the finds are now in the [[British Museum]]. The road 'Saxon Way' now marks the site. In the 17th century many of the victims of [[Matthew Hopkins]] (the self-styled \"Witchfinder General\") spent their last days imprisoned in Chelmsford, before being tried at the Assizes and hanged for [[witchcraft]].\n\n[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] purchased the Boleyn estate in 1516, and built [[Palace of Beaulieu|Beaulieu Palace]] on the current site of [[New Hall School]]. This later became the residence of his then mistress, and later wife Anne. Soon after it became the residence of Henry's daughter, by his first marriage, [[Mary I of England|Mary I]].\n\nKing [[Robert I of Scotland]], better known as [[Robert the Bruce]], had close ties with the nearby village of [[Writtle]] and there is some evidence to suggest he was born at Montpeliers Farm in the village,<ref name=RB_Birth>Robert's [[absolution]] for Comyn\u2019s murder, in 1310, gives Robert as a layman of Carrick, indicating Carrick / Turnberry was either his primary residence, or place of birth. [[Lochmaben]] has a claim, as a possession of the Bruce family, but is not supported by a medieval source. The contemporary claims of Essex / the Bruce estate at [[Writtle]] Essex, during the coronation of Edward, have been discounted by [[G. W. S. Barrow]].</ref><ref name=birth2>[[Geoffrey the Baker|Geoffrey le Baker's]]: [https://archive.org/details/chronicongalfrid00bakeuoft Chronicon Galfridi le Baker de Swynebroke] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160831232310/https://archive.org/details/chronicongalfrid00bakeuoft |date=31 August 2016 }}, ed.

A recently restored monument to the dead is in the city cemetery in Writtle Road.\n\nOn 13 May 1943 Luftwaffe bombing raids hit Chelmsford leaving more than 50 people dead and making nearly 1,000 residents homeless. The bombs on this night were dropped mainly in the town centre, [[Springfield, Essex|Springfield]] and [[Moulsham]].\n\nThe [[GHQ Line]] part of the [[British hardened field defences of World War II]] runs directly through Chelmsford with many [[Pillbox (military)|pillboxes]] still in existence to the north and south of the city.\n\n[[Hylands Park]], the site of the former annual [[V festival]], and its replacement the [[RiZe festival]], then hosted a prisoner of war camp, and from 1944 was the headquarters of the [[Special Air Service]] (SAS).<ref>[http://www.chelmsford.gov.uk/history-hylands The History of Hylands] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404214844/http://www.chelmsford.gov.uk/history-hylands |date=4 April 2016 }}, Chelmsford City Council, published 24 November 2004.

The site on West Hanningfield Road was sold to [[BAE Systems]]; the Waterhouse Lane site sold to E2V and the New Street site is undergoing major redevelopment for residential/mixed use.<ref>{{cite web|title=Former Marconi site, New Street|url=http://www.chelmsford.gov.uk/marconi}}</ref> However, the city's location close to London and at the centre of Essex has helped it grow in importance as an administrative and distribution centre. The one-time largest employer in Chelmsford, RHP, the former Hoffman ball bearing manufacturing company, closed its New Street/Rectory Lane site in 1989. Some of the factory remains and has been converted into luxury apartments and a health club although most of the site was demolished to make way for the Rivermead Campus of the [[Anglia Ruskin University]].\n\nBeaulieu Park, The Village and Chancellor Park are some of the most recent large-scale housing developments built in the city to complement earlier developments, such as [[Chelmer Village]] which was built in the 1980s.\n\nIn 2007, the [[Channel 4]] programme \"[[Location, Location, Location]]\" voted Chelmsford the 8th-best place to live in the UK.<ref>[http://www.buyabetterhome.co.uk/23.html The 20 Best Places in Britain to Buy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017005014/http://www.buyabetterhome.co.uk/23.html |date=17 October 2015 }}.

E. B. Crompton|Rookes Evelyn Bell Crompton]]. Crompton as he was better known was a leading authority of electrical engineering and was a pioneer of electric street lighting and electric traction motors within the [[United Kingdom]]. Crompton installed electric street lights around the town centre to celebrate the incorporation of the Borough of Chelmsford in 1888. Although this made Chelmsford one of the earliest towns to receive electric street lighting, the Council later decided to have it removed because gas was cheaper and the Council owned the gasworks. Crompton supplied the traction motors for the first electric trains on [[Southend Pier]]. The company also manufactured electrical switchgear, alternators and generators for many [[power stations]] in the UK and worldwide.\n\nCrompton set up his original factory known as the 'Arc Works' in Queen Street in 1878.

The \u00a334.8m nine-mile (14&nbsp;km) bypass opened in November 1986. It is a very important route, linking London and the M25 motorway with the docks at Harwich and Felixstowe, and the East Coast. Despite being notorious for frequent congestion, poor road surfaces and potholes, as well as accidents, many people move to Chelmsford for it being so well connected by not only rail services, but roads. The A414 trunk road, running from Hemel Hempstead to nearby Maldon, is a main road into the city, just off the A12, and also links the city to the M11 motorway at J7 near Harlow.

Until 1986, when the Chelmsford bypass was opened, the roundabout was in an even worse state. Traffic lights were tried to improve matters in the early 2000s but that scheme was abandoned after a short while however some of the lights where recommissioned for early morning and evening part-time use in 2009. The recently built bus lane on the A1114 Great Baddow Bypass and priority to traffic using it has meant traffic queues approaching the roundabout can now be over {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}} long during peak periods. The roundabout is still called \"The Army and Navy\" even though the public house from which the junction got its name has long been demolished.\n\nThe junction was until 2019 unusual for its flyover, in a similar manner to the [[Hogarth Roundabout]] in [[Chiswick]], London.

This was completed early in 2009. Recently, plans were revealed for 'Waterside', a large development of shops, bars and restaurants on the banks of the [[River Chelmer]] on derelict land near the [[Essex Records Office]] at the end of Wharf Road. If this development goes ahead, High Bridge Road connecting Parkway and Springfield Road would be demolished along with the adjacent [[gasometers]] and a new central link road would be built.\n\nThe former [[Anglia Ruskin University]] central campus off Park Road was demolished in January/February 2010 and has been redeveloped by social housing provider Genesis as a mixed use development of housing for social rent, alongside other new housing for private sale and several retail units, new squares, streets and plazas. The new development has been given the name ' City Park West'.\n\nHigh Chelmer Shopping Centre underwent a refit during 2008/2009 with new flooring, lighting with a new front entrance and logo re-brand. Further work is being carried out in the shopping centre; an old portion was demolished in Spring 2011.  The work was completed in early 2012.\n\nIn January 2011, John Lewis announced together with development partner Aquila House Holdings that it was to anchor a brand new {{convert|119,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} department store as part of a {{convert|300000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} retail development at Bond Street.

One of the oldest and most prominent buildings in Chelmsford, it was built as a courthouse and there has been a court on the site since at least 1199.

The 1979 film special of the TV series ''[[Porridge (TV series)|Porridge]]'' was filmed largely on location at Chelmsford Prison (while it was closed for repairs after a fire).\n\n[[Hylands House]] and Park just to the west of the city is a country house and parkland, saved from dereliction and purchased by the local council in 1966 after the death of the last private owner. Much damaged by fire and vandalism by the time of the sale, the house has now been completely restored by Chelmsford City Council. The house dates from 1730, and the park, {{convert|574|acre|km2}}, was landscaped by [[Humphry Repton]]. It is open to the public and used for a wide range of community events, including the annual music festival [[V Festival]]. It is also available for weddings and other private hires including conferences etc. The 21st [[World Scout Jamboree 2007]] was held at Hylands Park from 27 July to 8 August 2007.  Within the grounds which comprise woodland, rolling grassland and lakes is a large children's play area with adjoining car parking.\n\n[[Chelmsford Museum]] in Oaklands Park, off Moulsham Street, is a local history and industrial heritage museum which also incorporates the [[Essex Regiment]] Museum. A major \u00a35&nbsp;million extension and redevelopment scheme opened in January 2010 and the museum now includes exhibits and interactive displays focusing on Crompton, Marconi, and Hoffmann, as well as illustrating the development of the town and city from prehistory up to modern times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chelmsford.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=18250 |title=Chelmsford Borough Council \u2013 New Chelmsford Museum draws in the crowds |publisher=Chelmsford.gov.uk |accessdate=17 September 2010}}</ref> A second site at Sandford Mill \u2013 Chelmsford's former waterworks \u2013 displays further exhibits from Chelmsford's telecommunications, electrical engineering and rolling bearings industries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chelmsford.gov.uk/sandfordmill |title=Chelmsford City Council \u2013 Sandford Mill |publisher=Chelmsford.gov.uk |accessdate=17 September 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Geography and climate==\n\n===Geology===\nFrom over 600,000 years ago, during the [[Pleistocene]] [[ice age]], until the [[Anglian Stage]] around 478,000 to 424,000 years ago, the early [[River Thames]] flowed through the area where Chelmsford now stands, from [[Harlow]] to [[Colchester]], before crossing what is now the [[North Sea]] to become a tributary of the [[Rhine]]. Consequently, gravel deposits are frequently found in the area and current and former [[gravel pit]]s in the district are common.\n\nChelmsford has two rivers, the [[River Can]] and the [[River Chelmer]]. Although often confused to be the same river in the city centre, they are quite separate until they join together towards the east of the city to form the [[Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation]] which heads out towards [[Maldon, Essex|Maldon]] before flowing into [[tidal]] waters at the [[Blackwater Estuary]]. In the other direction, the Chelmer comes from the north from its source near [[Thaxted]] while the Can comes from the West from [[Writtle]] where it separates from the River Wid.\n\nUp to the 1960s, these rivers were extremely prone to flooding the city centre area including two disastrous floods in August 1888 (known locally as 'The Great Flood') and in September 1958 (which also badly affected nearby [[Wickford]]) causing widespread damage. Flood prevention schemes in the 1960s on both rivers have largely prevented any further incidents here although the natural floodplains to the north and east such as The 'Baddow Meads' and The 'Chelmer Valley' continue to see flooding on a regular basis especially after prolonged heavy rainfall.\n\n===Climate===\nAs with the large majority of the UK, Chelmsford has a [[maritime climate]] (''Cfb'' in the [[Koeppen climate classification]]). Being in the southeast of England, the city enjoys a warmer climate than most of the United Kingdom; it is also one of the drier areas in the country. The nearest met office weather station is Writtle, about {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} west of the city centre.\n\nTemperatures occasionally reach {{convert|30.0|C|F}} in the summer, this figure was last achieved on 25 July 2019 when {{convert|37.7|C|F}} was recorded and on an average of 19.2 days<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/calcdetail.php?seasonid=0&periodid=1981-2010&indexid=SU&stationid=1845\n|title=1981-10 Days >25c\n|accessdate=3 December 2012}}</ref> the temperature will achieve a value of {{convert|25.1|C|F}} or above.

A [[Neolithic]] and a late [[Bronze Age]] settlement have been found in the Springfield suburb, and the town was occupied by the [[Roman Britain|Romans]]. A Roman fort was built in AD 60, and a civilian town grew up around it. The town was given the name of ''Caesaromagus'' (the market place of Caesar), although the reason for it being given the great honour of bearing the Imperial prefix is now unclear \u2013 possibly as a failed 'planned town' provincial capital to replace [[Londinium]] or [[Camulodunum]]. The remains of a ''[[mansio]]'', a combination post office, civic centre and hotel, lie beneath the streets of modern [[Moulsham]], and the ruins of an octagonal temple are located beneath the Odeon roundabout. The town disappeared for a while after the Romans left Britain.\n\nIn 1199, following the commissioning of a bridge over the [[River Can]] by [[Maurice (Bishop of London)|Maurice, Bishop of London]], [[William of Sainte-M\u00e8re-Eglise]] was granted a Royal Charter for Chelmsford to hold a market, marking the origin of the modern town. An under-cover market, operating Tuesday to Saturday, is still an important part of the city centre over 800 years later. The city's name is derived from ''Ceolmaer's [[Ford (crossing)|ford]]'' which was close to the site of the present High Street stone bridge. In the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, the town was called ''Celmeresfort'' and by 1189 it had changed to ''Chelmsford''. Its position on the Londinium \u2013 Camulodonum Roman road (the modern [[A12 road (England)|A12]]) ensured the early prosperity of Chelmsford.\n\nThe town became the seat of the local assize during the early 13th century (though assizes were also held at [[Brentwood, Essex|Brentwood]]) and by 1218 it was recognised as the county town of Essex, a position it has retained to the present day. Chelmsford was significantly involved in the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381, and [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] moved on to the town after quelling the rebellion in London. 'The Sleepers and The Shadows', written by Hilda Grieve in 1988 using original sources, states: \"For nearly a week, from Monday 1st July to Saturday 6th July [1381], Chelmsford became the seat of government ... The king probably lodged at his nearby manor house at Writtle. He was attended by his council, headed by the temporary Chancellor ... the new chief justice ... the royal chancery ... Their formidable task in Chelmsford was to draft, engross, date, seal and despatch by messengers riding to the farthest corners of the realm, the daily batches of commissions, mandates, letters, orders and proclamations issued by the government not only to speed the process of pacification of the kingdom, but to conduct much ordinary day-to-day business of the Crown and Government.\" Richard II famously revoked the charters which he had made in concession to the peasants on 2 July 1381, while in Chelmsford. It could be said that given this movement of government power, Chelmsford for a few days at least became the capital of England. Many of the ringleaders of the revolt were executed on the gallows at what is now Primrose Hill.\n\nAn Anglo-Saxon burial was discovered at [[Broomfield, Essex|Broomfield]] to the north of Chelmsford in the late 19th century and the finds are now in the [[British Museum]]. The road 'Saxon Way' now marks the site. In the 17th century many of the victims of [[Matthew Hopkins]] (the self-styled \"Witchfinder General\") spent their last days imprisoned in Chelmsford, before being tried at the Assizes and hanged for [[witchcraft]].\n\n[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] purchased the Boleyn estate in 1516, and built [[Palace of Beaulieu|Beaulieu Palace]] on the current site of [[New Hall School]]. This later became the residence of his then mistress, and later wife Anne. Soon after it became the residence of Henry's daughter, by his first marriage, [[Mary I of England|Mary I]].\n\nKing [[Robert I of Scotland]], better known as [[Robert the Bruce]], had close ties with the nearby village of [[Writtle]] and there is some evidence to suggest he was born at Montpeliers Farm in the village,<ref name=RB_Birth>Robert's [[absolution]] for Comyn\u2019s murder, in 1310, gives Robert as a layman of Carrick, indicating Carrick / Turnberry was either his primary residence, or place of birth. [[Lochmaben]] has a claim, as a possession of the Bruce family, but is not supported by a medieval source. The contemporary claims of Essex / the Bruce estate at [[Writtle]] Essex, during the coronation of Edward, have been discounted by [[G. W. S. Barrow]].</ref><ref name=birth2>[[Geoffrey the Baker|Geoffrey le Baker's]]: [https://archive.org/details/chronicongalfrid00bakeuoft Chronicon Galfridi le Baker de Swynebroke] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160831232310/https://archive.org/details/chronicongalfrid00bakeuoft |date=31 August 2016 }}, ed.

The worst ''single'' loss of life took place on Tuesday 19 December 1944, when the 367th [[Vergeltungswaffe]] 2 or [[V-2 rocket|V2]] rocket to hit England fell on a residential street (Henry Road) near the Hoffmans ball bearing factory and not far from the [[Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company]] factory in New Street, which may also have been the target (Hoffmans factory was key to the war effort, supplying bearings for countless applications, making it a key target).

A recently restored monument to the dead is in the city cemetery in Writtle Road.\n\nOn 13 May 1943 Luftwaffe bombing raids hit Chelmsford leaving more than 50 people dead and making nearly 1,000 residents homeless. The bombs on this night were dropped mainly in the town centre, [[Springfield, Essex|Springfield]] and [[Moulsham]].\n\nThe [[GHQ Line]] part of the [[British hardened field defences of World War II]] runs directly through Chelmsford with many [[Pillbox (military)|pillboxes]] still in existence to the north and south of the city.\n\n[[Hylands Park]], the site of the former annual [[V festival]], and its replacement the [[RiZe festival]], then hosted a prisoner of war camp, and from 1944 was the headquarters of the [[Special Air Service]] (SAS).<ref>[http://www.chelmsford.gov.uk/history-hylands The History of Hylands] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404214844/http://www.chelmsford.gov.uk/history-hylands |date=4 April 2016 }}, Chelmsford City Council, published 24 November 2004.

The site on West Hanningfield Road was sold to [[BAE Systems]]; the Waterhouse Lane site sold to E2V and the New Street site is undergoing major redevelopment for residential/mixed use.<ref>{{cite web|title=Former Marconi site, New Street|url=http://www.chelmsford.gov.uk/marconi}}</ref> However, the city's location close to London and at the centre of Essex has helped it grow in importance as an administrative and distribution centre. The one-time largest employer in Chelmsford, RHP, the former Hoffman ball bearing manufacturing company, closed its New Street/Rectory Lane site in 1989. Some of the factory remains and has been converted into luxury apartments and a health club although most of the site was demolished to make way for the Rivermead Campus of the [[Anglia Ruskin University]].\n\nBeaulieu Park, The Village and Chancellor Park are some of the most recent large-scale housing developments built in the city to complement earlier developments, such as [[Chelmer Village]] which was built in the 1980s.\n\nIn 2007, the [[Channel 4]] programme \"[[Location, Location, Location]]\" voted Chelmsford the 8th-best place to live in the UK.<ref>[http://www.buyabetterhome.co.uk/23.html The 20 Best Places in Britain to Buy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017005014/http://www.buyabetterhome.co.uk/23.html |date=17 October 2015 }}.

The Company Christy Norris still survives, trading as Christy Turner Ltd based in [[Ipswich]]. A residential street close to the old Factory was named \"Fell Christy\" in his honour.\n\nAs well as the headquarters of Essex Police, Essex County and Chelmsford City Councils, the modern city is home to a range of national and international companies including [[M&G]] Group, [[Teledyne e2v]] and [[ebm-papst]]. The continuing importance of Chelmsford as an employment centre is demonstrated by the fact that the number of \"in\" commuters (mostly from other parts of Essex) almost exactly balances the number of workers commuting into London.\n\nChelmsford is largely a commercial city which employs around 80,000 people. There are three medium-sized shopping centres, Bond Street, High Chelmer and The Meadows. Chelmsford has six retail parks, Riverside, [[Chelmer Village]], Clocktower Retail Park, The Army & Navy, Moulsham Lodge Retail Park and the smaller Homelands Retail Park housing a Flagship [[B&Q]] Store, Wyvale Garden Centre (part of the Garden centre Group) and Pets Corner. The High Street is full of independent and chain stores. As well as the leading High Street names, there is also a wide variety of specialist retailers, especially in Baddow Road and Moulsham Street which are located at the end of the pedestrianised High Street. On 29 September 2016 a new retail development opened anchored by [[John Lewis & Partners|John Lewis]].

E. B. Crompton|Rookes Evelyn Bell Crompton]]. Crompton as he was better known was a leading authority of electrical engineering and was a pioneer of electric street lighting and electric traction motors within the [[United Kingdom]]. Crompton installed electric street lights around the town centre to celebrate the incorporation of the Borough of Chelmsford in 1888. Although this made Chelmsford one of the earliest towns to receive electric street lighting, the Council later decided to have it removed because gas was cheaper and the Council owned the gasworks. Crompton supplied the traction motors for the first electric trains on [[Southend Pier]]. The company also manufactured electrical switchgear, alternators and generators for many [[power stations]] in the UK and worldwide.\n\nCrompton set up his original factory known as the 'Arc Works' in Queen Street in 1878.

The \u00a334.8m nine-mile (14&nbsp;km) bypass opened in November 1986. It is a very important route, linking London and the M25 motorway with the docks at Harwich and Felixstowe, and the East Coast. Despite being notorious for frequent congestion, poor road surfaces and potholes, as well as accidents, many people move to Chelmsford for it being so well connected by not only rail services, but roads. The A414 trunk road, running from Hemel Hempstead to nearby Maldon, is a main road into the city, just off the A12, and also links the city to the M11 motorway at J7 near Harlow. The A130 provides an important link down to the A127 and A13, while the A131 passes through smaller towns and villages. The nearest motorway is the M25 London Orbital at J11 on the A12, 14 miles away.\n\nChelmsford is around 25 to 30 minutes' drive from [[Stansted Airport]] (via A130/A120), and [[Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow]], [[Gatwick Airport|London Gatwick]], [[London City Airport|London City]], [[Luton Airport|Luton]] and [[Southend Airport|Southend]] airports are all within reach.\n\nIn the southwest of the city centre, the A138 meets the A414 at The Army and Navy roundabout which is notorious for its traffic congestion, even though the north\u2013south road at this point is no longer part of the [[A12 road (Great Britain)|A12]]. Until 1986, when the Chelmsford bypass was opened, the roundabout was in an even worse state. Traffic lights were tried to improve matters in the early 2000s but that scheme was abandoned after a short while however some of the lights where recommissioned for early morning and evening part-time use in 2009. The recently built bus lane on the A1114 Great Baddow Bypass and priority to traffic using it has meant traffic queues approaching the roundabout can now be over {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}} long during peak periods. The roundabout is still called \"The Army and Navy\" even though the public house from which the junction got its name has long been demolished.\n\nThe junction was until 2019 unusual for its flyover, in a similar manner to the [[Hogarth Roundabout]] in [[Chiswick]], London. The flyover was bi-directional, being open where traffic goes one way into city (westerly) until 2.30&nbsp;pm each day and one way (easterly) out of the city after 2.30&nbsp;pm.\n\nThe Army and Navy roundabout flyover was condemned as unsafe and permanently closed in September 2019 by [[Essex County Council]] with demolition works taking place in February/March 2020.<ref>https://www.essexhighways.org/highway-schemes/a1060-a1114-army-and-navy-flyover-chelmsford.aspx</ref>\n\nConstruction of the \u00a332 million replacement A138 'Chelmer Viaduct' road which connects Chelmer Village Way roundabout to the Army and Navy roundabout began in February 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/road-projects/a138-chelmsford-replacement-of-chelmer-viaduct/|title=A138 Chelmsford - Replacement of Chelmer Viaduct|work=highways.gov.uk|access-date=19 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004201001/http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/road-projects/a138-chelmsford-replacement-of-chelmer-viaduct|archive-date=4 October 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The new bridge replaced the previous 1932 built structure which was demolished in 2016.\n\nSince 2 September 2013 in order to save money and reduce carbon emissions, many streets lights in the Chelmsford district switched over to Essex County Council's part-night street lighting scheme.

This was completed early in 2009. Recently, plans were revealed for 'Waterside', a large development of shops, bars and restaurants on the banks of the [[River Chelmer]] on derelict land near the [[Essex Records Office]] at the end of Wharf Road. If this development goes ahead, High Bridge Road connecting Parkway and Springfield Road would be demolished along with the adjacent [[gasometers]] and a new central link road would be built.\n\nThe former [[Anglia Ruskin University]] central campus off Park Road was demolished in January/February 2010 and has been redeveloped by social housing provider Genesis as a mixed use development of housing for social rent, alongside other new housing for private sale and several retail units, new squares, streets and plazas. The new development has been given the name ' City Park West'.\n\nHigh Chelmer Shopping Centre underwent a refit during 2008/2009 with new flooring, lighting with a new front entrance and logo re-brand. Further work is being carried out in the shopping centre; an old portion was demolished in Spring 2011.  The work was completed in early 2012.\n\nIn January 2011, John Lewis announced together with development partner Aquila House Holdings that it was to anchor a brand new {{convert|119,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} department store as part of a {{convert|300000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} retail development at Bond Street. There will also be 2 other large-format shops included in the development. The main anchor store will be complemented by a further 33 shops and 7 restaurants.

Much damaged by fire and vandalism by the time of the sale, the house has now been completely restored by Chelmsford City Council. The house dates from 1730, and the park, {{convert|574|acre|km2}}, was landscaped by [[Humphry Repton]]. It is open to the public and used for a wide range of community events, including the annual music festival [[V Festival]]. It is also available for weddings and other private hires including conferences etc. The 21st [[World Scout Jamboree 2007]] was held at Hylands Park from 27 July to 8 August 2007.

Consequently, gravel deposits are frequently found in the area and current and former [[gravel pit]]s in the district are common.\n\nChelmsford has two rivers, the [[River Can]] and the [[River Chelmer]]. Although often confused to be the same river in the city centre, they are quite separate until they join together towards the east of the city to form the [[Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation]] which heads out towards [[Maldon, Essex|Maldon]] before flowing into [[tidal]] waters at the [[Blackwater Estuary]]. In the other direction, the Chelmer comes from the north from its source near [[Thaxted]] while the Can comes from the West from [[Writtle]] where it separates from the River Wid.\n\nUp to the 1960s, these rivers were extremely prone to flooding the city centre area including two disastrous floods in August 1888 (known locally as 'The Great Flood') and in September 1958 (which also badly affected nearby [[Wickford]]) causing widespread damage. Flood prevention schemes in the 1960s on both rivers have largely prevented any further incidents here although the natural floodplains to the north and east such as The 'Baddow Meads' and The 'Chelmer Valley' continue to see flooding on a regular basis especially after prolonged heavy rainfall.\n\n===Climate===\nAs with the large majority of the UK, Chelmsford has a [[maritime climate]] (''Cfb'' in the [[Koeppen climate classification]]). Being in the southeast of England, the city enjoys a warmer climate than most of the United Kingdom; it is also one of the drier areas in the country.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

{"title_page": "Papal States under Pope Pius IX", "text_new": "{{Merge from|1859 Perugia uprising|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe '''Papal States under [[Pope Pius IX]]''' assumed a much more modern and secular character than had been seen under previous pontificates, and yet this progressive modernization was not nearly sufficient in resisting the tide of political liberalization and unification in Italy during the middle of the 19th century.\n\nA view of the Papal States from the perspective of the mid-19th \ncentury is readily available.<ref name=\"About\">{{cite book \n|title= The Roman Question |author= Edmond About\n|year= 1859 |isbn= 978-1-4255-1934-6}}  This book is a primary reference,\nwritten by a French Catholic observer who visited the Papal States at \nthe time.  It is opinionated, claiming to convey the opinions of the Pope's \nsubjects at the time. The text is available a no cost from [[Project Gutenberg]].</ref>\n\n==Pius' internal administration==\nPius IX was not only Pope, but until 1870 also the [[Sovereign]] Ruler of the [[Papal States]]. His rule was considered secular and as such he was occasionally accorded the title \"king\". However whether this was ever a title accepted by the Holy See is unclear. One of the most fervent contemporary critic of his [[infallibility]] [[Dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]], [[Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger]], considered the \"political regime\" of the pope in the Papal States as \"wise, well-intentioned, mild-natured, frugal and open for innovations\".<ref>Schmidlin 45</ref> Yet there was controversy. In the period before the [[1848 revolution]], Pius IX was a most ardent reformer. After the revolution however, his political reforms and constitutional improvements were considered minimalists, remaining largely within the framework of the 1850 laws mentioned above<ref>Schmidlin 47</ref>\n\n=== Governmental structure ===\n{{main|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}\nThe governmental structure of the Papal States reflected the dual spiritual-secular character of the papacy at the time. The secular or lay persons were strongly in the majority with 6850 persons versus 300 members of the clergy. But the clergy occupied the key decision making positions and every job applicant had to present a character evaluation from his Parish priests in order to be considered.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\">Stehle 47</ref>\n\nThe Cardinal Secretary of State appointed and dismissed ministers of which three were lay people. Their decisions were subject to papal approvals. They were ministers for: ''Internal Affairs'' including Police and Health; ''Commerce,'' including trade, crafts and industry, agriculture, arts, railways; ''War'', including the papal army; ''Clemency and Justice'' including police and the judiciary.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\"/>\n\n=== Finance ===\n[[File:Romapio9col.jpg|280px|thumb|left|A view of the pastoral setting in the centre of Rome showing the [[Coloseum]] and [[Foro Romano]] around 1870]]\nThe financial administration in the Papal States under Pius IX were increasingly put in the hands of lay persons. The budget and financial administration in the Papal States had long been subject to criticism even before Pius IX, and did not end with his papacy. In 1850, he created a governmental finance congregation consisting of four lay persons with finance    background for the twenty provinces. The chronic budget deficit disappeared by 1858. There was a steady increase in [[revenue]]s stemming from the [[taxation]] of [[export]]s, [[import]]s and [[trade]] and a decrease in spending especially for the papal army.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\">Schmidlin 50</ref> The tax burden of the citizens was far below European average, which resulted in an influx of foreign residents into Rome, many of them non-Catholics, which created local problems with religious services and their integration. The papacy reacted with new consumption taxes for luxury items and beer, and an exemption from real estate taxes of low-cost houses for long-term residents. A problem after 1850 was the worthless paper money introduced by the revolutionary Republican government in 1848. It was accepted and exchanged at a lower value by the papal treasury.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\">Schmidlin 51</ref>\n\nThe criticism of the economic policies of Pius IX included the argument that the Pope maintained in Rome large areas for [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] at the expense of potential [[industrial development]]. Supporters of Pius point to the increases in agro-industry during his leadership, especially in the areas of [[silk]], [[olive oil]] and [[wine]] production and great productivity gains in agriculture, accredited in part to a scientific research institute and benevolent taxation, which permitted refinancing of existing debts.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\"/>\n\n=== Commerce and trade ===\n[[File:Pio91877.jpg|170px|upright|right]]\nPius IX is credited with systematic efforts to improve [[manufacturing]] and trade by giving advantages and papal prizes to domestic producers of [[wool]], [[silk]] and other materials destined for export. He improved the transportation system by building roads, viaducts, bridges and [[sea port]]s. A series of new railway links connected the Papal States to northern Italy. It became soon visible that the Northern Italians were more adept to exploit economically the modern means of communication than the inhabitants in central and Southern Italy.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\">Schmidlin 52</ref> A growing discrepancy of income developed poverty in the Papal States, which Pius IX tried to respond to with increased charities. This in turn made him subject to criticism of being too generous to lazy and apathetic populations, making them almost dependent on his social policies.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\"/>\n\nTo increase commerce, Pius engaged in numerous and far-reaching agreements with neighbouring states but also with the Belgium, United States, Russia, France, and [[Prussia]] to reduce mutual [[tariff]]s, equal treatment of commercial entities and ships from different states, crime fighting and postal conventions<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\">Schmidlin 53</ref>\n\n=== Justice ===\nThe justice system of the Papal States was subject to numerous accusations at the time, not unlike the justice systems in the rest of Italy. There was a general lack of legal books and standards, and accusations of partiality of the judges. Throughout Italy but also in the Papal States, mafia-type criminal bands threatened commerce and travellers in several regions, engaging in robbery and murder at will.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\">Schmidlin 49</ref> This problem, immortalized by [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s [[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|''The Betrothed'']], and vividly described by the English Cardinal [[Nicholas Wiseman]], existed long before Pius IX. In 1854 a reform was issued, intended to clarify jurisdiction. In 1859, Pius ordered the creation of a unified criminal code. He also ordered a reform of papal prisons and penal houses. The Police was put under the Secretary of State, and given more authority and power. This contributed to a significant reduction of crime but also to accusations of partiality.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\"/>\n\n=== Military ===\n[[File:Pio9soldiers.jpg|260px|thumb|upright|left|Papal soldiers around 1860]]\nA unique position was granted to the papal army, consisting almost exclusively of foreigners, since the Roman [[Black Nobility]] was not willing to serve and the population resisted military service as well, despite a decent salary structure and the potential for promotion. A main, but not the only, element of the papal army was the [[Swiss Guard]]. The number of papal soldiers amounted to 15.000 in 1859.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/> The numerous nationalities presented linguistic problems, and their armament was not high on the priority list of Pius IX. During much of his pontificate, the military security was guaranteed by either Austria or France. However, the Austrian and French troops did not always behave like model Christians, creating resentments in the local population and furthering the nationalistic tendencies towards a unified Italy, free of any foreigners.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/>\n\n=== Education ===\nLiberals attacked Pius IX for his educational policies, which largely were a continuation of traditional Catholic education priorities with an accompanying neglect of the natural sciences on the primary and secondary level. Education was not mandatory in the Papal States, a fact which some attributed to the low educational standards in comparison to other countries. Secondary education was largely in private hands or in the control of Catholic institutes and religious orders. During his reign, Pius IX undertook innovative efforts: he created new schools for the [[Disability|handicapped]] and evening academies for persons to improve their education after working hours. He also created all-day schools for children whose parents were absent during the working hours.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> To improve the overall situation, he created a [[Education|ministry of education]] in 1851.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\">Schmidlin 63</ref>\n\n[[File:Pionono12.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|right|An hagiographic presentation of Pius IX from 1873]] \nThe two papal universities in [[Rome]] and [[Bologna]] suffered much from the revolutionary activities in 1848 but their standards in the areas of science, mathematics, philosophy and theology were considered adequate.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/>  Pius recognized that much had to be done and instituted a reform commission.<ref>1851</ref> He increased the powers of the ''Camerlengo'' and decided to personally appoint each head of the universities. He increased the salaries of the university staff, increased staff positions, and added [[geology]], [[agriculture]] [[science]], [[archaeology]], [[astronomy]], and [[botany]] to the teaching areas. He created a new clinic for [[pregnant]] women to give birth, several museums, and a papal astronomical observatory<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\" /> [[Theology]] students were subjected to more rigorous training.

In 1848, nationalist and liberal revolutions began to break out across Europe; in 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared and [[Pope Pius IX]] fled the city. [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte]], recently elected president of the newly declared [[French Second Republic]], saw an opportunity to assuage conservative Catholic opinion in France, and in cooperation with Austria sent troops to restore Papal rule in Rome. After some hard fighting (in which [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] distinguished himself on the Italian side), Pius was returned to Rome, and repenting of his previous liberal tendencies pursued a harsh, conservative policy even more repressive than that of his predecessors.

Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government in the south, the Sardinians petitioned Napoleon for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the Two Sicilies, which was granted on the condition that Rome was left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year, and a unified Kingdom of Italy was declared. The Papal States were reduced to the [[Latium]] region surrounding Rome, raising the [[Roman Question]].\n\n===Rome declared capital of Italy===\n[[File:Popepiusix.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Pius IX]], under whose rule the Papal States passed into secular control]]\nRome was declared the capital of Italy in March 1861, when the first Italian Parliament met in the kingdom's old capital [[Turin]] in Piedmont. However, the Italian Government could not take possession of its capital, because [[Napoleon III]] kept a French garrison in Rome protecting [[Pope Pius IX]]. By the [[September Convention]] of 1864, Napoleon III agreed to withdraw French forces from Rome in return for Italy respecting the borders of the rump Papal States. French forces were withdrawn by 1866, but their absence encouraged Garibaldi to launch a renewed attempt to take Rome and French troops returned, defeating Garibaldi's expedition at the [[Battle of Mentana]] The opportunity to eliminate the last vestige of the Papal States came when the [[Franco-Prussian War]] began in July 1870.

Pius IX allowed violent outbursts to escape him. Throwing the King\u2019s letter upon the table he exclaimed: \"Fine loyalty! You are all a set of vipers, of whited sepulchres, and wanting in faith.\" He was perhaps alluding to other letters received from the King. Later, growing calmer, he exclaimed: \"I am no prophet, nor son of a prophet, but I tell you, you will never enter Rome!\" San Martino was so mortified that he left the next day.<ref>{{cite book|first=Raffaele |last=De Cesare|title=The Last Days of Papal Rome|url=https://archive.org/details/thelastdaysofpap00cesauoft |publisher=Archibald Constable & Co|location=London|year=1909}}</ref>\n\n===Military resistance to Italy===\nOn September 10, Italy declared war on the Papal States, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the papal frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that a peaceful entry could be negotiated. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up at least a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and Latium were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a [[plebiscite]] held in the following October.\n\n===Capture of Rome===\n{{Main article|Capture of Rome}}\nThis event, described in Italian history books as a liberation, was taken very bitterly by the Pope. The Italian government had offered to allow the Pope to retain control of the [[Leonine City]] on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], but Pius rejected the overture. Early the following year, the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome. The Pope, whose previous residence, the [[Quirinal Palace]], had become the royal palace of the Kings of Italy, withdrew in protest into the Vatican, where he lived as a [[prisoner in the Vatican|self-proclaimed \"prisoner\"]], refusing to leave or to set foot in [[St. Peter's Square]], and forbidding ([[Non Expedit]]) Catholics on pain of [[excommunication]] to participate in elections in the new Italian state, an action which effectively guaranteed that only persons hostile to the Catholic Church would be involved in the new government.\n\n===Prisoner of the Vatican===\nIn 1929, the papacy \u2014 then under [[Pope Pius XI]] \u2014 renounced its claim to the Papal States<ref>\"The Holy See ... declares that the 'Roman Question' has been definitely and irrevocably settled and therefore eliminated and it recognizes the Kingdom of Italy under the Dynasty of the House of Savoy with Rome as the capital of the Italian State\" ([http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813090725/http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf |date=2011-08-13 }}</ref> and signed with Italy the [[Lateran Treaty]], which created the independent [[Vatican City|State of Vatican City]], \"under the sovereignty of the [[Pope|Supreme Pontiff]]\".<ref>Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n* Pougeois, Histoire de Pie IX, son pontificat et son siecle, Vol I-VI, Paris, 1877\n* Schmidlin, Josef, Papstgeschichte, Vol I-IV, K\u00f6stel-Pusztet M\u00fcnchen, 1922-1939\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Papal States Under Pope Pius Ix}}\n[[Category:Pope Pius IX]]\n[[Category:History of the Papal States]]\n[[Category:19th century in the Papal States]]\n", "text_old": "{{Merge from|1859 Perugia uprising|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe '''Papal States under [[Pope Pius IX]]''' assumed a much more modern and secular character than had been seen under previous pontificates, and yet this progressive modernization was not nearly sufficient in resisting the tide of political liberalization and unification in Italy during the middle of the 19th century.\n\nA view of the Papal States from the perspective of the mid-19th \ncentury is readily available.<ref name=\"About\">{{cite book \n|title= The Roman Question |author= Edmond About\n|year= 1859 |isbn= 978-1-4255-1934-6}}  This book is a primary reference,\nwritten by a French Catholic observer who visited the Papal States at \nthe time.

The text is available a no cost from [[Project Gutenberg]].</ref>\n\n==Pius' internal administration==\nPius IX was not only Pope, but until 1870 also the [[Sovereign]] Ruler of the [[Papal States]]. His rule was considered secular and as such he was occasionally accorded the title \"king\". However whether this was ever a title accepted by the Holy See is unclear. One of the most fervent contemporary critic of his [[infallibility]] [[Dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]], [[Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger]], considered the \"political regime\" of the pope in the Papal States as \"wise, well-intentioned, mild-natured, frugal and open for innovations\".<ref>Schmidlin 45</ref> Yet there was controversy. In the period before the [[1848 revolution]], Pius IX was a most ardent reformer. After the revolution however, his political reforms and constitutional improvements were considered minimalists, remaining largely within the framework of the 1850 laws mentioned above<ref>Schmidlin 47</ref>\n\n=== Governmental structure ===\n{{main|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}\nThe governmental structure of the Papal States reflected the dual spiritual-secular character of the papacy at the time. The secular or lay persons were strongly in the majority with 6850 persons versus 300 members of the clergy. But the clergy occupied the key decision making positions and every job applicant had to present a character evaluation from his Parish priests in order to be considered.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\">Stehle 47</ref>\n\nThe Cardinal Secretary of State appointed and dismissed ministers of which three were lay people. Their decisions were subject to papal approvals. They were ministers for: ''Internal Affairs'' including Police and Health; ''Commerce,'' including trade, crafts and industry, agriculture, arts, railways; ''War'', including the papal army; ''Clemency and Justice'' including police and the judiciary.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\"/>\n\n=== Finance ===\n[[File:Romapio9col.jpg|280px|thumb|left|A view of the pastoral setting in the centre of Rome showing the [[Coloseum]] and [[Foro Romano]] around 1870]]\nThe financial administration in the Papal States under Pius IX were increasingly put in the hands of lay persons. The budget and financial administration in the Papal States had long been subject to criticism even before Pius IX, and did not end with his papacy. In 1850, he created a governmental finance congregation consisting of four lay persons with finance    background for the twenty provinces. The chronic budget deficit disappeared by 1858. There was a steady increase in [[revenue]]s stemming from the [[taxation]] of [[export]]s, [[import]]s and [[trade]] and a decrease in spending especially for the papal army.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\">Schmidlin 50</ref> The tax burden of the citizens was far below European average, which resulted in an influx of foreign residents into Rome, many of them non-Catholics, which created local problems with religious services and their integration. The papacy reacted with new consumption taxes for luxury items and beer, and an exemption from real estate taxes of low-cost houses for long-term residents. A problem after 1850 was the worthless paper money introduced by the revolutionary Republican government in 1848. It was accepted and exchanged at a lower value by the papal treasury.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\">Schmidlin 51</ref>\n\nThe criticism of the economic policies of Pius IX included the argument that the Pope maintained in Rome large areas for [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] at the expense of potential [[industrial development]]. Supporters of Pius point to the increases in agro-industry during his leadership, especially in the areas of [[silk]], [[olive oil]] and [[wine]] production and great productivity gains in agriculture, accredited in part to a scientific research institute and benevolent taxation, which permitted refinancing of existing debts.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\"/>\n\n=== Commerce and trade ===\n[[File:Pio91877.jpg|170px|upright|right]]\nPius IX is credited with systematic efforts to improve [[manufacturing]] and trade by giving advantages and papal prizes to domestic producers of [[wool]], [[silk]] and other materials destined for export. He improved the transportation system by building roads, viaducts, bridges and [[sea port]]s. A series of new railway links connected the Papal States to northern Italy. It became soon visible that the Northern Italians were more adept to exploit economically the modern means of communication than the inhabitants in central and Southern Italy.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\">Schmidlin 52</ref> A growing discrepancy of income developed poverty in the Papal States, which Pius IX tried to respond to with increased charities. This in turn made him subject to criticism of being too generous to lazy and apathetic populations, making them almost dependent on his social policies.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\"/>\n\nTo increase commerce, Pius engaged in numerous and far-reaching agreements with neighbouring states but also with the Belgium, United States, Russia, France, and [[Prussia]] to reduce mutual [[tariff]]s, equal treatment of commercial entities and ships from different states, crime fighting and postal conventions<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\">Schmidlin 53</ref>\n\n=== Justice ===\nThe justice system of the Papal States was subject to numerous accusations at the time, not unlike the justice systems in the rest of Italy. There was a general lack of legal books and standards, and accusations of partiality of the judges. Throughout Italy but also in the Papal States, mafia-type criminal bands threatened commerce and travellers in several regions, engaging in robbery and murder at will.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\">Schmidlin 49</ref> This problem, immortalized by [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s [[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|''The Betrothed'']], and vividly described by the English Cardinal [[Nicholas Wiseman]], existed long before Pius IX. In 1854 a reform was issued, intended to clarify jurisdiction. In 1859, Pius ordered the creation of a unified criminal code. He also ordered a reform of papal prisons and penal houses. The Police was put under the Secretary of State, and given more authority and power. This contributed to a significant reduction of crime but also to accusations of partiality.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\"/>\n\n=== Military ===\n[[File:Pio9soldiers.jpg|260px|thumb|upright|left|Papal soldiers around 1860]]\nA unique position was granted to the papal army, consisting almost exclusively of foreigners, since the Roman [[Black Nobility]] was not willing to serve and the population resisted military service as well, despite a decent salary structure and the potential for promotion. A main, but not the only, element of the papal army was the [[Swiss Guard]]. The number of papal soldiers amounted to 15.000 in 1859.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/> The numerous nationalities presented linguistic problems, and their armament was not high on the priority list of Pius IX. During much of his pontificate, the military security was guaranteed by either Austria or France. However, the Austrian and French troops did not always behave like model Christians, creating resentments in the local population and furthering the nationalistic tendencies towards a unified Italy, free of any foreigners.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/>\n\n=== Education ===\nLiberals attacked Pius IX for his educational policies, which largely were a continuation of traditional Catholic education priorities with an accompanying neglect of the natural sciences on the primary and secondary level. Education was not mandatory in the Papal States, a fact which some attributed to the low educational standards in comparison to other countries. Secondary education was largely in private hands or in the control of Catholic institutes and religious orders. During his reign, Pius IX undertook innovative efforts: he created new schools for the [[Disability|handicapped]] and evening academies for persons to improve their education after working hours. He also created all-day schools for children whose parents were absent during the working hours.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> To improve the overall situation, he created a [[Education|ministry of education]] in 1851.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\">Schmidlin 63</ref>\n\n[[File:Pionono12.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|right|An hagiographic presentation of Pius IX from 1873]] \nThe two papal universities in [[Rome]] and [[Bologna]] suffered much from the revolutionary activities in 1848 but their standards in the areas of science, mathematics, philosophy and theology were considered adequate.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/>  Pius recognized that much had to be done and instituted a reform commission.<ref>1851</ref> He increased the powers of the ''Camerlengo'' and decided to personally appoint each head of the universities. He increased the salaries of the university staff, increased staff positions, and added [[geology]], [[agriculture]] [[science]], [[archaeology]], [[astronomy]], and [[botany]] to the teaching areas. He created a new clinic for [[pregnant]] women to give birth, several museums, and a papal astronomical observatory<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\" /> [[Theology]] students were subjected to more rigorous training. Theology students from foreign countries benefited from his financial support of [[Germany|German]], [[France|French]], [[Poland|Polish]], [[South America]]n, [[North America]]n, [[England|English]], and [[Ireland|Irish]] seminaries, where they could study together.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\"/>\n\n=== Social life ===\nTheir one newspaper ''Giornale di Roma'' and one periodical, ''Civilta Cattolica'', run by [[Jesuits]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> When Marcantonio Pacelli, the grandfather of [[Eugenio Pacelli]], approached Pius regarding an official newspaper, [[L\u2019Osservatore Romano]] which actually printed what the Pope said and did the previous day, Pius turned him down.

You are all a set of vipers, of whited sepulchres, and wanting in faith.\" He was perhaps alluding to other letters received from the King. Later, growing calmer, he exclaimed: \"I am no prophet, nor son of a prophet, but I tell you, you will never enter Rome!\" San Martino was so mortified that he left the next day.<ref>{{cite book|first=Raffaele |last=De Cesare|title=The Last Days of Papal Rome|url=https://archive.org/details/thelastdaysofpap00cesauoft |publisher=Archibald Constable & Co|location=London|year=1909}}</ref>\n\n===Military resistance to Italy===\nOn September 10, Italy declared war on the Papal States, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the papal frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that a peaceful entry could be negotiated. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up at least a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and Latium were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a [[plebiscite]] held in the following October.\n\n===Capture of Rome===\n{{Main article|Capture of Rome}}\nThis event, described in Italian history books as a liberation, was taken very bitterly by the Pope. The Italian government had offered to allow the Pope to retain control of the [[Leonine City]] on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], but Pius rejected the overture. Early the following year, the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome. The Pope, whose previous residence, the [[Quirinal Palace]], had become the royal palace of the Kings of Italy, withdrew in protest into the Vatican, where he lived as a [[prisoner in the Vatican|self-proclaimed \"prisoner\"]], refusing to leave or to set foot in [[St. Peter's Square]], and forbidding ([[Non Expedit]]) Catholics on pain of [[excommunication]] to participate in elections in the new Italian state, an action which effectively guaranteed that only persons hostile to the Catholic Church would be involved in the new government.\n\n===Prisoner of the Vatican===\nIn 1929, the papacy \u2014 then under [[Pope Pius XI]] \u2014 renounced its claim to the Papal States<ref>\"The Holy See ... declares that the 'Roman Question' has been definitely and irrevocably settled and therefore eliminated and it recognizes the Kingdom of Italy under the Dynasty of the House of Savoy with Rome as the capital of the Italian State\" ([http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813090725/http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf |date=2011-08-13 }}</ref> and signed with Italy the [[Lateran Treaty]], which created the independent [[Vatican City|State of Vatican City]], \"under the sovereignty of the [[Pope|Supreme Pontiff]]\".<ref>Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n* Pougeois, Histoire de Pie IX, son pontificat et son siecle, Vol I-VI, Paris, 1877\n* Schmidlin, Josef, Papstgeschichte, Vol I-IV, K\u00f6stel-Pusztet M\u00fcnchen, 1922-1939\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Papal States Under Pope Pius Ix}}\n[[Category:Pope Pius IX]]\n[[Category:History of the Papal States]]\n[[Category:19th century in the Papal States]]\n", "name_user": "Jzsj", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSocial life:ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_States_under_Pope_Pius_IX"}

{"title_page": "Art and emotion", "text_new": "In [[psychology of art]], the relationship between '''art and emotion''' has newly been the subject of extensive study thanks to the intervention of esteemed art historian [[Alexander Nemerov]]. [[Emotion]]al or aesthetic responses to [[art]] have previously been viewed as basic stimulus response, but new theories and research have suggested that these experiences are more complex and able to be studied experimentally.<ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart>{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|title=Emotional Responses to Art: From Collation and Arousal to Cognition and Emotion.|journal=Review of General Psychology|date=1 January 2005|volume=9|issue=4|pages=342\u2013357|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.9.4.342|url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/Emotional%20Responses%20to%20Art.pdf}}</ref> Emotional responses are often regarded as the keystone to experiencing art, and the creation of an emotional experience has been argued as the purpose of artistic expression.<ref name=Fellous-review>{{cite journal|last=Fellous|first=Jean-Marc|title=A mechanistic view of the expression and experience of emotion in the arts. Deeper that reason: Emotion and its role in literature, music and art by Jenefer Robinson|journal=The American Journal of Psychology|year=2006|volume=119|issue=4|pages=668\u2013674|doi=10.2307/20445371|jstor=20445371}}</ref> Research has shown that the neurological underpinnings of perceiving art differ from those used in standard object recognition.<ref name=Cupchick-neuro>{{cite journal|last=Cupchik|first=Gerald C.|author2=Vartanian, Oshin|author3= Crawley, Adrian|author4= Mikulis, David J.|title=Viewing artworks: Contributions of cognitive control and perceptual facilitation to aesthetic experience|journal=Brain and Cognition|date=1 June 2009|volume=70|issue=1|pages=84\u201391|doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2009.01.003|pmid=19223099}}</ref>  Instead, [[brain]] regions involved in the experience of emotion and goal setting show activation when viewing art.<ref name=Cupchick-neuro />\n\n== Basis for emotional responses to art ==\nEvolutionary ancestry has hard-wired humans to have affective responses for certain patterns and traits. These predispositions lend themselves to responses when looking at certain visual arts as well. Identification of subject matter is the first step in understanding the visual image. Being presented with visual stimuli creates initial confusion. Being able to comprehend a figure and background creates closure and triggers the pleasure centers of the brain by remedying the confusion. Once an image is identified, meaning can be created by accessing memory relative to the visual stimuli and associating personal memories with what is being viewed.<ref name=\"barry\">{{cite journal | last1 = Barry | first1 = A | year = 2006 | title = Perceptual Aesthetics: Transcendent Emotion, Neurological Image | url = | journal = Visual Communication Quarterly | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 134\u2013151 | doi = 10.1207/s15551407vcq1303_2 }}</ref>\n\nOther methods of stimulating initial interest that can lead to emotion involves pattern recognition. [[Symmetry]] is often found in works of art, and the human brain unconsciously searches for symmetry for a number of reasons. Potential predators were [[Symmetry in biology|bilaterally symmetrical]], as were potential prey. Bilateral symmetry also exists in humans, and a healthy human is typically relatively symmetrical. This attraction to symmetry was therefore advantageous, as it helped humans recognize danger, food, and mates. Art containing symmetry therefore is typically approached and positively valenced to humans.<ref name=\"barry\" />\n\nAnother example is to observe paintings or photographs of bright, open landscapes that often evoke a feeling of beauty, [[Relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]], or happiness. This connection to pleasant emotions exists because it was advantageous to humans before today's society to be able to see far into the distance in a brightly lit vista. Similarly, visual images that are dark and/or obscure typically elicit emotions of [[anxiety]] and fear. This is because an impeded visual field is disadvantageous for a human to be able to defend itself.<ref name=\"carroll\">{{cite journal | last1 = Carroll | first1 = N | title = Art and Mood | year = 2003 | url = | journal = Monist | volume = 86 | issue = 4| pages = 521\u2013555 | doi=10.5840/monist200386426}}</ref>\n\n=== Meta-emotions ===\n{{Main|Meta-emotion}}\nThe optimal visual artwork creates what Noy & Noy-Sharav call \"meta-emotions\". These are multiple emotions that are triggered at the same time. They posit that what people see when immediately looking at a piece of artwork are the formal, technical qualities of the work and its complexity. Works that are well-made but lacking in appropriate complexity, or works that are intricate but missing in technical skill will not produce \"meta-emotions\".<ref name=\"noy\">{{cite journal | last1 = Noy | first1 = P. | last2 = Noy-Sharav | first2 = D. | year = 2013 | title = Art and Emotions | url = | journal = International Journal of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 100\u2013107 | doi = 10.1002/aps.1352 }}</ref> For example, seeing a perfectly painted chair (technical quality but no complexity) or a sloppily drawn image of [[Christ]] on the cross (complex but no skill) would be unlikely to stimulate deep emotional responses. However, beautifully painted works of Christ's [[crucifixion]] are likely make people who can relate or who understand the story behind it weep.\n\nNoy & Noy-Sharav also claim that art is the most potent form of emotional communication. They cite examples of people being able to listen to and [[dance]] to [[music]] for hours without getting tired and literature being able to take people to far away, imagined lands inside their heads. Art forms give humans a higher satisfaction in emotional release than simply managing emotions on their own. Art allows people to have a cathartic release of pent-up emotions either by creating work or by witnessing and pseudo-experiencing what they see in front of them. Instead of being passive recipients of actions and images, art is intended for people to challenge themselves and work through the emotions they see presented in the artistic message.<ref name=\"noy\" />\n\n==Types of elicited emotions==\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = Art is a human activity, consisting in this, that one man consciously, by means of certain external signs, hands on to others feelings he has lived through, and that other people are infected by these feeling and also experience them.\n |source = --[[Leo Tolstoy]], ''[[What Is Art?]]'' (1897)<ref name=\"Maude1902\">{{cite book|last=Maude|first=Aylmer|title=Essays on art: I. An introduction to \"What is art?\"; II. Tolstoy's view of art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=17o8AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA34|accessdate=2 November 2012|year=1902|publisher=Grant Richards|page=34}}</ref>\n |width = 30%\n |align= right\n |bgcolor= #FFFACD\n}}\nThere is debate among researchers as to what types of emotions works of art can elicit; whether these are defined emotions such as anger, confusion or happiness, or a general feeling of aesthetic appreciation.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure>{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|title=Looking past pleasure: Anger, confusion, disgust, pride, surprise, and other unusual aesthetic emotions.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2009|volume=3|issue=1|pages=48\u201351|doi=10.1037/a0014632|url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/P_Silvia_Looking_2009.pdf}}</ref> The aesthetic experience seems to be determined by liking or disliking a work of art, placed along a continuum of pleasure\u2013displeasure.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /> However, other diverse emotions can still be felt in response to art, which can be sorted into three categories: Knowledge Emotions, Hostile Emotions, and Self-Conscious Emotions.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure />\n\n===Liking and comprehensibility ===\nPleasure elicited by works of art can also have multiple sources. A number of theories suggest that enjoyment of a work of art is dependent on its comprehensibility or ability to be understood easily.<ref name=Millis-titles>{{cite journal|last=Millis|first=Keith|title=Making meaning brings pleasure: The influence of titles on aesthetic experiences.|journal=Emotion|date=1 January 2001|volume=1|issue=3|pages=320\u2013329|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.1.3.320|pmid=12934689}}</ref> Therefore, when more information about a work of art is provided, such as a title, description, or artist's statement, researchers predict that viewers will understand the piece better, and demonstrate greater liking for it.<ref name=Millis-titles /> Experimental evidence shows that the presence of a title for a work increases perceived understanding, regardless of whether that title is elaborative or descriptive.<ref name=Millis-titles />  Elaborative titles did affect aesthetic responses to the work, suggesting viewers were not creating alternative explanations for the works if an explaining title is given.<ref name=Millis-titles /> Descriptive or random titles do not show any of these effects.<ref name=Millis-titles />\n\nFurthering the thought that pleasure in art derives from its comprehensibility and processing fluency, some authors have described this experience as an emotion.<ref name=Armstrong-Beauty>{{cite journal|last=Armstrong|first=Thomas|author2=Detweiler-Bedell, Brian|title=Beauty as an emotion: The exhilarating prospect of mastering a challenging world.|journal=Review of General Psychology|date=1 January 2008|volume=12|issue=4|pages=305\u2013329|doi=10.1037/a0012558|citeseerx=10.1.1.406.1825}}</ref> The emotional feeling of beauty, or an aesthetic experience, does not have a valence emotional undercurrent, rather is general cognitive arousal due to the fluent processing of a novel stimuli.<ref name=Armstrong-Beauty /> Some authors believe that aesthetic emotions is enough of a unique and verifiable experience that it should be included in general theories of emotion.<ref name=Armstrong-Beauty />\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = Art is the emotional expression of human personality.\n |source = --[[Eug\u00e8ne V\u00e9ron]], ''L'Esthetique'' (1882)<ref>{{cite book|last=V\u00e9ron|first=Eug\u00e8ne|title=L'Esthetique|year=1882|location=Paris|page=35|edition=1st|authorlink=Eug\u00e8ne V\u00e9ron}}</ref> \n |width = 25%\n |align= right\n |bgcolor= #c6dbf7\n}}\n\n===Knowledge emotions===\nKnowledge emotions deal with reactions to thinking and feeling, such as interest, confusion, and surprise.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /> They often stem from self-analysis of what the viewer knows, expects, and perceives.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /><ref name=Silvia-confusion /> This set of emotions also spur actions that motivate further learning and thinking.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure />\n\n====Interest====\nInterest in a work of art arises from perceiving the work as new, complex, and unfamiliar, as well as understandable.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /><ref name=Silvia-confusion /> This dimension is studied most often by aesthetics researchers, and can be equated with aesthetic pleasure or an aesthetic experience.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /> This stage of art experience usually occurs as the viewer understands the artwork they are viewing, and the art fits into their knowledge and expectations while providing a new experience.<ref name=Silvia-confusion />\n\n====Confusion====\nConfusion can be viewed as an opposite to interest, and serves as a signal to the self to inform the viewer that they cannot comprehend what they are looking at, and confusion often necessitates a shift in action to remedy the lack of understanding.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /><ref name=Silvia-confusion>{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|title=Confusion and interest: The role of knowledge emotions in aesthetic experience.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2010|volume=4|issue=2|pages=75\u201380|doi=10.1037/a0017081|url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/P_Silvia_Confusion_in%20press.pdf}}</ref> Confusion is thought to stem from uncertainty, and a lack of one's expectations and knowledge being met by a work of art.<ref name=Silvia-confusion /> \nConfusion is most often experienced by art novices, and therefore must often be dealt with by those in arts education.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure />\n\n====Surprise====\nSurprise functions as a disruption of current action to alert a viewer to a significant event.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /> The emotion is centered around the experience of something new and unexpected, and can be ellicied by sensory incongruity.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /> Art can ellicit surprise when expectations about the work are not met, but the work changes those expectations in an understandable way.\n\n===Hostile emotions===\nHostile emotions toward art are often very visible in the form of anger or frustration, and can result in censorship, but are less easily described by a continuum of aesthetic pleasure-displeasure.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /> These reactions center around the hostility triad: anger, disgust, and contempt.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure />  These emotions often motivate aggression, self-assertion, and violence, and arise from perception of the artist's deliberate trespass onto the expectations of the viewer.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure />\n\n===Self-conscious emotions===\n{{Main|Self-conscious emotions}}\nSelf-conscious emotions are responses that reflect upon the self and one's actions, such as pride, guilt, shame, regret and embarrassment.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /> These are much more complex emotions, and involve assessing events as agreeing with one's self-perception or not, and adjusting one's behavior accordingly.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /> There are numerous instances of artists expressing self-conscious emotions in response to their art, and self-conscious emotions can also be felt collectively.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure />\n\n====Sublime feelings====\nResearchers have investigated the experience of the sublime, viewed as similar to aesthetic appreciation, which causes general psychological arousal.<ref

but may be more related to an experience of fear.<ref name=Eskine-sublime /> Researchers have shown that feelings of fear induced before looking at artwork results in more sublime feelings in response to those works.<ref name=Eskine-sublime />\n\n====Aesthetic chills====\n{{Main|Aesthetic chills}}\nAnother common emotional response is that of chills when viewing a work of art. The feeling is predicted to be related to similar aesthetic experiences such as awe, feeling touched, or absorption.<ref name=Silvia-chills>{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|author2=Nusbaum, Emily C.|title=On personality and piloerection: Individual differences in aesthetic chills and other unusual aesthetic experiences.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2011|volume=5|issue=3|pages=208\u2013214|doi=10.1037/a0021914|url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/P_Silvia_Personality_2011.pdf}}</ref> Personality traits along the Big 5 Inventory have been shown to be predictors of a person's experience of aesthetic chills, especially a high rating on Openness to Experience.<ref name=Silvia-chills /> This counters the effect of fluid intelligence, where those with higher amounts of fluid intelligence are less likely to experience chills.<ref name=Silvia-chills /> Experience with the arts also predicts someone's experience of aesthetic chills, but this may be due to them experiencing art more frequently.<ref name=Silvia-chills />\n\n===Effects of expertise===\nThe fact that art is analyzed and experienced differently by those with artistic training and expertise than those who are artistically naive has been shown numerous times. Researchers have tried to understand how experts interact with art so differently from the art naive, as experts tend to like more abstract compositions, and show a greater liking for both modern and classical types of art.<ref name=Leder-appreciated>{{cite journal|last=Leder|first=Helmut|author2=Gerger, Gernot|author3= Dressler, Stefan G.|author4= Schabmann, Alfred|title=How art is appreciated.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2012|volume=6|issue=1|pages=2\u201310|doi=10.1037/a0026396}}</ref> Experts also exhibit more arousal when looking at modern and abstract works, while non-experts show more arousal to classical works.<ref name=Leder-appreciated />\n\nOther researchers predicted that experts find more complex art interesting because they have changed their appraisals of art to create more interest, or are possibly making completely different types of appraisals than novices.<ref name=Silvia-expertise>{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|title=Artistic training and interest in visual art: Applying the appraisal model of aesthetic emotions|journal=Empirical Studies of the Arts|year=2006|volume=24|issue=2|pages=139\u2013161|doi=10.2190/dx8k-6wea-6wpa-fm84}}</ref> Experts described works rated high in complexity as easier to understand and more interesting than did novices, possibly as experts tend to use more idiosyncratic criteria when judging artworks.<ref name=Silvia-expertise /> However, experts seem to use the same appraisals of emotions that novices do, but these appraisals are at a higher level, because a wider range of art is comprehensible to experts.<ref name=Silvia-expertise />\n\n====Expertise and museum visits====\nDue to most art being in museums and galleries, most people have to make deliberate choices to interact with art. Researchers are interested in what types of experiences and emotions people are looking for when going to experience art in a museum.<ref name=Mastandera-muesum>{{cite journal|last=Mastandrea|first=Stefano|author2=Bartoli, G.|author3=Bove, G.|title=Learning through ancient art and experincing emotions with contemporary art: Comparing visits in two different museums|journal=Empirical Studies of the Arts|year=2007|volume=25|issue=2|pages=173\u2013191|doi=10.2190/r784-4504-37m3-2370}}</ref> Most people respond that they visit museums to experience 'the pleasure of art' or 'the desire for cultural learning', but when broken down, visitors of museums of classical art are more motivated to see famous works and learn more about them.<ref name=Mastandera-muesum /> Visitors in contemporary art museums were more motivated by a more emotional connection to the art, and went more for the pleasure than a learning experience.<ref name=Mastandera-muesum /> Predictors of who would prefer to go to which type of museum lay in education level, art fluency, an socio-economic status.<ref name=Mastandera-muesum />\n\n==Theories and models of elicited emotions==\nResearchers have offered a number of theories to describe emotional responses to art, often aligning with the various theories of the basis of emotions. Authors have argued that the emotional experience is created explicitly by the artist and mimicked in the viewer, or that the emotional experience of art is a by-product of the analysis of that work.<ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /><ref name=Fellous-review />\n\n===Appraisal theory===\nThe [[appraisal theory]] of emotions centers on the assumption that it is the evaluation of events, and not the events themselves, that cause emotional experiences.<ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /> Emotions are then created by different groups of appraisal structures that events are analyzed through.<ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /> When applied to art, appraisal theories argue that various artistic structures, such as complexity, prototypically, and understanding are used as appraisal structures, and works that show more typical art principles will create a stronger aesthetic experience .<ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /> Appraisal theories suggest that art is experienced as interesting after being analyzed through a novelty check and coping-potential check, which analyze the art's newness of experience for the viewer, and the viewer's ability to understand the new experience.<ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /> Experimental evidence suggests that art is preferred when the viewer finds it easier to understand, and that interest in a work is predictable with knowledge of the viewer's ability to process complex visual works, which supports the appraisal theory.<ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /> People with higher levels of artistic expertise and knowledge often prefer more complex works of art. Under appraisal theory, experts have a different emotional experience to art due to a preference for more complex works that they can understand better than a naive viewer.<ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart />\n\n====Appraisal and negative emotions====\nA newer take on this theory focuses on the consequences of the emotions elicited from art, both positive and negative. The original theory argues that positive emotions are the result of a biobehavioral reward system, where a person feels a positive emotion when they have completed a personal goal.<ref name=cooper-opposingart>{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Jessica M.|author2=Paul J. Silvia|title=Opposing art: Rejection as an action tendency of hostile aesthetic emotions|journal=Empirical Studies of the Arts|year=2009|volume=27|issue=1|pages=109\u2013126|doi=10.2190/em.27.1.f}}</ref> These emotional rewards create actions by motivating approach or withdrawal from a stimuli, depending if the object is positive or negative to the person.<ref name=cooper-opposingart /> However, these theories have not often focused on negative emotions, especially negative emotional experiences from art.<ref name=cooper-opposingart /> These emotions are central to experimental aesthetics research in order to understand why people have negative, rejecting, condemning, or censoring reactions to works of art.<ref name=cooper-opposingart /> By showing research participants controversial photographs, rating their feelings of anger, and measuring their subsequent actions, researchers found that the participants that felt hostile toward the photographs displayed more rejection of the works.<ref name=cooper-opposingart /> This suggests that negative emotions towards a work of art can create a negative action toward it, and suggests the need for further research on negative reactions towards art.<ref name=cooper-opposingart />\n\n===Minimal model===\nOther psychologists believe that emotions are of minimal functionality, and are used to move a person towards incentives and away from threats.<ref name=Xenakis-functionalrole>{{cite journal|last=Xenakis|first=Ioannis|author2=Arnellos, Argyris|author3= Darzentas, John|title=The functional role of emotions in aesthetic judgment|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|date=1 August 2012|volume=30|issue=2|pages=212\u2013226|doi=10.1016/j.newideapsych.2011.09.003}}</ref> Therefore, positive emotions are felt upon the attainment of a goal, and negative emotions when a goal has failed to be achieved.<ref name=Xenakis-functionalrole />   The basic states of pleasure or pain can be adapted to aesthetic experiences by a disinterested buffer, where the experience is not explicitly related to the goal-reaching of the person, but a similar experience can be analyzed from a disinterested distance.<ref name=Xenakis-functionalrole /> These emotions are disinterested because the work of art or artist's goals are not affecting the person's well being, but the viewer can feel whether or not those goals were achieved from a third-party distance.\n\n===Five-step aesthetic experience===\nOther theorists have focused their models on the disrupting and unique experience that comes from the interacting with a powerful work of art. An early model focused on a two-part experience: facile recognition and meta-cognitive perception, or the experience of the work of art and the mind's analysis of that experience.<ref name=Pelowski-5part>{{cite journal|last=Pelowski|first=Matthew|author2=Akiba, Fuminori|title=A model of art perception, evaluation and emotion in transformative aesthetic experience|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|date=1 August 2011|volume=29|issue=2|pages=80\u201397|doi=10.1016/j.newideapsych.2010.04.001}}</ref> A further cognitive model strengthens this idea into a five-part emotional experience of a work of art.<ref name=Pelowski-5part /> As this five-part model is new, it remains only a theory, as not much empirical evidence for the model had been researched yet.\n\n====Part one: Pre-expectations and self-image====\nThe first stage of this model focuses on the viewer's expectations of the work before seeing it, based on their previous experiences, their observational strategies, and the relation of the work to themselves.<ref name=Pelowski-5part /> Viewers who tend to appreciate art, or know more about it will have different expectations at this stage than those who are not engaged by art.<ref name=Pelowski-5part />\n\n====Part two: Cognitive mastery and introduction of discrepancy ====\nAfter viewing the work of art, people will make an initial judgment and classification of the work,  often based on their preconceptions of the work.<ref name=Pelowski-5part /> After initial classification, viewers attempt to understand the motive and meaning of the work, which can then inform their perception of the work, creating a cycle of changing perception and the attempt to understand it.<ref name=Pelowski-5part /> It is at this point any discrepancies between expectations and the work, or the work and understanding arise.<ref name=Pelowski-5part />\n\n====Part three: Secondary control and escape====\nWhen an individual finds a discrepancy in their understanding that cannot be resolved or ignored, they move to the third stage of their interaction with a work of art.<ref name=Pelowski-5part /> At this point, interaction with the work has switched from lower-order and unconscious processes to higher-order cognitive involvement, and tension and frustration starts to be felt.<ref name=Pelowski-5part /> In order to maintain their self-assumptions and to resolve the work, an individual will try to change their environment in order for the issue to be resolved or ignored.<ref name=Pelowski-5part />  This can be done by re-classifying the work and its motives, blaming the discrepancy on an external source, or attempting to escape the situation or mentally withdraw from the work.<ref name=Pelowski-5part />\n\n====Part four: Meta-cognitive reassessment====\nIf viewers cannot escape or reassess the work, they are forced to reassess the self and their interactions with works of art.<ref name=Pelowski-5part />  This experience of self-awareness through a work of art is often externally caused, rather than internally motivated, and starts a transformative process to understand the meaning of the discrepant work, and edit their own self-image.<ref name=Pelowski-5part />\n\n====Part five: Aesthetic outcome and new mastery====\nAfter the self-transformation and change in expectations, the viewer resets their interaction with the work, and begins the process anew with deeper self-understanding and cognitive mastery of the artwork.<ref name=Pelowski-5part />\n\n==Pupillary response tests==\nIn order to research emotional responses to art, researchers often rely on behavioral data.<ref name=Leder-pupil>{{cite journal|last=Kuchinke|first=Lars|author2=Trapp, Sabrina|author3= Jacobs, Arthur M.|author4= Leder, Helmut|title=Pupillary responses in art appreciation: Effects of aesthetic emotions.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2009|volume=3|issue=3|pages=156\u2013163|doi=10.1037/a0014464}}</ref>  But new psychophysilogical methods of measuring emotional response are beginning to be used, such as the measurement of pupillary response.<ref name=Leder-pupil /> Pupil responses have been predicted to indicate image pleasantness and emotional arousal, but can be confounded by luminance, and confusion between an emotion's positive or negative valence, requiring an accompanying verbal explanation of emotional state.<ref name=Rembrandt>{{cite journal|last=Powell|first=W.

This may be because the portraits were viewed as domineering, and the subsequent pupil response was due to unpleasantness.<ref name=Rembrandt /> As pupil dilation is more indicative of strength of emotional response than the valence, a verbal description of emotional responses should accompany further pupillary response tests.<ref name=Rembrandt />\n\n==Art as emotional regulation==\nArt is also used as an emotional regulator, most often in [[Art Therapy]] sessions.

These predispositions lend themselves to responses when looking at certain visual arts as well. Identification of subject matter is the first step in understanding the visual image. Being presented with visual stimuli creates initial confusion. Being able to comprehend a figure and background creates closure and triggers the pleasure centers of the brain by remedying the confusion. Once an image is identified, meaning can be created by accessing memory relative to the visual stimuli and associating personal memories with what is being viewed.<ref name=\"barry\">{{cite journal | last1 = Barry | first1 = A | year = 2006 | title = Perceptual Aesthetics: Transcendent Emotion, Neurological Image | url = | journal = Visual Communication Quarterly | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 134\u2013151 | doi = 10.1207/s15551407vcq1303_2 }}</ref>\n\nOther methods of stimulating initial interest that can lead to emotion involves pattern recognition. [[Symmetry]] is often found in works of art, and the human brain unconsciously searches for symmetry for a number of reasons. Potential predators were [[Symmetry in biology|bilaterally symmetrical]], as were potential prey. Bilateral symmetry also exists in humans, and a healthy human is typically relatively symmetrical. This attraction to symmetry was therefore advantageous, as it helped humans recognize danger, food, and mates. Art containing symmetry therefore is typically approached and positively valenced to humans.<ref name=\"barry\" />\n\nAnother example is to observe paintings or photographs of bright, open landscapes that often evoke a feeling of beauty, [[Relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]], or happiness. This connection to pleasant emotions exists because it was advantageous to humans before today's society to be able to see far into the distance in a brightly lit vista. Similarly, visual images that are dark and/or obscure typically elicit emotions of [[anxiety]] and fear. This is because an impeded visual field is disadvantageous for a human to be able to defend itself.<ref name=\"carroll\">{{cite journal | last1 = Carroll | first1 = N | title = Art and Mood | year = 2003 | url = | journal = Monist | volume = 86 | issue = 4| pages = 521\u2013555 | doi=10.5840/monist200386426}}</ref>\n\n=== Meta-emotions ===\n{{Main|Meta-emotion}}\nThe optimal visual artwork creates what Noy & Noy-Sharav call \"meta-emotions\". These are multiple emotions that are triggered at the same time. They posit that what people see when immediately looking at a piece of artwork are the formal, technical qualities of the work and its complexity. Works that are well-made but lacking in appropriate complexity, or works that are intricate but missing in technical skill will not produce \"meta-emotions\".<ref name=\"noy\">{{cite journal | last1 = Noy | first1 = P. | last2 = Noy-Sharav | first2 = D. | year = 2013 | title = Art and Emotions | url = | journal = International Journal of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 100\u2013107 | doi = 10.1002/aps.1352 }}</ref> For example, seeing a perfectly painted chair (technical quality but no complexity) or a sloppily drawn image of [[Christ]] on the cross (complex but no skill) would be unlikely to stimulate deep emotional responses. However, beautifully painted works of Christ's [[crucifixion]] are likely make people who can relate or who understand the story behind it weep.\n\nNoy & Noy-Sharav also claim that art is the most potent form of emotional communication. They cite examples of people being able to listen to and [[dance]] to [[music]] for hours without getting tired and literature being able to take people to far away, imagined lands inside their heads. Art forms give humans a higher satisfaction in emotional release than simply managing emotions on their own. Art allows people to have a cathartic release of pent-up emotions either by creating work or by witnessing and pseudo-experiencing what they see in front of them. Instead of being passive recipients of actions and images, art is intended for people to challenge themselves and work through the emotions they see presented in the artistic message.<ref name=\"noy\" />\n\n==Types of elicited emotions==\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = Art is a human activity, consisting in this, that one man consciously, by means of certain external signs, hands on to others feelings he has lived through, and that other people are infected by these feeling and also experience them.\n |source = --[[Leo Tolstoy]], ''[[What Is Art?]]'' (1897)<ref name=\"Maude1902\">{{cite book|last=Maude|first=Aylmer|title=Essays on art: I.

#c6dbf7\n}}\n\n===Knowledge emotions===\nKnowledge emotions deal with reactions to thinking and feeling, such as interest, confusion, and surprise.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /> They often stem from self-analysis of what the viewer knows, expects, and perceives.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /><ref name=Silvia-confusion /> This set of emotions also spur actions that motivate further learning and thinking.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure />\n\n====Interest====\nInterest in a work of art arises from perceiving the work as new, complex, and unfamiliar, as well as understandable.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /><ref name=Silvia-confusion /> This dimension is studied most often by aesthetics researchers, and can be equated with aesthetic pleasure or an aesthetic experience.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /> This stage of art experience usually occurs as the viewer understands the artwork they are viewing, and the art fits into their knowledge and expectations while providing a new experience.<ref name=Silvia-confusion />\n\n====Confusion====\nConfusion can be viewed as an opposite to interest, and serves as a signal to the self to inform the viewer that they cannot comprehend what they are looking at, and confusion often necessitates a shift in action to remedy the lack of understanding.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /><ref name=Silvia-confusion>{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|title=Confusion and interest: The role of knowledge emotions in aesthetic experience.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2010|volume=4|issue=2|pages=75\u201380|doi=10.1037/a0017081|url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/P_Silvia_Confusion_in%20press.pdf}}</ref> Confusion is thought to stem from uncertainty, and a lack of one's expectations and knowledge being met by a work of art.<ref name=Silvia-confusion /> \nConfusion is most often experienced by art novices, and therefore must often be dealt with by those in arts education.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure />\n\n====Surprise====\nSurprise functions as a disruption of current action to alert a viewer to a significant event.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /> The emotion is centered around the experience of something new and unexpected, and can be ellicied by sensory incongruity.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /> Art can ellicit surprise when expectations about the work are not met, but the work changes those expectations in an understandable way.\n\n===Hostile emotions===\nHostile emotions toward art are often very visible in the form of anger or frustration, and can result in censorship, but are less easily described by a continuum of aesthetic pleasure-displeasure.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /> These reactions center around the hostility triad: anger, disgust, and contempt.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure />  These emotions often motivate aggression, self-assertion, and violence, and arise from perception of the artist's deliberate trespass onto the expectations of the viewer.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure />\n\n===Self-conscious emotions===\nSelf-conscious emotions are responses that reflect upon the self and one's actions, such as pride, guilt, shame, regret and embarrassment.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /> These are much more complex emotions, and involve assessing events as agreeing with one's self-perception or not, and adjusting one's behavior accordingly.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /> There are numerous instances of artists expressing self-conscious emotions in response to their art, and self-conscious emotions can also be felt collectively.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure />\n\n====Sublime feelings====\nResearchers have investigated the experience of the sublime, viewed as similar to aesthetic appreciation, which causes general psychological arousal.<ref name=Eskine-sublime>{{cite journal|last=Eskine|first=Kendall J.|author2=Kacinik, Natalie A.|author3= Prinz, Jesse J.|title=Stirring images: Fear, not happiness or arousal, makes art more sublime.|journal=Emotion|date=1 January 2012|volume=12|issue=5|pages=1071\u20131074|doi=10.1037/a0027200}}</ref> The sublime feeling has been connected to a feeling of happiness in response to art, but may be more related to an experience of fear.<ref name=Eskine-sublime /> Researchers have shown that feelings of fear induced before looking at artwork results in more sublime feelings in response to those works.<ref name=Eskine-sublime />\n\n====Aesthetic chills====\n{{Main|Aesthetic chills}}\nAnother common emotional response is that of chills when viewing a work of art. The feeling is predicted to be related to similar aesthetic experiences such as awe, feeling touched, or absorption.<ref name=Silvia-chills>{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|author2=Nusbaum, Emily C.|title=On personality and piloerection: Individual differences in aesthetic chills and other unusual aesthetic experiences.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2011|volume=5|issue=3|pages=208\u2013214|doi=10.1037/a0021914|url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/P_Silvia_Personality_2011.pdf}}</ref> Personality traits along the Big 5 Inventory have been shown to be predictors of a person's experience of aesthetic chills, especially a high rating on Openness to Experience.<ref name=Silvia-chills /> This counters the effect of fluid intelligence, where those with higher amounts of fluid intelligence are less likely to experience chills.<ref name=Silvia-chills /> Experience with the arts also predicts someone's experience of aesthetic chills, but this may be due to them experiencing art more frequently.<ref name=Silvia-chills />\n\n===Effects of expertise===\nThe fact that art is analyzed and experienced differently by those with artistic training and expertise than those who are artistically naive has been shown numerous times. Researchers have tried to understand how experts interact with art so differently from the art naive, as experts tend to like more abstract compositions, and show a greater liking for both modern and classical types of art.<ref name=Leder-appreciated>{{cite journal|last=Leder|first=Helmut|author2=Gerger, Gernot|author3= Dressler, Stefan G.|author4= Schabmann, Alfred|title=How art is appreciated.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2012|volume=6|issue=1|pages=2\u201310|doi=10.1037/a0026396}}</ref> Experts also exhibit more arousal when looking at modern and abstract works, while non-experts show more arousal to classical works.<ref name=Leder-appreciated />\n\nOther researchers predicted that experts find more complex art interesting because they have changed their appraisals of art to create more interest, or are possibly making completely different types of appraisals than novices.<ref name=Silvia-expertise>{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|title=Artistic training and interest in visual art: Applying the appraisal model of aesthetic emotions|journal=Empirical Studies of the Arts|year=2006|volume=24|issue=2|pages=139\u2013161|doi=10.2190/dx8k-6wea-6wpa-fm84}}</ref> Experts described works rated high in complexity as easier to understand and more interesting than did novices, possibly as experts tend to use more idiosyncratic criteria when judging artworks.<ref name=Silvia-expertise /> However, experts seem to use the same appraisals of emotions that novices do, but these appraisals are at a higher level, because a wider range of art is comprehensible to experts.<ref name=Silvia-expertise />\n\n====Expertise and museum visits====\nDue to most art being in museums and galleries, most people have to make deliberate choices to interact with art. Researchers are interested in what types of experiences and emotions people are looking for when going to experience art in a museum.<ref name=Mastandera-muesum>{{cite journal|last=Mastandrea|first=Stefano|author2=Bartoli, G.|author3=Bove, G.|title=Learning through ancient art and experincing emotions with contemporary art: Comparing visits in two different museums|journal=Empirical Studies of the Arts|year=2007|volume=25|issue=2|pages=173\u2013191|doi=10.2190/r784-4504-37m3-2370}}</ref> Most people respond that they visit museums to experience 'the pleasure of art' or 'the desire for cultural learning', but when broken down, visitors of museums of classical art are more motivated to see famous works and learn more about them.<ref name=Mastandera-muesum /> Visitors in contemporary art museums were more motivated by a more emotional connection to the art, and went more for the pleasure than a learning experience.<ref name=Mastandera-muesum /> Predictors of who would prefer to go to which type of museum lay in education level, art fluency, an socio-economic status.<ref name=Mastandera-muesum />\n\n==Theories and models of elicited emotions==\nResearchers have offered a number of theories to describe emotional responses to art, often aligning with the various theories of the basis of emotions. Authors have argued that the emotional experience is created explicitly by the artist and mimicked in the viewer, or that the emotional experience of art is a by-product of the analysis of that work.<ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /><ref name=Fellous-review />\n\n===Appraisal theory===\nThe [[appraisal theory]] of emotions centers on the assumption that it is the evaluation of events, and not the events themselves, that cause emotional experiences.<ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /> Emotions are then created by different groups of appraisal structures that events are analyzed through.<ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /> When applied to art, appraisal theories argue that various artistic structures, such as complexity, prototypically, and understanding are used as appraisal structures, and works that show more typical art principles will create a stronger aesthetic experience .<ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /> Appraisal theories suggest that art is experienced as interesting after being analyzed through a novelty check and coping-potential check, which analyze the art's newness of experience for the viewer, and the viewer's ability to understand the new experience.<ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /> Experimental evidence suggests that art is preferred when the viewer finds it easier to understand, and that interest in a work is predictable with knowledge of the viewer's ability to process complex visual works, which supports the appraisal theory.<ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /> People with higher levels of artistic expertise and knowledge often prefer more complex works of art. Under appraisal theory, experts have a different emotional experience to art due to a preference for more complex works that they can understand better than a naive viewer.<ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart />\n\n====Appraisal and negative emotions====\nA newer take on this theory focuses on the consequences of the emotions elicited from art, both positive and negative. The original theory argues that positive emotions are the result of a biobehavioral reward system, where a person feels a positive emotion when they have completed a personal goal.<ref name=cooper-opposingart>{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Jessica M.|author2=Paul J. Silvia|title=Opposing art: Rejection as an action tendency of hostile aesthetic emotions|journal=Empirical Studies of the Arts|year=2009|volume=27|issue=1|pages=109\u2013126|doi=10.2190/em.27.1.f}}</ref> These emotional rewards create actions by motivating approach or withdrawal from a stimuli, depending if the object is positive or negative to the person.<ref name=cooper-opposingart /> However, these theories have not often focused on negative emotions, especially negative emotional experiences from art.<ref name=cooper-opposingart /> These emotions are central to experimental aesthetics research in order to understand why people have negative, rejecting, condemning, or censoring reactions to works of art.<ref name=cooper-opposingart /> By showing research participants controversial photographs, rating their feelings of anger, and measuring their subsequent actions, researchers found that the participants that felt hostile toward the photographs displayed more rejection of the works.<ref name=cooper-opposingart /> This suggests that negative emotions towards a work of art can create a negative action toward it, and suggests the need for further research on negative reactions towards art.<ref name=cooper-opposingart />\n\n===Minimal model===\nOther psychologists believe that emotions are of minimal functionality, and are used to move a person towards incentives and away from threats.<ref name=Xenakis-functionalrole>{{cite journal|last=Xenakis|first=Ioannis|author2=Arnellos, Argyris|author3= Darzentas, John|title=The functional role of emotions in aesthetic judgment|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|date=1 August 2012|volume=30|issue=2|pages=212\u2013226|doi=10.1016/j.newideapsych.2011.09.003}}</ref> Therefore, positive emotions are felt upon the attainment of a goal, and negative emotions when a goal has failed to be achieved.<ref name=Xenakis-functionalrole />   The basic states of pleasure or pain can be adapted to aesthetic experiences by a disinterested buffer, where the experience is not explicitly related to the goal-reaching of the person, but a similar experience can be analyzed from a disinterested distance.<ref name=Xenakis-functionalrole /> These emotions are disinterested because the work of art or artist's goals are not affecting the person's well being, but the viewer can feel whether or not those goals were achieved from a third-party distance.\n\n===Five-step aesthetic experience===\nOther theorists have focused their models on the disrupting and unique experience that comes from the interacting with a powerful work of art. An early model focused on a two-part experience: facile recognition and meta-cognitive perception, or the experience of the work of art and the mind's analysis of that experience.<ref name=Pelowski-5part>{{cite journal|last=Pelowski|first=Matthew|author2=Akiba, Fuminori|title=A model of art perception, evaluation and emotion in transformative aesthetic experience|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|date=1 August 2011|volume=29|issue=2|pages=80\u201397|doi=10.1016/j.newideapsych.2010.04.001}}</ref> A further cognitive model strengthens this idea into a five-part emotional experience of a work of art.<ref name=Pelowski-5part /> As this five-part model is new, it remains only a theory, as not much empirical evidence for the model had been researched yet.\n\n====Part one: Pre-expectations and self-image====\nThe first stage of this model focuses on the viewer's expectations of the work before seeing it, based on their previous experiences, their observational strategies, and the relation of the work to themselves.<ref name=Pelowski-5part /> Viewers who tend to appreciate art, or know more about it will have different expectations at this stage than those who are not engaged by art.<ref name=Pelowski-5part />\n\n====Part two: Cognitive mastery and introduction of discrepancy ====\nAfter viewing the work of art, people will make an initial judgment and classification of the work,  often based on their preconceptions of the work.<ref name=Pelowski-5part /> After initial classification, viewers attempt to understand the motive and meaning of the work, which can then inform their perception of the work, creating a cycle of changing perception and the attempt to understand it.<ref name=Pelowski-5part /> It is at this point any discrepancies between expectations and the work, or the work and understanding arise.<ref name=Pelowski-5part />\n\n====Part three: Secondary control and escape====\nWhen an individual finds a discrepancy in their understanding that cannot be resolved or ignored, they move to the third stage of their interaction with a work of art.<ref name=Pelowski-5part /> At this point, interaction with the work has switched from lower-order and unconscious processes to higher-order cognitive involvement, and tension and frustration starts to be felt.<ref name=Pelowski-5part /> In order to maintain their self-assumptions and to resolve the work, an individual will try to change their environment in order for the issue to be resolved or ignored.<ref name=Pelowski-5part />  This can be done by re-classifying the work and its motives, blaming the discrepancy on an external source, or attempting to escape the situation or mentally withdraw from the work.<ref name=Pelowski-5part />\n\n====Part four: Meta-cognitive reassessment====\nIf viewers cannot escape or reassess the work, they are forced to reassess the self and their interactions with works of art.<ref name=Pelowski-5part />  This experience of self-awareness through a work of art is often externally caused, rather than internally motivated, and starts a transformative process to understand the meaning of the discrepant work, and edit their own self-image.<ref name=Pelowski-5part />\n\n====Part five: Aesthetic outcome and new mastery====\nAfter the self-transformation and change in expectations, the viewer resets their interaction with the work, and begins the process anew with deeper self-understanding and cognitive mastery of the artwork.<ref name=Pelowski-5part />\n\n==Pupillary response tests==\nIn order to research emotional responses to art, researchers often rely on behavioral data.<ref name=Leder-pupil>{{cite journal|last=Kuchinke|first=Lars|author2=Trapp, Sabrina|author3= Jacobs, Arthur M.|author4= Leder, Helmut|title=Pupillary responses in art appreciation: Effects of aesthetic emotions.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2009|volume=3|issue=3|pages=156\u2013163|doi=10.1037/a0014464}}</ref>  But new psychophysilogical methods of measuring emotional response are beginning to be used, such as the measurement of pupillary response.<ref name=Leder-pupil /> Pupil responses have been predicted to indicate image pleasantness and emotional arousal, but can be confounded by luminance, and confusion between an emotion's positive or negative valence, requiring an accompanying verbal explanation of emotional state.<ref name=Rembrandt>{{cite journal|last=Powell|first=W. Ryan|author2=Schirillo, James A.|title=Hemispheric laterality measured in Rembrandt's portraits using pupil diameter and aesthetic verbal judgements|journal=Cognition & Emotion|date=1 August 2011|volume=25|issue=5|pages=868\u2013885|doi=10.1080/02699931.2010.515709|pmid=21432647}}</ref> Pupil dilatations have been found to predict emotional responses and the amount of information the brain is processing, measures important in testing emotional response ellicted by artwork.<ref name=Leder-pupil /> Further, the existence of pupillary responses to artwork can be used as an argument that art does ellicit emotional responses with physiological reactions.<ref name=Leder-pupil /> \n[[File:Juan Gris 004.jpg|thumb|An example Cubist work by Juan Gris]]\n\n===Pupil responses to art===\nAfter viewing Cubist paintings of varying complexity, abstraction, and familiarity, participants' pupil responses were greatest when viewing aesthetically pleasing artwork, and highly accessible art, or art low in abstraction.<ref name=Leder-pupil /> Pupil responses also correlated with personal preferences of the cubist art.<ref name=Leder-pupil /> High pupil responses were also correlated with faster cognitive processing, supporting theories that aesthetic emotions and preferences are related to the brain's ease of processing the stimuli.<ref name=Leder-pupil />\n\n====Left-cheek biases====\n[[File:Rembrandt - Minerva - WGA19246.jpg|thumb|''Minerva'' Rembrandt. Female portrait showing left-cheek orientation]]\nThese effects are also seen when investigating the Western preference for left-facing portraits. This skew towards left-cheek is found in the majority of Western portraits, and is rated as more pleasing than other portrait orientations.<ref name=Blackburn-pupil>{{cite journal|last=Blackburn|first=Kelsey|author2=Schirillo, James|title=Emotive hemispheric differences measured in real-life portraits using pupil diameter and subjective aesthetic preferences|journal=Experimental Brain Research|date=19 April 2012|volume=219|issue=4|pages=447\u2013455|doi=10.1007/s00221-012-3091-y|pmid=22526951}}</ref> Theories for this preference suggest that the left side of the face as more emotionally descriptive and expressive, which lets viewers connect to this emotional content better.<ref name=Blackburn-pupil /> Pupil response tests were used to test emotional response to different types of portraits, left or right cheek, and pupil dilation was linearly related to the pleasantness of the portrait, with increased dilations for pleasant images, and constrictions for unpleasant images.<ref name=Blackburn-pupil /> Left-facing portraits were rated as more pleasant, even when mirrored to appear right-facing, suggesting that people are more attracted to more emotional facial depictions.<ref name=Blackburn-pupil />\n\nThis research was continued, using portraits by [[Rembrandt]] featuring females with a left-cheek focus and males with a right-cheek focus.<ref name=Rembrandt />  Researchers predicted Rembrandt chose to portray his subjects this way to elicit different emotional responses in his viewers related to which portrait cheek was favored.<ref name=Rembrandt /> In comparison to previous studies, increased pupil size was only found for male portraits with a right-cheek preference. This may be because the portraits were viewed as domineering, and the subsequent pupil response was due to unpleasantness.<ref name=Rembrandt /> As pupil dilation is more indicative of strength of emotional response than the valence, a verbal description of emotional responses should accompany further pupillary response tests.<ref name=Rembrandt />\n\n==Art as emotional regulation==\nArt is also used as an emotional regulator, most often in [[Art Therapy]] sessions. Studies have shown that creating art can serve as a method of short-term [[mood (psychology)|mood]] regulation.<ref name=Drake-venting>{{cite journal|last=Drake|first=Jennifer E.|author2=Winner, Ellen|title=Confronting sadness through art-making: Distraction is more beneficial than venting.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2012|volume=6|issue=3|pages=255\u2013261|doi=10.1037/a0026909|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f91b7cd8bbc586fc9cc71b03bc97fe7ca7fb76c1}}</ref><ref name=Dalebroux-venting>{{cite journal|last=Dalebroux|first=Anne|author2=Goldstein, Thalia R.|author3= Winner, Ellen|title=Short-term mood repair through art-making: Positive emotion is more effective than venting|journal=Motivation and Emotion|volume=32|issue=4|pages=288\u2013295|doi=10.1007/s11031-008-9105-1|year=2008}}</ref> This type of regulation falls into two categories: venting and distraction.<ref name=Drake-venting /> Artists in all fields of the arts have reported emotional venting and distraction through the creation of their art.<ref name=Drake-venting /><ref name=Dalebroux-venting />\n\n===Venting===\nVenting through art is the process of using art to attend to and discharge negative emotions.<ref name=Drake-venting /> However, research has shown venting to be a less effective method of emotional regulation. Research participants asked to draw either an image related to a sad movie they just watched, or a neutral house, demonstrated less negative mood after the neutral drawing.<ref name=Drake-venting /> Venting drawings did improve negative mood more than no drawing activity.<ref name=Drake-venting /> Other research suggests that this is because analyzing negative emotions can have a helpful effect, but immersing in negative emotions can have a deleterious effect.<ref name=Dalebroux-venting />\n\n===Distraction===\nDistraction is the process of creating art to oppose, or in spite of negative emotions.<ref name=Drake-venting /> This can also take the form of fantasizing, or creating an opposing positive to counteract a negative affect.<ref name=Dalebroux-venting /> Research has demonstrated that distractive art making activities improve mood greater than venting activities.<ref name=Drake-venting /> Distractive drawings were shown to decrease negative emotions more than venting drawings or no drawing task even after participants were asked to recall their saddest personal memories.<ref name=Drake-venting /> These participants also experienced an increase in positive affect after a distractive drawing task.<ref name=Drake-venting /> The change in mood valence after a distractive drawing task is even greater when participants are asked to create happy drawings to counter their negative mood.<ref name=Dalebroux-venting />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Emotionalism (disorder)|Emotionalism]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite IEP |url-id=art-emot |title=Art and Emotion}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Ducasse|first=C.
