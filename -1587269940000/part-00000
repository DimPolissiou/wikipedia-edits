Dayton Ballet seasons typically comprises four works\u2014familiar traditional ballets, such as ''The Nutcracker'', as well as new and innovative works\u2014and over 40 performances.\n\nThe Dayton Ballet performs in the historic 1,139-seat Victoria Theatre and the 2,300-seat Schuster Center.\n\nPart of the [[Dayton Performing Arts Alliance]], which also oversees the Dayton Opera and the Dayton Philharmonic, the Ballet receives administrative and operational leadership and support from its parent organization. Karen Russo Burke has been the Artistic Director of the Dayton Ballet since 2011.\n\n==History==\n\nDayton Ballet had its beginning when Josephine (Jo) Schwarz and her sister Hermene opened The Schwarz School of Dance in 1927. Jo Schwarz later studied ballet and danced in Chicago, in New York at the School of American Ballet, and in Europe. She danced on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], but was forced to return home to Dayton after being injured while performing there. In May 1938, Jo and Hermene gathered together the school's finest dancers, named the troupe \"The Experimental Group for Young Dancers,\" and staged a performance at the [[Dayton Art Institute]]. This was the first performance of what is now the Dayton Ballet.\n\nJo was a pioneer of the American regional ballet movement of the mid-20th century. Through years of persistence, she made Dayton a center of dance. In 1958, the company restructured as the Dayton Civic Ballet, with a board of directors, and federal tax-exempt status. In 1959, the Dayton Civic Ballet became a chartered member of the Northeast Regional Ballet Association. The Schwarz sisters organized many regional dance festivals and choreography conferences.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E6DB173FF931A35750C0A9629C8B63| title= Josephine Schwarz, 95, Leader In Growth of Regional Ballets|accessdate=2011-01-01 | work=The New York Times|first=Jack|last=Anderson|date=2004-03-02}}</ref> In 1978, the company dropped the \"Civic\" designation and became the fully professional Dayton Ballet.\n\n===1980\u20131990===\nStuart Sebastian, a student of Josephine and Hermene Schwarz, assumed directorship of the company in 1980 at the invitation of Josephine Schwarz. He had danced professionally for the Dayton Ballet and the National Ballet of Washington before assuming the role. He had also choreographed in New York, Germany and England.<ref name=NYT/>  Sebastian led the Dayton Ballet for 10 years, in which time the company rose in stature and status. \n\nSebastian brought in new dancers and created the company's first full-length ballet, ''The Sleeping Beauty''.  He choreographed over 25 new works.  Of those, six were full-length ballets, including Swan Lake and Dracula. Under Sebastian, the Dayton Ballet toured more than 75 cities and took its first international tour to Jerash, Jordan.  In 1988, the company appeared on national television while performing in the opening ceremonies of the [[1987 Pan American Games|Pan American Games]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tV3CKGuGoRkC&pg=PT243&lpg=PT243&dq=dayton+ballet+pan+american+games&source=bl&ots=c-EPKDXr3O&sig=4keiRS62DiKjfFgexl5Qtr1Eqhc&hl=en&ei=wAEgTfX8Hoep8Aas4umODg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=dayton%20ballet%20pan%20american%20games&f=false| title= profiles of Ohio women 1803-2003|accessdate=2011-01-01}}</ref>\n\n===Transition: 1991-1993===\nFollowing the departure of Stuart Sebastian in 1990 and his subsequent death in January 1991 after a lengthy battle with AIDS,<ref name=NYT/> the company entered a period of transition. James Clouser, former artistic director of the [[Houston Ballet]], was brought in on a three year contract. It was a bumpy and tumultuous time for the company, and a time of considerable change. Clouser was the first outside, non-Daytonian director, the Dayton Ballet had ever seen, and was a considerable break from the company's past directors. Many dancers and staff from the previous era left, and many new dancers and staff were hired. According to ''[[Dayton Daily News]]'' articles written during the transition, the board of trustees was looking for change and that is why they brought in someone from the outside. In the fall of 1992 an executive director was brought in for the very first time in the company's history: Dermot Burke.\n\n===Recent history: 1993\u20132012===\nDermot Burke was a star principal dancer with the [[Joffrey Ballet]] in New York and had been artistic director of the [[American Repertory Ballet]] in New Jersey for 10 years. He knew and choreographed for Sebastian and the Dayton Ballet back in 1984. In the Fall of 1993 Dermot assumed the dual role of executive and artistic director of the company.\n\nUnder Dermot Burke, the company took on a more American flavor in the tradition of the [[Joffrey Ballet]], embracing distinctly American dance literature, dancers and choreographers. There was also a shift to a \"repertory company with lots of choreographic voices,\" as Burke stated. This repertory includes and has held onto the work of Sebastian and the company's past, while at the same time including the work of outside choreographers.\n\n===2012 merger===\nFollowing more than two years of planning, the Dayton Ballet, [[Dayton Opera]], and [[Dayton Philharmonic Orchestra]]\u2014Dayton\u2019s three classical performing arts organizations\u2014became a new, single entity on July 1, 2012. This new organization was named the Dayton Performing Arts Alliance. It is the largest performing arts organization in the community. [[Dayton Performing Arts Alliance]] performances are made possible in part by Montgomery County and Culture Works. The organization also receives partial funding from the [[Ohio Arts Council]].\n\nThe new organization has one administrative and operational core with one CEO and executive director, with each performing arts unit retaining its own artistic director.\n\n==Dayton Ballet School==\nThe company's dependent dance school, Dayton Ballet School, is the oldest [[dance school]] in Dayton and one of the oldest in the US.

It consisted of an introductory chapter with delusional quotes and some passages of his life \u2015 where he mixes popular characters and celebrities from the culture of Lima. The final chapter contained some of his drawings and some art critiques of his sculptures.\n\nIn 2000, Poggi participated in the filming of the movie ''My Nude Crime''\"(''Mi Crimen Al Desnudo''\"), by Le\u00f3nidas Zegarra, in which he played himself. The film was released in 2001. The project began in 1998, when a group of film students wanted to bring to the big screen the story of the murder of the serial criminal Angel D\u00edaz Balb\u00edn at the hands of psychologist Mario Poggi. Zegarra was invited to participate in the project as the director. The film's production was financed mainly by loans. The equipment needed was acquired in agreement with a production company. The budget, like in every movie by Zegarra, was  just $11.000 (equivalent to $16,388.72 as of 2019). Because of that, according to Zegarra, they came to an agreement with the actors and actresses (Mario Poggi, Am\u00e9rico Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, Yesabella, Rossi War, V\u00edctor \u00c1ngeles y Wilmer Ato) to pay them when the movie was commercialized, and when they retrieved the money invested.

Together these institutions have a combined enrollment of more than 70,000 students annually, creating both economic and social effects.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Leon County}}\nOriginally part of [[Escambia County, Florida|Escambia]] and later [[Gadsden County, Florida|Gadsden County]], Leon County was created in 1824.<ref>{{cite book|title=Publications of the Florida Historical Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WZQ-AAAAYAAJ&pg=RA2-PA32|year=1908|publisher=Florida Historical Society.|page=32}}</ref> It was named after [[Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n]], the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[List of explorers|explorer]] who was the first [[Europe]]an to reach Florida.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gannett|first=Henry|title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA185|year=1905|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=185}}</ref>\n\nThe United States finally acquired this territory in the nineteenth century. In the 1830s, it attempted to conduct [[Indian Removal]] of the [[Seminole]] and [[Creek people]]s, who had migrated south to escape European-American encroachment in Georgia and Alabama. After many Seminole were forcibly removed from the area or moved south to the Everglades during the [[Seminole Wars]], planters developed cotton plantations based on enslaved labor.\n\nBy the 1850s and 1860s, Leon County had become part of the \"cotton kingdom\" of the Deep South. It ranked fifth of all [[Florida]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] counties in the production of cotton from the 20 major plantations. Uniquely among Confederate capitals east of the [[Mississippi River]], in the [[American Civil War]] Tallahassee was never captured by Union forces. No Union soldiers set foot in Leon County until the [[Reconstruction Era]].\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|702|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|667|sqmi}} are land and {{convert|35|sqmi}} (5.0%) are water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Unlike much of Florida, most of Leon County has rolling hills, part of north Florida's [[Red Hills Region]].

On November 17, 1978, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe Carnegie Library of Tallahassee, which only served the black community, became the only free public library in the city until 1955.  According to the Leon County Public Library's website, the American Association of University Women formed the Friends of the Library organization in 1954.  The formation of the Friends of the Library was in direct response to the fact that \"Tallahassee was the only state capital in the United States not offering free public library service.\" <ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\">Leon County. (2002-2016). Library History. Retrieved April 9, 2018, from Leon County Florida Government: http://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/Library/LibraryInformation/Library-History</ref>  One year later, the library was established in May by legislative action and was developed by citizens and civic groups.  In 1956 the first Leon County free public library opened on March 21.  The first building used to house the library was The Columns, one of the  oldest remaining antebellum homes in the Leon County area located at Park Avenue and Adams street (the building today is home of the James Madison Institute).\n\nIn order to expand library services, the Junior League of Tallahassee donated a [[bookmobile]] to the library. The vehicle was later donated to the Leon County Sheriff's Office to be used as a paddy wagon for its Road Prison.\nIn 1962, the library moved to the old Elks Club building at 127 North Monroe Street. Public transit in the city of Tallahassee had been desegregated by 1958, yet it would be several more years before the public library system would experience integration.\n\nIn the early 70's, Jefferson and Wakulla counties joined the Leon County Public Library System, forming the Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla County Public Library System. According to the library's web site, \"Leon County provided administrative and other services to the two smaller counties, while each supported the direct costs of their library services and their share of Leon's administrative costs.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  In 1975 the system started a branch library in the Bond community, a predominantly black community on the city's Southside. Wakulla County left the library cooperative in 1975 to start its own library system and in 1978 the main library moved to a location in Tallahassee's Northwood Mall.  Jefferson County left the library cooperative in 1980 and the library reverted to the Leon County Public Library.  In 1989 \"ground breaking was held on March 4 for a new $8.5 million main library facility with 88,000 feet of space. The site was next door to the library's original home, The Columns, which had been moved in 1971 to 100 N. Duval.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  The new library had its grand opening in 1991 and was renamed in 1993 in honor of former Governor LeRoy Collins.\n\n==Points of interest==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Alfred B.

In the 1830s, it attempted to conduct [[Indian Removal]] of the [[Seminole]] and [[Creek people]]s, who had migrated south to escape European-American encroachment in Georgia and Alabama. After many Seminole were forcibly removed from the area or moved south to the Everglades during the [[Seminole Wars]], planters developed cotton plantations based on enslaved labor.\n\nBy the 1850s and 1860s, Leon County had become part of the \"cotton kingdom\" of the Deep South. It ranked fifth of all [[Florida]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] counties in the production of cotton from the 20 major plantations. Uniquely among Confederate capitals east of the [[Mississippi River]], in the [[American Civil War]] Tallahassee was never captured by Union forces.

This library was the first and only public library in the city of Tallahassee until 1955.  The philanthropist, Andrew Carnegie offered the city of Tallahassee money to build a public library in 1906. According to an article written in Africology: The Journal of Pan African Studies, The library was built on the campus of Florida A&M University because the city refused the donation based on the fact that it would have to serve the black citizens.  \"The facility boasted modern amenities such as electricity, indoor plumbing and water supplied by the city. In later years, the Library served as an art gallery, religious center, and in 1976, became the founding home of the Black Archives Research Center and Museum. By functioning both as a repository for archival records and a museum for historical regalia, the center continues to render academic support to educational institutions, civic, political, religious and Museum.

On November 17, 1978, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe Carnegie Library of Tallahassee, which only served the black community, became the only free public library in the city until 1955.  According to the Leon County Public Library's website, the American Association of University Women formed the Friends of the Library organization in 1954.  The formation of the Friends of the Library was in direct response to the fact that \"Tallahassee was the only state capital in the United States not offering free public library service.\" <ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\">Leon County. (2002-2016). Library History. Retrieved April 9, 2018, from Leon County Florida Government: http://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/Library/LibraryInformation/Library-History</ref>  One year later, the library was established in May by legislative action and was developed by citizens and civic groups.  In 1956 the first Leon County free public library opened on March 21.  The first building used to house the library was The Columns, one of the  oldest remaining antebellum homes in the Leon County area located at Park Avenue and Adams street (the building today is home of the James Madison Institute).\n\nIn order to expand library services, the Junior League of Tallahassee donated a bookmobile to the library. The vehicle was later donated to the Leon County Sheriff's Office to be used as a paddy wagon for its Road Prison.\nIn 1962 the library moved to the old Elks Club building at 127 North Monroe Street. Public transit in the city of Tallahassee was desegregated by 1958, yet it would several more years before the public library system would experience integration.\n\nIn the early 70's, Jefferson and Wakulla counties joined the Leon County Public Library System, forming the Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla County Public Library System. According to the library's web site, \"Leon County provided administrative and other services to the two smaller counties, while each supported the direct costs of their library services and their share of Leon's administrative costs.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  In 1975 the system started a branch library in the Bond community, a predominantly black community on the city's Southside. Wakulla County left the library cooperative in 1975 to start its own library system and in 1978 the main library moved to a location in Tallahassee's Northwood Mall.  Jefferson County left the library cooperative in 1980 and the library reverted to the Leon County Public Library.  In 1989 \"ground breaking was held on March 4 for a new $8.5 million main library facility with 88,000 feet of space. The site was next door to the library's original home, The Columns, which had been moved in 1971 to 100 N. Duval.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  The new library had its grand opening in 1991 and was renamed in 1993 in honor of former Governor LeRoy Collins.\n\n==Points of interest==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Alfred B.

For example, Advaita Vedanta holds that after attaining moksha a person knows their \"soul, self\" and identifies it as one with Brahman and everyone in all respects.<ref name=karlpotter/><ref name=klausklost/> The followers of [[Dvaita]] (dualistic) schools, in moksha state, identify individual \"soul, self\" as distinct from Brahman but infinitesimally close, and after attaining moksha expect to spend eternity in a [[loka]] (heaven). To theistic schools of Hinduism, moksha is liberation from samsara, while for other schools such as the monistic school, moksha is possible in current life and is a psychological concept. According to Deutsche, moksha is transcendental consciousness to the latter, the perfect state of being, of self-realization, of freedom and of \"realizing the whole universe as the Self\".<ref name=\"E.

Yoga is a Hindu discipline which trains the body, mind and consciousness for health, tranquility and spiritual insight. This is done through a system of postures and exercises to practise control of the body and mind.<ref>''Encyclopaedia of Hindu Gods and Goddesses'' \u2013 Page 178, Suresh Chandra \u2013 1998</ref> Texts dedicated to Yoga include the [[Yoga Sutras]], the [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]], the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and, as their philosophical and historical basis, the Upanishads. Yoga is means, and the four major ''marga'' (paths) discussed in Hinduism are: [[Bhakti Yoga]] (the path of love and devotion), [[Karma Yoga]] (the path of right action), [[R\u0101ja Yoga]] (the path of meditation), [[J\u00f1\u0101na Yoga]] (the path of wisdom)<ref name=bhaskaressentgeneral>{{Harvnb|Bhaskarananda|1994}}</ref> An individual may prefer one or some yogas over others, according to his or her inclination and understanding.

Yoga is means, and the four major ''marga'' (paths) discussed in Hinduism are: [[Bhakti Yoga]] (the path of love and devotion), [[Karma Yoga]] (the path of right action), [[R\u0101ja Yoga]] (the path of meditation), [[J\u00f1\u0101na Yoga]] (the path of wisdom)<ref name=bhaskaressentgeneral>{{Harvnb|Bhaskarananda|1994}}</ref> An individual may prefer one or some yogas over others, according to his or her inclination and understanding.

He became known as the \"'''Butcher of Badajoz'''\" (''Carnicero de Badajoz'') because he ordered thousands killed, including wounded men in the hospital.\n\n==Early life==\nThe son of a doctor, he enrolled at a young age in the [[Toledo Infantry Academy]], where [[Francisco Franco]] was a fellow cadet. The two men received their commissions concurrently and served together in Africa, where Yag\u00fce was wounded on several occasions and received several decorations.\n\nYag\u00fce was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1932. He, along with Franco and General [[Eduardo L\u00f3pez Ochoa]], helped suppress a workers uprising in [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934|Asturias]] using Moroccan [[Regulares|Regulars]] and [[Spanish Legion|Legionnaires]] in 1934. He was a strong early supporter of the [[Falange Espa\u00f1ola]] and a close personal friend of [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera]].\n\n==Spanish Civil War==\nWhen [[Niceto Alcal\u00e1-Zamora]] was replaced as President of the Republic by the [[left-wing]] [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a]] on 10 May 1936, a group of Spanish Army officers, including Yag\u00fce, [[Emilio Mola]], Franco, [[Gonzalo Queipo de Llano]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo]], started plotting to overthrow the democratically elected Popular Front government. This led to a [[Pronunciamiento|military uprising]] which precipitated the [[Spanish Civil War]] on 17 July 1936.\n\nYag\u00fce's forces revolted in [[Ceuta]] before crossing the [[Straits of Gibraltar]] to link up with Nationalist forces in [[Seville]], led by Queipo de Llano. Yag\u00fce advanced northward, first [[Battle of M\u00e9rida|seizing]] [[M\u00e9rida, Spain|M\u00e9rida]] before [[Battle of Badajoz (1936)|attacking Badajoz]] with 3,000 troops on 14 August 1936. Bitter street fighting took place when the Nationalists advanced into the city. Yag\u00fce's forces eventually gained control of Badajoz, with both sides suffering heavy casualties.\n\nUnder Yag\u00fce's direction hundreds of prisoners, military and civilians, were killed or executed in Badajoz, during the [[Badajoz massacre]].\n<ref>[http://www.sbhac.net/Republica/TextosIm/Badajoz/Badajoz.htm Rafael Tenorio, Las matanzas de Badajoz (Spanish)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907234034/http://www.sbhac.net/Republica/TextosIm/Badajoz/Badajoz.htm |date=2006-09-07 }}.</ref><ref>Mario Neves (1986) \"La matanza de Badajoz.

New York, Macmillan.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Of course that we have killed them. What did you suppose? Will I take 4,000 red prisoners with my column, having to advance against the clock? Or will I leave them in my rearguard so that Badajoz will be red another time?</blockquote>\n\nYag\u00fce was then promoted to colonel and afterwards advanced on [[Madrid]], [[Battle of the Sierra Guadalupe|capturing Trujillo]], Navalmoral de la Mata and [[Battle of Talavera de la Reina (1936)|Talavera de la Reina]], but was unable to take the capital. He took part in the [[Aragon Offensive]] and seized control of [[Belchite]], [[Caspe]] and [[L\u00e9rida]]. He also played a leading role in the Nationalist victory at the [[Battle of the Ebro]].

He became known as the \"'''Butcher of Badajoz'''\" (''carnicero de Badajoz'') because he ordered thousands killed, including wounded men in the hospital.\n\n==Early life==\nThe son of a doctor, he enrolled at a young age in the [[Toledo Infantry Academy]], where [[Francisco Franco]] was a fellow cadet. The two men received their commissions concurrently and served together in Africa, where Yag\u00fce was wounded on several occasions and received several decorations.\n\nYag\u00fce was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1932. He, along with Franco and General [[Eduardo L\u00f3pez Ochoa]], helped suppress a workers uprising in [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934|Asturias]] using Moroccan [[Regulares|Regulars]] and [[Spanish Legion|Legionnaires]] in 1934. He was a strong early supporter of the [[Falange Espa\u00f1ola]] and a close personal friend of [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera]].\n\n==Spanish Civil War==\nWhen [[Niceto Alcal\u00e1-Zamora]] was replaced as President of the Republic by the [[left-wing]] [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a]] on 10 May 1936, a group of Spanish Army officers, including Yag\u00fce, [[Emilio Mola]], Franco, [[Gonzalo Queipo de Llano]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo]], started plotting to overthrow the democratically elected Popular Front government. This led to a [[Pronunciamiento|military uprising]] which precipitated the [[Spanish Civil War]] on 17 July 1936.\n\nYag\u00fce's forces revolted in [[Ceuta]] before crossing the [[Straits of Gibraltar]] to link up with Nationalist forces in [[Seville]], led by Queipo de Llano. Yag\u00fce advanced northward, first [[Battle of M\u00e9rida|seizing]] [[M\u00e9rida, Spain|M\u00e9rida]] before [[Battle of Badajoz (1936)|attacking Badajoz]] with 3,000 troops on 14 August 1936. Bitter street fighting took place when the Nationalists advanced into the city. Yag\u00fce's forces eventually gained control of Badajoz, with both sides suffering heavy casualties.\n\nUnder Yag\u00fce's direction hundreds of prisoners, military and civilians, were killed or executed in Badajoz, during the [[Badajoz massacre]].\n<ref>[http://www.sbhac.net/Republica/TextosIm/Badajoz/Badajoz.htm Rafael Tenorio, Las matanzas de Badajoz (Spanish)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907234034/http://www.sbhac.net/Republica/TextosIm/Badajoz/Badajoz.htm |date=2006-09-07 }}.</ref><ref>Mario Neves (1986) \"La matanza de Badajoz.

New York, Macmillan.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Of course that we have killed them. What did you suppose? Will I take 4,000 red prisoners with my column, having to advance against the clock? Or will I leave them in my rearguard so that Badajoz will be red another time?</blockquote>\n\nYag\u00fce was then promoted to colonel and afterwards advanced on [[Madrid]], [[Battle of the Sierra Guadalupe|capturing Trujillo]], Navalmoral de la Mata and [[Battle of Talavera de la Reina (1936)|Talavera de la Reina]], but was unable to take the capital. He took part in the [[Aragon Offensive]] and seized control of [[Belchite]], [[Caspe]] and [[L\u00e9rida]]. He also played a leading role in the Nationalist victory at the [[Battle of the Ebro]].
