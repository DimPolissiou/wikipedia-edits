As a young man, he first worked in the merchant firm of Germany's consul in Ponce, Thomas Davidson. By 1831, Dede had established his own merchant firm together with another German emigre, Ernst W. Overmann. In 1841\u20131842, the partnership purchased Hacienda Flacas, a large estate consisting of some 250 [[cuerda]]s of land. His association with Overmann lasted until 1865 when the civil war in the United States led to a precipitous drop in sugar trade and their hacienda went bankrupt.<ref>Francisco Antonio Scarano.

As a young man, he first worked in the merchant firm of Germany's consul in Ponce, Thomas Davidson. By 1831, Dede had established his own merchant firm together with another German emigre, Ernst W. Overmann. In 1841-1842, the partnership purchased Hacienda Flacas, a large estate consisting of some 250 [[cuerda]]s of land. His association with Overmann lasted until 1865 when the civil war in the United States led to a precipitous drop in sugar trade and their hacienda went bankrupt.<ref>Francisco Antonio Scarano.

[[Sega]] began handling North American publishing duties in 2016 under the Atlus brand name.}} Focusing around a series of [[role-playing video game]]s, ''Persona'' is a spin-off from Atlus' ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' franchise. The first entry in the series, ''[[Revelations: Persona]]'',{{efn|This game is generally referred to as ''Persona 1'' or just ''Persona'' rather than by its full title.}} was released in 1996 for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]. The series has had several more entries produced, with the most recent, ''[[Persona 5 Royal]]'', released in March 2020. Numerous spin-offs have also been developed. The series takes its title from beings summoned by characters in battle, manifesting from their [[psychological persona]].\n\n''Persona'' began as a spin-off based on the positively-received high school setting of ''[[Shin Megami Tensei If...]]'' (1994). ''Persona''{{'s}} core features include a group of students as the main cast, a [[silent protagonist]] similar to the mainline ''Megami Tensei'' franchise, and combat using [[#Personas|Personas]]. Since the release of ''[[Persona 3]]'' in 2006, the main series has used a [[Dating sim|social simulation]] function called Social Links, which are directly linked to how Personas evolve. Character designs are by series co-creator [[Kazuma Kaneko]] (''Persona'' and the ''Persona 2'' duology) and [[Shigenori Soejima]] (''Persona 3'' onwards). Its overall theme is exploration of the human psyche and how the characters find their true selves. The series' recurring concepts and design elements draw on [[Jungian psychology]] and [[Archetypal pedagogy|archetypes]], along with religion, mythology, and literature.\n\n''Revelations: Persona'' was the first role-playing ''Megami Tensei'' game to be released outside of Japan. Beginning with ''[[Persona 2: Eternal Punishment]]'', the English localizations began to remain faithful to the Japanese versions at the insistence of Atlus. The series is highly popular internationally, becoming the best-known ''Megami Tensei'' spin-off and establishing Atlus and the ''Megami Tensei'' franchise in North America. Following the release of ''Persona 3'' and ''4'', the series also established a strong following in Europe. The series has since gone on to ship over 11 million copies worldwide, outselling its parent franchise. There have been numerous adaptations, including [[anime]] television series, films, [[novelization]]s, [[manga]]s, [[stage plays]], [[radio drama]]s, and musical concerts.\n\n==Games==\n{{VG timeline\n| 1996 = ''[[Revelations: Persona]]''\n| 1999 = ''[[Persona 2: Innocent Sin]]''\n| 2000 = ''[[Persona 2: Eternal Punishment]]''\n| 2006 = ''[[Persona 3]]''\n| 2008 = ''[[Persona 4]]''\n| 2016 = ''[[Persona 5]]''\n}}\n\n===Main series===\n* '''''[[Revelations: Persona]]''''' is the first entry in the series, was released in Japan and North America for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in 1996.<ref name=\"PersonaSales\"/><ref name=\"FamRevelations\"/> A port to [[Microsoft Windows]] was released in Japan in 1999.<ref name=\"PersonaWindows\"/> The game was later ported to the [[PlayStation Portable]] (PSP): it was published in 2009 in Japan and North America as physical and digital releases, and 2010 in Europe as a digital release.<ref name=\"AndriaPSP\"/><ref name=\"SilInterview\"/><ref name=\"PersonaPSN\"/> Set in the town of Mikage-cho, it follows a group of high school students from St. Hermelin High, who are forced to confront an outbreak of demons in their hometown.<ref name=\"Persona3clubB\"/>\n* '''''[[Persona 2: Innocent Sin]]''''' is the second entry in the series, released in Japan for the PlayStation in 1999.<ref name=\"PersonaSales\"/> After the success of ''Persona''{{'s}} PSP port, a port of ''Innocent Sin'' was greenlit.

The way battles initiate varies between [[random encounter]]s (''Persona'', ''Persona 2'') or running into models representing enemy groups (''Persona 3'' onwards). Battles are governed by a [[Turn-based|turn-based system]], where the player party and enemies each attack the opposing side. Actions in battle include standard physical attacks using short-range melee or long-range projectile weapons, magical attacks, using items, guarding, and under certain conditions escaping from battles. During battle, either side can strike an enemy's weakness, which deals more damage than other attacks.<ref name=\"ISmanual\"/><ref name=\"manualP4\"/><ref name=\"GSpersona3\"/><ref name=\"PSPmanual\"/><ref name=\"P5Kotaku\"/> Starting with ''Persona 3'', landing a critical hit grants the character an extra turn. If all enemies are knocked down by critical hits, the party can perform an \"All Out Attack\", with all party members attacking at once and dealing high damage. Each party member is manually controlled by the player in all but one ''Persona'' title: in ''Persona 3'', all the party apart from the main character are controlled by an AI-based command system. The general gameplay has remained consistent across all ''Persona'' games.<ref name=\"ISmanual\"/><ref name=\"manualP4\"/><ref name=\"P4weather\"/><ref name=\"P5Kotaku\"/><ref name=\"manual3132\"/><ref name=\"P4GoldReview\"/>\n\nEach ''Persona'' game also includes unique elements. In ''Persona'', battles take place on a grid-based battlefield, with characters' and enemies' movements dictated by their placement on the battlefield.<ref name=\"RPG2\"/> This system was abandoned for the ''Persona 2'' games: the party has free movement across the battlefield, and is assigned a set of moves which can be changed in the menu during and in between battles.<ref name=\"ISmanual\"/><ref name=\"GSreviewEP\"/> In ''Persona'' and ''Persona 3'', there is a [[lunar phase]] tied to gameplay, time progression, and the plot. In ''Persona 4'', this was changed to a weather-based system, where changes in the weather keyed to the story affected enemy behavior.<ref name=\"P4weather\"/><ref name=\"Manual1\"/><ref name=\"PlayInterviews\"/> ''Persona 5'' introduces elements such as [[Platform game|platforming]] and [[Stealth game|stealth]] gameplay to dungeon exploration.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"P5Kotaku\"/><ref name=\"P5FamBattle\"/> The All-Out Attack can be initiated in a \"Hold-Up\" session, triggered when all enemies are knocked down.<ref name=\"DigiGameplay\"/>\n\n====Personas====\nA defining aspect of the series is the use of the \"Persona\", which are physical manifestations of a person's psyche and subconscious used for combat.<ref name=\"GIpersona\"/> The main Personas for the cast used up to ''Persona 3'' were inspired by [[Classical mythology|Graeco-Roman mythology]]. ''Persona 4''{{'s}} were based on [[Japanese deities]]; while ''Persona 5'' used characters inspired by fictional and historical outlaws and thieves.<ref name=\"P4guide\"/><ref name=\"SilP4\"/><ref name=\"GemP5outlaw\"/> The summoning ritual for Personas in battle varies throughout the series: in early games, the party gains the ability to summon through a short ritual after playing a parlor game; in ''Persona 3'', they fire a gun-like device called an Evoker at their head; in ''Persona 4'', they summon their Personas using [[Tarot|Tarot cards]]; in ''Persona 5'', they are summoned through the characters' masks.<ref name=\"GIpersona\"/><ref name=\"ShackMasks\"/>\n\nPersonas are used for types of physical attack and magical attacks, along with actions such as healing and curing or inflicting [[status effect]]s.<ref name=\"ISmanual\"/><ref name=\"manualP4\"/><ref name=\"RPG2\"/><ref name=\"PSPmanual\"/><ref name=\"GIpersona\"/><ref name=\"manual2627\"/> For all ''Persona'' games, all playable characters start out with an initial Persona, which can evolve into other Personas through story-based events and use during battle.<ref name=\"ISmanual\"/><ref name=\"P4GoldReview\"/><ref name=\"manual2627\"/> In multiple ''Persona'' games, two or more Personas can be summoned at once to perform a powerful Fusion Spell.<ref name=\"ISmanual\"/><ref name=\"P4GoldReview\"/><ref name=\"GSreviewEP\"/> In ''Persona 3'', ''4'' and ''5'', only the main character can wield and change between multiple Personas; the other characters use a single Persona.<ref name=manualP4/><ref name=\"manual2627\"/> During the course of the game, the player acquires more Personas through a system of Skill Cards, represented by [[Major Arcana]] Tarot cards. Each skill card represents a different Persona family, which in turn hold their own abilities inherent to that family. Multiple Personas can be fused together to create a new Persona with improved and inherited abilities: these range from fusing two Personas in the ''Persona 2'' duology to up to twelve in ''Persona 4''.<ref name=\"ISmanual\"/><ref name=\"manualP4\"/><ref name=\"RPG2\"/><ref name=\"PSPmanual\"/><ref name=\"manual2627\"/><ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/> Starting with ''Persona 3'', the main protagonist of each game has an ability known as \"Wild Card\", an ability to summon multiple Personas represented by the Fool Arcana.<ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/>\n\n====Social Links and Negotiation====\n\"Social Links\" is a system introduced in ''Persona 3'' that is a form of character interaction tied to the growth of Personas. During their time outside battle, the main character can interact with and grow a particular Social Link, which acts as an independent character growth system tied to a Persona family or Arcanum. As the main character's relationship with the character representing a Social Link grows, its rank is raised and more powerful Personas related to the Social Link's assigned Arcanum can be summoned and fused.<ref name=\"manualP4\"/><ref name=\"GSpersona3\"/> Attributes related to the main character's social life can also be used to improve their Persona abilities, such as their academic abilities and social aptitude.<ref name=\"manualP4\"/><ref name=\"manual2627\"/> An enhanced version of the Social Link system, known as \"Confidants\", appeared in ''Persona 5''.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/>\n\nIn ''Persona'', the ''Persona 2'' duology, and ''Persona 5'', there is also a \"Negotiation\" mechanic carried over from the ''Megami Tensei'' series, in which player characters can talk with enemies and provoke certain actions depending on their dialogue choices. Some responses yield Skill Cards for use in creating new Personas.<ref name=\"ISmanual\"/><ref name=\"RPG2\"/> Negotiation was removed from ''Persona 3'' and ''Persona 4'', although Atlus staff considered the Social Link system and aspects of Persona fusion to be a \"disguised\" version of it.<ref name=\"P4local\"/> In ''Persona 5'', they can be initiated during a \"Hold Up\" session; Shadows can be persuaded to join the party as a new Persona if the Negotiation is successful, the player does not already have them, and is at an appropriate experience level.<ref name=\"DigiGameplay\"/><ref name=\"PolyGameplayP5\"/>\n\n===Setting and themes===\nThe ''Persona'' series takes place in modern-day [[Japan]] and focuses on a group of high school students, with the exception to this being ''Eternal Punishment'', which focused on a group of adults.<ref name=\"GIpersona\"/><ref name=\"1upPersona4\"/> The setting has been described as [[urban fantasy]], with extraordinary events happening in otherwise normal locations.<ref name=\"PersonaSummery\"/> The typical setting used is a city, with a noted exception being the rural town setting of ''Persona 4''.<ref name=\"1upPersona4\"/> Although they are typically stand-alone games that only share thematic elements, the ''Persona'' games share a continuity, with elements from previous games turning up in later ones.<ref name=\"GIpersona\"/><ref name=\"1upPersona4\"/> ''Persona'' and the ''Persona 2'' games shared narrative elements which were concluded with ''Eternal Punishment'', so ''Persona 3'' started out with a fresh setting and characters.<ref name=\"1upPersona3\"/> The first in the series is ''Persona'', set in the year 1996. This is followed by the events of ''Innocent Sin'' and ''Eternal Punishment'' in 1999. At the end of ''Innocent Sin'', the main characters rewrite events to avert the destruction of Earth, creating the ''Eternal Punishment'' reality, with the original reality becoming an isolated Other Side. ''Persona 3'' and subsequent games stem from ''Eternal Punishment''.<ref name=\"Persona3clubB\"/><ref name=\"PersonaWorld\"/> ''Persona 3'' is set from 2009 to 2010, and ''Persona 4'' is set from 2011 to 2012. The ''Persona 4 Arena'' games and ''Dancing All Night'' take place in the months following ''Persona 4''.<ref name=\"Persona3clubB\"/><ref name=\"SilArena\"/><ref name=\"GemDancing\"/> In contrast, ''Persona 5'' is set in a non-specific year referred to as \"20XX\".<ref name=\"P5year\"/> The ''Persona Q'' series takes place in a separate enclosed world in which the characters of ''Persona 3'', ''4'', and ''5'' are drawn into from their respective time periods.<ref name=\"DengPQ\"/>\n\nA central concept for the series is the [[collective unconscious]], a place generated by the hearts of humanity and from which Personas are born.<ref name=\"Persona3clubB\"/><ref name=\"PersonaWorld\"/> According to the official ''Persona Club P3'' book, the collective unconscious was generated by the primitive life on Earth as a means of containing the spiritual essence of Nyx, a space-born being whose presence would cause the death of all life on Earth. Her body was damaged by the impact and became the moon, while her psyche was left on the surface and locked away at the heart of the collective unconscious. The fragments of Nyx's psyche, known as \"Shadows\", are both a threat and a crucial part of humanity's existence. To further help defend against hostile Shadows, people generated the deities that exist within the collective unconscious, many of which manifest as Personas. Nyx appears in ''Persona 3'' as the antagonist.<ref name=\"Persona3clubA\"/> The major dungeon locations in each game are generated by the latent wishes and desires of humans and are generally used by another force for their own ends.<ref name=\"PMythDetail\"/> A recurring location appearing in most of the games is the \"Velvet Room\", a place between reality and unconsciousness created by Philemon that changes form depending on the psyche of its current guest. Its inhabitants, led by an enigmatic old man called Igor, aid the main characters by helping them hone their Persona abilities. While normally inaccessible and invisible to all except those who forged a contract with the room, others can be summoned alongside the guest, intentionally or otherwise.<ref name=\"FamVelvet\"/><ref name=\"PersonaDVD\"/><ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/><ref>{{cite video game |developer=[[Atlus]] |title=Persona 3 |date=August 14, 2007 |quote='''Junpei:''' Hey, wait a second!

I am rather surprised, though...I did not expect your friends to follow you here.}}</ref>\n\nThe main character of each ''Persona'' game is a [[silent protagonist]] representing the player, with a manner described by the series' director as \"silent and cool\".<ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> When the writer for new story content in ''Eternal Punishment''{{'s}} PSP version wished for the main character to have spoken dialogue, this was vetoed as it went against the series tradition.<ref name=\"AtlusBlog\"/> Two recurring characters generated by the collective unconscious are Philemon and Nyarlathotep, the respective representatives of the positive and negative traits of humanity.<ref name=\"Persona3clubB\"/> In ''Innocent Sin'', the two reveal that they are engaged in a proxy contest as to whether humanity can embrace its contradictory feelings and find a higher purpose before destroying itself.<ref name=\"PersonaWorld\"/> Philemon makes appearances in later ''Persona'' games as a blue butterfly.<ref name=\"P4guide\"/><ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/> Many of the major antagonists in the series are personifications of death generated by the human subconscious.<ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/> The central theme of the ''Persona'' series is exploration of the human psyche and the main characters discovering their true selves.<ref name=\"AtlusTheme\"/> The stories generally focus on the main cast's interpersonal relationships and psychologies.<ref name=\"EshidaInterview\"/> There is also an underlying focus on \"the human soul\".<ref name=\"PlayInterview\"/>\n\nMany of the concepts and characters within the series ([[Persona (psychology)|Personas]], [[Shadow (psychology)|Shadows]], Philemon) use [[Jungian psychology]] and [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]].<ref name=\"PersonaDVD\"/> A recurring motif are the \"masks\" people wear during everyday life, which ties back to their Personas. This motif was more overtly expressed in ''Persona 5'' through the main casts' use of masks in their thief guises.<ref name=\"GIinterview\"/><ref name=\"P5magazine\"/> The dual lives of the main casts are directly inspired by these themes.<ref name=\"PMythDetail\"/> Each game also includes specific themes and motifs. ''Persona 2'' focuses on the effect of rumors on the fabric of reality (referred to by the developers as \"the power of [[Kotodama]]\"); ''Persona 3'' employs themes involving depression and the darkness within people; ''Persona 4'' focuses on how gossip and the media influences people's views of others; and ''Persona 5'' shows how the main characters pursue personal freedom in a restrictive modern society.<ref name=\"P4guide\"/><ref name=\"PersonaSummery\"/><ref name=\"Persona5Theme\"/> A recurring element in the earlier entries is \"[[Zhuangzi (book)#The Butterfly Dream|The Butterfly Dream]]\", a famous story by the Chinese philosopher [[Zhuang Zhou]]. It ties in with the series' themes, and also with Philemon's frequent appearances as a butterfly.<ref name=\"Persona3clubB\"/> Philemon's original appearance was based on Zhuang Zhou.<ref name=\"PersonaDVD\"/> The character [[Nyarlathotep]] is based on the character of the same name from [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s [[Cthulhu Mythos]], and the Mythos as a whole is frequently referenced in ''Persona 2''.<ref name=\"P4guide\"/><ref name=\"Persona2book1\"/> The Velvet Room was based on the [[Black and White Lodges|Black Lodge]] from ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', while Igor and his assistants are all named after characters from [[Mary Shelley]]'s novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' and its adaptations.<ref name=\"PersonaDVD\"/><ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/>\n\n==Development==\nThe ''Persona'' series was first conceived after the release of ''[[Shin Megami Tensei If...]]'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]]. As the high school setting of ''If...'' had been positively received, Atlus decided to create a dedicated subseries focusing on the inner struggles of young adults.<ref name=\"PlayInterview\"/> The focus on high school life was also decided upon due to the experiences of the series' creators, [[Kouji Okada]] and [[Kazuma Kaneko]]: according to them, as nearly everyone experiences being a student at some point in their lives, it was something everyone could relate to, representing a time of both learning and personal freedom. In their view, this approach helped players accept the series' themes and the variety of ideas included in each title. Kaneko in particular tried to recreate his experiences and the impact it had on him during his time with the series.<ref name=\"DVDfeature\"/> The main concept behind the first game was a ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' title that was more approachable for new and casual players than the main series. The abundance of casual games on the PlayStation reinforced this decision.<ref name=\"PersonaDVD\"/><ref name=\"PersonaStaff\"/> The game's title, {{Nihongo foot|''Megami Ibunroku'',|\u5973\u795e\u7570\u805e\u9332||lit. \"''Goddess' Odyssey''\"|group=Jp.}} represented the game's status as a direct spin-off from the series.<ref name=\"FamKaneko\"/> It was later dropped to further define ''Persona'' as a standalone series.<ref name=\"Persona2book1\"/> After the success of ''Persona'', ''Innocent Sin'' began development, retaining many of the original staff. During the writing of ''Innocent Sin'', it was decided that the world of ''Persona 2'' needed a different perspective than that of the current protagonist. This decision laid the groundwork for ''Eternal Punishment''.<ref name=\"Persona2book1\"/><ref name=\"Persona2book2\"/> Following this, the ''Persona'' series entered a hiatus while focus turned to other projects, including ''[[Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne]]''.<ref name=\"4GstoryP5\"/>\n\nThe conceptual ''Persona 3'' was submitted to Atlus in 2003 by [[Katsura Hashino]], who had worked as a designer for multiple ''Megami Tensei'' games and had been the director for ''Nocturne''. Gaining Atlus' approval of the concept, development started in the same year, after the completion of ''Nocturne'' and the ''[[Digital Devil Saga]]'' duology.<ref name=\"HashinoMessage1\"/><ref name=\"P3genesis\"/><ref name=\"HashinoMessage2\"/> ''Persona 3'' was part of Atlus' push to expand their player base outside of Japan.<ref name=\"4GstoryP5\"/> Ideas were being passed around about ''Persona 4'', but the game did not begin official development until after the release of ''Persona 3''.<ref name=\"PlayInterview\"/> Preparations for ''Persona 5''{{'s}} development began in 2010. The team decided to shift towards more challenging story themes, saying that the shift would be more drastic than that experienced with ''Persona 3''.<ref name=\"KotakuPersona\"/><ref name=\"GemP5\"/> ''Persona 4 Arena'' and its sequel were the first non-RPG collaborative project in the series: its success inspired the creation of both ''Persona Q'' and ''Dancing All Night''.<ref name=\"PQorigins\"/><ref name=\"P4Dorigins\"/>\n\nThe first three ''Persona'' games were developed by Atlus' internal R&D1 studio, the studio responsible for the mainline ''Megami Tensei'' games.<ref name=\"SMTdeveloper\"/> Beginning with ''Persona 3'', a dedicated team originally referred to as the 2nd Creative Production Department began handling development for the series. The team was later renamed P-Studio in 2012.<ref name=\"P3design\"/><ref name=\"PersonaDev1\"/><ref name=\"PersonaDev2\"/> Hashino remained in charge of the studio until the Japanese release of ''Persona 5'' in 2016, when he moved to found a new department, Studio Zero, to work on non-''Persona'' projects.<ref name=\"P5studioA\"/><ref name=\"P5studioB\"/> Aside from Atlus, other developers have helped develop entries in the ''Persona'' series. During the pre-production stage of ''Persona 4 Arena'', Hashino approached [[Arc System Works]] after being impressed by their work on the ''[[BlazBlue]]'' series.<ref name=\"IGNinterview\"/> For ''Dancing All Night'', development was initially handled by [[Dingo Inc.|Dingo]], but due to quality concerns Atlus took over primary development with Dingo being retained as a supporting developer.<ref name=\"AtlusDancing\"/>\n\n===Art design===\n[[File:Persona 3 AD.jpg|right|thumb|Promotional artwork for ''Persona 3'' showing some of the main cast and a Persona. It was created by [[Shigenori Soejima]], who has been the series character designer since.<ref name=\"SoejimaInterview\"/><ref name=\"P3Art\"/>]]\nThe two character artists for the ''Persona'' series are [[Kazuma Kaneko]], a central artist in the main ''Megami Tensei'' series who designed characters for the first three ''Persona'' games, and [[Shigenori Soejima]], who worked in a secondary capacity alongside Kaneko and took Kaneko's place as the character designer from ''Persona 3'' onwards.<ref name=\"PersonaDVD\"/><ref name=\"KanekoDesign\"/><ref name=\"OtakuKaneko\"/><ref name=\"GIsoejima\"/> While designing the characters for ''Persona'', Kaneko was inspired by multiple notable celebrities and fictional characters of the time, along with members of Atlus staff. In ''Persona'' and ''Innocent Sin'', the main characters all wore the same school uniforms, so Kaneko differentiated them using accessories.<ref name=\"PersonaDVD\"/><ref name=\"KanekoDesign\"/> For ''Eternal Punishment'', the main cast were adults, so Kaneko needed to rethink his design procedure. Eventually, he adopted the concept of ordinary adults, and gave them designs that would stand out in-game.<ref name=\"DVDfeature\"/>\n\nSoejima's first major work for the series was working on side characters for ''Persona 2'' alongside Kaneko.<ref name=\"PSsoejima\"/> Kaneko put Soejima in charge of the series' art direction after ''Persona 2'' as Kaneko did not want to imprint his drawing style on the ''Persona'' series, and also wanted Soejima to gain experience.<ref name=\"OtakuKaneko\"/> Soejima felt a degree of pressure when he was given his new role, as the series had accumulated a substantial following during Kaneko's tenure.<ref name=\"SoejimaInterview\"/> In a later interview, Soejima said that although he respected and admired Kaneko, he never consciously imitated the latter's work, and eventually settled into the role of pleasing the fans of the ''Persona'' series, approaching character designs with the idea of creating something new rather than referring back to Kaneko's work.<ref name=\"PlayInterviews\"/> For his character designs, Soejima uses real people he has met or seen, looking at what their appearance says about their personality. If his designs come too close to the people he has seen, he does a rough sketch while keeping the personality of the person in mind.<ref name=\"GIsoejima\"/> For his work on ''Persona Q'', his first time working with a [[Super deformed|deformed Chibi]] style due to its links with the ''[[Etrian Odyssey (series)|Etrian Odyssey]]'' series, Soejima took into account what fans felt about the characters. A crucial part of his design technique was looking at what made a character stand out, then adjusting those features so they remained recognizable even with the redesign.<ref name=\"GIsoejima\"/><ref name=\"PQusg\"/>\n\nStarting with ''Persona 3'', each ''Persona'' game has been defined by a different aesthetic and key color. It is one of the first artistic decisions made by the team: ''Persona 3'' has a dark atmosphere and serious characters, so the primary color was chosen as blue to reflect these and the urban setting. In contrast, ''Persona 4'' has a lighter tone and characters but also sports a murder-mystery plot, so the color yellow was chosen to represent both the lighter tones and to evoke a \"warning\" signal.<ref name=\"GIsoejima\"/> According to Soejima, blue was the \"color of adolescence\", and yellow was the \"color of happiness\".<ref name=\"PlayInterviews\"/> For ''Persona 5'', the color chosen was red, to convey a harsh feeling in contrast to the previous ''Persona'' games and tie in with the game's story themes. Its art style was described as a natural evolution from where ''Persona 4'' left off.<ref name=\"P5magazine\"/><ref name=\"Gematsu1\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe music of the ''Persona'' series has been handled by multiple composers. The one most associated with the series is [[Shoji Meguro]], who began working on ''Persona'' shortly after he joined Atlus in 1995. His very first composition for the game was \"Aria of the Soul\", the theme for the velvet room that became a recurring track throughout the series.<ref name=\"ShojiInterview\"/><ref name=\"Persona3Liners\"/><ref name=\"ShojiPersona\"/> During his initial work on the series, Meguro felt restricted by the limited storage space of the PlayStation's disc system, and so when he began composing for ''Persona 3'', which allowed for [[Streaming audio in video games|sound streaming]] due to increased hardware capacity, he was able to fully express his musical style. His main worry for his music in ''Persona 3'' and ''4'' was the singers' pronunciation of the English lyrics.<ref name=\"PlayInterviews\"/> He was unable to work on the ''Persona 2'' games as he was tied up with other projects, including ''[[Maken X]]''.<ref name=\"Persona2Meguro\"/> Meguro also served as the lead composer in ''Persona 5'', using elements of [[acid jazz]] and the game's themes for inspiration to achieve the right mood.<ref name=\"SilComposer\"/> The music for ''Innocent Sin'' and ''Eternal Punishment'' was handled by Toshiko Tasaki, Kenichi Tsuchiya, and Masaki Kurokawa. Tsuchiya had originally done minor work on ''Persona'', and found composing for the games a strenuous experience.<ref name=\"DengTsuchiya1\"/><ref name=\"ISmusic\"/><ref name=\"EPmusic\"/> Spin-offs, such as the ''Persona Q'' and ''Dancing'' subseries, are usually handled by other Atlus composers such as Atsushi Kitajoh, Toshiki Konishi, and Ryota Kozuka.<ref name=\"MusicPQ\"/>\n\n==Release==\nThe series consists of thirteen games, not counting re-releases and mobile games.<ref name=\"PersonaSales\"/> ''Persona'' was the first role-playing entry in the ''Megami Tensei'' franchise to be released outside of Japan, as previous entries had been considered ineligible due to possibly controversial content. As examples of this content were in a milder form for ''Persona'', the restrictions did not apply.<ref name=\"PersonaLocal\"/><ref name=\"FamOrigins\"/> According to Atlus, ''Persona'' and its sequel were to test player reactions to the ''Megami Tensei'' series outside of Japan.<ref name=\"SMTdeveloper\"/> The greater majority of ''Persona'' games were either first released on or exclusive to PlayStation platforms. This trend was broken with the release of ''Persona Q'' for the 3DS in 2014.<ref name=\"MCVpersona\"/> All the ''Persona'' games have been published by Atlus in Japan and North America.<ref name=\"SMTdeveloper\"/> An exception in Japan was the Windows port of ''Persona'', which was published by [[ASCII Corporation]].<ref name=\"PersonaWindows\"/> After 2016, due to Atlus USA's merger with Sega of America, [[Sega]] took over North American publishing duties, although the Atlus brand remained intact.<ref name=\"PersonaSega\"/>\n\nDue to the company not having a European branch, Atlus has generally given publishing duties to other third-party publishers with branches in Europe. This frequently results in a gap between North American and European release dates ranging from a few months to a year or more.<ref name=\"DesSega\"/><ref name=\"P4Arights\"/><ref name=\"P4Deurope\"/> For ''Persona 3'', Atlus gave publishing duties to [[Koei]].<ref name=\"P3eu\"/> For ''Persona 4'', European publishing was handled by [[Square Enix]].<ref name=\"P4eu\"/> ''Persona 4 Arena'' was originally published in Europe by Zen United after a long delay, but the digital rights were eventually returned to Atlus, resulting in the game being removed from PSN.<ref name=\"P4Arights\"/> Atlus ended up re-publishing the digital PlayStation version in Europe.<ref name=\"P4Anetwork\"/> They had previously digitally published the PSP port of ''Persona'' in Europe and Australia.<ref name=\"PersonaPSN\"/> ''Arena Ultimax'' was published in Europe by Sega, who had recently purchased Atlus' parent company. It was speculated that this could lead to a new trend that would shorten the release gap between North America and Europe.<ref name=\"DesSega\"/> A regular publishing partner was [[Ghostlight]], whose relations with Atlus went back to the European release of ''Nocturne''.<ref name=\"SilGhostlight\"/><ref name=\"EuroP2\"/> A more recent partner was [[Nippon Ichi Software|NIS America]], which published ''Persona 4 Golden'', ''Persona Q'', and ''Dancing All Night''.<ref name=\"NISp4d\"/><ref name=\"P4Gnis\"/><ref name=\"NISq\"/> Atlus' partnership with NIS America ended in 2016, with NIS America citing difficulties with the company since its acquisition by Sega as reasons for the split. As part of their statement, NIS America said that Atlus had become \"very picky\" about European partners, selecting those which could offer the highest minimal sales guarantee on their products.<ref name=\"NISend\"/> Sega of America and Atlus USA eventually entered into a partnership with European publishing company [[Deep Silver]] to publish multiple games in the region, including ''Persona 5''.<ref name=\"P5euPub\"/>\n\n===Localization===\nThe localizations for the ''Persona'' series are generally handled by translator Yu Namba of [[Atlus USA]], who also handles localization for multiple other ''Megami Tensei'' games.<ref name=\"P4local\"/><ref name=\"DesPanel\"/> Another prominent staff member was Nich Maragos, who worked with Namba on multiple ''Persona'' games until moving to [[Nintendo of America]] prior to 2015.<ref name=\"DesPanel\"/><ref name=\"MaragosNOA\"/> The localization of ''Persona'' was handled by a small team, which put a lot of pressure on them as they needed to adjust the game for Western audiences: the changes implemented included altering names, changing the appearance of characters, and removing numerous cultural references. An entire alternate main quest was also removed.<ref name=\"PersonaLocal\"/><ref name=\"DesPanel\"/><ref name=\"GamaLocal\"/> After ''Persona'', it was decided that future ''Persona'' games should be as faithful as possible to their original releases.<ref name=\"DesPanel\"/> Namba's first localization project for the series was ''Eternal Punishment''.<ref name=\"SMTnamba\"/> For the release of ''Innocent Sin'', there was a debate over whether to release it, as it contained potentially controversial content including allusions to [[Nazism]].<ref name=\"DesPanel\"/> In the end, due to staff and resource shortages, ''Innocent Sin'' was passed over for localization in favor of its sequel ''Eternal Punishment''.<ref name=\"PersonaLocal\"/> Later, when the company developed the PSP ports, the team released the ports of ''Persona'' and ''Innocent Sin'' overseas so fans attracted by ''Persona 3'' and ''4'' would be able to easily catch up with the rest of the series. The localization for ''Persona'' was completely redone, reverting all the previous altered content and restoring all previously cut content.<ref name=\"PersonaLocal\"/><ref name=\"GamaLocal\"/><ref name=\"4GamerMeguro\"/> The port of ''Eternal Punishment'' was not localized due to  \"unusual circumstances\", so the company released the original version on PSN instead.<ref name=\"PSblog\"/>\n\nFor the localizations of ''Persona 3'' and ''4'', the team incorporated as much of the original content as possible, such as using Japanese honorifics and keeping the game's currency as [[Japanese yen|yen]] rather than changing it. As a general rule, they incorporate cultural elements from the original versions unless they would not be understood by the player, such as with certain jokes.<ref name=\"P4local\"/> Nevertheless, some changes had to be made. In one instance, the character Mitsuru Kirijo was originally an English speaker, but her second language for the localized version was changed to French due to her cultured appearance. School tests also needed to be changed due to similar language-based issues.<ref name=\"DesPanel\"/> The Social Links were originally called {{Nihongo foot|\"Community\",|\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3|Komyuniti|group=Jp.}} but this was changed as the word \"Community\" had a very specific meaning in English. The new name was inspired by the way the character Igor made reference to the concept using words such as \"society\" and \"bonds\".<ref name=\"FamitsuLocalJP1\"/> Some in-game [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] references were also changed: in ''Persona 3'' references to the larger ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' series by a character in an in-game [[MMORPG]] were changed to reference earlier ''Persona'' games, while mentions of a fictional detective in ''Persona 4'' were altered to reference the Kuzunoha family from ''Eternal Punishment'' and the ''Devil Summoner'' series.<ref name=\"FamitsuLocalJP1\"/> Character names have also needed adjustment, such as the stage name of ''Persona 4'' character Rise Kujikawa, and the way characters referred to each other was adjusted to appeal more to a western audience.<ref name=\"FamitsuLocalJP1\"/><ref name=\"FamitsuLocalJP2\"/> ''Persona 5'' was also localized in this fashion.<ref name=\"SMTnamba\"/>\n\nThe localized English names of games have also been altered. The banner title for ''Persona'' was changed from ''Megami Ibunroku'' to ''Revelations'', principally because the team thought the latter name sounded \"cool\". The ''Revelations'' title was removed for ''Innocent Sin'' and ''Eternal Punishment''. After the successful release of ''Nocturne'', the \"''Shin Megami Tensei''\" moniker was added to the series title to help with Western marketing.<ref name=\"PersonaLocal\"/> This has not been the case for some games: ''Persona 4 Arena''{{'s}} original title, ''Persona 4: The Ultimate in Mayonaka Arena'', was shortened as it sounded \"awkward\", and the \"''Shin Megami Tensei''\" moniker was dropped as it would have made the title too long, which has been applied to every game in the series since.<ref name=\"P5WestDelay\"/><ref name=\"FamitsuLocalJP1\"/> The same change was made for ''Persona 4 Golden'', with the team also dropping \"''The''\" that was in the Japanese title because it would have sounded \"odd\" in English-speaking regions.<ref name=\"FamitsuLocalJP1\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n{{VG Series Reviews\n|gr = no\n|game1 = [[Revelations: Persona]]\n|mc1 = 78/100 (PS)<ref name=\"MetaPlayStation\"/><br />78/100 (PSP)<ref name=\"MetaPSP\"/>\n|game2 = [[Persona 2: Innocent Sin]]\n|mc2 = 75/100 (PSP)<ref name=\"MetaPortable\"/>\n|game3 = [[Persona 2: Eternal Punishment]]\n|mc3 = 83/100 (PS)<ref name=\"MetaPS\"/>\n|game4 = [[Persona 3]]\n|mc4 = 86/100<ref name=\"MetaP3ps2\"/><br />89/100 (''FES'')<ref name=\"MetaP3fes\"/><br />89/100 (''Portable'')<ref name=\"MetaP3psp\"/>\n|game5 = [[Persona 4]]\n|mc5 = 90/100<ref name=\"MetaP4ps2\"/><br />93/100 (''Golden'')<ref name=\"MetaP4vita\"/>\n|game6 = [[Persona 5]]\n|mc6 = 93/100<ref name=\"MetaP5\"/><br />95/100 (''Royal'')<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/persona-5-royal |title=Persona 5 Royal for PlayStation 4 Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=April 5, 2020}}</ref>\n}}\n\nBy December 2019, the series had sold over 11.1 million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"P5RSales\">{{cite web |last1=Romano |first1=Sal |title=Persona 5 worldwide shipments top 3.2 million; Persona 5 Royal Japanese shipments top 400,000 |url=https://gematsu.com/2019/12/persona-5-worldwide-shipments-top-3-2-million-persona-5-royal-japanese-shipments-top-400000 |website=Gematsu |accessdate=5 December 2019}}</ref> The first ''Persona'' was referred to at the time as a [[sleeper hit]], and the success of it and ''Eternal Punishment'' helped establish both Atlus and ''Megami Tensei'' in North America. In Europe, the series did not become established prior to the release of ''Persona 3'' and ''4'', both of which were highly successful in the region.<ref name=\"PersonaLocal\"/><ref name=\"MCVpersona\"/><ref name=\"GamespotPersonaReview\"/> According to Atlus CEO Naoto Hiraoka, the main turning point for the franchise was the release of ''Persona 3'', which was a commercial success and brought the series to the attention of the mainstream gaming community. ''Persona 4'' received an even better reception. The ''Persona'' series' success has allowed Atlus to build a strong player base outside of Japan, contributing to the success of other games such as ''[[Catherine (video game)|Catherine]]''.<ref name=\"MCVpersona\"/>{{efn|While primarily referring to and focusing on the European market, Hiraoka is speaking of the ''Persona'' series in general in the cited instances.}}\n\nThe ''Persona'' series has been referred to as the most popular spin-off from the ''Megami Tensei'' franchise, gaining notoriety and success in its own right.<ref name=\"GIpersona\"/><ref name=\"PersonaSummery\"/><ref name=\"TechSMT\"/> [[Io9]]'s James Whitbrook commented that while \"here in the west, we've got plenty of awesome urban fantasy, especially from a YA perspective. But what makes Persona interesting is that it's the familiar concept of Urban fantasy, the balance of the mundane \"normal\" life of the protagonists and the problems they have there with the fantastical nature of the supernatural world that lies beneath all that, from a Japanese perspective. Over here, that's much less common, and the way the series portrays urban fantasy through that lens is what makes it so different, especially from what you would normally expect from Japanese RPGs.\".<ref name=\"PersonaSummery\"/> ''[[Nintendo Power]]'', in an article concerning the ''Megami Tensei'' series, cited the ''Persona'' series' \"modern-day horror stories\" and \"teams of Japanese high-school kids\" as the perfect example of the franchise.<ref name=\"NintendoShin\"/> ''Persona'' was mentioned in 1999 by [[GameSpot]]'s Andrew Vestal as a game that deserved attention despite not aging well, saying \"Examining ''Persona'' reveals three of the traits that make the series so popular - and unique - amongst RPG fans: demonology, negotiation, and psychology\".<ref name=\"GSpersona\"/> The game has been named as a cult classic.<ref name=\"PersonaLocal\"/> ''Persona 3'' was named by RPGamer as the greatest RPG of the past decade in 2009, and RPGFan listed ''Persona 3'' and ''4'' in second and fourth place respectively in their similar 2011 list.<ref name=\"RPGdecade\"/><ref name=\"RPGFlist\"/> ''Persona 3'' was listed by [[Gamasutra]] as one of the 20 essential RPGs for players of the genre.<ref name=\"GamaList\"/> ''Persona 4'' was also listed by ''[[Famitsu]]'' as one of the greatest games of all time in a 2010 list.<ref name=\"GemFamitsu\"/>\n\nAs well as gaining critical acclaim, the series has been the subject of controversy over its content. This controversy began with the localized banner title of the original ''Persona'', which raised concerns due to its religious implications.<ref name=\"PersonaLocal\"/> Kurt Katala, writing for [[1UP.com]] in 2006 about the controversial content of the ''Megami Tensei'' franchise as a whole, mentioned ''Innocent Sin''{{'s}} references to homosexuality, schoolyard violence, and Nazism, considering them possible reasons why the game was not originally released outside of Japan.<ref name=\"1UPcontroversy\"/> In 1UP.com's 2007 game awards, which ran in the March 2008 issue of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'', ''Persona 3'' was given the \"Most controversial game that created no controversy\" award: the writers said \"[[Rockstar Games|Rockstar]]'s [[Hot Coffee mod|Hot Coffee sex scandal]] and ''[[Bully (video game)|Bully]]''{{'s}} boy-on-boy kissing's got nothing on this PS2 role-player's suicide-initiated battles or subplot involving student-teacher dating\".<ref name=\"EdgeControversy\"/> ''Persona 4'' has in turn been examined by multiple sites over its portrayal of character sexuality and gender identity.<ref name=\"GamaSexuality\"/><ref name=\"RPGFpersona4\"/><ref name=\"KotakuP4\"/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Related media==\nThe first [[anime]] adaptation of the ''Persona'' series, a television series titled ''[[Persona: Trinity Soul]]'', aired in 2008.

[[Sega]] began handling North American publishing duties in 2016 under the Atlus brand name.}} Focusing around a series of [[role-playing video game]]s, ''Persona'' is a spin-off from Atlus' ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' franchise. The first entry in the series, ''[[Revelations: Persona]]'',{{efn|This game is generally referred to as ''Persona 1'' or just ''Persona'' rather than by its full title.}} was released in 1996 for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]. The series has had several more entries produced, with the most recent, ''[[Persona 5 Royal]]'', being released in 2020. Numerous spin-offs have also been developed. The series takes its title from beings summoned by characters in battle, manifesting from their [[psychological persona]].\n\n''Persona'' began as a spin-off based on the positively-received high school setting of ''[[Shin Megami Tensei If...]]'' (1994). ''Persona''{{'s}} core features include a group of students as the main cast, a [[silent protagonist]] similar to the mainline ''Megami Tensei'' franchise, and combat using [[#Personas|Personas]]. Since the release of ''[[Persona 3]]'' in 2006, the main series has used a [[Dating sim|social simulation]] function called Social Links, which are directly linked to how Personas evolve. Character designs are by series co-creator [[Kazuma Kaneko]] (''Persona'' and the ''Persona 2'' duology) and [[Shigenori Soejima]] (''Persona 3'' onwards). Its overall theme is exploration of the human psyche and how the characters find their true selves. The series' recurring concepts and design elements draw on [[Jungian psychology]] and [[Archetypal pedagogy|archetypes]], along with religion, mythology, and literature.\n\n''Revelations: Persona'' was the first role-playing ''Megami Tensei'' game to be released outside of Japan. Beginning with ''[[Persona 2: Eternal Punishment]]'', the English localizations began to remain faithful to the Japanese versions at the insistence of Atlus. The series is highly popular internationally, becoming the best-known ''Megami Tensei'' spin-off and establishing Atlus and the ''Megami Tensei'' franchise in North America. Following the release of ''Persona 3'' and ''4'', the series also established a strong following in Europe. The series has since gone on to ship over 11 million copies worldwide, outselling its parent franchise. There have been numerous adaptations, including [[anime]] television series, films, [[novelization]]s, [[manga]]s, [[stage plays]], [[radio drama]]s, and musical concerts.\n\n==Games==\n{{VG timeline\n| 1996 = ''[[Revelations: Persona]]''\n| 1999 = ''[[Persona 2: Innocent Sin]]''\n| 2000 = ''[[Persona 2: Eternal Punishment]]''\n| 2006 = ''[[Persona 3]]''\n| 2008 = ''[[Persona 4]]''\n| 2016 = ''[[Persona 5]]''\n}}\n\n===Main series===\n* '''''[[Revelations: Persona]]''''' is the first entry in the series, was released in Japan and North America for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in 1996.<ref name=\"PersonaSales\"/><ref name=\"FamRevelations\"/> A port to [[Microsoft Windows]] was released in Japan in 1999.<ref name=\"PersonaWindows\"/> The game was later ported to the [[PlayStation Portable]] (PSP): it was published in 2009 in Japan and North America as physical and digital releases, and 2010 in Europe as a digital release.<ref name=\"AndriaPSP\"/><ref name=\"SilInterview\"/><ref name=\"PersonaPSN\"/> Set in the town of Mikage-cho, it follows a group of high school students from St. Hermelin High, who are forced to confront an outbreak of demons in their hometown.<ref name=\"Persona3clubB\"/>\n* '''''[[Persona 2: Innocent Sin]]''''' is the second entry in the series, released in Japan for the PlayStation in 1999.<ref name=\"PersonaSales\"/> After the success of ''Persona''{{'s}} PSP port, a port of ''Innocent Sin'' was greenlit.

The way battles initiate varies between [[random encounter]]s (''Persona'', ''Persona 2'') or running into models representing enemy groups (''Persona 3'' onwards). Battles are governed by a [[Turn-based|turn-based system]], where the player party and enemies each attack the opposing side. Actions in battle include standard physical attacks using short-range melee or long-range projectile weapons, magical attacks, using items, guarding, and under certain conditions escaping from battles. During battle, either side can strike an enemy's weakness, which deals more damage than other attacks.<ref name=\"ISmanual\"/><ref name=\"manualP4\"/><ref name=\"GSpersona3\"/><ref name=\"PSPmanual\"/><ref name=\"P5Kotaku\"/> Starting with ''Persona 3'', landing a critical hit grants the character an extra turn. If all enemies are knocked down by critical hits, the party can perform an \"All Out Attack\", with all party members attacking at once and dealing high damage. Each party member is manually controlled by the player in all but one ''Persona'' title: in ''Persona 3'', all the party apart from the main character are controlled by an AI-based command system. The general gameplay has remained consistent across all ''Persona'' games.<ref name=\"ISmanual\"/><ref name=\"manualP4\"/><ref name=\"P4weather\"/><ref name=\"P5Kotaku\"/><ref name=\"manual3132\"/><ref name=\"P4GoldReview\"/>\n\nEach ''Persona'' game also includes unique elements. In ''Persona'', battles take place on a grid-based battlefield, with characters' and enemies' movements dictated by their placement on the battlefield.<ref name=\"RPG2\"/> This system was abandoned for the ''Persona 2'' games: the party has free movement across the battlefield, and is assigned a set of moves which can be changed in the menu during and in between battles.<ref name=\"ISmanual\"/><ref name=\"GSreviewEP\"/> In ''Persona'' and ''Persona 3'', there is a [[lunar phase]] tied to gameplay, time progression, and the plot. In ''Persona 4'', this was changed to a weather-based system, where changes in the weather keyed to the story affected enemy behavior.<ref name=\"P4weather\"/><ref name=\"Manual1\"/><ref name=\"PlayInterviews\"/> ''Persona 5'' introduces elements such as [[Platform game|platforming]] and [[Stealth game|stealth]] gameplay to dungeon exploration.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"P5Kotaku\"/><ref name=\"P5FamBattle\"/> The All-Out Attack can be initiated in a \"Hold-Up\" session, triggered when all enemies are knocked down.<ref name=\"DigiGameplay\"/>\n\n====Personas====\nA defining aspect of the series is the use of the \"Persona\", which are physical manifestations of a person's psyche and subconscious used for combat.<ref name=\"GIpersona\"/> The main Personas for the cast used up to ''Persona 3'' were inspired by [[Classical mythology|Graeco-Roman mythology]]. ''Persona 4''{{'s}} were based on [[Japanese deities]]; while ''Persona 5'' used characters inspired by fictional and historical outlaws and thieves.<ref name=\"P4guide\"/><ref name=\"SilP4\"/><ref name=\"GemP5outlaw\"/> The summoning ritual for Personas in battle varies throughout the series: in early games, the party gains the ability to summon through a short ritual after playing a parlor game; in ''Persona 3'', they fire a gun-like device called an Evoker at their head; in ''Persona 4'', they summon their Personas using [[Tarot|Tarot cards]]; in ''Persona 5'', they are summoned through the characters' masks.<ref name=\"GIpersona\"/><ref name=\"ShackMasks\"/>\n\nPersonas are used for types of physical attack and magical attacks, along with actions such as healing and curing or inflicting [[status effect]]s.<ref name=\"ISmanual\"/><ref name=\"manualP4\"/><ref name=\"RPG2\"/><ref name=\"PSPmanual\"/><ref name=\"GIpersona\"/><ref name=\"manual2627\"/> For all ''Persona'' games, all playable characters start out with an initial Persona, which can evolve into other Personas through story-based events and use during battle.<ref name=\"ISmanual\"/><ref name=\"P4GoldReview\"/><ref name=\"manual2627\"/> In multiple ''Persona'' games, two or more Personas can be summoned at once to perform a powerful Fusion Spell.<ref name=\"ISmanual\"/><ref name=\"P4GoldReview\"/><ref name=\"GSreviewEP\"/> In ''Persona 3'', ''4'' and ''5'', only the main character can wield and change between multiple Personas; the other characters use a single Persona.<ref name=manualP4/><ref name=\"manual2627\"/> During the course of the game, the player acquires more Personas through a system of Skill Cards, represented by [[Major Arcana]] Tarot cards. Each skill card represents a different Persona family, which in turn hold their own abilities inherent to that family. Multiple Personas can be fused together to create a new Persona with improved and inherited abilities: these range from fusing two Personas in the ''Persona 2'' duology to up to twelve in ''Persona 4''.<ref name=\"ISmanual\"/><ref name=\"manualP4\"/><ref name=\"RPG2\"/><ref name=\"PSPmanual\"/><ref name=\"manual2627\"/><ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/> Starting with ''Persona 3'', the main protagonist of each game has an ability known as \"Wild Card\", an ability to summon multiple Personas represented by the Fool Arcana.<ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/>\n\n====Social Links and Negotiation====\n\"Social Links\" is a system introduced in ''Persona 3'' that is a form of character interaction tied to the growth of Personas. During their time outside battle, the main character can interact with and grow a particular Social Link, which acts as an independent character growth system tied to a Persona family or Arcanum. As the main character's relationship with the character representing a Social Link grows, its rank is raised and more powerful Personas related to the Social Link's assigned Arcanum can be summoned and fused.<ref name=\"manualP4\"/><ref name=\"GSpersona3\"/> Attributes related to the main character's social life can also be used to improve their Persona abilities, such as their academic abilities and social aptitude.<ref name=\"manualP4\"/><ref name=\"manual2627\"/> An enhanced version of the Social Link system, known as \"Confidants\", appeared in ''Persona 5''.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/>\n\nIn ''Persona'', the ''Persona 2'' duology, and ''Persona 5'', there is also a \"Negotiation\" mechanic carried over from the ''Megami Tensei'' series, in which player characters can talk with enemies and provoke certain actions depending on their dialogue choices. Some responses yield Skill Cards for use in creating new Personas.<ref name=\"ISmanual\"/><ref name=\"RPG2\"/> Negotiation was removed from ''Persona 3'' and ''Persona 4'', although Atlus staff considered the Social Link system and aspects of Persona fusion to be a \"disguised\" version of it.<ref name=\"P4local\"/> In ''Persona 5'', they can be initiated during a \"Hold Up\" session; Shadows can be persuaded to join the party as a new Persona if the Negotiation is successful, the player does not already have them, and is at an appropriate experience level.<ref name=\"DigiGameplay\"/><ref name=\"PolyGameplayP5\"/>\n\n===Setting and themes===\nThe ''Persona'' series takes place in modern-day [[Japan]] and focuses on a group of high school students, with the exception to this being ''Eternal Punishment'', which focused on a group of adults.<ref name=\"GIpersona\"/><ref name=\"1upPersona4\"/> The setting has been described as [[urban fantasy]], with extraordinary events happening in otherwise normal locations.<ref name=\"PersonaSummery\"/> The typical setting used is a city, with a noted exception being the rural town setting of ''Persona 4''.<ref name=\"1upPersona4\"/> Although they are typically stand-alone games that only share thematic elements, the ''Persona'' games share a continuity, with elements from previous games turning up in later ones.<ref name=\"GIpersona\"/><ref name=\"1upPersona4\"/> ''Persona'' and the ''Persona 2'' games shared narrative elements which were concluded with ''Eternal Punishment'', so ''Persona 3'' started out with a fresh setting and characters.<ref name=\"1upPersona3\"/> The first in the series is ''Persona'', set in the year 1996. This is followed by the events of ''Innocent Sin'' and ''Eternal Punishment'' in 1999. At the end of ''Innocent Sin'', the main characters rewrite events to avert the destruction of Earth, creating the ''Eternal Punishment'' reality, with the original reality becoming an isolated Other Side. ''Persona 3'' and subsequent games stem from ''Eternal Punishment''.<ref name=\"Persona3clubB\"/><ref name=\"PersonaWorld\"/> ''Persona 3'' is set from 2009 to 2010, and ''Persona 4'' is set from 2011 to 2012. The ''Persona 4 Arena'' games and ''Dancing All Night'' take place in the months following ''Persona 4''.<ref name=\"Persona3clubB\"/><ref name=\"SilArena\"/><ref name=\"GemDancing\"/> In contrast, ''Persona 5'' is set in a non-specific year referred to as \"20XX\".<ref name=\"P5year\"/> The ''Persona Q'' series takes place in a separate enclosed world in which the characters of ''Persona 3'', ''4'', and ''5'' are drawn into from their respective time periods.<ref name=\"DengPQ\"/>\n\nA central concept for the series is the [[collective unconscious]], a place generated by the hearts of humanity and from which Personas are born.<ref name=\"Persona3clubB\"/><ref name=\"PersonaWorld\"/> According to the official ''Persona Club P3'' book, the collective unconscious was generated by the primitive life on Earth as a means of containing the spiritual essence of Nyx, a space-born being whose presence would cause the death of all life on Earth. Her body was damaged by the impact and became the moon, while her psyche was left on the surface and locked away at the heart of the collective unconscious. The fragments of Nyx's psyche, known as \"Shadows\", are both a threat and a crucial part of humanity's existence. To further help defend against hostile Shadows, people generated the deities that exist within the collective unconscious, many of which manifest as Personas. Nyx appears in ''Persona 3'' as the antagonist.<ref name=\"Persona3clubA\"/> The major dungeon locations in each game are generated by the latent wishes and desires of humans and are generally used by another force for their own ends.<ref name=\"PMythDetail\"/> A recurring location appearing in most of the games is the \"Velvet Room\", a place between reality and unconsciousness created by Philemon that changes form depending on the psyche of its current guest. Its inhabitants, led by an enigmatic old man called Igor, aid the main characters by helping them hone their Persona abilities. While normally inaccessible and invisible to all except those who forged a contract with the room, others can be summoned alongside the guest, intentionally or otherwise.<ref name=\"FamVelvet\"/><ref name=\"PersonaDVD\"/><ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/><ref>{{cite video game |developer=[[Atlus]] |title=Persona 3 |date=August 14, 2007 |quote='''Junpei:''' Hey, wait a second!

I only summoned you here that we might say our farewells. I am rather surprised, though...I did not expect your friends to follow you here.}}</ref>\n\nThe main character of each ''Persona'' game is a [[silent protagonist]] representing the player, with a manner described by the series' director as \"silent and cool\".<ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> When the writer for new story content in ''Eternal Punishment''{{'s}} PSP version wished for the main character to have spoken dialogue, this was vetoed as it went against the series tradition.<ref name=\"AtlusBlog\"/> Two recurring characters generated by the collective unconscious are Philemon and Nyarlathotep, the respective representatives of the positive and negative traits of humanity.<ref name=\"Persona3clubB\"/> In ''Innocent Sin'', the two reveal that they are engaged in a proxy contest as to whether humanity can embrace its contradictory feelings and find a higher purpose before destroying itself.<ref name=\"PersonaWorld\"/> Philemon makes appearances in later ''Persona'' games as a blue butterfly.<ref name=\"P4guide\"/><ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/> Many of the major antagonists in the series are personifications of death generated by the human subconscious.<ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/> The central theme of the ''Persona'' series is exploration of the human psyche and the main characters discovering their true selves.<ref name=\"AtlusTheme\"/> The stories generally focus on the main cast's interpersonal relationships and psychologies.<ref name=\"EshidaInterview\"/> There is also an underlying focus on \"the human soul\".<ref name=\"PlayInterview\"/>\n\nMany of the concepts and characters within the series ([[Persona (psychology)|Personas]], [[Shadow (psychology)|Shadows]], Philemon) use [[Jungian psychology]] and [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]].<ref name=\"PersonaDVD\"/> A recurring motif are the \"masks\" people wear during everyday life, which ties back to their Personas. This motif was more overtly expressed in ''Persona 5'' through the main casts' use of masks in their thief guises.<ref name=\"GIinterview\"/><ref name=\"P5magazine\"/> The dual lives of the main casts are directly inspired by these themes.<ref name=\"PMythDetail\"/> Each game also includes specific themes and motifs. ''Persona 2'' focuses on the effect of rumors on the fabric of reality (referred to by the developers as \"the power of [[Kotodama]]\"); ''Persona 3'' employs themes involving depression and the darkness within people; ''Persona 4'' focuses on how gossip and the media influences people's views of others; and ''Persona 5'' shows how the main characters pursue personal freedom in a restrictive modern society.<ref name=\"P4guide\"/><ref name=\"PersonaSummery\"/><ref name=\"Persona5Theme\"/> A recurring element in the earlier entries is \"[[Zhuangzi (book)#The Butterfly Dream|The Butterfly Dream]]\", a famous story by the Chinese philosopher [[Zhuang Zhou]]. It ties in with the series' themes, and also with Philemon's frequent appearances as a butterfly.<ref name=\"Persona3clubB\"/> Philemon's original appearance was based on Zhuang Zhou.<ref name=\"PersonaDVD\"/> The character [[Nyarlathotep]] is based on the character of the same name from [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s [[Cthulhu Mythos]], and the Mythos as a whole is frequently referenced in ''Persona 2''.<ref name=\"P4guide\"/><ref name=\"Persona2book1\"/> The Velvet Room was based on the [[Black and White Lodges|Black Lodge]] from ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', while Igor and his assistants are all named after characters from [[Mary Shelley]]'s novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' and its adaptations.<ref name=\"PersonaDVD\"/><ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/>\n\n==Development==\nThe ''Persona'' series was first conceived after the release of ''[[Shin Megami Tensei If...]]'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]]. As the high school setting of ''If...'' had been positively received, Atlus decided to create a dedicated subseries focusing on the inner struggles of young adults.<ref name=\"PlayInterview\"/> The focus on high school life was also decided upon due to the experiences of the series' creators, [[Kouji Okada]] and [[Kazuma Kaneko]]: according to them, as nearly everyone experiences being a student at some point in their lives, it was something everyone could relate to, representing a time of both learning and personal freedom. In their view, this approach helped players accept the series' themes and the variety of ideas included in each title. Kaneko in particular tried to recreate his experiences and the impact it had on him during his time with the series.<ref name=\"DVDfeature\"/> The main concept behind the first game was a ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' title that was more approachable for new and casual players than the main series. The abundance of casual games on the PlayStation reinforced this decision.<ref name=\"PersonaDVD\"/><ref name=\"PersonaStaff\"/> The game's title, {{Nihongo foot|''Megami Ibunroku'',|\u5973\u795e\u7570\u805e\u9332||lit. \"''Goddess' Odyssey''\"|group=Jp.}} represented the game's status as a direct spin-off from the series.<ref name=\"FamKaneko\"/> It was later dropped to further define ''Persona'' as a standalone series.<ref name=\"Persona2book1\"/> After the success of ''Persona'', ''Innocent Sin'' began development, retaining many of the original staff. During the writing of ''Innocent Sin'', it was decided that the world of ''Persona 2'' needed a different perspective than that of the current protagonist. This decision laid the groundwork for ''Eternal Punishment''.<ref name=\"Persona2book1\"/><ref name=\"Persona2book2\"/> Following this, the ''Persona'' series entered a hiatus while focus turned to other projects, including ''[[Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne]]''.<ref name=\"4GstoryP5\"/>\n\nThe conceptual ''Persona 3'' was submitted to Atlus in 2003 by [[Katsura Hashino]], who had worked as a designer for multiple ''Megami Tensei'' games and had been the director for ''Nocturne''. Gaining Atlus' approval of the concept, development started in the same year, after the completion of ''Nocturne'' and the ''[[Digital Devil Saga]]'' duology.<ref name=\"HashinoMessage1\"/><ref name=\"P3genesis\"/><ref name=\"HashinoMessage2\"/> ''Persona 3'' was part of Atlus' push to expand their player base outside of Japan.<ref name=\"4GstoryP5\"/> Ideas were being passed around about ''Persona 4'', but the game did not begin official development until after the release of ''Persona 3''.<ref name=\"PlayInterview\"/> Preparations for ''Persona 5''{{'s}} development began in 2010. The team decided to shift towards more challenging story themes, saying that the shift would be more drastic than that experienced with ''Persona 3''.<ref name=\"KotakuPersona\"/><ref name=\"GemP5\"/> ''Persona 4 Arena'' and its sequel were the first non-RPG collaborative project in the series: its success inspired the creation of both ''Persona Q'' and ''Dancing All Night''.<ref name=\"PQorigins\"/><ref name=\"P4Dorigins\"/>\n\nThe first three ''Persona'' games were developed by Atlus' internal R&D1 studio, the studio responsible for the mainline ''Megami Tensei'' games.<ref name=\"SMTdeveloper\"/> Beginning with ''Persona 3'', a dedicated team originally referred to as the 2nd Creative Production Department began handling development for the series. The team was later renamed P-Studio in 2012.<ref name=\"P3design\"/><ref name=\"PersonaDev1\"/><ref name=\"PersonaDev2\"/> Hashino remained in charge of the studio until the Japanese release of ''Persona 5'' in 2016, when he moved to found a new department, Studio Zero, to work on non-''Persona'' projects.<ref name=\"P5studioA\"/><ref name=\"P5studioB\"/> Aside from Atlus, other developers have helped develop entries in the ''Persona'' series. During the pre-production stage of ''Persona 4 Arena'', Hashino approached [[Arc System Works]] after being impressed by their work on the ''[[BlazBlue]]'' series.<ref name=\"IGNinterview\"/> For ''Dancing All Night'', development was initially handled by [[Dingo Inc.|Dingo]], but due to quality concerns Atlus took over primary development with Dingo being retained as a supporting developer.<ref name=\"AtlusDancing\"/>\n\n===Art design===\n[[File:Persona 3 AD.jpg|right|thumb|Promotional artwork for ''Persona 3'' showing some of the main cast and a Persona. It was created by [[Shigenori Soejima]], who has been the series character designer since.<ref name=\"SoejimaInterview\"/><ref name=\"P3Art\"/>]]\nThe two character artists for the ''Persona'' series are [[Kazuma Kaneko]], a central artist in the main ''Megami Tensei'' series who designed characters for the first three ''Persona'' games, and [[Shigenori Soejima]], who worked in a secondary capacity alongside Kaneko and took Kaneko's place as the character designer from ''Persona 3'' onwards.<ref name=\"PersonaDVD\"/><ref name=\"KanekoDesign\"/><ref name=\"OtakuKaneko\"/><ref name=\"GIsoejima\"/> While designing the characters for ''Persona'', Kaneko was inspired by multiple notable celebrities and fictional characters of the time, along with members of Atlus staff. In ''Persona'' and ''Innocent Sin'', the main characters all wore the same school uniforms, so Kaneko differentiated them using accessories.<ref name=\"PersonaDVD\"/><ref name=\"KanekoDesign\"/> For ''Eternal Punishment'', the main cast were adults, so Kaneko needed to rethink his design procedure. Eventually, he adopted the concept of ordinary adults, and gave them designs that would stand out in-game.<ref name=\"DVDfeature\"/>\n\nSoejima's first major work for the series was working on side characters for ''Persona 2'' alongside Kaneko.<ref name=\"PSsoejima\"/> Kaneko put Soejima in charge of the series' art direction after ''Persona 2'' as Kaneko did not want to imprint his drawing style on the ''Persona'' series, and also wanted Soejima to gain experience.<ref name=\"OtakuKaneko\"/> Soejima felt a degree of pressure when he was given his new role, as the series had accumulated a substantial following during Kaneko's tenure.<ref name=\"SoejimaInterview\"/> In a later interview, Soejima said that although he respected and admired Kaneko, he never consciously imitated the latter's work, and eventually settled into the role of pleasing the fans of the ''Persona'' series, approaching character designs with the idea of creating something new rather than referring back to Kaneko's work.<ref name=\"PlayInterviews\"/> For his character designs, Soejima uses real people he has met or seen, looking at what their appearance says about their personality. If his designs come too close to the people he has seen, he does a rough sketch while keeping the personality of the person in mind.<ref name=\"GIsoejima\"/> For his work on ''Persona Q'', his first time working with a [[Super deformed|deformed Chibi]] style due to its links with the ''[[Etrian Odyssey (series)|Etrian Odyssey]]'' series, Soejima took into account what fans felt about the characters. A crucial part of his design technique was looking at what made a character stand out, then adjusting those features so they remained recognizable even with the redesign.<ref name=\"GIsoejima\"/><ref name=\"PQusg\"/>\n\nStarting with ''Persona 3'', each ''Persona'' game has been defined by a different aesthetic and key color. It is one of the first artistic decisions made by the team: ''Persona 3'' has a dark atmosphere and serious characters, so the primary color was chosen as blue to reflect these and the urban setting. In contrast, ''Persona 4'' has a lighter tone and characters but also sports a murder-mystery plot, so the color yellow was chosen to represent both the lighter tones and to evoke a \"warning\" signal.<ref name=\"GIsoejima\"/> According to Soejima, blue was the \"color of adolescence\", and yellow was the \"color of happiness\".<ref name=\"PlayInterviews\"/> For ''Persona 5'', the color chosen was red, to convey a harsh feeling in contrast to the previous ''Persona'' games and tie in with the game's story themes. Its art style was described as a natural evolution from where ''Persona 4'' left off.<ref name=\"P5magazine\"/><ref name=\"Gematsu1\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe music of the ''Persona'' series has been handled by multiple composers. The one most associated with the series is [[Shoji Meguro]], who began working on ''Persona'' shortly after he joined Atlus in 1995. His very first composition for the game was \"Aria of the Soul\", the theme for the velvet room that became a recurring track throughout the series.<ref name=\"ShojiInterview\"/><ref name=\"Persona3Liners\"/><ref name=\"ShojiPersona\"/> During his initial work on the series, Meguro felt restricted by the limited storage space of the PlayStation's disc system, and so when he began composing for ''Persona 3'', which allowed for [[Streaming audio in video games|sound streaming]] due to increased hardware capacity, he was able to fully express his musical style. His main worry for his music in ''Persona 3'' and ''4'' was the singers' pronunciation of the English lyrics.<ref name=\"PlayInterviews\"/> He was unable to work on the ''Persona 2'' games as he was tied up with other projects, including ''[[Maken X]]''.<ref name=\"Persona2Meguro\"/> Meguro also served as the lead composer in ''Persona 5'', using elements of [[acid jazz]] and the game's themes for inspiration to achieve the right mood.<ref name=\"SilComposer\"/> The music for ''Innocent Sin'' and ''Eternal Punishment'' was handled by Toshiko Tasaki, Kenichi Tsuchiya, and Masaki Kurokawa. Tsuchiya had originally done minor work on ''Persona'', and found composing for the games a strenuous experience.<ref name=\"DengTsuchiya1\"/><ref name=\"ISmusic\"/><ref name=\"EPmusic\"/> Spin-offs, such as the ''Persona Q'' and ''Dancing'' subseries, are usually handled by other Atlus composers such as Atsushi Kitajoh, Toshiki Konishi, and Ryota Kozuka.<ref name=\"MusicPQ\"/>\n\n==Release==\nThe series consists of thirteen games, not counting re-releases and mobile games.<ref name=\"PersonaSales\"/> ''Persona'' was the first role-playing entry in the ''Megami Tensei'' franchise to be released outside of Japan, as previous entries had been considered ineligible due to possibly controversial content. As examples of this content were in a milder form for ''Persona'', the restrictions did not apply.<ref name=\"PersonaLocal\"/><ref name=\"FamOrigins\"/> According to Atlus, ''Persona'' and its sequel were to test player reactions to the ''Megami Tensei'' series outside of Japan.<ref name=\"SMTdeveloper\"/> The greater majority of ''Persona'' games were either first released on or exclusive to PlayStation platforms. This trend was broken with the release of ''Persona Q'' for the 3DS in 2014.<ref name=\"MCVpersona\"/> All the ''Persona'' games have been published by Atlus in Japan and North America.<ref name=\"SMTdeveloper\"/> An exception in Japan was the Windows port of ''Persona'', which was published by [[ASCII Corporation]].<ref name=\"PersonaWindows\"/> After 2016, due to Atlus USA's merger with Sega of America, [[Sega]] took over North American publishing duties, although the Atlus brand remained intact.<ref name=\"PersonaSega\"/>\n\nDue to the company not having a European branch, Atlus has generally given publishing duties to other third-party publishers with branches in Europe. This frequently results in a gap between North American and European release dates ranging from a few months to a year or more.<ref name=\"DesSega\"/><ref name=\"P4Arights\"/><ref name=\"P4Deurope\"/> For ''Persona 3'', Atlus gave publishing duties to [[Koei]].<ref name=\"P3eu\"/> For ''Persona 4'', European publishing was handled by [[Square Enix]].<ref name=\"P4eu\"/> ''Persona 4 Arena'' was originally published in Europe by Zen United after a long delay, but the digital rights were eventually returned to Atlus, resulting in the game being removed from PSN.<ref name=\"P4Arights\"/> Atlus ended up re-publishing the digital PlayStation version in Europe.<ref name=\"P4Anetwork\"/> They had previously digitally published the PSP port of ''Persona'' in Europe and Australia.<ref name=\"PersonaPSN\"/> ''Arena Ultimax'' was published in Europe by Sega, who had recently purchased Atlus' parent company. It was speculated that this could lead to a new trend that would shorten the release gap between North America and Europe.<ref name=\"DesSega\"/> A regular publishing partner was [[Ghostlight]], whose relations with Atlus went back to the European release of ''Nocturne''.<ref name=\"SilGhostlight\"/><ref name=\"EuroP2\"/> A more recent partner was [[Nippon Ichi Software|NIS America]], which published ''Persona 4 Golden'', ''Persona Q'', and ''Dancing All Night''.<ref name=\"NISp4d\"/><ref name=\"P4Gnis\"/><ref name=\"NISq\"/> Atlus' partnership with NIS America ended in 2016, with NIS America citing difficulties with the company since its acquisition by Sega as reasons for the split. As part of their statement, NIS America said that Atlus had become \"very picky\" about European partners, selecting those which could offer the highest minimal sales guarantee on their products.<ref name=\"NISend\"/> Sega of America and Atlus USA eventually entered into a partnership with European publishing company [[Deep Silver]] to publish multiple games in the region, including ''Persona 5''.<ref name=\"P5euPub\"/>\n\n===Localization===\nThe localizations for the ''Persona'' series are generally handled by translator Yu Namba of [[Atlus USA]], who also handles localization for multiple other ''Megami Tensei'' games.<ref name=\"P4local\"/><ref name=\"DesPanel\"/> Another prominent staff member was Nich Maragos, who worked with Namba on multiple ''Persona'' games until moving to [[Nintendo of America]] prior to 2015.<ref name=\"DesPanel\"/><ref name=\"MaragosNOA\"/> The localization of ''Persona'' was handled by a small team, which put a lot of pressure on them as they needed to adjust the game for Western audiences: the changes implemented included altering names, changing the appearance of characters, and removing numerous cultural references. An entire alternate main quest was also removed.<ref name=\"PersonaLocal\"/><ref name=\"DesPanel\"/><ref name=\"GamaLocal\"/> After ''Persona'', it was decided that future ''Persona'' games should be as faithful as possible to their original releases.<ref name=\"DesPanel\"/> Namba's first localization project for the series was ''Eternal Punishment''.<ref name=\"SMTnamba\"/> For the release of ''Innocent Sin'', there was a debate over whether to release it, as it contained potentially controversial content including allusions to [[Nazism]].<ref name=\"DesPanel\"/> In the end, due to staff and resource shortages, ''Innocent Sin'' was passed over for localization in favor of its sequel ''Eternal Punishment''.<ref name=\"PersonaLocal\"/> Later, when the company developed the PSP ports, the team released the ports of ''Persona'' and ''Innocent Sin'' overseas so fans attracted by ''Persona 3'' and ''4'' would be able to easily catch up with the rest of the series. The localization for ''Persona'' was completely redone, reverting all the previous altered content and restoring all previously cut content.<ref name=\"PersonaLocal\"/><ref name=\"GamaLocal\"/><ref name=\"4GamerMeguro\"/> The port of ''Eternal Punishment'' was not localized due to  \"unusual circumstances\", so the company released the original version on PSN instead.<ref name=\"PSblog\"/>\n\nFor the localizations of ''Persona 3'' and ''4'', the team incorporated as much of the original content as possible, such as using Japanese honorifics and keeping the game's currency as [[Japanese yen|yen]] rather than changing it. As a general rule, they incorporate cultural elements from the original versions unless they would not be understood by the player, such as with certain jokes.<ref name=\"P4local\"/> Nevertheless, some changes had to be made. In one instance, the character Mitsuru Kirijo was originally an English speaker, but her second language for the localized version was changed to French due to her cultured appearance. School tests also needed to be changed due to similar language-based issues.<ref name=\"DesPanel\"/> The Social Links were originally called {{Nihongo foot|\"Community\",|\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3|Komyuniti|group=Jp.}} but this was changed as the word \"Community\" had a very specific meaning in English. The new name was inspired by the way the character Igor made reference to the concept using words such as \"society\" and \"bonds\".<ref name=\"FamitsuLocalJP1\"/> Some in-game [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] references were also changed: in ''Persona 3'' references to the larger ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' series by a character in an in-game [[MMORPG]] were changed to reference earlier ''Persona'' games, while mentions of a fictional detective in ''Persona 4'' were altered to reference the Kuzunoha family from ''Eternal Punishment'' and the ''Devil Summoner'' series.<ref name=\"FamitsuLocalJP1\"/> Character names have also needed adjustment, such as the stage name of ''Persona 4'' character Rise Kujikawa, and the way characters referred to each other was adjusted to appeal more to a western audience.<ref name=\"FamitsuLocalJP1\"/><ref name=\"FamitsuLocalJP2\"/> ''Persona 5'' was also localized in this fashion.<ref name=\"SMTnamba\"/>\n\nThe localized English names of games have also been altered. The banner title for ''Persona'' was changed from ''Megami Ibunroku'' to ''Revelations'', principally because the team thought the latter name sounded \"cool\". The ''Revelations'' title was removed for ''Innocent Sin'' and ''Eternal Punishment''. After the successful release of ''Nocturne'', the \"''Shin Megami Tensei''\" moniker was added to the series title to help with Western marketing.<ref name=\"PersonaLocal\"/> This has not been the case for some games: ''Persona 4 Arena''{{'s}} original title, ''Persona 4: The Ultimate in Mayonaka Arena'', was shortened as it sounded \"awkward\", and the \"''Shin Megami Tensei''\" moniker was dropped as it would have made the title too long, which has been applied to every game in the series since.<ref name=\"P5WestDelay\"/><ref name=\"FamitsuLocalJP1\"/> The same change was made for ''Persona 4 Golden'', with the team also dropping \"''The''\" that was in the Japanese title because it would have sounded \"odd\" in English-speaking regions.<ref name=\"FamitsuLocalJP1\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n{{VG Series Reviews\n|gr = no\n|game1 = [[Revelations: Persona]]\n|mc1 = 78/100 (PS)<ref name=\"MetaPlayStation\"/><br />78/100 (PSP)<ref name=\"MetaPSP\"/>\n|game2 = [[Persona 2: Innocent Sin]]\n|mc2 = 75/100 (PSP)<ref name=\"MetaPortable\"/>\n|game3 = [[Persona 2: Eternal Punishment]]\n|mc3 = 83/100 (PS)<ref name=\"MetaPS\"/>\n|game4 = [[Persona 3]]\n|mc4 = 86/100<ref name=\"MetaP3ps2\"/><br />89/100 (''FES'')<ref name=\"MetaP3fes\"/><br />89/100 (''Portable'')<ref name=\"MetaP3psp\"/>\n|game5 = [[Persona 4]]\n|mc5 = 90/100<ref name=\"MetaP4ps2\"/><br />93/100 (''Golden'')<ref name=\"MetaP4vita\"/>\n|game6 = [[Persona 5]]\n|mc6 = 93/100<ref name=\"MetaP5\"/><br />95/100 (''Royal'')<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/persona-5-royal |title=Persona 5 Royal for PlayStation 4 Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=April 5, 2020}}</ref>\n}}\n\nBy December 2019, the series had sold over 11.1 million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"P5RSales\">{{cite web |last1=Romano |first1=Sal |title=Persona 5 worldwide shipments top 3.2 million; Persona 5 Royal Japanese shipments top 400,000 |url=https://gematsu.com/2019/12/persona-5-worldwide-shipments-top-3-2-million-persona-5-royal-japanese-shipments-top-400000 |website=Gematsu |accessdate=5 December 2019}}</ref> The first ''Persona'' was referred to at the time as a [[sleeper hit]], and the success of it and ''Eternal Punishment'' helped establish both Atlus and ''Megami Tensei'' in North America. In Europe, the series did not become established prior to the release of ''Persona 3'' and ''4'', both of which were highly successful in the region.<ref name=\"PersonaLocal\"/><ref name=\"MCVpersona\"/><ref name=\"GamespotPersonaReview\"/> According to Atlus CEO Naoto Hiraoka, the main turning point for the franchise was the release of ''Persona 3'', which was a commercial success and brought the series to the attention of the mainstream gaming community. ''Persona 4'' received an even better reception. The ''Persona'' series' success has allowed Atlus to build a strong player base outside of Japan, contributing to the success of other games such as ''[[Catherine (video game)|Catherine]]''.<ref name=\"MCVpersona\"/>{{efn|While primarily referring to and focusing on the European market, Hiraoka is speaking of the ''Persona'' series in general in the cited instances.}}\n\nThe ''Persona'' series has been referred to as the most popular spin-off from the ''Megami Tensei'' franchise, gaining notoriety and success in its own right.<ref name=\"GIpersona\"/><ref name=\"PersonaSummery\"/><ref name=\"TechSMT\"/> [[Io9]]'s James Whitbrook commented that while \"here in the west, we've got plenty of awesome urban fantasy, especially from a YA perspective. But what makes Persona interesting is that it's the familiar concept of Urban fantasy, the balance of the mundane \"normal\" life of the protagonists and the problems they have there with the fantastical nature of the supernatural world that lies beneath all that, from a Japanese perspective. Over here, that's much less common, and the way the series portrays urban fantasy through that lens is what makes it so different, especially from what you would normally expect from Japanese RPGs.\".<ref name=\"PersonaSummery\"/> ''[[Nintendo Power]]'', in an article concerning the ''Megami Tensei'' series, cited the ''Persona'' series' \"modern-day horror stories\" and \"teams of Japanese high-school kids\" as the perfect example of the franchise.<ref name=\"NintendoShin\"/> ''Persona'' was mentioned in 1999 by [[GameSpot]]'s Andrew Vestal as a game that deserved attention despite not aging well, saying \"Examining ''Persona'' reveals three of the traits that make the series so popular - and unique - amongst RPG fans: demonology, negotiation, and psychology\".<ref name=\"GSpersona\"/> The game has been named as a cult classic.<ref name=\"PersonaLocal\"/> ''Persona 3'' was named by RPGamer as the greatest RPG of the past decade in 2009, and RPGFan listed ''Persona 3'' and ''4'' in second and fourth place respectively in their similar 2011 list.<ref name=\"RPGdecade\"/><ref name=\"RPGFlist\"/> ''Persona 3'' was listed by [[Gamasutra]] as one of the 20 essential RPGs for players of the genre.<ref name=\"GamaList\"/> ''Persona 4'' was also listed by ''[[Famitsu]]'' as one of the greatest games of all time in a 2010 list.<ref name=\"GemFamitsu\"/>\n\nAs well as gaining critical acclaim, the series has been the subject of controversy over its content. This controversy began with the localized banner title of the original ''Persona'', which raised concerns due to its religious implications.<ref name=\"PersonaLocal\"/> Kurt Katala, writing for [[1UP.com]] in 2006 about the controversial content of the ''Megami Tensei'' franchise as a whole, mentioned ''Innocent Sin''{{'s}} references to homosexuality, schoolyard violence, and Nazism, considering them possible reasons why the game was not originally released outside of Japan.<ref name=\"1UPcontroversy\"/> In 1UP.com's 2007 game awards, which ran in the March 2008 issue of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'', ''Persona 3'' was given the \"Most controversial game that created no controversy\" award: the writers said \"[[Rockstar Games|Rockstar]]'s [[Hot Coffee mod|Hot Coffee sex scandal]] and ''[[Bully (video game)|Bully]]''{{'s}} boy-on-boy kissing's got nothing on this PS2 role-player's suicide-initiated battles or subplot involving student-teacher dating\".<ref name=\"EdgeControversy\"/> ''Persona 4'' has in turn been examined by multiple sites over its portrayal of character sexuality and gender identity.<ref name=\"GamaSexuality\"/><ref name=\"RPGFpersona4\"/><ref name=\"KotakuP4\"/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Related media==\nThe first [[anime]] adaptation of the ''Persona'' series, a television series titled ''[[Persona: Trinity Soul]]'', aired in 2008.
