Though he enjoyed the experience of shooting the film, he opted not to sign a three-film contract when it was over.  After eschewing a career in film and theatre, Ostrum became reluctant to speak about his one starring role.  In 1990, he began an annual tradition of speaking to schoolchildren about the film, and he became a subject of interest again when the 2005 film ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' was released to theaters.\n\nOstrum became interested in horses when he returned from shooting ''Willy Wonka'', and was particularly influenced by the veterinarian that tended to them.
