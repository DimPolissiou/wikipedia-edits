O'Rourke is noted for having run for the [[United States Senate]] in [[2018 United States Senate election in Texas|2018]], narrowly losing to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] incumbent [[Ted Cruz]]. He sought the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2020 Democratic nomination]] for [[President of the United States]].\n\nO'Rourke was born into a local political family in [[El Paso, Texas]], and is a graduate of [[Woodberry Forest School]] and [[Columbia University]].<ref name=\"WP2\" /> While studying at Columbia, O'Rourke began a brief music career as [[Bassist|bass guitarist]] in the [[post-hardcore]] band [[Foss (band)|Foss]].

{"title_page": "Go variants", "text_new": "{{Mergefrom|Sunjang baduk|Talk:Sunjang baduk|date=November 2019}}\n{{GoBoardGame}}\n\nThere are many variations of the simple rules of [[Go (board game)|Go]]. Some are ancient digressions, while other are modern deviations. They are often side events at tournaments, for example, the [[U.S. Go Congress]] holds a \"Crazy Go\" event every year.\n\n==National variants==\nThe difficulty in defining the rules of Go has led to the creation of many subtly different rulesets. They vary in areas like scoring method, ko, suicide, handicap placement, and how neutral points are dealt with at the end. These differences are usually small enough to maintain the character and strategy of the game, and are typically not considered variants. Different rulesets are explained in [[Rules of Go]].\n\nIn some of the examples below, the effects of rule differences on actual play are minor, but the tactical consequences are substantial.\n\n===Tibetan Go===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:TibetBoard.gif|thumb|150px|The starting position for Tibetan Go]] -->\n'''Tibetan Go''' is played on a 17\u00d717 board, and starts with six stones (called Bo) from each color placed on the third line as shown. White makes the first move.<ref>[http://senseis.xmp.net/?TibetanGo Tibetan Go (Sensei's Library)]</ref> There is a unique ko rule: a stone may not be played at an intersection where the opponent has just removed a stone. This ko rule is so different from other major rulesets that it alone significantly changes the character of the game.  For instance, snapbacks must be delayed by at least one move, allowing an opponent the chance to create life.  Finally, a player who occupies or surrounds all four corner points (the 1-1 points) receives a bonus of 40 points, plus another 10 if the player also controls the center point.\n\n===Sunjang Baduk===\n\nSunjang baduk is a different form of Go (baduk) that evolved in Korea, which dates to the 16th century.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://english.baduk.or.kr/sub01_01.htm?menu=f11 | publisher = Korean Baduk Association | title = History of Korean baduk | accessdate = 2008-11-13}}</ref> Its most distinctive feature is the prescribed opening. The starting position dictates the placement of 16 stones (8 black, 8 white) as shown, and the first move is prescribed for Black at the center of the board.

It is likely that Koreans played go in this form until it developed into Sunjang baduk in the 16th century. In the early 20th century, the top ten strongest players ranged from about 4 dan amateur to 2 dan professional in terms of strength.<ref name=\"Fairbairn\" />  From 1910\u20131945, Korea was a Japanese colony.

The name stems from a combination of the Korean words ''baduk'' and ''juntoo'' (\u201cbattle\u201d). It is played entirely in [[cyberspace]], and differs from standard Go in a number of ways, most noticeably in the way in which certain areas of the board are worth different points values. The other principal difference is that both players place three stones before the game begins, and may also place a special \u201chidden stone\u201d, which affects the board as a regular stone but is invisible to the opponent. Batoo became a short-lived fad among young people in Korea around 2011.\n\n==Variants altering the rules of play==\n\n===First Capture===\n{{Main|Capture Go}}\nThe first player to capture a stone wins. It was invented by Japanese professional Yasutoshi Yasuda, who describes it in his book ''Go As Communication''. Yasuda was inspired by the need for a medium to address the problem of bullying in Japan, but soon found that \"First Capture\" also works as an activity for senior citizens and even developmentally delayed individuals. He sees it as a game in its own right, not just as a prelude to Go, but also as a way to introduce simple concepts that lead to Go. For the latter purpose, he recommends progressing to \"Most Capture\", in which the player capturing the most stones wins. This variation is often called '''Atari Go''' in the West, where it is becoming increasingly popular as a preliminary means of introducing Go itself to beginners, since, afterward, it is natural to introduce the idea of capturing territory, not just the opponent's stones.\n\n===Miai-Go===\nIn '''Miai-Go''', each player plays two moves at once, and their opponent decides which of the two should stay on the board.\n\n===Stoical Go===\nIn '''Stoical Go''', invented by abstract game designer Luis Bola\u00f1os Mures, standard ko rules don't apply. Instead, it's illegal to make a capture if your opponent made a capture on the previous move. All other rules are the same as in Go. Suicide of one or more stones is not allowed, and area scoring is used.<ref>[http://senseis.xmp.net/?StoicalGo Stoical Go (Sensei's Library)]</ref>\n\nAll known forced Go cycles are impossible with this rule. The nature of the rule itself suggests that forced cycles are either impossible or astronomically rarer than they are in Go when the superko rule is not used.\n\nKo fights proceed in a similar manner to those of Go, with the difference that captures and moves answered by captures aren't valid ko threats. Although snapbacks are not possible in the basic variant (as it is necessary to make a ko threat before any consecutive capture occurs), they can be explicitly allowed with an extra rule while retaining the property that all known forced cycles are impossible.\n\n===Environmental Go===\n'''Environmental Go''', also called '''Coupon Go''',<ref name=\"Coupon Go\">[http://www.math.ias.edu/seminars/abstract?event=13782 Coupon Go | School of Mathematics]</ref>  invented by [[Elwyn Berlekamp]], adds an element of mathematical precision to the game by compelling players to make quantitative decisions.<ref>[http://senseis.xmp.net/?EnvironmentalGo Environmental Go (Sensei's Library)]</ref> In lieu of playing a stone, a player may take the highest remaining card from a pack of cards valued in steps of \u00bd from \u00bd to 20: the player's score will be the territory captured, plus the total value of cards taken. In effect, the players participate in a downward auction for the number of points they think ''sente'' is worth at each stage in the game.\nThe professional players Jiang Zhujiu and Rui Naiwei played the first Environmental Go game in April 1998. Since then the variant has seen little activity on the international scene.\n\n===Time Is Money Go===\nEach player begins the game with a decided upon amount of time (no byoyomi). At the end of the game, when the score is counted, the number of seconds remaining on each player's clock is added to their respective score.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\n===Cards Go===\nIn '''Cards Go''' players draw from a pack of cards contain instructions to play one of a fixed set of commonly occurring shapes.<ref>[http://senseis.xmp.net/?CardsGo Cards Go (Sensei's Library)]</ref> If the said shape cannot be placed on the board, then an illegal move is deemed to have been played, which necessitates resignation.\n\n===Multi-player Go===\n[[File:Multi Color Go.JPG|thumb|230px|A game of Go with stones of different colors]]\nIn '''Multi-player Go''', stones of different colors are used so that three or more players can play together. The rules must be somewhat altered to create balance in power, as those who play first (especially the first four, on a four-cornered board) have significant advantage.<ref name=\"di.fc.ul.pt\">http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/players.htm</ref>\n\nThere are various optional rules that enable cooperation between the players, e.g. division of captured stones among neighbors, or forming alliances for adding up territory points.<ref name=\"di.fc.ul.pt\"/>\nA variant called parallel multiplayer go also exists, where the moves are announced simultaneously. If two moves overlap, they count as passes.<ref name=\"di.fc.ul.pt\"/>\n\n===Paper and Pencil Go===\n'''Paper and Pencil Go''' is a Go variant that can be played with just paper and pencil.<ref>[http://senseis.xmp.net/?PaperAndPencilGo Paper and Pencil Go (Sensei's Library)]</ref> Unlike standard Go, games played under these rules are guaranteed to end in a finite number of moves, and no ko rule is needed. Nothing is ever rubbed out.  It differs from standard Go in the following ways:\n* Surrounded stones are not captured, but just marked. Points occupied by marked stones count as territory for the surrounding player, but neither player can play on them for the remainder of the game. This implies that any group which touches a marked stone is unconditionally alive.\n* Suicide is allowed, i.e., you can make a play such that one or more of your own stones become marked. \n* Area scoring is used.\n\n(Conventional Go can also be played on paper by drawing circles of different colors.  Captured stones are marked with a line.  Then if the square is replayed, a smaller circle is placed inside the larger circle.<ref>[http://senseis.xmp.net/?FreePrintablePaperAndPencilGoAndShogi Senseis Paper Go PDFs]</ref>)\n\n===Omino Go===\nAlso named '''Tetromino Go'''. Devised by R. Wayne Schmittberger, each player is allowed to play up to four stones in a turn, provided they are solidly connected on adjacent points. (There are five four-stone patterns possible, two three-stone patterns, and one two-stone pattern, ignoring rotations and reflections.) There is no komi; Black is restricted on his first turn to playing no more than two stones. The winner is determined by Chinese scoring: occupied and surrounded points each count 1 point; captured stones do not have point value. The inventor suggests a 15\u00d715 square-celled board using square-tiled pieces.<ref>{{cite book\n | last=Schmittberger\n | first=R.

A process of quantum-like collapse occurs when a stone is played in contact with one of the stones in an entangled pair.\n\n===Block Go===\n'''Block Go''' was a variant of Go played at the 20th Annual [[Computer Olympiad]] in which tetris pieces are utilized instead of go stones.\n\n==Variants for more than two players, but not altering the mechanism of the game==\n\n===Rengo===\nThis involves two teams of players taking either the Black or the White stones. Each player in the team must play in turn, playing out of sequence will normally result in a small penalty (usually three prisoners). Partners may not consult on how to play, or engage in any form of signaling. Communication between partners may only take the following forms listed below.\n\n* ''May we resign?'' can be answered with ''yes'' or ''no''\n* ''How much time is left?'' can be answered.\n* ''Whose turn is it?''\n\n===Pair Go===\n'''Pair Go''' is a gender specific form of Rengo, calling for teams composed of one male and one female member.<ref>[http://www.pairgo.or.jp/home.htm Pair Go]</ref> It was popularised by the Japan Pair Go Association as a means of increasing female participation in the game. They hoped that this increase in itself would add a new appeal to the game. The Ricoh Cup, the annual professional Pair Go world championship debuted in 1994.<ref>[http://www.pairgo.or.jp/RICOH/2009/past_results_e.htm Ricoh Cup Past Results]</ref> The International Pair Go Association sponsors an annual amateur world championship in Tokyo in November, which has been running uninterrupted since 1989.<ref>[http://www.pairgo.or.jp/amateur/index_e.htm Pair Go amateur world championship]</ref> They first introduced the variant to Europe at the 1992 European Congress in Canterbury, England. Amateur Pair Go tournaments have been held in the United States at the U.S. Go Congresses since 2005 at least <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.usgo.org/congress/2005/ |title=U.S. Go Congress 2005 |access-date=2009-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219191552/http://www.usgo.org/congress/2005/ |archive-date=2012-02-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and in Denver, Colorado.\n\n==Variants requiring memory of the position==\n\n===Blind Go===\nOne (as a handicap) or both of the players cannot see the board in this variant. Therefore, they have to remember the whole position. This is considered much more difficult than playing blind [[chess]]. Indeed, most club standard players can play blind chess{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}, but only professional players are able to complete a game of blind 19\u00d719 Go.\n<!-- from http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/18506/do-strong-go-players-play-simuls-like-in-chess-do-they-ever-play-blindfolded, http://senseis.xmp.net/?BaoYun it seems currently only one person in the world can play blindfolded. consider editing \"but only professional players are able to complete a game of blind 19\u00d719 Go\" -->\n\n===One Color Go===\nThe two players use stones of the same color. This variation is regarded as a useful tool for developing one's memory and reading skills by forcing both players to remember who placed each stone. An external program or a third person may be used to keep track of who captures what in case one or both players forget the true color of a stone.\n\n==Variants with limited knowledge of the position==\nThese variants are not purely strategic games, as the element of luck is quite important.\n\n===Shadow Go===\nThis game requires two players, a referee and three playing sets. Each player sees only his own board, while the referee can see them both and also has his own set. This variant is usually played on a 9\u00d79 board. Players place stones on their boards, with no knowledge of what other players are doing. A referee keeps track of the game on the central board. If any player makes an illegal move, the referee informs him about it (some play that the referee says only that the move is illegal, while some, that the player is told whether the intersection is occupied or there is illegal ko capture). The player is allowed to make another move.\n\n===Rengo Kriegspiel===\nThis is a crossover between rengo and shadow Go. There are two teams with two players each, a referee and five Go sets. The players move alternatingly as in rengo. Each player keeps track of their own moves on their own board; they are not informed about teammates' or opponents' moves. The referee keeps track of the complete game and informs a player if their move was illegal, in which case they can try again. The referee removes captured stones from all affected boards.<ref>Bob High, [http://www.usgo.org/resources/downloads/deviantgo.pdf Deviant Go] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725130631/http://www.usgo.org/resources/downloads/deviantgo.pdf |date=2008-07-25 }}, ''The American Go Journal'', Volume 24:1 Winter 1990</ref>\n\n==Non-standard boards==\nAlthough Go is most commonly played on a board with 19\u00d719 lines, 9\u00d79 and 13\u00d713 boards are also available. They are used by beginners and by players who want a game that finishes more quickly. Due to flexibility of configuration, the two smaller sizes are more often played on the online Go servers such as [[KGS Go Server]], and board sizes from 2\u00d72 to 38\u00d738 are also allowed.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:mkboard.png|thumb|150px|The [[Milton Keynes]] [[Go equipment#Board|Goban]]]] -->\nThe annual [[Milton Keynes]] Go Tournament has a popular side-event that is played on a stylised map of Milton Keynes.<ref>[http://www.britgo.org/clubs/mk/mkboard.html The Milton Keynes Go Board]</ref> Its non-conventional lattice presents some interesting possibilities.\n\nHarald Schwarz invented a Go variant that is played on a circular lattice.<ref>[http://www.youdzone.com/go.html Page about the circular lattice Go board]</ref>\n\n'''Toroidal''' is played on a two-dimensional [[torus|doughnut shaped]] surface.

Tactics become more elegant without the need for special border and corner cases ([[joseki]]) since a toroidal board has only \"middle\" space.\n\n'''TriGo''' uses a triangular-grid [[Go equipment|goban]], where each stone has up to six liberties. To compensate for this, there are several rule changes: [[ko rule|ko]] and superko are limited in scope, [[komidashi|komi]] is not used, and after the first stone is placed, every turn consists of placing two stones. After both players have passed a turn, the score is counted (the sum of captured stones and territory), and in the case of a draw the player passing first wins.\n\n'''TriPlan''', for three players, uses a triangular grid, where each stone has up to six liberties.  Stones can be captured in two ways.  If one player's stones are surrounded by those of ''one'' opponent, the surrounding player captures them and counts them as points at the end of the game.  If one player's stones are surrounded by those of ''both'' opponents, they must be played as the surrounded player's next turn. If a player resigns, the two other players will determine who continues the game against the other two. That player will play alone, aiming to achieve a higher minimum score at the end of the game. At the end all captured stones and all stones on the board are counted. If the player reach his achieved goal, he wins. If the lone player doesn't reach the goal, the other two win the game. If there were no resignations, the player with the most points wins.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcBTDLfHAJk video with german explanation of the rules]</ref>\n\n'''Other 2D''' variants can also be performed with [[Surface (topology)#Construction from polygons|edges joined in three other ways]], resulting in a topological [[Sphere#Topology|sphere]], [[Klein bottle]] or [[real projective plane]].  Multiple boards can be used to form other [[Riemann surface]]s.\n\n=== Other than 2D ===\n[[File:VirgilGriffith.jpg|thumb|200px|Diamond Go]]\n'''[[Alak (board game)|Alak]]''' is a Go-like game restricted to a single spatial [[dimension]].\nGo can be extended to [[three-dimensional space|three dimensions]].

Some are ancient digressions, while other are modern deviations. They are often side events at tournaments, for example, the [[U.S. Go Congress]] holds a \"Crazy Go\" event every year.\n\n==National variants==\nThe difficulty in defining the rules of Go has led to the creation of many subtly different rulesets. They vary in areas like scoring method, ko, suicide, handicap placement, and how neutral points are dealt with at the end. These differences are usually small enough to maintain the character and strategy of the game, and are typically not considered variants. Different rulesets are explained in [[Rules of Go]].\n\nIn some of the examples below, the effects of rule differences on actual play are minor, but the tactical consequences are substantial.\n\n===Tibetan Go===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:TibetBoard.gif|thumb|150px|The starting position for Tibetan Go]] -->\n'''Tibetan Go''' is played on a 17\u00d717 board, and starts with six stones (called Bo) from each color placed on the third line as shown. White makes the first move.<ref>[http://senseis.xmp.net/?TibetanGo Tibetan Go (Sensei's Library)]</ref> There is a unique ko rule: a stone may not be played at an intersection where the opponent has just removed a stone. This ko rule is so different from other major rulesets that it alone significantly changes the character of the game.  For instance, snapbacks must be delayed by at least one move, allowing an opponent the chance to create life.  Finally, a player who occupies or surrounds all four corner points (the 1-1 points) receives a bonus of 40 points, plus another 10 if the player also controls the center point.\n\n===Sunjang Baduk===\n\nSunjang baduk is a different form of Go (baduk) that evolved in Korea, which dates to the 16th century.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://english.baduk.or.kr/sub01_01.htm?menu=f11 | publisher = Korean Baduk Association | title = History of Korean baduk | accessdate = 2008-11-13}}</ref> Its most distinctive feature is the prescribed opening. The starting position dictates the placement of 16 stones (8 black, 8 white) as shown, and the first move is prescribed for Black at the center of the board. At the end of the game, stones inside friendly territory, which are irrelevant to boundary definition, are removed before counting territory.\n\n[[File:Sunjang Baduk starting position.png|thumb|Starting position for Sunjang baduk.]]\n\nIt became obscure in the 1950s when it was largely replaced by modern go due to Japanese influence.

This variation is often called '''Atari Go''' in the West, where it is becoming increasingly popular as a preliminary means of introducing Go itself to beginners, since, afterward, it is natural to introduce the idea of capturing territory, not just the opponent's stones.\n\n===Miai-Go===\nIn '''Miai-Go''', each player plays two moves at once, and their opponent decides which of the two should stay on the board.\n\n===Stoical Go===\nIn '''Stoical Go''', invented by abstract game designer Luis Bola\u00f1os Mures, standard ko rules don't apply. Instead, it's illegal to make a capture if your opponent made a capture on the previous move. All other rules are the same as in Go. Suicide of one or more stones is not allowed, and area scoring is used.<ref>[http://senseis.xmp.net/?StoicalGo Stoical Go (Sensei's Library)]</ref>\n\nAll known forced Go cycles are impossible with this rule. The nature of the rule itself suggests that forced cycles are either impossible or astronomically rarer than they are in Go when the superko rule is not used.\n\nKo fights proceed in a similar manner to those of Go, with the difference that captures and moves answered by captures aren't valid ko threats. Although snapbacks are not possible in the basic variant (as it is necessary to make a ko threat before any consecutive capture occurs), they can be explicitly allowed with an extra rule while retaining the property that all known forced cycles are impossible.\n\n===Environmental Go===\n'''Environmental Go''', also called '''Coupon Go''',<ref name=\"Coupon Go\">[http://www.math.ias.edu/seminars/abstract?event=13782 Coupon Go | School of Mathematics]</ref>  invented by [[Elwyn Berlekamp]], adds an element of mathematical precision to the game by compelling players to make quantitative decisions.<ref>[http://senseis.xmp.net/?EnvironmentalGo Environmental Go (Sensei's Library)]</ref> In lieu of playing a stone, a player may take the highest remaining card from a pack of cards valued in steps of \u00bd from \u00bd to 20: the player's score will be the territory captured, plus the total value of cards taken. In effect, the players participate in a downward auction for the number of points they think ''sente'' is worth at each stage in the game.\nThe professional players Jiang Zhujiu and Rui Naiwei played the first Environmental Go game in April 1998. Since then the variant has seen little activity on the international scene.\n\n===Time Is Money Go===\nEach player begins the game with a decided upon amount of time (no byoyomi). At the end of the game, when the score is counted, the number of seconds remaining on each player's clock is added to their respective score.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\n===Cards Go===\nIn '''Cards Go''' players draw from a pack of cards contain instructions to play one of a fixed set of commonly occurring shapes.<ref>[http://senseis.xmp.net/?CardsGo Cards Go (Sensei's Library)]</ref> If the said shape cannot be placed on the board, then an illegal move is deemed to have been played, which necessitates resignation.\n\n===Multi-player Go===\n[[File:Multi Color Go.JPG|thumb|230px|A game of Go with stones of different colors]]\nIn '''Multi-player Go''', stones of different colors are used so that three or more players can play together. The rules must be somewhat altered to create balance in power, as those who play first (especially the first four, on a four-cornered board) have significant advantage.<ref name=\"di.fc.ul.pt\">http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/players.htm</ref>\n\nThere are various optional rules that enable cooperation between the players, e.g. division of captured stones among neighbors, or forming alliances for adding up territory points.<ref name=\"di.fc.ul.pt\"/>\nA variant called parallel multiplayer go also exists, where the moves are announced simultaneously. If two moves overlap, they count as passes.<ref name=\"di.fc.ul.pt\"/>\n\n===Paper and Pencil Go===\n'''Paper and Pencil Go''' is a Go variant that can be played with just paper and pencil.<ref>[http://senseis.xmp.net/?PaperAndPencilGo Paper and Pencil Go (Sensei's Library)]</ref> Unlike standard Go, games played under these rules are guaranteed to end in a finite number of moves, and no ko rule is needed. Nothing is ever rubbed out.  It differs from standard Go in the following ways:\n* Surrounded stones are not captured, but just marked. Points occupied by marked stones count as territory for the surrounding player, but neither player can play on them for the remainder of the game. This implies that any group which touches a marked stone is unconditionally alive.\n* Suicide is allowed, i.e., you can make a play such that one or more of your own stones become marked. \n* Area scoring is used.\n\n(Conventional Go can also be played on paper by drawing circles of different colors.  Captured stones are marked with a line.  Then if the square is replayed, a smaller circle is placed inside the larger circle.<ref>[http://senseis.xmp.net/?FreePrintablePaperAndPencilGoAndShogi Senseis Paper Go PDFs]</ref>)\n\n===Omino Go===\nAlso named '''Tetromino Go'''. Devised by R. Wayne Schmittberger, each player is allowed to play up to four stones in a turn, provided they are solidly connected on adjacent points. (There are five four-stone patterns possible, two three-stone patterns, and one two-stone pattern, ignoring rotations and reflections.) There is no komi; Black is restricted on his first turn to playing no more than two stones. The winner is determined by Chinese scoring: occupied and surrounded points each count 1 point; captured stones do not have point value. The inventor suggests a 15\u00d715 square-celled board using square-tiled pieces.<ref>{{cite book\n | last=Schmittberger\n | first=R.

A process of quantum-like collapse occurs when a stone is played in contact with one of the stones in an entangled pair.\n\n===Block Go===\n'''Block Go''' was a variant of Go played at the 20th Annual [[Computer Olympiad]] in which tetris pieces are utilized instead of go stones.\n\n==Variants for more than two players, but not altering the mechanism of the game==\n\n===Rengo===\nThis involves two teams of players taking either the Black or the White stones. Each player in the team must play in turn, playing out of sequence will normally result in a small penalty (usually three prisoners). Partners may not consult on how to play, or engage in any form of signaling. Communication between partners may only take the following forms listed below.\n\n* ''May we resign?'' can be answered with ''yes'' or ''no''\n* ''How much time is left?'' can be answered.\n* ''Whose turn is it?''\n\n===Pair Go===\n'''Pair Go''' is a gender specific form of Rengo, calling for teams composed of one male and one female member.<ref>[http://www.pairgo.or.jp/home.htm Pair Go]</ref> It was popularised by the Japan Pair Go Association as a means of increasing female participation in the game. They hoped that this increase in itself would add a new appeal to the game. The Ricoh Cup, the annual professional Pair Go world championship debuted in 1994.<ref>[http://www.pairgo.or.jp/RICOH/2009/past_results_e.htm Ricoh Cup Past Results]</ref> The International Pair Go Association sponsors an annual amateur world championship in Tokyo in November, which has been running uninterrupted since 1989.<ref>[http://www.pairgo.or.jp/amateur/index_e.htm Pair Go amateur world championship]</ref> They first introduced the variant to Europe at the 1992 European Congress in Canterbury, England. Amateur Pair Go tournaments have been held in the United States at the U.S. Go Congresses since 2005 at least <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.usgo.org/congress/2005/ |title=U.S. Go Congress 2005 |access-date=2009-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219191552/http://www.usgo.org/congress/2005/ |archive-date=2012-02-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and in Denver, Colorado.\n\n==Variants requiring memory of the position==\n\n===Blind Go===\nOne (as a handicap) or both of the players cannot see the board in this variant. Therefore, they have to remember the whole position. This is considered much more difficult than playing blind [[chess]]. Indeed, most club standard players can play blind chess{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}, but only professional players are able to complete a game of blind 19\u00d719 Go.\n<!-- from http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/18506/do-strong-go-players-play-simuls-like-in-chess-do-they-ever-play-blindfolded, http://senseis.xmp.net/?BaoYun it seems currently only one person in the world can play blindfolded. consider editing \"but only professional players are able to complete a game of blind 19\u00d719 Go\" -->\n\n===One Color Go===\nThe two players use stones of the same color. This variation is regarded as a useful tool for developing one's memory and reading skills by forcing both players to remember who placed each stone. An external program or a third person may be used to keep track of who captures what in case one or both players forget the true color of a stone.\n\n==Variants with limited knowledge of the position==\nThese variants are not purely strategic games, as the element of luck is quite important.\n\n===Shadow Go===\nThis game requires two players, a referee and three playing sets. Each player sees only his own board, while the referee can see them both and also has his own set. This variant is usually played on a 9\u00d79 board. Players place stones on their boards, with no knowledge of what other players are doing. A referee keeps track of the game on the central board. If any player makes an illegal move, the referee informs him about it (some play that the referee says only that the move is illegal, while some, that the player is told whether the intersection is occupied or there is illegal ko capture). The player is allowed to make another move.\n\n===Rengo Kriegspiel===\nThis is a crossover between rengo and shadow Go. There are two teams with two players each, a referee and five Go sets. The players move alternatingly as in rengo. Each player keeps track of their own moves on their own board; they are not informed about teammates' or opponents' moves. The referee keeps track of the complete game and informs a player if their move was illegal, in which case they can try again. The referee removes captured stones from all affected boards.<ref>Bob High, [http://www.usgo.org/resources/downloads/deviantgo.pdf Deviant Go] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725130631/http://www.usgo.org/resources/downloads/deviantgo.pdf |date=2008-07-25 }}, ''The American Go Journal'', Volume 24:1 Winter 1990</ref>\n\n==Non-standard boards==\nAlthough Go is most commonly played on a board with 19\u00d719 lines, 9\u00d79 and 13\u00d713 boards are also available. They are used by beginners and by players who want a game that finishes more quickly. Due to flexibility of configuration, the two smaller sizes are more often played on the online Go servers such as [[KGS Go Server]], and board sizes from 2\u00d72 to 38\u00d738 are also allowed.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:mkboard.png|thumb|150px|The [[Milton Keynes]] [[Go equipment#Board|Goban]]]] -->\nThe annual [[Milton Keynes]] Go Tournament has a popular side-event that is played on a stylised map of Milton Keynes.<ref>[http://www.britgo.org/clubs/mk/mkboard.html The Milton Keynes Go Board]</ref> Its non-conventional lattice presents some interesting possibilities.\n\nHarald Schwarz invented a Go variant that is played on a circular lattice.<ref>[http://www.youdzone.com/go.html Page about the circular lattice Go board]</ref>\n\n'''Toroidal''' is played on a two-dimensional [[torus|doughnut shaped]] surface. It can be played on a computer app<ref>[http://torogo.org Torogo - Free Android Game of Toroidal Go] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525034103/http://www.torogo.org/ |date=2015-05-25 }}</ref> or simulated on a standard board, but requires imagination on the part of the players to perform an abstract join at the edges. Tactics become more elegant without the need for special border and corner cases ([[joseki]]) since a toroidal board has only \"middle\" space.\n\n'''TriGo''' uses a triangular-grid [[Go equipment|goban]], where each stone has up to six liberties. To compensate for this, there are several rule changes: [[ko rule|ko]] and superko are limited in scope, [[komidashi|komi]] is not used, and after the first stone is placed, every turn consists of placing two stones. After both players have passed a turn, the score is counted (the sum of captured stones and territory), and in the case of a draw the player passing first wins.\n\n'''TriPlan''', for three players, uses a triangular grid, where each stone has up to six liberties.  Stones can be captured in two ways.  If one player's stones are surrounded by those of ''one'' opponent, the surrounding player captures them and counts them as points at the end of the game.  If one player's stones are surrounded by those of ''both'' opponents, they must be played as the surrounded player's next turn. If a player resigns, the two other players will determine who continues the game against the other two. That player will play alone, aiming to achieve a higher minimum score at the end of the game. At the end all captured stones and all stones on the board are counted. If the player reach his achieved goal, he wins. If the lone player doesn't reach the goal, the other two win the game. If there were no resignations, the player with the most points wins.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcBTDLfHAJk video with german explanation of the rules]</ref>\n\n'''Other 2D''' variants can also be performed with [[Surface (topology)#Construction from polygons|edges joined in three other ways]], resulting in a topological [[Sphere#Topology|sphere]], [[Klein bottle]] or [[real projective plane]].  Multiple boards can be used to form other [[Riemann surface]]s.\n\n=== Other than 2D ===\n[[File:VirgilGriffith.jpg|thumb|200px|Diamond Go]]\n'''[[Alak (board game)|Alak]]''' is a Go-like game restricted to a single spatial [[dimension]].\nGo can be extended to [[three-dimensional space|three dimensions]].

Polk]]. He was  bishop of the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] [[Episcopal Diocese of Louisiana|Diocese of Louisiana]]. He resigned his ecclesiastical position to become a [[major general]] in the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate army]] (called \"[[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]]'s Fighting Bishop\"). His official portrait at the [[University of the South]] depicts him dressed as a bishop with his army uniform hanging nearby.\n\nHe is often erroneously named \"Leonidas K. Polk\". He had no middle name and never signed any documents as such. The errant \"K\" was derived from his listing in the ''post-bellum'' New Orleans press as \"Polk, Leon. (k)\", signifying \"killed in action\".{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nPolk was one of the more notable, yet controversial, [[political general]]s of the war. Recognizing his indispensable familiarity with the Mississippi Valley, [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]] commissioned his elevation to a high military position regardless of his lack of prior combat experience. He commanded troops in the [[Battle of Shiloh]], the [[Battle of Perryville]], the [[Battle of Stones River]], the [[Tullahoma Campaign]], the [[Battle of Chickamauga]], the [[Chattanooga Campaign]], and the [[Atlanta Campaign]]. He is remembered for his bitter disagreements with his immediate superior, the likewise-controversial General [[Braxton Bragg]] of the [[Army of Tennessee]], and for his general lack of success in combat. While serving under the command of General [[Joseph E. Johnston]], he was killed in action in 1864 during the [[Atlanta Campaign]].\n\n==Antebellum life==\nPolk was born in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], to Sarah Polk (''n\u00e9e'' Hawkins) and Colonel [[William Polk (colonel)|William Polk]], a [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] veteran and prosperous planter. He was of [[Scottish Americans|Scottish]] and [[Scots-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] ancestry.

During his senior year, he joined the Episcopal Church and was baptized in the Academy Chapel by Chaplain [[Charles P. McIlvaine]], who later became the Episcopal Bishop of Ohio. Polk had an impressive academic record, excelling in rhetoric and moral philosophy. He graduated eighth of 38 cadets on July 1, 1827, and was appointed a [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Second Lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] in the artillery.<ref name=Dupuy601>Dupuy, p. 601.</ref>\n\nPolk resigned his commission on December 1, 1827, so that he could enter the [[Virginia Theological Seminary]].

Moore agreed to ordain Polk as a [[deacon]] in April 1830; however, on a visit to Raleigh in March it was discovered that he had never been confirmed. To remedy the fact, before his ordination, he was hastily confirmed at [[St. John's Episcopal Church (Fayetteville, North Carolina)|St. John's Episcopal Church]] in Fayetteville, NC. He was then ordained a deacon as planned and a priest the following year.<ref name=Robins1537/> On May 6, 1830, Polk married Frances Ann Devereux, daughter of John Devereux and Frances Pollock; her mother was the granddaughter of Puritan theologian [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]].

Polk was commissioned a [[Major General (CSA)|major general]] on June 25, 1861, and ordered to command Department No. 2 (roughly, the area between the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Tennessee River]]).<ref name=Eicher432-3>Eicher, pp. 432-33.</ref> He committed one of the great blunders of the Civil War by dispatching troops to occupy [[Columbus, Kentucky]], in September 1861; the critical [[Border states (American Civil War)|border state]] of Kentucky had declared its [[Neutral country|neutrality]] between the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and the Confederacy, but Polk's action was instrumental in prompting the Kentucky legislature to request Federal aid to resist his advance, ending the state's brief attempt at neutrality and effectively ceding it to Union control for the remainder of the war.<ref>Woodworth, ''Jefferson Davis'', pp. 34-38; Noe, p. 8; Eicher, p. 432.</ref>\n\nDuring this period Polk argued about strategy with his subordinate, Pillow, and his superior, Gen. [[Albert Sidney Johnston]], commander of Confederate forces in the Western Theater. Resentful that his former West Point roommate was giving him orders, he submitted a letter of resignation to President Davis on November 6, but Davis rejected the request.<ref>Woodworth, ''Jefferson Davis'', pp. 58-60; Eicher, p. 432; Connelly, p. 21.</ref> Polk's command saw its first combat on November 7, 1861, in the minor, inconclusive [[Battle of Belmont]] between Polk's subordinate, [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brig.

Although not present on the battlefield himself, Polk was wounded nearby on November 11 when the largest cannon in his army, nicknamed \"Lady Polk\" in honor of his wife, exploded during demonstration firing. The explosion stunned Polk and blew his clothes off, requiring a convalescence of several weeks.\n\n===Army of Mississippi===\n{{quote box|align=right|width=35%|quote=Besides being a basically incompetent general, Polk had the added fault of hating to take orders.\n|source= \u2014[[Steven E. Woodworth]], ''Jefferson Davis and His Generals''<ref>Woodworth, ''Jefferson Davis'', p. 156.</ref>\n}}\nIn April 1862, Polk commanded the First Corps of Albert Sidney Johnston's [[Army of Mississippi]] at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] and continued in that role for much of the rest of the year under Beauregard, who had assumed command following the death of A. S. Johnston on the first day at Shiloh, and then under Gen. [[Braxton Bragg]]. At various times his command was considered a corps and at other times the \"Right Wing\" of the army. In the fall, during the [[Confederate Heartland Offensive|invasion of Kentucky]] by Bragg and Maj. Gen. [[Edmund Kirby Smith]], Polk was in temporary command of the Army of Mississippi while Bragg visited [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]] to preside over the inauguration of a Confederate governor for the state. Polk disregarded an order from Bragg to attack the flank of the pursuing Union Army near Frankfort.<ref>McWhiney, pp. 230, 300-08.</ref>\n\n{{quote box|align=right|width=35%|quote=Bragg thoroughly despised ... the genial but pompous and often incompetent Bishop Polk. Bragg considered Polk \"an old woman, utterly worthless\", especially at disciplining men. Unfortunately for Bragg and for the Confederacy as a whole, Polk remained a great favorite of Jefferson Davis despite carefully couched hints from Bragg, which protected the irritatingly self-righteous Polk from the increasingly sycophantic Bragg and made his appointment to wing command a political necessity.\n|source= \u2014Kenneth W. Noe, ''Perryville''<ref>Noe, p. 57.</ref>\n}}\nAt the [[Battle of Perryville]], Polk's right wing constituted the main attacking force against Maj. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]]'s [[Army of the Ohio]], but Polk was reluctant to attack the small portion of Buell's army that faced him until Bragg arrived at the battlefield. One of the enduring legends of the Civil War is that Polk witnessed his subordinate, Maj. Gen. [[Benjamin F. Cheatham]], advancing his division. Cheatham allegedly shouted, \"Give 'em hell, boys!\" and Polk, retaining the sensibility of his role as an Episcopal bishop, seconded the cheer: \"Give it to 'em boys; give 'em what General Cheatham says!\"<ref>McWhiney, pp. 314-16, McDonough, pp. 243-45.</ref>\n\n===Army of Tennessee===\nAfter Perryville, Polk began a year-long campaign to get Bragg relieved of command, hoping to use his close relationship with President Davis to accomplish his goal.<ref>McWhiney, pp. 328-29.</ref> Despite the failure of his Kentucky campaign, Bragg was retained in command, but this did nothing to reduce the enmity between Polk and Bragg. Polk was promoted to [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|lieutenant general]] on October 11, 1862, with date of rank of October 10. He became the second most senior Confederate of that rank during the war, behind [[James Longstreet]].<ref>Eicher, p. 808. [[Edmund Kirby Smith]] also outranked Polk (behind Longstreet), but he was later promoted to [[General (CSA)|full general]].</ref> In November, the Army of Mississippi was renamed the [[Army of Tennessee]] and Polk commanded its [[First Corps, Army of Tennessee|First Corps]] until September 1863.<ref>Eicher, pp. 433, 890.</ref>\n\nPolk fought under Bragg at the [[Battle of Stones River]] in late 1862 and once again Bragg's subordinates politicked to remove their army commander after an unsuccessful battle (the battle was tactically inconclusive, but Bragg was unable to stop the advance of the Union [[Army of the Cumberland]] under Maj. Gen. [[William S. Rosecrans]] and Bragg withdrew his army to [[Tullahoma, Tennessee]]). Bragg was also unsuccessful in resisting Rosecrans's advance in the [[Tullahoma Campaign]], which began to threaten the important city of [[Chattanooga]]. In the face of Rosecrans's expert maneuvering of his army, Polk counseled Bragg to retreat rather than stand and fight in their Tullahoma fortifications.<ref>Woodworth, ''Six Armies'', pp. 38-40; Connelly, pp. 130-32; McWhiney, pp. 377-79; Hallock, pp. 13-20.</ref>\n\nRosecrans eventually maneuvered Bragg out of Chattanooga and the Army of Tennessee withdrew into the mountains of northwestern Georgia with the Army of the Cumberland in hot pursuit. Bragg planned to attack and destroy at least one of Rosecrans's corps, advancing separately over mountainous roads. He was infuriated when Polk's division under Maj. Gen. [[Thomas C. Hindman]] failed to attack an isolated Union corps at [[Battle of Davis's Cross Roads|Davis's Cross Roads]] as ordered on September 11. Two days later, Polk disregarded orders from Bragg to attack another isolated corps, the second failed opportunity. At the [[Battle of Chickamauga]], Polk was given command of the Right Wing and the responsibility for initiating the attack on the second day of battle (September 20). He failed to inform his subordinates of the plan and his wing was late in attacking, allowing the Union defenders time to complete their field fortifications. Bragg wrote after the war that if it were not for the loss of these hours, \"our independence might have been won.\"<ref>Woodworth, ''Six Armies'', pp. 103, 106; Hallock, pp. 54-62, 71-74.</ref>\n\nChickamauga was a great tactical victory for Bragg, but instead of pursuing and destroying the Union Army as it retreated, he laid siege to it in Chattanooga, concentrating his effort against the enemies inside his army instead of his enemies from the North. He demanded an explanation from Polk on the bishop's failure to attack in time on September 20 and Polk placed the blame entirely on one of his subordinates, Maj. Gen. [[D. H. Hill]]. Bragg wrote to President Davis, \"Gen'l Polk by education and habit is unfit for executing the plans of others. He will convince himself his own are better and follow them without reflecting on the consequences.\" Bragg relieved Polk of his command and ordered him to Atlanta to await further orders. Although Polk protested the \"arbitrary and unlawful order\" to the Secretary of War and demanded a court of inquiry, he was not restored to his position and Davis once again retained Bragg in army command, despite the protestations of a number of his subordinate generals.<ref>Hallock, pp. 89-92; Woodworth, ''Jefferson Davis'', pp. 239-40; Connelly, pp. 247-48.</ref>\n\n===Mississippi===\nPresident Davis transferred his friend Polk to command the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana (December 23, 1863 \u2013 January 28, 1864) and then the Department of Alabama and East Mississippi (January 28 \u2013 May 4, 1864), giving him effective command of the state of Mississippi following the departure of Gen. [[Joseph E. Johnston]] to replace Bragg in command of the Army of Tennessee. Polk unsuccessfully attempted to oppose Maj. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]'s raid against [[Battle of Meridian|Meridian, Mississippi]], in February 1864. In May, he was ordered to take his forces and join with Johnston in resisting Sherman's advance in the [[Atlanta Campaign]]. He assumed command of the Third Corps of the Army of Tennessee on May 4.<ref>Woodworth, ''Jefferson Davis'', pp. 260, 274-75; Connelly, pp. 246-48, 294-95; Eicher, pp. 433, 891.</ref> His command remained commonly known as the \"[[Army of Mississippi]]\".\n\n===Atlanta Campaign and death===\nPolk brought more than 20,000 men with him to Georgia. Because of his elevated rank, he became the army's second in command under Johnston.  By using successive flanking maneuvers, Sherman forced Johnston to withdraw his army from strong defensive positions to protect the Confederate line of communication. This forced Johnston ever closer to the critically important city of Atlanta.<ref>McMurray, p. 62; Woodworth, ''Jefferson Davis'', p. 281.</ref>\n\n{{quote box|align=left|width=35%|quote=The army had suffered a severe loss. It was not that Polk had been a spectacular corps officer. His deficiencies as a commander and his personal traits of stubbornness and childishness had played no small role in several of the army's disasters in earlier times. The loss was one of morale and experience. Polk was the army's most beloved general, a representative of that intangible identification of the army with Tennessee.|source= \u2014Thomas L. Connelly, ''Autumn of Glory''<ref>Connelly, p. 358.</ref>\n}}\n\nOn June 14, 1864, Polk was scouting enemy positions near [[Battle of Marietta|Marietta, Georgia]], with his staff when he was killed in action by a Federal {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on}} [[Shell (projectile)|shell]] at [[Pine Mountain (Cobb County, Georgia)|Pine Mountain]].<ref>Welsh, p. 174.</ref> The artillery fire was initiated when Sherman spotted a cluster of Confederate generals \u2014 Polk, [[William J. Hardee]], and Johnston, with their staffs \u2014 in an exposed area.  He pointed them out to Maj. Gen. [[Oliver Otis Howard]], commander of the [[IV Corps (Union Army)|IV Corps]], and ordered him to fire upon them. [[Battery I, 1st Ohio Light Artillery|Battery I of the 1st Ohio Light Artillery]], commanded by Capt. [[Hubert Dilger]], obeyed the order within minutes.  The first round from the battery came close and a second came even closer, causing the men to disperse.  The third shell struck Polk's left arm, went through his chest, and exited hitting his right arm, then exploded against a tree; it nearly cut Polk in two.<ref>Smith, pp. 253-54. Foote, p. 356, credits Battery I, 1st Ohio Light Battery, commanded by Capt. Hubert Dilger. Polk's biographer, Joseph Parks, describes his death (pp. 382-83) without identifying the Union artillery responsible.</ref>{{clear}}\n\n==Legacy==\n{{quote box|align=right|width=35%|quote=My pen and ability is inadequate to the task of doing his memory justice.

Aytch''<ref>Watkins, p. 139.</ref>\n}}\n\nAlthough his record as a field commander was poor, Polk was immensely popular with his troops, and his death was deeply mourned in the Army of Tennessee. Polk's funeral service at [[St. Paul's Episcopal Church (Augusta, Georgia)|Saint Paul's Church]] in [[Augusta, Georgia]], was one of the most elaborate during the war. His friend Bishop [[Stephen Elliott (bishop)|Stephen Elliott]] of Georgia presided at the service, delivering a stirring funeral oration. He was buried in a location under the present-day altar. The church has a monument to the bishop near the altar, and the original grave site can be visited.

(In his August 1856 letter to Bishop Elliott, he expounded on the [[secession in the United States|secessionist]] motives for his university.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}) Polk laid and consecrated the cornerstone for the first building on October 9, 1860.<ref name=Dupuy601/> Polk's foundational legacy at Sewanee is remembered always through his portrait ''Sword Over the Gown'', painted by Eliphalet F.

Although he hoped that secession would result in a peaceful separation of the North and South, and suggested that he was reluctant to take up arms personally, he did not hesitate to write to his friend and former classmate at West Point, [[Jefferson Davis]],<ref>McWhiney, p. 205.</ref> offering his services in the [[Confederate States Army]]. Polk was commissioned a [[Major General (CSA)|major general]] on June 25, 1861, and ordered to command Department No. 2 (roughly, the area between the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Tennessee River]]).<ref name=Eicher432-3>Eicher, pp. 432-33.</ref> He committed one of the great blunders of the Civil War by dispatching troops to occupy [[Columbus, Kentucky]], in September 1861; the critical [[Border states (American Civil War)|border state]] of Kentucky had declared its [[Neutral country|neutrality]] between the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and the Confederacy, but Polk's action was instrumental in prompting the Kentucky legislature to request Federal aid to resist his advance, ending the state's brief attempt at neutrality and effectively ceding it to Union control for the remainder of the war.<ref>Woodworth, ''Jefferson Davis'', pp. 34-38; Noe, p. 8; Eicher, p. 432.</ref>\n\nDuring this period Polk argued about strategy with his subordinate, Pillow, and his superior, Gen. [[Albert Sidney Johnston]], commander of Confederate forces in the Western Theater. Resentful that his former West Point roommate was giving him orders, he submitted a letter of resignation to President Davis on November 6, but Davis rejected the request.<ref>Woodworth, ''Jefferson Davis'', pp. 58-60; Eicher, p. 432; Connelly, p. 21.</ref> Polk's command saw its first combat on November 7, 1861, in the minor, inconclusive [[Battle of Belmont]] between Polk's subordinate, [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brig. Gen.]] [[Gideon Johnson Pillow]] and Union Brig. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. Although not present on the battlefield himself, Polk was wounded nearby on November 11 when the largest cannon in his army, nicknamed \"Lady Polk\" in honor of his wife, exploded during demonstration firing. The explosion stunned Polk and blew his clothes off, requiring a convalescence of several weeks.\n\n===Army of Mississippi===\n{{quote box|align=right|width=35%|quote=Besides being a basically incompetent general, Polk had the added fault of hating to take orders.\n|source= \u2014[[Steven E. Woodworth]], ''Jefferson Davis and His Generals''<ref>Woodworth, ''Jefferson Davis'', p. 156.</ref>\n}}\nIn April 1862, Polk commanded the First Corps of Albert Sidney Johnston's [[Army of Mississippi]] at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] and continued in that role for much of the rest of the year under Beauregard, who had assumed command following the death of A. S. Johnston on the first day at Shiloh, and then under Gen. [[Braxton Bragg]]. At various times his command was considered a corps and at other times the \"Right Wing\" of the army. In the fall, during the [[Confederate Heartland Offensive|invasion of Kentucky]] by Bragg and Maj. Gen. [[Edmund Kirby Smith]], Polk was in temporary command of the Army of Mississippi while Bragg visited [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]] to preside over the inauguration of a Confederate governor for the state. Polk disregarded an order from Bragg to attack the flank of the pursuing Union Army near Frankfort.<ref>McWhiney, pp. 230, 300-08.</ref>\n\n{{quote box|align=right|width=35%|quote=Bragg thoroughly despised ... the genial but pompous and often incompetent Bishop Polk. Bragg considered Polk \"an old woman, utterly worthless\", especially at disciplining men. Unfortunately for Bragg and for the Confederacy as a whole, Polk remained a great favorite of Jefferson Davis despite carefully couched hints from Bragg, which protected the irritatingly self-righteous Polk from the increasingly sycophantic Bragg and made his appointment to wing command a political necessity.\n|source= \u2014Kenneth W. Noe, ''Perryville''<ref>Noe, p. 57.</ref>\n}}\nAt the [[Battle of Perryville]], Polk's right wing constituted the main attacking force against Maj. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]]'s [[Army of the Ohio]], but Polk was reluctant to attack the small portion of Buell's army that faced him until Bragg arrived at the battlefield. One of the enduring legends of the Civil War is that Polk witnessed his subordinate, Maj. Gen. [[Benjamin F. Cheatham]], advancing his division. Cheatham allegedly shouted, \"Give 'em hell, boys!\" and Polk, retaining the sensibility of his role as an Episcopal bishop, seconded the cheer: \"Give it to 'em boys; give 'em what General Cheatham says!\"<ref>McWhiney, pp. 314-16, McDonough, pp. 243-45.</ref>\n\n===Army of Tennessee===\nAfter Perryville, Polk began a year-long campaign to get Bragg relieved of command, hoping to use his close relationship with President Davis to accomplish his goal.<ref>McWhiney, pp. 328-29.</ref> Despite the failure of his Kentucky campaign, Bragg was retained in command, but this did nothing to reduce the enmity between Polk and Bragg. Polk was promoted to [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|lieutenant general]] on October 11, 1862, with date of rank of October 10. He became the second most senior Confederate of that rank during the war, behind [[James Longstreet]].<ref>Eicher, p. 808. [[Edmund Kirby Smith]] also outranked Polk (behind Longstreet), but he was later promoted to [[General (CSA)|full general]].</ref> In November, the Army of Mississippi was renamed the [[Army of Tennessee]] and Polk commanded its [[First Corps, Army of Tennessee|First Corps]] until September 1863.<ref>Eicher, pp. 433, 890.</ref>\n\nPolk fought under Bragg at the [[Battle of Stones River]] in late 1862 and once again Bragg's subordinates politicked to remove their army commander after an unsuccessful battle (the battle was tactically inconclusive, but Bragg was unable to stop the advance of the Union [[Army of the Cumberland]] under Maj. Gen. [[William S. Rosecrans]] and Bragg withdrew his army to [[Tullahoma, Tennessee]]). Bragg was also unsuccessful in resisting Rosecrans's advance in the [[Tullahoma Campaign]], which began to threaten the important city of [[Chattanooga]]. In the face of Rosecrans's expert maneuvering of his army, Polk counseled Bragg to retreat rather than stand and fight in their Tullahoma fortifications.<ref>Woodworth, ''Six Armies'', pp. 38-40; Connelly, pp. 130-32; McWhiney, pp. 377-79; Hallock, pp. 13-20.</ref>\n\nRosecrans eventually maneuvered Bragg out of Chattanooga and the Army of Tennessee withdrew into the mountains of northwestern Georgia with the Army of the Cumberland in hot pursuit. Bragg planned to attack and destroy at least one of Rosecrans's corps, advancing separately over mountainous roads. He was infuriated when Polk's division under Maj. Gen. [[Thomas C. Hindman]] failed to attack an isolated Union corps at [[Battle of Davis's Cross Roads|Davis's Cross Roads]] as ordered on September 11. Two days later, Polk disregarded orders from Bragg to attack another isolated corps, the second failed opportunity. At the [[Battle of Chickamauga]], Polk was given command of the Right Wing and the responsibility for initiating the attack on the second day of battle (September 20). He failed to inform his subordinates of the plan and his wing was late in attacking, allowing the Union defenders time to complete their field fortifications. Bragg wrote after the war that if it were not for the loss of these hours, \"our independence might have been won.\"<ref>Woodworth, ''Six Armies'', pp. 103, 106; Hallock, pp. 54-62, 71-74.</ref>\n\nChickamauga was a great tactical victory for Bragg, but instead of pursuing and destroying the Union Army as it retreated, he laid siege to it in Chattanooga, concentrating his effort against the enemies inside his army instead of his enemies from the North. He demanded an explanation from Polk on the bishop's failure to attack in time on September 20 and Polk placed the blame entirely on one of his subordinates, Maj. Gen. [[D. H. Hill]]. Bragg wrote to President Davis, \"Gen'l Polk by education and habit is unfit for executing the plans of others. He will convince himself his own are better and follow them without reflecting on the consequences.\" Bragg relieved Polk of his command and ordered him to Atlanta to await further orders. Although Polk protested the \"arbitrary and unlawful order\" to the Secretary of War and demanded a court of inquiry, he was not restored to his position and Davis once again retained Bragg in army command, despite the protestations of a number of his subordinate generals.<ref>Hallock, pp. 89-92; Woodworth, ''Jefferson Davis'', pp. 239-40; Connelly, pp. 247-48.</ref>\n\n===Mississippi===\nPresident Davis transferred his friend Polk to command the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana (December 23, 1863 \u2013 January 28, 1864) and then the Department of Alabama and East Mississippi (January 28 \u2013 May 4, 1864), giving him effective command of the state of Mississippi following the departure of Gen. [[Joseph E. Johnston]] to replace Bragg in command of the Army of Tennessee. Polk unsuccessfully attempted to oppose Maj. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]'s raid against [[Battle of Meridian|Meridian, Mississippi]], in February 1864. In May, he was ordered to take his forces and join with Johnston in resisting Sherman's advance in the [[Atlanta Campaign]]. He assumed command of the Third Corps of the Army of Tennessee on May 4.<ref>Woodworth, ''Jefferson Davis'', pp. 260, 274-75; Connelly, pp. 246-48, 294-95; Eicher, pp. 433, 891.</ref> His command remained commonly known as the \"[[Army of Mississippi]]\".\n\n===Atlanta Campaign and death===\nPolk brought more than 20,000 men with him to Georgia. Because of his elevated rank, he became the army's second in command under Johnston.  By using successive flanking maneuvers, Sherman forced Johnston to withdraw his army from strong defensive positions to protect the Confederate line of communication. This forced Johnston ever closer to the critically important city of Atlanta.<ref>McMurray, p. 62; Woodworth, ''Jefferson Davis'', p. 281.</ref>\n\n{{quote box|align=left|width=35%|quote=The army had suffered a severe loss. It was not that Polk had been a spectacular corps officer. His deficiencies as a commander and his personal traits of stubbornness and childishness had played no small role in several of the army's disasters in earlier times. The loss was one of morale and experience. Polk was the army's most beloved general, a representative of that intangible identification of the army with Tennessee.|source= \u2014Thomas L. Connelly, ''Autumn of Glory''<ref>Connelly, p. 358.</ref>\n}}\n\nOn June 14, 1864, Polk was scouting enemy positions near [[Battle of Marietta|Marietta, Georgia]], with his staff when he was killed in action by a Federal {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on}} [[Shell (projectile)|shell]] at [[Pine Mountain (Cobb County, Georgia)|Pine Mountain]].<ref>Welsh, p. 174.</ref> The artillery fire was initiated when Sherman spotted a cluster of Confederate generals \u2014 Polk, [[William J.

[[Oliver Otis Howard]], commander of the [[IV Corps (Union Army)|IV Corps]], and ordered him to fire upon them. [[Battery I, 1st Ohio Light Artillery|Battery I of the 1st Ohio Light Artillery]], commanded by Capt. [[Hubert Dilger]], obeyed the order within minutes.  The first round from the battery came close and a second came even closer, causing the men to disperse.  The third shell struck Polk's left arm, went through his chest, and exited hitting his right arm, then exploded against a tree; it nearly cut Polk in two.<ref>Smith, pp. 253-54. Foote, p. 356, credits Battery I, 1st Ohio Light Battery, commanded by Capt. Hubert Dilger. Polk's biographer, Joseph Parks, describes his death (pp. 382-83) without identifying the Union artillery responsible.</ref>{{clear}}\n\n==Legacy==\n{{quote box|align=right|width=35%|quote=My pen and ability is inadequate to the task of doing his memory justice.

Polk's funeral service at [[St. Paul's Episcopal Church (Augusta, Georgia)|Saint Paul's Church]] in [[Augusta, Georgia]], was one of the most elaborate during the war. His friend Bishop [[Stephen Elliott (bishop)|Stephen Elliott]] of Georgia presided at the service, delivering a stirring funeral oration. He was buried in a location under the present-day altar. The church has a monument to the bishop near the altar, and the original grave site can be visited. In 1945, his remains and those of his wife were reinterred at [[Christ Church Cathedral, New Orleans|Christ Church Cathedral]] in [[New Orleans]].<ref>Robins, p. 1538; Eicher, p. 433.</ref> His grave can be found in the front floor sanctuary, to the right of the pulpit.

{"title_page": "Government of Alabama", "text_new": "[[File:Flag of Alabama.svg|thumb|300px|The flag of the state of Alabama]]\nThe '''government of Alabama''' is organized under the provisions of the 1901 [[Constitution of Alabama]], the lengthiest constitution of any political entity in the world.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20041130031023/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6596687/ Alabama Vote Opens Old Racial Wounds].  From MSNBC.</ref>  Like other [[U.S. state|states]] within the United States, Alabama's government is divided into executive, judicial, and legislative branches.\n\n==Executive branch==\nThe Alabama Executive branch consists of the [[Governor of Alabama]], the [[Lieutenant Governor of Alabama]], the [[Cabinet (government)|Governor's Cabinet]], several popularly elected executive officials, and the executive staff.  The Cabinet consists of the heads of 25 different departments ranging from the Chief of Staff to the head of the [[Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]].\n\n===Governor===\nThe Governor is the [[Head of government|chief executive]] of the state's government. He or she (currently Governor Kay Ivey) is responsible for upholding the [[Alabama Constitution]] and executing [[state law]]. The Governor is elected by [[Direct election|popular election]] every four years. The constitution limits the governor to two consecutive terms, but there is no [[term limit|limit]] on the total number of terms one may serve, so long as no more than two are ever consecutive. [[George Wallace]] holds the record as the longest-serving governor in Alabama history with 16 years of service.\n\nThe governor also is [[commander-in-chief]] of the state's military forces, which consist of the [[Alabama Army National Guard]] and [[Alabama Air National Guard]], which are part of the [[National Guard of the United States]]. As commander-in-chief, the governor may call out the state's military forces to preserve the public peace when it is not in active service of the United States.

The Clerk of Court is Robert G. Esdale, Sr.<ref name=\"supreme\"/> As the highest state court, the Supreme Court has both judicial and administrative responsibilities. The court is housed in the [[Alabama Judicial Building|Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building]].\n\nThe Supreme Court has authority to review decisions rendered by the other courts of the state. It also has authority to determine certain legal matters over which no other court has jurisdiction, and to issue such orders as may prove necessary to carry out its general superintendence over the court system in Alabama. The Supreme Court of Alabama has exclusive jurisdiction over all appeals where the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, as well as appeals from the [[Alabama Public Service Commission]].\n\nThe [[chief justice]] is the administrative head of the state's [[judicial system]].  The Supreme Court may make rules governing administration, practice, and procedure for all Alabama courts. Under this authority, uniform rules of practice and procedure and judicial administration have been adopted to eliminate many of the technicalities which cause delay in the trial courts, and needless reversals in the appellate courts.\n\n===Court of the Judiciary===\nA \"Court of the Judiciary\" is created under Alabama law, consisting of one judge of an appellate court (other than the Supreme Court), who shall be selected by the Supreme Court and shall serve as Chief Judge of the Court of the Judiciary. In addition, two judges of the circuit court are to be appointed to this body, who shall be selected by the Circuit Judges' Association; together with one district judge, who shall be selected by the District Judges' Association. Other members of the Court of the Judiciary are: two members of the state bar, who shall be selected by the governing body of the [[Alabama State Bar]]; three persons (as of 2005) who are not lawyers who shall be appointed by the Governor; and one person appointed by the Lieutenant Governor. Members appointed by the Governor and Lieutenant Governor shall be subject to Senate confirmation before serving.\n\nThe Court of the Judiciary is convened to hear complaints filed by the Judicial Inquiry Commission. It has authority, after notice and public hearing, to impose one of two penalties:\n*To remove from office, suspend without pay, or censure a judge, or apply such other sanction as may be prescribed by law, for violation of a Canon of Judicial Ethics, misconduct in office, failure to perform his or her duties, or\n*To suspend with or without pay, or to retire a judge who is physically or mentally unable to perform his duties.<ref>''Constitution of Alabama of 1901, Amendment 581, \u00a76.18''.</ref>\n\n==Legislative branch==\n{{main|Alabama Legislature}}\nLike other states within the United States, Alabama has a [[State legislature (United States)|legislative branch]].\n\n===House of Representatives===\n{{main|Alabama House of Representatives}}\n\n====General information====\nThe [[Alabama House of Representatives]] is composed of 105 members, all elected from single-member districts of equal population across the state in the same cycle.  Each member represents a district of approximately 40,000 people,<ref>Article IV, Section 50 of the [[Alabama Constitution]].</ref>  and is elected to a four-year term. The [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the House]] is currently [[Mac McCutcheon (Alabama politician)|Mac McCutcheon]], a Republican.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19981201234723/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/house/houseleaders.html ]</ref>  The current partisan line-up of the House of Representatives is 72 Republicans and 33 Democrats.\n\nAll revenue-raising matters must originate in the Alabama House. A majority of a quorum can pass any bill except a constitutional amendment, which requires a three-fifths vote of all those elected.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n===Senate===\n{{main|Alabama Senate}}\n\n====General information====\nThe [[Alabama Senate]] is composed of 35 Senators. Each Senator represents a single-member district of approximately 125,000 Alabamians.\n\nSenators must be at least 25 years of age at the time of their election, must be citizens and residents of the state of Alabama for at least 3 years, and reside within their district for at least one year prior to election.<ref>Article IV, Section 47 of the Alabama Constitution]</ref>\n\nAll Senators are elected for four-year terms in the same cycle as the House of Representatives, the Governor, and other statewide constitutional officers.\n\nWhile the House of Representatives has exclusive power to originate revenue bills, such legislation can be amended and/or substituted by the Senate. Moreover, because the Senate is historically considered to be the \"deliberative body\", its rules concerning length of debate are more relaxed than those of the House of Representatives.  The Senate also has a history of filibusters that the rules of the lower house do not as easily tolerate.\n\nThe Alabama Senate has sole power of Confirmation of certain appointees designated by the Constitution and by statute.\n\n===Legislative sessions===\n\n====Regular sessions====\nThe [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]] convenes in regular annual sessions on the first Tuesday in February, except:\n\n*In the first year of the four-year term, when the session begins on the first Tuesday in March, and\n*In the last year of a four-year term, when the session begins on the second Tuesday in January.\n\nThe length of the regular session is limited to 30 meeting days within a period of 105 calendar days. Generally, two meeting or \"legislative\" days are held per week, with other days being devoted to committee meetings. The Alabama Constitution provides that no law shall be passed except by a bill, which is a proposed law written out in the proper format. Once approved in accordance with the state constitution, the bill becomes an act.\n\n====Special sessions====\nSpecial sessions of the Legislature may be called by the Governor, with the Proclamation listing those subjects that the Governor wishes to be considered in that session. These sessions are limited to twelve legislative days within a thirty calendar day span.  Whereas in a regular session bills may be enacted on any subject, in a special session, legislation must be enacted only on those subjects which the Governor announces in his proclamation or \"call.\" Anything not in the \"call\" requires a two-thirds vote of each house to be enacted.\n\nConstitutional amendments always require a three-fifths vote of the elected Members of each house for passage, whether in regular or special session, and this constitutional provision cannot be abrogated by any governor. Likewise, while a governor's proclamation may itemize subjects to be considered in a special session, the proclamation cannot dictate that the legislature specifically consider only a bill which mirrors the exact language of a bill offered in a previous session. The legislature may offer and consider any bills it chooses in a special session, subject to the above-stated requirements for passage (depending upon whether the subject of the bill formed part of the governor's \"call\", or whether it is a constitutional amendment).\n\n===Lawmaking process===\n{{main|State_legislature_(United_States)#Lawmaking_process}}\nAlabama's lawmaking process differs somewhat from the other 49 states.\n\n====Beginnings====\nEach bill may only pertain to one subject (which must be clearly stated in the title), \"except general appropriation bills, general revenue bills, and bills adopting a code, digest, or revision of statutes\".<ref>Alabama State Constitution, Article 4, Section 45</ref>\n\n====Committees====\n\n=====General information=====\nBills are referred to standing committees by the Lieutenant Governor and the President Pro Tempore in the Senate, and by the Speaker in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe Constitution states that each house shall determine the number of committees, and the numbers of committees vary from [[quadrennium|quadrennial session]] to session.\n\n=====Legislative Council=====\nThe Alabama legislature has a Legislative Council, which is a permanent or continuing interim committee, composed as follows:\n \n*From the Senate, the Lieutenant Governor and President Pro-Tempore, the Chairmen of Finance and Taxation, Rules, Judiciary, and Governmental Affairs, and six Senators elected by the Senate;\n*From the House of Representatives, the Speaker and Speaker Pro-Tempore, the Chairmen of Ways and Means, Rules, Judiciary, and Local Government, and six Representatives elected by the House.\n*The majority and minority leaders of each house.\n\nThe Legislative Council meets at least once quarterly to consider problems for which legislation may be needed, and to make recommendations for the next legislative session. A number of significant statutes have been placed on the Alabama law books as a result of this council's activity.\n\n====Post-committee====\n\n=====Reports of Committee=====\nAny bill which affects state funding by more than $1,000, and which involves expenditure or collection of revenue, must have a \"Fiscal Note\". Fiscal Notes are prepared by the Legislative Fiscal Office and signed by the chairman of the committee reporting the bill. They must contain projected increases or decreases to state revenue in the event that the bill becomes law.\n\n=====Third reading=====\nOnce the bill has been discussed, each member casts his or her vote as their name is called alphabetically. Since the state's Senate is rather small, voting may be done effectively in that house via manual roll call. An electronic voting machine is utilized in the House of Representatives.\n\nIf amendments are adopted, the bill is sent to the Enrolling and Engrossing Department of that house for engrossment. Engrossment is the process of incorporating amendments into the bill before transmittal to the second house.\n\n=====Conference committees=====\nA conference committee is empaneled to discusses the points of difference between the two houses' versions of the same bill, and tries to reach an agreement between them so that the identical bill can be passed by both houses.\n\nWhen a bill has passed both houses in identical form, it is enrolled. The \"enrolled\" copy is the official bill, which, after it becomes law, is kept by the Secretary of State for reference in the event of any dispute as to its exact language. The bill is then ready for transmittal to the Governor.\n\n=====Presentation to the governor=====\nOnce a bill reaches the governor, he or she may sign it, which completes its enactment into law.  From this point, the bill becomes an act, and remains the law of the state unless repealed by legislative action, or overturned by a court decision.  If the governor does not approve of the bill, he or she may veto it.  In the event of a veto, the governor returns the bill to the house in which it originated, with a message explaining his objections and suggesting any amendments (if applicable) which might remove those objections.  The bill is then reconsidered, and if a simple majority of the members of both houses agrees to the proposed executive amendments, it is returned to the Governor, as he revised it, for his signature.\n\nOn the other hand, a simple majority of the members of each house can choose to approve a vetoed bill precisely as the Legislature originally passed it, in which case it becomes a law over the governor's veto.  This is in contrast to the practice in most states and the federal government, which require a two-thirds majority in both houses to override a governor's veto.\n\nIf the Governor fails to return a bill to the legislative house in which it originated within six days after it was presented to him or her (not including Sundays), it becomes a law without their signature.  This return can be prevented by recession of the Legislature. In that case the bill must be returned within two days after the legislature reassembles, or it becomes a law without the Governor's signature.\n\nThe bills that reach the Governor less than five days before the end of the session may be approved by him within ten days after adjournment. The bills not approved within that time do not become law. This is known as a \"pocket veto\".  This is the most conclusive form of veto, for the Legislature (having adjourned) has no chance to reconsider the vetoed measure.\n\nAlabama is one of the states in which the governor has the power to [[line item veto|accept or reject any particular item of an appropriation bill without vetoing the entire bill]]. In this event, only the vetoed item of the appropriation bill is returned to the house of origin for reconsideration by the Legislature. The remainder of the bill becomes law.\n\n====Constitutional amendments====\nSometimes what the legislature wishes to accomplish cannot be done simply by the passage of a bill, but rather requires amending the Constitution. A bill or joint resolution is accordingly drafted to propose an appropriate amendment to the Constitution. This bill or joint resolution is introduced in the same manner as other bills and resolutions, and follows the course of ordinary bills, except that it must be read at length on three different days in each house.  Furthermore, it must be passed in each house by a three-fifths vote of all the members elected, and does not require the approval of the governor. A constitutional amendment passed by the legislature is deposited directly with the Secretary of State. It is then submitted to the voters of the state at an election (the time of which is fixed by the Legislature), held not less than three months after the adjournment of the session in which the amendment was proposed. The governor announces the election by proclamation, and the proposed amendment and notice of the election must be published in every county for four successive weeks before the election. If a majority of those who vote at the election favor the amendment, it becomes a part of the Constitution. The result of the election is announced by proclamation of the governor.\n\n== Seals of the Government of Alabama ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Seal of the Governor of Alabama.svg|[[Seals of the Governors of the U.S. States|Seal]] of the [[Governor of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Lieutenant Governor of Alabama.svg|[[Seals of the Governors of the U.S. States|Seal]] of the [[Lieutenant Governor of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Governor-Elect of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[President-elect|Governor-Elect]] of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Speaker of the House of Alabama.svg|Seal of the Speaker of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]]\nFile:Seal of the Unified Judicial System of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[Courts of Alabama|Unified Judicial System]] of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Attorney General of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[Attorney General of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles.svg|Seal of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency.svg|Seal of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Corrections.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Corrections]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Homeland Security.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Homeland Security]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Labor.svg|Seal of the Alabama Department of Labor\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Public Health.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Public Health]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Public Safety.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Public Safety]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Transportation.svg|Seal of the Alabama Department of Transportation\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Treasury Department.svg|Seal of the Alabama Treasury Department\nFile:Seal of the Securities Commission of Alabama.svg|Seal of the Securities Commission of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Alabama National Guard.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama National Guard]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Elections in Alabama]]\n*[[Courts of Alabama]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://governor.state.al.us/ Governor's Office Website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050920100305/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/ Legislature Office Website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050917073603/http://www.judicial.state.al.us/ Judicial Office Website]\n*{{Ballotpedia|Alabama|Alabama}}\n\n{{Alabama}}\n{{Governments of the United States}}\n\n[[Category:Government of Alabama| ]]\n[[Category:State governments of the United States|Alabama]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Flag of Alabama.svg|thumb|300px|The flag of the state of Alabama]]\nThe '''government of Alabama''' is organized under the provisions of the 1901 [[Constitution of Alabama]], the lengthiest constitution of any political entity in the world.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20041130031023/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6596687/ Alabama Vote Opens Old Racial Wounds].

He or she (currently Governor Kay Ivey) is responsible for upholding the [[Alabama Constitution]] and executing [[state law]]. The Governor is elected by [[Direct election|popular election]] every four years. The constitution limits the governor to two consecutive terms, but there is no [[term limit|limit]] on the total number of terms one may serve, so long as no more than two are ever consecutive. [[George Wallace]] holds the record as the longest-serving governor in Alabama history with 16 years of service.\n\nThe governor also is [[commander-in-chief]] of the state's military forces, which consist of the [[Alabama Army National Guard]] and [[Alabama Air National Guard]], which are part of the [[National Guard of the United States]]. As commander-in-chief, the governor may call out the state's military forces to preserve the public peace when it is not in active service of the United States. He may also call upon them to render aid during natural disasters or other times when he or she may deem their services to be required.\n\nThe governor of Alabama has power to [[veto]] laws passed by the state legislature (see below).

The Alabama Constitution provides that no law shall be passed except by a bill, which is a proposed law written out in the proper format. Once approved in accordance with the state constitution, the bill becomes an act.\n\n====Special sessions====\nSpecial sessions of the Legislature may be called by the Governor, with the Proclamation listing those subjects that the Governor wishes to be considered in that session. These sessions are limited to twelve legislative days within a thirty calendar day span.  Whereas in a regular session bills may be enacted on any subject, in a special session, legislation must be enacted only on those subjects which the Governor announces in his proclamation or \"call.\" Anything not in the \"call\" requires a two-thirds vote of each house to be enacted.\n\nConstitutional amendments always require a three-fifths vote of the elected Members of each house for passage, whether in regular or special session, and this constitutional provision cannot be abrogated by any governor. Likewise, while a governor's proclamation may itemize subjects to be considered in a special session, the proclamation cannot dictate that the legislature specifically consider only a bill which mirrors the exact language of a bill offered in a previous session. The legislature may offer and consider any bills it chooses in a special session, subject to the above-stated requirements for passage (depending upon whether the subject of the bill formed part of the governor's \"call\", or whether it is a constitutional amendment).\n\n===Lawmaking process===\n{{main|State_legislature_(United_States)#Lawmaking_process}}\nAlabama's lawmaking process differs somewhat from the other 49 states.\n\n====Beginnings====\nEach bill may only pertain to one subject (which must be clearly stated in the title), \"except general appropriation bills, general revenue bills, and bills adopting a code, digest, or revision of statutes\".<ref>Alabama State Constitution, Article 4, Section 45</ref>\n\n====Committees====\n\n=====General information=====\nBills are referred to standing committees by the Lieutenant Governor and the President Pro Tempore in the Senate, and by the Speaker in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe Constitution states that each house shall determine the number of committees, and the numbers of committees vary from [[quadrennium|quadrennial session]] to session.\n\n=====Legislative Council=====\nThe Alabama legislature has a Legislative Council, which is a permanent or continuing interim committee, composed as follows:\n \n*From the Senate, the Lieutenant Governor and President Pro-Tempore, the Chairmen of Finance and Taxation, Rules, Judiciary, and Governmental Affairs, and six Senators elected by the Senate;\n*From the House of Representatives, the Speaker and Speaker Pro-Tempore, the Chairmen of Ways and Means, Rules, Judiciary, and Local Government, and six Representatives elected by the House.\n*The majority and minority leaders of each house.\n\nThe Legislative Council meets at least once quarterly to consider problems for which legislation may be needed, and to make recommendations for the next legislative session. A number of significant statutes have been placed on the Alabama law books as a result of this council's activity.\n\n====Post-committee====\n\n=====Reports of Committee=====\nAny bill which affects state funding by more than $1,000, and which involves expenditure or collection of revenue, must have a \"Fiscal Note\". Fiscal Notes are prepared by the Legislative Fiscal Office and signed by the chairman of the committee reporting the bill. They must contain projected increases or decreases to state revenue in the event that the bill becomes law.\n\n=====Third reading=====\nOnce the bill has been discussed, each member casts his or her vote as their name is called alphabetically. Since the state's Senate is rather small, voting may be done effectively in that house via manual roll call. An electronic voting machine is utilized in the House of Representatives.\n\nIf amendments are adopted, the bill is sent to the Enrolling and Engrossing Department of that house for engrossment. Engrossment is the process of incorporating amendments into the bill before transmittal to the second house.\n\n=====Conference committees=====\nA conference committee is empaneled to discusses the points of difference between the two houses' versions of the same bill, and tries to reach an agreement between them so that the identical bill can be passed by both houses.\n\nWhen a bill has passed both houses in identical form, it is enrolled. The \"enrolled\" copy is the official bill, which, after it becomes law, is kept by the Secretary of State for reference in the event of any dispute as to its exact language. The bill is then ready for transmittal to the Governor.\n\n=====Presentation to the governor=====\nOnce a bill reaches the governor, he or she may sign it, which completes its enactment into law.  From this point, the bill becomes an act, and remains the law of the state unless repealed by legislative action, or overturned by a court decision.  If the governor does not approve of the bill, he or she may veto it.  In the event of a veto, the governor returns the bill to the house in which it originated, with a message explaining his objections and suggesting any amendments (if applicable) which might remove those objections.  The bill is then reconsidered, and if a simple majority of the members of both houses agrees to the proposed executive amendments, it is returned to the Governor, as he revised it, for his signature.\n\nOn the other hand, a simple majority of the members of each house can choose to approve a vetoed bill precisely as the Legislature originally passed it, in which case it becomes a law over the governor's veto.  This is in contrast to the practice in most states and the federal government, which require a two-thirds majority in both houses to override a governor's veto.\n\nIf the Governor fails to return a bill to the legislative house in which it originated within six days after it was presented to him or her (not including Sundays), it becomes a law without their signature.  This return can be prevented by recession of the Legislature. In that case the bill must be returned within two days after the legislature reassembles, or it becomes a law without the Governor's signature.\n\nThe bills that reach the Governor less than five days before the end of the session may be approved by him within ten days after adjournment. The bills not approved within that time do not become law. This is known as a \"pocket veto\".  This is the most conclusive form of veto, for the Legislature (having adjourned) has no chance to reconsider the vetoed measure.\n\nAlabama is one of the states in which the governor has the power to [[line item veto|accept or reject any particular item of an appropriation bill without vetoing the entire bill]]. In this event, only the vetoed item of the appropriation bill is returned to the house of origin for reconsideration by the Legislature. The remainder of the bill becomes law.\n\n====Constitutional amendments====\nSometimes what the legislature wishes to accomplish cannot be done simply by the passage of a bill, but rather requires amending the Constitution. A bill or joint resolution is accordingly drafted to propose an appropriate amendment to the Constitution. This bill or joint resolution is introduced in the same manner as other bills and resolutions, and follows the course of ordinary bills, except that it must be read at length on three different days in each house.  Furthermore, it must be passed in each house by a three-fifths vote of all the members elected, and does not require the approval of the governor. A constitutional amendment passed by the legislature is deposited directly with the Secretary of State. It is then submitted to the voters of the state at an election (the time of which is fixed by the Legislature), held not less than three months after the adjournment of the session in which the amendment was proposed. The governor announces the election by proclamation, and the proposed amendment and notice of the election must be published in every county for four successive weeks before the election. If a majority of those who vote at the election favor the amendment, it becomes a part of the Constitution. The result of the election is announced by proclamation of the governor.\n\n== Seals of the Government of Alabama ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Seal of the Governor of Alabama.svg|[[Seals of the Governors of the U.S. States|Seal]] of the [[Governor of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Lieutenant Governor of Alabama.svg|[[Seals of the Governors of the U.S. States|Seal]] of the [[Lieutenant Governor of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Governor-Elect of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[President-elect|Governor-Elect]] of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Speaker of the House of Alabama.svg|Seal of the Speaker of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]]\nFile:Seal of the Unified Judicial System of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[Courts of Alabama|Unified Judicial System]] of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Attorney General of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[Attorney General of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles.svg|Seal of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency.svg|Seal of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Corrections.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Corrections]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Homeland Security.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Homeland Security]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Labor.svg|Seal of the Alabama Department of Labor\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Public Health.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Public Health]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Public Safety.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Public Safety]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Transportation.svg|Seal of the Alabama Department of Transportation\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Treasury Department.svg|Seal of the Alabama Treasury Department\nFile:Seal of the Securities Commission of Alabama.svg|Seal of the Securities Commission of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Alabama National Guard.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama National Guard]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Elections in Alabama]]\n*[[Courts of Alabama]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://governor.state.al.us/ Governor's Office Website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050920100305/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/ Legislature Office Website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050917073603/http://www.judicial.state.al.us/ Judicial Office Website]\n*{{Ballotpedia|Alabama|Alabama}}\n\n{{Alabama}}\n{{Governments of the United States}}\n\n[[Category:Government of Alabama| ]]\n[[Category:State governments of the United States|Alabama]]\n", "name_user": "AveryRedPandaGirl", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Alabama"}

In 2005, the Seafood Centre was upgraded to give it a modernised look, and better facilities.

He did this to facilitate the importation of scrap metal from the Americans who were engaged in the Vietnam war at the time. It was built in the reclaimed land of East Coast under the East Coast reclamation. It was used by the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] in 1975 to receive the refugees after the surrender of Saigon to the North Vietnamese forces. An SAF Field Hospital was deployed to Bedok Jetty to provide first aid and other essential medical services to all Singapore bound refugee boats fleeing South Vietnam following the [[fall of Saigon]] in 1975.\n\nIn the 1980s, the jetty became popular among fishing enthusiasts. However, by 1988, it was in a poor state, with ''The Straits Times'' noting its corroded railings and cracked support beams.

Its original name was UDMC Seafood Centre, which was later changed in 2000 to its current name. Popularised for housing several major local seafood restaurants, the seafood centre serves local favourites such as [[chilli crab]], [[black pepper crab]] and [[mee goreng]]. In 2005, the Seafood Centre was upgraded to give it a modernised look, and better facilities. Many of the features were revamped, and a number of old tenants vacated for new tenants to take their place.\n\nPlans for the seafood centre were first announced in July 1977, with five seafood restaurants from Upper East Coast Road.<ref name=\":1\"/> The owners of the restaurants were initially unhappy with the offer to move, citing reduced seating and patronage at the new site.<ref>{{cite news |title=Move to E.

For these restaurants, the business was generally better than at their old premises, with restaurant owners noting increased takings, and their patrons were also satisfied with the new location. However, there was also much unhappiness among restaurant owners and customers over the inconvenience of the seafood centre.<ref name=\":4\"/> In 1990, renovations were carried out at the restaurants. That same year, all the restaurants at the centre were fined, while two, Golden Lagoon and Jumbo, were suspended for two weeks for violations of health regulations, such as poor hygiene practices. Nevertheless, business did not seem to be affected, with a ''Straits Times'' reporter noting that they still drew large crowds in the evening.<ref name=\":9\"/>\n\nThrough the rest of the 1980s and 1990s, the restaurants at the centre generally did well, and many tourists patronised them. However, by 2015, customer numbers had decreased considerably, with those at Red House Seafood falling by 35 percent in the previous two years. In March 2015, Red House Seafood closed, with a landscaped lawn taking its place, and with their leases having expired, two other restaurants, No Signboard Seafood and Fisherman's Village, also closed.<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\n===Marine Cove===\n[[File:Marine Cove, Mar 06.JPG|thumb|250px|right|{{Center|Marine Cove}}]]\nMarine Cove (formerly known as the East Coast Recreation Centre), is a building complex in Area&nbsp;C at East Coast Park where in the past, many [[caf\u00e9]]s, [[restaurant]]s, and [[Bar (establishment)|bar]]s were located.

He did this to facilitate the importation of scrap metal from the Americans who were engaged in the Vietnam war at the time. It was built in the reclaimed land of East Coast under the East Coast reclamation. It was used by the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] in 1975 to receive the refugees after the surrender of Saigon to the North Vietnamese forces. An SAF Field Hospital was deployed to Bedok Jetty to provide first aid and other essential medical services to all Singapore bound refugee boats fleeing South Vietnam following the [[fall of Saigon]] in 1975.\n\nIn the 1980s, the jetty became popular among fishing enthusiasts. However, by 1988, it was in a poor state, with ''The Straits Times'' noting its corroded railings and cracked support beams. In March that year, the Public Works Department closed the jetty for a $1.1&nbsp;million facelift, consisting of repairs to the jetty's deck and supports.<ref>{{cite news |title=$1m facelift for Bedok's favourite fishing spot |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19880223-1.2.24.17 |work=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |date=23 February 1988 |accessdate=12 November 2019 |via=NewspaperSG |page=10 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:View of Bedok Jetty from East Coast Park, Singapore - 20101120.jpg|thumb|{{Center|View of Bedok Jetty}} {{Center|from East Coast Park}}]]\n\n===Siglap Canal===\nLocated near Area C4, a new lawn and lookout deck in the East Coast Park was opened to provide visitors with an additional area for recreational activities as well as a community space.
