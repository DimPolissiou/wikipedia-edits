The series is produced by [[Sajid Nadiadwala]]. The series stars [[Akshay Kumar]] and [[Ritesh Deshmukh]] as lead cast and [[Boman Irani]] and [[Chunkey Pandey]] in supporting roles as Batuk Patel and Aakhri Pasta respectively. [[Jacqueline Fernandez]] has also appeared in first three films, she however made a special appearance in the first film and played a pivotal role in the second and the third film. Malaika made cameos in the first two movies but didn't appear in the third one. The fourth film, ''[[Housefull 4]]'' featured [[Bobby Deol]], [[Kriti Sanon]], [[Kriti Kharbanda]], [[Pooja Hegde]] and [[Rana Daggubati]] in addition to regular cast. Based on reincarnation theme, it is the most expensive Indian comedy film ever made. [[Farhad Samji]] directed the fourth film.\nEach film starts with a fresh story unrelated with the preceding film's story. However, the theme and the pace remains the same.\n\n==Overview==\n===''Housefull'' (2010)===\n{{Main|Housefull (2010 film)}}\nAarush, ([[Akshay Kumar]]) is a jinxed loser who stays with his friend, Bob ([[Ritesh Deshmukh]]) and his wife, Hetal ([[Lara Dutta]]), both working at a [[casino]] owned by Mr.Kishore Samtani ([[Randhir Kapoor]]). Although at first Hetal is displeased with Aarush's presence, he proves to be a kind-hearted man looking for family. Bob and Hetal decide to marry him to their boss' daughter, Devika Samtani ([[Jiah Khan]]). After the marriage, on their honeymoon in Italy, Devika leaves him for her long-time American boyfriend Benny. Dejected, Aarush tries to commit suicide by drowning in the sea but is saved by a girl Sandy ([[Deepika Padukone]]).\n\nSandy originally thinks Aarush is a pervert, but when Aakhri Pasta ([[Chunkey Pandey]]), the owner of Italy's biggest hotel where Aarush was spending his honeymoon with Devika, tells Sandy that Aarush is a widower, she befriends him and slowly falls in love with him. What she does not know, is that Aakhri Pasta was only joking. She then finds out his wife is alive and leaves him, but he tells her the whole truth to make her understand and she accepts him.\n\nThe only way Aarush can marry Sandy is by convincing her elder brother, Major Krishna Rao ([[Arjun Rampal]]), a strict Indian Military Intelligence officer who loves and is over-protective of Sandy. Meanwhile, Hetal, in an attempt to reconcile, lies to her father, Batuk Patel ([[Boman Irani]]), that Bob owns a mansion and they have a child. The four rent a mansion to make him believe that Bob owns it, but Batuk accidentally believes that Aarush is married to Hetal, and Bob is the cook. Then, Krishna turns up, much to Aarush's horror, leading to more lies.\n\nFor half of the term, the four must pretend that the mansion is owned by Bob, and the rest must pretend that Aarush owns it. An overly suspicious Krishna sees Bob and Hetal working at the casino and uses a lie detector to find the truth. After Sandy objects, Krishna apologises and agrees to Aarush and Sandy's marriage. The whole family is invited to the Royal Palace, to see Krishna get rewarded by the Queen of England. While this is happening, two workers are meant to be installing air conditioning gas for the place, however instead they accidentally supply the hall with laughing gas causing everyone to break into an outburst of laughter. During this laughter, the truth is let out but no one seems to be in the right state of mind.\n\nThe two workers meanwhile stop the gas from spreading \u2013 and its effect passes. Aarush is still telling Krishna the truth, leading Krishna to break off Sandy's engagement. However, after Sandy tearfully pleads with him, Krishna lets the two get married. In the end, Hetal and Bob live together with Batuk Patel, and Aarush's luck changes for the better.\n\n===''Housefull 2'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Housefull 2}}\nThis film is an adaptation of the [[Marathi language|Marathi]] film \"Dam Dam Diga Diga\", released in 2008 and Telugu film [[Hungama (2005 film)|Hungama]], released in 2005, which is a remake of Malayalam movie [[Mattupetti Machan]], released in 1998,\nThe two cousins Heena ([[Asin Thottumkal]]) and Bobby ([[Jacqueline Fernandez]]), daughters of the Kapoor family, hate each other very much. They start quarrelling over something relating to their duties of Animals' Law Authority. Their fathers, Chintu ([[Rishi Kapoor]]) and Dabboo ([[Randhir Kapoor]]), are step-brothers who hate each other to the very core. Even their wives hate each other. Chintu wants the richest son-in law for his daughter, Heena, while Dabboo too wants the same for his daughter, Bobby. Aakhri Pasta ([[Chunky Pandey]]), a marriage counsellor, is ordered by both Chintu and Dabboo to find the best son-in-law. Aakhri Pasta brings Mr. Babani ([[Virendra Saxena]]) to discuss Babani's son Jai.\n\nWhen Chintu misinterprets one of Aakhri's comments, he verbally abuses Babani while shouting. Babani suffers from a condition that affects his heart when he hears loud noises. Due to Chintu's shouting, Babani suffers a heart attack, landing him in a hospital. Babani's son Jai ([[Shreyas Talpade]]) comes to know of this and gets angry, then vows revenge, telling his friend Jolly/Jwala ([[Ritesh Deshmukh]]), who is the son of billionaire J.D. ([[Mithun Chakraborty]]), to go to Chintu, agree to marry his daughter and then break off the wedding at the last minute. Jolly is busy trying to introduce his girlfriend to his own father and does not want to get involved. He suggests Max ([[John Abraham (actor)|John Abraham]]), their former college mate and a thief, to do the job. Jay goes with Max as his driver but somehow, they end in the wrong house and go to Dabboo's house.\n\nJay and Max later find out their mistake. Jai, still wanting revenge, doesn't know what to do and Jolly suggests another former sleazy college mate, Sunny ([[Akshay Kumar]]). Jolly goes with Sunny as his bodyguard because Max and Sunny are sworn enemies and as Dabboo's house and Chintu's house are right next to each other, their plan may fail. Sunny and Jolly encounter a crocodile and Max and Jay encounter a snake. They manage to survive the attack.\n\nWhile Heena and Bobby are on a cruise, they accidentally end up on an island. Max and Sunny become friends again, while Heena and Bobby become friends. They find a resort and go home. Dabboo gets Jolly (Max) engaged to Bobby and Chintu gets Jolly (Sunny) engaged to Heena. The day of the engagement, Chintu blindfolds Jolly, Sunny, Jai and Heena and takes them to J.D.'s house. After seeing the real Jolly holding Sunny's garland, J.D. believes that Jolly got engaged to Heena. Luckily, Sunny convinces him. Jolly calls them at midnight and reveals his father's secret of being Jagga Daaku. He also reveals that his real name is Jwala. After Sunny fools Chintu, Chintu calls Dabboo in excitement and tells him that his daughter, Heena, is marrying Jolly, the son of J.D. Confused, and believing Max to be Jolly, Dabboo takes Max and Bobby to J.D.'s mansion. Sunny handles the situation well by fooling J.D. by taking the name of his religion and tells him that Max is Jolly's friend and Bobby is Max's fianc\u00e9 (though actually it is true) and Max's father is against his and Bobby's marriage. J.D. then welcomes Bobby, Max and her family to his house and tells them to stay there up to Bobby and Max's marriage.\n\nBatuk Patel ([[Boman Irani]]) arrives with his daughter Parul ([[Shazahn Padamsee]]) to make things worse. Jay and Jwala come to receive them from the airport. But when they see Parul, Jay and Jwala lie that Jay is Jolly. Parul becomes happy hearing this as they secretly love each other. Jelo ([[Zarine Khan]]) gives Jwala the ultimatum &nbsp;\u2013 take me to your house or forget me. To help Jwala, Sunny lies to J.D., saying that Jelo is his fianc\u00e9, and J.D. again agrees to let her live there as Sunny takes the name of his religion. Sunny and Max lie to their respective fathers-in-law that the other guy is the son of J.D. and a maid servant in the mansion. This creates a lot of confusion.\n\nWhen Sunny's father as well as Max's 'Guru' tells them never to break anyone's heart, Sunny and Max tell the truth to Heena and Bobby. Enraged, Bobby and Heena slap Max and Sunny respectively and tell them that they never want to see their faces again. But thinking that instead of telling the truth, Sunny and Max could have done more wrong with them, the two sisters pardon the two boys on the very next day. There Jay and Jolly also let off their plan of revenge on Kapoors on Jay's father's advice. Then Henna proposes Sunny in Sunny's style and Bobby proposes Max in Max's style.\n\nOn the day of the four couples' marriage, J.D. and the other brides' fathers learn the truth about the grooms and that they have been lying all this time. Finally Bobby and Heena convince their fathers to forget their enmity and live together as blood brothers. Chintu and Dabboo join hands and so do their wives. But J.D. was not convinced by them telling the truth, so he turns back into Jagga Daku and starts frightening the families with his gun. He tries to shoot Sunny with his gun as Sunny runs towards J.D. to save him from the falling chandelier and then he understands what was happening. In the end, all the grooms marry their respective girlfriends.\n\n===''Housefull 3'' (2016)===\n{{Main|Housefull 3}}\nSix years ago in London, three robbers attempted to steal jewels from a building, but were stopped by the police and arrested. In the present, Batook Patel ([[Boman Irani]]) is a wealthy and successful businessman with three beautiful daughters: Ganga ([[Jacqueline Fernandez]]), Jamuna ([[Lisa Haydon]]), and Saraswati ([[Nargis Fakhri]]). However, he does not want his daughters to get married, as he claims that all the women in his family are cursed if they get married.\n\nOne night, at a friend's bachelorette party, the girls reveal to their friend that secretly, they each have a boyfriend. Jamuna's boyfriend is Teddy ([[Riteish Deshmukh]]), who wants to be a racecar driver. Teddy is skilled at racing, but during an important race, his car runs out of gas, and loses. Saraswati's boyfriend is Bunty ([[Abhishek Bachchan]]), who wants to be rapper. During a talent competition, the judge claims that his rapping talent is ordinary. Bunty then raps in Hindi swear words at the judge. Unfortunately, the judge knows Hindi, and disqualifies him. Ganga's boyfriend is Sandy ([[Akshay Kumar]]), who wants to be a professional football/soccer player. During tryouts for a team, the coach, who is racist, tells him he cannot join, and calls him a \"Bloody Indian\", which triggers Sandy's evil personality, Sundi, to come out and attack the coach and team. Sandy learns that Sundi comes out whenever he hears the word \"Indian\", and his Dissociative Identity Disorder comes from being depressed about not having enough money to make a living. Sandy sees Batook's success in the paper, and decides to date his doctor, and Batook's daughter, Ganga. When the girls tell their dad that they each have a boyfriend, Batook goes to his friend, Aakhri Pasta ([[Chunkey Pandey]]), who owns an Italian restaurant. Batook convinces Pasta to dress up as the family's fortune teller, Aakhri Aasta. Aasta claims that when Ganga's husband first steps foot into Batook's house, Jamuna's husband first sees Batook, or when Saraswati's husband first speaks to Batook, then Batook will have a heart attack, and die. The girls, wanting to keep their boyfriends, have them fake disabilities. Sandy rides around in a motorized wheelchair, and claims he can't use his feet. Teddy wears sunglasses and uses a cane, and claims he is blind. Bunty uses sign language, and claims that he is mute. Batook decides to test the boys to make sure if they are really disabled, by putting ants in Sandy's pants, having Teddy jump in an empty pool, and injuring Bunty to see if he screams. When Batook is out of the house, the boys reveal themselves to each other as not being disabled. Since they all want Batook's money, they decide not to tell on each other, as they each have a recording of the other. At Pasta's restaurant, Batook reveals to Pasta that his daughters are actually the daughters of Urja Nagre ([[Jackie Shroff]]), an underworld crime lord. Nagre was caught when someone informed the police. While in jail, Nagre requested Batook take care of his daughters in London, but make sure that they never found out that Nagre was their father. Batook also reveals that he was the one who informed the police, and did not want the girls to marry until his sons(the robbers in the beginning of the film) got out of prison. Unbeknownst to him, Nagre is out of prison, and has arrived in London.\n\nWhile the girls prepare a wax statue for Batook, the boys go into town, where some gangsters are teasing some girls. Suddenly, Nagre appears, and attack the gangsters. After the gangsters run away, Nagre sees the boys, and ask why did not help. The boys claim that they were disabled. Bunty, who was in the wheelchair at the time, claims he was crippled. Sandy, holding Teddy's cane, claims he is blind, and that Teddy is mute. Later, Nagre goes to Batook's office, and ask him about his daughters's future husbands. Batook says that while the girls' future husbands are disabled, he knows three normal men who are suitable for the daughters. Batook takes Nagre to a Gurdwara to see his sons, Rishi ([[Samir Kochhar]]), Rohan ([[Nikitin Dheer]]), and Rajeev ([[Aarav Chowdhary]]), claiming they are orphans who do community service. Nagre decides that the three are suitable for his daughters.\n\nAt Batook's house, Nagre claims that Batook owes Nagre 5000 crores (50 billion) of British Pounds. Nagre gives Batook and the boys 10 days to make up the money, or Ganga, Jamuna, and Saraswati must marry Rishi, Rohan, and Rajeev. During these ten days, Nagre and his \"sons\" will also live in Batook's house, meaning that while in front of both Batook and Nagre, Sandy, Teddy, and Bunty must act as blind-disabled, mute-blind, and disabled-mute. Sandy, Teddy, and Bunty come up with a plan to get rid of Nagre's sons. During a St. Patrick's Day party, the girls get Rishi, Rohan, and Rajeev drunk. The next day, they tell each other that they had sex with their respective girls, only to find out that they had sex with the maids. The maids request compensation, or they will sue, of 50 million Pounds. Nagre, learning this, says that the girls will marry the boys of their choosing.\n\nThe next day, the girls take Sandy, Teddy, and Bunty to church, asking for forgiveness. Saraswati, who takes care of disabled children, tells them that two boys were mocking a child because of his disability. The girls feel guilty, because they felt that they were mocking people with disabilities by having the boys act as if they were blind, crippled, and mute. After this, the boys feel guilty, as they were only marrying the girls for money. They go to the warehouse area of Madame Tussauds to meet their girlfriends. They instead find Batook's sons, who explain that they found out the boys were normal. While Teddy and Bunty fight Batook's sons' gang members, Sandy has accidentally heard Teddy say \"Indian\", and Sundi, Sandy's alternate personality, tries to kill Sandy. Batook arrives, and blackmails the boys that Nagre's fortune of 50 million will be divided into 7 parts: Rishi, Rohan, Rajeev, Batook, Sandy, Teddy, and Bunty's shares. Sundi says to divide it into 8 shares, as Sandy/Sundi counts as two people. Aakhri Pasta arrives, and demands his share, splitting it into 9 parts. However, the three maids each demand two shares, one for them, and the other for their unborn children they are now carrying. Nagre then arrives, and explains that he found a recording on Bunty's laptop, which revealed that Bunty, Sandy, and Teddy were not disabled. Nagre also overheard Batook, who told his sons that he was responsible for Nagre's imprisonment. Nagre then attempts to kill everyone in the warehouse, while the lights turn on and off. As the girls arrive, Rishi, Rohan, and Rajeev see them, and hold them at knifepoint in front of Nagre. Sandy, Teddy, and Bunty then rush to save the girls, injuring themselves in the process. As they lay in the girls arms, the boys tell the truth to the girls, and Batook explains how Nagre is their father. The girls forgive the boys, and reconcile with Nagre.\n\n===''Housefull 4'' (2019)===\n{{Main|Housefull 4}}\nHarry ([[Akshay Kumar]]) is a barber who frequently gets bizarre flashes of a past era. He runs a barber shop in London with his brothers Roy ([[Riteish Deshmukh]]) and Max ([[Bobby Deol]]). The three brothers had misplaced a bag of 5 million [[Pound sterling|pounds]] which belonged to gangster Michael Bhai. His henchman Big Bhai ([[Manoj Pahwa]]) constantly demands the money. To fulfil this demand, the three brothers get engaged to the three daughters of London's rich business tycoon Thakral ([[Ranjeet]]): Harry is dating Pooja ([[Pooja Hegde]]), Roy is dating Neha ([[Kriti Kharbanda]]) and Max is dating Kriti ([[Kriti Sanon]]). Mysterious circumstances cause the destination wedding to take place in Sitamgarh, India. On arriving in Sitamgarh, Aakhri Pasta ([[Chunky Pandey]]), a bellboy at their hotel, recognises them as reincarnations of people that lived 600 years ago, i.e. in 1419. Harry realises that the flashes he sees have something to do with what Pasta was talking about and drives to the nearby town of [[Madhavgarh]], where he starts to see the flashes clearly.\n\nIn 1419, Rajkumar Bala Dev Singh ([[Akshay Kumar]]) of Madhavgarh was banished by his father, Maharaj Parikshitap ([[Parikshit Sahni]]), since Bala tried to kill him to become King. Bala's servant Pehla Pasta ([[Chunky Pandey]]) informs him of Sitamgarh - a nearby kingdom whose King, Maharaj Surya Singh Rana ([[Ranjeet]]), is looking for grooms for his three daughters: Rajkumari Madhu ([[Kriti Sanon]]), Rajkumari Mala ([[Pooja Hegde]]) and Rajkumari Meena ([[Kriti Kharbanda]]). Bala plans to marry Rajkumari Madhu, the eldest Princess, so that he becomes the King of Sitamgarh.\n\nBala meets Bangdu Maharaj ([[Riteish Deshmukh]]), an effeminate dance teacher who has an affair with Mala. Meena is secretly in love with the brave bodyguard of the three princesses, Dharamputra ([[Bobby Deol]]). Bala helps the two couples get together and enlists their help for uniting him with Madhu. The plan works and Maharaj Surya Singh Rana announces the wedding of Madhu with Bala, Mala with Bangdu Maharaj, and Meena with Dharamputra. However, Suryabhan ([[Sharad Kelkar]]), Surya Singh Rana's nephew, wants the throne for himself. He kills the brother of Sitamgarh's enemy clan's leader, Gama ([[Rana Daggubati]]) and frames the three couples for it. On the day of the wedding, Gama storms into the fort and fights them to avenge his brother. During the fight, Bala realises that he now truly loves Madhu, even though initially she was just the path to the throne for him. During the fight, the wedding [[Mandapa|mandap]] (altar) collapses and kills the three couples along with Gama.\n\nBack in the present, Harry realises that the grooms are about to marry the wrong brides. Pasta helps Harry remind Roy and Max of their lives as Bangdu Maharaj and Dharamputra, respectively. Just then, they are introduced to Pappu Rangeela ([[Rana Daggubati]]), a [[qawwali]] singer and a family friend of the girls. He is the reincarnation of Gama but has no recollection of his past life. Meanwhile, Pasta finds a painting of their past lives' wedding day which shows Bala with Madhu, Bangdu with Mala, and Dharamputra with Meena. Before they can show this painting to the girls to remind them of their past lives, it gets in the hands of Pappu Rangeela and he remembers his life as Gama.\n\nPappu crashes the wedding and a fight plays out. The fight makes Pooja and Neha remember everything. Soon, Michael Bhai ([[Sharad Kelkar]]), now revealed to be the reincarnation of Suryabhan, shows up at the wedding for his money and shoots Gama. Kriti remembers everything when she sees Michael Bhai and also tells everyone that the wedding mandap hadn't collapsed on its own - it was broken down by Suryabhan to kill everyone so that he could be King. Michael Bhai recounts his past life and boasts how he got Gama's brother killed. Pappu Rangeela hears this and pushes Michael Bhai into the collapsing mandap, thus getting his revenge.\n\nThe film ends on a happy note with Harry, Roy and Max marrying Kriti, Pooja and Neha, thus competing their 600-year-old love story.\n\n==Cast==\n===''Housefull''===\n* [[Akshay Kumar]] as Aarush\n* [[Riteish Deshmukh]] as Babu \"Bob\" Rao\n* [[Deepika Padukone]] as Saundarya \"Sandy\" Bhagayalaxmi Venkateshwari Basapa Rao\n* [[Arjun Rampal]] as Major Krishna Rao\n* [[Lara Dutta]] as Hetal Patel\n* [[Jiah Khan]] as Devika\n* [[Boman Irani]] as Batuk Patel\n* [[Chunkey Pandey]] as Akhri Pasta\n* [[Malaika Arora Khan]] as Pooja\n* [[Randhir Kapoor]] as Kishore Samtani\n* [[Jacqueline Fernandez]] as Dhanno (special appearance in song \"Aapka Kya Hoga\")\n* [[Daisy Irani (actress)|Daisy Irani]] as Batuk Patel's mother\n* [[Lillete Dubey]] as Zulekha Bano\n* [[Vindu Dara Singh]] as security guard\n* [[Suresh Menon]] as Santa Singh\n* [[Manoj Pahwa]] as Banta Singh\n\n===''Housefull 2''===\n[[File:With Team of Housefull 2.JPG|thumb|right|Cast and crew of ''Housefull 2'']]\n* [[Akshay Kumar]] as Sunny K.

The series is produced by [[Sajid Nadiadwala]]. The series stars [[Akshay Kumar]] and [[Ritesh Deshmukh]] as lead cast and [[Boman Irani]] and [[Chunkey Pandey]] in supporting roles as Batuk Patel and Aakhri Pasta respectively. [[Jacqueline Fernandez]] has also appeared in first three films, she however made a special appearance in the first film and played a pivotal role in the second and the third film. Malaika made cameos in the first two movies but didn't appear in the third one. The fourth film, ''[[Housefull 4]]'' featured [[Bobby Deol]], [[Kriti Sanon]], [[Kriti Kharbanda]], [[Pooja Hegde]] and [[Rana Daggubati]] in addition to regular cast. Based on reincarnation theme, it is the most expensive Indian comedy film ever made. [[Farhad Samji]] directed the fourth film.\nEach film starts with a fresh story unrelated with the preceding film's story. However, the theme and the pace remains the same.\n\n==Overview==\n===''Housefull'' (2010)===\n{{Main|Housefull (2010 film)}}\nAarush, ([[Akshay Kumar]]) is a jinxed loser who stays with his friend, Bob ([[Ritesh Deshmukh]]) and his wife, Hetal ([[Lara Dutta]]), both working at a [[casino]] owned by Mr.Kishore Samtani ([[Randhir Kapoor]]). Although at first Hetal is displeased with Aarush's presence, he proves to be a kind-hearted man looking for family. Bob and Hetal decide to get him married to their boss' daughter, Devika Samtani ([[Jiah Khan]]). After the marriage, on their honeymoon in Italy, Devika leaves him for her long-time American boyfriend Benny. Dejected, Aarush tries to commit suicide by drowning in the sea but is saved by a girl Sandy ([[Deepika Padukone]]).\n\nSandy originally thinks Aarush is a pervert, but when Aakhri Pasta ([[Chunkey Pandey]]), the owner of Italy's biggest hotel where Aarush was spending his honeymoon with Devika, tells Sandy that Aarush is a widower, she befriends him and slowly falls in love with him. What she does not know, is that Aakhri Pasta was only joking. She then finds out his wife is alive and leaves him, but he tells her the whole truth to make her understand and she accepts him.\n\nThe only way Aarush can get married to Sandy is by convincing her elder brother, Major Krishna Rao ([[Arjun Rampal]]), a strict Indian Military Intelligence officer who loves and is over-protective of Sandy. Meanwhile, Hetal, in an attempt to reconcile, lies to her father, Batuk Patel ([[Boman Irani]]), that Bob owns a mansion and they have a child. The four rent a mansion to make him believe that Bob owns it, but Batuk accidentally believes that Aarush is married to Hetal, and Bob is the cook. Then, Krishna turns up, much to Aarush's horror, leading to more lies.\n\nFor half of the term, the four must pretend that the mansion is owned by Bob, and the rest must pretend that Aarush owns it. An overly suspicious Krishna sees Bob and Hetal working at the casino and uses a lie detector to find the truth. After Sandy objects, Krishna apologises and agrees to Aarush and Sandy's marriage. The whole family is invited to the Royal Palace, to see Krishna get rewarded by the Queen of England. While this is happening, 2 workers are meant to be installing air conditioning gas for the place, however instead they accidentally supply the hall with laughing gas causing everyone to break into an outburst of laughter. During this laughter, the truth is let out but no one seems to be in the right state of mind.\n\nThe 2 workers meanwhile stop the gas from spreading \u2013 everyone comes back to their senses. Aarush is still telling Krishna the truth, leading Krishna to break off Sandy's engagement. However, after Sandy tearfully pleads with him, Krishna lets the two get married. In the end, Hetal and Bob live together with Batuk Patel, and Aarush's luck changes for the better.\n\n===''Housefull 2'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Housefull 2}}\nThis film is an adaptation of the [[Marathi language|Marathi]] film \"Dam Dam Diga Diga\", released in 2008 and Telugu film [[Hungama (2005 film)|Hungama]], released in 2005, which is a remake of Malayalam movie [[Mattupetti Machan]], released in 1998,\nThe two cousins Heena ([[Asin Thottumkal]]) and Bobby ([[Jacqueline Fernandez]]), daughters of the Kapoor family, hate each other very much. They start quarrelling over something relating to their duties of Animals' Law Authority. Their fathers, Chintu ([[Rishi Kapoor]]) and Dabboo ([[Randhir Kapoor]]), are step-brothers who hate each other to the very core. Even their wives hate each other. Chintu wants the richest son-in law for his daughter, Heena, while Dabboo too wants the same for his daughter, Bobby. Aakhri Pasta ([[Chunky Pandey]]), a marriage counsellor, is ordered by both Chintu and Dabboo to find the best son-in-law. Aakhri Pasta brings Mr. Babani ([[Virendra Saxena]]) to discuss Babani's son Jai.\n\nWhen Chintu misinterprets one of Aakhri's comments, he verbally abuses Babani while shouting. Babani suffers from a condition that affects his heart when he hears loud noises. Due to Chintu's shouting, Babani suffers a heart attack, landing him in a hospital. Babani's son Jai ([[Shreyas Talpade]]) comes to know of this and gets angry, then vows revenge, telling his friend Jolly/Jwala ([[Ritesh Deshmukh]]), who is the son of billionaire J.D. ([[Mithun Chakraborty]]), to go to Chintu, agree to marry his daughter and then break off the wedding at the last minute. Jolly is busy trying to introduce his girlfriend to his own father and does not want to get involved. He suggests Max ([[John Abraham (actor)|John Abraham]]), their former college mate and a thief, to do the job. Jay goes with Max as his driver but somehow, they end in the wrong house and go to Dabboo's house.\n\nJay and Max later find out their mistake. Jai, still wanting revenge, doesn't know what to do and Jolly suggests another former sleazy college mate, Sunny ([[Akshay Kumar]]). Jolly goes with Sunny as his bodyguard because Max and Sunny are sworn enemies and as Dabboo's house and Chintu's house are right next to each other, their plan may get destroyed. Sunny and Jolly encounter a crocodile and Max and Jay encounter a snake. They manage to survive the attack.\n\nWhile Heena and Bobby are on a cruise, they accidentally end up on an island. Max and Sunny become friends again, while Heena and Bobby become friends. They find a resort and go home. Dabboo gets Jolly (Max) engaged to Bobby and Chintu gets Jolly (Sunny) engaged to Heena. The day of the engagement, Chintu blindfolds Jolly, Sunny, Jai and Heena and takes them to J.D.'s house. After seeing the real Jolly holding Sunny's garland, J.D. believes that Jolly got engaged to Heena. Luckily, Sunny convinces him. Jolly calls them at midnight and reveals his father's secret of being Jagga Daaku. He also reveals that his real name is Jwala. After Sunny fools Chintu, Chintu calls Dabboo in excitement and tells him that his daughter, Heena, is marrying Jolly, the son of J.D. Confused, and believing Max to be Jolly, Dabboo takes Max and Bobby to J.D.'s mansion. Sunny handles the situation well by fooling J.D. by taking the name of his religion and tells him that Max is Jolly's friend and Bobby is Max's fianc\u00e9 (though actually it is true) and Max's father is against his and Bobby's marriage. J.D. then welcomes Bobby, Max and her family to his house and tells them to stay there up to Bobby and Max's marriage.\n\nBatuk Patel ([[Boman Irani]]) arrives with his daughter Parul ([[Shazahn Padamsee]]) to make things worse. Jay and Jwala come to receive them from the airport. But when they see Parul, Jay and Jwala lie that Jay is Jolly. Parul becomes happy hearing this as they secretly love each other. Jelo ([[Zarine Khan]]) gives Jwala the ultimatum &nbsp;\u2013 take me to your house or forget me. To help Jwala, Sunny lies to J.D., saying that Jelo is his fianc\u00e9, and J.D. again agrees to let her live there as Sunny takes the name of his religion. Sunny and Max lie to their respective fathers-in-law that the other guy is the son of J.D. and a maid servant in the mansion. This creates a lot of confusion.\n\nWhen Sunny's father as well as Max's 'Guru' tells them never to break anyone's heart, Sunny and Max tell the truth to Heena and Bobby. Enraged, Bobby and Heena slap Max and Sunny respectively and tell them that they never want to see their faces again. But thinking that instead of telling the truth, Sunny and Max could have done more wrong with them, the two sisters pardon the two boys on the very next day. There Jay and Jolly also let off their plan of revenge on Kapoors on Jay's father's advice. Then Henna proposes Sunny in Sunny's style and Bobby proposes Max in Max's style.\n\nOn the day of the four couples' marriage, J.D. and the other brides' fathers learn the truth about the grooms and that they have been lying all this time. Finally Bobby and Heena convince their fathers to forget their enmity and live together as blood brothers. Chintu and Dabboo join hands and so do their wives. But J.D. was not convinced by them telling the truth, so he turns back into Jagga Daku and starts frightening the families with his gun. He tries to shoot Sunny with his gun as Sunny runs towards J.D. to save him from the falling chandelier and then he understands what was happening. In the end, all the grooms get married to their respective girlfriends.\n\n===''Housefull 3'' (2016)===\n{{Main|Housefull 3}}\nSix years ago in London, three robbers attempted to steal jewels from a building, but were stopped by the police and arrested. In the present, Batook Patel ([[Boman Irani]]) is a wealthy and successful businessman with three beautiful daughters: Ganga ([[Jacqueline Fernandez]]), Jamuna ([[Lisa Haydon]]), and Saraswati ([[Nargis Fakhri]]). However, he does not want his daughters to get married, as he claims that all the women in his family are cursed if they get married.\n\nOne night, at a friend's bachelorette party, the girls reveal to their friend that secretly, they each have a boyfriend. Jamuna's boyfriend is Teddy ([[Riteish Deshmukh]]), who wants to be a racecar driver. Teddy is skilled at racing, but during an important race, his car runs out of gas, and loses. Saraswati's boyfriend is Bunty ([[Abhishek Bachchan]]), who wants to be rapper. During a talent competition, the judge claims that his rapping talent is ordinary. Bunty then raps in Hindi swear words at the judge. Unfortunately, the judge knows Hindi, and disqualifies him. Ganga's boyfriend is Sandy ([[Akshay Kumar]]), who wants to be a professional football/soccer player. During tryouts for a team, the coach, who is racist, tells him he cannot join, and calls him a \"Bloody Indian\", which triggers Sandy's evil personality, Sundi, to come out and attack the coach and team. Sandy learns that Sundi comes out whenever he hears the word \"Indian\", and his Dissociative Identity Disorder comes from being depressed about not having enough money to make a living. Sandy sees Batook's success in the paper, and decides to date his doctor, and Batook's daughter, Ganga. When the girls tell their dad that they each have a boyfriend, Batook goes to his friend, Aakhri Pasta ([[Chunkey Pandey]]), who owns an Italian restaurant. Batook convinces Pasta to dress up as the family's fortune teller, Aakhri Aasta. Aasta claims that when Ganga's husband first steps foot into Batook's house, Jamuna's husband first sees Batook, or when Saraswati's husband first speaks to Batook, then Batook will have a heart attack, and die. The girls, wanting to keep their boyfriends, have them fake disabilities. Sandy rides around in a motorized wheelchair, and claims he can't use his feet. Teddy wears sunglasses and uses a cane, and claims he is blind. Bunty uses sign language, and claims that he is mute. Batook decides to test the boys to make sure if they are really disabled, by putting ants in Sandy's pants, having Teddy jump in an empty pool, and injuring Bunty to see if he screams. When Batook is out of the house, the boys reveal themselves to each other as not being disabled. Since they all want Batook's money, they decide not to tell on each other, as they each have a recording of the other. At Pasta's restaurant, Batook reveals to Pasta that his daughters are actually the daughters of Urja Nagre ([[Jackie Shroff]]), an underworld crime lord. Nagre was caught when someone informed the police. While in jail, Nagre requested Batook take care of his daughters in London, but make sure that they never found out that Nagre was their father. Batook also reveals that he was the one who informed the police, and did not want the girls to marry until his sons(the robbers in the beginning of the film) got out of prison. Unbeknownst to him, Nagre is out of prison, and has arrived in London.\n\nWhile the girls prepare a wax statue for Batook, the boys go into town, where some gangsters are teasing some girls. Suddenly, Nagre appears, and attack the gangsters. After the gangsters run away, Nagre sees the boys, and ask why did not help. The boys claim that they were disabled. Bunty, who was in the wheelchair at the time, claims he was crippled. Sandy, holding Teddy's cane, claims he is blind, and that Teddy is mute. Later, Nagre goes to Batook's office, and ask him about his daughters's future husbands. Batook says that while the girls' future husbands are disabled, he knows three normal men who are suitable for the daughters. Batook takes Nagre to a Gurdwara to see his sons, Rishi ([[Samir Kochhar]]), Rohan ([[Nikitin Dheer]]), and Rajeev ([[Aarav Chowdhary]]), claiming they are orphans who do community service. Nagre decides that the three are suitable for his daughters.\n\nAt Batook's house, Nagre claims that Batook owes Nagre 5000 crores (50 billion) of British Pounds. Nagre gives Batook and the boys 10 days to make up the money, or Ganga, Jamuna, and Saraswati must marry Rishi, Rohan, and Rajeev. During these 10 days, Nagre and his \"sons\" will also live in Batook's house, meaning that while in front of both Batook and Nagre, Sandy, Teddy, and Bunty must act as blind-disabled, mute-blind, and disabled-mute. Sandy, Teddy, and Bunty come up with a plan to get rid of Nagre's sons. During a St. Patrick's Day party, the girls get Rishi, Rohan, and Rajeev drunk. The next day, they tell each other that they had sex with their respective girls, only to find out that they had sex with the maids. The maids request compensation, or they will sue, of 50 million Pounds. Nagre, learning this, says that the girls will marry the boys of their choosing.\n\nThe next day, the girls take Sandy, Teddy, and Bunty to church, asking for forgiveness. Saraswati, who takes care of disabled children, tells them that two boys were mocking a child because of his disability. The girls feel guilty, because they felt that they were mocking people with disabilities by having the boys act as if they were blind, crippled, and mute. After this, the boys feel guilty, as they were only marrying the girls for money. They go to the warehouse area of Madame Tussauds to meet their girlfriends. They instead find Batook's sons, who explain that they found out the boys were normal. While Teddy and Bunty fight Batook's sons' gang members, Sandy has accidentally heard Teddy say \"Indian\", and Sundi, Sandy's alternate personality, tries to kill Sandy. Batook arrives, and blackmails the boys that Nagre's fortune of 50 million will be divided into 7 parts: Rishi, Rohan, Rajeev, Batook, Sandy, Teddy, and Bunty's shares. Sundi says to divide it into 8 shares, as Sandy/Sundi counts as two people. Aakhri Pasta arrives, and demands his share, splitting it into 9 parts. However, the three maids each demand two shares, one for them, and the other for their unborn children they are now carrying. Nagre then arrives, and explains that he found a recording on Bunty's laptop, which revealed that Bunty, Sandy, and Teddy were not disabled. Nagre also overheard Batook, who told his sons that he was responsible for Nagre's imprisonment. Nagre then attempts to kill everyone in the warehouse, while the lights turn on and off. As the girls arrive, Rishi, Rohan, and Rajeev see them, and hold them at knifepoint in front of Nagre. Sandy, Teddy, and Bunty then rush to save the girls, injuring themselves in the process. As they lay in the girls arms, the boys tell the truth to the girls, and Batook explains how Nagre is their father. The girls forgive the boys, and reconcile with Nagre.\n\n===''Housefull 4'' (2019)===\n{{Main|Housefull 4}}\nHarry ([[Akshay Kumar]]) is a barber who frequently gets bizarre flashes of a past era. He runs a barber shop in London with his brothers Roy ([[Riteish Deshmukh]]) and Max ([[Bobby Deol]]). The three brothers had misplaced a bag of 5 million [[Pound sterling|pounds]] which belonged to gangster Michael Bhai. His henchman Big Bhai ([[Manoj Pahwa]]) constantly demands the money. To fulfil this demand, the three brothers get engaged to the three daughters of London's rich business tycoon Thakral ([[Ranjeet]]): Harry is dating Pooja ([[Pooja Hegde]]), Roy is dating Neha ([[Kriti Kharbanda]]) and Max is dating Kriti ([[Kriti Sanon]]). Mysterious circumstances cause the destination wedding to take place in Sitamgarh, India. On arriving in Sitamgarh, Aakhri Pasta ([[Chunky Pandey]]), a bellboy at their hotel, recognises them as reincarnations of people that lived 600 years ago, i.e. in 1419. Harry realises that the flashes he sees have something to do with what Pasta was talking about and drives to the nearby town of [[Madhavgarh]], where he starts to see the flashes clearly.\n\nIn 1419, Rajkumar Bala Dev Singh ([[Akshay Kumar]]) of Madhavgarh was banished by his father, Maharaj Parikshitap ([[Parikshit Sahni]]), since Bala tried to kill him to become King. Bala's servant Pehla Pasta ([[Chunky Pandey]]) informs him of Sitamgarh - a nearby kingdom whose King, Maharaj Surya Singh Rana ([[Ranjeet]]), is looking for grooms for his three daughters: Rajkumari Madhu ([[Kriti Sanon]]), Rajkumari Mala ([[Pooja Hegde]]) and Rajkumari Meena ([[Kriti Kharbanda]]). Bala plans to marry Rajkumari Madhu, the eldest Princess, so that he becomes the King of Sitamgarh.\n\nBala meets Bangdu Maharaj ([[Riteish Deshmukh]]), an effeminate dance teacher who has an affair with Mala. Meena is secretly in love with the brave bodyguard of the three princesses, Dharamputra ([[Bobby Deol]]). Bala helps the two couples get together and enlists their help for uniting him with Madhu. The plan works and Maharaj Surya Singh Rana announces the wedding of Madhu with Bala, Mala with Bangdu Maharaj, and Meena with Dharamputra. However, Suryabhan ([[Sharad Kelkar]]), Surya Singh Rana's nephew, wants the throne for himself. He kills the brother of Sitamgarh's enemy clan's leader, Gama ([[Rana Daggubati]]) and frames the three couples for it. On the day of the wedding, Gama storms into the fort and fights them to avenge his brother. During the fight, Bala realises that he now truly loves Madhu, even though initially she was just the path to the throne for him. During the fight, the wedding [[Mandapa|mandap]] (altar) collapses and kills the three couples along with Gama.\n\nBack in the present, Harry realises that the grooms are about to marry the wrong brides. Pasta helps Harry remind Roy and Max of their lives as Bangdu Maharaj and Dharamputra, respectively. Just then, they are introduced to Pappu Rangeela ([[Rana Daggubati]]), a [[qawwali]] singer and a family friend of the girls. He is the reincarnation of Gama but has no recollection of his past life. Meanwhile, Pasta finds a painting of their past lives' wedding day which shows Bala with Madhu, Bangdu with Mala, and Dharamputra with Meena. Before they can show this painting to the girls to remind them of their past lives, it gets in the hands of Pappu Rangeela and he remembers his life as Gama.\n\nPappu crashes the wedding and a fight plays out. The fight makes Pooja and Neha remember everything. Soon, Michael Bhai ([[Sharad Kelkar]]), now revealed to be the reincarnation of Suryabhan, shows up at the wedding for his money and shoots Gama. Kriti remembers everything when she sees Michael Bhai and also tells everyone that the wedding mandap hadn't collapsed on its own - it was broken down by Suryabhan to kill everyone so that he could be King. Michael Bhai recounts his past life and boasts how he got Gama's brother killed. Pappu Rangeela hears this and pushes Michael Bhai into the collapsing mandap, thus getting his revenge.\n\nThe film ends on a happy note with Harry, Roy and Max marrying Kriti, Pooja and Neha, thus competing their 600-year-old love story.\n\n==Cast==\n===''Housefull''===\n* [[Akshay Kumar]] as Aarush\n* [[Riteish Deshmukh]] as Babu \"Bob\" Rao\n* [[Deepika Padukone]] as Saundarya \"Sandy\" Bhagayalaxmi Venkateshwari Basapa Rao\n* [[Arjun Rampal]] as Major Krishna Rao\n* [[Lara Dutta]] as Hetal Patel\n* [[Jiah Khan]] as Devika\n* [[Boman Irani]] as Batuk Patel\n* [[Chunkey Pandey]] as Akhri Pasta\n* [[Malaika Arora Khan]] as Pooja\n* [[Randhir Kapoor]] as Kishore Samtani\n* [[Jacqueline Fernandez]] as Dhanno (special appearance in song \"Aapka Kya Hoga\")\n* [[Daisy Irani (actress)|Daisy Irani]] as Batuk Patel's mother\n* [[Lillete Dubey]] as Zulekha Bano\n* [[Vindu Dara Singh]] as security guard\n* [[Suresh Menon]] as Santa Singh\n* [[Manoj Pahwa]] as Banta Singh\n\n===''Housefull 2''===\n[[File:With Team of Housefull 2.JPG|thumb|right|Cast and crew of ''Housefull 2'']]\n* [[Akshay Kumar]] as Sunny K.

She is voiced primarily by [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] actress and singer [[Idina Menzel]]. She is voiced by [[Eva Bella]] as a young child and by Spencer Ganus as a teenager in ''Frozen''. In ''Frozen II'', young Elsa is voiced by Mattea Conforti (at the start of the film) and Eva Bella (archive audio).\n\nCreated by directors [[Chris Buck]] and [[Jennifer Lee (filmmaker)|Jennifer Lee]], Elsa is loosely based on the [[title character]] of \"[[The Snow Queen]]\", a Danish fairytale by [[Hans Christian Andersen]]. In the Disney film adaptation, she is introduced as a princess in the fictional [[Scandinavia]]n Kingdom of [[Arendelle]], heiress to the throne and the elder sister of [[Anna (Frozen)|Princess Anna]] ([[Kristen Bell]]). Elsa has the magical ability to create and manipulate ice and snow. She inadvertently sends Arendelle into an eternal winter on the evening of her coronation. Throughout the film, she struggles first with controlling and concealing her abilities and then with liberating herself from her fears of unintentionally harming others, especially her younger sister.\n\nThe Snow Queen character, neutral but cold-hearted in the original fairytale and villain in numerous adaptations of the character, proved difficult to adapt to film due to her transparent depiction. Several film executives, including [[Walt Disney]], attempted to build on the character, and a number of scheduled film adaptions were shelved when they could not work out the character. Buck and his co-director, [[Jennifer Lee (filmmaker)|Jennifer Lee]], were ultimately able to solve the dilemma by depicting Elsa and Anna as sisters. As much as Anna's struggle is external, Elsa's is internal. This led to Elsa being gradually rewritten as a sympathetic, misunderstood character.\n\nElsa has received largely positive reception from reviewers, who praised her complex characterization and vulnerability. Menzel was also widely praised for her vocal performance of Elsa, especially that of her performance of the song \"[[Let It Go (Disney song)|Let It Go]]\", with critics frequently calling her a \"powerhouse\".<ref name=Das/>\n\n==Development==\n===Origins and concept===\n[[File:Snow Queen by Elena Ringo.jpg|thumbnail|left|250px|An illustration of [[the Snow Queen]], the character Elsa is based upon.]]\nAttempts were made as early as 1937 by [[Walt Disney]] to adapt Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale, \"[[The Snow Queen]]\", into a film. The tale focuses on two children, one named Gerda, who served as the basis for [[Anna (Frozen)|Princess Anna]], and the other named Kai, who is \"cursed with negativity\" after his eyes are pierced with shards of glass from an enchanted mirror and is later kidnapped by the Snow Queen.<ref name=Ekberg/><ref name=SCMP>{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/magazines/48hrs/article/1379844/disney-brings-snow-queen-cold |title=Disney brings The Snow Queen in from the cold |work=South China Morning Post |date=December 19, 2013 |accessdate=December 22, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224054702/http://www.scmp.com/magazines/48hrs/article/1379844/disney-brings-snow-queen-cold |archivedate=December 24, 2013 }}</ref> However, Disney struggled with creating a believable, multi-dimensional adaption of the fairy tale's [[title character]],<ref name=\"Jim Hill\"/> who was intended to be a villain.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.empireonline.com/features/frozen-character-guide/p2 |title=The Frozen Directors' Character Guide |work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |accessdate=January 6, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107082813/http://www.empireonline.com/features/frozen-character-guide/p2 |archivedate=January 7, 2014 }}</ref> In the story, she is described as \"a woman, dressed in garments of white gauze, which looked like millions of starry snow-flakes linked together.

In 2011, director [[Chris Buck]] began work on another attempted adaption and also faced challenges with the Snow Queen [[Character (arts)|character]]. Producer Peter Del Vecho explained that this was primarily because she was not relatable and too isolated, having no personal connections. As a result, they could not explain her motivations. After several changes were proposed, someone on the writing team suggested making the Snow Queen Anna's sister. \"Once we realized that these characters could be siblings and have a relationship, everything changed,\" Del Vecho relayed.<ref name=\"Jim Hill\"/>\n\nThe Snow Queen, now given the name Elsa, continued to be cast as a villain,<ref name=IvanZadeh>{{cite news|last=Ivan-Zadeh |first=Larushka |url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/12/08/frozen-creators-its-disney-but-a-little-different-4221547/ |title=Frozen creators: It's Disney\u2014but a little different |newspaper=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |date=December 8, 2013 |accessdate=January 6, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107080749/http://metro.co.uk/2013/12/08/frozen-creators-its-disney-but-a-little-different-4221547/ |archivedate=January 7, 2014 }}</ref> and Disney released the following synopsis for ''Frozen'' in May 2013:\n\n{{quote|When Anna is cursed by her estranged sister, the cold-hearted Snow Queen, Anna's only hope of reversing the curse is to survive a perilous but thrilling journey across an icy and unforgiving landscape.

The film's design team was uncertain about how it should look and drew out designs for various ice castles filled with snow. Lasseter suggested basing the structure and patterns on snowflakes. For example, an enormous snowflake would serve as the foundation, and the palace would be hexagon-shaped. Lasseter also wanted snowflake patterns to influence the manner in which Elsa creates the palace. \"Snowflakes are these tiny little ice crystals that form in mid-air. And when there are changes in temperature and humidity, these snowflakes start growing in a pattern that's known as branching and plating,\" said co-effects supervisor Dale Mayeda. \"[Lasseter] said 'You know, when Elsa builds her ice palace, it would be so amazing if\u2014every step of the way as this castle forms out of thin air\u2014it's just branching and plating, branching and plating all along the way.\"<ref name=Hill1/>\n\nFifty animators worked on the scene in which the castle is built, and one frame required 30 hours to [[3D rendering|render]].<ref name=Hill1/> They later extended similar techniques to Elsa's clothing.

(2013 film)}}\nElsa, princess of Arendelle and heiress to the throne, is born with the ability to create and control ice and snow. As a child, she uses her abilities to create a winter wonderland to play in with her younger sister and best friend, Princess Anna. One night, Elsa accidentally harms Anna with her powers. The king and queen of Arendelle hurriedly take Anna to a tribe of [[troll|mountain trolls]] to be healed. While healing Anna, the trolls inform the royals present that Elsa's abilities will grow, becoming both beautiful and very dangerous so she must learn to control them. While the trolls erase Anna's memory of the incident and of her elder sister's powers in general, Elsa is traumatized by the event. The king and queen take steps to control and hide Elsa's ice powers: the castle gates are locked, Elsa is shut away in her bedroom for most of the time, she is given gloves to help suppress her powers and is told to hold in her emotions as well. Nonetheless her powers continue to grow even stronger and so she becomes terrified of harming those she cares about most. Meanwhile, her sister Anna is less happy and confused by the loss of contact with her elder sister and tries, without success, to coax her out of her room. When the sisters grow into teenagers, the ship in which the king and queen are sailing is capsized in a storm and they drown, leaving Anna and Elsa feeling even more lonely.\n\nThree years pass, and Elsa, now of age, is set to formally succeed her father as the monarch of Arendelle. Though she is afraid of opening the castle to the large crowds, her coronation goes on relatively peacefully. However, at the reception party, Anna asks for Elsa's blessing to marry [[Hans (Frozen)|Prince Hans of the Southern Isles]], whom Anna had met earlier that day. Elsa refuses to bless Hans' offer to marry Anna; he is someone she barely knows, prompting an argument between the two. Being so upset Elsa accidentally reveals her power. Upon the guests' and her subjects' horror and being accused of [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] and called a monster by the Duke of Weselton, Elsa flees the castle and retreats into the icy mountains. In the process, her emotions unleash an \"eternal\" winter throughout Arendelle. While there, she decides to embrace, finally, all her powers and builds an enormous ice palace where she believes she can live freely without fear of hurting people. She also rebuilds her childhood snowman, Olaf, and unknowingly brings him to life.\n\nAnna, determined to find Elsa and bring her back, travels through the mountains, encountering Olaf and a mountain man named Kristoff. They reach the ice palace, where Anna attempts to persuade Elsa to return home and mend their relationship. When Elsa ultimately resists (due to her memory of hurting Anna as a child with her powers resurfacing), Anna tells her about the state that Arendelle and all its people were left in. Horrified, Elsa lashes out and accidentally freezes Anna's heart. Now even more horrified at the prospect of hurting her sister and people with her powers, Elsa forces Anna, Kristoff and Olaf out by creating a gigantic snow creature (called Marshmallow by Olaf), that is a symbol of her desire to be alone so as to be able to use her powers without hurting anyone. After this, her ice castle evidently becomes darker and more grotesque, reflecting her torment and re-ignited fears. Meanwhile, Anna becomes weaker so and Kristoff takes her back to the trolls, who tell them that only an \"act of true love\" can save her life.\n\nHans and a group of soldiers attack the now ugly ice palace. Elsa fights the Duke of Weselton's two soldiers who attempt to assassinate her. Hans convinces her to spare them to prove that she is not a monster. However, she is knocked unconscious and taken to her castle's dungeon. Hans visits her and urges her to end the winter; Elsa admits that she has no idea how to do so. After he leaves, she is able to break free from the chains by freezing them and escapes the cell, though her fears trigger a massive blizzard. Anna returns to the castle, believing that a romantic kiss from Hans will be the \"act of true love\" to save her. Instead, he informs her that his offer of marriage (engagement) had been the first step of a plot to get him the throne of Arendelle. Olaf tells Anna that Kristoff is in love with her and she believes that his kiss will cure her. They rush to find Kristoff. Hans confronts Elsa and tells her that she has killed Anna. Devastated, Elsa collapses and the blizzard stops suddenly. Hans approaches her and swings his sword to kill her, but Anna turns away from an approaching Kristoff with her last bit of strength and blocks Hans' attack as she freezes solid. Elsa then sees what has happened and discovers Anna\u2019s fate. Grief begins to overwhelm Elsa, and with a sob, she ultimately hugs Anna as Olaf and the guards look on, revealing Elsa\u2019s not a monster.  \n\nMoments later, Anna begins to thaw, as her choice to save her sister rather than herself constituted the necessary \"act of true love\". Elsa realizes that love is the key to controlling her powers and is able to end the kingdom's eternal winter. Summer returns to Arendelle, Elsa regains the throne and is able to use and safely control her powers, while the sisters' bond is restored. She exiles Hans back to the Southern Isles to face punishment from his family and cuts off trade with Weselton for the Duke's earlier behavior towards her.\n\n====''Frozen Fever''====\n{{main|Frozen Fever}}\nNearly a year after the events of the first film, Elsa tries to make Anna's 19th birthday as perfect as possible a way of making up for the years they spent apart. To do so, she works heavily with Kristoff, [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]] and Olaf to make this a reality. Upon making sure that her surprise party in the palace courtyard is ready, she leaves Kristoff in charge while she goes to get Anna. However, Elsa starts to come down with a cold as she leads Anna on a treasure hunt to find all the gifts that have been made for her. Without realizing it, each sneeze she makes creates small snowmen called \"snowgies\", which create trouble for Kristoff, Sven and Olaf. As Anna notices Elsa's cold getting worse, she tries in vain to get Elsa to stop exerting herself, even taking medicine from Oaken in case Elsa gets sicker. Unfortunately, Elsa's cold causes her to become very tired and behave in a seemingly intoxicated-like manner, and she nearly falls from Arendelle's clock tower only for Anna to save her. Upon finally admitting to Anna that she is indeed sick after the previous incident, she allows Anna to escort her home feeling she has ruined everything, and finds that the party has gone off successfully for Anna (as well as discovering her snowgie creations), and still slightly intoxicated, she ends the party by accidentally sneezing into the birthday bugle horn, which inadvertently sends a gigantic snowball all the way to the Southern Isles and hits the now-demoted Hans, causing him to fall into a pile of horse manure. Afterwards, Anna tells a now bedridden Elsa that she has given her the best birthday ever by letting her take care of her.\n\n====''Olaf's Frozen Adventure''====\n{{main|Olaf's Frozen Adventure}}\nElsa appeared in a 21-minute holiday film along with Anna, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf, which debuted in theaters for a limited time engagement<ref>{{cite web|last=Booth|first=Kaitlyn|title=Olaf's Frozen Adventure Trailer For The 21-Minute Featurette In Front Of Coco|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/06/13/olafs-frozen-adventure-trailer-featurette-front-coco/|publisher=[[Bleeding Cool]]|accessdate=December 3, 2017|date=June 13, 2017}}</ref> with Disney\u00b7[[Pixar]]'s ''[[Coco (2017 film)|Coco]]'' on November 22, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|last=Snetiker |first=Marc |title=John Lasseter talks Olaf's Frozen Adventure, debuts first look |url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/06/13/olafs-frozen-adventure-john-lasseter-exclusive/ |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=June 13, 2017 |date=June 13, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170613201807/http://ew.com/movies/2017/06/13/olafs-frozen-adventure-john-lasseter-exclusive/ |archivedate=June 13, 2017 }}</ref> It made its television debut on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on December 14, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=OLAF'S FROZEN ADVENTURE Makes Broadcast Television Debut on ABC, 12/14|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/OLAFS-FROZEN-ADVENTURE-Makes-Broadcast-Television-Debut-on-ABC-1214-20171208|publisher=broadwayworld.com|accessdate=December 8, 2017|date=December 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\nElsa and Anna host the first Christmas Holiday celebration in Arendelle since Elsa opened up the gate, ringing in the season by ringing the Yule Bell. When the townspeople unexpectedly leave early to enjoy their individual holiday customs, the sisters realize they have no family traditions of their own. Elsa laments the fact that because she had isolated herself most of her life, she and Anna were unable to spend time with each other. [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]] decides to look for traditions with Sven's help.\n\nGoing through the town, Olaf encounters various family traditions relating to [[Christmas]], [[Hanukkah]] and [[Winter solstice]]. After a visit to Oaken, Olaf, Sven and their sleigh full of traditions travel through the snowy tundra only for a piece of coal (from a portable sauna given to them by Oaken) to set the sleigh on fire. They slide down a hill and Olaf and Sven end up separated by a chasm. With only a [[fruit cake]], Olaf attempts to travel through the woods and is chased by wolves.\n\nMeanwhile, Anna and Elsa discover some forgotten items in their attic where they find things from their past. Sven returns to [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]] and informs him (in vain), Anna, and Elsa of Olaf's plight. They gather the residents of Arendelle to go look for Olaf. Elsewhere, Olaf manages to escape the wolves, but loses the fruit cake to a hawk and gives up by a tree not too far from the kingdom. Anna and Elsa find him and cheer him up by revealing that they do have a tradition: After Elsa had shut herself away for years, Anna began annually sliding cards and dolls of Olaf under her door. As they all celebrate the holidays, the hawk drops the fruit cake on Olaf. Upon getting the fruit cake back, Olaf declares it \"A Christmas miracle!\"\n\n====''Frozen II''====\n{{main|Frozen II}}\n\nThirty-four years prior to the events of the film, King Runeard, the founder and the first king of Arendelle, establishes a treaty with the tribe of Northuldra by building a [[dam]] in the Northuldra's homeland, the Enchanted Forest in order to maintain good relations between the two peoples and to strengthen their power. However, a fight occurs and enrages the spirits of earth, fire, air, and water who inhabit the forest. The spirits disappear and a wall of mist encases everyone in the forest. Runeard\u2019s son Prince Agnarr barely escapes with the help of an unknown savior and became a king.\n\nThree years after her coronation, Queen Elsa of Arendelle celebrates [[autumn]] in the kingdom with her younger sister Princess [[Anna (Frozen)|Anna]], [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]] the [[snowman]], [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]] the kingdom's ice harvester, and Kristoff's [[reindeer]] [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]]. When Elsa hears a mysterious voice calling out to her, she follows it and unintentionally awakens the elemental spirits, which forces everyone in the kingdom to evacuate. Grand Pabbie and the Trolls colony, aware of the situation, arrive at Arendelle and Pabbie informs them that they must set things right by discovering the truth about the kingdom's past.\n\nElsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven embark to the Enchanted Forest, following the mysterious voice. The wind spirit, in the form of a [[tornado]], appears and sweeps everyone in its vortex. Elsa stops it by firing streams of snow, forming a set of ice sculptures. They discover the sculptures are images from their father's past and that their mother, Iduna, was a Northuldra who saved Agnarr. They encounter the Northuldra and a troop of Arendellian soldiers who are still at conflict with one another. The fire spirit appears; Elsa discovers it to be an agitated magical [[salamander]] and calms it down. Elsa and Anna form a truce between the soldiers and the Northuldra by explaining that their mother was Northuldran and their father was Arendellian. Elsa later learns the existence of a fifth spirit who will unite people and the magic of nature.\n\nElsa continues to head north with Anna and Olaf. They find their parents' shipwreck and a map with a route to Ahtohallan, a mythical river told by their mother to contain all explanations of the past. Feeling guilty that her parents were lost at sea in search of answers to her magical powers, Elsa decides to travel alone and sends Anna and Olaf away to safety. Elsa encounters and tames [[Neck (water spirit)|Nokk]], the water spirit who guards the sea to Ahtohallan. Reaching Ahtohallan, Elsa discovers that the voice was the call of Iduna, and that her power was a gift from the magic of nature because of Iduna's selfless act of saving Agnarr, making her the fifth spirit who unites differences. Elsa wields her mother's mantle and also learns that the dam was built as a ruse to reduce the Northuldra's resources because of Runeard's dislike of the tribe's connection with magic, and that Runeard was the one who initiated the conflict by killing the leader of the Northuldra. Elsa sends this information to Anna before becoming frozen, having ventured into the most dangerous part of Ahtohallan, which in turn causes Olaf to fade away.\n\nAnna receives Elsa's message and concludes that the dam must be destroyed for peace to be restored. Anna finds and awakens the sleeping gigantic earth spirits, and lures them towards the dam, which is destroyed by boulders hurled by the giants. Elsa thaws out and returns to Arendelle, stopping a flood from the destroyed dam. As the wall of mist disappears, Elsa reunites with Anna and revives Olaf. Kristoff proposes to Anna, who accepts.

In ''Frozen II'', young Elsa is voiced by Mattea Conforti (at the start of the film) and Eva Bella (archive audio).\n\nCreated by directors [[Chris Buck]] and [[Jennifer Lee (filmmaker)|Jennifer Lee]], Elsa is loosely based on the [[title character]] of \"[[The Snow Queen]]\", a Danish fairytale by [[Hans Christian Andersen]]. In the Disney film adaptation, she is introduced as a princess in the fictional [[Scandinavia]]n Kingdom of [[Arendelle]], heiress to the throne and the elder sister of [[Anna (Frozen)|Princess Anna]] ([[Kristen Bell]]). Elsa has the magical ability to create and manipulate ice and snow. She inadvertently sends Arendelle into an eternal winter on the evening of her coronation. Throughout the film, she struggles first with controlling and concealing her abilities and then with liberating herself from her fears of unintentionally harming others, especially her younger sister.\n\nThe Snow Queen character, neutral but cold-hearted in the original fairytale and villain in numerous adaptations of the character, proved difficult to adapt to film due to her transparent depiction. Several film executives, including [[Walt Disney]], attempted to build on the character, and a number of scheduled film adaptions were shelved when they could not work out the character. Buck and his co-director, [[Jennifer Lee (filmmaker)|Jennifer Lee]], were ultimately able to solve the dilemma by depicting Elsa and Anna as sisters. As much as Anna's struggle is external, Elsa's is internal. This led to Elsa being gradually rewritten as a sympathetic, misunderstood character.\n\nElsa has received largely positive reception from reviewers, who praised her complex characterization and vulnerability. Menzel was also widely praised for her vocal performance of Elsa, especially that of her performance of the song \"[[Let It Go (Disney song)|Let It Go]]\", with critics frequently calling her a \"powerhouse\".<ref name=Das/>\n\n==Development==\n===Origins and concept===\n[[File:Snow Queen by Elena Ringo.jpg|thumbnail|left|250px|An illustration of [[the Snow Queen]], the character Elsa is based upon.]]\nAttempts were made as early as 1937 by [[Walt Disney]] to adapt Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale, \"[[The Snow Queen]]\", into a film. The tale focuses on two children, one named Gerda, who served as the basis for [[Anna (Frozen)|Princess Anna]], and the other named Kai, who is \"cursed with negativity\" after his eyes are pierced with shards of glass from an enchanted mirror and is later kidnapped by the Snow Queen.<ref name=Ekberg/><ref name=SCMP>{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/magazines/48hrs/article/1379844/disney-brings-snow-queen-cold |title=Disney brings The Snow Queen in from the cold |work=South China Morning Post |date=December 19, 2013 |accessdate=December 22, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224054702/http://www.scmp.com/magazines/48hrs/article/1379844/disney-brings-snow-queen-cold |archivedate=December 24, 2013 }}</ref> However, Disney struggled with creating a believable, multi-dimensional adaption of the fairy tale's [[title character]],<ref name=\"Jim Hill\"/> who was intended to be a villain.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.empireonline.com/features/frozen-character-guide/p2 |title=The Frozen Directors' Character Guide |work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |accessdate=January 6, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107082813/http://www.empireonline.com/features/frozen-character-guide/p2 |archivedate=January 7, 2014 }}</ref> In the story, she is described as \"a woman, dressed in garments of white gauze, which looked like millions of starry snow-flakes linked together.

In 2011, director [[Chris Buck]] began work on another attempted adaption and also faced challenges with the Snow Queen [[Character (arts)|character]]. Producer Peter Del Vecho explained that this was primarily because she was not relatable and too isolated, having no personal connections. As a result, they could not explain her motivations.

The film's design team was uncertain about how it should look and drew out designs for various ice castles filled with snow. Lasseter suggested basing the structure and patterns on snowflakes. For example, an enormous snowflake would serve as the foundation, and the palace would be hexagon-shaped. Lasseter also wanted snowflake patterns to influence the manner in which Elsa creates the palace. \"Snowflakes are these tiny little ice crystals that form in mid-air. And when there are changes in temperature and humidity, these snowflakes start growing in a pattern that's known as branching and plating,\" said co-effects supervisor Dale Mayeda. \"[Lasseter] said 'You know, when Elsa builds her ice palace, it would be so amazing if\u2014every step of the way as this castle forms out of thin air\u2014it's just branching and plating, branching and plating all along the way.\"<ref name=Hill1/>\n\nFifty animators worked on the scene in which the castle is built, and one frame required 30 hours to [[3D rendering|render]].<ref name=Hill1/> They later extended similar techniques to Elsa's clothing.

While the trolls erase Anna's memory of the incident and of her elder sister's powers in general, Elsa is traumatized by the event. The king and queen take steps to control and hide Elsa's ice powers: the castle gates are locked, Elsa is shut away in her bedroom for most of the time, she is given gloves to help suppress her powers and is told to hold in her emotions as well. Nonetheless her powers continue to grow even stronger and so she becomes terrified of harming those she cares about most. Meanwhile, her sister Anna is less happy and confused by the loss of contact with her elder sister and tries, without success, to coax her out of her room. When the sisters grow into teenagers, the ship in which the king and queen are sailing is capsized in a storm and they drown, leaving Anna and Elsa feeling even more lonely.\n\nThree years pass, and Elsa, now of age, is set to formally succeed her father as the monarch of Arendelle. Though she is afraid of opening the castle to the large crowds, her coronation goes on relatively peacefully. However, at the reception party, Anna asks for Elsa's blessing to marry [[Hans (Frozen)|Prince Hans of the Southern Isles]], whom Anna had met earlier that day. Elsa refuses to bless Hans' offer to marry Anna; he is someone she barely knows, prompting an argument between the two. Being so upset Elsa accidentally reveals her power. Upon the guests' and her subjects' horror and being accused of [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] and called a monster by the Duke of Weselton, Elsa flees the castle and retreats into the icy mountains. In the process, her emotions unleash an \"eternal\" winter throughout Arendelle. While there, she decides to embrace, finally, all her powers and builds an enormous ice palace where she believes she can live freely without fear of hurting people. She also rebuilds her childhood snowman, Olaf, and unknowingly brings him to life.\n\nAnna, determined to find Elsa and bring her back, travels through the mountains, encountering Olaf and a mountain man named Kristoff. They reach the ice palace, where Anna attempts to persuade Elsa to return home and mend their relationship. When Elsa ultimately resists (due to her memory of hurting Anna as a child with her powers resurfacing), Anna tells her about the state that Arendelle and all its people were left in. Horrified, Elsa lashes out and accidentally freezes Anna's heart. Now even more horrified at the prospect of hurting her sister and people with her powers, Elsa forces Anna, Kristoff and Olaf out by creating a gigantic snow creature (called Marshmallow by Olaf), that is a symbol of her desire to be alone so as to be able to use her powers without hurting anyone. After this, her ice castle evidently becomes darker and more grotesque, reflecting her torment and re-ignited fears. Meanwhile, Anna becomes weaker so and Kristoff takes her back to the trolls, who tell them that only an \"act of true love\" can save her life.\n\nHans and a group of soldiers attack the now ugly ice palace. Elsa fights the Duke of Weselton's two soldiers who attempt to assassinate her. Hans convinces her to spare them to prove that she is not a monster. However, she is knocked unconscious and taken to her castle's dungeon. Hans visits her and urges her to end the winter; Elsa admits that she has no idea how to do so. After he leaves, she is able to break free from the chains by freezing them and escapes the cell, though her fears trigger a massive blizzard. Anna returns to the castle, believing that a romantic kiss from Hans will be the \"act of true love\" to save her. Instead, he informs her that his offer of marriage (engagement) had been the first step of a plot to get him the throne of Arendelle. Olaf tells Anna that Kristoff is in love with her and she believes that his kiss will cure her. They rush to find Kristoff. Hans confronts Elsa and tells her that she has killed Anna. Devastated, Elsa collapses and the blizzard stops suddenly. Hans approaches her and swings his sword to kill her, but Anna turns away from an approaching Kristoff with her last bit of strength and blocks Hans' attack as she freezes solid. Elsa then sees what has happened and discovers Anna\u2019s fate. Grief begins to overwhelm Elsa, and with a sob, she ultimately hugs Anna as Olaf and the guards look on, revealing Elsa\u2019s not a monster.  \n\nMoments later, Anna begins to thaw, as her choice to save her sister rather than herself constituted the necessary \"act of true love\". Elsa realizes that love is the key to controlling her powers and is able to end the kingdom's eternal winter. Summer returns to Arendelle, Elsa regains the throne and is able to use and safely control her powers, while the sisters' bond is restored. She exiles Hans back to the Southern Isles to face punishment from his family and cuts off trade with Weselton for the Duke's earlier behavior towards her.\n\n====''Frozen Fever''====\n{{main|Frozen Fever}}\nNearly a year after the events of the first film, Elsa tries to make Anna's 19th birthday as perfect as possible a way of making up for the years they spent apart. To do so, she works heavily with Kristoff, [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]] and Olaf to make this a reality. Upon making sure that her surprise party in the palace courtyard is ready, she leaves Kristoff in charge while she goes to get Anna. However, Elsa starts to come down with a cold as she leads Anna on a treasure hunt to find all the gifts that have been made for her. Without realizing it, each sneeze she makes creates small snowmen called \"snowgies\", which create trouble for Kristoff, Sven and Olaf. As Anna notices Elsa's cold getting worse, she tries in vain to get Elsa to stop exerting herself, even taking medicine from Oaken in case Elsa gets sicker. Unfortunately, Elsa's cold causes her to become very tired and behave in a seemingly intoxicated-like manner, and she nearly falls from Arendelle's clock tower only for Anna to save her. Upon finally admitting to Anna that she is indeed sick after the previous incident, she allows Anna to escort her home feeling she has ruined everything, and finds that the party has gone off successfully for Anna (as well as discovering her snowgie creations), and still slightly intoxicated, she ends the party by accidentally sneezing into the birthday bugle horn, which inadvertently sends a gigantic snowball all the way to the Southern Isles and hits the now-demoted Hans, causing him to fall into a pile of horse manure. Afterwards, Anna tells a now bedridden Elsa that she has given her the best birthday ever by letting her take care of her.\n\n====''Olaf's Frozen Adventure''====\n{{main|Olaf's Frozen Adventure}}\nElsa appeared in a 21-minute holiday film along with Anna, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf, which debuted in theaters for a limited time engagement<ref>{{cite web|last=Booth|first=Kaitlyn|title=Olaf's Frozen Adventure Trailer For The 21-Minute Featurette In Front Of Coco|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/06/13/olafs-frozen-adventure-trailer-featurette-front-coco/|publisher=[[Bleeding Cool]]|accessdate=December 3, 2017|date=June 13, 2017}}</ref> with Disney\u00b7[[Pixar]]'s ''[[Coco (2017 film)|Coco]]'' on November 22, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|last=Snetiker |first=Marc |title=John Lasseter talks Olaf's Frozen Adventure, debuts first look |url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/06/13/olafs-frozen-adventure-john-lasseter-exclusive/ |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=June 13, 2017 |date=June 13, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170613201807/http://ew.com/movies/2017/06/13/olafs-frozen-adventure-john-lasseter-exclusive/ |archivedate=June 13, 2017 }}</ref> It made its television debut on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on December 14, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=OLAF'S FROZEN ADVENTURE Makes Broadcast Television Debut on ABC, 12/14|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/OLAFS-FROZEN-ADVENTURE-Makes-Broadcast-Television-Debut-on-ABC-1214-20171208|publisher=broadwayworld.com|accessdate=December 8, 2017|date=December 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\nElsa and Anna host the first Christmas Holiday celebration in Arendelle since Elsa opened up the gate, ringing in the season by ringing the Yule Bell. When the townspeople unexpectedly leave early to enjoy their individual holiday customs, the sisters realize they have no family traditions of their own. Elsa laments the fact that because she had isolated herself most of her life, she and Anna were unable to spend time with each other. [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]] decides to look for traditions with Sven's help.\n\nGoing through the town, Olaf encounters various family traditions relating to [[Christmas]], [[Hanukkah]] and [[Winter solstice]]. After a visit to Oaken, Olaf, Sven and their sleigh full of traditions travel through the snowy tundra only for a piece of coal (from a portable sauna given to them by Oaken) to set the sleigh on fire. They slide down a hill and Olaf and Sven end up separated by a chasm. With only a [[fruit cake]], Olaf attempts to travel through the woods and is chased by wolves.\n\nMeanwhile, Anna and Elsa discover some forgotten items in their attic where they find things from their past. Sven returns to [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]] and informs him (in vain), Anna, and Elsa of Olaf's plight. They gather the residents of Arendelle to go look for Olaf. Elsewhere, Olaf manages to escape the wolves, but loses the fruit cake to a hawk and gives up by a tree not too far from the kingdom. Anna and Elsa find him and cheer him up by revealing that they do have a tradition: After Elsa had shut herself away for years, Anna began annually sliding cards and dolls of Olaf under her door. As they all celebrate the holidays, the hawk drops the fruit cake on Olaf. Upon getting the fruit cake back, Olaf declares it \"A Christmas miracle!\"\n\n====''Frozen II''====\n{{main|Frozen II}}\n\nThirty-four years prior to the events of the film, King Runeard, the founder and the first king of Arendelle, establishes a treaty with the tribe of Northuldra by building a [[dam]] in the Northuldra's homeland, the Enchanted Forest in order to maintain good relations between the two peoples and to strengthen their power. However, a fight occurs and enrages the spirits of earth, fire, air, and water who inhabit the forest. The spirits disappear and a wall of mist encases everyone in the forest. Runeard\u2019s son Prince Agnarr barely escapes with the help of an unknown savior and became a king.\n\nThree years after her coronation, Queen Elsa of Arendelle celebrates [[autumn]] in the kingdom with her younger sister Princess [[Anna (Frozen)|Anna]], [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]] the [[snowman]], [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]] the kingdom's ice harvester, and Kristoff's [[reindeer]] [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]]. When Elsa hears a mysterious voice calling out to her, she follows it and unintentionally awakens the elemental spirits, which forces everyone in the kingdom to evacuate. Grand Pabbie and the Trolls colony, aware of the situation, arrive at Arendelle and Pabbie informs them that they must set things right by discovering the truth about the kingdom's past.\n\nElsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven embark to the Enchanted Forest, following the mysterious voice. The wind spirit, in the form of a [[tornado]], appears and sweeps everyone in its vortex. Elsa stops it by firing streams of snow, forming a set of ice sculptures. They discover the sculptures are images from their father's past and that their mother, Iduna, was a Northuldra who saved Agnarr. They encounter the Northuldra and a troop of Arendellian soldiers who are still at conflict with one another. The fire spirit appears; Elsa discovers it to be an agitated magical [[salamander]] and calms it down. Elsa and Anna form a truce between the soldiers and the Northuldra by explaining that their mother was Northuldran and their father was Arendellian. Elsa later learns the existence of a fifth spirit who will unite people and the magic of nature.\n\nElsa continues to head north with Anna and Olaf. They find their parents' shipwreck and a map with a route to Ahtohallan, a mythical river told by their mother to contain all explanations of the past. Feeling guilty that her parents were lost at sea in search of answers to her magical powers, Elsa decides to travel alone and sends Anna and Olaf away to safety. Elsa encounters and tames [[Neck (water spirit)|Nokk]], the water spirit who guards the sea to Ahtohallan. Reaching Ahtohallan, Elsa discovers that the voice was the call of Iduna, and that her power was a gift from the magic of nature because of Iduna's selfless act of saving Agnarr, making her the fifth spirit who unites differences. Elsa wields her mother's mantle and also learns that the dam was built as a ruse to reduce the Northuldra's resources because of Runeard's dislike of the tribe's connection with magic, and that Runeard was the one who initiated the conflict by killing the leader of the Northuldra. Elsa sends this information to Anna before becoming frozen, having ventured into the most dangerous part of Ahtohallan, which in turn causes Olaf to fade away.\n\nAnna receives Elsa's message and concludes that the dam must be destroyed for peace to be restored. Anna finds and awakens the sleeping gigantic earth spirits, and lures them towards the dam, which is destroyed by boulders hurled by the giants. Elsa thaws out and returns to Arendelle, stopping a flood from the destroyed dam. As the wall of mist disappears, Elsa reunites with Anna and revives Olaf. Kristoff proposes to Anna, who accepts. Elsa explains that she and Anna are now the bridge between the people and the magical spirits where the bridge has two ends\u2014Anna on the people's side and Elsa on the magical spirits'. Elsa abdicates the throne of Arendelle to Anna, and becomes the protector of the Enchanted Forest, and regularly visits Arendelle as peace is restored throughout the lands.\n\n====''Ralph Breaks the Internet''====\n{{main|Ralph Breaks the Internet}}\nElsa and Anna together with the [[Disney Princess]]es appear in the film. In one scene, [[Vanellope Von Schweetz]] accidentally breaks into the Princess room, where Elsa and other princesses gather together. After a panic, they surround Vanellope and ask why she's here. After learning Vanellope's a princess, Elsa asks \"(Do you have) Magic hands?\" while conjuring ice in her hands in front of her.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/wreck-it-ralph-2-trailer-watch-video-1116859|title=Trailer|last=|first=|date=|website=YouTube|accessdate=2018-06-05}}</ref> In the climax, Elsa and the princesses spot Ralph about to plummet to his doom from the air. The princesses rally together to rescue the bad guy, using their individual abilities to do so. Moana summons the ocean, which Ariel dives into to swim upward and create a spiral. Jasmine and Elsa fly towards the top using Carpet, from which they are able to join with Ariel. Elsa then uses her powers to create an ice slide for Ralph. After he is saved, the princesses introduce themselves as friends of Vanellope, with Elsa adding that anyone who is Vanellope's friend is their friend as well.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n====Merchandise====\n<!-- Along with Anna, Elsa is expected to be officially inducted into the [[Disney Princess]] line-up,<ref name=\"OrlandoSentinel\">{{cite

Teams played a ten-game schedule. The [[Montreal Wanderers]] won the league championship going undefeated, with their only loss of the season coming in a [[Stanley Cup]] challenge series with Kenora.\n\n==League business==\n{{Emergence of the NHL}}\n\n===Executive===\n* Fred McRobie (President)\n* Thomas D'Arcy McGee, Ottawa (1st Vice-President)\n* Gordon Blair, Quebec (2nd Vice-President)\n* [[Emmett Quinn]], Shamrocks (Secretary-Treasurer)\n\nNationals and Grand Trunk applied for franchises but did not get three-fourths approval.\n\n===Rule changes===\n* Teams could have professionals as well as amateurs\n* After a puck strikes a goalie, the rebound could now be played by the defending team without it being called offside\n* A player injured in the first half can sit for ten minutes and the other team has to take off a player.\n\n==Regular season==\n[[Frank McGee (ice hockey)|Frank McGee]] of Ottawa retired to pursue his government career. The Wanderers added two professionals, [[Riley Hern]] from the Portage Lake-Houghton pros and [[Hod Stuart]] from the Pittsburgh pros.\n\nPrior to the season, Ottawa travelled to Winnipeg for a series of exhibition games against Manitoba league teams including the [[Kenora Thistles]], who then came east to play a challenge in Montreal.<ref>{{cite news |work=The Globe |date=January 1, 1907 |title=Kenora Didn't Stay|page=11}}</ref> The [[Montreal Victorias]] hosted the [[St. Nicholas Hockey Club]] from New York in an exhibition on December 22, 1906, defeating them 16\u20133.<ref>{{cite news |work=Montreal Gazette |page=2 |title=Vics Showed Class}}</ref>\n\n===Highlights===\n\nA major battle took place for the game between the Senators and Wanderers on January 12.

The Wanderers would still win, 4\u20132.\n\nAfter the game, a special league meeting was called to hand out discipline, with Victorias and Wanderers wanting Spittal and Alf Smith suspended for the season. The players were not suspended, leading the league president Mr. McRobie to resign, leaving Darcy McGee to take over as president.\n\nOn the next visit of the Ottawa team to Montreal, to play the Victorias, the three Ottawa players were arrested by Montreal police. Eventually Alf Smith and Spittal were fined $20 for their actions and Harry Smith was found not guilty.\n\nThe scoring championship was close, with [[Ernie Russell]] of the Wanderers placing first with 42 goals in 9 games, and [[Russell Bowie]] scoring 38 in 10 games.\n\n===Final standings===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

So a best of three game series was upset to see who the Manitoba League Champion and who defended the cup again the Montreal Wanderers. After losing McGimsie, Si Griffis and Tom Hooper also went down to injury. Kenora signed three players to bolster its team: [[Alf Smith (ice hockey)|Alf Smith]] and [[Rat Westwick]] of Ottawa, and [[Fred Whitcroft]] of [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]] to finish the season. (All three were future Hall of Fame inductees.) By the time of the MPHL playoff, Stanley Cup trustee [[William Foran]] notified Kenora that Smith and Westwick were ineligible for the challenge.\n==Playoff==\nKenora would play and win the MPHL playoff against Brandon to successfully defend the Cup, winning a best-of-three series 2\u20130. Hall and Ross played for Brandon in the series, while Smith, Westwick and Whitcroft played for the Thistles. At the time of the series, the acting Stanley Cup trustee [[William Foran]] had already declared Smith and Westwick ineligible for the challenge series.

Foran ruled that both players were ineligible. The series was supposed to start on March 20 in Kenora but did not. One report was that the ice in the rink was too poor to play on and the rink was closed.<ref>{{cite news |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=March 21, 1907 |title=No Stanley Cup Game At Kenora Last Night |page=5}}</ref> The clubs went ahead and started the series on March 23 in Winnipeg instead, with Smith and Westwick playing. Foran was notified by the press (inaccurately) that Montreal had dropped its protest and that the clubs intended to play anyway. Foran threatened to take the Cup back to Ottawa:\n\n<blockquote>\nIf the two clubs ignore the instructions of the cup trustees by mutually agreeing to play against Westwick and Smith when both were positively informed these men were ineligible to participate in the present cup matches, the series will be treated as void, and the cup will be taken charge of by the trustees.

After losing McGimsie, Si Griffis and Tom Hooper also went down to injury. Kenora signed three players to bolster its team: [[Alf Smith (ice hockey)|Alf Smith]] and [[Rat Westwick]] of Ottawa, and [[Fred Whitcroft]] of [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]] to finish the season.

Foran ruled that both players were ineligible. The series was supposed to start on March 20 in Kenora but did not. One report was that the ice in the rink was too poor to play on and the rink was closed.<ref>{{cite news |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=March 21, 1907 |title=No Stanley Cup Game At Kenora Last Night |page=5}}</ref> The clubs went ahead and started the series on March 23 in Winnipeg instead, with Smith and Westwick playing. Foran was notified by the press (inaccurately) that Montreal had dropped its protest and that the clubs intended to play anyway. Foran threatened to take the Cup back to Ottawa:\n\n<blockquote>\nIf the two clubs ignore the instructions of the cup trustees by mutually agreeing to play against Westwick and Smith when both were positively informed these men were ineligible to participate in the present cup matches, the series will be treated as void, and the cup will be taken charge of by the trustees. It will remain in their possession till the various hockey leagues can educate themselves up to a standard where decent sport will be the order of the day.\u201d<ref>{{Cite news |newspaper=The Globe |date=March 25, 1907 |title=Never Too Late to Mend |pages=9 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe teams went ahead and played the series.
