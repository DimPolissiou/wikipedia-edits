The mouth is moderate in size and is oblique, its [[maxilla]]e reaches a level below the centre of eyes. There is a narrow band of small pointed teeth in each jaw. The body, except for the lower jaw, snout and area above the eyes is covered with moderately small, very finely [[ctenoid]] and larger specimens feel smooth to the touch. The [[lateral line]] is almost straight. There is a long [[dorsal fin]] which has a slight notch separating the spiny and soft-rayed parts of the fin and the spiny part is markedly higher than the soft-rayed part.

There is no singularly accepted scope for the region, and it is sometimes defined as stretching from the Atlantic shores of [[Mauritania]] in the west, to [[Egypt]]'s [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Red Sea]] in the east. Others{{Like whom?|date=January 2019}} have limited it to the countries of [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], and [[Tunisia]], a region that was known by the French during colonial times as \"Afrique du Nord\" and is known by Arabs as the [[Maghreb]] (\"West\", ''The western part of Arab World''). The most commonly accepted definition includes [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]], [[Egypt]], and [[Sudan]], the 6 countries that shape the top North of the African continent. Meanwhile, \"North Africa\", particularly when used in the term ''North Africa and the Middle East'', often refers only to the countries of the Maghreb and Libya. Egypt, being also part of the [[Middle East]], is often considered separately, due to being both North African and Middle Eastern simultaneously.\n\nNorth Africa includes a number of Spanish and Portuguese possessions, [[Plazas de soberan\u00eda]], [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] and the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Madeira]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/figure/United-Nations-definition-of-African-Regions-West-Northern-Central-East-and-Southern_fig3_267971678|title=Figure 5: United Nations definition of African Regions: West, Northern,...|website=ResearchGate.net|accessdate=10 August 2018}}</ref> The countries of North Africa share a common ethnic, cultural and linguistic identity that is unique to this region. Northwest Africa has been inhabited by [[Berbers]] since the beginning of recorded history, while the eastern part of North Africa has been home to the [[Egyptians]].<ref>{{Citation|url=http://cairoscene.com/Buzz/National-Geographic-s-DNA-Analysis-Proves-Egyptians-Are-Only-17-Arab|title=National Geographic Geno Project: Egyptians are North Africans}}</ref> Between the A.D. 600s and 1000s, Arabs from the [[Middle East]] swept across the region in a wave of [[Conquest (military)|Muslim conquest]]. These peoples, physically quite similar, formed a single population in many areas, as Berbers and Egyptians merged into [[Arabic culture|Arabic]] and [[Muslim culture]]. This process of Arabization and Islamization has defined the cultural landscape of North Africa ever since.\n\nThe distinction between North Africa, the [[Sahel]] and the rest of the [[Africa|continent]] is as follows: \n{{Quote|text=\nNineteenth century European [[Exploration|explorers]], attracted by the accounts of Ancient geographers or [[Arab geographers]] of the classical period, followed the routes by the nomadic people of the vast \"empty\" space. They documented the names of the stopping places they discovered or rediscovered, described landscapes, took a few climate measurements and gathered rock samples. Gradually, a map began to fill in the white blotch.\n\nThe [[Sahara]] and the [[Sahel]] entered the geographic corpus by way of naturalist explorers because aridity is the feature that circumscribes the boundaries of the ''[[ecumene]]''. &nbsp;The map details included topographical relief and location of watering holes crucial to long crossings. The Arabic word \"Sahel\" (shore) and \"Sahara\" (desert) made its entry into the vocabulary of geography.\n\nLatitudinally, the \"slopes\" of the arid desert, devoid of continuous human habitation, descend in step-like fashion toward the northern and southern edges of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] that opens to Europe and the Sahel that opens to \"Trab al Sudan.\" Longitudinally, a uniform grid divides the central desert then shrinks back toward the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Red Sea]]. Gradually, the Sahara-Sahel is further divided into a total of twenty sub-areas: central, northern, southern, western, eastern, etc.\n\nIn this way, \"standard\" geography has determined aridity to be the boundary of the ''ecumene''. It identifies settlements based on visible activity without regard for social or political organizations of space in vast, purportedly \"empty\" areas. It gives only cursory acknowledgement to what makes Saharan geography, and for that matter, world geography unique: mobility and the routes by which it flows.\n|title=''An atlas of the Sahara-Sahel : geography, economics and security''<ref>{{Cite book|title=An atlas of the Sahara-Sahel : geography, economics and security.|others=Bossard, Laurent., Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development., Sahel and West Africa Club., OECD iLibrary.|isbn=978-9264222342|location=Paris|oclc=900622439}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe [[Sahel]] or \"African Transition Zone\" has been affected by many formative epochs in North African history ranging from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] occupation to the Arab-Berber control of the [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/tarikhalsudan00sadauoft/page/n6|title=Tarikh es soudan|last=es-Sadi|first=Abderrahman|publisher=Paris E.

The [[Atlas Mountains]] extend across much of northern [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]] and [[Tunisia]]. These mountains are part of the [[fold mountains|fold mountain]] system that also runs through much of [[Southern Europe]]. They recede to the south and east, becoming a [[steppe]] landscape before meeting the [[Sahara]] desert, which covers more than 75 percent of the region. The tallest peaks are in the High Atlas range in south-central Morocco, which has many snow-capped peaks.\n\nSouth of the Atlas Mountains is the dry and barren expanse of the [[Sahara]] desert, which is the largest sand desert in the world.<ref name=\"geology.com\">{{cite web|url=http://geology.com/records/largest-desert.shtml|title=Largest Desert in the World|accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref>  In places the desert is cut by irregular watercourses called wadis\u2014streams that flow only after rainfalls but are usually dry. The Sahara's major landforms include ergs, large seas of sand that sometimes form into huge dunes; the hammada, a level rocky plateau without soil or sand; and the reg, a level plain of gravel or small stones. The Sahara covers the southern part of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, and most of Libya. Only two regions of Libya are outside the desert: [[Tripolitania]] in the northwest and [[Cyrenaica]] in the northeast. Most of Egypt is also desert, with the exception of the Nile River and the irrigated land along its banks. The Nile Valley forms a narrow fertile thread that runs along the length of the country.\n\nSheltered valleys in the [[Atlas Mountains]], the Nile Valley and [[Nile Delta|Delta]], and the Mediterranean coast are the main sources of fertile farming land. A wide variety of valuable crops including cereals, rice and cotton, and woods such as cedar and cork, are grown. Typical Mediterranean crops, such as olives, figs, dates and citrus fruits, also thrive in these areas.

Similarly, the traditional Arabic [[toponym]] [[Maghreb]] (meaning \"the West\") is commonly used to mean the African part of the [[Arab World]], though usually with the exclusion of Egypt.\n\nThe inhabitants of the Spanish [[Canary Islands]] are of mixed Spanish and North African Berber ancestry, and the people of [[Malta]] are of North African ancestry and speak a [[Maltese language|derivative of Arabic]].

The Maghreb or western North Africa on the whole is believed to have been inhabited by [[Berbers]] since at least 10,000 B.C.,<ref>Hsain Ilahiane, [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0810864908 Historical Dictionary of the Berbers] (Imazighen)(2006), p. 112</ref> while the eastern part of North Africa or the [[Nile Valley]] has mainly been home to the [[Egyptians]]. Ancient Egyptians record extensive contact in their Western desert with people that appear to have been Berber or proto-Berber. As the [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] and other rock art findings in the Sahara have shown, the [[Sahara]] also hosted various populations before its rapid [[desertification]] in 3500 B.C and even today continues to host small populations of [[Tuareg people|nomadic trans-Saharan peoples]].\n\nIn the eleventh century, the [[Banu Hilal]] invaded the North African plains and plateaus, but not the mountainous areas such as the [[Tell Atlas]] range, the [[Rif]] or the [[Aur\u00e8s Mountains]] and brought with them [[Hilalian dialects]] of [[Arabic]], which over the centuries have been in significant contact with other languages, including the [[languages of Europe]]. They have contributed to the [[Arabized Berber]] populations.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nThe official language or one of the official languages in all of the countries in North Africa is Arabic.

The Arabic and Berber languages are distantly related, both being members of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic language family]]. The [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]] Berber languages are notably more conservative than those of the coastal cities.\n\nOver the years, Berbers have been influenced by contact with other cultures: [[Greeks]], [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Egyptians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Vandals]], [[Arabs]], [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] and [[Africa]]ns. The cultures of the Maghreb and the Sahara therefore combine indigenous Berber, Arab and elements from neighboring parts of Africa and beyond. In the Sahara, the distinction between sedentary [[oasis]] inhabitants and nomadic [[Bedouin]]s and [[Tuareg people|Tuaregs]] is particularly marked. \n[[File:Flickr - stringer bel - Ait Benhaddou.jpg|thumb|The [[kasbah]] of [[A\u00eft Benhaddou]] in Morocco]]\nThe diverse peoples of North Africa are usually categorized along ethno-linguistic lines. In the Maghreb, where Arab and Berber identities are often integrated, these lines can be blurred. Some Berber-speaking North Africans may identify as \"Arab\" depending on the social and political circumstances, although substantial numbers of Berbers (or ''Amazighen'') have retained a distinct cultural identity which in the 20th century has been expressed as a clear ethnic identification with Berber history and language. Arabic-speaking Northwest Africans, regardless of ethnic background, often identify with Arab history and culture and may share a common vision with other Arabs. This, however, may or may not exclude pride in and identification with Berber and/or other parts of their heritage. Berber political and cultural activists for their part, often referred to as [[Berberism|Berberists]], may view all Northwest Africans as principally Berber, whether they are primarily Berber- or Arabic-speaking.\n\n[[Egyptians]] over the centuries have shifted their language from [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] (in its late form, [[Coptic language|varieties of Coptic]]) to modern [[Egyptian Arabic]] while retaining a sense of national identity that has historically set them apart from other people in the region. Most Egyptians are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]], although there is a significant minority of Coptic Christians.\n\nThe Maghreb formerly had a significant Jewish population, almost all of whom emigrated to France or [[Israel]] when the North African nations gained independence. Prior to the modern establishment of Israel, there were about 600,000\u2013700,000 Jews in Northern Africa, including both [[Sephardi Jews]] (refugees from France, Spain and Portugal from the Renaissance era) as well as indigenous [[Mizrahi Jews]]. Today, less than fifteen thousand remain in the region, almost all in Morocco and Tunisia, and are mostly part of a French-speaking urban elite.

The Carthaginians were of [[Phoenicia]]n origin, with the Roman myth of their origin being that [[Dido]], a Phoenician princess, was granted land by a local ruler based on how much land she could cover with a piece of cowhide. She ingeniously devised a method to extend the cowhide to a high proportion, thus gaining a large territory. She was also rejected by the [[Troy|Trojan]] prince [[Aeneas]] according to [[Virgil]], thus creating a historical enmity between Carthage and [[Rome]], as Aeneas would eventually lay the foundations for Rome. [[Ancient Carthage]] was a commercial power and had a strong navy, but relied on mercenaries for land soldiers. The Carthaginians developed an empire in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and [[Sicily]], the latter being the cause of [[First Punic War]] with the [[Roman Republic|Romans]].\n\nOver a hundred years and more, all Carthaginian territory was eventually conquered by the Romans, resulting in the Carthaginian North African territories becoming the [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman province of Africa]] in 146 B.C.<ref>''The Punic Wars 264\u2013146 BC'', by Nigel Bagnall</ref> This led to tension and eventually [[war|conflict]] between [[Numidia]] and Rome.

The loss of North Africa is considered a pinnacle point in the fall of the Western Roman Empire as Africa had previously been an important grain province that maintained Roman prosperity despite the barbarian incursions, and the wealth required to create new armies. The issue of regaining North Africa became paramount to the Western Empire, but was frustrated by Vandal victories. The focus of Roman energy had to be on the emerging threat of the [[Huns]]. In 468 AD, the Romans made one last serious attempt to invade North Africa but were repelled. This perhaps marks the point of terminal decline for the [[Western Roman Empire]]. The last Roman emperor was deposed in 476 by the [[Herules|Heruli]] general [[Odoacer]]. [[Trade route]]s between [[Europe]] and North Africa remained intact until the coming of Islam. Some Berbers were members of the [[Early African Church]] (but evolved their own [[Donatism|Donatist doctrine]]),<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1624_story_of_africa/page66.shtml The Berbers] BBC World Service: The Story of Africa</ref> some were [[Berber Jews]], and some adhered to [[traditional Berber religion]].

By 700, most of North Africa had come under Muslim rule. Indigenous Berbers subsequently started to form their own polities in response in places such as [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]] and [[Sijilmasa]]. In the eleventh century, a reformist movement made up of members that called themselves the [[Almoravid dynasty]] expanded south into [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].\n\nNorth Africa's populous and flourishing civilization collapsed after exhausting its resources in internal fighting and suffering devastation from the invasion of the [[Banu Sulaym]] and [[Banu Hilal]].

There is no singularly accepted scope for the region, and it is sometimes defined as stretching from the Atlantic shores of [[Mauritania]] in the west, to [[Egypt]]'s [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Red Sea]] in the east. Others{{Like whom?|date=January 2019}} have limited it to the countries of [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], and [[Tunisia]], a region that was known by the French during colonial times as \"Afrique du Nord\" and is known by Arabs as the [[Maghreb]] (\"West\", ''The western part of Arab World''). The most commonly accepted definition includes [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]], [[Egypt]], and [[Sudan]], the 6 countries that shape the top North of the African continent. Meanwhile, \"North Africa\", particularly when used in the term ''North Africa and the Middle East'', often refers only to the countries of the [[Maghreb]] and Libya. Egypt, being also part of the [[Middle East]], is often considered separately, due to being both North African and Middle Eastern simultaneously.\n\nNorth Africa includes a number of Spanish and Portuguese possessions, [[Plazas de soberan\u00eda]], [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] and the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Madeira]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/figure/United-Nations-definition-of-African-Regions-West-Northern-Central-East-and-Southern_fig3_267971678|title=Figure 5: United Nations definition of African Regions: West, Northern,...|website=ResearchGate.net|accessdate=10 August 2018}}</ref> The countries of North Africa share a common ethnic, cultural and linguistic identity that is unique to this region.

These peoples, physically quite similar, formed a single population in many areas, as Berbers and Egyptians merged into [[Arabic culture|Arabic]] and [[Muslim culture]]. This process of Arabization and Islamization has defined the cultural landscape of North Africa ever since.\n\nThe distinction between North Africa, the [[Sahel]] and the rest of the [[Africa|continent]] is as follows: \n{{Quote|text=\nNineteenth century European [[Exploration|explorers]], attracted by the accounts of Ancient geographers or [[Arab geographers]] of the classical period, followed the routes by the nomadic people of the vast \"empty\" space. They documented the names of the stopping places they discovered or rediscovered, described landscapes, took a few climate measurements and gathered rock samples. Gradually, a map began to fill in the white blotch.\n\nThe [[Sahara]] and the [[Sahel]] entered the geographic corpus by way of naturalist explorers because aridity is the feature that circumscribes the boundaries of the ''[[ecumene]]''. &nbsp;The map details included topographical relief and location of watering holes crucial to long crossings. The Arabic word \"Sahel\" (shore) and \"Sahara\" (desert) made its entry into the vocabulary of geography.\n\nLatitudinally, the \"slopes\" of the arid desert, devoid of continuous human habitation, descend in step-like fashion toward the northern and southern edges of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] that opens to Europe and the Sahel that opens to \"Trab al Sudan.\" Longitudinally, a uniform grid divides the central desert then shrinks back toward the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Red Sea]]. Gradually, the Sahara-Sahel is further divided into a total of twenty sub-areas: central, northern, southern, western, eastern, etc.\n\nIn this way, \"standard\" geography has determined aridity to be the boundary of the ''ecumene''. It identifies settlements based on visible activity without regard for social or political organizations of space in vast, purportedly \"empty\" areas. It gives only cursory acknowledgement to what makes Saharan geography, and for that matter, world geography unique: mobility and the routes by which it flows.\n|title=''An atlas of the Sahara-Sahel : geography, economics and security''<ref>{{Cite book|title=An atlas of the Sahara-Sahel : geography, economics and security.|others=Bossard, Laurent., Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development., Sahel and West Africa Club., OECD iLibrary.|isbn=978-9264222342|location=Paris|oclc=900622439}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe [[Sahel]] or \"African Transition Zone\" has been affected by many formative epochs in North African history ranging from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] occupation to the Arab-Berber control of the [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/tarikhalsudan00sadauoft/page/n6|title=Tarikh es soudan|last=es-Sadi|first=Abderrahman|publisher=Paris E.

The [[Atlas Mountains]] extend across much of northern [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]] and [[Tunisia]]. These mountains are part of the [[fold mountains|fold mountain]] system that also runs through much of [[Southern Europe]]. They recede to the south and east, becoming a [[steppe]] landscape before meeting the [[Sahara]] desert, which covers more than 75 percent of the region. The tallest peaks are in the High Atlas range in south-central Morocco, which has many snow-capped peaks.\n\nSouth of the Atlas Mountains is the dry and barren expanse of the [[Sahara]] desert, which is the largest sand desert in the world.<ref name=\"geology.com\">{{cite web|url=http://geology.com/records/largest-desert.shtml|title=Largest Desert in the World|accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref>  In places the desert is cut by irregular watercourses called wadis\u2014streams that flow only after rainfalls but are usually dry. The Sahara's major landforms include ergs, large seas of sand that sometimes form into huge dunes; the hammada, a level rocky plateau without soil or sand; and the reg, a level plain of gravel or small stones. The Sahara covers the southern part of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, and most of Libya. Only two regions of Libya are outside the desert: [[Tripolitania]] in the northwest and [[Cyrenaica]] in the northeast. Most of Egypt is also desert, with the exception of the Nile River and the irrigated land along its banks. The Nile Valley forms a narrow fertile thread that runs along the length of the country.\n\nSheltered valleys in the [[Atlas Mountains]], the Nile Valley and [[Nile Delta|Delta]], and the Mediterranean coast are the main sources of fertile farming land. A wide variety of valuable crops including cereals, rice and cotton, and woods such as cedar and cork, are grown. Typical Mediterranean crops, such as olives, figs, dates and citrus fruits, also thrive in these areas. The Nile Valley is particularly fertile and most of the population in [[Egypt]] live close to the river. Elsewhere, irrigation is essential to improve crop yields on the desert margins.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Definitions==\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border:1px solid #aaa; border-collapse:collapse; font-size:90%; width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ececec;\"\n!

Similarly, the traditional Arabic [[toponym]] [[Maghreb]] (meaning \"the West\") is commonly used to mean the African part of the [[Arab World]], though usually with the exclusion of Egypt.\n\nThe inhabitants of the Spanish [[Canary Islands]] are of mixed Spanish and North African Berber ancestry, and the people of [[Malta]] are of North African ancestry and speak a [[Maltese language|derivative of Arabic]].

The Maghreb or western North Africa on the whole is believed to have been inhabited by [[Berbers]] since at least 10,000 B.C.,<ref>Hsain Ilahiane, [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0810864908 Historical Dictionary of the Berbers] (Imazighen)(2006), p. 112</ref> while the eastern part of North Africa or the [[Nile Valley]] has mainly been home to the [[Egyptians]]. Ancient Egyptians record extensive contact in their Western desert with people that appear to have been Berber or proto-Berber. As the [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] and other rock art findings in the Sahara have shown, the [[Sahara]] also hosted various populations before its rapid [[desertification]] in 3500 B.C and even today continues to host small populations of [[Tuareg people|nomadic trans-Saharan peoples]].\n\nIn the eleventh century, the [[Banu Hilal]] invaded the North African plains and plateaus, but not the mountainous areas such as the [[Tell Atlas]] range, the [[Rif]] or the [[Aur\u00e8s Mountains]] and brought with them [[Hilalian dialects]] of [[Arabic]], which over the centuries have been in significant contact with other languages, including the [[languages of Europe]]. They have contributed to the [[Arabized Berber]] populations.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nThe official language or one of the official languages in all of the countries in North Africa is Arabic.

The Arabic and Berber languages are distantly related, both being members of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic language family]]. The [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]] Berber languages are notably more conservative than those of the coastal cities.\n\nOver the years, Berbers have been influenced by contact with other cultures: [[Greeks]], [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Egyptians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Vandals]], [[Arabs]], [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] and [[Africa]]ns. The cultures of the Maghreb and the Sahara therefore combine indigenous Berber, Arab and elements from neighboring parts of Africa and beyond. In the Sahara, the distinction between sedentary [[oasis]] inhabitants and nomadic [[Bedouin]]s and [[Tuareg people|Tuaregs]] is particularly marked. \n[[File:Flickr - stringer bel - Ait Benhaddou.jpg|thumb|The [[kasbah]] of [[A\u00eft Benhaddou]] in Morocco]]\nThe diverse peoples of North Africa are usually categorized along ethno-linguistic lines. In the Maghreb, where Arab and Berber identities are often integrated, these lines can be blurred. Some Berber-speaking North Africans may identify as \"Arab\" depending on the social and political circumstances, although substantial numbers of Berbers (or ''Amazighen'') have retained a distinct cultural identity which in the 20th century has been expressed as a clear ethnic identification with Berber history and language. Arabic-speaking Northwest Africans, regardless of ethnic background, often identify with Arab history and culture and may share a common vision with other Arabs. This, however, may or may not exclude pride in and identification with Berber and/or other parts of their heritage. Berber political and cultural activists for their part, often referred to as [[Berberism|Berberists]], may view all Northwest Africans as principally Berber, whether they are primarily Berber- or Arabic-speaking.\n\n[[Egyptians]] over the centuries have shifted their language from [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] (in its late form, [[Coptic language|varieties of Coptic]]) to modern [[Egyptian Arabic]] while retaining a sense of national identity that has historically set them apart from other people in the region. Most Egyptians are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]], although there is a significant minority of Coptic Christians.\n\nThe Maghreb formerly had a significant Jewish population, almost all of whom emigrated to France or [[Israel]] when the North African nations gained independence. Prior to the modern establishment of Israel, there were about 600,000\u2013700,000 Jews in Northern Africa, including both [[Sephardi Jews]] (refugees from France, Spain and Portugal from the Renaissance era) as well as indigenous [[Mizrahi Jews]]. Today, less than fifteen thousand remain in the region, almost all in Morocco and Tunisia, and are mostly part of a French-speaking urban elite.

The Carthaginians were of [[Phoenicia]]n origin, with the Roman myth of their origin being that [[Dido]], a Phoenician princess, was granted land by a local ruler based on how much land she could cover with a piece of cowhide. She ingeniously devised a method to extend the cowhide to a high proportion, thus gaining a large territory. She was also rejected by the [[Troy|Trojan]] prince [[Aeneas]] according to [[Virgil]], thus creating a historical enmity between Carthage and [[Rome]], as Aeneas would eventually lay the foundations for Rome. [[Ancient Carthage]] was a commercial power and had a strong navy, but relied on mercenaries for land soldiers. The Carthaginians developed an empire in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and [[Sicily]], the latter being the cause of [[First Punic War]] with the [[Roman Republic|Romans]].\n\nOver a hundred years and more, all Carthaginian territory was eventually conquered by the Romans, resulting in the Carthaginian North African territories becoming the [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman province of Africa]] in 146 B.C.<ref>''The Punic Wars 264\u2013146 BC'', by Nigel Bagnall</ref> This led to tension and eventually [[war|conflict]] between [[Numidia]] and Rome.

The loss of North Africa is considered a pinnacle point in the fall of the Western Roman Empire as Africa had previously been an important grain province that maintained Roman prosperity despite the barbarian incursions, and the wealth required to create new armies. The issue of regaining North Africa became paramount to the Western Empire, but was frustrated by Vandal victories. The focus of Roman energy had to be on the emerging threat of the [[Huns]]. In 468 AD, the Romans made one last serious attempt to invade North Africa but were repelled. This perhaps marks the point of terminal decline for the [[Western Roman Empire]]. The last Roman emperor was deposed in 476 by the [[Herules|Heruli]] general [[Odoacer]]. [[Trade route]]s between [[Europe]] and North Africa remained intact until the coming of Islam. Some Berbers were members of the [[Early African Church]] (but evolved their own [[Donatism|Donatist doctrine]]),<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1624_story_of_africa/page66.shtml The Berbers] BBC World Service: The Story of Africa</ref> some were [[Berber Jews]], and some adhered to [[traditional Berber religion]].

In the eleventh century, a reformist movement made up of members that called themselves the [[Almoravid dynasty]] expanded south into [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].\n\nNorth Africa's populous and flourishing civilization collapsed after exhausting its resources in internal fighting and suffering devastation from the invasion of the [[Banu Sulaym]] and [[Banu Hilal]].

The flight feathers on perched European buzzards are always brown in the nominate subspecies (''B. b. buteo''). Usually the tail will usually be narrowly barred grey-brown and dark brown with a pale tip and a broad dark subterminal band but the tail in palest birds can show a varying amount a white and reduced subterminal band or even appear almost all white. In European buzzards, the underside coloring can be variable but most typically show a brown-streaked white throat with a somewhat darker chest. A pale U across breast is often present; followed by a pale line running down the belly which separates the dark areas on breast-side and flanks. These pale areas tend to have highly variable markings that tend to form irregular bars. Juvenile buzzards are quite similar to adult in the nominate race, being best told apart by having a paler eye, a narrower subterminal band on the tail and underside markings that appear as streaks rather than bars. Furthermore, juveniles may show variable creamy to rufous fringes to upperwing coverts but these also may not be present. Seen from below in flight, buzzards in Europe typically have a dark trailing edge to the wings. If seen from above, one of the best marks is their broad dark subterminal tail band. Flight feathers of typical European buzzards are largely greyish, the aforementioned dark wing linings at front with contrasting paler band along the median coverts. In flight, paler individuals tend to show dark carpal patches that can appears as blackish arches or commas but these may be indistinct in darker individuals or can appear light brownish or faded in paler individuals. Juvenile nominate buzzards are best told apart from adults in flight by the lack of a distinct subterminal band (instead showing fairly even barring throughout) and below by having less sharp and brownish rather than blackish trailing wing edge. Juvenile buzzards show streaking paler parts of under wing and body showing rather than barring as do adults.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Forsman/><ref name= Clark2>Clark, W. S. (1999).

''Flight identification of European raptors''. A&C Black.</ref> Beyond the typical mid-range brownish buzzard, birds in Europe can range from almost uniform black-brown above to mainly white. Extreme dark individuals may range from chocolate brown to blackish with almost no pale showing but a variable, faded U on the breast and with or without faint lighter brown throat streaks. Extreme pale birds are largely whitish with variable widely spaced streaks or arrowheads of light brown about the mid-chest and flanks and may or may not show dark feather-centres on the head, wing-coverts and sometimes all but part of mantle. Individuals can show nearly endless variation of colours and hues in between these extremes and the common buzzard is counted among the most variably plumage diurnal raptors for this reason.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref>Dittrich, W.

The steppe buzzard race shows three main colour morphs, each of which can be predominant in a region of breeding range. It is more distinctly [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] rather than just individually very variable like the nominate race. This may be because, unlike the nominate buzzard, the steppe buzzard is highly migratory. Polymorphism has been linked with migratory behaviour.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref>Rohwer, S., & Paulson, D. R. (1987). ''The avoidance-image hypothesis and color polymorphism in Buteo hawks''. Ornis Scandinavica, 285\u2013290.</ref> The most common type of steppe buzzard is the rufous morph which gives this subspecies its scientific name (''vulpes'' is Latin for \"fox\"). This morph comprises a majority of birds seen in passage east of the [[Mediterranean]].  Rufous morph buzzards are a paler grey-brown above than most nominate ''B. b. buteo''. Compared to the nominate race, rufous ''vulpinus'' show a patterning not dissimilar but generally far more rufous-toned on head, the fringes to mantle wing coverts and, especially, on the tail and the underside. The head is grey-brown with rufous tinges usually while the tail is rufous and can vary from almost unmarked to thinly dark-barred with a subterminal band. The underside can be uniformly pale to dark rufous, barred heavily or lightly with rufous or with dusky barring, usually with darker individuals showing the U as in nominate but with a rufous hue. The pale morph of the steppe buzzard is commonest in the west of its subspecies range, predominantly seen in winter and migration at the various land bridge of the Mediterranean. As in the rufous morph, the pale morph ''vulpinus'' is grey-brown above but the tail is generally marked with thin dark bars and a subterminal band, only showing rufous near the tip. The underside in the pale morph is greyish-white with dark grey-brown or somewhat streaked head to chest and barred belly and chest, occasionally showing darker flanks that can be somewhat rufous. Dark morph ''vulpinus'' tend to be found in the east and southeast of the subspecies range and are easily outnumbered by rufous morph while largely using similar migration points. Dark morph individuals vary from grey-brown to much darker blackish-brown, and have a tail that is dark grey or somewhat mixed grey and rufous, is distinctly marked with dark barring and has a broad, black subterminal band. Dark morph ''vulpinus'' have a head and underside that is mostly uniform dark, from dark brown to blackish-brown to almost pure black. Rufous morph juveniles are often distinctly paler in ground colour (ranging even to creamy-grey) than adults with distinct barring below actually increased in pale morph type juvenile. Pale and rufous morph juveniles can only be distinguished from each other in extreme cases. Dark morph juveniles are more similar to adult dark morph ''vulpinus'' but often show a little whitish streaking below, and like all other races have lighter coloured eyes and more evenly barred tails than adults. Steppe buzzards tend to appear smaller and more agile in flight than nominate whose wing beats can look slower and clumsier. In flight, rufous morph ''vulpinus'' have their whole body and underwing varying from uniform to patterned rufous (if patterning present, it is variable, but can be on chest and often thighs, sometimes flanks, pale band across median coverts), while the under-tail usually paler rufous than above. Whitish flight feathers are more prominent than in nominate and more marked contrast with the bold dark brown band along the trailing edges. Markings of pale ''vulpinus'' as seen in flight are similar to rufous morph (such as paler wing markings) but more greyish both on wings and body. In dark morph ''vulpinus'' the broad black trailing edges and colour of body make whitish areas of inner wing stand out further with an often bolder and blacker carpal patch than in other morphs. As in nominate, juvenile ''vulpinus'' (rufous/pale) tend to have much less distinct trailing edges, general streaking on body and along median underwing coverts. Dark morph ''vulpinus'' resemble adult in flight more so than other morphs.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Clark2/><ref name= Porter/><ref name= Voous>Voous, K. H., Hens, P. A., & Van Marle, J.

Inexperienced and over-enthusiastic observers have even mistaken darker birds for the far larger and differently proportioned [[golden eagle]] (''Aquila chrysaetos'') and also dark birds for [[western marsh harrier]] (''Circus aeruginosus'') which also flies in a dihedral but is obviously relatively much longer and slenderer winged and tailed and with far different flying methods. Also buzzards may possibly be confused with dark or light morph [[booted eagle]]s (''Hieraeetus pennatus''), which are similar in size, but the eagle flies on level, parallel-edged wings which usually appear broader, has a longer squarer tail, with no carpal patch in pale birds and all dark flight feathers but for whitish wedge on inner primaries in dark morph ones. Pale individuals are sometimes also mistaken with pale morph [[short-toed eagle]]s (''Circaetus gallicus'') which are much larger with a considerably bigger head, longer wings (which are usually held evenly in flight rather than in an dihedral) and paler underwing lacking any carpal patch or dark wing lining.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Forsman/><ref name= Clark2/> More serious identification concerns lie in other ''Buteo'' species and in flight with [[Pernis (bird)|honey buzzard]]s, which are quite different looking when seen perched at close range. The [[European honey buzzard]] (''Pernis apivorus'') is thought in engage in mimicry of more powerful raptors, in particular, juveniles may mimic the plumage of the more powerful common buzzard.<ref>Duff, D. (2006). ''Has the juvenile plumage of Honey-buzzard evolved to mimic that of Common Buzzard?'' British Birds, 99, 118\u2013128.</ref> While less individually variable in Europe, the honey buzzard is more extensive polymorphic on underparts than even the common buzzard. The most common morph of the adult European honey buzzard is heavily and rufous barred on the underside, quite different from the common buzzard, however the brownish juvenile much more resembles an intermediate common buzzard. Honey buzzards flap with distinctively slower and more even wing beats than common buzzard. The wings are also lifted higher on each upstroke, creating a more regular and mechanical effect, furthermore their wings are held slightly arched when soaring but not in a V. On the honey buzzard, the head appears smaller, the body thinner, the tail longer and the wings narrower and more parallel edged. The steppe buzzard race is particularly often mistaken for juvenile European honey buzzards, to the point where early observers of raptor migration in Israel considered distant individuals indistinguishable. However, when compared to a steppe buzzard, the honey buzzard has distinctly darker secondaries on the underwing with fewer and broader bars and more extensive black wing-tips (whole fingers) contrasting with a less extensively pale hand.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Forsman/><ref name= Porter/> Found in the same range as the steppe buzzard in some parts of southern [[Siberia]] as well as (with wintering steppes) in southwestern [[India]], the [[Oriental honey buzzard]] (''Pernis ptilorhynchus'') is larger than both the European honey buzzard and the common buzzard. The oriental species is with more similar in body plan to common buzzards, being relatively broader winged, shorter tailed and more amply-headed (though the head is still relatively small) relative to the European honey buzzard, but all plumages lack carpal patches.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/>\n\nIn much of Europe, the common buzzard is the only type of buzzard. However, the subarctic breeding [[rough-legged buzzard]] (''Buteo lagopus'') comes down to occupy much of the northern part of the continent during winter in the same haunts as the common buzzard. However, the rough-legged hawk is typically larger and distinctly longer-winged with feathered legs, as well as having a white based tail with a broad subterminal band. Rough-legged buzzards have slower wing beats and hover far more frequently than do common buzzards. The carpal patch marking on the under-wing are also bolder and blacker on all paler forms of rough-legged hawk. Many pale morph rough-legged buzzards have a bold, blackish band across the belly against contrasting paler feathers, a feature which rarely appears in individual common buzzard. Usually the face also appears somewhat whitish in most pale morphs of rough-legged buzzards, which is true of only extremely pale common buzzards. Dark morph rough-legged buzzards are usually distinctly darker (ranging to almost blackish) than even extreme dark individuals of common buzzards in Europe and still have the distinct white-based tail and broad subterminal band of other roughlegs.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Forsman/><ref name= Porter/> In [[eastern Europe]] and much of the Asian range of common buzzards, the [[long-legged buzzard]] (''Buteo rufinus'') may live alongside the common species. As in the steppe buzzard race, the long-legged buzzard has three main colour morphs that are more or less similar in hue. In both the steppe buzzard race and long-legged buzzard, the main colour is overall fairly rufous. More so than steppe buzzards, long-legged buzzards tend to have a distinctly paler head and neck compared to other feathers, and, more distinctly, a normally unbarred tail. Furthermore, the long-legged buzzard is usually a rather larger bird, often considered fairly [[eagle]]-like in appearance (although it does appear gracile and small-billed even compared to smaller true eagles), an effect enhanced by its longer tarsi, somewhat longer neck and relatively elongated wings. The flight style of the latter species is deeper, slower and more aquiline, with much more frequent hovering, showing a more protruding head and a slightly higher V held in a soar. The smaller [[North Africa]]n and [[Arabia]]n race of long-legged buzzard (''B. r. cirtensis'') is more similar in size and nearly all colour characteristics to steppe buzzard, extending to the heavily streaked juvenile plumage, in some cases such birds can be distinguished only by their proportions and flight patterns which remain unchanged.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Porter/> Hybridization with the latter race (''B. r. cirtensis'') and nominate common buzzards has been observed in the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], a few such birds have been reported potentially in the southern Mediterranean due to mutually encroaching ranges, which are blurring possibly due to climate change.<ref>Elorriaga, J., & Mu\u00f1oz, A.

The juveniles of steppe and forest buzzards are more or less indistinguishable and only told apart by proportions and flight style, the latter species being smaller, more compact, having a smaller bill, shorter legs and shorter and thinner wings than a steppe buzzard. However, size is not diagnostic unless side by side as the two buzzards overlap in this regard. Most reliable are the species wing proportions and their flight actions. Forest buzzard have more flexible wing beats interspersed with glides, additionally soaring on flatter wings and apparently never engage in hovering. Adult forest buzzards compared to the typical adult steppe buzzard (rufous morph) are also similar, but the forest typically has a whiter underside, sometimes mostly plain white, usually with heavy blotches or drop-shaped marks on abdomen, with barring on thighs, more narrow tear-shaped on chest and more spotted on leading edges of underwing, usually lacking marking on the white U across chest (which is otherwise similar but usually broader than that of ''vulpinus''). In comparison, the mountain buzzard, which is more similar in size to the steppe buzzard and slightly larger than the forest buzzard, is usually duller brown above than a steppe buzzard and is more whitish below with distinctive heavy brown blotches from breasts to the belly, flanks and wing linings while juvenile mountain buzzard is buffy below with smaller and streakier markings. The steppe buzzard when compared to another African species, the [[red-necked buzzard]] (''Buteo auguralis''), which has red tail similar to ''vulpinus'', is distinct in all other plumage aspects despite their similar size. The latter buzzard has a streaky rufous head and is white below with a contrasting bold dark chest in adult plumage and, in juvenile plumage, has heavy, dark blotches on the chest and flanks with pale wing-linings. [[Jackal buzzard|Jackal]] and [[augur buzzard]]s (''Buteo rufofuscus'' & ''augur''), also both rufous on the tail, are larger and bulkier than steppe buzzards and have several distinctive plumage characteristics, most notably both having their own striking, contrasting patterns of black-brown, rufous and cream.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Forsman/><ref name= Steyn>Steyn, P.

''The identity, origin and impact of a 'new' buzzard species breeding in South Africa'' (Doctoral dissertation, University of Cape Town).</ref>\n\nOther than rodents, two other groups of mammals can be counted as significant to the diet of common buzzards. One of these main prey type of import in the diets of common buzzards are [[Leporidae|leporids]] or [[Lagomorpha|lagomorphs]], especially the [[European rabbit]] (''Oryctolagus cuniculus'') where it is found in numbers in a wild or feral state. In all dietary studies from Scotland, rabbits were highly important to the buzzard's diet. In southern Scotland, rabbits constituted 40.8% of remains at nests and 21.6% of pellet contents, while lagomorphs (mainly rabbits but also some young [[hare]]s) were present in 99% of remains in [[Moray]], [[Scotland]]. The nutritional richness relative to the commonest prey elsewhere, such as voles, might account for the high productivity of buzzards here. For example, clutch sizes were twice as large on average where rabbits were common (Moray) than were where they were rare ([[Glen Urquhart]]).<ref name= Graham/><ref name= Swann/><ref name= Swan>Swan, G.

In [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]], [[Spain]], rabbits were the most common mammal in the diet, making up 16.8% of 167 prey items.<ref name= Zuberogoitia/> In a large study from northeastern Spain, rabbits were dominant in the buzzard's foods, making up 66.5% of 598 prey items.<ref name= Manosa/> In the [[Netherlands]], European rabbits were second in number (19.1% of 6624 prey items) only to common voles and the largest contributor of biomass to nests (36.7%).<ref name= Bijlsma/> Outside of these (at least historically) rabbit-rich areas, [[Hare|leverets]] of the common hare species found in Europe can be important supplemental prey. [[European hare]] (''Lepus europaeus'') were the fourth most important prey species in central [[Poland]] and the third most significant prey species in [[Stavropol Krai]], [[Russia]].<ref name= Chernichko/><ref name= Pinowski/> Buzzards normally attack the young of European rabbits, which as adults can average nearly {{convert|2000|g|lb|abbr=on}}, and invariably (so far as is known) only the young of hares, which can average up to twice as massive as rabbits. The mean weights of rabbits taken have various been estimated from {{convert|159|to|550|g|oz|abbr=on}} in different areas while [[mountain hare]]s (''Lepus timidus'') taken in Norway were estimated to average about {{convert|1000|g|lb|abbr=on}}, in both cases about a third of the weight of full-grown, prime adults of the respective species.

Nearly 150 species of bird have been identified in the common buzzard's diet. In general, despite many that are taken, birds usually take a secondary position in the diet after mammals.<ref name= Selas2/><ref name= Bijlsma/><ref name= Chernichko/> In northern [[Scotland]], birds were fairly numerous in the foods of buzzards. The most often recorded avian prey and 2nd and 3rd most frequent prey species (after only field voles) in [[Glen Urquhart]], were {{convert|23.9|g|oz|abbr=on}} [[chaffinch]] (''Fringilla coelebs'') and {{convert|18.4|g|oz|abbr=on}} [[meadow pipit]]s (''Anthus pratensis''), with the buzzards taking 195 fledglings of these species against only 90 adults.

There may be many other birds that broadly overlap in prey selection to some extent. Furthermore, their preference for interferences of forest and field is used heavily by many birds of prey. Some of the most similar species by diet are the [[common kestrel]] (''Falco tinniculus''), [[hen harrier]] (''Circus cyaenus'') and [[lesser spotted eagle]] (''Clanga clanga''), not to mention nearly every European species of owl, as all but two may locally prefer [[rodent]]s such as [[vole]]s in their diets.<ref>Davis, T.

It was found in southern Sweden, habitat, hunting and prey selection often overlapped considerably. Rough-legged buzzards appear to prefer slightly more open habitat and took slightly fewer [[Apodemus|wood mice]] than common buzzard. Roughlegs also hover much more frequently and are more given to hunting in high winds. The two buzzards are aggressive towards one another and excluded each other from winter feeding territories in similar ways to the way they exclude conspecifics. In northern [[Germany]], the buffer of their habitat preferences apparently accounted for the lack of effect on each other's occupancy between the two buzzard species.<ref>Sylven, M. (1978).

However, it can be inferred from the long-legged species preference for predation on differing prey, such as [[Spalax|blind mole-rat]]s, [[ground squirrel]]s, [[hamster]]s and [[Meriones (genus)|gerbils]], from the voles usually preferred by the common species, that serious competition for food is unlikely.<ref>Kassinis, N.

Despite the considerable discrepancy of the two species dietary habits, habitat selection in Europe is largely similar between buzzards and goshawks. Goshawks are slightly larger than buzzards and are more powerful, agile and generally more aggressive birds, and so they are considered dominant. In studies from Germany and Sweden, buzzards were found to be less disturbance sensitive than goshawks but were probably displaced into inferior nesting spots by the dominant goshawks. The exposure of buzzards to a dummy goshawk was found to decrease breeding success whereas there was no effect on breeding goshawks when they were exposed to a dummy buzzard.<ref>Kr\u00fcger, O.

Redtails are not invariably dominated by goshawks and are frequently able to outcompete them by virtue of greater dietary and habitat flexibility.

In Europe, territorial behaviour generally starts in February. However, displays are not uncommon throughout year in resident pairs, especially by males, and can elicit similar displays by neighbors.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Brown/> In them, common buzzards generally engage in high circling, spiraling upward on slightly raised wings. Mutual high circling by pairs sometimes go on at length, especially during the period prior to or during breeding season. In mutual displays, a pair may follow each other at {{convert|10|-|50|m|ft|abbr=on}} in level flight. During the mutual displays, the male may engage in exaggerated deep flapping or zig-zag tumbling, apparently in response to the female being too distant.

Common buzzard breeding seasons may fall as early as January to April but typically the breeding season is March to July in much of [[Palearctic]]. In the northern stretches of the range the breeding season may last into May\u2013August. Mating usually occurs on or near the nest and lasts about 15 seconds, typically occurring several times a day.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Brown/> Eggs are usually laid in 2 to 3-day intervals. The clutch size can range from to 2 to 6, a relatively large clutch for an accipitrid. More northerly and westerly buzzard usually bear larger clutches, which average nearer 3, than those further east and south.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Brown/><ref name= Rodriguez/> In Spain, the average clutch size is about 2 to 2.3.<ref name= Zuberogoitia/> From 4 locations in different parts of Europe, 43% had clutch size of 2, 41% had size of 3, clutches of 1 and 4 each constituted about 8%.<ref>Holdsworth, M.

There are, however, highly significant differences in clutch size between British study areas. These do not follow any latitudinal gradient and it is likely that local factors such as habitat and prey availability are more important determinants of clutch size.<ref name= Austin/> The eggs are white in ground colour, rather round in shape with sporadic red to brown markings sometimes lightly showing. In the nominate race, egg size is {{convert|49.8|-|63.8|mm|in|abbr=on}} in height by {{convert|39.1|-|48.2|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter with an average of {{convert|55|x|44|mm|in|abbr=on}} in 600 eggs. In the race of ''vulpinus'', egg height is {{convert|48|-|63|mm|in|abbr=on}} by {{convert|39.2|-|47.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} with an average of {{convert|54.2|x|42.8|mm|in|abbr=on}} in 303 eggs.<ref name= Brown/> Eggs are generally laid in late March to early April in extreme south, sometime in April in most of Europe, into May and possibly even early June in the extreme north. If eggs are lost to a predator (including humans) or fail in some other way, common buzzards do not usually lay replacement clutches but they have been recorded, even with 3 attempts of clutches by a single female.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Brown/><ref name= Swann/> The females does most but not all of the incubating, doing so for a total of 33\u201335 days.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Brown/> The female remains at the nest brooding the young in the early stages with the male bringing all prey. At about 8\u201312 days, both the male and female will bring prey but female continues to do all feeding until the young can tear up their own prey.<ref name= Brown/>\n\n===Development of young===\n[[File:Buteo nestling juedischer Friedhof.JPG|thumb|right|Two young buzzard nestlings.]]\nOnce hatching commences, it may take 48 hours for the chick to chip out.

The young are nearly fully feathered rather than downy at about a month of age and can start to feed themselves as well. The first attempts to leave the nest are often at about 40\u201350 days, averaging usually 40\u201345 in nominate buzzards in Europe, but more quickly on average at 40\u201342 in ''vulpinus''. Fledging occurs typically at 43\u201354 days but in extreme cases at as late 62 days.

Ibis, 140(1), 58\u201363.</ref> After leaving the nest, buzzards generally stay close by, but with migratory ones there is more definitive movement generally southbound. Full independence is generally sought 6 to 8 weeks after fledging. 1st year birds generally remain in wintering area for following summer but then return to near area of origin but then migrate south again without breeding.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Brown/><ref name= Cramp/> Radio-tracking suggests that most dispersal, even relatively early dispersals, by juvenile buzzards is undertaken independently rather than via exile by parents, as has been recorded in some other birds of prey.<ref>Walls, S.

Journal of Avian Biology, 407\u2013415.</ref> In common buzzards, generally speaking, siblings stay quite close to each other after dispersal from their parents and form something of a social group, although parents usually tolerate their presence on their territory until they are laying another clutch. However, the social group of siblings disbands at about a year of age.<ref name= Tyack/><ref name=\"Walls\"/> Juvenile buzzards are subordinate to adults during most encounters and tend to avoid direct confrontations and actively defended territories until they are of appropriate age (usually at least 2 years of age).<ref name= Cramp/> This was the case as well for steppe buzzard juveniles wintering in southern Africa, although in some cases juveniles were able to successfully [[Kleptoparasitism|steal prey]] from adults there.<ref>Herremans, M.

Chiefly among these are prey populations, habitat, disturbance and persecution levels and innerspecies competition.<ref name= Brown/> In Germany, intra- and interspecific competition, plumage morph, laying date, precipitation levels and anthropogenic disturbances in the breeding territory, in declining order, were deemed to be the most significant bearers of breeding success.<ref name=\"Kruger\"/> In an accompanying study, it was found that a mere 17% of adult birds of both sexes present in a German study area produced 50% of offspring, so breeding success may be lower than perceived and many adult buzzards for unknown causes may not attempt to breed at all.<ref name= Kruger2>Kr\u00fcger, O., & Lindstr\u00f6m, J.

Oikos, 93(2), 260\u2013273.</ref> High breeding success was detected in [[Argyll]], [[Scotland]], due likely to hearty prey populations (rabbits) but also probably a lower local rate of persecution than elsewhere in the British isles. Here, the mean number of fledglings were 1.75 against 0.82\u20131.41 in other parts of Britain.<ref name= Austin/> It was found in the English [[The Midlands|Midlands]] that breeding success both by measure of clutch size and mean number of fledglings, was relatively high thanks again to high prey populations. Breeding success was lower farther from significant stands of trees in the Midlands and most nesting failures that could be determined occurred in the incubation stage, possibly in correlation with predation of eggs by [[corvid]]s.<ref name= Sim/> More significant than even prey, late winter-early spring was found to be likely the primary driver of breeding success in buzzards from southern [[Norway]]. Here, even in peak [[vole]] years, nesting success could be considerably hampered by heavy snow at this crucial stage.  In Norway, large clutches of 3+ were expected only in years with minimal snow cover, high vole populations and lighter rains in May\u2013June.<ref name= Selas3/> In the Italian [[Alps]], the mean number of fledglings per pair was 1.07.<ref name= Sergio/> 33.4% of nesting attempts were failures per a study in southwestern [[Germany]], with an average of 1.06 of all nesting attempts and 1.61 for all successful attempt. In Germany, weather conditions and rodent populations seemed to be the primary drivers of nesting success.<ref name= Rockenbauch/> In [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]] part of [[Spain]] contrasted with [[Biscay]] to the north, higher levels of interspecific competition from [[booted eagle]]s and [[northern goshawk]]s did not appear to negatively affect breeding success due to more ample prey populations (rabbits again) in Murcia than in Biscay.<ref name= Zuberogoitia/>\n\nIn the [[Westphalia]] area of Germany, it was found that intermediate colour morphs were more productive than those that were darker or lighter.<ref name= Kruger2/> For reasons that are not entirely clear, apparently fewer parasites were found to afflict broods of intermediate plumaged buzzard less so than dark and light [[phenotype]]s, in particular higher [[melanin]] levels somehow were found to be more inviting to parasitic organism that effect the health of the buzzard's offspring.<ref>Chakarov, N., Boerner, M., & Kr\u00fcger, O.

Almost certainly, it is the most numerous diurnal bird of prey throughout Europe. Conservative estimates put the total population at no fewer than 700,000 pairs in Europe, which are more than twice the total estimates for the next four birds of prey estimated as most common: the [[Eurasian sparrowhawk]] (more than 340,000 pairs), the [[common kestrel]] (more than 330,000 pairs) and the [[northern goshawk]] (more than 160,000 pairs).<ref name= BirdlifeEurope/> Ferguson-Lees et al. roughly estimated that the total population of the common buzzard ranges to nearly 5 million pairs but at time was including the now spilit-off species of [[Eastern buzzard|eastern]] and [[Himalayan buzzard]]s in those numbers.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/> These numbers may be excessive but the total population of common buzzards is certain to total well over seven figures.<ref name=IUCN/><ref name= Ferguson-Lees/> More recently, the [[IUCN]] estimated the common buzzard species (sans the Himalayan and eastern species) to number somewhere between 2.1 and 3.7 million birds, which would put this buzzard one of the most numerous of all acciptrid family members (estimates for Eurasian sparrowhawks, red-tailed hawks and northern goshawks also may range over 2 million).<ref name=IUCN/> In 1991, other than their absence in [[Iceland]], after having been extent as breeder by 1910, buzzards recolonized [[Ireland]] sometime in 1950s and has increased by the 1990s to 26 pairs.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Rooney/> Supplemental feeding has reportedly helped the Irish buzzard population to rebound, especially where rabbits have decreased.<ref name= Rooney2/> Most other countries have at least four figures of breeding pairs.

The Westphalian buzzards are possibly benefiting from increasingly warmer mean climate, which in turn is increasing vulnerability of voles. However, the rate of increase was significantly greater in males than in females, in part because of reintroduced [[Eurasian eagle-owl]]s to the region preying on nests (including the brooding mother), which may in turn put undue pressure on the local buzzard population.<ref>Jonker, R.

Most buzzards are distinctly round headed with a somewhat slender bill, relatively long wings that either reach or fall slightly short of the tail tip when perched, a fairly short tail, and somewhat short and mainly bare tarsi. They can appear fairly compact in overall appearance but may also appear large relative to other commoner raptorial birds such as [[Eurasian kestrel|kestrels]] and [[Eurasian sparrowhawk|sparrowhawk]]s.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Forsman>Forsman, D.

The flight feathers on perched European buzzards are always brown in the nominate subspecies (''B. b. buteo''). Usually the tail will usually be narrowly barred grey-brown and dark brown with a pale tip and a broad dark subterminal band but the tail in palest birds can show a varying amount a white and reduced subterminal band or even appear almost all white. In European buzzards, the underside coloring can be variable but most typically show a brown-streaked white throat with a somewhat darker chest. A pale U across breast is often present; followed by a pale line running down the belly which separates the dark areas on breast-side and flanks. These pale areas tend to have highly variable markings that tend to form irregular bars. Juvenile buzzards are quite similar to adult in the nominate race, being best told apart by having a paler eye, a narrower subterminal band on the tail and underside markings that appear as streaks rather than bars. Furthermore, juveniles may show variable creamy to rufous fringes to upperwing coverts but these also may not be present. Seen from below in flight, buzzards in Europe typically have a dark trailing edge to the wings. If seen from above, one of the best marks is their broad dark subterminal tail band. Flight feathers of typical European buzzards are largely greyish, the aforementioned dark wing linings at front with contrasting paler band along the median coverts. In flight, paler individuals tend to show dark carpal patches that can appears as blackish arches or commas but these may be indistinct in darker individuals or can appear light brownish or faded in paler individuals. Juvenile nominate buzzards are best told apart from adults in flight by the lack of a distinct subterminal band (instead showing fairly even barring throughout) and below by having less sharp and brownish rather than blackish trailing wing edge. Juvenile buzzards show streaking paler parts of under wing and body showing rather than barring as do adults.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Forsman/><ref name= Clark2>Clark, W. S. (1999).

''Flight identification of European raptors''. A&C Black.</ref> Beyond the typical mid-range brownish buzzard, birds in Europe can range from almost uniform black-brown above to mainly white. Extreme dark individuals may range from chocolate brown to blackish with almost no pale showing but a variable, faded U on the breast and with or without faint lighter brown throat streaks. Extreme pale birds are largely whitish with variable widely spaced streaks or arrowheads of light brown about the mid-chest and flanks and may or may not show dark feather-centres on the head, wing-coverts and sometimes all but part of mantle. Individuals can show nearly endless variation of colours and hues in between these extremes and the common buzzard is counted among the most variably plumage diurnal raptors for this reason.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref>Dittrich, W.

The steppe buzzard race shows three main colour morphs, each of which can be predominant in a region of breeding range. It is more distinctly [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] rather than just individually very variable like the nominate race. This may be because, unlike the nominate buzzard, the steppe buzzard is highly migratory. Polymorphism has been linked with migratory behaviour.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref>Rohwer, S., & Paulson, D. R. (1987). ''The avoidance-image hypothesis and color polymorphism in Buteo hawks''. Ornis Scandinavica, 285\u2013290.</ref> The most common type of steppe buzzard is the rufous morph which gives this subspecies its scientific name (''vulpes'' is Latin for \"fox\"). This morph comprises a majority of birds seen in passage east of the [[Mediterranean]].  Rufous morph buzzards are a paler grey-brown above than most nominate ''B. b. buteo''. Compared to the nominate race, rufous ''vulpinus'' show a patterning not dissimilar but generally far more rufous-toned on head, the fringes to mantle wing coverts and, especially, on the tail and the underside. The head is grey-brown with rufous tinges usually while the tail is rufous and can vary from almost unmarked to thinly dark-barred with a subterminal band. The underside can be uniformly pale to dark rufous, barred heavily or lightly with rufous or with dusky barring, usually with darker individuals showing the U as in nominate but with a rufous hue. The pale morph of the steppe buzzard is commonest in the west of its subspecies range, predominantly seen in winter and migration at the various land bridge of the Mediterranean. As in the rufous morph, the pale morph ''vulpinus'' is grey-brown above but the tail is generally marked with thin dark bars and a subterminal band, only showing rufous near the tip. The underside in the pale morph is greyish-white with dark grey-brown or somewhat streaked head to chest and barred belly and chest, occasionally showing darker flanks that can be somewhat rufous. Dark morph ''vulpinus'' tend to be found in the east and southeast of the subspecies range and are easily outnumbered by rufous morph while largely using similar migration points. Dark morph individuals vary from grey-brown to much darker blackish-brown, and have a tail that is dark grey or somewhat mixed grey and rufous, is distinctly marked with dark barring and has a broad, black subterminal band. Dark morph ''vulpinus'' have a head and underside that is mostly uniform dark, from dark brown to blackish-brown to almost pure black. Rufous morph juveniles are often distinctly paler in ground colour (ranging even to creamy-grey) than adults with distinct barring below actually increased in pale morph type juvenile. Pale and rufous morph juveniles can only be distinguished from each other in extreme cases. Dark morph juveniles are more similar to adult dark morph ''vulpinus'' but often show a little whitish streaking below, and like all other races have lighter coloured eyes and more evenly barred tails than adults. Steppe buzzards tend to appear smaller and more agile in flight than nominate whose wing beats can look slower and clumsier. In flight, rufous morph ''vulpinus'' have their whole body and underwing varying from uniform to patterned rufous (if patterning present, it is variable, but can be on chest and often thighs, sometimes flanks, pale band across median coverts), while the under-tail usually paler rufous than above. Whitish flight feathers are more prominent than in nominate and more marked contrast with the bold dark brown band along the trailing edges. Markings of pale ''vulpinus'' as seen in flight are similar to rufous morph (such as paler wing markings) but more greyish both on wings and body. In dark morph ''vulpinus'' the broad black trailing edges and colour of body make whitish areas of inner wing stand out further with an often bolder and blacker carpal patch than in other morphs. As in nominate, juvenile ''vulpinus'' (rufous/pale) tend to have much less distinct trailing edges, general streaking on body and along median underwing coverts. Dark morph ''vulpinus'' resemble adult in flight more so than other morphs.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Clark2/><ref name= Porter/><ref name= Voous>Voous, K. H., Hens, P. A., & Van Marle, J.

Inexperienced and over-enthusiastic observers have even mistaken darker birds for the far larger and differently proportioned [[golden eagle]] (''Aquila chrysaetos'') and also dark birds for [[western marsh harrier]] (''Circus aeruginosus'') which also flies in a dihedral but is obviously relatively much longer and slenderer winged and tailed and with far different flying methods. Also buzzards may possibly be confused with dark or light morph [[booted eagle]]s (''Hieraeetus pennatus''), which are similar in size, but the eagle flies on level, parallel-edged wings which usually appear broader, has a longer squarer tail, with no carpal patch in pale birds and all dark flight feathers but for whitish wedge on inner primaries in dark morph ones. Pale individuals are sometimes also mistaken with pale morph [[short-toed eagle]]s (''Circaetus gallicus'') which are much larger with a considerably bigger head, longer wings (which are usually held evenly in flight rather than in an dihedral) and paler underwing lacking any carpal patch or dark wing lining.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Forsman/><ref name= Clark2/> More serious identification concerns lie in other ''Buteo'' species and in flight with [[Pernis (bird)|honey buzzard]]s, which are quite different looking when seen perched at close range. The [[European honey buzzard]] (''Pernis apivorus'') is thought in engage in mimicry of more powerful raptors, in particular, juveniles may mimic the plumage of the more powerful common buzzard.<ref>Duff, D. (2006). ''Has the juvenile plumage of Honey-buzzard evolved to mimic that of Common Buzzard?'' British Birds, 99, 118\u2013128.</ref> While less individually variable in Europe, the honey buzzard is more extensive polymorphic on underparts than even the common buzzard. The most common morph of the adult European honey buzzard is heavily and rufous barred on the underside, quite different from the common buzzard, however the brownish juvenile much more resembles an intermediate common buzzard. Honey buzzards flap with distinctively slower and more even wing beats than common buzzard. The wings are also lifted higher on each upstroke, creating a more regular and mechanical effect, furthermore their wings are held slightly arched when soaring but not in a V. On the honey buzzard, the head appears smaller, the body thinner, the tail longer and the wings narrower and more parallel edged. The steppe buzzard race is particularly often mistaken for juvenile European honey buzzards, to the point where early observers of raptor migration in Israel considered distant individuals indistinguishable. However, when compared to a steppe buzzard, the honey buzzard has distinctly darker secondaries on the underwing with fewer and broader bars and more extensive black wing-tips (whole fingers) contrasting with a less extensively pale hand.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Forsman/><ref name= Porter/> Found in the same range as the steppe buzzard in some parts of southern [[Siberia]] as well as (with wintering steppes) in southwestern [[India]], the [[Oriental honey buzzard]] (''Pernis ptilorhynchus'') is larger than both the European honey buzzard and the common buzzard. The oriental species is with more similar in body plan to common buzzards, being relatively broader winged, shorter tailed and more amply-headed (though the head is still relatively small) relative to the European honey buzzard, but all plumages lack carpal patches.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/>\n\nIn much of Europe, the common buzzard is the only type of buzzard. However, the subarctic breeding [[rough-legged buzzard]] (''Buteo lagopus'') comes down to occupy much of the northern part of the continent during winter in the same haunts as the common buzzard. However, the rough-legged hawk is typically larger and distinctly longer-winged with feathered legs, as well as having a white based tail with a broad subterminal band. Rough-legged buzzards have slower wing beats and hover far more frequently than do common buzzards. The carpal patch marking on the under-wing are also bolder and blacker on all paler forms of rough-legged hawk. Many pale morph rough-legged buzzards have a bold, blackish band across the belly against contrasting paler feathers, a feature which rarely appears in individual common buzzard. Usually the face also appears somewhat whitish in most pale morphs of rough-legged buzzards, which is true of only extremely pale common buzzards. Dark morph rough-legged buzzards are usually distinctly darker (ranging to almost blackish) than even extreme dark individuals of common buzzards in Europe and still have the distinct white-based tail and broad subterminal band of other roughlegs.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Forsman/><ref name= Porter/> In [[eastern Europe]] and much of the Asian range of common buzzards, the [[long-legged buzzard]] (''Buteo rufinus'') may live alongside the common species. As in the steppe buzzard race, the long-legged buzzard has three main colour morphs that are more or less similar in hue. In both the steppe buzzard race and long-legged buzzard, the main colour is overall fairly rufous. More so than steppe buzzards, long-legged buzzards tend to have a distinctly paler head and neck compared to other feathers, and, more distinctly, a normally unbarred tail. Furthermore, the long-legged buzzard is usually a rather larger bird, often considered fairly [[eagle]]-like in appearance (although it does appear gracile and small-billed even compared to smaller true eagles), an effect enhanced by its longer tarsi, somewhat longer neck and relatively elongated wings. The flight style of the latter species is deeper, slower and more aquiline, with much more frequent hovering, showing a more protruding head and a slightly higher V held in a soar. The smaller [[North Africa]]n and [[Arabia]]n race of long-legged buzzard (''B. r. cirtensis'') is more similar in size and nearly all colour characteristics to steppe buzzard, extending to the heavily streaked juvenile plumage, in some cases such birds can be distinguished only by their proportions and flight patterns which remain unchanged.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Porter/> Hybridization with the latter race (''B. r. cirtensis'') and nominate common buzzards has been observed in the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], a few such birds have been reported potentially in the southern Mediterranean due to mutually encroaching ranges, which are blurring possibly due to climate change.<ref>Elorriaga, J., & Mu\u00f1oz, A. R. (2013).

Ostrich, 84(1), 41\u201345.</ref>\n\nWintering steppe buzzards may live alongside [[mountain buzzard]]s and especially with [[forest buzzard]] while wintering in Africa. The juveniles of steppe and forest buzzards are more or less indistinguishable and only told apart by proportions and flight style, the latter species being smaller, more compact, having a smaller bill, shorter legs and shorter and thinner wings than a steppe buzzard. However, size is not diagnostic unless side by side as the two buzzards overlap in this regard. Most reliable are the species wing proportions and their flight actions. Forest buzzard have more flexible wing beats interspersed with glides, additionally soaring on flatter wings and apparently never engage in hovering. Adult forest buzzards compared to the typical adult steppe buzzard (rufous morph) are also similar, but the forest typically has a whiter underside, sometimes mostly plain white, usually with heavy blotches or drop-shaped marks on abdomen, with barring on thighs, more narrow tear-shaped on chest and more spotted on leading edges of underwing, usually lacking marking on the white U across chest (which is otherwise similar but usually broader than that of ''vulpinus''). In comparison, the mountain buzzard, which is more similar in size to the steppe buzzard and slightly larger than the forest buzzard, is usually duller brown above than a steppe buzzard and is more whitish below with distinctive heavy brown blotches from breasts to the belly, flanks and wing linings while juvenile mountain buzzard is buffy below with smaller and streakier markings. The steppe buzzard when compared to another African species, the [[red-necked buzzard]] (''Buteo auguralis''), which has red tail similar to ''vulpinus'', is distinct in all other plumage aspects despite their similar size. The latter buzzard has a streaky rufous head and is white below with a contrasting bold dark chest in adult plumage and, in juvenile plumage, has heavy, dark blotches on the chest and flanks with pale wing-linings. [[Jackal buzzard|Jackal]] and [[augur buzzard]]s (''Buteo rufofuscus'' & ''augur''), also both rufous on the tail, are larger and bulkier than steppe buzzards and have several distinctive plumage characteristics, most notably both having their own striking, contrasting patterns of black-brown, rufous and cream.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Forsman/><ref name= Steyn>Steyn, P.

Steppe buzzards are particularly prone to being slightly gregarious in migration, and will traveling in variously sized flocks. This race migrates in September to October often from [[Asia Minor]] to [[Cape of Africa]] in about a month but does not do well at crossing water, following around the [[Winam Gulf]] of [[Lake Victoria]] rather than crossing the several kilometer wide gulf. Similarly, they will funnel along both sides of the [[Black Sea]]. Migratory behavior of steppe buzzards mirrors those of [[Broad-winged hawk|broad-winged]] & [[Swainson's hawk]]s (''Buteo platypterus'' & ''swainsoni'') in every significant way as similar long-distance migrating ''Buteos'', including trans-equatorial movements, avoidance of large bodies of waters and flocking behaviour.<ref name= Bildstein/><ref name= Brown/> Migrating steppe buzzards will rise up with the morning thermals and can cover an average of hundreds of miles a day using the available currents along mountain ridges and other topographic features. The spring migration for steppe buzzards peaks around March\u2013April, but the latest ''vulpinus'' arrive in their breeding grounds by late April or early May.

The two migratory movements barely differ overall until they reach the [[Middle East]] and east Africa, where the largest volume of migrants in autumn occurs at the southern part of the [[Red Sea]], around [[Djibouti]] and [[Yemen]], while the main volume in spring is in the northernmost strait, around [[Egypt]] and [[Israel]]. In autumn, numbers of steppe buzzards recorded in migration have ranged up to 32,000 (recorded 1971) in northwestern Turkey ([[Bosporus]]) and in northeastern Turkey (Black Sea) up to 205,000 (recorded 1976).

Both nominate buzzards and steppe buzzards (and their numerous related subspecies within their types) tend to have similar voices. The main call of the species is a plaintive, far-carrying ''pee-yow'' or ''peee-oo'', used as both contact call and more excitedly in aerial displays. Their call is sharper, more ringing when used in aggression, tends to be more drawn-out and wavering when chasing intruders, sharper, more yelping when as warning when approaching the nest or shorter and more explosive when called in alarm. Other variations of their vocal performances include a [[cat]]-like ''mew'', uttered repeatedly on the wing or when perched, especially in display; a repeated ''mah'' has been recorded as uttered by pairs answering each other, further chuckles and croaks have also been recorded at nests.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Brown/><ref name= Fryer>Fryer, G.

This species tends not to hunt in a spectacular stoop but generally drops gently then gradually accelerate at bottom with wings held above the back. Sometimes, the buzzard also forages by random glides or soars over open country, wood edges or clearings. Perch hunting may be done preferentially but buzzards fairly regularly also hunt from a ground position when the habitat demands it. Outside the breeding season, as many 15\u201330 buzzards have been recorded foraging on ground in a single large field, especially juveniles. Normally the rarest foraging type is hovering.

One of these main prey type of import in the diets of common buzzards are [[Leporidae|leporids]] or [[Lagomorpha|lagomorphs]], especially the [[European rabbit]] (''Oryctolagus cuniculus'') where it is found in numbers in a wild or feral state.

The nutritional richness relative to the commonest prey elsewhere, such as voles, might account for the high productivity of buzzards here.

Nearly 150 species of bird have been identified in the common buzzard's diet. In general, despite many that are taken, birds usually take a secondary position in the diet after mammals.<ref name= Selas2/><ref name= Bijlsma/><ref name= Chernichko/> In northern [[Scotland]], birds were fairly numerous in the foods of buzzards.

Rough-legged buzzards appear to prefer slightly more open habitat and took slightly fewer [[Apodemus|wood mice]] than common buzzard. Roughlegs also hover much more frequently and are more given to hunting in high winds. The two buzzards are aggressive towards one another and excluded each other from winter feeding territories in similar ways to the way they exclude conspecifics.

Despite the considerable discrepancy of the two species dietary habits, habitat selection in Europe is largely similar between buzzards and goshawks. Goshawks are slightly larger than buzzards and are more powerful, agile and generally more aggressive birds, and so they are considered dominant. In studies from Germany and Sweden, buzzards were found to be less disturbance sensitive than goshawks but were probably displaced into inferior nesting spots by the dominant goshawks.

Species such as the [[black kite]] (''Milvus migrans''), [[booted eagle]] (''Hieraeetus pennatus'') and the [[lesser spotted eagle]] have been known to displace actively nesting buzzards, although in some cases the buzzards may attempt to defend themselves. The broad range of accipitrids that take over buzzard nests is somewhat unusual. More typically, common buzzards are victims of nest parasitism to [[owl]]s and [[falcon]]s, as neither of these other kinds of raptorial birds builds their own nests, but these may regularly take up occupancy on already abandoned or alternate nests rather than ones the buzzards are actively using.<ref name= Sergio/><ref name= Costa/><ref>Sergio, F., & Boto, A.

At about 8\u201312 days, both the male and female will bring prey but female continues to do all feeding until the young can tear up their own prey.<ref name= Brown/>\n\n===Development of young===\n[[File:Buteo nestling juedischer Friedhof.JPG|thumb|right|Two young buzzard nestlings.]]\nOnce hatching commences, it may take 48 hours for the chick to chip out. Hatching may take place over 3\u20137 days, with new hatchlings averaging about {{convert|45|g|oz|abbr=on}} in body mass.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Brown/><ref name= Cramp/> Often the youngest nestling dies from starvation, especially in broods of three or more.<ref name= Brown/> In nestlings, the first down replaces by longer, coarser down at about 7 days of age with the first proper feathers appearing at 12 to 15 days. The young are nearly fully feathered rather than downy at about a month of age and can start to feed themselves as well. The first attempts to leave the nest are often at about 40\u201350 days, averaging usually 40\u201345 in nominate buzzards in Europe, but more quickly on average at 40\u201342 in ''vulpinus''. Fledging occurs typically at 43\u201354 days but in extreme cases at as late 62 days. Sexual dimorphism is apparent in European fledglings, as females often scale about {{convert|1000|g|lb|abbr=on}} against {{convert|780|g|lb|abbr=on}} in males.<ref name= Brown/><ref name= Cramp/><ref name= Tyack>Tyack, A.

Ibis, 140(1), 58\u201363.</ref> After leaving the nest, buzzards generally stay close by, but with migratory ones there is more definitive movement generally southbound. Full independence is generally sought 6 to 8 weeks after fledging. 1st year birds generally remain in wintering area for following summer but then return to near area of origin but then migrate south again without breeding.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Brown/><ref name= Cramp/> Radio-tracking suggests that most dispersal, even relatively early dispersals, by juvenile buzzards is undertaken independently rather than via exile by parents, as has been recorded in some other birds of prey.<ref>Walls, S. S., Ma\u00f1osa, S., Fuller, R. M., Hodder, K. H., & Kenward, R. E. (1999). ''Is early dispersal enterprise or exile? Evidence from radio-tagged buzzards''. Journal of Avian Biology, 407\u2013415.</ref> In common buzzards, generally speaking, siblings stay quite close to each other after dispersal from their parents and form something of a social group, although parents usually tolerate their presence on their territory until they are laying another clutch. However, the social group of siblings disbands at about a year of age.<ref name= Tyack/><ref name=\"Walls\"/> Juvenile buzzards are subordinate to adults during most encounters and tend to avoid direct confrontations and actively defended territories until they are of appropriate age (usually at least 2 years of age).<ref name= Cramp/> This was the case as well for steppe buzzard juveniles wintering in southern Africa, although in some cases juveniles were able to successfully [[Kleptoparasitism|steal prey]] from adults there.<ref>Herremans, M.

Chiefly among these are prey populations, habitat, disturbance and persecution levels and innerspecies competition.<ref name= Brown/> In Germany, intra- and interspecific competition, plumage morph, laying date, precipitation levels and anthropogenic disturbances in the breeding territory, in declining order, were deemed to be the most significant bearers of breeding success.<ref name=\"Kruger\"/> In an accompanying study, it was found that a mere 17% of adult birds of both sexes present in a German study area produced 50% of offspring, so breeding success may be lower than perceived and many adult buzzards for unknown causes may not attempt to breed at all.<ref name= Kruger2>Kr\u00fcger, O., & Lindstr\u00f6m, J. (2001). ''Lifetime reproductive success in common buzzard, Buteo buteo: from individual variation to population demography''. Oikos, 93(2), 260\u2013273.</ref> High breeding success was detected in [[Argyll]], [[Scotland]], due likely to hearty prey populations (rabbits) but also probably a lower local rate of persecution than elsewhere in the British isles. Here, the mean number of fledglings were 1.75 against 0.82\u20131.41 in other parts of Britain.<ref name= Austin/> It was found in the English [[The Midlands|Midlands]] that breeding success both by measure of clutch size and mean number of fledglings, was relatively high thanks again to high prey populations. Breeding success was lower farther from significant stands of trees in the Midlands and most nesting failures that could be determined occurred in the incubation stage, possibly in correlation with predation of eggs by [[corvid]]s.<ref name= Sim/> More significant than even prey, late winter-early spring was found to be likely the primary driver of breeding success in buzzards from southern [[Norway]]. Here, even in peak [[vole]] years, nesting success could be considerably hampered by heavy snow at this crucial stage.  In Norway, large clutches of 3+ were expected only in years with minimal snow cover, high vole populations and lighter rains in May\u2013June.<ref name= Selas3/> In the Italian [[Alps]], the mean number of fledglings per pair was 1.07.<ref name= Sergio/> 33.4% of nesting attempts were failures per a study in southwestern [[Germany]], with an average of 1.06 of all nesting attempts and 1.61 for all successful attempt. In Germany, weather conditions and rodent populations seemed to be the primary drivers of nesting success.<ref name= Rockenbauch/> In [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]] part of [[Spain]] contrasted with [[Biscay]] to the north, higher levels of interspecific competition from [[booted eagle]]s and [[northern goshawk]]s did not appear to negatively affect breeding success due to more ample prey populations (rabbits again) in Murcia than in Biscay.<ref name= Zuberogoitia/>\n\nIn the [[Westphalia]] area of Germany, it was found that intermediate colour morphs were more productive than those that were darker or lighter.<ref name= Kruger2/> For reasons that are not entirely clear, apparently fewer parasites were found to afflict broods of intermediate plumaged buzzard less so than dark and light [[phenotype]]s, in particular higher [[melanin]] levels somehow were found to be more inviting to parasitic organism that effect the health of the buzzard's offspring.<ref>Chakarov, N., Boerner, M., & Kr\u00fcger, O.

Almost certainly, it is the most numerous diurnal bird of prey throughout Europe. Conservative estimates put the total population at no fewer than 700,000 pairs in Europe, which are more than twice the total estimates for the next four birds of prey estimated as most common: the [[Eurasian sparrowhawk]] (more than 340,000 pairs), the [[common kestrel]] (more than 330,000 pairs) and the [[northern goshawk]] (more than 160,000 pairs).<ref name= BirdlifeEurope/> Ferguson-Lees et al. roughly estimated that the total population of the common buzzard ranges to nearly 5 million pairs but at time was including the now spilit-off species of [[Eastern buzzard|eastern]] and [[Himalayan buzzard]]s in those numbers.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/> These numbers may be excessive but the total population of common buzzards is certain to total well over seven figures.<ref name=IUCN/><ref name= Ferguson-Lees/> More recently, the [[IUCN]] estimated the common buzzard species (sans the Himalayan and eastern species) to number somewhere between 2.1 and 3.7 million birds, which would put this buzzard one of the most numerous of all acciptrid family members (estimates for Eurasian sparrowhawks, red-tailed hawks and northern goshawks also may range over 2 million).<ref name=IUCN/> In 1991, other than their absence in [[Iceland]], after having been extent as breeder by 1910, buzzards recolonized [[Ireland]] sometime in 1950s and has increased by the 1990s to 26 pairs.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Rooney/> Supplemental feeding has reportedly helped the Irish buzzard population to rebound, especially where rabbits have decreased.<ref name= Rooney2/> Most other countries have at least four figures of breeding pairs. As of the 1990s, other countries such as [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], [[France]], [[Switzerland]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Poland]], [[Sweden]], [[Belarus]] and the [[Ukraine]] all numbered pairs well into five figures, while [[Germany]] had an estimated 140,000 pairs and European Russian may have held 500,000 pairs.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= BirdlifeEurope/> Between 44,000 and 61,000 pairs nested in [[Great Britain]] by 2001 with numbers gradually increasing after past persecution, habitat alteration and prey reductions, making it by far the most abundant diurnal raptor there.<ref name= Clements>Clements, R. (2002). ''The Common Buzzard in Britain''. British Birds, 95, 377\u2013383.</ref> In [[Westphalia]], [[Germany]], population of Buzzards was shown to nearly triple over the last few decades. The Westphalian buzzards are possibly benefiting from increasingly warmer mean climate, which in turn is increasing vulnerability of voles. However, the rate of increase was significantly greater in males than in females, in part because of reintroduced [[Eurasian eagle-owl]]s to the region preying on nests (including the brooding mother), which may in turn put undue pressure on the local buzzard population.<ref>Jonker, R.

Ibis, 156(1), 97\u2013106.</ref>\n\nAt least 238 common buzzards killed through persecution were recovered in [[England]] from 1975 to 1989, largely through poisoning. Persecution did not significantly differ at any time due this span of years nor did the persecution rates decrease, nor did it when compared to rates of last survey of this in 1981.<ref>Elliott, G. D., & Avery, M. I. (1991). ''A review of reports of buzzard persecution 1975\u20131989''.

F. (2000). ''Avian mortality from power lines: a morphologic approach of a species-specific mortality. '' Biological Conservation, 95(3), 353\u2013359.</ref> Given its relative abundance, the common buzzard is held as an ideal [[bioindicator]], as they are effected by a range of pesticide and metal contamination through pollution like other raptors but are largely resilient to these at the population levels. In turn, this allows biologists to study (and [[harvest]] as necessary) the buzzards intensively and their environments without affecting their overall population. The lack of affect may be due to the buzzard's adaptability as well as it relatively short, terrestrially based food chain, which exposes them to less risk of contamination and population depletions than raptors that prey more heavily on water-based prey (such as some large eagles) or birds (such as [[falcon]]s).<ref>Naccari, C., Cristani, M., Cimino, F., Arcoraci, T., & Trombetta, D.

The country joined the [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]] in an effort to defeat [[First French Empire|France]] under [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].\n\n==Background==\nIn 1803 [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] had declared war on [[First French Empire|France]], at this time Sweden had remained neutral together with the Nordic countries [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] and [[Prussia]]. But after the execution of [[Louis-Antoine-Henri de Bourbon-Cond\u00e9]] in 1804, the Swedish government broke all diplomatic ties with France and concluded a convention allowing the British to use [[Swedish Pomerania]] as a military base against France, in exchange for payments. [[Russia]] also promised Sweden that 40,000 men would come to the aid of the country if it was threatened by French forces. So on 9 August 1805 Sweden joined the Third Coalition and declared war on France on 31 October.<ref>Lindqvist, Herman(2004) page 256</ref>\n\n==The war==\n===The offensive against Hanover===\nIn the beginning of November 1805, a combined British, Russian and Swedish force of about 12,000 men were sent from Swedish Pomerania to liberate French-held [[Hanover]]. The offensive against Hanover was repeatedly delayed because of Prussia's partial reluctance that the Swedes and the Russians moved troops through Prussian territory. However, in December 1805, after the battle of [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], the British and the Russian forces started to evacuate Hanover, leaving only a small Swedish force alone to face the French. In April 1806, the Swedes were also forced to retreat back to Swedish Pomerania after an agreement had been concluded between Prussia and France.\n\n===The Fourth Coalition===\nBut during the summer of 1806 Prussia formed the [[Fourth Coalition]] against France, which gave Sweden the right to occupy [[Lauenburg]]. But during the autumn, the French forces advanced rapidly and soon much of the western German regions were occupied, this forced the Swedish troops on a retreat towards [[L\u00fcbeck]]. The plan was that the troops from there could take the sea route to [[Stralsund]] in order to avoid the advancing French forces. The Swedes were still caught by the French on the 6 November while they loaded their ships at L\u00fcbeck, and following the battle of [[Battle of L\u00fcbeck|L\u00fcbeck]] about 1,000 Swedish soldiers had to surrender to the numerically superior French forces.\n\nThe French army began their offensive towards Swedish Pomerania in early 1807 and [[Siege of Stralsund (1807)|besieged Stralsund]] on 15 January. This was the beginning of a seven-month-long siege, and since the French forces also were engaged in warfare elsewhere this increasingly reduced the number of troops stationed around Stralsund. When the Swedes were reinforced on 1 April it was decided that they would attempt to break the siege. This was done with some success since the Swedes managed to take [[Usedom]] and [[Wolin]]. But the French chose to counterattack, and a force of 13,000 men attacked the Swedes from [[Stettin]] on 16 April. This forced the left section of the Swedish army to withdraw, and another division in [[Ueckerm\u00fcnde]] was then cut off and later captured. On 18 April, France and Sweden agreed on a ceasefire according to which the French were to leave [[Pomerania]]. However, the Swedish government refused to join the [[Continental System]] and denounced the armistice under the influence of British diplomacy on 8 July.\n\nOn 6 August 1807, 50,000 French, Spanish and Dutch troops under Marshal [[Guillaume-Marie-Anne Brune]] began an assault on Swedish Pomerania and besieged Stralsund again. On 20 August 1807, the defenders of the city capitulated and the remains of the Swedish army was surrounded at [[R\u00fcgen]].  However, Swedish General [[Johan Christopher Toll]] managed to conclude the convention of Schlatkow with Marshal Brune on favorable terms and his forces withdrew to Sweden with all of their munitions of war on 7 September.<ref>Sundberg, Ulf(2002), page 357-362</ref>\n\n===Franco-Russian treaty===\nThe Franco-Russian [[Treaty of Tilsit]] left Britain and Sweden without other allies in the war against France. On 21 February 1808, Russia joined the war against Sweden by invading [[Finnish War|Finland]] and on 14 March the same year, Denmark-Norway also [[Dano-Swedish War of 1808-1809|declared war]] on Sweden. Danish and French-Spanish troops began preparations for an invasion of [[Sk\u00e5ne]] in Sweden, but the plan was soon aborted, and the war was instead directed to the Norwegian-Swedish border. [[John Moore (British Army officer)|Sir John Moore]]'s expedition sent by the British government to protect Sweden from possible French-Danish attack arrived on 3 May 1808 and stayed until July when it was redirected to Portugal.\n\nNapoleon's plans to invade Sweden was never realized due to the British activity on the [[Baltic Sea]], the weakness of the Danish military and hesitations of French Marshal [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Bernadotte]]. Bernadotte's actions made him popular enough to be elected as a Swedish [[Crown Prince]] after the [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] in March 1809.  On 30 August 1809, the new Swedish government was to conclude the [[Treaty of Fredrikshamn]] with Russia legitimizing the Russian annexation of Finland and [[\u00c5land]]. A peace treaty between Sweden and Denmark-Norway was signed with no territorial adjustments on 10 December 1809.\n\n==Aftermath==\nOn 6 January 1810, Sweden signed a Russian-mediated [[Treaty of Paris (1810)|Treaty of Paris]] with France regaining Pomerania, at a cost of joining the [[Continental System]]. On 17 November 1810, Sweden was forced to declare [[Anglo-Swedish War (1810\u20131812)|war against Britain]] and all British goods in Swedish Pomerania were seized. The government-supported smuggling continued, however, over the [[North Sea]] and the English fleet was informed that it would be a phantom war. The war lasted until 1812 and no military action was taken.\n\n==See also==\n*[[English Wars (Scandinavia)]]\n**[[Gunboat War]]\n**[[Dano-Swedish War of 1808-1809]]\n*[[Finnish War]]\n*[[Second War against Napoleon]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*''[https://web.archive.org/web/20111004032717/http://www.hjle.se/webbsidor/ku_gustav_adolf1805.htm The War against Napoleon: 1805\u20131810]'' on [http://www.hjle.se/ Lennart Hjelm]\n\n===Literature===\n*Lindqvist, Herman(2004) \u2013 ''Napoleon'' (Schibsted forlagene) {{ISBN|978-82-516-2157-1}}\n*Sundberg, Ulf(2002) \u2013 ''Svenska krig, 1521\u20131814'' (Hjalmarson & H\u00f6gberg) {{ISBN|91-89080-14-9}}\n\n{{Napoleonic Wars}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:First War Against Napoleon}}\n[[Category:Wars involving Sweden|Napoleon, First War]]\n[[Category:19th century in Sweden]]\n[[Category:France\u2013Sweden relations]]\n[[Category:Wars involving France]]\n[[Category:Napoleonic Wars]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=December 2009}}\n{{infobox military conflict\n| conflict             = The Pomeranian War\n| partof               = the [[Napoleonic Wars]]\n| image                = Swedish Pomerania 1812.png\n| image_size           = 270px\n| caption              = '''Swedish Pomerania''' ''(centre-right)'' in 1812\n| date                 = 31 October 1805 \u2013 6 January 1810 <br> (4 years 11 months & 6 days)\n| place                = [[Swedish Pomerania]] \n| coordinates          = \n| map_type             = \n| latitude             = \n| longitude            = \n| map_size             = \n| map_caption          = \n| map_label            = \n| territory            = \n| result               = French victory, [[Treaty of Paris (1810)|Treaty of Paris]]\n*Sweden regains Swedish Pomerania\n*Sweden integrates the [[Continental System]]\n| status               = \n| combatant1           = {{Flagicon|First French Empire}} [[First French Empire|French Empire]]<br>{{flagicon|Spain|1785}} [[Enlightenment in Spain|Spanish Empire]]<br>{{flagicon|Holland}} [[Kingdom of Holland|Holland]]<ref>Sundberg, Ulf(2002), page 357-362</ref>\n| combatant2           = {{flagicon|Sweden}} [[Sweden]]<br />{{Flagcountry|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland}}<br />{{flagcountry|Prussia|1803}}\n| combatant3           = \n| commander1           = {{Flagicon|First French Empire}} [[Guillaume-Marie-Anne Brune|Guillaume Brune]]<br /> {{Flagicon|First French Empire}} [[\u00c9douard Adolphe Casimir Joseph Mortier|\u00c9douard Mortier]]<br /> {{flagicon|Spain|1785}} [[Pedro Caro, 3rd Marquis of la Romana]]<br />{{flagicon|Holland}} [[Louis Bonaparte]]<br />{{flagicon|Holland}} [[Jean-Baptiste Dumonceau|Jean Dumonceau]]\n| commander2           = {{flagicon|Sweden}} [[Gustav IV Adolf]]<sup>[a]</sup><br />{{flagicon|Sweden}} [[Charles XIII]]<sup>[a]</sup> <br />{{flagicon|Sweden}} [[Hans Henric von Essen|Hans von Essen]]<br />{{flagicon|Sweden}} [[Johan Christopher Toll]]\n| commander3           = \n| units1               =\n| units2               =\n| units3               = \n| strength1            = 13,000 men  (in 1805) <br />40,000 men (in 1810) \n| strength2            = 12,125 men  (in 1805) <br />27,000 men (in 1810)\n| strength3            = \n| casualties1          = \n| casualties2          = \n| casualties3          = \n| notes                = \n<small>[a]</small> Gustav IV Adolf was deposed by a [[coup d'etat]] on March 9, 1809, and Charles XIII was appointed king in his place.\n<small>[b]</small> Until 1808\n| campaignbox = {{Campaignbox Napoleonic Wars}}\n}}\nThe '''Franco-Swedish War''' or '''Pomeranian War''' was the first involvement by [[Sweden]] in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The country joined the [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]] in an effort to defeat [[First French Empire|France]] under [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].\n\n==Background==\nIn 1803 [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] had declared war on [[First French Empire|France]], at this time Sweden had remained neutral together with the Nordic countries [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] and [[Prussia]]. But after the execution of [[Louis-Antoine-Henri de Bourbon-Cond\u00e9]] in 1804, the Swedish government broke all diplomatic ties with France and concluded a convention allowing the British to use [[Swedish Pomerania]] as a military base against France, in exchange for payments. [[Russia]] also promised Sweden that 40,000 men would come to the aid of the country if it was threatened by French forces. So on 9 August 1805 Sweden joined the Third Coalition and declared war on France on 31 October.<ref>Lindqvist, Herman(2004) page 256</ref>\n\n==The war==\n===The offensive against Hanover===\nIn the beginning of November 1805, a combined British, Russian and Swedish force of about 12,000 men were sent from Swedish Pomerania to liberate French-held [[Hanover]]. The offensive against Hanover was repeatedly delayed because of Prussia's partial reluctance that the Swedes and the Russians moved troops through Prussian territory. However, in December 1805, after the battle of [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], the British and the Russian forces started to evacuate Hanover, leaving only a small Swedish force alone to face the French. In April 1806, the Swedes were also forced to retreat back to Swedish Pomerania after an agreement had been concluded between Prussia and France.\n\n===The Fourth Coalition===\nBut during the summer of 1806 Prussia formed the [[Fourth Coalition]] against France, which gave Sweden the right to occupy [[Lauenburg]]. But during the autumn, the French forces advanced rapidly and soon much of the western German regions were occupied, this forced the Swedish troops on a retreat towards [[L\u00fcbeck]]. The plan was that the troops from there could take the sea route to [[Stralsund]] in order to avoid the advancing French forces. The Swedes were still caught by the French on the 6 November while they loaded their ships at L\u00fcbeck, and following the battle of [[Battle of L\u00fcbeck|L\u00fcbeck]] about 1,000 Swedish soldiers had to surrender to the numerically superior French forces.\n\nThe French army began their offensive towards Swedish Pomerania in early 1807 and [[Siege of Stralsund (1807)|besieged Stralsund]] on 15 January. This was the beginning of a seven-month-long siege, and since the French forces also were engaged in warfare elsewhere this increasingly reduced the number of troops stationed around Stralsund. When the Swedes were reinforced on 1 April it was decided that they would attempt to break the siege. This was done with some success since the Swedes managed to take [[Usedom]] and [[Wolin]]. But the French chose to counterattack, and a force of 13,000 men attacked the Swedes from [[Stettin]] on 16 April. This forced the left section of the Swedish army to withdraw, and another division in [[Ueckerm\u00fcnde]] was then cut off and later captured. On 18 April, France and Sweden agreed on a ceasefire according to which the French were to leave [[Pomerania]]. However, the Swedish government refused to join the [[Continental System]] and denounced the armistice under the influence of British diplomacy on 8 July.\n\nOn 6 August 1807, 50,000 French, Spanish and Dutch troops under Marshal [[Guillaume-Marie-Anne Brune]] began an assault on Swedish Pomerania and besieged Stralsund again. On 20 August 1807, the defenders of the city capitulated and the remains of the Swedish army was surrounded at [[R\u00fcgen]].  However, Swedish General [[Johan Christopher Toll]] managed to conclude the convention of Schlatkow with Marshal Brune on favorable terms and his forces withdrew to Sweden with all of their munitions of war on 7 September.<ref>Sundberg, Ulf(2002), page 357-362</ref>\n\n===Franco-Russian treaty===\nThe Franco-Russian [[Treaty of Tilsit]] left Britain and Sweden without other allies in the war against France.
