The character reappeared in 2019 and 2020, portrayed by a body double and using archive footage.\n\n==Storylines==\n===1993\u20132010===\nLucy and her twin brother [[Peter Beale]] (Francis Brittin-Snell) are born in December 1993, to [[Ian Beale|Ian]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) and [[Cindy Beale]] ([[Michelle Collins]]). The twins are born on the same day Ian's father, [[Pete Beale]] ([[Peter Dean (actor)|Peter Dean]]), dies in a car accident with his girlfriend, [[Rose Chapman]] ([[Petra Markham]]). In 1996, Cindy hires a hitman to kill Ian, but he survives and fearing she will be arrested, she goes on the run with Peter and her eldest son, [[Steven Beale]] (Stuart Stevens), and she is unable to get Lucy. Ian hires a private investigator, who locates Cindy in Italy and Ian, his stepfather [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) and Phil's brother [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]), go to Italy and take Steven and Peter (now played by Stuart Stevens). Cindy returns to Walford with her boyfriend, [[Nick Holland (EastEnders)|Nick Holland]] (Dominic Taylor), and she wins custody of Steven, Lucy and Peter (now played by Joseph Shade), but is arrested for attempted murder and is remanded in custody, so the children stay with Ian. In November 1998, Cindy dies of complications after giving birth to hers and Nick's daughter [[Cindy Williams (EastEnders)|Cindy Williams]] (Eva Wortley and Cydney Parker), who is Lucy's younger half-sister. Steven, Lucy and Peter grow up with various stepmothers: [[Mel Owen|Mel Healy]] ([[Tamzin Outhwaite]]) splits from Ian straight after marrying him in Millennium Eve due to her finding out Lucy was not sick with cancer as initially feared and in July 2003, Ian's wife [[Laura Beale]] ([[Hannah Waterman]]) gives birth to hers and Ian's son, [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby Beale]] (Kevin Curran), who is Lucy and Peter's younger half-brother, and they separate when Ian denies paternity, but she later dies in March 2004. Ian meets [[Jane Beale|Jane Collins]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) at the fair, but Lucy and Peter struggle to bond with her due to Ian's past relationships, but are persuaded by Ian's aunt, [[Pauline Fowler]] ([[Wendy Richard]]) to give her a chance. Lucy and Peter are both picked on by twins [[Demi Miller]] ([[Shana Swash]]) and [[Darren Miller]] ([[Charlie G. Hawkins]]).\n\nProgressing into her teens, Lucy becomes rebellious\u2014stealing, smoking, drinking alcohol, lying, playing truant from school, being surly to Ian and Jane, and taking an interest in boys. Things worsen when Ian employs [[Craig Dixon (EastEnders)|Craig Dixon]] ([[Rory Jennings]]) in his chip shop. Lucy and Craig are attracted to one another, and despite Craig being five years older than Lucy, they begin dating. Craig is a bad influence on Lucy, and upon discovering their relationship, Ian warns Craig away. Lucy runs away with Craig, unperturbed that he carries a gun and assaulted [[Patrick Trueman]] ([[Rudolph Walker]]). However, when he tries to press her for sex, she panics and returns to Walford, telling Ian that Craig assaulted Patrick. Craig is arrested for attempted murder; however, Lucy keeps his gun, which he had stashed in her bag.\n\nIn 2007, Lucy is contacted by a person claiming to be Cindy. It transpires that Steven (now played by [[Aaron Sidwell]]) was posing as Cindy to terrorise and kidnap Ian, blaming him for Cindy's death. Steven holds Ian hostage for weeks, while moving in with the Beale family. The situation ends when Steven accidentally shoots Jane with Craig's gun. Ian gets Steven psychiatric help and allows him to live with them, to Lucy's delight. Ian and Lucy argue about a party Lucy had in his absence. Ian slaps Lucy and she runs away. The Beales search for Lucy for weeks, before it is revealed that Steven has been hiding her, turning her against Ian and convincing her to move to France, so he can usurp her place in Ian's affections. Ian discovers the truth and convinces Lucy to come home and banishes Steven.\n\nLucy stays with Jane's brother [[Christian Clarke]] ([[John Partridge (actor)|John Partridge]]) briefly, has a relationship with an older boy, [[Olly Greenwood]] (Bart Edwards), decides to take the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|contraceptive pill]] and engages in blackmail to earn money. Lucy has sex with [[Leon Small]] ([[Sam Attwater]]) and gets pregnant; unaware of this, Leon dumps Lucy for [[Zsa Zsa Carter]] ([[Emer Kenny]]). Not ready to be a mother, Lucy asks Jane to adopt her baby and Jane agrees. Ian, however, is concerned that Jane manipulated Lucy to allow her to adopt the baby as she cannot have one of her own. He makes Lucy watch a video of a woman giving birth and persuades her to have an abortion. They agree to tell Jane that she miscarried.\n\nLucy receives excellent grades in her [[GCSE]]s, having paid [[Adam Best (EastEnders)|Adam Best]] ([[David Proud]]) to help her cheat. When the school question the authenticity of her exam results, she admits that she cheated and is told to retake her final year. Lucy decides not to and goes to her grandmother [[Bev Williams]] ([[Diane Langton]]) in Devon.\n\n===2012\u20132019===\nLucy returns to Walford for the funeral of [[Pat Butcher|Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St Clement]]) and is angry to find that Ian is engaged to [[Mandy Salter]] ([[Nicola Stapleton]]). Lucy dislikes Mandy and tries to stop her marrying Ian. She sabotages Mandy's wedding dress, sets her up, and tries to poison Bobby (now played by Alex Francis) against her, all unsuccessfully. Having noticed [[Whitney Dean]]'s ([[Shona McGarty]]) attraction to [[Tyler Moon]] (Tony Discipline), Lucy causes trouble by upset by sleeping with him. Lucy and Whitney are antagonistic but eventually make amends because of they are both friends with [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]). On Mandy and Ian's wedding day, Lucy gives Ian an ultimatum: her or Mandy. She is distraught when he chooses Mandy but Mandy is unhappy and admits she does not love Ian and leaves. Ian has a nervous breakdown and disappears, leaving Bobby with Lucy. Following her father's disappearance, Lucy struggles to keep his businesses afloat and has trouble with [[Derek Branning]] ([[Jamie Foreman]]) who repeatedly steals money from the caf\u00e9 and chip shop. Derek's son, [[Joey Branning]] ([[David Witts]]), tricks Derek to give him money, which he returns to Lucy. Joey and Lucy like each other and star dating. Lucy decides she does not need Ian and renames the caf\u00e9 \"Cindy's\". Lauren discovers that Ian is homeless but Lucy refuses to see him. Lauren's parents bring Ian back to Walford, and when Lucy opens the door, she slams it in his face. However, [[Sharon Watts|Sharon Rickman]] ([[Letitia Dean]]) convinces her to give Ian another chance and she agrees, providing that the businesses and properties are transferred to her so she will never be in that situation again. Ian agrees and signs the agreement. He eventually returns to work and Lucy promises to be there for him. Joey kisses Whitney, angering her. Eventually, Lauren urges Whitney to tell Lucy, and Lucy breaks up with Joey briefly. They reconcile, despite Joey not having feelings for her. Joey says that it will never work and leaves her. Lucy worries when she finds a lump in her breast, but it is benign.\n\nJoey starts dating Lauren, his cousin. Lucy is jealous and splits them up by spiking Lauren's drink with vodka, making Joey believe that Lauren is drinking excessively. Lucy is opposed to Ian's plans to open a restaurant, worried he cannot cope. When Lauren applies for a job as a waitress, Lucy deliberately sets Joey up as Lauren's test customer, hoping she will fail. Although Whitney is chosen, she withdraws her application so Lauren gets the job but is soon sacked. Lucy provokes Lauren, who punches Lucy and smashes the caf\u00e9 window. Lauren is arrested but Lucy decides not to press charges. Ian steals cheques from the business account to pay for his new restaurant; Lucy believes that [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]) supplied the extra money. When she discovers the truth, she has a vicious row with Ian, which is interrupted by Peter's (now played by [[Ben Hardy (actor)|Ben Hardy]]) return to Walford.\n\nLucy gets upset when Joey insists that they do not have a future together and Ian takes advantage of this, manipulating her into signing a contract that gives control of the businesses back to him. When Lucy discovers what has happened, she and Ian argue and she goes to work for Janine. Lucy develops a rivalry with her colleague, [[Danny Pennant]] ([[Gary Lucy]]), and they use dirty tactics against each other to gain commission on their pay. However, Lucy discovers Danny is squatting in one of Janine's flats as he is homeless. Danny pleads with Lucy not to tell and she agrees but warns him that she now has power over him. Lucy is pleased when Ian invites his girlfriend, [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]) and Lucy\u2019s half-sister Cindy (now played by [[Mimi Keene]]) to move in. Lucy and Lauren start up their own letting agents company, called LB Lettings.\n\nWhile having a sexual affair with her best friend Lauren's father, Max, Lucy also has sex with newcomer [[Lee Carter (EastEnders)|Lee Carter]] ([[Danny-Boy Hatchard]]). He wants to begin a relationship but Lucy is more interested in Max. Lucy and Max sleep together again, but when Lee compliments her looks, Lucy realises that Lee cares about her and Max is just using her. Lucy is devastated, however, when she sees Lee kissing Whitney. Lucy is shaken when Max shows her photographs of them kissing and reveals that someone e-mailed them to him. Lucy swears she knows nothing about it. Ian begins to show how proud he is of Lucy and her new business, infuriating Cindy. Lucy later spots Lee and Whitney kissing again but meets him in the restaurant to have sex. Lucy breaks down, however, and Lee comforts her. Unbeknownst to Lee and Lucy, Jake sees them through the window. Cindy tells Ian that Lucy was arrested for shoplifting in Devon and is hiding something in her jewellery box. Worried, Ian and Jane open the box, and to their horror, find a bag of cocaine. After being chased out of the restaurant, Lucy angrily shouts at Ian, saying she wishes he was not her father. Ian tells Lucy that she is his favourite child but Peter overhears and leaves in shock. Lucy follows but cannot find him. Shortly after, Lucy gets a text message and leaves the Square.\n\nThe next day, Lucy's body is found on Walford Common after having been murdered the previous night. That afternoon, police officers [[DC Emma Summerhayes]] ([[Anna Acton]]) and [[Cameron Bryant|DS Cameron Bryant]] ([[Glen Wallace]]) tell Ian that Lucy is dead. Ian identifies her body at Walford mortuary. Her funeral takes place, and the police continue to investigate her murder. When Peter proposes to Lauren, he confesses that he supplied drugs to Lucy. After the proposal, Lee finds a video that proves Lauren has given a false alibi.\n\nMax, his daughters and Emma are invited for Christmas Day at Ian's. Cindy receives, as a present from a mysterious sender, Lucy's jewellery box. Who it could be and the reason why worries the Beales and their guests. Emma, no longer on the case officially, soon discovers who she thinks killed Lucy and confronts the killer. Before reporting them, Emma is accidentally run over and dies from a brain bleed. Lauren uses Emma's case notes and becomes suspicious as to who killed her. Lauren discovers Lucy was killed at home and writes this in a card to Ian and Jane. Peter, after being told by Lauren that Lucy was killed at home, accuses Ian and Jane but Ian believes Jane is responsible, but realises that her story does not add up and that she is covering for Bobby (now played by Eliot Carrington). Jane explains that she found Lucy on the floor in the living room with Bobby holding her jewellery box\u2014having hit her over the head\u2014and that Bobby does not know he killed her. The Beales agree to keep it a secret from him. It also transpires that Lucy had been writing a letter to Ian shortly before Bobby hit her, telling her father to wake her when he returns home, that she has resolved to change and she loves him. Bobby gave the letter to Cindy, who gave it to Ian.\n\nOver two years after Lucy's murder, Bobby is convicted of the crime and sentenced to three years imprisonment. Bobby (now portrayed by Clay Milner Russell) is released after three years and struggles with his guilt; in the Beale house, he begins seeing visions of Lucy.\n\n==Casting and development==\n[[File:Lucy Beale 2.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Casey Anne Rothery as Lucy Beale (1999)]]\nAs a baby and toddler, Lucy was played by Eva Brittin-Snell for the first three years. Casey Anne Rothery took over the role in 1996 and played Lucy for nearly eight years. In August 2004 it was announced that Rothery, along with Joseph Shade, who played Lucy's twin brother [[Peter Beale]], had been axed from ''EastEnders'' as producers were looking to mature the characters.

Rothery's family were said to be furious, with a family friend telling ''[[The People]]'', \"It was a bolt out of the blue. She is devastated and has been in tears.

The character was played by Eva Brittin-Snell (from 1993 to 1996), Casey Anne Rothery (from 1996 until 2004), [[Melissa Suffield]] (from 2004 to 2010), and [[Hetti Bywater]] (from 2012 to 2015). Lucy was introduced in December 1993 as the baby daughter of [[Ian Beale|Ian]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) and [[Cindy Beale]] ([[Michelle Collins]]).

In 2010, Suffield left ''EastEnders'', after she was allegedly axed due to \"unruly behaviour.\" On 14 November 2011, it was announced Lucy would be returning in 2012 with Bywater taking over the role. She returned on 12 January 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a358006/eastenders-meet-the-new-lucy-beale-pictures.html|title=Meet the new Lucy Beale|first=Daniel|last=Kilkelly|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|date=3 January 2012|accessdate=3 January 2012}}</ref> Her storylines have included teenage [[pregnancy]], [[abortion]], cheating in her exams, struggling to cope when Ian has a mental breakdown and runs away, feuding, taking over Ian's businesses, and multiple relationships (including a relationship with her best friend's father, [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]).\n\nOn 21 February 2014, it was announced that Lucy would be murdered, starting a dark chapter for the Beale family and a [[whodunnit]] storyline that would run until the show's 30th anniversary in February 2015 when the identity of the murderer would be revealed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/eastenders/posts/Death-in-Walford-Lucy-Beales-dramatic-exit |title=Death in Walford: Lucy Beale's dramatic exit |publisher=BBC |date=21 February 2014 |accessdate=15 June 2014}}</ref> The \"[[Who Killed Lucy Beale?]]\" storyline was billed as the soap's biggest [[whodunnit]], and was ''EastEnders''' biggest marketing campaign to date.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a557979/eastenders-plans-biggest-ever-marketing-campaign-for-lucy-beale-death.html |title=EastEnders plans biggest ever marketing campaign for Lucy Beale deathpublisher=Digital Spy |date=17 March 2014 |accessdate=15 June 2014}}</ref> Bywater returned in a  [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] episode on 19 February 2015 to explore unanswered questions about the night Lucy died.<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a619170/eastenders-plans-who-killed-lucy-beale-flashback-episode.html EastEnders plans 'Who Killed Lucy Beale?' flashback episode \u2013 EastEnders News \u2013 Soaps \u2013 Digital Spy<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The same episode revealed that Lucy's 10-year-old half-brother Bobby was her killer, after 10 months of secrecy regarding her demise. The character reappeared in 2019 and 2020, portrayed by a body double and using archive footage.\n\n==Storylines==\n===1993\u20132010===\nLucy and her twin brother [[Peter Beale]] (Francis Brittin-Snell) are born in December 1993, to [[Ian Beale|Ian]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) and [[Cindy Beale]] ([[Michelle Collins]]). The twins are born on the same day Ian's father, [[Pete Beale]] ([[Peter Dean (actor)|Peter Dean]]), dies in a car accident with his girlfriend, [[Rose Chapman]] ([[Petra Markham]]). In 1996, Cindy hires a hitman to kill Ian, but he survives and fearing she will be arrested, she goes on the run with Peter and her eldest son, [[Steven Beale]] (Stuart Stevens), and she is unable to get Lucy. Ian hires a private investigator, who locates Cindy in Italy and Ian, his stepfather [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) and Phil's brother [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]), go to Italy and take Steven and Peter (now played by Stuart Stevens). Cindy returns to Walford with her boyfriend, [[Nick Holland (EastEnders)|Nick Holland]] (Dominic Taylor), and she wins custody of Steven, Lucy and Peter (now played by Joseph Shade), but is arrested for attempted murder and is remanded in custody, so the children stay with Ian. In November 1998, Cindy dies of complications after giving birth to hers and Nick's daughter [[Cindy Williams (EastEnders)|Cindy Williams]] (Eva Wortley and Cydney Parker), who is Lucy's younger half-sister. Steven, Lucy and Peter grow up with various stepmothers: [[Mel Owen|Mel Healy]] ([[Tamzin Outhwaite]]) splits from Ian straight after marrying him in Millennium Eve due to her finding out Lucy was not sick with cancer as initially feared and in July 2003, Ian's wife [[Laura Beale]] ([[Hannah Waterman]]) gives birth to hers and Ian's son, [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby Beale]] (Kevin Curran), who is Lucy and Peter's younger half-brother, and they separate when Ian denies paternity, but she later dies in March 2004. Ian meets [[Jane Beale|Jane Collins]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) at the fair, but Lucy and Peter struggle to bond with her due to Ian's past relationships, but are persuaded by Ian's aunt, [[Pauline Fowler]] ([[Wendy Richard]]) to give her a chance. Lucy and Peter are both picked on by twins [[Demi Miller]] ([[Shana Swash]]) and [[Darren Miller]] ([[Charlie G. Hawkins]]).\n\nProgressing into her teens, Lucy becomes rebellious\u2014stealing, smoking, drinking alcohol, lying, playing truant from school, being surly to Ian and Jane, and taking an interest in boys. Things worsen when Ian employs [[Craig Dixon (EastEnders)|Craig Dixon]] ([[Rory Jennings]]) in his chip shop. Lucy and Craig are attracted to one another, and despite Craig being five years older than Lucy, they begin dating. Craig is a bad influence on Lucy, and upon discovering their relationship, Ian warns Craig away. Lucy runs away with Craig, unperturbed that he carries a gun and assaulted [[Patrick Trueman]] ([[Rudolph Walker]]). However, when he tries to press her for sex, she panics and returns to Walford, telling Ian that Craig assaulted Patrick. Craig is arrested for attempted murder; however, Lucy keeps his gun, which he had stashed in her bag.\n\nIn 2007, Lucy is contacted by a person claiming to be Cindy. It transpires that Steven (now played by [[Aaron Sidwell]]) was posing as Cindy to terrorise and kidnap Ian, blaming him for Cindy's death. Steven holds Ian hostage for weeks, while moving in with the Beale family. The situation ends when Steven accidentally shoots Jane with Craig's gun. Ian gets Steven psychiatric help and allows him to live with them, to Lucy's delight. Ian and Lucy argue about a party Lucy had in his absence. Ian slaps Lucy and she runs away. The Beales search for Lucy for weeks, before it is revealed that Steven has been hiding her, turning her against Ian and convincing her to move to France, so he can usurp her place in Ian's affections. Ian discovers the truth and convinces Lucy to come home and banishes Steven.\n\nLucy stays with Jane's brother [[Christian Clarke]] ([[John Partridge (actor)|John Partridge]]) briefly, has a relationship with an older boy, [[Olly Greenwood]] (Bart Edwards), decides to take the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|contraceptive pill]] and engages in blackmail to earn money. Lucy has sex with [[Leon Small]] ([[Sam Attwater]]) and gets pregnant; unaware of this, Leon dumps Lucy for [[Zsa Zsa Carter]] ([[Emer Kenny]]). Not ready to be a mother, Lucy asks Jane to adopt her baby and Jane agrees. Ian, however, is concerned that Jane manipulated Lucy to allow her to adopt the baby as she cannot have one of her own. He makes Lucy watch a video of a woman giving birth and persuades her to have an abortion. They agree to tell Jane that she miscarried.\n\nLucy receives excellent grades in her [[GCSE]]s, having paid [[Adam Best (EastEnders)|Adam Best]] ([[David Proud]]) to help her cheat. When the school question the authenticity of her exam results, she admits that she cheated and is told to retake her final year. Lucy decides not to and goes to her grandmother [[Bev Williams]] ([[Diane Langton]]) in Devon.\n\n===2012\u20132019===\nLucy returns to Walford for the funeral of [[Pat Butcher|Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St Clement]]) and is angry to find that Ian is engaged to [[Mandy Salter]] ([[Nicola Stapleton]]). Lucy dislikes Mandy and tries to stop her marrying Ian. She sabotages Mandy's wedding dress, sets her up, and tries to poison Bobby (now played by Alex Francis) against her, all unsuccessfully. Having noticed [[Whitney Dean]]'s ([[Shona McGarty]]) attraction to [[Tyler Moon]] (Tony Discipline), Lucy causes trouble by upset by sleeping with him. Lucy and Whitney are antagonistic but eventually make amends because of they are both friends with [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]). On Mandy and Ian's wedding day, Lucy gives Ian an ultimatum: her or Mandy. She is distraught when he chooses Mandy but Mandy is unhappy and admits she does not love Ian and leaves. Ian has a nervous breakdown and disappears, leaving Bobby with Lucy. Following her father's disappearance, Lucy struggles to keep his businesses afloat and has trouble with [[Derek Branning]] ([[Jamie Foreman]]) who repeatedly steals money from the caf\u00e9 and chip shop. Derek's son, [[Joey Branning]] ([[David Witts]]), tricks Derek to give him money, which he returns to Lucy. Joey and Lucy like each other and star dating. Lucy decides she does not need Ian and renames the caf\u00e9 \"Cindy's\". Lauren discovers that Ian is homeless but Lucy refuses to see him. Lauren's parents bring Ian back to Walford, and when Lucy opens the door, she slams it in his face. However, [[Sharon Watts|Sharon Rickman]] ([[Letitia Dean]]) convinces her to give Ian another chance and she agrees, providing that the businesses and properties are transferred to her so she will never be in that situation again. Ian agrees and signs the agreement. He eventually returns to work and Lucy promises to be there for him. Joey kisses Whitney, angering her. Eventually, Lauren urges Whitney to tell Lucy, and Lucy breaks up with Joey briefly. They reconcile, despite Joey not having feelings for her. Joey says that it will never work and leaves her. Lucy worries when she finds a lump in her breast, but it is benign.\n\nJoey starts dating Lauren, his cousin. Lucy is jealous and splits them up by spiking Lauren's drink with vodka, making Joey believe that Lauren is drinking excessively. Lucy is opposed to Ian's plans to open a restaurant, worried he cannot cope. When Lauren applies for a job as a waitress, Lucy deliberately sets Joey up as Lauren's test customer, hoping she will fail. Although Whitney is chosen, she withdraws her application so Lauren gets the job but is soon sacked. Lucy provokes Lauren, who punches Lucy and smashes the caf\u00e9 window. Lauren is arrested but Lucy decides not to press charges. Ian steals cheques from the business account to pay for his new restaurant; Lucy believes that [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]) supplied the extra money. When she discovers the truth, she has a vicious row with Ian, which is interrupted by Peter's (now played by [[Ben Hardy (actor)|Ben Hardy]]) return to Walford.\n\nLucy gets upset when Joey insists that they do not have a future together and Ian takes advantage of this, manipulating her into signing a contract that gives control of the businesses back to him. When Lucy discovers what has happened, she and Ian argue and she goes to work for Janine. Lucy develops a rivalry with her colleague, [[Danny Pennant]] ([[Gary Lucy]]), and they use dirty tactics against each other to gain commission on their pay. However, Lucy discovers Danny is squatting in one of Janine's flats as he is homeless. Danny pleads with Lucy not to tell and she agrees but warns him that she now has power over him. Lucy is pleased when Ian invites his girlfriend, [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]) and Lucy\u2019s half-sister Cindy (now played by [[Mimi Keene]]) to move in. Lucy and Lauren start up their own letting agents company, called LB Lettings.\n\nWhile having a sexual affair with her best friend Lauren's father, Max, Lucy also has sex with newcomer [[Lee Carter (EastEnders)|Lee Carter]] ([[Danny-Boy Hatchard]]). He wants to begin a relationship but Lucy is more interested in Max. Lucy and Max sleep together again, but when Lee compliments her looks, Lucy realises that Lee cares about her and Max is just using her. Lucy is devastated, however, when she sees Lee kissing Whitney. Lucy is shaken when Max shows her photographs of them kissing and reveals that someone e-mailed them to him. Lucy swears she knows nothing about it. Ian begins to show how proud he is of Lucy and her new business, infuriating Cindy. Lucy later spots Lee and Whitney kissing again but meets him in the restaurant to have sex. Lucy breaks down, however, and Lee comforts her. Unbeknownst to Lee and Lucy, Jake sees them through the window. Cindy tells Ian that Lucy was arrested for shoplifting in Devon and is hiding something in her jewellery box. Worried, Ian and Jane open the box, and to their horror, find a bag of cocaine. After being chased out of the restaurant, Lucy angrily shouts at Ian, saying she wishes he was not her father. Ian tells Lucy that she is his favourite child but Peter overhears and leaves in shock. Lucy follows but cannot find him. Shortly after, Lucy gets a text message and leaves the Square.\n\nThe next day, Lucy's body is found on Walford Common after having been murdered the previous night. That afternoon, police officers [[DC Emma Summerhayes]] ([[Anna Acton]]) and [[Cameron Bryant|DS Cameron Bryant]] ([[Glen Wallace]]) tell Ian that Lucy is dead. Ian identifies her body at Walford mortuary. Her funeral takes place, and the police continue to investigate her murder. When Peter proposes to Lauren, he confesses that he supplied drugs to Lucy. After the proposal, Lee finds a video that proves Lauren has given a false alibi.\n\nMax, his daughters and Emma are invited for Christmas Day at Ian's. Cindy receives, as a present from a mysterious sender, Lucy's jewellery box. Who it could be and the reason why worries the Beales and their guests. Emma, no longer on the case officially, soon discovers who she thinks killed Lucy and confronts the killer. Before reporting them, Emma is accidentally run over and dies from a brain bleed. Lauren uses Emma's case notes and becomes suspicious as to who killed her. Lauren discovers Lucy was killed at home and writes this in a card to Ian and Jane. Peter, after being told by Lauren that Lucy was killed at home, accuses Ian and Jane but Ian believes Jane is responsible, but realises that her story does not add up and that she is covering for Bobby (now played by Eliot Carrington). Jane explains that she found Lucy on the floor in the living room with Bobby holding her jewellery box\u2014having hit her over the head\u2014and that Bobby does not know he killed her. The Beales agree to keep it a secret from him. It also transpires that Lucy had been writing a letter to Ian shortly before Bobby hit her, telling her father to wake her when he returns home, that she has resolved to change and she loves him. Bobby gave the letter to Cindy, who gave it to Ian.\n\nOver two years after Lucy's murder, Bobby is convicted of the crime and sentenced to three years imprisonment. Bobby (now portrayed by Clay Milner Russell) is released after three years and struggles with his guilt; in the Beale house, he begins seeing visions of Lucy.\n\n==Casting and development==\n[[File:Lucy Beale 2.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Casey Anne Rothery as Lucy Beale (1999)]]\nAs a baby and toddler, Lucy was played by Eva Brittin-Snell for the first three years. Casey Anne Rothery took over the role in 1996 and played Lucy for nearly eight years. In August 2004 it was announced that Rothery, along with Joseph Shade, who played Lucy's twin brother [[Peter Beale]], had been axed from ''EastEnders'' as producers were looking to mature the characters. The actors were told days before filming their final scenes that they would be leaving. Rothery's family were said to be furious, with a family friend telling ''[[The People]]'', \"It was a bolt out of the blue. She is devastated and has been in tears.
