Jolly is owned by the \nlimited company 'Dansk Coladrik A/S' (Danish Coladrink Ltd). Jolly Cola is now produced by the Danish brewery Vestfyen, which also produces Jolly Light, the [[sports drink]] Jolly Time and Jolly Orange. Dansk Coladrik was founded in 1959 to compete with the american brands before they hit the danish markets, especially [[Coca-Cola]]. Many products from USA was copyed this way shortly before they were introduced in Denmark, so people already had a connection with the danish brand. Dansk Coladrink is an independent company owned by the stock holders, however the brewery Vestfyen owns the majority of the stocks in the company. Up until the 1980s, Jolly Cola had a market share of about 40% of the Danish cola market. This was extraordinary, as Denmark is one of a few countries in the world, where another cola than the original [[Coca-Cola]] has had a larger market share. \nJolly Cola is probably most famous for its slogan \u201cSay Jolly to your cola!\u201d, but on its 50th birthday, this slogan was changed into \u201cFree your taste\u201d. The bottles and cans today has the slogan \u201cEN \u00c6GTE DANSK ORIGINAL - SIDEN 1959\u201d meaning \"A REAL DANISH ORIGINAL - SINCE 1959\"\n\n==History==\nFollowing [[World War II]], many countries in the world viewed Coca-Cola as synonymous with the US and an American life-style, and as the US developed and increased its influence on society, so did Coca-Cola. In the meantime, the Danish population still had to wait until 1959, before they could buy a bottle of Coca-Cola.\n\nCoca-Cola had been marketed with moderate success from the middle of the 1930s, but then came a war, followed by rationing of sugar and finally a special tax on cola, which made the soft drink just as expensive as a beer, and therefore kept it out of the Danish market. The taxation came as a result of skilled lobbyism, carried out by breweries and producers of mineral water \u2013 and it worked as intended.\n\nFollowing the implementation of the tax in 1953, only 10,000 litres of cola soft drinks were sold in Denmark a year, primarily produced by minor Danish producers of mineral water, avoiding the competition from the American giant. However, the opposition against the taxation grew, and by the end of the 1950s it was only the communists and conservative powers in Danish politics, which had close connections to the brewing industry, that wanted a prohibitive surtax on what a member of the [[Danish Communist Party]] called \u201ca bitter cup\u201d.\n\n[[Image:F\u00f8rste Jolly reklame.jpg|thumb|An outline of the first Jolly advertisement.]]\nWhen the Danish producers finally realised that they could not keep Coca-Cola out of the Danish market anymore, they quickly changed their strategy. In January 1959 18 breweries and producers of mineral water went together to form \u2018Dansk Coladrik A/S\u2019. This initiative was instigated by Carlsberg and Tuborg so as to produce an original Danish cola that was to be sold nationwide. The soft drink was named Jolly Cola and was an all-out copy product. This regarded not only the taste, but also the organisation behind the product, which completely resembled Coca-Cola{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}, especially in terms of having a strong and centralised control of quality and marketing, combined with local bottling departments. Suddenly, the strategy seemed to be that if you could not get rid of Coca-Cola, the least you could do was to ensure that the Danish population drank Danish produced cola{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}. To a great extent, this was a success, and when the taxation was removed and \u2018the great Danish cola war\u2019 broke out in July 1959, Jolly Cola actually conquered a significant part of the new market.\n\nIn July 1959 alone, nine million bottles of Jolly Cola were sold, compared to five million bottles of Coca-Cola. This was an incredible number compared to an annual sale of 40 to 50,000 bottles in 1958. Naturally, the sheer interest of the news explains a part of the increased sale, but so does the summer of 1959, which was exceptionally good. Nevertheless, when the market finally stabilised, roughly every fifth sold soft drink in Denmark was a cola, and approximately 40% was Jolly Cola.\n\nJolly Cola maintained this market share until the 1980s.\n[[File:Jolly Cola.JPG|thumb|250px|A photograph of a bottle of Jolly Cola taken in 2010.]]\nThere are several explanations for Jolly Cola\u2019s success. However, the most important one is that \u2018Dansk Coladrik\u2019 could make use of the brewing industry\u2019s comprehensive network, distributing system and knowledge of the Danish market. Another reason is that it was only possible to buy Coca-Cola in Copenhagen and a few larger cities in Jutland in the early years of the hectic \u2018cola war\u2019. Hence, it was not until the 1960s that it was possible to buy Coca-Cola nationwide. This ensured that Jolly Cola was a well-established product in many places when Coca-Cola finally ventured into the market. Thirdly, it was due to great marketing. Dansk Coladrik had tapped their cola in regular soft drink bottles. This made it easier for the retail industry to administer the returnable bottle system, but it also made it possible to launch Jolly Cola as \u201cThe Big Cola\u201d (a slogan that not coincidentally resembled Pepsi\u2019s successful 1930s US slogan for its big 12 ounce bottle). A Danish soft drink bottle contained exactly 25 [[centiliter|cl]], whereas the characteristic \u2018chubby\u2019 Coca-Cola bottle only contained 19 cl. The argument about value for your money was important in a time where a soft drink was considered to be a luxury product. (The story of Jolly Cola is based on the work of Klaus Petersen and Niels Arne S\u00f8rensen from the Institute of History, Culture and Society).\n\n==Today\u2019s Jolly Cola==\nIn the 1980s Jolly Cola still had around 60% of the Danish cola market, but in the 1990s they experienced a decrease in sales. In 1999 the failing sales numbers forced the [[Danish Consumers Cooperative Society]] (Coop amba) to remove Jolly Cola from its shelves. Following this, Jolly Cola only made up 6% of the total Danish soft drink market in 2002, which was again reduced to 2% in 2003.  In the same year, a trial between the brewery Vestfyen and the association of Danish breweries almost compromised Jolly Cola\u2019s existence. Vestfyen believed that the association of Danish breweries would rather market Pepsi Cola at the expense of Jolly Cola. In September 2003, however, Vestfyen took over all stocks dealing with the struggling soft drink so as to engage in a turn-around of the product. This became an immense success, and in 2004 Jolly Cola made up 25% of Coop amba's cola sales.\n\n==Labels==\nJolly\u2019s labels have changed a couple of times during the years. However, what they have in common is a retro design. It is the same look/design which is reappearing in the new logo. \n[[Image:Jolly etiketter.jpg|thumb|Jolly labels through time.]] <br />\nIn the 1980s and 1990s there were [[quiz]]zes, [[crossword puzzle]]s and common [[proverb]]s on the back of Jolly\u2019s labels. \n[[Image:Joy113.jpg|thumb|Jolly music quiz from the 1980s.]]\n[[Image:Joy213.jpg|thumb|Jolly crossword puzzle.]]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.jolly.dk Jolly.dk]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090515030402/http://www.bryggerietvestfyen.dk/skillevej.php Bryggeriet Vestfyen]\n\n{{Colas}}\n\n[[Category:Cola brands]]\n[[Category:Products introduced in 1959]]\n", "text_old": "<!-- Infobox begins -->\n{{Infobox Beverage\n|name         = Jolly Cola\n|image        = <!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Jolly Cola.jpg]] -->\n|type         = Soft drink\n|abv          = \n|proof        = \n|manufacturer = [[Bryggeriet Vestfyen, Assens]] with license from Dansk Coladrik A/S\n|distributor  = \n|origin       = [[Denmark]]\n|introduced   = 1959\n|discontinued = \n|colour       = \n|flavour      = \n|variants     = Jolly&nbsp;Cola, Jolly&nbsp;Light, Jolly&nbsp;Energy&nbsp;Cola, Jolly&nbsp;Time, Jolly&nbsp;Orange\n|related      = \n}}\n<!-- Infobox ends -->\n'''Jolly Cola''' is an original Danish soft drink dating back to 1959.

Since then, greed and hatred has taken over humanity and has been deteriorating it for past 6000 years. To end this, a mystical sect of saints known as \"Suryanshis\" chose a man to rise up against all odds and defeat the evil prevailing within society. He was taught the way to energise the 7 chakras of body through Kundalini Yoga that helped him get mystical and supernatural powers. During his training, he also conducted the ritual of death in order to get total control over his powers by entering the holy fire and immersing his physical body in it. When the five natural elements of life, fire, earth, water, wind and sky invigorated his body, he gains superpowers and becomes a [[Superhuman]]. At last, he takes a pledge to finish corruption and injustice in society and fight the evil prevailing in the world. Due to his heroic initial works, he is named Shaktimaan by a reporter, [[Shaktimaan#Geeta Vishwas|Geeta Vishwas]]. Later, it is revealed that\nShaktimaan was the rebirth of Shri Satya who was part of the Suryanshi Sect during the Mahabharata era 5,000 years ago.\n\nHis alter-ego is a funny geek named Pandit Gangadhar Vidyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri, who works as a photographer in a daily newspaper office to maintain his secret identity as Shaktimaan and speaks pure [[Hindi]].\n\nShaktimaan's nemesis is Tamraj Kilvish, who is the living embodiment of the evil and dark forces of the world.\n\nShaktimaan is another common human being, but reincarnation of Shri Satya, but has got his internal spiritual powers ignited with the continuous and typical practice of [[Hindu Philosophy|Hindu philosophical]] and cultural values system and activities like [[Yoga|Yog Sadhna]] and [[Meditation]]. Also, he follows the morals and ethical values of truth, non-violence, and values stated in books like the [[Bhagavad Gita]].\n\n== Cast ==\nJubi = ?\n* [[Mukesh Khanna]] as Pandit Gangadhar Vidyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri / Shaktimaan, Major Ranjeet Singh (Shaktimaan's Father), Shree Satya (Previous Incarnation of Shaktimaan), Evil Clone Shaktimaan\n* [[Kitu Gidwani]] as Geeta Vishwas (Episode 1-24)\n* [[Vaishnavi Mahant]] as Geeta Vishwas (Episode 25-520)\n* [[Surendra Pal]] as Tamraj Kilvish / Guru Sarvagya\n* [[Tom Alter]] as Mahaguru\n* [[Lalit Parimoo]] as Dr. Jaikaal\n* [[Arun Bakshi]] as Dr. Jaikaal (in last few episodes)\n* Raman Khatri as Sahab / Kumar Ranjan\n* Sharad Smart as Satyaprakash Nirala, the 1st editor of ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''\n* [[Raju Shrivastav]] as Durandhar Singh, the 2nd editor of ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''\n* [[Manjeet Kullar]] as Kaushalya / Maharani Shavalika, Shaktimaan's biological mother\n* [[Ashwini Kalsekar]] as Shalaaka / Kaali Billi\n* [[Dolly Minhas]] as Shaliyaa / Safed Billi, elder sister and guardian of Shalaaka\n* [[Kishore Bhanushali]] as Naurangee the thief\n* [[Rajendra Gupta]] as Prof. Vishwas, paranormal scientist, Geeta Vishwas's father.\n* Jay Mishra as Ghosh Babu\n* [[Nawab Shah (actor)|Nawab Shah]] as Mayor JJ \"Jai Kumar Janardhan\" / Kakodar\n* [[Deepshikha Nagpal]] as Paroma and Sheraali (dual roles)\n* Sunila Karambelkar as Queen Mayaadri and Natasha in starting episodes\n* Brij Mohan Pandey as Bankelal / Toyman\n* Sanjeev Chaddha as Shudhanshu ji\n* Ajit Mehra as Shwami Ji\n* [[Arun Bali]] as Dayal Chopra, Businessman and owner of Aaj Ki Awaz\n* [[Zahida Parveen]] as Nisha Saluja, reporter who replaced Geeta at Aaj Ki Awaz\n* Hemal Dharia as Hemal\n* Sharad Smart as Satya Prakash Nirala\n* Urmila Amar as Leela Lautekar\n*[[Nupur Alankar]] as Kaamini, Film gossip writer at ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''\n* [[Shikha Swaroop]] as Alien (special appearance)\n* [[Goga Kapoor]] as Bilas Rao\n* Zeena Bhatia as Matandeeka Witch\n* [[Deepraj Rana]] as Inspector Jai Singh, a Corrupt Police officer.\n* [[Urvashi Dholakia]] as Maansi Sharma\n* Annu Kashyap as Teemira / Behroopia\n* [[Neelam Mehra]] as Maansi\n* Shravani Goswami as Shalini (Bengali Bahu)\n* Durgesh Nandini as Rachna (Punjabi Bahu)\n* Manav Sohal as Shalini's husband\n\n== Production ==\n''Shaktimaan'' was conceptualised by Khanna in 1981, when he was working on a film with [[Rajshri Productions]]. He narrated the idea to producer Rajkumar Barjatya, who liked it, and the two adapted it into a film titled ''Akash''. In November 1997, ''[[Screen (magazine)|Screen]]'' reported quoted him: \"I would watch my nephew sitting glued to the TV whenever ''Power Zone'' came on, shooting with imaginary [[laser guns]], or operating some imaginary hi-fi gadget in his own little world. That's when it struck me that if I made ''Shaktimaan'' I would have a readymade audience of kids who are always most impressed with [[Special effects|SFX]] tricks.\" Over the development of the titular character, Khanna said, \"In Indian mythology there are a lot of strong characters but no super-heroes. All we get to see are [[Superman]] or [[Spider-Man|Spiderman]], who are alien concepts. That's why I decided to create an Indian super-hero, Shaktimaan, who is born out of a [[yagna]], and a result of all the creative energies of the universe. A superhero who can fly...disappear. And when he is not in his super-hero [[Dual role|avataar]] he's a bumbling photographer who always misses scoop much to the chagrin of his boss Kitu Gidwani.\" He added that the attire of Shaktimaan's alter ego, \"complete with buck teeth and floppy hair\" was inspired by American comedian [[Jerry Lewis]].<ref name=\"screen\">{{cite web |title=Mukesh Khanna: No More Mthologicals |url=http://www.screenindia.com/nov14/tele1.htm |website=Screen |accessdate=14 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031031211440/http://www.screenindia.com/nov14/tele1.htm |archivedate=31 October 2003 |date=November 1997}}</ref>\n\nHaving wanted the \"best ever\" special effects seen on Indian television, following the series' airing, Khanna felt that it \"[fell] short of [his] expectations\". He added, \"When I had planned the serial I wanted the kind of special effects seen in ''Superman'', ''Spiderman'' and ''[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]''. Maybe I was too ambitious. [[Computer graphics]] has just arrived in India and there is lack of trained professionals here.\" He further said, the special effects for each episode costed him {{INR}}2 [[lakh]], and {{INR}}10 lakh overall.<ref name=\"screen\"/>\nIn 2004 Sign language interpretation was launched for the social message given in the end of the episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040201/spectrum/tv.htm|title=The Sunday Tribune - Spectrum - Television|website=www.tribuneindia.com}}</ref>\n\nThe series was sponsored by [[Parle-G]] from its first episode.<ref name=\"screen\"/>\n\nIn 2019, Mukesh Khanna revealed through his YouTube channel that the show had to be cancelled because the high broadcasting charges were bringing him losses, and not due to complaints of children imitating stunts from the show as popularly believed.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.amarujala.com/photo-gallery/entertainment/bollywood/mukesh-khanna-on-shaktimaan-why-this-show-off-air|title=14 \u0938\u093e\u0932 \u092c\u093e\u0926 \u092e\u0941\u0915\u0947\u0936 \u0916\u0928\u094d\u0928\u093e \u0928\u0947 \u092c\u092f\u093e\u0902 \u0915\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0926\u0930\u094d\u0926, \u0907\u0938 \u0935\u091c\u0939 \u0938\u0947 \u092c\u0902\u0926 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u093e \u092a\u0921\u093c\u093e \u0925\u093e '\u0936\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092e\u093e\u0928'|newspaper=[[Amar Ujala]]}}</ref>\n\n\n==Broadcast==\nThe series ran for 450 episodes from 13 September 1997 to 27 March 2005 on [[DD National]].<ref name=\"date\"/> Reruns of the series also aired on   [[STAR Utsav]] and [[Dangal TV]].<ref name=\"archive.org12\">{{cite web|url=http://app.indya.com:80/epg/asp/displaySchedules.asp?ddChannelName=starutsav|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516180410/http://app.indya.com:80/epg/asp/displaySchedules.asp?ddChannelName=starutsav|archivedate=16 May 2009|title=STAR - Programme Guide|date=16 May 2009}}</ref> \n\nRe-edited version of the series premiered on [[Pogo TV]] in 2006, The series was also dubbed in English language for the network.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/screen-on-off/cid/1275205|title=Screen On & Off|website=www.telegraphindia.com}}</ref><ref name=\"archive.org18\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pogo.tv/tvschedule|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218185837/http://www.pogo.tv/tvschedule|archivedate=18 February 2015|title=TV Schedule - POGO!

They are followers of the star ''Sun''. As part of training, he trained with [[Kundalini Yoga]] to awake the 7 chakras of body and gain 'supernatural' powers from them. To gain complete control over his powers he performed the ritual of death. However, this did not cause death but made him more alive than when he was a normal man. He also performed [[Yajna]] in which he entered the fire himself and dissolved his body in fire. Then, the five elements of life, i.e. fire, wind, water, earth, sky revived his body giving him special powers from them. Thus after leaving his mortal body he was given a superhuman form to fight against the evil in the world as Shaktimaan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgrZ2ofIcT8|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 1|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter Shaktimaan was created he set out to destroy his archenemy Kilvish. But, as the Mahaguru ([[Tom Alter]]) explained, Kilvish can only be defeated after evil is destroyed. Shaktimaan's mission is to destroy the sin within people, not the sinned people. Shaktimaan's adventures show him pursuing justice and saving his friends while Kilvish and his minions plot to defeat him.\n\n=== Powers ===\nShaktimaan has superhuman powers which lie inside his body in his seven chakras of [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]] attained through meditation. Shaktimaan worships God through the symbol [[Om]]. Truthfulness is his motto. He can even separate his body into five different bodies of fire, wind, water, earth and sky.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuTDNEmCzB8|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 43|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref> He is an expert, skilled and intelligent fighter and has fought with super-skilled enemies. He possesses physical powers like unlimited speed (up to the speed of light), strength, durability as well as psychic powers like telepathy, teleportation, telekinesis etc.\nAlthough he possesses godlike powers, his only weakness is a crystal (Papmani) possessed by Tamraj Kilvish which can be used to defeat and even kill him. This makes him powerless because it is filled with the evil of the world and is the source of the black powers. But he regains his strength after the crystal is taken away from him. He can be killed if the crystal is placed in front of him and he is treated violently to the verge of death. Shaktimaan also gets brief premonitions about the incidents that are going to happen to him in future. This can be observed in kashtak's episode, Geeta going to jail and in kapala's reappearance episodes.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cuwX6vm8dqw | title = Shaktimaan episode 172}}</ref>\n\nShaktimaan's powers are virtually limitless. He can do practically anything he imagines. The only limit to his powers is his own belief in himself and his knowledge of how to manifest his powers. His powers come from his chakras. (Note: Although we'll call them chakras in the vedas, in the series dialogue they will also be called energy centers.)\n\nThe seven chakras in his body which give him powers are:\n* Energy Chakra (1): This chakra gives Shaktimaan super strength enabling him to fly, shoot fire from his hands, emit rays from his fingertips, blow a stream of freezing air, or send out protective force fields which nothing can penetrate (provided he can maintain his willpower and not give in). Shaktimaan's strength allows him to physically penetrate anything and lift any object.\n* Creative Chakra (2): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to manifest things out of thin air.\n* Astral Chakra (3): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to control his astral body (a semi-transparent, ethereal duplicate of himself) which can fly, walk through walls, see inside objects, etc.\n* Heart Chakra (4): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to control the will of others, but only for good. He can will people to do the right thing, see the error in their ways. This power is most useful when Shaktimaan needs to stop someone who is under the control of Kilvish from doing evil.\n* Vibration Chakra (5): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to control all types of vibrations, including sound waves, light waves, healing warmth, etc. He can also use it to hear ultrasonic sounds, and can speed up the vibrations of his own atoms allowing him to transport himself in space or time. This can be very useful for getting out of dangerous situations.\n* Psychic Chakra (6): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power of the \"third eye\" which enables him to read minds and see anywhere in the world at any distance. He can sense impending danger and see things at any corner of the world.\n\n=== Personal life ===\nTo avoid being an easy prey of Tamraj Kilvish, Shaktimaan adopted an alter ego of Pandit Gangadhar Vidyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri in the society. The character Gangadhar is completely opposite to that of Shaktimaan in all aspects e.g. appearance, intelligence while he speaks pure [[Hindi language|Hindi]]. Whenever he gets any important job to do, he says that he has written a book on it which had never been published. Staying in the society as a common person helped him to get knowledge about crime. He got a job of a photographer for the newspaper ''Aaj Ki Awaaz'' after being interviewed by [[Shaktimaan#Geeta Vishwas|Geeta Vishwas]]. After a few weeks, he became a co-reporter working with Geeta. Through a series of incidents and the fact that he could never capture a photo of Shaktimaan, Geeta came to know about the dual identity of Shaktimaan, which was previously known only to Suryanshis. After ''Aaj Ki Awaaz'' was shut down, Gangadhar became a Hindi professor at a junior college. Later, he left the college to work for a news channel ''KR TV'' with Geeta.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Main characters ===\n\n==== Geeta Vishwas ====\nGeeta Vishwas ([[Vaishnavi Mahant]], previously [[Kitu Gidwani]]), the female lead in the serial, used to work as a brave news reporter in ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''. She was the first to report about Shaktimaan in newspaper and named the superhero as ''Shaktimaan''. Incidentally, she was the only reporter to get interviews of Shaktimaan as Gangadhar used to accompany her as photographer in missions. She died in a crash planned by Dr. Jackal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0r8M4plt9c|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 101|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref> As Shaktimaan loved her, he brought her back to life again using his power which resulted in losing his powers temporarily due to his ''against the nature actions''. Geeta came to know about this after Shaktimaan regained power with the vow that he will never repeat the same mistake again. To ensure this, she planned to leave the country. In the lead up to that situation, she got to know about Shaktimaan's dual character for the third time. But unlike first two occasions, Shaktimaan didn't erase it from Geeta's memory this time as she promised to keep it secret forever.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y8GUm3-UbA|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 109|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nOne year later<sup>\u2021</sup>, after ''Aaj Ki Awaaz'' was shut down, its staff members persuaded Geeta in returning to India to join them to release Shaktimaan comics. Later she teamed up with Gangadhar again and joined ''KR TV''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtPBVkdn6Yc&list|title=shaktimaan 22 12 2010 0002|publisher=YouTube.com |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref> as a television reporter while working for the comics simultaneously.\n\n<sup>\u2021</sup>&nbsp;\u2013 ''When the journalist character Geeta Vishwas was written out of the series, fan protests prompted the producers to bring her back.''<ref name=interview>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/interviews/actor/vaishnavi.htm |title=An Interview with vaishnavi Mahant |publisher=Indiantelevision.com |date=12 October 2001 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Enemies ===\n\n==== Main enemies ====\n; Jackal and Kilvish\nTamraj Kilvish is Shaktimaan's archenemy. Tamraj means King of Darkness (''tama'' = darkness, ''raj'' = king). He has lived 6000 years and is the source of evil in the world. He intends to rule the world by spreading darkness, hatred, sin and evil. It is said that the source of his strength is one-half of the \"Shakti Punj\" (the half which is referred to as \"shaktiman\") which he managed to retain after he originally obtained the entire Shakti Punj by deceit from Shri Satya (Satya means truth), the founder of the Suryavanshi. However, it is also mentioned that the source of his strength is the evil that is committed by people in this world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB9JLeGRUIk|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 70|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nIt was later revealed that only Shri Satya can kill Tamraj Kilvish. After a death-defying adventure, Shaktimaan was told that he is the rebirth of Shri Satya. Shri Satya had given the exact time of the child's birth and the place before he died about 6000 years ago. Tamraj also knows this and this is the main reason he is frightened by the appearance of Shaktimaan as he knows that only Shaktimaan can kill Tamraj. He murdered Shaktimaan's parents and his adoptive father, Pandit Vidyadhar Shastri.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/s/shakti.htm |title=International Hero&nbsp;\u2013 Shaktimaan |accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref> He and his minions plot to kill him but always fail. His minions include Electric-man (who can shoot lightning bolts from his body), Stone-man (who can shoot stones from his body), Plastica (who can stretch any part of her body), Dr. Jackal (an evil scientist) and others. Dr. Jackal has helped Kilvish in his various schemes by cloning Shaktimaan and also by turning aliens against him.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=189133 |newspaper=Indian Express |title=Bad Boys |date=21 June 2006 |author=Tushar Abhichandani |accessdate=23 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919194526/http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=189133 |archivedate=19 September 2006  }}</ref>\n\nIn the television series, Kilvish is often treated as the personification of darkness itself even though he was once a human being who later becomes very powerful and commits many evil deeds. In an attempt to become immortal, he left his mortal body and took an ethereal body which can't be killed but Shaktimaan is told that he has to kill all the evil in the world to destroy Tamraj's ethereal body. Kilvish's trademark quote is \"Andhera Kaayam Rahe\" (May Darkness Prevail), which is also used by his followers.\n\nKilvish's character evolves as the series progresses. In the beginning episodes of Shaktimaan, his face is never shown and his voice is different from the voice that he uses in the later episodes of Shaktimaan, in which his role is played by [[Surendra Pal]]. Later his face deforms to become a distorted wolf-like face.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bakwaasbybiswas.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/kilwis.jpg|title=Bakwaas by Biswas (WordPress blog)|accessdate= 13 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Dr. Jackal\nDr. Jackal is an evil scientist who works for Kilvish. His earlier intention was not that of becoming evil, but when he was denied scholarship for research, Kilvish provided him with funds and labs, thus making him a supporter of Kilvish & an evil scientist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iof2Ce4egp8|title=Shaktimaan Episode&nbsp;\u2013 224|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\nThough he is overall a brilliant scientist, his specialisation is cloning and various energy rays.\nHis creations against Shaktimaan include Kekda Man (a clone formed by fusing cells of Crab & human), followed by Jonk Jonkaa (a clone using leech), an evil clone of Shaktimaan, Plastica,\nLightman, 3D image, Super-heroine Sunanda and others. He also invented a height control solution and fictional EC- rays.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l14zW_E1VzI|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 120|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83uDEE69YlY|title=Shaktimaan Episode&nbsp;\u2013 28|publisher=YouTube.com 3 |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buecO_bwsls|title=Shaktimaan Episode&nbsp;\u2013 301|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-lG6uoeh7E|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 162|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVVTrBXe18s|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 38|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJf6yZZdkes|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 41 |publisher=YouTube.com |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDNhyZ5abCE|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 42 |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Sahab\nSahab is an organised criminal and drug lord. Like Shaktimaan he also possesses double identity, the other being that of a law-abiding industrialist and Mayor, known as Kumar Ranjan. Except for Tamraj Kilvish (and later Dr. Jackal), no one knows that Sahab and Kumar Ranjan are the same person, thus making this his biggest strength. Through his criminal mind, Sahab keeps plotting ways to create trouble for Shaktimaan or to defame him and to find out about the real identity of Shaktimaan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsseb6UtzyA&list|title=shaktimaan 10 1 2011 0002|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Other enemies ====\n; Kakodar\nKakodar is a sorcerer with the visage of a devil who was imprisoned in a statue nearly five hundred years ago. He could only be freed if a good person removes a thread from his neck. It is unclear whether he was cursed by an enemy or punished by Tamraj to end up imprisoned. In the present day, the mayor of Mumbai, Jai Kumar Janardhan a.k.a. JJ (Nawab Shah) was deceived by his personal assistant Mathur (Deepak Bhatia) to break the thread and free him. Mayor JJ died in shock at seeing Kakodar's true form. As instructed by Madhur, Kakodar possessed JJ's body and decided to spread ''Andhera'' (darkness).\n\nHe was the primary super villain in the first part of the series as he uses JJ's wealth and power to hatch plots to kill Shaktimaan but always failed. Unlike most of other assailants of Shaktimaan, he is very sharp and analytical. He even tries to approach Tarendra, an all knowing sentient being of light, to know the truth about Shaktimaan. He is cunning enough to be able to use mental manipulation to trick Shaktimaan on occasion. This put the hero into a dilemma, and self-doubt drained him of his powers temporarily.\n\nThe full extent of his powers is not revealed.

Since then, greed and hatred has taken over humanity and has been deteriorating it for past 6000 years. To end this, a mystical sect of saints known as \"Suryanshis\" chose a man to rise up against all odds and defeat the evil prevailing within society. He was taught the way to energise the 7 chakras of body through Kundalini Yoga that helped him get mystical and supernatural powers. During his training, he also conducted the ritual of death in order to get total control over his powers by entering the holy fire and immersing his physical body in it. When the five natural elements of life, fire, earth, water, wind and sky invigorated his body, he gains superpowers and becomes a [[Superhuman]]. At last, he takes a pledge to finish corruption and injustice in society and fight the evil prevailing in the world. Due to his heroic initial works, he is named Shaktimaan by a reporter, [[Shaktimaan#Geeta Vishwas|Geeta Vishwas]]. Later, it is revealed that\nShaktimaan was the rebirth of Shri Satya who was part of the Suryanshi Sect during the Mahabharata era 5,000 years ago.\n\nHis alter-ego is a funny geek named Pandit Gangadhar Vidyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri, who works as a photographer in a daily newspaper office to maintain his secret identity as Shaktimaan and speaks pure [[Hindi]].\n\nShaktimaan's nemesis is Tamraj Kilvish, who is the living embodiment of the evil and dark forces of the world.\n\nShaktimaan is another common human being, but reincarnation of Shri Satya, but has got his internal spiritual powers ignited with the continuous and typical practice of [[Hindu Philosophy|Hindu philosophical]] and cultural values system and activities like [[Yoga|Yog Sadhna]] and [[Meditation]]. Also, he follows the morals and ethical values of truth, non-violence, and values stated in books like the [[Bhagavad Gita]].\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Mukesh Khanna]] as Pandit Gangadhar Vidyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri / Shaktimaan, Major Ranjeet Singh (Shaktimaan's Father), Shree Satya (Previous Incarnation of Shaktimaan), Evil Clone Shaktimaan\n* [[Kitu Gidwani]] as Geeta Vishwas (Episode 1-24)\n* [[Vaishnavi Mahant]] as Geeta Vishwas (Episode 25-520)\n* [[Surendra Pal]] as Tamraj Kilvish / Guru Sarvagya\n* [[Tom Alter]] as Mahaguru\n* [[Lalit Parimoo]] as Dr. Jaikaal\n* [[Arun Bakshi]] as Dr. Jaikaal (in last few episodes)\n* Raman Khatri as Sahab / Kumar Ranjan\n* Sharad Smart as Satyaprakash Nirala, the 1st editor of ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''\n* [[Raju Shrivastav]] as Durandhar Singh, the 2nd editor of ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''\n* [[Manjeet Kullar]] as Kaushalya / Maharani Shavalika, Shaktimaan's biological mother\n* [[Ashwini Kalsekar]] as Shalaaka / Kaali Billi\n* [[Dolly Minhas]] as Shaliyaa / Safed Billi, elder sister and guardian of Shalaaka\n* [[Kishore Bhanushali]] as Naurangee the thief\n* [[Rajendra Gupta]] as Prof. Vishwas, paranormal scientist, Geeta Vishwas's father.\n* Jay Mishra as Ghosh Babu\n* [[Nawab Shah (actor)|Nawab Shah]] as Mayor JJ \"Jai Kumar Janardhan\" / Kakodar\n* [[Deepshikha Nagpal]] as Paroma and Sheraali (dual roles)\n* Sunila Karambelkar as Queen Mayaadri and Natasha in starting episodes\n* Brij Mohan Pandey as Bankelal / Toyman\n* Sanjeev Chaddha as Shudhanshu ji\n* Ajit Mehra as Shwami Ji\n* [[Arun Bali]] as Dayal Chopra, Businessman and owner of Aaj Ki Awaz\n* [[Zahida Parveen]] as Nisha Saluja, reporter who replaced Geeta at Aaj Ki Awaz\n* Hemal Dharia as Hemal\n* Sharad Smart as Satya Prakash Nirala\n* Urmila Amar as Leela Lautekar\n*[[Nupur Alankar]] as Kaamini, Film gossip writer at ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''\n* [[Shikha Swaroop]] as Alien (special appearance)\n* [[Goga Kapoor]] as Bilas Rao\n* Zeena Bhatia as Matandeeka Witch\n* [[Deepraj Rana]] as Inspector Jai Singh, a Corrupt Police officer.\n* [[Urvashi Dholakia]] as Maansi Sharma\n* Annu Kashyap as Teemira / Behroopia\n* [[Neelam Mehra]] as Maansi\n* Shravani Goswami as Shalini (Bengali Bahu)\n* Durgesh Nandini as Rachna (Punjabi Bahu)\n* Manav Sohal as Shalini's husband\n\n== Production ==\n''Shaktimaan'' was conceptualised by Khanna in 1981, when he was working on a film with [[Rajshri Productions]]. He narrated the idea to producer Rajkumar Barjatya, who liked it, and the two adapted it into a film titled ''Akash''. In November 1997, ''[[Screen (magazine)|Screen]]'' reported quoted him: \"I would watch my nephew sitting glued to the TV whenever ''Power Zone'' came on, shooting with imaginary [[laser guns]], or operating some imaginary hi-fi gadget in his own little world. That's when it struck me that if I made ''Shaktimaan'' I would have a readymade audience of kids who are always most impressed with [[Special effects|SFX]] tricks.\" Over the development of the titular character, Khanna said, \"In Indian mythology there are a lot of strong characters but no super-heroes. All we get to see are [[Superman]] or [[Spider-Man|Spiderman]], who are alien concepts. That's why I decided to create an Indian super-hero, Shaktimaan, who is born out of a [[yagna]], and a result of all the creative energies of the universe. A superhero who can fly...disappear. And when he is not in his super-hero [[Dual role|avataar]] he's a bumbling photographer who always misses scoop much to the chagrin of his boss Kitu Gidwani.\" He added that the attire of Shaktimaan's alter ego, \"complete with buck teeth and floppy hair\" was inspired by American comedian [[Jerry Lewis]].<ref name=\"screen\">{{cite web |title=Mukesh Khanna: No More Mthologicals |url=http://www.screenindia.com/nov14/tele1.htm |website=Screen |accessdate=14 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031031211440/http://www.screenindia.com/nov14/tele1.htm |archivedate=31 October 2003 |date=November 1997}}</ref>\n\nHaving wanted the \"best ever\" special effects seen on Indian television, following the series' airing, Khanna felt that it \"[fell] short of [his] expectations\". He added, \"When I had planned the serial I wanted the kind of special effects seen in ''Superman'', ''Spiderman'' and ''[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]''. Maybe I was too ambitious. [[Computer graphics]] has just arrived in India and there is lack of trained professionals here.\" He further said, the special effects for each episode costed him {{INR}}2 [[lakh]], and {{INR}}10 lakh overall.<ref name=\"screen\"/>\nIn 2004 Sign language interpretation was launched for the social message given in the end of the episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040201/spectrum/tv.htm|title=The Sunday Tribune - Spectrum - Television|website=www.tribuneindia.com}}</ref>\n\nThe series was sponsored by [[Parle-G]] from its first episode.<ref name=\"screen\"/>\n\nIn 2019, Mukesh Khanna revealed through his YouTube channel that the show had to be cancelled because the high broadcasting charges were bringing him losses, and not due to complaints of children imitating stunts from the show as popularly believed.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.amarujala.com/photo-gallery/entertainment/bollywood/mukesh-khanna-on-shaktimaan-why-this-show-off-air|title=14 \u0938\u093e\u0932 \u092c\u093e\u0926 \u092e\u0941\u0915\u0947\u0936 \u0916\u0928\u094d\u0928\u093e \u0928\u0947 \u092c\u092f\u093e\u0902 \u0915\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0926\u0930\u094d\u0926, \u0907\u0938 \u0935\u091c\u0939 \u0938\u0947 \u092c\u0902\u0926 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u093e \u092a\u0921\u093c\u093e \u0925\u093e '\u0936\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092e\u093e\u0928'|newspaper=[[Amar Ujala]]}}</ref>\n\n\n==Broadcast==\nThe series ran for 450 episodes from 13 September 1997 to 27 March 2005 on [[DD National]].<ref name=\"date\"/> Reruns of the series also aired on   [[STAR Utsav]] and [[Dangal TV]].<ref name=\"archive.org12\">{{cite web|url=http://app.indya.com:80/epg/asp/displaySchedules.asp?ddChannelName=starutsav|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516180410/http://app.indya.com:80/epg/asp/displaySchedules.asp?ddChannelName=starutsav|archivedate=16 May 2009|title=STAR - Programme Guide|date=16 May 2009}}</ref> \n\nRe-edited version of the series premiered on [[Pogo TV]] in 2006, The series was also dubbed in English language for the network.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/screen-on-off/cid/1275205|title=Screen On & Off|website=www.telegraphindia.com}}</ref><ref name=\"archive.org18\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pogo.tv/tvschedule|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218185837/http://www.pogo.tv/tvschedule|archivedate=18 February 2015|title=TV Schedule - POGO!

They are followers of the star ''Sun''. As part of training, he trained with [[Kundalini Yoga]] to awake the 7 chakras of body and gain 'supernatural' powers from them. To gain complete control over his powers he performed the ritual of death. However, this did not cause death but made him more alive than when he was a normal man. He also performed [[Yajna]] in which he entered the fire himself and dissolved his body in fire. Then, the five elements of life, i.e. fire, wind, water, earth, sky revived his body giving him special powers from them. Thus after leaving his mortal body he was given a superhuman form to fight against the evil in the world as Shaktimaan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgrZ2ofIcT8|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 1|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter Shaktimaan was created he set out to destroy his archenemy Kilvish. But, as the Mahaguru ([[Tom Alter]]) explained, Kilvish can only be defeated after evil is destroyed. Shaktimaan's mission is to destroy the sin within people, not the sinned people. Shaktimaan's adventures show him pursuing justice and saving his friends while Kilvish and his minions plot to defeat him.\n\n=== Powers ===\nShaktimaan has superhuman powers which lie inside his body in his seven chakras of [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]] attained through meditation. Shaktimaan worships God through the symbol [[Om]]. Truthfulness is his motto. He can even separate his body into five different bodies of fire, wind, water, earth and sky.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuTDNEmCzB8|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 43|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref> He is an expert, skilled and intelligent fighter and has fought with super-skilled enemies. He possesses physical powers like unlimited speed (up to the speed of light), strength, durability as well as psychic powers like telepathy, teleportation, telekinesis etc.\nAlthough he possesses godlike powers, his only weakness is a crystal (Papmani) possessed by Tamraj Kilvish which can be used to defeat and even kill him. This makes him powerless because it is filled with the evil of the world and is the source of the black powers. But he regains his strength after the crystal is taken away from him. He can be killed if the crystal is placed in front of him and he is treated violently to the verge of death. Shaktimaan also gets brief premonitions about the incidents that are going to happen to him in future. This can be observed in kashtak's episode, Geeta going to jail and in kapala's reappearance episodes.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cuwX6vm8dqw | title = Shaktimaan episode 172}}</ref>\n\nShaktimaan's powers are virtually limitless. He can do practically anything he imagines. The only limit to his powers is his own belief in himself and his knowledge of how to manifest his powers. His powers come from his chakras. (Note: Although we'll call them chakras in the vedas, in the series dialogue they will also be called energy centers.)\n\nThe seven chakras in his body which give him powers are:\n* Energy Chakra (1): This chakra gives Shaktimaan super strength enabling him to fly, shoot fire from his hands, emit rays from his fingertips, blow a stream of freezing air, or send out protective force fields which nothing can penetrate (provided he can maintain his willpower and not give in). Shaktimaan's strength allows him to physically penetrate anything and lift any object.\n* Creative Chakra (2): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to manifest things out of thin air.\n* Astral Chakra (3): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to control his astral body (a semi-transparent, ethereal duplicate of himself) which can fly, walk through walls, see inside objects, etc.\n* Heart Chakra (4): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to control the will of others, but only for good. He can will people to do the right thing, see the error in their ways. This power is most useful when Shaktimaan needs to stop someone who is under the control of Kilvish from doing evil.\n* Vibration Chakra (5): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to control all types of vibrations, including sound waves, light waves, healing warmth, etc. He can also use it to hear ultrasonic sounds, and can speed up the vibrations of his own atoms allowing him to transport himself in space or time. This can be very useful for getting out of dangerous situations.\n* Psychic Chakra (6): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power of the \"third eye\" which enables him to read minds and see anywhere in the world at any distance. He can sense impending danger and see things at any corner of the world.\n\n=== Personal life ===\nTo avoid being an easy prey of Tamraj Kilvish, Shaktimaan adopted an alter ego of Pandit Gangadhar Vidyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri in the society. The character Gangadhar is completely opposite to that of Shaktimaan in all aspects e.g. appearance, intelligence while he speaks pure [[Hindi language|Hindi]]. Whenever he gets any important job to do, he says that he has written a book on it which had never been published. Staying in the society as a common person helped him to get knowledge about crime. He got a job of a photographer for the newspaper ''Aaj Ki Awaaz'' after being interviewed by [[Shaktimaan#Geeta Vishwas|Geeta Vishwas]]. After a few weeks, he became a co-reporter working with Geeta. Through a series of incidents and the fact that he could never capture a photo of Shaktimaan, Geeta came to know about the dual identity of Shaktimaan, which was previously known only to Suryanshis. After ''Aaj Ki Awaaz'' was shut down, Gangadhar became a Hindi professor at a junior college. Later, he left the college to work for a news channel ''KR TV'' with Geeta.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Main characters ===\n\n==== Geeta Vishwas ====\nGeeta Vishwas ([[Vaishnavi Mahant]], previously [[Kitu Gidwani]]), the female lead in the serial, used to work as a brave news reporter in ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''. She was the first to report about Shaktimaan in newspaper and named the superhero as ''Shaktimaan''. Incidentally, she was the only reporter to get interviews of Shaktimaan as Gangadhar used to accompany her as photographer in missions.

Geeta came to know about this after Shaktimaan regained power with the vow that he will never repeat the same mistake again. To ensure this, she planned to leave the country. In the lead up to that situation, she got to know about Shaktimaan's dual character for the third time. But unlike first two occasions, Shaktimaan didn't erase it from Geeta's memory this time as she promised to keep it secret forever.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y8GUm3-UbA|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 109|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nOne year later<sup>\u2021</sup>, after ''Aaj Ki Awaaz'' was shut down, its staff members persuaded Geeta in returning to India to join them to release Shaktimaan comics.

Tamraj means King of Darkness (''tama'' = darkness, ''raj'' = king). He has lived 6000 years and is the source of evil in the world. He intends to rule the world by spreading darkness, hatred, sin and evil. It is said that the source of his strength is one-half of the \"Shakti Punj\" (the half which is referred to as \"shaktiman\") which he managed to retain after he originally obtained the entire Shakti Punj by deceit from Shri Satya (Satya means truth), the founder of the Suryavanshi. However, it is also mentioned that the source of his strength is the evil that is committed by people in this world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB9JLeGRUIk|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 70|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nIt was later revealed that only Shri Satya can kill Tamraj Kilvish. After a death-defying adventure, Shaktimaan was told that he is the rebirth of Shri Satya. Shri Satya had given the exact time of the child's birth and the place before he died about 6000 years ago. Tamraj also knows this and this is the main reason he is frightened by the appearance of Shaktimaan as he knows that only Shaktimaan can kill Tamraj. He murdered Shaktimaan's parents and his adoptive father, Pandit Vidyadhar Shastri.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/s/shakti.htm |title=International Hero&nbsp;\u2013 Shaktimaan |accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref> He and his minions plot to kill him but always fail. His minions include Electric-man (who can shoot lightning bolts from his body), Stone-man (who can shoot stones from his body), Plastica (who can stretch any part of her body), Dr. Jackal (an evil scientist) and others. Dr. Jackal has helped Kilvish in his various schemes by cloning Shaktimaan and also by turning aliens against him.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=189133 |newspaper=Indian Express |title=Bad Boys |date=21 June 2006 |author=Tushar Abhichandani |accessdate=23 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919194526/http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=189133 |archivedate=19 September 2006  }}</ref>\n\nIn the television series, Kilvish is often treated as the personification of darkness itself even though he was once a human being who later becomes very powerful and commits many evil deeds. In an attempt to become immortal, he left his mortal body and took an ethereal body which can't be killed but Shaktimaan is told that he has to kill all the evil in the world to destroy Tamraj's ethereal body. Kilvish's trademark quote is \"Andhera Kaayam Rahe\" (May Darkness Prevail), which is also used by his followers.\n\nKilvish's character evolves as the series progresses. In the beginning episodes of Shaktimaan, his face is never shown and his voice is different from the voice that he uses in the later episodes of Shaktimaan, in which his role is played by [[Surendra Pal]]. Later his face deforms to become a distorted wolf-like face.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bakwaasbybiswas.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/kilwis.jpg|title=Bakwaas by Biswas (WordPress blog)|accessdate= 13 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Dr. Jackal\nDr. Jackal is an evil scientist who works for Kilvish. His earlier intention was not that of becoming evil, but when he was denied scholarship for research, Kilvish provided him with funds and labs, thus making him a supporter of Kilvish & an evil scientist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iof2Ce4egp8|title=Shaktimaan Episode&nbsp;\u2013 224|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\nThough he is overall a brilliant scientist, his specialisation is cloning and various energy rays.\nHis creations against Shaktimaan include Kekda Man (a clone formed by fusing cells of Crab & human), followed by Jonk Jonkaa (a clone using leech), an evil clone of Shaktimaan, Plastica,\nLightman, 3D image, Super-heroine Sunanda and others.

Like Shaktimaan he also possesses double identity, the other being that of a law-abiding industrialist and Mayor, known as Kumar Ranjan. Except for Tamraj Kilvish (and later Dr. Jackal), no one knows that Sahab and Kumar Ranjan are the same person, thus making this his biggest strength. Through his criminal mind, Sahab keeps plotting ways to create trouble for Shaktimaan or to defame him and to find out about the real identity of Shaktimaan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsseb6UtzyA&list|title=shaktimaan 10 1 2011 0002|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Other enemies ====\n; Kakodar\nKakodar is a sorcerer with the visage of a devil who was imprisoned in a statue nearly five hundred years ago. He could only be freed if a good person removes a thread from his neck. It is unclear whether he was cursed by an enemy or punished by Tamraj to end up imprisoned. In the present day, the mayor of Mumbai, Jai Kumar Janardhan a.k.a. JJ (Nawab Shah) was deceived by his personal assistant Mathur (Deepak Bhatia) to break the thread and free him. Mayor JJ died in shock at seeing Kakodar's true form. As instructed by Madhur, Kakodar possessed JJ's body and decided to spread ''Andhera'' (darkness).\n\nHe was the primary super villain in the first part of the series as he uses JJ's wealth and power to hatch plots to kill Shaktimaan but always failed. Unlike most of other assailants of Shaktimaan, he is very sharp and analytical. He even tries to approach Tarendra, an all knowing sentient being of light, to know the truth about Shaktimaan. He is cunning enough to be able to use mental manipulation to trick Shaktimaan on occasion. This put the hero into a dilemma, and self-doubt drained him of his powers temporarily.\n\nThe full extent of his powers is not revealed. On an occasion, JJ's girlfriend Zuby realises that JJ is possessed by a demon and tries to reveal him in public. He uses hypnosis to drive her mad so that the public will ignore her statements. He has a potent and fatal poison inside him that he can spit out of his mouth which affects everyone except Shaktimaan. Shaktimaan and Kakodar end things in a fight when Kakodar turns into his real form and Shaktimaan turns him back to a statue.\n\n; Natasha\nNatasha (Sunila) was also a demonic evil woman sent by Kilvish. Along with Mathur she serves JJ/Kakodar. She was JJ's secretary before he was possessed. She has the ability to change her appearance. She kills a C.B.I. officer and takes her appearance to interrogate Gangadhar and Geeta on one occasion. Her powers were greatly diminished due to Shaktimaan defeating Kakodar. To regain power she and Madhur decide to sacrifice Shaktimaan. For this they kidnap the son of a scientist to get the formula of ''invisible man'' which may help defeating Shaktimaan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dHANSmJg6A|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 24 |publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Madhur\nMadhur (Deepak Bhatia) is one of the two trusted demonic accomplices of JJ/Kakodar along with Natasha. He initially served JJ as his personal assistant (PA) before he was possessed, but was secretly preparing the stage for Kakodar's entry under Tamraj's directions. His true identity is revealed after Kakodar is released from his imprisonment. Not many of his powers are revealed in the series. He has the ability to change his appearance at will, but not shape shift to assume someone else's body. He also loses his powers when Kakodar was defeated by Shaktimaan.\n\n; Electric-man\nHe was the first synthetic villain faced by Shaktimaan. Dr. Chandola, an evil scientist, created him. Dr. Chandola claims that Electric man was his son, whom he killed so that he can resurrect the dead body with electricity. When he comes to life he kills Dr. Chandola. Without recognising friend from foe he kills everyone in his path and spreads destruction in the city. His powers include shooting electricity from eyes and electrocution on contact. Finding him difficult to restrain, Shaktimaan grabs him and tunnels deep into the earth, pushing him deep underground.\n\n; Kapala\nKapala is a corrupted tantrik who serves Tamraj Kilvish. His primary skill is his shape shifting to inanimate objects such as vehicles and weapons. He also has many other magical devices and servants under his control. One such device is metal plate he wears around his neck that has the power to steal his opponent's strength. The villain Stone man was created from his magic skull. Shaktimaan destroys both the metal plate and the magic skull. He has an odd sense of humor as he makes jokes while fighting Shaktimaan. There are occasions where he serves as a comic relief. This is in contrast to other villains who are stark and serious. He also has a very fragile ego and falls victim to taunts. His main accessory is a trident. Shaktimaan eventually turns him into stone and shatters him at one instance. However, in later episodes of Shaktimaan, he is shown resurrected back to life. He is played by Faqira.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41PAj7P6qKk&list|title=shaktimaan 28 12 2010 0003|publisher=YouTube.com |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUChETYxkQo|title=shaktimaan 8 12 2010 0001 |publisher=YouTube.com |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Khali-Bali\nKhali and Bali are two dwarvish green and red imps. Their names originate from the Urdu word Khalbali which means commotion. Throughout their appearances they constantly argue and reconcile with each other over inane reasons. They claim to eat humans but there is no evidence regarding the same. They can combine to form a single full size demon. This demon wears a green and red garb. Their power is insignificant when they are separated but when they both combine they become as physically strong as a full-fledged demon. Not much is shown regarding any psychic powers they possess.\n\n; Kashtak\nDuring an archaeological dig in the ''qila''(fort) at Bhangdu Khati, the lead archaeologist Prof. Hussain and his assistant Hema discover a sarcophagus and a mysteriously untarnished sword made out of an unknown metal in the ruins. Hema accidentally opens the sarcophagus and unleashes Kashtak, a servant of Tamraj Kilvish. Kashtak used to terrorise the world and was imprisoned nearly 2500 years ago by the curse of Komalatha, a lady sage. [[Shaktimaan#Geeta Vishwas|Geeta Vishwas]] turns out to be the reincarnation of Komalatha. His sword ''Khadgi'' has many powers imbued in them such as telekinesis, petrification and resurrection and control of his army. In the series it is enhanced with the power of mind control by Tamraj. When he controls the mind of a scientist to create a weapon of mass destruction, Shaktimaan stops him .<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVda1QKR54s|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 30|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Kekda Man\nKekda man (Crab man) is one of the two dangerous clones of Dr. Jackal (along with Jonk Jonkaa).

Also kidnaps Mr. Subkar and Sheena and tells its done by Shaktimaan and an arrest comes out for Shaktimaan, but Mr. Subkar and Sheena brings the truth by showing the real face of Kumar Ranjan.\n\n; Dr. Shishir\nHe is a really powerful Suryanshi or even one of the most powerful Suryanshis, he possesses telekinetic power and can bring anyone to himself and even no one can move if he catches them. He lives with Sanjeev Mahashay at the secret places of Suryanshis in the city and even runs a hospital. He has also helped Shaktimaan many times in defeating Tamraj Kilvish's armies.\n\n; Vivek/Andhi and Abhimanyu\nHe is a really powerful Suryanshi he has the power of wind and it comes out from his eyes. He lives with Sanjeev Mahashay at the secret places of Suryanshis in the city and even runs a hospital. One blow from his mouth throws the person wherever he wants. He is later killed by Tamraj Kilvish but his brother Abhimanuv has same powers. He joins them and fills his place and also helped Shaktimaan many times in defeating Tamraj Kilvish's armies.\n\n; Abhinav/Vidyut\nHe is a really powerful Suryanshi he has the power of fire and fire rays comes out from his eyes. He lives with Sanjeev Mahashay at the secret places of Suryanshis in the city and even runs a hospital. He has also helped Shaktimaan many times in defeating Tamraj Kilvish's armies. He is also rarely shown using 'Murli-Magic', to ensnare his gurus to act upon his will.\n\n; Sanjeev Mahashay\nThe Chief head of all the Suryanshis places in the city. He first met Shaktimaan as Gangadhar when he lost his memory. He is a genius and is very powerful, with the help of his brain power he can break anything and even kill anyone. He has the power of Earth and his voice reaches till the end of the earth wherever he want he is the head of a hospital.\n\n; Jwaala and Euroo\nThey are aliens from Sudoku planet. They landed on earth to save their lives from the three evil aliens who wants to destroy everything. Later Dr. Jackal kidnaps them, to use their powers for darkness (''andhera'').\n\n; Kamini\nNupur Alankaar plays the role of Kaamini, a flirty, filmy gossip writer in the newspaper ''Aaj ki Aawaz''. She often attempts to flirt with Gangaadhar and fires taunts at Geeta.\n\n; Shailaa\nToyman is like a friend for Shailaa. But Toyman loves her. After using poisonous colours in toys many children die. As a result, Toyman is sent to jail. Shailaa begins hating him and never wants to see his ugly face again. She is later married to a new man. When Toyman discovers this, he finds her and kills her along with her whole family.\n\n; Shalu\nShalu is a small-time thief turned fan of Shaktimaan. Her accomplice is Tilly, another crook. She is someone who has lost faith in the system and adopted a life of crime. However her adoration for Shaktimaan starts cultivating good thoughts in her. She has a tomboy personality and is courageous enough to take on multiple goons. She has a moderate skill in hand-to-hand combat.\n\n== Reception ==\nWhen ''Shaktimaan''  aired on Doordarshan, there were a lot of controversies created as children set themselves on fire or jumped off buildings hoping that Shaktimaan would save them.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/Storyold/81040/ |newspaper=Indian Express |title=The Shaktimaan effect |date=22 February 1999 |accessdate=22 October 2011}}</ref> In an effort to promote responsible behaviour among children, Mukesh Khanna spent a substantial part of the airtime in explaining to the children that the stunts shown on television were not real and should not be emulated.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/section/entertainment/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121100707/http://www.screenindia.com/old/20000922/tclos.htm|url-status=dead|title=Entertainment News: Latest Hollywood & Bollywood News, Movies Releases & Reviews|archivedate=21 January 2010|website=The Indian Express}}</ref> Khanna also stated that most of the controversies were fake and were raised in media to undermine its popularity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cscsarchive.org:8081/MediaArchive/essays.nsf/%28docid%29/9C256C945E192F326525693F00383C61 |publisher=The New India Express |title='Shaktimaan' deaths instigated:Producer |date=9 January 1999 |accessdate=22 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405022402/http://www.cscsarchive.org:8081/MediaArchive/essays.nsf/(docid)/9C256C945E192F326525693F00383C61 |archivedate=5 April 2012  }}</ref>\n\n''Shaktimaan'' was one of the most popular and longest-running television series for Indian children on the Doordarshan channel.<ref>[http://box4.chakpak.com:9080/articles/?p=18802] {{dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref> In an interview with Nupur Rekhi of indiantelevision.com, Khanna told that, he has even received letters from the external affairs minister and then [[Prime Minister of India]] [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] saying that he has done a very good thing in choosing the role of Shaktimaan and keeping up with it.

Rodent control in and around the home remains the primary prevention strategy.\n\n== Virology ==\n\n=== Classification ===\nHantaviruses are bunyaviruses. The order ''[[Bunyavirales]]'' is divided into twelve families. Like all members of this order (except for the Arenaviridae), hantaviruses have [[genome]]s comprising three [[negative-sense]], single-stranded RNA segments, and so are classified as negative sense [[RNA virus]]es. Members of other ''Bunyavirales'' families are generally [[arthropod]]-borne viruses,<ref name=\"doi10.1099/0022-1317-77-11-2677\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Plyusnin A, Vapalahti O, Vaheri A | title = Hantaviruses: genome structure, expression and evolution | journal = J.

The S RNA encodes the [[nucleocapsid]] (N) protein. The M RNA encodes a [[polyprotein]] that is cotranslationally cleaved to yield the envelope [[glycoprotein]]s Gn (formerly G1) and Gc (formerly G2).<ref name=\"doi10.1099/0022-1317-77-11-2677\"/><ref name=\"doi10.1128/CMR.00062-09\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Jonsson CB, Figueiredo LT, Vapalahti O | title = A Global Perspective on Hantavirus Ecology, Epidemiology, and Disease | journal = Clinical Microbiology Reviews | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 412\u2013441 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20375360 | pmc = 2863364 | doi = 10.1128/CMR.00062-09 }}</ref>\n\nThe L RNA encodes the L protein, which functions as the viral transcriptase/replicase. Within [[virion]]s, the genomic RNAs of hantaviruses are thought to complex with the N protein to form helical nucleocapsids, the RNA component of which circularizes due to sequence complementarity between the 5' and 3' terminal sequences of genomic segments.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAs with other ''Bunyavirales'', each of the three segments has a consensus 3'-terminal [[nucleotide]] sequence (AUCAUCAUC), which is complementary to the 5'-terminal sequence and is distinct from those of the other four genera in the family.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Elliott RM | title = Molecular biology of the Bunyaviridae | journal = The Journal of General Virology | volume = 71 | issue = 3 | pages = 501\u2013522 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2179464 | doi = 10.1099/0022-1317-71-3-501 }}</ref> These sequences appear to form panhandle structure which seem likely to play a role in replication and [[encapsidation]] facilitated by binding with the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mir MA, Panganiban AT | title = The Hantavirus Nucleocapsid Protein Recognizes Specific Features of the Viral RNA Panhandle and is Altered in Conformation upon RNA Binding | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 79 | issue = 3 | pages = 1824\u20131835 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15650206 | pmc = 544099 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.79.3.1824-1835.2005 }}</ref> The large segment is 6530\u20136550 nucleotides (nt) in length, the medium is 3613\u20133707 nt in length and the small is 1696\u20132083 nt in length.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nNo nonstructural proteins are known, unlike the other genera in this family. At the 5' and 3' of each segment are short noncoding sequences: the noncoding segment in all sequences at the 5' end is 37\u201351 nt. The 3' noncoding regions differ: L segment 38\u201343 nt; M segment 168\u2013229 nt; and S segment 370\u2013730 nt. The 3' end of the S segment is conserved between the genera suggesting a functional role.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Virions===\nHantavirus virions are about 120\u2013160 [[nanometer]]s (nm) in diameter. The lipid bilayer of the [[viral envelope]] is about 5 nm thick and is embedded with viral surface proteins to which sugar residues are attached. These glycoproteins, known as Gn and Gc, are encoded by the M segment of the viral genome. They tend to associate ([[Dimer (chemistry)|heterodimerize]]) with each other and have both an interior tail and an exterior domain that extends to about 6 nm beyond the envelope surface.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nInside the envelope are the nucleocapsids. These are composed of many copies of the nucleocapsid protein N, which interact with the three segments of the viral genome to form helical structures. The virally encoded [[RNA polymerase]] is also found in the interior. By mass, the virion is greater than 50% protein, 20\u201330% lipid and 2\u20137% carbohydrate. The density of the virions is 1.18&nbsp;gram per cubic centimeter. These features are common to all members of the ''Hantaviridae'' family.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Life cycle===\nEntry into host cells is thought to occur by attachment of virions to cellular receptors and subsequent [[endocytosis]]. Nucleocapsids are introduced into the cytoplasm by pH-dependent fusion of the virion with the [[endosomal membrane]]. After the release of the nucleocapsids into cytoplasm, the complexes are targeted to the ER\u2013Golgi Intermediate compartments (ERGIC) through [[microtubule|microtubular]]-associated movement resulting in the formation of viral factories at ERGIC.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThese factories then facilitate transcription and subsequent translation of the viral proteins. Transcription of viral genes must be initiated by association of the L protein with the three nucleocapsid species. In addition to transcriptase and replicase functions, the viral L protein is also thought to have an endonuclease activity that cleaves cellular messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for the production of capped primers used to initiate transcription of viral mRNAs.

While the primary site of viral replication in the body is not known, in HFRS the main effect is in the blood vessels while in HPS most symptoms are associated with the lungs. In HFRS, there are increased vascular permeability and decreased blood pressure due to endothelial dysfunction and the most dramatic damage is seen in the kidneys, whereas in HPS, the lungs, spleen, and gall bladder are most affected. Early symptoms of HPS tend to present similarly to the flu (muscle aches, fever and fatigue) and usually appear around 2 to 3 weeks after exposure. Later stages of the disease (about 4 to 10 days after symptoms start) include difficulty breathing, shortness of breath and coughing.<ref name=CLA>{{cite web |title=Hantavirus: Canadian Lung Association  |publisher=Canadian Lung Association  |date=26 November 2015  |url=https://www.lung.ca/lung-health/lung-disease/hantavirus  |accessdate=23 April 2018  |url-status=live  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302114405/http://www.lung.ca/diseases-maladies/a-z/hantavirus-hantavirus/index_e.php  |archivedate=2 March 2011  }}</ref>\n\n=== Transmission ===\nThe viruses that cause hantavirus hemorrhagic fever have not been shown to transfer from person to person, except for [[Andes virus]].<ref name=\"Martinez2005\" /> For other species of hantavirus, aerosolized rodent excreta or rodent bites are the only known routes of transmission to humans.

into account the inconsistencies in the theory of coevolution, it was proposed in 2009 that the patterns seen in hantaviruses in relation to their reservoirs could be attributed to preferential host switching directed by geographical proximity and adaptation to specific host types.<ref name=\"doi10.1093/molbev/msn234\"/> Another proposal from 2010 is that geographical clustering of hantavirus sequences may have been caused by an isolation-by-distance mechanism.<ref name=\"doi10.1128/Jvi.01226-09\"/> Upon comparison of the hantaviruses found in hosts of orders [[Rodent]]ia and [[Soricomorpha]], it was proposed in 2011 that the hantavirus evolutionary history is a mix of both host switching and codivergence and that ancestral shrews or moles, rather than rodents, may have

These subsequently spread to [[Africa]], [[Europe]], North America and [[Siberia]] possibly carried by their hosts.

Rodent control in and around the home remains the primary prevention strategy.\n\n== Virology ==\n\n=== Classification ===\nHantaviruses are bunyaviruses. The order ''[[Bunyavirales]]'' is divided into twelve families. Like all members of this order (except for the Arenaviridae), hantaviruses have [[genome]]s comprising three [[negative-sense]], single-stranded RNA segments, and so are classified as negative sense [[RNA virus]]es. Members of other ''Bunyavirales'' families are generally [[arthropod]]-borne viruses,<ref name=\"doi10.1099/0022-1317-77-11-2677\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Plyusnin A, Vapalahti O, Vaheri A | title = Hantaviruses: genome structure, expression and evolution | journal = J.

The S RNA encodes the [[nucleocapsid]] (N) protein. The M RNA encodes a [[polyprotein]] that is cotranslationally cleaved to yield the envelope [[glycoprotein]]s Gn (formerly G1) and Gc (formerly G2).<ref name=\"doi10.1099/0022-1317-77-11-2677\"/><ref name=\"doi10.1128/CMR.00062-09\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Jonsson CB, Figueiredo LT, Vapalahti O | title = A Global Perspective on Hantavirus Ecology, Epidemiology, and Disease | journal = Clinical Microbiology Reviews | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 412\u2013441 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20375360 | pmc = 2863364 | doi = 10.1128/CMR.00062-09 }}</ref>\n\nThe L RNA encodes the L protein, which functions as the viral transcriptase/replicase. Within [[virion]]s, the genomic RNAs of hantaviruses are thought to complex with the N protein to form helical nucleocapsids, the RNA component of which circularizes due to sequence complementarity between the 5' and 3' terminal sequences of genomic segments.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAs with other ''Bunyavirales'', each of the three segments has a consensus 3'-terminal [[nucleotide]] sequence (AUCAUCAUC), which is complementary to the 5'-terminal sequence and is distinct from those of the other four genera in the family.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Elliott RM | title = Molecular biology of the Bunyaviridae | journal = The Journal of General Virology | volume = 71 | issue = 3 | pages = 501\u2013522 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2179464 | doi = 10.1099/0022-1317-71-3-501 }}</ref> These sequences appear to form panhandle structure which seem likely to play a role in replication and [[encapsidation]] facilitated by binding with the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mir MA, Panganiban AT | title = The Hantavirus Nucleocapsid Protein Recognizes Specific Features of the Viral RNA Panhandle and is Altered in Conformation upon RNA Binding | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 79 | issue = 3 | pages = 1824\u20131835 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15650206 | pmc = 544099 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.79.3.1824-1835.2005 }}</ref> The large segment is 6530\u20136550 nucleotides (nt) in length, the medium is 3613\u20133707 nt in length and the small is 1696\u20132083 nt in length.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nNo nonstructural proteins are known, unlike the other genera in this family. At the 5' and 3' of each segment are short noncoding sequences: the noncoding segment in all sequences at the 5' end is 37\u201351 nt. The 3' noncoding regions differ: L segment 38\u201343 nt; M segment 168\u2013229 nt; and S segment 370\u2013730 nt. The 3' end of the S segment is conserved between the genera suggesting a functional role.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Virions===\nHantavirus virions are about 120\u2013160 [[nanometer]]s (nm) in diameter. The lipid bilayer of the [[viral envelope]] is about 5 nm thick and is embedded with viral surface proteins to which sugar residues are attached. These glycoproteins, known as Gn and Gc, are encoded by the M segment of the viral genome. They tend to associate ([[Dimer (chemistry)|heterodimerize]]) with each other and have both an interior tail and an exterior domain that extends to about 6 nm beyond the envelope surface.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nInside the envelope are the nucleocapsids. These are composed of many copies of the nucleocapsid protein N, which interact with the three segments of the viral genome to form helical structures. The virally encoded [[RNA polymerase]] is also found in the interior. By mass, the virion is greater than 50% protein, 20\u201330% lipid and 2\u20137% carbohydrate. The density of the virions is 1.18&nbsp;gram per cubic centimeter. These features are common to all members of the ''Hantaviridae'' family.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Life cycle===\nEntry into host cells is thought to occur by attachment of virions to cellular receptors and subsequent [[endocytosis]]. Nucleocapsids are introduced into the cytoplasm by pH-dependent fusion of the virion with the [[endosomal membrane]]. After the release of the nucleocapsids into cytoplasm, the complexes are targeted to the ER\u2013Golgi Intermediate compartments (ERGIC) through [[microtubule|microtubular]]-associated movement resulting in the formation of viral factories at ERGIC.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThese factories then facilitate transcription and subsequent translation of the viral proteins. Transcription of viral genes must be initiated by association of the L protein with the three nucleocapsid species. In addition to transcriptase and replicase functions, the viral L protein is also thought to have an endonuclease activity that cleaves cellular messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for the production of capped primers used to initiate transcription of viral mRNAs. As a result of this [[cap snatching]], the mRNAs of hantaviruses are capped and contain nontemplated 5'-terminal extensions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Garcin|first=D.|last2=Lezzi|first2=M.|last3=Dobbs|first3=M.|last4=Elliott|first4=R.

The L protein produces nascent genomes by replication via a positive-sense RNA intermediate. Hantavirus virions are believed to assemble by association of nucleocapsids with glycoproteins embedded in the membranes of the Golgi, followed by budding into the [[Golgi cisternae]]. Nascent virions are then transported in secretory [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] to the [[plasma membrane]] and released by [[exocytosis]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n=== Pathogenesis ===\nThe pathogenesis of hantavirus infections is unclear as there is a lack of animal models to describe it (rats and mice do not seem to acquire severe disease). While the primary site of viral replication in the body is not known, in HFRS the main effect is in the blood vessels while in HPS most symptoms are associated with the lungs. In HFRS, there are increased vascular permeability and decreased blood pressure due to endothelial dysfunction and the most dramatic damage is seen in the kidneys, whereas in HPS, the lungs, spleen, and gall bladder are most affected. Early symptoms of HPS tend to present similarly to the flu (muscle aches, fever and fatigue) and usually appear around 2 to 3 weeks after exposure. Later stages of the disease (about 4 to 10 days after symptoms start) include difficulty breathing, shortness of breath and coughing.<ref name=CLA>{{cite web |title=Hantavirus: Canadian Lung Association  |publisher=Canadian Lung Association  |date=26 November 2015  |url=https://www.lung.ca/lung-health/lung-disease/hantavirus  |accessdate=23 April 2018  |url-status=live  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302114405/http://www.lung.ca/diseases-maladies/a-z/hantavirus-hantavirus/index_e.php  |archivedate=2 March 2011  }}</ref>\n\n=== Transmission ===\nThe viruses that cause hantavirus hemorrhagic fever have not been shown to transfer from person to person, except for [[Andes virus]].<ref name=\"Martinez2005\" /> For other species of hantavirus, aerosolized rodent excreta or rodent bites are the only known routes of transmission to humans.

into account the inconsistencies in the theory of coevolution, it was proposed in 2009 that the patterns seen in hantaviruses in relation to their reservoirs could be attributed to preferential host switching directed by geographical proximity and adaptation to specific host types.<ref name=\"doi10.1093/molbev/msn234\"/> Another proposal from 2010 is that geographical clustering of hantavirus sequences may have been caused by an isolation-by-distance mechanism.<ref name=\"doi10.1128/Jvi.01226-09\"/> Upon comparison of the hantaviruses found in hosts of orders [[Rodent]]ia and [[Soricomorpha]], it was proposed in 2011 that the hantavirus evolutionary history is a mix of both host switching and codivergence and that ancestral shrews or moles, rather than rodents, may have

These subsequently spread to [[Africa]], [[Europe]], North America and [[Siberia]] possibly carried by their hosts.

A Roman governor who had done that could have faced execution himself.\n\n[[Benjamin Urrutia]] co-author of ''[[The Logia of Yeshua|The Logia of Yeshua: The Sayings of Jesus]]'', agrees with a theory in biblical scholarship<ref name=Dimont /> which says that Yeshua Bar Abba or Jesus Barabbas may have been none other than Jesus of Nazareth, and that the choice between two prisoners is not historical. Despite this, early scholars, such as Origen, found it unlikely that the story was fictional, pointing out that the incident occurred with a decision between two people with extremely similar names, as having such a similar name to Jesus by appending Yeshua to Barabbas would have been heretical, which is evidenced in some manuscripts by the removal of the common name Yeshua from Barabbas in order to differentiate between him and Jesus Christ. Scholars point out, the counter-intuitiveness of the writers to use such a similar name from the criminal, equating Christ with a mercenary if they were writing for a fictional purpose. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Barabbas-biblical-figure|title=Barabbas {{!}} Facts & Significance|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-11-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Warren|first=William|title=The Reliability of the New Testament: Bart Ehrman and Daniel Wallace in Dialogue|chapter=Who Changed the Text and Why?

A Roman governor who had done that could have faced execution himself.\n\n[[Benjamin Urrutia]] co-author of ''[[The Logia of Yeshua|The Logia of Yeshua: The Sayings of Jesus]]'', agrees with a theory in biblical scholarship<ref name=Dimont /> which says that Yeshua Bar Abba or Jesus Barabbas may have been none other than Jesus of Nazareth, and that the choice between two prisoners is not historical. Despite this, early scholars, such as Origen, found it unlikely that the story was fictional, pointing out that the incident occurred with a decision between two people with extremely similar names, as having such a similar name to Jesus by appending Yeshua to Barabbas would have been heretical, which is evidenced in some manuscripts by the removal of the common name Yeshua from Barabbas in order to differentiate between him and Jesus Christ. Scholars point out, the counter-intuitiveness of the writers to use such a similar name from the criminal, equating Christ with a mercenary if they were writing for a fictional purpose. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Barabbas-biblical-figure|title=Barabbas {{!}} Facts & Significance|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-11-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Warren|first=William|title=The Reliability of the New Testament: Bart Ehrman and Daniel Wallace in Dialogue|chapter=Who Changed the Text and Why?
