Modern descendants of this [[Proto-Dravidian language|ancient Dravidian]] word include [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] ''va\u1e5futina'' and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] ''va\u1e5futu\u1e47ai''.\n\nThe Dravidian word was borrowed into the [[Indic languages]], giving ancient forms such as [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] ''v\u0101ti\u1e45-ga\u1e47a'' (alongside Sanskrit ''v\u0101tigama'') and [[Prakrit]] ''v\u0101i\u1e43a\u1e47a''. According to the entry ''brinjal'' in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the Sanskrit word ''v\u0101tin-g\u0101na'' denoted 'the class (that removes) the wind-disorder (windy humour)': that is, ''v\u0101tin-g\u0101na'' came to be the name for eggplants because they were thought to cure [[flatulence]]. The modern [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] words descending directly from the Sanskrit name are ''baingan'' and ''began''.\n\nThe Indic word ''v\u0101ti\u1e45-ga\u1e47a'' was then borrowed into [[Persian language|Persian]] as ''b\u0101ding\u0101n''. Persian ''b\u0101ding\u0101n'' was borrowed in turn into Arabic as ''b\u0101\u1e0finj\u0101n'' (or, with the [[definite article]], ''al-b\u0101\u1e0finj\u0101n''). From Arabic, the word was borrowed into European languages.\n\n====From Arabic into Iberia and beyond====\nIn [[al-Andalus]], the Arabic word ''(al-)b\u0101\u1e0finj\u0101n'' was borrowed into the [[Romance languages]] in forms beginning with ''b''- or, with the definite article included, ''alb''-:\n* [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''bringella'', ''bringiela'', earlier ''beringela''.\n* [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''berengena'', ''alberengena''.\n\nThe Spanish word ''alberengena'' was then borrowed into French, giving ''aubergine'' (along with French dialectal forms like ''albergine'', ''albergaine'', ''albergame'', and ''beling\u00e8le''). The French name was then borrowed into British English, appearing there first in the late eighteenth century.\n\nThrough the [[colonialism|colonial expansion]] of Portugal, the Portuguese form ''bringella'' was borrowed into a variety of other languages:\n* Indian English and South African English ''brinjal'', ''brinjaul'' (first attested in the seventeenth century).\n* [[Malay language|Malay]] ''berinjal\u0101''.\n* [[West Indian English]] ''brinjalle'' and (through [[folk-etymology]]) ''brown-jolly''.\n\nThus although Indian English ''brinjal'' ultimately originates in languages of the Indian Subcontinent, it actually came into Indian English via Portuguese.\n\n====From Arabic into Greek and beyond====\n[[File:MS 626, folio CLXXV Wellcome L0075018.jpg|thumb|Illustrations of an eggplant from a possibly fifteenth-century French manuscript of a work by [[Matthaeus Platearius]].

The Greek loans took a variety of forms, but crucially they began with ''m-'', partly because Greek lacked the initial ''b-'' sound and partly through [[folk-etymology|folk-etymological]] association with the Greek word ''\u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03c2'' (''melas''), 'black'. Attested Greek forms include ''\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03b6\u03ac\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd'' (''matizanion'', eleventh-century), ''\u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd\u03c4\u03b6\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1'' (''melintzana'', fourteenth-century), and ''\u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd\u03c4\u03b6\u03ac\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd'' (''melintzanion'', seventeenth-century).\n\nFrom Greek, the word was borrowed into [[Italian language|Italian]] and medieval [[Latin]], and onwards into French. Early forms include:\n* ''Melanz\u0101na'', recorded in [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] in the twelfth century.\n* ''Melongena'', recorded in Latin in the thirteenth century.\n* ''Melongiana'', recorded in [[Veronese language|Veronese]] in the fourteenth century.\n* ''Melanjan'', recorded in [[Old French]].\n\nFrom these forms came the botanical Latin ''melong\u0113na''. This was used by [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort|Tournefort]] as a [[genus]] name in 1700, then by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] as a [[species]] name in 1753. It remains in scientific use.\n\nThese forms also gave rise to the [[Caribbean English]] ''melongene''.\n\nThe Italian ''melanzana'', through [[folk-etymology]], was adapted to ''mela insana'' ('mad apple'): already by the thirteenth century, this name had given rise to a tradition that eggplants could cause insanity. Translated into English as 'mad-apple', 'rage-apple', or 'raging apple', this name for eggplants is attested from 1578 and the form 'mad-apple' may still be found in [[Southern American English]].<ref name=\"guineasquash\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thecarolinagoldricefoundation.org/news/2016/6/4/guinea-squash|title=Guinea squash|publisher=Carolina Gold Rice Foundation|date=4 April 2011|access-date=9 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110061559/http://www.thecarolinagoldricefoundation.org/news/2016/6/4/guinea-squash|archive-date=10 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Other English names===\n\nThe plant is also known as ''guinea squash'' in [[Southern American English]].

Roasted, skinned, mashed, mixed with [[onion]]s, [[tomato]]es, and [[spice]]s, and then slow cooked gives the [[South Asian cuisine|South Asian]] dish ''[[baingan bharta]]'' or ''gojju'', similar to ''[[salat\u0103 de vinete]]'' in [[Romanian cuisine|Romania]]. Another version of the dish, ''begun-pora'' (eggplant charred or burnt), is very popular in Bangladesh and the east Indian states of [[Odisha]] and [[West Bengal]] where the pulp of the vegetable is mixed with raw chopped shallot, green chilies, salt, fresh coriander, and mustard oil. Sometimes fried tomatoes and deep-fried potatoes are also added, creating a dish called ''begun bhorta''.

In [[Iranian cuisine]], it is blended with whey as ''[[kashk e bademjan]]'', tomatoes as ''[[Mirza Ghassemi|mirza ghassemi]]'', or made into stew as ''[[Khoresh bademjan|khoresht-e-bademjan]]''.

Perhaps the best-known Turkish eggplant dishes are ''[[imam bay\u0131ld\u0131]]'' (vegetarian) and ''[[karn\u0131yar\u0131k]]'' (with minced meat). It may also be roasted in its skin until charred, so the pulp can be removed and blended with other ingredients, such as lemon, tahini, and garlic, as in the [[Arab cuisine|Arab]] ''[[baba ghanoush]]'' and the similar [[Greek cuisine|Greek]] ''[[melitzanosalata]]''. A mix of roasted eggplant, roasted red peppers, chopped onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, carrots, celery, and spices is called ''[[zacusc\u0103]]'' in [[Romanian cuisine|Romania]], and ''[[ajvar]]'' or ''[[pinjur]]'' in the [[Balkan cuisine|Balkans]].\n\nA Spanish dish called ''[[escalivada]]'' in [[Catalonia]] calls for strips of roasted aubergine, sweet pepper, onion, and tomato. In [[Andalusia]], eggplant is mostly cooked thinly sliced, deep-fried in olive oil and served hot with honey (''berenjenas a la Cordobesa''). In the [[La Mancha]] region of central Spain, a small eggplant is pickled in vinegar, paprika, olive oil, and red peppers. The result is berenjena of [[Almagro, Ciudad Real]]. A Levantine specialty is ''[[makdous]]'', another pickling of eggplants, stuffed with red peppers and walnuts in olive oil. Eggplant can be hollowed out and stuffed with meat, rice, or other fillings, and then baked.

However, ''[[Solanum incanum]]'' and [[cockroach berry]] (''S. capsicoides''), other eggplant-like nightshades described by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] and [[Carlo Allioni|Allioni]], respectively, were occasionally considered eggplant varieties, but this is not correct.<ref name = ss2008 />\n\nThe eggplant has a long history of [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] confusion with the [[scarlet eggplant|scarlet]] and [[Ethiopian eggplant|Ethiopian]] eggplants (''[[Solanum aethiopicum]])'', known as ''gilo'' and ''nakati'', respectively, and described by Linnaeus as ''S. aethiopicum''. The eggplant was sometimes considered a variety ''violaceum'' of that species. ''S. violaceum'' of [[A. P. de Candolle|de Candolle]] applies to Linnaeus' ''S. aethiopicum''.

Modern descendants of this [[Proto-Dravidian language|ancient Dravidian]] word include [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] ''va\u1e5futina'' and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] ''va\u1e5futu\u1e47ai''.\n\nThe Dravidian word was borrowed into the [[Indic languages]], giving ancient forms such as [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] ''v\u0101ti\u1e45-ga\u1e47a'' (alongside Sanskrit ''v\u0101tigama'') and [[Prakrit]] ''v\u0101i\u1e43a\u1e47a''. According to the entry ''brinjal'' in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the Sanskrit word ''v\u0101tin-g\u0101na'' denoted 'the class (that removes) the wind-disorder (windy humour)': that is, ''v\u0101tin-g\u0101na'' came to be the name for eggplants because they were thought to cure [[flatulence]]. The modern [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] words descending directly from the Sanskrit name are ''baingan'' and ''began''.\n\nThe Indic word ''v\u0101ti\u1e45-ga\u1e47a'' was then borrowed into [[Persian language|Persian]] as ''b\u0101ding\u0101n''. Persian ''b\u0101ding\u0101n'' was borrowed in turn into Arabic as ''b\u0101\u1e0finj\u0101n'' (or, with the [[definite article]], ''al-b\u0101\u1e0finj\u0101n''). From Arabic, the word was borrowed into European languages.\n\n====From Arabic into Iberia and beyond====\nIn [[al-Andalus]], the Arabic word ''(al-)b\u0101\u1e0finj\u0101n'' was borrowed into the [[Romance languages]] in forms beginning with ''b''- or, with the definite article included, ''alb''-:\n* [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''bringella'', ''bringiela'', earlier ''beringela''.\n* [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''berengena'', ''alberengena''.\n\nThe Spanish word ''alberengena'' was then borrowed into French, giving ''aubergine'' (along with French dialectal forms like ''albergine'', ''albergaine'', ''albergame'', and ''beling\u00e8le''). The French name was then borrowed into British English, appearing there first in the late eighteenth century.\n\nThrough the [[colonialism|colonial expansion]] of Portugal, the Portuguese form ''bringella'' was borrowed into a variety of other languages:\n* Indian English and South African English ''brinjal'', ''brinjaul'' (first attested in the seventeenth century).\n* [[Malay language|Malay]] ''berinjal\u0101''.\n* [[West Indian English]] ''brinjalle'' and (through [[folk-etymology]]) ''brown-jolly''.\n\nThus although Indian English ''brinjal'' ultimately originates in languages of the Indian Subcontinent, it actually came into Indian English via Portuguese.\n\n====From Arabic into Greek and beyond====\n[[File:MS 626, folio CLXXV Wellcome L0075018.jpg|thumb|Illustrations of an eggplant from a possibly fifteenth-century French manuscript of a work by [[Matthaeus Platearius]]. The word ''melonge'', below the illustration, has a blue initial ''M''-.]]\nThe Arabic word ''b\u0101\u1e0finj\u0101n'' was borrowed into [[Greek language|Greek]] by the eleventh century CE. The Greek loans took a variety of forms, but crucially they began with ''m-'', partly because Greek lacked the initial ''b-'' sound and partly through [[folk-etymology|folk-etymological]] association with the Greek word ''\u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03c2'' (''melas''), 'black'. Attested Greek forms include ''\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03b6\u03ac\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd'' (''matizanion'', eleventh-century), ''\u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd\u03c4\u03b6\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1'' (''melintzana'', fourteenth-century), and ''\u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd\u03c4\u03b6\u03ac\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd'' (''melintzanion'', seventeenth-century).\n\nFrom Greek, the word was borrowed into [[Italian language|Italian]] and medieval [[Latin]], and onwards into French. Early forms include:\n* ''Melanz\u0101na'', recorded in [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] in the twelfth century.\n* ''Melongena'', recorded in Latin in the thirteenth century.\n* ''Melongiana'', recorded in [[Veronese language|Veronese]] in the fourteenth century.\n* ''Melanjan'', recorded in [[Old French]].\n\nFrom these forms came the botanical Latin ''melong\u0113na''. This was used by [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort|Tournefort]] as a [[genus]] name in 1700, then by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] as a [[species]] name in 1753. It remains in scientific use.\n\nThese forms also gave rise to the [[Caribbean English]] ''melongene''.\n\nThe Italian ''melanzana'', through [[folk-etymology]], was adapted to ''mela insana'' ('mad apple'): already by the thirteenth century, this name had given rise to a tradition that eggplants could cause insanity. Translated into English as 'mad-apple', 'rage-apple', or 'raging apple', this name for eggplants is attested from 1578 and the form 'mad-apple' may still be found in [[Southern American English]].<ref name=\"guineasquash\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thecarolinagoldricefoundation.org/news/2016/6/4/guinea-squash|title=Guinea squash|publisher=Carolina Gold Rice Foundation|date=4 April 2011|access-date=9 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110061559/http://www.thecarolinagoldricefoundation.org/news/2016/6/4/guinea-squash|archive-date=10 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Other English names===\n\nThe plant is also known as ''guinea squash'' in [[Southern American English]].

A mix of roasted eggplant, roasted red peppers, chopped onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, carrots, celery, and spices is called ''[[zacusc\u0103]]'' in [[Romanian cuisine|Romania]], and ''[[ajvar]]'' or ''[[pinjur]]'' in the [[Balkan cuisine|Balkans]].\n\nA Spanish dish called ''[[escalivada]]'' in [[Catalonia]] calls for strips of roasted aubergine, sweet pepper, onion, and tomato. In [[Andalusia]], eggplant is mostly cooked thinly sliced, deep-fried in olive oil and served hot with honey (''berenjenas a la Cordobesa''). In the [[La Mancha]] region of central Spain, a small eggplant is pickled in vinegar, paprika, olive oil, and red peppers. The result is berenjena of [[Almagro, Ciudad Real]]. A Levantine specialty is ''[[makdous]]'', another pickling of eggplants, stuffed with red peppers and walnuts in olive oil. Eggplant can be hollowed out and stuffed with meat, rice, or other fillings, and then baked. In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], for example, it is fried and stuffed with [[walnut paste]] to make ''[[nigvziani badrijani]]''.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nMelanzane alla Parmigiana.jpg|[[Parmigiana|Parmigiana di melanzane]], [[eggplant parmesan]]\nPenne with eggplant and basil in yogurt-tomato sauce.jpg|[[Penne]] with eggplant and [[basil]] in yogurt-tomato sauce.\nBerenjenas-Almagro.jpg|[[Almagro, Ciudad Real|Almagro eggplant]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Cultivation and pests==\n\nIn [[tropical climate|tropical]] and [[subtropical climate]]s, eggplant can be sown in the garden. Eggplant grown in [[temperate]] climates fares better when transplanted into the garden after all danger of frost has passed. Eggplant prefers hot weather, and when grown in cold climates or in areas with low humidity, the plants languish or fail to set and produce mature fruit.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.growveg.com/guides/how-to-grow-eggplant-in-cooler-climates/|title=How to Grow Eggplant in Cooler Climates|access-date=2017-04-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170411223946/https://www.growveg.com/guides/how-to-grow-eggplant-in-cooler-climates/|archive-date=2017-04-11|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gardenmentors.com/garden-help/grow-your-own-food/growing-eggplant-successfully-in-cooler-climates/|title=Growing Eggplant Successfully in Cooler Climates \u2013 Garden Mentors|date=16 August 2012|access-date=30 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828232655/http://gardenmentors.com/garden-help/grow-your-own-food/growing-eggplant-successfully-in-cooler-climates/|archive-date=28 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>  Seeds are typically started eight to 10 weeks prior to the anticipated [[Last frost|frost-free date]].

[[Mulch]]ing helps conserve moisture and prevent weeds and fungal diseases and the plants benefit from some shade during the hottest part of the day. [[Hand pollination]] by shaking the flowers improves the set of the first blossoms. Growers typically cut fruits from the vine just above the calyx owing to the somewhat woody stems.

For this reason, it should generally not be planted in areas previously occupied by its close relatives. However, since eggplants can be particularly susceptible to pests such as [[Whitefly|whiteflies]], they are sometimes grown with slightly less susceptible plants, such as [[chili pepper]], as a sacrificial [[trap crop]]. Four years should separate successive crops of eggplants to reduce pest pressure.\n\nCommon North American pests include the [[Colorado potato beetle|potato beetles]], [[flea beetle]]s, [[aphid]]s, whiteflies, and [[Tetranychus urticae|spider mites]]. Good sanitation and [[crop rotation]] practices are extremely important for controlling fungal disease, the most serious of which is ''[[Verticillium]]''.\n\n===Production===\n[[File:Eggplant production map FAOSTAT 2014.png|thumb|452x452px|Production of eggplant in 2013 by country<ref name=\"FAOSTAT\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC/visualize |title=FAOSTAT |accessdate=2018-01-26 |work=FAO |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170511194947/http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC/visualize |archive-date=2017-05-11 |url-status=live }}</ref>]]\n\nIn 2016, global production of eggplants was 51.3 million [[tonnes]].<ref name=\"FAOSTAT\" /> That year, almost 1.8 million hectares (4.4 million acres) were devoted to the cultivation of eggplants in the world.

However, ''[[Solanum incanum]]'' and [[cockroach berry]] (''S. capsicoides''), other eggplant-like nightshades described by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] and [[Carlo Allioni|Allioni]], respectively, were occasionally considered eggplant varieties, but this is not correct.<ref name = ss2008 />\n\nThe eggplant has a long history of [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] confusion with the [[scarlet eggplant|scarlet]] and [[Ethiopian eggplant|Ethiopian]] eggplants (''[[Solanum aethiopicum]])'', known as ''gilo'' and ''nakati'', respectively, and described by Linnaeus as ''S. aethiopicum''. The eggplant was sometimes considered a variety ''violaceum'' of that species. ''S. violaceum'' of [[A. P. de Candolle|de Candolle]] applies to Linnaeus' ''S. aethiopicum''. An actual ''S. violaceum'', an unrelated plant described by Ortega, included Dunal's ''S. amblymerum'' and was often confused with the same author's ''S. brownii''.<ref name = ss2008 />\n\nLike the potato and ''S. lichtensteinii'', but unlike the tomato, which then was generally put in a different genus, the eggplant was also described as ''[[Solanum esculentum|S. esculentum]]'', in this case once more in the course of [[Michel F\u00e9lix Dunal|Dunal]]'s work. He also recognized the varieties ''aculeatum'', ''inerme'', and ''subinerme'' at that time. Similarly, [[Heinrich Christian Friedrich Schumacher|H.C.F. Schuhmacher]] and [[Peter Thonning]] named the eggplant as ''[[Solanum edule|S. edule]]'', which is also a junior synonym of [[sticky nightshade]] (''S. sisymbriifolium'').

The city was now controlled from [[Mecklenburg]] by Swedish forces directed by [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]]. In the event, Rostock suffered less under occupation than many other regional centres, although trade was badly disrupted. Later during October 1631 Schupp had nevertheless left town, moving via [[L\u00fcbeck]] to [[Hamburg]] and then to [[Bremen]].<ref name=JBSlautLAGIS/>   By 1632, after an absence of perhaps three years, he was back home in [[Giessen]].<ref name=JBSlautCB/>   The military-political situation locally was relatively quiet, and during 1632 he received permission from the [[George II, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt|young Landgraf]] to lecture at [[Marburg]].<ref name=JBSlautCB/>   At the same time he was appointed director and, between 1632 and 1634, head stipendiate (''\"Stipendiatenmajor\"'') at Marburg's \"collegium und exercitium oratorium\". Here he may have been imprudently generous with his political views, since in December 1632, following [[George II, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt|the Landgraf's]] personal intervention, he was formally and firmly admonished by [[:de:Johann Heinrich Tonsor|Johann Heinrich Tonsor]], a senior professor at [[University of Marburg|the university]].  He should restrict himself to subjects that fell within the existing scope of his students' understanding:  he must take care to avoid any questions that might prejudice the standing of the [[Holy Roman Empire|imperial authorities]], or touch on the causes and disputes of [[Thirty Years' War|the war]].<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\nAfter [[University of Marburg|the university]] was cleared by plague Schupp returned once more to [[Giessen]] where during 1633/34 he taught [[Rhetoric]].<ref name=JBSlautCB/>   Sources differ as to whether it was dissatisfaction with the teaching work in Giessen or the continuing twin impacts of [[:de:Geschichte der Pest|plague]] and [[Thirty years war |war]] in [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt |Hesse-Darmstadt]] that drove him, during 1634/35, to team up with the young aristocrat [[Rau von Holzhausen|Rudolf Rau von Holzhausen]] and leave the area and embark on what in effect became a second period as an [[Journeyman years|itinerant scholar]], moving first to [[Cologne]] and then to what was known at the time as the [[South Holland |\"Zuiderkwartier\" (South Holland)]].<ref name=JBSlautCB/><ref name=JBSlautLMU/><ref name=JBSlautHJ/>   Identified in records as the companion Rau von Holzhausen, on 3 June 1634 Johannes Balthasarus Schuppius enrolled at the [[University of Leiden]].<ref name=JBSlautLAGIS/>   In the [[Dutch Republic]] Schupp resumed his teaching career. He was also able to network with some of the leading international scholars of the day, including the classicist [[Claudius Salmasius]] and the remarkable philologist [[Marcus Zuerius van Boxhorn]].<ref name=JBSlautCB/>  The man described in a number of sources as the greatest scholar of his generation, [[Daniel Heinsius]], nevertheless refused even to meet Schupp.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>   Having noticed the similarity (especially in [[Latin]]) between Schupp's family name and that of the Catholic controversialist [[Caspar Schoppe]] (who by now had relocated permanently [[Ultramontanism |south]] to [[Rome]], Heinsius insisted that Schoppe and Schupp must be cousins.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>, during which time he made the acquaintance of the well-travelled theologian [[Gerardus Vossius]] and of the polymath-humanist [[Caspar Barlaeus]]. Although he was impressed by these and by many other eminent academic gentlemen whom he met during his time accompanying [[Rau von Holzhausen|Rudolf Rau von Holzhausen]]in the [[Dutch Republic]], of greater significance was his appreciation at close hand of the mutual tolerance apparent in the relationship between church and state. He himself later attributed his liberal approach to church-state relations to his Dutch experiences. The religious toleration upon which visitors to the [[Dutch Republic]] frequently commented during the so-called \"[[Dutch Golden Age]]\" was particularly striking after his earlier travels across various parts of the [[Holy Roman empire]] in which the more conservative precept \"[[Cuius regio, eius religio]]\" was seldom challenged.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\n===Tenure===\nAt the end of 1635, after approximately another year away, he returned again to [[University of Marburg |Marburg]]. By now, still aged only 25, he believed himself well prepared to take up a position as a university theologian. The university authorities had other ideas, however, which Schupp was in no position to counter. [[:de:Theodor H\u00f6pingk|Professor Theodor H\u00f6pingk]] had just vacated Marburg in order to take up a position as [[Syndic]] in [[Friedberg, Hesse|Friedberg]] (near [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]], leaving Marburg with a vacancy for a professor of Eloquence and History. Johann Balthasar Schupp accepted the Marburg professorship in Eloquence and History,<ref name=JBSlautLMU/> retaining the post till 1646.<ref name=JBSlautCB/><ref name=JBSlautLAGIS/>   Sources recall that he took a personal interest in his students, and displayed a talent for relating to them, delivering his lectures with flair and liveliness, while shunning academic stiffness and pedantry. He was accordingly able to generate a certain level academic zeal, along with a mutually fulfilling relationship that benefited teacher and students alike.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\n===Marriages===\nOn 9 May 1636 Johann Balthasar Schupp married Anna Elisabeth Helwig. As the only (recorded) daughter of the polymath-philologist [[Christoph Helvig]], she came from another academic family in the region. Her father had died in 1617, however. The marriage was a happy one.<ref name=JBSlautCB/><ref name=JBSlautHJ/>   After the death of his first wife in 1650 he married, secondly, Sophia Eleonora Reinkingk in 1651. By each of his marriages Balthasar Schupp was father to at least one son and one daughter.<ref name= JBSlautHJ/><ref name=JBSlautLAGIS/>   According to at least one source, however, his marriages resulted in the births not of four but of five recorded children.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\n===Academic progression===\nIn 1638 Schupp organised the republication of his father-in-law's book \"Theatrum historicum et chronologicum\", which remained a useful tool for history teaching. The books lasting relevance is evident from the fact that further reprints were still being issued in the eighteenth century. His own didactic approach of abandoning pedantic tradition in favour of a more lucid eloquence effectively heralded a new technique and methodology that would win lasting approval, even though at this stage neither Schupp nor anyone else of influence in the universities establishment took the next obvious step of teaching the topic of  \"Eloquence\" in the [[vernacular]] rather than in [[Latin]].<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\nBy this time, in addition to his teaching duties at the university, Schupp was providing private lessons in [[Eloquence | Oratory]] at \"Avellin\", his summer holiday-home in the countryside outside Marburg.<ref name=JBSlautCB/><ref name=\"Mulsow2018\"/>\n\nOne surviving indication of the affection and esteem in which he was held by colleagues is a letter dated 12 December 1638 addressed by the entire university to [[George II, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt|Landgraf Georg II]], urging that Schupp's meagre annual salary of 140 [[Guilder|gulden]] should be increased. The letter describes Schupp as a \"rarum ingenium\" (''loosely, \"a rare talent\"''). The Landgraf's reply, dated 17 January 1639, indicates that he will supplement the university salary with a personal annual grant of 100 [[Guilder|gulden]], effective retrospectively from 1 January 1639. In addition the Landgraf proposes a one-time payment of 50 [[Guilder|gulden]] as acknowledgment of the low level of Schupp's remuneration during the earlier years. Both the letters involved in this remunerative exchange pay fulsome tribute to the young professor's hard work and enthusiasm.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\n===Royal commission===\nHaving been alerted to the excellence of the Professor of History and Eloquence at his university in Marburg, in 1640 [[George II, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt|the Landgraf]] commissioned Schupp to write a large Latin-language work of history. It was to be a history of the government of Landgraf Georg and of his father, the [[Louis V, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt|Landgraf Ludwig]], who had died in 1626. The period in question was an eventful one, coinciding with the outbreak and more than two decades of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. There was self-evidently a tension between the Landgraf's commission and the agreed need for Schupp to continue his public teaching and ensure that students should continue with the opportunity to study History and Eloquence. A letter from 29 September 1641 to the university authorities spells out the conflicting objectives and hints at some sort of ill-defined scaling back of the university teaching, and a subsequent letter addressed to Schupp himself and dated 29 October 1641 undertaking to provide supplementary \"princely recompense\" in the form of 12 [[Klafter]] (roughly 20 meters) of timber and two [[Domestic pig|sows]] annually. That would surely have been enough to keep the growing Schupp family warm through the winter and well provided with meat through the year. The book was almost certainly never completed, but something of its likely tone and content can be inferred from the text of a speech that Schupp delivered in 1638 in which he warmly eulogised [[George II, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt|the Landgraf]], but also vividly described the horrors of the [[Thirty Years' War|on-going war]]. The text survives because in 1640 it was printed and published as a short (16 page) booklet, dedicated to Landgraf Georg, and made available under the title \"Hercules togatus\" (''loosely, \"Citizen Hercules\"'').<ref name=JBSlautCB/><ref name=Herctog>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RVBSAAAAcAAJ&pg=PP1| year=1640|publisher=Chemlin|pages=1\u201316|author=Johann Balthasar Schupp| language=Latin  |title=Hercules togatus|work= sive de illustrissimo celsissimoque heroe Domino Georgio II.

Throughout the 1630s [[:de:Geschichte der Pest|plague]] and [[Thirty years war |war]] ravaged the area. Sometimes the basic necessities of life were unavailable in [[Marburg]]. Schupp was forced by plague to leave the city on a number of occasions. Along with the challenges inherent in the Landgraf's commission, there were times when he was required to add administrative deanery duties to his job portfolio, and on one occasion he also found himself serving as a university [[Prorector]] throughout virtually the whole of 1643. By the end of the decade he was nevertheless finding opportunities to turn his attentions from the Philosophy faculty (which under the conventions of the time incorporated a wide range of topics including History and Eloquence) and towards the Theology faculty, thus fulfilling some of those ambitions with which he had returned from [[Leiden]] back in 1635.<ref name=JBSlautCB/><ref name=JBSlautLAGIS/>\n\n===Theologian and hymnist===\nIn August 1641 Schupp was awarded a [[University of Marburg |university]] [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] in [[Theology]].<ref name=JBSlautCB/><ref name=JBSlautLAGIS/><ref name=\"RistHammerschmidt2016\">{{cite book|author1=Johann Rist |author2= Andreas Hammerschmidt|author3=Michael Jacobi|title=Vorrede an den Leser   .... page 33, footnote 3|work=Katechismus-Andachten (1656): Kritische Ausgabe und Kommentar.

He combined the office with his continuing academic duties at [[University of Marburg|the university]].<ref name=JBSlautCB/><ref name=JBSlautLAGIS/>  Two years later, in 1645, he received from the university his doctorate in [[Theology]]:  correspondence indicates that it was now intended and assumed both by [[George II, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt|the Landgraf]] and by Schupp that he would have the time to conclude his tome on the recent history of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt |Hesse-Darmstadt]].<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\nSchupp's first compilation of religious songs (hymns) was pubished at [[Marburg]] in 1643.   The volume, entitled \"Passion und Bu\u00df, auch Trost-, Bitt- und Danklieder\" (''loosely, \"Passion, repentance and consolation:  songs of requests and thanks\"''), contained the lyrics for ten hymns.   A second volume, entitled \"Morgen- und Abendlieder\" (''Morning and Evening songs''), made its first appearanance probably in the same year.   The two volumes were aggregated into a single volume of fourteen hymns and re-printed in [[Hamburg]] in 1655.<ref name=JBSsecondoEM>{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/johann-balthasar-schupp_(Enciclopedia-Italiana)/|title=Schupp (Schuppius), Johann Balthasar. - Scrittore tedesco, nato a Giessen il 1\u00b0 marzo 1610, morto ad Amburgo il 26 ottobre 1661 ...|publisher=[[Treccani]], Roma|author=Emma Mezzomonti |work=Enciclopedia Italiana|date=1936|accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref>   Some of the hymns reappeared in the 1666 edition of the [[Praxis pietatis melica  |Praxis Pietatis]] (German-language hymn book) produced in [[Frankfurt am Main |Frankfurt]]:  some were reproduced in [[:de:Gesangbuch |locally compiled and printed \"community hymnals\"]].   Schupp's hymn lyrics no doubnt servd their purpose for seventeenth century Lutherans, but they were essentially \"of their time\".   During later centuries they have been overlooked:  they evince no enduring poetic merit.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\n===Swedish intervention===\n[[Hessian War|Heavy fighting in the area]] during 1645 culminated in the occupation of [[Marburg]] by [[Swedish intervention in the Thirty Years' War|Swedish troops]] on 2 November 1645.  Balthasar Schupp lost his papers and his home through the plundering of the city that followed.  He even lost his holiday-home in the countryside beyond the city:  it was burnt down.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>    He lost everything.<ref name=JBSlautLMU/>   It is not surprising, under the circumstances, that in December 1645 Schupp accepted an invitation from [[John of Hesse-Braubach|Landgraf Johann of Hesse-Braubach]] to work as chaplain (''\"Hofprediger\"'') to the court at [[Braubach]]. Johann was a younger brother to the [[George II, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt|Landgraf Georg]], and Hesse-Braubach was an adjacent (and smaller) territory to [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt |Hesse-Darmstadt]]. Whereas Schupp's previous work had been, in the first instance, a university position, he was now employed, principally, as a churchman. There were nevertheless a number of complementary appointments from the start. In addition to being employed at Braubach as court chaplain, Schupp's roles also included the ecclesiastical advisory post of \"Konsistorialrat\" and a job as Braubach's inspector of churches and schools.<ref name=JBSlautLAGIS/>   He quickly impressed [[John of Hesse-Braubach |Landgraf Johann]] with his combination of efficiency and candour, and during the final three years of the [[Thirty Year's War|war]] he increasingly found himself entrusted by his employer with political and diplomatic duties.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\n===Unexpected diplomat===\nBy this time the great powers, exhausted, were feeling their way to a settlement that might put a permanent finish to the [[Thirty Years' War|war]]. In April 1648 [[John of Hesse-Braubach |Landgraf Johann]] sent Balthasar Schupp with full powers to represent Hesse-Braubach in the negotiations at [[Osnabr\u00fcck]] that would lead, later that year, to the signing of the [[Peace of Westphalia]]. Schupp's correspondence with his landgraf, which become available to historians only at the end of the nineteenth century, shows the complexity of the mission with which he had been entrusted, but also demonstrates that [[John of Hesse-Braubach |Landgraf Johann]] had chosen his emissary well. Despite representing a politically puny landgraviate, Schupp was able to win the confidence and respect of the diplomatic representatives of the great powers, and most importantly of [[Johan Oxenstierna |Count Johan Oxenstierna]], who was probably the more powerful of two leading [[Sweden |Swedish]] delegates. Schupp nevertheless took care never to shed his clerical persona. Indeed, Oxenstierna even appointed him as chaplain to the entire Swedish delegation at the peace conference.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>   Schupp also managed to establish excellent relations with [[Johan Adler Salvius]], Oxenstierna's wily and quick-witted senior colleague at the peace conference, and the man who was seen, both at the time and subsequently, as [[Christina, Queen of Sweden |Queen Christina's]] de facto personal representative in the negotiations.<ref name=JBSlautHJ/>   Another diplomat with whim Schupp established particularly cordial relations was [[Dietrich Reinkingk]] who was representing [[Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen|Bremen]]:<ref name=JBSlautHJ/>  Reinkingk had many daughters and in 1650, following the death of his first wife, Balthasar Schupp would marry one of them.<ref name=JBSlautLAGIS/>   It is apparent from surviving correspondence that, during his mission to Osnabr\u00fcck, Schupp robustly represented the interests of [[John of Hesse-Braubach |Landgraf Johann]], although he never hesitated to state his views plainly where he disagreed with a position taken by his landgraf.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\nThe negotiations that led up to the signing of what came to be known as the [[Peace of Westphalia]] were endlessly complex, not leastly because there were no fewer than 109 individual delegations to be accommodated (although it seems there were no sessions at which all 109 delegations were present at the same time). Two complementary treaties were signed on 24 October 1648. The Treaty of M\u00fcnster was a treaty between the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and Catholic [[France]] and their respective allies. The Treaty of Osnabr\u00fcck was a treaty between the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and Protestant [[Sweden]] and their respective allies. The next day a service of thanksgiving was held at [[Osnabr\u00fcck]].{{efn |Sources differ over whether this service took place at [[Osnabr\u00fcck]]<ref name=JBSlautHJ/> or at [[M\u00fcnster]].<ref name=JBSlautLAGIS/>}}   [[Johan Oxenstierna |Count Oxenstierna]] ensured that, as chaplain to the Swedish delegation (''\"Legationsprediger\"''), Balthasar Schupp was the man who delivered the sermon.<ref name=JBSlautCB/><ref name=JBSlautLAGIS/>   Following the signings on 24 October 1648 copies of the treaty had to be sent to the governments involved for ratification. For nearly another four months, to his evident annoyance, Schupp was obliged to hang around in [[M\u00fcnster]] while his family remained in [[Braubach]], which for him gave rise to what one source describes as \"all sorts of [personal] inconveniences\".<ref name=JBSlautCB/>   With ratification completed, a further series of formal ceremonies took place in M\u00fcnster during the first half of February 1649 at which the appropriate [[Ratification|documentary instruments of ratification]] were exchanged. The event was celebrated, this time in [[M\u00fcnster]], on 4 February 1649 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|stili veteris]]) with a further service of thanksgiving.  It was again Balthasar Schupp who delivered the sermon.<ref name=JBSlautLAGIS/>   During the next couple of years there would be further negotiations on matters such as military demobilisation (which seems to have involved the payment of a large amount of money to the Swedes) and papal protests against certain provisions relating to religion; but February 1649 would appear to have marked the end of any involvement with the treaty negotiations on the part of Balthasar Schupp.<ref name=JBSlautHJ/><ref name=JBSlautLAGIS/>\n\n===Hamburg job offer===\nWhile working in [[Osnabr\u00fcck]] during the run-up to the signings of the key documents included in the [[Peace of Westphalia]], Schupp was able to make several trips back home to [[Braubach]]. There were also other brief work-related visits undertaken on behalf of [[Johan Oxenstierna |Count Oxenstierna]]. It was during a visit to [[Wismar]] (which following its military occupation in 1628 had become the administrative centre of [[Swedish Wismar|Sweden's]] [[Dominions of Sweden|German possessions]], that he made a brief diversion to [[History of Hamburg#Modern History|Hamburg]], which at the time was one of the largest and most economically dynamic cities in [[German language|German-speaking]] protestant northern Europe. At the time of his visit the senior clerical job at the church of [[St. James' Church, Hamburg|St. James (''\"Hauptkirche St. Jacobi\"'')]] had recently fallen vacant, through the death on 16 July 1648 of [[:de:Severin Schl\u00fcter|Severin Schl\u00fcter]]. St.James' was one of Hamburg's five principal churches, and the church administrators were eager to win over Balthasar Schupp, whose international public profile as a preacher among opinion formers seems to have been much enhanced through his work in [[Osnabr\u00fcck]] alongside [[Johan Oxenstierna |Oxenstierna]]. Schupp was nevertheless still relatively unknown to most members of the congregation and it was decided, with the approval of the [[:de:Hamburgische B\u00fcrgerschaft#B\u00fcrgerliche Kollegien|city fathers]], to break with precedent by inviting Schupp to deliver a \"test sermon\". [[:de:Johannes M\u00fcller (Pastor)|Pastor Johannes M\u00fcller]], a notable theologian and a church minister with his own assigned pulpit at [[St. James' Church, Hamburg|St. James' Church]], confirmed that the candidate was \"theologically sound\", and backed up his judgement by agreeing that Schupp might use his own pulpit for the test sermon, which was duly delivered on 5 September 1648 (a Tuesday). Although Schupp was directly after this called back to [[Osnabr\u00fcck]] in connection with his diplomatic duties, it would appear from the way his career unfolded during 1649 that his test sermon was well received.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\nBy this time Schupp no longer had any intention of returning to his job in Braubach. In the short term his diplomatic duties kept him from accepting a new position in Hamburg (or anywhere else), but negotiations continued. At Schupp's request, [[John of Hesse-Braubach|Landgraf Johann]] indeed wrote a letter of recommendation on his behalf to the city fathers. The reply which the mayor and city councillors sent the Landgraf survives.  It is dated 8 December 1648 and includes the assurance that the city fathers had passed the landgraf's letter on to the gentlemen of [[St. James' Church, Hamburg|St. James' Church]], who would take it into consideration in their forthcoming deliberations. It would appear from the correspondence that Schupp's backers for the job were by this time encountering irritation and impatience on the part of the Hamburg congregation over the delays that had arisen from Schupp's continuing diplomatic responsibilities. His own appeal and reputation, had meanwhile been further enhanced by the favourable reactions of the assembled diplomats to his sermon at the service of thanksgiving, held at [[Osnabr\u00fcck]] on 25 October 1648, following the treaty signings the previous day.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\n===Alternative offers===\nBy the early part of 1649 Schupp was faced with an attractive list of competing job offers. Swedish friends had arranged that he should move to [[Bremen Cathedral|Bremen]] as [[:de:Domprediger|\"Domprediger\" (''literally, \"cathedral preacher\"'']]) although the actual duties and responsibilities involved would have been wider than a pedantic interpretation of the title would suggest. His Bremen portfolio would also, for instance, include duties as \"Superintendent der Landgemeinden\" (responsible for rural communities in the (Protestant) [[:de:Generaldi\u00f6zese Bremen-Verden|General Diocese of]] [[Bremen-Verden]].<ref name=JBSlautCB/>   A competing offer came from the [[Prince-Bishopric of M\u00fcnster|church authorities of M\u00fcnster]] (which as a result of the [[Peace of Westphalia]] reverted to Catholicism in 1648 despite the strength of Protestant sentiment in the region).  The [[M\u00fcnster]] offer was for the position of [[Superintendent (ecclesiastical)|Superintendent General]] of the [[Prince-Bishopric of M\u00fcnster|Prince-Bishopric]] and was accompanied by an assurance that he would enjoy a higher income than might await him in [[Hamburg]]. Although Schupp no doubt gave these competing offers proper consideration, he concluded that \"for the education of my children and a number of other benefits, it seemed to me that a pastoral role in Hamburg would be better than a grand title somewhere else\".<ref name=JBSlautCB/>{{efn |\"Wegen Education meiner Kinder und anderer Commodit\u00e4ten halber deuchte mich, es sei ein Pastorat zu Hamburg besser, als anderswo ein gro\u00dfer Titel\".}}\n\n===Decision time===\nOn 2 February 1649 Schupp was unanimously elected to take up the pastoral post in [[St. James' Church, Hamburg|Hamburg]], and the next day the Hamburg sent him a letter informing him of their decision and inviting him to make his appearance among them on the Friday preceding [[Palm Sunday]], which that year meant 16 March 1649. At the same time the Hamburg Senate wrote to the royal Swedish legation at [[M\u00fcnster]], formally confirming their request for his release from his work for the Swedes.  Schupp accepted the job, and the Swedish release arrived without more ado. He appears to have missed the Palm Sunday appointment, however.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\nBefore taking up his New job Schupp returned up-[[Rhine|river]] to collect his family. Along the way he stopped off at [[Darmstadt]] in order to take his leave of his former employer and benefactor [[George II, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt|Landgraf Georg II]] of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt |Hesse-Darmstadt]] in person. Returning north towards Braubach from Darmstadt involved passing through [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]], where he was intercepted by a courier with a message from the Protestant community in [[Augsburg]] urging him to abandon his Hamburg plans, and instead to accept a position in Augsburg. The offer was a tempting one, not least because it would have enabled him to progress directly his [[Christoph Helvig|(first) father-in-law's]] work on education reform. There was also a threat from a \"God-fearing countess\" (probably Marie Magdalene, the widowed Countess of Lippe: 1606\u20131671) that if he persisted with the move to Hamburg and rejected the Augsburg offer she would personally make it her business to ensure that he would not go short of grief and tribulation.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>{{efn |\"... allein ich sorge, ihr werdet in eurer Hoffnung betrogen werden, und wenn ihr die Augsburger verlasset, so wird es euch an Kreuz und Tr\u00fcbsal nicht ermangeln.\"<ref name=JBSlautCB/>}}   Having already accepted the Hamburg post, however, Schupp decided to stick with it. The threatened tribulation was not to be foregone:  during the early part of that summer in [[Braubach]] his family was struck down with illness which seems to have been a version of the all-too familiar plague.  Departure was delayed by several months, and it was not till July 1649 that Schupp was able to relocate, with his family, to [[Hamburg]]  and take up his new post.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\nBetween 1649 and his death in 1661 Johann Balthasar Schupp served as chief minister (''\"Hauptpastor\"'') at [[St. James' Church, Hamburg]], where he quickly became known for the power of his preaching.<ref name=JBSlautHJ/><ref name=\"Scherf2019\">{{cite book|author=Joachim Scherf|title=Johann Balthasar Schupp|work=Junger Tag: 510 geistliche Morgenlieder und -gedichte aus 5 Jahrhunderten|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cEvADwAAQBAJ&pg=PA89|date=26 November 2019|publisher=BoD \u2013 Books on Demand|isbn=978-3-7494-3758-0|page=89}}</ref>\n\n===Hamburg years===\nOn Friday 20 July 1649 Balthasar Schupp was installed in his new office by [[:de:Johannes M\u00fcller (Pastor)|Pastor M\u00fcller]] who had, it seems, taken charge during the interregnum at [[St. James' Church, Hamburg|the \"Hauptkirche\"]].<ref name=JBSlautLMU/>   Later a serious rivalry would emerge between the two men.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\nBy now aged not quite 40 Schupp was already richly experienced, possessing more knowledge of the ways of the world than almost anyone else. He had also lived long enough to have formed strong convictions concerning virtually everything that happened, always firmly and consistently based on his Protestant world view. He was determined that the centrality of Christin faith in human existence should always be taken seriously. In these and other respects he may be compared to [[Philipp Spener]] (1635-1705) and the [[Pietism|Pietists]] who came to the fore during the second half of the seventeenth century. Schupp was not exactly a typical churchman-scholar, although he certainly possessed an abundance of knowledge, was well read, and blessed with a formidable memory. His more remarkable defining gifts involved the effectiveness of his communication skills, whether in negotiation with great men or in delivering a sermon to a church congregation. In that respect he was without question the right man in the right job.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\nSchupp was very conscious of the burden of responsibilities that came with his office. There was some time for writing, but it is nevertheless no coincidence that whereas he had hitherto published only in [[Latin]], works published during his eleven Hamburg years appeared in [[Geman language|German]]. That transition alone would be enough to secure him a place in the history of German literature. He was, at least initially, able to limit his official work. He was required to preach three sermons a week, on Sundays, Wednesdays and Fridays.  Sometimes there were also prayer sessions to be conducted on Thursdays.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>   It was for the sermons, however, that he became known. It was normal for Lutheran pastors to use their sermons to launch attacks on Jews, Catholics, Calvinists and atheists. Schupp did not do that. The focus of his criticism was not on cohorts of people defined by shared religious beliefs, but on the sins and follies of his own fellow-citizens.  In their style his sermons did not follow the traditional format of a formulaic and scholarly treatise. Instead his syntax was fresh, contemporary and compelling. He would use examples from the everyday lives of his listeners, introducing anecdotes and even jokes.  Schupp employed these devices and techniques not only when addressing his own congregations, but also when appearing as a guest preacher in other churches nearby, greatly swelling congregations in the process.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\nHis approach was, by the standards of the times, truly innovative, and by many criteria highly successful. But not everyone was impressed.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>   There were those who interpreted rebukes in his sermons as personal insults and other who thought their life choices were no business of this tiresome preacher. From fellow clerics, steeped in the traditions of a more baroque approach to sermons and written religious pieces, came the criticism that the colloquial syntax of his delivery was inconsistent with the serious purposes of a sermon - any sermon.<ref name=JBSsecondoEM/>  It soon became evident that as his sermons became ever more widely discussed, Schupp would have to learn to face criticism from both wings of the Christian faith among the good Protestant citizens of Hamburg.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\n===Bereavement and remarriage===\nPersonal tragedy struck on 12 June 1650 when Anna Elisabeth, his wife, died, possibly following a long period of poor health. His second marriage was to Sophie Eleonore Reincking and took place on 10 November 1651. She was a daughter of [[Dietrich Reinkingk]], a friend from Schupp's time as a diplomat in Osnabr\u00fcck whose fortunes had been enhanced after his friend and employer [[Frederick III of Denmark|Prince Frederick]] succeeded to the throne of [[Denmark]] towards the end of 1648.  Dietrich Reincking was no longer a senior diplomat representing [[Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen|Bremen]]:  he was the Danish chancellor. The poet-pastor [[Johann Rist]] honoured both Schupp's bereavement and his second marriage with a warmly sympathetic poem, indicating that the two men were already in contact with one another.  There were those who surmised that Schupp's marriage to his second wife was less amicable than his first marriage had been, but these are countered with suggestions that these negative reports were no more than malicious rumours put about by rival churchmen and others who found Schupp threatening or annoying.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\n===Authorship===\nIt was probably in 1654 that Balthasar Schupp started to produce a string of written pieces in the German language that are, for scholars of [[Satire|satirical writing]], his most important and enduring contribution. Of those pieces for which the date can be ascertained, the first was \"Der lobw\u00fcrdige L\u00f6w\" (''loosely, \"The commendable Lion\"''{{efn |The text was purportedly was an extended letter of congratulation addressed to a friend on the occasion of the man's marriage.   In it Schupp praises the lion as a model exemplar for the husband to follow.  It has been suggested by a modern scholar that the lion may also have been the [[Leo (astrology)|bridgegroom's astrological sign]].}}), which was an extended letter of congratulation addressed to Schupp's friend Marcus Pensin in [[Stade]] (just to the west of [[Hamburg]]) in celebration of Pensin's marriage to Catharine, the daughter of the [[:de:Kollegium der Oberalten|\"Oberalt\"]] Hinrich Schwelund.

Marlowe, ''Bible Research'' website, [http://www.bible-researcher.com/laodiceans.html The Epistle to the Laodiceans], published October 2010, accessed 8 February 2018</ref>}}\n\n===Before the commissioners===\nIt was on [[Michaelmas]] 1657 that Balthasar Schupp found himself facing a \"Commission of the Ministry\", a panel of senior Lutheran clergy that had been convened in response to the growing disquiet caused by his increasingly challenging complementary career as a published author. The commissioners requested, on behalf of the ministry that Schupp should (1) not produce theological writing under pseudonyms, (2) avoid the printing of any [[biblical apocrypha]], (3) submit anything that he wrote to the [[:de:Senior (Kirche)|church \"seniors\"]] so that it might be censored and (4) avoid including fables, jokes and funny stories in connection with phrases from [[Religious text |Holy Scripture]]. According to the report of the encountered that was produced by the [[:de:Senior (Kirche)|\"Senior\"]], [[:de:Johannes M\u00fcller (Pastor)|Pastor M\u00fcller]] (who had also been sitting as chairman of the commission) Schupp agreed to the first two of these requests, but rejected the third and the fourth, insisting that they would have infringed his freedom. The meeting therefore ended with a \"friendly request\" from the commission that Schupp should \"stick to the rules\" (''\"intra terminos bleiben\"'').<ref name=JBSlautCB/>   Although this is the most formal disciplinary exercise to which Schupp was subjected in connection with his writing, it was only the first of a series of confrontations with the church authorities involving Schupp during his final four years.<ref name=JBSlautHJ/>\n\n===Absence of clerical rapprochement===\nAssuming [[:de:Senior (Kirche)|\"Senior\"]], [[:de:Johannes M\u00fcller (Pastor)|Pastor M\u00fcller]] report was a complete ones, none of the commissioners who interviewed Balthasar that [[Michaelmas]] thought to ask him if there were any other Schupp pamphlets currently at the printers. There were. \"Salomo oder Regentenspiegel\" (\"Salomo or Regent's mirror\" - published under the pseudonym \"Antenor\")<ref name=Salomo>{{cite web|url=https://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs2/object/display/bsb10770684_00001.html|title=Salomo, oder Regentenspiegel|author=Schupp, Johann Balthasar |publisher=Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, M\u00fcnchen |accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> and \"Freund in der Noth\" (''\"Friend in need\"'' - published under the author's own name)<ref name=\"Schupp165801\">{{cite book|author=Johann Balthasar Schupp|title=Freund in der Noth |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WvJGAAAAcAAJ&pg=PP12|year=1658|pages=}}</ref> both appeared just a few weeks later. \"Freund in der Noth\" was probably written on or shortly before 16 August 1657. \"Salomo\" was probably written a little earlier. Only the \"Afterword to the reader\" at the end of \"Salomo\" was clearly written after the [[Michaelmas]] hearing.<ref name=JBSlautCB/><ref name=Salomo/>   The appearance of these pamphlets was seen by the ministers who had participated in the commission as a declaration of war on the part of Schupp, and a campaign was launched against him which may not have destroyed him factually or in the eyes of history, but which nevertheless sapped his energies and caused him very great aggravation.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\n===A certain format: a certain approach===\nBy this time the character and pattern of Schupp's pamphlets was becoming clear. He himself defined them as \"small tracts\" (''\"Tract\u00e4tchen\"''):  they were produced in the smallest of the standard publication formats of the time ([[:de:Duodezformat |Duodezformat]]). It is clear that they were eagerly sought out by readers, since there were many reprints produced over relatively short periods of time.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>  They all deliver Schupp's personal views with uncompromising confidence and flair, and concern a range of topics that cover both public and private concerns. They are attractively written, but sometimes show a certain digressive tendency and are sometimes peppered with anecdotes which are not infrequently taken from the author's own life. Schupp's pamphlets can be broadly divided into two types:  there are tracts which edify (such as \"Die Predigt\" (''\"The sermon\"''), \"Der geplagte Hiob\" (''\"Plagued [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]]\"''), \"Die Krankenw\u00e4rterin\" (''\"The nurse\"''), \"die Litanei\" and \"Golgotha\") and there are those which Schupp himself classified as \"political writings\" which were primarily focused on public issues.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>   These frequently demonstrate an engaging interplay of the frivolous and the serious. There are many instances of savage [[satire]] attacking public grievances, such as [[:de:Pennalismus|pennalism (abusive exploitation unequal employer:apprentice/student relations)]] and idiocies in universities and schools, systems and the hankering after what is new and \"strange\".<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\n===Intensifying confrontation===\nIn the aftermath of the [[Thirty Years' War|war]], the aggressive satire of Schupp's later years was part of a broader trend, supported by increased public literacy and a rapid growth in the availability of printing presses. Others attacking the status quo with similar fervour included [[Johann Michael Moscherosch]], [[:de:Johann Lauremberg|Johann Lauremberg]] and [[:de:Joachim Rachel (Pastor, um 1600)|Joachim Rachel]]. For the political and religious establishments the attacks were more threatening precisely because of their popularity bordering at times on populism. After the appearance on the streets of \"Salomo oder Regentenspiegel\" (\"Salomo or Regent's mirror\" - published under the pseudonym \"Antenor\")<ref name=Salomo/> and \"Freund in der Noth\" (''\"Friend in need\"'' - published under the author's own name)<ref name=\"Schupp165801\"/> at the end of 1657 ministers of the Hamburg church establishment decided they needed inspiration and reassurance from the world of academe.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\nOn 12 November 1657 the Hamburg pastors sent out two letters to the Theology Faculties at the [[University of Strasbourg| Strasbourg]] and [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|Wittenberg]] in which they sought authoritative answers to two questions:\n*  Was it right that a doctor of Theology who was also a cleric of the Lutheran church with responsibility over a large congregation and parish should preach and have printed witticisms, fables, satires and ridiculous anecdotes?<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n*  The such a man should not defer to privately conveyed rebukes, but should react with contemptuous attacks, derision and blasphemy against colleagues, rather than desisting from the conduct complained of?\nThe answers came back from [[Strasbourg]] and a week later from [[Wittemberg]], and were read out to conventions of the assembled clerics on 15 and 22 January 1658. The learned gentlemen of the university theology faculties agreed that Schupp's conduct described in the first question was not right. On the second question, reflecting their Lutheran credentials, the men from then university recommended that if nothing else worked, then the clerics should turn to the secular government.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\nSchupp was now invited for a further meeting with a delegation of senior Hamburg clergy. His request that he might know in advance what questions he should be prepared to answer was refused. He therefore in turn refused to meet the clerical delegation. The church ministers now turned to what nineteenth century sources identify as [[Government of Hamburg|the Hamburg senate]] (generally referred to before 1861 as the \"Rath\" or city council). They found that Schupp had already lodged a plaint against the church authorities. On 27 January 1658 Balthasar Schupp attended an interview with [[Government of Hamburg|the city fathers]].  The councillors made three principal demands:  Schupp should not mention their meeting nor the dispute behind it from the pulpit; secondly, he should not have any more of his satirical pieces printed in Hamburg; and thirdly, he should attend a meeting with the senior clergy and resolve his differences with the Hamburg church establishment. Schupp agreed to the first two demands, but said he would not attend any meeting with the church authorities without first being able to inspect the advice that they had received from the universities. The next day the church representatives rejected that demand.  At the same time they came up with their own demand that the city councillors should arrange an oral disputation between representatives of the two sides. The disputation, was to be supervised and arbitrated by representatives from the city council (senate).<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\n===Resolution by disputation?===\nThe disputation was quickly arranged: it took place on 10 February 1658. [[:de:Senior (Kirche)|\"Senior\"]], [[:de:Johannes M\u00fcller (Pastor)| M\u00fcller]], on behalf of the church authorities, applied for the councillors to hand over a copy of the plaint against them which Schupp had lodged with the city fathers the previous month. He demanded that Schupp should be required to expunge the fables, jokes and humorous anecdotes from his sermons and from his printed pamphlets. He then asked what further steps might be taken to remedy the aggravation caused:  it turned out that M\u00fcller's question was rhetorical. The best solution, he continued, would be for the senior clerics to issue a document in which the questions at issue might be settled once and for all.<ref name=JBSlautCB/> \n\nThe chairman of the presiding delegation of councillors refused to hand over a copy of Schupp's complaint against the church authorities. He undertook to place the other two substantive demands before the full council for consideration.<ref name=JBSlautCB/> \n\nOm 26 February 1658 Schupp appeared before a reconvened \"Commission of the Ministry\".   The parties were probably taking part at the direction of the city councillors. Schupp again refused to provide the panel of churchmen with a copy of the complaint against the church authorities which he had previously lodged with the city fathers, insisting that he no longer had a copy of it. On the more substantive issue concerning the demands that he should change the way he preached and the contents of his published tracts, he referred his accusers to the record of the commission's hearing from when he had previous appeared on September 29, 1657. This had been drafted by [[:de:Johannes M\u00fcller (Pastor)|Pastor M\u00fcller]]. He would not submit his sermons or tracts to the church authorities for \"correction\".   There was nothing in them that he wished to change.   Even if he were reduced to begging on the streets, his sermons and tracts were personal matters that were only answerable to himself and not subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission: \"es w\u00e4ren eine Sachen supra nostram crepidam\". The February 26, 1658 hearing produced a total lack of agreement, and appeared to demonstrate that agreement would probably be impossible. The hearing appears to have ended in an atmosphere of heightened acrimony. Shortly after that the city council put an end to the dispute with an Amnesty Decree which imposed a requirement of silence on both parties. Although this put an end to the public warring, the underlying disagreements remained unaffected. By this time Schupp's tracts had nevertheless become less contentious. \"Die Krankenw\u00e4rterin:  oder Auslegung des heiligen Vaterunser, wie man es mit armen, einf\u00e4ltigen kranken Leuten beten kann\" (''loosely, \"The nurse, or interpretation of 'The Lord's Prayer' so that you can pray with poor simple people who are ill\"'') was written during [[Advent]] in 1657:  the first printed versions appeared during 1658.<ref name=JBSlautCB/><ref name=\"Schupp1684\">{{cite book|author=Johann Balthasar Schupp|title=Die Krankenw\u00e4rterin|work=Lehrreiche Schrifften, Deren sich Beydes Geist- als Weltliche, we\u00df Standes und Alters sie auch sind, n\u00fctzlich gebrauchen k\u00f6nnen: In f\u00f6rmliche Ordnung zusammen getragen, und mit zwey Registern versehen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r2xgAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA444 |year=1658 |publisher=Wust |pages=444\u2013469}}</ref>\n\n===\"Seven evil spirits\"===\n\"Sieben b\u00f6se Geister, welche heutiges Tages Knechte und M\u00e4gde regieren und verf\u00fchre\" (''loosely, \"Seven evil spirits which these days rule over and seduce household servants of both sexes\"'') was written after 8 June 1657 and first printed before 5 April 1658.<ref name=\"Schupp165802\">{{cite book|author=Johann Balthasar Schupp|title=Sieben b\u00f6se Geister, welche heutiges Tages Knechte und M\u00e4gde regiren und verf\u00fchren|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9vJeHTJzbJAC&pg=PP1 |year=1658 |publisher= Georg Pappen|pages=}}</ref>   This tract discusses issues of the time involving household servants and tries to find ways to improve the situation. It clearly belongs to the \"political\" category rather than the \"edifying\" of Schupp's pamphlets, but in pursuit of its serious purpose it follows to a serious approach, even if it is still not entirely free of fables and anecdotes.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>   In this tract Schupp at several points made free use of material that had already appeared in \"Gesindeteufel\" by Peter Glaser, which had appeared in 1564. It was not the first time that tracts by Schupp had featured what would in the twenty-first century be construed as plagiarism, but it was a particularly egregious example. Earlier instances had, perhaps been protected from criticism by the eccentric and witty terms in which they had been couched. Maybe by 1658 Schupp had simply accumulated more enemies among literary elites. Either way, on this occasion the blatant plagiarism triggered a literary feud that over time became strikingly toxic. \"Der B\u00fccherdieb gewarnt und ermahnt\" (''\"The book thief admonished and warned\"'') was the unfriendly dedication appearing at the front of an edition of the tract dated 14 March 1658 which was apparently intended for distribution at that year's Frankfurt Easter Fair. Till now Schupp had apparently been untroubled when editions of his tracts were published without his authorisation, but now he turned his energies to opposing these \"pirate\" editions which seem rapidly to have acquired the character of an orchestrated anti-Schupp campaign, conducted through the printed word.<ref name=JBSlautCB/> \n\n===Feuding===\nDuring the summer of 1658 a combative tract appeared under the title \"Der B\u00fccherdieb Antenor\" (''\"The book thief Antenor\" - Antenor was one of Schupp's most frequently used pseudonyms''). The authors' names were given as Nectarius Butyrolambius and Ambrosius Mellilambius, who gave themselves the additional soubriquet \"Arzneikunst Liebhabern\" (''loosely, \"Medical artistry enthusiasts\"''). The publisher of the initial print-run was identified as \"Pieter Jansoon\" of Amsterdam. In fact, two editions were printed one directly after the other. A copy, which may be of a first edition, survives in the [[Berlin State Library |Berlin library]]{{efn |library reference Bm 8530:  Titel und 58 S. 12\u00b0}}   The tract was a screed of crude personal abuse against Balthasar Schupp. Any shortage of subtlety in the text is more than balanced by savagery. The true identity of the author has never been pinned down, although two centuries later a consensus had emerged that the author was probably Schupp's old clerical antagonist, [[:de:Johannes M\u00fcller (Pastor)|Pastor Johannes M\u00fcller]], and that furthermore Schupp knew it. In reality, Schupp's opinion of its authorship seems to have shifted over time, and may have been more nuanced.<ref name=JBSlautCB/><ref name=\"Autor2014\">{{cite book|author=ohne Autor|title=Schuppius|work=Real-Enzyklop\u00e4die f\u00fcr protestantische Theologie und Kirche: 13.

In any case, although \"Butyrolambius\" was clearly aware of the various sessions that had taken place involving Balthasar Schupp and M\u00fcller's \"Commission of the Ministry\", the information about them that is contained in \"Der B\u00fccherdieb Antenor\" is not sufficiently accurate to support the view that it had come directly from [[:de:Johannes M\u00fcller (Pastor)|M\u00fcller himself]]. The evidence adduced in support of M\u00fcller having been the author (or one of the authors) of \"Der B\u00fccherdieb Antenor\" is very far from conclusive.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\nAccording to an old chronicle, on 31 October 1658 Schupp took a copy of \"Der B\u00fccherdieb Antenor\" into his pulpit at [[St. James' Church, Hamburg|Hamburg]] and used a sermon to complain to his congregation about the treatment he had been accorded in it by \"Butyrolambius\". By the time the Hamburg church establishment had used their influence to ensure that Schupp could no longer find a printer in [[Hamburg]] for his pamphlets<ref name=JBSlautLMU/> which instead were now being printed in Wolfenb\u00fcttel ([[Dithmarschen]]). In December 1658 Schupp took a trip to Wolfenb\u00fcttel, where he made the time to compose not one but two pamphlets on the offending [[pasquinade]]. The shorter of them, \"Relation aus dem Parnasso\", was printed in Wolfenb\u00fcttel that same month. The second of them, \"Calender\", is a more considered but no less passionate refutation, comprising more than 100 pages.  It includes the date 20 December 1658 below text on the final page, but on the title page at the front, the year of printing in (what appears to be) the first edition is shewn as 1659.<ref name=\"Schupp165901\"/>   He also prepared a third refutation text in response to \"Der B\u00fccherdieb Antenor\", under the  title \"Pr\u00fcfung des Geistes Nectarii Butyrolambii\" (''loosely, \"Critical review of the spirit of Nectarius Butyrolambius\"'').   This was referenced in both of the first two, but it seems that it was never printed.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\nSchupp's sermon on 1 January 1659 was particularly offensive in its condemnation of the church ministerial establishment.   Shortly after this the city council, exasperated by the continuing feuding between Schupp and his fellow pastors, issued him with a warning.  By the end of January \"Calender\"<ref name=\"Schupp165901\"/> had appeared in the book shops, and the Hamburg pastors reacted by submitting to the city council a detailed submission on 27 January 1659.   All their objections to Schupp's conduct were set out again: \"...such aggravating matters and the major disruption to our church, as well as the [resulting] grievance condition of the [Hamburg church] ministry is no longer conscionable\"{{efn |\"...solchem \u00e4rgerlichen Wesen und gro\u00dfer Zerr\u00fcttung unserer Kirche, wie auch dem betr\u00fcbten Zustande des Ministerii nicht l\u00e4nger zuzusehen\"}}.   Although the reaction of the city fathers is unknown, something of it can be inferred from Schupp's subsequent actions.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\n===Moving on?===\nAbout six months after that Balthasar Schupp's tract \"Abgen\u00f6thigte Ehrenrettung\" appeared, with a dedication addressed, by name, to each of the Hamburg city councillors.

He was baptised as a Protestant on 29 March 1610, but the baptismal record did not mention his birth date. The birth date of 1 March 1610 is widely applied in secondary sources, but no original record of it is traceable.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>   Johann Eberhart (Ebert) Schupp, his father, was a local businessman and town councillor who twice, in 1630 and again in 1640, served terms as [[mayor]].<ref name=JBSlautHJ/><ref name=JBSlautLAGIS/>   His mother, born Anna Elisabeth Ru\u00df, came from a patrician family:  her father, Johannes Ru\u00df, had also, in 1601 and 1613, served as mayor.<ref name=JBSlautHJ/>   Balthasar Schupp had five younger siblings.<ref name=JBSlautHJ/>\n\n===Student and journeyman years===\nSchupp attended the P\u00e4dagogium (school) in [[Giessen]] till the end of 1625 when, on 29 December, he enrolled at the already well established [[University of Marburg]], some 25 miles to the north.<ref name=JBSsecondoEM/> (The universities of [[University of Giessen|Giessen]] and Marburg were at this time administered as a single entity.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>)   He studied [[Philosophy]] and [[Theology]].<ref name=JBSlautLAGIS/>   In 1628 he undertook a lengthy tour educational through southern Germany and the Baltic coastal region{{efn |English language sources: '''Baltic Sea'''<br>German language sources: '''Ostsee''' / ''East Sea''.}}   According to one source his travels also took in [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Poland]], extending also to [[Copenhagen]] and [[K\u00f6nigsberg]].<ref name=JBSlautHJ/>   On a number of occasions he was obliged to change his travel plans at short notice, reacting to the dangers presented by the marauding armies and the accompanying plague epidemics that were a constant feature of the [[Thirty Years' War|on-going war]].<ref name=JBSlautCB/>   Scholars encountered during these [[Journeyman years|\"wander years\"]] who exercised a particular influence on Schupp's later career included the noted professor of eloquence, Samuel Fuchs, at [[University of K\u00f6nigsberg|K\u00f6nigsberg]], the [[University of Rostock|Rostock]] theologian [[Johann Cothmann]], the [[University of Rostock|Rostock]] legal scholar [[:de:Thomas Lindemann (der \u00c4ltere)|Thomas Lindemann]] and, perhaps most importantly, the academic poet-polymath [[Peter Lauremberg]].<ref name=JBSlautCB/>   Schupp evidently lodged with Lauremberg at [[Rostock]] during 1630/31.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>   It was also Lauremberg who supervised him for the [[magister degree]] which he received from the [[University of Rostock]] on 18 August 1631.<ref name=JBSlautLAGIS/>   He was especially proud that the university had ranked him at the top of degree list.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\n===Itinerant scholar===\nStill in Rostock, he immediately began to work as a tutor ([[Privatdozent]]). However, on 15 October 1631 the imperial garrison left Rostock, ushering in what came to be known as the [[Swedish intervention in the Thirty Years' War|\"Swedish times\"]]. The city was now controlled from [[Mecklenburg]] by Swedish forces directed by [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]]. In the event, Rostock suffered less under occupation than many other regional centres, although trade was badly disrupted. Later during October 1631 Schupp had nevertheless left town, moving via [[L\u00fcbeck]] to [[Hamburg]] and then to [[Bremen]].<ref name=JBSlautLAGIS/>   By 1632, after an absence of perhaps three years, he was back home in [[Giessen]].<ref name=JBSlautCB/>   The military-political situation locally was relatively quiet, and during 1632 he received permission from the [[George II, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt|young Landgraf]] to lecture at [[Marburg]].<ref name=JBSlautCB/>   At the same time he was appointed director and, between 1632 and 1634, head stipendiate (''\"Stipendiatenmajor\"'') at Marburg's \"collegium und exercitium oratorium\". Here he may have been imprudently generous with his political views, since in December 1632, following [[George II, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt|the Landgraf's]] personal intervention, he was formally and firmly admonished by [[:de:Johann Heinrich Tonsor|Johann Heinrich Tonsor]], a senior professor at [[University of Marburg|the university]].  He should restrict himself to subjects that fell within the existing scope of his students' understanding:  he must take care to avoid any questions that might prejudice the standing of the [[Holy Roman Empire|imperial authorities]], or touch on the causes and disputes of [[Thirty Years' War|the war]].<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\nAfter [[University of Marburg|the university]] was cleared by plague Schupp returned once more to [[Giessen]] where during 1633/34 he taught [[Rhetoric]].<ref name=JBSlautCB/>   Sources differ as to whether it was dissatisfaction with the teaching work in Giessen or the continuing twin impacts of [[:de:Geschichte der Pest|plague]] and [[Thirty years war |war]] in [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt |Hesse-Darmstadt]] that drove him, during 1634/35, to team up with the young aristocrat [[Rau von Holzhausen|Rudolf Rau von Holzhausen]] and leave the area and embark on what in effect became a second period as an [[Journeyman years|itinerant scholar]], moving first to [[Cologne]] and then to what was known at the time as the [[South Holland |\"Zuiderkwartier\" (South Holland)]].<ref name=JBSlautCB/><ref name=JBSlautLMU/><ref name=JBSlautHJ/>   Identified in records as the companion Rau von Holzhausen, on 3 June 1634 Johannes Balthasarus Schuppius enrolled at the [[University of Leiden]].<ref name=JBSlautLAGIS/>   In the [[Dutch Republic]] Schupp resumed his teaching career. He was also able to network with some of the leading international scholars of the day, including the classicist [[Claudius Salmasius]] and the remarkable philologist [[Marcus Zuerius van Boxhorn]].<ref name=JBSlautCB/>  The man described in a number of sources as the greatest scholar of his generation, [[Daniel Heinsius]], nevertheless refused even to meet Schupp.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>   Having noticed the similarity (especially in [[Latin]]) between Schupp's family name and that of the Catholic controversialist [[Caspar Schoppe]] (who by now had relocated permanently [[Ultramontanism |south]] to [[Rome]], Heinsius insisted that Schoppe and Schupp must be cousins.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>, during which time he made the acquaintance of the well-travelled theologian [[Gerardus Vossius]] and of the polymath-humanist [[Caspar Barlaeus]]. Although he was impressed by these and by many other eminent academic gentlemen whom he met during his time accompanying [[Rau von Holzhausen|Rudolf Rau von Holzhausen]]in the [[Dutch Republic]], of greater significance was his appreciation at close hand of the mutual tolerance apparent in the relationship between church and state. He himself later attributed his liberal approach to church-state relations to his Dutch experiences. The religious toleration upon which visitors to the [[Dutch Republic]] frequently commented during the so-called \"[[Dutch Golden Age]]\" was particularly striking after his earlier travels across various parts of the [[Holy Roman empire]] in which the more conservative precept \"[[Cuius regio, eius religio]]\" was seldom challenged.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\n===Tenure===\nAt the end of 1635, after approximately another year away, he returned again to [[University of Marburg |Marburg]]. By now, still aged only 25, he believed himself well prepared to take up a position as a university theologian. The university authorities had other ideas, however, which Schupp was in no position to counter. [[:de:Theodor H\u00f6pingk|Professor Theodor H\u00f6pingk]] had just vacated Marburg in order to take up a position as [[Syndic]] in [[Friedberg, Hesse|Friedberg]] (near [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]], leaving Marburg with a vacancy for a professor of Eloquence and History. Johann Balthasar Schupp accepted the Marburg professorship in Eloquence and History,<ref name=JBSlautLMU/> retaining the post till 1646.<ref name=JBSlautCB/><ref name=JBSlautLAGIS/>   Sources recall that he took a personal interest in his students, and displayed a talent for relating to them, delivering his lectures with flair and liveliness, while shunning academic stiffness and pedantry. He was accordingly able to generate a certain level academic zeal, along with a mutually fulfilling relationship that benefited teacher and students alike.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\n===Marriages===\nOn 9 May 1636 Johann Balthasar Schupp married Anna Elisabeth Helwig. As the only (recorded) daughter of the polymath-philologist [[Christoph Helvig]], she came from another academic family in the region. Her father had died in 1617, however. The marriage was a happy one.<ref name=JBSlautCB/><ref name=JBSlautHJ/>   After the death of his first wife in 1650 he married, secondly, Sophia Eleonora Reinkingk in 1651. By each of his marriages Balthasar Schupp was father to at least one son and one daughter.<ref name= JBSlautHJ/><ref name=JBSlautLAGIS/>   According to at least one source, however, his marriages resulted in the births not of four but of five recorded children.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\n===Academic progression===\nIn 1638 Schupp organised the republication of his father-in-law's book \"Theatrum historicum et chronologicum\", which remained a useful tool for history teaching. The books lasting relevance is evident from the fact that further reprints were still being issued in the eighteenth century. His own didactic approach of abandoning pedantic tradition in favour of a more lucid eloquence effectively heralded a new technique and methodology that would win lasting approval, even though at this stage neither Schupp nor anyone else of influence in the universities establishment took the next obvious step of teaching the topic of  \"Eloquence\" in the [[vernacular]] rather than in [[Latin]].<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\nBy this time, in addition to his teaching duties at the university, Schupp was providing private lessons in [[Eloquence | Oratory]] at \"Avellin\", his summer holiday-home in the countryside outside Marburg.<ref name=JBSlautCB/><ref name=\"Mulsow2018\"/>\n\nOne surviving indication of the affection and esteem in which he was held by colleagues is a letter dated 12 December 1638 addressed by the entire university to [[George II, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt|Landgraf Georg II]], urging that Schupp's meagre annual salary of 140 [[Guilder|gulden]] should be increased. The letter describes Schupp as a \"rarum ingenium\" (''loosely, \"a rare talent\"''). The Landgraf's reply, dated 17 January 1639, indicates that he will supplement the university salary with a personal annual grant of 100 [[Guilder|gulden]], effective retrospectively from 1 January 1639. In addition the Landgraf proposes a one-time payment of 50 [[Guilder|gulden]] as acknowledgment of the low level of Schupp's remuneration during the earlier years. Both the letters involved in this remunerative exchange pay fulsome tribute to the young professor's hard work and enthusiasm.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\n===Royal commission===\nHaving been alerted to the excellence of the Professor of History and Eloquence at his university in Marburg, in 1640 [[George II, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt|the Landgraf]] commissioned Schupp to write a large Latin-language work of history. It was to be a history of the government of Landgraf Georg and of his father, the [[Louis V, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt|Landgraf Ludwig]], who had died in 1626. The period in question was an eventful one, coinciding with the outbreak and more than two decades of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. There was self-evidently a tension between the Landgraf's commission and the agreed need for Schupp to continue his public teaching and ensure that students should continue with the opportunity to study History and Eloquence. A letter from 29 September 1641 to the university authorities spells out the conflicting objectives and hints at some sort of ill-defined scaling back of the university teaching, and a subsequent letter addressed to Schupp himself and dated 29 October 1641 undertaking to provide supplementary \"princely recompense\" in the form of 12 [[Klafter]] (roughly 20 meters) of timber and two [[Domestic pig|sows]] annually. That would surely have been enough to keep the growing Schupp family warm through the winter and well provided with meat through the year. The book was almost certainly never completed, but something of its likely tone and content can be inferred from the text of a speech that Schupp delivered in 1638 in which he warmly eulogised [[George II, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt|the Landgraf]], but also vividly described the horrors of the [[Thirty Years' War|on-going war]]. The text survives because in 1640 it was printed and published as a short (16 page) booklet, dedicated to Landgraf Georg, and made available under the title \"Hercules togatus\" (''loosely, \"Citizen Hercules\"'').<ref name=JBSlautCB/><ref name=Herctog>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RVBSAAAAcAAJ&pg=PP1| year=1640|publisher=Chemlin|pages=1\u201316|author=Johann Balthasar Schupp| language=Latin  |title=Hercules togatus|work= sive de illustrissimo celsissimoque heroe Domino Georgio II.

Throughout the 1630s [[:de:Geschichte der Pest|plague]] and [[Thirty years war |war]] ravaged the area. Sometimes the basic necessities of life were unavailable in [[Marburg]]. Schupp was forced by plague to leave the city on a number of occasions. Along with the challenges inherent in the Landgraf's commission, there were times when he was required to add administrative deanery duties to his job portfolio, and on one occasion he also found himself serving as a university [[Prorector]] throughout virtually the whole of 1643. By the end of the decade he was nevertheless finding opportunities to turn his attentions from the Philosophy faculty (which under the conventions of the time incorporated a wide range of topics including History and Eloquence) and towards the Theology faculty, thus fulfilling some of those ambitions with which he had returned from [[Leiden]] back in 1635.<ref name=JBSlautCB/><ref name=JBSlautLAGIS/>\n\n===Theologian and hymnist===\nIn August 1641 Schupp was awarded a [[University of Marburg |university]] [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] in [[Theology]].<ref name=JBSlautCB/><ref name=JBSlautLAGIS/><ref name=\"RistHammerschmidt2016\">{{cite book|author1=Johann Rist |author2= Andreas Hammerschmidt|author3=Michael Jacobi|title=Vorrede an den Leser   .... page 33, footnote 3|work=Katechismus-Andachten (1656): Kritische Ausgabe und Kommentar.

He combined the office with his continuing academic duties at [[University of Marburg|the university]].<ref name=JBSlautCB/><ref name=JBSlautLAGIS/>  Two years later, in 1645, he received from the university his doctorate in [[Theology]]:  correspondence indicates that it was now intended and assumed both by [[George II, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt|the Landgraf]] and by Schupp that he would have the time to conclude his tome on the recent history of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt |Hesse-Darmstadt]].<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\nSchupp's first compilation of religious songs (hymns) was pubished at [[Marburg]] in 1643.   The volume, entitled \"Passion und Bu\u00df, auch Trost-, Bitt- und Danklieder\" (''loosely, \"Passion, repentance and consolation:  songs of requests and thanks\"''), contained the lyrics for ten hymns.   A second volume, entitled \"Morgen- und Abendlieder\" (''Morning and Evening songs''), made its first appearanance probably in the same year.   The two volumes were aggregated into a single volume of fourteen hymns and re-printed in [[Hamburg]] in 1655.<ref name=JBSsecondoEM>{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/johann-balthasar-schupp_(Enciclopedia-Italiana)/|title=Schupp (Schuppius), Johann Balthasar. - Scrittore tedesco, nato a Giessen il 1\u00b0 marzo 1610, morto ad Amburgo il 26 ottobre 1661 ...|publisher=[[Treccani]], Roma|author=Emma Mezzomonti |work=Enciclopedia Italiana|date=1936|accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref>   Some of the hymns reappeared in the 1666 edition of the [[Praxis pietatis melica  |Praxis Pietatis]] (German-language hymn book) produced in [[Frankfurt am Main |Frankfurt]]:  some were reproduced in [[:de:Gesangbuch |locally compiled and printed \"community hymnals\"]].   Schupp's hymn lyrics no doubnt servd their purpose for seventeenth century Lutherans, but they were essentially \"of their time\".   During later centuries they have been overlooked:  they evince no enduring poetic merit.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\n===Swedish intervention===\n[[Hessian War|Heavy fighting in the area]] during 1645 culminated in the occupation of [[Marburg]] by [[Swedish intervention in the Thirty Years' War|Swedish troops]] on 2 November 1645.  Balthasar Schupp lost his papers and his home through the plundering of the city that followed.  He even lost his holiday-home in the countryside beyond the city:  it was burnt down.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>    He lost everything.<ref name=JBSlautLMU/>   It is not surprising, under the circumstances, that in December 1645 Schupp accepted an invitation from [[John of Hesse-Braubach|Landgraf Johann of Hesse-Braubach]] to work as chaplain (''\"Hofprediger\"'') to the court at [[Braubach]]. Johann was a younger brother to the [[George II, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt|Landgraf Georg]], and Hesse-Braubach was an adjacent (and smaller) territory to [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt |Hesse-Darmstadt]]. Whereas Schupp's previous work had been, in the first instance, a university position, he was now employed, principally, as a churchman. There were nevertheless a number of complementary appointments from the start. In addition to being employed at Braubach as court chaplain, Schupp's roles also included the ecclesiastical advisory post of \"Konsistorialrat\" and a job as Braubach's inspector of churches and schools.<ref name=JBSlautLAGIS/>   He quickly impressed [[John of Hesse-Braubach |Landgraf Johann]] with his combination of efficiency and candour, and during the final three years of the [[Thirty Year's War|war]] he increasingly found himself entrusted by his employer with political and diplomatic duties.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\n===Unexpected diplomat===\nBy this time the great powers, exhausted, were feeling their way to a settlement that might put a permanent finish to the [[Thirty Years' War|war]]. In April 1648 [[John of Hesse-Braubach |Landgraf Johann]] sent Balthasar Schupp with full powers to represent Hesse-Braubach in the negotiations at [[Osnabr\u00fcck]] that would lead, later that year, to the signing of the [[Peace of Westphalia]]. Schupp's correspondence with his landgraf, which become available to historians only at the end of the nineteenth century, shows the complexity of the mission with which he had been entrusted, but also demonstrates that [[John of Hesse-Braubach |Landgraf Johann]] had chosen his emissary well. Despite representing a politically puny landgraviate, Schupp was able to win the confidence and respect of the diplomatic representatives of the great powers, and most importantly of [[Johan Oxenstierna |Count Johan Oxenstierna]], who was probably the more powerful of two leading [[Sweden |Swedish]] delegates. Schupp nevertheless took care never to shed his clerical persona. Indeed, Oxenstierna even appointed him as chaplain to the entire Swedish delegation at the peace conference.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>   Schupp also managed to establish excellent relations with [[Johan Adler Salvius]], Oxenstierna's wily and quick-witted senior colleague at the peace conference, and the man who was seen, both at the time and subsequently, as [[Christina, Queen of Sweden |Queen Christina's]] de facto personal representative in the negotiations.<ref name=JBSlautHJ/>   Another diplomat with whim Schupp established particularly cordial relations was [[Dietrich Reinkingk]] who was representing [[Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen|Bremen]]:<ref name=JBSlautHJ/>  Reinkingk had many daughters and in 1650, following the death of his first wife, Balthasar Schupp would marry one of them.<ref name=JBSlautLAGIS/>   It is apparent from surviving correspondence that, during his mission to Osnabr\u00fcck, Schupp robustly represented the interests of [[John of Hesse-Braubach |Landgraf Johann]], although he never hesitated to state his views plainly where he disagreed with a position taken by his landgraf.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\nThe negotiations that led up to the signing of what came to be known as the [[Peace of Westphalia]] were endlessly complex, not leastly because there were no fewer than 109 individual delegations to be accommodated (although it seems there were no sessions at which all 109 delegations were present at the same time). Two complementary treaties were signed on 24 October 1648. The Treaty of M\u00fcnster was a treaty between the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and Catholic [[France]] and their respective allies. The Treaty of Osnabr\u00fcck was a treaty between the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and Protestant [[Sweden]] and their respective allies. The next day a service of thanksgiving was held at [[Osnabr\u00fcck]].{{efn |Sources differ over whether this service took place at [[Osnabr\u00fcck]]<ref name=JBSlautHJ/> or at [[M\u00fcnster]].<ref name=JBSlautLAGIS/>}}   [[Johan Oxenstierna |Count Oxenstierna]] ensured that, as chaplain to the Swedish delegation (''\"Legationsprediger\"''), Balthasar Schupp was the man who delivered the sermon.<ref name=JBSlautCB/><ref name=JBSlautLAGIS/>   Following the signings on 24 October 1648 copies of the treaty had to be sent to the governments involved for ratification. For nearly another four months, to his evident annoyance, Schupp was obliged to hang around in [[M\u00fcnster]] while his family remained in [[Braubach]], which for him gave rise to what one source describes as \"all sorts of [personal] inconveniences\".<ref name=JBSlautCB/>   With ratification completed, a further series of formal ceremonies took place in M\u00fcnster during the first half of February 1649 at which the appropriate [[Ratification|documentary instruments of ratification]] were exchanged. The event was celebrated, this time in [[M\u00fcnster]], on 4 February 1649 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|stili veteris]]) with a further service of thanksgiving.  It was again Balthasar Schupp who delivered the sermon.<ref name=JBSlautLAGIS/>   During the next couple of years there would be further negotiations on matters such as military demobilisation (which seems to have involved the payment of a large amount of money to the Swedes) and papal protests against certain provisions relating to religion; but February 1649 would appear to have marked the end of any involvement with the treaty negotiations on the part of Balthasar Schupp.<ref name=JBSlautHJ/><ref name=JBSlautLAGIS/>\n\n===Hamburg job offer===\nWhile working in [[Osnabr\u00fcck]] during the run-up to the signings of the key documents included in the [[Peace of Westphalia]], Schupp was able to make several trips back home to [[Braubach]]. There were also other brief work-related visits undertaken on behalf of [[Johan Oxenstierna |Count Oxenstierna]]. It was during a visit to [[Wismar]] (which following its military occupation in 1628 had become the administrative centre of [[Swedish Wismar|Sweden's]] [[Dominions of Sweden|German possessions]], that he made a brief diversion to [[History of Hamburg#Modern History|Hamburg]], which at the time was one of the largest and most economically dynamic cities in [[German language|German-speaking]] protestant northern Europe. At the time of his visit the senior clerical job at the church of [[St. James' Church, Hamburg|St. James (''\"Hauptkirche St. Jacobi\"'')]] had recently fallen vacant, through the death on 16 July 1648 of [[:de:Severin Schl\u00fcter|Severin Schl\u00fcter]]. St.James' was one of Hamburg's five principal churches, and the church administrators were eager to win over Balthasar Schupp, whose international public profile as a preacher among opinion formers seems to have been much enhanced through his work in [[Osnabr\u00fcck]] alongside [[Johan Oxenstierna |Oxenstierna]]. Schupp was nevertheless still relatively unknown to most members of the congregation and it was decided, with the approval of the [[:de:Hamburgische B\u00fcrgerschaft#B\u00fcrgerliche Kollegien|city fathers]], to break with precedent by inviting Schupp to deliver a \"test sermon\". [[:de:Johannes M\u00fcller (Pastor)|Pastor Johannes M\u00fcller]], a notable theologian and a church minister with his own assigned pulpit at [[St. James' Church, Hamburg|St. James' Church]], confirmed that the candidate was \"theologically sound\", and backed up his judgement by agreeing that Schupp might use his own pulpit for the test sermon, which was duly delivered on 5 September 1648 (a Tuesday). Although Schupp was directly after this called back to [[Osnabr\u00fcck]] in connection with his diplomatic duties, it would appear from the way his career unfolded during 1649 that his test sermon was well received.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\nBy this time Schupp no longer had any intention of returning to his job in Braubach. In the short term his diplomatic duties kept him from accepting a new position in Hamburg (or anywhere else), but negotiations continued. At Schupp's request, [[John of Hesse-Braubach|Landgraf Johann]] indeed wrote a letter of recommendation on his behalf to the city fathers. The reply which the mayor and city councillors sent the Landgraf survives.  It is dated 8 December 1648 and includes the assurance that the city fathers had passed the landgraf's letter on to the gentlemen of [[St. James' Church, Hamburg|St. James' Church]], who would take it into consideration in their forthcoming deliberations. It would appear from the correspondence that Schupp's backers for the job were by this time encountering irritation and impatience on the part of the Hamburg congregation over the delays that had arisen from Schupp's continuing diplomatic responsibilities. His own appeal and reputation, had meanwhile been further enhanced by the favourable reactions of the assembled diplomats to his sermon at the service of thanksgiving, held at [[Osnabr\u00fcck]] on 25 October 1648, following the treaty signings the previous day.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\n===Alternative offers===\nBy the early part of 1649 Schupp was faced with an attractive list of competing job offers. Swedish friends had arranged that he should move to [[Bremen Cathedral|Bremen]] as [[:de:Domprediger|\"Domprediger\" (''literally, \"cathedral preacher\"'']]) although the actual duties and responsibilities involved would have been wider than a pedantic interpretation of the title would suggest. His Bremen portfolio would also, for instance, include duties as \"Superintendent der Landgemeinden\" (responsible for rural communities in the (Protestant) [[:de:Generaldi\u00f6zese Bremen-Verden|General Diocese of]] [[Bremen-Verden]].<ref name=JBSlautCB/>   A competing offer came from the [[Prince-Bishopric of M\u00fcnster|church authorities of M\u00fcnster]] (which as a result of the [[Peace of Westphalia]] reverted to Catholicism in 1648 despite the strength of Protestant sentiment in the region).  The [[M\u00fcnster]] offer was for the position of [[Superintendent (ecclesiastical)|Superintendent General]] of the [[Prince-Bishopric of M\u00fcnster|Prince-Bishopric]] and was accompanied by an assurance that he would enjoy a higher income than might await him in [[Hamburg]]. Although Schupp no doubt gave these competing offers proper consideration, he concluded that \"for the education of my children and a number of other benefits, it seemed to me that a pastoral role in Hamburg would be better than a grand title somewhere else\".<ref name=JBSlautCB/>{{efn |\"Wegen Education meiner Kinder und anderer Commodit\u00e4ten halber deuchte mich, es sei ein Pastorat zu Hamburg besser, als anderswo ein gro\u00dfer Titel\".}}\n\n===Decision time===\nOn 2 February 1649 Schupp was unanimously elected to take up the pastoral post in [[St. James' Church, Hamburg|Hamburg]], and the next day the Hamburg sent him a letter informing him of their decision and inviting him to make his appearance among them on the Friday preceding [[Palm Sunday]], which that year meant 16 March 1649. At the same time the Hamburg Senate wrote to the royal Swedish legation at [[M\u00fcnster]], formally confirming their request for his release from his work for the Swedes.  Schupp accepted the job, and the Swedish release arrived without more ado. He appears to have missed the Palm Sunday appointment, however.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\nBefore taking up his New job Schupp returned up-[[Rhine|river]] to collect his family. Along the way he stopped off at [[Darmstadt]] in order to take his leave of his former employer and benefactor [[George II, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt|Landgraf Georg II]] of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt |Hesse-Darmstadt]] in person. Returning north towards Braubach from Darmstadt involved passing through [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]], where he was intercepted by a courier with a message from the Protestant community in [[Augsburg]] urging him to abandon his Hamburg plans, and instead to accept a position in Augsburg. The offer was a tempting one, not least because it would have enabled him to progress directly his [[Christoph Helvig|(first) father-in-law's]] work on education reform. There was also a threat from a \"God-fearing countess\" (probably Marie Magdalene, the widowed Countess of Lippe: 1606\u20131671) that if he persisted with the move to Hamburg and rejected the Augsburg offer she would personally make it her business to ensure that he would not go short of grief and tribulation.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>{{efn |\"... allein ich sorge, ihr werdet in eurer Hoffnung betrogen werden, und wenn ihr die Augsburger verlasset, so wird es euch an Kreuz und Tr\u00fcbsal nicht ermangeln.\"<ref name=JBSlautCB/>}}   Having already accepted the Hamburg post, however, Schupp decided to stick with it. The threatened tribulation was not to be foregone:  during the early part of that summer in [[Braubach]] his family was struck down with illness which seems to have been a version of the all-too familiar plague.  Departure was delayed by several months, and it was not till July 1649 that Schupp was able to relocate, with his family, to [[Hamburg]]  and take up his new post.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\nBetween 1649 and his death in 1661 Johann Balthasar Schupp served as chief minister (''\"Hauptpastor\"'') at [[St. James' Church, Hamburg]], where he quickly became known for the power of his preaching.<ref name=JBSlautHJ/><ref name=\"Scherf2019\">{{cite book|author=Joachim Scherf|title=Johann Balthasar Schupp|work=Junger Tag: 510 geistliche Morgenlieder und -gedichte aus 5 Jahrhunderten|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cEvADwAAQBAJ&pg=PA89|date=26 November 2019|publisher=BoD \u2013 Books on Demand|isbn=978-3-7494-3758-0|page=89}}</ref>\n\n===Hamburg years===\nOn Friday 20 July 1649 Balthasar Schupp was installed in his new office by [[:de:Johannes M\u00fcller (Pastor)|Pastor M\u00fcller]] who had, it seems, taken charge during the interregnum at [[St. James' Church, Hamburg|the \"Hauptkirche\"]].<ref name=JBSlautLMU/>   Later a serious rivalry would emerge between the two men.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\nBy now aged not quite 40 Schupp was already richly experienced, possessing more knowledge of the ways of the world than almost anyone else. He had also lived long enough to have formed strong convictions concerning virtually everything that happened, always firmly and consistently based on his Protestant world view. He was determined that the centrality of Christin faith in human existence should always be taken seriously. In these and other respects he may be compared to [[Philipp Spener]] (1635-1705) and the [[Pietism|Pietists]] who came to the fore during the second half of the seventeenth century. Schupp was not exactly a typical churchman-scholar, although he certainly possessed an abundance of knowledge, was well read, and blessed with a formidable memory. His more remarkable defining gifts involved the effectiveness of his communication skills, whether in negotiation with great men or in delivering a sermon to a church congregation. In that respect he was without question the right man in the right job.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\nSchupp was very conscious of the burden of responsibilities that came with his office. There was some time for writing, but it is nevertheless no coincidence that whereas he had hitherto published only in [[Latin]], works published during his eleven Hamburg years appeared in [[Geman language|German]]. That transition alone would be enough to secure him a place in the history of German literature. He was, at least initially, able to limit his official work. He was required to preach three sermons a week, on Sundays, Wednesdays and Fridays.  Sometimes there were also prayer sessions to be conducted on Thursdays.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>   It was for the sermons, however, that he became known. It was normal for Lutheran pastors to use their sermons to launch attacks on Jews, Catholics, Calvinists and atheists. Schupp did not do that. The focus of his criticism was not on cohorts of people defined by shared religious beliefs, but on the sins and follies of his own fellow-citizens.  In their style his sermons did not follow the traditional format of a formulaic and scholarly treatise. Instead his syntax was fresh, contemporary and compelling. He would use examples from the everyday lives of his listeners, introducing anecdotes and even jokes.  Schupp employed these devices and techniques not only when addressing his own congregations, but also when appearing as a guest preacher in other churches nearby, greatly swelling congregations in the process.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\nHis approach was, by the standards of the times, truly innovative, and by many criteria highly successful. But not everyone was impressed.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>   There were those who interpreted rebukes in his sermons as personal insults and other who thought their life choices were no business of this tiresome preacher. From fellow clerics, steeped in the traditions of a more baroque approach to sermons and written religious pieces, came the criticism that the colloquial syntax of his delivery was inconsistent with the serious purposes of a sermon - any sermon.<ref name=JBSsecondoEM/>  It soon became evident that as his sermons became ever more widely discussed, Schupp would have to learn to face criticism from both wings of the Christian faith among the good Protestant citizens of Hamburg.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\n===Bereavement and remarriage===\nPersonal tragedy struck on 12 June 1650 when Anna Elisabeth, his wife, died, possibly following a long period of poor health. His second marriage was to Sophie Eleonore Reincking and took place on 10 November 1651. She was a daughter of [[Dietrich Reinkingk]], a friend from Schupp's time as a diplomat in Osnabr\u00fcck whose fortunes had been enhanced after his friend and employer [[Frederick III of Denmark|Prince Frederick]] succeeded to the throne of [[Denmark]] towards the end of 1648.  Dietrich Reincking was no longer a senior diplomat representing [[Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen|Bremen]]:  he was the Danish chancellor. The poet-pastor [[Johann Rist]] honoured both Schupp's bereavement and his second marriage with a warmly sympathetic poem, indicating that the two men were already in contact with one another.  There were those who surmised that Schupp's marriage to his second wife was less amicable than his first marriage had been, but these are countered with suggestions that these negative reports were no more than malicious rumours put about by rival churchmen and others who found Schupp threatening or annoying.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\n===Authorship===\nIt was probably in 1654 that Balthasar Schupp started to produce a string of written pieces in the German language that are, for scholars of [[Satire|satirical writing]], his most important and enduring contribution. Of those pieces for which the date can be ascertained, the first was \"Der lobw\u00fcrdige L\u00f6w\" (''loosely, \"The commendable Lion\"''{{efn |The text was purportedly was an extended letter of congratulation addressed to a friend on the occasion of the man's marriage.   In it Schupp praises the lion as a model exemplar for the husband to follow.  It has been suggested by a modern scholar that the lion may also have been the [[Leo (astrology)|bridgegroom's astrological sign]].}}), which was an extended letter of congratulation addressed to Schupp's friend Marcus Pensin in [[Stade]] (just to the west of [[Hamburg]]) in celebration of Pensin's marriage to Catharine, the daughter of the [[:de:Kollegium der Oberalten|\"Oberalt\"]] Hinrich Schwelund. The ceremony itself is known to have taken place at [[St. James' Church, Hamburg|St. James' church]]  on 30 January 1654.<ref name=LobLoew>{{cite web|url=https://haab-digital.klassik-stiftung.de/viewer/image/1730925219/985/LOG_0035/|pages=971-978 |author1=Johann Balthasar Schupp|author2=Anton Meno (which was one of many pseudonyms used by Balthasar Schupp)|title=Der Lobw\u00fcrdige L\u00f6w/ Einem vornehmen Freund zu Ehren/ eylend abgemahlet. |work=Doct: Joh: Balth: Schuppii Schrifften |publisher= Klassik Stiftung Weimar (Herzogin Anna Amalia Bibliothek: digital collection)|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref>   This was followed by \"Der rachgierige Lucidor\" (''\"Vindictive Lucidor\"'').

The commissioners requested, on behalf of the ministry that Schupp should (1) not produce theological writing under pseudonyms, (2) avoid the printing of any [[biblical apocrypha]], (3) submit anything that he wrote to the [[:de:Senior (Kirche)|church \"seniors\"]] so that it might be censored and (4) avoid including fables, jokes and funny stories in connection with phrases from [[Religious text |Holy Scripture]]. According to the report of the encountered that was produced by the [[:de:Senior (Kirche)|\"Senior\"]], [[:de:Johannes M\u00fcller (Pastor)|Pastor M\u00fcller]] (who had also been sitting as chairman of the commission) Schupp agreed to the first two of these requests, but rejected the third and the fourth, insisting that they would have infringed his freedom. The meeting therefore ended with a \"friendly request\" from the commission that Schupp should \"stick to the rules\" (''\"intra terminos bleiben\"'').<ref name=JBSlautCB/>   Although this is the most formal disciplinary exercise to which Schupp was subjected in connection with his writing, it was only the first of a series of confrontations with the church authorities involving Schupp during his final four years.<ref name=JBSlautHJ/>\n\n===Absence of clerical rapprochement===\nAssuming [[:de:Senior (Kirche)|\"Senior\"]], [[:de:Johannes M\u00fcller (Pastor)|Pastor M\u00fcller]] report was a complete ones, none of the commissioners who interviewed Balthasar that [[Michaelmas]] thought to ask him if there were any other Schupp pamphlets currently at the printers. There were. \"Salomo oder Regentenspiegel\" (\"Salomo or Regent's mirror\" - published under the pseudonym \"Antenor\")<ref name=Salomo>{{cite web|url=https://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs2/object/display/bsb10770684_00001.html|title=Salomo, oder Regentenspiegel|author=Schupp, Johann Balthasar |publisher=Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, M\u00fcnchen |accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> and \"Freund in der Noth\" (''\"Friend in need\"'' - published under the author's own name)<ref name=\"Schupp165801\">{{cite book|author=Johann Balthasar Schupp|title=Freund in der Noth |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WvJGAAAAcAAJ&pg=PP12|year=1658|pages=}}</ref> both appeared just a few weeks later. \"Freund in der Noth\" was probably written on or shortly before 16 August 1657. \"Salomo\" was probably written a little earlier. Only the \"Afterword to the reader\" at the end of \"Salomo\" was clearly written after the [[Michaelmas]] hearing.<ref name=JBSlautCB/><ref name=Salomo/>   The appearance of these pamphlets was seen by the ministers who had participated in the commission as a declaration of war on the part of Schupp, and a campaign was launched against him which may not have destroyed him factually or in the eyes of history, but which nevertheless sapped his energies and caused him very great aggravation.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\n===A certain format: a certain approach===\nBy this time the character and pattern of Schupp's pamphlets was becoming clear. He himself defined them as \"small tracts\" (''\"Tract\u00e4tchen\"''):  they were produced in the smallest of the standard publication formats of the time ([[:de:Duodezformat |Duodezformat]]). It is clear that they were eagerly sought out by readers, since there were many reprints produced over relatively short periods of time.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>  They all deliver Schupp's personal views with uncompromising confidence and flair, and concern a range of topics that cover both public and private concerns. They are attractively written, but sometimes show a certain digressive tendency and are sometimes peppered with anecdotes which are not infrequently taken from the author's own life. Schupp's pamphlets can be broadly divided into two types:  there are tracts which edify (such as \"Die Predigt\" (''\"The sermon\"''), \"Der geplagte Hiob\" (''\"Plagued [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]]\"''), \"Die Krankenw\u00e4rterin\" (''\"The nurse\"''), \"die Litanei\" and \"Golgotha\") and there are those which Schupp himself classified as \"political writings\" which were primarily focused on public issues.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>   These frequently demonstrate an engaging interplay of the frivolous and the serious. There are many instances of savage [[satire]] attacking public grievances, such as [[:de:Pennalismus|pennalism (abusive exploitation unequal employer:apprentice/student relations)]] and idiocies in universities and schools, systems and the hankering after what is new and \"strange\".<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\n===Intensifying confrontation===\nIn the aftermath of the [[Thirty Years' War|war]], the aggressive satire of Schupp's later years was part of a broader trend, supported by increased public literacy and a rapid growth in the availability of printing presses. Others attacking the status quo with similar fervour included [[Johann Michael Moscherosch]], [[:de:Johann Lauremberg|Johann Lauremberg]] and [[:de:Joachim Rachel (Pastor, um 1600)|Joachim Rachel]]. For the political and religious establishments the attacks were more threatening precisely because of their popularity bordering at times on populism. After the appearance on the streets of \"Salomo oder Regentenspiegel\" (\"Salomo or Regent's mirror\" - published under the pseudonym \"Antenor\")<ref name=Salomo/> and \"Freund in der Noth\" (''\"Friend in need\"'' - published under the author's own name)<ref name=\"Schupp165801\"/> at the end of 1657 ministers of the Hamburg church establishment decided they needed inspiration and reassurance from the world of academe.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\nOn 12 November 1657 the Hamburg pastors sent out two letters to the Theology Faculties at the [[University of Strasbourg| Strasbourg]] and [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|Wittenberg]] in which they sought authoritative answers to two questions:\n*  Was it right that a doctor of Theology who was also a cleric of the Lutheran church with responsibility over a large congregation and parish should preach and have printed witticisms, fables, satires and ridiculous anecdotes?<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n*  The such a man should not defer to privately conveyed rebukes, but should react with contemptuous attacks, derision and blasphemy against colleagues, rather than desisting from the conduct complained of?\nThe answers came back from [[Strasbourg]] and a week later from [[Wittemberg]], and were read out to conventions of the assembled clerics on 15 and 22 January 1658. The learned gentlemen of the university theology faculties agreed that Schupp's conduct described in the first question was not right. On the second question, reflecting their Lutheran credentials, the men from then university recommended that if nothing else worked, then the clerics should turn to the secular government.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\nSchupp was now invited for a further meeting with a delegation of senior Hamburg clergy. His request that he might know in advance what questions he should be prepared to answer was refused. He therefore in turn refused to meet the clerical delegation. The church ministers now turned to what nineteenth century sources identify as [[Government of Hamburg|the Hamburg senate]] (generally referred to before 1861 as the \"Rath\" or city council). They found that Schupp had already lodged a plaint against the church authorities. On 27 January 1658 Balthasar Schupp attended an interview with [[Government of Hamburg|the city fathers]].  The councillors made three principal demands:  Schupp should not mention their meeting nor the dispute behind it from the pulpit; secondly, he should not have any more of his satirical pieces printed in Hamburg; and thirdly, he should attend a meeting with the senior clergy and resolve his differences with the Hamburg church establishment. Schupp agreed to the first two demands, but said he would not attend any meeting with the church authorities without first being able to inspect the advice that they had received from the universities. The next day the church representatives rejected that demand.  At the same time they came up with their own demand that the city councillors should arrange an oral disputation between representatives of the two sides. The disputation, was to be supervised and arbitrated by represntatives from the city council (senate).<ref name=JBSlautCB/> \n\n===Resolution by disputation?===\nThe disputation was quickly arranged: it took place on 10 February 1658. [[:de:Senior (Kirche)|\"Senior\"]], [[:de:Johannes M\u00fcller (Pastor)| M\u00fcller]], on behalf of the church authorities, applied for the councillors to hand over a copy of the plaint against them which Schupp had lodged with the city fathers the previous month. He demanded that Schupp should be required to expunge the fables, jokes and humorous anecdotes from his sermons and from his printed pamphlets. He then asked what further steps might be taken to remedy the aggravation caused:  it turned out that M\u00fcller's question was rhetorical. The best solution, he continued, would be for the senior clerics to issue a document in which the questions at issue might be settled once and for all.<ref name=JBSlautCB/> \n\nThe chairman of the presiding delegation of councillors refused to hand over a copy of Schupp's complaint against the church authorities. He undertook to place the other two substantive demands before the full council for consideration.<ref name=JBSlautCB/> \n\nOm 26 February 1658 Schupp appeared before a reconvened \"Commission of the Ministry\".   The parties were probably taking part at the direction of the city councillors. Schupp again refused to provide the panel of churchmen with a copy of the complaint against the church authorities which he had previously lodged with the city fathers, insisting that he no longer had a copy of it. On the more substantive issue concerning the demands that he should change the way he preached and the contents of his published tracts, he referred his accusers to the record of the commission's hearing from when he had previous appeared on September 29, 1657. This had been drafted by [[:de:Johannes M\u00fcller (Pastor)|Pastor M\u00fcller]]. He would not submit his sermons or tracts to the church authorities for \"correction\".   There was nothing in them that he wished to change.   Even if he were reduced to begging on the streets, his sermons and tracts were personal matters that were only answerable to himself and not subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission: \"es w\u00e4ren eine Sachen supra nostram crepidam\". The February 26, 1658 hearing produced a total lack of agreement, and appeared to demonstrate that agreement would probably be impossible. The hearing appears to have ended in an atmosphere of heightened acrimony. Shortly after that the city council put an end to the dispute with an Amnesty Decree which imposed a requirement of silence on both parties. Although this put an end to the public warring, the underlying disagreements remained unaffected. By this time Schupp's tracts had nevertheless become less contentious. \"Die Krankenw\u00e4rterin:  oder Auslegung des heiligen Vaterunser, wie man es mit armen, einf\u00e4ltigen kranken Leuten beten kann\" (''loosely, \"The nurse, or interpretation of 'The Lord's Prayer' so that you can pray with poor simple people who are ill\"'') was written during [[Advent]] in 1657:  the first printed versions appeared during 1658.<ref name=JBSlautCB/><ref name=\"Schupp1684\">{{cite book|author=Johann Balthasar Schupp|title=Die Krankenw\u00e4rterin|work=Lehrreiche Schrifften, Deren sich Beydes Geist- als Weltliche, we\u00df Standes und Alters sie auch sind, n\u00fctzlich gebrauchen k\u00f6nnen: In f\u00f6rmliche Ordnung zusammen getragen, und mit zwey Registern versehen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r2xgAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA444 |year=1658 |publisher=Wust |pages=444\u2013469}}</ref>\n\n===\"Seven evil spirits\"===\n\"Sieben b\u00f6se Geister, welche heutiges Tages Knechte und M\u00e4gde regieren und verf\u00fchre\" (''loosely, \"Seven evil spirits which these days rule over and seduce household servants of both sexes\"'') was written after 8 June 1657 and first printed before 5 April 1658.<ref name=\"Schupp165802\">{{cite book|author=Johann Balthasar Schupp|title=Sieben b\u00f6se Geister, welche heutiges Tages Knechte und M\u00e4gde regiren und verf\u00fchren|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9vJeHTJzbJAC&pg=PP1 |year=1658 |publisher= Georg Pappen|pages=}}</ref>   This tract discusses issues of the time involving household servants and tries to find ways to improve the situation. It clearly belongs to the \"political\" category rather than the \"edifying\" of Schupp's pamphlets, but in pursuit of its serious purpose it follows to a serious approach, even if it is still not entirely free of fables and anecdotes.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>   In this tract Schupp at several points made free use of material that had already appeared in \"Gesindeteufel\" by Peter Glaser, which had appeared in 1564. It was not the first time that tracts by Schupp had featured what would in the twenty-first century be construed as plagiarism, but it was a particularly egregious example. Earlier instances had, perhaps been protected from criticism by the eccentric and witty terms in which they had been couched. Maybe by 1658 Schupp had simply accumulated more enemies among literary elites. Either way, on this occasion the blatant plagiarism triggered a literary feud that over time became strikingly toxic. \"Der B\u00fccherdieb gewarnt und ermahnt\" (''\"The book thief admonished and warned\"'') was the unfriendly dedication appearing at the front of an edition of the tract dated 14 March 1658 which was apparently intended for distribution at that year's Frankfurt Easter Fair. Till now Schupp had apparently been untroubled when editions of his tracts were published without his authorisation, but now he turned his energies to opposing these \"pirate\" editions which seem rapidly to have acquired the character of an orchestrated anti-Schupp campaign, conducted through the printed word.<ref name=JBSlautCB/> \n\n===Feuding===\nDuring the summer of 1658 a combative tract appeared under the title \"Der B\u00fccherdieb Antenor\" (''\"The book thief Antenor\" - Antenor was one of Schupp's most frequently used pseudonyms''). The authors' names were given as Nectarius Butyrolambius and Ambrosius Mellilambius, who gave themselves the additional soubriquet \"Arzneikunst Liebhabern\" (''loosely, \"Medical artistry enthusiasts\"''). The publisher of the initial print-run was identified as \"Pieter Jansoon\" of Amsterdam. In fact, two editions were printed one directly after the other. A copy, which may be of a first edition, survives in the [[Berlin State Library |Berlin library]]{{efn |library reference Bm 8530:  Titel und 58 S. 12\u00b0}}   The tract was a screed of crude personal abuse against Balthasar Schupp. Any shortage of subtlety in the text is more than balanced by savagery. The true identity of the author has never been pinned down, although two centuries later a consensus had emerged that the author was probably Schupp's old clerical antagonist, [[:de:Johannes M\u00fcller (Pastor)|Pastor Johannes M\u00fcller]], and that furthermore Schupp knew it. In reality, Schupp's opinion of its authorship seems to have shifted over time, and may have been more nuanced.<ref name=JBSlautCB/><ref name=\"Autor2014\">{{cite book|author=ohne Autor|title=Schuppius|work=Real-Enzyklop\u00e4die f\u00fcr protestantische Theologie und Kirche: 13.

(There are several other pages that for some purposes merit closer attention, however.) |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YCRMAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA4 |year=1659|page=94}}</ref>   What does become apparent is that, regardless of his opinions on the authorship, Schupp was powerfully affected by \"Der B\u00fccherdieb Antenor\":  the book preoccupied him for several years.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\nIn December 1660 in \"der Litanei\" (printed in 1661, the last of his tracts to appear before he died) Schupp quoted an utterance from [[:de:Johannes M\u00fcller (Pastor)|Pastor M\u00fcller]] in a manner which implied that he thought it unlikely that M\u00fcller agreed with the sentiments of \"Butyrolambius\":  it is possible that by this time his opinion on the likely identity of Butyrolambius had shifted. In any case, although \"Butyrolambius\" was clearly aware of the various sessions that had taken place involving Balthasar Schupp and M\u00fcller's \"Commission of the Ministry\", the information about them that is contained in \"Der B\u00fccherdieb Antenor\" is not sufficiently accurate to support the view that it had come directly from [[:de:Johannes M\u00fcller (Pastor)|M\u00fcller himself]]. The evidence adduced in support of M\u00fcller having been the author (or one of the authors) of \"Der B\u00fccherdieb Antenor\" is very far from conclusive.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\nAccording to an old chronicle, on 31 October 1658 Schupp took a copy of \"Der B\u00fccherdieb Antenor\" into his pulpit at [[St. James' Church, Hamburg|Hamburg]] and used a sermon to complain to his congregation about the treatment he had been accorded in it by \"Butyrolambius\". By the time the Hamburg church establishment had used their influence to ensure that Schupp could no longer find a printer in [[Hamburg]] for his pamphlets<ref name=JBSlautLMU/> which instead were now being printed in Wolfenb\u00fcttel ([[Dithmarschen]]). In December 1658 Schupp took a trip to Wolfenb\u00fcttel, where he made the time to compose not one but two pamphlets on the offending [[pasquinade]]. The shorter of them, \"Relation aus dem Parnasso\", was printed in Wolfenb\u00fcttel that same month. The second of them, \"Calender\", is a more considered but no less passionate refutation, comprising more than 100 pages.  It includes the date 20 December 1658 below text on the final page, but on the title page at the front, the year of printing in (what appears to be) the first edition is shewn as 1659.<ref name=\"Schupp165901\"/>   He also prepared a third refutation text in response to \"Der B\u00fccherdieb Antenor\", under the  title \"Pr\u00fcfung des Geistes Nectarii Butyrolambii\" (''loosely, \"Critical review of the spirit of Nectarius Butyrolambius\"'').   This was referenced in both of the first two, but it seems that it was never printed.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\nSchupp's sermon on 1 January 1659 was particularly offensive in its condemnation of the church ministerial establishment.   Shortly after this the city council, exasperated by the continuing feuding between Schupp and his fellow pastors, issued him with a warning.  By the end of January \"Calender\"<ref name=\"Schupp165901\"/> had appeared in the book shops, and the Hamburg pastors reacted by submitting to the city council a detailed submission on 27 January 1659.   All their objections to Schupp's conduct were set out again: \"...such aggravating matters and the major disruption to our church, as well as the [resulting] grievance condition of the [Hamburg church] ministry is no longer conscionable\"{{efn |\"...solchem \u00e4rgerlichen Wesen und gro\u00dfer Zerr\u00fcttung unserer Kirche, wie auch dem betr\u00fcbten Zustande des Ministerii nicht l\u00e4nger zuzusehen\"}}.   Although the reaction of the city fathers is unknown, something of it can be inferred from Schupp's subsequent actions.<ref name=JBSlautCB/>\n\n===Moving on?===\nAbout six months after that Balthasar Schupp's tract \"Abgen\u00f6thigte Ehrenrettung\" appeared, with a dedication addressed, by name, to each of the Hamburg city councillors.   In it Schupp refutes again the allegations against him.<ref name=JBSlautCB/><ref name= \"Schupp1663\">{{cite book |author=Johann Balthasar Schupp|title=Doct: Ioh: Balth: Schuppii Schrifften |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ocM-AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA625|year=1663|publisher=&#91;VI-&#93; 992 p., frontispice, portrait. &#91;Acq.&#93; |pages=625\u2013689}}</ref>\n\n===More pamphlet attacks===\nMeanwhile another literary opponent came onto the scene.   \"Discurs de republica academica\" was printed in [[Leipzig]] in 1659.   In it the author, identified as Master Bernhard Schmid, produced a systematic refutation of  \"Freund in der Noth\"<ref name=\"Schupp165801\"/>   References also appear to a third opponent who had printed a tract in Leipzig, this time attacking \"Calender\".<ref name=\"Schupp165901\"/>   In response to this attack (authorship of which remains unknown) Schupp produced a \"Eilfertiges Sendschreiben an den Calenderschreiber zu Leipzig\" (''loosely, \"Urgent letter to the Leipzig 'Calender' writer\"'') which was printed in [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]], still in 1659.<ref name=JBSlautCB/><ref name=\"Schupp165902\">{{cite book |author= Johann Balthasar Schupp|title=Eilfertiges Sendschreiben an den Kalenderschreiber zu Leipzig |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IChDAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA1|year=1659|publisher=de Leeu|pages=1\u201348}}</ref>\n\n===Final years===\nDespite Balthasar Schupp's background in education, it was not till the next year that Schupp committed his thoughts on the schools and universities to one of his tracts.

S. Amudhan]] and produced by [[S. Sashikanth]]. A sequel to the successful ''[[Thamizh Padam]]'' (2010), the film stars [[Shiva (actor)|Shiva]], [[Sathish]], [[Disha Pandey]], and [[Iswarya Menon]]. The music was composed by [[Kannan (music director)|Kannan]] with cinematography by [[Gopi Amarnath]] and editing by [[T. S. Suresh]]. The film released on 13 July 2018.\n\n== Plot ==\nShiva, the universal cop, has left the police department and has returned to his hometown of Cinemapatti(Shiva's village). He is brought back in to resolve a crisis. Once the situation is handled, he is asked to join the department by [[Police Commissioner]] Yezhusaamy, but he refuses and walks away. P, a dreaded don who poses a threat to society, kills Shiva's wife Priya by using a cell phone bomb. Shiva is forced to rejoin the police department. Meanwhile, Shiva is finding a girl to marry on his grandmother's request. His conditions for a girl are that he wants a [[loosu ponnu]] (a bubbly but crazy girl). He sees Ramya and assumes that she is crazy since she went into a mental hospital van. With the help of his friends, he proposes to her, and she agrees his love.\n\nShiva learns that P has fixed a bomb somewhere by the clues which were given by P's henchman Wasim Khan. Shiva finds that P has fixed a bomb in a bus. He comes to know that P has fixed the bomb such that if the bus is driven less or more than five kilometers per hour, it will explode. However, Shiva saves the people inside the bus. Wasim is killed by Ritika, P's henchwoman. Shiva then discovers that there was someone in the department who is informing P about their ideas. He discovers and kills Inbashekhar, the mole, and is seemingly suspended.\n\nShiva realizes that Ramya is not crazy but a [[ psychiatrist]], and breaks up with her. His friends advise him that he needs to reunite with her. He decides to, but Ramya has left for America. Shiva also goes there to find her, and they reunite in [[Central Park]]. Then, it is revealed that Shiva went on a mission in America so that he could catch P, and that he was not suspended. When the mission is in progress, Ramya is kidnapped and killed by P. Back in Chennai, Shiva is very sad about Ramya's death. His grandmother asks him to take her to the cemetery. She took some promises which were to kill P, marry a beautiful girl than Ramya(the girl he loved and which died), and to give her a grandson.\n\nShiva sketches a plan to catch P by [[Legal tender#Demonetization|demonetising]] 500 and 1000 rupee notes with the help of the government. He goes to a temple to attend his friend Bharath's marriage. There, he meets Gayathri, a lookalike of Ramya, and gets shocked. He proposes to her in the next two minutes when he sees her. The demonetisation forces P to stand at an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] queue because he had a lakh crores of 1000 rupee notes. Shiva executes his plan perfectly, but P escapes. Shiva catches him at his Kovalam [[beach resort]]. He kills him, but P comes alive and becomes the [[Chief Minister|CM]] of [[Tamil Nadu]].\n\nBodhi, a saint, calls Shiva and says that P is [[immortality|immortal]]. The enmity between P and Shiva is for 76 generations. In 300 [[Before Christ|BC]], King Adhiyamaan was ruling Kovai. He appointed Piyaar as the dance teacher of the kingdom, but his dance was demonic. Bharathamuni, another dancer whose dance was divine, wanted to do a [[Competitive dance|dance-off]] with Piyaar. Adhiyamaan also said that the winner will get a [[jackfruit]], which will give immortality to the one who eats it, and also his daughter Khaleesi will marry him, but Piyaar's henchmen kill Bharathamuni and his grandmother. As a result, Piyaar gets the jackfruit and becomes immortal.\n\nNow, Shiva needs to go to 1492 BC to win the dance-off with Piyaar. He gets a [[time travel]] watch from a watch mechanic. He goes to 1492 BC, wins the dance-off, Khaleesi, and the jackfruit. He then comes back to 2018, and meets P, who kidnapped Gayathri. He reveals that he ate the jackfruit, and P is no longer immortal. He fights with his henchmen while Gayathri sings. Irritated by her singing, P kills her. Shiva also kills P and is arrested.\n\nIn the post-credits scene, Shiva is released from prison after 25 years, but his grandmother kills him, showing her villainous \"D\" nature, albeit being acquitted in the first film.\n\n== Cast  ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Shiva (actor)|Shiva]] as Shiva, the universal cop and Barathamuni, a dancer in 300 BC who loses the dance-off to Piyaar\n* [[Sathish]] as P (Pandiya), a dreaded don who poses a threat to society, and Piyaar, the dance teacher of Kovai who wins a dance-off against Barathamuni\n* [[Disha Pandey]] as Priya, Shiva's wife who gets killed by P\n* [[Iswarya Menon]] as Ramya, a psychologist whom Shiva falls in love with; Gayathri, Ramya's lookalike; and Khaleesi, Adhiyamaan's daughter\n* [[Kalairani]] (replacing [[Paravai Muniyamma]] from the first film) as Shiva's grandmother (D) and Barathamuni's grandmother \n* [[Santhana Bharathi]] (replacing [[M.

S. Amudhan]] and produced by [[S. Sashikanth]]. A sequel to the successful ''[[Thamizh Padam]]'' (2010), the film stars [[Shiva (actor)|Shiva]], [[Sathish]], [[Disha Pandey]], and [[Iswarya Menon]]. The music was composed by [[Kannan (music director)|Kannan]] with cinematography by [[Gopi Amarnath]] and editing by [[T. S. Suresh]]. The film released on 13 July 2018.\n\n== Plot ==\nShiva, the universal cop, has left the police department and has returned to his hometown of Cinemapatti(Shiva's village). He is brought back in to resolve a crisis. Once the situation is handled, he is asked to join the department by [[Police Commissioner]] Yezhusaamy, but he refuses and walks away. P, a dreaded don who poses a threat to society, kills Shiva's wife Priya by using a cell phone bomb. Shiva is forced to rejoin the police department. Meanwhile, Shiva is finding a girl to marry on his grandmother's request. His conditions for a girl are that he wants a [[loosu ponnu]] (a bubbly but crazy girl). He sees Ramya and assumes that she is crazy since she went into a mental hospital van. With the help of his friends, he proposes to her, and she agrees his love.\n\nShiva learns that P has fixed a bomb somewhere by the clues which were given by P's henchman Wasim Khan. Shiva finds that P has fixed a bomb in a bus. He comes to know that P has fixed the bomb such that if the bus is driven less or more than five kilometers per hour, it will explode. However, Shiva saves the people inside the bus. Wasim is killed by Ritika, P's henchwoman. Shiva then discovers that there was someone in the department who is informing P about their ideas. He discovers and kills Inbashekhar, the mole, and is seemingly suspended.\n\nShiva realizes that Ramya is not crazy but a [[ psychiatrist]], and breaks up with her. His friends advise him that he needs to reunite with her. He decides to, but Ramya has left for America. Shiva also goes there to find her, and they reunite in [[Central Park]]. Then, it is revealed that Shiva went on a mission in America so that he could catch P, and that he was not suspended. When the mission is in progress, Ramya is kidnapped and killed by P. Back in Chennai, Shiva is very sad about Ramya's death. His grandmother asks him to take her to the cemetery. She took some promises which were to kill P, marry a beautiful girl than Ramya(the girl he loved and which died), and to give her a grandson.\n\nShiva sketches a plan to catch P by [[Legal tender#Demonetization|demonetising]] 500 and 1000 rupee notes with the help of the government. He goes to a temple to attend his friend Bharath's marriage. There, he meets Gayathri, a lookalike of Ramya, and gets shocked. He proposes to her in the next two minutes when he sees her. The demonetisation forces P to stand at an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] queue because he had a lakh crores of 1000 rupee notes. Shiva executes his plan perfectly, but P escapes. Shiva catches him at his Kovalam [[beach resort]]. He kills him, but P comes alive and becomes the [[Chief Minister|CM]] of [[Tamil Nadu]].\n\nBodhi, a saint, calls Shiva and says that P is [[immortality|immortal]]. The enmity between P and Shiva is for 76 generations. In 300 [[Before Christ|BC]], King Adhiyamaan was ruling Kovai. He appointed Piyaar as the dance teacher of the kingdom, but his dance was demonic. Bharathamuni, another dancer whose dance was divine, wanted to do a [[Competitive dance|dance-off]] with Piyaar. Adhiyamaan also said that the winner will get a [[jackfruit]], which will give immortality to the one who eats it, and also his daughter Khaleesi will get married to him, but Piyaar's henchmen kill Bharathamuni and his grandmother. As a result, Piyaar gets the jackfruit and becomes immortal.\n\nNow, Shiva needs to go to 1492 BC to win the dance-off with Piyaar. He gets a [[time travel]] watch from a watch mechanic. He goes to 1492 BC, wins the dance-off, Khaleesi, and the jackfruit. He then comes back to 2018, and meets P, who kidnapped Gayathri. He reveals that he ate the jackfruit, and P is no longer immortal. He fights with his henchmen while Gayathri sings. Irritated by her singing, P kills her. Shiva also kills P and is arrested.\n\nIn the post-credits scene, Shiva is released from prison after 25 years, but his grandmother kills him, showing her villainous \"D\" nature, albeit being acquitted in the first film.\n\n== Cast  ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Shiva (actor)|Shiva]] as Shiva, the universal cop and Barathamuni, a dancer in 300 BC who loses the dance-off to Piyaar\n* [[Sathish]] as P (Pandiya), a dreaded don who poses a threat to society, and Piyaar, the dance teacher of Kovai who wins a dance-off against Barathamuni\n* [[Disha Pandey]] as Priya, Shiva's wife who gets killed by P\n* [[Iswarya Menon]] as Ramya, a psychologist whom Shiva falls in love with; Gayathri, Ramya's lookalike; and Khaleesi, Adhiyamaan's daughter\n* [[Kalairani]] (replacing [[Paravai Muniyamma]] from the first film) as Shiva's grandmother (D) and Barathamuni's grandmother \n* [[Santhana Bharathi]] (replacing [[M.
