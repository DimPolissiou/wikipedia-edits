She was [[2010 Australian federal election|elected]] to [[Parliament of Australia|federal parliament]] in 2010 and took her seat as a [[Australian Senate|Senator]] for [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] on 1 July 2011.  She won re-election at the [[2016 Australian federal election|2016 election]].  In December 2017, she was elected deputy leader of the National Party in place of [[Fiona Nash]], who had been ruled [[2017 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis|ineligible for election]] to the Senate by the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]].  As a consequence of the terms of the Coalition agreement with the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]], Prime Minister [[Malcolm Turnbull]] immediately appointed McKenzie to cabinet as [[Minister for Sport (Australia)|Minister for Sport]], [[Minister for Health (Australia)#List of ministers for rural health|Minister for Rural Health]], and [[Minister for Communications (Australia)#List of ministers for regional communications|Minister for Regional Communications]].  When [[Scott Morrison]] [[2018 Liberal Party of Australia leadership spills|replaced Turnbull]] as Prime Minister, he [[reshuffle]]d the ministry and [[First Morrison Ministry|abolished the latter two positions]]. McKenzie retained the sports portfolio and also became [[Minister for Regional Services, Decentralisation and Local Government]] until the [[2019 Australian federal election|2019 Federal election]], after which she became the first woman to be appointed as [[Minister for Agriculture (Australia)|Minister for Agriculture]].\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2019 election, McKenzie [[Sports rorts affair (2020)|oversaw a controversial $100 million grant program]] that led to claims of [[Pork barrel|pork-barrelling]]. A report by the [[Australian National Audit Office]] stated that the administration of the program \"was not informed by an appropriate assessment process and sound advice.\"  [[Sports Australia]] made determinations as to which applications were most deserving of funding, but the allocation of grants was subsequently determined by ministerial discretion and the Auditor-General's report noted that it was unclear whether this was within McKenzie's legal authority.  The allocations went disproportionately to marginal electorates held by the Coalition or to electorates that the Coalition was targeting in the election and critics alleged she had unlawfully spent taxpayer funds with the aim of improving the coalition's electoral prospects. No evidence was supplied. Morrison ordered an investigation when claims were made that McKenzie had acted with a conflict of interest in directing funding to a club of which she was a member. McKenzie resigned from her positions as Minister for Agriculture and deputy party Leader on 2 February 2020.\n\nPrior to entering politics, McKenzie started a family and then attended [[Deakin University]] as a mature-age student, where she served as the president of the [[Deakin University Student Association|student association]] in 2003.  She stood for the [[House of Representatives (Australia)|House of Representatives]] seat of [[Division of McMillan|McMillan]] at the [[2004 Australian federal election|2004 election]], but was unsuccessful.  Prior to becoming a Senator, McKenzie worked as a school teacher in the [[Gippsland|Gippsland region]] of Victoria and later at [[Monash University]] where she lectured in Education.  Between 2006 and 2009, McKenzie was a junior vice-president of the Victorian branch of the National Party, which she had joined when she was 18 years old. After entering the Senate, McKenzie served as [[List of whips in the Australian Senate|party whip]] from 2013 to 2014.\n\n==Early life==\nMcKenzie was born in [[Alexandra, Victoria]]. She grew up in [[Benalla]], where her mother was a primary school teacher and her father was a dairyman. She attended [[Tintern Grammar]], where she was a house captain and swimming captain. After starting a family, McKenzie began studying at [[Deakin University]] as a mature-age student, completing a double degree in applied science (specialising in human movement) and teaching (specialising in mathematics). She served as the president of the [[Deakin University Student Association]] in 2003.<ref>\"A Degree of Rivalry\", ''[[Sunday Age]]'', 10 August 2003.</ref> McKenzie subsequently taught physical education and mathematics for several years at [[Yarram, Victoria|Yarram Secondary College]], [[Gippsland]].

McKenzie''' (born 27 December 1969) is an Australian politician. She was [[2010 Australian federal election|elected]] to [[Parliament of Australia|federal parliament]] in 2010 and took her seat as a [[Australian Senate|Senator]] for [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] on 1 July 2011.  She won re-election at the [[2016 Australian federal election|2016 election]].  In December 2017, she was elected deputy leader of the National Party in place of [[Fiona Nash]], who had been ruled [[2017 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis|ineligible for election]] to the Senate by the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]].  As a consequence of the terms of the Coalition agreement with the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]], Prime Minister [[Malcolm Turnbull]] immediately appointed McKenzie to cabinet as [[Minister for Sport (Australia)|Minister for Sport]], [[Minister for Health (Australia)#List of ministers for rural health|Minister for Rural Health]], and [[Minister for Communications (Australia)#List of ministers for regional communications|Minister for Regional Communications]].  When [[Scott Morrison]] [[2018 Liberal Party of Australia leadership spills|replaced Turnbull]] as Prime Minister, he [[reshuffle]]d the ministry and [[First Morrison Ministry|abolished the latter two positions]]. McKenzie retained the sports portfolio and also became [[Minister for Regional Services, Decentralisation and Local Government]] until the [[2019 Australian federal election|2019 Federal election]], after which she became the first woman to be appointed as [[Minister for Agriculture (Australia)|Minister for Agriculture]].\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2019 election, McKenzie [[Sports rorts affair (2020)|oversaw a controversial $100 million grant program]] that led to claims of [[Pork barrel|pork-barrelling]]. A report by the [[Australian National Audit Office]] stated that the administration of the program \"was not informed by an appropriate assessment process and sound advice.\"  [[Sports Australia]] made determinations as to which applications were most deserving of funding, but the allocation of grants was subsequently determined by ministerial discretion and the Auditor-General's report noted that it was unclear whether this was within McKenzie's legal authority.  The allocations went disproportionately to marginal electorates held by the Coalition or to electorates that the Coalition was targeting in the election and critics alleged she had unlawfully spent taxpayer funds with the aim of improving the coalition's electoral prospects. No evidence was supplied. Morrison ordered an investigation when claims were made that McKenzie had acted with a conflict of interest in directing funding to a club of which she was a member. McKenzie resigned from her positions as Minister for Agriculture and deputy party Leader on 2 February 2020.\n\nPrior to entering politics, McKenzie started a family and then attended [[Deakin University]] as a mature-age student, where she served as the president of the [[Deakin University Student Association|student association]] in 2003.  She stood for the [[House of Representatives (Australia)|House of Representatives]] seat of [[Division of McMillan|McMillan]] at the [[2004 Australian federal election|2004 election]], but was unsuccessful.  Prior to becoming a Senator, McKenzie worked as a school teacher in the [[Gippsland|Gippsland region]] of Victoria and later at [[Monash University]] where she lectured in Education.  Between 2006 and 2009, McKenzie was a junior vice-president of the Victorian branch of the National Party, which she had joined when she was 18 years old. After entering the Senate, McKenzie served as [[List of whips in the Australian Senate|party whip]] from 2013 to 2014.\n\n==Early life==\nMcKenzie was born in [[Alexandra, Victoria]]. She grew up in [[Benalla]], where her mother was a primary school teacher and her father was a dairyman. She attended [[Tintern Grammar]], where she was a house captain and swimming captain. After starting a family, McKenzie began studying at [[Deakin University]] as a mature-age student, completing a double degree in applied science (specialising in human movement) and teaching (specialising in mathematics). She served as the president of the [[Deakin University Student Association]] in 2003.<ref>\"A Degree of Rivalry\", ''[[Sunday Age]]'', 10 August 2003.</ref> McKenzie subsequently taught physical education and mathematics for several years at [[Yarram, Victoria|Yarram Secondary College]], [[Gippsland]].

The album also helped to spawn many young [[Rapping|MC]]s and gangsta hip hop groups from areas such as [[Compton, California]], and [[South Central Los Angeles]], as many thought they had the same story to tell and the ability to pursue the career track that N.W.A had taken,<ref name=\"Huey\"/> hence the formation of groups such as [[Compton's Most Wanted]].<ref name=mp3.com>[http://www.mp3.com/albums/22123/summary.html Compton's Most Wanted] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213013615/http://www.mp3.com/albums/22123/summary.html |date=December 13, 2007 }}.

This situation persisted over the years with the group's visible head, [[Eazy-E]]. One of the reasons for this was \"[[Fuck tha Police]]\", the highly controversial track from the album that resulted in the FBI and the [[U.S. Secret Service]] sending a letter to Ruthless Records informing the label of their displeasure with the song's message, and that N.W.A was banned from performing at several venues.<ref name=AMG-Bio/><ref name=Eazy-e/> The FBI letter only helped further popularize the album and N.W.A.; In the group's 1990 song \"[[100 Miles and Runnin' (song)|100 Miles and Runnin']]\", while the music video shows the crew running from the police, Dr. Dre raps \"and now the FBI is all over my dick!\" as a response to the FBI's warnings.<ref>{{cite web|title=NWA \u2013 100 Miles And Running Lyrics|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/100-miles-and-running-lyrics-nwa.html|website=MetroLyrics|accessdate=1 April 2015}}</ref> Also, in his 1990 song \"AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted\", Ice Cube mocks the FBI with the line \"With a pay-off, cop gotta lay off, FBI on my dick, stay off\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Ice Cube \u2013 AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted Lyrics|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/amerikkkas-most-wanted-lyrics-ice-cube.html|website=MetroLyrics|accessdate=1 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n\n===Lyrics===\n{{Listen\n |filename     = N.W.A - Fuck Tha Police.ogg\n |title        = \"Fuck tha Police\"\n |description  = One of N.W.A's most well-known and controversial songs\n |filename2    = N.W.A - Straight Outta Compton.ogg\n |title2       = \"Straight Outta Compton\"\n |description2 = The lead single and title track.

Some critics of the album expressed their view that the record glamorized [[Black-on-Black crime]], but others stated that the group was simply showing the reality of living in the areas of [[Compton, California]], and [[South Central Los Angeles]]. Steve Huey in a retrospective review for [[AllMusic]] feels that the lyrics are more about \"raising hell\" than social criticism, but also feels the album is \"refreshingly uncalculated\" due to its humor\u2014something he feels is rare in hardcore rap.<ref name=\"Huey\"/>\n\nMany critics feel that the album's lyrics glamorize gang violence. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' writer [[David Mills (writer)|David Mills]] wrote: \"The hard-core street rappers defend their violent lyrics as a reflection of 'reality'.

The album also helped to spawn many young [[Rapping|MC]]s and gangsta hip hop groups from areas such as [[Compton, California]], and [[South Central Los Angeles]], as many thought they had the same story to tell and the ability to pursue the career track that N.W.A had taken,<ref name=\"Huey\"/> hence the formation of groups such as [[Compton's Most Wanted]].<ref name=mp3.com>[http://www.mp3.com/albums/22123/summary.html Compton's Most Wanted] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213013615/http://www.mp3.com/albums/22123/summary.html |date=December 13, 2007 }}.

Retrieved September 30, 2007.</ref>\n\nBecause of the recurring violent and sexual lyrics and profanity, often specifically directed at governmental organizations such as the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]], N.W.A always enjoyed a particular reputation with [[U.S. Senators]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), as noted in the LP's published notes. This situation persisted over the years with the group's visible head, [[Eazy-E]]. One of the reasons for this was \"[[Fuck tha Police]]\", the highly controversial track from the album that resulted in the FBI and the [[U.S. Secret Service]] sending a letter to Ruthless Records informing the label of their displeasure with the song's message, and that N.W.A was banned from performing at several venues.<ref name=AMG-Bio/><ref name=Eazy-e/> The FBI letter only helped further popularize the album and N.W.A.; In the group's 1990 song \"[[100 Miles and Runnin' (song)|100 Miles and Runnin']]\", while the music video shows the crew running from the police, Dr. Dre raps \"and now the FBI is all over my dick!\" as a response to the FBI's warnings.<ref>{{cite web|title=NWA \u2013 100 Miles And Running Lyrics|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/100-miles-and-running-lyrics-nwa.html|website=MetroLyrics|accessdate=1 April 2015}}</ref> Also, in his 1990 song \"AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted\", Ice Cube mocks the FBI with the line \"With a pay-off, cop gotta lay off, FBI on my dick, stay off\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Ice Cube \u2013 AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted Lyrics|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/amerikkkas-most-wanted-lyrics-ice-cube.html|website=MetroLyrics|accessdate=1 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n\n===Lyrics===\n{{Listen\n |filename     = N.W.A - Fuck Tha Police.ogg\n |title        = \"Fuck tha Police\"\n |description  = One of N.W.A's most well-known and controversial songs\n |filename2    = N.W.A - Straight Outta Compton.ogg\n |title2       = \"Straight Outta Compton\"\n |description2 = The lead single and title track.

Some critics of the album expressed their view that the record glamorized [[Black-on-Black crime]], but others stated that the group was simply showing the reality of living in the areas of [[Compton, California]], and [[South Central Los Angeles]]. Steve Huey in a retrospective review for [[AllMusic]] feels that the lyrics are more about \"raising hell\" than social criticism, but also feels the album is \"refreshingly uncalculated\" due to its humor\u2014something he feels is rare in hardcore rap.<ref name=\"Huey\"/>\n\nMany critics feel that the album's lyrics glamorize gang violence. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' writer [[David Mills (writer)|David Mills]] wrote: \"The hard-core street rappers defend their violent lyrics as a reflection of 'reality'. But for all the gunshots they mix into their music, rappers rarely try to dramatize that reality \u2014 a young man flat on the ground, a knot of lead in his chest, pleading as death slowly takes him in. It's easier for them to imagine themselves pulling the trigger\". However, ''Wichita Eagle-Beacon'' editor Bud Norman noted that \"They [[N.W.A]] don't make it sound like much fun&nbsp;...

Working with fellow Breton farmers, Gourvennec lobbied for improvements to Brittany's infrastructure, including better roads, telephone network, education and port access. By 1972 he had successfully secured funding and work to develop a deep-water[[Port of Bloscon-Roscoff|port at Roscoff]]. Gourvennec had no desire to run a ferry service, but existing operators showed little appetite for the opportunity. \n\nAs was the way of a man known as \"the [[bulldozer]]\", {{citation needed|date=May 2019}} he took the reins and did it himself.\n\nThe company itself began sailings on 2nd January 1973 between [[Roscoff]] in [[Brittany]] and [[Plymouth]] in the South West of England, using the freight ferry ''Kerisnel'' a former Israeli tank carrier. The company's primary aim at that time was to exploit opportunities presented by the UK's entry into the Common Market (forerunner to the EU), to take control away from hated middle-men in Paris and export directly to markets in the United Kingdom. \n\nIn 1974, ''Kerisnel'' was replaced by ''Penn-Ar-Bed'', which carried both passengers and vehicles, and the BAI company adopted the name Brittany Ferries.<ref name=Hoyle&Pinder>{{cite book |editor1-last=Hoyle |editor1-first=B S |editor2-last=Pinder |editor2-first=David |title=European Port Cities in Transition |date=1992 |publisher=Belhaven Press in association with the British Association for the Advancement of Science |location=London |isbn=9780470219263 |page=92}}</ref>  Such was the success of the Plymouth-Roscoff service that a larger ship, ''Cornouailles'', was ordered and entered service in 1977. New routes were developed in the late 1970s, and the company continued to grow. Routes to [[Saint-Malo]], [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]], and [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in Ireland were operated by {{MV|Armorique|1973|2}} and ''Prince of Brittany'', and in the early 1980s a second ship was chartered for the Saint-Malo route. ''[[MV Wickersham|Goelo]]'', an attractive-looking vessel, left the fleet in preparation for the new ship to be introduced in 1982. {{MV|Quiberon||2}} replaced ''Armorique'' for the Santander and Cork services, allowing her to operate alongside ''Prince of Brittany'' on the Saint-Malo route, while ''Cornouailles'' maintained the original routes from Roscoff.\n\n''Benodet'' operated between Plymouth and Roscoff for just one year before being redeployed as part of Brittany Ferries' new venture, [[British Channel Island Ferries|Channel Island Ferries]]. ''Tregastel'' replaced her and continued on the Plymouth to Roscoff route until 1989.  The Cork route was operated by ''Tregastel'' and ''Quiberon'', later to be joined by ''Celtic Pride'', operated by Swansea Cork Ferries, supplying a midweek Cork-Roscoff round trip.\n\nIn 1985, Brittany Ferries further expanded by buying Truckline Ferries, which operated freight-only ships {{MV|Coutances||2}} and ''Purbeck'' between [[Poole]] in United Kingdom and [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]] in France.\n\nIn 1986, Brittany Ferries introduced {{MV|Duc de Normandie||2}}, which operated a new route from Caen to the increasingly popular port of Portsmouth.  The former Roscoff ship ''Cornouailles'' was transferred to the Truckline Ferries route from Poole to Cherbourg, introducing passenger services on this route.  This service was also very successful, and new ships were introduced over the next few years.  Meanwhile, a second (chartered) ship, ''Gotland'' was installed on the Caen service in 1988, as well as the new Truckline Ferries vessel {{MV|Normandie Shipper||2}} in 1989. In addition to the Portsmouth-Caen services, from 1986 a Truckline Ferries ferry ran from Poole to Caen during the summer to cope with the seasonal demand on Brittany's standard ships by holiday makers. However, the introduction of larger ships in 2006, and the sale of the original \"truckliners\", meant that this service was discontinued.\n\nIn 1989, the cruise ferry {{MV|Bretagne||2}} was introduced on the Santander and Cork routes.  She displaced ''Quiberon'', which transferred to the Roscoff route. ''Tregastel'' replaced ''Cornouailles'' on the Poole-Cherbourg Truckline Ferries passenger route along with ''Corbiere'' (formerly ''Benodet'' who had been transferred to [[British Channel Island Ferries|Channel Island Ferries]]).  ''Cornouailles'' was sold to British Channel Island Ferries and was renamed ''Havelet''. A second-hand purchase was introduced on the St Malo route, ''Duchesse Anne''. which was to run alongside ''Armorique''.  This allowed ''Prince of Brittany'' to be transferred to the Caen route under its new name, ''Reine Mathilde''.\n\n===1990s===\nAt the end of 1991, ''Reine Mathilde'' left the fleet ready for the introduction of the new cruise ferry ''Normandie'' on the Caen route. ''Corbiere'' and ''Tregastel'' also stepped down in preparation for the new Truckline Ferries ship, ''Barfleur''.  During 1992, the Truckline Ferries freight vessel, ''Purbeck'', and the St Malo ship ''Armorique'' both stepped down.\n\nIn 1993, the penultimate ship of the 1990s was introduced.  The Val de Loire was purchased from [[TT-Line]] and partially rebuilt for service on the [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]] and Cork routes.  The vessel replaced ''Bretagne'' which transferred to the St Malo route, allowing ''Duchesse Anne'' to operate new services between Poole, St Malo, Cork, Roscoff and Plymouth. Following further financial difficulties in the mid-1990s, these new routes were ended and ''Duchesse Anne'' left the fleet. ''Normandie Shipper'' was also sold, but the ex-Truckline Ferries vessel ''Purbeck'' was later chartered back by the company for use on various routes, primarily Portsmouth-Caen.  In 1999, ''Barfleur'' was repainted in Brittany Ferries colours, ending the Truckline Ferries tradition on the route.\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2001 a new fast ferry service began to operate between Poole and Cherbourg in partnership with [[Condor Ferries]].  The fast ''Normandie Vitesse'' could make the voyage in just over two hours.  In 2002, a new ship, ''Mont St Michel'', was due to enter service between Portsmouth and Caen. ''Duc de Normandie'' was transferred to the Roscoff route in July, whilst ''Quiberon'' was sent to Caen to cover until the new ship arrived. ''Mont St Michel'' was delayed until December however. ''Quiberon'' spent the remainder of the year on the busiest Brittany Ferries route.  She had been with the company for almost 21 years when she was sold in 2003.  In 2004, another new ship, ''Pont-Aven'', was introduced on the Santander & Cork routes.  She could travel much faster than the rest of the fleet, cutting journey times by a quarter. \n\nIn late 2004, the company withdrew ''Duc de Normandie'' from the fleet. ''Bretagne'' transferred to the Roscoff route, leaving ''Val de Loire'' at St Malo. ''Coutances'' was also earmarked for disposal, but then a change of heart resulted in its refit, losing her Truckline Ferries livery in favour of the new Brittany Ferries logo.\n\nMore changes occurred in 2005 with the withdrawal of [[P&O Ferries|P&O]]'s French routes from Portsmouth.  A new fastcraft, ''Normandie Express'' was chartered to operate between Portsmouth and Cherbourg and Caen.  In addition, the Poole-Cherbourg ship ''Barfleur'' was redeployed to operate a triangular service between Portsmouth, Poole and Cherbourg.  A new ship was announced, in part a replacement for ''Coutances''. The ship was named ''Cotentin''. ''Purbeck'' was to have returned from operating in New Zealand and cover the Portsmouth-Cherbourg link but this plan was dropped. ''Barfleur'' returned to the Poole-Cherbourg link in November 2005.\n\nThe former flagship of the fleet (from 1993 until the arrival of ''Mont St Michel'') ''Val de Loire'' left the fleet in February 2006, having been sold to [[DFDS]] and renamed ''King of Scandinavia''. In the meantime, Brittany Ferries had taken up a 2-year charter of the DFDS ship ''Duke of Scandinavia'', which was renamed ''Pont-L'Abb\u00e9'' and ran on the Plymouth-Roscoff route. ''Bretagne'' returned to the Portsmouth-St Malo route. Brittany Ferries also announced a new build for the Plymouth-Roscoff route, to be launched early 2008.  In February 2006 ''Normandie Express'' was brought under the French flag, she was later purchased by the company in early 2007.  Brittany Ferries new freight ship, ''Cotentin'', entered service on 26 November 2007 with the 23:45 Cherbourg-Poole service.  The new ship also operated a weekly service to Santander from Poole. It was announced on 19 December 2007 that the company had purchased ''Pont-L'Abb\u00e9'' from DFDS. On 1 May 2008 ''Coutances'' completed her last sailing for the company - having been with Truckline Ferries for 30 years and with Brittany Ferries since 1985.  In early 2009, ''Armorique'' was launched on the Plymouth-Roscoff route, replacing ''Pont L'Abbe''. For 2009, ''Pont-Aven'' operated a new Portsmouth to Santander service once a week (cutting the previous Plymouth to Santander route to once a week).\n\n===2010s===\nIn late 2009, the new [[Poole]]-[[Santander, Spain|Santander]] freight-only service was deemed a success and the frequency was doubled: there would now be two services a week operated by ''Cotentin''. In November 2009, ''Armorique'' was laid up for the rest of the winter season. Major changes were announced in December 2009. ''Barfleur'' was withdrawn from service at the end of January 2010 after nearly 18 years service on the Poole-[[Cherbourg]] route. The service was temporarily served by ''Armorique'', which came back to service earlier than originally planned. The Poole-Santander service reverted to one sailing a week with ''Cotentin'' covering freight on the Poole-Cherbourg service in the absence of ''Barfleur''. ''Condor Vitesse'' continued to operate one round sailing a day in the summer months between the two ports. ''Cap Finist\u00e8re'' ran between [[Portsmouth]] and Santander twice a week and also operated three round trips a week between Portsmouth and Cherbourg. In September 2010, Brittany Ferries announced plans to serve the Portsmouth\u2013[[Bilbao]] route recently abandoned by P&O Ferries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.traveldaily.co.uk/AsiaPacificNews/Detail.aspx?Section=20510|title=Brittany Ferries saves Portsmouth-Bilbao route|work=Travel News UK|date=27 September 2010|accessdate=8 October 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204012443/http://traveldaily.co.uk/AsiaPacificNews/Detail.aspx?Section=20510|archivedate=4 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The route started on 27 March 2011.\n\nIn February 2011, ''Barfleur'' returned to the Poole-Cherbourg route on a seven-month trial basis after being laid up for a year. Her final crossing of 2011 was 3 October. The return of ''Barfleur'' allowed ''Cotentin'' to run two Poole-Santander trips a week. However, with ''Barfleur'' being laid up again, the Poole-Santander sailings reverted to one trip a week. On 23 March, it was announced that ''Barfleur'' was to be chartered to [[DFDS Seaways]] for use on their [[Dover]]\u2013[[Calais]] route. Her first sailing on the route was on 27 April.\n\nOn 1 April 2011, the new [[Portsmouth International Port]] (PIP) terminal, used by Brittany Ferries, [[LD Lines]] and [[Condor Ferries]], was opened to the public. An official opening ceremony took place on 13 May 2011. This modern, stylish, eco-friendly building replaced the previous terminal building that stood from 1976 until its well needed replacement occurred in 2011.\n\nOn 21 September 2012, Brittany Ferries cancelled sailings indefinitely following two days of wild[[cat]] strikes caused by crew members who were unhappy with changes in working terms and conditions. Meetings took place between management and unions to negotiate the management proposals. A vote was taken on 30 September by union members to decide if the management proposals would be accepted. The crew members accepted the proposal and services resumed on 2 October after 12 days without services. During this period, Brittany Ferries made special arrangements with P&O Ferries and [[MyFerryLink]] to accept Brittany Ferries tickets on the Dover\u2013Calais route; any unused tickets were refunded.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19671784|title=Brittany Ferries services halted 'until further notice'|work=BBC News|date=21 September 2012|accessdate=23 September 2012}}</ref> Services were not affected on the Poole\u2013Cherbourg route which was being operated by [[Condor Ferries]].\n\nThe 2012 season was the last year of the [[Poole]]\u2013[[Cherbourg]] fastcraft operation with [[Condor Ferries]]. For the first time since 2001, the Condor vessel operating the Poole-Cherbourg summer service was ''Condor Express'' rather than ''Condor Vitesse''.\n\nIn May 2013, Brittany Ferries introduced a new route with services from [[Portsmouth]] to [[Le Havre]] using their high-speed vessel, ''Normandie Express''.\n\nIn October 2013, Brittany Ferries' [[freight]] service from [[Poole]]-[[Santander, Spain|Santander]] terminated and ''Cotentin'', which served the route, is now being chartered by [[Stena Line]].\n\nOn 5 November 2013, Christophe Mathieu, deputy managing director of Brittany Ferries and Sandie Dawe, chief executive of [[VisitBritain]], signed an agreement to run a joint marketing campaign designed to attract more French tourists to the UK. The agreement commits both parties to a three-year campaign with a promotional match-funded spend of \u00a31.5 million, and is the first time Brittany Ferries has entered into such an arrangement with Visit Britain.\n\nOn 7 February 2014, Brittany Ferries announced that as from the end of March 2014, it would charter the former Visentini-built [[DFDS Seaways]] {{ship||Norman Voyager}} to operate on [[Le Havre]], Portsmouth and Santander. The vessel was renamed {{MV|Etretat||2}}.\n\nDuring the weekends, the ferry sails on Portsmouth\u2013Santander. Demand for freight capacity is high during the weekend, but also passengers are interested in such a service.\n\nOn weekdays, ''Norman Voyager'', which has been renamed ''Etretat'', sails on Portsmouth\u2013Le Havre, a route that was successful in 2013 when Brittany Ferries introduced the catamaran {{ship|HSC|Normandie Express||2}}. However, after the 2015 summer season, Brittany Ferries pulled ''Normandie Express'' from this route as it was not financially viable. The \"new\" ro-pax ferry ''Etretat'' will sail year-round.\n\nOn 30 January 2015, Brittany Ferries announced that it would charter the [[DFDS Seaways]] vessel {{MS|Sirena Seaways||2}} from the beginning of April 2015 and start service with Brittany Ferries in May 2015, to operate on their successful Portsmouth\u2013Le Havre route, alongside ''Etretat''. It will also operate a twice weekly Portsmouth\u2013Spain service. The ship will be renamed {{MV|Baie de Seine||2}}.\n\nThe company chartered the RoRo vessel, {{ship|MN|Pelican||2}} from Maritime Nantaise for 12 months, with the option of an extension. The vessel has the capacity for around one hundred unaccompanied trailers and twelve drivers and commenced service with Brittany Ferries on 11 February 2016.\n\nOn 24 October 2016, Brittany Ferries announced plans to build a ferry that could integrate a propulsion liquefied natural gas (LNG). An innovative project, that was abandoned in late 2014, which would be reborn as a smaller vessel to sail between Portsmouth and [[Ouistreham]].\n\nOn 20 June 2017, Brittany Ferries confirmed its order for a new LNG-powered cruise-ferry for the Portsmouth to Ouistreham route. The new 42,000 GT ship, to be constructed by Flensburger Schiffbau shipyard in Germany, is scheduled for delivery in 2019. The new ship is to be named ''Honfleur''.\n\nOn 14 July 2017, Brittany Ferries announced it will extend its charter of freight vessel ''Pelican'' from Maritime Nantaise for a further two years. The vessel, capable of carrying up to 100 unoccupied trailers, will continue to operate on the [[Poole]] to [[Bilbao]] route.\n\nOn 16 January 2018, Brittany Ferries announced it will begin a new route from Cork, [[Ireland]] to [[Santander, Spain]]. The new route, which will consist of two weekly connections along with an additional weekly service between Cork, [[Ireland]] & [[Roscoff]], [[France]], commenced in May 2018. Brittany Ferries is chartering the Stena RoRo Vessel [[MS Norman Asturias|''Asterion'']] which is currently serving routes between Italy and Greece and will be renamed [[MS Norman Asturias|''Connemara'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://brittanyferriesnewsroom.com/portsmouth-based-brittany-ferries-expands-its-route-network-in-2018/|title=Portsmouth-based Brittany Ferries expands its route network in 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2018, work commenced on the construction of ''Honfleur'' with the Steel Cutting [[Ceremony]]. Unfortunately, the construction of the vessel will take a little over a year to complete.\n\nOn 24 May 2018, Brittany Ferries confirmed that it had ordered a second Stena E-Flexer vessel with the option to buy after the five-year charter. This takes the number to two chartered from [[Stena Line]] along with the new build vessel ''Honfleur'' expected in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://brittanyferriesnewsroom.com/brittany-ferries-invests-in-two-new-cruise-ferries-for-long-haul-spanish-routes/|title=Brittany Ferries invests in two new cruise-ferries for long-haul Spanish routes}} To be called Galicia and Salamanca, the ships are expected to enter service in 2021 and 2022 respectively. </ref>\n\nIn October 2018, Brittany Ferries announced that a new logo will be used for marketing purposes and will appear on their vessels, with {{MV|Armorique|2008|2}} and {{MV|Pont-Aven||2}} being the first ships to receive the new livery. The logo is part of a multi-million pound investment in the company's future. 450 million euros has been earmarked for new ships, new brand (including logo) and a focus on more digital tools. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://brittanyferriesnewsroom.com/brittany-ferries-fresh-new-look/|title=Brittany Ferries\u2019 fresh new look}}</ref>\n\nOn 26 March 2019, Brittany Ferries confirmed its order of a fourth new build (9th Stena [[E-Flexer-class ferry]]), chartered from Stena RoRo and will be built at the AVIC Weihai Shipyard in [[China]], due to join the fleet in the year 2023. Like two of the other  E-Flexer-Class Ferries Salamanca and Santo\u00f1a this vessel will also be powered by LNG (liquefied natural gas) (Galicia the first will be fitted with funnel exhaust gas cleaning systems) . <ref>{{cite web|url=https://brittanyferriesnewsroom.com/brittany-ferries-confirms-fourth-new-cruise-ferry-post-brexit/|title=Brittany Ferries confirms fourth new cruise-ferry, post-Brexit}}</ref> This new ferry will be named [[E-Flexer-class ferry|''Santo\u00f1a'']].\n\nOn 20 June 2019, Brittany Ferries announced it was finalising a one-year charter of an additional ship from Stena Ro-Ro ahead of the 2020 season, which will be operated by the ferry company from November 2019 to November 2020 to deliver additional flexibility to a route network that connects France, the UK, Spain and Ireland. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://brittanyferriesnewsroom.com/new-ship-charter-will-secure-2020-season-schedules-says-brittany-ferries/|title=New ship charter will secure 2020 season schedules says Brittany Ferries}}</ref>\n\nOn 27 August 2019, MV Bore Bay arrived in [[Poole]] as a temporary cover for MN Pelican while she undergoes maintenance and fitting of exhaust scrubbers.

It is not uncommon, as a positioning move, to operate a service from Plymouth - St Malo - Portsmouth, or vice versa. These services are generally noted on the on-line timetables and are open to passengers.\n\nIn previous years during the Christmas and New Year period, Brittany Ferries chartered '''Pont-Aven''  to Mistral Holidays, who operate cruises to [[Rouen]] and [[Antwerp]]. The cruise generally leaves [[Portsmouth International Port]] and spends two days in the Continental port. ''Pont-Aven'' is therefore the only ship which operates on Christmas Day and New Year's Day. Brittany Ferries parted company with Mistral Holidays in 2015.\n\nIn 2016, Brittany Ferries announced that they would be solely operating a New Year cruise to Rouen on ''Pont-Aven''.\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Cowsill|first1=Miles|title=Brittany Ferries: From the Land to the Sea / De la Terre a la Mer|date=1993|publisher=Ferry Publications.|location=Kilgetty, Pembrokeshire|isbn=1871947170|language=English, French}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Cowsill|first1=Miles|title=Brittany Ferries: 1973\u20132007|date=2007|publisher=Ferry Publications|location=Ramsey, Isle of Man|isbn=1871947898}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Cowsill|first1=Miles|title=Brittany Ferries: 40 memorable years of service, hospitality and holidays|date=2013|publisher=Ferry Publications|location=Ramsey, Isle of Man|isbn=9781906608521}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Brittany Ferries}}\n* [http://www.brittanyferries.com Official Brittany Ferries Website] \n\n\n[[Category:Ferry companies of France]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Brittany]]\n[[Category:Ferry companies of England]]\n[[Category:Ferry companies of the Republic of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Ferry companies of Spain]]\n[[Category:Transport in Brittany]]\n[[Category:Connections across the English Channel]]\n[[Category:Transport companies established in 1972]]\n[[Category:1972 establishments in France]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the ferry company|the historic trimaran|Brittany Ferries (trimaran)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}\n{{Refimprove|date=November 2015}}\n{{infobox company\n| name = Brittany Ferries\n| logo = Logo bf original bloc marque.jpg\n| type = [[Private company]]\n| predecessor = \n| successor = \n| founder = [[Alexis Gourvennec]]\n| defunct = \n| fate = \n| area_served = [[France]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], [[Spain]]\n| key_people = Jean-Marc Rou\u00e9<br>Christophe Mathieu<br>Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pouget<br>Corinne Vintner<br>\n| industry = Passenger transportation<br>Freight transportation<br>Holidays\n| genre = [[Holiday]]s\n| products = \n| services = \n| revenue = {{increase}} \u20ac444.2&nbsp;million (2018)\n| operating_income = \n| net_income = \n| aum = \n| assets = \u20ac444.2&nbsp;million (2018)\n| equity = \n| owner = BAI Bretagne Angleterre Irlande S.A.\n| num_employees = {{decrease}} 2,787 (2018 average - high and low seasons)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.brittany-ferries.com/en/iso_album/2014bilancaconsolide.pdf|title=Brittany Ferries Bilan Consolid\u00e9 (Balance Sheet), including employee numbers|work=Brittany Ferries Corporate}}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n| parent = \n| divisions = \n| subsid = \n| footnotes = \n| intl = \n| caption = \n| foundation = 1973\n| location_city = \n| location_country = \n| location = [[Roscoff]], [[France]]\n| locations = \n| homepage = [http://www.brittany-ferries.co.uk www.brittany-ferries.co.uk]\n}}\n\n'''Brittany Ferries''' (founded in 1973 by [[Alexis Gourvennec]]) is the trading name of French shipping company BAI Bretagne Angleterre Irlande S.A. that operates a fleet of ferries and cruiseferries between [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], and [[Spain]], and between the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Spain]]. \n\n==History==\n\n===1970s and 1980s===\n\n[[File:Brittanyferries1980s.png|thumb|Brittany Ferries logo until 1984]]\n[[File:Centro Bot\u00edn 1 - Santander.jpg|thumb|right|The ship [[MV Cap Finist\u00e8re]] of Brittany Ferries entering the port of Santander.]]\n\nBAI (Bretagne Angleterre Irlande) S.A. was founded by firebrand farmer [[Alexis Gourvennec]]. Working with fellow Breton farmers, Gourvennec lobbied for improvements to Brittany's infrastructure, including better roads, telephone network, education and port access. By 1972 he had successfully secured funding and work to develop a deep-water[[Port of Bloscon-Roscoff|port at Roscoff]]. Gourvennec had no desire to run a ferry service, but existing operators showed little appetite for the opportunity. \n\nAs was the way of a man known as \"the [[bulldozer]]\", {{citation needed|date=May 2019}} he took the reins and did it himself.\n\nThe company itself began sailings on 2nd January 1973 between [[Roscoff]] in [[Brittany]] and [[Plymouth]] in the South West of England, using the freight ferry ''Kerisnel'' a former Israeli tank carrier. The company's primary aim at that time was to exploit opportunities presented by the UK's entry into the Common Market (forerunner to the EU), to take control away from hated middle-men in Paris and export directly to markets in the United Kingdom. \n\nIn 1974, ''Kerisnel'' was replaced by ''Penn-Ar-Bed'', which carried both passengers and vehicles, and the BAI company adopted the name Brittany Ferries.<ref name=Hoyle&Pinder>{{cite book |editor1-last=Hoyle |editor1-first=B S |editor2-last=Pinder |editor2-first=David |title=European Port Cities in Transition |date=1992 |publisher=Belhaven Press in association with the British Association for the Advancement of Science |location=London |isbn=9780470219263 |page=92}}</ref>  Such was the success of the Plymouth-Roscoff service that a larger ship, ''Cornouailles'', was ordered and entered service in 1977. New routes were developed in the late 1970s, and the company continued to grow. Routes to [[Saint-Malo]], [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]], and [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in Ireland were operated by {{MV|Armorique|1973|2}} and ''Prince of Brittany'', and in the early 1980s a second ship was chartered for the Saint-Malo route. ''[[MV Wickersham|Goelo]]'', an attractive-looking vessel, left the fleet in preparation for the new ship to be introduced in 1982. {{MV|Quiberon||2}} replaced ''Armorique'' for the Santander and Cork services, allowing her to operate alongside ''Prince of Brittany'' on the Saint-Malo route, while ''Cornouailles'' maintained the original routes from Roscoff.\n\n''Benodet'' operated between Plymouth and Roscoff for just one year before being redeployed as part of Brittany Ferries' new venture, [[British Channel Island Ferries|Channel Island Ferries]]. ''Tregastel'' replaced her and continued on the Plymouth to Roscoff route until 1989.  The Cork route was operated by ''Tregastel'' and ''Quiberon'', later to be joined by ''Celtic Pride'', operated by Swansea Cork Ferries, supplying a midweek Cork-Roscoff round trip.\n\nIn 1985, Brittany Ferries further expanded by buying Truckline Ferries, which operated freight-only ships {{MV|Coutances||2}} and ''Purbeck'' between [[Poole]] in United Kingdom and [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]] in France.\n\nIn 1986, Brittany Ferries introduced {{MV|Duc de Normandie||2}}, which operated a new route from Caen to the increasingly popular port of Portsmouth.  The former Roscoff ship ''Cornouailles'' was transferred to the Truckline Ferries route from Poole to Cherbourg, introducing passenger services on this route.  This service was also very successful, and new ships were introduced over the next few years.  Meanwhile, a second (chartered) ship, ''Gotland'' was installed on the Caen service in 1988, as well as the new Truckline Ferries vessel {{MV|Normandie Shipper||2}} in 1989. In addition to the Portsmouth-Caen services, from 1986 a Truckline Ferries ferry ran from Poole to Caen during the summer to cope with the seasonal demand on Brittany's standard ships by holiday makers. However, the introduction of larger ships in 2006, and the sale of the original \"truckliners\", meant that this service was discontinued.\n\nIn 1989, the cruise ferry {{MV|Bretagne||2}} was introduced on the Santander and Cork routes.  She displaced ''Quiberon'', which transferred to the Roscoff route. ''Tregastel'' replaced ''Cornouailles'' on the Poole-Cherbourg Truckline Ferries passenger route along with ''Corbiere'' (formerly ''Benodet'' who had been transferred to [[British Channel Island Ferries|Channel Island Ferries]]).  ''Cornouailles'' was sold to British Channel Island Ferries and was renamed ''Havelet''. A second-hand purchase was introduced on the St Malo route, ''Duchesse Anne''. which was to run alongside ''Armorique''.  This allowed ''Prince of Brittany'' to be transferred to the Caen route under its new name, ''Reine Mathilde''.\n\n===1990s===\nAt the end of 1991, ''Reine Mathilde'' left the fleet ready for the introduction of the new cruise ferry ''Normandie'' on the Caen route. ''Corbiere'' and ''Tregastel'' also stepped down in preparation for the new Truckline Ferries ship, ''Barfleur''.  During 1992, the Truckline Ferries freight vessel, ''Purbeck'', and the St Malo ship ''Armorique'' both stepped down.\n\nIn 1993, the penultimate ship of the 1990s was introduced.  The Val de Loire was purchased from [[TT-Line]] and partially rebuilt for service on the [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]] and Cork routes.  The vessel replaced ''Bretagne'' which transferred to the St Malo route, allowing ''Duchesse Anne'' to operate new services between Poole, St Malo, Cork, Roscoff and Plymouth. Following further financial difficulties in the mid-1990s, these new routes were ended and ''Duchesse Anne'' left the fleet. ''Normandie Shipper'' was also sold, but the ex-Truckline Ferries vessel ''Purbeck'' was later chartered back by the company for use on various routes, primarily Portsmouth-Caen.  In 1999, ''Barfleur'' was repainted in Brittany Ferries colours, ending the Truckline Ferries tradition on the route.\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2001 a new fast ferry service began to operate between Poole and Cherbourg in partnership with [[Condor Ferries]].  The fast ''Normandie Vitesse'' could make the voyage in just over two hours.  In 2002, a new ship, ''Mont St Michel'', was due to enter service between Portsmouth and Caen. ''Duc de Normandie'' was transferred to the Roscoff route in July, whilst ''Quiberon'' was sent to Caen to cover until the new ship arrived. ''Mont St Michel'' was delayed until December however. ''Quiberon'' spent the remainder of the year on the busiest Brittany Ferries route.  She had been with the company for almost 21 years when she was sold in 2003.  In 2004, another new ship, ''Pont-Aven'', was introduced on the Santander & Cork routes.  She could travel much faster than the rest of the fleet, cutting journey times by a quarter. \n\nIn late 2004, the company withdrew ''Duc de Normandie'' from the fleet. ''Bretagne'' transferred to the Roscoff route, leaving ''Val de Loire'' at St Malo. ''Coutances'' was also earmarked for disposal, but then a change of heart resulted in its refit, losing her Truckline Ferries livery in favour of the new Brittany Ferries logo.\n\nMore changes occurred in 2005 with the withdrawal of [[P&O Ferries|P&O]]'s French routes from Portsmouth.  A new fastcraft, ''Normandie Express'' was chartered to operate between Portsmouth and Cherbourg and Caen.  In addition, the Poole-Cherbourg ship ''Barfleur'' was redeployed to operate a triangular service between Portsmouth, Poole and Cherbourg.  A new ship was announced, in part a replacement for ''Coutances''. The ship was named ''Cotentin''. ''Purbeck'' was to have returned from operating in New Zealand and cover the Portsmouth-Cherbourg link but this plan was dropped. ''Barfleur'' returned to the Poole-Cherbourg link in November 2005.\n\nThe former flagship of the fleet (from 1993 until the arrival of ''Mont St Michel'') ''Val de Loire'' left the fleet in February 2006, having been sold to [[DFDS]] and renamed ''King of Scandinavia''. In the meantime, Brittany Ferries had taken up a 2-year charter of the DFDS ship ''Duke of Scandinavia'', which was renamed ''Pont-L'Abb\u00e9'' and ran on the Plymouth-Roscoff route. ''Bretagne'' returned to the Portsmouth-St Malo route. Brittany Ferries also announced a new build for the Plymouth-Roscoff route, to be launched early 2008.  In February 2006 ''Normandie Express'' was brought under the French flag, she was later purchased by the company in early 2007.  Brittany Ferries new freight ship, ''Cotentin'', entered service on 26 November 2007 with the 23:45 Cherbourg-Poole service.  The new ship also operated a weekly service to Santander from Poole. It was announced on 19 December 2007 that the company had purchased ''Pont-L'Abb\u00e9'' from DFDS. On 1 May 2008 ''Coutances'' completed her last sailing for the company - having been with Truckline Ferries for 30 years and with Brittany Ferries since 1985.  In early 2009, ''Armorique'' was launched on the Plymouth-Roscoff route, replacing ''Pont L'Abbe''. For 2009, ''Pont-Aven'' operated a new Portsmouth to Santander service once a week (cutting the previous Plymouth to Santander route to once a week).\n\n===2010s===\nIn late 2009, the new [[Poole]]-[[Santander, Spain|Santander]] freight-only service was deemed a success and the frequency was doubled: there would now be two services a week operated by ''Cotentin''. In November 2009, ''Armorique'' was laid up for the rest of the winter season. Major changes were announced in December 2009. ''Barfleur'' was withdrawn from service at the end of January 2010 after nearly 18 years service on the Poole-[[Cherbourg]] route. The service was temporarily served by ''Armorique'', which came back to service earlier than originally planned. The Poole-Santander service reverted to one sailing a week with ''Cotentin'' covering freight on the Poole-Cherbourg service in the absence of ''Barfleur''. ''Condor Vitesse'' continued to operate one round sailing a day in the summer months between the two ports. ''Cap Finist\u00e8re'' ran between [[Portsmouth]] and Santander twice a week and also operated three round trips a week between Portsmouth and Cherbourg. In September 2010, Brittany Ferries announced plans to serve the Portsmouth\u2013[[Bilbao]] route recently abandoned by P&O Ferries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.traveldaily.co.uk/AsiaPacificNews/Detail.aspx?Section=20510|title=Brittany Ferries saves Portsmouth-Bilbao route|work=Travel News UK|date=27 September 2010|accessdate=8 October 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204012443/http://traveldaily.co.uk/AsiaPacificNews/Detail.aspx?Section=20510|archivedate=4 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The route started on 27 March 2011.\n\nIn February 2011, ''Barfleur'' returned to the Poole-Cherbourg route on a seven-month trial basis after being laid up for a year. Her final crossing of 2011 was 3 October. The return of ''Barfleur'' allowed ''Cotentin'' to run two Poole-Santander trips a week. However, with ''Barfleur'' being laid up again, the Poole-Santander sailings reverted to one trip a week. On 23 March, it was announced that ''Barfleur'' was to be chartered to [[DFDS Seaways]] for use on their [[Dover]]\u2013[[Calais]] route. Her first sailing on the route was on 27 April.\n\nOn 1 April 2011, the new [[Portsmouth International Port]] (PIP) terminal, used by Brittany Ferries, [[LD Lines]] and [[Condor Ferries]], was opened to the public. An official opening ceremony took place on 13 May 2011. This modern, stylish, eco-friendly building replaced the previous terminal building that stood from 1976 until its well needed replacement occurred in 2011.\n\nOn 21 September 2012, Brittany Ferries cancelled sailings indefinitely following two days of wild[[cat]] strikes caused by crew members who were unhappy with changes in working terms and conditions. Meetings took place between management and unions to negotiate the management proposals. A vote was taken on 30 September by union members to decide if the management proposals would be accepted. The crew members accepted the proposal and services resumed on 2 October after 12 days without services. During this period, Brittany Ferries made special arrangements with P&O Ferries and [[MyFerryLink]] to accept Brittany Ferries tickets on the Dover\u2013Calais route; any unused tickets were refunded.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19671784|title=Brittany Ferries services halted 'until further notice'|work=BBC News|date=21 September 2012|accessdate=23 September 2012}}</ref> Services were not affected on the Poole\u2013Cherbourg route which was being operated by [[Condor Ferries]].\n\nThe 2012 season was the last year of the [[Poole]]\u2013[[Cherbourg]] fastcraft operation with [[Condor Ferries]]. For the first time since 2001, the Condor vessel operating the Poole-Cherbourg summer service was ''Condor Express'' rather than ''Condor Vitesse''.\n\nIn May 2013, Brittany Ferries introduced a new route with services from [[Portsmouth]] to [[Le Havre]] using their high-speed vessel, ''Normandie Express''.\n\nIn October 2013, Brittany Ferries' [[freight]] service from [[Poole]]-[[Santander, Spain|Santander]] terminated and ''Cotentin'', which served the route, is now being chartered by [[Stena Line]].\n\nOn 5 November 2013, Christophe Mathieu, deputy managing director of Brittany Ferries and Sandie Dawe, chief executive of [[VisitBritain]], signed an agreement to run a joint marketing campaign designed to attract more French tourists to the UK. The agreement commits both parties to a three-year campaign with a promotional match-funded spend of \u00a31.5 million, and is the first time Brittany Ferries has entered into such an arrangement with Visit Britain.\n\nOn 7 February 2014, Brittany Ferries announced that as from the end of March 2014, it would charter the former Visentini-built [[DFDS Seaways]] {{ship||Norman Voyager}} to operate on [[Le Havre]], Portsmouth and Santander. The vessel was renamed {{MV|Etretat||2}}.\n\nDuring the weekends, the ferry sails on Portsmouth\u2013Santander. Demand for freight capacity is high during the weekend, but also passengers are interested in such a service.\n\nOn weekdays, ''Norman Voyager'', which has been renamed ''Etretat'', sails on Portsmouth\u2013Le Havre, a route that was successful in 2013 when Brittany Ferries introduced the catamaran {{ship|HSC|Normandie Express||2}}. However, after the 2015 summer season, Brittany Ferries pulled ''Normandie Express'' from this route as it was not financially viable. The \"new\" ro-pax ferry ''Etretat'' will sail year-round.\n\nOn 30 January 2015, Brittany Ferries announced that it would charter the [[DFDS Seaways]] vessel {{MS|Sirena Seaways||2}} from the beginning of April 2015 and start service with Brittany Ferries in May 2015, to operate on their successful Portsmouth\u2013Le Havre route, alongside ''Etretat''. It will also operate a twice weekly Portsmouth\u2013Spain service. The ship will be renamed {{MV|Baie de Seine||2}}.\n\nThe company chartered the RoRo vessel, {{ship|MN|Pelican||2}} from Maritime Nantaise for 12 months, with the option of an extension. The vessel has the capacity for around one hundred unaccompanied trailers and twelve drivers and commenced service with Brittany Ferries on 11 February 2016.\n\nOn 24 October 2016, Brittany Ferries announced plans to build a ferry that could integrate a propulsion liquefied natural gas (LNG). An innovative project, that was abandoned in late 2014, which would be reborn as a smaller vessel to sail between Portsmouth and [[Ouistreham]].\n\nOn 20 June 2017, Brittany Ferries confirmed its order for a new LNG-powered cruise-ferry for the Portsmouth to Ouistreham route. The new 42,000 GT ship, to be constructed by Flensburger Schiffbau shipyard in Germany, is scheduled for delivery in 2019. The new ship is to be named ''Honfleur''.\n\nOn 14 July 2017, Brittany Ferries announced it will extend its charter of freight vessel ''Pelican'' from Maritime Nantaise for a further two years. The vessel, capable of carrying up to 100 unoccupied trailers, will continue to operate on the [[Poole]] to [[Bilbao]] route.\n\nOn 16 January 2018, Brittany Ferries announced it will begin a new route from Cork, [[Ireland]] to [[Santander, Spain]]. The new route, which will consist of two weekly connections along with an additional weekly service between Cork, [[Ireland]] & [[Roscoff]], [[France]], commenced in May 2018. Brittany Ferries is chartering the Stena RoRo Vessel [[MS Norman Asturias|''Asterion'']] which is currently serving routes between Italy and Greece and will be renamed [[MS Norman Asturias|''Connemara'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://brittanyferriesnewsroom.com/portsmouth-based-brittany-ferries-expands-its-route-network-in-2018/|title=Portsmouth-based Brittany Ferries expands its route network in 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2018, work commenced on the construction of ''Honfleur'' with the Steel Cutting [[Ceremony]]. Unfortunately, the construction of the vessel will take a little over a year to complete.\n\nOn 24 May 2018, Brittany Ferries confirmed that it had ordered a second Stena E-Flexer vessel with the option to buy after the five-year charter.

It is not uncommon, as a positioning move, to operate a service from Plymouth - St Malo - Portsmouth, or vice versa. These services are generally noted on the on-line timetables and are open to passengers.\n\nIn previous years during the Christmas and New Year period, Brittany Ferries chartered '''Pont-Aven''  to Mistral Holidays, who operate cruises to [[Rouen]] and [[Antwerp]]. The cruise generally leaves [[Portsmouth International Port]] and spends two days in the Continental port. ''Pont-Aven'' is therefore the only ship which operates on Christmas Day and New Year's Day. Brittany Ferries parted company with Mistral Holidays in 2015.\n\nIn 2016, Brittany Ferries announced that they would be solely operating a New Year cruise to Rouen on ''Pont-Aven''.\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Cowsill|first1=Miles|title=Brittany Ferries: From the Land to the Sea / De la Terre a la Mer|date=1993|publisher=Ferry Publications.|location=Kilgetty, Pembrokeshire|isbn=1871947170|language=English, French}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Cowsill|first1=Miles|title=Brittany Ferries: 1973\u20132007|date=2007|publisher=Ferry Publications|location=Ramsey, Isle of Man|isbn=1871947898}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Cowsill|first1=Miles|title=Brittany Ferries: 40 memorable years of service, hospitality and holidays|date=2013|publisher=Ferry Publications|location=Ramsey, Isle of Man|isbn=9781906608521}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Brittany Ferries}}\n* [http://www.brittanyferries.com Official Brittany Ferries Website] \n\n\n[[Category:Ferry companies of France]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Brittany]]\n[[Category:Ferry companies of England]]\n[[Category:Ferry companies of the Republic of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Ferry companies of Spain]]\n[[Category:Transport in Brittany]]\n[[Category:Connections across the English Channel]]\n[[Category:Transport companies established in 1972]]\n[[Category:1972 establishments in France]]\n", "name_user": "Harry135", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory:2020 sub heading", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany_Ferries"}

The first championship was held in [[1927 World Snooker Championship|1927]] and was won by [[Joe Davis]]. Davis won the first 15 championships before retiring from the event, undefeated, after his [[1946 World Snooker Championship|1946]] success. In the 1950s snooker went into a period of decline and the championship was not held after 1952, although an unofficial championship was held until 1957. In 1964 the championship was revived on a challenge basis and in [[1969 World Snooker Championship|1969]] the championship became a knock-out event again. Since [[1977 World Snooker Championship|1977]] it has been played at the [[Crucible Theatre]] in [[Sheffield]], [[England]]. The tournament is currently played over 17 days and ends on the first Monday in May. In the modern era (since 1969), the best record is that of [[Stephen Hendry]], who won the title seven times. [[Steve Davis]] and [[Ray Reardon]] both won six times while [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]] has won five titles. The current champion is [[Judd Trump]], whose 2019 win was his first.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Professional Snooker Championship (1927\u20131934)===\n{{anchor|Professional Snooker Championship}}\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

It was the first to incorporate \"world\" in its name, being called the '''World's Professional Snooker Championship'''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Billiards \u2013 Professional title |work=Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer |date=3 November 1934 |accessdate=24 November 2015 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000687/19341103/342/0007 |via=[[British Newspaper Archive]] |url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Canadian's bid for Snooker title |work=Dundee Courier |date=20 October 1934 |accessdate=20 January 2016 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000564/19341020/167/0009 |via=[[British Newspaper Archive]] |url-access=subscription}}</ref> There was also a change in the organisation of the event with the matches being played consecutively at the same venue, [[Thurston's Hall]] in London. Previously the draw had been made early in the season and the players made their own arrangements about the dates and venue of matches. The change in format proved a great success and [[Thurston's Hall]] became the primary venue for professional snooker matches. In the period from 1935 to 1940, nearly all World Championship matches were played there and with good attendances the professionals could make some money from their share of the entrance charges. Because of the importance of gate receipts, dead frames were played out, whatever the state of the game. This had often been the case in the early championships but now became universal.\n\nThere were five entries in [[1935 World Snooker Championship|1935 Championship]]. [[Joe Davis]] beat [[Willie Smith (billiards player)|Willie Smith]] 28\u201321 in the final, having earlier taken a winning 25\u201320 lead.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Times |date=29 April 1935 |page=5 |title=Snooker's Pool \u2013 Davis retains the Championship}}</ref> Davis recorded the first century break in the history of the championship, 110 in his semi-final match against [[Tom Newman (billiards player)|Tom Newman]].<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Times |date=18 April 1935 |page=6 |title=Snooker's Pool \u2013 The Professional Championship}}</ref> The break was made in a dead frame but was still regarded as a championship record.

Year !! Winner\n|-\n| [[2018 World Snooker Championship|2018]] || [[Mark Williams (snooker player)|Mark Williams]]\n|-\n| [[2019 World Snooker Championship|2019]] || [[Judd Trump]]\n|}\n\nIn [[2018 World Snooker Championship|2018]], Selby, champion and top seed, was knocked out in the first round by [[Joe Perry (snooker player)|Joe Perry]]. Ronnie O'Sullivan, the second seed, lost to Ali Carter, while Ding Junhui only made it to the quarter-finals before losing to Barry Hawkins. The final was between two of the \"class of '92\", [[Mark Williams (snooker player)|Mark Williams]] and [[John Higgins]]. Their rivalry dated back to the late 1990s, although only three of their meetings had been in the World Championships - all in semi-finals, in 1999, 2000 (both won by Williams 17\u201315) and 2011 (won by Higgins 17\u201314). The match was closely contested, Williams coming out on top by 18\u201316 to win the World Championship for the first time since 2003, setting a new record for the longest gap between consecutive World Championship victories. He won \u00a3425,000.  Higgins reached the final again in 2019, only to be beaten 18-9 by [[Judd Trump]]. His prize was a record breaking \u00a3500,000. Trump also bettered O'Sullivan's six centuries in the 2013 final \u2013 making seven \u2013 which was also a record.\n\n== Format ==\nThe format for the World Championship has been largely unchanged since [[1982 World Snooker Championship|1982]]. It has a knock-out format with 32 players, contested over 17 days ending on the first Monday in May, which is a [[May Day#United Kingdom|public holiday in the United Kingdom]]. Before 1982 there were a number of different formats used for the Championship. In 1980 and 1981, 24 players played in the final stages at the Crucible. The top eight seeds had a bye in the first round while seeds 9 to 16 played in the first round against eight qualifiers. From 1977 to 1979, the first three years at the Crucible, only 16 players reached the final stages, eight seeds playing eight qualifiers in the first round. Before 1980, the final was not always played over a set number of frames- for example, in [[1978 World Snooker Championship|1978]] [[Ray Reardon]] beat [[Perrie Mans]] in a best-of-49 frames match 25\u201318 and, [[1979 World Snooker Championship|the following year]], [[Terry Griffiths]] defeated [[Dennis Taylor]] 24\u201316 in a best-of-47.\n\n16 of the players reach the final stages directly while the other 16 get there through a qualifying competition. The reigning world champion receives a direct entry and is the number one seed (the World Champion is usually seeded 2nd for all ranking tournaments, and The Masters, for the following season, except for the World Championship where is seeded 1st). The remaining direct entries are based on the latest [[Snooker world rankings|world rankings]], players being seeded based on these world rankings. Since the defending champion is normally ranked in the top 16, the top 16 ranked players generally receive a direct entry.\n\nThe first round is played over 19 frames, played in two sessions. The second round and quarter-finals are the best of 25 frames played over three sessions while the semi-finals and final are played over four sessions, the semi-finals being over 33 frames and the final 35 frames. For the first 12 days of the tournament two matches are played concurrently. For the last five days (the semi-finals and final) only one table is used.\n\nPrior to 1997 the semi-finals were played over 31 frames. Occasionally the dates of the Championship are changed. In 1982 the Championship ended on Sunday 16 May while in 1985, 1990 and 1995 it ended on the last Sunday in April. In each of these years the tournament started on a Friday but, as of 2019, this has not happened since.\n\nSeveral changes to the qualifying system came into effect for the 2015 championship. All living world champions would be extended an opportunity to play in the qualifying rounds. The top 16 seeds would still qualify automatically for the first round at the Crucible, but all non-seeded players would have to start in the first of three qualifying rounds. Previously players seeded 17 to 32 only had to win one qualifying match to reach the final stages. The overall championship would increase from 128 to 144 players, with the additional places made available to former world champions and players from emerging countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Snooker: Stephen Hendry and other champions could return|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/snooker/27130513|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=24 April 2014|date=23 April 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425181726/http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/snooker/27130513|archivedate=25 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Winners ==\n{{Main|List of world snooker champions}}\n\n===Top performers of the modern era===\nThe 'modern' era is considered to start in [[1969 World Snooker Championship|1969]], when the championship reverted to a [[Single-elimination tournament|knock-out tournament]] format from a challenge format.

The first championship was held in [[1927 World Snooker Championship|1927]] and was won by [[Joe Davis]]. Davis won the first 15 championships before retiring from the event, undefeated, after his [[1946 World Snooker Championship|1946]] success. In the 1950s snooker went into a period of decline and the championship was not held after 1952, although an unofficial championship was held until 1957. In 1964 the championship was revived on a challenge basis and in [[1969 World Snooker Championship|1969]] the championship became a knock-out event again. Since [[1977 World Snooker Championship|1977]] it has been played at the [[Crucible Theatre]] in [[Sheffield]], [[England]]. The tournament is currently played over 17 days and ends on the first Monday in May. In the modern era (since 1969), the best record is that of [[Stephen Hendry]], who won the title seven times. [[Steve Davis]] and [[Ray Reardon]] both won six times while [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]] has won five titles. The current champion is [[Judd Trump]], whose 2019 win was his first.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Professional Snooker Championship (1927\u20131934)===\n{{anchor|Professional Snooker Championship}}\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

It was the first to incorporate \"world\" in its name, being called the '''World's Professional Snooker Championship'''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Billiards \u2013 Professional title |work=Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer |date=3 November 1934 |accessdate=24 November 2015 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000687/19341103/342/0007 |via=[[British Newspaper Archive]] |url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Canadian's bid for Snooker title |work=Dundee Courier |date=20 October 1934 |accessdate=20 January 2016 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000564/19341020/167/0009 |via=[[British Newspaper Archive]] |url-access=subscription}}</ref> There was also a change in the organisation of the event with the matches being played consecutively at the same venue, [[Thurston's Hall]] in London. Previously the draw had been made early in the season and the players made their own arrangements about the dates and venue of matches. The change in format proved a great success and [[Thurston's Hall]] became the primary venue for professional snooker matches. In the period from 1935 to 1940, nearly all World Championship matches were played there and with good attendances the professionals could make some money from their share of the entrance charges. Because of the importance of gate receipts, dead frames were played out, whatever the state of the game. This had often been the case in the early championships but now became universal.\n\nThere were five entries in [[1935 World Snooker Championship|1935 Championship]]. [[Joe Davis]] beat [[Willie Smith (billiards player)|Willie Smith]] 28\u201321 in the final, having earlier taken a winning 25\u201320 lead.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Times |date=29 April 1935 |page=5 |title=Snooker's Pool \u2013 Davis retains the Championship}}</ref> Davis recorded the first century break in the history of the championship, 110 in his semi-final match against [[Tom Newman (billiards player)|Tom Newman]].<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Times |date=18 April 1935 |page=6 |title=Snooker's Pool \u2013 The Professional Championship}}</ref> The break was made in a dead frame but was still regarded as a championship record.

Year !! Winner\n|-\n| [[2018 World Snooker Championship|2018]] || [[Mark Williams (snooker player)|Mark Williams]]\n|-\n| [[2019 World Snooker Championship|2019]] || [[Judd Trump]]\n|}\n\nIn [[2018 World Snooker Championship|2018]], Selby, champion and top seed, was knocked out in the first round by [[Joe Perry (snooker player)|Joe Perry]]. Ronnie O'Sullivan, the second seed, lost to Ali Carter, while Ding Junhui only made it to the quarter-finals before losing to Barry Hawkins. The final was between two of the \"class of '92\", [[Mark Williams (snooker player)|Mark Williams]] and [[John Higgins]]. Their rivalry dated back to the late 1990s, although only three of their meetings had been in the World Championships - all in semi-finals, in 1999, 2000 (both won by Williams 17\u201315) and 2011 (won by Higgins 17\u201314). The match was closely contested, Williams coming out on top by 18\u201316 to win the World Championship for the first time since 2003, setting a new record for the longest gap between consecutive World Championship victories. He won \u00a3425,000.  Higgins reached the final again in 2019, only to be beaten 18-9 by [[Judd Trump]]. His prize was a record breaking \u00a3500,000. Trump also bettered O'Sullivan's six centuries in the 2013 final \u2013 making seven \u2013 which was also a record.\n\n== Format ==\nThe format for the World Championship has been largely unchanged since [[1982 World Snooker Championship|1982]]. It has a knock-out format with 32 players, contested over 17 days ending on the first Monday in May, which is a [[May Day#United Kingdom|public holiday in the United Kingdom]]. Before 1982 there were a number of different formats used for the Championship. In 1980 and 1981, 24 players played in the final stages at the Crucible. The top eight seeds had a bye in the first round while seeds 9 to 16 played in the first round against eight qualifiers. From 1977 to 1979, the first three years at the Crucible, only 16 players reached the final stages, eight seeds playing eight qualifiers in the first round. Before 1980, the final was not always played over a set number of frames- for example, in [[1978 World Snooker Championship|1978]] [[Ray Reardon]] beat [[Perrie Mans]] in a best-of-49 frames match 25\u201318 and, [[1979 World Snooker Championship|the following year]], [[Terry Griffiths]] defeated [[Dennis Taylor]] 24\u201316 in a best-of-47.\n\n16 of the players reach the final stages directly while the other 16 get there through a qualifying competition. The reigning world champion receives a direct entry and is the number one seed (the World Champion is usually seeded 2nd for all ranking tournaments, and The Masters, for the following season, except for the World Championship where is seeded 1st). The remaining direct entries are based on the latest [[Snooker world rankings|world rankings]], players being seeded based on these world rankings. Since the defending champion is normally ranked in the top 16, the top 16 ranked players generally receive a direct entry.\n\nThe first round is played over 19 frames, played in two sessions. The second round and quarter-finals are the best of 25 frames played over three sessions while the semi-finals and final are played over four sessions, the semi-finals being over 33 frames and the final 35 frames. For the first 12 days of the tournament two matches are played concurrently. For the last five days (the semi-finals and final) only one table is used.\n\nPrior to 1997 the semi-finals were played over 31 frames. Occasionally the dates of the Championship are changed. In 1982 the Championship ended on Sunday 16 May while in 1985, 1990 and 1995 it ended on the last Sunday in April. In each of these years the tournament started on a Friday but, as of 2019, this has not happened since.\n\nSeveral changes to the qualifying system came into effect for the 2015 championship. All living world champions would be extended an opportunity to play in the qualifying rounds. The top 16 seeds would still qualify automatically for the first round at the Crucible, but all non-seeded players would have to start in the first of three qualifying rounds. Previously players seeded 17 to 32 only had to win one qualifying match to reach the final stages. The overall championship would increase from 128 to 144 players, with the additional places made available to former world champions and players from emerging countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Snooker: Stephen Hendry and other champions could return|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/snooker/27130513|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=24 April 2014|date=23 April 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425181726/http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/snooker/27130513|archivedate=25 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Winners ==\n{{Main|List of world snooker champions}}\n\n===Top performers of the modern era===\nThe 'modern' era is considered to start in [[1969 World Snooker Championship|1969]], when the championship reverted to a [[Single-elimination tournament|knock-out tournament]] format from a challenge format.
