{"title_page": "Competitive advantage", "text_new": "{{Short description|Business concept that an organization outperforms competition in some regard}}{{distinguish|Comparative advantage}}\n\n{{Strategy}}\n\nIn business, a '''competitive advantage''' is the attribute that allows an organization to outperform its [[Competition (economics)|competitors]]. A competitive advantage may include access to [[natural resources]], such as high-grade ores or a low-cost power source, highly skilled labor, geographic location, high entry barriers, and access to new technology.\n\n==Overview==\nCompetitive advantage is the leverage a business has over its competitors. This can be gained by offering clients better and greater value. Advertising products or services with lower prices or higher quality piques the interest of consumers. Target markets recognize these unique products or services. This is the reason behind brand loyalty, or why customers prefer one particular product or service over another.\n\nValue proposition is important when understanding competitive advantage. If the value proposition is effective, that is, if the value proposition offers clients better and greater value, it can produce a competitive advantage in either the product or service. The value proposition can increase customer expectations and choices.\n\n[[Michael Porter]] defined the two ways in which an organization can achieve competitive advantage over its rivals: cost advantage and [[Product differentiation|differentiation]] advantage. Cost advantage is when a business provides the same products and services as its competitors, albeit at a lesser cost.  Differentiation advantage is when a business provides better products and services as its competitors. In Porter's view, strategic management should be concerned with building and sustaining competitive advantage.<ref name=\"Porter1985\">{{cite book\n| last = Porter\n| first = Michael E.\n| year = 1985\n| title = Competitive Advantage | publisher = Free Press\n| isbn = 978-0-684-84146-5| title-link = Competitive Advantage\n}}</ref>\n\nCompetitive advantage seeks to address some of the criticisms of [[comparative advantage]]. Competitive advantage rests on the notion that cheap labor is [[ubiquitous]] and natural resources are not necessary for a good economy. The other theory, comparative advantage, can lead countries to specialize in exporting primary goods and [[raw material]]s that [[Resource_curse|trap countries]] in low-wage economies due to terms of trade. Competitive advantage attempts to correct this issue by stressing on maximizing scale economies in goods and services that garner premium prices (Stutz and Warf 2009).<ref>{{cite book|last=Warf|first=Frederick P. Stutz, Barney|title=The World Economy: Resources, Location, Trade and Development|year=2007|publisher=Pearson|location=Upper Saddle River|isbn=978-0132436892|edition=5th}}</ref>\n\nThe term ''competitive advantage'' refers to the ability gained through attributes and resources to perform at a higher level than others in the same industry or market (Christensen and Fahey 1984, Kay 1994, Porter 1980 cited by Chacarbaghi and Lynch 1999, p.&nbsp;45).<ref>{{citation |last=Chacarbaghi|author2=Lynch|title=Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance by Michael E. Porter 1980|year=1999|pages=45}}</ref> The study of this advantage has attracted profound research interest due to contemporary issues regarding superior performance levels of firms in today's competitive market. \"A firm is said to have a competitive advantage when it is implementing a value creating strategy not simultaneously being implemented by any current or potential player\" (Barney 1991 cited by Clulow  et al.2003, p.&nbsp;221).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Clulow|first=Val|author2=Gerstman, Julie |author3=Barry, Carol |title=The resource-based view and sustainable competitive advantage: the case of a financial services firm|journal=Journal of European Industrial Training|date=1 January 2003|volume=27|issue=5|pages=220\u2013232|doi=10.1108/03090590310469605}}</ref>\n\nSuccessfully implemented strategies will lift a firm to superior performance by facilitating the firm with competitive advantage to outperform current or potential players (Passemard and Calantone 2000, p.&nbsp;18).<ref>{{citation |last=Passemard|author2=Calantone|title=Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance by Michael E. Porter 1980|year=2000|pages=18}}</ref> To gain competitive advantage, a business strategy of a firm manipulates the various resources over which it has direct control, and these resources have the ability to generate competitive advantage (Reed and Fillippi 1990 cited by Rijamampianina 2003, p.&nbsp;362).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rijamampianina |first=Rasoava |author2=Abratt, Russell |author3=February, Yumiko |title=A framework for concentric diversification through sustainable competitive advantage|journal=Management Decision|year=2003|volume=41|issue=4|pages=362|doi=10.1108/00251740310468031}}</ref> Superior performance outcomes and superiority in production resources reflect competitive advantage (Day and Wesley 1988 cited by Lau 2002, p.&nbsp;125).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lau|first=Ronald S|title=Competitive factors and their relative importance in the US electronics and computer industries|journal=International Journal of Operations & Production Management|date=1 January 2002|volume=22|issue=1|pages=125\u2013135|doi=10.1108/01443570210412105}}</ref>\n\nThe quotes above signify competitive advantage as the ability to stay ahead of present or potential competition. Also, it provides the understanding that resources held by a firm and the business strategy will have a profound impact on generating competitive advantage.

Hence, viable business strategy may not be adequate unless it possesses control over unique resources that have the ability to create such a relatively unique advantage.\n\n==The three forms of generic competitive strategy==\n{{see|Porter's generic strategies}}\nMichael Porter, a graduate of Harvard University, wrote a book in 1985 which identified three strategies that businesses can use to tackle competition. This book was named the ninth most influential management book of the 20th century. These approaches can be applied to all businesses whether they are product-based or service-based. He called these approaches generic strategies. They include cost leadership, differentiation, and focus. These strategies have been created to improve and gain a competitive advantage over competitors. These strategies can also be recognized as the comparative advantage and the differential advantage.\n\n===Cost leadership strategy===\nCost leadership is a business' ability to produce a product or service that will be at a lower cost than other competitors. If the business is able to produce the same quality product but sell it for less, this gives them a competitive advantage over other businesses. Therefore, this provides a price value to the customers. Lower costs will result in higher profits as businesses are still making a reasonable profit on each good or service sold. If businesses are not making a large enough profit, Porter recommends finding a lower-cost base such as labor, materials, and facilities. This gives businesses a lower manufacturing cost over those of other competitors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newSTR_82.htm|title=Porter's Generic Strategies: Choosing Your Route to Success|website=www.mindtools.com|access-date=2016-04-01}}</ref>\nThe company can add value to the customer via transfer of the cost benefit to them.\n\n===Differential strategy===\nA differential advantage is gained when a business's products or services are different from its competitors. In his book, Michael Porter recommended making those goods or services attractive to stand out from their competitors. The business will need strong research, development and design thinking to create innovative ideas. These improvements to the goods or service could include delivering high quality to customers. If customers see a product or service as being different from other products, consumers are willing to pay more to receive these benefits.<ref name=referenceforbusiness>{{Cite web|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/management/Ex-Gov/Generic-Competitive-Strategies.html|title=Generic Competitive Strategies - strategy,levels, system, advantages, school, company, business, system|website=www.referenceforbusiness.com|access-date=2016-04-01}}</ref>\n\n===Focus strategy===\nFocus strategy ideally tries to get businesses to aim at a few target markets rather than trying to target everyone. This strategy is often used for smaller businesses since they may not have the appropriate resources or ability to target everyone. Businesses that use this method usually focus on the needs of the customer and how their products or services could improve their daily lives. In this method, some firms may even let consumers give their inputs for their product or service.<ref name=referenceforbusiness/>\n\nThis strategy can also be called the segmentation strategy, which includes geographic, demographic, behavioral and physical segmentation. By narrowing the market down to smaller segments, businesses are able to meet the needs of the consumer. Porter believes that once businesses have decided what groups they will target, it is essential to decide if they will take the cost leadership approach or differentiation approach. Focus strategy will not make a business successful. Porter mentions that it is important to not use all 3 generic strategies because there is a high chance that companies will come out achieving no strategies instead of achieving success. This can be called \"stuck in the middle\", and the business won't be able to have a competitive advantage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxlearn.com/arg_Marketing-Resources-Porter's-Generic-Strategies_11_33|title=Oxford Learning Lab - Watch it. Learn it. Badge it.|website=www.oxlearn.com|access-date=2016-04-01}}</ref>\n\nWhen businesses can find the perfect balance between price and quality, it usually leads to a successful product or service. A product or service must offer value through price or quality to ensure the business is successful in the market. To succeed, it's not enough to be \"just as good as\" another business. Success comes to firms that can deliver a product or service in a manner that is different, meaningful, and based on their customers' needs and desires. Deciding on the appropriate price and quality depends on the business's brand image and what they hope to achieve in relation to their competition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/business-strategies-competitive-advantage-4633.html|title=Business Strategies for a Competitive Advantage|website=smallbusiness.chron.com|access-date=2016-04-01}}</ref>\n\n==Underlying internal factors==\n[[Positioning (marketing)|Positioning]] is an important marketing concept. The main purpose of positioning is often to create the right perceptions in comparison to competitors. Thus, it creates competitive advantage. This positioning, or competitive advantage, is based on creating the right \"image\" or \"identity\" in the minds of the target group.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Muilwijk|first1=E.|title=Positioning|url=http://www.intemarketing.org/marketing-information/marketing-basics/positioning|website=Intemarketing|publisher=Intemarketing|accessdate=2016-09-18}}</ref> This positioning decision exists of selecting the right core competencies to build upon and emphasize.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Aaker|first1=D.

Corporate identity through corporate communication creates corporate image and reputation, with an end result of competitive advantage.<ref name=Gray>{{cite journal|last1=Gray|first1=E.

It refers to the distinct characteristics or core competencies of the organization. It is the mental picture of the company held by its audiences. Corporate communication refers to all the official and informal communication sources, through a variety of media, by which the company outsources its identity to its audiences or stakeholders. Corporate communication is the bridge between corporate identity and corporate image or reputation.<ref name=Gray/>\n\nThe above-stated process has two main objectives, namely to create the intended image in the minds of the company's principal constituents and managing the process to create a favourable reputation in the minds of the important stakeholders.<ref name=Gray/> Gray and Balmer (1998) say that a strong image can be built through a coordinated image-building campaign and reputation, on the other hand, requires a praiseworthy identity that can only be shaped through consistent performance.\n\n===Core competencies===\nA core competency is a concept introduced by Prahalad and Hamel (1990). [[Core competency|Core competencies]] are part of the corporate identity; they form the foundation of corporate competitiveness. The competitiveness of a company is based on the ability to develop core competencies.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Alexander|first1=A.|last2=Martin|first2=D.|title=Intermediaries for open innovation: A competence-based comparison of knowledge transfer offices practices|journal=Technological Forecasting & Social Change|date=2013|volume=80|pages=38\u201349|doi=10.1016/j.techfore.2012.07.013}}</ref> A core competency is, for example, a specialised knowledge, technique, or skill.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=C.|title=The integrated model of core competence and core capability|journal=Total Quality Management|date=2015|volume=26|pages=173\u2013189|doi=10.1080/14783363.2013.820024}}</ref> Yang (2015) concluded, with the examination of a long-term development model, that developing core competencies and effectively implementing core capabilities are important strategic actions for any enterprise in order to pursue high long-term profits.

A competitive advantage may include access to [[natural resources]], such as high-grade ores or a low-cost power source, highly skilled labor, geographic location, high entry barriers, and access to new technology.\n\n==Overview==\nCompetitive advantage is the leverage a business has over its competitors. This can be gained by offering clients better and greater value. Advertising products or services with lower prices or higher quality piques the interest of consumers. Target markets recognize these unique products or services. This is the reason behind brand loyalty, or why customers prefer one particular product or service over another.\n\nValue proposition is important when understanding competitive advantage. If the value proposition is effective, that is, if the value proposition offers clients better and greater value, it can produce a competitive advantage in either the product or service. The value proposition can increase customer expectations and choices.\n\n[[Michael Porter]] defined the two ways in which an organization can achieve competitive advantage over its rivals: cost advantage and [[Product differentiation|differentiation]] advantage. Cost advantage is when a business provides the same products and services as its competitors, albeit at a lesser cost.  Differentiation advantage is when a business provides better products and services as its competitors. In Porter's view, strategic management should be concerned with building and sustaining competitive advantage.<ref name=\"Porter1985\">{{cite book\n| last = Porter\n| first = Michael E.\n| year = 1985\n| title = Competitive Advantage | publisher = Free Press\n| isbn = 978-0-684-84146-5| title-link = Competitive Advantage\n}}</ref>\n\nCompetitive advantage seeks to address some of the criticisms of [[comparative advantage]]. Competitive advantage rests on the notion that cheap labor is [[ubiquitous]] and natural resources are not necessary for a good economy. The other theory, comparative advantage, can lead countries to specialize in exporting primary goods and [[raw material]]s that [[Resource_curse|trap countries]] in low-wage economies due to terms of trade. Competitive advantage attempts to correct this issue by stressing on maximizing scale economies in goods and services that garner premium prices (Stutz and Warf 2009).<ref>{{cite book|last=Warf|first=Frederick P.

In 1989, she was elected to another council, this time in Biarritz, alongside her father.  In 1990, as part of the municipal majority behind the first Deputy Mayor [[Didier Borotra]] of the [[Union for French Democracy|UDF]]-[[Centre of Social Democrats|CDS]], she passed draft legislation in opposition to build a hotel-casino on the front of the main beach of the town,<ref name=\"sudouest\" /> which caused a collapse of the council. Early municipal elections in 1991 were won by Didier Borotra, who united the local UDF, two elected [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialists]], and [[Basque nationalism|Basque nationalists]], who provided additional support.<ref>{{cite web |title=Biarritz:  Borotra L'emporte Cantonale dans L'eure |url=https://www.humanite.fr/node/286966 |publisher=L'Humanite |accessdate=2 August 2013 |language=French |date=18 March 1991}}</ref>  She left the council at the same time that her father was defeated as Mayor.  She then served as Mayor of Saint-Jean-de-Luz from 1995 until 2002, and as First Deputy Mayor since then.

She has been seating in the Assembly ever since, except when she sat in the government; this is due to the French law on ''[[Cumul des mandats]]'' (literally: \"accumulation of mandates\") that prohibit [[Cabinet of France|cabinet ministers]] from simultaneously serving as deputies in the [[National Assembly of France|French National Assembly]]; her [[National Assembly of France#Accumulation of mandates and minimum age|alternate]] as Deputy was [[Daniel Poulou]], who served from 1993 to 1995 and again from 2002 to 2011 when she served as Cabinet Minister.<ref name=\"danielpoulou\">{{cite web|title=Accueil > Archives de la XIIIe l\u00e9gislature > Les d\u00e9put\u00e9s > M.

Austin Freeman", "text_new": "{{other uses|Austin Freeman}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}\n{{Use British English|date=April 2012}}\n\n'''Richard Austin Freeman''' (11 April 1862 \u2013 28 September 1943) was a British writer of [[detective stories]], mostly featuring the medico-legal [[forensic]] [[detective|investigator]] [[Dr. Thorndyke]]. He claimed to have invented the [[inverted detective story]] (a crime fiction in which the commission of the crime is described at the beginning, usually including the identity of the perpetrator, with the story then describing the detective's attempt to solve the mystery). Freeman used some of his early experiences as a colonial [[surgeon]] in his novels.\n\nMany of the [[Dr. Thorndyke]] stories involve genuine, but often quite arcane, points of scientific knowledge, from areas such as [[tropical medicine]], [[metallurgy]] and [[toxicology]].\n\n==Early life==\nAustin Freeman was the youngest of the five children of tailor Richard Freeman and Ann Maria Dunn.  He first trained as an [[apothecary]] and then studied [[medicine]] at [[Middlesex Hospital]] Medical College, qualifying in 1887.  He specialized in ear, nose, and throat.<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref>  He married Annie Elizabeth the same year, with whom he had two sons.  He was house physician for a short time<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref>, then entered the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Service]] and was sent to [[Accra]] on the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] as an assistant surgeon<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref>.\n\n<blockquote>At this time the Gold Coast (present-day Ghana) was a group of semi-independent kingdoms, still unacculturated, subject to incursions by the European colonial powers who were eager to annex them.  The French had been attempting to buy the favor of the native kings, and a British expedition, including Freeman, set out to investigate.  It was mostly through Freeman's intelligence and tact that the expedition was not massacred, and his future seemed assured in the colonial service.<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref></blockquote>\n\nUnfortunately, he contracted [[blackwater fever]] and was sent home.<ref>Author's biography, ''A Silent Witness'', House of Stratus, 2001</ref>\n\n==Career==\nThus, he returned to [[London]] in 1891, serving for a time as acting physician in [[Holloway Prison]]<ref>Author's biography, ''A Silent Witness'', House of Stratus, 2001</ref> and an immigration examiner at the Port of London.<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref>  However, he was unable to find a permanent medical position and had precarious health still from the blackwater fever (which can take years to recover from)<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref>, so decided to settle down in Gravesend and earn money from writing fiction, while continuing to practice medicine.  His first successful stories were the Romney Pringle rogue stories published in ''[[Cassell's Magazine]]'' in 1902 and 1903<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref> written in collaboration with [[John James Pitcairn]] (1860\u20131936), medical officer at [[Holloway Prison]], and published under the ''[[nom de plume]]'' \"Clifford Ashdown\".\n\nHis first Thorndyke story, ''The Red Thumb Mark'', was published in 1907, and shortly afterwards he pioneered the [[inverted detective story]], in which the identity of the criminal is shown from the beginning.  Some short stories with this feature were collected in ''The Singing Bone'' in 1912.  During [[World War I|the First World War]] he served as an induction physician <ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref> and a captain in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] and afterwards produced a Thorndyke novel almost every year until his death in 1943. The house where he died, 94 Windmill Street in Gravesend, is now Thorndyke's Nursing Home.  Norman Donaldson wrote a full biography, ''In Search of Dr. Throndyke'', [[Bowling Green University]] Popular Press, Bowling Green, Ohio, 1971.\n\nFreeman claimed to have invented the [[inverted detective story]] in his 1912 collection of short stories ''The Singing Bone''. \"Some years ago I devised, as an experiment, an inverted detective story in two parts.  The first part was a minute and detailed description of a crime, setting forth the antecedents, motives, and all attendant circumstances.  The reader had seen the crime committed, knew all about the criminal, and was in possession of all the facts.  It would have seemed that there was nothing left to tell, but I calculated that the reader would be so occupied with the crime that he would overlook the evidence.  And so it turned out.  The second part, which described the investigation of the crime, had to most readers the effect of new matter.\"<ref>This is a quote from an essay by Freeman entitled \"The Art of the Detective Story\", which is itself quoted in ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' (Dover, New York, 1973), in the introduction by E. F. Bleiler.</ref>\n\n==Political views==\nFreeman held conservative political views.<ref name=\"am\">{{cite book |first=Angus |last=McLaren |title=Reproduction by Design: Sex, Robots, Trees, and Test-Tube Babies in Interwar Britain |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2012 |isbn=0-226-56069-4 |pages=64\u20135}}</ref> In his 1921 book ''Social Decay and Regeneration'' Freeman put forth the view that [[mechanization]] had flooded Britain with poor-quality goods and created a \"homogenized, restless, unionized working class\".<ref name=\"am\"/> Freeman supported the [[eugenics]] movement and argued that people with \"undesirable\" biological traits should be prevented from breeding through \"segregation, marriage restriction, and\n[[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]]\".<ref>McLaren, 2012, (p. 71).</ref> The book also attacked the British [[Labour movement]] and criticised the British government for permitting immigrants (whom Freeman referred to as \"Sub-Man\") to settle in Britain.

For the first twenty-five years of his career, at least, he dominated the world of British detective fiction. ... Freeman was always in the forefront of the form. Today, with [[G. K. Chesterton|Chesterton]], who is remembered for other reasons, he is one of the very few Edwardian detective story writers who are still read.\"<ref name=\"Bleiler\">R.

Bleiler</ref>\n\n\"[[Raymond Chandler]], whose essay '[[The Simple Art of Murder]]' did much toward demolishing the classical detective story, had this to say in a letter to [[Hamish Hamilton]], the British publisher: 'This man Austin Freeman is a wonderful performer.  He has no equal in his genre, and he is also a much better writer than you might think, if you were superficially inclined, because in spite of the immense leisure of his writing, he accomplishes an even suspense which is quite unexpected ... There is even a gaslight charm about his Victorian love affairs, and those wonderful walks across London ...'

He claimed to have invented the [[inverted detective story]] (a crime fiction in which the commission of the crime is described at the beginning, usually including the identity of the perpetrator, with the story then describing the detective's attempt to solve the mystery). Freeman used some of his early experiences as a colonial [[surgeon]] in his novels.\n\nMany of the [[Dr. Thorndyke]] stories involve genuine, but often quite arcane, points of scientific knowledge, from areas such as [[tropical medicine]], [[metallurgy]] and [[toxicology]].\n\n==Early life==\nAustin Freeman was the youngest of the five children of tailor Richard Freeman and Ann Maria Dunn.  He first trained as an [[apothecary]] and then studied [[medicine]] at [[Middlesex Hospital]] Medical College, qualifying in 1887.  He specialized in ear, nose, and throat.<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref>  He married Annie Elizabeth the same year, with whom he had two sons.  He was house physician for a short time<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref>, then entered the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Service]] and was sent to [[Accra]] on the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] as an assistant surgeon<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref>.\n\n<blockquote>At this time the Gold Coast (present-day Ghana) was a group of semi-independent kingdoms, still unacculturated, subject to incursions by the European colonial powers who were eager to annex them.  The French had been attempting to buy the favor of the native kings, and a British expedition, including Freeman, set out to investigate.  It was mostly through Freeman's intelligence and tact that the expedition was not massacred, and his future seemed assured in the colonial service.<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref></blockquote>\n\nUnfortunately, he contracted [[blackwater fever]] and was sent home.<ref>Author's biography, ''A Silent Witness'', House of Stratus, 2001</ref>\n\n==Career==\nThus, he returned to [[London]] in 1891, serving for a time as acting physician in [[Holloway Prison]]<ref>Author's biography, ''A Silent Witness'', House of Stratus, 2001</ref> and an immigration examiner at the Port of London<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref> but was unable to find a permanent medical position and had precarious health still from the blackwater fever (which can take years to recover from)<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref>, so decided to settle down in Gravesend and earn money from writing fiction, while continuing to practice medicine.  His first successful stories were the Romney Pringle rogue stories published in ''[[Cassell's Magazine]]'' in 1902 and 1903<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref> written in collaboration with [[John James Pitcairn]] (1860\u20131936), medical officer at [[Holloway Prison]], and published under the ''[[nom de plume]]'' \"Clifford Ashdown\".\n\nHis first Thorndyke story, ''The Red Thumb Mark'', was published in 1907, and shortly afterwards he pioneered the [[inverted detective story]], in which the identity of the criminal is shown from the beginning.  Some short stories with this feature were collected in ''The Singing Bone'' in 1912.  During [[World War I|the First World War]] he served as an induction physician <ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref> and a captain in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] and afterwards produced a Thorndyke novel almost every year until his death in 1943. The house where he died, 94 Windmill Street in Gravesend, is now Thorndyke's Nursing Home.  Norman Donaldson wrote a full biography, ''In Search of Dr. Throndyke'', [[Bowling Green University]] Popular Press, Bowling Green, Ohio, 1971.\n\nFreeman claimed to have invented the [[inverted detective story]] in his 1912 collection of short stories ''The Singing Bone''. \"Some years ago I devised, as an experiment, an inverted detective story in two parts.  The first part was a minute and detailed description of a crime, setting forth the antecedents, motives, and all attendant circumstances.  The reader had seen the crime committed, knew all about the criminal, and was in possession of all the facts.  It would have seemed that there was nothing left to tell, but I calculated that the reader would be so occupied with the crime that he would overlook the evidence.  And so it turned out.  The second part, which described the investigation of the crime, had to most readers the effect of new matter.\"<ref>This is a quote from an essay by Freeman entitled \"The Art of the Detective Story\", which is itself quoted in ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' (Dover, New York, 1973), in the introduction by E.

For the first twenty-five years of his career, at least, he dominated the world of British detective fiction. ... Freeman was always in the forefront of the form. Today, with [[G. K. Chesterton|Chesterton]], who is remembered for other reasons, he is one of the very few Edwardian detective story writers who are still read.\"<ref name=\"Bleiler\">R. Austin Freeman, ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'', 1973, Dover (New York), {{ISBN|0-486-20388-3}}, from the introduction by E. F. Bleiler</ref>\n\n\"[[Raymond Chandler]], whose essay '[[The Simple Art of Murder]]' did much toward demolishing the classical detective story, had this to say in a letter to [[Hamish Hamilton]], the British publisher: 'This man Austin Freeman is a wonderful performer.  He has no equal in his genre, and he is also a much better writer than you might think, if you were superficially inclined, because in spite of the immense leisure of his writing, he accomplishes an even suspense which is quite unexpected ...

However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''. Christian writers like [[John Milton]] and [[John Locke]] argued for limited religious toleration, while some Christians eventually came to support the concept of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] which was developed by secular authors like [[Thomas Jefferson]].

The [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades.

Heavily persecuted, these heresies were eradicated by the 14th century. The suppression of the Cathar (or \"Albigensian\") faith took the form of the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (1209\u20131229), a 20-year military campaign initiated by the Roman Catholic Church. Its violence was extreme even by medieval standards. Notable individuals who were executed for heresy in the late Middle Ages are [[Jerome of Prague]], [[John Badby]] and [[Jan Hus]]. Only the [[Waldensians]], another heretical Christian sect, managed to survive in remote areas in Northern Italy.\n\nAlso during the high Middle Ages, 1000\u20131250, the [[Crusades]] pitched Christians and Muslims against each other in a war about the possession of Jerusalem, with atrocities from both sides. There were massacres of Muslims and Jews when Jerusalem was taken by Crusaders in 1099.  After [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and later the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]] in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were prohibited. This persecution ended only under the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century. \n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]] also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Visigothic Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].)

There were no mass murders of pagans. <blockquote>It is good to bear in mind that, apart from local acts of Christian fanaticism, non-Christians were not persecuted and were even protected, as by CTh 16.10.24 (8 June 423): \u2018Sed hoc Christianis, qui vel vere sunt vel esse dicuntur, specialiter demandamus, ut Iudaeis ac paganis in quiete degentibus nihilque temptantibus turbulentum legibusque contrarium non audeant manus inferre religionis auctoritate abusi.</blockquote><ref>{{cite journal|last=O'Donnell|first=J.|year=1979|title=The Demise of Paganism|publisher= Traditio|volume=35|pages=45-88|doi=10.1017/S0362152900015002}}</ref> In the Massacre at Thessalonica, Theodosius\u2019 killed 7000 pagans who rioted over a local power struggle.

These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15</ref> The region's inhabitants resisted conquest, and, even once subjected, rebelled repeatedly in an effort to reject Christianity and reverse the conquest. As part of these campaigns, forced conversions were widespread; massacre and atrocity, combined with the capture and killing of hostages to compel surrender and conversion, were commonly used tactics.<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

Beginning with the [[Wendish Crusade]], the Church began to sponsor and endorse forced conversion through conquest, something it had hitherto not done.<ref>Haverkamp, Alfred. Medieval Germany: 1056-1273. Trans. Helga Braun and Richard Mortimer. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988. p.g. 157-158</ref> An example of how the use of forced conversion was justified, in the medieval Church, as compatible with previous Church doctrine on the subject can be found for instance in a statement made by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1201 about those who agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation:\n\n<blockquote>[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= \u2018A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity\u2019|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]]. Anglicans who argued against persecution were: [[John Locke]], [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Jeremy Taylor]],  [[Henry More]], [[John Tillotson]] and [[Gilbert Burnet]].<ref>This list is taken from: Coffey (2000), 50</ref>\n\nAll of these considered themselves Christians or were actual churchmen. John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics. At present, only individuals who are members of the Church of England at the time of the succession may become the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]].\n\n==In the United States==\n<!-- see the books by Corrigan and the one by Beneke and Grenda -->\n{{Main|Freedom of religion in the United States}}\nThe Puritan-Whig tradition of toleration did have their greatest effect not in England, but in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that would later form the United States.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\">Coffey 2000: 207.</ref> Notable tolerationists were directly involved in the founding of the colonies. [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] founded the colony of [[Rhode Island]], \"a haven for persecuted minorities,\"<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/> [[John Locke]] drafted the [[Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina]] and [[William Penn]] drew up the constitution of Pennsylvania. Voltaire pointed the readers of his ''Trait\u00e9 sur la Tol\u00e9rance'' (1763) specifically to the examples of Carolina and Pennsylvania.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/> People like [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]] and [[John Adams]] stood self-consciously in the tradition of Milton, Sidney and Locke, and extended their tolerationism further to also apply to Catholics and atheists.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-208\">Coffey 2000: 208.</ref> Coffey considers it possible to argue, \"that the tolerationist tradition of seventeenth-century England reached its fulfilment in the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]] and the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the American Constitution]].\"<ref name=\"Coffey2000-208\"/>\n\nThat the North American colonies and later the United States provided a refuge for religious minorities from Europe partly explains the higher degree of religiosity in the contemporary United States and the \"unusual sectarian quality of U.S. Protestantism\".<ref name=\"Phillips06-104\">Kevin Phillips (2006): ''American Theocracy.

For some Christians, different sects of Christianity represent \"different religions.\" These people thus mistake the survey term \"many religions\" to mean \"different sects of Christianity,\" even though that is not the commonly intended use of the phrase. What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.

However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''. Christian writers like [[John Milton]] and [[John Locke]] argued for limited religious toleration, while some Christians eventually came to support the concept of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] which was developed by secular authors like [[Thomas Jefferson]].

Christianity's definition and practice of tolerance/intolerance were influenced by that persecution in a largely negative way. However, according to Guy Stroumsa, there is still a history in early Christian thought of tolerance as a concept, though not a fully developed one, and with some ambivalence, with both inclusivity and inventing the concept of heresy in Christian thought. <ref name=\"Stroumsa\">{{cite book|last=Stroumsa|first=Guy|editor1=Graham N.Stanton|editor2=Guy G.

The [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades.

Heavily persecuted, these heresies were eradicated by the 14th century. The suppression of the Cathar (or \"Albigensian\") faith took the form of the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (1209\u20131229), a 20-year military campaign initiated by the Roman Catholic Church. Its violence was extreme even by medieval standards. Notable individuals who were executed for heresy in the late Middle Ages are [[Jerome of Prague]], [[John Badby]] and [[Jan Hus]]. Only the [[Waldensians]], another heretical Christian sect, managed to survive in remote areas in Northern Italy.\n\nAlso during the high Middle Ages, 1000\u20131250, the [[Crusades]] pitched Christians and Muslims against each other in a war about the possession of Jerusalem, with atrocities from both sides. There were massacres of Muslims and Jews when Jerusalem was taken by Crusaders in 1099.  After [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and later the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]] in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were prohibited. This persecution ended only under the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century. \n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]] also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Visigothic Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].)

There were no mass murders of pagans. <blockquote>It is good to bear in mind that, apart from local acts of Christian fanaticism, non-Christians were not persecuted and were even protected, as by CTh 16.10.24 (8 June 423): \u2018Sed hoc Christianis, qui vel vere sunt vel esse dicuntur, specialiter demandamus, ut Iudaeis ac paganis in quiete degentibus nihilque temptantibus turbulentum legibusque contrarium non audeant manus inferre religionis auctoritate abusi.</blockquote><ref>{{cite journal|last=O'Donnell|first=J.|year=1979|title=The Demise of Paganism|publisher= Traditio|volume=35|pages=45-88|doi=10.1017/S0362152900015002}}</ref> In the Massacre at Thessalonica, Theodosius\u2019 killed 7000 pagans who rioted over a local power struggle.

These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15</ref> The region's inhabitants resisted conquest, and, even once subjected, rebelled repeatedly in an effort to reject Christianity and reverse the conquest. As part of these campaigns, forced conversions were widespread; massacre and atrocity, combined with the capture and killing of hostages to compel surrender and conversion, were commonly used tactics.<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 73, 88.</ref><ref>[[Tyerman, Christopher]]. \u201cHenry of Livonia and the Ideology of Crusading,\u201d in ''Crusading and Chronicle Writing on the Medieval Baltic Frontier: A Companion to the Chronicle of Henry of Livonia'', eds, Marek Tamm, Linda Kaljundi, and Carsten Selch Jensen. Burlington, VT: Ashgate Publishing Company, 2011. pg. 23, 678-79.</ref> These tactics sometimes reached such extremes that they caused large-scale depopulation of some regions through the extermination or fleeing of local inhabitants;<ref>Forstreuter, Kurt.

Beginning with the [[Wendish Crusade]], the Church began to sponsor and endorse forced conversion through conquest, something it had hitherto not done.<ref>Haverkamp, Alfred. Medieval Germany: 1056-1273. Trans. Helga Braun and Richard Mortimer. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988. p.g. 157-158</ref> An example of how the use of forced conversion was justified, in the medieval Church, as compatible with previous Church doctrine on the subject can be found for instance in a statement made by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1201 about those who agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation:\n\n<blockquote>[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= \u2018A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity\u2019|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]]. Anglicans who argued against persecution were: [[John Locke]], [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Jeremy Taylor]],  [[Henry More]], [[John Tillotson]] and [[Gilbert Burnet]].<ref>This list is taken from: Coffey (2000), 50</ref>\n\nAll of these considered themselves Christians or were actual churchmen. John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics. At present, only individuals who are members of the Church of England at the time of the succession may become the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]].\n\n==In the United States==\n<!-- see the books by Corrigan and the one by Beneke and Grenda -->\n{{Main|Freedom of religion in the United States}}\nThe Puritan-Whig tradition of toleration did have their greatest effect not in England, but in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that would later form the United States.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\">Coffey 2000: 207.</ref> Notable tolerationists were directly involved in the founding of the colonies. [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] founded the colony of [[Rhode Island]], \"a haven for persecuted minorities,\"<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/> [[John Locke]] drafted the [[Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina]] and [[William Penn]] drew up the constitution of Pennsylvania. Voltaire pointed the readers of his ''Trait\u00e9 sur la Tol\u00e9rance'' (1763) specifically to the examples of Carolina and Pennsylvania.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/> People like [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]] and [[John Adams]] stood self-consciously in the tradition of Milton, Sidney and Locke, and extended their tolerationism further to also apply to Catholics and atheists.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-208\">Coffey 2000: 208.</ref> Coffey considers it possible to argue, \"that the tolerationist tradition of seventeenth-century England reached its fulfilment in the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]] and the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the American Constitution]].\"<ref name=\"Coffey2000-208\"/>\n\nThat the North American colonies and later the United States provided a refuge for religious minorities from Europe partly explains the higher degree of religiosity in the contemporary United States and the \"unusual sectarian quality of U.S. Protestantism\".<ref name=\"Phillips06-104\">Kevin Phillips (2006): ''American Theocracy.

For some Christians, different sects of Christianity represent \"different religions.\" These people thus mistake the survey term \"many religions\" to mean \"different sects of Christianity,\" even though that is not the commonly intended use of the phrase. What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.

These included a total of 45,707 single-barrel shotguns, 611 armoured cars and smaller numbers of carbines and pistols. Writing in 1975, he revealed that \"we had clandestinely been giving 'aid' to Vietnam since early 1958. Published American archival sources now reveal that the actual Malaysian contributions to the war effort in Vietnam included the following: \"over 5,000 Vietnamese officers trained in Malaysia; training of 150 U.S. soldiers in handling Tracker Dogs; a rather impressive list of military equipment and weapons given to Viet-Nam after the end of the Malaysian insurgency (for example, 641 armored personnel carriers, 56,000 shotguns); and a creditable amount of civil assistance (transportation equipment, cholera vaccine, and flood relief)\". It is undeniable that the Government's policy of supporting the South Vietnamese regime with arms, equipment and training was regarded by some quarters, especially the Opposition parties, as a form of interfering in the internal affairs of that country and the Tunku's valiant efforts to defend it were not convincing enough, from a purely foreign policy standpoint. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016191310/http://www.idfr.gov.my/images/stories/publication/2008/tunku.pdf |archivedate=16 October 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref>}}\n| combatant1  = {{Plainlist}}\n* {{flag|North Vietnam}}\n* {{flagdeco|Republic of South Vietnam}} [[Viet Cong]] and [[Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam|PRG]]\n* {{flagdeco|Laos}} [[Pathet Lao]]\n* {{flagdeco|Cambodia|1975}} [[Khmer Rouge]]\n* {{flagdeco|Cambodia|1973}} [[GRUNK]] <small>(1970\u20131975)</small>\n* {{flag|China}}\n* {{flag|Soviet Union|1955}}\n* {{flag|North Korea}}\n{{Endplainlist}}\n{{clist\n|bullets=no\n|title=Supported by:\n| {{nowrap|{{flagcountry|Czechoslovak Socialist Republic}}}}\n| {{flag|Cuba}}\n| {{nowrap|{{flag|East Germany}}}}\n| {{flagcountry|Polish People's Republic|1947}}\n| {{flag|Socialist Republic of Romania|name=Romania}}\n| {{flag|Hungarian People's Republic|name=Hungary}}\n| {{flag|People's Republic of Bulgaria|name=Bulgaria}}\n| {{flag|Sweden}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/why-did-sweeden-support-the-viet-cong.htm |title=Why did Sweden support the Viet Cong? |work=HistoryNet |date=25 July 2013| access-date=20 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/sweden-announces-support-to-viet-cong |title=Sweden announces support to Viet Cong |work=HISTORY.com | access-date=20 July 2016 |quote=In Sweden, Foreign Minister Torsten Nilsson reveals that Sweden has been providing assistance to the Viet Cong, including some $550,000 worth of medical supplies.

In August, the [[Gulf of Tonkin incident]] occurred, in which a U.S. destroyer was alleged to have clashed with North Vietnamese fast attack craft. In response, the U.S Congress passed the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]], giving President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] broad authorization to increase U.S. military presence. He ordered the deployment of [[Military organization|combat units]] for the first time and increased troop levels to 184,000.<ref name=AWL/> Past this point, the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) (also known as the North Vietnamese Army or NVA) engaged in more [[conventional warfare]] with U.S and South Vietnamese forces. Every year onward, there was significant build-up of U.S forces, despite little progress. U.S Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]], one of the principal architects of the war, began expressing doubts of victory by the end of 1966.<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|287}} U.S. and South Vietnam forces relied on [[air supremacy|air superiority]] and overwhelming firepower to conduct [[search and destroy]] operations, involving [[army|ground forces]], [[artillery]], and [[airstrike]]s. The U.S. also conducted a large-scale [[strategic bombing]] campaign against North Vietnam and Laos.\n\nThe [[Tet Offensive]] of 1968 showed the lack of progress with these doctrines. With the VC and PAVN mounting large-scale urban offensives throughout 1968, U.S domestic support for the war began fading. The [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) expanded following a period of neglect after Tet and was modeled after U.S doctrine. The VC sustained heavy losses during the Tet Offensive and subsequent U.S.-ARVN operations in the rest of 1968, losing over 50,000 men.<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|481}} The CIA's [[Phoenix Program]] further degraded the VC's membership and capabilities. By the end of the year, the VC insurgents held almost no territory in South Vietnam, and their recruitment dropped by over 80% in 1969, signifying a drastic reduction in guerrilla operations, necessitating increased use of PAVN regular soldiers from the north.<ref name=Pribbenow/>{{rp|247\u20139}} In 1969, North Vietnam declared a [[Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam|Provisional Revolutionary Government]] in South Vietnam in an attempt to give the reduced VC a more international stature, but the southern guerrillas from then on were sidelined as PAVN forces begun more conventional [[Combined arms]] warfare. Operations crossed national borders: Laos was invaded by North Vietnam early on, while Cambodia was used by North Vietnam as a supply route starting in 1967; the route through Cambodia began to be bombed by the U.S. in 1969, while the Laos route had been heavily bombed since 1964. The deposing of the monarch [[Norodom Sihanouk]] by the Cambodian National Assembly resulted in a PAVN invasion of the country at the request of the Khmer Rouge, escalating the Cambodian Civil War and resulting in a U.S.-RVN [[Cambodian campaign|counter-invasion]].\n\nIn 1969, following the election of U.S President Richard Nixon, a policy of \"[[Vietnamization]]\" began, which saw the conflict fought by an expanded ARVN, with U.S. forces sidelined and increasingly demoralized by domestic opposition and reduced recruitment. U.S. ground forces had largely withdrawn by early 1972 and support was limited to air support, artillery support, advisers, and materiel shipments. The ARVN, buttressed by said U.S. support, stopped the largest and first mechanized PAVN offensive to date during the [[Easter Offensive]] of 1972.The offensive resulted in heavy casualties on both sides and the failure of the PAVN to subdue South Vietnam, but the ARVN itself failed to recapture all territory, leaving its military situation difficult. The [[Paris Peace Accords]] of January 1973 saw all U.S forces withdrawn; the [[Case\u2013Church Amendment]], passed by the U.S Congress on 15 August 1973, officially ended direct U.S military involvement.<ref name=Kolko>{{cite book|last=Kolko|first=Gabriel|title=Anatomy of a War: Vietnam, the United States, and the Modern Historical Experience|url=https://archive.org/details/anatomyofwarviet00kolk|url-access=registration|publisher=Pantheon Books|year=1985|isbn=978-0394747613}}</ref>{{rp|457}} The Peace Accords were broken almost immediately, and fighting continued for two more years. [[Fall of Phnom Penh|Phnom Penh fell]] to the Khmer Rouge on 17 April 1975 while the [[1975 Spring Offensive]] saw the capture of Saigon by the PAVN on 30 April; this marked the end of the war, and North and South Vietnam were reunified the following year.\n\nThe scale of fighting was enormous: by 1970 the ARVN was the world's fourth largest army, with the PAVN being similar in size at around a million regular soldiers.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pilger|first=John|title=Heroes|publisher=South End Press|year=2001|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=dcL6w-VmjWwC&pg=PA238|isbn=9780896086661|page=238}}</ref><ref name=Tucker/>{{rp|770}} The war exacted a huge human cost in terms of fatalities (see [[Vietnam War casualties]]): estimates of the number of Vietnamese soldiers and civilians killed vary from 966,000<ref name=Hirschman/> to 3.8 million.<ref name=Obermeyer/> Some 275,000\u2013310,000 [[Khmer people|Cambodians]],<ref name=Heuveline/><ref name=Banister/><ref name=Sliwinski/> 20,000\u201362,000 [[Lao people|Laotians]],<ref name=Obermeyer/> and 58,220 U.S. service members also died in the conflict, and a further 1,626 remain [[missing in action]].<ref group=\"A\" name=\"USd&w\" />\n\nThe [[Sino-Soviet split]] re-emerged following the lull during the Vietnam War.

First, this decree was issued in 1953 for the rent and interest reduction campaign that preceded the far more radical land redistribution and party rectification campaigns (or waves) that followed during 1954\u20131956. Second, the decree was meant to apply to free areas (under the control of the Viet Minh government), not to the areas under French control that would be liberated in 1954\u20131955 and that would experience a far more violent struggle. Thus the number of 13,500 executed people seems to be a low-end estimate of the real number. This is corroborated by Edwin Moise in his recent paper \"Land Reform in North Vietnam, 1953\u20131956\" presented at the 18th Annual Conference on SE Asian Studies, Center for SE Asian Studies, University of California, Berkeley (February 2001). In this paper Moise (7\u20139) modified his earlier estimate in his 1983 book (which was 5,000) and accepted an estimate close to 15,000 executions. Moise made the case based on Hungarian reports provided by Balazs, but the document I cited above offers more direct evidence for his revised estimate. This document also suggests that the total number should be adjusted up some more, taking into consideration the later radical phase of the campaign, the unauthorized killings at the local level, and the suicides following arrest and torture (the central government bore less direct responsibility for these cases, however). |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420044800/http://www.lib.washington.edu/southeastasia/vsg/elist_2007/Newly%20released%20documents%20on%20the%20land%20reform%20.html|archivedate=20 April 2011  }} cf. {{cite journal|last=Szalontai|first=Balazs|title=Political and Economic Crisis in North Vietnam, 1955\u201356|journal=[[Cold War History (journal)|Cold War History]]|volume=5|issue=4|date=November 2005|pages=395\u2013426|doi=10.1080/14682740500284630|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/eba3f2702e3ef484dfa94ad17652f80187e8067b}} cf. {{cite book|last=Vu|first=Tuong|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uZbr9iD1HZ8C&q=15%2C000#v=snippet&q=15%2C000&f=false|title=Paths to Development in Asia: South Korea, Vietnam, China, and Indonesia|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2010|isbn=978-1139489010 |p=103 |quote=Clearly Vietnamese socialism followed a moderate path relative to China.&nbsp;...

In early 1957, South Vietnam enjoyed its first peace in over a decade. Incidents of political violence began to occur in mid-1957, but the government \"did not construe it as a campaign, considering the disorders too diffuse to warrant committing major GVN [Government of Vietnam] resources.\" By early 1959, however, Di\u1ec7m had come to regard the (increasingly frequent) disorders as an organized campaign and implemented Law 10/59, which made political violence punishable by death and property confiscation.<ref>[http://vietnam.vassar.edu/doc6.html Excerpts from Law 10/59, 6 May 1959] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723163835/http://vietnam.vassar.edu/doc6.html |date=23 July 2008 }}</ref> There had been some division among former Viet Minh whose main goal was to hold the elections promised in the Geneva Accords, leading to \"[[wildcat strike|wildcat]]\" activities separate from the other communists and anti-GVN activists.<ref name=\"WarBegan\" />\n\nIn December 1960, the Viet Cong was formally created with the intent of uniting all anti-GVN activists, including non-communists. It was formed in [[Memot District|Memot, Cambodia]], and directed through a central office known as [[Central Office for South Vietnam|COSVN]]. According to the ''Pentagon Papers'', the Viet Cong \"placed heavy emphasis on the withdrawal of American advisors and influence, on land reform and liberalization of the GVN, on [[coalition government]] and the neutralization of Vietnam.\" The identities of the leaders of the organization often were kept secret.<ref name=\"WarBegan\" />\n\nSupport for the VC was driven by peasant resentment of Diem's reversal of land reforms in the countryside. The vast majority of the population lived in villages in the countryside, where a key demand was for land reform. In areas they controlled, the Viet Minh had confiscated large private landholdings, reduced rents and debts, and leased communal lands, mostly to the poorer peasants. Diem brought the landlords back to the villages. People who were farming land they had held for years now had to return it to landlords and pay years of back rent. This rent collection was enforced by the South Vietnamese army. The divisions within villages reproduced those that had existed against the French: ''\"75 percent support for the NLF, 20 percent trying to remain neutral and 5 percent firmly pro-government\"''.<ref name=Young>{{cite book|last=Young|first=Marilyn|title=The Vietnam Wars: 1945\u20131990|publisher=Harper Perennial|year=1991|isbn=978-0060921071}}</ref>{{rp|73}}\n\n====North Vietnamese involvement====\n{{See also|North Vietnamese invasion of Laos|Ho Chi Minh trail}}\n[[File:HoCMT.png|thumb|The [[Ho Chi Minh trail]], known as the Truong Son Road by the North Vietnamese, cuts through Laos.

Kennedy defeated incumbent Vice President Richard Nixon. Although Eisenhower warned Kennedy about Laos and Vietnam, Europe and Latin America \"loomed larger than Asia on his sights.\"<ref name=Karnow/>{{rp|264}} In June 1961, he bitterly disagreed with Soviet premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] when they [[Vienna summit|met in Vienna]] to discuss key U.S.\u2013Soviet issues. Only 16 months later, the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] (16\u201328 October 1962) played out on television worldwide. It was the closest the Cold War came to escalating into a full-scale [[nuclear war]], and the U.S. raised the readiness level of [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) forces to [[DEFCON]] 2.\n\nThe Kennedy administration remained essentially committed to the Cold War foreign policy inherited from the Truman and Eisenhower administrations. In 1961, the U.S. had 50,000 troops based in South Korea, and Kennedy faced four crisis situations: the failure of the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] that he had approved on 4 April,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/161188|title=It's Time to Stop Saying that JFK Inherited the Bay of Pigs Operation from Ike|publisher=History News Network|date=12 May 2015}}</ref> settlement negotiations between the pro-Western government of Laos and the [[Pathet Lao]] communist movement in May (\"Kennedy sidestepped Laos, whose rugged terrain was no battleground for American soldiers.\"<ref name=Karnow/>{{rp|265}}), the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]] in August, and the Cuban Missile Crisis in October. These crises made Kennedy believe that another failure on the part of the United States to gain control and stop communist expansion would fatally damage U.S. credibility with its allies and his own reputation. Kennedy was thus determined to \"draw a line in the sand\" and prevent a communist victory in Vietnam. He told James Reston of ''[[The New York Times]]'' immediately after his Vienna summit meeting with Khrushchev, \"Now we have a problem making our power credible and Vietnam looks like the place.\"<ref>[http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/goldzwig.htm The case of John F.

''A Grand Delusion'', Basic Books, 2002.</ref>\n\n[[File:South Vietnam Map.jpg|thumb|left|[[South Vietnam]], Military Regions, 1967]]\n\nKennedy's policy toward South Vietnam rested on the assumption that Di\u1ec7m and his forces had to ultimately defeat the guerrillas on their own. He was against the deployment of American combat troops and observed that \"to introduce U.S. forces in large numbers there today, while it might have an initially favorable military impact, would almost certainly lead to adverse political and, in the long run, adverse military consequences.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|VTF|1969|loc=IV.

Poor leadership, corruption, and political promotions all played a part in weakening the ARVN. The frequency of guerrilla attacks rose as the insurgency gathered steam. While Hanoi's support for the Viet Cong played a role, South Vietnamese governmental incompetence was at the core of the crisis.<ref name=McNamara/>{{rp|369}}\n\nOne major issue Kennedy raised was whether the Soviet space and missile programs had surpassed those of the United States. Although Kennedy stressed long-range missile parity with the Soviets, he was also interested in using [[special forces]] for [[counterinsurgency]] warfare in Third World countries threatened by communist insurgencies. Although they were originally intended for use behind front lines after a conventional Soviet invasion of Europe, Kennedy believed that the guerrilla tactics employed by special forces such as the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Berets]] would be effective in a \"brush fire\" war in Vietnam.\n\n[[File:President meets with Secretary of Defense.

It was hoped these new communities would provide security for the peasants and strengthen the tie between them and the central government. However, by November 1963 the program had waned, and it officially ended in 1964.<ref name=Tucker/>{{rp|1070}}\n\nOn 23 July 1962, fourteen nations, including China, South Vietnam, the Soviet Union, North Vietnam and the United States, signed an [[International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos|agreement]] promising to respect the neutrality of Laos.\n\n===Ousting and assassination of Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m===\n{{Main|Cable 243|Arrest and assassination of Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m|Buddhist crisis| Krulak Mendenhall mission|McNamara Taylor mission|1963 South Vietnamese coup|Reaction to the 1963 South Vietnamese coup}}\n{{See also|Role of the United States in the Vietnam War#John F.

Cao was a Catholic who had been promoted due to religion and fidelity rather than skill, and his main job was to preserve his forces to stave off coup attempts; he had earlier vomited during a communist attack. Some policymakers in Washington began to conclude that Di\u1ec7m was incapable of defeating the communists and might even make a deal with Ho Chi Minh. He seemed concerned only with fending off coups and had become more paranoid after attempts in 1960 and 1962, which he partly attributed to U.S. encouragement. As [[Robert F.

This resulted in mass protests against discriminatory policies that gave privileges to the Catholic Church and its adherents over the Buddhist majority. Di\u1ec7m's elder brother [[Pierre Martin Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Th\u1ee5c|Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Th\u1ee5c]] was the Archbishop of Hu\u1ebf and aggressively blurred the separation between church and state. Thuc's anniversary celebrations shortly before Vesak had been bankrolled by the government, and Vatican flags were displayed prominently. There had also been reports of Buddhist pagodas being demolished by Catholic paramilitaries throughout Di\u1ec7m's rule. Di\u1ec7m refused to make concessions to the Buddhist majority or take responsibility for the deaths. On 21 August 1963, the ARVN [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces|Special Forces]] of Colonel [[L\u00ea Quang Tung]], loyal to Di\u1ec7m's younger brother Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Nhu, [[X\u00e1 L\u1ee3i Pagoda raids|raided pagodas]] across Vietnam, causing widespread damage and destruction and leaving a death toll estimated to range into the hundreds.\n\nU.S. officials began discussing the possibility of a [[regime change]] during the middle of 1963. The [[United States Department of State]] was generally in favor of encouraging a coup, while the Defense Department favored Di\u1ec7m. Chief among the proposed changes was the removal of Di\u1ec7m's younger brother Nhu, who controlled the secret police and special forces, and was seen as the man behind the Buddhist repression and more generally the architect of the Ng\u00f4 family's rule. This proposal was conveyed to the U.S. embassy in Saigon in [[Cable 243]].\n\n[[File:Corpse of Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m in the 1963 coup.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m]] after being shot and killed in a coup on 2 November 1963]]\n\nThe CIA was in contact with generals planning to remove Di\u1ec7m. They were told that the United States would not oppose such a move nor punish the generals by cutting off aid.

When Kennedy was informed, Maxwell Taylor remembered that he \"rushed from the room with a look of shock and dismay on his face.\"<ref name=Karnow/>{{rp|326}} Kennedy had not anticipated Di\u1ec7m's murder.

Hanoi took advantage of the situation and increased its support for the guerrillas. South Vietnam entered a period of extreme political instability, as one military government toppled another in quick succession.

In Vietnam, one notable film set during Operation Linebacker II was the film ''[[Girl from Hanoi]]'' (1975) depicting war-time life in Hanoi. Another notable work was the diary of \u0110\u1eb7ng Th\u00f9y Tr\u00e2m, a Vietnamese doctor who enlisted in the Southern battlefield, and was killed at the age of 27 by US forces near [[Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i]].

Further cinematic representations were released during the 1970s and 1980s, including [[Michael Cimino]]'s ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'' (1978), [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979), [[Oliver Stone]]'s ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'' (1986)&nbsp;\u2013 based on his service in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War, [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'' (1987), ''[[Hamburger Hill]]'' (1987), ''[[Born on the Fourth of July (film)|Born on the Fourth of July]]'' (1989), ''[[Casualties of War]]'' (1989), ''[[The Siege of Firebase Gloria]]'' (1989), and ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' (1994).

The band [[Country Joe and the Fish]] recorded ''[[The \"Fish\" Cheer/I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die Rag]]'' in 1965, and it became one of the most influential anti-Vietnam protest anthems.<ref name=Tucker/>{{rp|}} Many songwriters and musicians supported the anti-war movement, including [[Pete Seeger]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Peggy Seeger]], [[Ewan MacColl]], [[Barbara Dane]], [[The Critics Group]], [[Phil Ochs]], [[John Lennon]], [[Nina Simone]], [[Neil Young]], [[Tom Paxton]], [[Jimmy Cliff]] and [[Arlo Guthrie]]. The modern classical composer [[George Crumb]] composed a string quartet, a [[threnody]], regarding the war in 1970 titled [[Black Angels (Crumb)|''Black Angels'']].\n\nThe war is also depicted in popular [[video game]]s, especially in [[first-person shooter]] [[Wargame (video games)|war]] [[genre]], such as ''[[Line of Sight: Vietnam]]'' (2003)'', [[Vietcong (video game)|Vietcong]]'' (2003), ''[[Battlefield Vietnam]]'' (2004), ''[[Vietcong: Fist Alpha]]'' (2004), ''[[Elite Warriors: Vietnam]]'' (2005), ''[[The Hell in Vietnam]]'' (2008), ''[[Battlefield: Bad Company 2: Vietnam]]'' (2010), ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'' (2010), ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops: Declassified]]'' (2012), ''[[Rising Storm 2: Vietnam]]'' (2017), and in ''[[Far Cry 5#Downloadable content|Far Cry 5]]'' (2018) as an [[Downloadable content|additional content]].

These included a total of 45,707 single-barrel shotguns, 611 armoured cars and smaller numbers of carbines and pistols. Writing in 1975, he revealed that \"we had clandestinely been giving 'aid' to Vietnam since early 1958. Published American archival sources now reveal that the actual Malaysian contributions to the war effort in Vietnam included the following: \"over 5,000 Vietnamese officers trained in Malaysia; training of 150 U.S. soldiers in handling Tracker Dogs; a rather impressive list of military equipment and weapons given to Viet-Nam after the end of the Malaysian insurgency (for example, 641 armored personnel carriers, 56,000 shotguns); and a creditable amount of civil assistance (transportation equipment, cholera vaccine, and flood relief)\". It is undeniable that the Government's policy of supporting the South Vietnamese regime with arms, equipment and training was regarded by some quarters, especially the Opposition parties, as a form of interfering in the internal affairs of that country and the Tunku's valiant efforts to defend it were not convincing enough, from a purely foreign policy standpoint. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016191310/http://www.idfr.gov.my/images/stories/publication/2008/tunku.pdf |archivedate=16 October 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref>}}\n| combatant1  = {{Plainlist}}\n* {{flag|North Vietnam}}\n* {{flagdeco|Republic of South Vietnam}} [[Viet Cong]] and [[Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam|PRG]]\n* {{flagdeco|Laos}} [[Pathet Lao]]\n* {{flagdeco|Cambodia|1975}} [[Khmer Rouge]]\n* {{flagdeco|Cambodia|1973}} [[GRUNK]] <small>(1970\u20131975)</small>\n* {{flag|China}}\n* {{flag|Soviet Union|1955}}\n* {{flag|North Korea}}\n{{Endplainlist}}\n{{clist\n|bullets=no\n|title=Supported by:\n| {{nowrap|{{flagcountry|Czechoslovak Socialist Republic}}}}\n| {{flag|Cuba}}\n| {{nowrap|{{flag|East Germany}}}}\n| {{flagcountry|Polish People's Republic|1947}}\n| {{flag|Socialist Republic of Romania|name=Romania}}\n| {{flag|Hungarian People's Republic|name=Hungary}}\n| {{flag|People's Republic of Bulgaria|name=Bulgaria}}\n| {{flag|Sweden}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/why-did-sweeden-support-the-viet-cong.htm |title=Why did Sweden support the Viet Cong? |work=HistoryNet |date=25 July 2013| access-date=20 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/sweden-announces-support-to-viet-cong |title=Sweden announces support to Viet Cong |work=HISTORY.com | access-date=20 July 2016 |quote=In Sweden, Foreign Minister Torsten Nilsson reveals that Sweden has been providing assistance to the Viet Cong, including some $550,000 worth of medical supplies.

With the VC and PAVN mounting large-scale urban offensives throughout 1968, U.S domestic support for the war began fading. The [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) expanded following a period of neglect after Tet and was modeled after U.S doctrine. The VC sustained heavy losses during the Tet Offensive and subsequent U.S.-ARVN operations in the rest of 1968, losing over 50,000 men.<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|481}} The CIA's [[Phoenix Program]] further degraded the VC's membership and capabilities. By the end of the year, the VC insurgents held almost no territory in South Vietnam, and their recruitment dropped by over 80% in 1969, signifying a drastic reduction in guerrilla operations, necessitating increased use of PAVN regular soldiers from the north.<ref name=Pribbenow/>{{rp|247\u20139}} In 1969, North Vietnam declared a [[Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam|Provisional Revolutionary Government]] in South Vietnam in an attempt to give the reduced VC a more international stature, but the southern guerrillas from then on were sidelined as PAVN forces begun more conventional [[Combined arms]] warfare. Operations crossed national borders: Laos was invaded by North Vietnam early on, while Cambodia was used by North Vietnam as a supply route starting in 1967; the route through Cambodia began to be bombed by the U.S. in 1969, while the Laos route had been heavily bombed since 1964. The deposing of the monarch [[Norodom Sihanouk]] by the Cambodian National Assembly resulted in a PAVN invasion of the country at the request of the Khmer Rouge, escalating the Cambodian Civil War and resulting in a U.S.-RVN [[Cambodian campaign|counter-invasion]].\n\nIn 1969, following the election of U.S President Richard Nixon, a policy of \"[[Vietnamization]]\" began, which saw the conflict fought by an expanded ARVN, with U.S. forces sidelined and increasingly demoralized by domestic opposition and reduced recruitment. U.S. ground forces had largely withdrawn by early 1972 and support was limited to air support, artillery support, advisers, and materiel shipments. The ARVN, buttressed by said U.S. support, stopped the largest and first mechanized PAVN offensive to date during the [[Easter Offensive]] of 1972.The offensive resulted in heavy casualties on both sides and the failure of the PAVN to subdue South Vietnam, but the ARVN itself failed to recapture all territory, leaving its military situation difficult. The [[Paris Peace Accords]] of January 1973 saw all U.S forces withdrawn; the [[Case\u2013Church Amendment]], passed by the U.S Congress on 15 August 1973, officially ended direct U.S military involvement.<ref name=Kolko>{{cite book|last=Kolko|first=Gabriel|title=Anatomy of a War: Vietnam, the United States, and the Modern Historical Experience|url=https://archive.org/details/anatomyofwarviet00kolk|url-access=registration|publisher=Pantheon Books|year=1985|isbn=978-0394747613}}</ref>{{rp|457}} The Peace Accords were broken almost immediately, and fighting continued for two more years.

First, this decree was issued in 1953 for the rent and interest reduction campaign that preceded the far more radical land redistribution and party rectification campaigns (or waves) that followed during 1954\u20131956. Second, the decree was meant to apply to free areas (under the control of the Viet Minh government), not to the areas under French control that would be liberated in 1954\u20131955 and that would experience a far more violent struggle. Thus the number of 13,500 executed people seems to be a low-end estimate of the real number. This is corroborated by Edwin Moise in his recent paper \"Land Reform in North Vietnam, 1953\u20131956\" presented at the 18th Annual Conference on SE Asian Studies, Center for SE Asian Studies, University of California, Berkeley (February 2001). In this paper Moise (7\u20139) modified his earlier estimate in his 1983 book (which was 5,000) and accepted an estimate close to 15,000 executions. Moise made the case based on Hungarian reports provided by Balazs, but the document I cited above offers more direct evidence for his revised estimate. This document also suggests that the total number should be adjusted up some more, taking into consideration the later radical phase of the campaign, the unauthorized killings at the local level, and the suicides following arrest and torture (the central government bore less direct responsibility for these cases, however). |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420044800/http://www.lib.washington.edu/southeastasia/vsg/elist_2007/Newly%20released%20documents%20on%20the%20land%20reform%20.html|archivedate=20 April 2011  }} cf. {{cite journal|last=Szalontai|first=Balazs|title=Political and Economic Crisis in North Vietnam, 1955\u201356|journal=[[Cold War History (journal)|Cold War History]]|volume=5|issue=4|date=November 2005|pages=395\u2013426|doi=10.1080/14682740500284630|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/eba3f2702e3ef484dfa94ad17652f80187e8067b}} cf. {{cite book|last=Vu|first=Tuong|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uZbr9iD1HZ8C&q=15%2C000#v=snippet&q=15%2C000&f=false|title=Paths to Development in Asia: South Korea, Vietnam, China, and Indonesia|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2010|isbn=978-1139489010 |p=103 |quote=Clearly Vietnamese socialism followed a moderate path relative to China.&nbsp;...

In early 1957, South Vietnam enjoyed its first peace in over a decade. Incidents of political violence began to occur in mid-1957, but the government \"did not construe it as a campaign, considering the disorders too diffuse to warrant committing major GVN [Government of Vietnam] resources.\" By early 1959, however, Di\u1ec7m had come to regard the (increasingly frequent) disorders as an organized campaign and implemented Law 10/59, which made political violence punishable by death and property confiscation.<ref>[http://vietnam.vassar.edu/doc6.html Excerpts from Law 10/59, 6 May 1959] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723163835/http://vietnam.vassar.edu/doc6.html |date=23 July 2008 }}</ref> There had been some division among former Viet Minh whose main goal was to hold the elections promised in the Geneva Accords, leading to \"[[wildcat strike|wildcat]]\" activities separate from the other communists and anti-GVN activists.<ref name=\"WarBegan\" />\n\nIn December 1960, the Viet Cong was formally created with the intent of uniting all anti-GVN activists, including non-communists. It was formed in [[Memot District|Memot, Cambodia]], and directed through a central office known as [[Central Office for South Vietnam|COSVN]]. According to the ''Pentagon Papers'', the Viet Cong \"placed heavy emphasis on the withdrawal of American advisors and influence, on land reform and liberalization of the GVN, on [[coalition government]] and the neutralization of Vietnam.\" The identities of the leaders of the organization often were kept secret.<ref name=\"WarBegan\" />\n\nSupport for the VC was driven by peasant resentment of Diem's reversal of land reforms in the countryside. The vast majority of the population lived in villages in the countryside, where a key demand was for land reform. In areas they controlled, the Viet Minh had confiscated large private landholdings, reduced rents and debts, and leased communal lands, mostly to the poorer peasants. Diem brought the landlords back to the villages. People who were farming land they had held for years now had to return it to landlords and pay years of back rent. This rent collection was enforced by the South Vietnamese army.

Kennedy defeated incumbent Vice President Richard Nixon. Although Eisenhower warned Kennedy about Laos and Vietnam, Europe and Latin America \"loomed larger than Asia on his sights.\"<ref name=Karnow/>{{rp|264}} In June 1961, he bitterly disagreed with Soviet premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] when they [[Vienna summit|met in Vienna]] to discuss key U.S.\u2013Soviet issues. Only 16 months later, the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] (16\u201328 October 1962) played out on television worldwide. It was the closest the Cold War came to escalating into a full-scale [[nuclear war]], and the U.S. raised the readiness level of [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) forces to [[DEFCON]] 2.\n\nThe Kennedy administration remained essentially committed to the Cold War foreign policy inherited from the Truman and Eisenhower administrations. In 1961, the U.S. had 50,000 troops based in South Korea, and Kennedy faced four crisis situations: the failure of the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] that he had approved on 4 April,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/161188|title=It's Time to Stop Saying that JFK Inherited the Bay of Pigs Operation from Ike|publisher=History News Network|date=12 May 2015}}</ref> settlement negotiations between the pro-Western government of Laos and the [[Pathet Lao]] communist movement in May (\"Kennedy sidestepped Laos, whose rugged terrain was no battleground for American soldiers.\"<ref name=Karnow/>{{rp|265}}), the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]] in August, and the Cuban Missile Crisis in October. These crises made Kennedy believe that another failure on the part of the United States to gain control and stop communist expansion would fatally damage U.S. credibility with its allies and his own reputation. Kennedy was thus determined to \"draw a line in the sand\" and prevent a communist victory in Vietnam. He told James Reston of ''[[The New York Times]]'' immediately after his Vienna summit meeting with Khrushchev, \"Now we have a problem making our power credible and Vietnam looks like the place.\"<ref>[http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/goldzwig.htm The case of John F.

He was against the deployment of American combat troops and observed that \"to introduce U.S. forces in large numbers there today, while it might have an initially favorable military impact, would almost certainly lead to adverse political and, in the long run, adverse military consequences.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|VTF|1969|loc=IV.

Poor leadership, corruption, and political promotions all played a part in weakening the ARVN. The frequency of guerrilla attacks rose as the insurgency gathered steam. While Hanoi's support for the Viet Cong played a role, South Vietnamese governmental incompetence was at the core of the crisis.<ref name=McNamara/>{{rp|369}}\n\nOne major issue Kennedy raised was whether the Soviet space and missile programs had surpassed those of the United States. Although Kennedy stressed long-range missile parity with the Soviets, he was also interested in using [[special forces]] for [[counterinsurgency]] warfare in Third World countries threatened by communist insurgencies. Although they were originally intended for use behind front lines after a conventional Soviet invasion of Europe, Kennedy believed that the guerrilla tactics employed by special forces such as the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Berets]] would be effective in a \"brush fire\" war in Vietnam.\n\n[[File:President meets with Secretary of Defense.

He seemed concerned only with fending off coups and had become more paranoid after attempts in 1960 and 1962, which he partly attributed to U.S. encouragement. As [[Robert F.

This resulted in mass protests against discriminatory policies that gave privileges to the Catholic Church and its adherents over the Buddhist majority.

Thuc's anniversary celebrations shortly before Vesak had been bankrolled by the government, and Vatican flags were displayed prominently. There had also been reports of Buddhist pagodas being demolished by Catholic paramilitaries throughout Di\u1ec7m's rule. Di\u1ec7m refused to make concessions to the Buddhist majority or take responsibility for the deaths. On 21 August 1963, the ARVN [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces|Special Forces]] of Colonel [[L\u00ea Quang Tung]], loyal to Di\u1ec7m's younger brother Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Nhu, [[X\u00e1 L\u1ee3i Pagoda raids|raided pagodas]] across Vietnam, causing widespread damage and destruction and leaving a death toll estimated to range into the hundreds.\n\nU.S. officials began discussing the possibility of a [[regime change]] during the middle of 1963. The [[United States Department of State]] was generally in favor of encouraging a coup, while the Defense Department favored Di\u1ec7m. Chief among the proposed changes was the removal of Di\u1ec7m's younger brother Nhu, who controlled the secret police and special forces, and was seen as the man behind the Buddhist repression and more generally the architect of the Ng\u00f4 family's rule. This proposal was conveyed to the U.S. embassy in Saigon in [[Cable 243]].\n\n[[File:Corpse of Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m in the 1963 coup.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m]] after being shot and killed in a coup on 2 November 1963]]\n\nThe CIA was in contact with generals planning to remove Di\u1ec7m.

In Vietnam the diary has often been compared to ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl|The Diary of Anne Frank]]'' and both are used in literary education.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://english.vov.vn/society/amsterdam-mayor-visits-hanoiamsterdam-high-school-284797.vov|title=Amsterdam Mayor visits Hanoi-Amsterdam High School|last=http://vov.vn/|date=10 December 2014|work=VOV Online Newspaper|access-date=17 June 2018}}</ref> Another Vietnamese film produced was ''[[The Abandoned Field: Free Fire Zone]]'' (''C\u00e1nh \u0111\u1ed3ng hoang)'' in 1979 which weaves the narrative of living on the ground in a US \"free-fire zone\" as well as perspectives from US helicopters.\n\nIn American popular culture, the \"Crazy Vietnam Veteran\", who was suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder, became a common [[stock character]] after the war.\n\nOne of the first major films based on the Vietnam War was [[John Wayne]]'s pro-war film, ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]'' (1968). Further cinematic representations were released during the 1970s and 1980s, including [[Michael Cimino]]'s ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'' (1978), [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979), [[Oliver Stone]]'s ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'' (1986)&nbsp;\u2013 based on his service in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War, [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'' (1987), ''[[Hamburger Hill]]'' (1987), ''[[Born on the Fourth of July (film)|Born on the Fourth of July]]'' (1989), ''[[Casualties of War]]'' (1989), ''[[The Siege of Firebase Gloria]]'' (1989), and ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' (1994). Later films would include ''[[We Were Soldiers]]'' (2002) and ''[[Rescue Dawn]]'' (2007).<ref name=Tucker/>{{rp|}}\n\nThe war also influenced a generation of musicians and songwriters in Vietnam and the United States, both anti-war and pro/anti-communist. The band [[Country Joe and the Fish]] recorded ''[[The \"Fish\" Cheer/I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die Rag]]'' in 1965, and it became one of the most influential anti-Vietnam protest anthems.<ref name=Tucker/>{{rp|}} Many songwriters and musicians supported the anti-war movement, including [[Pete Seeger]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Peggy Seeger]], [[Ewan MacColl]], [[Barbara Dane]], [[The Critics Group]], [[Phil Ochs]], [[John Lennon]], [[Nina Simone]], [[Neil Young]], [[Tom Paxton]], [[Jimmy Cliff]] and [[Arlo Guthrie]]. The modern classical composer [[George Crumb]] composed a string quartet, a [[threnody]], regarding the war in 1970 titled [[Black Angels (Crumb)|''Black Angels'']].\n\nThe war is also depicted in popular [[video game]]s, especially in [[first-person shooter]] [[Wargame (video games)|war]] [[genre]], such as ''[[Line of Sight: Vietnam]]'' (2003)'', [[Vietcong (video game)|Vietcong]]'' (2003), ''[[Battlefield Vietnam]]'' (2004), ''[[Vietcong: Fist Alpha]]'' (2004), ''[[Elite Warriors: Vietnam]]'' (2005), ''[[The Hell in Vietnam]]'' (2008), ''[[Battlefield: Bad Company 2: Vietnam]]'' (2010), ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'' (2010), ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops: Declassified]]'' (2012), ''[[Rising Storm 2: Vietnam]]'' (2017), and in ''[[Far Cry 5#Downloadable content|Far Cry 5]]'' (2018) as an [[Downloadable content|additional content]]. The war also saw [[depiction]] in [[Video game genre|another genre]], in the form of [[third-person shooter]], [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]], [[real-time strategy]] and [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]], such as ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II#Other media|Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' (1985), ''[[Caliber .50]]'' (1989), ''[[Vietcong 2]]'' (2005), ''[[Made Man (video game)|Made Man]]'' (2006), ''[[Gunboat (video game)|Gunboat]]'' (1990) and ''[[Strike Fighters 2: Vietnam]]'' (2009).\n\n====Myths==== <!-- Redirect target of [[Mythology of the Vietnam War]] and [[Vietnam War myths]] -->\nMyths play a central role in the [[historiography]] of the Vietnam War, and have become a part of the [[culture of the United States]]. Much like the general historiography of the war, discussion of myth has focused on US experiences, but changing myths of war have also played a role in [[Vietnam]]ese and [[Australia]]n historiography.\n\nRecent scholarship has focused on \"myth-busting\",<ref name=Milam/>{{rp|373}} attacking the previous orthodox and revisionist schools of American historiography of the Vietnam War.

He is best known for his collaborations with high profile artists such as [[Xzibit]], [[Kurupt]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Too $hort]], [[B-Real]] and [[Cypress Hill]]. He is also recognized as a protege of B-Real of Cypress Hill and Xzibit.\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===2005-2010: ''Audio Hustlaz, Vol. 1'', and ''Smoke N Mirrors''===\nThe beginning of his career started in 2005 when he met Kurupt in Philadelphia. At the time he was in a group called Tangled Thoughts and Kurupt urged them to move to California. They took him up on the suggestion and released an album with Kurupt titled as ''Philly 2 Cali'' in 2007.\n\nIn 2008, Demrick released his solo debut mixtape titled ''Audio Hustlaz, Vol. 1'', which was presented by [[DJ Skee]]. B-Real contributed to the mixtape as a producer and featured on several tracks. Later that year, Demrick released the ''Homeland Security'' mixtape, which was a collaboration project with Shady/Interscope\u2019s artist [[Cashis]]. ''Homeland Security'' was hosted by DJ Whoo Kid and featured tracks with Royce Da 5\u20199, Crooked I and Freeway among others.\n\nDemrick was also featured on B-Real\u2019s first solo debut album, ''[[Smoke N Mirrors]]'' (2009), making appearances on 5 of the 15 songs, including the single \"Don\u2019t Ya Dare Laugh\". With that album, B-Real and Demrick spent a lot of time touring overseas. In the middle of 09\u2019, Demrick\u2019s appearance on DJ Muggs' ''[[Soul Assassins: Intermission]]'' album, which landed 2,000,000 hits on YouTube for its first single \"Figure It Out\". Due to the success of that song he spent two years touring with Xzibit.\n\nIn 2010 Cypress Hill released their eighth studio album titled \u201cRise Up\u201d on [[EMI]]\u2019s Priority Records. Demrick was featured on the street single \"It Ain\u2019t Nothin\". The video for this single received rotation on all television outlets and landed him on Last Call with Carson Daly. He also went on tour with Cypress, performing at festivals like Rock Am Ring and Rockin Rio. At the end of the year Demrick teamed up with DJ Fingaz, for yet another mixtape titled as ''De Is for Demrick''.\n\n===2011-present: ''Urban Ammo'', ''#HeadsUP'', ''All The Wrong Things'' & ''Serial Killers''===\nIn 2011, Xzibit and Demrick created a music catalog for the company Extreme Music/Sony ATV titled as ''Urban Ammo''. From that catalog, they chose two digital singles, including \"Man on the Moon\" and \"What It Is\".

Due to the success of that song he spent two years touring with Xzibit.\n\nIn 2010 Cypress Hill released their eighth studio album titled \u201cRise Up\u201d on [[EMI]]\u2019s Priority Records. Demrick was featured on the street single \"It Ain\u2019t Nothin\". The video for this single received rotation on all television outlets and landed him on Last Call with Carson Daly. He also went on tour with Cypress, performing at festivals like Rock Am Ring and Rockin Rio. At the end of the year Demrick teamed up with DJ Fingaz, for yet another mixtape titled as ''De Is for Demrick''.\n\n===2011-present: ''Urban Ammo'', ''#HeadsUP'', ''All The Wrong Things'' & ''Serial Killers''===\nIn 2011, Xzibit and Demrick created a music catalog for the company Extreme Music/Sony ATV titled as ''Urban Ammo''. From that catalog, they chose two digital singles, including \"Man on the Moon\" and \"What It Is\". These videos were shot by director Matt Alonzo and led to rotation on MTV.\nIn mid-2011, Demrick released an EP titled ''Neva Look Back'', which was produced solely by [[Scoop DeVille]]. The EP had three singles \"What\u2019s Good\", \"Ready 2 Go\" and \"What\u2019s Good (Remix)\".\n\nDemrick released his fourth early mixtape ''#Heads Up'', which was released in 2011.
