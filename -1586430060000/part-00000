The piston acceleration is directly proportional to the magnitude of the G-forces experienced by the piston-connecting rod assembly. As long as the G-forces acting on the piston-connecting rod assembly multiplied by their own mass is less than the compressive and tensile strengths of the materials they are constructed from and as long as it does not exceed the bearing load limits, the engine can safely rev without succumbing to physical or structural failure.\n\nRedlines vary anywhere from a few hundred [[revolutions per minute]] (rpm) (in very large engines such as those in trains and generators) to more than 10,000 rpm (in smaller, usually high-performance engines such as motorcycles and sports cars with [[pistonless rotary engine]]s). [[Diesel engine]]s normally have lower redlines than comparatively sized [[gasoline engine]]s, largely because of fuel-atomization limitations. Gasoline automobile engines typically will have a redline at around 5500 to 7000&nbsp;rpm. The Aston Martin Valkyrie has the highest redline of a piston-engine road car rated at 11,100 rpm. The [[Mazda Wankel engine#13B-MSP Renesis|Renesis]] in the [[Mazda RX-8]] has the highest redline of a production rotary-engine road car rated at 9000&nbsp;rpm.\n\nIn contrast, some older [[Overhead valve|OHV]] engines had redlines as low as 4800&nbsp;rpm, mostly due to the engines being designed and built for low-end power and economy during the late 1960s all the way to the early 1990s. One main reason OHV engines have lower redlines is valve float. At high speeds, the valve spring simply cannot keep the tappet or roller on the camshaft. After the valve opens, the valve spring does not have enough force to push the mass of the rocker arm, push rod, and lifter down on the cam before the next combustion cycle. Overhead cam engines eliminate many of the components, and moving mass, used on OHV engines. Lower redlines, however, do not necessarily mean low performance, as some skeptics sometimes assume. For example, a Supercharged Buick 3800 V6 with a redline anywhere from 5500 to 6000 has a torque curve that peaks at 2600\u20133600&nbsp;rpm, yet the engine is a strong performer from takeoff all the way through to the redline.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nMotorcycle engines can have even higher redlines because of their comparatively lower [[reciprocating mass]]. For example, the 1986\u20131996 Honda CBR250RR has a redline of about 19,000&nbsp;rpm. (Though due to regulations in Japanese motorcycle manufacturing this was later lowered to 18,000). Higher yet is the redline of a modern [[Formula One]] car. Regulations in 2010 limit the maximum engine rotation to 18,000&nbsp;rpm [http://www.formula1.com/news/features/2010/3/10487.html], but during the 2006 season, engine speeds reached over 20,000&nbsp;rpm on the [[Cosworth]] engine.\n\n==Rev limiter and implementation==\nThe actual term ''redline'' comes from the red bars that are displayed on [[tachometer]]s in cars starting at the rpm that denotes the redline for the specific engine. Operating an engine in this area is known as ''redlining''. Straying into this area usually does not mean instant engine failure, but may increase the chances of damaging the engine.\n\nMost modern cars have computer systems that prevent the engine from straying too far into the redline by cutting fuel flow through the [[Fuel injection|fuel injector]]s/[[common rail|fuel rail (in a direct-injected engine)]]/[[carburetor]] or by disabling the ignition system until the engine drops to a safer operating speed. This device is known as a [[rev limiter]] and is usually set to an RPM value at redline or a few hundred RPM above. Most [[Electronic Control Unit]]s (ECUs) of [[automatic transmission]] cars will upshift before the engine hits the redline even with maximum [[acceleration]] (The ECU in a sports car's automatic transmission will allow the engine to go nearer the redline or hit the redline before upshifting). If [[manual override]] is used, the engine may go past redline for a brief amount of time before the ECU will auto-upshift. When the car is in top gear and the engine is in redline (due to high speed), the ECU will cut fuel to the engine, forcing it to decelerate until the engine begins operating ''below'' the redline at which point it will release fuel back to the engine, allowing it to operate once again.\n\nHowever, even with these electronic protection systems, a car is not prevented from redlining through inadvertent gear engagement. If a driver accidentally selects a lower gear when trying to shift up or selects a lower gear than intended while shifting down (as in a motorbike [[sequential manual transmission]]), the engine will be forced to rapidly rev-up to match the speed of the drivetrain. If this happens while the engine is at high rpms, it may dramatically exceed the redline. For example, if the operator is driving close to redline in 3rd gear and attempts to shift to 4th gear but unintentionally puts the car in 2nd by mistake, the transmission will be spinning much faster than the engine, and when the clutch is released the engine's rpm will increase rapidly. It will lead to a rough and very noticeable [[engine braking]], and likely engine damage. This is often known as a \"money shift\" because of the likelihood of engine damage and the expense of fixing the engine.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Power band]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Automotive engine |collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Engine technology|Redline]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|engine speed|}}\n{{multiple issues|{{original research|date=April 2015}}\n{{Refimprove|date=September 2008}}}}\n[[Image:Honda CBR 600 tachometer.jpg|thumb|[[Tachometer]] showing red lines above 14,000&nbsp;rpm.]]\n'''Redline''' refers to the maximum engine [[rotational speed|speed]] at which an [[internal combustion engine]] or [[traction motor]] and its components are designed to operate without causing damage to the components themselves or other parts of the engine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/glossary/4534/caranddrivercom-glossary-of-terms.html#r|title=Glossary of Terms|author=|date=|website=caranddriver.com}}</ref> The redline of an engine depends on various factors such as [[Stroke (engines)|stroke]], mass of the components, [[Engine displacement|displacement]], composition of components, and balance of components. \n\nThe word is also used as a verb, meaning to ride or drive an automotive vehicle at its maximum engine speed.\n\n==Variation of redline==\nThe acceleration, or rate of change in piston velocity, is the limiting factor.

In contrast to the rear-engined [[Rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|RR layout]], the [[center of mass]] of the [[engine]] is in front of the rear axle. This layout is typically chosen for its low [[moment of inertia]] and relatively favorable [[weight distribution]] (the heaviest component is within the wheelbase, making the main component of its [[moment of inertia]] relatively low). The layout has a tendency toward being heavier in the rear than the front, which allows for best balance to be achieved under braking. However, since there is little weight over the front wheels, under acceleration, the front of the car is prone to lift and cause [[Understeer and oversteer|understeer]]. Most rear-engine layouts have historically been used in smaller vehicles, because the weight of the engine at the rear has an adverse effect on a larger car's handling, making it 'tail-heavy'.<ref name=\"enginebook\">{{cite book|last=Hillier|first=Victor|author2=Peter Coombes |title=Fundamentals of motor vehicle technology|publisher=Nelson Thornes|year=2004|pages=9|isbn=978-0-7487-8082-2}}</ref> It is felt that the low polar inertia is crucial in selection of this layout. The mid-engined layout also uses up central space, making it impractical for any but two-seater sports cars. However, some microvans use this layout, with a small, low engine beneath the loading area. This makes it possible to move the driver right to the front of the vehicle, thus increasing the loading area at the expense of slightly reduced load depth.\n\nIn modern racing cars, RMR is the usual configuration and is usually synonymous with \"mid engine\". Due to its [[weight distribution]] and resulting favorable [[vehicle dynamics]], this layout is heavily employed in open-wheel [[Formula racing]] cars (such as [[Formula One]] and [[IndyCar]]) as well as purpose-built [[Sports car racing|sports racing cars]]. This configuration was also common in very small engined 1950s [[microcar]]s, in which the engines did not take up much space. Because of successes in racing, the RMR platform has been popular for road-going sports cars despite the inherent challenges of design, maintenance and lack of cargo space. The similar [[Mid-engine, four-wheel-drive layout|mid-engine, four-wheel-drive]] layout gives many of the same advantages and is used when extra traction is desired, such as in some [[supercars]] and in the [[Group B]] rally cars.\n\n==History==\nThe 1900 [[NW Rennzweier]] was one of the first race cars with mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. Other known historical examples include the [[Karl Benz#Benz S\u00f6hne (1906\u20131923)|1923 Benz Tropfenwagen]]. It was based on an earlier design named the Rumpler Tropfenwagen in 1921 made by Edmund von [[Rumpler]], an Austrian engineer working at Daimler. The Benz Tropfenwagen was designed by [[Ferdinand Porsche]] along with Willy Walb and Hans Nibel. It raced in 1923 and 1924 and was most successful in the [[Italian Grand Prix]] in [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]] where it stood fourth.  Later, Ferdinand Porsche used mid-engine design concept towards the [[Auto Union#The Auto Union racing cars|Auto Union]] [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] cars of the 1930s which became the first winning RMR racers.  They were decades before their time, although MR Miller Specials raced a few times at [[Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis]] between 1939 and 1947. In 1953 [[Porsche]] premiered the tiny and altogether new RMR [[Porsche 550|550 Spyder]] and in a year it was notoriously winning in the smaller sports and endurance race car classes against much larger cars{{snd}} a sign of greater things to come. The [[Porsche 718|718]] followed similarly in 1958. But it was not until the late 1950s that [[History of Formula One#The mid engine revolution|RMR reappeared in Grand Prix]] (today's \"[[Formula One]]\") races in the form of the [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]]-[[Coventry Climax|Climax]] (1957), soon followed by cars from [[BRM]] and [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]]. [[Ferrari]] and [[Porsche]] soon made Grand Prix RMR attempts with less initial success. The mid-engined layout was brought back to [[Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis]] in 1961 by the [[Cooper Car Company]] with [[Jack Brabham]] running as high as third and finishing ninth. Cooper did not return, but from 1963 on British built mid-engined cars from constructors like [[Brabham]], [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] and [[Lola Cars|Lola]] competed regularly and in 1965 Lotus won Indy with their [[Lotus 38|Type 38]].\n\nRear mid-engines were widely used in microcars like the [[Isetta]] or the [[Z\u00fcndapp Janus]].\n\nThe first rear mid-engined road car after WW II was the 1962 (Rene) Bonnet / [[Matra Djet]], which used the 1108cc Renault Sierra engine, mated to the transaxle from the FWD Renault Estafette van. Nearly 1700 were built until 1967. This was followed by the first De Tomaso, the [[De Tomaso Vallelunga|Vallelunga]], which mated a tuned Ford Cortina 1500 Kent engine to a VW transaxle with Hewland gearsets. Introduced at Turin in 1963, 58 were built 1964\u201368. A similar car was the Renault-engined [[Lotus Europa]], built from 1966\u20131975.\n\nFinally, in 1966, the [[Lamborghini Miura]] was the first high performance mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive roadcar.\nThe concept behind the Miura was that of putting on the road a grand tourer featuring state-of-the-art racing-car technology of the time; hence the Miura was powered by a [[V12 engine|V12]] transversely mounted between the rear wheels, solidal to the [[gearbox]] and [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]].<ref name=\"lamborghini.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lamborghini.com/en/heritage/history/1965-1966|title=History|work=Official Lamborghini website|accessdate=2012-12-04|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220084111/http://www.lamborghini.com/en/heritage/history/1965-1966|archivedate=2012-12-20}}</ref> This represented an extremely innovative sportscar at a time when all of its competitors (aside from the rear-engined Porsches), from [[Ferrari]]s to [[Aston Martin]]s, were traditional [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|front-engined, rear wheel drive]] grand tourers.\n\nThe [[Pontiac Fiero]] was a [[Mid-engine design|mid-engined]] [[sports car]] that was built by the [[Pontiac]] division of [[General Motors]] from 1984 to 1988.

{"title_page": "Gas core reactor rocket", "text_new": "{{no footnotes|date=February 2013}}\n'''Gas core reactor rockets''' are a conceptual type of rocket that is propelled by the exhausted coolant of a [[gaseous fission reactor]].  The nuclear fission reactor core may be either a [[gas]] or [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. They may be capable of creating [[specific impulse]]s of 3,000\u20135,000&nbsp;s (30 to 50&nbsp;kN\u00b7s/kg, effective exhaust velocities 30 to 50&nbsp;km/s) and [[thrust]] which is enough for relatively fast [[interplanetary spaceflight|interplanetary]] travel. [[Heat transfer]] to the [[working fluid]] ([[propellant]]) is by [[thermal radiation]], mostly in the [[ultraviolet]], given off by the [[Nuclear fission|fission]] gas at a working temperature of around 25,000&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\n==Theory of operation==\nNuclear gas-core-reactor rockets can provide much higher specific impulse than solid core nuclear rockets because their temperature limitations are in the [[nozzle]] and core wall structural temperatures, which are distanced from the hottest regions of the gas core.  Consequently, nuclear gas core reactors can provide much higher temperatures to the [[propellant]].  Solid core nuclear thermal rockets can develop higher specific impulse than conventional chemical rockets due to the low molecular weight of a hydrogen propellant, but their [[operating temperature]]s are limited by the maximum temperature of the solid core because the reactor's temperatures cannot rise above its components' lowest [[melting]] temperature.\n\nDue to the much higher temperatures achievable by the gaseous core design, it can deliver higher specific impulse and thrust than most other conventional nuclear designs.  This translates into shorter mission transit times for future astronauts or larger payload fractions.  It may also be possible to use partially ionized plasma from the gas core to generate electricity [[magnetohydrodynamic]]ally, subsequently negating the need for an additional power supply.\n\n==General features of the nuclear reactor==\nAll gas-core reactor rocket designs share several properties in their nuclear reactor cores, and most designs share the same materials.  The closest terrestrial design concept is the [[gaseous fission reactor]].\n\n===Nuclear fuel===\nThe [[fissile]] fuel is usually highly [[enriched uranium]] pellets or a uranium containing gas ([[Uranium-235|U-235]] or [[Uranium-233|U-233]]).  Sometimes uranium tetrafluoride is required due to its chemical stability; the propellant is usually [[hydrogen]].\n\n===Neutron Moderator===\nMost gas core reactors are surrounded by a [[wikt:radial|radial]] first wall capable of taking the brunt of the extreme environment present inside the core, a pressure shell to hold everything together, and a radial [[neutron moderator]] usually made up of [[beryllium oxide]].  The propellant also provides moderation.\n\n===Reactor coolant / Rocket propellant===\nThe hydrogen propellant cools the reactor and its various structural parts.  Hydrogen is first pumped through the nozzle, then through the walls and back down through the core region.  Once it passes through the core region, the hydrogen is exhausted.  If cooling from the propellant is not enough, external [[radiators]] are required.  The internal gas core temperatures in most designs vary, but the designs with the highest specific impulses generally have fissioning gas plasmas heating a low mass propellant.  This heating occurs primarily through radiation.\n\n===Heat transfer===\nAt high temperatures, heat is transferred predominantly by [[thermal radiation]] (rather than [[thermal conduction]]).  However, the hydrogen gas used as propellant is almost completely transparent to this radiation.  Therefore, in most gas core reactor rocket concepts, some sort of ''seeding'' of the propellant by opaque solid or liquid particles is considered necessary.  Particles of carbon [soot] (which is highly opaque and remains solid up to 3915&nbsp;K, its sublimation point) would seem to be a natural choice; however, carbon is chemically unstable in a hydrogen-rich environment at high temperatures and pressures.  Thus, rather than carbon, dust particles or liquid droplets of a material such as tungsten (melting point 3695&nbsp;K, boiling point 6203&nbsp;K) or [[tantalum hafnium carbide]] (melting point 4263&nbsp;K, boiling point some unknown higher temperature) are preferred.  These particles would make up up to 4% of the mass of the exhaust gas, which would considerably increase the cost of propellant and slightly lower the rocket's specific impulse.\n\nAt the temperatures necessary to reach a specific impulse of 5000-7000 s, however, no solid or liquid material would survive (the required reactor temperature would be at least 50,000\u2013100,000&nbsp;K), and the propellant would become transparent; as a result, most of the heat would be absorbed by the chamber walls.  This would preclude the use of a nuclear thermal rocket with this high of a specific impulse, unless some other means of seeding or heat transfer to the propellant is found.\n\n===Control===\nControl can be accomplished by either changing the relative or overall densities of the fissile fuel and the propellant or by having outside control drives moving [[neutron]] absorbing drums or the radial moderator.\n\n==Open cycle versus closed cycle==\nThere are two main variations of the gas core reactor rocket: '''open cycle''' designs, which do not contain the fuel within a vessel, and '''closed cycle''' designs, which contain the gas reaction core within a solid structure.\n\n===Open cycle designs===\n[[File:Gas Core open cycle.png|thumb|300px|Diagram of an open cycle gas core reactor rocket.]]\nThe disadvantage of the open cycle is that the fuel can escape with the working fluid through the nozzle before it reaches significant burn-up levels.  Thus, finding a way to limit the loss of fuel is required for open-cycle designs.  Unless an outside force is relied upon (i.e. magnetic forces, rocket acceleration), the only way to limit fuel-propellant mixing, is through flow [[hydrodynamics]].  Another problem is that the radioactive efflux from the nozzle makes the design totally unsuitable for operation within Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe advantage of the open cycle design is that it can attain much higher operating temperatures than the closed cycle design, and does not require the exotic materials needed for a suitable closed cycle design.\n\n====Flow hydrodynamics in open cycle designs====\nThe shape of the fissile gas core can be either [[cylindrical]], [[toroid]]al, or [[counter flow toroidal]].  Since there are issues regarding the loss of fissile fuel with the cylindrical and toroidal designs, the counter-flow toroidal gas core geometry is the primary source of research.  The counter flow toroid is the most promising because it has the best stability and theoretically prevents mixing of the fissile fuel and propellant more effectively than the aforementioned concepts.  In this design, the fissile fuel is kept mostly in a base injection stabilized recirculation bubble by hydrodynamic confinement.  Most designs utilize a cylindrical gas core wall for ease of modeling.  However, previous cold flow tests have shown that hydrodynamic containment is more easily achieved with a spherical internal wall geometry design.\n\nThe formation of the fuel [[vortex]] is complex.  It basically comes down to flow over a projectile shape with a blunt base.  The vortex is formed by placing a semi-porous wall in front of the desired location of the fuel vortex but leaves room along its sides for hydrogen propellant.  Propellant is then pumped inside the reactor cavity along an annular inlet region. A dead space then develops behind the semi-porous wall; due to [[viscous]] and [[Shear stress|shear]] forces, a counter toroidal rotation develops.   Once the vortex develops, fissile fuel can be injected through the semi-porous plate to bring the reactor critical.  The formation and location of the fuel vortex now depends on the amount of fissile fuel that bleeds into the system through the semi-porous wall.  When more fuel bleeds into the system through the wall, the vortex moves farther downstream.  When less bleeds through, the vortex moves farther upstream.  Of course, the upstream location is constrained by the placement of the semi-[[porous]] wall.\n\n===Closed cycle designs===\n[[File:Gas Core light bulb.png|thumb|300px|Diagram of a \"[[nuclear lightbulb]]\"\u2013style closed cycle gas core reactor rocket.]]\nThe closed cycle is advantageous because its design virtually eliminates loss of fuel, but the necessity of a physical wall between the fuel and the propellant leads to the obstacle of finding a material with extremely optimized characteristics.  One must find a medium that is transparent to a wide range of gamma energies, but can withstand the [[radiation]] environment present in the reactor, specifically particle bombardment from the nearby fission reactions.  This barrage of particles can lead to [[sputtering]] and eventual wall erosion.\n\nOne closed cycle gas core rocket design (often called the ''[[nuclear lightbulb]]'') contains the fissioning gas in a [[quartz]] enclosure that is separate from the propellant.  First, the hydrogen coolant runs through the nozzle and inside the walls of the quartz enclosure for cooling.  Next, the coolant is run along the outside of the quartz fuel enclosure.  Since the fissile gas would be directly in contact with the walls, the operating temperature is not as great as other designs because the walls would eventually [[ablate]] away.\n\n==Magnetic confinement==\nBarring an external force, hydrodynamic containment is the only way to increase the residence time of the fuel in the reactor.  However, one may ask why bar an outside force, could not magnetic confinement be used since the fuel would be highly [[ionized]] (three or four times ionized) while the propellant is only partially ionized?  To answer this question one must understand a little about magnetic plasma confinement.  The key parameter of interest for magnetic confinement is the ratio of [[kinetic pressure]] to [[magnetic pressure]], \u03b2.\n\nWhen \u03b2<1 magnetic confinement is possible (most [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] schemes have a \u03b2 close to 0.05).  However, the pressures in a gas core rocket are much higher than pressures in fusion devices, approximately 1000 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]] (100 [[megapascal|MPa]]). For these pressures, the necessary magnetic field strength required is close to 16 [[tesla (unit)|tesla]]s just to produce \u03b2=1.  For a magnetic field of this [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]], [[superconducting]] technology is necessary and the added mass of such a system would be detrimental.  Also, even with a \u03b2<1, resistive diffusion will cause the fuel core to collapse almost immediately unless \u03b2<<1, which would require an even larger magnetic field.\n\nHowever, because the propellant and fuel can be at the same pressure, a magnetic field could retain the fuel merely by impeding convective mixing with the propellant, and would play no role in maintaining pressure in the reactor chamber: The pressure of the fuel is not relevant to a calculation of \u03b2. Because the situation is entirely unlike that of the confinement of a fusion plasma in vacuum, the required strength of a magnetic field for fission fuel retention must be estimated based on magnetohydrodynamic considerations (in particular, the suppression of turbulent mixing).\n\n==Impact of rocket acceleration==\nAnother important aspect to GCRs is the impact of the rocket acceleration on the containment of the fuel in the fuel bubble.  A rocket acceleration of only 0.001 ''g'' (10&nbsp;mm/s\u00b2) will cause [[buoyancy]] effects to decrease core containment by 35% if all other flow-rates are held constant from a zero g startup.  Ultimately, the fuel-propellant flows will have to be throttled until the rocket approaches some sort of steady state.\n\n==Neutronic considerations==\nSince steep temperature gradients will be present in any such gas core reactor, several implications for neutronics must be considered.  The open-cycle gas-core reactor (OCGCR) is typically a thermal/epithermal reactor.  Most types of OCGCR require external moderation due to the steep temperature gradients inside the gaseous core.  Neutrons born in the fuel region travel relatively unimpeded to the external moderator where some are thermalized and sent back into the gas core.  Due to the high core temperatures, however, on the return trip the neutrons are up scattered in the fuel region, which leads to a significant negative reactor worth.   To achieve criticality, this reactor is operated at very high pressure and the exterior radial wall is made up of a moderator of some sort, generally beryllium oxide.  Moderation can also come from introducing moderating particles into either the fuel or propellant streams, but by doing so, the benefits in neutronics is canceled by loss of rocket performance.\n\n==Technology summary and outlook==\nThe open-cycle gas-core rocket has many unique design attributes that make it a serious challenger to other proposed propulsion for interplanetary missions.  Due to the necessity of having a [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] wall inside the reactor for a closed cycle concept, the benefit of moving to a gas core from a solid core are nearly negated.  The high specific impulse and large thrust possible for the OCGCR correspond to shorter mission times and higher payload fractions.  However, the technical challenges and unknowns inherent in its design are many.  Additionally, any test of the system performed on earth would be under a gravity field of 1 ''g'', which would bring buoyancy effects into play inside the gaseous core.\n\nDue to the inability to perform live testing on earth, research is focused primarily on computational modeling of such a system.  It was previously mentioned that the specific impulse could be as high as or higher than 3000 s.  However, results of computational modeling point towards this number being somewhat optimistic.  When thermal hydraulics were modeled more completely for a typical base injection stabilized recirculation bubble gas core rocket by D. Poston, the specific impulse dropped from >3000 s to <1500 s.  In the base injection stabilized recirculation bubble gas core rocket concept, it is thought that some additional method of fuel confinement will be beneficial.  As mentioned earlier, relying completely on magnetic containment of the fuel bubble is not yet practical. However, a magnetic field may be able to assist in containment or help suppress turbulence that would lead to fuel-propellant mixing.\n\nThe primary areas of future research for such an OCGCR would therefore be centered on keeping the fuel and propellant from mixing as much as possible.  Although this article has focused on enriched uranium for the fuel and hydrogen for the propellant, this may not be the optimal choice for either.  Other fuels, such as plutonium, and other propellants, including helium or even helium-3, have also been considered and in certain situations provide advantages.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Gaseous fission reactor]]\n* [[Spacecraft propulsion]]\n* [[Nuclear lightbulb]]\n* [[Nuclear material]]\n* [[Atomic physics]]\n* [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]]\n* [[Nuclear pulse propulsion]]\n* [[Discovery One]]\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n*Thode, L., Cline, M., Howe, S.

They may be capable of creating [[specific impulse]]s of 3,000\u20135,000&nbsp;s (30 to 50&nbsp;kN\u00b7s/kg, effective exhaust velocities 30 to 50&nbsp;km/s) and [[thrust]] which is enough for relatively fast [[interplanetary spaceflight|interplanetary]] travel. [[Heat transfer]] to the [[working fluid]] ([[propellant]]) is by [[thermal radiation]], mostly in the [[ultraviolet]], given off by the [[Nuclear fission|fission]] gas at a working temperature of around 25,000&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\n==Theory of operation==\nNuclear gas-core-reactor rockets can provide much higher specific impulse than solid core nuclear rockets because their temperature limitations are in the [[nozzle]] and core wall structural temperatures, which are distanced from the hottest regions of the gas core.  Consequently, nuclear gas core reactors can provide much higher temperatures to the [[propellant]].  Solid core nuclear thermal rockets can develop higher specific impulse than conventional chemical rockets due to the low molecular weight of a hydrogen propellant, but their [[operating temperature]]s are limited by the maximum temperature of the solid core because the reactor's temperatures cannot rise above its components' lowest [[melting]] temperature.\n\nDue to the much higher temperatures achievable by the gaseous core design, it can deliver higher specific impulse and thrust than most other conventional nuclear designs.  This translates into shorter mission transit times for future astronauts or larger payload fractions.  It may also be possible to use partially ionized plasma from the gas core to generate electricity [[magnetohydrodynamic]]ally, subsequently negating the need for an additional power supply.\n\n==General features of the nuclear reactor==\nAll gas-core reactor rocket designs share several properties in their nuclear reactor cores, and most designs share the same materials.  The closest terrestrial design concept is the [[gaseous fission reactor]].\n\n===Nuclear fuel===\nThe [[fissile]] fuel is usually highly [[enriched uranium]] pellets or a uranium containing gas ([[Uranium-235|U-235]] or [[Uranium-233|U-233]]).  Sometimes uranium tetrafluoride is required due to its chemical stability; the propellant is usually [[hydrogen]].\n\n===Neutron Moderator===\nMost gas core reactors are surrounded by a [[wikt:radial|radial]] first wall capable of taking the brunt of the extreme environment present inside the core, a pressure shell to hold everything together, and a radial [[neutron moderator]] usually made up of [[beryllium oxide]].  The propellant also provides moderation.\n\n===Reactor coolant / Rocket propellant===\nThe hydrogen propellant cools the reactor and its various structural parts.  Hydrogen is first pumped through the nozzle, then through the walls and back down through the core region.  Once it passes through the core region, the hydrogen is exhausted.  If cooling from the propellant is not enough, external [[radiators]] are required.  The internal gas core temperatures in most designs vary, but the designs with the highest specific impulses generally have fissioning gas plasmas heating a low mass propellant.  This heating occurs primarily through radiation.\n\n===Heat transfer===\nAt high temperatures, heat is transferred predominantly by [[thermal radiation]] (rather than [[thermal conduction]]).  However, the hydrogen gas used as propellant is almost completely transparent to this radiation.  Therefore, in most gas core reactor rocket concepts, some sort of ''seeding'' of the propellant by opaque solid or liquid particles is considered necessary.  Particles of carbon [soot] (which is highly opaque and remains solid up to 3915&nbsp;K, its sublimation point) would seem to be a natural choice; however, carbon is chemically unstable in a hydrogen-rich environment at high temperatures and pressures.  Thus, rather than carbon, dust particles or liquid droplets of a material such as tungsten (melting point 3695&nbsp;K, boiling point 6203&nbsp;K) or [[tantalum hafnium carbide]] (melting point 4263&nbsp;K, boiling point some unknown higher temperature) are preferred.  These particles would make up up to 4% of the mass of the exhaust gas, which would considerably increase the cost of propellant and slightly lower the rocket's specific impulse.\n\nAt the temperatures necessary to reach a specific impulse of 5000-7000 s, however, no solid or liquid material would survive (the required reactor temperature would be at least 50,000\u2013100,000&nbsp;K), and the propellant would become transparent; as a result, most of the heat would be absorbed by the chamber walls.  This would preclude the use of a nuclear thermal rocket with this high of a specific impulse, unless some other means of seeding or heat transfer to the propellant is found.\n\n===Control===\nControl can be accomplished by either changing the relative or overall densities of the fissile fuel and the propellant or by having outside control drives moving [[neutron]] absorbing drums or the radial moderator.\n\n==Open cycle versus closed cycle==\nThere are two main variations of the gas core reactor rocket: '''open cycle''' designs, which do not contain the fuel within a vessel, and '''closed cycle''' designs, which contain the gas reaction core within a solid structure.\n\n===Open cycle designs===\n[[File:Gas Core open cycle.png|thumb|300px|Diagram of an open cycle gas core reactor rocket.]]\nThe disadvantage of the open cycle is that the fuel can escape with the working fluid through the nozzle before it reaches significant burn-up levels.  Thus, finding a way to limit the loss of fuel is required for open-cycle designs.  Unless an outside force is relied upon (i.e. magnetic forces, rocket acceleration), the only way to limit fuel-propellant mixing, is through flow [[hydrodynamics]].  Another problem is that the radioactive efflux from the nozzle makes the design totally unsuitable for operation within Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe advantage of the open cycle design is that it can attain much higher operating temperatures than the closed cycle design, and does not require the exotic materials needed for a suitable closed cycle design.\n\n====Flow hydrodynamics in open cycle designs====\nThe shape of the fissile gas core can be either [[cylindrical]], [[toroid]]al, or [[counter flow toroidal]].  Since there are issues regarding the loss of fissile fuel with the cylindrical and toroidal designs, the counter-flow toroidal gas core geometry is the primary source of research.  The counter flow toroid is the most promising because it has the best stability and theoretically prevents mixing of the fissile fuel and propellant more effectively than the aforementioned concepts.  In this design, the fissile fuel is kept mostly in a base injection stabilized recirculation bubble by hydrodynamic confinement.  Most designs utilize a cylindrical gas core wall for ease of modeling.  However, previous cold flow tests have shown that hydrodynamic containment is more easily achieved with a spherical internal wall geometry design.\n\nThe formation of the fuel [[vortex]] is complex.  It basically comes down to flow over a projectile shape with a blunt base.  The vortex is formed by placing a semi-porous wall in front of the desired location of the fuel vortex but leaves room along its sides for hydrogen propellant.  Propellant is then pumped inside the reactor cavity along an annular inlet region. A dead space then develops behind the semi-porous wall; due to [[viscous]] and [[Shear stress|shear]] forces, a counter toroidal rotation develops.   Once the vortex develops, fissile fuel can be injected through the semi-porous plate to bring the reactor critical.  The formation and location of the fuel vortex now depends on the amount of fissile fuel that bleeds into the system through the semi-porous wall.  When more fuel bleeds into the system through the wall, the vortex moves farther downstream.  When less bleeds through, the vortex moves farther upstream.  Of course, the upstream location is constrained by the placement of the semi-[[porous]] wall.\n\n===Closed cycle designs===\n[[File:Gas Core light bulb.png|thumb|300px|Diagram of a \"[[nuclear lightbulb]]\"\u2013style closed cycle gas core reactor rocket.]]\nThe closed cycle is advantageous because its design virtually eliminates loss of fuel, but the necessity of a physical wall between the fuel and the propellant leads to the obstacle of finding a material with extremely optimized characteristics.  One must find a medium that is transparent to a wide range of gamma energies, but can withstand the [[radiation]] environment present in the reactor, specifically particle bombardment from the nearby fission reactions.  This barrage of particles can lead to [[sputtering]] and eventual wall erosion.\n\nOne closed cycle gas core rocket design (often called the ''[[nuclear lightbulb]]'') contains the fissioning gas in a [[quartz]] enclosure that is separate from the propellant.  First, the hydrogen coolant runs through the nozzle and inside the walls of the quartz enclosure for cooling.  Next, the coolant is run along the outside of the quartz fuel enclosure.  Since the fissile gas would be directly in contact with the walls, the operating temperature is not as great as other designs because the walls would eventually [[ablate]] away.\n\n==Magnetic confinement==\nBarring an external force, hydrodynamic containment is the only way to increase the residence time of the fuel in the reactor.  However, one may ask why bar an outside force, could not magnetic confinement be used since the fuel would be highly [[ionized]] (three or four times ionized) while the propellant is only partially ionized?  To answer this question one must understand a little about magnetic plasma confinement.  The key parameter of interest for magnetic confinement is the ratio of [[kinetic pressure]] to [[magnetic pressure]], \u03b2.\n\nWhen \u03b2<1 magnetic confinement is possible (most [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] schemes have a \u03b2 close to 0.05).  However, the pressures in a gas core rocket are much higher than pressures in fusion devices, approximately 1000 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]] (100 [[megapascal|MPa]]). For these pressures, the necessary magnetic field strength required is close to 16 [[tesla (unit)|tesla]]s just to produce \u03b2=1.  For a magnetic field of this [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]], [[superconducting]] technology is necessary and the added mass of such a system would be detrimental.  Also, even with a \u03b2<1, resistive diffusion will cause the fuel core to collapse almost immediately unless \u03b2<<1, which would require an even larger magnetic field.\n\nHowever, because the propellant and fuel can be at the same pressure, a magnetic field could retain the fuel merely by impeding convective mixing with the propellant, and would play no role in maintaining pressure in the reactor chamber: The pressure of the fuel is not relevant to a calculation of \u03b2. Because the situation is entirely unlike that of the confinement of a fusion plasma in vacuum, the required strength of a magnetic field for fission fuel retention must be estimated based on magnetohydrodynamic considerations (in particular, the suppression of turbulent mixing).\n\n==Impact of rocket acceleration==\nAnother important aspect to GCRs is the impact of the rocket acceleration on the containment of the fuel in the fuel bubble.  A rocket acceleration of only 0.001 ''g'' (10&nbsp;mm/s\u00b2) will cause [[buoyancy]] effects to decrease core containment by 35% if all other flow-rates are held constant from a zero g startup.  Ultimately, the fuel-propellant flows will have to be throttled until the rocket approaches some sort of steady state.\n\n==Neutronic considerations==\nSince steep temperature gradients will be present in any such gas core reactor, several implications for neutronics must be considered.  The open-cycle gas-core reactor (OCGCR) is typically a thermal/epithermal reactor.  Most types of OCGCR require external moderation due to the steep temperature gradients inside the gaseous core.  Neutrons born in the fuel region travel relatively unimpeded to the external moderator where some are thermalized and sent back into the gas core.  Due to the high core temperatures, however, on the return trip the neutrons are up scattered in the fuel region, which leads to a significant negative reactor worth.   To achieve criticality, this reactor is operated at very high pressure and the exterior radial wall is made up of a moderator of some sort, generally beryllium oxide.  Moderation can also come from introducing moderating particles into either the fuel or propellant streams, but by doing so, the benefits in neutronics is canceled by loss of rocket performance.\n\n==Technology summary and outlook==\nThe open-cycle gas-core rocket has many unique design attributes that make it a serious challenger to other proposed propulsion for interplanetary missions.  Due to the necessity of having a [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] wall inside the reactor for a closed cycle concept, the benefit of moving to a gas core from a solid core are nearly negated.  The high specific impulse and large thrust possible for the OCGCR correspond to shorter mission times and higher payload fractions.  However, the technical challenges and unknowns inherent in its design are many.  Additionally, any test of the system performed on earth would be under a gravity field of 1 ''g'', which would bring buoyancy effects into play inside the gaseous core.\n\nDue to the inability to perform live testing on earth, research is focused primarily on computational modeling of such a system.  It was previously mentioned that the specific impulse could be as high as or higher than 3000 s.  However, results of computational modeling point towards this number being somewhat optimistic.  When thermal hydraulics were modeled more completely for a typical base injection stabilized recirculation bubble gas core rocket by D. Poston, the specific impulse dropped from >3000 s to <1500 s.  In the base injection stabilized recirculation bubble gas core rocket concept, it is thought that some additional method of fuel confinement will be beneficial.  As mentioned earlier, relying completely on magnetic containment of the fuel bubble is not yet practical. However, a magnetic field may be able to assist in containment or help suppress turbulence that would lead to fuel-propellant mixing.\n\nThe primary areas of future research for such an OCGCR would therefore be centered on keeping the fuel and propellant from mixing as much as possible.  Although this article has focused on enriched uranium for the fuel and hydrogen for the propellant, this may not be the optimal choice for either.  Other fuels, such as plutonium, and other propellants, including helium or even helium-3, have also been considered and in certain situations provide advantages.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Gaseous fission reactor]]\n* [[Spacecraft propulsion]]\n* [[Nuclear lightbulb]]\n* [[Nuclear material]]\n* [[Atomic physics]]\n* [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]]\n* [[Nuclear pulse propulsion]]\n* [[Discovery One]]\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n*Thode, L., Cline, M., Howe, S.

The United States District Court for the District of Columbia entered the Consent Order on September 30, 2014. The consent order addressed SunTrust's alleged misconduct regarding its mortgage servicing and foreclosure practices. SunTrust was also required to create a 40 million dollar fund for the approximately 45,000 SunTrust borrowers who were foreclosed upon between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2013. In addition, SunTrust was required to adhere to significant new homeowner protections.

A lower level system known as '''RAVE''' (Rendering Acceleration Virtual Engine) provided a [[hardware abstraction layer]] with functionality similar to [[Direct3D]] or cut-down versions of [[OpenGL]] like [[MiniGL]]. On top of this was an object-oriented [[scene graph]] system, QD3D proper, which handled model loading and manipulation at a level similar to [[OpenGL++]].<ref>http://legacy.macnn.com/thereview/features/covert/covert10.2.shtml</ref> The system also supplied a number of high-level utilities for file format conversion, and a standard viewer application for the Mac OS.\n\nQD3D had little impact in the computer market, both as a result of Apple's beleaguered position in the mid-1990s, as well as several fateful decisions made by the design team about future changes in the 3D hardware market that did not come true. Apple abandoned work on QD3D after [[Steve Jobs]] took over in 1998, and announced that future 3D support on Mac OS would be based on [[OpenGL]].\n\n==OpenGL in the 1990s==\nThe canonical 3D API of the 1990s was OpenGL. This had been written by [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]] and initially closely matched the capabilities of their [[workstation]] systems, operating as a hardware abstraction layer. The OpenGL API consisted mostly of state-setting instructions for setting up drawing modes like the paint color or camera position, and system for sending geometry into the system, normally as meshes of triangles. The combination of these instructions was saved into a [[display list]] which was then rendered to produce the output.\n\nOpenGL lacked many features that are needed to produce a complete 3D program. Saving and loading geometry data, collecting that data into groups to produce model objects, and the control of state was all left to the programmer. This was considered to be an advantage in an era when performance was limited and direct control over these sorts of functions was a route to improved performance.\n\nHowever, this lack of high-level functionality did make it more difficult to quickly write simple programs, as well as leading to a lack of interoperability. A number of efforts started to provide standardized higher level APIs, like OpenGL++ and (later) [[Fahrenheit (graphics API)|Fahrenheit]], which handled many of the more common bookkeeping tasks like loading geometry from files and providing a display. These standardized [[scene graph]] systems meant the programmer only had to provide the GUI for the program.\n\nWhile OpenGL is mostly low-level, it did include some higher-level concepts that were only really used on SGI systems. This led to another series of APIs that removed these features to make it easier to implement on common hardware. The best known of these is [[MiniGL]], which is not a separate API, but simply a list of those functions in OpenGL that are guaranteed to be supported across all hardware, thus ensuring that a program limiting itself to those calls will run with maximum performance.\n\n==QD3D==\nQD3D was designed from the start to operate on computers with considerably less power than workstations. This led to a concerted effort to cleanly separate the upper and lower layers of the API, with the lower-level RAVE system being closer to MiniGL from the start. This had the advantage of providing a clean and minimal API that could be more easily ported to different hardware.\n\nSince only RAVE needed to be ported, the upper layer APIs could be made as complex as desired, and the QD3D system included a complete scene graph, a standardized model file format, 3DMF, and even basic GUI objects that utilized them. To write a simple application in QD3D, the programmer only had to include a few libraries and then place the GUI elements in their program using [[ResEdit]] or similar tools.\n\nAdditional functionality included a \"plug-in\" rendering system, which allowed an application to render a scene in a variety of styles. Without changing the model or their code, developers could render the same scene interactively or (with suitable plug-ins) using methods such as ray-tracing or phong shading.\n\nThe QD3D API was an object-like system based on pure-[[C (programming language)|C]] code. The various structures were carefully constructed to contain pointers to other important objects. Objects knew all the drawing state they needed, thereby eliminating code that would normally be needed when developing under OpenGL.\n\nOn the downside, QD3D's layering introduced performance issues. For instance, the system stored and automatically set state for every object before drawing. This made development much easier, but also made the performance drop in a way the developer had no direct control over. Those applications demanding performance over ease of programming could instead choose to use the RAVE layer directly.\n\nAnother area of concern is that the scene graph was hidden from view, and considerable improvements in rendering performance can be made by carefully \"culling\" the graph to remove those objects that are not in view. Although later releases of QD3D gained the ability to automatically perform visibility culling (based on the grouping of objects in the scene graph), OpenGL's lack of support for this feature typically forced developers to implement it from the start.\n\n==Switch to OpenGL==\nGood low-level 3D performance relies not only on the programmer to provide efficient models, but high-quality drivers for the hardware as well. Although RAVE was designed to be cross-platform, only hardware developers which supported Mac ([[ATI Technologies|ATI]], [[NVIDIA]], and [[3dfx]]) produced drivers for it. This left any comparison between QD3D and alternative APIs one-sided, as outside of the Mac QD3D was forced to fall back to a software RAVE implementation.\n\nAs OpenGL gained traction on Windows (often credited to [[id Software]], who championed the API over D3D), hardware developers were increasingly designing future hardware against the future feature set planned for Microsoft's D3D. Through its extension mechanism OpenGL was able to track these changes relatively easily, while RAVE's feature set remained relatively fixed.\n\nAt the [[Macworld Expo]] in January 1999, Apple announced that neither QuickDraw 3D nor RAVE would be included in [[Mac OS X]]. The company laid off the development staff in June 1999{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}, replacing the in-house technology with OpenGL after buying a Mac implementation and key staff from [[Conix Enterprises]].\n\nAfter Apple withdrew support for QD3D, an [[open source]] implementation of the QD3D API was developed externally. Known as ''Quesa'', this implementation combines QD3D's higher level concepts with an OpenGL renderer.

Royal Jordanian is a member of the [[Arab Air Carriers Organization]] and the [[Oneworld]] [[airline alliance]]. The airline operates over 500 flights per week, with at least 110 daily departures and was formerly known as '''Alia''' '''Royal Jordanian Airlines'''.\n\n== History ==\n=== 1960s to 1990s ===\n[[File:Boeing 707-3D3C JY-ADO Alia LHR 22.08.71 edited-2.jpg|thumb|right|Alia [[Boeing 707]]-300 at [[London Heathrow Airport]] in 1971. This aircraft was later destroyed in the [[Kano air disaster]].]]\nThe airline was established on 9 December 1963 and started operations on 15 December 1963 after a royal decree by the late [[King Hussein]]. It was named ''Alia'' (or ''Aalya'') after King Hussein's eldest child, [[Princess Alia bint Hussein|Princess Alia bint Al Hussein]] of Jordan (born on 13 February 1956). It is a common misconception that the airline was named after the King's third wife, [[Alia al-Hussein|Queen Alia]] whom King Hussein did not marry until 1972. The airline was founded with capital from private shareholders but the [[Politics of Jordan|Jordanian government]] later took over the company.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://trofamspotting.weebly.com/royal-jordanian-airlines.html |title=Royal Jordanian Airlines |website=Trofam Spotting |access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref>\n\nAlia (the Royal Jordanian Airline) started operations with two [[Handley Page Dart Herald]]s and a [[Douglas DC-7]] aircraft, serving [[Kuwait City]], [[Beirut]] and [[Cairo]] from Amman. In 1964, another DC-7 was added and service began to [[Jeddah]]. In 1965, Alia initiated service to [[Rome]], its first destination in [[Europe]]. The progress made by the airline was threatened by an [[Israel]]i air raid during the 1967 [[Six-Day War]] when the DC-7 aircraft were destroyed. They were replaced by two [[Fokker F27 Friendship]] airliners.\n\nIn 1968, the airline expanded its route pattern to [[Nicosia]], [[Benghazi]], [[Dhahran]] and [[Doha]]. 1969 saw the addition of service to [[Munich]], [[Istanbul]] and [[Tehran]].\n[[File:Royal Jordanian Airlines L-1011 in Geneva.jpg|thumb|[[Lockheed L-1011]] TriStar of Alia in the short-lived, experimental early-1980s livery]]\n\nIn 1970, Alia joined the jet age when they phased out the F27s and ordered [[Boeing 707]] aircraft. Frankfurt and Abu Dhabi were added to the network. The 707s were delivered in 1971. In that year, service was initiated to Madrid, Copenhagen and Karachi. During the rest of the decade, [[Boeing 720]]s, [[Boeing 727]]s, and [[Boeing 747]]s were added to the fleet. A catering department was established, and [[duty-free shop]]s were opened at Amman airport. Services were added to destinations including: Bahrain, Dubai, Muscat, Rabat, Geneva, Amsterdam, Baghdad, Bangkok, Vienna, Damascus, New York City, Houston and Ras al-Khaimah. In 1979, Alia became a founding member of the [[Arab Airlines Technical Consortium]] (AATC).\n\nIn the 1980s, Tunis and Tripoli joined the route map, and Alia's [[IBM \u2013 International Business Machines|IBM]] computer center was inaugurated. [[Lockheed L-1011 Tristar]]s, [[Airbus A310]]s and [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320s]] joined the fleet. In 1986, Alia changed its name to Royal Jordanian, when princess Alia was nearing her divorce. The airline's first woman pilot flew one of their aircraft during this decade. Service was added to Belgrade, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, Bucharest, Singapore, Riyadh, Kuala Lumpur \u2013 in cooperation with [[Malaysia Airlines|MAS]], Sana'a, Moscow, Montreal, Delhi, Calcutta and Ankara. This decade also saw the introduction of the Gabriel Automated Ticket System \u2013 (GATS).\n[[File:Alia Boeing 747-200 Gilliand.jpg|thumb|A [[Boeing 747]]-200 of the airline as seen in 1978.]]\n\nThe 1990s saw further expansion. Royal Jordanian and nine other Arab air carriers signed up for the [[Galileo CRS]]. The IMCS maintenance and engineering system was added, a new Amman city air terminal was opened at the [[7th Circle]] of the Jordanian capital, and services to Rafah started, since then halted. The cities of Toronto, Colombo, Jakarta, Berlin, Mumbai, Milan and Tel Aviv were added to the network. In November, 1997 Royal Jordanian became a code-sharing partner with the US carrier [[Trans World Airlines]] and moved operations into the [[TWA Flight Center]] (Terminal 5) at the [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in New York.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.twa.com/pressrelease/document.html?iReleaseID=142 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990913043943/http://www.twa.com/pressrelease/document.html?iReleaseID=142 |url-status=dead |archive-date=1999-09-13 |title=TWA Press Releases |access-date=2018-05-30}}</ref>\n\n=== 2000 and beyond, and privatization ===\nIn 2000, the U.S. [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) renewed the airline's maintenance and engineering department's license. The duty-free shop was among the services to be privatised. A holding company, RJI, wholly owned by the government, was incorporated as a public limited company in February 2001 to hold all the airline's and associated investments. The airline's name was changed on 5 February 2001 to ''Alia \u2013 The Royal Jordanian Airlines Company'', although travellers still use the popular name of Royal Jordanian.\n\nThe [[flag carrier]]'s subsidiary [[Royal Wings]] now operates an [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320-212]] aircraft on both scheduled and charter services to destinations in Egypt, Cyprus and Israel.\n\nOn 20 December 2006, Royal Jordanian announced that they would replace two [[Airbus A321]]s with two new units, and order four new [[Airbus A319]]s to enter service in early 2008.\n\nIn April 2007, Royal Jordanian became part of [[Oneworld]], thus becoming the first Arab airline to join such a global [[Airline alliance|alliance system]]. The following month, the airline announced an order for a total of 10 [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]]s, for service entry in 2010. This is the first order Royal Jordanian has placed with [[Boeing]].<ref name=\"AME-787s\">Golden, Lara Lynn (20 May 2007).

Also during May, Royal Jordanian was the sponsor of the [[World Economic Forum]], which was held at the [[Dead Sea]], Jordan.\n\nOn 11 July 2007, Royal Jordanian celebrated thirty years of non-stop service between Amman and New York City, making it the longest serving Arab airline to this gateway to the U.S.. RJ won the \"Airline Strategy Award\" in the technology category at the sixth annual Airline Strategy Awards on 16 July 2007. On 23 July, RJ saw the introduction of cargo flights, Damascus being the first destination served from Amman, using a [[Boeing 737]].\n\nRoyal Jordanian made its first flight to [[Budapest]], on 28 July, using an [[Embraer 195]]. In October, RJ announced the switch of two Embraer 195 jets of its original order to two Embraer 175 jets. Royal Jordanian opened a new lounge at [[King Hussein International Airport]] in [[Aqaba]].\n\nRJ will be the first Middle East airline to provide its passengers with OnAir's in-flight Internet and mobile phone services, including e-mail, SMS and voice calls.<ref>[http://www.onair.aero/ Home | OnAir].

In early 2008, however, RJ officials decided against the new route, citing that high fuel prices and a new market were a risk too large to take at that time. Royal Jordanian plans to operate the Amman-Baku route in late 2009 or early 2010. On 22 January 2008, RJ launched flights to [[Hong Kong]] via Bangkok, with three flights/week during winter, and five flights/week during summer, making it the airline's first route to China.<ref name=\"AME-HK\">Manibo, Medilyn (22 January 2008).

On the 23 March, Royal Jordanian confirmed that it had ordered two A330-200s and one Embraer 175. Royal Jordanian recommenced operations to Malaysia's capital [[Kuala Lumpur]] on June 2, 2010 after it had suspended this route in 2004. Aircraft used on this route is the new Airbus A330-200, and later switched to Boeing 787 Dreamliner.\n\nIn May 2011, Royal Jordanian announced that they will retire the [[Airbus A310]] aircraft in December 2011, and January 2012. Royal Jordanian uses an Airbus A330 and an Airbus A321 for non-stop flights to London (Heathrow Terminal 3).\n<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rj.com |title=Royal Jordanian |access-date=24 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2014, Royal Jordanian announced that it had suspended services to [[Mosul]] in [[Iraq|northern Iraq]] due to the capture of the airport by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]].\n\nThe first of Royal Jordanian's [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]] aircraft (267-seat, two-class configuration) entered service in September 2014, initially linking Amman with [[Jeddah]], [[Saudi Arabia]].<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Airliner World |issue=March 2014 |page=15}}</ref> The 787 Dreamliner is Royal Jordanian's first Boeing aircraft since the 707s and 747s, and replaced the Airbus A340-200s which had reached the end of their lives.

The Dreamliners are generally used on Royal Jordanian's Far East destinations, to London and North America.\n\nIn May 2017, Royal Jordanian announced the appointment of [[Stefan Pichler]], the ex CEO of Air Berlin, Fiji Airways, Jazeera Airways, Virgin Australia and Thomas Cook as the new President and CEO.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/rj-appoints-veteran-executive-ceo |title=RJ appoints veteran executive as CEO |date=28 May 2017}}</ref>\nPichler developed a turnaround plan which helped moving Royal Jordanian back into profitability by the end of 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://aaco.org/media-center/news/aaco-members/royal-jordanian-returns-to-profitability |title=AACO \u2013 Royal Jordanian returns to profitability}}</ref>\nIn this context, the airline cancelled the order of the 8th Dreamliner and also withdrew the A330F from its Cargo fleet for similar reasons.

In a plan to establish itself as the Middle East's \"regional airline\" it began to add smaller routes such as Alexandria in Egypt to Aleppo in Syria which the bigger airlines, such as [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]], would not undertake with the larger aircraft compared to Royal Jordanian's regional jets.

It announced at the 10th birthday celebrations in February 2009 of the airline alliance Oneworld that it would paint its new A319 due for delivery in late March in a special scheme, which would be based around the Oneworld name and logo.\n\nThe aircraft, registration JY-AYP, has its fuselage painted white, with the tailfin and engines in normal Royal Jordanian colours. \"A member of Oneworld\" in prominent lettering is located at the front of the aircraft, with the usual title \"Royal Jordanian\" further back.<ref>[http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=16589 \"oneworld airlines renew their commitment to build on the value the alliance offers customers worldwide \u2013 including a standard oneworld livery\"]. 3 February 2009.</ref>\n\n== Services ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2011}}\n\n=== Catering ===\nFood and drinks served on flights leaving Amman are provided by Dnata. Hot meals will be served on a flight of at least three hour length. If the flight is shorter than one hour the cabin crew will provide snacks and drinks throughout the flight. These flights include those to Tel Aviv, [[Cairo]], Baghdad, Beirut and Aqaba from Amman.\n\n=== In-flight entertainment ===\nRoyal Jordanian's onboard entertainment system is called \"Sky Cinema\".\n* In Economy Class on board the Airbus and Boeing aircraft all passengers are supplied with personal televisions (PTV), the system is audio- and video-on-demand system (AVOD). The system provides passengers with a selection of movies, television shows, audio and games.\n* In Crown Class, passengers are provided with AVOD which includes a large library of movies, television shows, audio and games on board the Airbus and Boeing aircraft. Portable entertainment devices (IMS) are only available for Crown Class passengers flying on Embraer aircraft. The IMS service is provided on all international flights. The IMS library contains movies, short subjects, an audio library and games.\n\nInteractive games are available in all classes on all flights, as well as news provided by [[CNN]] on all flights. On very short flights, from Amman to Tel Aviv, Amman to Beirut and Amman to Damascus, the AVOD system is turned on but there is only the selection of games, CNN News, the \"Flight Show\", and the comedy channel. This is due to the flights being less than 45 minutes hence movies/shows would not be complete upon arrival.\n\n=== Seating ===\nCrown Class seats on Boeing 787s are fully flat beds. Seat pitch is 83&nbsp;inches on the Dreamliners and 46&nbsp;inches on the short and medium haul aircraft. In Economy Class Royal Jordanian offers 32-inch seat pitch on board its Embraer aircraft, whilst it offers 34-inch seat pitch on board its Airbus aircraft. All Royal Jordanian Economy class seats also offer a foot-rest. On the Airbus A330-200s, Royal Jordanian offers lie-flat seats in Crown Class with a 62-inch seat pitch, as well as a 34-inch seat pitch in the economy class cabin.\n\n=== Crown Class lounges ===\nCrown Class passengers can use lounges across the world including all Oneworld member airline lounges. {{As of|2008|08}} Royal Jordanian operates two lounges: one in Amman, at [[Queen Alia International Airport]], and one at Aqaba, at [[King Hussein International Airport]]. In August 2008 Royal Jordanian opened its new lounge, which can handle over 340 passengers. It is located in the South Terminal on the second floor and replaces the previous Jerash and Petra lounges in the airport.\n\n=== Frequent-flyer program ===\nRoyal Club is Royal Jordanian's [[frequent flyer program]].<ref name=\"arabianaerospace.aero\" /> Passengers are awarded miles based on the type, class of flight and destination. Royal Club members can also get miles by traveling on other Oneworld airlines. Card holders of Royal Jordanian's Royal Plus with either Silver, Gold or Platinum can use Oneworld airport services across the world while Gold and Platinum also have lounge access.\n\n== Accidents and incidents ==\nRoyal Jordanian has experienced 13 [[Aviation accidents and incidents|aviation occurrences]] and six hijackings throughout its history, four of them fatal. The airline's two worst accidents, both involving [[Air charter|chartered]] [[Boeing 707]]s, happened in [[Nigeria]] in 1973 and [[Morocco]] in 1975, and to date are both the deadliest accidents in those countries and the deadliest worldwide involving the 707.\n*On April 10, 1965, all 54 passengers and crew aboard an ALIA Handley Page HPR-7 Herald 207 died after their plane crashed into a mountain near Damascus, Syria as a result of a structural failure of the fuselage in flight.\n*On January 22, 1973, [[Kano air disaster|176 people were killed]] when an ALIA Boeing 707 was landing at [[Kano]], [[Nigeria]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airdisaster.com/cgi-bin/view_details.cgi?date=01221973&reg=JY-ADO&airline=Alia+Royal+Jordanian+Airlines |title=Accident Database: Accident Synopsis 01221973 |access-date=24 April 2015}}</ref>\n*On August 3, 1975, [[Agadir air disaster|all 188 people on board were killed]] when an ALIA Boeing 707 struck a mountain ridge while making its approach for a landing in [[Morocco]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airdisaster.com/cgi-bin/view_details.cgi?date=08031975&reg=JY-AEE&airline=Alia+Royal+Jordanian+Airlines |title=Accident Database: Accident Synopsis 08031975 |access-date=24 April 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523181933/http://www.airdisaster.com/cgi-bin/view_details.cgi?date=08031975&reg=JY-AEE&airline=Alia+Royal+Jordanian+Airlines |archive-date=23 May 2013}}</ref>\n*On March 14, 1979, [[Alia Royal Jordanian Flight 600|45 of the 64 persons aboard]] an ALIA Boeing 727 were killed as a result of a windshear on landing at the Doha International Airport in [[Qatar]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airdisaster.com/cgi-bin/view_details.cgi?date=03141979&reg=JY-ADU&airline=Alia+Royal+Jordanian+Airlines |title=Accident Database: Accident Synopsis 03141979 |access-date=24 April 2015}}</ref>\n*On June 11, 1985, [[Fawaz Younis]] and four [[Amal Movement]] men hijacked Flight 402, a Boeing 727, forcing the plane to and from Beirut and Jordan. 13 hours later, after releasing the passengers, the hijackers blew up the plane.\n\nSince the name of the carrier was changed to Royal Jordanian Airlines in 1986, the only fatal incident was when a hijacker, seeking political asylum, was killed by the on-board security agent on 5 July 2000, on board a Royal Jordanian [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]] flying from Amman to Damascus.<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/07/05/world/main212387.shtml \"Bomb Explodes On Jordanian Jet\"].

This aircraft was later destroyed in the [[Kano air disaster]].]]\nThe airline was established on 9 December 1963 and started operations on 15 December 1963 after a royal decree by the late [[King Hussein]]. It was named ''Alia'' (or ''Aalya'') after King Hussein's eldest child, [[Princess Alia bint Hussein|Princess Alia bint Al Hussein]] of Jordan (born on 13 February 1956). It is a common misconception that the airline was named after the King's third wife, [[Alia al-Hussein|Queen Alia]] whom King Hussein did not marry until 1972. The airline was founded with capital from private shareholders but the [[Politics of Jordan|Jordanian government]] later took over the company.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://trofamspotting.weebly.com/royal-jordanian-airlines.html |title=Royal Jordanian Airlines |website=Trofam Spotting |access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref>\n\nAlia (the Royal Jordanian Airline) started operations with two [[Handley Page Dart Herald]]s and a [[Douglas DC-7]] aircraft, serving [[Kuwait City]], [[Beirut]] and [[Cairo]] from Amman. In 1964, another DC-7 was added and service began to [[Jeddah]]. In 1965, Alia initiated service to [[Rome]], its first destination in [[Europe]]. The progress made by the airline was threatened by an [[Israel]]i air raid during the 1967 [[Six-Day War]] when the DC-7 aircraft were destroyed. They were replaced by two [[Fokker F27 Friendship]] airliners.\n\nIn 1968, the airline expanded its route pattern to [[Nicosia]], [[Benghazi]], [[Dhahran]] and [[Doha]]. 1969 saw the addition of service to [[Munich]], [[Istanbul]] and [[Tehran]].\n[[File:Royal Jordanian Airlines L-1011 in Geneva.jpg|thumb|[[Lockheed L-1011]] TriStar of Alia in the short-lived, experimental early-1980s livery]]\n\nIn 1970, Alia joined the jet age when they phased out the F27s and ordered [[Boeing 707]] aircraft. Frankfurt and Abu Dhabi were added to the network. The 707s were delivered in 1971. In that year, service was initiated to Madrid, Copenhagen and Karachi. During the rest of the decade, [[Boeing 720]]s, [[Boeing 727]]s, and [[Boeing 747]]s were added to the fleet. A catering department was established, and [[duty-free shop]]s were opened at Amman airport. Services were added to destinations including: Bahrain, Dubai, Muscat, Rabat, Geneva, Amsterdam, Baghdad, Bangkok, Vienna, Damascus, New York City, Houston and Ras al-Khaimah. In 1979, Alia became a founding member of the [[Arab Airlines Technical Consortium]] (AATC).\n\nIn the 1980s, Tunis and Tripoli joined the route map, and Alia's [[IBM \u2013 International Business Machines|IBM]] computer center was inaugurated. [[Lockheed L-1011 Tristar]]s, [[Airbus A310]]s and [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320s]] joined the fleet. In 1986, Alia changed its name to Royal Jordanian, when princess Alia was nearing her divorce. The airline's first woman pilot flew one of their aircraft during this decade. Service was added to Belgrade, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, Bucharest, Singapore, Riyadh, Kuala Lumpur \u2013 in cooperation with [[Malaysia Airlines|MAS]], Sana'a, Moscow, Montreal, Delhi, Calcutta and Ankara. This decade also saw the introduction of the Gabriel Automated Ticket System \u2013 (GATS).\n[[File:Alia Boeing 747-200 Gilliand.jpg|thumb|A [[Boeing 747]]-200 of the airline as seen in 1978.]]\n\nThe 1990s saw further expansion. Royal Jordanian and nine other Arab air carriers signed up for the [[Galileo CRS]]. The IMCS maintenance and engineering system was added, a new Amman city air terminal was opened at the [[7th Circle]] of the Jordanian capital, and services to Rafah started, since then halted. The cities of Toronto, Colombo, Jakarta, Berlin, Mumbai, Milan and Tel Aviv were added to the network. In November, 1997 Royal Jordanian became a code-sharing partner with the US carrier [[Trans World Airlines]] and moved operations into the [[TWA Flight Center]] (Terminal 5) at the [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in New York.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.twa.com/pressrelease/document.html?iReleaseID=142 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990913043943/http://www.twa.com/pressrelease/document.html?iReleaseID=142 |url-status=dead |archive-date=1999-09-13 |title=TWA Press Releases |access-date=2018-05-30}}</ref>\n\n=== 2000 and beyond, and privatization ===\nIn 2000, the U.S. [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) renewed the airline's maintenance and engineering department's license. The duty-free shop was among the services to be privatised. A holding company, RJI, wholly owned by the government, was incorporated as a public limited company in February 2001 to hold all the airline's and associated investments. The airline's name was changed on 5 February 2001 to ''Alia \u2013 The Royal Jordanian Airlines Company'', although travellers still use the popular name of Royal Jordanian.\n\nThe [[flag carrier]]'s subsidiary [[Royal Wings]] now operates an [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320-212]] aircraft on both scheduled and charter services to destinations in Egypt, Cyprus and Israel.\n\nOn 20 December 2006, Royal Jordanian announced that they would replace two [[Airbus A321]]s with two new units, and order four new [[Airbus A319]]s to enter service in early 2008.\n\nIn April 2007, Royal Jordanian became part of [[Oneworld]], thus becoming the first Arab airline to join such a global [[Airline alliance|alliance system]]. The following month, the airline announced an order for a total of 10 [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]]s, for service entry in 2010. This is the first order Royal Jordanian has placed with [[Boeing]].<ref name=\"AME-787s\">Golden, Lara Lynn (20 May 2007).

Also during May, Royal Jordanian was the sponsor of the [[World Economic Forum]], which was held at the [[Dead Sea]], Jordan.\n\nOn 11 July 2007, Royal Jordanian celebrated thirty years of non-stop service between Amman and New York City, making it the longest serving Arab airline to this gateway to the U.S.. RJ won the \"Airline Strategy Award\" in the technology category at the sixth annual Airline Strategy Awards on 16 July 2007. On 23 July, RJ saw the introduction of cargo flights, Damascus being the first destination served from Amman, using a [[Boeing 737]].\n\nRoyal Jordanian made its first flight to [[Budapest]], on 28 July, using an [[Embraer 195]]. In October, RJ announced the switch of two Embraer 195 jets of its original order to two Embraer 175 jets. Royal Jordanian opened a new lounge at [[King Hussein International Airport]] in [[Aqaba]].\n\nRJ will be the first Middle East airline to provide its passengers with OnAir's in-flight Internet and mobile phone services, including e-mail, SMS and voice calls.<ref>[http://www.onair.aero/ Home | OnAir].

In early 2008, however, RJ officials decided against the new route, citing that high fuel prices and a new market were a risk too large to take at that time. Royal Jordanian plans to operate the Amman-Baku route in late 2009 or early 2010. On 22 January 2008, RJ launched flights to [[Hong Kong]] via Bangkok, with three flights/week during winter, and five flights/week during summer, making it the airline's first route to China.<ref name=\"AME-HK\">Manibo, Medilyn (22 January 2008).

On the 23 March, Royal Jordanian confirmed that it had ordered two A330-200s and one Embraer 175. Royal Jordanian recommenced operations to Malaysia's capital [[Kuala Lumpur]] on June 2, 2010 after it had suspended this route in 2004. Aircraft used on this route is the new Airbus A330-200, and later switched to Boeing 787 Dreamliner.\n\nIn May 2011, Royal Jordanian announced that they will retire the [[Airbus A310]] aircraft in December 2011, and January 2012. Royal Jordanian uses an Airbus A330 and an Airbus A321 for non-stop flights to London (Heathrow Terminal 3).\n<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rj.com |title=Royal Jordanian |access-date=24 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2014, Royal Jordanian announced that it had suspended services to [[Mosul]] in [[Iraq|northern Iraq]] due to the capture of the airport by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]].\n\nThe first of Royal Jordanian's [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]] aircraft (267-seat, two-class configuration) entered service in September 2014, initially linking Amman with [[Jeddah]], [[Saudi Arabia]].<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Airliner World |issue=March 2014 |page=15}}</ref> The 787 Dreamliner is Royal Jordanian's first Boeing aircraft since the 707s and 747s, and replaced the Airbus A340-200s which had reached the end of their lives. The Dreamliners have replaced  the Airbus A330-200s as leases on those aircraft have expired. The Dreamliners are generally used on Royal Jordanian's Far East destinations, to London and North America.\n\nIn May 2017, Royal Jordanian announced the appointment of [[Stefan Pichler]], the ex CEO of Air Berlin, Fiji Airways, Jazeera Airways, Virgin Australia and Thomas Cook as the new President and CEO.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/rj-appoints-veteran-executive-ceo |title=RJ appoints veteran executive as CEO |date=28 May 2017}}</ref>\nPichler developed a turnaround plan which helped moving Royal Jordanian back into profitability by the end of 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://aaco.org/media-center/news/aaco-members/royal-jordanian-returns-to-profitability |title=AACO \u2013 Royal Jordanian returns to profitability}}</ref>\nIn this context, the airline cancelled the order of the 8th Dreamliner and also withdrew the A330F from its Cargo fleet for similar reasons. The CEO also stated that the strategy of Royal Jordanian would lead to a  single type narrow-body fleet, not mentioning whether it will be Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier, or Embraer.\n\n== Corporate affairs ==\n=== Head office ===\n[[File:RJ bld, Amman, Jordan.jpg|thumb|Royal Jordanian's new headquarters in [[Amman]]]]\n{{As of|2009}} Haddadinco Engineering Company for Contracting is building the new Royal Jordanian head office in Amman.<ref>[http://www.rj.com/tabid/59/locale/en-US/default.aspx?itemid=210 \"RJ News\"].

It began to put into place a new strategy at the end of 2002 which saw the airline concentrate on its neighboring nations, with increased frequencies. In a plan to establish itself as the Middle East's \"regional airline\" it began to add smaller routes such as Alexandria in Egypt to Aleppo in Syria which the bigger airlines, such as [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]], would not undertake with the larger aircraft compared to Royal Jordanian's regional jets. As of the end of 2008, the plan had proven successful for the airline, with its main rivals being [[Middle East Airlines]] and [[Egypt Air]].<ref name=\"FG-Samer\">Sobie, Brendan (22 January 2008).

It announced at the 10th birthday celebrations in February 2009 of the airline alliance Oneworld that it would paint its new A319 due for delivery in late March in a special scheme, which would be based around the Oneworld name and logo.\n\nThe aircraft, registration JY-AYP, has its fuselage painted white, with the tailfin and engines in normal Royal Jordanian colours. \"A member of Oneworld\" in prominent lettering is located at the front of the aircraft, with the usual title \"Royal Jordanian\" further back.<ref>[http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=16589 \"oneworld airlines renew their commitment to build on the value the alliance offers customers worldwide \u2013 including a standard oneworld livery\"]. 3 February 2009.</ref>\n\n== Services ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2011}}\n\n=== Catering ===\nFood and drinks served on flights leaving Amman are provided by Dnata. Hot meals will be served on a flight of at least three hour length. If the flight is shorter than one hour the cabin crew will provide snacks and drinks throughout the flight. These flights include those to Tel Aviv, [[Cairo]], Baghdad, Beirut and Aqaba from Amman.\n\n=== In-flight entertainment ===\nRoyal Jordanian's onboard entertainment system is called \"Sky Cinema\".\n* In Economy Class on board the Airbus and Boeing aircraft all passengers are supplied with personal televisions (PTV), the system is audio- and video-on-demand system (AVOD). The system provides passengers with a selection of movies, television shows, audio and games.\n* In Crown Class, passengers are provided with AVOD which includes a large library of movies, television shows, audio and games on board the Airbus and Boeing aircraft. Portable entertainment devices (IMS) are only available for Crown Class passengers flying on Embraer aircraft. The IMS service is provided on all international flights. The IMS library contains movies, short subjects, an audio library and games.\n\nInteractive games are available in all classes on all flights, as well as news provided by [[CNN]] on all flights. On very short flights, from Amman to Tel Aviv, Amman to Beirut and Amman to Damascus, the AVOD system is turned on but there is only the selection of games, CNN News, the \"Flight Show\", and the comedy channel. This is due to the flights being less than 45 minutes hence movies/shows would not be complete upon arrival.\n\n=== Seating ===\nCrown Class seats on Boeing 787s are fully flat beds. Seat pitch is 83&nbsp;inches on the Dreamliners and 46&nbsp;inches on the short and medium haul aircraft. In Economy Class Royal Jordanian offers 32-inch seat pitch on board its Embraer aircraft, whilst it offers 34-inch seat pitch on board its Airbus aircraft. All Royal Jordanian Economy class seats also offer a foot-rest. On the Airbus A330-200s, Royal Jordanian offers lie-flat seats in Crown Class with a 62-inch seat pitch, as well as a 34-inch seat pitch in the economy class cabin.\n\n=== Crown Class lounges ===\nCrown Class passengers can use lounges across the world including all Oneworld member airline lounges. {{As of|2008|08}} Royal Jordanian operates two lounges: one in Amman, at [[Queen Alia International Airport]], and one at Aqaba, at [[King Hussein International Airport]]. In August 2008 Royal Jordanian opened its new lounge, which can handle over 340 passengers. It is located in the South Terminal on the second floor and replaces the previous Jerash and Petra lounges in the airport.\n\n=== Frequent-flyer program ===\nRoyal Club is Royal Jordanian's [[frequent flyer program]].<ref name=\"arabianaerospace.aero\" /> Passengers are awarded miles based on the type, class of flight and destination. Royal Club members can also get miles by traveling on other Oneworld airlines. Card holders of Royal Jordanian's Royal Plus with either Silver, Gold or Platinum can use Oneworld airport services across the world while Gold and Platinum also have lounge access.\n\n== Accidents and incidents ==\nRoyal Jordanian has experienced 13 [[Aviation accidents and incidents|aviation occurrences]] and six hijackings throughout its history, four of them fatal. The airline's two worst accidents, both involving [[Air charter|chartered]] [[Boeing 707]]s, happened in [[Nigeria]] in 1973 and [[Morocco]] in 1975, and to date are both the deadliest accidents in those countries and the deadliest worldwide involving the 707.\n*On April 10, 1965, all 54 passengers and crew aboard an ALIA Handley Page HPR-7 Herald 207 died after their plane crashed into a mountain near Damascus, Syria as a result of a structural failure of the fuselage in flight.\n*On January 22, 1973, [[Kano air disaster|176 people were killed]] when an ALIA Boeing 707 was landing at [[Kano]], [[Nigeria]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airdisaster.com/cgi-bin/view_details.cgi?date=01221973&reg=JY-ADO&airline=Alia+Royal+Jordanian+Airlines |title=Accident Database: Accident Synopsis 01221973 |access-date=24 April 2015}}</ref>\n*On August 3, 1975, [[Agadir air disaster|all 188 people on board were killed]] when an ALIA Boeing 707 struck a mountain ridge while making its approach for a landing in [[Morocco]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airdisaster.com/cgi-bin/view_details.cgi?date=08031975&reg=JY-AEE&airline=Alia+Royal+Jordanian+Airlines |title=Accident Database: Accident Synopsis 08031975 |access-date=24 April 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523181933/http://www.airdisaster.com/cgi-bin/view_details.cgi?date=08031975&reg=JY-AEE&airline=Alia+Royal+Jordanian+Airlines |archive-date=23 May 2013}}</ref>\n*On March 14, 1979, [[Alia Royal Jordanian Flight 600|45 of the 64 persons aboard]] an ALIA Boeing 727 were killed as a result of a windshear on landing at the Doha International Airport in [[Qatar]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airdisaster.com/cgi-bin/view_details.cgi?date=03141979&reg=JY-ADU&airline=Alia+Royal+Jordanian+Airlines |title=Accident Database: Accident Synopsis 03141979 |access-date=24 April 2015}}</ref>\n*On June 11, 1985, [[Fawaz Younis]] and four [[Amal Movement]] men hijacked Flight 402, a Boeing 727, forcing the plane to and from Beirut and Jordan. 13 hours later, after releasing the passengers, the hijackers blew up the plane.\n\nSince the name of the carrier was changed to Royal Jordanian Airlines in 1986, the only fatal incident was when a hijacker, seeking political asylum, was killed by the on-board security agent on 5 July 2000, on board a Royal Jordanian [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]] flying from Amman to Damascus.<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/07/05/world/main212387.shtml \"Bomb Explodes On Jordanian Jet\"].
