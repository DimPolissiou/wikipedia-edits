Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>{{Baumgartner, Richard A. (2007). Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, John T. Wilder took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry]] Regiments, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His intial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavlary to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the the Rolling Fork River.<ref>The History of Morgan\u2019s Cavalry, Basil W. Duke, Indiana University Press</ref><ref>John Hunt Morgan and his Raiders, Edison H. Thomas, University of KY Press</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Scretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creatuve man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nFrom the outset, the brigade used their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but once engaged with the enemy, the soldiers fought dismounted. It was due to this speed of deployment that the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>{{Baumgartner, Richard A. (2007). Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga.

Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, John T. Wilder took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry]] Regiments, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His intial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavlary to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the the Rolling Fork River.<ref>The History of Morgan\u2019s Cavalry, Basil W. Duke, Indiana University Press</ref><ref>John Hunt Morgan and his Raiders, Edison H. Thomas, University of KY Press</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Scretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creatuve man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nFrom the outset, the brigade used their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but once engaged with the enemy, the soldiers fought dismounted. It was due to this speed of deployment that the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref>,ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arangement to Spencer.

His troops struck out toward Liberty, Hoover's, and Bellbuckle Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]]). On June 24, Maj. Gen.

The number of spikes in one of these chairs ranges from 500 to 1,500.\n\n==== Use ====\nTo avoid movement, the victim's wrists were tied to the chair or, in one version, two bars pushed the arms against arm-rests for the spikes to penetrate the flesh even further. In some versions, there were holes under the chair's bottom where the torturer placed coal to cause severe burns while the victim still remained conscious. In other versions, there were weights that would be placed on the victim's thighs or feet. In a special version, there were spikes on the headrest and the executioner pushed his head against it.\n\nThis instrument's strength lies primarily in the psychological fear caused to the victims. They would often use the victim's fear to scare them. It was a common practice to extract a confession by forcing the victim to watch someone else be tortured with this instrument.\n\nThe time of death greatly varied ranging from a few hours to a day or more. No spikes penetrated any vital organ and the wounds were closed by the spikes themselves which delayed blood loss greatly.\n\n=== The Rack ===\n{{main article|Rack (torture)}}\n[[Image:A Torture Rack.jpg|thumb|right|100px|A torture rack in the Tower of London]]\n\n==== Origins ====\nThe rack was first used in [[ancient history|antiquity]] and it is unclear exactly from which civilization it originated, though some of the earliest examples are from Greece.<br>\n[[Arrian]]'s ''[[Anabasis of Alexander]]'' states that [[Alexander the Great]] had the pages who conspired in his assassination, and their mentor, his court historian [[Callisthenes]], tortured on the rack in 328 BC.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924026460752/cu31924026460752_djvu.txt The Anabasis of Arrian ]</ref>\n\n==== Appearance ====\n[[The rack]] is a torture device that consists of an [[rectangle|oblong]], [[rectangular]], usually wooden frame, slightly raised from the ground, with a roller at one, or both, ends, having at one end a fixed bar to which the legs were fastened, and at the other a movable bar to which the hands were tied. The victim's feet are fastened to one roller, and the wrists are chained to the other.\n\n==== Use ====\nThe torturer turned the handle causing the ropes to pull the victim's arms. Eventually, the victim's bones were [[Joint dislocation|dislocated]] with a loud crack, caused by snapping [[cartilage]], [[ligaments]] or bones. If the torturer kept turning the handles the [[limb (anatomy)|limb]]s would eventually be torn off.\n\nThis method was mostly used to extract confessions, not confessing meant that the torturer could stretch more. Sometimes, torturers forced their victim to watch other people be tortured with this device to implant [[psychological]] fear.\n\nMany knights from the [[Knights Templar]] were tortured with the rack. The limbs collected from this and other [[punishments]] of the time were \"emptied by the hundreds\".\n\nSometime this method was limited to dislocating a few bones, but the torturer often went too far and rendered the legs or arms (sometimes both) useless. In the late Middle Ages, some new variants of this instrument appeared. They often had spikes that penetrated the victim's back - as the limbs were pulled apart, so was his or her spinal cord increasing not only in physical pain, but the psychological one of being handicapped at best, too.\n\n=== Brazen Bull ===\n{{main article|Brazen bull}}\n[[Image:Hans Burgkmair Brazen bull.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A brazen bull as depicted by [[Hans Burgkmair|Hans Burgkmair the Elder]].]]\n\n==== Origins ====\nThe Brazen Bull was invented in [[Ancient Greece]], by Perillos of [[Athens]]. Perillos proposed his idea of a more painful means of execution to [[Phalaris]], the [[tyrant]] of [[Akraga]]. Phalaris liked the idea of the Brazen Bull, and so it was made. Once finished, Phalaris ordered it to be tested on Perillos himself. Perillos was removed from the Bull before he died, but was later killed by Phalaris when he threw Perillos off a hill.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\nThe Greek had specially engineered tubes to make the screams of the victims sound like the noise of a bull.\n\n==== Appearance ====\nThe Bull was made  brass, and was hollow with a door in the side.\n\n==== Use ====\nWhen a victim was placed inside the brazen bull, she or he was slowly burned to death. The device gradually became more sophisticated, until the Greeks invented a complex system of tubes in order to make the victim's screams sound more like an infuriated [[bull]], and also made it so the smoke from it rose in clouds of [[incense]]. This torture is similar to being [[boiled]] alive.\n\nEven though this torture was not used during the Middle Ages as it was used earlier by the [[Greeks|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], a simple form of boiling was still used in [[Central Europe]], without the use of the bull.\n\n=== Chinese Iron Maiden ===\n\n==== Origin ====\nSimilar to the Iron Maiden of the 19th century, this device was first used in the Ming Dynasty.\n\n==== Appearance ====\nIt stood like a coffin but was raised on a platform with an iron grate on the bottom instead of a piece of wood. Like the Iron Maiden, this coffin was made of brass or sometimes even iron. But, unlike the iron maiden, it was optional to include spikes or not.\n\n==== Use ====\nThe Chinese Iron Maiden was generally used to punish those who were not loyal to the king but it was also used to set an example for other future wrongdoers. The prisoner would be locked into the coffin and made to stand on the grated bottom. Then, the executioner would pour water onto hot coals that they placed under the grated platform. The mixture of hot coals and cold water would create a cloud of steam that went into the coffin, steaming the person alive.\n\n=== Pear of Anguish ===\n{{main article|Pear of anguish}}\n\n==== Appearance ====\nA [[pear]] shaped instrument, consisting of four leaves that slowly separated from each other as the torturer turned the screw at the top.\n\n==== Use ====\nThere is no contemporary first-hand account of those devices or their use.  An early mention of a spring-loaded gagging device is in F. de Calvi's ''L'Inventaire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'histoire des larrons'' (\"General inventory of the history of thieves\"), written in 1639, which attributes the invention to a robber named Capitaine Gaucherou de Palioly in the days of [[Henry of Navarre]].\n\nFurther mentions of the device appear in the 19th century. They are also mentioned in Grose's Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue (1811) as \"Choak Pears,\" and described as being \"formerly used in Holland.\"[3]\n\nThey were also discussed in a book by Eldridge and Watts, superintendent of police and chief inspector of the detective bureau in Boston, Massachusetts (1897). While accepting that ordinary pear-shaped gags exist, they observed that contemporary robbers used no such device as Palioly's Pear and cast doubt upon its very existence in the first place, saying that \"fortunately for us this 'diabolical invention' appears to be one of the lost arts, if, indeed, it ever existed outside of de Calvi's head. There is no doubt, however, of the fashioning of a pear-shaped gag which has been largely used in former days by robbers in Europe, and may still be employed to some extent. This is also known as the 'choke-pear', though it is far less marvellous and dangerous than the pear of Palioly.\"\n\nThough there is little or no evidence of its being used by bandits, there are a number of examples of ornate and elaborate, pear-shaped devices with three or four leaves or lobes, driven by turning a key that rotates the central screw thread, which spreads the leaves. These are generally held in museums devoted to the subject of torture, and are described as instruments of torture by distension or evisceration. Some, but not all, have small spikes of uncertain purpose at the bottom of each leaf. However, these devices do not seem to match the descriptions given by Calvi or the 19th century sources.\n\n=== Dunking ===\n{{main article|Dunking}}\n[[File:Old woman draught at Ratcliffe Highway.png|thumb|200px|right|Punishing a [[common scold]] in the [[dunking stool]].]]\n\n==== Use ====\nThis was a form of punishment that was mainly reserved for supposed [[witches]]. The victim was tied to a chair which was elevated by ropes above a [[pond]] or [[Barrel|vat]] of water. The victim was then lowered into the water until completely [[Underwater|submerged]]. The chair was raised if the victim was about to pass out, or to give the victim a chance to [[Confession (law)|confess]]. Often, some form of plug or more simply, a piece of fruit, was placed in the victims mouth and nose beforehand, so they couldn't get a good breath before being dunked. If the victim confessed they would most likely be killed. This method was widely used during the Spanish Inquisition and in England and [[France]]. The victim was usually intermittently submerged for many hours until he or she revealed information or death had occurred. Ordeal by water began with the witch-hunts of the 16th and 17th centuries. King James VI of Scotland (later also James I of England) claimed in his Daemonologie that water was so pure an element that it repelled the guilty.\n\nWhile supposed witches were commonly tortured using this method, [[thieves]] and [[murderers]] could be subjected to it in order to extract a confession. This was more common when other more sophisticated torture devices were not present.\n\nDunking was also used as punishment for [[common scold]]s.\n\n=== Boiling ===\n{{main article|Death by boiling}}\n\n==== Use ====\n\nIn England, statute 22 passed in 1532 by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], made boiling a legal form of capital punishment. It began to be used for murderers who used [[poison]]s after the [[John Fisher|Bishop of Rochester's]] cook, [[Richard Rice (poisoner)|Richard Rice]], gave a number of people poisoned [[porridge]], resulting in two deaths in February 1532.<ref>{{Citation | last = Kesselring| first = K.J.| date = Sep 2001|title = A Draft of the 1531 'Acte for Poysoning'|jstor = 579196| pages = 894\u2013899 | publisher = The English Historical Review Vol. 116, No. 468}}</ref> Boiling to death was employed again in 1542 for a woman who also used poison.<ref name=Newlin2000>{{Citation | last = Newlin | first = George | year = 2000 | title = Understanding Great expectations | pages = [https://archive.org/details/understandinggre00newl/page/136 136] | isbn = 978-0-313-29940-7 | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Conn. | oclc = 41488673 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/understandinggre00newl/page/136 }}</ref><ref>Leslie, Frank, Frank Leslie, and Ellery Sedgwick. 1876.

The liquid was then [[boiled]]. Sometimes the victim would be placed in the cauldron before it was boiled so as to be cooked slowly. Or they would be placed, usually head first, into the already boiling liquid.\n\nThis was more frequently a way to [[Capital punishment|execute]] a prisoner rather than to extract a confession.\n\n=== Exposure ===\n\n==== Types ====\n\n===== Freezing to death =====\nIn the winter, the naked victim was forced to stand outside in full view of everyone. Slowly, the torturer poured water on the victim's head which eventually became frozen, making them die slowly and painfully. Sometimes the body was left for the whole winter to terrify the population and dissuade any further crimes.\n\n===== Burning =====\nIn the summer, the person would be coated with a mixture of boiling water and oil while stripped naked, and put out in the sun. They would then burn them to death.\n\n===== Live Burial =====\n{{further information|Premature burial}}\nAs its name implies, this method consists of exposing a victim to the elements. The victim could be buried up to his neck letting any animals, insects or other people kill him slowly.\n\n===== Restraint =====\nIn some towns there were chains, stocks or ropes used to quickly restrain someone outside. In very severe cases, the victim was simply left to die of hunger and thirst.\n\nIn addition to regular restraint, the [[gibbet]], a large basket made of iron or other metal, with holes large enough for arms and legs, but not for an entire body to fit through, would be hung from a pole with a person inside it. During hot days, the metal would heat, causing pain. During cold days and nights, the chill, as well as lack of protection from the wind, could easily sap a victim's body heat. The holes in the grating were also big enough to allow carrion birds, and the occasional rat, to enter and pluck at a victim's skin and eyes.\n\n==== Use ====\nDue to its cost efficiency and cruelty, the exposure torture was very widespread in [[medieval Europe]]. The victim's remains often served as a warning to the population.\n\nIn many cases, the victim was sentenced to a short period of exposure, depending on the crime. However, death was frequent since they were completely defenseless.\n\n=== Brown Rats ===\n{{main article|Rat torture}}\nA cheap and effective way to torture someone was with the use of rats. There were many variants, but the most common was to force a rat through a victim's body (usually the [[intestines]]) as a way to escape. This was done as follows:\n#The victim was completely restrained and tied to the ground or a bed.\n#The victim would then have many slits cut in their stomach.\n#Then they would place rats and trap them with a bowl on the victim's stomach, then place hot coal on top of the bowl and the rats would get hot, a few seconds would go by and they will go into your stomach.\nGnawing the intestines usually resulted in a few hours of [[Pain|agonizing]] pain for the victim. This almost always resulted in death.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of methods of capital punishment]] (torture devices)\n* [[Peine forte et dure]]\n* [[Torture chamber]]\n* [[Torture Museums]]\n** [[R\u00fcdesheim am Rhein#Museums]] (Mediaeval Torture Museum)\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Methods Of Torture}}\n[[Category:Instruments of torture| ]]\n[[Category:Physical torture techniques| ]]\n[[Category:Society-related lists|Torture methods]]\n[[Category:Corporal punishments|Torture methods]]\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/eg1xup/rick_astley_docet/\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Refimprove|date=August 2009}}\n\nA '''list of [[Torture]] methods and devices''' includes:\n\n==Psychological torture methods==\n*[[Ego death|Ego-Fragmentation]]\n*[[Learned Helplessness]]\n*[[Chinese water torture]]\n*[[Welcome parade (torture)]]\n\n==Physical torture methods==<!-- This section is linked from [[Torture]] -->\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Blindness|Blinding]] with light\n* [[Blood eagle]]\n* [[Boiling to death|Boiling]]\n* [[Bone fracture|Bone breaking]]\n* [[Human branding|Branding]]\n* [[Castor oil#Punishment|Castor oil]]\n* [[Castration]]\n* [[Chinese water torture]]\n* Cold cell torture{{clarify |date=May 2018 |reason=no article, what is this? }}\n* [[Cock and ball torture]]\n* [[Combing (torture)|Combing]]\n* [[Crushing (execution)|Crushing]]\n* [[Cutting]]\n* [[Dehydration]]\n* [[Denailing]]\n* [[Disfigurement]]\n* [[Drowning]]\n* [[Dry-boarding]]\n* [[Dunking]]\n* [[Enema#Punitive usage|Enemas]]\n* [[Flagellation]]\n* [[Flaying]]\n* [[Foot roasting]]\n* [[Foot whipping]] (a.k.a.

The limbs collected from this and other [[punishments]] of the time were \"emptied by the hundreds\".\n\nSometime this method was limited to dislocating a few bones, but the torturer often went too far and rendered the legs or arms (sometimes both) useless. In the late Middle Ages, some new variants of this instrument appeared. They often had spikes that penetrated the victim's back - as the limbs were pulled apart, so was his or her spinal cord increasing not only in physical pain, but the psychological one of being handicapped at best, too.\n\n=== Brazen Bull ===\n{{main article|Brazen bull}}\n[[Image:Hans Burgkmair Brazen bull.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A brazen bull as depicted by [[Hans Burgkmair|Hans Burgkmair the Elder]].]]\n\n==== Origins ====\nThe Brazen Bull was invented in [[Ancient Greece]], by Perillos of [[Athens]]. Perillos proposed his idea of a more painful means of execution to [[Phalaris]], the [[tyrant]] of [[Akraga]]. Phalaris liked the idea of the Brazen Bull, and so it was made. Once finished, Phalaris ordered it to be tested on Perillos himself. Perillos was removed from the Bull before he died, but was later killed by Phalaris when he threw Perillos off a hill.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\nThe Greek had specially engineered tubes to make the screams of the victims sound like the noise of a bull.\n\n==== Appearance ====\nThe Bull was made wholly of brass, and was hollow with a door in the side.\n\n==== Use ====\nWhen a victim was placed inside the brazen bull, she or he was slowly burned to death. The device gradually became more sophisticated, until the Greeks invented a complex system of tubes in order to make the victim's screams sound more like an infuriated [[bull]], and also made it so the smoke from it rose in clouds of [[incense]]. This torture is similar to being [[boiled]] alive.\n\nEven though this torture was not used during the Middle Ages as it was used earlier by the [[Greeks|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], a simple form of boiling was still used in [[Central Europe]], without the use of the bull.\n\n=== Chinese Iron Maiden ===\n\n==== Origin ====\nSimilar to the Iron Maiden of the 19th century, this device was first used in the Ming Dynasty.\n\n==== Appearance ====\nIt stood like a coffin but was raised on a platform with an iron grate on the bottom instead of a piece of wood. Like the Iron Maiden, this coffin was made of brass or sometimes even iron. But, unlike the iron maiden, it was optional to include spikes or not.\n\n==== Use ====\nThe Chinese Iron Maiden was generally used to punish those who were not loyal to the king but it was also used to set an example for other future wrongdoers. The prisoner would be locked into the coffin and made to stand on the grated bottom. Then, the executioner would pour water onto hot coals that they placed under the grated platform. The mixture of hot coals and cold water would create a cloud of steam that went into the coffin, steaming the person alive.\n\n=== Pear of Anguish ===\n{{main article|Pear of anguish}}\n\n==== Appearance ====\nA [[pear]] shaped instrument, consisting of four leaves that slowly separated from each other as the torturer turned the screw at the top.\n\n==== Use ====\nThere is no contemporary first-hand account of those devices or their use.  An early mention of a spring-loaded gagging device is in F. de Calvi's ''L'Inventaire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'histoire des larrons'' (\"General inventory of the history of thieves\"), written in 1639, which attributes the invention to a robber named Capitaine Gaucherou de Palioly in the days of [[Henry of Navarre]].\n\nFurther mentions of the device appear in the 19th century. They are also mentioned in Grose's Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue (1811) as \"Choak Pears,\" and described as being \"formerly used in Holland.\"[3]\n\nThey were also discussed in a book by Eldridge and Watts, superintendent of police and chief inspector of the detective bureau in Boston, Massachusetts (1897). While accepting that ordinary pear-shaped gags exist, they observed that contemporary robbers used no such device as Palioly's Pear and cast doubt upon its very existence in the first place, saying that \"fortunately for us this 'diabolical invention' appears to be one of the lost arts, if, indeed, it ever existed outside of de Calvi's head. There is no doubt, however, of the fashioning of a pear-shaped gag which has been largely used in former days by robbers in Europe, and may still be employed to some extent. This is also known as the 'choke-pear', though it is far less marvellous and dangerous than the pear of Palioly.\"\n\nThough there is little or no evidence of its being used by bandits, there are a number of examples of ornate and elaborate, pear-shaped devices with three or four leaves or lobes, driven by turning a key that rotates the central screw thread, which spreads the leaves. These are generally held in museums devoted to the subject of torture, and are described as instruments of torture by distension or evisceration. Some, but not all, have small spikes of uncertain purpose at the bottom of each leaf. However, these devices do not seem to match the descriptions given by Calvi or the 19th century sources.\n\n=== Dunking ===\n{{main article|Dunking}}\n[[File:Old woman draught at Ratcliffe Highway.png|thumb|200px|right|Punishing a [[common scold]] in the [[dunking stool]].]]\n\n==== Use ====\nThis was a form of punishment that was mainly reserved for supposed [[witches]]. The victim was tied to a chair which was elevated by ropes above a [[pond]] or [[Barrel|vat]] of water. The victim was then lowered into the water until completely [[Underwater|submerged]]. The chair was raised if the victim was about to pass out, or to give the victim a chance to [[Confession (law)|confess]]. Often, some form of plug or more simply, a piece of fruit, was placed in the victims mouth and nose beforehand, so they couldn't get a good breath before being dunked. If the victim confessed they would most likely be killed. This method was widely used during the Spanish Inquisition and in England and [[France]]. The victim was usually intermittently submerged for many hours until he or she revealed information or death had occurred. Ordeal by water began with the witch-hunts of the 16th and 17th centuries. King James VI of Scotland (later also James I of England) claimed in his Daemonologie that water was so pure an element that it repelled the guilty.\n\nWhile supposed witches were commonly tortured using this method, [[thieves]] and [[murderers]] could be subjected to it in order to extract a confession. This was more common when other more sophisticated torture devices were not present.\n\nDunking was also used as punishment for [[common scold]]s.\n\n=== Boiling ===\n{{main article|Death by boiling}}\n\n==== Use ====\n\nIn England, statute 22 passed in 1532 by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], made boiling a legal form of capital punishment. It began to be used for murderers who used [[poison]]s after the [[John Fisher|Bishop of Rochester's]] cook, [[Richard Rice (poisoner)|Richard Rice]], gave a number of people poisoned [[porridge]], resulting in two deaths in February 1532.<ref>{{Citation | last = Kesselring| first = K.J.| date = Sep 2001|title = A Draft of the 1531 'Acte for Poysoning'|jstor = 579196| pages = 894\u2013899 | publisher = The English Historical Review Vol. 116, No. 468}}</ref> Boiling to death was employed again in 1542 for a woman who also used poison.<ref name=Newlin2000>{{Citation | last = Newlin | first = George | year = 2000 | title = Understanding Great expectations | pages = [https://archive.org/details/understandinggre00newl/page/136 136] | isbn = 978-0-313-29940-7 | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Conn. | oclc = 41488673 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/understandinggre00newl/page/136 }}</ref><ref>Leslie, Frank, Frank Leslie, and Ellery Sedgwick. 1876.

The liquid was then [[boiled]]. Sometimes the victim would be placed in the cauldron before it was boiled so as to be cooked slowly. Or they would be placed, usually head first, into the already boiling liquid.\n\nThis was more frequently a way to [[Capital punishment|execute]] a prisoner rather than to extract a confession.\n\n=== Exposure ===\n\n==== Types ====\n\n===== Freezing to death =====\nIn the winter, the naked victim was forced to stand outside in full view of everyone. Slowly, the torturer poured water on the victim's head which eventually became frozen, making them die slowly and painfully. Sometimes the body was left for the whole winter to terrify the population and dissuade any further crimes.\n\n===== Burning =====\nIn the summer, the person would be coated with a mixture of boiling water and oil while stripped naked, and put out in the sun. They would then burn them to death.\n\n===== Live Burial =====\n{{further information|Premature burial}}\nAs its name implies, this method consists of exposing a victim to the elements. The victim could be buried up to his neck letting any animals, insects or other people kill him slowly.\n\n===== Restraint =====\nIn some towns there were chains, stocks or ropes used to quickly restrain someone outside. In very severe cases, the victim was simply left to die of hunger and thirst.\n\nIn addition to regular restraint, the [[gibbet]], a large basket made of iron or other metal, with holes large enough for arms and legs, but not for an entire body to fit through, would be hung from a pole with a person inside it. During hot days, the metal would heat, causing pain. During cold days and nights, the chill, as well as lack of protection from the wind, could easily sap a victim's body heat. The holes in the grating were also big enough to allow carrion birds, and the occasional rat, to enter and pluck at a victim's skin and eyes.\n\n==== Use ====\nDue to its cost efficiency and cruelty, the exposure torture was very widespread in [[medieval Europe]]. The victim's remains often served as a warning to the population.\n\nIn many cases, the victim was sentenced to a short period of exposure, depending on the crime. However, death was frequent since they were completely defenseless.\n\n=== Brown Rats ===\n{{main article|Rat torture}}\nA cheap and effective way to torture someone was with the use of rats. There were many variants, but the most common was to force a rat through a victim's body (usually the [[intestines]]) as a way to escape. This was done as follows:\n#The victim was completely restrained and tied to the ground or a bed.\n#The victim would then have many slits cut in their stomach.\n#Then they would place rats and trap them with a bowl on the victim's stomach, then place hot coal on top of the bowl and the rats would get hot, a few seconds would go by and they will go into your stomach.\nGnawing the intestines usually resulted in a few hours of [[Pain|agonizing]] pain for the victim. This almost always resulted in death.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of methods of capital punishment]] (torture devices)\n* [[Peine forte et dure]]\n* [[Torture chamber]]\n* [[Torture Museums]]\n** [[R\u00fcdesheim am Rhein#Museums]] (Mediaeval Torture Museum)\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Methods Of Torture}}\n[[Category:Instruments of torture| ]]\n[[Category:Physical torture techniques| ]]\n[[Category:Society-related lists|Torture methods]]\n[[Category:Corporal punishments|Torture methods]]\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/eg1xup/rick_astley_docet/\n", "name_user": "117.230.46.63", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eAppearance:Fixed grammar)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_methods_of_torture"}

It is currently a 6/47 lottery with an additional \"bonus ball.\" Its starting jackpot is a guaranteed \u20ac2 million, which rolls over until it is won. The minimum play in Lotto has always been two lines of six numbers each. At Lotto's current cost of \u20ac2 per line, a Lotto ticket costs a minimum of \u20ac4. Lotto has produced two spinoff games, Lotto 5-4-3-2-1, which began in 1997, and Lotto Plus, which began in 2000.<ref>http://www.lottery.ie/en/games/how-to-play/how-to-play-lotto/</ref>\n\nThe largest ever Lotto jackpot of \u20ac18.9 million was won on 28 June 2008 by a syndicate of 16 colleagues at a quarry and concrete plant in Bennekerry, [[Carlow]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/gold-strike-for-quarry-team-26458568.html | work=The Irish Independent | title=Gold strike for quarry team | date=1 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nSales of Lotto fell from \u20ac379.1 million in 2011 to \u20ac339.7 million in 2012. The National Lottery said that this reflected lower jackpot levels during the year.<ref name=\"2012 Report\"/>\n\n====History of Lotto====\n{{More citations needed|section|date=May 2019}}\nThe first Lotto drawing was held on Saturday, 16 April 1988. In its original 6/36 format, six numbered balls were drawn from a [[lottery machine]] containing 36 balls. Players could win a share of a guaranteed [[Irish pound|\u00a3]]250,000 jackpot by matching all six numbers, or win smaller prizes by matching four or five numbers. If no winning ticket was sold, the jackpot rolled over for the next draw. Drawings continued each Saturday night until 30 May 1990, when the National Lottery introduced a midweek Lotto draw on Wednesday nights. Lotto draws have been held twice weekly since that time. The Lotto for Saturday if Christmas Day is falling on Saturday transferred to Christmas Eve, Friday or Wednesday draw to Tuesday (1991-2002) or Thursday in 2013.\n\nIn a 6/36 lottery, the odds of matching all six numbers and winning the jackpot are 1 in 1,947,792. At Lotto's initial cost of [[Irish pound|\u00a3]]0.50 per line, all possible combinations could be purchased for [[Irish pound|\u00a3]]973,896. This left Lotto vulnerable to a [[brute force attack]], which happened when the jackpot reached [[Irish pound|\u00a3]]1.7 million for the May 1992 [[bank holiday]] drawing. A 28-member [[Dublin]]-based syndicate, organized and headed by Polish-Irish businessman Stefan Klincewicz, had spent six months preparing by marking combinations on almost a quarter of a million paper playslips. In the days before the drawing they tried to buy up all possible combinations and thus win all possible prizes, including the jackpot.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/how-to-make-a-killing-on-the-lottery-1322272.html | work=The Independent | title=How to make a killing on the lottery | date=4 January 1996}}</ref>\n\nThe National Lottery tried to foil Klincewicz's plan by limiting the number of tickets any single machine could sell, and by turning off the terminals his ticket purchasers were known to be using heavily. Despite its efforts, the syndicate did manage to buy over 80 percent of the combinations, spending an estimated [[Irish pound|\u00a3]]820,000 on tickets. It had the winning numbers on the night, but two other winning tickets were also sold, so the syndicate could claim only one-third of the jackpot, or [[Irish pound|\u00a3]]568,682. Match-5 and match-4 prizes brought the syndicate's total winnings to approximately [[Irish pound|\u00a3]]1,166,000, representing a profit of approximately [[Irish pound|\u00a3]]310,000 before expenses. Klincewicz later appeared on the television talk show ''[[Kenny Live]]'' and wrote a self-published lottery-system book entitled ''Win the Lotto.''\n\nTo prevent such a brute force attack from happening again, the National Lottery changed Lotto to a 6/39 game later in 1992, raising the jackpot odds to 1 in 3,262,623. The first Lotto 6/39 drawing was held on 22 August 1992. To compensate for the longer jackpot odds, the National Lottery doubled the starting jackpot to  and added a \"bonus number\" to the drawings. Whereas players previously needed either a match-6, match-5, or match-4 to win, prizes were now also awarded for match-5+bonus, match-4+bonus, and match-3+bonus.\n\n[[File:An Post National Lottery.png|thumb|right|The National Lottery's [[corporate logo]] from the late 1990s\u2013 2008. The original 1987 logo was similar, but with the text \"National Lottery\" in a [[serif]] font however (with the word \"National\" in mixed case), and the boxes were not rounded. [http://www.lotto.ie/Global/Booklets/Lottery_Corporate_Identity.pdf] ]]\nLotto became a 6/42 game on 24 September 1994, which made the jackpot odds 1 in 5,245,786. The National Lottery made this change to generate bigger rollover jackpots, partly so that people living near the border with [[Northern Ireland]] would not abandon Lotto when the 6/49 [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|British National Lottery]] began operations on 14 November 1994. At the same time, the National Lottery introduced computer-generated \"quick picks\" as an alternative to marking numbers on paper playslips. Some retailers now only offer the quick-pick option.\n\nFor draws beginning on 26 September 1998, the National Lottery increased the cost of a line of Lotto from [[Irish pound|\u00a3]]0.50 to [[Irish pound|\u00a3]]0.75. At this time it also doubled the game's starting jackpot to [[Irish pound|\u00a3]]1 million and increased most of the game's smaller prizes by 50 percent.\n\nWith the introduction of the [[euro]] currency on 1 January 2002, the cost of a line of Lotto became \u20ac0.95, and the starting jackpot became \u20ac1.269 million (the euro equivalent of [[Irish pound|\u00a3]]1 million). For draws beginning 1 September 2002, the price of Lotto was rounded to \u20ac1 per line, and the starting jackpot was raised slightly to \u20ac1.35 million.\n\nCore Lotto sales had declined steadily for six consecutive years up to 2006, falling from \u20ac314.9 million in 2000 to \u20ac255.1 million in 2006. Falling sales partly reflected public dissatisfaction with the game during the [[Celtic Tiger]] economic boom.

It made the starting jackpot a guaranteed \u20ac2 million, increased the match-5+bonus prize from \u20ac12,000 to \u20ac25,000, introduced a match-3 prize of \u20ac5, and increased the price of a line of Lotto from \u20ac1 to \u20ac1.50. The company said that the structural changes were designed to produce about twenty Lotto jackpots of \u20ac5 million and over each year, and at least one jackpot over \u20ac10 million. The first 6/45 draw was held on 4 November 2006.\n\nThe odds of winning (in a 6/45 lottery) the Lotto jackpot are 1 in 8,145,060.

For an extra [[Irish pound|\u00a3]]0.25 per line, players could enter their Lotto numbers in an additional 6/42 drawing for a fixed, non-rolling jackpot of [[Irish pound|\u00a3]]250,000. The first Lotto Plus drawing took place on 25 October 2000.\n\nIn 2002, the National Lottery added a second Lotto Plus drawing, renamed the drawings '''Lotto Plus 1''' and '''Lotto Plus 2,''' and raised the cost of Lotto Plus to \u20ac0.50 per line. The jackpots were fixed at \u20ac300,000 and \u20ac200,000 respectively.  The first drawings for Lotto Plus 1 and Lotto Plus 2 took place on 1 September 2002.\n\nIn November 2006, when Lotto adopted a 6/45 matrix, the National Lottery raised the Lotto Plus 1 and Lotto Plus 2 jackpots to \u20ac350,000 and \u20ac250,000 respectively. The cost of Lotto Plus remained at \u20ac0.50 per line.\n\nIn September 2015, following the increase of two extra balls in the machine, the top prize of Lotto Plus 1 was doubled to \u20ac500,000.\n\nIn 2018, the top prize of Lotto Plus 1 was doubled to \u20ac1000000.\n\nA Lotto Plus raffle was also introduced. Every player that matches the 4 digit raffle number wins \u20ac300.\n\nAs with the main Lotto game, Lotto Plus players can win smaller cash prizes for match-5+bonus, match-5, match-4+bonus, match-4, and match-3+bonus. The odds of winning these prizes are the same as for the main Lotto game.\n\nOn 30 August 2018, Lotto Plus was enhanced with the first price rise in 18 years now costing \u20ac1 per line to enter. The raffle prize was increased to \u20ac500, with special \u20ac1 million raffle draws taking place at special points throughout the year.  They offered free Daily Million quick picks for matching 2 main numbers plus the bonus ball.  This meant that the odds were better at 1 in 10 at winning a prize.\n\nOver 90 percent of Lotto players play Lotto Plus.

It is currently a 6/47 lottery with an additional \"bonus ball.\" Its starting jackpot is a guaranteed \u20ac2 million, which rolls over until it is won. The minimum play in Lotto has always been two lines of six numbers each. At Lotto's current cost of \u20ac2 per line, a Lotto ticket costs a minimum of \u20ac4. Lotto has produced two spinoff games, Lotto 5-4-3-2-1, which began in 1997, and Lotto Plus, which began in 2000.<ref>http://www.lottery.ie/en/games/how-to-play/how-to-play-lotto/</ref>\n\nThe largest ever Lotto jackpot of \u20ac18.9 million was won on 28 June 2008 by a syndicate of 16 colleagues at a quarry and concrete plant in Bennekerry, [[Carlow]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/gold-strike-for-quarry-team-26458568.html | work=The Irish Independent | title=Gold strike for quarry team | date=1 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nSales of Lotto fell from \u20ac379.1 million in 2011 to \u20ac339.7 million in 2012. The National Lottery said that this reflected lower jackpot levels during the year.<ref name=\"2012 Report\"/>\n\n====History of Lotto====\n{{Refimprove|section|date=May 2019}}\nThe first Lotto drawing was held on Saturday, 16 April 1988. In its original 6/36 format, six numbered balls were drawn from a [[lottery machine]] containing 36 balls. Players could win a share of a guaranteed [[Irish pound|\u00a3]]250,000 jackpot by matching all six numbers, or win smaller prizes by matching four or five numbers. If no winning ticket was sold, the jackpot rolled over for the next draw. Drawings continued each Saturday night until 30 May 1990, when the National Lottery introduced a midweek Lotto draw on Wednesday nights. Lotto draws have been held twice weekly since that time. The Lotto for Saturday if Christmas Day is falling on Saturday transferred to Christmas Eve, Friday or Wednesday draw to Tuesday (1991-2002) or Thursday in 2013. \n\nIn a 6/36 lottery, the odds of matching all six numbers and winning the jackpot are 1 in 1,947,792. At Lotto's initial cost of [[Irish pound|\u00a3]]0.50 per line, all possible combinations could be purchased for [[Irish pound|\u00a3]]973,896. This left Lotto vulnerable to a [[brute force attack]], which happened when the jackpot reached [[Irish pound|\u00a3]]1.7 million for the May 1992 [[bank holiday]] drawing. A 28-member [[Dublin]]-based syndicate, organized and headed by Polish-Irish businessman Stefan Klincewicz, had spent six months preparing by marking combinations on almost a quarter of a million paper playslips. In the days before the drawing they tried to buy up all possible combinations and thus win all possible prizes, including the jackpot.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/how-to-make-a-killing-on-the-lottery-1322272.html | work=The Independent | title=How to make a killing on the lottery | date=4 January 1996}}</ref>\n\nThe National Lottery tried to foil Klincewicz's plan by limiting the number of tickets any single machine could sell, and by turning off the terminals his ticket purchasers were known to be using heavily. Despite its efforts, the syndicate did manage to buy over 80 percent of the combinations, spending an estimated [[Irish pound|\u00a3]]820,000 on tickets. It had the winning numbers on the night, but two other winning tickets were also sold, so the syndicate could claim only one-third of the jackpot, or [[Irish pound|\u00a3]]568,682. Match-5 and match-4 prizes brought the syndicate's total winnings to approximately [[Irish pound|\u00a3]]1,166,000, representing a profit of approximately [[Irish pound|\u00a3]]310,000 before expenses. Klincewicz later appeared on the television talk show ''[[Kenny Live]]'' and wrote a self-published lottery-system book entitled ''Win the Lotto.''\n\nTo prevent such a brute force attack from happening again, the National Lottery changed Lotto to a 6/39 game later in 1992, raising the jackpot odds to 1 in 3,262,623. The first Lotto 6/39 drawing was held on 22 August 1992. To compensate for the longer jackpot odds, the National Lottery doubled the starting jackpot to  and added a \"bonus number\" to the drawings. Whereas players previously needed either a match-6, match-5, or match-4 to win, prizes were now also awarded for match-5+bonus, match-4+bonus, and match-3+bonus.\n\n[[File:An Post National Lottery.png|thumb|right|The National Lottery's [[corporate logo]] from the late 1990s\u2013 2008. The original 1987 logo was similar, but with the text \"National Lottery\" in a [[serif]] font however (with the word \"National\" in mixed case), and the boxes were not rounded. [http://www.lotto.ie/Global/Booklets/Lottery_Corporate_Identity.pdf] ]]\nLotto became a 6/42 game on 24 September 1994, which made the jackpot odds 1 in 5,245,786. The National Lottery made this change to generate bigger rollover jackpots, partly so that people living near the border with [[Northern Ireland]] would not abandon Lotto when the 6/49 [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|British National Lottery]] began operations on 14 November 1994. At the same time, the National Lottery introduced computer-generated \"quick picks\" as an alternative to marking numbers on paper playslips. Some retailers now only offer the quick-pick option.\n\nFor draws beginning on 26 September 1998, the National Lottery increased the cost of a line of Lotto from [[Irish pound|\u00a3]]0.50 to [[Irish pound|\u00a3]]0.75. At this time it also doubled the game's starting jackpot to [[Irish pound|\u00a3]]1 million and increased most of the game's smaller prizes by 50 percent.\n\nWith the introduction of the [[euro]] currency on 1 January 2002, the cost of a line of Lotto became \u20ac0.95, and the starting jackpot became \u20ac1.269 million (the euro equivalent of [[Irish pound|\u00a3]]1 million). For draws beginning 1 September 2002, the price of Lotto was rounded to \u20ac1 per line, and the starting jackpot was raised slightly to \u20ac1.35 million.\n\nCore Lotto sales had declined steadily for six consecutive years up to 2006, falling from \u20ac314.9 million in 2000 to \u20ac255.1 million in 2006. Falling sales partly reflected public dissatisfaction with the game during the [[Celtic Tiger]] economic boom. As property prices and the cost of living escalated rapidly, particularly in [[Dublin]], a \u20ac1.35 million starting jackpot was no longer seen as offering the transformed lifestyle promoted in lottery advertising.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/6115162.stm | work=BBC News | title=When a million is not enough cash | date=6 November 2006}}</ref> In November 2006, the National Lottery changed Lotto to a 6/45 game to create bigger jackpots and combat falling ticket sales. It made the starting jackpot a guaranteed \u20ac2 million, increased the match-5+bonus prize from \u20ac12,000 to \u20ac25,000, introduced a match-3 prize of \u20ac5, and increased the price of a line of Lotto from \u20ac1 to \u20ac1.50. The company said that the structural changes were designed to produce about twenty Lotto jackpots of \u20ac5 million and over each year, and at least one jackpot over \u20ac10 million. The first 6/45 draw was held on 4 November 2006.\n\nThe odds of winning (in a 6/45 lottery) the Lotto jackpot are 1 in 8,145,060.  The odds of getting a match-5+bonus are 1 in 1,357,510; the odds of a match-5 are 1 in 1,221,759; the odds of a match 4+bonus are 1 in 14,290; the odds of a match-4 are 1 in 148,995; the odds of a match-3+bonus are 1 in 579; and the odds of a match-3 are 1 in 14,190.\n\nThe Wednesday night Lotto draw on 4 February 2015 was postponed until the following night due to a technical problem with ticket machines. This marked the first time in Lotto history that a drawing was postponed.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2015/0204/677849-lottery/ | publisher=RT\u00c9 News | title=One winner of \u20ac10m Lotto jackpot | date=5 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.evoke.ie/news/lotto-machines-not-working/|work=evoke.ie | title= \u20ac10 million jackpot draw cancelled after Lotto machines stop working| date=4 February 2015}}</ref>.\n\nAs of 3 September 2015, the cost of buying two lines increased from \u20ac3 to \u20ac4 and players must now choose from 47 instead of 45 numbers, lengthening the odds of winning the jackpot to almost 11 million (approximately 10.7 million) to one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/lottery-prices-odds-2257544-Aug2015/|title=The Lotto\u2019s about to get more expensive \u2013 and you\u2019ll have less of a chance of winning|date=7 August 2015|work=The Journal|accessdate=7 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2015/0807/719698-national-lottery/|title=Price increase and worse odds for lottery|date=7 August 2015|work=RT\u00c9 News|accessdate=7 August 2015}}</ref> The odds against winning the second prize have increased also, but so too has the prize value, from \u20ac25,000 to an estimated \u20ac100,000.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cost Of Lottery Ticket To Rise By A Euro|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/lotto-cost-of-buying-lottery-ticket-to-rise-by-a-euro-31434040.html|publisher=Irish Independent}}</ref> There will also be a new prize for matching 2 balls and the bonus ball.\n\nThe current odds of winning (in a 6/47 lottery) are: Jackpot - 1 in 10,737,573; match 5 - 1 in 1,533,939; match 4 - 1 in 178,365; match 3 - 1 in 16,215.\n\n===Lotto Plus===\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2019}}\nIn 2000, the National Lottery introduced Lotto Plus as an add-on to the main Lotto game. For an extra [[Irish pound|\u00a3]]0.25 per line, players could enter their Lotto numbers in an additional 6/42 drawing for a fixed, non-rolling jackpot of [[Irish pound|\u00a3]]250,000. The first Lotto Plus drawing took place on 25 October 2000.\n\nIn 2002, the National Lottery added a second Lotto Plus drawing, renamed the drawings '''Lotto Plus 1''' and '''Lotto Plus 2,''' and raised the cost of Lotto Plus to \u20ac0.50 per line. The jackpots were fixed at \u20ac300,000 and \u20ac200,000 respectively.  The first drawings for Lotto Plus 1 and Lotto Plus 2 took place on 1 September 2002.\n\nIn November 2006, when Lotto adopted a 6/45 matrix, the National Lottery raised the Lotto Plus 1 and Lotto Plus 2 jackpots to \u20ac350,000 and \u20ac250,000 respectively. The cost of Lotto Plus remained at \u20ac0.50 per line.\n\nIn September 2015, following the increase of two extra balls in the machine, the top prize of Lotto Plus 1 was doubled to \u20ac500,000.\n\nIn 2018, the top prize of Lotto Plus 1 was doubled to \u20ac1000000.\n\nA Lotto Plus raffle was also introduced. Every player that matches the 4 digit raffle number wins \u20ac300.\n\nAs with the main Lotto game, Lotto Plus players can win smaller cash prizes for match-5+bonus, match-5, match-4+bonus, match-4, and match-3+bonus. The odds of winning these prizes are the same as for the main Lotto game.\n\nOn 30 August 2018, Lotto Plus was enhanced with the first price rise in 18 years now costing \u20ac1 per line to enter. The raffle prize was increased to \u20ac500, with special \u20ac1 million raffle draws taking place at special points throughout the year.  They offered free Daily Million quick picks for matching 2 main numbers plus the bonus ball.  This meant that the odds were better at 1 in 10 at winning a prize.\n\nOver 90 percent of Lotto players play Lotto Plus. Sales of Lotto Plus in 2012 were \u20ac74.3 million.<ref name=\"2012 Report\"/>\n\n[[File:Lotto 54321.png|right|thumb|Lotto 5-4-3-2-1 logo in use from 2008 onwards]]\n\n===Lotto 5-4-3-2-1===\nBased around the main Lotto draw, Lotto 5-4-3-2-1 was introduced in February 1997. It allows players to win prizes by correctly matching one, two, three, four, or five of the drawn numbers. The more numbers players try to match, the greater the prize. Players may base their choices either on a six-number game (excluding the bonus number) or on a seven-number game (including the bonus number).

A 6/39 weekly lottery drawing with a fixed, non-rolling jackpot of \u20ac1 million, Daily Million takes place every day of the week, including weekends and bank holidays.

Contestants gain entry to the shows by getting three \"lucky stars\" on associated scratchcards and submitting them in special envelopes for televised drawings. Broadcast on Saturday nights on [[RT\u00c9 One]] since 1990, the game shows have proven very popular, often featuring among the channel's top-rated programmes.\n\nThe National Lottery's flagship game show ''[[Winning Streak]]'' debuted in 1990 and screens weekly between September and early June. A summer companion programme ''[[Fame and Fortune (television)|Fame & Fortune]]'' was launched in 1996 and ran through the months of June, July, and August until 2007. It was replaced in 2007 by ''[[The Trump Card]]'', which was replaced in turn by ''[[The Big Money Game]]'', which was replaced by ''The Million Euro Challenge''.\n\n==References in other media==\nIn the 1990s, RT\u00c9 produced a sitcom called ''[[Upwardly Mobile]]'' about a working-class family who won the Lotto and moved to an upper-middle-class area.
