Beacon chains suffered the drawback that they could only pass a single bit of information, so the meaning of the message such as \"the enemy has been sighted\" had to be agreed upon in advance. One notable instance of their use was during the [[Spanish Armada]], when a beacon chain relayed a signal from [[Plymouth]] to London that signaled the arrival of the Spanish warships.<ref>David Ross, [http://www.britainexpress.com/History/tudor/armada.htm The Spanish Armada], Britain Express, October 2008.</ref>\n\nFrench engineer [[Claude Chappe]] began working on visual telegraphy in 1790, using pairs of \"clocks\" whose hands pointed at different symbols. These did not prove quite viable at long distances, and Chappe revised his model to use two sets of jointed wooden beams. Operators moved the beams using cranks and wires.<ref>Wenzlhuemer, ''Connecting the Nineteenth-Century World'' (2013), pp. 63\u201364.</ref> He built his first [[semaphore line|telegraph line]] between [[Lille]] and [[Paris]], followed by a line from [[Strasbourg]] to Paris.

Thus, messages could be conveyed electrically up to a few kilometers (in von S\u00f6mmerring's design), with each of the telegraph receiver's wires immersed in a separate glass tube of acid. An electric current was sequentially applied by the sender through the various wires representing each digit of a message; at the recipient's end the currents electrolysed the acid in the tubes in sequence, releasing streams of hydrogen bubbles next to each associated letter or numeral. The telegraph receiver's operator would visually observe the bubbles and could then record the transmitted message, albeit at a very low [[baud]] rate.<ref name=\"Harvard1\">Jones, R.

The concept of videotelephony was first popularized in the late 1870s in both the United States and Europe, although the basic sciences to permit its very earliest trials would take nearly a half century to be discovered. This was first embodied in the device which came to be known as the [[Videophone|video telephone]], or videophone, and it evolved from intensive research and experimentation in several telecommunication fields, notably [[electrical telegraphy]], [[telephony]], [[radio]], and [[television]].\n\nThe development of the crucial video technology first started in the latter half of the 1920s in the United Kingdom and the United States, spurred notably by [[John Logie Baird]] and [[Bell Labs|AT&T's Bell Labs]]. This occurred in part, at least by AT&T, to serve as an adjunct supplementing the use of the telephone. A number of organizations believed that videotelephony would be superior to plain voice communications. However video technology was to be deployed in [[Analog television|analog]] [[television broadcasting]] long before it could become practical\u2014or popular\u2014for videophones.\n\nVideotelephony developed in parallel with conventional [[Public switched telephone network|voice telephone systems]] from the mid-to-late 20th century. Only in the late 20th century with the advent of  powerful [[video codec]]s and [[Internet access|high-speed broadband]] did it become a practical technology for regular use. With the rapid improvements and popularity of the Internet, it became widespread through the use of [[videoconferencing]] and [[webcam]]s, which frequently utilize [[Voice over IP|Internet telephony]], and in business, where [[telepresence|telepresence technology]] has helped reduce the need to travel.\n\nPractical digital videotelephony was only made possible with advances in [[video compression]], due to the impractically high bandwidth requirements of [[uncompressed video]]. To achieve [[Video Graphics Array]] (VGA) quality video ([[480p]] resolution and [[256 colors]]) with raw uncompressed video, it would require a bandwidth of over 92{{nbsp}}[[Mbps]].<ref name=\"Belmudez\">{{cite book |last1=Belmudez |first1=Benjamin |title=Audiovisual Quality Assessment and Prediction for Videotelephony |date=2014 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783319141664 |pages=11\u201313 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ULTzBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA13}}</ref> The most important compression technique that enabled practical digital videotelephony and videoconferencing is the [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT).<ref name=\"Belmudez\"/><ref name=\"Huang\">{{cite book |last1=Huang |first1=Hsiang-Cheh |last2=Fang |first2=Wai-Chi |title=Intelligent Multimedia Data Hiding: New Directions |date=2007 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783540711698 |page=41 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=67W5BQAAQBAJ&pg=PA41}}</ref> The DCT, a form of [[lossy compression]], was first proposed by [[N.

It was used to send a Christmas greeting to the world from U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. In 1960 [[NASA]] launched an [[Echo satellite]]; the {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} aluminized [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]] balloon served as a passive reflector for radio communications.  [[Courier 1B]], built by [[Philco]], also launched in 1960, was the world's first active repeater satellite. Satellites these days are used for many applications such as GPS, television, internet and telephone.\n\n[[Telstar]] was the first active, direct relay commercial [[communications satellite]]. Belonging to [[American Telephone & Telegraph Company|AT&T]] as part of a multi-national agreement between AT&T, [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]], NASA, the British [[General Post Office (United Kingdom)|General Post Office]], and the [[Orange S.A.|French National PTT]] (Post Office) to develop satellite communications, it was launched by NASA from [[Cape Canaveral]] on July 10, 1962, the first privately sponsored space launch. [[Relay 1]] was launched on December 13, 1962, and became the first satellite to broadcast across the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] on November 22, 1963.<ref name=\"NASA-SP-93\">{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19660009169_1966009169.pdf|title=Significant Achievements in Space Communications and Navigation, 1958-1964|year=1966|work=NASA-SP-93|publisher=NASA|pages=30\u201332|accessdate=2009-10-31}}</ref>\n\nThe first and historically most important application for communication satellites was in intercontinental [[long distance telephony]]. The fixed [[Public Switched Telephone Network]] relays [[telephone call]]s from [[land line]] telephones to an [[earth station]], where they are then transmitted a receiving [[satellite dish]] via a [[geostationary satellite]] in Earth orbit.  Improvements in [[submarine communications cable]]s, through the use of [[fiber-optics]], caused some decline in the use of satellites for fixed telephony in the late 20th century, but they still exclusively service remote islands such as [[Ascension Island]], [[Saint Helena]], [[Diego Garcia]], and [[Easter Island]], where no submarine cables are in service. There are also some continents and some regions of countries where landline telecommunications are rare to nonexistent, for example [[Antarctica]], plus large regions of [[Australia]], [[South America]], [[Africa]], [[Northern Canada]], [[China]], [[Russia]] and [[Greenland]].\n\nAfter commercial long distance telephone service was established via communication satellites, a host of other commercial telecommunications were also adapted to similar satellites starting in 1979, including [[satellite phone|mobile satellite phones]], [[satellite radio]], [[satellite television]] and [[satellite Internet access]]. The earliest adaption for most such services occurred in the 1990s as the pricing for commercial [[Transponder (satellite communications)|satellite transponder channels]] continued to drop significantly.\n\nRealization and demonstration, on October 29, 2001, of the first [[digital cinema]] transmission by [[communications satellite|satellite]] in [[Europe]]<ref>[[France T\u00e9l\u00e9com]], Commission Sup\u00e9rieure Technique de l'Image et du Son, ''Communiqu\u00e9 de presse'', Paris, October 29th, 2001.</ref><ref>[http://www.passeursdimages.fr/IMG/pdf/projections13.pdf \u00abNum\u00e9rique : le cin\u00e9ma en mutation\u00bb, ''Projections'', '''13''', CNC, Paris, September 2004, p. 7.]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=JhLwPrW8pggC&printsec=frontcover&dq=olivier+bomsel+mines&hl=fr&sa=X&ei=hKGhUqllpOzSBdulgcgL&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=olivier%20bomsel%20mines&f=false Olivier Bomsel, Gilles Le Blanc, ''Dernier tango argentique.

However it was not until the 1960s that researchers started to investigate [[packet switching]] a technology that would allow chunks of data to be sent to different computers  without first passing through a centralized mainframe. A four-node network emerged on December 5, 1969 between the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], the [[Stanford Research Institute]], the [[University of Utah]] and the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]. This network would become [[ARPANET]], which by 1981 would consist of 213 nodes.<ref>{{cite book | last = Hafner | first =  Katie  | title = Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet | publisher = Simon & Schuster | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-684-83267-4 }}</ref> In June 1973, the first non-US node was added to the network belonging to [[Norway]]'s NORSAR project.

This process is important because ARPANET would eventually merge with other networks to form the [[Internet]] and many of the protocols the Internet relies upon today were specified through this process. The first [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) specification, {{IETF RFC|675}} (''Specification of Internet Transmission Control Program''), was written by Vinton Cerf, [[Yogen Dalal]], and Carl Sunshine, and published in December 1974. It coined the term \"Internet\" as a shorthand for internetworking.<ref>[[Vint Cerf|Cerf, Vinton]]; [[Yogen Dalal|Dalal, Yogen]]; Sunshine, Carl (December 1974), {{IETF RFC|675}}, ''Specification of Internet Transmission Control Protocol''</ref> In September 1981, RFC 791 introduced the [[Internet Protocol]] v4 (IPv4). This established the [[TCP/IP]] protocol, which much of the Internet relies upon today. A more relaxed transport protocol that, unlike TCP, did not guarantee the orderly delivery of packets called the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) was submitted on 28 August 1980 as RFC 768. An e-mail protocol, [[SMTP]], was introduced in August 1982 by RFC 821 and [[HTTP|http://1.0{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}]] a protocol that would make the hyperlinked Internet possible was introduced on May 1996 by RFC 1945.\n\nHowever, not all important developments were made through the [[Request for Comment]] process. Two popular link protocols for [[local area network]]s (LANs) also appeared in the 1970s. A patent for the [[IBM token ring|Token Ring]] protocol was filed by Olof S\u00f6derblom on October 29, 1974.<ref>[http://patft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=4293948.PN.&OS=PN/4293948&RS=PN/4293948  Data transmission system], Olof Soderblom, PN 4,293,948, October 1974.</ref> And a paper on the [[Ethernet]] protocol was published by [[Robert Metcalfe]] and [[David Boggs]] in the July 1976 issue of ''[[Communications of the ACM]]''.<ref>[http://www.acm.org/classics/apr96/ Ethernet: Distributed Packet Switching for Local Computer Networks] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807213308/http://www.acm.org/classics/apr96/ |date=2007-08-07 }}, Robert M.

Thus, messages could be conveyed electrically up to a few kilometers (in von S\u00f6mmerring's design), with each of the telegraph receiver's wires immersed in a separate glass tube of acid. An electric current was sequentially applied by the sender through the various wires representing each digit of a message; at the recipient's end the currents electrolysed the acid in the tubes in sequence, releasing streams of hydrogen bubbles next to each associated letter or numeral. The telegraph receiver's operator would visually observe the bubbles and could then record the transmitted message, albeit at a very low [[baud]] rate.<ref name=\"Harvard1\">Jones, R.

[[Alfred Vail]] saw this demonstration and joined Morse to develop the register\u2014a telegraph terminal that integrated a logging device for recording messages to paper tape.

The concept of videotelephony was first popularized in the late 1870s in both the United States and Europe, although the basic sciences to permit its very earliest trials would take nearly a half century to be discovered. This was first embodied in the device which came to be known as the [[Videophone|video telephone]], or videophone, and it evolved from intensive research and experimentation in several telecommunication fields, notably [[electrical telegraphy]], [[telephony]], [[radio]], and [[television]].\n\nThe development of the crucial video technology first started in the latter half of the 1920s in the United Kingdom and the United States, spurred notably by [[John Logie Baird]] and [[Bell Labs|AT&T's Bell Labs]]. This occurred in part, at least by AT&T, to serve as an adjunct supplementing the use of the telephone. A number of organizations believed that videotelephony would be superior to plain voice communications. However video technology was to be deployed in [[Analog television|analog]] [[television broadcasting]] long before it could become practical\u2014or popular\u2014for videophones.\n\nVideotelephony developed in parallel with conventional [[Public switched telephone network|voice telephone systems]] from the mid-to-late 20th century. Only in the late 20th century with the advent of  powerful [[video codec]]s and [[Internet access|high-speed broadband]] did it become a practical technology for regular use. With the rapid improvements and popularity of the Internet, it became widespread through the use of [[videoconferencing]] and [[webcam]]s, which frequently utilize [[Voice over IP|Internet telephony]], and in business, where [[telepresence|telepresence technology]] has helped reduce the need to travel.\n\nPractical digital videotelephony was only made possible with advances in [[video compression]], due to the impractically high bandwidth requirements of [[uncompressed video]]. To achieve [[Video Graphics Array]] (VGA) quality video ([[480p]] resolution and [[256 colors]]) with raw uncompressed video, it would require a bandwidth of over 92{{nbsp}}[[Mbps]].<ref name=\"Belmudez\">{{cite book |last1=Belmudez |first1=Benjamin |title=Audiovisual Quality Assessment and Prediction for Videotelephony |date=2014 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783319141664 |pages=11\u201313 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ULTzBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA13}}</ref> The most important compression technique that enabled practical digital videotelephony and videoconferencing is the [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT).<ref name=\"Belmudez\"/><ref name=\"Huang\">{{cite book |last1=Huang |first1=Hsiang-Cheh |last2=Fang |first2=Wai-Chi |title=Intelligent Multimedia Data Hiding: New Directions |date=2007 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783540711698 |page=41 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=67W5BQAAQBAJ&pg=PA41}}</ref> The DCT, a form of [[lossy compression]], was first proposed by [[N.

It was used to send a Christmas greeting to the world from U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. In 1960 [[NASA]] launched an [[Echo satellite]]; the {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} aluminized [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]] balloon served as a passive reflector for radio communications.  [[Courier 1B]], built by [[Philco]], also launched in 1960, was the world's first active repeater satellite. Satellites these days are used for many applications such as GPS, television, internet and telephone.\n\n[[Telstar]] was the first active, direct relay commercial [[communications satellite]]. Belonging to [[American Telephone & Telegraph Company|AT&T]] as part of a multi-national agreement between AT&T, [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]], NASA, the British [[General Post Office (United Kingdom)|General Post Office]], and the [[Orange S.A.|French National PTT]] (Post Office) to develop satellite communications, it was launched by NASA from [[Cape Canaveral]] on July 10, 1962, the first privately sponsored space launch.

The fixed [[Public Switched Telephone Network]] relays [[telephone call]]s from [[land line]] telephones to an [[earth station]], where they are then transmitted a receiving [[satellite dish]] via a [[geostationary satellite]] in Earth orbit.  Improvements in [[submarine communications cable]]s, through the use of [[fiber-optics]], caused some decline in the use of satellites for fixed telephony in the late 20th century, but they still exclusively service remote islands such as [[Ascension Island]], [[Saint Helena]], [[Diego Garcia]], and [[Easter Island]], where no submarine cables are in service. There are also some continents and some regions of countries where landline telecommunications are rare to nonexistent, for example [[Antarctica]], plus large regions of [[Australia]], [[South America]], [[Africa]], [[Northern Canada]], [[China]], [[Russia]] and [[Greenland]].\n\nAfter commercial long distance telephone service was established via communication satellites, a host of other commercial telecommunications were also adapted to similar satellites starting in 1979, including [[satellite phone|mobile satellite phones]], [[satellite radio]], [[satellite television]] and [[satellite Internet access]]. The earliest adaption for most such services occurred in the 1990s as the pricing for commercial [[Transponder (satellite communications)|satellite transponder channels]] continued to drop significantly.\n\nRealization and demonstration, on October 29, 2001, of the first [[digital cinema]] transmission by [[communications satellite|satellite]] in [[Europe]]<ref>[[France T\u00e9l\u00e9com]], Commission Sup\u00e9rieure Technique de l'Image et du Son, ''Communiqu\u00e9 de presse'', Paris, October 29th, 2001.</ref><ref>[http://www.passeursdimages.fr/IMG/pdf/projections13.pdf \u00abNum\u00e9rique : le cin\u00e9ma en mutation\u00bb, ''Projections'', '''13''', CNC, Paris, September 2004, p. 7.]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=JhLwPrW8pggC&printsec=frontcover&dq=olivier+bomsel+mines&hl=fr&sa=X&ei=hKGhUqllpOzSBdulgcgL&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=olivier%20bomsel%20mines&f=false Olivier Bomsel, Gilles Le Blanc, ''Dernier tango argentique.

However it was not until the 1960s that researchers started to investigate [[packet switching]] a technology that would allow chunks of data to be sent to different computers  without first passing through a centralized mainframe. A four-node network emerged on December 5, 1969 between the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], the [[Stanford Research Institute]], the [[University of Utah]] and the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]. This network would become [[ARPANET]], which by 1981 would consist of 213 nodes.<ref>{{cite book | last = Hafner | first =  Katie  | title = Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet | publisher = Simon & Schuster | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-684-83267-4 }}</ref> In June 1973, the first non-US node was added to the network belonging to [[Norway]]'s NORSAR project.

This process is important because ARPANET would eventually merge with other networks to form the [[Internet]] and many of the protocols the Internet relies upon today were specified through this process. The first [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) specification, {{IETF RFC|675}} (''Specification of Internet Transmission Control Program''), was written by Vinton Cerf, [[Yogen Dalal]], and Carl Sunshine, and published in December 1974. It coined the term \"Internet\" as a shorthand for internetworking.<ref>[[Vint Cerf|Cerf, Vinton]]; [[Yogen Dalal|Dalal, Yogen]]; Sunshine, Carl (December 1974), {{IETF RFC|675}}, ''Specification of Internet Transmission Control Protocol''</ref> In September 1981, RFC 791 introduced the [[Internet Protocol]] v4 (IPv4). This established the [[TCP/IP]] protocol, which much of the Internet relies upon today. A more relaxed transport protocol that, unlike TCP, did not guarantee the orderly delivery of packets called the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) was submitted on 28 August 1980 as RFC 768. An e-mail protocol, [[SMTP]], was introduced in August 1982 by RFC 821 and [[HTTP|http://1.0{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}]] a protocol that would make the hyperlinked Internet possible was introduced on May 1996 by RFC 1945.\n\nHowever, not all important developments were made through the [[Request for Comment]] process. Two popular link protocols for [[local area network]]s (LANs) also appeared in the 1970s. A patent for the [[IBM token ring|Token Ring]] protocol was filed by Olof S\u00f6derblom on October 29, 1974.<ref>[http://patft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=4293948.PN.&OS=PN/4293948&RS=PN/4293948  Data transmission system], Olof Soderblom, PN 4,293,948, October 1974.</ref> And a paper on the [[Ethernet]] protocol was published by [[Robert Metcalfe]] and [[David Boggs]] in the July 1976 issue of ''[[Communications of the ACM]]''.<ref>[http://www.acm.org/classics/apr96/ Ethernet: Distributed Packet Switching for Local Computer Networks] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807213308/http://www.acm.org/classics/apr96/ |date=2007-08-07 }}, Robert M.

Darwin was young and generally in good health, though six months previously he had been ill for a month near [[Valparaiso]], but in 1837, almost a year after he returned to England, he began to suffer intermittently from a strange group of [[symptom]]s, becoming incapacitated for much of the rest of his life.

Visiting rules and times vary and international visitors have some special privileges. Different days are allocated to certain cell blocks. Weekend visits are typically prohibited. Additional privileges (e.g., phones, longer visits) when visiting foreign prisoners can sometimes be attained with a letter from the appropriate embassy or with [[bribe]]s to prison guards. Food for prisoners can be purchased at the commissary by completing a form listing the items to be purchased and the prisoner's name. After paying for the items, the order is generally delivered that evening or the next day.{{CN|date=December 2019}}\n\nAs of October 2018, prisoners are normally held in Bangkok Remand Prison until sentencing.

In 1972 the Interior Ministry issued orders establishing the prison on Maha Chai Road as the \"Bangkok Remand Prison\" and the prison in the Lat Yao Subdistrict was designated the \"Klong Prem Central Prison\".<ref name=\"phaseloop\"/>\n\n==Visiting Klong Prem==\nKlong Prem Central Prison allows the families and pre-registered guests of inmates to visit prisoners. Visiting rules and times vary and international visitors have some special privileges. Different days are allocated to certain cell blocks. Weekend visits are typically prohibited. Additional privileges (e.g., phones, longer visits) when visiting foreign prisoners can sometimes be attained with a letter from the appropriate embassy or with [[bribe]]s to prison guards. Food for prisoners can be purchased at the commissary by completing a form listing the items to be purchased and the prisoner's name. After paying for the items, the order is generally delivered that evening or the next day.{{CN|date=December 2019}}\n\nAs of October 2018, prisoners are normally held in Bangkok Remand Prison until sentencing. After sentencing, they may be sent to either the main prison, Bambat Phiset (for drugs offences), or complete their sentence in Bangkok Remand Prison. In Bangkok Remand Prison there are eight buildings in which prisoners may be held.\n\n==Prison World Cup==\nWith the large number of foreign nationals at Klong Prem, the prison is able to hold a [[association football|football]] World Cup.<ref name=\"Prison_World_Cup\"/> Teams of 10 are chosen by prison staff to represent Nigeria, Japan, the US, Italy, France, England, Germany, and Thailand.<ref name=\"Prison_World_Cup\"/> Games consist of two 20-minute halves on a half-sized pitch. The winners are given a replica of the real [[FIFA World Cup Trophy|World Cup trophy]], which is made of wood in the prison workshop.<ref name=\"Prison_World_Cup\"/>\n\n==Current and former notable prisoners==\nForeign prisoners are concentrated in Building 2, and those prisoners may have contact visits for several days providing visitors can demonstrate they have traveled from another country. As of June 2010, there are many foreign prisoners in other buildings of the prison complex.\n\n* Jon Cole, American heroin smuggler.

He mostly creates music in the [[Minimalist music|minimalist]] & [[synthpop|synth]] genre. In late 2010, Woxlin, became the [[editor-in-chief]] and board member at [[Dalarnas F\u00f6rfattarf\u00f6rbund]] (''The Dalecarlean Authors Society of Sweden'').<ref>{{cite news\n| url = http://www.dalademokraten.se/sida/id/148260/\t \n| title = Ny chefredakt\u00f6r f\u00f6r Dalarnas f\u00f6rfattarf\u00f6rbund \t \n| accessdate = 2010-12-14 \t \n| publisher = Dala Demokraten\n| date = 2010-12-14\n}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite news\n| url = http://www.dalarnasforfattarforbund.se/dalapennan/\t \n| title = Dalarnas F\u00f6rfattarf\u00f6rbund \t \n| accessdate = 2013-03-25 \t \n| publisher = Dalarnas F\u00f6rfattarf\u00f6rbund\n| year = 2012\n}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite news\n| url = http://www.dt.se/kultur/ny-ordforande-i-dalarnas-forfattarforbund \n| title = Ny ordf\u00f6rande i Dalarnas F\u00f6rfattarf\u00f6rbund\n| accessdate = 2016-04-11 \t \n| publisher = Dalarnas Tidningar\n| date = 2016-03-31\n}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nHe started out as a solo pianist in 1994 (then 6 years old) playing at different events and later he started to take piano lessons. Later he became a part of Super Synth Farmacia, a group which made songs on computers and toy keyboards, later in 2002 they disbanded. He was also a member in a music collective called Borlange All-Stars. In 2006 Borlange All-Stars disbanded because they couldn't find anything more to express through their music. In 2008 he released his new solo album, ''Reality After Midnight'', after working with it for almost one year; it was later released on [[iTunes]]. The last single of the album, Devil May Care, featured [[Tess Gaerth\u00e9|Tess]] and was released on [[Spotify]], 20 August 2009.\n\nAbout his work as a director he've commented that: \"''As a director you have to dignify the playwrights' script and also express your own artistic expression on the stage [...] and also not constrain the actors in their progress.''\"\n<ref name=\"P4 Dalarna Eftermiddag med Karin och Martin 2014-04-22\">{{cite news\n| url = http://sverigesradio.se/sida/avsnitt/355680?programid=4479\t \n| title = P4 Dalarna Eftermiddag \t \n| accessdate = 2014-04-23 \t \n| publisher = Sveriges Radio\n| date = 2014-04-22\n}}</ref>\n\n===Sywnthkrawft===\nIn 2005 Woxlin decided to create the band Sywnthkrawft together with [[Gustav Jacobsson]], [[Viktor Jacobsson]] and [[Daniel Thyberg]]. Between 2005 and 2007, they released three albums and three singles.\n\nAlthough their initial sound was ambient inspired, Sywnthkrawft soon switched to a more instrumental [[synthpop]] influenced sound. They gained some success with the single, ''[[The Photographer's Exceptional Pictures for Body and Mind]]''. On 8 March 2007, it debuted on #1 on the Swedish chart Dalatoppen and held its position for 7 weeks. Their last album, ''[[Goodbye, Spaceblade|Goodbye, Spaceblade (Re-recorded)]]'', were released only weeks before they embarked on a hiatus even though a new album (SK3 - The Space Musical) were in production and planned for a 2008 release.\n\nWhile never formally breaking up, after ''Goodbye, Spaceblade (Re-recorded)'', Woxlin decided to concentrate on his solo project. As time went by Woxlin increasingly dismissed the possibility of reforming the band.<ref name=\"This years scriptwriter'\">{{cite news\n| url = http://www.dalademokraten.se/Noje/Nojesnyheter/56461\t \n| title = This years scriptwriter' \t \n| accessdate = 2008-04-15 \t \n| publisher = Dalademokraten\n| date = 2007-04-15\n}}</ref>\n\n===Writing career===\n\n====Mannen som fanns \u00f6verallt====\nIn February 2011, his first collection of haikupoems, \"[[Mannen som fanns \u00f6verallt]]\", was released.

The stated intent of the expedition was to recapture the [[Islam|Muslim]]-controlled city of [[Jerusalem]], by first conquering the powerful Egyptian [[Ayyubid Sultanate]], the strongest Muslim state of the time. However, a sequence of economic and political events culminated in the Crusader army's 1204 [[Sack of Constantinople]], the capital of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Christian]]-controlled [[Byzantine Empire]], rather than Egypt as originally planned.\n\nIn late 1202, financial issues led to the Crusader army conducting the [[Siege of Zara]], sacking the Catholic city of [[Zadar|Zara]] (Zadar) on the Adriatic Sea which was then brought under [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] control. When the pope heard of this, he excommunicated the Crusader army. In January 1203, en route to Jerusalem, the Crusader leadership entered into an agreement with the Byzantine prince [[Alexios IV Angelos|Alexios Angelos]] to divert the Crusade to [[Constantinople]] and restore his deposed father [[Isaac II Angelos]] as emperor. The intent of the Crusaders was then to continue to Jerusalem with promised Byzantine financial and military aid. On 23 June 1203, the main Crusader army reached Constantinople, while other contingents (perhaps a majority of all crusaders) continued to [[Acre (city)|Acre]]. \n\nIn August 1203, following the [[Siege of Constantinople (1203)|Siege of Constantinople]], Alexios was crowned co-emperor. However, in January 1204 he was deposed by a popular uprising. The Crusaders were no longer able to receive their promised payments from Alexios. Following the murder of Alexios on 8 February, the Crusaders decided on the outright conquest of the city. In April 1204, they captured and plundered the city's enormous wealth. Only a handful of the Crusaders continued to the Holy Land thereafter.\n\nThe conquest of Constantinople was followed by the fragmentation of the Byzantine Empire into three states centered in [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]], [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]] and [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]]. The Crusaders then founded several new Crusader states, known as ''[[Frankokratia]]'', in former Byzantine territory, largely hinged upon the [[Latin Empire of Constantinople]]. The presence of the Latin Crusader states almost immediately led to war with the [[Nicaean-Latin wars|Byzantine successor states]] and the [[Bulgarian-Latin wars|Bulgarian Empire]]. The Nicaean Empire eventually recovered Constantinople and restored the Byzantine Empire in 1261.\n\nThe Fourth Crusade is considered to have solidified the [[East-West Schism]], and dealt an irrevocable blow, contributing to the [[decline of the Byzantine Empire]], paving the way for Muslim conquests in Anatolia and the [[Balkans]] in the coming centuries.\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n== Background ==\n===Loss of Jerusalem to the truce of 1198===\nBetween 1174 and 1187, the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid sultan]] [[Saladin]] conquered most of the [[Crusader states]] in the Levant.  Jerusalem was lost to the Ayyubids following the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|Siege of Jerusalem]] in 1187.<ref>[[John Julius Norwich]], ''Byzantium: The Decline and Fall'', (1995; repr., London: Folio Society, 2003), 169</ref>  The Crusader states were then reduced by Saladin to little more than three cities along the sea coast: [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] and [[Antioch]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Hans Eberhard|last=Mayer|page=136|title=The Crusades|ISBN=0-19-873097-7}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Third Crusade]] (1189\u20131192) was launched in response to the fall of Jerusalem and with the goal of recovering it. It successfully reclaimed an extensive territory, effectively reestablishing the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. Although Jerusalem itself was not recovered, the important coastal towns of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] and [[Jaffa]] were. On 2 September 1192, the [[Treaty of Jaffa]] was signed with Saladin, bringing the crusade to an end. It was to last for three years and eight months.<ref name=Kedar>{{citation |author=[[Benjamin Z.

Laiou |title=Urbs Capta: The Fourth Crusade and its Consequences |location=Paris |year=2005 |pages=89\u2013101 |publisher=Lethielleux}}.</ref>\n\nThe crusade had also been marked by a significant escalation in long standing tensions between the feudal states of western Europe and the [[Byzantine Empire]].<ref>{{cite book| last = Haldon| first = John| title = Byzantium at War| publisher =Osprey| location= Oxford| year = 2002| pages=87}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last = Phillips| first = Jonathan| title = The Fourth Crusade and the Sack of Constantinople| url = https://archive.org/details/fourthcrusadesac00phil_0| url-access = registration| publisher =Viking| location= New York| year = 2004| page=[https://archive.org/details/fourthcrusadesac00phil_0/page/14 14]| isbn =978-0-14-303590-9}}</ref> During the crusade, [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor]], had almost besieged Constantinople because of the failure of the Byzantines to provide him with safe passage across the [[Dardanelles]]. The Byzantines for their part suspected him of conspiring with the breakaway Byzantine provinces of [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbia]] and [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]]. King [[Richard I of England]] also seized the breakaway Byzantine [[Theme of Cyprus|province of Cyprus]]. Rather than return it to the Empire, he sold the island to the [[Knights Templar]].\n\nSaladin died on 4 March 1193 before its expiration and his empire was contested and divided between three of his sons and two of his brothers. The new ruler of Jerusalem, [[Henry II, Count of Champagne|Henry II of Champagne]], signed an extension of the truce with Egyptian Sultan [[al-Aziz Uthman]]. In 1197, the peace was interrupted by the arrival of the [[Crusade of 1197|German Crusade]] of 1197.  Without the permission of Henry, the Germans attacked the territory of [[Al-Adil I|al-Adil I of Damascus]], who responded by attacking Jaffa. The sudden death of Henry prevented the relief of the port and the city was taken by force. The Germans did, however, succeed in capturing [[Beirut]] in the north.<ref name=Kedar/>\n\nHenry was succeeded by [[Aimery of Cyprus]], who signed a truce with al-Adil of five years and eight months on 1 July 1198. The truce preserved the status quo: Jaffa remained in Ayyubid hands, but its destroyed fortifications could not be rebuilt; Beirut was left to the crusaders; and [[Sidon]] was placed under a revenue-sharing condominium. Before the expiration of the new truce on 1 March 1204, al-Adil succeeded in uniting the former empire of Saladin, acquiring Egypt in 1200 and [[Aleppo]] in 1202.

Ascending as [[Alexios III Angelos]], the new emperor had his brother [[political mutilation in Byzantine culture|blinded]] (a traditional punishment for treason, considered more humane than execution) and exiled. Ineffectual on the battlefield, Isaac had also proven to be an incompetent ruler who had let the treasury dwindle and outsourced the navy to the Venetians.

Anxious to shore up his position, Alexios bankrupted the treasury. His attempts to secure the support of semi-autonomous border commanders undermined central authority.

Earlier crusades focused on Palestine had involved the slow movement of large and disorganised land hosts across a generally hostile [[Anatolia]]. Egypt was now the dominant Muslim power in the eastern Mediterranean but also a major trading partner of Venice.<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 15th Edition, page 306 Macropaedia Volume 5</ref> An attack on Egypt would clearly be a maritime enterprise, requiring the creation of a fleet. Genoa was uninterested, but in March 1201 negotiations were opened with Venice, which agreed to transport 33,500 crusaders, a very ambitious number. This agreement required a full year of preparation on the part of the Venetians to build numerous ships and train the sailors who would man them, all the while curtailing the city's commercial activities. The crusading army was expected to consist of 4,500 knights (as well as 4,500 horses), 9,000 squires, and 20,000 foot-soldiers.\n\nThe majority of the crusading army that set out from [[Venice]] in early October 1202 originated from areas within France. It included men from [[Blois]], [[Champagne, France|Champagne]], [[Amiens]], [[County of Saint-Pol|Saint-Pol]], the [[\u00cele-de-France]], and [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]]. Several other regions of Europe sent substantial contingents as well, such as [[Flanders]] and [[Montferrat]]. Other notable groups came from the [[Holy Roman Empire]], including the men under [[Martin of Pairis|Martin]], abbot of [[Pairis Abbey]] <!--Pairis is not Paris--> and Bishop [[Conrad of Halberstadt]], together in alliance with the Venetian soldiers and sailors led by the [[Doge of Venice|doge]], [[Enrico Dandolo]]. The crusade was to be ready to sail on 24 June 1203 and make directly for the Ayyubid capital, [[Cairo]]. This agreement was ratified by Pope Innocent, with a solemn ban on attacks on Christian states.<ref name= \"Hughes\">Hughes, Philip. \"Innocent III and the Latin East,\" ''[http://www.ewtn.com/library/CHISTORY/HUGHHIST.TXT History of the Church]'' (Sheed & Ward, 1948), vol. 2, pp. 370\u2013372.</ref>\n\n==Diversion==\n=== Attack on Zara ===\n{{Main|Siege of Zara}}\n[[File:Pallucchini Tintoretto 590 1.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|right|The crusaders conquering the City of Zadar, painted by [[Tintoretto]] ]]\n\nThere was no binding agreement among the crusaders that all should sail from Venice.  Accordingly, many chose to sail from other ports, particularly [[Flanders]], [[Marseille]], and [[Genoa]]. By May 1202, the bulk of the crusader army was collected at Venice, although with far smaller numbers than expected: about 12,000 (4\u20135,000 knights and 8,000 foot soldiers) instead of 33,500.<ref name=\"Queller232\">D.

The crusaders could only initially pay 35,000 silver marks. The Doge threatened to keep them interned unless full payment was made so a further 14,000 marks were collected, and that only by reducing the crusaders to extreme poverty.<ref>Robert de Clari, La Prise de Constantinople, xi\u2013xii, in Hopf, Chroniques Greco-Romaines, pp. 7\u20139.

In addition, about 14,000 men or as many as 20\u201330,000 men (out of Venice's population of 60\u2013100,000 people) were needed to man the entire fleet, placing further strain on the Venetian economy.<ref name=\"Queller17\"/><ref name=\"econ\">Phillips. ''The Fourth Crusade'', p. 57.</ref>\n\nDandolo and the Venetians considered what to do with the crusade. It was too small to pay its fee, but disbanding the force gathered would harm Venetian prestige and cause significant financial and trading loss. Dandolo, who joined the crusade during a public ceremony in the church of [[San Marco di Venezia]], proposed that the crusaders pay their debts by intimidating many of the local ports and towns down the Adriatic, culminating in an attack on the port of [[Zadar|Zara]] in [[Dalmatia]].<ref>Zara is the today the city of [[Zadar]] in [[Croatia]]; it was called \"Jadera\" in [[Latin]] documents and \"Jadres\" by [[France|French]] crusaders.

Many of the crusaders were opposed to attacking Zara, and some, including a force led by the elder [[Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]], refused to participate altogether and returned home or went to the Holy Land on their own. While the Papal legate to the Crusade, Cardinal [[Peter of Capua]], endorsed the move as necessary to prevent the crusade's complete failure, the Pope was alarmed at this development and wrote a letter to the crusading leadership threatening [[excommunication]].<ref name= \"Hughes\"/>\n\nIn 1202, Pope Innocent III, despite wanting to secure papal authority over Byzantium, forbade the crusaders of Western Christendom from committing any atrocious acts against their Christian neighbours.<ref>{{cite book| last = Hindley| first = Geoffrey| title = The Crusades: A History of Armed Pilgrimage and Holy War| url = https://archive.org/details/crusadeshistoryo00hind| url-access = registration| publisher =Carroll & Graf Publishers| location=New York | year = 2003 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/crusadeshistoryo00hind/page/143 143], 152 | isbn = }}</ref> However, this letter, delivered by [[Peter of Lucedio]], may not have reached the army in time. The bulk of the army arrived at Zara on 10\u201311 November 1202 and the attack proceeded. The citizens of Zara made reference to the fact that they were fellow Catholics by hanging banners marked with crosses from their windows and the walls of the city, but nevertheless the city fell on 24 November 1202 after a brief siege. There was extensive pillaging, and the Venetians and other crusaders came to blows over the division of the spoils.

Out of fear that this would dissolve the army, the leaders of the crusade decided not to inform their followers of this.

According to the [[Novgorod First Chronicle|Chronicle of Novgorod]] Doge Enrico Dandolo had been blinded by the Byzantines during the 1171 expedition to Byzantium and thus held personal enmity towards the Byzantines.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=sk9lvXUMHpYC&lpg=PA64&ots=Rte5ctmKXg&q=%22recorded%20in%20the%20chronicle%20of%20novgorod%22#v=snippet&q=%22recorded%20in%20the%20chronicle%20of%20novgorod%22&f=false Madden (2003)]</ref>\n\n[[Boniface I, Marquess of Montferrat|Boniface of Montferrat]], meanwhile, had left the fleet before it sailed from Venice, to visit his cousin [[Philip of Swabia]]. The reasons for his visit are a matter of debate; he may have realized the Venetians' plans and left to avoid excommunication, or he may have wanted to meet with the Byzantine prince [[Alexios IV Angelos]], Philip's brother-in-law and the son of the recently deposed Byzantine emperor [[Isaac II Angelos]]. Alexios IV had recently fled to Philip in 1201 but it is unknown whether or not Boniface knew he was at Philip's court. There, Alexios IV offered to pay the entire debt owed to the Venetians, give 200,000 silver marks to the crusaders, 10,000 Byzantine professional troops for the Crusade, the maintenance of 500 knights in the Holy Land, the service of the Byzantine navy to transport the Crusader Army to Egypt, and the placement of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] under the authority of the Pope, if they would sail to Byzantium and topple the reigning emperor [[Alexios III Angelos]], brother of Isaac II. This tempting offer, for an enterprise that was short on funds, reached the leaders of the Crusade on 1 January 1203 as they wintered at Zara.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jean|last=Richard|page=247|title=The Crusades c. 1071 \u2013 c. 1291|ISBN=0-521-62566-1}}</ref> Doge Dandolo was a fierce supporter of the plan; however, in his earlier capacity as an ambassador to Byzantium and someone who knew the finer details of how Byzantine politics worked, it is likely he knew the promises were false and there was no hope of any Byzantine emperor raising the money promised, let alone raising the troops and giving the church to the Holy See. Count Boniface agreed and Alexios IV returned with the Marquess to rejoin the fleet at [[Corfu]] after it had sailed from Zara. Most of the rest of the crusade's leaders, encouraged by bribes from Dandolo,<ref name=\"Runciman98\"/> eventually accepted the plan as well. However, there were dissenters. Led by [[Renaud of Montmirail]], those who refused to take part in the scheme to attack Constantinople sailed on to Syria.<ref name=\"Runciman98\"/> The remaining fleet of 60 [[war galley]]s, 100 [[Horse transports in the Middle Ages|horse transports]], and 50 large [[Troopship|transports]] (the entire fleet was manned by 10,000 Venetian oarsmen and marines) sailed in late April 1203.<ref name=\"Phillips269\">{{cite book\n| last = Phillips\n| first = Jonathan\n| title = The Fourth Crusade and the Sack of Constantinople\n| url = https://archive.org/details/fourthcrusadesac00phil_0\n| url-access = registration\n| publisher =Viking\n| location= New York\n| year = 2004\n| page=[https://archive.org/details/fourthcrusadesac00phil_0/page/269 269]\n| isbn =978-0-14-303590-9}}</ref> In addition, 300 siege engines were brought along on board the fleet.<ref name=\"siege\">Phillips.

[[Conon of Bethune]] delivered this ultimatum to the Lombard envoy sent by the Emperor [[Alexios III Angelos]], who was the pretender's uncle and had seized the throne from the pretender's father Isaac II. The citizens of Constantinople were not concerned with the cause of the deposed emperor and his exiled son; hereditary right of succession had never been adopted by the empire and a palace coup between brothers was not considered illegitimate in the way it would have been in the West. First the crusaders attacked and were repulsed from the cities of [[Chalcedon]] and [[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar#Chrysopolis|Chrysopolis]], suburbs of the great city. They won a cavalry skirmish in which they were outnumbered, defeating 500 Byzantines with just 80 Frankish knights.<ref name=\"battle\">Phillips.

About 200 ships, horse transports, and [[galley]]s delivered the crusading army across the narrow strait, where Alexios III had lined up the Byzantine army in battle formation along the shore, north of the suburb of Galata. The Crusader knights charged straight out of the horse transports, and the Byzantine army fled south. The Crusaders followed and attacked the [[Galata Tower (old)|Tower of Galata]], which held the northern end of the massive chain that blocked access to the [[Golden Horn]]. The Tower of Galata held a garrison of mercenary troops of English, Danish, and Italian origin.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Andrea |first1=Alfred |title=Contemporary Sources For The Fourth Crusade |pages=191\u2013192}}</ref> On 6 July the largest ship in the crusaders' fleet, the ''Aquila'' (Eagle), broke the chain. A section of it was then sent to Acre to boost the defences in the Holy Land.<ref name=Kedar/>\n\nAs the crusaders laid siege to the Tower of Galata, the defenders routinely attempted to sally out with some limited success, but often suffered bloody losses. On one occasion the defenders sallied out but were unable to retreat back to the safety of the tower in time, the Crusader forces viciously counterattacked, with most of the defenders being cut down or drowning in the Bosporus in their attempts to escape.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Andrea |first1=Alfred |title=Contemporary Sources For The Fourth Crusade |page=193}}</ref> The tower was swiftly taken as a result. The Golden Horn now lay open to the Crusaders, and the Venetian fleet entered.  The Crusaders sailed alongside Constantinople with 10 galleys to display the would-be Alexios IV, but from the [[walls of Constantinople|walls of the city]] citizens taunted the puzzled crusaders, who had been led to believe that they would rise up to welcome the young pretender Alexios as a liberator.<ref name=\"taunt\">Phillips. ''The Fourth Crusade'', p. 164.</ref>\n\nOn 11 July, the Crusaders took positions opposite the [[Palace of Blachernae]] on the northwest corner of the city. Their first attempts were repulsed, but on 17 July, with four divisions attacking the land walls while the Venetian fleet attacked the sea walls from the Golden Horn, the Venetians took a section of the wall of about 25 towers, while the Varangian guard held off the Crusaders on the land wall. The Varangians shifted to meet the new threat, and the Venetians retreated under the screen of fire. The fire destroyed about {{convert|120|acre|km2}} of the city and left some 20,000 people homeless.<ref name=\"fire\">Phillips. ''The Fourth Crusade'', p. 176.</ref>\n\nAlexios III finally took offensive action, leading 17 divisions from the St. Romanus Gate, vastly outnumbering the crusaders. Alexios III's army of about 8,500 men faced the Crusaders' seven divisions (about 3,500 men), but his courage failed, and the Byzantine army returned to the city without a fight.<ref name=\"battle2\">Phillips. ''The Fourth Crusade'', p. 177.</ref> The unforced retreat and the effects of the fire greatly damaged morale, and the disgraced Alexios III abandoned his subjects, slipping out of the city and fleeing to [[Mosynopolis]] in [[Thrace]].<ref name=\"Runciman100\">Runciman, Steven.

The crusaders insisted that they would only recognize the authority of Isaac II if his son was raised to co-emperor, and on 1 August the latter was crowned as Alexios Angelos IV, co-emperor.<ref name=\"Runciman100\"/>\n\n=== Reign of Alexios IV ===\n[[File:PriseDeConstantinople1204PalmaLeJeune.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|Capture of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204]]\nAlexios IV realised that his promises were hard to keep. Alexios III had managed to flee with 1,000&nbsp;pounds of gold and some priceless jewels, leaving the imperial treasury short on funds. At that point the young emperor ordered the destruction and melting of valuable Byzantine and Roman icons in order to extract their gold and silver, but even then he could only raise 100,000 silver marks. In the eyes of all Greeks who knew of this decision, it was a shocking sign of desperation and weak leadership, which deserved to be punished by God. The Byzantine historian [[Nicetas Choniates]] characterized it as \"the turning point towards the decline of the Roman state\".<ref name=\"Phillips\">Phillips, ''The Fourth Crusade''</ref>\n\nForcing the populace to destroy their icons at the behest of an army of foreign schismatics did not endear Alexios IV to the citizens of Constantinople. In fear of his life, the co-emperor asked the crusaders to renew their contract for another six months, to end by April 1204. Alexios IV then led 6,000 men from the Crusader army against his rival Alexios III in Adrianople.<ref name = \"exp\"/> During the co-emperor's absence in August, rioting broke out in the city and a number of Latin residents were killed. In retaliation armed Venetians and other crusaders entered the city from the Golden Horn and attacked a [[mosque]] (Constantinople at this time had a sizable Muslim population), which was defended by Muslim and Byzantine residents {{citation needed|date=February 2018}}. In order to cover their retreat the Westerners instigated the \"Great Fire\", which burnt from 19 to 21 August, destroying a large part of Constantinople and leaving an estimated 100,000 homeless.\n\nIn January 1204, the blinded and incapacitated Isaac II died, probably of natural causes.<ref name=\"Phillips\"/> Opposition to his son and co-emperor Alexios IV had grown during the preceding months of tension and spasmodic violence in and around Constantinople. The [[Byzantine Senate]] elected a young noble [[Nicolas Canabus]] as emperor, in what was to be one of the last known acts of this ancient institution. However he declined the appointment and sought church sanctuary.<ref>''Chambers's Encyclopaedia'', vol. II, London, 1868, p. 471</ref>\n\nA nobleman [[Alexios V Doukas|Alexios Doukas]] (nicknamed Mourtzouphlos) became the leader of the anti-crusader faction within the Byzantine leadership. While holding the court rank of ''protovestilarios'', Doukas had led Byzantine forces during the initial clashes with the crusaders, winning respect from both military and populace. He was accordingly well-placed to move against the increasingly isolated Alexios IV, whom he overthrew, imprisoned, and had strangled in early February. Doukas then was crowned as Emperor Alexios V. He immediately moved to have the city fortifications strengthened and summoned additional forces to the city.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Nicolle\n| first = David\n| title = The Fourth Crusade 1202\u201304 \u2013 the Betrayal of Byzantium\n| publisher =Osprey Publishing Ltd\n| location= Oxford\n| year = 2011\n| pages= 25, 65\n| isbn =978 1 84908 319 5}}</ref>\n\n===War against Alexios V===\nThe crusaders and Venetians, incensed at the murder of their supposed patron, demanded that Mourtzouphlos honour the contract that Alexios IV had promised. When the Byzantine emperor refused, the Crusaders assaulted the city once again. On 8 April Alexios V's army put up a strong resistance, which did much to discourage the crusaders.<ref name=\"Phillips\"/> The Byzantines hurled large projectiles onto the enemy siege engines, shattering many of them. Bad weather conditions were a serious hindrance to the crusaders. A fierce wind blew from the shore and prevented most of the ships from drawing close enough to the walls to launch an assault. Only five of the wall's towers were actually engaged and none of these could be secured; by mid-afternoon it was evident that the attack had failed.<ref name=\"Phillips\"/>\n\nThe Latin clergy discussed the situation amongst themselves and settled upon the message they wished to spread through the demoralised army. They had to convince the men that the events of 9 April were not God's judgment on a sinful enterprise: the campaign, they argued, was righteous and with proper belief it would succeed. The concept of God testing the determination of the crusaders through temporary setbacks was a familiar means for the clergy to explain failure in the course of a campaign.<ref name=\"Phillips\"/> The clergy's message was designed to reassure and encourage the Crusaders. Their argument that the attack on Constantinople was spiritual revolved around two themes.

Alexios V's army stayed in the city to fight, along with the imperial bodyguard, the [[Varangians]], but Alexios V himself fled during the night. An attempt was made to find a further replacement emperor from amongst the Byzantine nobility, but the situation had now become too chaotic for either of the two candidates who came forward to find sufficient support.\n\nOn 12 April 1204, the weather conditions finally favoured the crusaders. A strong northern wind aided the Venetian ships in coming close to the walls, and after a short battle approximately seventy crusaders managed to enter the city. Some were able to knock holes in the walls, large enough for only a few knights at a time to crawl through; the Venetians were also successful at scaling the walls from the sea, though there was fighting with the Varangians. The Anglo-Saxon \"axe bearers\" had been amongst the most effective of the city's defenders, but they now attempted to negotiate higher wages from their Byzantine employers, before dispersing or surrendering.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Nicolle\n| first = David\n| title = The Fourth Crusade 1202\u201304 \u2013 the Betrayal of Byzantium\n| publisher =Osprey Publishing Ltd\n| location= Oxford\n| year = 2011\n| page= 77\n| isbn =978 1 84908 319 5}}</ref> The crusaders captured the [[Blachernae]] section of the city in the northwest and used it as a base to attack the rest of the city.

The most infamous action of the Fourth Crusade was the sack of the Orthodox Christian city of [[Constantinople]].]]\nThe crusaders sacked Constantinople for three days, during which many ancient Greco-Roman and medieval Byzantine works of art were stolen or ruined. Many of the civilian population of the city were killed and their property looted. Despite the threat of excommunication, the crusaders destroyed, defiled and looted the city's churches and monasteries.<ref name= \"Speros\"/><ref name= \"Hughes\"/> It was said that the total amount looted from Constantinople was about 900,000 silver marks. The Venetians received 150,000 silver marks that were their due, while the crusaders received 50,000 silver marks. A further 100,000 silver marks were divided evenly up between the crusaders and Venetians. The remaining 500,000 silver marks were secretly kept back by many crusader knights.<ref name=\"Ang\">Konstam, ''Historical Atlas of The Crusades'', 162</ref><ref name=\"Tread663\">W. Treadgold, ''A History of Byzantine State and Society'', 663</ref>\n\n[[Speros Vryonis]] in ''Byzantium and Europe'' gives a vivid account of the sack:\n\n{{quote|The Latin soldiery subjected the greatest city in Europe to an indescribable sack. For three days they murdered, raped, looted and destroyed on a scale which even the ancient Vandals and Goths would have found unbelievable. Constantinople had become a veritable museum of ancient and Byzantine art, an emporium of such incredible wealth that the Latins were astounded at the riches they found. Though the Venetians had an appreciation for the art which they discovered (they were themselves semi-Byzantines) and saved much of it, the French and others destroyed indiscriminately, halting to refresh themselves with wine, violation of nuns, and murder of Orthodox clerics. The Crusaders vented their hatred for the Greeks most spectacularly in the desecration of the greatest Church in Christendom. They smashed the silver iconostasis, the icons and the holy books of [[Hagia Sophia]], and seated upon the patriarchal throne a whore who sang coarse songs as they drank wine from the Church's holy vessels. The estrangement of East and West, which had proceeded over the centuries, culminated in the horrible massacre that accompanied the conquest of Constantinople. The Greeks were convinced that even the Turks, had they taken the city, would not have been as cruel as the Latin Christians. The defeat of Byzantium, already in a state of decline, accelerated political degeneration so that the Byzantines eventually became an easy prey to the Turks. The Fourth Crusade and the crusading movement generally thus resulted, ultimately, in the victory of Islam, a result which was of course the exact opposite of its original intention.<ref name= \"Speros\">{{cite book\n| last = Vryonis\n| first = Speros\n| authorlink =Speros Vryonis\n| title = Byzantium and Europe\n| url = https://archive.org/details/byzantiumeurope00vryo\n| url-access = registration\n| publisher =Harcourt, Brace & World\n| location= New York\n| year =1967\n| page=[https://archive.org/details/byzantiumeurope00vryo/page/152 152]}}</ref>}}\n\nWhen Innocent III heard of the conduct of his pilgrims he was filled with shame and rage, and he strongly rebuked them.\n\n==Holy Land==\nThe main army that sailed from Venice to Constantinople experienced several waves of defections as men sought to fulfill their vows independently of the leadership. Most of them sailed directly from ports in [[Apulia]] (southern Italy) to Acre. According to Villehardouin, the majority of those who set out on the Fourth Crusade went to the Holy Land, while only a minority participated in the attack on Constantinople. Villehardouin, however, regarded those who went to the Holy Land as deserters of the main army and its leadership and he may have exaggerated their number in order to magnify the accomplishments of the minority that besieged Constantinople.<ref name=Kedar/><ref name=\"Queller et al.\">{{citation |author1=D.

[[Steven Runciman]] thought that only a \"tiny proportion\" and [[Joshua Prawer]] only some \"pitiful remnants\" of the original army arrived in the Holy Land. Recent studies suggest that the number was substantial but shy of a majority. Of the 92 named individuals who took the crusader vow in Villehardouin's account, between 23 and 26 of them went to the Holy Land. The rate of \"desertion\" seems highest among the French faction.<ref name=\"Queller et al.\"/> Only about a tenth of the knights who had taken the cross in Flanders arrived to reinforce the remaining Christian states in the Holy Land, but over half of those from the \u00cele-de-France did. All told, about 300 knights with their retinues from northern France made it to the Holy Land.<ref>{{cite book | last = Nicolle | first = David | title = The Fourth Crusade 1202\u201304: The Betrayal of Byzantium | publisher =Osprey Publishing| location= Oxford | year = 2011 | page = 78 | isbn =978 1 84908 319 5}}</ref> Of the contingents from Burgundy, Occitania, Italy and Germany we have less information, but there were certainly defections among the Occitan and German contingents.<ref name=Kedar/>\n\nA large sum of money raised by the preacher Fulk of Neuilly did reach the Holy Land. Before his death in May 1202, Fulk gave the money to the [[Abbey of C\u00eeteaux]]. Abbot [[Arnaud Amalric]] sent it to Acre in two installments. It was used to repair walls, towers and other defences that had been damaged by the [[1202 Syria earthquake|earthquake of May 1202]]. A second wall was even added at Acre sometime before 1212.<ref name=Kedar/>\n\n===Apulia to Acre===\nSeveral crusaders, instead of going on to Venice, turned south at [[Piacenza]] in the summer of 1202 intending to go directly to the Holy Land from ports in southern Italy. Among them were [[Vilain of Nully]], [[Henry of Arzilli\u00e8res]], [[Renard III of Dampierre-en-Astenois|Renard III of Dampierre]], [[Henry of Longchamp]] and Giles of Trasignies with their retinues. They do not seem to have been acting in concert or travelling together. Ultimately, several hundred knights and accompanying infantry reached the Holy Land via south Italian ports. The force was so small that King [[Aimery of Jerusalem]] refused to break his truce with the [[Ayyubids]] to allow them to go to war, despite the pleas of Renard, who was fulfilling the crusading vow of the late Count [[Theobald III of Champagne]] and possessed ample funds. As a result, eighty crusaders under Renard decided to go to the [[Principality of Antioch]], which had no such truce. Advised against such a move, they were ambushed on the road and all but one were killed or captured. Renard remained in captivity for thirty years.<ref name=\"Queller et al.\"/>\n\nWhen the crusade was diverted to Zara, many crusaders returned home or else remained behind in Italy. Some bypassed the Venetian fleet and found other means of going to the Holy Land. [[Geoffrey I of Villehardouin|Geoffrey of Villehardouin]], the historian's nephew, was one of them. [[Stephen du Perche (died 1205)|Stephen of the Perche]], was prevented from going with the main army on account of illness. Upon his recovery in March 1203, he took ship in southern Italy and travelled directly to the Holy Land with many others who had remained behind, including Rotrou of Montfort and Yves of La Jaille. Stephen re-joined the main army after the fall of Constantinople.<ref name=\"Queller et al.\"/>\n\nFollowing the siege of Zara, more contingents abandoned the main army. The crusaders sent Robert of Boves as an envoy to the pope, but after his mission was done he went straight to the Holy Land. Abbot Martin of Pairis joined him on the trip to Rome and afterwards took ship for Palestine at [[Siponto]]. Martin arrived in Acre on 25 April 1203 in the midst of an outbreak of plague. According to the ''[[Devastatio Constantinopolitana]]'', after the decision was made at Zara to place  Alexios IV on the throne of Constantinople, the leaders of the crusade granted permission for about 1,000 men to leave and find their own way to the Holy Land. In fact, about 2,000 men abandoned the main army at that stage. Most of them were among the poorer crusaders, and two ships carrying them sank with loss of life. The German crusader Garnier of Borland also abandoned the main army after Zara.<ref name=\"Queller et al.\"/>\n\nFrom Zara, an official embassy, led by [[Renaud of Montmirail]], was dispatched to the Holy Land. It included Herv\u00e9 of Ch\u00e2tel, [[Guillaume de Ferri\u00e8res|William III of Ferri\u00e8res]], Geoffrey of Beaumont and the brothers John and Peter of Frouville. They were supposed to return to the main army within fifteen days of accomplishing their mission. In fact, they remained in the Holy Land and did not return until after the fall of Constantinople.<ref name=\"Queller et al.\"/>\n\nIn the winter of 1203\u20131204, [[Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester|Simon V of Montfort]] led a large contingent of defectors disgusted with the attack on Zara and opposed to the Constantinople venture. He and his men had even avoided the ruins of Zara and camped in Hungary.<ref name=\"Lippiatt 2012\">{{citation |author=G. E. M.

The Flemish fleet left Flanders in the summer of 1202 under the command of [[John II of Nesle]], [[Thierry of Flanders (flourished 1197\u20131207)|Thierry of Flanders]] and [[Nicholas of Mailly]].{{efn|Nicholas of Mailly joined the main army after the fall of Constantinople.<ref name=\"Queller et al.\"/>}} It sailed into the Mediterranean and, according to the chronicler [[Ernoul]], attacked and captured an unnamed Muslim city on the African coast. The city was left in the hands of the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] and the fleet went on to [[Marseille]], where it wintered in 1202\u20131203. There the fleet was joined by a number of French crusaders, including Bishop [[Walter II (bishop of Autun)|Walter II of Autun]], Count [[Guigues III of Forez]], [[Bernard IV of Moreuil]], Henry of Arraines, Hugh of Chaumont, John of Villers, Peter Bromont and the brothers Walter and Hugh of Saint-Denis and their retinues.<ref name=\"Queller et al.\"/>\n\nThe pilots of Marseille had more experience sailing out of sight of land than those of any other Mediterranean port, having been doing it since the mid-12th century. In summer, they could make the trip to Acre in fifteen days. They possessed a fleet sufficient to transport the army of [[Richard the Lionheart]] on the [[Third Crusade]] in 1190. It was also a cheaper and more accessible port for the French contingent.<ref name=\"Queller et al.\"/>\n\nBaldwin sent orders to his fleet in Marseille to sail at the end of March 1203 and rendezvous with the Venetian fleet off [[Methoni, Messenia|Methoni]].{{efn|Baldwin of Flanders' wife, [[Marie of Champagne]], sailed from Marseille to Acre in the spring of 1204. She was there when she learned of his election as emperor.<ref name=\"Queller et al.\"/>}} His messengers must also have brought news of the decision to go to Constantinople before proceeding to the Holy Land. For this reason the  Flemish leaders may have opted to ignore the rendezvous and sail directly to Acre. It is also possible that they kept the rendezvous, but not finding the Venetian fleet (which did not get to Methoni before May) went on to Acre alone. They probably arrived there before Martin of Pairis on 25 April 1203.<ref name=\"Queller et al.\"/>\n\nThe Flemish crusaders encountered the same difficulty as Renard of Dampierre. King Aimery was unwilling to break his  truce for the sake of such a small army. The crusaders therefore split up. Some entered the service of the Principality of Antioch and others that of the [[County of Tripoli]]. Bernard of Moreuil and John of Villers joined Renard of Dampierre and were captured along with him. John of Nesle went to the aid of the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Kingdom of Armenia]] and thus found himself fighting some of his former comrades, since Armenia and Antioch were then at war. Sometime before 5 November 1203, however, the truce was broken. The Muslims seized two Christian ships and in retaliation the Christians had seized six Muslim ships. The Flemish crusaders returned to the Kingdom of Jerusalem to fight the infidel.<ref name=\"Queller et al.\"/>\n\nOn 8 November, Martin of Pairis and [[Conrad of Swartzenberg]] were sent to the main army, then besieging Constantinople, to press for it to continue on to the Holy Land now that the truce was broken. The envoys arrived on 1 January 1204, but the army was in the midst of heavy fighting and nothing came of their embassy.<ref name=\"Queller et al.\"/>\n\n== Outcomes ==\n===Partition of the Byzantine Empire===\n[[File:LatinEmpire2.png|thumb|300px|Partition of the Byzantine Empire into The [[Latin Empire]], [[Empire of Nicaea]], and [[Despotate of Epirus]] after 1204]]\n\nAccording to a [[Partitio terrarum imperii Romaniae|subsequent treaty]], the empire was apportioned between Venice and the leaders of the crusade, and the [[Latin Empire]] of Constantinople was established. Boniface was not elected as the new emperor, although the citizens seemed to consider him as such; the Venetians thought he had too many connections with the former empire because of his brother, [[Renier of Montferrat]], who had been married to [[Maria Komnene (daughter of Manuel I)|Maria Komnene]], empress in the 1170s and 1180s. Instead they placed [[Baldwin I of Constantinople|Baldwin of Flanders]] on the throne. Boniface went on to found the [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]], a vassal state of the new Latin Empire. The Venetians also founded the [[Duchy of the Archipelago]] in the Aegean Sea. Meanwhile, Byzantine refugees founded their own [[rump state]]s, the most notable of these being the [[Empire of Nicaea]] under [[Theodore I Laskaris|Theodore Laskaris]] (a relative of Alexios III), the [[Empire of Trebizond]], and the [[Despotate of Epirus]].\n\nThe Latin Empire was soon faced with a number of enemies. Besides the individual [[Rump state|Byzantine rump states]] in [[Epirus]] and [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]], and the also Christian [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]], there was also the [[Sultanate of R\u00fbm|Seljuk Sultanate]].

The legacy of the Fourth Crusade was the deep sense of betrayal felt by the Greek Christians.

As for those who were supposed to be seeking the ends of [[Jesus]] Christ, not their own ends, who made their swords, which they were supposed to use against the pagans, drip with Christian blood, they have spared neither religion, nor age, nor sex. They have committed incest, adultery, and fornication before the eyes of men. They have exposed both matrons and virgins, even those dedicated to God, to the sordid lusts of boys. Not satisfied with breaking open the imperial treasury and plundering the goods of princes and lesser men, they also laid their hands on the treasures of the churches and, what is more serious, on their very possessions. They have even ripped silver plates from the altars and have hacked them to pieces among themselves. They violated the holy places and have carried off crosses and relics.<ref>Pope Innocent III, ''Letters'', 126 (given July 12, 1205, and addressed to the papal legate, who had absolved the crusaders from their pilgrimage vows).

When the crusaders took some of the piles of money, jewels, and gold that they had captured in the sack of Constantinople back to Rome, Innocent III accepted the stolen items. Furthermore, at the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] the Pope welcomed and recognised to it western (Catholic) prelates from sees established in the conquered lands{{snd}} thus recognising their legitimacy over formerly Orthodox areas.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Latin rule in Greece===\n{{main|Frankokratia}}\nVarious Latin\u2013French lordships throughout Greece{{snd}} in particular, the [[Duchy of Athens]] and the [[Principality of Achaea|principality of the Morea]]{{snd}} provided cultural contacts with western Europe and promoted the study of Greek.

The ''[[Chronicle of Morea]]'' appeared in both [[French language|French]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] (and later Italian and Aragonese) versions. Impressive remains of crusader castles and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic churches]] can still be seen in Greece. Nevertheless, the Latin Empire always rested on shaky foundations.

The stated intent of the expedition was to recapture the [[Islam|Muslim]]-controlled city of [[Jerusalem]], by first conquering the powerful Egyptian [[Ayyubid Sultanate]], the strongest Muslim state of the time. However, a sequence of economic and political events culminated in the Crusader army's 1204 [[Sack of Constantinople]], the capital of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Christian]]-controlled [[Byzantine Empire]], rather than Egypt as originally planned.\n\nIn late 1202, financial issues led to the Crusader army conducting the [[Siege of Zara]], sacking the Catholic city of [[Zadar|Zara]] (Zadar) on the Adriatic Sea which was then brought under [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] control. When the pope heard of this, he excommunicated the Crusader army. In January 1203, en route to Jerusalem, the Crusader leadership entered into an agreement with the Byzantine prince [[Alexios IV Angelos|Alexios Angelos]] to divert the Crusade to [[Constantinople]] and restore his deposed father [[Isaac II Angelos]] as emperor. The intent of the Crusaders was then to continue to Jerusalem with promised Byzantine financial and military aid. On 23 June 1203, the main Crusader army reached Constantinople, while other contingents (perhaps a majority of all crusaders) continued to [[Acre (city)|Acre]]. \n\nIn August 1203, following the [[Siege of Constantinople (1203)|Siege of Constantinople]], Alexios was crowned co-emperor. However, in January 1204 he was deposed by a popular uprising. The Crusaders were no longer able to receive their promised payments from Alexios. Following the murder of Alexios on 8 February, the Crusaders decided on the outright conquest of the city. In April 1204, they captured and plundered the city's enormous wealth. Only a handful of the Crusaders continued to the Holy Land thereafter.\n\nThe conquest of Constantinople was followed by the fragmentation of the Byzantine Empire into three states centered in [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]], [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]] and [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]]. The Crusaders then founded several new Crusader states, known as ''[[Frankokratia]]'', in former Byzantine territory, largely hinged upon the [[Latin Empire of Constantinople]]. The presence of the Latin Crusader states almost immediately led to war with the [[Nicaean-Latin wars|Byzantine successor states]] and the [[Bulgarian-Latin wars|Bulgarian Empire]]. The Nicaean Empire eventually recovered Constantinople and restored the Byzantine Empire in 1261.\n\nThe Fourth Crusade is considered to have solidified the [[East-West Schism]], and dealt an irrevocable blow, contributing to the [[decline of the Byzantine Empire]], paving the way for Muslim conquests in Anatolia and the [[Balkans]] in the coming centuries.\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n== Background ==\n===Loss of Jerusalem to the truce of 1198===\nBetween 1174 and 1187, the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid sultan]] [[Saladin]] conquered most of the [[Crusader states]] in the Levant.  Jerusalem was lost to the Ayyubids following the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|Siege of Jerusalem]] in 1187.<ref>[[John Julius Norwich]], ''Byzantium: The Decline and Fall'', (1995; repr., London: Folio Society, 2003), 169</ref>  The Crusader states were then reduced by Saladin to little more than three cities along the sea coast: [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] and [[Antioch]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Hans Eberhard|last=Mayer|page=136|title=The Crusades|ISBN=0-19-873097-7}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Third Crusade]] (1189\u20131192) was launched in response to the fall of Jerusalem and with the goal of recovering it. It successfully reclaimed an extensive territory, effectively reestablishing the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. Although Jerusalem itself was not recovered, the important coastal towns of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] and [[Jaffa]] were. On 2 September 1192, the [[Treaty of Jaffa]] was signed with Saladin, bringing the crusade to an end. It was to last for three years and eight months.<ref name=Kedar>{{citation |author=[[Benjamin Z.

The Byzantines for their part suspected him of conspiring with the breakaway Byzantine provinces of [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbia]] and [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]]. King [[Richard I of England]] also seized the breakaway Byzantine [[Theme of Cyprus|province of Cyprus]]. Rather than return it to the Empire, he sold the island to the [[Knights Templar]].\n\nSaladin died on 4 March 1193 before its expiration and his empire was contested and divided between three of his sons and two of his brothers. The new ruler of Jerusalem, [[Henry II, Count of Champagne|Henry II of Champagne]], signed an extension of the truce with Egyptian Sultan [[al-Aziz Uthman]]. In 1197, the peace was interrupted by the arrival of the [[Crusade of 1197|German Crusade]] of 1197.  Without the permission of Henry, the Germans attacked the territory of [[Al-Adil I|al-Adil I of Damascus]], who responded by attacking Jaffa. The sudden death of Henry prevented the relief of the port and the city was taken by force. The Germans did, however, succeed in capturing [[Beirut]] in the north.<ref name=Kedar/>\n\nHenry was succeeded by [[Aimery of Cyprus]], who signed a truce with al-Adil of five years and eight months on 1 July 1198. The truce preserved the status quo: Jaffa remained in Ayyubid hands, but its destroyed fortifications could not be rebuilt; Beirut was left to the crusaders; and [[Sidon]] was placed under a revenue-sharing condominium. Before the expiration of the new truce on 1 March 1204, al-Adil succeeded in uniting the former empire of Saladin, acquiring Egypt in 1200 and [[Aleppo]] in 1202. As a result, his domains almost completely surrounded the diminished Crusader states.<ref name=Kedar/>\n\n===Constantinople===\nConstantinople had been in existence for 874 years at the time of the Fourth Crusade and was the largest and most sophisticated city in Christendom.<ref>{{cite book| last = Nicolle | first = David| title = The Fourth Crusade 1202\u201304 \u2013 the Betrayal of Byzantium | publisher =Osprey Publishing Ltd| location= Oxford | year = 2011| page=15 | isbn =978 1 84908 319 5}}</ref> Almost  alone amongst major medieval urban centres, it had retained the civic structures, public baths, forums, monuments, and aqueducts of classical Rome in working form.

Ascending as [[Alexios III Angelos]], the new emperor had his brother [[political mutilation in Byzantine culture|blinded]] (a traditional punishment for treason, considered more humane than execution) and exiled. Ineffectual on the battlefield, Isaac had also proven to be an incompetent ruler who had let the treasury dwindle and outsourced the navy to the Venetians. His actions in wastefully distributing military weapons and supplies as gifts to his supporters had undermined the empire's defenses.<ref>John Julius Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Decline and Fall'', (1995; repr., London: Folio Society, 2003)</ref> The new emperor was to prove no better. Anxious to shore up his position, Alexios bankrupted the treasury. His attempts to secure the support of semi-autonomous border commanders undermined central authority. He neglected his crucial responsibilities for defence and diplomacy. The emperor's chief admiral (his wife's brother-in-law), [[Michael Stryphnos]], reportedly sold the fleet's equipment down to the very nails to enrich himself.\n\n== Rendezvous at Venice  ==\n[[Pope Innocent III]] succeeded to the papacy in January 1198, and the preaching of a new crusade became the prime goal of his pontificate, expounded in his bull ''[[Post Miserabile|Post miserabile]]''.<ref name=Madden>{{cite book |last=Madden |first=Thomas F. |editor-first=|editor-last=|title= The Fourth Crusade: Event, Aftermath, and Perceptions: Papers from the Sixth Conference of the Society for the Study of the Crusades and the Latin East in Istanbul, Turkey |date=August 19, 2008 |pages= |chapter= |isbn= 0-7546-6319-1}}</ref><ref name=Runciman>{{cite book |last=Runciman |first=Steven | authorlink =Steven Runciman |editor-first=|editor-last=|title=A History of the Crusades: The Kingdom of Acre and the Later Crusades (Volume 3) |year=1954 |pages= |chapter= |isbn=0-14-013705-X}}</ref> His call was largely ignored by the European monarchs: the Germans were struggling against Papal power, and [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[France in the Middle Ages|France]] were still engaged in [[Capetian\u2013Plantagenet rivalry|warfare against each other]].

Earlier crusades focused on Palestine had involved the slow movement of large and disorganised land hosts across a generally hostile [[Anatolia]]. Egypt was now the dominant Muslim power in the eastern Mediterranean but also a major trading partner of Venice.<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 15th Edition, page 306 Macropaedia Volume 5</ref> An attack on Egypt would clearly be a maritime enterprise, requiring the creation of a fleet. Genoa was uninterested, but in March 1201 negotiations were opened with Venice, which agreed to transport 33,500 crusaders, a very ambitious number. This agreement required a full year of preparation on the part of the Venetians to build numerous ships and train the sailors who would man them, all the while curtailing the city's commercial activities. The crusading army was expected to consist of 4,500 knights (as well as 4,500 horses), 9,000 squires, and 20,000 foot-soldiers.\n\nThe majority of the crusading army that set out from [[Venice]] in early October 1202 originated from areas within France. It included men from [[Blois]], [[Champagne, France|Champagne]], [[Amiens]], [[County of Saint-Pol|Saint-Pol]], the [[\u00cele-de-France]], and [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]]. Several other regions of Europe sent substantial contingents as well, such as [[Flanders]] and [[Montferrat]]. Other notable groups came from the [[Holy Roman Empire]], including the men under [[Martin of Pairis|Martin]], abbot of [[Pairis Abbey]] <!--Pairis is not Paris--> and Bishop [[Conrad of Halberstadt]], together in alliance with the Venetian soldiers and sailors led by the [[Doge of Venice|doge]], [[Enrico Dandolo]]. The crusade was to be ready to sail on 24 June 1203 and make directly for the Ayyubid capital, [[Cairo]]. This agreement was ratified by Pope Innocent, with a solemn ban on attacks on Christian states.<ref name= \"Hughes\">Hughes, Philip. \"Innocent III and the Latin East,\" ''[http://www.ewtn.com/library/CHISTORY/HUGHHIST.TXT History of the Church]'' (Sheed & Ward, 1948), vol. 2, pp. 370\u2013372.</ref>\n\n==Diversion==\n=== Attack on Zara ===\n{{Main|Siege of Zara}}\n[[File:Pallucchini Tintoretto 590 1.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|right|The crusaders conquering the City of Zadar, painted by [[Tintoretto]] ]]\n\nThere was no binding agreement among the crusaders that all should sail from Venice.  Accordingly, many chose to sail from other ports, particularly [[Flanders]], [[Marseille]], and [[Genoa]]. By May 1202, the bulk of the crusader army was collected at Venice, although with far smaller numbers than expected: about 12,000 (4\u20135,000 knights and 8,000 foot soldiers) instead of 33,500.<ref name=\"Queller232\">D.

E. Queller, ''The Fourth Crusade The Conquest of Constantinople'', 17</ref> The Venetians, under their aged and blind Doge Dandolo, would not let the crusaders leave without paying the full amount agreed to, originally 85,000 [[silver]] [[Mark (money)|marks]]. The crusaders could only initially pay 35,000 silver marks. The Doge threatened to keep them interned unless full payment was made so a further 14,000 marks were collected, and that only by reducing the crusaders to extreme poverty.<ref>Robert de Clari, La Prise de Constantinople, xi\u2013xii, in Hopf, Chroniques Greco-Romaines, pp. 7\u20139. Old French.</ref> This was disastrous to the Venetians, who had halted their commerce for a great length of time to prepare this expedition. In addition, about 14,000 men or as many as 20\u201330,000 men (out of Venice's population of 60\u2013100,000 people) were needed to man the entire fleet, placing further strain on the Venetian economy.<ref name=\"Queller17\"/><ref name=\"econ\">Phillips. ''The Fourth Crusade'', p. 57.</ref>\n\nDandolo and the Venetians considered what to do with the crusade. It was too small to pay its fee, but disbanding the force gathered would harm Venetian prestige and cause significant financial and trading loss. Dandolo, who joined the crusade during a public ceremony in the church of [[San Marco di Venezia]], proposed that the crusaders pay their debts by intimidating many of the local ports and towns down the Adriatic, culminating in an attack on the port of [[Zadar|Zara]] in [[Dalmatia]].<ref>Zara is the today the city of [[Zadar]] in [[Croatia]]; it was called \"Jadera\" in [[Latin]] documents and \"Jadres\" by [[France|French]] crusaders. The Venetian (Italian) \"Zara\" is a later derivation of the contemporary vernacular \"Zadra\".</ref> The city had been dominated economically by Venice throughout the 12th century but had rebelled in 1181 and allied itself with [[Emeric of Hungary|King Emeric]] of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and [[King of Croatia|Croatia]].<ref>[http://thepeerage.com/p10465.htm#i104647 Person Page 10465].  thePeerage.com.</ref><ref>Madden, Thomas F., and Donald E.

Many of the crusaders were opposed to attacking Zara, and some, including a force led by the elder [[Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]], refused to participate altogether and returned home or went to the Holy Land on their own. While the Papal legate to the Crusade, Cardinal [[Peter of Capua]], endorsed the move as necessary to prevent the crusade's complete failure, the Pope was alarmed at this development and wrote a letter to the crusading leadership threatening [[excommunication]].<ref name= \"Hughes\"/>\n\nIn 1202, Pope Innocent III, despite wanting to secure papal authority over Byzantium, forbade the crusaders of Western Christendom from committing any atrocious acts against their Christian neighbours.<ref>{{cite book| last = Hindley| first = Geoffrey| title = The Crusades: A History of Armed Pilgrimage and Holy War| url = https://archive.org/details/crusadeshistoryo00hind| url-access = registration| publisher =Carroll & Graf Publishers| location=New York | year = 2003 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/crusadeshistoryo00hind/page/143 143], 152 | isbn = }}</ref> However, this letter, delivered by [[Peter of Lucedio]], may not have reached the army in time. The bulk of the army arrived at Zara on 10\u201311 November 1202 and the attack proceeded. The citizens of Zara made reference to the fact that they were fellow Catholics by hanging banners marked with crosses from their windows and the walls of the city, but nevertheless the city fell on 24 November 1202 after a brief siege. There was extensive pillaging, and the Venetians and other crusaders came to blows over the division of the spoils.  Order was achieved, and the leaders of the expedition agreed to winter in Zara, while considering their next move.<ref>{{cite book | last = Runciman | first = Stephen | title = A History of the Crusades \u2013  the Kingdom of Arce and the Later Crusades | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 1975 | pages =115 | isbn = 0 521 20554 9}}</ref> The fortifications of Zara were demolished by the Venetians.\n\nWhen Innocent III heard of the sack, he sent a letter to the crusaders excommunicating them and ordering them to return to their holy vows and head for Jerusalem. Out of fear that this would dissolve the army, the leaders of the crusade decided not to inform their followers of this.

According to the [[Novgorod First Chronicle|Chronicle of Novgorod]] Doge Enrico Dandolo had been blinded by the Byzantines during the 1171 expedition to Byzantium and thus held personal enmity towards the Byzantines.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=sk9lvXUMHpYC&lpg=PA64&ots=Rte5ctmKXg&q=%22recorded%20in%20the%20chronicle%20of%20novgorod%22#v=snippet&q=%22recorded%20in%20the%20chronicle%20of%20novgorod%22&f=false Madden (2003)]</ref>\n\n[[Boniface I, Marquess of Montferrat|Boniface of Montferrat]], meanwhile, had left the fleet before it sailed from Venice, to visit his cousin [[Philip of Swabia]]. The reasons for his visit are a matter of debate; he may have realized the Venetians' plans and left to avoid excommunication, or he may have wanted to meet with the Byzantine prince [[Alexios IV Angelos]], Philip's brother-in-law and the son of the recently deposed Byzantine emperor [[Isaac II Angelos]]. Alexios IV had recently fled to Philip in 1201 but it is unknown whether or not Boniface knew he was at Philip's court. There, Alexios IV offered to pay the entire debt owed to the Venetians, give 200,000 silver marks to the crusaders, 10,000 Byzantine professional troops for the Crusade, the maintenance of 500 knights in the Holy Land, the service of the Byzantine navy to transport the Crusader Army to Egypt, and the placement of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] under the authority of the Pope, if they would sail to Byzantium and topple the reigning emperor [[Alexios III Angelos]], brother of Isaac II. This tempting offer, for an enterprise that was short on funds, reached the leaders of the Crusade on 1 January 1203 as they wintered at Zara.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jean|last=Richard|page=247|title=The Crusades c. 1071 \u2013 c. 1291|ISBN=0-521-62566-1}}</ref> Doge Dandolo was a fierce supporter of the plan; however, in his earlier capacity as an ambassador to Byzantium and someone who knew the finer details of how Byzantine politics worked, it is likely he knew the promises were false and there was no hope of any Byzantine emperor raising the money promised, let alone raising the troops and giving the church to the Holy See. Count Boniface agreed and Alexios IV returned with the Marquess to rejoin the fleet at [[Corfu]] after it had sailed from Zara. Most of the rest of the crusade's leaders, encouraged by bribes from Dandolo,<ref name=\"Runciman98\"/> eventually accepted the plan as well. However, there were dissenters. Led by [[Renaud of Montmirail]], those who refused to take part in the scheme to attack Constantinople sailed on to Syria.<ref name=\"Runciman98\"/> The remaining fleet of 60 [[war galley]]s, 100 [[Horse transports in the Middle Ages|horse transports]], and 50 large [[Troopship|transports]] (the entire fleet was manned by 10,000 Venetian oarsmen and marines) sailed in late April 1203.<ref name=\"Phillips269\">{{cite book\n| last = Phillips\n| first = Jonathan\n| title = The Fourth Crusade and the Sack of Constantinople\n| url = https://archive.org/details/fourthcrusadesac00phil_0\n| url-access = registration\n| publisher =Viking\n| location= New York\n| year = 2004\n| page=[https://archive.org/details/fourthcrusadesac00phil_0/page/269 269]\n| isbn =978-0-14-303590-9}}</ref> In addition, 300 siege engines were brought along on board the fleet.<ref name=\"siege\">Phillips.

At previous times in Byzantine history when the capital had come under direct threat, it had been possible to assemble reinforcements from frontier and provincial forces. On this occasion, the suddenness of the danger posed by the Fourth Crusade put the defenders at a serious disadvantage.<ref name=\"Nicolle49\">{{cite book\n| last = Nicolle\n| first = David\n| title = The Fourth Crusade 1202\u201304 \u2013 the Betrayal of Byzantium\n| publisher =Osprey Publishing Ltd\n| location= Oxford\n| year = 2011\n| page=41\n| isbn =978 1 84908 319 5}}</ref> The main objective of the crusaders was to place Alexios IV on the Byzantine throne so that they could receive the rich payments he had promised them. [[Conon of Bethune]] delivered this ultimatum to the Lombard envoy sent by the Emperor [[Alexios III Angelos]], who was the pretender's uncle and had seized the throne from the pretender's father Isaac II. The citizens of Constantinople were not concerned with the cause of the deposed emperor and his exiled son; hereditary right of succession had never been adopted by the empire and a palace coup between brothers was not considered illegitimate in the way it would have been in the West. First the crusaders attacked and were repulsed from the cities of [[Chalcedon]] and [[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar#Chrysopolis|Chrysopolis]], suburbs of the great city. They won a cavalry skirmish in which they were outnumbered, defeating 500 Byzantines with just 80 Frankish knights.<ref name=\"battle\">Phillips.

About 200 ships, horse transports, and [[galley]]s delivered the crusading army across the narrow strait, where Alexios III had lined up the Byzantine army in battle formation along the shore, north of the suburb of Galata. The Crusader knights charged straight out of the horse transports, and the Byzantine army fled south. The Crusaders followed and attacked the [[Galata Tower (old)|Tower of Galata]], which held the northern end of the massive chain that blocked access to the [[Golden Horn]]. The Tower of Galata held a garrison of mercenary troops of English, Danish, and Italian origin.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Andrea |first1=Alfred |title=Contemporary Sources For The Fourth Crusade |pages=191\u2013192}}</ref> On 6 July the largest ship in the crusaders' fleet, the ''Aquila'' (Eagle), broke the chain. A section of it was then sent to Acre to boost the defences in the Holy Land.<ref name=Kedar/>\n\nAs the crusaders laid siege to the Tower of Galata, the defenders routinely attempted to sally out with some limited success, but often suffered bloody losses. On one occasion the defenders sallied out but were unable to retreat back to the safety of the tower in time, the Crusader forces viciously counterattacked, with most of the defenders being cut down or drowning in the Bosporus in their attempts to escape.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Andrea |first1=Alfred |title=Contemporary Sources For The Fourth Crusade |page=193}}</ref> The tower was swiftly taken as a result. The Golden Horn now lay open to the Crusaders, and the Venetian fleet entered.  The Crusaders sailed alongside Constantinople with 10 galleys to display the would-be Alexios IV, but from the [[walls of Constantinople|walls of the city]] citizens taunted the puzzled crusaders, who had been led to believe that they would rise up to welcome the young pretender Alexios as a liberator.<ref name=\"taunt\">Phillips. ''The Fourth Crusade'', p. 164.</ref>\n\nOn 11 July, the Crusaders took positions opposite the [[Palace of Blachernae]] on the northwest corner of the city. Their first attempts were repulsed, but on 17 July, with four divisions attacking the land walls while the Venetian fleet attacked the sea walls from the Golden Horn, the Venetians took a section of the wall of about 25 towers, while the Varangian guard held off the Crusaders on the land wall. The Varangians shifted to meet the new threat, and the Venetians retreated under the screen of fire. The fire destroyed about {{convert|120|acre|km2}} of the city and left some 20,000 people homeless.<ref name=\"fire\">Phillips. ''The Fourth Crusade'', p. 176.</ref>\n\nAlexios III finally took offensive action, leading 17 divisions from the St. Romanus Gate, vastly outnumbering the crusaders. Alexios III's army of about 8,500 men faced the Crusaders' seven divisions (about 3,500 men), but his courage failed, and the Byzantine army returned to the city without a fight.<ref name=\"battle2\">Phillips. ''The Fourth Crusade'', p. 177.</ref> The unforced retreat and the effects of the fire greatly damaged morale, and the disgraced Alexios III abandoned his subjects, slipping out of the city and fleeing to [[Mosynopolis]] in [[Thrace]].<ref name=\"Runciman100\">Runciman, Steven.

The crusaders insisted that they would only recognize the authority of Isaac II if his son was raised to co-emperor, and on 1 August the latter was crowned as Alexios Angelos IV, co-emperor.<ref name=\"Runciman100\"/>\n\n=== Reign of Alexios IV ===\n[[File:PriseDeConstantinople1204PalmaLeJeune.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|Capture of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204]]\nAlexios IV realised that his promises were hard to keep. Alexios III had managed to flee with 1,000&nbsp;pounds of gold and some priceless jewels, leaving the imperial treasury short on funds. At that point the young emperor ordered the destruction and melting of valuable Byzantine and Roman icons in order to extract their gold and silver, but even then he could only raise 100,000 silver marks. In the eyes of all Greeks who knew of this decision, it was a shocking sign of desperation and weak leadership, which deserved to be punished by God. The Byzantine historian [[Nicetas Choniates]] characterized it as \"the turning point towards the decline of the Roman state\".<ref name=\"Phillips\">Phillips, ''The Fourth Crusade''</ref>\n\nForcing the populace to destroy their icons at the behest of an army of foreign schismatics did not endear Alexios IV to the citizens of Constantinople. In fear of his life, the co-emperor asked the crusaders to renew their contract for another six months, to end by April 1204. Alexios IV then led 6,000 men from the Crusader army against his rival Alexios III in Adrianople.<ref name = \"exp\"/> During the co-emperor's absence in August, rioting broke out in the city and a number of Latin residents were killed. In retaliation armed Venetians and other crusaders entered the city from the Golden Horn and attacked a [[mosque]] (Constantinople at this time had a sizable Muslim population), which was defended by Muslim and Byzantine residents {{citation needed|date=February 2018}}. In order to cover their retreat the Westerners instigated the \"Great Fire\", which burnt from 19 to 21 August, destroying a large part of Constantinople and leaving an estimated 100,000 homeless.\n\nIn January 1204, the blinded and incapacitated Isaac II died, probably of natural causes.<ref name=\"Phillips\"/> Opposition to his son and co-emperor Alexios IV had grown during the preceding months of tension and spasmodic violence in and around Constantinople. The [[Byzantine Senate]] elected a young noble [[Nicolas Canabus]] as emperor, in what was to be one of the last known acts of this ancient institution. However he declined the appointment and sought church sanctuary.<ref>''Chambers's Encyclopaedia'', vol. II, London, 1868, p. 471</ref>\n\nA nobleman [[Alexios V Doukas|Alexios Doukas]] (nicknamed Mourtzouphlos) became the leader of the anti-crusader faction within the Byzantine leadership. While holding the court rank of ''protovestilarios'', Doukas had led Byzantine forces during the initial clashes with the crusaders, winning respect from both military and populace. He was accordingly well-placed to move against the increasingly isolated Alexios IV, whom he overthrew, imprisoned, and had strangled in early February. Doukas then was crowned as Emperor Alexios V. He immediately moved to have the city fortifications strengthened and summoned additional forces to the city.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Nicolle\n| first = David\n| title = The Fourth Crusade 1202\u201304 \u2013 the Betrayal of Byzantium\n| publisher =Osprey Publishing Ltd\n| location= Oxford\n| year = 2011\n| pages= 25, 65\n| isbn =978 1 84908 319 5}}</ref>\n\n===War against Alexios V===\nThe crusaders and Venetians, incensed at the murder of their supposed patron, demanded that Mourtzouphlos honour the contract that Alexios IV had promised. When the Byzantine emperor refused, the Crusaders assaulted the city once again. On 8 April Alexios V's army put up a strong resistance, which did much to discourage the crusaders.<ref name=\"Phillips\"/> The Byzantines hurled large projectiles onto the enemy siege engines, shattering many of them. Bad weather conditions were a serious hindrance to the crusaders. A fierce wind blew from the shore and prevented most of the ships from drawing close enough to the walls to launch an assault. Only five of the wall's towers were actually engaged and none of these could be secured; by mid-afternoon it was evident that the attack had failed.<ref name=\"Phillips\"/>\n\nThe Latin clergy discussed the situation amongst themselves and settled upon the message they wished to spread through the demoralised army. They had to convince the men that the events of 9 April were not God's judgment on a sinful enterprise: the campaign, they argued, was righteous and with proper belief it would succeed. The concept of God testing the determination of the crusaders through temporary setbacks was a familiar means for the clergy to explain failure in the course of a campaign.<ref name=\"Phillips\"/> The clergy's message was designed to reassure and encourage the Crusaders. Their argument that the attack on Constantinople was spiritual revolved around two themes. First, the Greeks were traitors and murderers since they had killed their rightful lord, Alexios IV.<ref name=\"Phillips\"/> The churchmen used inflammatory language and claimed that \"the Greeks were worse than the Jews\",<ref name=\"Phillips\"/> and they invoked the authority of God and the pope to take action.\n\nAlthough Innocent III had again demanded that they not attack, the papal letter was suppressed by the clergy, and the crusaders prepared for their own attack, while the Venetians attacked from the sea. Alexios V's army stayed in the city to fight, along with the imperial bodyguard, the [[Varangians]], but Alexios V himself fled during the night. An attempt was made to find a further replacement emperor from amongst the Byzantine nobility, but the situation had now become too chaotic for either of the two candidates who came forward to find sufficient support.\n\nOn 12 April 1204, the weather conditions finally favoured the crusaders. A strong northern wind aided the Venetian ships in coming close to the walls, and after a short battle approximately seventy crusaders managed to enter the city. Some were able to knock holes in the walls, large enough for only a few knights at a time to crawl through; the Venetians were also successful at scaling the walls from the sea, though there was fighting with the Varangians. The Anglo-Saxon \"axe bearers\" had been amongst the most effective of the city's defenders, but they now attempted to negotiate higher wages from their Byzantine employers, before dispersing or surrendering.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Nicolle\n| first = David\n| title = The Fourth Crusade 1202\u201304 \u2013 the Betrayal of Byzantium\n| publisher =Osprey Publishing Ltd\n| location= Oxford\n| year = 2011\n| page= 77\n| isbn =978 1 84908 319 5}}</ref> The crusaders captured the [[Blachernae]] section of the city in the northwest and used it as a base to attack the rest of the city.

The most infamous action of the Fourth Crusade was the sack of the Orthodox Christian city of [[Constantinople]].]]\nThe crusaders sacked Constantinople for three days, during which many ancient Greco-Roman and medieval Byzantine works of art were stolen or ruined. Many of the civilian population of the city were killed and their property looted. Despite the threat of excommunication, the crusaders destroyed, defiled and looted the city's churches and monasteries.<ref name= \"Speros\"/><ref name= \"Hughes\"/> It was said that the total amount looted from Constantinople was about 900,000 silver marks. The Venetians received 150,000 silver marks that were their due, while the crusaders received 50,000 silver marks. A further 100,000 silver marks were divided evenly up between the crusaders and Venetians. The remaining 500,000 silver marks were secretly kept back by many crusader knights.<ref name=\"Ang\">Konstam, ''Historical Atlas of The Crusades'', 162</ref><ref name=\"Tread663\">W.

For three days they murdered, raped, looted and destroyed on a scale which even the ancient Vandals and Goths would have found unbelievable. Constantinople had become a veritable museum of ancient and Byzantine art, an emporium of such incredible wealth that the Latins were astounded at the riches they found. Though the Venetians had an appreciation for the art which they discovered (they were themselves semi-Byzantines) and saved much of it, the French and others destroyed indiscriminately, halting to refresh themselves with wine, violation of nuns, and murder of Orthodox clerics. The Crusaders vented their hatred for the Greeks most spectacularly in the desecration of the greatest Church in Christendom. They smashed the silver iconostasis, the icons and the holy books of [[Hagia Sophia]], and seated upon the patriarchal throne a whore who sang coarse songs as they drank wine from the Church's holy vessels. The estrangement of East and West, which had proceeded over the centuries, culminated in the horrible massacre that accompanied the conquest of Constantinople. The Greeks were convinced that even the Turks, had they taken the city, would not have been as cruel as the Latin Christians. The defeat of Byzantium, already in a state of decline, accelerated political degeneration so that the Byzantines eventually became an easy prey to the Turks. The Fourth Crusade and the crusading movement generally thus resulted, ultimately, in the victory of Islam, a result which was of course the exact opposite of its original intention.<ref name= \"Speros\">{{cite book\n| last = Vryonis\n| first = Speros\n| authorlink =Speros Vryonis\n| title = Byzantium and Europe\n| url = https://archive.org/details/byzantiumeurope00vryo\n| url-access = registration\n| publisher =Harcourt, Brace & World\n| location= New York\n| year =1967\n| page=[https://archive.org/details/byzantiumeurope00vryo/page/152 152]}}</ref>}}\n\nWhen Innocent III heard of the conduct of his pilgrims he was filled with shame and rage, and he strongly rebuked them.\n\n==Holy Land==\nThe main army that sailed from Venice to Constantinople experienced several waves of defections as men sought to fulfill their vows independently of the leadership. Most of them sailed directly from ports in [[Apulia]] (southern Italy) to Acre. According to Villehardouin, the majority of those who set out on the Fourth Crusade went to the Holy Land, while only a minority participated in the attack on Constantinople. Villehardouin, however, regarded those who went to the Holy Land as deserters of the main army and its leadership and he may have exaggerated their number in order to magnify the accomplishments of the minority that besieged Constantinople.<ref name=Kedar/><ref name=\"Queller et al.\">{{citation |author1=D.

[[Steven Runciman]] thought that only a \"tiny proportion\" and [[Joshua Prawer]] only some \"pitiful remnants\" of the original army arrived in the Holy Land. Recent studies suggest that the number was substantial but shy of a majority. Of the 92 named individuals who took the crusader vow in Villehardouin's account, between 23 and 26 of them went to the Holy Land. The rate of \"desertion\" seems highest among the French faction.<ref name=\"Queller et al.\"/> Only about a tenth of the knights who had taken the cross in Flanders arrived to reinforce the remaining Christian states in the Holy Land, but over half of those from the \u00cele-de-France did.

Before his death in May 1202, Fulk gave the money to the [[Abbey of C\u00eeteaux]]. Abbot [[Arnaud Amalric]] sent it to Acre in two installments. It was used to repair walls, towers and other defences that had been damaged by the [[1202 Syria earthquake|earthquake of May 1202]]. A second wall was even added at Acre sometime before 1212.<ref name=Kedar/>\n\n===Apulia to Acre===\nSeveral crusaders, instead of going on to Venice, turned south at [[Piacenza]] in the summer of 1202 intending to go directly to the Holy Land from ports in southern Italy. Among them were [[Vilain of Nully]], [[Henry of Arzilli\u00e8res]], [[Renard III of Dampierre-en-Astenois|Renard III of Dampierre]], [[Henry of Longchamp]] and Giles of Trasignies with their retinues. They do not seem to have been acting in concert or travelling together. Ultimately, several hundred knights and accompanying infantry reached the Holy Land via south Italian ports. The force was so small that King [[Aimery of Jerusalem]] refused to break his truce with the [[Ayyubids]] to allow them to go to war, despite the pleas of Renard, who was fulfilling the crusading vow of the late Count [[Theobald III of Champagne]] and possessed ample funds. As a result, eighty crusaders under Renard decided to go to the [[Principality of Antioch]], which had no such truce. Advised against such a move, they were ambushed on the road and all but one were killed or captured. Renard remained in captivity for thirty years.<ref name=\"Queller et al.\"/>\n\nWhen the crusade was diverted to Zara, many crusaders returned home or else remained behind in Italy. Some bypassed the Venetian fleet and found other means of going to the Holy Land. [[Geoffrey I of Villehardouin|Geoffrey of Villehardouin]], the historian's nephew, was one of them. [[Stephen du Perche (died 1205)|Stephen of the Perche]], was prevented from going with the main army on account of illness. Upon his recovery in March 1203, he took ship in southern Italy and travelled directly to the Holy Land with many others who had remained behind, including Rotrou of Montfort and Yves of La Jaille. Stephen re-joined the main army after the fall of Constantinople.<ref name=\"Queller et al.\"/>\n\nFollowing the siege of Zara, more contingents abandoned the main army. The crusaders sent Robert of Boves as an envoy to the pope, but after his mission was done he went straight to the Holy Land. Abbot Martin of Pairis joined him on the trip to Rome and afterwards took ship for Palestine at [[Siponto]]. Martin arrived in Acre on 25 April 1203 in the midst of an outbreak of plague. According to the ''[[Devastatio Constantinopolitana]]'', after the decision was made at Zara to place  Alexios IV on the throne of Constantinople, the leaders of the crusade granted permission for about 1,000 men to leave and find their own way to the Holy Land. In fact, about 2,000 men abandoned the main army at that stage. Most of them were among the poorer crusaders, and two ships carrying them sank with loss of life. The German crusader Garnier of Borland also abandoned the main army after Zara.<ref name=\"Queller et al.\"/>\n\nFrom Zara, an official embassy, led by [[Renaud of Montmirail]], was dispatched to the Holy Land. It included Herv\u00e9 of Ch\u00e2tel, [[Guillaume de Ferri\u00e8res|William III of Ferri\u00e8res]], Geoffrey of Beaumont and the brothers John and Peter of Frouville. They were supposed to return to the main army within fifteen days of accomplishing their mission. In fact, they remained in the Holy Land and did not return until after the fall of Constantinople.<ref name=\"Queller et al.\"/>\n\nIn the winter of 1203\u20131204, [[Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester|Simon V of Montfort]] led a large contingent of defectors disgusted with the attack on Zara and opposed to the Constantinople venture.

The Flemish fleet left Flanders in the summer of 1202 under the command of [[John II of Nesle]], [[Thierry of Flanders (died 1207)|Thierry of Flanders]] and [[Nicholas of Mailly]].{{efn|Nicholas of Mailly joined the main army after the fall of Constantinople.<ref name=\"Queller et al.\"/>}} It sailed into the Mediterranean and, according to the chronicler [[Ernoul]], attacked and captured an unnamed Muslim city on the African coast. The city was left in the hands of the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] and the fleet went on to [[Marseille]], where it wintered in 1202\u20131203. There the fleet was joined by a number of French crusaders, including Bishop [[Walter II (bishop of Autun)|Walter II of Autun]], Count [[Guigues III of Forez]], [[Bernard IV of Moreuil]], Henry of Arraines, Hugh of Chaumont, John of Villers, Peter Bromont and the brothers Walter and Hugh of Saint-Denis and their retinues.<ref name=\"Queller et al.\"/>\n\nThe pilots of Marseille had more experience sailing out of sight of land than those of any other Mediterranean port, having been doing it since the mid-12th century. In summer, they could make the trip to Acre in fifteen days. They possessed a fleet sufficient to transport the army of [[Richard the Lionheart]] on the [[Third Crusade]] in 1190. It was also a cheaper and more accessible port for the French contingent.<ref name=\"Queller et al.\"/>\n\nBaldwin sent orders to his fleet in Marseille to sail at the end of March 1203 and rendezvous with the Venetian fleet off [[Methoni, Messenia|Methoni]].{{efn|Baldwin of Flanders' wife, [[Marie of Champagne]], sailed from Marseille to Acre in the spring of 1204. She was there when she learned of his election as emperor.<ref name=\"Queller et al.\"/>}} His messengers must also have brought news of the decision to go to Constantinople before proceeding to the Holy Land. For this reason the  Flemish leaders may have opted to ignore the rendezvous and sail directly to Acre. It is also possible that they kept the rendezvous, but not finding the Venetian fleet (which did not get to Methoni before May) went on to Acre alone. They probably arrived there before Martin of Pairis on 25 April 1203.<ref name=\"Queller et al.\"/>\n\nThe Flemish crusaders encountered the same difficulty as Renard of Dampierre. King Aimery was unwilling to break his  truce for the sake of such a small army. The crusaders therefore split up. Some entered the service of the Principality of Antioch and others that of the [[County of Tripoli]]. Bernard of Moreuil and John of Villers joined Renard of Dampierre and were captured along with him. John of Nesle went to the aid of the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Kingdom of Armenia]] and thus found himself fighting some of his former comrades, since Armenia and Antioch were then at war. Sometime before 5 November 1203, however, the truce was broken. The Muslims seized two Christian ships and in retaliation the Christians had seized six Muslim ships. The Flemish crusaders returned to the Kingdom of Jerusalem to fight the infidel.<ref name=\"Queller et al.\"/>\n\nOn 8 November, Martin of Pairis and [[Conrad of Swartzenberg]] were sent to the main army, then besieging Constantinople, to press for it to continue on to the Holy Land now that the truce was broken. The envoys arrived on 1 January 1204, but the army was in the midst of heavy fighting and nothing came of their embassy.<ref name=\"Queller et al.\"/>\n\n== Outcomes ==\n===Partition of the Byzantine Empire===\n[[File:LatinEmpire2.png|thumb|300px|Partition of the Byzantine Empire into The [[Latin Empire]], [[Empire of Nicaea]], and [[Despotate of Epirus]] after 1204]]\n\nAccording to a [[Partitio terrarum imperii Romaniae|subsequent treaty]], the empire was apportioned between Venice and the leaders of the crusade, and the [[Latin Empire]] of Constantinople was established. Boniface was not elected as the new emperor, although the citizens seemed to consider him as such; the Venetians thought he had too many connections with the former empire because of his brother, [[Renier of Montferrat]], who had been married to [[Maria Komnene (daughter of Manuel I)|Maria Komnene]], empress in the 1170s and 1180s. Instead they placed [[Baldwin I of Constantinople|Baldwin of Flanders]] on the throne. Boniface went on to found the [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]], a vassal state of the new Latin Empire. The Venetians also founded the [[Duchy of the Archipelago]] in the Aegean Sea. Meanwhile, Byzantine refugees founded their own [[rump state]]s, the most notable of these being the [[Empire of Nicaea]] under [[Theodore I Laskaris|Theodore Laskaris]] (a relative of Alexios III), the [[Empire of Trebizond]], and the [[Despotate of Epirus]].\n\nThe Latin Empire was soon faced with a number of enemies. Besides the individual [[Rump state|Byzantine rump states]] in [[Epirus]] and [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]], and the also Christian [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]], there was also the [[Sultanate of R\u00fbm|Seljuk Sultanate]].

The legacy of the Fourth Crusade was the deep sense of betrayal felt by the Greek Christians. With the events of 1204, the schism between the Churches in the East and West was not just complete but also solidified.<ref>page 310, volume 5; \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Fifteenth Edition 1983, {{ISBN|0-85229-400-X}}</ref>\n\n=== East\u2013West schism ===\nAs an epilogue to the event, Pope Innocent III, the man who had unintentionally launched the ill-fated expedition, spoke against the crusaders thus:\n\n{{quotation|How, indeed, will the church of the Greeks, no matter how severely she is beset with afflictions and persecutions, return into ecclesiastical union and to a devotion for the Apostolic See, when she has seen in the Latins only an example of perdition and the works of darkness, so that she now, and with reason, detests the Latins more than dogs? As for those who were supposed to be seeking the ends of [[Jesus]] Christ, not their own ends, who made their swords, which they were supposed to use against the pagans, drip with Christian blood, they have spared neither religion, nor age, nor sex. They have committed incest, adultery, and fornication before the eyes of men. They have exposed both matrons and virgins, even those dedicated to God, to the sordid lusts of boys. Not satisfied with breaking open the imperial treasury and plundering the goods of princes and lesser men, they also laid their hands on the treasures of the churches and, what is more serious, on their very possessions. They have even ripped silver plates from the altars and have hacked them to pieces among themselves. They violated the holy places and have carried off crosses and relics.<ref>Pope Innocent III, ''Letters'', 126 (given July 12, 1205, and addressed to the papal legate, who had absolved the crusaders from their pilgrimage vows).

When the crusaders took some of the piles of money, jewels, and gold that they had captured in the sack of Constantinople back to Rome, Innocent III accepted the stolen items. Furthermore, at the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] the Pope welcomed and recognised to it western (Catholic) prelates from sees established in the conquered lands{{snd}} thus recognising their legitimacy over formerly Orthodox areas.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Latin rule in Greece===\n{{main|Frankokratia}}\nVarious Latin\u2013French lordships throughout Greece{{snd}} in particular, the [[Duchy of Athens]] and the [[Principality of Achaea|principality of the Morea]]{{snd}} provided cultural contacts with western Europe and promoted the study of Greek. There was also a French cultural work, notably the production of a collection of laws, the ''[[Assises de Romanie]]''. The ''[[Chronicle of Morea]]'' appeared in both [[French language|French]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] (and later Italian and Aragonese) versions. Impressive remains of crusader castles and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic churches]] can still be seen in Greece. Nevertheless, the Latin Empire always rested on shaky foundations.

He was one of the precursors of concrete and non-figurative art in Latin America. He used, for the first time in international art scene, water and [[neon|neon gas]] as part of an artwork. Light and movement were also present in his works.\n\nHe created [[monumental sculpture]]s, hydrospatial walks, hydrowalls, etc. He made more than 40 personal and 500 collective exhibitions all over the world.\n\n== Early career \u2013 1940s ==\nIn the early 1940s, Gyula started his first non-figurative drawings, paintings, and sculptures. He studied [[Leonardo da Vinci]]\u2019s work during this time, and also wrote texts and poems about interdisciplinary art.\n\nGyula Kosice\u2019s art career really started in 1944.

This was an art journal that had articles containing these artists\u2019 responses to constructivist art and poems. That same year, he went with this group of artists to host ''Artconcret invention'' and ''El movimiento de arte concreto-invenci\u00f3n'', a couple private exhibitions on constructivist art in private homes.

The meaning of the group has been called into question many times, but Kosice claimed that the word \u201c''[[Mad\u00ed]]''\u201d was made-up by the group and carried no meaning whatsoever.

He was invited by Del Morle and the governing board. He received the collaboration of the France Cultural Attach in Buenos Aires, M. Weibel Reichard.\n\nIn the late 1940s, Kosice was the first to use [[neon lighting]] in his artwork, using them to create non-representational patterns in what he called \"Hydrokinetism\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Late career and death (1950s\u20132016) ==\nIn the late 1950s, Gyula Kosice started to create his motorized \u201chydrokinetic\u201d sculptures that incorporated the use of [[Neon lighting|neon light]], Plexiglas, aluminum, and water. These sculptures were Kosice's experimentations with the perception of color, its motion, and how it can make the viewer feel visually unstable. The use of constantly shifting water combined with moving light was what created the feeling of instability as these elements were always in perpetual motion. These \u201chydrokinetic\u201d sculptures had their roots in the concrete art movement, however they truly fit and thrived in the kinetic art movement.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the 1970s, Kosice started the ''Ciudad Hidroespacial'' project that proposed creating a classless society by building an entirely new city. For many years, he worked on this project .\n\n== Legacy ==\nThroughout his lifetime, Gyula Kosice hosted more than 40 personal exhibitions and participated in 500 collective exhibitions all over the world.\n\nHe is remembered for his innovative contributions to the kinetic art movement in Argentina. He was the first to use neon light and gas, creating nonrepresentational patterns in his sculptures.

''Ciudad Hidroespacial'' consisted of many plexiglass models for architects to create a new large, self-sustaining cosmic city. It was also made of plastic, metal, and many other materials that were collaged onto pictures of cloudy skies.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Small list of exhibitions==\n\n1947\n* [[Galer\u00edas Pac\u00edfico]], Buenos Aires.

He was one of the most important figures in [[kinetic art|kinetic]] and luminal art and luminance vanguard.\n\nHe was born in an [[Hungarians in Slovakia|ethnic Hungarian family]] in 1924.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160806013737/http://www.kosice.com.ar/eng/sintesis-biografica.php Official webpage of Gyula Kosice]</ref> Kosice used his natal city name as artist name. He was one of the precursors of concrete and non-figurative art in Latin America. He used, for the first time in international art scene, water and [[neon|neon gas]] as part of an artwork. Light and movement were also present in his works.\n\nHe created [[monumental sculpture]]s, hydrospatial walks, hydrowalls, etc. He made more than 40 personal and 500 collective exhibitions all over the world.\n\n== Early Career - 1940s ==\nIn the early 1940s, Gyula started his first non-figurative drawings, paintings, and sculptures. He studied [[Leonardo da Vinci]]\u2019s work during this time, and also wrote texts and poems about interdisciplinary art.\n\nGyula Kosice\u2019s art career really started in 1944. The focus in his early art career was about concrete, nonobjective art and how it could radically change society for the better.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Latin American Artists of the Twentieth Century|last=Rasmussen|first=Waldo|last2=Bercht|first2=Fatima|last3=Ferrer|first3=Elizabeth|publisher=Museum of Modern Art|year=1993|isbn=9780810961210|location=Oxford|pages=97}}</ref> He worked alongside many other Argentinian artists who had the same mindset, publishing art journals with them. In 1944, he started his first art group, ''Arturo'', by collaborating with [[Carmelo Arden Quin]], [[Rhod Rothfuss]] and [[Joaqu\u00edn Torres-Garc\u00eda|Torres-Garc\u00eda]]. This was an art journal that had articles containing these artists\u2019 responses to constructivist art and poems. That same year, he went with this group of artists to host ''Artconcret invention'' and ''El movimiento de arte concreto-invenci\u00f3n'', a couple private exhibitions on constructivist art in private homes. One of these private exhibitions was in the home of photographer [[Grete Stern]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Latin American Artists of the Twentieth Century|last=Rasmussen|first=Waldo|last2=Bercht|first2=Fatima|last3=Ferrer|first3=Elizabeth|publisher=Museum of Modern Art|year=1993|isbn=9780810961210|location=Oxford|pages=87}}</ref>\n\nIn 1945, Kosice and the same group of artists went on to create an entirely new group in [[Buenos Aires]] that was known as the ''Arte Concreto Invenci\u00f3n''. This group was particularly influential to the art community, inspiring many other art groups to begin such as the major concrete art group ''Associati\u00f3n Arte Concreto-Invenci\u00f3n'' (led by [[Tom\u00e1s Maldonado|Tomas Maldonado]] and consisted of [[Manuel Espinosa]], [[Lidy Prati]], [[Enio Iommi]], Alfredo Hilto and Ra\u00fal Lozza along with four of his brothers).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Twentieth-Century Art of Latin America|last=Barnitz|first=Jacqueline|last2=Frank|first2=Patrick|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2001|isbn=9781477308042|location=Austin, TX|pages=148}}</ref>\n\nIn 1946, Gyula Kosice started the ''[[Grupo Mad\u00ed]]'' alongside Carmelo Arden Quin, Rhod Ruthfuss and Mart\u00edn Blaszco. The meaning of the group has been called into question many times, but Kosice claimed that the word \u201c''[[Mad\u00ed]]''\u201d was made-up by the group and carried no meaning whatsoever. The main concern of this group was to reach out beyond the art community and to encourage people in all creative disciplines (such as dancers, architects, and actors) to carry the \u201c''Mad\u00ed'' spirit\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World of Abstract Art|last=|first=|publisher=George Wittenborn Inc|year=1956|isbn=|editor-last=The American Abstract Artists|location=Great Britain|pages=78}}</ref> They did this by including articles in their published journals on poems written by others, general art theories, reports on musical events, photos of other exhibitions, and a \u201c''Mad\u00ed'' Dictionary\u201d. Over the next few years, he hosted many international exhibitions with this group of artists.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Twentieth-Century Art of Latin America|last=Barnitz|first=Jacqueline|last2=Frank|first2=Patrick|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2001|isbn=9781477308042|location=Austin, TX|pages=149\u2013150}}</ref> Kosice wrote the Madi Manifesto, where he explained that Madi art is the \"absolute value\" of the presence and theme of the work, and that it was only to be expressed by the unique formal characteristics of the creative discipline that it was made in, and nothing more. His examples were painting with color on a two-dimensional surface, or creating a sculpture that has \"movement\" but not adding or changing color.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Latin American Artists of the Twentieth Century|last=Rasmussen|first=Waldo|last2=Bercht|first2=Fatima|last3=Ferrer|first3=Elizabeth|publisher=Museum of Modern Art|year=1993|isbn=9780810961210|location=Oxford|pages=88}}</ref>\n\nIn 1947, Kosice hosted his first personal exhibition of Mad\u00ed Art at the Bohemien Club in [[Galer\u00edas Pac\u00edfico]] (Buenos Aires, Argentina), which was the first totally non-figurative exhibition in Latin-America.\n\nIn 1948, he was involved in a Mad\u00ed exhibition at R\u00e9alit\u00e9s Nouvelles, Paris. He was invited by Del Morle and the governing board. He received the collaboration of the France Cultural Attach in Buenos Aires, M. Weibel Reichard.\n\nIn the late 1940s, Kosice was the first to use [[neon lighting]] in his artwork, using them to create non-representational patterns in what he called \"Hydrokinetism\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Late Career and Death (1950's - 2016) ==\nIn the late 1950s, Gyula Kosice started to create his motorized \u201chydrokinetic\u201d sculptures that incorporated the use of [[Neon lighting|neon light]], Plexiglas, aluminum, and water. These sculptures were Kosice\u2019s experimentations with the perception of color, its motion, and how it can make the viewer feel visually unstable. The use of constantly shifting water combined with moving light was what created the feeling of instability as these elements were always in perpetual motion. These \u201chydrokinetic\u201d sculptures had their roots in the concrete art movement, however they truly fit and thrived in the kinetic art movement.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the 1970s, Kosice started the ''Ciudad Hidroespacial'' project that proposed creating a classless society by building an entirely new city.
