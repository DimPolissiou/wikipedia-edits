Martha died in 1778 while giving birth to the third son. Life on the frontier was tumultuous, and the Indians' continual raiding led to a reprisal by the Virginia's Royal Governor, Lord Dunmore. In 1774 Posey was in the quartermaster's department of an armed expedition against the Indians who were threatening the frontier settlements.<ref>Sparks, p. 365</ref> He was present at the [[Battle of Point Pleasant]], and the expedition succeeded in suppressing the Indians for the short term.<ref name = g34>Gugin, p. 34</ref>\n\n===Revolutionary War===\nPosey was elected a member of the [[Virginia]] [[committee of correspondence]] in 1775.<ref>Sparks, p. 372</ref> He served in the army during the [[American Revolutionary War|War of Independence]], first as a captain in the [[Continental Army]], mostly with the [[7th Virginia Regiment]], then later rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1782. Some claimed his quick rise was due to the patronage of [[George Washington]]. During the war Posey led campaigns against Lord Dunmore who was fortified on Gwyn's Island and drove him and his naval support out of the area. Lord Dunmore had been the officer he served under during the Indian war. In the winter of 1775 the 7th Virginia Regiment marched to join with General [[George Washington]] in [[New Jersey]]. It was at this time that Washington promoted Posey to the rank of Captain.<ref>Sparks, p. 376</ref> During the winter of 1776, Posey commanded the pickets guarding the [[Valley Forge]] encampment and led skirmishes almost daily. The following campaigning season, his corps was involved in the battle to drive Gen. Howe back to [[New York City]], and played a critical role in the [[Battle of Monmouth]]. In 1778 Capt. Posey replaced [[Daniel Morgan]] as commander of the [[Provisional Rifle Corps]] when it was reduced to two companies. His small unit was sent to upstate [[New York (state)|New York]] to help secure that frontier flank of the Continental Army's Highland Department.<ref name = g34/><ref>Sparks, p. 378</ref> He was promoted to major and given command of the [[7th Virginia Regiment]] on December 20, 1778.\n\nIn July 1779 Posey was assigned to command a battalion of light infantry in Corps of Light Infantry commanded by Brig-Gen. [[Anthony Wayne]]. As part of the provisional 1st Regiment under Col. [[Christian Febiger]], he led his battalion in a bayonet night assault to [[Battle of Stony Point|storm Stony Point]], a key British position on the [[Hudson River]] near West Point. Posey was one of the first to enter the British works and seized the colors of the [[17th Regiment of Foot]].<ref name = g34/><ref>Sparks, p. 380</ref>\n\nIn his absence, the 7th Virginia regiment was ordered on December 8, 1779, to join the rest of the Virginia Line to march to [[Charleston, South Carolina]], to join the Southern Army. When the Corps of Light Infantry disbanded in December, Posey was sent to join his regiment, but the army surrendered on May 12, 1780, before he could rejoin it. As one of the few uncaptured Virginia officers, Posey had few duties until exchange of captured soldiers occurred in early 1781, at which time Col. Febiger recruited him to help reconstitute the Virginia Line in a new \"18-month\" battalion. He became de facto commander of the battalion and served in the [[siege of Yorktown]]. During 1781\u20131782 he served with General Wayne again, this time in Georgia against the forces in Savannah. He was promoted to Lt. Col. in 1782.<ref>Sparks, p. 381</ref><ref name = g35>Gugin, p. 35</ref>\n\nWhen the war ended, Posey returned to Virginia having resigned from the army on March 10, 1783.  In the same year he became an original member of the Virginia [[Society of the Cincinnati]].\n\nHe took guardianship of his surviving son who had been living with friends since the death of his mother. Posey married Mary Alexander Thornton, the wealthy widow of George Thornton, in 1784. Posey had nine children by her. He remained married to her until his death. The family lived on her [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]] plantation, where Posey farmed for nearly eighteen years. He ran an unsuccessful campaign for the United States House of Representatives in 1797, and held several appointed position in the Virginia state government.<ref name = g35/>\n\nPosey briefly returned to the military following several setbacks to the army which was campaigning against the [[Wabash Confederacy]] in the [[Old Northwest]]. He reentered the army as a [[brigadier general]] in 1793 and served with \"Mad\" [[Anthony Wayne]] campaigning against the Indians beyond the frontier in the [[Northwest Indian War]].<ref>Sparks, p. 392</ref> Posey was disturbed by the actions of second in command, General [[James Wilkinson]]. Wilkinson had been secretly undermining Wayne's authority in reports to Washington, and Posey discovered that Wilkinson had been involved in similar plots against other ranking officers, including the former frontier commander [[George Rogers Clark]]. Years after Wilkinson's death, it was discovered that he had been accepting bribery money from [[Spain]] to stir up trouble on the frontier. Because of the ill feelings caused by Wilkinson, Posey resigned from the army again on February 20, 1794, only a few months before the war was ended following American victory at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]].<ref name = g36>Gugin, p. 36</ref>\n\n==Public office==\n\n===Kentucky and Louisiana===\n\nIn 1802, Posey received {{convert|7000|acre|ha}} in reward for his military service, and he was given several options of land tracts in the western United States. He chose land near [[Henderson, Kentucky]] and moved his family to the new estate. His prestige made him immediately popular in the area and he was elected to the [[Kentucky State Senate]], beginning a term on November 10, 1804 and became the body's speaker. In 1805 he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky, serving a brief term. He was a candidate for governor in 1808, but withdrew to support [[Charles Scott (governor)|Charles Scott]].<ref name = g36/><ref name=s395>Sparks, p. 395</ref>\n\nIn preparation for possible hostilities with the French and British, in 1809 Congress authorized an army of 100,000 men to be mobilized. Kentucky was assigned the task of providing five thousand men. Posey returned to the army as a Major General in command of the Kentucky militia. He oversaw an organization of the militia to ready them for the war before he resigned from in 1810.<ref name= s395/> He then moved to the Attakapas region of [[Louisiana]], and was appointed by the governor to serve as a U.S. Senator from that state in 1812\u20131813 to fill the vacant seat of [[Jean Noel Destr\u00e9han]] after his resignation. In [[Washington D.C.]] he also assisted the Acting Secretary of War in preparing war plans.<ref name = g36/><ref>Sparks, p. 399</ref>\n\n===Indiana Territory===\n\nAfter he was defeated for re-election to his senate seat, he was appointed by President [[James Madison]] to be Governor of [[Indiana Territory]] in February 1813 where he succeeded [[William Henry Harrison]] who had accepted a new position to lead the army against Indians in the [[Northwest Territory]].<ref>Cockrum, p. 377</ref> When he arrived he relieved [[John Gibson (Indiana)|John Gibson]] of his duties as acting-governor. The Territorial General Assembly, who had been strongly opposed to the previous governor, took the absence of a strong governor to enact several pieces of legislation it had been trying to force Harrison to pass for several years, including the move of the capital. The assembly was unhappy with Posey's appointment, hoping to have instead received a northern governor who was opposed to slavery and more agreeable to the prevailing mood of the territory. He arrived in the new capital of [[Corydon, Indiana|Corydon]] in December 1813 where he delivered a conciliatory speech to the assembly.<ref name = g37>Gugin, p. 37</ref>\n\nPosey was considered to be a charitable and personally likable man in the territory. He was an active member of the [[Presbyterian Church]] and became president of a Bible Society, who distributed free Bibles to the poor.<ref>Woollen, p. 28</ref> Posey disliked the small capitol, and because of his poor health he wanted to be closer to a physician in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. During the middle of the first General Assembly session, Posey moved to [[Jeffersonville, Indiana|Jeffersonville]] where he remained for the duration of his tenure, and from there conducted the office of governor. He communicated with the legislature in Corydon by courier.<ref>Cockrum, p. 383</ref> The legislature was offended by his absence, which they portrayed as a continuation of the previous governor's alleged aristocratic tendencies and issued a resolution that rebuked him for leaving.<ref name = g37/>\n\nPosey's most important act as governor was to reorganize the territorial courts. In 1815 Posey called a special session of the assembly to meet in Corydon to create a new territorial judiciary. The existing judiciary's authority was in question because the courts had been created at a time when no authority had been granted by Congress to create their offices. Posey presided over the assembly which ultimately divided the territory into three judicial districts and appointed several judges.<ref>Cockrum, p. 398</ref> The legislature was pleased to find that Posey's appointments to public office were not overly partisan, and were happy with his approval of road construction and the framework he created for basic educational facilities. He also approved the charter for the [[Bank of Vincennes]], the first in the territory leading to considerable economic advancement.<ref name = g37/>\n\nDespite his attempts to please the territory's population, he was widely disliked by the legislature for his \"inaccessibility\", and his pro-slavery sentiments were at odds with that of the anti-slavery dominated territory. He was the frequent victim of speaker [[Dennis Pennington]]'s huaranging speeches. Although statehood was approved during his term, he is considered to have had little impact on it, and instead attempted to delay it. In a speech he delivered, he claimed the territory's population was too sparse to bear the taxation that would be necessary to effectually grow the state, and instead recommended remaining a territory for a longer period to continue receiving federal financial assistance. The legislature pressed for statehood, and the territory's congressman [[Jonathan Jennings]] proposed federal legislation to approve statehood. When Indiana became a state in 1816, he ran unsuccessfully for Governor and was defeated by Jennings, 5,211 to 3,934 votes.<ref name = g37/> A key election issue causing the dislike of Posey was that he was in favor of slavery in Indiana, which much of the legislature, Dennis Pennington, and Jonathan Jennings opposed.<ref name = g37/><ref>Baird, Lewis. ''Baird's History of Clark County, Indiana'', (1909) pg.60</ref><ref>Cockrum, p. 392</ref>\n\n===Later life===\nIn the last two years of his life, he served as an [[Indian agent]] in [[Illinois]], negotiating treaties with the [[Wea]], [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]], and [[Pottawatomie]].  He was appointed Indian Agent of Helios's in 1816.<ref>Sparks, p. 402</ref>  He was a candidate for Congress again in 1817, hoping to be elected to Jennings' now vacant seat in Congress, but was overwhelming defeated by [[William Hendricks]].  He died of [[Typhus]] fever on March 19, 1818 in [[Shawneetown, Illinois]], aged 67, and was buried in the Westwood Cemetery.<ref>Gugin, p. 38</ref>  [[Posey County, Indiana]], and [[Posey Township, Franklin County, Indiana]].<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QVE0AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA122#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=History of Franklin County, Indiana | publisher=Windmill Publications | author=Reifel, August Jacob | year=1915 | pages=122}}</ref> were named in honor of Thomas Posey.\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n;Bibliography\n*{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=308lAAAAMAAJ|title=Pioneer History of Indiana, |author=Cockrum, William Monroe | year=1907 | publisher=Press of Oakland City journal}}\n*{{cite book|editor=Gugin, Linda C.|editor2=St. Clair, James E|title=The Governors of Indiana|publisher=Indiana Historical Society Press|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|year=2006|isbn=0-87195-196-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780871951960}}\n*{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RBsNAAAAIAAJ|title= The Library of American Biograph|author=Sparks, Jared | year=1846 | publisher=Hilliard, Gray and co.}}\n*{{cite book|title=Biographical and Historical Sketches of Early Indiana|year=1975|author=Woollen, William Wesley|publisher=Ayer Publishing|isbn=0-405-06896-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PCbZ8rS-84gC}}\n\n;Further reading\n*Cecere, Michael.

Because of the ill feelings caused by Wilkinson, Posey resigned from the army again on February 20, 1794, only a few months before the war was ended following American victory at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]].<ref name = g36>Gugin, p. 36</ref>\n\n==Public office==\n\n===Kentucky and Louisiana===\n\nIn 1802, Posey received {{convert|7000|acre|ha}} in reward for his military service, and he was given several options of land tracts in the western United States. He chose land near [[Henderson, Kentucky]] and moved his family to the new estate. His prestige made him immediately popular in the area and he was elected to the [[Kentucky State Senate]], beginning a term on November 10, 1804 and became the body's speaker. In 1805 he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky, serving a brief term. He was a candidate for governor in 1808, but withdrew to support [[Charles Scott (governor)|Charles Scott]].<ref name = g36/><ref name=s395>Sparks, p. 395</ref>\n\nIn preparation for possible hostilities with the French and British, in 1809 Congress authorized an army of 100,000 men to be mobilized. Kentucky was assigned the task of providing five thousand men. Posey returned to the army as a Major General in command of the Kentucky militia. He oversaw an organization of the militia to ready them for the war before he resigned from in 1810.<ref name= s395/> He then moved to the Attakapas region of [[Louisiana]], and was appointed by the governor to serve as a U.S. Senator from that state in 1812\u20131813 to fill the vacant seat of [[Jean Noel Destr\u00e9han]] after his resignation. In [[Washington D.C.]] he also assisted the Acting Secretary of War in preparing war plans.<ref name = g36/><ref>Sparks, p. 399</ref>\n\n===Indiana Territory===\n\nAfter he was defeated for re-election to his senate seat, he was appointed by President [[James Madison]] to be Governor of [[Indiana Territory]] in February 1813 where he succeeded [[William Henry Harrison]] who had accepted a new position to lead the army against Indians in the [[Northwest Territory]].<ref>Cockrum, p. 377</ref> When he arrived he relieved [[John Gibson (Indiana)|John Gibson]] of his duties as acting-governor. The Territorial General Assembly, who had been strongly opposed to the previous governor, took the absence of a strong governor to enact several pieces of legislation it had been trying to force Harrison to pass for several years, including the move of the capital. The assembly was unhappy with Posey's appointment, hoping to have instead received a northern governor who was opposed to slavery and more agreeable to the prevailing mood of the territory. He arrived in the new capital of [[Corydon, Indiana|Corydon]] in December 1813 where he delivered a conciliatory speech to the assembly.<ref name = g37>Gugin, p. 37</ref>\n\nPosey was considered to be a charitable and personally likable man in the territory. He was an active member of the [[Presbyterian Church]] and became president of a Bible Society, who distributed free Bibles to the poor.<ref>Woollen, p. 28</ref> Posey disliked the small capitol, and because of his poor health he wanted to be closer to a physician in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. During the middle of the first General Assembly session, Posey moved to [[Jeffersonville, Indiana|Jeffersonville]] where he remained for the duration of his tenure, and from there conducted the office of governor. He communicated with the legislature in Corydon by courier.<ref>Cockrum, p. 383</ref> The legislature was offended by his absence, which they portrayed as a continuation of the previous governor's alleged aristocratic tendencies and issued a resolution that rebuked him for leaving.<ref name = g37/>\n\nPosey's most important act as governor was to reorganize the territorial courts. In 1815 Posey called a special session of the assembly to meet in Corydon to create a new territorial judiciary. The existing judiciary's authority was in question because the courts had been created at a time when no authority had been granted by Congress to create their offices. Posey presided over the assembly which ultimately divided the territory into three judicial districts and appointed several judges.<ref>Cockrum, p. 398</ref> The legislature was pleased to find that Posey's appointments to public office were not overly partisan, and were happy with his approval of road construction and the framework he created for basic educational facilities. He also approved the charter for the [[Bank of Vincennes]], the first in the territory leading to considerable economic advancement.<ref name = g37/>\n\nDespite his attempts to please the territory's population, he was widely disliked by the legislature for his \"inaccessibility\", and his pro-slavery sentiments were at odds with that of the anti-slavery dominated territory. He was the frequent victim of speaker [[Dennis Pennington]]'s huaranging speeches. Although statehood was approved during his term, he is considered to have had little impact on it, and instead attempted to delay it. In a speech he delivered, he claimed the territory's population was too sparse to bear the taxation that would be necessary to effectually grow the state, and instead recommended remaining a territory for a longer period to continue receiving federal financial assistance. The legislature pressed for statehood, and the territory's congressman [[Jonathan Jennings]] proposed federal legislation to approve statehood. When Indiana became a state in 1816, he ran unsuccessfully for Governor and was defeated by Jennings, 5,211 to 3,934 votes.<ref name = g37/> A key election issue causing the dislike of Posey was that he was in favor of slavery in Indiana, which much of the legislature, Dennis Pennington, and Jonathan Jennings opposed.<ref name = g37/><ref>Baird, Lewis. ''Baird's History of Clark County, Indiana'', (1909) pg.60</ref><ref>Cockrum, p. 392</ref>\n\n===Later life===\nIn the last two years of his life, he served as an [[Indian agent]] in [[Illinois]], negotiating treaties with the [[Wea]], [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]], and [[Pottawatomie]].  He was appointed Indian Agent of Helios's in 1816.<ref>Sparks, p. 402</ref>  He was a candidate for Congress again in 1817, hoping to be elected to Jennings' now vacant seat in Congress, but was overwhelming defeated by [[William Hendricks]].  He died of [[Typhus]] fever on March 19, 1818 in [[Shawneetown, Illinois]], aged 67, and was buried in the Westwood Cemetery.<ref>Gugin, p. 38</ref>  [[Posey County, Indiana]], and [[Posey Township, Franklin County, Indiana]]<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QVE0AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA122#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=History of Franklin County, Indiana | publisher=Windmill Publications | author=Reifel, August Jacob | year=1915 | pages=122}}</ref>. were named in honor of Thomas Posey.\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n;Bibliography\n*{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=308lAAAAMAAJ|title=Pioneer History of Indiana, |author=Cockrum, William Monroe | year=1907 | publisher=Press of Oakland City journal}}\n*{{cite book|editor=Gugin, Linda C.|editor2=St. Clair, James E|title=The Governors of Indiana|publisher=Indiana Historical Society Press|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|year=2006|isbn=0-87195-196-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780871951960}}\n*{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RBsNAAAAIAAJ|title= The Library of American Biograph|author=Sparks, Jared | year=1846 | publisher=Hilliard, Gray and co.}}\n*{{cite book|title=Biographical and Historical Sketches of Early Indiana|year=1975|author=Woollen, William Wesley|publisher=Ayer Publishing|isbn=0-405-06896-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PCbZ8rS-84gC}}\n\n;Further reading\n*Cecere, Michael.

Pellow's chronicles his many adventures spent during his 23-year-long captivity (summer 1715 \u2013 July 1738) giving a detailed account of his capture by [[Barbary pirates]], his experiences as a slave under Sultan [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Moulay Ismail]], and his final escape from [[Morocco]] back to his Cornish origins.\n\nHis captivity began at the age of eleven when sailing abroad in the summer of 1716 when his ship was attacked by Barbary pirates after crossing the [[Bay of Biscay]] traveling with his uncle, John Pellow, who was the ship's captain alongside five Englishmen. Pellow and his shipmates were taken captive and delivered to Sultan Moulay Ismail of Morocco as prisoners. Pellow was one of the individuals hand picked by the sultan along with three others and integrated into one of Ismail's many slaves. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Life as a Slave==\n\nThomas Pellow, after being pulled aside by the Sultan, was led into the armoury where he and others were tasked with cleaning the arms and cases belonging to the Sultan and his army, though he did not stay doing that for long as he was soon given by the emperor to his son, Muley Spha.\n\nMuley Spha was known to be an unsavoury individual and for giving his slaves futile tasks to perform, such as running morning to night after his (Muley Spha's) horse's heels. Then when Muley Spha noticed how bright Pellow was he, instead of beating him as was his custom, he tried to convince him to convert to Islam, promising him gifts and a better life as one of his esteemed friends. After all the bribes and temptations had been rejected, Muley Spha became infuriated and began to torture Pellow. \"[He] committed me prisoner to one of his own rooms, keeping me there several months in irons, and every day most severely [[Foot whipping|bastinading]] me.\" Eventually, after weeks and weeks of horrendous torture, Pellow gave in and was forced to convert. After a time, Moulay Ismail ordered his son to bring Pellow so that he could go to school and learn the Moorish language. When Muley Spha disobeyed this order, he was summoned by the sultan and killed right before Pellow. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/whitegoldextraor00milt/page/80|title=White Gold: The Extraordinary Story of Thomas Pellow and Islam's One Million White Slaves|last=Milton|first=Giles|date=2005|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780374289355|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/whitegoldextraor00milt/page/80 80\u201386]|language=en|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nWith time, Moulay Ismail assigned Pellow into the '[[Black Guard|Abid al-Bukhari]]'. According to Pellow\u2019s text, white European converts could rise within the Moroccan military system, but were confined to their own separate fighting units. These units were generally much less important to Ismail\u2019s government and military operations than their counterparts in the \u2018Abid. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Beach|first=Adam R.|date=2013|title=African Slaves, English Slave Narratives, and Early Modern Morocco|journal=Eighteenth-Century Studies|volume=46|issue=3|pages=333\u2013348|issn=0013-2586|jstor=23524203|doi=10.1353/ecs.2013.0023}}</ref>\n\n== Marriage and Pellow ==\n\nThroughout his narrative, Pellow only mentions his marriage a few times. Most of the writing we can see on his marriage comes from his detailing of the [[collective wedding]] where he received his wife as a reward from Moulay Ismail.<ref name=\":3\" /> He also mentions his wife's family and the status of his new brother-in-law shortly after he describes his wedding, but he references his wife and children only a few other times in the latter portions of his narrative.\n\nIsmail may have been marrying his slaves to reward them for their service, but he also would have befitted from the enslaved children that would have resulted from enslaved marriages. Pellow never states that his wife was a slave, so we do not know if his children were born slaves. These marriages would have also made the prospect of escape more difficult for slaves who grew fond of their spouses, as these slaves would either need to abandon their spouses or risk increasing their visibility by escaping with at least one other person.\n\nPellow never had to consider if he wanted to bring his wife and daughter with him when he successfully escaped, as they had both died while he was campaigning as a slave-soldier. In response to the news that his family was dead, he wrote \u201cI thought them to be by far better off than they could have been in this troublesome World, especially this Part of it ; and I was really very glad that they were delivered out of it, and therefore it gave me very little uneasiness.\"<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Pellow as an elite slave ==\nThomas Pellow's extensive [[slave narrative]] ''The History of the Long Captivity and Adventures of Thomas Pellow'' chronicles the contingent captivity of an twelve-year-old [[Christianity|Christian]] cabin boy and his development into an elite military slave during the reign of Moroccan Sultan [[Zidan Abu Maali|Mulay Zidan]]. From the age 12, Pellow was plucked from preadolescence and placed on a rigorous track leading to his eventual military role as a preeminent captain in the [[Moroccan Army]]. Elite slaves like Thomas Pellow played an extraordinary role in the armed forces, often serving as soldiers and as officers, leading to the acquisition of important roles in [[Administration (government)|administration]], [[politics]], and all aspects of public affairs.\n\nPellow as part of this world was only one of many European males who were taken and placed into military slavery. Pellow was part of a \"band of European slaves mixed among other races that formed an elite army corps.\"<ref name=\"Fischer\">{{Cite book|title=Slavery and Muslim Society in Africa|last=Fischer|first=Allan|publisher=C. Hurst & Company|year=1970|isbn=|location=London|pages=130}}</ref> Pellow as one of these elite members fought on the frontlines with ferocious proficiency, and his role in combat was primarily as  an \"infantryman.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Arming Slaves: From Classical Times to the Modern Age|last=Brown|first=Christopher|publisher=New Haven|year=2006|isbn=|location=London|pages=67}}</ref>  Being that these slave soldiers were infantrymen, the monarchs viewed their role in their armies as \u201can integral, perhaps a primary, part of the conquering Ottoman army.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> However, despite their value, these soldiers were regulated as servile classes and \"were not allowed to carry a sword, nor to carry an iron spear, these being distinctions of a free man, but slaves did carry some sort of weapon.\"<ref name=\"Fischer\" /> The only place these men would have carried a proper weapon was on the battlefield.\n\nVery soon after Pellow's Barbary capture and conversion to [[Islam]], he goes on a forward track towards his elite slave stature. Pellow was educated to speak [[Arabic]], as well as how to perform Moroccan social customs. From roughly the age of 12, Thomas Pellow was given the responsibility of managing 80 slave boys. Pellow's excelled in his new position and eventually was transferred into the Palace to work as a personal attendant for [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Moulay Ismail]]'s son, Mulai Zidan. Pellow's close proximity to the monarch's family exposed him to the many forms of capricious violence the Mulai family often employed. During his time there he witnessed the Zidan murder, his favourite black slave for disturbing two pigeons that Zidan was observing. His role as Zidan's personal attendant was a preparatory grooming technique that tested Pellow's ability to care for the monarch.\n\nHaving a primary account of the wrath of Moulay Ismail no doubt prepared Pellow for witnessing the many capricious killings performed by the [[sultan]]. In the narrative, Pellow expresses the daily anxieties he was forced to live amongst as compared to how law is enforced in [[England]].\n\nPellow was considered a valuable slave. He was conditioned to live in constant fear of his life being ended at a moment's notice. This mental conditioning clearly compromised all relationships Pellow had with the Mulai family. Renowned slavery scholar [[Orlando Patterson]] maintains Pellow's anxieties about master relations with the following: No authentic human relationship was possible where violence was the ultimate sanction. There could be no trust, no genuine sympathy; and while a kind of love may sometimes have triumphed over this perverse form of interaction, intimacy was usually calculation, and sadomasochistic (12).\n\nAs Pellow became an adult, Ismail promoted him to a high status military position. Thomas Pellow was made an officer in the sultan's army and participated in three military campaigns. He led other slave-soldiers into battle and once took part in a slave-gathering expedition in sub-Saharan Africa. Pellow eventually fled Morocco by boarding an Irish ship and returned home in the summer of 1738.\n\n== Slave army ==\nAfter being the personal slave for the Sultan's son, Pellow eventually joined the Sultan's army\u2014an army that consisted almost entirely of slave-soldiers who had been captured as young children and indoctrinated.  Pellow was made an officer in the slave army. Unlike all other military slaves, who spend their lives training for war<ref>http://www.danielpipes.org/448/military-slaves-a-uniquely-muslim-phenomenon</ref>, Pellow joined the sultan's army later in life. He led other slave-soldiers into battle and once took part in a slave-gathering expedition in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. \n\nThere was a stark difference between the independent renegades encountered in the narrative and their slave counterparts, \u201cAs the mercenaries or allies, they retained their own loyalties, but as slaves, they could be subjected to reorientation. Prior to enrollment in the army, they were prepared for service; the government secured their loyalty and fitted their military skills to the needs of the army.\u201d<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Pipes|first=Daniel|date=1979|title=The strategic rationale for military slavery |journal=Journal of Strategic Studies|language=en|volume=2|issue=1|pages=42 |doi=10.1080/01402397908437012 |issn=0140-2390}}</ref> Unlike the free-thinking allies and mercenaries for hire, a slave\u2019s life depended on their masters. They were trained to fight and forced into combat against their will. As such, the process of making them submissive to their masters was a long and arduous one by which they were beaten into shape and into a fearful loyalty to their masters. The alien soldiers were isolated figures whose isolation and alienation caused them to adopt what they were left with as normality. \"He took them from their homeland to a strange country and cut them off from the rest of the society. They had no choice but to accept the affiliations provided them and to become loyal to him. They developed close relations with their comrades, all of whom shared a similar predicament.\"<ref name=\":5\" /> These slaves were held on a tight leash and their indoctrination, while isolating, helped them to form what bonds that they could amongst themselves.\n\nNot only were they treated badly in living situations but they were also beaten. The emperor would say that he would do these cruel acts to the slaves to see if they were hard enough, if they were prepared to fight in his army. \"Sometimes you would see forty or fifty of them all sprawling in their blood, none of them daring to rise till he left the place, where they were lying, and if they were discountenanced and out of heart at this usage, they were of a bastard-breed, and must turn out of his service\" (4). Even after this type of treatment the soldiers were completely loyal to their emperor. The emperor would give them such incentives as distributing money among themselves to make them eager to march on expeditions they were ordered upon. To explain this reasoning for going outside of your country to form an army includes that it is easy for the sultan to quickly gather armies in large population and forcibly have their undying loyalty.\n\nAllen R. Meyers has written a paper that \"describes the development of a slave army, the 'Abid al Bukhari, which enabled one such sultan, Ismail ibn al-Sharif to establish a large and relatively durable Moroccan state\" (3). Ismail created the slave army as an effort to \"consolidate his power, to expand the kingdom, to suppress internal dissent, and to repulse to European and Ottoman threat\".<ref name=\":4\" /> Meyers states that with the armies support, Ismail was able to collect taxes, suppress rebellion, and maintain public order. Ismail first began his army by confiscating three thousand male slaves from the residents of [[Marrakech]], and later he would reach up to fifty thousand slaves, many of which were part of a group of people called [[Haratin|Haratins]].<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Sikainga|first=Ahmad Alawad|date=1998-08-01 |title=Slavery and Muslim Jurisprudence in Morocco|journal=Slavery & Abolition|volume=19|issue=2|pages=57\u201372 |doi=10.1080/01440399808575239|issn=0144-039X}}</ref> Creating this self-sufficient army also could have its drawbacks with uprisings and rebellions, such as a poor relationship with Islamic scholars due to enslaving others Muslims, an act that was considered to be [[blasphemy|blasphemous]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=El Hamel |first=Chouki |title=The Register of the Slaves of Sultan Mawlay Isma'Il of Morocco at the Turn of the Eighteenth Century.|journal=The Journal of African History|volume=51 |year=2010|pages=89\u201398|doi=10.1017/s0021853710000186 }}</ref>\n\nOn Pellow's return to [[Europe]] after his escape, he was met with misunderstanding and confusion, unlike some scholars seem to think. Pellow was no longer the English man that he remembers, before arriving on English soil Pellow was viewed suspiciously. When his boat was travelling to port he recalls, \"I was denied by the Sentinels, telling me that till they had Orders for my so doing, they would not suffer any Moor to land: Moor! said I, you are very much mistaken in that, for I am as good a Christian (though I am dressed in the Moorish Garb) as any of you all\" (4). Like other captives, Pellow found it hard to re-adjust on coming home. His overall appearance would have been so shocking that even his parents did not recognise him when he arrived. Still it is thought by some scholars \"Under the circumstances, enslaved people in the Islamic lands had far greater opportunities for integration into mainstream society\" (4). This being an obvious misunderstanding by the clear evidence that Pellow, a devout Christian and Englishman himself had difficulties in convincing his loyalty to his home country upon returning.\n\n== Pellow's Return Home ==\n\nAfter his years as a slave had finally come to an end, Pellow was faced with the daunting task of finding his way home to [[Penryn, Cornwall|Penryn]], England. He managed to secure himself passage aboard a ship bound for [[Gibraltar]] but once the ship had docked, Pellow was forbidden to go ashore. Pellow's attire, tanned skin, and thick beard (which was considered a symbol of masculinity in Islamic culture), caused the harbor guards to mistake Pellow for a [[Moors|Moor]], whom were not allowed to set foot upon English soil. Pellow called out to them to convince them he was as much a Christian man as them. The guards did not believe Pellow until his identity was at last verified. Once the confusion was cleared up, Pellow was able to leave the ship. While Pellow was still in Gibraltar he found himself being paranoid of being taken back to Morocco.  A man named Mr. Abramico had been threatening to take Pellow back to Barbary.  Pellow then physically assaulted Mr. Abramico in the street before some of his friends convinced him to stop the attack. <ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=The history of the long captivity and adventures of Thomas Pellow, in South Barbary.|last=Pellow, Thomas, 1704-|date=1973|publisher=Garland Pub|isbn=978-0824005832|location=New York|pages=338|oclc=672884}}</ref> A few days later he found himself a ship bound for [[London]] and managed to secure himself a ride.  After his brief stint in London, Pellow made multiple trips to eventually find his way back to Penryn.   \n\nPellow found himself tormented by his twenty years of fighting, and upon his return he found great difficulty in acclimating back into English society. \"Thomas Pellow had not just been captured by Barbary: he had in the process been changed. Irreversibly so, as it turned out, for he was never able to make a satisfactory life for himself on return to Britain.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Captives|last=Colley|first=Linda|publisher=Anchor Books|year=2004|isbn=|location=New York|pages=96\u201397}}</ref> Pellow's difficulty with reintegration is severely administered by his life in Barbary. Not only was he far from home, but he was indoctrinated into the Arab world and accepted his reality and their religion. Pellow's irreversible change was what made him an outsider, and made finding meaning in a place that was once his home impossible. \"Pellow's inability to settle back in and make good, may have been due to more, however, than his own alienation. In his absence, not only he but his country had been transformed.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> Pellow was a man with only one particular set of skills, and found himself was completely lost in a place that was once his home. The world at home was not the place he had once become accustomed to; instead, it was a place where he felt distant from and unable to relate to the people at home. Even when he spots his cousin during his escape, he chose to avoid him because he felt so distant due to his many years away from his people and his blood. \"I looked sharp out for a vessel, but could not find anyone to my Mind; not but here were two, and one belonging to Joshua Bawden,\u2026my first Cousin, we being Sisters Children; however, tho' I met him twice, and my Blood boiled in my Veins at the Sight of him, yet we did not speak on either Side, which was no doubt a very great Misfortune to me; for had he known who I was, he would, I am well satisfied, have carry'd me with him.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The History of the Long Captivity and Adventures of Thomas Pellow in South Barbary|last=Pellow|first=Thomas|publisher=Temple-Bar|year=1739|isbn=|location=London|pages=338}}</ref>\n\nPellow's disorientation and feeling of apprehension carried over into his arrival at his hometown of Penryn. Even though he was happy to be back in his homeland, Pellow admitted that everything was foreign to him. He did not recognize anyone. Not even his parents, who, in turn, only recognized him because they had heard of his impending return, were recognizable. (Pellow originally had a sister, though his narrative does not speak of her during the retelling of his homecoming. It is speculated that she may have died of fever years before. If Pellow had any other siblings born after his capture, the narrative does not say.) Pellow was treated as a returning hero of sorts, even given a celebration, but unfortunately the roles of his home countries had reversed. His native home had become a strange place to him and the land of his captivity had become more like home.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Ali, Kecia.

Pellow's chronicles his many adventures spent during his 23-year-long captivity (summer 1715 \u2013 July 1738) giving a detailed account of his capture by [[Barbary pirates]], his experiences as a slave under Sultan [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Moulay Ismail]], and his final escape from [[Morocco]] back to his Cornish origins.\n\nHis captivity began at the age of eleven when sailing abroad in the summer of 1716 when his ship was attacked by Barbary pirates after crossing the [[Bay of Biscay]] traveling with his uncle, John Pellow, who was the ship's captain alongside five Englishmen. Pellow and his shipmates were taken captive and delivered to Sultan Moulay Ismail of Morocco as prisoners. Pellow was one of the individuals hand picked by the sultan along with three others and integrated into one of Ismail's many slaves. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Life as a Slave==\n\nThomas Pellow, after being pulled aside by the Sultan, was led into the armoury where he and others were tasked with cleaning the arms and cases belonging to the Sultan and his army, though he did not stay doing that for long as he was soon given by the emperor to his son, Muley Spha.\n\nMuley Spha was known to be an unsavoury individual and for giving his slaves futile tasks to perform, such as running morning to night after his (Muley Spha's) horse's heels. Then when Muley Spha noticed how bright Pellow was he, instead of beating him as was his custom, he tried to convince him to convert to Islam, promising him gifts and a better life as one of his esteemed friends. After all the bribes and temptations had been rejected, Muley Spha became infuriated and began to torture Pellow. \"[He] committed me prisoner to one of his own rooms, keeping me there several months in irons, and every day most severely [[Foot whipping|bastinading]] me.\" Eventually, after weeks and weeks of horrendous torture, Pellow gave in and was forced to convert. After a time, Moulay Ismail ordered his son to bring Pellow so that he could go to school and learn the Moorish language. When Muley Spha disobeyed this order, he was summoned by the sultan and killed right before Pellow. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/whitegoldextraor00milt/page/80|title=White Gold: The Extraordinary Story of Thomas Pellow and Islam's One Million White Slaves|last=Milton|first=Giles|date=2005|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780374289355|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/whitegoldextraor00milt/page/80 80\u201386]|language=en|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nWith time, Moulay Ismail assigned Pellow into the '[[Black Guard|Abid al-Bukhari]]'. According to Pellow\u2019s text, white European converts could rise within the Moroccan military system, but were confined to their own separate fighting units. These units were generally much less important to Ismail\u2019s government and military operations than their counterparts in the \u2018Abid. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Beach|first=Adam R.|date=2013|title=African Slaves, English Slave Narratives, and Early Modern Morocco|journal=Eighteenth-Century Studies|volume=46|issue=3|pages=333\u2013348|issn=0013-2586|jstor=23524203|doi=10.1353/ecs.2013.0023}}</ref>\n\n== Marriage and Pellow ==\n\nThroughout his narrative, Pellow only mentions his marriage a few times. Most of the writing we can see on his marriage comes from his detailing of the [[collective wedding]] where he received his wife as a reward from Moulay Ismail.<ref name=\":3\" /> He also mentions his wife's family and the status of his new brother-in-law shortly after he describes his wedding, but he references his wife and children only a few other times in the latter portions of his narrative.\n\nIsmail may have been marrying his slaves to reward them for their service, but he also would have befitted from the enslaved children that would have resulted from enslaved marriages. Pellow never states that his wife was a slave, so we do not know if his children were born slaves. These marriages would have also made the prospect of escape more difficult for slaves who grew fond of their spouses, as these slaves would either need to abandon their spouses or risk increasing their visibility by escaping with at least one other person.\n\nPellow never had to consider if he wanted to bring his wife and daughter with him when he successfully escaped, as they had both died while he was campaigning as a slave-soldier. In response to the news that his family was dead, he wrote \u201cI thought them to be by far better off than they could have been in this troublesome World, especially this Part of it ; and I was really very glad that they were delivered out of it, and therefore it gave me very little uneasiness.\"<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Pellow as an elite slave ==\nThomas Pellow's extensive [[slave narrative]] ''The History of the Long Captivity and Adventures of Thomas Pellow'' chronicles the contingent captivity of an twelve-year-old [[Christianity|Christian]] cabin boy and his development into an elite military slave during the reign of Moroccan Sultan [[Zidan Abu Maali|Mulay Zidan]]. From the age 12, Pellow was plucked from preadolescence and placed on a rigorous track leading to his eventual military role as a preeminent captain in the [[Moroccan Army]]. Elite slaves like Thomas Pellow played an extraordinary role in the armed forces, often serving as soldiers and as officers, leading to the acquisition of important roles in [[Administration (government)|administration]], [[politics]], and all aspects of public affairs.\n\nPellow as part of this world was only one of many European males who were taken and placed into military slavery. Pellow was part of a \"band of European slaves mixed among other races that formed an elite army corps.\"<ref name=\"Fischer\">{{Cite book|title=Slavery and Muslim Society in Africa|last=Fischer|first=Allan|publisher=C. Hurst & Company|year=1970|isbn=|location=London|pages=130}}</ref> Pellow as one of these elite members fought on the frontlines with ferocious proficiency, and his role in combat was primarily as  an \"infantryman.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Arming Slaves: From Classical Times to the Modern Age|last=Brown|first=Christopher|publisher=New Haven|year=2006|isbn=|location=London|pages=67}}</ref>  Being that these slave soldiers were infantrymen, the monarchs viewed their role in their armies as \u201can integral, perhaps a primary, part of the conquering Ottoman army.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> However, despite their value, these soldiers were regulated as servile classes and \"were not allowed to carry a sword, nor to carry an iron spear, these being distinctions of a free man, but slaves did carry some sort of weapon.\"<ref name=\"Fischer\" /> The only place these men would have carried a proper weapon was on the battlefield.\n\nVery soon after Pellow's Barbary capture and conversion to [[Islam]], he goes on a forward track towards his elite slave stature. Pellow was educated to speak [[Arabic]], as well as how to perform Moroccan social customs. From roughly the age of 12, Thomas Pellow was given the responsibility of managing 80 slave boys. Pellow's excelled in his new position and eventually was transferred into the Palace to work as a personal attendant for [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Moulay Ismail]]'s son, Mulai Zidan. Pellow's close proximity to the monarch's family exposed him to the many forms of capricious violence the Mulai family often employed. During his time there he witnessed the Zidan murder, his favourite black slave for disturbing two pigeons that Zidan was observing. His role as Zidan's personal attendant was a preparatory grooming technique that tested Pellow's ability to care for the monarch.\n\nHaving a primary account of the wrath of Moulay Ismail no doubt prepared Pellow for witnessing the many capricious killings performed by the [[sultan]]. In the narrative, Pellow expresses the daily anxieties he was forced to live amongst as compared to how law is enforced in [[England]].\n\nPellow was considered a valuable slave. He was conditioned to live in constant fear of his life being ended at a moment's notice. This mental conditioning clearly compromised all relationships Pellow had with the Mulai family. Renowned slavery scholar [[Orlando Patterson]] maintains Pellow's anxieties about master relations with the following: No authentic human relationship was possible where violence was the ultimate sanction. There could be no trust, no genuine sympathy; and while a kind of love may sometimes have triumphed over this perverse form of interaction, intimacy was usually calculation, and sadomasochistic (12).\n\nAs Pellow became an adult, Ismail promoted him to a high status military position. Thomas Pellow was made an officer in the sultan's army and participated in three military campaigns. He led other slave-soldiers into battle and once took part in a slave-gathering expedition in sub-Saharan Africa. Pellow eventually fled Morocco by boarding an Irish ship and returned home in the summer of 1738.\n\n== Slave army ==\nAfter being the personal slave for the Sultan's son, Pellow eventually joined the Sultan's army\u2014an army that consisted almost entirely of slave-soldiers who had been captured as young children and indoctrinated.  Pellow was made an officer in the slave army. Unlike all other military slaves, who spend their lives training for war<ref>http://www.danielpipes.org/448/military-slaves-a-uniquely-muslim-phenomenon</ref>, Pellow joined the sultan's army later in life. He led other slave-soldiers into battle and once took part in a slave-gathering expedition in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. \n\nThere was a stark difference between the independent renegades encountered in the narrative and their slave counterparts, \u201cAs the mercenaries or allies, they retained their own loyalties, but as slaves, they could be subjected to reorientation. Prior to enrollment in the army, they were prepared for service; the government secured their loyalty and fitted their military skills to the needs of the army.\u201d<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Pipes|first=Daniel|date=1979|title=The strategic rationale for military slavery |journal=Journal of Strategic Studies|language=en|volume=2|issue=1|pages=42 |doi=10.1080/01402397908437012 |issn=0140-2390}}</ref> Unlike the free-thinking allies and mercenaries for hire, a slave\u2019s life depended on their masters. They were trained to fight and forced into combat against their will. As such, the process of making them submissive to their masters was a long and arduous one by which they were beaten into shape and into a fearful loyalty to their masters. The alien soldiers were isolated figures whose isolation and alienation caused them to adopt what they were left with as normality. \"He took them from their homeland to a strange country and cut them off from the rest of the society. They had no choice but to accept the affiliations provided them and to become loyal to him. They developed close relations with their comrades, all of whom shared a similar predicament.\"<ref name=\":5\" /> These slaves were held on a tight leash and their indoctrination, while isolating, helped them to form what bonds that they could amongst themselves.\n\nNot only were they treated badly in living situations but they were also beaten. The emperor would say that he would do these cruel acts to the slaves to see if they were hard enough, if they were prepared to fight in his army. \"Sometimes you would see forty or fifty of them all sprawling in their blood, none of them daring to rise till he left the place, where they were lying, and if they were discountenanced and out of heart at this usage, they were of a bastard-breed, and must turn out of his service\" (4). Even after this type of treatment the soldiers were completely loyal to their emperor. The emperor would give them such incentives as distributing money among themselves to make them eager to march on expeditions they were ordered upon. To explain this reasoning for going outside of your country to form an army includes that it is easy for the sultan to quickly gather armies in large population and forcibly have their undying loyalty.\n\nAllen R. Meyers has written a paper that \"describes the development of a slave army, the 'Abid al Bukhari, which enabled one such sultan, Ismail ibn al-Sharif to establish a large and relatively durable Moroccan state\" (3). Ismail created the slave army as an effort to \"consolidate his power, to expand the kingdom, to suppress internal dissent, and to repulse to European and Ottoman threat\".<ref name=\":4\" /> Meyers states that with the armies support, Ismail was able to collect taxes, suppress rebellion, and maintain public order. Ismail first began his army by confiscating three thousand male slaves from the residents of [[Marrakech]], and later he would reach up to fifty thousand slaves, many of which were part of a group of people called [[Haratin|Haratins]]<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Sikainga|first=Ahmad Alawad|date=1998-08-01 |title=Slavery and Muslim Jurisprudence in Morocco|journal=Slavery & Abolition|volume=19|issue=2|pages=57\u201372 |doi=10.1080/01440399808575239|issn=0144-039X}}</ref>. Creating this self-sufficient army also could have its drawbacks with uprisings and rebellions, such as a poor relationship with Islamic scholars due to enslaving others Muslims, an act that was considered to be [[blasphemy|blasphemous]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=El Hamel |first=Chouki |title=The Register of the Slaves of Sultan Mawlay Isma'Il of Morocco at the Turn of the Eighteenth Century.|journal=The Journal of African History|volume=51 |year=2010|pages=89\u201398|doi=10.1017/s0021853710000186 }}</ref>\n\nOn Pellow's return to [[Europe]] after his escape, he was met with misunderstanding and confusion, unlike some scholars seem to think. Pellow was no longer the English man that he remembers, before arriving on English soil Pellow was viewed suspiciously. When his boat was travelling to port he recalls, \"I was denied by the Sentinels, telling me that till they had Orders for my so doing, they would not suffer any Moor to land: Moor! said I, you are very much mistaken in that, for I am as good a Christian (though I am dressed in the Moorish Garb) as any of you all\" (4). Like other captives, Pellow found it hard to re-adjust on coming home. His overall appearance would have been so shocking that even his parents did not recognise him when he arrived. Still it is thought by some scholars \"Under the circumstances, enslaved people in the Islamic lands had far greater opportunities for integration into mainstream society\" (4). This being an obvious misunderstanding by the clear evidence that Pellow, a devout Christian and Englishman himself had difficulties in convincing his loyalty to his home country upon returning.\n\n== Pellow's Return Home ==\n\nAfter his years as a slave had finally come to an end, Pellow was faced with the daunting task of finding his way home to [[Penryn, Cornwall|Penryn]], England. He managed to secure himself passage aboard a ship bound for [[Gibraltar]] but once the ship had docked, Pellow was forbidden to go ashore. Pellow's attire, tanned skin, and thick beard (which was considered a symbol of masculinity in Islamic culture), caused the harbor guards to mistake Pellow for a [[Moors|Moor]], whom were not allowed to set foot upon English soil. Pellow called out to them to convince them he was as much a Christian man as them. The guards did not believe Pellow until his identity was at last verified. Once the confusion was cleared up, Pellow was able to leave the ship. While Pellow was still in Gibraltar he found himself being paranoid of being taken back to Morocco.  A man named Mr. Abramico had been threatening to take Pellow back to Barbary.  Pellow then physically assaulted Mr. Abramico in the street before some of his friends convinced him to stop the attack. <ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=The history of the long captivity and adventures of Thomas Pellow, in South Barbary.|last=Pellow, Thomas, 1704-|date=1973|publisher=Garland Pub|isbn=978-0824005832|location=New York|pages=338|oclc=672884}}</ref> A few days later he found himself a ship bound for [[London]] and managed to secure himself a ride.  After his brief stint in London, Pellow made multiple trips to eventually find his way back to Penryn.   \n\nPellow found himself tormented by his twenty years of fighting, and upon his return he found great difficulty in acclimating back into English society. \"Thomas Pellow had not just been captured by Barbary: he had in the process been changed. Irreversibly so, as it turned out, for he was never able to make a satisfactory life for himself on return to Britain.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Captives|last=Colley|first=Linda|publisher=Anchor Books|year=2004|isbn=|location=New York|pages=96\u201397}}</ref> Pellow's difficulty with reintegration is severely administered by his life in Barbary. Not only was he far from home, but he was indoctrinated into the Arab world and accepted his reality and their religion. Pellow's irreversible change was what made him an outsider, and made finding meaning in a place that was once his home impossible. \"Pellow's inability to settle back in and make good, may have been due to more, however, than his own alienation. In his absence, not only he but his country had been transformed.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> Pellow was a man with only one particular set of skills, and found himself was completely lost in a place that was once his home. The world at home was not the place he had once become accustomed to; instead, it was a place where he felt distant from and unable to relate to the people at home. Even when he spots his cousin during his escape, he chose to avoid him because he felt so distant due to his many years away from his people and his blood. \"I looked sharp out for a vessel, but could not find anyone to my Mind; not but here were two, and one belonging to Joshua Bawden,\u2026my first Cousin, we being Sisters Children; however, tho' I met him twice, and my Blood boiled in my Veins at the Sight of him, yet we did not speak on either Side, which was no doubt a very great Misfortune to me; for had he known who I was, he would, I am well satisfied, have carry'd me with him.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The History of the Long Captivity and Adventures of Thomas Pellow in South Barbary|last=Pellow|first=Thomas|publisher=Temple-Bar|year=1739|isbn=|location=London|pages=338}}</ref>\n\nPellow's disorientation and feeling of apprehension carried over into his arrival at his hometown of Penryn. Even though he was happy to be back in his homeland, Pellow admitted that everything was foreign to him. He did not recognize anyone. Not even his parents, who, in turn, only recognized him because they had heard of his impending return, were recognizable. (Pellow originally had a sister, though his narrative does not speak of her during the retelling of his homecoming. It is speculated that she may have died of fever years before. If Pellow had any other siblings born after his capture, the narrative does not say.) Pellow was treated as a returning hero of sorts, even given a celebration, but unfortunately the roles of his home countries had reversed. His native home had become a strange place to him and the land of his captivity had become more like home.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Ali, Kecia.

However, Dellacroce insisted that his supporters support Castellano for the good of the family. This move temporarily quieted the dissension in the Gambino ranks.  \n\nIn contrast, Thomas Gambino, who was Castellano's nephew, enjoyed a strong relationship with the new boss. Gambino epitomized the low-profile, well buffered, successful businessman image common among second generation members of the [[Cosa Nostra]]. Given his college education, Castellano gave him responsibility for the family finances and running the trucking at the [[Garment District, Manhattan|Garment District]] in Manhattan. Gambino and his allies in the Lucchese family were successful at infiltrating several legitimate businesses, especially the garment industry.

Instead of selecting an established and respected capo to be the new underboss, Castellano instead chose his driver, [[Thomas Bilotti]]. At this point, capo [[John Gotti]] and [[Frank DeCicco]] saw the opportunity to capitalize on this discontent to kill Castellano and take over the family leadership. On December 16, 1985, both Castellano and Bilotti were murdered by Gotti gunmen in a restaurant ambush.

Since Gambino was such a strong earner for the family, Gotti did not want to replace him. In a conversation with Gambino mobster [[George Remini]], Gotti had this comment about Gambino:\n\n<blockquote>'I mean it sounds crazy, Georgie, but I was telling Frankie and Angelo, I'm gonna suggest to Tommy, we're gonna beef up his regime, Tommy Gambino, but we're not giving him no (expletive deleted) hotheads.'' </blockquote>\n\nIn April 1989, Gambino was indicted for [[obstruction of justice]] by lying to a [[grand jury]] about Gambino racketeering activities, but was acquitted later that year. On October 18, 1990, Gambino was indicted again on charges of extorting the garment industry.

However, Dellacroce insisted that his supporters support Castellano for the good of the family. This move temporarily quieted the dissension in the Gambino ranks.  \n\nIn contrast, Thomas Gambino, who was Castellano's nephew, enjoyed a strong relationship with the new boss. Gambino epitomized the low-profile, well buffered, successful businessman image common among second generation members of the [[Cosa Nostra]]. Given his college education, Castellano gave him responsibility for the family finances and running the trucking at the [[Garment District, Manhattan|Garment District]] in Manhattan. Gambino and his allies in the Lucchese family were successful at infiltrating several legitimate businesses, especially the garment industry.

Instead of selecting an established and respected capo to be the new underboss, Castellano instead chose his driver, [[Thomas Bilotti]]. At this point, capo [[John Gotti]] and [[Frank DeCicco]] saw the opportunity to capitalize on this discontent to kill Castellano and take over the family leadership. On December 16, 1985, both Castellano and Bilotti were murdered by Gotti gunmen in a restaurant ambush.

Since Gambino was such a strong earner for the family, Gotti did not want to replace him. In a conversation with Gambino mobster [[George Remini]], Gotti had this comment about Gambino:\n\n<blockquote>'I mean it sounds crazy, Georgie, but I was telling Frankie and Angelo, I'm gonna suggest to Tommy, we're gonna beef up his regime, Tommy Gambino, but we're not giving him no (expletive deleted) hotheads.'' </blockquote>\n\nIn April 1989, Gambino was indicted for [[obstruction of justice]] by lying to a [[grand jury]] about Gambino racketeering activities, but was acquitted later that year. On October 18, 1990, Gambino was indicted again on charges of extorting the garment industry.

While a student at Beloit he directed a church choir and participated in athletics and debate.\n\nAfter graduation from [[Beloit College]] in 1866, Chamberlin worked for two years as a teacher and later principal in a high school near Beloit. He was married to Alma Wilson in 1867.\n\nIn 1868\u20131869, Chamberlin spent a year taking graduate courses, including geology, at the [[University of Michigan]] to strengthen his scientific background. Subsequently (1869\u20131873), he became professor of natural science at [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Whitewater|Whitewater Normal School]] in Wisconsin. He joined the Beloit faculty in 1873, where he was professor of geology, [[zoology]], and [[botany]]. In 1873 he also became one of several part-time participants in conducting a comprehensive geological survey of [[Wisconsin]]. His [[geologic map]]ping work in southeastern Wisconsin, a region mantled with thick [[glacial deposit]]s, led him to recognize multiple episodes of [[glaciation]] during the [[Pleistocene]]. His terminology for [[glacial stage]]s in North America is still in use, with minor modifications.\n\nIn 1875 he started a business with his brother and sold spring water, a popular brand at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.beloit.edu/archives/documents/archival_documents/chamberlin_springs/|title=Chamberlin Springs: Rest & Research Since 1875|publisher=Beloit College}}</ref>\n\nIn 1876 Chamberlin became chief geologist for the Wisconsin geological survey, supervising the completion of the survey and the publication of the four-volume report, for which he authored sections on glacial deposits, [[Paleozoic]] and [[Precambrian]] [[bedrock]] geology, [[Carbonate hosted lead zinc ore deposits|lead-zinc ore deposits]], [[artesian well]]s, and [[soil]]s. The project brought him national attention and led to his appointment as head of the glacial division of the [[US Geological Survey]] in 1881.

Their theory, the [[Chamberlin-Moulton planetesimal hypothesis]], received favorable support for almost a third of a century, but passed out of favor by the late 1930s.  It ultimately was discarded in the 1940s by the realization it was incompatible with the [[angular momentum]] of [[Jupiter]]. A portion of the theory stating that smaller objects &mdash; [[planetesimal]]s &mdash; gradually collided to build the planets by [[accretion theory|accretion]] is still well-regarded.

These artists were dispatched to [[Athens]] in the summer of 1800, and were principally employed in making drawings of the ancient monuments, though very limited facilities were given them by the authorities. Elgin later claimed that about the middle of the summer of 1801, he had received a ''[[firman (decree)|firman]]'' from the Porte which allowed his lordship's agents not only to \"fix scaffolding round the ancient Temple of the Idols [the [[Parthenon]]], and to mould the ornamental sculpture and visible figures thereon in plaster and gypsum,\" but also \"to take away any pieces of stone with old inscriptions or figures thereon.\"{{sfn|Wroth|1886}} This firman has not been found in the Ottoman archives despite its wealth of documents from the same period<ref name=Nation>{{cite journal|author1=David Rudenstein|title=Did Elgin Cheat at Marbles?|journal=Nation|date=29 May 2000|volume=270|issue=21|page=30|quote=Yet no researcher has ever located this Ottoman document and when l was in Instanbul I searched in vain for it or any copy of it, or any reference to it in other sorts of documents or a description of its substantive terms in any related official papers.

The collection thus formed by operations at Athens, and by explorations in other parts of Greece, and now known by the name of the \"Elgin Marbles\", consists of portions of the frieze, metopes, and pedimental sculptures of the Parthenon, as well as of sculptured slabs from the Athenian temple of [[Nike Apteros]], and of various antiquities from Attica and other districts of Hellas.{{sfn|Wroth|1886}}\n\nPart of the Elgin collection was prepared for embarkation for England in 1803, and considerable difficulties were encountered at every stage of its transit. Elgin's vessel, the Mentor, wrecked near Cerigo with its cargo of marbles, and it was not till after the labours of three years, and the expenditure of a large sum of money, that the marbles were successfully recovered by the divers.\nOn Elgin's departure from Turkey in 1803, he withdrew all his artists from Athens with the exception of Lusieri, who remained to direct the excavations which were still carried on, though on a much reduced scale. Additions continued to be made to the Elgin collections, and as late as 1812, eighty fresh cases of antiquities arrived in England.{{sfn|Wroth|1886}}\n\nIt was claimed later that the removal of about half of the frieze [[Metope (architecture)|metopes]], [[frieze]] and pedimental sculpture was a decision taken on the spot by [[Philip Hunt (priest)|Philip Hunt]], Elgin's chaplain (and temporary private secretary, i.e. representative, in Athens). Under unclear circumstances, \nElgin's agents were able to remove about half of the Parthenon frieze, fifteen metopes, and seventeen pedimental fragments, in addition to a caryatid and a column from the Erechtheion. The marbles remaining in Athens are generally considered to be in better condition than those removed by Elgin's agents.<ref name=\"acrop museum\"/>\n\nElgin's removal of the marbles was censured by some as vandalism, most famously [[Lord Byron]].<ref name=\"Neils2005\">{{cite book|author=Jenifer Neils|title=The Parthenon: From Antiquity to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gA81kINAI9cC&pg=PA1|date=5 September 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-82093-6|pages=1|quote=Its iconic status was certainly helped by Lord Elgin's looting of the marbles...}}</ref> Elgin attempted to vindicate himself in a pamphlet ''Memorandum on the Subject of the Earl of Elgin's Pursuits in Greece'', published in 1810.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Biography |volume=3 |page=954 |last=Gosse |first=Edmund William |authorlink=Edmund Gosse}} The ''DNB'' is described in the last paragraph of this article.</ref>\nOn the recommendation of a British parliamentary committee, which also \"vindicated\" their compatriot Elgin's conduct, the Marbles were \"bought\" by Great Britain in 1816 for \u00a335,000,<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> considerably below their cost to Elgin (estimated at \u00a375,000), and deposited in the British Museum, where they remain for now.<ref name=BritA/> Internationally, the acquisition of the marbles continues to be widely seen as both illegal and immoral,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CLT/19_ICPRCP_Recommendations_en_final.pdf |title=UK has not written back to UNESCO Letter |publisher=UNESCO}}</ref> although there still exist people who support Elgin's act, mostly in Britain.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/comment/why-returning-the-elgin-marbles-would-be-madness/|title=Why returning the Elgin Marbles would be madness|first=Nick|last=Trend|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=25 December 2018}}</ref> Polls indicate that even in the United Kingdom, a majority of people support the Marbles' return to Athens.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=1053|title=Return of the Parthenon Marbles|publisher=Ipsos MORI|accessdate=18 June 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409021725/http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=1053|archivedate=9 April 2014}}</ref> \n\nThe marbles taken to Britain by Elgin were further damaged while in the British museum by British schoolboys<ref name=\"telegraph\">Hastings, Chris.

He divorced Mary, for adultery, by legal actions in 1807 and 1808 in the English and Scottish courts\u2014and by act of parliament\u2014which caused much public scandal.  Then, on 21 September 1810, he married Elizabeth (1790\u20131860), youngest daughter of [[James Townsend Oswald]] of Dunnikier.  Elgin moved to the European continent.\n\nDuring 1815 Elgin became embroiled in the [[Tweddell remains affair]], a controversy over the possessions of [[John Tweddell]], a classical scholar who had died in 1799 in Athens and Elgin was accused of having appropriated Tweddell's belongings after his death, during his term as British ambassador in Constantinople. The full extent of the items were never recovered and their fate is unknown, but the matter was settled in late 1816 with the return of some of the items to Tweddell's family.<ref>{{cite book|title=Lord Elgin and The Marbles|last=St Clair|first=William|date=1967|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=241|authorlink=William St Clair}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 625773|title = Lord Elgin and His Collection|journal = The Journal of Hellenic Studies|volume = 36|pages = 163\u2013372|last1 = Hunt|first1 = Philip|last2 = Smith|first2 = A.

The collection thus formed by operations at Athens, and by explorations in other parts of Greece, and now known by the name of the \"Elgin Marbles\", consists of portions of the frieze, metopes, and pedimental sculptures of the Parthenon, as well as of sculptured slabs from the Athenian temple of [[Nike Apteros]], and of various antiquities from Attica and other districts of Hellas.{{sfn|Wroth|1886}}\n\nPart of the Elgin collection was prepared for embarkation for England in 1803, and considerable difficulties were encountered at every stage of its transit. Elgin's vessel, the Mentor, wrecked near Cerigo with its cargo of marbles, and it was not till after the labours of three years, and the expenditure of a large sum of money, that the marbles were successfully recovered by the divers.\nOn Elgin's departure from Turkey in 1803, he withdrew all his artists from Athens with the exception of Lusieri, who remained to direct the excavations which were still carried on, though on a much reduced scale. Additions continued to be made to the Elgin collections, and as late as 1812, eighty fresh cases of antiquities arrived in England.{{sfn|Wroth|1886}}\n\nIt was claimed later that the removal of about half of the frieze [[Metope (architecture)|metopes]], [[frieze]] and pedimental sculpture was a decision taken on the spot by [[Philip Hunt (priest)|Philip Hunt]], Elgin's chaplain (and temporary private secretary, i.e. representative, in Athens). Under unclear circumstances, \nElgin's agents were able to remove about half of the Parthenon frieze, fifteen metopes, and seventeen pedimental fragments, in addition to a caryatid and a column from the Erechtheion.

He enjoyed the bohemian lifestyle in San Francisco so much that [[Edmund White]] described him as \"the last of the commune dwellers [...] serious and intellectual by day and druggy and sexual by night\". While he continued to sharpen his use of the metrical forms that characterised his early career, he became more and more interested in [[syllabic verse|syllabics]] and [[free verse]]. \"He's possibly the only poet to have written a halfway decent [[quintain (poetry)|quintain]] while on [[LSD]], and he's certainly one of the few to profess genuine admiration for both [Yvor] [[Yvor Winters|Winters]] (the archformalist) and Allen Ginsberg (the arch ... well, [[Allen Ginsberg]])\", critic Daniel Orr has written. \"This is, even for the poetry world, a pretty odd background.\"<ref name=donyt>Orr, Daniel, \"On Poetry\" column, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/12/books/review/Orr-t.html?_r=1&ref=books&pagewanted=print \"Too Close to Touch\"], ''New York Times Book Review'', 12 July 2009 (published 9 July online), retrieved 12 July 2009</ref>\n\nIn classic verse forms, like the [[terza rima]] of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], he explored modern anxieties:\n\n{{poemquote|It is despair that nothing cannot be\nFlares in the mind and leaves a smoky mark\nOf dread.\n       Look upward. Neither firm nor free\nPurposeless matter hovers in the dark.|\"The Annihilation of Nothing\"}}\n\nGunn, who praised his [[Stanford]] mentor [[Yvor Winters]] for keeping \"both Rule and Energy in view, / Much power in each, most in the balanced two,\" found a productive tension \u2013 rather than imaginative restriction \u2013 in the technical demands of traditional poetic forms. He is one of the few contemporary poets ([[James Merrill]] would be another) to write serious poetry in [[heroic couplets]] \u2013 a form whose use in the twentieth century is generally restricted to [[light verse]] and epigrammatic wit. In the 1960s, however, he came to experiment increasingly with free verse, and the discipline of writing to a specific set of visual images, coupled with the liberation of free verse, constituted a new source of rule and energy in Gunn's work: a poem such as \"Pierce Street\" in his next collection, ''Touch'' (1967), has a grainy, photographic fidelity, while the title-poem uses hesitant, sinuous free verse to portray a scene of newly acknowledged intimacy shared with his sleeping lover (and the cat).\n\nThe poet's major stylistic change in his shift toward free verse roughly within a decade that included much of the 1960s, combined with the other changes in his life &mdash; his move from England to America, from academic Cambridge to bohemian San Francisco, his becoming openly gay, his drug-taking, his writing about the \"urban underbelly\" &mdash; caused many to conjecture how his lifestyle was affecting his work. \"British reviewers who opposed Gunn's technical shifts blamed California, just as American critics would, later on, connect his adventurous lifestyle with his more 'relaxed' versification,\" according to Orr, who added that even as of 2009, critics were contrasting \"Gunn's libido with his tight metrics &mdash; as if no one had ever written quatrains about having sex before\".<ref name=donyt/>\n\nIn Gunn's next book, ''Jack Straw's Castle'' (1976), the dream modulates into nightmare, related partly to his actual anxiety-dreams about moving house, and partly to the changing American political climate. \"But my life,\" he wrote, \"insists on continuities &mdash; between America and England, between free verse and metre, between vision and everyday consciousness.\"\n\n''The Passages of Joy'' reaffirmed those continuities: it contains sequences about London in 1964\u201365 and about time spent in New York in 1970. ''The Occasions of Poetry'', a selection of his essays and introductions, appeared at the same time.\n\nTen years were to pass before his next and most famous collection, ''The Man With Night Sweats'' (1992), dominated by AIDS-related elegies.<ref name=donyt/> [[Neil Powell (author)|Neil Powell]] praised the book: \"Gunn restores poetry to a centrality it has often seemed close to losing, by dealing in the context of a specific human catastrophe with the great themes of life and death, coherently, intelligently, memorably. One could hardly ask for more.\" As a result of the book, Gunn received the [[Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize]] in 1993.<ref name=poetsorg/> Although AIDS was a focus of much of his later work, he remained HIV-negative himself.<ref name=sfgate>Biespiel, David, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/04/26/DDGQMCDQ941.DTL \"A Poet's Life Part Two\"], ''San Francisco Chronicle'', 26 April 2005, retrieved 17 July 2009</ref>\n\nThat year, Gunn published a second collection of essays with an interview, ''Shelf Life'', and his substantial'' Collected Poems'', which [[David Biespiel]] hailed as a highlight of the century's poetry: \"Thom Gunn is a poet of 'comradely love.' Compassion has always been his domain and his work's principal emotion. If 20th century verse written in English can be seen as a battle between memory and voice - between the phenomena and its history, on the one hand, and the poet's conviction and feeling about it, on the other - then Gunn's importance lies in the accuracy with which he unifies the language and emotion of experience. You're not sure where one ends and the other starts. The result is that his poems find the limits of their imaginative territory and then push beyond that.\" <ref>Guthmann, Edward, [http://www.sfgate.com/style/article/Thom-Gunn-poet-of-comradely-love-3136823.php \"Thom Gunn, poet of comradely love\"], ''San Francisco Chronicle'', 8 August 1995</ref> His final book of poetry was ''Boss Cupid'' (2000).<ref name=\"poetsorg\" />\n\nIn 2003 he was awarded the [[David Cohen Prize]] for Literature together with [[Beryl Bainbridge]].

He enjoyed the bohemian lifestyle in San Francisco so much that [[Edmund White]] described him as \"the last of the commune dwellers [...] serious and intellectual by day and druggy and sexual by night\". While he continued to sharpen his use of the metrical forms that characterised his early career, he became more and more interested in [[syllabic verse|syllabics]] and [[free verse]]. \"He's possibly the only poet to have written a halfway decent [[quintain (poetry)|quintain]] while on [[LSD]], and he's certainly one of the few to profess genuine admiration for both [Yvor] [[Yvor Winters|Winters]] (the archformalist) and Allen Ginsberg (the arch ... well, [[Allen Ginsberg]])\", critic Daniel Orr has written. \"This is, even for the poetry world, a pretty odd background.\"<ref name=donyt>Orr, Daniel, \"On Poetry\" column, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/12/books/review/Orr-t.html?_r=1&ref=books&pagewanted=print \"Too Close to Touch\"], ''New York Times Book Review'', 12 July 2009 (published 9 July online), retrieved 12 July 2009</ref>\n\nIn classic verse forms, like the [[terza rima]] of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], he explored modern anxieties:\n\n{{poemquote|It is despair that nothing cannot be\nFlares in the mind and leaves a smoky mark\nOf dread.\n       Look upward. Neither firm nor free\nPurposeless matter hovers in the dark.|\"The Annihilation of Nothing\"}}\n\nGunn, who praised his [[Stanford]] mentor [[Yvor Winters]] for keeping \"both Rule and Energy in view, / Much power in each, most in the balanced two,\" found a productive tension \u2013 rather than imaginative restriction \u2013 in the technical demands of traditional poetic forms. He is one of the few contemporary poets ([[James Merrill]] would be another) to write serious poetry in [[heroic couplets]] \u2013 a form whose use in the twentieth century is generally restricted to [[light verse]] and epigrammatic wit. In the 1960s, however, he came to experiment increasingly with free verse, and the discipline of writing to a specific set of visual images, coupled with the liberation of free verse, constituted a new source of rule and energy in Gunn's work: a poem such as \"Pierce Street\" in his next collection, ''Touch'' (1967), has a grainy, photographic fidelity, while the title-poem uses hesitant, sinuous free verse to portray a scene of newly acknowledged intimacy shared with his sleeping lover (and the cat).\n\nThe poet's major stylistic change in his shift toward free verse roughly within a decade that included much of the 1960s, combined with the other changes in his life &mdash; his move from England to America, from academic Cambridge to bohemian San Francisco, his becoming openly gay, his drug-taking, his writing about the \"urban underbelly\" &mdash; caused many to conjecture how his lifestyle was affecting his work. \"British reviewers who opposed Gunn's technical shifts blamed California, just as American critics would, later on, connect his adventurous lifestyle with his more 'relaxed' versification,\" according to Orr, who added that even as of 2009, critics were contrasting \"Gunn's libido with his tight metrics &mdash; as if no one had ever written quatrains about having sex before\".<ref name=donyt/>\n\nIn Gunn's next book, ''Jack Straw's Castle'' (1976), the dream modulates into nightmare, related partly to his actual anxiety-dreams about moving house, and partly to the changing American political climate. \"But my life,\" he wrote, \"insists on continuities &mdash; between America and England, between free verse and metre, between vision and everyday consciousness.\"\n\n''The Passages of Joy'' reaffirmed those continuities: it contains sequences about London in 1964\u201365 and about time spent in New York in 1970. ''The Occasions of Poetry'', a selection of his essays and introductions, appeared at the same time.\n\nTen years were to pass before his next and most famous collection, ''The Man With Night Sweats'' (1992), dominated by AIDS-related elegies.<ref name=donyt/> [[Neil Powell (author)|Neil Powell]] praised the book: \"Gunn restores poetry to a centrality it has often seemed close to losing, by dealing in the context of a specific human catastrophe with the great themes of life and death, coherently, intelligently, memorably. One could hardly ask for more.\" As a result of the book, Gunn received the [[Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize]] in 1993.<ref name=poetsorg/> Although AIDS was a focus of much of his later work, he remained HIV-negative himself.<ref name=sfgate>Biespiel, David, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/04/26/DDGQMCDQ941.DTL \"A Poet's Life Part Two\"], ''San Francisco Chronicle'', 26 April 2005, retrieved 17 July 2009</ref>\n\nThat year, Gunn published a second collection of essays with an interview, ''Shelf Life'', and his substantial'' Collected Poems'', which [[David Biespiel]] hailed as a highlight of the century's poetry: \"Thom Gunn is a poet of 'comradely love.' Compassion has always been his domain and his work's principal emotion. If 20th century verse written in English can be seen as a battle between memory and voice - between the phenomena and its history, on the one hand, and the poet's conviction and feeling about it, on the other - then Gunn's importance lies in the accuracy with which he unifies the language and emotion of experience. You're not sure where one ends and the other starts. The result is that his poems find the limits of their imaginative territory and then push beyond that.\" <ref>Guthmann, Edward, [http://www.sfgate.com/style/article/Thom-Gunn-poet-of-comradely-love-3136823.php \"Thom Gunn, poet of comradely love\"], ''San Francisco Chronicle'', 8 August 1995</ref> His final book of poetry was ''Boss Cupid'' (2000).<ref name=\"poetsorg\" />\n\nIn 2003 he was awarded the [[David Cohen Prize]] for Literature together with [[Beryl Bainbridge]].

He later joins the Thieves (with the codename \"Crow\") after learning their identities, and forces them to change Sae Nijima's heart to clear their names. In the original game, his Confidant is automatically maxed as the story progressed. In the Royal, his Confidant is optional until Rank 8 and then turns automatic following the original game. In Rank 8 that requires the player to fight him, he gives the protagonist his hand glove as a promise that they will have a rematch.\n\nAkechi works for Masayoshi Shido as the \"Black Mask\" exploiting the Metaverse. He uses his Persona to assist Shido's campaign, but secretly plans to destroy his career by revealing himself as his illegitimate son when he becomes prime minister and avenging his mother's suicide. Akechi was forced to live in a series of abusive foster homes, and he is deeply contemptuous of society as a result. Because the Phantom Thieves are actively working against Shido, Akechi betrays them and also attempts to assassinate Joker, partly out of jealousy.<ref name=\"jealous\">{{cite video game |title=Persona 5 |developer=[[Atlus]] |publisher=[[Atlus]] |date=April 4, 2017 |platform=[[PlayStation 4]] |level=Shido's Palace |quote='''Akechi:''' But you... you're just some criminal trash living in an attic!

However, he is released at New Year and is unnerved by how he has no memory of how he managed to survive the attack by his cognitive self. It is later revealed he only escaped because Maruki uses his power to create the reality where the Joker and Akechi can start over as he knew about Joker's regret of his inability to save Akechi in Shido's palace. Unable to be content in a world where his very survival is founded on a lie and disgusted with Maruki's escapist ideology, Akechi encourages Joker to fight Maruki, even if it means losing him. He joins Joker and the Phantom Thieves once again in his Black Mask outfit while still maintaining his code name. Once Maruki is defeated, Akechi remains missing and Joker is in prison like in the original game. If the player maxed Akechi's confidant level, a man in a uniform similar to Akechi's is briefly seen in the game's true ending, but whether he survived or not is unknown. \n\nAkechi is mentioned in ''[[Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight]] and [[Persona 3: Dancing in Moonlight]]'' as \"Pancake-loving detective,\" and he is playable as DLC along with the soundtrack, Will Power (original version).\n\nLike Joker, Akechi is a wild card and can use several Personas simultaneously. The Persona he uses as a member of the Phantom Thieves is [[Robin Hood]]; when he faces the party in his boss battle, he switches to [[Loki]] in the second half of the fight. In Persona 5 Royal, if his Confidant is maxed and Akechi is present a day before fighting Maruki, his personas will fuse together and evolve into [[Hereward the Wake|Hereward]]. With the Phantom Thieves, Akechi fights with laser [[sabers]] and [[ray gun]]s; when he fights them after revealing his true colors, he uses serrated swords and [[pistols]] with silencers (and back to using ray guns again in ''Royal''). In ''Royal's'' the new game plus, Akechi can wear his black mask outfit in Sae's palace and his Crow outfit in Maruki's palace.

Although she has a good relationship with Joker and his friends, her opinion towards the Phantom Thieves is quite negative, saying that their actions may lead people to heavily rely on the Phantom Thieves instead of making their own efforts to solve their problems. Despite this, she later joins them when a new Palace emerges. It is eventually revealed she is actually having a fake memory of being her dead older twin sister, Kasumi. Her memories are changed via cognitive manipulation by Takuto Maruki to make her believe that she is Kasumi after the real Kasumi died pushing Sumire out of the way when she is running into traffic. Many of \"Kasumi's\" own issues, such as her klutziness and difficulty with cooking, are implied to be Sumire's subconscious awareness interfering with the implanted persona. After his corruption, Takuto revives her true memories in a ploy to convince her, Akechi, and Joker that emotional difficulties are insurmountable without his ability to construct false memories, causing Sumire to side with him in an attempt to submerge herself in her false personality again. However, inspired her seniors' determination to move on, she rejoins the party after accepting Kasumi's death.\n\nKasumi's persona is Cendrillon, based on ''[[Cinderella#Cendrillon_ou_la_petite_pantoufle_de_verre,_by_Perrault|Cinderella]]''.

Not long after receiving scholarship to Shujin, Kasumi is instructed not to practice for a while by her coach because she's having a choreo block. She agrees to teach the protagonist her gymnastic moves in exchange she is allowed to confide to him whenever she needs it. Her Confidant will be temporarily maxed at Rank 5. During third semester, as Sumire, her Confidant continues again. After accepting her true self, Sumire resumes her practice so that she will be acknowledged as herself instead of simply being Kasumi's sister.

She then introduced herself as an Artificial Intelligence with her memories lost except her own name and her reason for existence, \"To be a good friend of all humans\". In the real world, she assists the Phantom Thieves as a virtual assistant such as navigation in their tour. Throughout the Phantom Thieves' adventure, she learns more about humans' emotions and began forming a bond with Joker and the rest of the Phantom Thieves. She was later revealed to be EMMA's prototype and was given her first command to be a good friend of all humans by her creator, Kuon Ichinose. However, she was deemed as a failure. Ichinose then forced a command on her to betray the Phantom Thieves. She resisted the commands after recalling her memories with the Phantom Thieves and managed to defied her creator's command, awakening her own persona to fight back.

After getting to know the Phantom Thieves and they helped him mending his relationship with his daughter, Zenkichi learns to trust them and gradually become part of their team.

He left the government sector to work at the caf\u00e9 shortly after her death, and suspects Masayoshi Shido's involvement. Sojiro learns that Joker and his friends are the Phantom Thieves, and lets them use Caf\u00e9 Leblanc as their headquarters.\n\nAs a Confidant, Sojiro represents the [[The Hierophant (Tarot card)|Hierophant]] Arcana.<ref name=\"Arcana\" /> During his Confidant, he is harassed and extorted by Futaba's abusive uncle. Futaba wants to defend Sojiro, but his coolness towards her causes them to argue. The protagonist helps Sojiro and Futaba reconcile; Sojiro asks Futaba to stay with him, and thanks Joker for reminding him not to take the easy path in life. When he completes his Confidant, Sojiro gives Joker a Recipe Note: a list of recipes written by Wakaba before she died.\n\n==Antagonists==\nIn ''Persona 5'', some individuals have a severely-distorted view of the world and the people around them. At a certain level characters gain a Palace, a place in the Metaverse where their desires appear. Eight palaces must be overcome, represented by the [[seven deadly sins]]; each palace has an owner with whom the main characters interact.\n\n===Suguru Kamoshida===\n:Voiced by (English): [[D. C. Douglas]]<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Yuji Mitsuya]]\n{{nihongo|Suguru Kamoshida|\u9d28\u5fd7\u7530 \u5353|Kamoshida Suguru}} is Shujin Academy's PE teacher and volleyball coach, a former [[professional athlete]] and [[Olympics|Olympic volleyball champion]]. Kamoshida abuses and sexually assaults the students, which is ignored by the principal because of the volleyball team's fame and his status as a teacher. Kamoshida targets Ann as his latest sexual conquest; when she rejects his advances, he forces himself on her best friend, Shiho Suzui. Shiho's subsequent suicide attempt convinces Joker and Ryuji to change his heart. When Kamoshida is confronted by them and Mishima, he threatens to have the three of them expelled at the next school-board meeting.\n\nKamoshida's palace represents [[lust]] and takes the form of a castle, where he sees himself as the king due to his power at Shujin Academy. The male members of the volleyball team are depicted as being subjected to torturous training, and the female team members (as well as Ann) are viewed as his sex slaves. After his Shadow is defeated, his Treasure (an ornate crown) manifests as his [[Olympic medal]] in reality. After his change of heart, Kamoshida surrenders to the police and confesses his crimes. Unlike most of the game's palace-possessing antagonists, Kamoshida is not part of its overall conspiracy. He will be portrayed by [[:ja:\u9ad8\u6728\u4fca|Shun Takagi]] in ''Persona 5: The Stage''.<ref name=\"StagePlay\"/>\n\n===Ichiryusai Madarame===\n:Voiced by (English): [[Kyle Hebert]]<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Yukitoshi Hori]]\n{{nihongo|Ichiryusai Madarame|\u6591\u76ee \u4e00\u6d41\u658e|Madarame Ichiry\u016bsai}} is a well-known artist who secretly plagiarizes and profits from his students' work. Yusuke's mentor, he lets him live in his run-down shack as his pupil. Yusuke admires him at first as the creator of his favorite painting, ''Sayuri'', but later discovers that Madarame stole it from his mother and let her die from a seizure. Madarame then pretended that the painting was stolen from him to fraudulently sell copies of the original to private collectors. When Ann and Yusuke discover Madarame's plagiarism, he threatens to have them arrested for trespassing after his art exhibit is over (including Joker and Ryuji).\n\nMadarame's palace represents [[vanity]], and takes the form of a lavish art museum where his students are depicted as portraits on display from which he can profit from. His treasure is the original ''Sayuri'' painting, which depicts Yusuke's mother with her infant son in her arms; Madarame had painted over her son to add mystery and make his claim that he is the painter more believable. After his change of heart, he calls a press conference to admit his crimes and plagiarism. Yusuke later gives the original ''Sayuri'' to Sojiro Sakura to hang in Cafe LeBlanc. \n\n===Junya Kaneshiro===\n:Voiced by (English): Jalen K. Cassell<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Kazunari Tanaka]] (''Persona 5''), [[Takahiro Fujimoto]] (''Persona 5: The Animation'' onwards)\n{{nihongo|Junya Kaneshiro|\u91d1\u57ce \u6f64\u77e2|Kaneshiro Junya}} is a ruthless [[yakuza]] crime lord who is responsible for enlisting students from Shujin Academy to smuggle drugs in Shibuya. Makoto, tasked by the principal to investigate, allows herself to be taken by the yakuza. When the Phantom Thieves try to rescue her, Kaneshiro blackmails them into paying him {{JPY|3 million|link=yes}} in three weeks with a threat to show photographs of them at a night club to their schools.\n\nKaneshiro's palace represents [[gluttony]] and takes the form of a bank hovering above Shibuya, where people are viewed as [[automated teller machine]]s for him to drain money from. His treasure appears as large gold bars in his palace, manifesting as a golden briefcase filled with fake money. After his change of heart, Kaneshiro deletes the photographs, voids the Phantom Thieves' debt, and surrenders to the police.\n\n===Kunikazu Okumura===\n:Voiced by (English): [[Christopher Corey Smith]]<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Hirohiko Kakegawa]]\n{{nihongo|Kunikazu Okumura|\u5965\u6751 \u90a6\u548c|Okumura Kunikazu}} is [[President (corporate title)|president]] of Okumura Foods and [[list of Persona 5 characters#Haru Okumura|Haru Okumura's]] father. Growing up poor, Okumura transformed his family's small company into a multi-million-yen business and founded the popular Big Bang Burger fast-food chain. Because he mistreats his staff, he is the most popular suggested target on the Phantom Thieves' online poll.\n\nOkumura was part of Masayoshi Shido's circle as a sponsor until he decided to enter the political world. One of his first steps in gaining a foothold in politics is arranging a marriage between Haru and Sugimura (despite his abusive nature), who is from a politically-influential family. When Shido discovers this, he begins to see Okumura as a threat and orders him killed before the election. The conspiracy rigs the Phantom Thieves' poll to [[Scapegoating|scapegoat]] and frame them for Okumura's murder. His Shadow is killed by Goro Akechi after the Phantom Thieves defeat him, resulting in him suffering a mental shutdown during a live conference before he can reveal the names of those linked to Shido.\n\nOkumura's palace represents [[greed]], and is depicted as a space station where his employees are robots that work in poor conditions and are discarded when they break down. His treasure is a mysterious orb in his palace, and manifests as a spaceship model kit he had dreamed of as a child but could not afford due to his family's poverty.\n\n===Masayoshi Shido===\n:Voiced by (English): [[Keith Silverstein]]<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Shuichi Ikeda]]\n{{nihongo|Masayoshi Shido|\u7345\u7ae5 \u6b63\u7fa9|Shid\u014d Masayoshi}} is a politician and a representative in Japan's [[National Diet]]. Early in the game, Shido frames Joker after he tries to prevent Shido from sexually assaulting his subordinate. He later appears as a candidate for prime minister, leading the United Future Party. To secure victory, he and his followers (including his illegitimate son, Akechi), steal Wakaba's research on \"cognitive psience,\" and use the Metaverse to cause mental shutdowns and psychotic breakdowns to eliminate potential threats and spread distrust for the current government administration. When the Phantom Thieves gain traction, he and his followers frame them for their crimes and use them to gain control of Japan.\n\nShido's palace represents [[pride]] and takes the form of a cruise ship sailing through a sunken Tokyo, where he and his conspirators live in luxury; rather than cognitive beings, the Shadows selves of Shido's conspirators also reside within the palace, having been drawn to his strong personality and ego. His treasure is a golden ship's wheel in his palace, manifesting as his legislative pin. After Shido's change of heart, he confesses his crimes in a press conference after his landslide victory. He is arrested at the end of the game, and Joker testifies against him at his trial.\n\n===Yaldabaoth===\n[[Yaldabaoth]], the god of control, is malevolent and appears in the form of the [[Holy Grail]]: a treasure of mementos created from humanity's distorted sloth. He leads the conspiracy to give Masayoshi Shido political power and sponsored the Phantom Thieves to see which is stronger: their salvation of the world or Goro Akechi's desire to destroy (and recreate) it. Yaldabaoth imprisons Igor, impersonating him until Joker unmasks his identity.\n\nHe reveals himself as power-hungry, self-righteous and sadistic, with a tendency to toy with humanity. When [[list of Persona 5 characters#Goro Akechi|Akechi]] and Shido are defeated, Yaldabaoth decides that the world should be saved; this \"salvation\" entails taking control of existence and removing everyone with chaos in their heart. He awakens his body in the core of mementos, merging them with the physical world as his palace. This gives Yaldabaoth the ability to change lies into truth, driving people into despair and complacency and erasing his enemies.\n\nHe is described as the manifestation of humanity's desire for order, warped to the point where he no longer cares for the human cost (or morality) of that order. Yaldabaoth sees humans as little more than livestock and [[lemmings]] for him to rule, due to their self-destructiveness and stupidity. He initially takes the form of the Holy Grail, which is black before the flow of wishes for him to dominate the world revitalizes him and turns the chalice gold. After the flow is cut off and the Grail is defeated, the chalice merges with his arena to become a giant, robotic, faceless angel who can manifest a gun, bell, sword, and book with each of his four arms. At the end of his fight it is revealed that he had enough power to defeat the Phantom Thieves at will, but kept fighting them out of arrogance. Until one of Phantom Thieves' allies Y\u016bki Mishima manages to convince the surviving civilians to support their fight against the evil god, leading the creation protagonist's ultimate Persona, Satanael. Yaldabaoth is finally defeated and reverts to his original, mindless form of the Holy Grail, bringing an end to his ambitions and destroying Mementos for good. \n\n==Confidants==\nLike previous ''Persona'' titles, progression of the characters' skills is based on their level of bonding with [[non-player character]]s.

Caroline is the [[Good cop/bad cop|\"bad cop\"]], with a short temper and a general dislike of Joker; she guards the entrances to the Velvet Room in Tokyo, and kicks Joker inside when he enters. Justine plays the \"good cop\" and manages the Persona Compendium, a list of the Personas Joker has owned. Calmer than Caroline, she still treats Joker as a prisoner and guards the Velvet Room entrances in Mementos.\n\nCaroline and Justine represent the [[Strength (Tarot card)|Strength]] Arcana,<ref name=\"Arcana\" /> and encourage Joker to fuse certain personas with skills. When he fails to stop the Holy Grail, they remember that Yaldabaoth had captured Igor and split the pair to prevent them from acting. They fuse into {{nihongo|Lavenza|\u30e9\u30f4\u30a7\u30f3\u30c4\u30a1|Ravensha}} their true form. Lavenza calls Joker \"trickster\" instead of \"inmate\" and maintain's Justine's calm demeanor, but exhibits Caroline's aggression and impatience when Ryuji cannot understand her explanations. If the player completes Caroline and Justine's confidant, Lavenza gives Joker the key to the Velvet Room before he leaves Tokyo.\n\n===Igor===\n:Voiced by (English): [[David Lodge (voice actor)|David Lodge]] (False Igor)<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Masane Tsukayama]] (False Igor), [[Isamu Tanonaka]] (Real Igor)<ref name=\"velvet jpn\"/>, [[Kirk Thornton]] (Real Igor)<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Masane Tsukayama]] (False Igor), [[Isamu Tanonaka]] (Real Igor)<ref name=\"velvet jpn\"/>\n{{nihongo|Igor|\u30a4\u30b4\u30fc\u30eb|Ig\u014dru}} is the prison master of the Velvet Room.

As Joker participates in more of her trials, he learns that Takemi had worked for a university and was fired (and blamed) for a disastrous medical trial she had opposed. She becomes more motivated after treating a young patient with a similar illness; when Joker changes the heart of her former colleague, she saves a former patient's life and regains her reputation.

In the Metaverse, fake guns (and other weapons) work as well as the real thing, so Joker frequently visits Untouchable to supply the Phantom Thieves with equipment. Iwai has an adopted son, Kaoru, whose mother abandoned him when she could not sell him for drug money; unable to bring himself to tell Kaoru about his ties to the yakuza, Iwai instead told him that he was a family friend who took him in after his parents died in a car accident.\n\nIwai represents the [[The Hanged Man (Tarot card)|Hanged Man]] Arcana.<ref name=\"Arcana\" /> In his Confidant, Joker is a lookout for Iwai and helps him with a deal involving his yakuza brother Tsuda (who has been forcing him to illegally customize guns). The deal becomes fraught when Tsuda threatens the lives of Iwai and the Phantom Thieves. He repents, however, admitting that he thought he was losing his place in the organization to younger members. Another yakuza, Masa, tries to take advantage of Tsuda's abandoning the deal; he threatens to kill Kaoru and reveals the truth regarding his parents. Iwai acknowledges Kaoru as his son, and Tsuda takes Masa into custody. At the end of the Confidant, Iwai gains Kaoru's trust and gives Joker a Gekko pin symbolizing protection of home and family before he leaves Tokyo.\n\n===Yuuki Mishima===\n:Voiced by (English): [[Sean Chiplock]]<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Daisuke Sakaguchi]]<ref name=\"mishima jpn\"/>\n{{nihongo|Yuuki Mishima|\u4e09\u5cf6 \u7531\u8f1d|Mishima Y\u016bki}}<ref name=\"mishima jpn\">{{cite web |url=http://persona5.jp/school_life/coop_mishima.html | title=\u4e09\u5cf6\u7531\u8f1d P\uff15 \u2013 \u30da\u30eb\u30bd\u30ca\uff15 \u2013 \u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 | language=Japanese | publisher=Atlus | accessdate=December 9, 2017 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503225029/http://persona5.jp/school_life/coop_mishima.html | archivedate=May 3, 2017 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> is a classmate of Joker and Ann.

After Kamoshida's arrest, he realizes that Joker, Ryuji, and Ann are the Phantom Thieves. He creates and manages the Phantom Aficionados website, a fan site dedicated to the Thieves with a message board where people post requests for changes of heart. Mishima periodically sends the requests to Joker to enhance the Thieves' reputation.\n\nAs a Confidant, Mishima represents the [[The Moon (Tarot card)|Moon]] Arcana<ref name=\"Arcana\" /> and will give party members experience points. His fascination with the Phantom Thieves becomes an obsession, and Joker deduces that his motivation to help springs from insecurity and his desire for popularity. When Mishima runs into his bully from middle school, he threatens to have his heart changed. After Joker confronts his Shadow in Mementos, Mishima realizes the error of his ways and saves his bully from thugs.

Takase worked several part-time jobs to support his guardians' hedonistic lifestyle, frequently missing school and receiving low grades. When Kawakami began to tutor him, she was ordered by the principal to stop or resign because of Takase's rumored delinquency. Takase was killed in a car accident shortly afterwards, and his guardians use his death to extort money from Kawakami, threatening to sue her if she does not comply.\n\nAs a Confidant, Kawakami represents the [[Temperance (Tarot card)|Temperance]] Arcana.<ref name=\"Arcana\"/> She helps Joker with chores and gives him free time in class. Initially saying that it pays her sister's medical bills, Kawakami's second job allows her no time to rest and she is hospitalized with exhaustion. When Joker changes the hearts of Takase's guardians, she quits her second job and resolves to be a better teacher. Upon completing her Confidant, Kawakami gives Joker a coupon for free maid service before he leaves Tokyo.

He is a new counselor that arrives at Shujin Academy after the arrest of Kamoshida. The students seem to really like him, as he is able to listen to them and give them good advice. Contrary to Kasumi, his opinion towards the Phantom Thieves is very positive, as he thinks their actions can bring happiness and justice to people. It is eventually revealed he is a Persona user with the ability to alter the cognitions of others, altering their personalities and memories, which he uses for truly desperate cases as a stopgap to real treatment, and a peer of Wakaba's whose research was also stolen by Shido. During the conflict with Yaldabaoth, his despair at realizing how uncaring Shujin is towards its students causes him to become vulnerable to Yaldabaoth's own ability to warp cognition, causing part of his Persona [[Adam Kadmon]] to lose a component of itself as a Treasure, causing it to degenerate into [[Azathoth]] and he enters a delusional state where he believes the only way to improve the world is to use his abilities on everyone to create a utopia, becoming the final antagonist of ''Royal''. In the bad/neutral ending, Maruki takes a photo of the phantom thieves during the graduation and leaves the gang as he created a reality that people can have happiness in their lives. In the true ending, Maruki becomes a taxi driver and offers Joker a ride as he is being followed by officers. Maruki tells Joker that he will move forward in his life as well, just like how Joker and his friends will do the same.\n\n==Reception==\nThe game's characters were generally well-received.

Although Futaba is a [[genius]] computer hacker, she is a recluse at the beginning of the game and fearful of large crowds. Shortly before the game begins, she sees her mother (Wakaba Isshiki) killed by a car and is framed for her death with a forged suicide note. Futaba is bounced among abusive family members until Sojiro intervenes and takes her in. She has [[auditory hallucination]]s of her extended family's reactions to the suicide note, and locks herself in her bedroom. Futaba appears withdrawn in the game, and has developed a Palace depicting her [[Sloth (deadly sin)|sloth]] in the form of a pyramid. She has become so depressed that her Shadow represents her repressed positive emotions and helps the Phantom Thieves traverse her Palace. As the Phantom Thieves slowly become more popular, Futaba blackmails them into changing her heart with the alias \"[[Ali Baba|Alibaba]]\". After entering her Palace and discovering the truth about her mother's death, Futaba awakens her Persona ([[Necronomicon]])<ref name=\"IGN\"/> and helps the Phantom Thieves defeat a sphinx representing her mother's perceived [[wrath]] towards her. She later replaces Morgana as the party's navigator.\n\nAs a Confidant, Futaba represents the [[The Hermit (Tarot card)|Hermit]] Arcana<ref name=\"Arcana\" /> and provides detailed locations and extra assistance in battle. After learning to adjust to a normal life, she makes a \"promise list\" of goals she wants to reach with the help of Joker. As Futaba slowly recovers, she reveals that in her youth she was [[bullied]] for her intelligence and had only one friend named Kana. Futaba discovers that Kana's parents were [[abuse|abusing]] her. She tracks down Kana, and learns that the abuse has continued. After changing her parents' hearts, Kana and Futaba rebuild their friendship.\n\nWhen she completes her Confidant, Futaba's Persona evolves into [[Prometheus]].

In conversations with Joker, she learns to stand up for herself; the company adopts her idea, and she breaks her engagement with Sugimura.\n\nWhen she completes her Confidant, Haru's Persona evolves into [[Astarte]].

His talents have been widely praised, and he openly opposes the Phantom Thieves.\n\nAs a Confidant, he represents the [[Justice (Tarot card)|Justice]] Arcana.<ref name=\"Arcana\" /> During his Confidant, Akechi befriends Joker and admits his concerns about the Phantom Thieves' case and his past. He later joins the Thieves (with the codename \"Crow\") after learning their identities, and forces them to change Sae Nijima's heart to clear their names. In the original game, his Confidant is automatically maxed as the story progressed. In the Royal, his Confidant is optional until Rank 8 and then turns automatic following the original game. In Rank 8 that requires the player to fight him, he gives the protagonist his hand glove as a promise that they will have a rematch.\n\nAkechi works for Masayoshi Shido as the \"Black Mask\" exploiting the Metaverse. He uses his Persona to assist Shido's campaign, but secretly plans to destroy his career by revealing himself as his illegitimate son when he becomes prime minister and avenging his mother's suicide. Akechi was forced to live in a series of abusive foster homes, and he is deeply contemptuous of society as a result. Because the Phantom Thieves are actively working against Shido, Akechi betrays them and also attempts to assassinate Joker, partly out of jealousy.<ref name=\"jealous\">{{cite video game |title=Persona 5 |developer=[[Atlus]] |publisher=[[Atlus]] |date=April 4, 2017 |platform=[[PlayStation 4]] |level=Shido's Palace |quote='''Akechi:''' But you... you're just some criminal trash living in an attic!

How can such a worthless piece of trash be more special than me!?}}</ref> After the Phantom Thieves defeat him in Shido's Palace, they offer to take him back; however, he sacrifices himself to save them when they are attacked by his cognitive self-created by Shido. \n\nIn Persona 5 Royal, Akechi is revealed to be apparently alive and willingly turn himself in so that the protagonist doesn't need to testify against Shido. However, he is released at New Year and is unnerved by how he has no memory of how he managed to survive the attack by his cognitive self. It is later revealed he only escaped because Maruki uses his power to create the reality where the Joker and Akechi can start over as he knew about Joker's regret of his inability to save Akechi in Shido's palace. Unable to be content in a world where his very survival is founded on a lie and disgusted with Maruki's escapist ideology, Akechi encourages Joker to fight Maruki, even if it means losing him. He joins Joker and the Phantom Thieves once again in his Black Mask outfit while still maintaining his code name. Once Maruki is defeated, Akechi remains missing and Joker is in prison like in the original game. If the player maxed Akechi's confidant level, a man in a uniform similar to Akechi's is briefly seen in the game's true ending, but whether he survived or not is unknown. \n\nAkechi is mentioned in ''[[Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight]] and [[Persona 3: Dancing in Moonlight]]'' as \"Pancake-loving detective,\" and he is playable as DLC along with the soundtrack, Will Power (original version).\n\nLike Joker, Akechi is a wild card and can use several Personas simultaneously. The Persona he uses as a member of the Phantom Thieves is [[Robin Hood]]; when he faces the party in his boss battle, he switches to [[Loki]] in the second half of the fight. In Persona 5 Royal, if his Confidant is maxed and Akechi is present a day before fighting Maruki, his personas will fuse together and evolve into [[Hereward the Wake|Hereward]]. With the Phantom Thieves, Akechi fights with laser [[sabers]] and [[ray gun]]s; when he fights them after revealing his true colors, he uses serrated swords and [[pistols]] with silencers (and back to using ray guns again in ''Royal''). In ''Royal's'' the new game plus, Akechi can wear his black mask outfit in Sae's palace and his Crow outfit in Maruki's palace.

She is a first-year student that transfers to Shujin Academy around the same time as Joker. She is a [[rhythmic gymnast]] and due to her abilities the school has high hopes for her. Although she has a good relationship with Joker and his friends, her opinion towards the Phantom Thieves is quite negative, saying that their actions may lead people to heavily rely on the Phantom Thieves instead of making their own efforts to solve their problems. Despite this, she later joins them when a new Palace emerges. It is eventually revealed she is actually having a fake memory of being her dead older twin sister, Kasumi. Her memories are changed via cognitive manipulation by Takuto Maruki to make her believe that she is Kasumi after the real Kasumi died pushing Sumire out of the way when she is running into traffic. Many of \"Kasumi's\" own issues, such as her klutziness and difficulty with cooking, are implied to be Sumire's subconscious awareness interfering with the implanted persona. After his corruption, Takuto revives her true memories in a ploy to convince her, Akechi, and Joker that emotional difficulties are insurmountable without his ability to construct false memories, causing Sumire to side with him in an attempt to submerge herself in her false personality again. However, inspired her seniors' determination to move on, she rejoins the party after accepting Kasumi's death.\n\nKasumi's persona is Cendrillon, based on ''[[Cinderella#Cendrillon_ou_la_petite_pantoufle_de_verre,_by_Perrault|Cinderella]]''. In battle, she fights with [[rapier]]s, lever shotguns and rifles. As a Confidant, she represents the Faith Arcana. Her Confidant is split into two parts; first as Kasumi and second as Sumire. Not long after receiving scholarship to Shujin, Kasumi is instructed not to practice for a while by her coach because she's having a choreo block. She agrees to teach the protagonist her gymnastic moves in exchange she is allowed to confide to him whenever she needs it. Her Confidant will be temporarily maxed at Rank 5. During third semester, as Sumire, her Confidant continues again. After accepting her true self, Sumire resumes her practice so that she will be acknowledged as herself instead of simply being Kasumi's sister. Once her Confidant is maxed, her Persona transforms into [[Freyja|Vanadies]]. If certain conditions are met, Sumire can use her third tier persona, Ella.\n\n===Sophia===\n:Voiced by (Japanese): [[Misaki Kuno]]\n\n{{nihongo|Sophia|\u30bd\u30d5\u30a3\u30a2|Sofia}}, who assumes the codename \"Sophie\", is a character introduced in ''[[Persona 5 Scramble]]''.

She then introduced herself as an Artificial Intelligence with her memories lost except her own name and her reason for existence, \"To be a good friend of all humans\". In the real world, she assists the Phantom Thieves as a virtual assistant such as navigation in their tour. Throughout the Phantom Thieves' adventure, she learns more about humans' emotions and began forming a bond with Joker and the rest of the Phantom Thieves. She was later revealed to be EMMA's prototype and was given her first command to be a good friend of all humans by her creator, Kuon Ichinose. However, she was deemed as a failure. Ichinose then forced a command on her to betray the Phantom Thieves. She resisted the commands after recalling her memories with the Phantom Thieves and managed to defied her creator's command, awakening her own persona to fight back. After she and the Phantom Thieves defeats Demiurge and EMMA ceased from existence, Sophia decides to accompany Ichinose on her journey, parting ways with the Phantom Thieves.\n\nSophia's persona is Pandora and represents the Star Arcana.

He has a daughter, Akane, but she hated him ever since her mother, Aoi Hasegawa, passed away in a hit-and-run accident and he couldn't arrest the person responsible for his late wife's death. In attempt to find a way to arrest the culprit, Zenkichi approaches the Phantom Thieves while slowly leading them to the one responsible for his wife's death. After getting to know the Phantom Thieves and they helped him mending his relationship with his daughter, Zenkichi learns to trust them and gradually become part of their team. He also allowed the Phantom Thieves to escape arrest when they were framed for murder in Okinawa and the hacking of the virtual assistant, EMMA, which led to him being temporarily arrested.

After his change of heart, Kaneshiro deletes the photographs, voids the Phantom Thieves' debt, and surrenders to the police.\n\n===Kunikazu Okumura===\n:Voiced by (English): [[Christopher Corey Smith]]<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Hirohiko Kakegawa]]\n{{nihongo|Kunikazu Okumura|\u5965\u6751 \u90a6\u548c|Okumura Kunikazu}} is [[President (corporate title)|president]] of Okumura Foods and [[list of Persona 5 characters#Haru Okumura|Haru Okumura's]] father. Growing up poor, Okumura transformed his family's small company into a multi-million-yen business and founded the popular Big Bang Burger fast-food chain. Because he mistreats his staff, he is the most popular suggested target on the Phantom Thieves' online poll.\n\nOkumura was part of Masayoshi Shido's circle as a sponsor until he decided to enter the political world. One of his first steps in gaining a foothold in politics is arranging a marriage between Haru and Sugimura (despite his abusive nature), who is from a politically-influential family. When Shido discovers this, he begins to see Okumura as a threat and orders him killed before the election. The conspiracy rigs the Phantom Thieves' poll to [[Scapegoating|scapegoat]] and frame them for Okumura's murder. His Shadow is killed by Goro Akechi after the Phantom Thieves defeat him, resulting in him suffering a mental shutdown during a live conference before he can reveal the names of those linked to Shido.\n\nOkumura's palace represents [[greed]], and is depicted as a space station where his employees are robots that work in poor conditions and are discarded when they break down. His treasure is a mysterious orb in his palace, and manifests as a spaceship model kit he had dreamed of as a child but could not afford due to his family's poverty.\n\n===Masayoshi Shido===\n:Voiced by (English): [[Keith Silverstein]]<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Shuichi Ikeda]]\n{{nihongo|Masayoshi Shido|\u7345\u7ae5 \u6b63\u7fa9|Shid\u014d Masayoshi}} is a politician and a representative in Japan's [[National Diet]]. Early in the game, Shido frames Joker after he tries to prevent Shido from sexually assaulting his subordinate. He later appears as a candidate for prime minister, leading the United Future Party. To secure victory, he and his followers (including his illegitimate son, Akechi), steal Wakaba's research on \"cognitive psience,\" and use the Metaverse to cause mental shutdowns and psychotic breakdowns to eliminate potential threats and spread distrust for the current government administration. When the Phantom Thieves gain traction, he and his followers frame them for their crimes and use them to gain control of Japan.\n\nShido's palace represents [[pride]] and takes the form of a cruise ship sailing through a sunken Tokyo, where he and his conspirators live in luxury; rather than cognitive beings, the Shadows selves of Shido's conspirators also reside within the palace, having been drawn to his strong personality and ego. His treasure is a golden ship's wheel in his palace, manifesting as his legislative pin. After Shido's change of heart, he confesses his crimes in a press conference after his landslide victory. He is arrested at the end of the game, and Joker testifies against him at his trial.\n\n===Yaldabaoth===\n[[Yaldabaoth]], the god of control, is malevolent and appears in the form of the [[Holy Grail]]: a treasure of mementos created from humanity's distorted sloth. He leads the conspiracy to give Masayoshi Shido political power and sponsored the Phantom Thieves to see which is stronger: their salvation of the world or Goro Akechi's desire to destroy (and recreate) it. Yaldabaoth imprisons Igor, impersonating him until Joker unmasks his identity.\n\nHe reveals himself as power-hungry, self-righteous and sadistic, with a tendency to toy with humanity. When [[list of Persona 5 characters#Goro Akechi|Akechi]] and Shido are defeated, Yaldabaoth decides that the world should be saved; this \"salvation\" entails taking control of existence and removing everyone with chaos in their heart. He awakens his body in the core of mementos, merging them with the physical world as his palace. This gives Yaldabaoth the ability to change lies into truth, driving people into despair and complacency and erasing his enemies.\n\nHe is described as the manifestation of humanity's desire for order, warped to the point where he no longer cares for the human cost (or morality) of that order. Yaldabaoth sees humans as little more than livestock and [[lemmings]] for him to rule, due to their self-destructiveness and stupidity. He initially takes the form of the Holy Grail, which is black before the flow of wishes for him to dominate the world revitalizes him and turns the chalice gold. After the flow is cut off and the Grail is defeated, the chalice merges with his arena to become a giant, robotic, faceless angel who can manifest a gun, bell, sword, and book with each of his four arms. At the end of his fight it is revealed that he had enough power to defeat the Phantom Thieves at will, but kept fighting them out of arrogance. Until one of Phantom Thieves' allies Y\u016bki Mishima manages to convince the surviving civilians to support their fight against the evil god, leading the creation protagonist's ultimate Persona, Satanael. Yaldabaoth is finally defeated and reverts to his original, mindless form of the Holy Grail, bringing an end to his ambitions and destroying Mementos for good. \n\n==Confidants==\nLike previous ''Persona'' titles, progression of the characters' skills is based on their level of bonding with [[non-player character]]s.

Caroline is the [[Good cop/bad cop|\"bad cop\"]], with a short temper and a general dislike of Joker; she guards the entrances to the Velvet Room in Tokyo, and kicks Joker inside when he enters. Justine plays the \"good cop\" and manages the Persona Compendium, a list of the Personas Joker has owned. Calmer than Caroline, she still treats Joker as a prisoner and guards the Velvet Room entrances in Mementos.\n\nCaroline and Justine represent the [[Strength (Tarot card)|Strength]] Arcana,<ref name=\"Arcana\" /> and encourage Joker to fuse certain personas with skills. When he fails to stop the Holy Grail, they remember that Yaldabaoth had captured Igor and split the pair to prevent them from acting. They fuse into {{nihongo|Lavenza|\u30e9\u30f4\u30a7\u30f3\u30c4\u30a1|Ravensha}} their true form. Lavenza calls Joker \"trickster\" instead of \"inmate\" and maintain's Justine's calm demeanor, but exhibits Caroline's aggression and impatience when Ryuji cannot understand her explanations. If the player completes Caroline and Justine's confidant, Lavenza gives Joker the key to the Velvet Room before he leaves Tokyo.\n\n===Igor===\n:Voiced by (English): [[David Lodge (voice actor)|David Lodge]] (False Igor)<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" />, [[Kirk Thornton]] (Real Igor)<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Masane Tsukayama]] (False Igor), [[Isamu Tanonaka]] (Real Igor)<ref name=\"velvet jpn\"/>\n{{nihongo|Igor|\u30a4\u30b4\u30fc\u30eb|Ig\u014dru}} is the prison master of the Velvet Room.

For secretly selling barely-legal prescriptions to her patients, she is nicknamed \"[[Black Death|the Black Death]]\". The protagonist helps her by participating in clinical trials to test her new medications, which (she hopes) will boost her credibility.

As Joker participates in more of her trials, he learns that Takemi had worked for a university and was fired (and blamed) for a disastrous medical trial she had opposed. She becomes more motivated after treating a young patient with a similar illness; when Joker changes the heart of her former colleague, she saves a former patient's life and regains her reputation. Before Joker leaves Tokyo, Takemi gives him a dog tag as a farewell gift.\n\n===Munehisa Iwai===\n:Voiced by (English): [[Kaiji Tang]]<br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Hisao Egawa]]\n{{nihongo|Munehisa Iwai|\u5ca9\u4e95 \u5b97\u4e45|Iwai Munehisa}} is a former [[yakuza]] who owns an [[airsoft]] shop, Untouchable, in Shibuya. In the Metaverse, fake guns (and other weapons) work as well as the real thing, so Joker frequently visits Untouchable to supply the Phantom Thieves with equipment. Iwai has an adopted son, Kaoru, whose mother abandoned him when she could not sell him for drug money; unable to bring himself to tell Kaoru about his ties to the yakuza, Iwai instead told him that he was a family friend who took him in after his parents died in a car accident.\n\nIwai represents the [[The Hanged Man (Tarot card)|Hanged Man]] Arcana.<ref name=\"Arcana\" /> In his Confidant, Joker is a lookout for Iwai and helps him with a deal involving his yakuza brother Tsuda (who has been forcing him to illegally customize guns). The deal becomes fraught when Tsuda threatens the lives of Iwai and the Phantom Thieves. He repents, however, admitting that he thought he was losing his place in the organization to younger members. Another yakuza, Masa, tries to take advantage of Tsuda's abandoning the deal; he threatens to kill Kaoru and reveals the truth regarding his parents. Iwai acknowledges Kaoru as his son, and Tsuda takes Masa into custody. At the end of the Confidant, Iwai gains Kaoru's trust and gives Joker a Gekko pin symbolizing protection of home and family before he leaves Tokyo.\n\n===Yuuki Mishima===\n:Voiced by (English): [[Sean Chiplock]]<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Daisuke Sakaguchi]]<ref name=\"mishima jpn\"/>\n{{nihongo|Yuuki Mishima|\u4e09\u5cf6 \u7531\u8f1d|Mishima Y\u016bki}}<ref name=\"mishima jpn\">{{cite web |url=http://persona5.jp/school_life/coop_mishima.html | title=\u4e09\u5cf6\u7531\u8f1d P\uff15 \u2013 \u30da\u30eb\u30bd\u30ca\uff15 \u2013 \u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 | language=Japanese | publisher=Atlus | accessdate=December 9, 2017 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503225029/http://persona5.jp/school_life/coop_mishima.html | archivedate=May 3, 2017 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> is a classmate of Joker and Ann. A member of the volleyball club, he is a frequent target of Kamoshida's abuse. Mishima was forced to summon Shiho Suzui to Kamoshida's office, leading to a sexual assault and Shiho's suicide attempt; Kamoshida nearly expels him for confronting him with Joker and Ryuji. After Kamoshida's arrest, he realizes that Joker, Ryuji, and Ann are the Phantom Thieves. He creates and manages the Phantom Aficionados website, a fan site dedicated to the Thieves with a message board where people post requests for changes of heart. Mishima periodically sends the requests to Joker to enhance the Thieves' reputation.\n\nAs a Confidant, Mishima represents the [[The Moon (Tarot card)|Moon]] Arcana<ref name=\"Arcana\" /> and will give party members experience points. His fascination with the Phantom Thieves becomes an obsession, and Joker deduces that his motivation to help springs from insecurity and his desire for popularity. When Mishima runs into his bully from middle school, he threatens to have his heart changed. After Joker confronts his Shadow in Mementos, Mishima realizes the error of his ways and saves his bully from thugs. In gratitude, he gives Joker an early draft for a documentary he intends to make regarding the Phantom Thieves before Joker he leaves Tokyo.

Kawakami avoids Joker until he learns that she is also a maid to pay the guardians of Taiki Takase, a student from the previous school she worked at. Takase worked several part-time jobs to support his guardians' hedonistic lifestyle, frequently missing school and receiving low grades. When Kawakami began to tutor him, she was ordered by the principal to stop or resign because of Takase's rumored delinquency. Takase was killed in a car accident shortly afterwards, and his guardians use his death to extort money from Kawakami, threatening to sue her if she does not comply.\n\nAs a Confidant, Kawakami represents the [[Temperance (Tarot card)|Temperance]] Arcana.<ref name=\"Arcana\"/> She helps Joker with chores and gives him free time in class. Initially saying that it pays her sister's medical bills, Kawakami's second job allows her no time to rest and she is hospitalized with exhaustion. When Joker changes the hearts of Takase's guardians, she quits her second job and resolves to be a better teacher. Upon completing her Confidant, Kawakami gives Joker a coupon for free maid service before he leaves Tokyo.

The player can volunteer to aid his public speaking to build up his Confidant, during which it is learned that the scandal which destroyed his credibility was not his fault; his old mentor misappropriated funds and blamed Yoshida. By the end of the Confidant, Yoshida has won a sizable base for his upcoming campaign; the culprit behind the scandal is revealed, allowing him to confront his problems.

He is known as the King because of his top score in the [[shoot 'em up]] [[arcade game|arcade]] game, ''Gun About''. Shinya idolizes the Phantom Thieves, and Joker asks him for his help in defeating a cheating gamer in Mementos.\n\nAs a Confidant, Shinya represents the [[The Tower (Tarot card)|Tower]] Arcana<ref name=\"Arcana\" /> and teaches Joker gun moves in ''Gun About'', which Joker utilizes in the Metaverse. Despite his popularity at the arcade, he is swept up in a prank war with his classmates and vows to win (an aggressive trait learned from his mother, Hanae). When his classmates accuse him of bullying, he questions himself and becomes concerned when he realizes that his mother has become more unreasonable, arguing with his school concerning his education. After Hanae sees Shinya hanging out with Joker, she accuses the latter of being a bad influence to her son and threatens to report him to the police. After Joker changes her heart, Shinya makes amends to his classmates and gives Joker a Gun Controller before he leaves Tokyo.\n\n===Takuto Maruki===\n:Voiced by (English): Billy Kametz<br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Satoshi Hino]]\n{{nihongo|Takuto Maruki|\u4e38\u559c \u62d3\u4eba|Maruki Takuto}} is a character introduced in ''Persona 5 Royal'' and represents the new Councillor Arcana, which has never been introduced in any of the past games. He is a new counselor that arrives at Shujin Academy after the arrest of Kamoshida. The students seem to really like him, as he is able to listen to them and give them good advice. Contrary to Kasumi, his opinion towards the Phantom Thieves is very positive, as he thinks their actions can bring happiness and justice to people. It is eventually revealed he is a Persona user with the ability to alter the cognitions of others, altering their personalities and memories, which he uses for truly desperate cases as a stopgap to real treatment, and a peer of Wakaba's whose research was also stolen by Shido. During the conflict with Yaldabaoth, his despair at realizing how uncaring Shujin is towards its students causes him to become vulnerable to Yaldabaoth's own ability to warp cognition, causing part of his Persona [[Adam Kadmon]] to lose a component of itself as a Treasure, causing it to degenerate into [[Azathoth]] and he enters a delusional state where he believes the only way to improve the world is to use his abilities on everyone to create a utopia, becoming the final antagonist of ''Royal''. In the bad/neutral ending, Maruki takes a photo of the phantom thieves during the graduation and leaves the gang as he created a reality that people can have happiness in their lives. In the true ending, Maruki becomes a taxi driver and offers Joker a ride as he is being followed by officers. Maruki tells Joker that he will move forward in his life as well, just like how Joker and his friends will do the same.\n\n==Reception==\nThe game's characters were generally well-received.

Situated between [[Austinmer, New South Wales|Austinmer]] and [[Bulli, New South Wales|Bulli]], it is approximately 13 kilometres north of Wollongong, and 69&nbsp;km south of [[Sydney]]. It lies between the Pacific Ocean and a section of the [[Illawarra escarpment]] known as Lady Fuller Park, adjacent to Bulli Pass Scenic Reserve.\n\n==History==\n{{sources|section|date=July 2017}}\n[[File:George St Thirroul undated (RAHS Photograph Collection) (27733725271).jpg|thumb|View of George Street, date unknown]]\nBefore European settlement, Wodi Wodi [[Australian Aborigines|Aborigine]]s inhabited the area known then as Thurrural, meaning \"The Valley of the Cabbage Tree Palms\". Cabbage tree palms were once plentiful in the area. Early white settlers used cabbage tree palms to make strong fence posts. The trees are still present on either side of [[Bulli Pass]].\n\nEarly settlement began in the late 1860s in the hilly area of the village as the lower beachside area was swampy and susceptible to flooding with high tides sometimes combining with heavy rain. Occupations consisted of farming, [[Toona ciliata|cedar]] logging, whaling and fruit growing and eventually mining when the Bulli Mine was opened in 1859 and the [[Bulli Jetty, Sandon Point, New South Wales|Bulli Jetty]] which shipped the coal from the mine opened in 1863. The township was known as North Bulli until February 1880 when the name of Robbinsville was chosen. The new name was decided upon at a meeting of ten men (including Frederick Robbins) in George's Whitford's \"big new House\" (located on the site of today's Ryans Hotel) in 1880.<ref name=\"councilhistory\">{{cite web | url=http://council.wollongong.nsw.gov.au/library/onlineresources/suburbprofiles/Pages/Thirroul.aspx#gref | title=Thirroul | publisher=Wollongong City Council | accessdate=2019-09-12}}</ref> One suggestion for a name for the place was \"Mudmire\" but somehow Robbins convinced the others to call the town after himself. It only had a total population of 490 in 1891.\n\nThe town was then known as Robbinsville until 1892, when the name \"Thirroul\" was officially adopted by the Railways Department - most probably due to the influence of the politician Archibald Campbell who was also then owner and editor of the Illawarra Mercury who included both the names \"Thirroul (\"cabbage tree\") and \"Throon\" (\"bush leech - 'blackfellow doctor'\") in a still-extant list of Aboriginal words he compiled in the early 1890s. The name \"Thirroul\", however, appears to be a misnomer. William Saddler (a well known Aboriginal elder from Port Kembla) contacted the Illawarra Mercury newspaper and complained about the \"meaningless\" name. He said the area was called \"Throon\" which meant \"Bush leech\". Saddler claims Aboriginal people warned their children about the large number of leeches found high on the escarpment near the site of what would later become the Excelsior Colliery.\n\nIn 1888 the rail link with Sydney was finished. Early construction workers on the railway caused a population increase, and the eastern side of the town progressed rapidly. The [[Thirroul Railway Depot|Thirroul Locomotive Depot]] opened in 1917. It closed in 1965 and only the barracks for the accommodation of the railway crews remain. The Railway Institute Hall (opened in 1920) where workers once studied has been classified as a heritage building. The construction of the rail link also created an increase in tourism for Thirroul. It became a popular family seaside holiday destination with boarding houses and holiday cottages in demand.\n\nTwo known early residents include Samuel McCauley and Frederick Robbins.<ref name=\"councilhistory\"></ref> McCauley was one of the oldest residents of the Illawarra district when he died in June 1899 in Thirroul. A street in Thirroul has been named McCauley street. Robbins was a prominent resident who gave his name to the township of North Bulli as it was then called. He was made the first postmaster of Robbinsville in 1888 after, along with other residents, lobbying the government to supply a post office and railway platform.\n\nIn 1898 the ''Amy'' was shipwrecked on the rocks at the southern end of Thirroul beach. All of its crew died. A memorial plaque to the Amy and her crew is located in the Thirroul Beach Park.<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://monumentaustralia.org.au/themes/disaster/maritime/display/23464-brig-%22amy%22 | title=Brig \"Amy\" | publisher=Monument Australia | accessdate=2019-09-12}}</ref>\n\nCoal mining operations began at the start of the 20th century and miners needed residences, though logging had been occurring before for some time.\n\n[[File:Thirroul circa 1920.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Thirroul circa 1920 showing the town as it was described by D. H Lawrence.]]\nThe world-famous English author, [[D. H. Lawrence]] visited Thirroul in 1922 and wrote the novel ''[[Kangaroo (novel)|Kangaroo]]'' about Australian fringe politics after the First World War whilst there. Overlooking the Pacific Ocean, his house Wyewurk is the earliest Australian bungalow to show the influence of the [[Californian Bungalow]] style of architecture. He gave this description of the town: \"...&nbsp;The town trailed down from the foot of the mountain towards the railway, a huddle of grey and red painted iron roofs. Then over the rail line towards the sea, it began again in a spasmodic fashion&nbsp;... There were wide unmade roads running straight as to go nowhere, with little bungalow homes&nbsp;... Then quite near the inland, rose a great black wall of mountain or cliff&nbsp;...\". \n\nA park and a monument (dedicated 21 November 1988) commemorate D H Lawrence's time at Thirroul in 1922 when he wrote the novel \"Kangaroo\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://monumentaustralia.org.au/themes/people/arts/display/23465-d.-h.-lawrence | title=D.H.

Lawrence at Thirroul'' by lifelong Thirroul resident Joseph Davis was published by Collins (Sydney) in 1989 and questioned many of the assumptions made by Robert Darroch in his 1981 work entitled \"D.H. Lawrence in Australia\" published by Macmillan (Melbourne). The Cambridge edition of Kangaroo (edited by Bruce Steele) tended to accept the views of Davis rather than those of Darroch. Davis has gone on to write numerous articles and a number of books about art and the environment in Thirroul and the local area, including \"Greetings from Thirroul\" (1994), \"Greetings from Wollongong\" (1995), \"The Illawarra Society of Artists\" (2001), \"Lake Illawarra: an ongoing history\" (2005), \"John Brown of Brownsville\" (2011), \"Gooseberry & Hooka\" (2012),\"One Hundred Seasons\" (2014), \"Wobbly Wollongong\" (2016), \"The Real Alexander Harris\" (2018) and \"Rachel Henning and Deighton Taylor in Illawarra 1853-1896\" (2019).<ref>{{cite book | title=D.H.

Don was the founding Chairperson and Lynne Jones, the founding Secretary. In 1983 the population of less than 5,000 qualified Thirroul as a village. In 1993 the TVC won the Basil Ryan gold award at the Rise & Shine Awards presentation for improved streetscapes. The Thirroul Seaside and Arts Festival, which is a successful community event, was the idea of Don Gray. The first festival was run in 1993. Lynne Jones organised the Festival for many years, building to the point where it was handed over to the Lions Club.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalencounters.org/he/thirroul/ | title=Historical Encounters: Thirroul | publisher=Historical Encoutners | accessdate=2019-09-12}}</ref>\n\nAnother community event was \"the Growing Green Kids Festival' \u2013 a not-for-profit event which was the brain-child of resident Cate Wilson (1948\u20132012). Cate was also President of the Thirroul Action Group (TAG) - an environmental group which has functioned for around 30 years. Residents concerned about health risks picketed against the Telstra phone tower in 1997. Storms and floods severely affected the Thirroul area in August 1998.{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn August 2007, Thirroul's CBD and beach was declared an alcohol free zone as a council initiative to prevent public drinking on streets and footpaths within the designated area. A local developer, John Comelli, re-opened the old King's Picture Theatre In Thirroul as Anita's Theatre in 2007 after a lavish refurbishment. In June 2011 the theatre was purchased for $1.05 million by a consortium headed by Rennie Cristini. A buyer from Sydney with a \"vested interest in theatre\" is the new owner of Anita's Theatre in Thirroul. In 2013, the property sold for $1.4million \u2013 $350,000 more than its last sale price in 2011\" according to the ''Illawarra Mercury''. (Illawarra Mercury 15 November 2013).\n\nThirroul resident Don Gray has released (June 2011) a self-published book of his memories called ''My Thirroul'' illustrated by local artist, Christine Hill. A children's playground was opened by Wollongong Council with a plaque carrying their names on 4 July 2012. Some of the art work evokes Gray's memories of an elephant stuck in the former Thirroul Beach lagoon on the current site of the playground \u2013 a story he recalled (and which Christine Hill illustrated) in his book. Gray died on 28 April 2013, aged 93 (Illawarra Mercury, 30 April 2013).\n\n== Heritage listings ==\nThirroul has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* Illawarra railway: [[Thirroul railway station]]<ref name=nswshr-1269>{{cite NSW SHR|5012246|Thirroul Railway Station Group|hr=01269|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Commerce & services==\nThe town's major commercial area lies between an area just north of Bulli Pass, where the [[Princes Highway]] splits to form the [[Lawrence Hargrave Drive]], to [[Thirroul railway station, New South Wales|Thirroul Station]], over the bridge and past the main centre and the [http://www.anitastheatrethirroul.com Anita's Theatre] building.

Anita's Theatre was for sale as of May 2010 but was purchased for 1.05 million dollars in 2011 by a consortium of Italian investors. The boutique clothing and jewellery shops, florists, conveniences stores, news agencies and other shopping essentials make it the main shopping area for the northern suburbs of Wollongong. Thirroul also has a sub-branch of the [[Returned and Services League of Australia]] (RSL).\n\nThirroul is part of the Northern Illawarra Chamber of Commerce<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nicc.net.au | title=Northern Illawarra Chamber of Commerce | accessdate=2019-09-12}}</ref>, which was established in 1996 and is recognised as an official body by the Wollongong City Council. Its aim is to promote the identity of the Northern Illawarra in co-operation with local business owners, the residents community, and government and tourism bodies to generate local business growth for the region.\n\nThere are two primary schools, St. Michael's and Thirroul Public School. St. Michael's<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.smtdow.catholic.edu.au | title=St Michael's Thirroul | accessdate=2019-09-12}}</ref> is a Catholic school that was established by the [[Sisters of St. Joseph]] in 1940 and is located in Station Street. The current principal is Mrs. Belinda Hughes. Thirroul Public school<ref>{{cite web | url=https://thirroul-p.schools.nsw.gov.au/ | title=Thirroul Public School | accessdate=2019-09-12}}</ref> was established in 1889 after Frederick Robbins sold one acre of his land, \"well situated and elevated, being the centre of population\", to the Department of Education for the purpose of building a school and teacher's residence. The school subsequently opened in 1889 with 154 children on the roll. Thirroul Public School is located in Roxburgh Avenue. The current principal is Mr. Gary Graham. Thirroul also has a Thirroul Scout Group as part of the Scout Association of Australia, NSW Branch.\n\nIn June 2009, the new Thirroul District Library and Community centre was opened. This library offers email and word processing, inter-library loans, photocopying and printing, free Internet access and children's programs.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://council.wollongong.nsw.gov.au/library/usingthelibrary/Pages/branches.aspx | title=Wollongong City Libraries: Library hours and locations | accessdate=2019-09-12}}</ref>\n\nThe annual Thirroul Seaside & Arts Festival<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.thirroulfestival.com/  | title=Thirroul Seaside and Arts Festival | accessdate=2019-09-12}}</ref> is held over a weekend in the first week of April. It includes activities such as art exhibitions and workshops, kids activities, live stage entertainment, buskers, a variety of stalls, pony and carnival rides and face painting. The festival won the 2003 Illawarra tourism Award in the events/festivals category. Involved in organising the event is the Austimer-Thirroul Lions Club. The festival actively involves community organisations, educational institutions, sporting groups, performing and visual art studios, scouts, surf lifesavers and the general public.\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nIn the {{CensusAU|2016}}, there were 6,083 people in Thirroul. 79.9% of residents were born in Australia compared to 72.7% for the Wollongong Local Government LGA. The next most common countries of birth in Thirroul were England at 5.5% and New Zealand at 1.7%. In addition, 89.7% of the Thirroul population only spoke English in the home, compared with 78.2% for the Wollongong LGA.<ref name=\"Census\"/><ref>{{Census 2016 AUS | id = LGA18450| name = Wollongong (C)|quick=on|accessdate=16  July 2017}}</ref>  \n\nThe most common responses for religion were No Religion 37.8%, Catholic 24.4% and Anglican 16.7%.<ref name=\"Census\"/>\n\nThe median weekly household income for Thirroul was $1,947 which is higher than the Wollongong LGA median of $1339. Levels of qualification in Thirroul are also higher than the Wollongong LGA, with 60% of population completing tertiary education compared with an average of 47% across the LGA. Of the employed people in Thirroul, 5.0% worked in Higher Education. Other major industries of employment included Hospitals 4.8%, Secondary Education 4.0% and Primary Education 4.0%.<ref name=\"Census\"/><ref>{{Census 2016 AUS | id = LGA18450| name = Wollongong (C)|quick=on|accessdate=16  July 2017}}</ref> \n \nMany former Sydneysiders have moved to Thirroul and now commute to work from the northern area and real estate prices have become ridiculously expensive. The price of a now near derelict house with ocean glimpses in Spray Street Thirroul increased from $80,000 in 1986 to selling for $1,560,000 on 7 May 2016 - an increase of some 1900%. Average Weekly Earnings have simply not kept pace with such dramatic rises. Few employment opportunities exist in the suburb with much of the labour force commuting to Sydney for work.\n\n== Transport ==\n\n[[Thirroul railway station]] is a major station on the South Coast railway. Although not as important as in steam days, it is the major station between [[Wollongong]] and the Sydney metropolitan area. Local Wollongong suburban services terminate at Thirroul, while all express intercity services stop at Thirroul. Passenger services are provided by [[NSW TrainLink]]. Thirroul retains a number of passing / refuge sidings for the many coal trains from Metropolitan Colliery and the western coalfields which pass through the town.\n\n[[File:Thirroul railway station entrance.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the railway station]]\nThirroul is served by express and all stations trains on the [[NSW TrainLink]] [[South Coast railway line, New South Wales|South Coast line]]. All trains stop at Thirroul. In 2005, the station was equipped with lifts.\n\n[[Lawrence Hargrave Drive]] starts just south of Thirroul at the Princes Highway in [[Bulli, New South Wales|Bulli]] and travels north through Thirroul, connecting with the Old [[Princes Highway]] and [[Southern Freeway]] at the [[Helensburgh]] exit.\n\n== Thirroul Beach ==\n\nThirroul beach is a prominent feature, as well as the backdrop of the 400 metre (1,300 ft) high escarpment, attracting many bush-walkers to northern [[Austinmer, New South Wales|Austinmer]] and surfers to both beaches. The beach is popular with both locals and tourists, becoming particularly busy in summer months and long weekends. The beach is 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) long and backed by a large, grassy reserve. Swimming can be potentially hazardous because of permanent and shifting rips. The beach is patrolled in summer and a 50 metres (160 ft) [[ocean pool]] is located near the beach. The Thirroul Surf Lifesaving Club<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thirroulsurfclub.com.au/ | title=Thirroul Surf Club |accessdate=2019-09-10}}</ref> was established in 1907 as one of 14 foundation clubs in NSW. There have also been complaints of under-age drinking, noise and anti-social behaviour occurring on Thirroul Beach Park after dark, especially in the summer months.{{CN|date=August 2017}} Former [[Ironman (surf lifesaving)|Ironman]] champions Darren and [[Dean Mercer]] are from Thirroul<ref name=news.com-died>{{cite news |last1=Koubaridis|first1=Andrew |last2=Matthey|first2=James  |url=http://www.news.com.au/sport/high-profile-former-athlete-dies-on-the-gold-coast/news-story/6220d7c599f248a5d7205831f2b9a703 |title=High profile former Ironman Dean Mercer dies on the Gold Coast |work=news.com.au |date=28 August 2017|accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref> and their parents still reside in the town.\n\nThe SLSC is the home of the Thirroul Seagulls IRB ([[Inflatable Rescue Boat|inflatable rescue boat]]) Racing Team, who have competed strongly for the last 15 years.{{cn|date=August 2017}}\n\n[[File:Thirroul Aerial.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial photo from north west]]\n\nThirroul is an exposed beach and [[reef break]], and has reliable surf all year. The most desirable wind for surfing there is [[offshore wind]]s from the west north-west. Most of the surf  comes from |groundswells, with the best swell direction the south-east. The beach break provides for both left and right-handers. Caution should be taken with rips, rocks, sharks and, during the summer, bluebottles.\n\n== Natural environment and wildlife ==\n\nThe Sandon Point Stockland development, has given rise to much controversy and conflict between developers and environmental and Aboriginal groups over Aboriginal heritage and coastal wetland and floodplain since 1989, is just south in Bulli. Dootch Kennedy, Al Oshlack and Karen Gough have co-ordinated a series of legal actions against the development's impact on Aboriginal heritage. This protest is ongoing, and included a 24/7 picket for five years before an arson attack, and a continuing Aboriginal Tent Embassy. Resident Jill Walker has been heroic in taking Stockland and the Minister for Planning to both the Land and Environment and Supreme Courts over a number of outstanding non-Aboriginal environmental issues relating to the development. It is also the starting/finishing point to the bike track that runs south to Wollongong, the Wollongong to Thirroul Bike Track. The escarpment area is rich in its variety of birdlife. Recorded birds in the northern suburbs of Wollongong include the Australian King Parrot, Crimson Rosella, Eastern Sea Eagle and the Brown Gerygone.\n\n==Sport==\nSporting teams have been a prominent part of Thirroul history and the \"working class\" people that established the village. Many of the existing sporting clubs having history dating back to the early settlement.\n\nThirroul is represented in the Tooheys Illawarra Rugby League by the [[Thirroul Butchers]]. The Butchers were established in 1913. Star players include Ben Couchman, Brendon Smith, Aaron Beath and Fuad Suljkanovic.  The Thirroul Butchers attract crowds between 500 and 1500 a game, depending on their opponents.\n\nThirroul is also home to the Thirroul Junior Football Club (TJFC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thirroulfootball.com.au | title=Thirroul Junior Football Club  | accessdate=2019-09-12}} </ref> The club consists of many male & female junior teams ranging from under 6's to under 18's, 4 senior women's sides and 3 senior men's. In 2002 the first senior women's football side was entered into the local IWSA competition, that team went on to finish third in their inaugural season. The first senior men's side, the Thunder, was established for the 2008 season. That same year the women's sides became affectionately known as: 'The Thunderbirds'. Currently Thirroul is the only club in the Illawarra to enter a women's team into each of the IWFA's 4 competitions: Premier / Reserve Grade, Division 1 and Over 30s.\n\nFootball (soccer) is played at the southern end of the local Thomas Gibson Park and rugby league is held at the northern end which has a large grandstand. Thirroul is also part of the Northern Suburbs Netball Club. The Thirroul Amateur Swimming Club has been operating in Thirroul since 1954. Swim nights are conducted weekly between October and March. The club is non-profit and affiliated with NSW Swimming.\n\nThirroul District Cricket Club was established in 1896. It is believed the original home ground was the current site of Slacky Flat, before games moved to Gibson Park in the early 1900s. In 1976/77, Woonona Cricket Club folded and merged with Thirroul Cricket Club. In the mid 1990s, the unenviable decision to relocate the club's home ground to Hollymount Park, Woonona was made and in 1996 the Senior division of the club underwent a name change from Thirroul Cricket Club to Northern Districts Cricket Club.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://ndcc.nsw.cricket.com.au/ | title=Northern Districts Cricket Club |accessdate=2019-09-12}} </ref> Initially matches were played on the western turf pitch of Hollymount Park however in 2005 a new five (5) pitch turf wicket square was installed on the Eastern side of Hollymount Park and the Eastern clubhouse was redeveloped. The junior division of the club incorporates both names as Thirroul & Northern Districts Cricket Club.\n\n==In popular culture==\nThirroul features in the musical piece ''Small Town'' by Australian composer [[Peter Sculthorpe]]. A note published by Faber Music<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fabermusic.com/repertoire/small-town-941 |title=Small Town (1976)| publisher=Faber Music | accessdate=2019-09-12}}</ref> states that forty years after the visit of D.H. Lawrence and his novel ''Kangaroo'', \"Peter Sculthorpe envisaged Thirroul as the quintessential Australian town, frozen in a more innocent time\". The music evokes the architecture of the town, the township monument and includes a rendering of the [[Last Post]] evoking an [[Anzac Day]] ceremony at the town war memorial.\n\n==Churches==\n* [http://www.thirroulcatholic.org.au/ St Michael's Catholic Church]\n* [http://www.austianglicanchurch.org.au/ St David's Anglican Church]\n* [http://c3churchthirroul.com/ C3 Church Thirroul]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.thirroulguru.com Thirroul Shop Directory & Events Web Portal]\n*[http://www.thirroulvillage.com Thirroul Village Committee Web Portal]\n*[http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/ABSNavigation/prenav/LocationSearch?locationLastSearchTerm=thirroul&locationSearchTerm=thirroul&newarea=SSC15246&submitbutton=View+QuickStats+%3E&mapdisplay=on&collection=Census&period=2006&areacode=SSC15246&geography=&method=&productlabel=&producttype=QuickStats&topic=&navmapdisplayed=true&javascript=true&breadcrumb=PL&topholder=0&leftholder=0&currentaction=104&action=401&textversion=false&subaction=1 Thirroul Census Quick Stats]\\\n*[http://www.thirroulfestival.com/ Thirroul Seaside Festival Homepage]\n*[http://sandon-point.org.au/ Sandon Point struggle vs Stockland]\n*http://www.southcoastleisuretimes.com.au/illawarra/thirroul.html\n*https://maps.google.com/maps?client=safari&rls=en-us&q=thirroul&oe=UTF-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&split=0&ei=rTikSoACg4eRBdOaqfcP&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=title&resnum=1\n*http://www.facebook.com/ThirroulHistoryInPhotos\n*http://www.facebook.com/AustinmerHistoryPhotographs\n\n{{Wollongong suburbs}}\n\n[[Category:Suburbs of Wollongong]]\n[[Category:City of Wollongong]]\n[[Category:Thirroul, New South Wales]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Australian English|date=September 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2017}}\n{{refimprove|date=September 2011}}\n{{Infobox Australian place | type = suburb\n| name     = Thirroul\n| city     = [[Wollongong, New South Wales|Wollongong]]\n| state    = nsw\n| image    = Subpointlookout.jpg\n| caption  = Lookout from the [[Illawarra escarpment|Illawarra Escarpment]] above [[Wombarra]] over the northern [[Illawarra]] plain viewing [[Austinmer]], [[Thirroul]], [[Bulli, New South Wales|Bulli]], [[Wollongong]] up to [[Port Kembla, New South Wales|Port Kembla]] in the far distance.\n| lga      = City of Wollongong\n| postcode = 2515\n| coordinates = {{coord|34|18|59.3|S|150|55|7.9|E|display=inline,title}}\n| est      = \n| pop      = 6,083\n| pop_year = {{CensusAU|2016}}\n| pop_footnotes = <ref name=\"Census\">{{Census 2016 AUS | id = SSC13848| name = Thirroul (State Suburb)|quick=on|accessdate=16  July 2017}}</ref>\n| elevation= \n| area     = \n| stategov = [[Electoral district of Keira|Keira]]\n| fedgov   = [[Division of Cunningham|Cunningham]]\n| near-nw  = \n| near-n   = [[Austinmer, New South Wales|Austinmer]]\n| near-ne  = \n| near-w   = \n| near-e   = \n| near-sw  = \n| near-s   = [[Bulli, New South Wales|Bulli]]\n| near-se  = \n| dist1    = \n| location1= \n}}\n\n'''Thirroul''' is a northern  seaside suburb of the city of [[Wollongong, New South Wales|Wollongong]], [[Australia]].   Situated between [[Austinmer, New South Wales|Austinmer]] and [[Bulli, New South Wales|Bulli]], it is approximately 13 kilometres north of Wollongong, and 69&nbsp;km south of [[Sydney]]. It lies between the Pacific Ocean and a section of the [[Illawarra escarpment]] known as Lady Fuller Park, adjacent to Bulli Pass Scenic Reserve.\n\n==History==\n{{sources|section|date=July 2017}}\n[[File:George St Thirroul undated (RAHS Photograph Collection) (27733725271).jpg|thumb|View of George Street, date unknown]]\nBefore European settlement, Wodi Wodi [[Australian Aborigines|Aborigine]]s inhabited the area known then as Thurrural, meaning \"The Valley of the Cabbage Tree Palms\". Cabbage tree palms were once plentiful in the area. Early white settlers used cabbage tree palms to make strong fence posts. The trees are still present on either side of [[Bulli Pass]].\n\nEarly settlement began in the late 1860s in the hilly area of the village as the lower beachside area was swampy and susceptible to flooding with high tides sometimes combining with heavy rain. Occupations consisted of farming, [[Toona ciliata|cedar]] logging, whaling and fruit growing and eventually mining when the Bulli Mine was opened in 1859 and the [[Bulli Jetty, Sandon Point, New South Wales|Bulli Jetty]] which shipped the coal from the mine opened in 1863. The township was known as North Bulli until February 1880 when the name of Robbinsville was chosen. The new name was decided upon at a meeting of ten men (including Frederick Robbins) in George's Whitford's \"big new House\" (located on the site of today's Ryans Hotel) in 1880<ref name=\"councilhistory\">{{cite web | url=http://council.wollongong.nsw.gov.au/library/onlineresources/suburbprofiles/Pages/Thirroul.aspx#gref | title=Thirroul | publisher=Wollongong City Council | accessdate=2019-09-12}}</ref>. One suggestion for a name for the place was \"Mudmire\" but somehow Robbins convinced the others to call the town after himself. It only had a total population of 490 in 1891.\n\nThe town was then known as Robbinsville until 1892, when the name \"Thirroul\" was officially adopted by the Railways Department - most probably due to the influence of the politician Archibald Campbell who was also then owner and editor of the Illawarra Mercury who included both the names \"Thirroul (\"cabbage tree\") and \"Throon\" (\"bush leech - 'blackfellow doctor'\") in a still-extant list of Aboriginal words he compiled in the early 1890s. The name \"Thirroul\", however, appears to be a misnomer. William Saddler (a well known Aboriginal elder from Port Kembla) contacted the Illawarra Mercury newspaper and complained about the \"meaningless\" name. He said the area was called \"Throon\" which meant \"Bush leech\". Saddler claims Aboriginal people warned their children about the large number of leeches found high on the escarpment near the site of what would later become the Excelsior Colliery.\n\nIn 1888 the rail link with Sydney was finished. Early construction workers on the railway caused a population increase, and the eastern side of the town progressed rapidly. The [[Thirroul Railway Depot|Thirroul Locomotive Depot]] opened in 1917. It closed in 1965 and only the barracks for the accommodation of the railway crews remain. The Railway Institute Hall (opened in 1920) where workers once studied has been classified as a heritage building. The construction of the rail link also created an increase in tourism for Thirroul. It became a popular family seaside holiday destination with boarding houses and holiday cottages in demand.\n\nTwo known early residents include Samuel McCauley and Frederick Robbins<ref name=\"councilhistory\"></ref>. McCauley was one of the oldest residents of the Illawarra district when he died in June 1899 in Thirroul. A street in Thirroul has been named McCauley street. Robbins was a prominent resident who gave his name to the township of North Bulli as it was then called. He was made the first postmaster of Robbinsville in 1888 after, along with other residents, lobbying the government to supply a post office and railway platform.\n\nIn 1898 the ''Amy'' was shipwrecked on the rocks at the southern end of Thirroul beach. All of its crew died. A memorial plaque to the Amy and her crew is located in the Thirroul Beach Park<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://monumentaustralia.org.au/themes/disaster/maritime/display/23464-brig-%22amy%22 | title=Brig \"Amy\" | publisher=Monument Australia | accessdate=2019-09-12}}</ref>.\n\nCoal mining operations began at the start of the 20th century and miners needed residences, though logging had been occurring before for some time.\n\n[[File:Thirroul circa 1920.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Thirroul circa 1920 showing the town as it was described by D. H Lawrence.]]\nThe world-famous English author, [[D. H. Lawrence]] visited Thirroul in 1922 and wrote the novel ''[[Kangaroo (novel)|Kangaroo]]'' about Australian fringe politics after the First World War whilst there. Overlooking the Pacific Ocean, his house Wyewurk is the earliest Australian bungalow to show the influence of the [[Californian Bungalow]] style of architecture. He gave this description of the town: \"...&nbsp;The town trailed down from the foot of the mountain towards the railway, a huddle of grey and red painted iron roofs. Then over the rail line towards the sea, it began again in a spasmodic fashion&nbsp;... There were wide unmade roads running straight as to go nowhere, with little bungalow homes&nbsp;... Then quite near the inland, rose a great black wall of mountain or cliff&nbsp;...\". \n\nA park and a monument (dedicated 21 November 1988) commemorate D H Lawrence's time at Thirroul in 1922 when he wrote the novel \"Kangaroo\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://monumentaustralia.org.au/themes/people/arts/display/23465-d.-h.-lawrence | title=D.H. Lawrence | publisher=Monument Australia | accessdate=2019-09-12}}</ref>.\n\nThe book ''D.H. Lawrence at Thirroul'' by lifelong Thirroul resident Joseph Davis was published by Collins (Sydney) in 1989 and questioned many of the assumptions made by Robert Darroch in his 1981 work entitled \"D.H. Lawrence in Australia\" published by Macmillan (Melbourne). The Cambridge edition of Kangaroo (edited by Bruce Steele) tended to accept the views of Davis rather than those of Darroch. Davis has gone on to write numerous articles and a number of books about art and the environment in Thirroul and the local area, including \"Greetings from Thirroul\" (1994), \"Greetings from Wollongong\" (1995), \"The Illawarra Society of Artists\" (2001), \"Lake Illawarra: an ongoing history\" (2005), \"John Brown of Brownsville\" (2011), \"Gooseberry & Hooka\" (2012),\"One Hundred Seasons\" (2014), \"Wobbly Wollongong\" (2016), \"The Real Alexander Harris\" (2018) and \"Rachel Henning and Deighton Taylor in Illawarra 1853-1896\" (2019)<ref>{{cite book | title=D.H.

Don was the founding Chairperson and Lynne Jones, the founding Secretary. In 1983 the population of less than 5,000 qualified Thirroul as a village. In 1993 the TVC won the Basil Ryan gold award at the Rise & Shine Awards presentation for improved streetscapes. The Thirroul Seaside and Arts Festival, which is a successful community event, was the idea of Don Gray. The first festival was run in 1993. Lynne Jones organised the Festival for many years, building to the point where it was handed over to the Lions Club<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalencounters.org/he/thirroul/ | title=Historical Encounters: Thirroul | publisher=Historical Encoutners | accessdate=2019-09-12}}</ref>.\n\nAnother community event was \"the Growing Green Kids Festival' \u2013 a not-for-profit event which was the brain-child of resident Cate Wilson (1948\u20132012). Cate was also President of the Thirroul Action Group (TAG) - an environmental group which has functioned for around 30 years. Residents concerned about health risks picketed against the Telstra phone tower in 1997. Storms and floods severely affected the Thirroul area in August 1998.{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn August 2007, Thirroul's CBD and beach was declared an alcohol free zone as a council initiative to prevent public drinking on streets and footpaths within the designated area. A local developer, John Comelli, re-opened the old King's Picture Theatre In Thirroul as Anita's Theatre in 2007 after a lavish refurbishment. In June 2011 the theatre was purchased for $1.05 million by a consortium headed by Rennie Cristini. A buyer from Sydney with a \"vested interest in theatre\" is the new owner of Anita's Theatre in Thirroul. In 2013, the property sold for $1.4million \u2013 $350,000 more than its last sale price in 2011\" according to the ''Illawarra Mercury''. (Illawarra Mercury 15 November 2013).\n\nThirroul resident Don Gray has released (June 2011) a self-published book of his memories called ''My Thirroul'' illustrated by local artist, Christine Hill. A children's playground was opened by Wollongong Council with a plaque carrying their names on 4 July 2012. Some of the art work evokes Gray's memories of an elephant stuck in the former Thirroul Beach lagoon on the current site of the playground \u2013 a story he recalled (and which Christine Hill illustrated) in his book. Gray died on 28 April 2013, aged 93 (Illawarra Mercury, 30 April 2013).\n\n== Heritage listings ==\nThirroul has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* Illawarra railway: [[Thirroul railway station]]<ref name=nswshr-1269>{{cite NSW SHR|5012246|Thirroul Railway Station Group|hr=01269|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Commerce & services==\nThe town's major commercial area lies between an area just north of Bulli Pass, where the [[Princes Highway]] splits to form the [[Lawrence Hargrave Drive]], to [[Thirroul railway station, New South Wales|Thirroul Station]], over the bridge and past the main centre and the [http://www.anitastheatrethirroul.com Anita's Theatre] building.

St. Michael's<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.smtdow.catholic.edu.au | title=St Michael's Thirroul | accessdate=2019-09-12}}</ref> is a Catholic school that was established by the [[Sisters of St. Joseph]] in 1940 and is located in Station Street. The current principal is Mrs. Belinda Hughes. Thirroul Public school<ref>{{cite web | url=https://thirroul-p.schools.nsw.gov.au/ | title=Thirroul Public School | accessdate=2019-09-12}}</ref> was established in 1889 after Frederick Robbins sold one acre of his land, \"well situated and elevated, being the centre of population\", to the Department of Education for the purpose of building a school and teacher's residence. The school subsequently opened in 1889 with 154 children on the roll. Thirroul Public School is located in Roxburgh Avenue. The current principal is Mr. Gary Graham. Thirroul also has a Thirroul Scout Group as part of the Scout Association of Australia, NSW Branch.\n\nIn June 2009, the new Thirroul District Library and Community centre was opened. This library offers email and word processing, inter-library loans, photocopying and printing, free Internet access and children's programs.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://council.wollongong.nsw.gov.au/library/usingthelibrary/Pages/branches.aspx | title=Wollongong City Libraries: Library hours and locations | accessdate=2019-09-12}}</ref>\n\nThe annual Thirroul Seaside & Arts Festival<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.thirroulfestival.com/  | title=Thirroul Seaside and Arts Festival | accessdate=2019-09-12}}</ref> is held over a weekend in the first week of April. It includes activities such as art exhibitions and workshops, kids activities, live stage entertainment, buskers, a variety of stalls, pony and carnival rides and face painting. The festival won the 2003 Illawarra tourism Award in the events/festivals category. Involved in organising the event is the Austimer-Thirroul Lions Club. The festival actively involves community organisations, educational institutions, sporting groups, performing and visual art studios, scouts, surf lifesavers and the general public.\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nIn the {{CensusAU|2016}}, there were 6,083 people in Thirroul. 79.9% of residents were born in Australia compared to 72.7% for the Wollongong Local Government LGA. The next most common countries of birth in Thirroul were England at 5.5% and New Zealand at 1.7%. In addition, 89.7% of the Thirroul population only spoke English in the home, compared with 78.2% for the Wollongong LGA.<ref name=\"Census\"/><ref>{{Census 2016 AUS | id = LGA18450| name = Wollongong (C)|quick=on|accessdate=16  July 2017}}</ref>  \n\nThe most common responses for religion were No Religion 37.8%, Catholic 24.4% and Anglican 16.7%.<ref name=\"Census\"/>\n\nThe median weekly household income for Thirroul was $1,947 which is higher than the Wollongong LGA median of $1339. Levels of qualification in Thirroul are also higher than the Wollongong LGA, with 60% of population completing tertiary education compared with an average of 47% across the LGA. Of the employed people in Thirroul, 5.0% worked in Higher Education. Other major industries of employment included Hospitals 4.8%, Secondary Education 4.0% and Primary Education 4.0%.<ref name=\"Census\"/><ref>{{Census 2016 AUS | id = LGA18450| name = Wollongong (C)|quick=on|accessdate=16  July 2017}}</ref> \n \nMany former Sydneysiders have moved to Thirroul and now commute to work from the northern area and real estate prices have become ridiculously expensive. The price of a now near derelict house with ocean glimpses in Spray Street Thirroul increased from $80,000 in 1986 to selling for $1,560,000 on 7 May 2016 - an increase of some 1900%. Average Weekly Earnings have simply not kept pace with such dramatic rises. Few employment opportunities exist in the suburb with much of the labour force commuting to Sydney for work.\n\n== Transport ==\n\n[[Thirroul railway station]] is a major station on the South Coast railway. Although not as important as in steam days, it is the major station between [[Wollongong]] and the Sydney metropolitan area. Local Wollongong suburban services terminate at Thirroul, while all express intercity services stop at Thirroul. Passenger services are provided by [[NSW TrainLink]]. Thirroul retains a number of passing / refuge sidings for the many coal trains from Metropolitan Colliery and the western coalfields which pass through the town.\n\n[[File:Thirroul railway station entrance.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the railway station]]\nThirroul is served by express and all stations trains on the [[NSW TrainLink]] [[South Coast railway line, New South Wales|South Coast line]]. All trains stop at Thirroul. In 2005, the station was equipped with lifts.\n\n[[Lawrence Hargrave Drive]] starts just south of Thirroul at the Princes Highway in [[Bulli, New South Wales|Bulli]] and travels north through Thirroul, connecting with the Old [[Princes Highway]] and [[Southern Freeway]] at the [[Helensburgh]] exit.\n\n== Thirroul Beach ==\n\nThirroul beach is a prominent feature, as well as the backdrop of the 400 metre (1,300 ft) high escarpment, attracting many bush-walkers to northern [[Austinmer, New South Wales|Austinmer]] and surfers to both beaches. The beach is popular with both locals and tourists, becoming particularly busy in summer months and long weekends. The beach is 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) long and backed by a large, grassy reserve. Swimming can be potentially hazardous because of permanent and shifting rips. The beach is patrolled in summer and a 50 metres (160 ft) [[ocean pool]] is located near the beach. The Thirroul Surf Lifesaving Club<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thirroulsurfclub.com.au/ | title=Thirroul Surf Club |accessdate=2019-09-10}}</ref> was established in 1907 as one of 14 foundation clubs in NSW. There have also been complaints of under-age drinking, noise and anti-social behaviour occurring on Thirroul Beach Park after dark, especially in the summer months.{{CN|date=August 2017}} Former [[Ironman (surf lifesaving)|Ironman]] champions Darren and [[Dean Mercer]] are from Thirroul<ref name=news.com-died>{{cite news |last1=Koubaridis|first1=Andrew |last2=Matthey|first2=James  |url=http://www.news.com.au/sport/high-profile-former-athlete-dies-on-the-gold-coast/news-story/6220d7c599f248a5d7205831f2b9a703 |title=High profile former Ironman Dean Mercer dies on the Gold Coast |work=news.com.au |date=28 August 2017|accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref> and their parents still reside in the town.\n\nThe SLSC is the home of the Thirroul Seagulls IRB ([[Inflatable Rescue Boat|inflatable rescue boat]]) Racing Team, who have competed strongly for the last 15 years.{{cn|date=August 2017}}\n\n[[File:Thirroul Aerial.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial photo from north west]]\n\nThirroul is an exposed beach and [[reef break]], and has reliable surf all year. The most desirable wind for surfing there is [[offshore wind]]s from the west north-west. Most of the surf  comes from |groundswells, with the best swell direction the south-east. The beach break provides for both left and right-handers. Caution should be taken with rips, rocks, sharks and, during the summer, bluebottles.\n\n== Natural environment and wildlife ==\n\nThe Sandon Point Stockland development, has given rise to much controversy and conflict between developers and environmental and Aboriginal groups over Aboriginal heritage and coastal wetland and floodplain since 1989, is just south in Bulli. Dootch Kennedy, Al Oshlack and Karen Gough have co-ordinated a series of legal actions against the development's impact on Aboriginal heritage. This protest is ongoing, and included a 24/7 picket for five years before an arson attack, and a continuing Aboriginal Tent Embassy. Resident Jill Walker has been heroic in taking Stockland and the Minister for Planning to both the Land and Environment and Supreme Courts over a number of outstanding non-Aboriginal environmental issues relating to the development. It is also the starting/finishing point to the bike track that runs south to Wollongong, the Wollongong to Thirroul Bike Track. The escarpment area is rich in its variety of birdlife. Recorded birds in the northern suburbs of Wollongong include the Australian King Parrot, Crimson Rosella, Eastern Sea Eagle and the Brown Gerygone.\n\n==Sport==\nSporting teams have been a prominent part of Thirroul history and the \"working class\" people that established the village. Many of the existing sporting clubs having history dating back to the early settlement.\n\nThirroul is represented in the Tooheys Illawarra Rugby League by the [[Thirroul Butchers]]. The Butchers were established in 1913. Star players include Ben Couchman, Brendon Smith, Aaron Beath and Fuad Suljkanovic.  The Thirroul Butchers attract crowds between 500 and 1500 a game, depending on their opponents.\n\nThirroul is also home to the Thirroul Junior Football Club (TJFC)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thirroulfootball.com.au | title=Thirroul Junior Football Club  | accessdate=2019-09-12}} </ref>. The club consists of many male & female junior teams ranging from under 6's to under 18's, 4 senior women's sides and 3 senior men's. In 2002 the first senior women's football side was entered into the local IWSA competition, that team went on to finish third in their inaugural season. The first senior men's side, the Thunder, was established for the 2008 season. That same year the women's sides became affectionately known as: 'The Thunderbirds'. Currently Thirroul is the only club in the Illawarra to enter a women's team into each of the IWFA's 4 competitions: Premier / Reserve Grade, Division 1 and Over 30s.\n\nFootball (soccer) is played at the southern end of the local Thomas Gibson Park and rugby league is held at the northern end which has a large grandstand. Thirroul is also part of the Northern Suburbs Netball Club. The Thirroul Amateur Swimming Club has been operating in Thirroul since 1954. Swim nights are conducted weekly between October and March. The club is non-profit and affiliated with NSW Swimming.\n\nThirroul District Cricket Club was established in 1896. It is believed the original home ground was the current site of Slacky Flat, before games moved to Gibson Park in the early 1900s. In 1976/77, Woonona Cricket Club folded and merged with Thirroul Cricket Club. In the mid 1990s, the unenviable decision to relocate the club's home ground to Hollymount Park, Woonona was made and in 1996 the Senior division of the club underwent a name change from Thirroul Cricket Club to Northern Districts Cricket Club.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://ndcc.nsw.cricket.com.au/ | title=Northern Districts Cricket Club |accessdate=2019-09-12}} </ref> Initially matches were played on the western turf pitch of Hollymount Park however in 2005 a new five (5) pitch turf wicket square was installed on the Eastern side of Hollymount Park and the Eastern clubhouse was redeveloped. The junior division of the club incorporates both names as Thirroul & Northern Districts Cricket Club.\n\n==In popular culture==\nThirroul features in the musical piece ''Small Town'' by Australian composer [[Peter Sculthorpe]]. A note published by Faber Music<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fabermusic.com/repertoire/small-town-941 |title=Small Town (1976)| publisher=Faber Music | accessdate=2019-09-12}}</ref> states that forty years after the visit of D.H. Lawrence and his novel ''Kangaroo'', \"Peter Sculthorpe envisaged Thirroul as the quintessential Australian town, frozen in a more innocent time\". The music evokes the architecture of the town, the township monument and includes a rendering of the [[Last Post]] evoking an [[Anzac Day]] ceremony at the town war memorial.\n\n==Churches==\n* [http://www.thirroulcatholic.org.au/ St Michael's Catholic Church]\n* [http://www.austianglicanchurch.org.au/ St David's Anglican Church]\n* [http://c3churchthirroul.com/ C3 Church Thirroul]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.thirroulguru.com Thirroul Shop Directory & Events Web Portal]\n*[http://www.thirroulvillage.com Thirroul Village Committee Web Portal]\n*[http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/ABSNavigation/prenav/LocationSearch?locationLastSearchTerm=thirroul&locationSearchTerm=thirroul&newarea=SSC15246&submitbutton=View+QuickStats+%3E&mapdisplay=on&collection=Census&period=2006&areacode=SSC15246&geography=&method=&productlabel=&producttype=QuickStats&topic=&navmapdisplayed=true&javascript=true&breadcrumb=PL&topholder=0&leftholder=0&currentaction=104&action=401&textversion=false&subaction=1 Thirroul Census Quick Stats]\\\n*[http://www.thirroulfestival.com/ Thirroul Seaside Festival Homepage]\n*[http://sandon-point.org.au/ Sandon Point struggle vs Stockland]\n*http://www.southcoastleisuretimes.com.au/illawarra/thirroul.html\n*https://maps.google.com/maps?client=safari&rls=en-us&q=thirroul&oe=UTF-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&split=0&ei=rTikSoACg4eRBdOaqfcP&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=title&resnum=1\n*http://www.facebook.com/ThirroulHistoryInPhotos\n*http://www.facebook.com/AustinmerHistoryPhotographs\n\n{{Wollongong suburbs}}\n\n[[Category:Suburbs of Wollongong]]\n[[Category:City of Wollongong]]\n[[Category:Thirroul, New South Wales]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirroul,_New_South_Wales"}

Out of these styrenic block copolymers (TPE-s) are CAWITON, THERMOLAST K, THERMOLAST M, Sofprene, Dryflex and Laprene. Desmopan or Elastollan are examples of [[thermoplastic polyurethane]]s (TPU). Sarlink, Santoprene, Termoton, Solprene, THERMOLAST V, Vegaprene,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hutchinson.com/en/innovation-materials|title=Innovation in materials|website=www.hutchinson.com|access-date=2017-02-27}}</ref> or Forprene are examples of TPV materials. Examples of [[thermoplastic olefin]] elastomers (TPO) compound are For-Tec E or Engage. [[Ninjaflex]] used for [[3D printing]].\n\nIn order to qualify as a thermoplastic elastomer, a material must have these three essential characteristics:\n*The ability to be stretched to moderate elongations and, upon the removal of stress, return to something close to its original shape\n*Processable as a melt at elevated temperature\n*Absence of significant [[creep (deformation)|creep]]\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:SBSstructure.svg|thumb|SBS block copolymer schematic microstructure]]\n\nTPE became a commercial reality when thermoplastic polyurethane polymers became available in the 1950s. During the 1960s styrene block copolymer became available, and in the 1970s a wide range of TPEs came on the scene. The worldwide usage of TPEs (680,000 tons/year in 1990) is growing at about nine percent per year. The styrene-butadiene materials possess a two-phase microstructure due to incompatibility between the [[polystyrene]] and [[polybutadiene]] blocks, the former separating into spheres or rods depending on the exact composition. With low polystyrene content, the material is elastomeric with the properties of the polybutadiene predominating. Generally they offer a much wider range of properties than conventional cross-linked rubbers because the composition can vary to suit final construction goals.\n\n[[File:Sbs block copolymer.jpg|thumb|SBS block copolymer in TEM]]\n\nBlock copolymers are interesting because they can \"microphase separate\" to form periodic nanostructures, as in the styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) block copolymer shown at right. The polymer is known as [[Kraton (polymer)|Kraton]] and is used for shoe soles and [[adhesive]]s. Owing to the microfine structure, a [[transmission electron microscope]] (TEM) was needed to examine the structure. The butadiene matrix was stained with [[osmium tetroxide]] to provide contrast in the image. The material was made by [[living polymerization]] so that the blocks are almost [[monodisperse]], so helping to create a very regular microstructure. The [[molecular weight]] of the polystyrene blocks in the main picture is 102,000; the inset picture has a molecular weight of 91,000, producing slightly smaller domains. The spacing between domains has been confirmed by [[small-angle X-ray scattering]], a technique which gives information about [[microstructure]].\nSince most polymers are incompatible with one another, forming a block polymer will usually result in phase separation, and the principle has been widely exploited since the introduction of the SBS block polymers, especially where one of the block is highly crystalline. One exception to the rule of incompatibility is the material [[Noryl]], where polystyrene and [[polyphenylene oxide]] or PPO form a continuous blend with one another.\n\n[[File:CrystTPE.svg|thumb|upright|Schematic crystalline block copolymer]]\n\nOther TPEs have crystalline domains where one kind of block co-crystallizes with other block in adjacent chains, such as in copolyester rubbers, achieving the same effect as in the SBS block polymers. Depending on the block length, the domains are generally more stable than the latter owing to the higher crystal [[melting point]]. That point determines the processing temperatures needed to shape the material, as well as the ultimate service use temperatures of the product. Such materials include Hytrel, a polyester-polyether copolymer and [[Pebax]], a nylon or polyamide-polyether copolymer.\n\n== Advantages ==\nDepending on the environment, TPEs have outstanding thermal properties and material stability when exposed to a broad range of temperatures and non-polar materials.<ref name=\":0\" /> TPEs consume less energy to produce, can be colored easily by most dyes, and allow economical quality control. TPE requires little or no compounding, with no need to add reinforcing agents, stabilizers or cure systems. Hence, batch-to-batch variations in weighting and metering components are absent, leading to improved consistency in both raw materials and fabricated articles.  TPE materials have the potential to be [[recycling|recyclable]] since they can be molded, extruded and reused like plastics, but they have typical elastic properties of rubbers which are not recyclable owing to their thermosetting characteristics. They can also be ground up and turned into 3D printing filament with a [[recyclebot]].\n\n== Processing ==\nThe two most important manufacturing methods with TPEs are [[extrusion]] and injection molding. TPEs can now be [[3D printing|3D printed]] and have been shown to be economically advantageous to make products using [[distributed manufacturing]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Woern|first=Aubrey L.|last2=Pearce|first2=Joshua M.|date=2017-10-30|title=Distributed Manufacturing of Flexible Products: Technical Feasibility and Economic Viability|journal=Technologies|language=en|volume=5|issue=4|pages=71|doi=10.3390/technologies5040071|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://3dprint.com/192599/flexible-3d-printer-filament/|title=Is Flexible 3D Printer Filament Worth the Investment? {{!}} 3DPrint.com {{!}} The Voice of 3D Printing / Additive Manufacturing|website=3dprint.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-10|date=2017-10-30}}</ref> [[Compression molding]] is seldom, if ever, used. Fabrication via injection molding is extremely rapid and highly economical. Both the equipment and methods normally used for the extrusion or injection molding of a conventional thermoplastic are generally suitable for TPEs.

These materials find large application in the automotive sector and in household appliances sector. In 2014 the world market for TPEs reached a volume of ca. 16.7 billion US dollars. About 40% of all TPE products are used in the manufacturing of vehicles.<ref name=\"ceresana.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/plastics/thermoplastic-elastomers/|title=Thermoplastic Elastomers (TPE) - Market Study - Ceresana|first=Marcel|last=Kuehner|website=www.ceresana.com}}</ref> For instance copolyester TPEs are used in [[snowmobile]] tracks where stiffness and abrasion resistance are at a premium.

Thermoplastic silicone and olefin blends are used for extrusion of glass run and dynamic [[weatherstripping]] car profiles. Styrene block copolymers are used in shoe soles for their ease of processing, and widely as adhesives. Owing to their unrivaled abilities in two-component injection molding to various thermoplastic substrates, engineered TPS materials also cover a broad range of technical applications ranging from automotive market to consumer and medical products. Examples of those are soft grip surfaces, design elements, back-lit switches and surfaces, as well as sealings, gaskets, or damping elements. TPE is commonly used to make suspension [[Bushing (isolator)|bushings]] for automotive performance applications because of its greater resistance to deformation when compared to regular rubber bushings.  Thermoplastics have experienced growth in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning ([[HVAC]]) industry due to the function, cost effectiveness and adaptability to modify [[Microplastics|plastic resins]] into a variety of covers, fans and housings. TPE may also be used in medical devices,  electrical cable jacket and inner [[insulator (electrical)|insulation]], [[sex toys]], and some [[Headphones|headphone]] cables.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* PR Lewis and C Price, ''Polymer'', 13, 20 (1972)\n* Modern Plastic Mid-October Encyclopedia Issue, Introduction to TPEs, ''page:109-110''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Thermoplastic Elastomer}}\n[[Category:Thermoplastic elastomers| ]]\n[[Category:Biomaterials]]\n[[Category:Polymers]]\n", "text_old": "{{More footnotes|date=May 2014}}\n\n'''Thermoplastic elastomers''' ('''TPE'''), sometimes referred to as '''thermoplastic rubbers''', are a class of [[copolymer]]s or a [[polymer blend|physical mix of polymers]] (usually a plastic and a rubber) that consist of materials with both [[thermoplastic]] and [[elastomer]]ic properties.

[[Ninjaflex]] used for [[3D printing]].\n\nIn order to qualify as a thermoplastic elastomer, a material must have these three essential characteristics:\n*The ability to be stretched to moderate elongations and, upon the removal of stress, return to something close to its original shape\n*Processable as a melt at elevated temperature\n*Absence of significant [[creep (deformation)|creep]]\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:SBSstructure.svg|thumb|SBS block copolymer schematic microstructure]]\n\nTPE became a commercial reality when thermoplastic polyurethane polymers became available in the 1950s. During the 1960s styrene block copolymer became available, and in the 1970s a wide range of TPEs came on the scene. The worldwide usage of TPEs (680,000 tons/year in 1990) is growing at about nine percent per year. The styrene-butadiene materials possess a two-phase microstructure due to incompatibility between the [[polystyrene]] and [[polybutadiene]] blocks, the former separating into spheres or rods depending on the exact composition. With low polystyrene content, the material is elastomeric with the properties of the polybutadiene predominating. Generally they offer a much wider range of properties than conventional cross-linked rubbers because the composition can vary to suit final construction goals.\n\n[[File:Sbs block copolymer.jpg|thumb|SBS block copolymer in TEM]]\n\nBlock copolymers are interesting because they can \"microphase separate\" to form periodic nanostructures, as in the styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) block copolymer shown at right. The polymer is known as [[Kraton (polymer)|Kraton]] and is used for shoe soles and [[adhesive]]s. Owing to the microfine structure, a [[transmission electron microscope]] (TEM) was needed to examine the structure. The butadiene matrix was stained with [[osmium tetroxide]] to provide contrast in the image. The material was made by [[living polymerization]] so that the blocks are almost [[monodisperse]], so helping to create a very regular microstructure. The [[molecular weight]] of the polystyrene blocks in the main picture is 102,000; the inset picture has a molecular weight of 91,000, producing slightly smaller domains. The spacing between domains has been confirmed by [[small-angle X-ray scattering]], a technique which gives information about [[microstructure]].\nSince most polymers are incompatible with one another, forming a block polymer will usually result in phase separation, and the principle has been widely exploited since the introduction of the SBS block polymers, especially where one of the block is highly crystalline. One exception to the rule of incompatibility is the material [[Noryl]], where polystyrene and [[polyphenylene oxide]] or PPO form a continuous blend with one another.\n\n[[File:CrystTPE.svg|thumb|upright|Schematic crystalline block copolymer]]\n\nOther TPEs have crystalline domains where one kind of block co-crystallizes with other block in adjacent chains, such as in copolyester rubbers, achieving the same effect as in the SBS block polymers. Depending on the block length, the domains are generally more stable than the latter owing to the higher crystal [[melting point]]. That point determines the processing temperatures needed to shape the material, as well as the ultimate service use temperatures of the product. Such materials include Hytrel, a polyester-polyether copolymer and [[Pebax]], a nylon or polyamide-polyether copolymer.\n\n== Advantages ==\nDepending on the environment, TPEs have outstanding thermal properties and material stability when exposed to a broad range of temperatures and non-polar materials.<ref name=\":0\" /> TPEs consume less energy to produce, can be colored easily by most dyes, and allow economical quality control. TPE requires little or no compounding, with no need to add reinforcing agents, stabilizers or cure systems. Hence, batch-to-batch variations in weighting and metering components are absent, leading to improved consistency in both raw materials and fabricated articles.  TPE materials have the potential to be [[recycling|recyclable]] since they can be molded, extruded and reused like plastics, but they have typical elastic properties of rubbers which are not recyclable owing to their thermosetting characteristics. They can also be ground up and turned into 3D printing filament with a [[recyclebot]].\n\n== Processing ==\nThe two most important manufacturing methods with TPEs are [[extrusion]] and injection molding. TPEs can now be [[3D printing|3D printed]] and have been shown to be economically advantageous to make products using [[distributed manufacturing]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Woern|first=Aubrey L.|last2=Pearce|first2=Joshua M.|date=2017-10-30|title=Distributed Manufacturing of Flexible Products: Technical Feasibility and Economic Viability|journal=Technologies|language=en|volume=5|issue=4|pages=71|doi=10.3390/technologies5040071|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://3dprint.com/192599/flexible-3d-printer-filament/|title=Is Flexible 3D Printer Filament Worth the Investment? {{!}} 3DPrint.com {{!}} The Voice of 3D Printing / Additive Manufacturing|website=3dprint.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-10|date=2017-10-30}}</ref> [[Compression molding]] is seldom, if ever, used. Fabrication via injection molding is extremely rapid and highly economical. Both the equipment and methods normally used for the extrusion or injection molding of a conventional thermoplastic are generally suitable for TPEs. TPEs can also be processed by [[blow molding]], melt calendaring,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tut.fi/ms/muo/vert/8_processing/5.1.htm|title=Processing methods for thermoplastic elastomers-TPE - Introduction|website=www.tut.fi|access-date=2016-10-27}}</ref> [[thermoforming]], and [[heat welding]].\n\n== Applications ==\nTPEs are used where conventional elastomers cannot provide the range of physical properties needed in the product. These materials find large application in the automotive sector and in household appliances sector. In 2014 the world market for TPEs reached a volume of ca. 16.7 billion US dollars. About 40% of all TPE products are used in the manufacturing of vehicles.<ref name=\"ceresana.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/plastics/thermoplastic-elastomers/|title=Thermoplastic Elastomers (TPE) - Market Study - Ceresana|first=Marcel|last=Kuehner|website=www.ceresana.com}}</ref> For instance copolyester TPEs are used in [[snowmobile]] tracks where stiffness and abrasion resistance are at a premium. Thermoplastic olefins (TPO) are increasingly used as a roofing material<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.astm.org/Standards/D6878.htm|title=ASTM D6878 / D6878M - 17 Standard Specification for Thermoplastic Polyolefin Based Sheet Roofing|website=www.astm.org|access-date=2018-03-18}}</ref>. TPEs are also widely used for [[catheter]]s where nylon block copolymers offer a range of softness ideal for patients.  Thermoplastic silicone and olefin blends are used for extrusion of glass run and dynamic [[weatherstripping]] car profiles. Styrene block copolymers are used in shoe soles for their ease of processing, and widely as adhesives. Owing to their unrivaled abilities in two-component injection molding to various thermoplastic substrates, engineered TPS materials also cover a broad range of technical applications ranging from automotive market to consumer and medical products. Examples of those are soft grip surfaces, design elements, back-lit switches and surfaces, as well as sealings, gaskets, or damping elements. TPE is commonly used to make suspension [[Bushing (isolator)|bushings]] for automotive performance applications because of its greater resistance to deformation when compared to regular rubber bushings.  Thermoplastics have experienced growth in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning ([[HVAC]]) industry due to the function, cost effectiveness and adaptability to modify [[Microplastics|plastic resins]] into a variety of covers, fans and housings. TPE may also be used in medical devices,  electrical cable jacket and inner [[insulator (electrical)|insulation]], [[sex toys]], and some [[Headphones|headphone]] cables.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* PR Lewis and C Price, ''Polymer'', 13, 20 (1972)\n* Modern Plastic Mid-October Encyclopedia Issue, Introduction to TPEs, ''page:109-110''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Thermoplastic Elastomer}}\n[[Category:Thermoplastic elastomers| ]]\n[[Category:Biomaterials]]\n[[Category:Polymers]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoplastic_elastomer"}
