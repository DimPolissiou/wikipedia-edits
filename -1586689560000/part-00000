There were many detached parts of [[Worcestershire]] in the surrounding counties, and conversely there were islands of other counties within Worcestershire.  The 1844'' [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844|Counties (Detached Parts) Act]]'' began the processing of eliminating these, but the process was not completed until 1966, when [[Dudley County Borough|Dudley]] was absorbed into [[Staffordshire]].\n\nThe expansion of [[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]] during and after the [[Industrial Revolution]] also altered the county map considerably.  Local government commissions were set up to recommend changes to the local government structures, and as early as 1945 recommendations were made to merge Worcestershire with [[Herefordshire]].  Eventually in 1974, a form of this recommendation was carried out, most of Worcestershire was combined with Herefordshire to form a new county named [[Hereford & Worcester]], while the northern Black Country towns and villages of Worcestershire, along with adjoining areas of Staffordshire and [[Warwickshire]], formed the new county of [[West Midlands County|West Midlands]].\n\nHereford & Worcester was re-divided into the separate counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire in 1998. Since that time Worcestershire's boundaries have not changed. [[Redditch]] opted to join the [[West Midlands Combined Authority]] as an associate 'non-constituent' member in October 2015, although this will not affect the borough's status within Worcestershire.\n\n==Boundaries before 1844==\n[[Worcestershire]] was established as an administrative and defensive unit in 918,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Worcestershire|last=Brooks|first=Alan|last2=Pevsner|first2=Nikolaus|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780300112986|location=New Haven and London|pages=2}}</ref> to take into account the estates held by the [[Bishop of Worcester|Episcopus Hwicciorum]] and the abbeys of [[Pershore Abbey|Pershore]] and [[Evesham Abbey|Evesham]].

Other similar urban areas in England, such as [[Lancashire]], [[Tyneside]], [[London]] and within [[Yorkshire West Riding]], had grown in size since the Industrial Revolution. The expansion of these conurbations saw economic and physical integration with neighbouring towns and communities. This process became more prominent due to growing housing issues, extensive bombing during World War II, slum clearance, and continuing migration into urban areas. The Black Country contained a combination of county boroughs, urban districts, municipal boroughs and county councils (See Fig 6) taking responsibility for services, which resulted in a fragmented local government infrastructure. The ''[[Local Government Act 1958]]'' appointed a Local Government Commission to review administrative structures and boundaries in England outside London. The Act designated a ''West Midlands Special Review Area'',<ref>Local Government Act 1958 c.55</ref> whose recommendations would ultimately form the ''West Midlands Order 1965'' legislation. A second report known as the ''West Midlands General Review'' looked into the administrative authorities within the wider [[West Midlands (region)|region]], including the remainder of Worcestershire.<ref>Local Government Commission for England: Report No 2. West Midlands General Review</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Special Review Area===\nThe commission made its report in July 1961.  It recommended that the Black Country area should be administered by large county boroughs, and that the remaining urban districts or municipal boroughs be merged into these authorities. The original county council's responsibility for services within the majority of the conurbation were curtailed and association with the historic [[shire]] was for ceremonial purposes only. The West Midlands Special Review Area included Dudley, Oldbury, Stourbridge and Halesowen (as per Fig. 6). The latter two council areas were not incorporated into a county borough, as part of the eventual ''West Midlands Order 1965''. Halesowen was proposed to be included within an enlarged Smethwick County Borough, but a successful campaign entitled \"Hands off Halesowen\" orchestrated by a non-partisan group called the \"Halesowen Independence Committee\" helped stop the plans.<ref>[http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk Black Country Bugle] [http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html Hands off Halesowen \u2013 Town's 1960 Campaign For Independence] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814151133/http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html |date=14 August 2014 }} \u2013 Retrieved 13 August 2014</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the second report into the West Midland General Review area was also delivered in July 1961 and a proposal for Worcester to lose its county borough status<ref>The British Medical Journal \u2013 Vol. 1, No. 5242, 24 June 1961 \"Local Government Commission's Reports on West Midlands\"</ref> was not implemented.<ref>\"How Local government Areas Stand Today\", The Times, 12 February 1966</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Order 1965===\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 250\n| image1 = West_Midlands_Order_1965.png\n| caption1 =  Fig 7: The boundaries of South Staffordshire, West Warwickshire and North Worcestershire after the local government reorganisations of the 1960s.\n| image2 = Warley map.png\n| caption2 = The County Borough of Warley \u2013 Warley's boundaries are shown as blue.

The county of Hereford & Worcester was to be reviewed again, despite an earlier structural review which recommended no change to the county.\n\nVarious options were put to consultation, including:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

''Preference of Malvern Hills District Council and supported by Leominster District Council.''\n|-\n| '''Hybrid''' || A unitary Herefordshire and two tier Worcestershire, based on pre-1974 boundaries (excluding Stourbridge & Halesowen).

''This was put forward by the commission as an alternative structure to the final recommendation''\n|}\n\nOther ideas put forward and discounted before the consultation stage included a complete restoration of the pre-1974 Worcestershire county boundary. This option included Stourbridge and Halesowen, as they were under the jurisdiction of Worcestershire County Council until 1 April 1974.

There were many detached parts of [[Worcestershire]] in the surrounding counties, and conversely there were islands of other counties within Worcestershire.  The 1844'' [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844|Counties (Detached Parts) Act]]'' began the processing of eliminating these, but the process was not completed until 1966, when [[Dudley County Borough|Dudley]] was absorbed into [[Staffordshire]].\n\nThe expansion of [[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]] during and after the [[Industrial Revolution]] also altered the county map considerably.  Local government commissions were set up to recommend changes to the local government structures, and as early as 1945 recommendations were made to merge Worcestershire with [[Herefordshire]].  Eventually in 1974, a form of this recommendation was carried out, most of Worcestershire was combined with Herefordshire to form a new county named [[Hereford & Worcester]], while the northern Black Country towns and villages of Worcestershire, along with adjoining areas of Staffordshire and [[Warwickshire]], formed the new county of [[West Midlands County|West Midlands]].\n\nHereford & Worcester was re-divided into the separate counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire in 1998. Since that time Worcestershire's boundaries have not changed. [[Redditch]] opted to join the [[West Midlands Combined Authority]] as an associate 'non-constituent' member in October 2015, although this will not affect the borough's status within Worcestershire.\n\n==Boundaries before 1844==\n[[Worcestershire]] was established as an administrative and defensive unit in 918,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Worcestershire|last=Brooks|first=Alan|last2=Pevsner|first2=Nikolaus|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780300112986|location=New Haven and London|pages=2}}</ref> to take into account the estates held by the [[Bishop of Worcester|Episcopus Hwicciorum]] and the abbeys of [[Pershore Abbey|Pershore]] and [[Evesham Abbey|Evesham]].

Other similar urban areas in England, such as [[Lancashire]], [[Tyneside]], [[London]] and within [[Yorkshire West Riding]], had grown in size since the Industrial Revolution. The expansion of these conurbations saw economic and physical integration with neighbouring towns and communities. This process became more prominent due to growing housing issues, extensive bombing during World War II, slum clearance, and continuing migration into urban areas. The Black Country contained a combination of county boroughs, urban districts, municipal boroughs and county councils (See Fig 6) taking responsibility for services, which resulted in a fragmented local government infrastructure. The ''[[Local Government Act 1958]]'' appointed a Local Government Commission to review administrative structures and boundaries in England outside London. The Act designated a ''West Midlands Special Review Area'',<ref>Local Government Act 1958 c.55</ref> whose recommendations would ultimately form the ''West Midlands Order 1965'' legislation. A second report known as the ''West Midlands General Review'' looked into the administrative authorities within the wider [[West Midlands (region)|region]], including the remainder of Worcestershire.<ref>Local Government Commission for England: Report No 2. West Midlands General Review</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Special Review Area===\nThe commission made its report in July 1961.  It recommended that the Black Country area should be administered by large county boroughs, and that the remaining urban districts or municipal boroughs be merged into these authorities. The original county council's responsibility for services within the majority of the conurbation were curtailed and association with the historic [[shire]] was for ceremonial purposes only. The West Midlands Special Review Area included Dudley, Oldbury, Stourbridge and Halesowen (as per Fig. 6). The latter two council areas were not incorporated into a county borough, as part of the eventual ''West Midlands Order 1965''. Halesowen was proposed to be included within an enlarged Smethwick County Borough, but a successful campaign entitled \"Hands off Halesowen\" orchestrated by a non-partisan group called the \"Halesowen Independence Committee\" helped stop the plans.<ref>[http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk Black Country Bugle] [http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html Hands off Halesowen \u2013 Town's 1960 Campaign For Independence] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814151133/http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html |date=14 August 2014 }} \u2013 Retrieved 13 August 2014</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the second report into the West Midland General Review area was also delivered in July 1961 and a proposal for Worcester to lose its county borough status<ref>The British Medical Journal \u2013 Vol. 1, No. 5242, 24 June 1961 \"Local Government Commission's Reports on West Midlands\"</ref> was not implemented.<ref>\"How Local government Areas Stand Today\", The Times, 12 February 1966</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Order 1965===\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 250\n| image1 = West_Midlands_Order_1965.png\n| caption1 =  Fig 7: The boundaries of South Staffordshire, West Warwickshire and North Worcestershire after the local government reorganisations of the 1960s.\n| image2 = Warley map.png\n| caption2 = The County Borough of Warley \u2013 Warley's boundaries are shown as blue.

The ''Track Pack'' added \"Steamin'\" Steve High and \"Hot Rod\" John Rowe, representing graphics and project direction, respectively. By using these names, this meant that further licensing deals were not required.\n\nThe Super NES version was notable for prominently featuring the [[Toyota]] brand; the name and logo were displayed on various tracks, and pre-race music was inspired by the \"I love what you do for me Toyota\" jingle that was used by the company's marketing campaign at the time of the game's release. This version also lacked any licensing or reference to Ivan Stewart, replacing him instead with the late [[Mickey Thompson]] in the gray truck (primarily without approval from Danny Thompson).

Smith]], [[Edward Albert]], [[Yaphet Kotto]], and [[Kabir Bedi]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins with Lady Electric and Bob. After being chased down another corridor and into an elevator where they both fall to their deaths Bob snaps out of his daydream at the last second. When he comes to, he finds his friends have lost the game in the same fashion. Later, when selecting another game to play on the \"Outlaw [[Bulletin Board System|BBS]]\", they chose one called \"Terminal Entry\",  however, this one is password protected. Thinking that the game was set up by members at [[MIT]], Tom decides that he will crack the password and play it during a vacation planned up in the mountains for the weekend.\n\nColonel Styles and Captain Jackson inform General Stewart of the terrorist situation and request more men to help protect the border over a video conference. But the general is not convinced, so he decides to fly out and take command personally. The terrorist network commander watches a news cast on the television where General Stewart being interviewed by Dominique, the reporter who is also the love interest of Captain Jackson, and decides to place a hit on the general. But the plan was circumvented by Captain Jackson while escorting the general to his hotel.\n\nBack at the dorm room, thinking they have been beaten again, the [[Caltech]] students just about give up on their game \"Dr. Fly\", when Gwen, a friend of Chris who was invited to the  weekend retreat, beats the game with a single command. Meanwhile, the terrorist commander is reminded by his leader over another video conference the stakes of their operation and is given an initiation time frame for their coordinated attack. The Army unit makes progress in finding the communication network for the terrorist by locating the bulletin board system after searching through known listings. When they find the terrorist network they pose as Hassan, the terrorist they killed earlier, but Dan Jackson was distraught about being given the order to have his girlfriend Dominique assassinated.\n\nDuring the weekend getaway, the teenage \"[[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]]\" fail to gain access to \"Terminal Entry\" through brute force password cracking, however when Bob drops one of his Twinkies on the keyboard, he enters the numbers \"5.9.125.35 1/5.25.35\" which was the same numbers as the measurements Lady Electric from the beginning of the movie had said to him. Upon gaining access, the group find a complex computer program which they think is a game.\n\nThe Army anti-terrorism unit tracks down the position of the terrorist command post, and initiate an assault on the location which is a warehouse in the middle of the desert. Before the commander escapes, he assigns the six students to take over command. When the students start playing the game, the commands they issue in play erupt in real life bombings, assassinations, and acts of terrorism. Some of which include a Russian peace delegate, an oil refinery in Los Angeles, airplanes flying in from Lisbon, and themselves.\n\nBob, not knowing the full impact of their influence,  put the six of them on the hit list. Operator 23 was already dispatched before they could countermand the assignment. Coincidentally their car wouldn't start, so Bob leads the group back into the house to arm themselves. When night fell, a large group of terrorists descended upon the house. However, the anti-terrorist unit was one step ahead of the terrorists, and rescued the kids from their impending doom, then proceeded to eradicate the terrorist threat. During the fighting, Bob coaxed by his imagination, the voice in his head of Lady Electric, told him to go back inside to put his initials into the computer as the winner. At the end, even with the terrorists defeated, and the kids safe, Captain Jackson and Colonel Styles know the war is not over.\n\n==See also==\n* [[BBS Door|Door Games]]\n* ''[[The Manhattan Project (film)|The Manhattan Project]]'', and ''[[WarGames]]'', two other movies from the 1980s which covered similar topics dealing with the dangers of technology.\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0092069 |title=Terminal Entry}}\n*{{Rotten Tomatoes|terminal_entry}}\n\n[[Category:1987 films]]\n[[Category:Films about computing]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses|Terminal (disambiguation)}}\n{{All plot|date=June 2017}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Terminal Entry\n| image          = Terminal entry poster.jpg\n| caption        = \n| director       = [[John Kincade]]\n| producer       = [[Sharyon Reis Cobe]]\n| story          = Mark Sobel\n| screenplay     = [[Mark Sobel]] <br /> [[David M.

When they find the terrorist network they pose as Hassan, the terrorist they killed earlier, but Dan Jackson was distraught about being given the order to have his girlfriend Dominique assassinated.\n\nDuring the weekend getaway, the teenage \"[[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]]\" fail to gain access to \"Terminal Entry\" through brute force password cracking, however when Bob drops one of his Twinkies on the keyboard, he enters the numbers \"5.9.125.35 1/5.25.35\" which was the same numbers as the measurements Lady Electric from the beginning of the movie had said to him. Upon gaining access, the group find a complex computer program which they think is a game.\n\nThe Army anti-terrorism unit tracks down the position of the terrorist command post, and initiate an assault on the location which is a warehouse in the middle of the desert. Before the commander escapes, he assigns the six students to take over command. When the students start playing the game, the commands they issue in play erupt in real life bombings, assassinations, and acts of terrorism. Some of which include a Russian peace delegate, an oil refinery in Los Angeles, airplanes flying in from Lisbon, and themselves.\n\nBob, not knowing the full impact of their influence,  put the six of them on the hit list. Operator 23 was already dispatched before they could countermand the assignment. Coincidentally their car wouldn't start, so Bob leads the group back into the house to arm themselves. When night fell, a large group of terrorists descended upon the house. However, the anti-terrorist unit was one step ahead of the terrorists, and rescued the kids from their impending doom, then proceeded to eradicate the terrorist threat. During the fighting, Bob coaxed by his imagination, the voice in his head of Lady Electric, told him to go back inside to put his initials into the computer as the winner. At the end, even with the terrorists defeated, and the kids safe, Captain Jackson and Colonel Styles know the war is not over.\n\n==See also==\n* [[BBS Door|Door Games]]\n* ''[[The Manhattan Project (film)|The Manhattan Project]]'', and ''[[WarGames]]'', two other movies from the 1980s which covered similar topics dealing with the dangers of technology.\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0092069 |title=Terminal Entry}}\n\n[[Category:1987 films]]\n[[Category:Films about computing]]\n", "name_user": "LudaChrisKlein", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_Entry"}

The effect is specifically remarkable when the disclosures concern politicians' income sources, liabilities and asset level instead of just income level.

Additionally, a country should establish a culture of ethical conduct in society with the government setting the good example in order to enhance the intrinsic morality.\n\nIn 1969,{{efn|In 1962, a letter writing campaign attempted but ultimately failed to prevent the construction of the [[Watergate complex#Approval controversies|Watergate complex]] on the grounds that zoning waivers would not have been given had the Vatican not been a major investor.}} Christian anarchist [[Dorothy Day]] argued that God will resolve economic abuses such as corruption.

There, for the first time the old principal-agent approach was moved back where mainly the victim (a society, private or public) and a passive corrupt member (an individual) were considered, whereas the active corrupt part was not in the focus of legal prosecution. Unprecedented, the law of an industrial country directly condemned active corruption, particularly in international business transactions, which was at that time in contradiction to anti-bribery activities of the World Bank and its spin-off organization [[Transparency International]].\n\nAs early as 1989 the OECD had established an ad hoc Working Group in order to explore \"...the concepts fundamental to the offense of corruption, and the exercise of national jurisdiction over offenses committed wholly or partially abroad.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/gov/2001/eng/091801.pdf|title=IMF on OECD Convention, (page 3) Historical Background and Context|website=imf.org}}</ref>\nBased on the FCPA concept, the Working Group presented in 1994 the then \"OECD Anti-Bribery Recommendation\" as precursor for the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention|OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/corruption/oecdantibriberyconvention.htm|title=OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Bearer of Transactions|website=oecd.org}}</ref> which was signed in 1997 by all member countries and came finally into force in 1999.

They found:\n* The theories behind the fight against corruption are moving from a [[Principal agent problem|Principal agent approach]] to a [[collective action problem]]. [[Principal-agent]] theories seem not to be suitable to target systemic corruption.\n* The role of multilateral institutions has been crucial in the fight against corruption. [[UNCAC]] provides a common guideline for countries around the world. Both [[Transparency International]] and the [[World Bank]] provide assistance to national governments in term of diagnostic and design of anti-corruption policies.\n* The use of anti-corruption agencies have proliferated in recent years after the signing of [[UNCAC]]. They found no convincing evidence on the extent of their contribution, or the best way to structure them.\n* Traditionally anti-corruption policies have been based on success experiences and common sense. In recent years there has been an effort to provide a more systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of anti-corruption policies. They found that this literature is still in its infancy.\n* Anti-corruption policies that may be in general recommended to developing countries may not be suitable for post-conflict countries. Anti-corruption policies in fragile states have to be carefully tailored.\n* Anti-corruption policies can improve the business environment. There is evidence that lower corruption may facilitate doing business and improve firm's productivity.

disclosed. Under the following conditions kickbacks in connection with exports abroad are permitted for deduction even without proof of the receiver:\n* Payments must be necessary in order to be able to survive against foreign competition\n* They must be common in the industry\n* A corresponding application must be made to the Treasury each year\n* Payments must be appropriate\n* The payer has to pay a lump-sum to the tax office to be fixed by the Finance Minister (at least 20% of the amount paid).\nIn the absence of the required conditions, for corporate taxable companies paying bribes without proof of the receiver, a special tax of 200% is charged. This special tax may, however, be abated along with the bribe amount as an operating expense.\n\nDenmark: bribe payments are deductible when a clear operational context exists and its adequacy is maintained.\n\nFrance: basically all operating expenses can be deducted. However, staff costs must correspond to an actual work done and must not be excessive compared to the operational significance. This also applies to payments to foreign parties. Here, the receiver shall specify the name and address, unless the total amount in payments per beneficiary does not exceed 500 FF. If the receiver is not disclosed the payments are considered \"r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations occult\" and are associated with the following disadvantages:\n* The business expense deduction (of the bribe money) is eliminated.\n* For corporations and other legal entities, a tax penalty of 100% of the \"r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations occult\" and 75% for voluntary post declaration is to be paid.\n* There may be a general fine of up 200 FF fixed per case.\n\nJapan: in Japan, bribes are deductible as business expenses that are justified by the operation (of the company) if the name and address of the recipient is specified. This also applies to payments to foreigners. If the indication of the name is refused, the expenses claimed are not recognized as operating expenses.\n\nCanada: there is no general rule on the deductibility or non-deductibility of kickbacks and bribes. Hence the rule is that necessary expenses for obtaining the income (contract) are deductible. Payments to members of the public service and domestic administration of justice, to officers and employees and those charged with the collection of fees, entrance fees etc. for the purpose to entice the recipient to the violation of his official duties, can not be abated as business expenses as well as illegal payments according to the Criminal Code.\n\nLuxembourg: bribes, justified by the operation (of a company) are deductible as business expenses. However, the tax authorities may require that the payer is to designate the receiver by name. If not, the expenses are not recognized as operating expenses.\n\nNetherlands: all expenses that are directly or closely related to the business are deductible. This also applies to expenditure outside the actual business operations if they are considered beneficial as to the operation for good reasons by the management. What counts is the good merchant custom. Neither the law nor the administration is authorized to determine which expenses are not operationally justified and therefore not deductible. For the business expense deduction it is not a requirement that the recipient is specified. It is sufficient to elucidate to the satisfaction of the tax authorities that the payments are in the interest of the operation.\n\nAustria: bribes justified by the operation (of a company) are deductible as business expenses. However, the tax authority may require that the payer names the recipient of the deducted payments exactly. If the indication of the name is denied e.g. because of business comity, the expenses claimed are not recognized as operating expenses. This principle also applies to payments to foreigners.\n\nSwitzerland: bribe payments are tax deductible if it is clearly operation initiated and the consignee is indicated.\n\nUS: (rough r\u00e9sum\u00e9: \"generally operational expenses are deductible if they are not illegal according to the FCPA\")\n\nUK: kickbacks and bribes are deductible if they have been paid for operating purposes. The tax authority may request the name and address of the recipient.\"\n\n====\"Specific\" legal corruption: exclusively against foreign countries====\nReferring to the recommendation of the above-mentioned Parliamentary Financial Commission's study,<ref name=study /> the then Kohl administration (1991\u20131994) decided to maintain the legality of corruption against officials exclusively in foreign transactions<ref>the term \"official\" had been limited to German jurisdiction.

Such a savior would be like a man who has fallen among wild beasts\u2014unable to join in the wickedness of his fellows, neither would he be able alone to resist all their fierce natures, and therefore he would be of no use to the State or to his friends, and would have to throw away his life before he had done any good to himself or others.

One common form of police corruption is soliciting or accepting [[bribe]]s in exchange for not reporting organized drug or [[prostitution]] rings or other illegal activities.\n\nAnother example is police officers flouting the police [[code of conduct]] in order to secure convictions of suspects\u2014for example, through the use of [[falsified evidence]]. More rarely, police officers may deliberately and systematically participate in [[organized crime]] themselves. In most major cities, there are [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal affairs]] sections to investigate suspected police corruption or misconduct.

This is also known as [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]] or, in the Middle East, as [[baksheesh]]. It is a common form of corruption. The types of favours given are diverse and may include money, gifts, sexual favours, company shares, entertainment, employment and political benefits. The personal gain that is given can be anything from actively giving preferential treatment to having an indiscretion or crime overlooked.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|last= Wang\n|first= Peng\n|title= The rise of the Red Mafia in China: a case study of organised crime and corruption in Chongqing\n|journal= Trends in Organized Crime\n|year= 2013\n|volume= 16\n|issue= 1\n|pages= 49\u201373\n|doi= 10.1007/s12117-012-9179-8\n}}\n</ref>\n\nBribery can sometimes form a part of the systemic use of corruption for other ends, for example to perpetrate further corruption. Bribery can make officials more susceptible to blackmail or to extortion.\n\n===Embezzlement, theft and fraud===\n{{main|Embezzlement}}\n[[Embezzlement]] and [[theft]] involve someone with access to funds or assets illegally taking control of them. [[Fraud]] involves using deception to convince the owner of funds or assets to give them up to an unauthorized party.\n\nExamples include the misdirection of company funds into \"shadow companies\" (and then into the pockets of corrupt employees), the skimming of [[foreign aid]] money, scams and other corrupt activity.\n\n===Graft===\n{{main|Graft (politics)}}\nThe political act of '''graft''' is when funds intended for public projects are intentionally misdirected to maximize the benefits to private interests of the corrupt individuals.\n\n===Extortion and blackmail===\n{{main|Extortion}}\nWhile [[bribery]] is the use of positive inducements for corrupt aims, [[extortion]] and [[blackmail]] centre around the use of threats. This can be the threat of violence or false imprisonment as well as exposure of an individual's secrets or prior crimes.\n\nThis includes such behavior as an influential person threatening to go to the media if they do not receive speedy medical treatment (at the expense of other patients), threatening a public official with exposure of their secrets if they do not vote in a particular manner, or demanding money in exchange for continued secrecy.\n\n===Influence peddling===\n[[Influence peddling]] is the illegal practice of using one's influence in government or connections with persons in authority to obtain favors or preferential treatment, usually in return for payment.\n\n===Networking===\n{{main|Business networking}}\nNetworking can be an effective way for job-seekers to gain a competitive edge over others in the job-market. The idea is to cultivate personal relationships with prospective employers, selection panelists, and others, in the hope that these personal affections will influence future hiring decisions. This form of networking has been described as an attempt to corrupt formal hiring processes, where all candidates are given an equal opportunity to demonstrate their merits to selectors. The networker is accused of seeking non-meritocratic advantage over other candidates; advantage that is based on personal fondness rather than on any objective appraisal of which candidate is most qualified for the position.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/public-service/just-what-are-you-trying-to-pull-20130928-2ul2m.html|title=Just what are you trying to pull?|date=30 September 2013|access-date=12 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009201017/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/public-service/just-what-are-you-trying-to-pull-20130928-2ul2m.html|archive-date=9 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Networking, Corruption, and Subversion|first=Ned|last=Dobos|date=14 September 2015|journal=J Bus Ethics|volume = 144|issue=3|pages=467\u2013478|doi=10.1007/s10551-015-2853-4}}</ref>\n\n[[File:9 - euro bank notes hidden in sleeve - white background - royalty free, without copyright, public domain photo image.JPG|{{largethumb}}|Euro bank notes hidden in sleeve.]]\n\n===Abuse of discretion===\n{{main|Abuse of discretion}}\n[[Abuse of discretion]] refers to the misuse of one's powers and [[decision-making]] facilities.

Disclosing financial information of government officials to the public is associated with improving institutional accountability and eliminating misbehavior such as vote buying. The effect is specifically remarkable when the disclosures concern politicians' income sources, liabilities and asset level instead of just income level. Any extrinsic aspects that might reduce morality should be eliminated. Additionally, a country should establish a culture of ethical conduct in society with the government setting the good example in order to enhance the intrinsic morality.\n\nIn 1969,{{efn|In 1962, a letter writing campaign attempted but ultimately failed to prevent the construction of the [[Watergate complex#Approval controversies|Watergate complex]] on the grounds that zoning waivers would not have been given had the Vatican not been a major investor.}} Christian anarchist [[Dorothy Day]] argued that God will resolve economic abuses such as corruption.

There, for the first time the old principal-agent approach was moved back where mainly the victim (a society, private or public) and a passive corrupt member (an individual) were considered, whereas the active corrupt part was not in the focus of legal prosecution. Unprecedented, the law of an industrial country directly condemned active corruption, particularly in international business transactions, which was at that time in contradiction to anti-bribery activities of the World Bank and its spin-off organization [[Transparency International]].\n\nAs early as 1989 the OECD had established an ad hoc Working Group in order to explore \"...the concepts fundamental to the offense of corruption, and the exercise of national jurisdiction over offenses committed wholly or partially abroad.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/gov/2001/eng/091801.pdf|title=IMF on OECD Convention, (page 3) Historical Background and Context|website=imf.org}}</ref>\nBased on the FCPA concept, the Working Group presented in 1994 the then \"OECD Anti-Bribery Recommendation\" as precursor for the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention|OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/corruption/oecdantibriberyconvention.htm|title=OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Bearer of Transactions|website=oecd.org}}</ref> which was signed in 1997 by all member countries and came finally into force in 1999.

They found:\n* The theories behind the fight against corruption are moving from a [[Principal agent problem|Principal agent approach]] to a [[collective action problem]]. [[Principal-agent]] theories seem not to be suitable to target systemic corruption.\n* The role of multilateral institutions has been crucial in the fight against corruption. [[UNCAC]] provides a common guideline for countries around the world. Both [[Transparency International]] and the [[World Bank]] provide assistance to national governments in term of diagnostic and design of anti-corruption policies.\n* The use of anti-corruption agencies have proliferated in recent years after the signing of [[UNCAC]]. They found no convincing evidence on the extent of their contribution, or the best way to structure them.\n* Traditionally anti-corruption policies have been based on success experiences and common sense. In recent years there has been an effort to provide a more systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of anti-corruption policies. They found that this literature is still in its infancy.\n* Anti-corruption policies that may be in general recommended to developing countries may not be suitable for post-conflict countries. Anti-corruption policies in fragile states have to be carefully tailored.\n* Anti-corruption policies can improve the business environment. There is evidence that lower corruption may facilitate doing business and improve firm's productivity. [[Rwanda]] in the last decade has made tremendous progress in improving governance and the business environment providing a model to follow for post-conflict countries.<ref name=\"partnerplatform\"

disclosed. Under the following conditions kickbacks in connection with exports abroad are permitted for deduction even without proof of the receiver:\n* Payments must be necessary in order to be able to survive against foreign competition\n* They must be common in the industry\n* A corresponding application must be made to the Treasury each year\n* Payments must be appropriate\n* The payer has to pay a lump-sum to the tax office to be fixed by the Finance Minister (at least 20% of the amount paid).\nIn the absence of the required conditions, for corporate taxable companies paying bribes without proof of the receiver, a special tax of 200% is charged. This special tax may, however, be abated along with the bribe amount as an operating expense.\n\nDenmark: bribe payments are deductible when a clear operational context exists and its adequacy is maintained.\n\nFrance: basically all operating expenses can be deducted. However, staff costs must correspond to an actual work done and must not be excessive compared to the operational significance. This also applies to payments to foreign parties. Here, the receiver shall specify the name and address, unless the total amount in payments per beneficiary does not exceed 500 FF. If the receiver is not disclosed the payments are considered \"r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations occult\" and are associated with the following disadvantages:\n* The business expense deduction (of the bribe money) is eliminated.\n* For corporations and other legal entities, a tax penalty of 100% of the \"r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations occult\" and 75% for voluntary post declaration is to be paid.\n* There may be a general fine of up 200 FF fixed per case.\n\nJapan: in Japan, bribes are deductible as business expenses that are justified by the operation (of the company) if the name and address of the recipient is specified. This also applies to payments to foreigners. If the indication of the name is refused, the expenses claimed are not recognized as operating expenses.\n\nCanada: there is no general rule on the deductibility or non-deductibility of kickbacks and bribes. Hence the rule is that necessary expenses for obtaining the income (contract) are deductible. Payments to members of the public service and domestic administration of justice, to officers and employees and those charged with the collection of fees, entrance fees etc. for the purpose to entice the recipient to the violation of his official duties, can not be abated as business expenses as well as illegal payments according to the Criminal Code.\n\nLuxembourg: bribes, justified by the operation (of a company) are deductible as business expenses. However, the tax authorities may require that the payer is to designate the receiver by name. If not, the expenses are not recognized as operating expenses.\n\nNetherlands: all expenses that are directly or closely related to the business are deductible. This also applies to expenditure outside the actual business operations if they are considered beneficial as to the operation for good reasons by the management. What counts is the good merchant custom. Neither the law nor the administration is authorized to determine which expenses are not operationally justified and therefore not deductible. For the business expense deduction it is not a requirement that the recipient is specified. It is sufficient to elucidate to the satisfaction of the tax authorities that the payments are in the interest of the operation.\n\nAustria: bribes justified by the operation (of a company) are deductible as business expenses. However, the tax authority may require that the payer names the recipient of the deducted payments exactly. If the indication of the name is denied e.g. because of business comity, the expenses claimed are not recognized as operating expenses. This principle also applies to payments to foreigners.\n\nSwitzerland: bribe payments are tax deductible if it is clearly operation initiated and the consignee is indicated.\n\nUS: (rough r\u00e9sum\u00e9: \"generally operational expenses are deductible if they are not illegal according to the FCPA\")\n\nUK: kickbacks and bribes are deductible if they have been paid for operating purposes.

[[Plato]], in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', acknowledges the corrupt nature of political institutions, and recommends that philosophers \"shelter behind a wall\" to avoid senselessly martyring themselves.\n\n''Disciples of philosophy ... have tasted how sweet and blessed a possession philosophy is, and have also seen and been satisfied of the madness of the multitude, and known that there is no one who ever acts honestly in the administration of States, nor any helper who will save any one who maintains the cause of the just. Such a savior would be like a man who has fallen among wild beasts\u2014unable to join in the wickedness of his fellows, neither would he be able alone to resist all their fierce natures, and therefore he would be of no use to the State or to his friends, and would have to throw away his life before he had done any good to himself or others. And he reflects upon all this, and holds his peace, and does his own business. He is like one who retires under the shelter of a wall in the storm of dust and sleet which the driving wind hurries along; and when he sees the rest of mankind full of wickedness, he is content if only he can live his own life and be pure from evil or unrighteousness, and depart in peace and good will, with bright hopes.<ref>Plato, [[Plato]], ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', 496d</ref>''\n\nThe [[New Testament]], in keeping with the tradition of Ancient Greek thought, also frankly acknowledges the corruption of the world (\u1f41 [[wikt:\u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2|\u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2]])<ref>2 Peter 1:4, 2:20.</ref> and claims to offer a way of keeping the spirit \"unspotted from the world.\"<ref>James 1:27.</ref> [[Paul of Tarsus]] acknowledges his readers must inevitably \"deal with the world,\"<ref>1 Cor 7:31.</ref> and recommends they adopt an attitude of \"as if not\" in all their dealings.

However, airlines underwent a fundamental transition to a [[point-to-point transit|point-to-point]] system, which gets customers to their destination in one flight instead of two or three. The massive scale of the A380 design was able to achieve a very low cost for passenger seat-distance, but efficiency here within the hub-and-spoke paradigm was not able to overcome the efficiency of fewer flights required in the point-to-point system. Furthermore, American carriers had been using a multihub strategy, that would only justify the need for a handful of VLAs (''very large aircraft'' with more than 400 seats) such as the A380, and having too few VLAs meant that they could not get achieve economy of scale to spread out the enormous fixed cost of the VLA support infrastructure.<ref>[https://www.businessinsider.com/american-airlines-exec-reveals-why-company-doesnt-use-airbus-a380-2019-4]</ref> Consequently, the orders for VLAs slowed in the mid-2010s, as widebody twin jets now offer similar range and greater fuel efficiency, giving airlines more flexibility at a lower upfront cost.<ref>\"[http://centreforaviation.com/analysis/asian-airlines-changing-presence-at-london-heathrow-pt-1-cathay-and-sia-increase-capacity-96950 Asian Airlines' changing presence at London Heathrow]\", Centre for Aviation, 13 February 2013.</ref><ref name=guangzhou>\"[http://centreforaviation.com/analysis/china-southerns-a380-problems-may-not-be-solved-by-possible-air-china-partnership-103063 China Southern's A380 problems may not be solved by possible Air China partnership]\", CAPA: Centre for Aviation, 2 April 2013.</ref><ref name=spar>Sparaco, Pierre. \"[http://aviationweek.com/awin/opinion-mega-transports-hobbled-their-size Opinion: Mega-Transports Hobbled By Their Size]\" ''[[Aviation Week & Space Technology]]'', 3 March 2014</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title= United Airlines does not see a fit for Airbus A380 |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/04/united-airlines-fleet-idUSL1N0YQ00Z20150604 |agency= Reuters |date= 4 June 2015 |last= Dastin|first= Jeffrey}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n\n===Overview===\n[[File:Airbus A380 cross section.svg|thumb|upright|The A380 cabin cross-section with [[economy-class]] seating]]\nThe A380 was initially offered in two models: the ''A380-800'' and the ''A380F''.\n\nThe A380-800's original configuration carried 555 passengers in a [[travel class|three-class]] configuration<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airbus.com/en/aircraftfamilies/passenger_comfort.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825115419/http://www.airbus.com/en/aircraftfamilies/passenger_comfort.html|archivedate=25 August 2009|title=Airbus A380 Cabin|publisher=Airbus |accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref> or 853 passengers (538 on the main deck and 315 on the upper deck) in a single-class economy configuration.

Airbus is reacting to a changing economy; the recession which began in 2008 saw a drop in market percentage of first class and business seats to six percent and an increase in budget economy travellers. Among other causes is the reluctance of employers to pay for executives to travel in First or Business Class. Airbus' chief of cabin marketing, Ingo Wuggestzer, told Aviation Week and Space Technology that the standard three class cabin no longer reflected market conditions. The 11 seat row on the A380 is accompanied by similar options on other widebodies: nine across on the [[Airbus A330]] and ten across on the [[Airbus A350|A350]].<ref>Flottau, Jens, In a squeeze, Aviation Week & Space Technology, 27 April \u2013 10 May 2015, p. 64</ref>\n\n===Integration with infrastructure and regulations===\n\n====Ground operations====\n[[File:Qatar Airways Airbus A380-800 at Heathrow Airport Terminal 4 before Flying to Doha, 6 Jan 2015.jpg|thumb|[[Aircraft ground handling]] with separate [[jetway]]s for the main and upper deck, and [[ground support equipment]]]]\nIn the 1990s, aircraft manufacturers were planning to introduce larger planes than the [[Boeing 747]].

However, airlines underwent a fundamental transition to a [[point-to-point transit|point-to-point]] system, which gets customers to their destination in one flight instead of two or three. The massive scale of the A380 design was able to achieve a very low cost for passenger seat-distance, but efficiency here within the hub-and-spoke paradigm was not able to overcome the efficiency of fewer flights required in the point-to-point system. Furthermore, American carriers had been using a multihub strategy, that would only justify the need for a handful of VLAs (''very large aircraft'' with more than 400 seats) such as the A380, and having too few VLAs meant that they could not get achieve economy of scale to spread out the enormous fixed cost of the VLA support infrastructure.<ref>[https://www.businessinsider.com/american-airlines-exec-reveals-why-company-doesnt-use-airbus-a380-2019-4]</ref> Consequently, the orders for VLAs slowed in the mid-2010s, as widebody twin jets now offer similar range and greater fuel efficiency, giving airlines more flexibility at a lower upfront cost.<ref>\"[http://centreforaviation.com/analysis/asian-airlines-changing-presence-at-london-heathrow-pt-1-cathay-and-sia-increase-capacity-96950 Asian Airlines' changing presence at London Heathrow]\", Centre for Aviation, 13 February 2013.</ref><ref name=guangzhou>\"[http://centreforaviation.com/analysis/china-southerns-a380-problems-may-not-be-solved-by-possible-air-china-partnership-103063 China Southern's A380 problems may not be solved by possible Air China partnership]\", CAPA: Centre for Aviation, 2 April 2013.</ref><ref name=spar>Sparaco, Pierre. \"[http://aviationweek.com/awin/opinion-mega-transports-hobbled-their-size Opinion: Mega-Transports Hobbled By Their Size]\" ''[[Aviation Week & Space Technology]]'', 3 March 2014</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title= United Airlines does not see a fit for Airbus A380 |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/04/united-airlines-fleet-idUSL1N0YQ00Z20150604 |agency= Reuters |date= 4 June 2015 |last= Dastin|first= Jeffrey}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n\n===Overview===\n[[File:Airbus A380 cross section.svg|thumb|upright|The A380 cabin cross-section with [[economy-class]] seating]]\nThe A380 was initially offered in two models: the ''A380-800'' and the ''A380F''.\n\nThe A380-800's original configuration carried 555 passengers in a [[travel class|three-class]] configuration<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airbus.com/en/aircraftfamilies/passenger_comfort.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825115419/http://www.airbus.com/en/aircraftfamilies/passenger_comfort.html|archivedate=25 August 2009|title=Airbus A380 Cabin|publisher=Airbus |accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref> or 853 passengers (538 on the main deck and 315 on the upper deck) in a single-class economy configuration.

The APU also powers electric generators that provide auxiliary electric power to the aircraft.<ref>{{Cite report|work=Hamilton and Sundstrand |title=Airbus A380 Fact sheet |url=http://www.hamiltonsundstrand.com/StaticFiles/HS/Communications/General/Documents/A380%20Fact%20Sheet_June%202011.pdf |access-date=24 April 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302205101/http://www.hamiltonsundstrand.com/StaticFiles/HS/Communications/General/Documents/A380%20Fact%20Sheet_June%202011.pdf |archivedate=2 March 2013  }}</ref>\n\n===Passenger provisions===\n{{main|Seat configurations of Airbus A380}}\n[[File:Airbus A380-861, Emirates AN1721793.jpg|thumb|10 across [[economy class]] seating]]\n[[File:Airbus A380-861, Emirates AN1385446.jpg|thumb|Emirates [[business class]]]]\n[[File:Etihad Airways aircraft interiors demo ITB 2017 (08).JPG|thumb|Etihad The Residence Apartment with bedroom, living room and an en-suite shower room\non Airbus A380-800]]\n\nThe A380-800's [[Aircraft cabin|cabin]] has {{convert|550|m2|sqft|0}} of usable floor space,<ref>{{cite web |title= Airbus A380 Facts & Figures |date= June 2018 |publisher= Airbus |url= https://www.airbus.com/content/dam/corporate-topics/publications/backgrounders/Backgrounder-Airbus-Commercial-Aircraft-A380-Facts-and-Figures-EN.pdf }}</ref> 40% more than the next largest airliner, the [[Boeing 747-8]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/boeings-747-8-vs-a380-a-titanic-tussle-205137/|title=Boeing's 747-8 vs. A380: A titanic tussle|first=Max|last=Kingsley-Jones|work=Flight International|date=17 February 2006|accessdate=25 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe cabin has features to reduce traveller fatigue such as a quieter interior and higher pressurisation than previous generations of aircraft; the A380 is pressurised to the equivalent altitude of {{convert|1520|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} up to {{convert|12000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Airbus A380 Brief|url=http://a380airbus.com/airbus-a380-cabins/|accessdate=19 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130422021427/http://a380airbus.com/airbus-a380-cabins/|archive-date=22 April 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"norris_wagner_book\"/>{{rp|129}} It has 50% less cabin noise, 50% more cabin area and volume, larger windows, bigger overhead bins, and {{convert|60|cm|ft|abbr=on}} extra headroom versus the 747\u2013400.<ref>{{cite web|title=Global Aircraft \u2013 Airbus A380|url=http://www.globalaircraft.org/planes/airbus_a380.pl |accessdate=19 June 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"a380_figures\">{{cite web|title=Fascinating figures about the A380 |publisher=Airbus |url=http://events.airbus.com/a380/seeing/learnandplay/figures1.asp |accessdate=1 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704190610/http://events.airbus.com/a380/seeing/learnandplay/figures1.asp |archivedate=4 July 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Seating options range from 3-room {{convert|12|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} \"residence\" in first class to 11-across in economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airbus.com/aircraftfamilies/passengeraircraft/a380family/own-the-sky/cabin/|title=Cabin of Airbus A380|work=airbus|access-date=24 April 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231132208/http://www.airbus.com/aircraftfamilies/passengeraircraft/a380family/own-the-sky/cabin/|archivedate=31 December 2016}}</ref> A380 economy seats are up to {{convert|48|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide in a 10-abreast configuration,<ref>{{cite web|title=Onboard the Airbus A380|publisher=[[Fodors]]|url=http://fodors.com/news/story_2432.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020004918/http://fodors.com/news/story_2432.html|archivedate=20 October 2007 |accessdate=6 March 2012}}</ref> compared with the 10-abreast configuration on the 747-400 that typically has seats {{convert|44.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide.<ref>{{cite web|title=747-400 Cross Sections|publisher=Boeing|url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/747family/pf/pf_cross_section.html|accessdate=19 June 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080611225956/http://www.boeing.com/commercial/747family/pf/pf_cross_section.html |archivedate= 11 June 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref> On other aircraft, economy seats range from {{convert|41.5|to|52.3|cm|in|abbr=on}} in width.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smarttravelasia.com/economy.htm|title=A survey of the best airline economy seats|last=Verghese|first=Vijay|year=2011|publisher=Smarttravelasia.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520010120/http://smarttravelasia.com/economy.htm|archivedate=20 May 2011|url-status=live|accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe A380's upper and lower decks are connected by two stairways, one [[Bow (ship)|fore]] and one [[aft]], with both being wide enough to accommodate two passengers side by side; this cabin arrangement allows multiple seat configurations.

Airbus is reacting to a changing economy; the recession which began in 2008 saw a drop in market percentage of first class and business seats to six percent and an increase in budget economy travellers. Among other causes is the reluctance of employers to pay for executives to travel in First or Business Class. Airbus' chief of cabin marketing, Ingo Wuggestzer, told Aviation Week and Space Technology that the standard three class cabin no longer reflected market conditions. The 11 seat row on the A380 is accompanied by similar options on other widebodies: nine across on the [[Airbus A330]] and ten across on the [[Airbus A350|A350]].<ref>Flottau, Jens, In a squeeze, Aviation Week & Space Technology, 27 April \u2013 10 May 2015, p. 64</ref>\n\n===Integration with infrastructure and regulations===\n\n====Ground operations====\n[[File:Qatar Airways Airbus A380-800 at Heathrow Airport Terminal 4 before Flying to Doha, 6 Jan 2015.jpg|thumb|[[Aircraft ground handling]] with separate [[jetway]]s for the main and upper deck, and [[ground support equipment]]]]\nIn the 1990s, aircraft manufacturers were planning to introduce larger planes than the [[Boeing 747]].

For example, when the 2nd century BC author of the [[Book of Daniel]] wrote that \"many of those sleeping in the dust shall awaken\" ({{Bibleref2-nb|Dan|12:2}}), he probably had in mind a rebirth as angelic beings (metaphorically described as stars in God's Heaven, stars having been identified with angels from early times). Such a rebirth would rule out a bodily resurrection, as angels were believed to be fleshless.{{sfn|Endsj\u00f8|2009|pp=124\u2013125}} Other texts range from the traditional Old Testament view that the soul would spend eternity in the underworld, to a metaphorical belief in the raising of the spirit.{{sfn|Lehtipuu|2015|pp=31\u201332}} Most avoided defining what resurrection might imply, but a resurrection of the flesh was a marginal belief.{{sfn|Endsj\u00f8|2009|p=145}}As Lehtipuu states, \"belief in resurrection was far from being an established doctrine of Second Temple Judaism\".{{sfn|Lehtipuu|2015|pp=32}}\n\n===Greco-Roman===\n{{Main|Apotheosis}}\nThe Greeks held that a meritorious man could be resurrected as a god (the process of ''apotheosis''), and the successors of [[Alexander the Great]] made this idea very well known throughout the Middle East through coins bearing his image, a privilege previously reserved for gods.{{sfn|Cotter|2001|p=131}} The idea was adopted by the Roman emperors, and in the Imperial Roman concept of apotheosis, the earthly body of the recently deceased emperor was replaced by a new and divine one as he ascended into heaven.{{sfn|Cotter|2001|pp=131, 135\u2013136}} The apotheosised dead remained recognisable to those who met them, as when [[Romulus]] appeared to witnesses after his death, but as the biographer [[Plutarch]] (c.

New York: Oxford University Press. 2005</ref>\n\nDuring the first millennium AD, the ransom theory of atonement was the dominant metaphor, both in eastern and western Christianity, until it was replaced in the west by Anselmus' satisfaction theory of atonement.{{sfn|Oxenham|1865|p=114}} The ransom theory of atonement says that Christ liberated humanity from slavery to sin and [[Satan]], and thus death, by giving his own life as a [[ransom]] [[Sacrifice#Christianity|sacrifice]] to Satan, swapping the life of the perfect (Jesus), for the lives of the imperfect (humans). It entails the idea that God deceived the devil,{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=5}} and that Satan, or death, had \"legitimate rights\"{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=5}} over sinful [[soul]]s in the [[afterlife]], due to the fall of man and [[Original sin|inherited sin]].\n\nThe ransom theory was first clearly enunciated by [[Irenaeus]] (c. 130\u2013c. 202),{{sfn|Oxenham|1865|pp=xliv, 114}} who was an outspoken critic of [[Gnosticism]], but borrowed ideas from their dualistic worldview.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=4}} In this worldview, humankind is under the power of the [[Demiurge|Demiurg]], a lesser God who has created the world. Yet, humans have a spark of the true divine nature within them, which can be liberated by [[gnosis]] (knowledge) of this divine spark. This knowledge is revealed by the [[Logos]], \"the very mind of the supreme God,\" who entered the world in the person of Jesus. Nevertheless, the Logos could not simply undo the power of the Demiurg, and had to hide his real identity, appearing as a physical form, thereby misleading the Demiurg, and liberating humankind.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=4}} In Irenaeus' writings, the Demiurge is replaced by the devil, while [[Justin Martyr]] had already equated Jesus and the Logos.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=4}}\n\n[[Origen]] (184\u2013253) introduced the idea that the devil held legitimate rights over humans, who were bought free by the blood of Christ.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|pp=5\u20136}} He also introduced the notion that the devil was deceived in thinking that he could master the human soul.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=6}}\n\n===Late Antiquity and early Middle Ages===\nFollowing the [[Constantine I and Christianity|conversion of Constantine]] and the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313, the [[First seven Ecumenical Councils|ecumenical councils]] of the 4th, 5th and 6th centuries, that focused on [[Christology]], helped shape the Christian understanding of the redemptive nature of resurrection, and influenced both the development of its iconography, and its use within Liturgy.<ref>''The resurrection and the icon'' by Michel Quenot 1998 {{ISBN|0-88141-149-3}} p. 72</ref>\n\nBelief in bodily resurrection was a constant note of the Christian church in antiquity.

The crucial role of the sacraments in the mediation of salvation was well accepted at the time. In Theodore's representation of the [[Eucharist]], the sacrificial and salvific elements are combined in the \"One who saved us and delivered us by the sacrifice of Himself\". Theodore's interpretation of the Eucharistic rite is directed towards the triumph over the power of death brought about by the resurrection.<ref>''Adventus Domini: eschatological thought in 4th-century apses and catecheses'' by Geir Hellemo 1997 {{ISBN|90-04-08836-9}} p. 231</ref>\n\nThe emphasis on the salvific nature of the resurrection continued in Christian theology in the next centuries, e.g., in the 8th century Saint [[John of Damascus]] wrote that: \"...&nbsp;When he had freed those who were bound from the beginning of time, Christ returned again from among the dead, having opened for us the way to resurrection\" and Christian iconography of the ensuing years represented that concept.<ref>Vladimir Lossky, 1982 ''The Meaning of Icons'' {{ISBN|978-0-913836-99-6}} p. 189</ref>\n\n===Present-day===\nLorenzen finds \"a strange silence about the resurrection in many pulpits\".

Depictions prior to the 7th century generally showed secondary events such as the [[Myrrhbearers]] at the tomb of Jesus to convey the concept of the resurrection. An early symbol of the resurrection was the wreathed [[Chi Rho]] (Greek letters representing the word \"Khristos\" or \"Christ\"), whose origin traces to the victory of [[emperor Constantine I]] at the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]] in 312, which he attributed to the use of a cross on the shields of his soldiers.

New York: Oxford University Press. 2005</ref>\n\nDuring the first millennium AD, the ransom theory of atonement was the dominant metaphor, both in eastern and western Christianity, until it was replaced in the west by Anselmus' satisfaction theory of atonement.{{sfn|Oxenham|1865|p=114}} The ransom theory of atonement says that Christ liberated humanity from slavery to sin and [[Satan]], and thus death, by giving his own life as a [[ransom]] [[Sacrifice#Christianity|sacrifice]] to Satan, swapping the life of the perfect (Jesus), for the lives of the imperfect (humans). It entails the idea that God deceived the devil,{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=5}} and that Satan, or death, had \"legitimate rights\"{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=5}} over sinful [[soul]]s in the [[afterlife]], due to the fall of man and [[Original sin|inherited sin]].\n\nThe ransom theory was first clearly enunciated by [[Irenaeus]] (c. 130\u2013c. 202),{{sfn|Oxenham|1865|pp=xliv, 114}} who was an outspoken critic of [[Gnosticism]], but borrowed ideas from their dualistic worldview.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=4}} In this worldview, humankind is under the power of the [[Demiurge|Demiurg]], a lesser God who has created the world. Yet, humans have a spark of the true divine nature within them, which can be liberated by [[gnosis]] (knowledge) of this divine spark. This knowledge is revealed by the [[Logos]], \"the very mind of the supreme God,\" who entered the world in the person of Jesus. Nevertheless, the Logos could not simply undo the power of the Demiurg, and had to hide his real identity, appearing as a physical form, thereby misleading the Demiurg, and liberating humankind.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=4}} In Irenaeus' writings, the Demiurge is replaced by the devil, while [[Justin Martyr]] had already equated Jesus and the Logos.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=4}}\n\n[[Origen]] (184\u2013253) introduced the idea that the devil held legitimate rights over humans, who were bought free by the blood of Christ.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|pp=5\u20136}} He also introduced the notion that the devil was deceived in thinking that he could master the human soul.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=6}}\n\n===Late Antiquity and early Middle Ages===\nFollowing the [[Constantine I and Christianity|conversion of Constantine]] and the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313, the [[First seven Ecumenical Councils|ecumenical councils]] of the 4th, 5th and 6th centuries, that focused on [[Christology]], helped shape the Christian understanding of the redemptive nature of resurrection, and influenced both the development of its iconography, and its use within Liturgy.<ref>''The resurrection and the icon'' by Michel Quenot 1998 {{ISBN|0-88141-149-3}} p. 72</ref>\n\nBelief in bodily resurrection was a constant note of the Christian church in antiquity.

Rotelle 1991 {{ISBN|0-911782-96-6}} p. 157</ref>\n\nThe 5th-century theology of [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]] provides an insight into the development of the Christian understanding of the redemptive nature of resurrection. The crucial role of the sacraments in the mediation of salvation was well accepted at the time. In Theodore's representation of the [[Eucharist]], the sacrificial and salvific elements are combined in the \"One who saved us and delivered us by the sacrifice of Himself\". Theodore's interpretation of the Eucharistic rite is directed towards the triumph over the power of death brought about by the resurrection.<ref>''Adventus Domini: eschatological thought in 4th-century apses and catecheses'' by Geir Hellemo 1997 {{ISBN|90-04-08836-9}} p. 231</ref>\n\nThe emphasis on the salvific nature of the resurrection continued in Christian theology in the next centuries, e.g., in the 8th century Saint [[John of Damascus]] wrote that: \"...&nbsp;When he had freed those who were bound from the beginning of time, Christ returned again from among the dead, having opened for us the way to resurrection\" and Christian iconography of the ensuing years represented that concept.<ref>Vladimir Lossky, 1982 ''The Meaning of Icons'' {{ISBN|978-0-913836-99-6}} p. 189</ref>\n\n===Present-day===\nLorenzen finds \"a strange silence about the resurrection in many pulpits\".

Where \"Paul's seeing was visionary [...], 'from heaven',\" in contrast, the Gospel-accounts have a \"massive realism\" to them.{{sfn|Dunn|1997|p=115}} Dunn contends that the \"massive realism' [...] of the [Gospel] appearances themselves can only be described as visionary with great difficulty \u2013 and Luke would certainly reject the description as inappropriate.\"{{sfn|Dunn|1997|p=115}} According to Dunn, most scholars explain this as a \"legendary materialization\" of the visionary experiences, \"borrowing the traits of the earthly Jesus.\"{{sfn|Dunn|1997|p=116}}{{refn|group=note|According to Sheehan, Paul's account of the resurrection is not meant to be taken as referring to a literal, physical rising from the grave.<ref name=\"Sheehan.2013\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-gospel-according-to-thomas-sheehan/Content?oid=873733|title=The Gospel According to Thomas Sheehan|last=McClory|first=Robert|work=The Chicago Sun-Times|year=1989|accessdate=31 March 2013}}</ref> Paul's understanding of the resurrection, and perhaps Peter's as well, is a metaphorical one, with the stories of Jesus's (figurative) resurrection reflecting his triumphant \"entry into God's eschatological presence.\"{{sfn|Sheehan|1986|p=111}} Sheehan:{{quote|The word \"resurrection\" is a metaphor that unfortunately has been taken literally. That's where the confusion begins. In the New Testament the word for \"resurrection\" means literally \"awakening,\" like waking up your kids in the morning. The New Testament says not that God \"resurrected\" Jesus from the dead, but that he \"awoke\" him. Using metaphoric language, the New Testament says God awoke Jesus from the sleep of death and brought him into God's heavenly presence. There's nothing here about an event in space and time.

According to Vermes, \"[t]he strictly Jewish bond of spirit and body is better served by the idea of the empty tomb and is no doubt responsible for the introduction of the notions of palpability (Thomas in John) and eating (Luke and John).\"{{sfn|Vermes|2008a|p=148}}\n\nAccording to [[Raymond E. Brown]], the body of Jesus was buried in a new tomb by [[Joseph of Arimathea]] in accordance with [[613 Commandments|Mosaic Law]], which stated that a person hanged on a tree must not be allowed to remain there at night, but should be buried before sundown.{{sfn|Brown|1973|p=147}} New Testament historian [[Bart D. Ehrman]] dismisses the story of the empty tomb; according to Ehrman, \"an empty tomb had nothing to do with it [...] an empty tomb would not produce faith.\"{{sfn|Ehrman|2014|p=98}}{{refn|group=note|In an earlier publication (2003), Ehrman recognized that \"Some scholars have argued that it's more plausible that in fact Jesus was placed in a common burial plot, which sometimes happened, or was, as many other crucified people, simply left to be eaten by scavenging animals,\" but further elaborates by stating that \"[T]he accounts are fairly unanimous in saying [...] that Jesus was in fact buried by this fellow, Joseph of Arimathea, and so it's relatively reliable that that's what happened.\"<ref>Bart Ehrman, From Jesus to Constantine: A History of Early Christianity, Lecture 4: \"Oral and Written Traditions about Jesus\" [The Teaching Company, 2003].</ref>}} According to Ehrman, the empty tomb was needed to underscore the physical resurrection of Jesus,{{sfn|Ehrman|2014|p=90}} but is it doubtful that Jesus was buried by Joseph of Arimathea.{{sfn|Ehrman|2014|p=82}} It is unlikely that a member of the Sanhedrin would have buried Jesus;{{sfn|Ehrman|2014|p=82-84}} crucifixion was meant \"to torture and humiliate a person as fully as possible,\" and the body was left on the stake to be eaten by animals;{{sfn|Ehrman|2014|p=85}} criminals were usually buried in common graves;{{sfn|Ehrman|2014|p=86}} and Pilate had no concern for Jewish sensitivities, which makes it unlikely that he would have allowed for Jesus to be buried.{{sfn|Ehrman|2014|p=87}}  The English theologian and historian [[N. T. Wright]], however, emphatically and extensively argues for the reality of the empty tomb and the subsequent appearances of Jesus, reasoning that as a matter of history both a bodily resurrection and later bodily appearances of Jesus are far better explanations for the rise of Christianity than are any other theories, including those of Ehrman.<ref name=\"Wright\">Wright, N.T.

Depictions prior to the 7th century generally showed secondary events such as the [[Myrrhbearers]] at the tomb of Jesus to convey the concept of the resurrection. An early symbol of the resurrection was the wreathed [[Chi Rho]] (Greek letters representing the word \"Khristos\" or \"Christ\"), whose origin traces to the victory of [[emperor Constantine I]] at the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]] in 312, which he attributed to the use of a cross on the shields of his soldiers. Constantine used the Chi Rho on his standard and his coins showed a [[labarum]] with the Chi Rho killing a serpent.<ref>''Understanding early Christian art'' by Robin Margaret Jensen 2000 {{ISBN|0-415-20454-2}} p. 149</ref>\n\nThe use of a wreath around the Chi Rho symbolizes the victory of the resurrection over death, and is an early visual representation of the connection between the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]] and his triumphal resurrection, as seen in the 4th-century sarcophagus of Domitilla<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www1.georgetown.edu/centers/liturgy/envisionchurch/40399.html |title=Cross and Crucifix in the Christian Assembly \u2013 Part I (The Early Christian Period: Crux Invicta, Crux Gemmata) |access-date=24 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624144232/http://www1.georgetown.edu/centers/liturgy/envisionchurch/40399.html |archive-date=24 June 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> in Rome. Here, in the wreathed Chi Rho the death and Resurrection of Christ are shown as inseparable, and the Resurrection is not merely a happy ending tucked at the end of the life of Christ on earth. Given the use of similar symbols on the [[Aquila (Roman)|Roman military banner]], this depiction also conveyed another victory, namely that of the Christian faith: the Roman soldiers who had once arrested Jesus and marched him to [[Calvary]] now walked under the banner of a resurrected Christ.<ref>''The passion in art'' by Richard Harries 2004 {{ISBN|0-7546-5011-1}} p. 8</ref>\n\nThe cosmic significance of the resurrection in Western theology goes back to [[Saint Ambrose]], who in the 4th century said that \"The universe rose again in Him, the heaven rose again in Him, the earth rose again in Him, for there shall be a new heaven and a new earth\".<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf210.iv.iii.iii.html#iv.iii.iii-p220 Ambrose, ''On the Belief in the Resurrection'', 102]</ref><ref name=\"Sherry2005\">''Images of redemption: art, literature and salvation'' by Patrick Sherry 2005 {{ISBN|0-567-08891-X}} p. 73</ref> This theme developed gradually in the West, later than in the East where the resurrection had been linked from an earlier date to redemption and the renewal and rebirth of the whole world. In art this was symbolized by combining the depictions of the resurrection with the [[Harrowing of Hell]] in icons and paintings.
