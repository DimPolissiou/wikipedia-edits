Many follow its routes as a form of spiritual path or retreat for their spiritual growth. It is also popular with hiking and cycling enthusiasts and organized tour groups.\n\nThe French Way (Camino Franc\u00e9s) and the Routes of Northern Spain are the courses listed in the [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage List]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/669 |title=Routes of Santiago de Compostela: ''Camino Franc\u00e9s'' and Routes of Northern Spain |publisher=UNESCO}}</ref><ref name=\"Starkie\">{{Cite book |last=Starkie |first=Walter |url=https://books.google.com/?id=9xJGrnvuNW4C |title=The Roads to Santiago: Pilgrims of St. James |publisher=University of California Press |year=1965 |author-link=Walter Starkie |orig-year=1957}}</ref>\n\n== Major Christian pilgrimage route ==\n[[File:Spain Santiago de Compostela - Cathedral.jpg|thumb| [[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral|The Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]]]]\nThe Way of St. James was one of the most important [[Christian pilgrimage]]s during the later [[Middle Ages]], and a pilgrimage route on which a plenary [[indulgence]] could be earned;<ref>{{CathEncy|title =Indulgences|first= William H.|last= Kent|wstitle=Indulgences}} This entry on indulgences suggests that the evolution of the doctrine came to include pilgrimage to shrines as a trend that developed from the 8th century A.D.: \"Among other forms of commutation were pilgrimages to well-known shrines such as that at [[St. Albans]] in [[England]] or at Compostela in Spain. But the most important place of pilgrimage was Rome. According to [[Bede]] (674\u2013735) the ''visitatio liminum'', or visit to the tomb of the Apostles, was even then regarded as a good work of great efficacy (Hist. Eccl., IV, 23). At first the pilgrims came simply to venerate the relics of the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] and [[Christian martyrs|martyrs]], but in course of time their chief purpose was to gain the indulgences granted by the pope and attached especially to the [[Stations of the Cross|Stations]].\"</ref> other major pilgrimage routes include the [[Via Francigena]] to [[Rome]] and the pilgrimage to [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]].\n\nLegend holds that [[James, son of Zebedee|St. James]]'s remains were carried by boat from Jerusalem to northern Spain, where he was buried in what is now the city of [[Santiago de Compostela]].  (The name ''Santiago'' is the local Galician evolution of [[Vulgar Latin]] ''Sancti Iacobi'', \"Saint James\".)\n\nThe Way can take one of dozens of pilgrimage routes to Santiago de Compostela. Traditionally, as with most pilgrimages, the Way of Saint James began at one's home and ended at the pilgrimage site. However, a few of the routes are considered main ones. During the [[Middle Ages]], the route was highly travelled. However, the [[Black Death]], the [[Protestant Reformation]], and political unrest in 16th century Europe led to its decline. By the 1980s, only a few hundred pilgrims per year registered in the pilgrim's office in Santiago. In October 1987, the route was declared the first [[European Cultural Route]] by the [[Council of Europe]]; it was also named one of [[UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage Site]]s.

Depending on leap years, Holy Years occur in 5-, 6-, and 11-year intervals. The most recent were 1982, 1993, 1999, 2004, and 2010.

Although it is known today that Cape Finisterre, Spain's westernmost point, is not the westernmost point of Europe ([[Cabo da Roca]] in [[Portugal]] is farther west), the fact that the Romans called it ''Finisterrae'' (literally the ''end of the world'' or ''Land's End'' in [[Latin]]) indicates that they viewed it as such.

Over the centuries the scallop shell has taken on a variety of meanings, metaphorical, practical, and mythical, even if its relevance may have actually derived from the desire of pilgrims to take home a souvenir.\n\nTwo versions of the most common myth about the origin of the symbol concern the death of [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]], who was [[martyr]]ed by beheading in [[Jerusalem]] in 44 AD. According to Spanish legends, he had spent time preaching the gospel in Spain, but returned to Judaea upon seeing a vision of the Virgin Mary on the bank of the [[Ebro River]].<ref name=\"chadwick\">{{Citation |last=Chadwick |first=Henry |title=Priscillian of Avila |year=1976 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref><ref name=\"Fletcher\">{{Citation |last=Fletcher |first=Richard A. |title=Saint James's Catapult : The Life and Times of Diego Gelm\u00edrez of Santiago de Compostela |url=http://libro.uca.edu/sjc/sjc.htm |year=1984 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>\n\n:Version 1: After James's death, his disciples shipped his body to the Iberian Peninsula to be buried in what is now Santiago.

The shell is seen on posts and signs along the Camino in order to guide pilgrims along the way. The shell is even more commonly seen on the pilgrims themselves. Wearing a shell denotes that one is a traveler on the Camino de Santiago. Most pilgrims receive a shell at the beginning of their journey and either attach it to them by sewing it onto their clothes or wearing it around their neck or by simply keeping it in, or attached to the outside of, their backpack.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.turismo.navarra.es |title=Camino de Santiago en Navarra |publisher=Government of Navarre |access-date=21 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe scallop shell also served practical purposes for pilgrims on the Camino de Santiago.

It takes us away from luscious foods, it makes gluttonous fatness vanish, it restrains voluptuousness, constrains the appetites of the flesh which attack the fortress of the soul, cleanses the spirit, leads us to contemplation, humbles the haughty, raises up the lowly, loves poverty.  It hates the reproach of those fuelled by greed. It loves, on the other hand, the person who gives to the poor.

The pilgrimage to the shrine became the most renowned medieval pilgrimage, and it became customary for those who returned from Compostela to carry back with them a [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] [[scallop]] shell as proof of their completion of the journey.  This practice gradually led to the scallop shell becoming the badge of a pilgrim.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Waldron |first=Thomas |year=1979 |title=The Sign of the Scallop Shell |journal=The Furrow |volume=30 |issue=10 |pages=646\u2013649 |jstor=27660823}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest recorded pilgrims from beyond the [[Pyrenees]] visited the shrine in the middle of the 11th century, but it seems that it was not until a century later that large numbers of pilgrims from abroad were regularly journeying there. The earliest records of pilgrims that arrived from [[England]] belong to the period between 1092 and 1105. However, by the early 12th century the pilgrimage had become a highly organized affair.\n\nOne of the great proponents of the pilgrimage in the 12th century was [[Pope Callixtus II]], who started the Compostelan Holy Years.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.caminoguides.com/history.html |title=Brief history: The Camino \u2013 past, present & future |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301095104/http://www.caminoguides.com/history.html |archive-date=1 March 2012 |access-date=6 March 2014}}</ref> The official guide in those times was the [[Codex Calixtinus]]. Published around 1140, the 5th book of the Codex is still considered the definitive source for many modern guidebooks. Four pilgrimage routes listed in the Codex originate in France and converge at [[Puente la Reina]]. From there, a well-defined route crosses northern Spain, linking [[Burgos]], [[Carri\u00f3n de los Condes]], [[Sahag\u00fan]], [[Le\u00f3n, Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]], [[Astorga (Spain)|Astorga]], and Compostela.\n\nThe daily needs of pilgrims on their way to and from Compostela were met by a series of [[hospital]]s and contributed to the development of the idea itself, some Spanish towns still bearing the name, as [[Hospital de \u00d3rbigo]].  The hospitals were often staffed by Catholic orders and under royal protection.  Donations were encouraged but many poorer pilgrims had few clothes and poor health often barely getting to the next hospital.\n\n[[Romanesque architecture]], a new genre of ecclesiastical architecture, was designed with massive archways to cope with huge crowds of the devout.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/romanesque |title=Romanesque Architecture - Durham World Heritage Site |website=www.durhamworldheritagesite.com}}</ref> There was also the sale of the now-familiar paraphernalia of [[tourism]], such as badges and souvenirs.  Since the Christian symbol for [[James the Greater]] was the scallop shell, many pilgrims wore one as a sign to anyone on the road that they were a pilgrim. Pilgrims often prayed to [[Saint Roch]] whose numerous depictions with the [[Cross of Saint James|Cross of St James]] can still be seen along the Way even today.\n\n[[File:Jakobsweg - Pilger 1568 - Hurden IMG 5664.JPG|thumb|upright|Way of St. James pilgrims (1568)]]\nThe pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela was possible because of the protection and freedom provided by the [[Kingdom of France]], where the majority of pilgrims originated. Enterprising French (including [[Gascony|Gascons]] and other peoples not under the French crown) settled in towns along the pilgrimage routes, where their names appear in the archives. The pilgrims were tended by people like [[Domingo de la Calzada]], who was later recognized as a saint.\n\nPilgrims walked the Way of St. James, often for months and occasionally years at a time, to arrive at the great church in the main square of Compostela and pay homage to St. James.  Many arrived with very little due to illness or robbery or both.  Traditionally pilgrims lay their hands on the pillar just inside the doorway of the cathedral, and so many now have done this it has visibly worn away the stone.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Davies |first=Bethan |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZSSaHJ8AsqcC&pg=PA179 |title=Walking the Camino de Santiago |last2=Cole |first2=Ben |publisher=Pili Pala Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-9731698-0-X |page=179}}</ref>\n\nThe popular Spanish name for the astronomical [[Milky Way]] is ''El Camino de Santiago''.

Also known as the \"pilgrim's passport\", the ''credencial'' is stamped with the official St. James stamp of each town or ''refugio'' at which the pilgrim has stayed.

Traditionally, as with most pilgrimages, the Way of Saint James began at one's home and ended at the pilgrimage site. However, a few of the routes are considered main ones. During the [[Middle Ages]], the route was highly travelled. However, the [[Black Death]], the [[Protestant Reformation]], and political unrest in 16th century Europe led to its decline. By the 1980s, only a few hundred pilgrims per year registered in the pilgrim's office in Santiago. In October 1987, the route was declared the first [[European Cultural Route]] by the [[Council of Europe]]; it was also named one of [[UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage Site]]s. Since the 1980s the route has attracted a growing number of modern-day international pilgrims.\n\nWhenever St. James's [[Feast Day|Day]] (25 July) falls on a Sunday, the cathedral declares a Holy or [[Jubilee (Christianity)|Jubilee]] Year. Depending on leap years, Holy Years occur in 5-, 6-, and 11-year intervals. The most recent were 1982, 1993, 1999, 2004, and 2010. The next will be 2021, 2027, and 2032.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.csj.org.uk/holy-years.htm |title=Holy Years at Santiago de Compostela |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916050419/http://www.csj.org.uk/holy-years.htm |archive-date=16 September 2014 |access-date=6 March 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Burgos-Metal-Pilgrim-2010.jpg|thumb|Monument of the pilgrims, [[Burgos]]]]\n\n=== Pre-Christian history ===\nThe main pilgrimage route to Santiago follows an earlier Roman trade route, which continues to the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast of Galicia, ending at [[Cape Finisterre]].  Although it is known today that Cape Finisterre, Spain's westernmost point, is not the westernmost point of Europe ([[Cabo da Roca]] in [[Portugal]] is farther west), the fact that the Romans called it ''Finisterrae'' (literally the ''end of the world'' or ''Land's End'' in [[Latin]]) indicates that they viewed it as such.

Over the centuries the scallop shell has taken on a variety of meanings, metaphorical, practical, and mythical, even if its relevance may have actually derived from the desire of pilgrims to take home a souvenir.\n\nTwo versions of the most common myth about the origin of the symbol concern the death of [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]], who was [[martyr]]ed by beheading in [[Jerusalem]] in 44 AD. According to Spanish legends, he had spent time preaching the gospel in Spain, but returned to Judaea upon seeing a vision of the Virgin Mary on the bank of the [[Ebro River]].<ref name=\"chadwick\">{{Citation |last=Chadwick |first=Henry |title=Priscillian of Avila |year=1976 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref><ref name=\"Fletcher\">{{Citation |last=Fletcher |first=Richard A. |title=Saint James's Catapult : The Life and Times of Diego Gelm\u00edrez of Santiago de Compostela |url=http://libro.uca.edu/sjc/sjc.htm |year=1984 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>\n\n:Version 1: After James's death, his disciples shipped his body to the Iberian Peninsula to be buried in what is now Santiago.

The shell is seen on posts and signs along the Camino in order to guide pilgrims along the way. The shell is even more commonly seen on the pilgrims themselves. Wearing a shell denotes that one is a traveler on the Camino de Santiago. Most pilgrims receive a shell at the beginning of their journey and either attach it to them by sewing it onto their clothes or wearing it around their neck or by simply keeping it in, or attached to the outside of, their backpack.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.turismo.navarra.es |title=Camino de Santiago en Navarra |publisher=Government of Navarre |access-date=21 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe scallop shell also served practical purposes for pilgrims on the Camino de Santiago.

It takes us away from luscious foods, it makes gluttonous fatness vanish, it restrains voluptuousness, constrains the appetites of the flesh which attack the fortress of the soul, cleanses the spirit, leads us to contemplation, humbles the haughty, raises up the lowly, loves poverty.  It hates the reproach of those fuelled by greed. It loves, on the other hand, the person who gives to the poor.

The pilgrimage to the shrine became the most renowned medieval pilgrimage, and it became customary for those who returned from Compostela to carry back with them a [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] [[scallop]] shell as proof of their completion of the journey.  This practice gradually led to the scallop shell becoming the badge of a pilgrim.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Waldron |first=Thomas |year=1979 |title=The Sign of the Scallop Shell |journal=The Furrow |volume=30 |issue=10 |pages=646\u2013649 |jstor=27660823}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest recorded pilgrims from beyond the [[Pyrenees]] visited the shrine in the middle of the 11th century, but it seems that it was not until a century later that large numbers of pilgrims from abroad were regularly journeying there. The earliest records of pilgrims that arrived from [[England]] belong to the period between 1092 and 1105. However, by the early 12th century the pilgrimage had become a highly organized affair.\n\nOne of the great proponents of the pilgrimage in the 12th century was [[Pope Callixtus II]], who started the Compostelan Holy Years.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.caminoguides.com/history.html |title=Brief history: The Camino \u2013 past, present & future |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301095104/http://www.caminoguides.com/history.html |archive-date=1 March 2012 |access-date=6 March 2014}}</ref> The official guide in those times was the [[Codex Calixtinus]]. Published around 1140, the 5th book of the Codex is still considered the definitive source for many modern guidebooks. Four pilgrimage routes listed in the Codex originate in France and converge at [[Puente la Reina]]. From there, a well-defined route crosses northern Spain, linking [[Burgos]], [[Carri\u00f3n de los Condes]], [[Sahag\u00fan]], [[Le\u00f3n, Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]], [[Astorga (Spain)|Astorga]], and Compostela.\n\nThe daily needs of pilgrims on their way to and from Compostela were met by a series of [[hospital]]s and contributed to the development of the idea itself, some Spanish towns still bearing the name, as [[Hospital de \u00d3rbigo]].  The hospitals were often staffed by Catholic orders and under royal protection.  Donations were encouraged but many poorer pilgrims had few clothes and poor health often barely getting to the next hospital.\n\n[[Romanesque architecture]], a new genre of ecclesiastical architecture, was designed with massive archways to cope with huge crowds of the devout.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/romanesque |title=Romanesque Architecture - Durham World Heritage Site |website=www.durhamworldheritagesite.com}}</ref> There was also the sale of the now-familiar paraphernalia of [[tourism]], such as badges and souvenirs.  Since the Christian symbol for [[James the Greater]] was the scallop shell, many pilgrims wore one as a sign to anyone on the road that they were a pilgrim. Pilgrims often prayed to [[Saint Roch]] whose numerous depictions with the [[Cross of Saint James|Cross of St James]] can still be seen along the Way even today.\n\n[[File:Jakobsweg - Pilger 1568 - Hurden IMG 5664.JPG|thumb|upright|Way of St. James pilgrims (1568)]]\nThe pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela was possible because of the protection and freedom provided by the [[Kingdom of France]], where the majority of pilgrims originated. Enterprising French (including [[Gascony|Gascons]] and other peoples not under the French crown) settled in towns along the pilgrimage routes, where their names appear in the archives. The pilgrims were tended by people like [[Domingo de la Calzada]], who was later recognized as a saint.\n\nPilgrims walked the Way of St. James, often for months and occasionally years at a time, to arrive at the great church in the main square of Compostela and pay homage to St. James.  Many arrived with very little due to illness or robbery or both.  Traditionally pilgrims lay their hands on the pillar just inside the doorway of the cathedral, and so many now have done this it has visibly worn away the stone.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Davies |first=Bethan |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZSSaHJ8AsqcC&pg=PA179 |title=Walking the Camino de Santiago |last2=Cole |first2=Ben |publisher=Pili Pala Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-9731698-0-X |page=179}}</ref>\n\nThe popular Spanish name for the astronomical [[Milky Way]] is ''El Camino de Santiago''.

Occasionally, these ''refugios'' are located in monasteries, such as the one run by monks in [[Samos, Galicia, Spain|Samos, Spain]], and the one in Santiago de Compostela.\n\nThe final hostel on the route is the famous [[Hostal de los Reyes Cat\u00f3licos]], which lies across the plaza from the [[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral|Cathedral of Santiago de Campostela]].

Also known as the \"pilgrim's passport\", the ''credencial'' is stamped with the official St. James stamp of each town or ''refugio'' at which the pilgrim has stayed. It provides pilgrims with a record of where they ate or slept and serves as proof to the Pilgrim's Office in Santiago that the journey was accomplished according to an official route and thus that the pilgrim qualifies to receive a ''compostela'' (certificate of completion of the pilgrimage).\n\n=== ''Compostela'' ===\nThe ''compostela'' is a certificate of accomplishment given to pilgrims on completing the Way.
