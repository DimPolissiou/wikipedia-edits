He previously worked for ''[[The Independent]]'', [[T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Par Satellite|TPS]]/[[Canal Plus]] and [[Sky Sports]]. He was then a respected football agent, whose clients included [[Robert Pires]] and [[J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Aliadi\u00e8re]]. He also represented [[Eric Cantona]] in the UK. In May 2015, he became executive vice-president of Ligue 1's [[FC Lorient]]. He left the role in September 2017. Since May 2018, he has been the Sporting Director of [[Royale Union Saint-Gilloise]], a Brussels-based football club owned by [[Brighton]] chairman [[Tony Bloom]].\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early career ===\nHayes started his journalistic career in magazines, working for ''[[Tatler]]'' in [[London]] as a features assistant between 1996 and 1998.\n\n=== Newspapers ===\nHe then joined the ''[[Independent on Sunday]]'' as a football writer, where he reported on the [[Premier League]], the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], the England national team and European football. During his six years at the paper, he used his great language skills to secure exclusive interviews with world-famous players and managers such as [[Ronaldinho]], Eric Cantona, [[Thierry Henry]], [[Dennis Bergkamp]], [[Johann Cruyff]], [[Franz Beckenbauer]], [[Serge Blanco]], [[Roger Federer]], [[Pete Sampras]], [[John McEnroe]], [[Didier Drogba]], [[Aime Jacquet]] and [[Zinedine Zidane]].\n\n=== TV ===\nIn 2004, Hayes was recruited by the French TV channel [[TPS Foot]] (which was bought out by [[Canal Plus]] in 2006) to cover the Premier League.

However, in recent years, Charlotte has swung heavily to the Democrats. Republican strength is concentrated in the southeastern portion of the city, while Democratic strength is concentrated in the south-central, eastern, and northern areas.\n\nThe city council comprises 11 members (7 from districts and 4 [[at-large]]). Democrats control the council with a 9-to-2 advantage, winning all 4 of the at-large seats in the November 2013, 2015, and 2017 municipal elections. While the City Council is responsible for passing ordinances, the City's budget, and other policies, all decisions can be overridden by the [[North Carolina General Assembly]], since North Carolina municipalities do not have [[Municipal home rule|home rule]]. While municipal powers have been broadly construed since the 1960s, the General Assembly still retains considerable authority over local matters.\n\nCharlotte is split between two [[congressional district]]s on the federal level. The southeastern portion is part of the [[North Carolina's 9th congressional district|9th District]], represented by Republican Dan Bishop. Most of the city is in the [[North Carolina's 12th congressional district|12th District]], represented by Democrat [[Alma Adams]].\n\nCharlotte was selected in 2011 to host the [[2012 Democratic National Convention]], which was held at the [[Spectrum Center (Charlotte)|Spectrum Center]].

As a result both ships were docked at W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4's Perno shipyard during the winter 1981-1982 and rebuilt with new bows that were notably sleeker along the waterline.<ref name=\"FoF\" /><ref name=\"VL\" /> The ''Silvia Regina'' was docked for bow reconstruction from 13 January onwards. After this was completed, she was again taken to W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4's Turku shipyard where new cabins were built and repairs were carried on in the ship's restaurants.<ref name=\"VL\" /> Following completion of the reconstruction the ship re-entered service in Turku on 3 February, from where she made a crossing to Stockholm, after which she continued on her normal traffic.<ref name=\"VL\" />\n\nIn 1984 the ship's homeport was changed from Helsinki to [[Mariehamn]].<ref name=\"FoF\" /> On 21 March 1985 while outside Helsinki the ship's rear on top of the heavy [[sea ice]] during a turn, as a result of which the ship listed slightly and a truck trailer overturned on a second truck on the cardeck. There were no other casualties and the ship was able to continue sailing normally.<ref name=\"VL\" /> There was a more serious threat to the ship made on 17 August 1986 when a bomb threat was made against the ship in Stockholm. The passengers and crew were evacuated, and to ensure passenger safety they were taken to Turku onboard [[MS Svea|MS ''Svea'']] instead of sailing to Helsinki as planned. Later the ''Silvia Regina'' departed Stockholm without passengers and resumed normal traffic in Helsinki the following day.\n\nIn January 1987 Johnson Line purchased the ''Silvia Regina'' from Suomen Yritysrahoitus with the cost of 189,862,839 [[Finnish markka]],<ref name=\"FoF\" /> and moved her under Swedish flag.<ref name=\"VL\" /> However the following year Johnson Line sold the ship to [[Stena Line]] who chartered her back to Johnson Line until Silja Line's new Helsinki\u2013Stockholm ships (then still in planning stages) were completed. In the end the new ships were severely delayed, and it was not until the end of May 1991 that the ship stopped sailing for Silja Line. For the last months of her service with Silja she received Silja Line's new funnel colours, with the blue seal that had up until that point been painted to the side of the ship next to the name moved to the funnel.<ref name=\"Simplon\">[http://www.simplonpc.co.uk/SilviaRegina1981.html Silvia Regina \u2013 Stena Britannica \u2013 Stena Saga] at [http://www.simplonpc.co.uk/ Simplon Postcards], retrieved 23 August 2007</ref>\n\n=== 1991\u20131994: ''Stena Britannica'' ===\n\nAfter the end of her service with Silja the ''Silvia Regina'' sailed from Stockholm to [[Bremerhaven]], [[Germany]] where she was taken over by Stena Line on 2 June 1991 and subsequently rebuilt for her new service at [[Schichau Seebeckswerft AG]].

Following this she was kept off service for a week.

In 1999, Anderson received the first [[Linda McCartney]] Memorial Award for animal rights protectors, in recognition of her campaign. In 2003, Anderson stripped down for PETA's \"I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur\" advertising campaign. On June 28, 2006, Anderson posed naked with other protesters on a window display of the [[Stella McCartney]] boutique in London, England. It was a PETA gala event before the PETA Humanitarian Awards. Anderson went inside the boutique and said she would take her clothes off if the event raised enough money for PETA, which it did. She campaigned against [[KFC|Kentucky Fried Chicken]]. In 2001, Anderson released a letter in support of PETA's campaign against Kentucky Fried Chicken, stating \"What KFC does to 750 million chickens each year is not civilized or acceptable.\" She later made a video about KFC's treatment of chickens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.KentuckyFriedCruelty.com|title=Kentuckey Fried Cruelty|accessdate=February 26, 2007}}</ref> In January 2006, Anderson requested that the [[Governor of Kentucky]] remove a bust of [[Colonel Sanders]], the founder of KFC, from display but her request was refused even when she offered her own bust in exchange. In February 2006, Anderson decided to [[boycott]] the [[Kentucky Derby]] because of its support for Kentucky Fried Chicken.\n\n[[File:Pamela Anderson FBB Chasse aux phoques 14 f\u00e9vrier 2008 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Anderson is a prominent activist for the animal rights movement.]]\nShe has also campaigned against [[seal hunting]] in Canada. In March 2006, Anderson asked to speak to [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] about the [[Canada's annual seal hunt|annual seal hunt]] but was refused. In May 2006, she petitioned individuals on the street for their opinion on the Canadian Seal Hunt. In December 2009, Anderson, photographed in a T-shirt with a drawn picture of a seal pup on it, was featured in a new ad campaign for PETA. She appears next to the headline \"Save the Seals\" in the ad and urges the public to help end \"Canada's annual seal slaughter.\" She joined forces with the organization again in a campaign for the boycott of fruit-juice maker [[POM Wonderful|POM]]. The \"Pom Horrible Campaign\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://getactive.peta.org/campaign/pam_vs_pom?qp_source=pamvspomgen?c=pvpwiki|title=PETA|accessdate=July 21, 2009}}</ref> has resulted in the company halting [[Animal testing|animal tests]].\n\nAnderson became the center of controversy when she posed in a bikini nearly nude for a PETA ad that was banned in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], on grounds that the ad was sexist. Anderson retorted saying, \"In a city that is known for its exotic dancing and for being progressive and edgy, how sad that a woman would be banned from using her own body in a political protest over the suffering of cows and chickens. In some parts of the world, women are forced to cover their whole bodies with [[burqa]]s \u2013 is that next?

In 1999, Anderson received the first [[Linda McCartney]] Memorial Award for animal rights protectors, in recognition of her campaign. In 2003, Anderson stripped down for PETA's \"I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur\" advertising campaign. On June 28, 2006, Anderson posed naked with other protesters on a window display of the [[Stella McCartney]] boutique in London, England. It was a PETA gala event before the PETA Humanitarian Awards. Anderson went inside the boutique and said she would take her clothes off if the event raised enough money for PETA, which it did. She campaigned against [[KFC|Kentucky Fried Chicken]]. In 2001, Anderson released a letter in support of PETA's campaign against Kentucky Fried Chicken, stating \"What KFC does to 750 million chickens each year is not civilized or acceptable.\" She later made a video about KFC's treatment of chickens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.KentuckyFriedCruelty.com|title=Kentuckey Fried Cruelty|accessdate=February 26, 2007}}</ref> In January 2006, Anderson requested that the [[Governor of Kentucky]] remove a bust of [[Colonel Sanders]], the founder of KFC, from display but her request was refused even when she offered her own bust in exchange. In February 2006, Anderson decided to [[boycott]] the [[Kentucky Derby]] because of its support for Kentucky Fried Chicken.\n\n[[File:Pamela Anderson FBB Chasse aux phoques 14 f\u00e9vrier 2008 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Anderson is a prominent activist for the animal rights movement.]]\nShe has also campaigned against [[seal hunting]] in Canada. In March 2006, Anderson asked to speak to [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] about the [[Canada's annual seal hunt|annual seal hunt]] but was refused. In May 2006, she petitioned individuals on the street for their opinion on the Canadian Seal Hunt. In December 2009, Anderson, photographed in a T-shirt with a drawn picture of a seal pup on it, was featured in a new ad campaign for PETA. She appears next to the headline \"Save the Seals\" in the ad and urges the public to help end \"Canada's annual seal slaughter.\" She joined forces with the organization again in a campaign for the boycott of fruit-juice maker [[POM Wonderful|POM]]. The \"Pom Horrible Campaign\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://getactive.peta.org/campaign/pam_vs_pom?qp_source=pamvspomgen?c=pvpwiki|title=PETA|accessdate=July 21, 2009}}</ref> has resulted in the company halting [[Animal testing|animal tests]].\n\nAnderson became the center of controversy when she posed in a bikini nearly nude for a PETA ad that was banned in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], on grounds that the ad was sexist. Anderson retorted saying, \"In a city that is known for its exotic dancing and for being progressive and edgy, how sad that a woman would be banned from using her own body in a political protest over the suffering of cows and chickens. In some parts of the world, women are forced to cover their whole bodies with [[burqa]]s \u2013 is that next?
