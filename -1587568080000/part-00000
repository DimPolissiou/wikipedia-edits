{"title_page": "Jean Paul Lehners", "text_new": "[[File:Jean-Paul Lehners IEIS Conference Arno J Mayer.jpg|thumb|Jean-Paul Lehners (2013).]] \n'''Jean Paul Lehners''' (born 20 April 1948 in [[Luxembourg|Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]]) is a Luxembourgish [[Historian]] specialized in the field of global and demographic history. He is also involved in the study of human rights. Jean-Paul Lehners is Professor of Global History and Holder of the [http://wwwen.uni.lu/chaire_unesco_en_droits_de_l_homme UNESCO Chair in Human Rights] at the [[University of Luxembourg]].\n\n==Academic life==\nAfter completing the \u201cCours Sup\u00e9rieurs\u201d (higher courses) in Luxembourg in 1967, Jean-Paul Lehners studied in [[Strasbourg]] (France) as well as [[Vienna]] (Austria) between 1968 and 1973. In 1973, Lehners obtained a Doctorate\u2019s degree from the University of Vienna. From 1973 to 1975, Lehners worked as the assistant of Michael Mitterauer at the [[University of Vienna#Faculties and Centres|Institut f\u00fcr Wirtschafts- und Sozialgeschichte der Universit\u00e4t Wien]]. Between 1976 and 1994, Lehners was lecturing at the [[University of Trier]] on themes such as quantitative methods in history, historical demography, history of family structures, analysis of school manuals, fear & security in 16th-20th century, history of European expansions by texts and controversy on numbers in history between 1976 and 1994.<br> \nIn 1975, Jean Paul Lehners completed his internship and became course responsible at [[Lyc\u00e9e Michel Rodange]], where he worked until 1980. Afterwards, he moved to [[:lb:Lyc\u00e9e technique Michel-Lucius|Lyc\u00e9e technique Michel Lucius]] and taught here as a teacher until 1987, then moved back to his former institution, Lyc\u00e9e Michel-Rodange, and where taught until 1995. <br>\nBetween 1984 and 1987, Lehners became the teaching responsible at the [[Centre Universitaire Luxembourg#History|Centre Universitaire]]; then became the course responsible until 1990. Jean Paul Lehners obtained the title of professor in 1990 and taught at the Centre Universitaire and, from 2003 onwards, at the University of Luxembourg. He is currently still teaching at this institution. <br>\nLehners became the vice-rector of the University of Luxembourg between 2003-2007. Since 2011, Jean-Paul Lehners is active as the first Holder of the UNESCO Chair in Human Rights at the University of Luxembourg.\n\n==Social Work==\nWhen Lehners was a student, he was taking part in <span class=\"plainlinks\">[[:lb:ALUC|ALUC (Association Luxembourgeoise des Universitaires Catholiques)]]</span> as his orientation was towards the catholic left wing. However, after a period of time, he quit this association for good as he thought it was just a political ensemble. According to Lehners, it was the first step of joining into the Christian Social Party. While he was studying in Vienna, he took part in a reflection group where he learnt about non-violent action and how to solve conflicts without causing harm from an Indian Jesuite. <br>\nThe social aspect of society has always been highly important for Lehners, that is to say, taking action for the poor and prioritizing the poor. As a result, he joined to the Jugendpoor; an organization of young people who would meet every Thursday to celebrate the mass along with the poor. Consequently, the periodical <span class=\"plainlinks\">[[:lb:Forum (Z\u00e4itschr\u00ebft)|\u201cForum\u201d]]</span> was born along with other organizations like <span class=\"plainlinks\">[[:lb:ASTI|ASTI]]</span>, <span class=\"plainlinks\">[[:lb:Action solidarit\u00e9 tiers monde|ASTM]]</span>, etc. due to the activities of Jugendpoor which was backed by the [[Second Vatican Council]] (also known as Vatican II).<ref>RHEIN, Jean. \u201cJ\u00fcrgen Stoldt: \u00abforum est une plateforme pour le d\u00e9bat soci\u00e9tal\u00bb\u201d.

He is also involved in the study of human rights. Jean-Paul Lehners is Professor of Global History and Holder of the [http://wwwen.uni.lu/chaire_unesco_en_droits_de_l_homme UNESCO Chair in Human Rights] at the [[University of Luxembourg]].\n\n==Academic life==\nAfter completing the \u201cCours Sup\u00e9rieurs\u201d (higher courses) in Luxembourg in 1967, Jean-Paul Lehners studied in [[Strasbourg]] (France) as well as [[Vienna]] (Austria) between 1968 and 1973. In 1973, Lehners obtained a Doctorate\u2019s degree from the University of Vienna. From 1973 to 1975, Lehners worked as the assistant of Michael Mitterauer at the [[University of Vienna#Faculties and Centres|Institut f\u00fcr Wirtschafts- und Sozialgeschichte der Universit\u00e4t Wien]]. Between 1976 and 1994, Lehners was lecturing at the [[University of Trier]] on themes such as quantitative methods in history, historical demography, history of family structures, analysis of school manuals, fear & security in 16th-20th century, history of European expansions by texts and controversy on numbers in history between 1976 and 1994.<br> \nIn 1975, Jean Paul Lehners completed his internship and became course responsible at [[Lyc\u00e9e Michel Rodange]], where he worked until 1980. Afterwards, he moved to [[:lb:Lyc\u00e9e technique Michel-Lucius|Lyc\u00e9e technique Michel Lucius]] and taught here as a teacher until 1987, then moved back to his former institution, Lyc\u00e9e Michel-Rodange, and where taught until 1995. <br>\nBetween 1984 and 1987, Lehners became the teaching responsible at the [[Centre Universitaire Luxembourg#History|Centre Universitaire]]; then became the course responsible until 1990. Jean Paul Lehners obtained the title of professor in 1990 and taught at the Centre Universitaire and, from 2003 onwards, at the University of Luxembourg. He is currently still teaching at this institution. <br>\nLehners became the vice-rector of the University of Luxembourg between 2003-2007. Since 2011, Jean-Paul Lehners is active as the first Holder of the UNESCO Chair in Human Rights at the University of Luxembourg.\n\n==Social Work==\nWhen Lehners was a student, he was taking part in <span class=\"plainlinks\">[[:lb:ALUC|ALUC (Association Luxembourgeoise des Univertitaires Catholiques)]]</span> as his orientation was towards the catholic left wing. However, after a period of time, he quit this association for good as he thought it was just a political ensemble. According to Lehners, it was the first step of joining into the Christian Social Party. While he was studying in Vienna, he took part in a reflection group where he learnt about non-violent action and how to solve conflicts without causing harm from an Indian Jesuite. <br>\nThe social aspect of society has always been highly important for Lehners, that is to say, taking action for the poor and prioritizing the poor. As a result, he joined to the Jugendpoor; an organization of young people who would meet every Thursday to celebrate the mass along with the poor. Consequently, the periodical <span class=\"plainlinks\">[[:lb:Forum (Z\u00e4itschr\u00ebft)|\u201cForum\u201d]]</span> was born along with other organizations like <span class=\"plainlinks\">[[:lb:ASTI|ASTI]]</span>, <span class=\"plainlinks\">[[:lb:Action solidarit\u00e9 tiers monde|ASTM]]</span>, etc. due to the activities of Jugendpoor which was backed by the [[Second Vatican Council]] (also known as Vatican II).<ref>RHEIN, Jean. \u201cJ\u00fcrgen Stoldt: \u00abforum est une plateforme pour le d\u00e9bat soci\u00e9tal\u00bb\u201d.
