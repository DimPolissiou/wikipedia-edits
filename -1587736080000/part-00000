{"title_page": "1927 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Short description|Rugby league season}}\nThe 1927 [[Auckland Rugby League]] season was its 18th.\n\n[[Newton Rangers|Newton]] defeated [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] by 6 points to 3 in the championship final to win the Monteith Shield after both teams finished the season tied with identical 8 win, 1 draw, 3 loss records. This was the second time Newton had won the championship in 18 efforts, with the first being in [[1912 Auckland Rugby League season|1912and]] was to be their last after they merged decades later with [[City Rovers]] and the combined team ceased in the early 2000s. [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] won the Roope Rooster knockout trophy for the second consecutive season. [[Newton Rangers]] defeated [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] to win the Stormont Shield.\n\n[[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] won the Norton Cup by winning the second division competition, known as the B Grade at this time. They were undefeated and also won the Stallard Cup which was the B Grade knockout trophy. Interestingly the league played a 'promotion-relegation' match, with [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] by virtue of winning the Norton Cup for winning the B Grade playing off with [[Grafton Athletic|Grafton]], who had finished last in the A Grade. [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] won 11\u20133 over Grafton thus winning the right to compete in the A grade competition in the 1928 season. Despite this there was still considerable discussion at the annual general meeting the following year as to whether or not [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] be admitted to the A Grade. It was eventually decided that they would be, with [[Grafton Athletic|Grafton]] dropping to the B Grade.\n\nOther trophies awarded (at the 1928 annual general meeting of the [[Auckland Rugby League]]) were the Davis Points Shield to [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]], the Thistle Cup to [[Newton Rangers|Newton]], and a special cup for the best forward to W.Clark from [[Newton Rangers|Newton]].\n\n{{s-start}}\n    {{s-bef|before=[[1926 Auckland Rugby League season|1926]]}}\n    {{s-ttl|title=18th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n    |years=1927}}\n    {{s-aft|after=[[1928 Auckland Rugby League season|1928]]}}\n    {{end}}\n\n=== Annual Meetings of Auckland Rugby League ===\nThe annual report for the 1927 season stated that the total revenue for [[Auckland Rugby League]] was \u00a35,597, with \u00a34,216 taken at the gates.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Review of Past Season/Total Revenue of \u00a35597\n| page = 13\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXIV| issue=19580\n| date = 1927-03-08\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19270308.2.149.3\n| accessdate = 2019-09-23}}</ref> At the annual meeting of the Junior Management Committee of the [[Auckland Rugby League]] on 23 March it was stated in their report that junior players exceeded 1,500. It was also reported that the Remuera League Club was being revived.

It was notable for the fact that 4 players were ordered off. St George who had had words with the referee was sent from the field, two minutes later Stewart from [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] joined him and Prentice (Richmond), and O'Brien (Devonport) soon followed.\n\nIn Round 9 the match between [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] and [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] at the [[Auckland Domain]] was postponed due to the ground being unfit for play. In the same round the [[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] captain O'Brien was ordered off in their 16\u20136 loss to [[Marist Saints|Marist]]. At the conclusion of the match the referee was escorted from the field by two police officers as several hecklers crowded and heckled him. The following weekend saw all games suspended and the postponed match played at [[Carlaw Park]], with [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] defeating [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] by 14 points to 3. Ironically rain fell throughout the match and the field \"was badly churned up as the game progressed\".<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Newton Creates Surprise/Ponsonby Team Defeated/Fine Work by Forwards\n| page = 13\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXIV| issue=19685\n| date = 1927-07-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19270711.2.145.13\n| accessdate = 2019-09-25}}</ref>\n\nIn Round 10 the match between [[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] and Grafton was cancelled due to the unfit nature of the field at the Auckland Domain. It was played on the following weekend at [[Devonport, New Zealand|Devonport]] with other fixtures from that round not played due to the [[Auckland Rugby League]] making [[Carlaw Park]] available for the soccer match between [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]] and [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]].\n\nAfter two completed rounds [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] and [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] were both tied on 19 competition points. This necessitated a final between the two sides and this was won by [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] by 6 points to 3. The Roope Rooster finalists were [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] and [[North Shore Albions|Devonport]]. [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] won the final 7 points to 6 to retain the title. In the Stormont Shield match played between the winners of the two major titles ([[Newton Rangers|Newton]] and [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]]), [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] won by 25 points to 14.\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | 1927 First Grade Results\n|-\n|\n!

This was the second time Newton had won the championship in 18 efforts, with the first being in [[1912 Auckland Rugby League season|1912and]] was to be their last after they merged decades later with [[City Rovers]] and the combined team ceased in the early 2000s. [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] won the Roope Rooster knockout trophy for the second consecutive season. [[Newton Rangers]] defeated [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] to win the Stormont Shield.\n\n[[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] won the Norton Cup by winning the second division competition, known as the B Grade at this time. They were undefeated and also won the Stallard Cup which was the B Grade knockout trophy. Interestingly the league played a 'promotion-relegation' match, with [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] by virtue of winning the Norton Cup for winning the B Grade playing off with [[Grafton Athletic|Grafton]], who had finished last in the A Grade. [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] won 11\u20133 over Grafton thus winning the right to compete in the A grade competition in the 1928 season. Despite this there was still considerable discussion at the annual general meeting the following year as to whether or not [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] be admitted to the A Grade. It was eventually decided that they would be, with [[Grafton Athletic|Grafton]] dropping to the B Grade.\n\nOther trophies awarded (at the 1928 annual general meeting of the [[Auckland Rugby League]]) were the Davis Points Shield to [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]], the Thistle Cup to [[Newton Rangers|Newton]], and a special cup for the best forward to W.Clark from [[Newton Rangers|Newton]].\n\n{{s-start}}\n    {{s-bef|before=[[1926 Auckland Rugby League season|1926]]}}\n    {{s-ttl|title=18th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n    |years=1927}}\n    {{s-aft|after=[[1928 Auckland Rugby League season|1928]]}}\n    {{end}}\n\n=== Annual Meetings of Auckland Rugby League ===\nThe annual report for the 1927 season stated that the total revenue for [[Auckland Rugby League]] was \u00a35,597, with \u00a34,216 taken at the gates.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Review of Past Season/Total Revenue of \u00a35597\n| page = 13\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXIV| issue=19580\n| date = 1927-03-08\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19270308.2.149.3\n| accessdate = 2019-09-23}}</ref> At the annual meeting of the Junior Management Committee of the [[Auckland Rugby League]] on 23 March it was stated in their report that junior players exceeded 1,500.

It was played on the following weekend at [[Devonport, New Zealand|Devonport]] with other fixtures from that round not played due to the [[Auckland Rugby League]] making [[Carlaw Park]] available for the soccer match between [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]] and [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]].\n\nAfter two completed rounds [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] and [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] were both tied on 19 competition points. This necessitated a final between the two sides and this was won by [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] by 6 points to 3. The Roope Rooster finalists were [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] and [[North Shore Albions|Devonport]]. [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] won the final 7 points to 6 to retain the title.

It is a sequel to 2011's ''[[Battlefield 3]]'' and was released in October 2013 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Xbox 360]]; then later in November for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]].\n\n''Battlefield 4'' was met with positive reception. It was praised for its multiplayer mode, gameplay and graphics, but was also criticized for its short and shallow [[Single-player video game|single-player]] campaign mode, and for its numerous [[Software bug|bugs]] and [[glitch]]es. It was a commercial success, selling over 7 million copies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bfcentral.net/bf4/2014/05/battlefield-4-sells-7-million-2-still-playing/|title=Battlefield 4 sells 7+ million, only 2% are still playing|access-date=2017-03-30|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331205158/http://www.bfcentral.net/bf4/2014/05/battlefield-4-sells-7-million-2-still-playing/|archive-date=March 31, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe game's [[HUD (video gaming)|heads-up display]] (HUD) is composed of two compact rectangles. The lower left-hand corner features a mini-map and compass for navigation, and a simplified objective notice above it; the lower right includes a compact ammo counter and health meter. The top right displays kill notifications of all players in-game. On the Windows version of the game, the top left features a chat window when in multiplayer. The mini-map, as well as the main game screen, shows symbols denoting three kinds of entities: blue for allies, green for squadmates, and orange for enemies, this applies to all interactivity on the battlefield. Battlefield 4 options also allow colour-blind players to change the on-screen colour indicators to: tritanomaly, deuteranomaly and protanomaly.\n\nWeapon customisation is expansive and encouraged. Primary, secondary and melee weapons can all be customised with weapon attachments and camouflage 'skins'. Most weapons also have a default setting for different firing modes (e.g. semi-automatic, automatic fire), allowing the player to adapt to the environment they find themselves in. They can \"spot\" targets (marking their positions to the player's team) in the single-player campaign (a first in the Battlefield franchise) as well as in multiplayer. The game's bullet-dropping-system has been significantly enhanced, forcing the player to change the way they play medium to long distance combat. In addition, players have more combat capabilities, such as countering melee attacks from the front while standing or crouching, shooting with their sidearm while swimming, and diving underwater to avoid enemy detection. Standard combat abilities are still current including, reloading whilst sprinting, unlimited sprint, prone and vaulting.\n\n===Campaign===\nThe single-player campaign has several differences from the main multiplayer component. For the most part, the player must traverse mini-sandbox-style levels, in some cases using vehicles, like tanks and boats, to traverse the environment. As the player character, [[#Setting and characters|Recker]], the player can use two campaign-only functions: the Engage command and the tactical binocular. The Engage command directs Recker's squadmates, and occasionally other friendly units, to attack any hostiles in Recker's line of sight. The tactical binocular is similar to a laser-designator, in the sense that it allows the player to identify friendly and enemy units, weapon stashes, explosives, and objectives in the field. By identifying enemies, the player can make them visible without using the visor, making them easier to mark for their teammates. At one point, Recker will briefly lose the tactical visor, forcing them to only use the Engage command to direct his squadmates on a limited number of enemies.<ref name=trailer_gameplay_rev /><ref name=gi_18things />\n\nThe campaign features assignments that require specific actions and unlock weapons for use in multiplayer upon completion. Collectible weapons return along with the introduction of collectible [[dog tag]]s which can be used in multiplayer. Weapon crates are found throughout all levels, allowing players to obtain ammo and switch weapons. While crates hold default weapons, collectible weapons may be used whenever they are acquired and level-specific weapons may be used once a specific mission assignment has been completed by obtaining enough points in a level.<ref name=trailer_gameplay_rev /><ref name=gi_18things />\n\n===Multiplayer===\n[[File:Battlefield 4 - MP - Commander Mode.jpg|300px|thumb|left|The new Commander Mode interface in ''Battlefield 4'', showing an overhead view of the map \"Siege of Shanghai\"]]\n''Battlefield 4''{{'}}s multiplayer contains three playable factions\u2014the United States, China, and Russia\u2014fighting against each other, in up to 64-player matches on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One (24-Player on Xbox 360 and PS3). A newly reintroduced \"Commander Mode\", last seen in ''[[Battlefield 2142]]'', gives one player on each team a [[real-time strategy]]-like view of the entire map and the ability to give orders to teammates. Also, the Commander can observe the battle through the eyes of the players on the battlefield, deploying vehicle and weapon drops to \"keep the war machinery going\", and order in missile strikes on hostile targets.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-15-battlefield-4-promo-material-reveals-return-of-commander-mode-three-playable-factions |title= Battlefield 4 promo material reveals return of Commander Mode, three playable factions |date= April 15, 2013 |accessdate= May 7, 2013 |first= Wesley |last= Yin-Poole |publisher= Euro Gamer |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160303195650/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-15-battlefield-4-promo-material-reveals-return-of-commander-mode-three-playable-factions |archive-date= March 3, 2016 |url-status= live |df= mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |work=[[YouTube]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgZTeVnM5Sw |title=Battlefield 4: Official Commander Mode Trailer |publisher=[[Electronic Arts]] |date=June 10, 2013 |accessdate=June 17, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611235513/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgZTeVnM5Sw |archive-date=June 11, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> A spectator mode is included, enabling players to spectate others in first or third person, as well as use a free camera to pan around the map from any angle.\n\nOn June 10, 2013, at E3, DICE featured the map \"Siege of Shanghai\", pitting the [[People's Liberation Army]] against the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]]. The gameplay showcased Commander Mode; new weapons and vehicles; and the \"Levolution\" gameplay mechanic. The video displays the last of these at various points, including: a player destroying a support pillar to trap an enemy tank above it; and a large skyscraper (with an in-game objective on the top floor) collapsing in the center of the map, kicking up a massive dust cloud throughout the map and bringing the objective closer to ground level.<ref name=bf4_levolution_trailer>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3W4FbsAqIY|title=Battlefield 4: Official Levolution Features Video|publisher=DICE|work=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=August 22, 2013|quote='''Aleksander Gr\u00f8ndal''': Levolution is the next step in player choice, in how you affect the world, and the world affects you back.

The Assault kit must now wait for the defibrillator to recharge after reviving teammates in quick succession. The Engineer kit uses [[Personal defense weapon|PDWs]], and carbines are available to all kits. The support kit has access to the new remote mortar and the [[XM25 CDTE|XM25]] allowing for indirect suppressive fire. The Recon kit is now more mobile and is able to equip carbines, [[designated marksman rifle]]s (DMRs), and C4. Sniping mechanics also give with the ability to zero in your sights (set an aiming distance), and equip more optics and accessories than previous Battlefield games. The Recon kit is still able to utilize the MAV, T-UGS, and the Radio Beacon.<ref name=\"GameSpot-YouTube\" /><ref name=\"EA-YouTube\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7l-eUmhEW8 |title=Battlefield 4 Multiplayer Demo - Siege of Shanghai E3 2013 |publisher=YouTube |date=June 10, 2013 |accessdate=August 22, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921061912/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7l-eUmhEW8 |archive-date=September 21, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.battlefield.com/2013/08/road-to-bf4-field-upgrades/|title=The Road to Battlefield 4: Tweaked to the Core|access-date=September 16, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053817/http://blogs.battlefield.com/2013/08/road-to-bf4-field-upgrades/|archive-date=September 21, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nNew vehicles have also been introduced. With the addition of the Chinese faction, new vehicles include the [[Type 99 tank|Type 99 MBT]], the [[ZFB-05]] armored car, and the [[CAIC Z-10|Z-10W attack helicopter]]. Jets have also been rebalanced and put into two classes, \"attack\" and \"stealth\". The attack jets focus is mainly air-to-ground capabilities, while stealth jets focus mainly on air-to-air combat. Another vehicle added in ''Battlefield 4'' is the addition of the [[CB90|RCB]] and DV-15 Interceptor attack boats, which function as heavily armed aquatic assault craft.\n\nCustomization options have also been increased in ''Battlefield 4'', with all new camos available for every gun. A new \"adaptive\" camo has been introduced that can adapt the camo to the map being played without the player having to change camos every map. Camos can now be applied to jets, helicopters, tanks, transport vehicles and guns. Previously this option was introduced to parachutes but has been removed, emblems are now printed onto parachutes.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Setting and characters===\n''Battlefield 4''{{'}}s single-player Campaign takes place during the fictional \"War of 2020\", six years after the events of its [[Battlefield 3#Plot|predecessor]].

After being trapped underwater while being pursued by Russian special forces, Dunn, critically wounded and trapped, sacrifices himself by ordering the squad to break the windscreen and escape. Reuniting with their commanding officer Captain Garrison, Tombstone learns that Admiral Chang,  head of the Chinese army, has taken control of China with Russian support, and eliminated Chinese presidential candidate Jin Ji\u00e9, a progressive politician seeking reforms within the Chinese government. The group finds themselves sent to Shanghai with orders to rescue two VIPs - a woman named Hannah, and her husband - with assistance from an intelligence agent named Kovic.\n\nAlthough the rescue is a success and Kovic takes the VIPs back to the USS ''Valkyrie'', a [[Wasp-class amphibious assault ship]], Tombstone becomes trapped in the city and forced to rescue civilians against Pac's protests. Shortly after returning to the ''Valkyrie'', Garrison assigns Kovic as head of the squad, and sends them to the USS ''Titan'', a [[Nimitz-class aircraft carrier]] that had just been attacked, to recover its [[voyage data recorder]] before the wreckage sinks. Upon returning to the ''Valkyrie'', Tombstone finds the ship under assault by [[People's Liberation Army Navy-Marine Corps|Chinese Marines]]. While the squad rescue Garrison, and the VIPs, Kovic is fatally wounded and passes control of the squad to Recker. Learning that China's air force is grounded due to a storm, Garrison assigns Tombstone to lend assistance to US forces planning to assault the Chinese-controlled [[Singapore]] airfield so that Chinese air superiority is weakened. Hannah volunteers to join Tombstone on their mission, much to Irish's chagrin.\n\nDespite the airfield being destroyed by a missile strike, Pac is separated from Tombstone during evacuation and assumed killed in the blast. Hannah then betrays Recker and Irish, allowing both to be captured by Chinese soldiers. Both men find themselves taken to a prison in the [[Kunlun Mountains]] for interrogation under Chang's orders. In his cell, Recker finds himself befriended by a Russian prisoner named [[Battlefield 3|\"Dima\"]] - a survivor of the Paris nuclear blast, now suffering from [[radiation poisoning]]. The pair escape from their cell, start a mass prison riot, and use the chaos to make their escape, with Recker rescuing Irish along the way. As Chinese military arrive to quell the riot, Hannah prevents the group from being recaptured by a group of soldiers. Although Irish mistrusts her, Hannah reveals her action was necessary for her mission, revealing her husband is, in reality, Jin Ji\u00e9, who survived Chang's assassination attempt.\n\nThe group makes use of a tram to get out of the mountains, only for it to be shot down by an enemy helicopter, killing Dima in the crash. Forced to make their way down on foot, hunting for food to survive, the group eventually find a jeep and drive towards the US-occupied city of Tashgar. During the journey, Hannah reveals how she lost her family to Chang's men after bringing Jin Ji\u00e9 to meet them, causing Irish to make amends with her for his behavior. Upon reaching Tashgar, the squad find US troops being besieged by both Chinese and Russian forces, and offer assistance to the US commander by destroying a nearby dam, flooding the area and eliminating the opposing forces. Learning the ''Valkyrie'' is within the region of the [[Suez Canal]], Tombstone is airlifted to the ship, and arrives to warn the vessel that they are blindly heading towards Chang's navy. Assisting in stopping Chinese forces from boarding the ship, the squad soon find Jin Ji\u00e9 amongst other survivors, including Pac (who had survived Singapore).\n\nKnowing he must show his face, as Chinese forces had been fighting under the assumption he was dead, Jin Ji\u00e9 convinces Recker to let him show his face and calm tensions between the three forces. The assault quickly ends with Chinese forces beginning to spread the news of Jin Ji\u00e9's return. Chang, desiring to prevent this and conceal the truth, proceeds to barrage the ''Valkyrie'' with his personal warship. Recker, Irish, and Hannah volunteer to board the warship and use explosives to destroy it. However, when the remote detonation fails, Hannah and Irish each volunteer to manually replacing the charges. If the player chooses not to do anything, Chang obliterates the ''Valkyrie'', thus killing Pac, Garrison and Jin Ji\u00e9; if they send one of the two, the volunteer goes back to set the explosives, and is killed in the blast along with Chang, while the survivor and Recker are recovered by the ''Valkyrie''. During the credits, the player hears a new dialogue between Irish and Hannah, discussing their pasts, and how they have to keep moving forward with no regrets.\n\n==Development==\nElectronic Arts president Frank Gibeau confirmed the company's intention to release a sequel to ''Battlefield 3'' during a keynote at the [[University of Southern California]] where he said \"There is going to be a ''Battlefield 4''\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2011/11/09/report-ea-president-mentions-battlefield-4-during-college-keynote/|title=EA president mentions Battlefield 4 during college keynote|date=November 10, 2011|accessdate=April 7, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103224032/http://www.vg247.com/2011/11/09/report-ea-president-mentions-battlefield-4-during-college-keynote/|archive-date=November 3, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Afterwards, an EA spokesperson told IGN: \"Frank was speaking broadly about the ''Battlefield'' brand&mdash;a brand that EA is deeply passionate about and a fan community that EA is committed to.\" On the eve of ''Battlefield 3''{{'}}s launch, EA Digital Illusions CE told Eurogamer it was the Swedish studio's hope that it would one day get the opportunity to make ''Battlefield 4''. \"This feels like day one now,\" executive producer Patrick Bach said. \"It's exciting.

Some things are massive like reducing a skyscraper to rubble or flooding an entire level in real-time. Others are small but hugely impact the game like shooting fire extinguishers to distract enemies or cutting the power of a building to blind opponents.<br />If you haven\u2019t seen the Paracel Storm map we unveiled at Gamescom we encourage you to do so. There you can see how players have the option of taking down a turbine weakened by lightning in order to free the damaged destroyer stuck on it. If you manage to set the destroyer adrift, it will crash onto the island, changing the layout of the map and allowing your team to take control of the anti-air weaponry on the ship.<br />These moments are all triggered by the players \u2013 they aren\u2019t just timed moments that will happen no matter what you do in the match. You and your teammates will have to decide if it would be a better tactical decision to radically change the map, or if it would be wiser and better for your play-style if you stopped the other team

It is a sequel to 2011's ''[[Battlefield 3]]'' and was released in October 2013 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Xbox 360]]; then later in November for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]].\n\n''Battlefield 4'' was met with positive reception. It was praised for its multiplayer mode, gameplay and graphics, but was also criticized for its short and shallow [[Single-player video game|single-player]] campaign mode, and for its numerous [[Software bug|bugs]] and [[glitch]]es. It was a commercial success, selling over 7 million copies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bfcentral.net/bf4/2014/05/battlefield-4-sells-7-million-2-still-playing/|title=Battlefield 4 sells 7+ million, only 2% are still playing|access-date=2017-03-30|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331205158/http://www.bfcentral.net/bf4/2014/05/battlefield-4-sells-7-million-2-still-playing/|archive-date=March 31, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe game's [[HUD (video gaming)|heads-up display]] (HUD) is composed of two compact rectangles. The lower left-hand corner features a mini-map and compass for navigation, and a simplified objective notice above it; the lower right includes a compact ammo counter and health meter. The top right displays kill notifications of all players in-game. On the Windows version of the game, the top left features a chat window when in multiplayer. The mini-map, as well as the main game screen, shows symbols denoting three kinds of entities: blue for allies, green for squadmates, and orange for enemies, this applies to all interactivity on the battlefield. Battlefield 4 options also allow colour-blind players to change the on-screen colour indicators to: tritanomaly, deuteranomaly and protanomaly.\n\nWeapon customisation is expansive and encouraged. Primary, secondary and melee weapons can all be customised with weapon attachments and camouflage 'skins'. Most weapons also have a default setting for different firing modes (e.g. semi-automatic, automatic fire), allowing the player to adapt to the environment they find themselves in. They can \"spot\" targets (marking their positions to the player's team) in the single-player campaign (a first in the Battlefield franchise) as well as in multiplayer. The game's bullet-dropping-system has been significantly enhanced, forcing the player to change the way they play medium to long distance combat. In addition, players have more combat capabilities, such as countering melee attacks from the front while standing or crouching, shooting with their sidearm while swimming, and diving underwater to avoid enemy detection. Standard combat abilities are still current including, reloading whilst sprinting, unlimited sprint, prone and vaulting.\n\n===Campaign===\nThe single-player campaign has several differences from the main multiplayer component. For the most part, the player must traverse mini-sandbox-style levels, in some cases using vehicles, like tanks and boats, to traverse the environment. As the player character, [[#Setting and characters|Recker]], the player can use two campaign-only functions: the Engage command and the tactical binocular. The Engage command directs Recker's squadmates, and occasionally other friendly units, to attack any hostiles in Recker's line of sight. The tactical binocular is similar to a laser-designator, in the sense that it allows the player to identify friendly and enemy units, weapon stashes, explosives, and objectives in the field. By identifying enemies, the player can make them visible without using the visor, making them easier to mark for their teammates. At one point, Recker will briefly lose the tactical visor, forcing them to only use the Engage command to direct his squadmates on a limited number of enemies.<ref name=trailer_gameplay_rev /><ref name=gi_18things />\n\nThe campaign features assignments that require specific actions and unlock weapons for use in multiplayer upon completion. Collectible weapons return along with the introduction of collectible [[dog tag]]s which can be used in multiplayer. Weapon crates are found throughout all levels, allowing players to obtain ammo and switch weapons. While crates hold default weapons, collectible weapons may be used whenever they are acquired and level-specific weapons may be used once a specific mission assignment has been completed by obtaining enough points in a level.<ref name=trailer_gameplay_rev /><ref name=gi_18things />\n\n===Multiplayer===\n[[File:Battlefield 4 - MP - Commander Mode.jpg|300px|thumb|left|The new Commander Mode interface in ''Battlefield 4'', showing an overhead view of the map \"Siege of Shanghai\"]]\n''Battlefield 4''{{'}}s multiplayer contains three playable factions\u2014the United States, China, and Russia\u2014fighting against each other, in up to 64-player matches on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One (24-Player on Xbox 360 and PS3). A newly reintroduced \"Commander Mode\", last seen in ''[[Battlefield 2142]]'', gives one player on each team a [[real-time strategy]]-like view of the entire map and the ability to give orders to teammates.

After being trapped underwater while being pursued by Russian special forces, Dunn, critically wounded and trapped, sacrifices himself by ordering the squad to break the windscreen and escape. Reuniting with their commanding officer Captain Garrison, Tombstone learns that Admiral Chang,  head of the Chinese army, has taken control of China with Russian support, and eliminated Chinese presidential candidate Jin Ji\u00e9, a progressive politician seeking reforms within the Chinese government. The group find themselves sent to Shanghai with orders to rescue two VIPs - a woman named Hannah, and her husband - with assistance from an intelligence agent named Kovic.\n\nAlthough the rescue is a success and Kovic takes the VIPs back to the USS ''Valkyrie'', a [[Wasp-class amphibious assault ship]], Tombstone become trapped in the city, and forced to rescue civilians against Pac's protests. Shortly after returning to the ''Valkyrie'', Garrision assigns Kovic as head of the squad, and sends them to the USS ''Titan'', a [[Nimitz-class aircraft carrier]] that had just been attacked, to recover its [[voyage data recorder]] before the wreckage sinks. Upon returning to the ''Valkyrie'', Tombstone find the ship under assault by [[People's Liberation Army Navy Marine Corps|Chinese Marines]]. While the squad rescue Garrison, and the VIPs, Kovic is fatally wounded and passes control of the squad to Recker. Learning that China's air force is grounded due to a storm, Garrison assigns Tombstone to lend assistance to US forces planning to assault the Chinese-controlled [[Singapore]] airfield so that Chinese air superiority is weakened. Hannah volunteers to join Tombstone on their mission, much to Irish's chagrin.\n\nDespite the airfield being destroyed by a missile strike, Pac is separated from Tombstone during evacuation and assumed killed in the blast. Hannah then betrays Recker and Irish, allowing both to be captured by Chinese soldiers. Both men find themselves taken to a prison in the [[Kunlun Mountains]] for interrogation under Chang's orders. In his cell, Recker finds himself befriended by a Russian prisoner named [[Battlefield 3|\"Dima\"]] - a survivor of the Paris nuclear blast, now suffering from [[radiation poisoning]]. The pair escape from their cell, start a mass prison riot, and use the chaos to make their escape, with Recker rescuing Irish along the way. As Chinese military arrive to quell the riot, Hannah prevents the group from being recaptured by a group of soldiers. Although Irish mistrusts her, Hannah reveals her action was necessary for her mission, revealing her husband is in reality Jin Ji\u00e9, who survived Chang's assassination attempt.\n\nThe group makes use of a tram to get out of the mountains, only for it to be shot down by an enemy helicopter, killing Dima in the crash. Forced to make their way down on foot, hunting for food to survive, the group eventually find a jeep and drive towards the US-occupied city of Tashgar. During the journey, Hannah reveals how she lost her family to Chang's men after bringing Jin Ji\u00e9 to meet them, causing Irish to make amends with her for his behavior. Upon reaching Tashgar, the squad find US troops being besieged by both Chinese and Russian forces, and offer assistance to the US commander by destroying a nearby dam, flooding the area and eliminating the opposing forces. Learning the ''Valkyrie'' is within the region of the [[Suez Canal]], Tombstone are airlifted to the ship, and arrive to warn the vessel that they are blindly heading towards Chang's navy. Assisting in stopping Chinese forces from boarding the ship, the squad soon find Jin Ji\u00e9 amongst other survivors, including Pac (who had survived Singapore).\n\nKnowing he must show his face, as Chinese forces had been fighting under the assumption he was dead, Jin Ji\u00e9 convinces Recker to let him show his face and calm tensions between the three forces. The assault quickly ends with Chinese forces beginning to spread the news of Jin Ji\u00e9's return. Chang, desiring to prevent this and conceal the truth, proceeds to barrage the ''Valkyrie'' with his personal warship. Recker, Irish and Hannah volunteer to board the warship and use explosives to destroy it. However, when the remote detonation fails, Hannah and Irish each volunteer to manually replacing the charges. If the player chooses not to do anything, Chang obliterates the ''Valkyrie'', thus killing Pac, Garrison and Jin Ji\u00e9; if they send one of the two, the volunteer goes back to set the explosives, and is killed in the blast along with Chang, while the survivor and Recker are recovered by the ''Valkyrie''. During the credits, the player hears a new dialogue between Irish and Hannah, discussing their pasts, and how they have to keep moving forward with no regrets.\n\n==Development==\nElectronic Arts president Frank Gibeau confirmed the company's intention to release a sequel to ''Battlefield 3'' during a keynote at the [[University of Southern California]] where he said \"There is going to be a ''Battlefield 4''\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2011/11/09/report-ea-president-mentions-battlefield-4-during-college-keynote/|title=EA president mentions Battlefield 4 during college keynote|date=November 10, 2011|accessdate=April 7, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103224032/http://www.vg247.com/2011/11/09/report-ea-president-mentions-battlefield-4-during-college-keynote/|archive-date=November 3, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Afterwards, an EA spokesperson told IGN: \"Frank was speaking broadly about the ''Battlefield'' brand&mdash;a brand that EA is deeply passionate about and a fan community that EA is committed to.\" On the eve of ''Battlefield 3''{{'}}s launch, EA Digital Illusions CE told Eurogamer it was the Swedish studio's hope that it would one day get the opportunity to make ''Battlefield 4''. \"This feels like day one now,\" executive producer Patrick Bach said. \"It's exciting.

Will there be the same Levolution (falling building) or different Levolution in other maps?\"'''<br />Yes, Levolution occurs on every map. Some things are massive like reducing a skyscraper to rubble or flooding an entire level in real-time. Others are small but hugely impact the game like shooting fire extinguishers to distract enemies or cutting the power of a building to blind opponents.<br />If you haven\u2019t seen the Paracel Storm map we unveiled at Gamescom we encourage you to do so. There you can see how players have the option of taking down a turbine weakened by lightning in order to free the damaged destroyer stuck on it. If you manage to set the destroyer adrift, it will crash onto the island, changing the layout of the map and allowing your team to take control of the anti-air weaponry on the ship.<br />These moments are all triggered by the players \u2013 they aren\u2019t just timed moments that will happen no matter what you do in the match. You and your teammates will have to decide if it would be a better tactical decision to radically change the map, or if it would be wiser and better for your play-style if you stopped the other team from triggering these events.|access-date=September 16,

For instance, local media have \"sports pages\" (''sport'' in British English) and \"[[soccer]] coverage\" (soccer&mdash;originally slang for ''as'''soc'''iation football''&mdash;while used in Britain, is more usually called just ''football''). Singlish also uses many words borrowed from [[Min Nan|Hokkien]], the non-Mandarin Chinese language native to more than 75% of the [[Chinese Singaporeans|Chinese in Singapore]], and from [[Malay language|Malay]]. In many cases, English words take on the meaning of their Chinese counterparts, resulting in a shift in meaning. Vocabulary is also taken from Indian words such as ''dai'' meaning 'hey', ''goondu'' meaning 'fat', etc. This is most obvious in such cases as ''borrow''/''lend'', which are functionally equivalent in Singlish and mapped to the same Mandarin word, {{Lang|zh|{{linktext|\u501f}}}} (''ji\u00e8''), which can mean to lend or to borrow. For example: \"Oi, can I borrow your calculator?\" / \"Hey, can you lend me your calculator?\"\n\n==Singlish dictionaries and word lists==\n[[File:Coxford Singlish Dictionary.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The ''Coxford Singlish Dictionary'', a light-hearted lexicon of Singlish published in 2002]]\nThere have been several efforts to compile lexicons of Singlish, some for scholarly purposes, but most for entertainment. Two early humorous works were [[Sylvia Toh Paik Choo]]'s ''Eh, Goondu!'' (1982)<ref>{{cite book \n| last = Toh\n| first = Paik Choo\n| title = Eh, Goondu!\n| publisher = Eastern Universities Press\n| year=1982\n| location = Singapore\n| isbn = 978-9971-71-168-9}}</ref> and ''Lagi Goondu!'' (1986).<ref>{{cite book \n| last = Toh\n| first = Paik Choo\n| title = Lagi Goondu!\n| publisher = Times Books International\n| year=1986\n| location = Singapore\n| isbn = 978-9971-65-224-1}}</ref> In 1997 the second edition of the ''Times-Chambers Essential English Dictionary''<ref>{{cite book \n| title = Times-Chambers Essential English Dictionary\n| edition = 2nd\n| publisher = Federal Publications\n| year=1997\n| location = Singapore\n| isbn = 978-981-01-3727-4}}</ref> was published. To date, this is the only formal dictionary containing a substantial number of Singaporean English terms. Such entries and sub-entries are arranged alphabetically amongst the standard English entries. A list of common words borrowed from local languages such as Hokkien and Malay appears in an appendix. It appears that no subsequent editions have been published.\n\n2002 saw the publication of the ''Coxford Singlish Dictionary'',<ref>{{cite book \n| title = The Coxford Singlish Dictionary\n| publisher = Angsana Books\n|year=2002\n| location = Singapore\n| isbn = 978-981-3056-50-3}}</ref> a light-hearted lexicon which was developed from material posted on the website [http://www.talkingcock.com/html/lexec.php Talkingcock.com]. In 2004 a website, [http://www.singlishdictionary.com ''A Dictionary of Singlish and Singapore English''], was launched to document the actual usage of Singlish and Singapore English in published material, in the way that the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] does for standard English. Compiled by an amateur [[lexicographer]], the ''Dictionary'' appears to be one of the more comprehensive and professionally written dictionaries dealing exclusively with Singlish and Singapore English available so far.\n\nThe [[Singapore Tourism Board]] and tourism-related businesses have also produced short lists of commonly used Singlish terms, ostensibly to allow foreigners visiting Singapore to comprehend the local language better. Such lists have been printed in brochures or booklets, and also published on websites.\n\nThe lack of an officially printed version of a Singlish dictionary is due to the fact that the Singapore government frowns upon the use of Singlish, their official stand being that the speaking of Singlish will make Singaporeans difficult to understand when communicating with foreigners who are not familiar with Singlish. Thus, the government has made an effort to quash the use of Singlish and to promote the use of standard English through the [[Speak Good English Movement]] over the past few years. Though failing to discourage the use of Singlish, it has resulted in Singlish having a bad reputation in recent years, further stalling efforts to document actual Singlish usage.\n\nLetters contributed to the forum of ''[[The Straits Times]]'', the main local newspaper, by readers have called for Singlish to be kept alive in Singapore. Community efforts to do so include the aptly named \"Speak Good Singlish Movement\". The idea of promoting Singlish was raised as part of a larger debate on creating a uniquely Singaporean identity. However, the government has yet to officially change its stand regarding Singlish.\n\nA list of Singlish terms and expressions widely used in Singapore is set out below. It is not exhaustive and is meant to provide some representative examples of Singlish usage in Singapore. The origins of the Singlish terms are indicated where possible, and literal translations are provided where necessary.\n\n== Phonological sounds used in Singlish ==\nBelow are the phonological sounds used from the International Phonetic Alphabet used in Singlish.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 10px auto;\"\n|+ Consonants Used in Singlish Vocabulary<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Leimgruber|first=Jakob R.

There are a few loan words from these languages i.e. 'pek chek' is often taken as being annoyed or frustrated and originate [[Singaporean Hokkien|from the Hokkien dialect]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160919-the-language-the-government-tried-to-suppress|title=The language the government tried to suppress|last=Harbeck|first=James|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}</ref> It is used in casual contexts between Singaporeans, but is avoided in formal events when certain Singlish phrases may be considered unedifying. [[Singapore English]] can be broken into two subcategories. Standard Singapore English (SSE) and Colloquial Singapore English (CSE) or Singlish as many locals call it.

For instance, local media have \"sports pages\" (''sport'' in British English) and \"[[soccer]] coverage\" (soccer&mdash;originally slang for ''as'''soc'''iation football''&mdash;while used in Britain, is more usually called just ''football''). Singlish also uses many words borrowed from [[Min Nan|Hokkien]], the non-Mandarin Chinese language native to more than 75% of the [[Chinese Singaporeans|Chinese in Singapore]], and from [[Malay language|Malay]]. In many cases, English words take on the meaning of their Chinese counterparts, resulting in a shift in meaning. Vocabulary is also taken from Indian words such as ''dai'' meaning 'hey', ''goondu'' meaning 'fat', etc. This is most obvious in such cases as ''borrow''/''lend'', which are functionally equivalent in Singlish and mapped to the same Mandarin word, {{Lang|zh|{{linktext|\u501f}}}} (''ji\u00e8''), which can mean to lend or to borrow. For example: \"Oi, can I borrow your calculator?\" / \"Hey, can you lend me your calculator?\"\n\n==Singlish dictionaries and word lists==\n[[File:Coxford Singlish Dictionary.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The ''Coxford Singlish Dictionary'', a light-hearted lexicon of Singlish published in 2002]]\nThere have been several efforts to compile lexicons of Singlish, some for scholarly purposes, but most for entertainment. Two early humorous works were [[Sylvia Toh Paik Choo]]'s ''Eh, Goondu!'' (1982)<ref>{{cite book \n| last = Toh\n| first = Paik Choo\n| title = Eh, Goondu!\n| publisher = Eastern Universities Press\n| year=1982\n| location = Singapore\n| isbn = 978-9971-71-168-9}}</ref> and ''Lagi Goondu!''

To date, this is the only formal dictionary containing a substantial number of Singaporean English terms. Such entries and sub-entries are arranged alphabetically amongst the standard English entries. A list of common words borrowed from local languages such as Hokkien and Malay appears in an appendix. It appears that no subsequent editions have been published.\n\n2002 saw the publication of the ''Coxford Singlish Dictionary'',<ref>{{cite book \n| title = The Coxford Singlish Dictionary\n| publisher = Angsana Books\n|year=2002\n| location = Singapore\n| isbn = 978-981-3056-50-3}}</ref> a light-hearted lexicon which was developed from material posted on the website [http://www.talkingcock.com/html/lexec.php Talkingcock.com]. In 2004 a website, [http://www.singlishdictionary.com ''A Dictionary of Singlish and Singapore English''], was launched to document the actual usage of Singlish and Singapore English in published material, in the way that the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] does for standard English. Compiled by an amateur [[lexicographer]], the ''Dictionary'' appears to be one of the more comprehensive and professionally written dictionaries dealing exclusively with Singlish and Singapore English available so far.\n\nThe [[Singapore Tourism Board]] and tourism-related businesses have also produced short lists of commonly used Singlish terms, ostensibly to allow foreigners visiting Singapore to comprehend the local language better. Such lists have been printed in brochures or booklets, and also published on websites.\n\nThe lack of an officially printed version of a Singlish dictionary is due to the fact that the Singapore government frowns upon the use of Singlish, their official stand being that the speaking of Singlish will make Singaporeans difficult to understand when communicating with foreigners who are not familiar with Singlish. Thus, the government has made an effort to quash the use of Singlish and to promote the use of standard English through the [[Speak Good English Movement]] over the past few years. Though failing to discourage the use of Singlish, it has resulted in Singlish having a bad reputation in recent years, further stalling efforts to document actual Singlish usage.\n\nLetters contributed to the forum of ''[[The Straits Times]]'', the main local newspaper, by readers have called for Singlish to be kept alive in Singapore. Community efforts to do so include the aptly named \"Speak Good Singlish Movement\". The idea of promoting Singlish was raised as part of a larger debate on creating a uniquely Singaporean identity. However, the government has yet to officially change its stand regarding Singlish.\n\nA list of Singlish terms and expressions widely used in Singapore is set out below. It is not exhaustive and is meant to provide some representative examples of Singlish usage in Singapore. The origins of the Singlish terms are indicated where possible, and literal translations are provided where necessary.\n\n== Phonological sounds used in Singlish ==\nBelow are the phonological sounds used from the International Phonetic Alphabet used in Singlish.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 10px auto;\"\n|+ Consonants Used in Singlish Vocabulary<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Leimgruber|first=Jakob R.
