Sun Tzu is traditionally credited as the author of ''[[The Art of War]]'', an influential work of [[military strategy]] that has affected both [[Western philosophy|Western]] and [[East Asian philosophy]] and military thinking. His works focus much more on alternatives to battle, such as [[Ruse_de_guerre|stratagem]], delay, the use of spies and alternatives to war itself, the making and keeping of alliances, the uses of deceit and a willingness to submit, at least temporarily, to more powerful foes.<ref>''Ancient warfare'' edited by John Carman and Anthony Harding, page 41</ref> Sun Tzu is revered in [[Chinese culture|Chinese]] and East Asian culture as a legendary historical and military figure. His birth name was '''Sun Wu''' and he was known outside of his family by his [[courtesy name]] '''Changqing'''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} The name ''Sun Tzu'' by which he is best known in the Western World is an [[Chinese honorifics|honorific]] which means \"Master [[Sun (surname)|Sun]]\".\n\nSun Tzu's [[historicity]] is uncertain. The Han dynasty historian [[Sima Qian]] and other traditional Chinese historians placed him as a minister to [[King Hel\u00fc of Wu|King Hel\u00fc]] of [[state of Wu|Wu]] and dated his lifetime to 544\u2013496 BC. Modern scholars accepting his historicity place the extant text of ''The Art of War'' in the later [[Warring States period]] based on its style of composition and its descriptions of warfare.<ref>{{Citation|last=Sawyer|first=Ralph D.|title=The Seven Military Classics of Ancient China|year=2007|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-465-00304-4|pages=421\u201322}}</ref> Traditional accounts state that the general's descendant [[Sun Bin]] wrote a treatise on military tactics, also titled ''[[Sun Bin's Art of War|The Art of War]]''. Since Sun Wu and Sun Bin were referred to as Sun Tzu in classical Chinese texts, some historians believed them identical, prior to the rediscovery of Sun Bin's treatise in 1972.\n\nSun Tzu's work has been praised and employed in East Asian warfare since its composition. During the twentieth century, ''The Art of War'' grew in popularity and saw practical use in [[Western world|Western society]] as well. It continues to influence many competitive endeavors in the world, including culture, politics, business and sports, as well as modern warfare.<ref name=wp>{{citation|last=Scott|first=Wilson|title=Obama meets privately with Jewish leaders|date=7 March 2013|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-03-07/politics/37535039_1_nuclear-weapons-jewish-leaders-president-obama|newspaper=The Washington Post|location=Washington, D.C.|access-date=22 May 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724060741/http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-03-07/politics/37535039_1_nuclear-weapons-jewish-leaders-president-obama|archive-date=24 July 2013|df=}}</ref><ref name=UPI>{{citation|title=Obama to challenge Israelis on peace|agency=United Press International|date=8 March 2013|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2013/03/08/Obama-to-challenge-Israelis-on-peace/UPI-70151362729600/|accessdate=22 May 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Business\">{{citation|last=Garner|first=Rochelle|title=Oracle's Ellison Uses 'Art of War' in Software Battle With SAP|date=16 October 2006|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aFA0SRsqGq04|work=Bloomberg|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020122222/https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aFA0SRsqGq04|url-status=dead|access-date=18 May 2013|archive-date=20 October 2015}}</ref><ref name=Football>{{citation|last=Hack|first=Damon|title=For Patriots' Coach, War Is Decided Before Game|newspaper=The New York Times|date=3 February 2005|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/03/sports/football/03belichick.html|accessdate = 18 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Inscribed bamboo-slips of Art of War.jpg|thumb|The [[Yinqueshan Han Slips]] unearthed in 1972 include Sun Tzu's ''Art of War'', collection of [[Shandong Museum]]]]\nThe oldest available sources disagree as to where Sun Tzu was born.

Sun Tzu's victories then inspired him to write ''The Art of War''. ''The Art of War'' was one of the most widely read military treatises in the subsequent [[Warring States period]], a time of constant war among seven ancient Chinese states {{ndash}} [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]], Qi, [[Qin (state)|Qin]], [[Chu (state)|Chu]], [[Han (state)|Han]], [[Wei (state)|Wei]], and [[Yan (state)|Yan]] {{ndash}} who fought to control the vast expanse of fertile territory in Eastern China.<ref name=mcneilly3>{{harvnb|McNeilly|2001|pp=3\u20134}}.</ref>\n\nOne of the more well-known stories about Sun Tzu, taken from Sima Qian, illustrates Sun Tzu's temperament as follows: Before hiring Sun Tzu, the King of Wu tested Sun Tzu's skills by commanding him to train a [[harem]] of 360 [[Concubinage|concubines]] into soldiers. Sun Tzu divided them into two companies, appointing the two concubines most favored by the king as the company commanders. When Sun Tzu first ordered the concubines to face right, they giggled. In response, Sun Tzu said that the general, in this case himself, was responsible for ensuring that soldiers understood the commands given to them. Then, he reiterated the command, and again the concubines giggled. Sun Tzu then ordered the execution of the king's two favored concubines, to the king's protests. He explained that if the general's soldiers understood their commands but did not obey, it was the fault of the officers. Sun Tzu also said that, once a general was appointed, it was his duty to carry out his mission, even if the king protested. After both concubines were killed, new officers were chosen to replace them. Afterwards, both companies, now well aware of the costs of further frivolity, performed their maneuvers flawlessly.<ref name=bradford134>{{harvnb|Bradford|2000|pp=134\u201335}}.</ref>\n\nSima Qian claimed that Sun Tzu later proved on the battlefield that his theories were effective (for example, at the [[Battle of Boju]]), that he had a successful military career, and that he wrote ''The Art of War'' based on his tested expertise.<ref name=bradford134/> However, the ''[[Zuozhuan]]'', a historical text written centuries earlier than the ''Shiji'', provides a much more detailed account of the Battle of Boju, but does not mention Sun Tzu at all.<ref name=\"zuozhuan\">{{citation|chapterurl=http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/saxon/servlet/SaxonServlet?source=xwomen/texts/chunqiu.xml&style=xwomen/xsl/dynaxml.xsl&chunk.id=d2.17&toc.depth=1&toc.id=0&doc.lang=bilingual|chapter=Duke Ding|volume=XI|title=Zuo Zhuan|author=Zuo Qiuming|language=Chinese, English|title-link=Zuo Zhuan|author-link=Zuo Qiuming}}</ref>\n\n===Historicity===\nBeginning around the 12th century, some scholars began to doubt the historical existence of Sun Tzu, primarily on the grounds that he is not mentioned in the historical classic ''Zuo zhuan'', which mentions most of the notable figures from the Spring and Autumn period.{{sfnp|Gawlikowski|Loewe|1993|p=447}}  The name \"Sun Wu\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u5b6b\u6b66}}) does not appear in any text prior to the ''Shiji'',{{sfnp|Mair|2007|p=9}} and may have been a made-up descriptive cognomen meaning \"the fugitive warrior\": the surname \"Sun\" can be glossed as the related term \"fugitive\" (''x\u00f9n'' {{lang|zh-hant|\u905c}}), while \"Wu\" is the ancient Chinese virtue of \"martial, valiant\" (''w\u01d4'' {{lang|zh-hant|\u6b66}}), which corresponds to Sun Tzu's role as the hero's ''[[doppelg\u00e4nger]]'' in the story of [[Wu Zixu]].<ref name=\"Victor H 2007 pp. 9-10\">[[Victor H.

Attribution of the authorship of ''The Art of War'' varies among scholars and has included people and movements including Sun; [[state of Chu|Chu]] scholar [[Wu Zixu]]; an anonymous author; a school of theorists in [[state of Qi|Qi]] or [[state of Wu|Wu]]; [[Sun Bin]]; and others.<ref>{{harvnb|Sawyer|2005|pp=34\u201335}}.</ref> Sun Bin appears to have been an actual person who was a genuine authority on military matters, and may have been the inspiration for the creation of the historical figure \"Sun Tzu\" through a form of [[euhemerism]].<ref name=\"Victor H 2007 pp. 9-10\"/> The name Sun Wu does appear in later sources such as the ''Shiji'' and the ''[[Wu Yue Chunqiu]]'', but were written centuries after Sun Tzu's era.<ref>{{harvnb|Sawyer|2007|pp=176\u201377}}.</ref>\n\nThe use of the strips in other works however, such as ''[[The Methods of the Sima]]'' is considered proof of Sun Tzu's historical priority.<ref name=sawyer149>{{harvnb|Sawyer|1994|pp=149\u201350}}.</ref> According to Ralph Sawyer, it is very likely Sun Tzu did exist and not only served as a general but also wrote the core of the book that bears his name.<ref name=\"sawyer\"/> It is argued that there is a disparity between the large-scale wars and sophisticated techniques detailed in the text and the more primitive small-scale battles that many believe predominated in China during the 6th century BC. Against this, Sawyer argues that the teachings of Sun Wu were probably taught to succeeding generations in his family or a small school of disciples, which eventually included Sun Bin.

The first traditional view is that it was written in 512 BC by the historical Sun Wu, active in the last years of the Spring and Autumn period (c. 722\u2013481 BC). A second view, held by scholars such as Samuel Griffith, places ''The Art of War'' during the middle to late Warring States period (c. 481\u2013221 BC). Finally, a third school claims that the slips were published in the last half of the 5th century BC; this is based on how its adherents interpret the bamboo slips discovered at [[Yinqueshan Han Slips|Yinque Shan]] in 1972 AD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicsofstrategy.com/2015/11/sun-tzu-the-art-of-war-c-500-300-bc.html|title=Sun Tzu, The Art of War (c. 500\u2013300 B.C.)|publisher=Classics of Strategy|author=Morrow, Nicholas|date=4 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==''The Art of War''==\n{{Main|The Art of War}}\n[[File:Bamboo book - binding - UCR.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A copy of ''The Art of War'' written on bamboo|alt=A bamboo book]]\n''[[The Art of War]]'' is traditionally ascribed to Sun Tzu.

During the much later [[Song dynasty]], these six works were combined with a [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] text into a collection called the ''[[Seven Military Classics]]''. As a central part of that compilation, ''The Art of War'' formed the foundations of orthodox military theory in early modern China. Illustrating this point, the book was required reading to pass the tests for imperial appointment to military positions.<ref>{{harvnb|Sawyer|1994|pp=13\u201314}}.</ref>\n\nSun Tzu's The ''Art of War'' uses language that may be unusual in a Western text on warfare and strategy.<ref>{{harvnb|Simpkins|Simpkins|1999|pp=131\u201333}}.</ref> For example, the eleventh chapter states that a leader must be \"serene and inscrutable\" and capable of comprehending \"unfathomable plans\". The text contains many similar remarks that have long confused Western readers lacking an awareness of the [[East Asian religions|East Asian context]]. The meanings of such statements are clearer when interpreted in the context of [[Taoism|Taoist]] thought and practice. Sun Tzu viewed the ideal general as an [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightened]] Taoist master, which has led to ''The Art of War'' being considered a prime example of Taoist strategy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe book has also become popular among political leaders and those in [[business management]]. Despite its title, ''The Art of War'' addresses strategy in a broad fashion, touching upon [[public administration]] and planning. The text outlines theories of battle, but also advocates diplomacy and the cultivation of relationships with other nations as essential to the health of a state.<ref name=\"McNeilly1\"/>\n\nOn 10 April 1972, the [[Yinqueshan Han Tombs]] were accidentally unearthed by construction workers in [[Shandong]].<ref name=shandong>{{citation|title=Yinqueshan Han Bamboo Slips|url=http://www.sdwenbo.com/art.asp?id=26&type=6|date=24 April 2008|publisher=[[Shandong Provincial Museum]]|language=Chinese|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195157/http://www.sdwenbo.com/art.asp?id=26&type=6|archive-date=29 October 2013|df=}}</ref><ref name=\"Clements\">{{citation|last=Clements|first=Jonathan|title=The Art of War: A New Translation|date=21 June 2012|publisher=Constable & Robinson Ltd|isbn=978-1-78033-131-7|pages=77\u201378}}</ref> Scholars uncovered a [[Yinqueshan Han Slips|collection of ancient texts]] written on unusually well-preserved [[bamboo slips]].

The Chinese historian [[Sima Qian]] recounted that China's first historical [[emperor of China|emperor]], [[state of Qin|Qin]]'s [[Qin Shi Huang|Shi Huangdi]], considered the book invaluable in ending the time of the [[Warring States period|Warring States]]. In the 20th century, the [[Chinese Communist]] leader [[Mao Zedong]] partially credited his 1949 victory over [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and the [[Kuomintang]] to ''The Art of War''. The work strongly influenced Mao's [[Little Red Book|writings about guerrilla warfare]], which further influenced communist insurgencies around the world.<ref name=\"McNeilly2\"/>\n\n''The Art of War'' was introduced into Japan {{circa|lk=no|AD 760}} and the book quickly became popular among Japanese generals. Through its later influence on [[Oda Nobunaga]], [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], and [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]],<ref name=\"McNeilly2\">{{harvnb|McNeilly|2001|pp=6\u20137}}.</ref> it significantly affected the [[Edo period|unification of Japan]] in the early modern era. Before the [[Meiji Restoration]], mastery of its teachings was honored among the [[samurai]] and its teachings were both exhorted and exemplified by influential ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'' and ''[[sh\u014dgun]]s''.

Sun Tzu is traditionally credited as the author of ''[[The Art of War]]'', an influential work of [[military strategy]] that has affected both [[Western philosophy|Western]] and [[East Asian philosophy]] and military thinking. His works focus much more on alternatives to battle, such as [[Ruse_de_guerre|stratagem]], delay, the use of spies and alternatives to war itself, the making and keeping of alliances, the uses of deceit and a willingness to submit, at least temporarily, to more powerful foes.<ref>''Ancient warfare'' edited by John Carman and Anthony Harding, page 41</ref> Sun Tzu is revered in [[Chinese culture|Chinese]] and East Asian culture as a legendary historical and military figure. His birth name was '''Sun Wu''' and he was known outside of his family by his [[courtesy name]] '''Changqing'''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} The name ''Sun Tzu'' by which he is best known in the Western World is an [[Chinese honorifics|honorific]] which means \"Master [[Sun (surname)|Sun]]\".\n\nSun Tzu's [[historicity]] is uncertain. The Han dynasty historian [[Sima Qian]] and other traditional Chinese historians placed him as a minister to [[King Hel\u00fc of Wu|King Hel\u00fc]] of [[state of Wu|Wu]] and dated his lifetime to 544\u2013496 BC. Modern scholars accepting his historicity place the extant text of ''The Art of War'' in the later [[Warring States period]] based on its style of composition and its descriptions of warfare.<ref>{{Citation|last=Sawyer|first=Ralph D.|title=The Seven Military Classics of Ancient China|year=2007|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-465-00304-4|pages=421\u201322}}</ref> Traditional accounts state that the general's descendant [[Sun Bin]] wrote a treatise on military tactics, also titled ''[[Sun Bin's Art of War|The Art of War]]''. Since Sun Wu and Sun Bin were referred to as Sun Tzu in classical Chinese texts, some historians believed them identical, prior to the rediscovery of Sun Bin's treatise in 1972.\n\nSun Tzu's work has been praised and employed in East Asian warfare since its composition. During the twentieth century, ''The Art of War'' grew in popularity and saw practical use in [[Western world|Western society]] as well.

Sun Tzu's victories then inspired him to write ''The Art of War''. ''The Art of War'' was one of the most widely read military treatises in the subsequent [[Warring States period]], a time of constant war among seven ancient Chinese states {{ndash}} [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]], Qi, [[Qin (state)|Qin]], [[Chu (state)|Chu]], [[Han (state)|Han]], [[Wei (state)|Wei]], and [[Yan (state)|Yan]] {{ndash}} who fought to control the vast expanse of fertile territory in Eastern China.<ref name=mcneilly3>{{harvnb|McNeilly|2001|pp=3\u20134}}.</ref>\n\nOne of the more well-known stories about Sun Tzu, taken from Sima Qian, illustrates Sun Tzu's temperament as follows: Before hiring Sun Tzu, the King of Wu tested Sun Tzu's skills by commanding him to train a [[harem]] of 360 [[Concubinage|concubines]] into soldiers. Sun Tzu divided them into two companies, appointing the two concubines most favored by the king as the company commanders. When Sun Tzu first ordered the concubines to face right, they giggled. In response, Sun Tzu said that the general, in this case himself, was responsible for ensuring that soldiers understood the commands given to them. Then, he reiterated the command, and again the concubines giggled. Sun Tzu then ordered the execution of the king's two favored concubines, to the king's protests. He explained that if the general's soldiers understood their commands but did not obey, it was the fault of the officers.

The first traditional view is that it was written in 512 BC by the historical Sun Wu, active in the last years of the Spring and Autumn period (c. 722\u2013481 BC). A second view, held by scholars such as Samuel Griffith, places ''The Art of War'' during the middle to late Warring States period (c. 481\u2013221 BC).

It presents a [[philosophy of war]] for managing conflicts and winning battles. It is accepted as a [[masterpiece]] on strategy and has been frequently cited and referred to by generals and theorists since it was first published, translated, and distributed internationally.<ref name=\"McNeilly1\">{{harvnb|McNeilly|2001|p=5}}.</ref>\n\nThere are numerous theories concerning when the text was completed and concerning the identity of the author or authors, but archeological recoveries show ''The Art of War'' had taken roughly its current form by at least the early [[Han dynasty|Han]].<ref>{{harvnb|Sawyer|2007|p=423}}.</ref> Because it is impossible to prove definitively when the ''Art of War'' was completed before this date, the differing theories concerning the work's author or authors and date of completion are unlikely to be completely resolved.<ref>{{harvnb|Sawyer|2007|p=150}}.</ref> Some modern scholars believe that it contains not only the thoughts of its original author but also commentary and clarifications from later military theorists, such as [[Li Quan (general)|Li Quan]] and [[Du Mu]].\n\nOf the military texts written before the [[Qin's wars of unification|unification of China]] and [[Qin Shi Huang|Shi Huangdi]]'s subsequent [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|book burning]] in the second century BC, six major works have survived. During the much later [[Song dynasty]], these six works were combined with a [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] text into a collection called the ''[[Seven Military Classics]]''. As a central part of that compilation, ''The Art of War'' formed the foundations of orthodox military theory in early modern China. Illustrating this point, the book was required reading to pass the tests for imperial appointment to military positions.<ref>{{harvnb|Sawyer|1994|pp=13\u201314}}.</ref>\n\nSun Tzu's The ''Art of War'' uses language that may be unusual in a Western text on warfare and strategy.<ref>{{harvnb|Simpkins|Simpkins|1999|pp=131\u201333}}.</ref> For example, the eleventh chapter states that a leader must be \"serene and inscrutable\" and capable of comprehending \"unfathomable plans\". The text contains many similar remarks that have long confused Western readers lacking an awareness of the [[East Asian religions|East Asian context]]. The meanings of such statements are clearer when interpreted in the context of [[Taoism|Taoist]] thought and practice. Sun Tzu viewed the ideal general as an [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightened]] Taoist master, which has led to ''The Art of War'' being considered a prime example of Taoist strategy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe book has also become popular among political leaders and those in [[business management]]. Despite its title, ''The Art of War'' addresses strategy in a broad fashion, touching upon [[public administration]] and planning. The text outlines theories of battle, but also advocates diplomacy and the cultivation of relationships with other nations as essential to the health of a state.<ref name=\"McNeilly1\"/>\n\nOn 10 April 1972, the [[Yinqueshan Han Tombs]] were accidentally unearthed by construction workers in [[Shandong]].<ref name=shandong>{{citation|title=Yinqueshan Han Bamboo Slips|url=http://www.sdwenbo.com/art.asp?id=26&type=6|date=24 April 2008|publisher=[[Shandong Provincial Museum]]|language=Chinese|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195157/http://www.sdwenbo.com/art.asp?id=26&type=6|archive-date=29 October 2013|df=}}</ref><ref name=\"Clements\">{{citation|last=Clements|first=Jonathan|title=The Art of War: A New Translation|date=21 June 2012|publisher=Constable & Robinson Ltd|isbn=978-1-78033-131-7|pages=77\u201378}}</ref> Scholars uncovered a [[Yinqueshan Han Slips|collection of ancient texts]] written on unusually well-preserved [[bamboo slips]].

The Chinese historian [[Sima Qian]] recounted that China's first historical [[emperor of China|emperor]], [[state of Qin|Qin]]'s [[Qin Shi Huang|Shi Huangdi]], considered the book invaluable in ending the time of the [[Warring States period|Warring States]]. In the 20th century, the [[Chinese Communist]] leader [[Mao Zedong]] partially credited his 1949 victory over [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and the [[Kuomintang]] to ''The Art of War''. The work strongly influenced Mao's [[Little Red Book|writings about guerrilla warfare]], which further influenced communist insurgencies around the world.<ref name=\"McNeilly2\"/>\n\n''The Art of War'' was introduced into Japan {{circa|lk=no|AD 760}} and the book quickly became popular among Japanese generals.

Before the [[Meiji Restoration]], mastery of its teachings was honored among the [[samurai]] and its teachings were both exhorted and exemplified by influential ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'' and ''[[sh\u014dgun]]s''. It remained popular among the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Japanese armed forces]].

Production initially halted in 1993 after 65 episodes, with the last episode airing on May 22, 1994. From 1995 to 1996, the only new episodes broadcast were \"[[A Rugrats Passover]]\" and \"[[A Rugrats Chanukah]]\", two [[Judaism|Jewish]]-themed episodes that received critical acclaim; during this time, well after the end of the show's production run, ''Rugrats'' began to receive a boost in ratings and popularity with constant reruns on Nickelodeon. In 1996, [[Klasky Csupo|Klasky Csupo Animation]] began producing new episodes, and the show's fourth season began airing in 1997. As a result of the show's popularity, a [[Rugrats (film series)|series of theatrical films]] were released; ''[[Rugrats in Paris: The Movie]],'' which introduced Kimi, Kira, and Fifi released in 2000, and The final episode aired on June 8, 2004,<ref name= \"RugratsTVGuide\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/rugrats/episodes/191757/|title= Rugrats - TVGuide.com |work= TVGuide.com|accessdate=June 28, 2016}}</ref> bringing the series to a total of 172 episodes and 9 seasons during a 13-year run.\n\nOn July 21, 2001, Nickelodeon broadcast the made-for-TV special \"[[All Growed Up]]\" in celebration of the series' 10th anniversary. The special acted as a pilot for the ''Rugrats'' spin-off series ''[[All Grown Up!]]'', which chronicles the lives of the babies and their parents after they age 10 years. Another spin-off series, ''[[Rugrats Pre-School Daze]]'', was considered, but only four episodes were produced. Two direct-to-video specials were released in 2005 and 2006, under the title ''Rugrats Tales from the Crib''. [[Tie-in]] media for the series include video games, comics, toys, and various other merchandise.\n\n''Rugrats'' gained over 20 awards during its 13-year run, including 4 [[Daytime Emmy Award]]s, 6 [[Kids' Choice Awards]], and its own star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. The series garnered Nickelodeon high ratings and was the network's top-rated show between 1995 and 2000. It was Nickelodeon's longest-running Nicktoon until 2012 when ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' aired its 173rd episode.\n\nOn July 16, 2018, it was announced that Nickelodeon had given a series order to a 26-episode revival of the series, executive produced by Klasky, Csupo, and Germain.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Goldberg |first1=Lesley |title='Rugrats' Revived at Viacom With New Nickelodeon Series, Feature Film |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/rugrats-revived-at-viacom-new-nickelodeon-series-feature-film-1127473 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |date=July 16, 2018 |accessdate=July 16, 2018 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Andreeva |first1=Nellie |last2=Petski |first2=Denise |title='Rugrats' Returns With Nickelodeon Series Revival & Live-Action Paramount Movie |url=https://deadline.com/2018/07/rugrats-revival-series-nickelodeon-live-action-movie-paramount-1202427458/ |website=Deadline |accessdate=July 16, 2018 |date=July 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Series overview==\n<onlyinclude>{{Series overview\n| color0S     = #AE0057\n| link0S      = <includeonly>List of Rugrats episodes</includeonly>#Pilot (2001)\n| linkT0S     = Pilot\n| start0S     = August 7, 2001 <small>(on DVD)</small>\n\n| color1     = #FF5F5F\n| link1      = <includeonly>List of Rugrats episodes</includeonly>#Season 1 (1991\u201392)\n| episodes1  = 13\n| start1     = {{Start date|1991|8|11}}\n| end1       = {{End date|1992|5|24}}\n\n| color2     = #FF7F00\n| link2      = <includeonly>List of Rugrats episodes</includeonly>#Season 2 (1992\u201393)\n| episodes2  = 26\n| start2     = {{Start date|1992|9|6}}\n| end2       = {{End date|1993|5|9}}\n\n| color3     = #FFFF00\n| link3      = <includeonly>List of Rugrats episodes</includeonly>#Season 3 (1993\u201395)\n| episodes3  = 26\n| start3     = {{Start date|1993|9|26}}\n| end3       = {{End date|1995|4|13}}\n\n| color4     = #00FF00\n| link4      = <includeonly>List of Rugrats episodes</includeonly>#Season 4 (1996\u201397)\n| episodes4  = 17\n| start4     = {{Start date|1996|12|4}}\n| end4       = {{End date|1997|11|22}}\n\n| color5     = #0000FF\n| link5      = <includeonly>List of Rugrats episodes</includeonly>#Season 5 (1998)\n| episodes5  = 12\n| start5     = {{Start date|1998|8|15}}\n| end5       = {{End date|1998|9|21}}\n\n| color6     = #800080\n| link6      = <includeonly>List of Rugrats episodes</includeonly>#Season 6 (1999\u20132001)\n| episodes6  = 36\n| start6     = {{Start date|1999|1|18}}\n| end6       = {{End date|2001|7|20}}\n\n| color7     = #FFC0CB\n| link7      = <includeonly>List of Rugrats episodes</includeonly>#Season 7 (2001\u201302)\n| episodes7  = 14\n| start7     = {{Start date|2001|1|15}}\n| end7       = {{End date|2002|1|21}}\n\n| color8     = #F857BA\n| link8      = <includeonly>List of Rugrats episodes</includeonly>#Season 8 (2001\u201303)\n| episodes8  = 14\n| start8     = {{Start date|2001|7|21}}\n| end8       = {{End date|2003|1|10}}\n\n| color9     = #8A4500\n| link9      = <includeonly>List of Rugrats episodes</includeonly>#Season 9 (2002\u201304)\n| episodes9  = 14\n| start9     = {{Start date|2002|9|28}}\n| end9       = {{End date|2004|6|8}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Episodes==\n\n===Pilot (2001)===\n{{Episode table\n|background = #AE0057\n|title      = 30\n|director   = 15\n|writer     = 23\n|airdate    = 11\n|prodcode   = 7\n|episodes   =\n{{Episode list\n|Title           = Tommy Pickles and The Great White Thing\n|DirectedBy      = [[Peter Chung]]\n|WrittenBy       = Ben Herndon and [[Paul Germain]]\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2001|8|7}} <small>(on DVD)</small><ref group=lower-alpha>The pilot episode was later released on the ''Decade in Diapers'' VHS/DVD.</ref>\n|ProdCode        = 100\n|ShortSummary    = After seeing his grandpa go into the bathroom so many times, Tommy Pickles wants to go in to see what the \"great white thing\" (toilet) was, creating a mess when he investigates it.\n\n''Note'': Tami Hollbrook voices Tommy in this episode.\n|LineColor       = AE0057\n}}\n}}\n\n===Season 1 (1991\u201392)===\n{{Episode table\n|background = #FF5F5F\n|overall    = 8\n|season     = 6\n|title      = 30\n|director   = 15\n|writer     = 23\n|airdate    = 11\n|prodcode   = 7\n|episodes   =\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber   = 1\n|EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n|Title           = Tommy's First Birthday\n|DirectedBy      = Howard E.

Production initially halted in 1993 after 65 episodes, with the last episode airing on May 22, 1994. From 1995 to 1996, the only new episodes broadcast were \"[[A Rugrats Passover]]\" and \"[[A Rugrats Chanukah]]\", two [[Judaism|Jewish]]-themed episodes that received critical acclaim; during this time, well after the end of the show's production run, ''Rugrats'' began to receive a boost in ratings and popularity with constant reruns on Nickelodeon. In 1996, [[Klasky Csupo|Klasky Csupo Animation]] began producing new episodes, and the show's fourth season began airing in 1997. As a result of the show's popularity, a [[Rugrats (film series)|series of theatrical films]] were released; ''[[Rugrats in Paris: The Movie]],'' which introduced Kimi, Kira, and Fifi released in 2000, and The final episode aired on August 1, 2004,<ref name= \"RugratsTVGuide\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/rugrats/episodes/191757/|title= Rugrats - TVGuide.com |work= TVGuide.com|accessdate=June 28, 2016}}</ref> bringing the series to a total of 172 episodes and 9 seasons during a 13-year run.\n\nOn July 21, 2001, Nickelodeon broadcast the made-for-TV special \"[[All Growed Up]]\" in celebration of the series' 10th anniversary. The special acted as a pilot for the ''Rugrats'' spin-off series ''[[All Grown Up!]]'', which chronicles the lives of the babies and their parents after they age 10 years. Another spin-off series, ''[[Rugrats Pre-School Daze]]'', was considered, but only four episodes were produced. Two direct-to-video specials were released in 2005 and 2006, under the title ''Rugrats Tales from the Crib''. [[Tie-in]] media for the series include video games, comics, toys, and various other merchandise.\n\n''Rugrats'' gained over 20 awards during its 13-year run, including 4 [[Daytime Emmy Award]]s, 6 [[Kids' Choice Awards]], and its own star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. The series garnered Nickelodeon high ratings and was the network's top-rated show between 1995 and 2000. It was Nickelodeon's longest-running Nicktoon until 2012 when ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' aired its 173rd episode.\n\nOn July 16, 2018, it was announced that Nickelodeon had given a series order to a 26-episode revival of the series, executive produced by Klasky, Csupo, and Germain.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Goldberg |first1=Lesley |title='Rugrats' Revived at Viacom With New Nickelodeon Series, Feature Film |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/rugrats-revived-at-viacom-new-nickelodeon-series-feature-film-1127473 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |date=July 16, 2018 |accessdate=July 16, 2018 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Andreeva |first1=Nellie |last2=Petski |first2=Denise |title='Rugrats' Returns With Nickelodeon Series Revival & Live-Action Paramount Movie |url=https://deadline.com/2018/07/rugrats-revival-series-nickelodeon-live-action-movie-paramount-1202427458/ |website=Deadline |accessdate=July 16, 2018 |date=July 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Series overview==\n<onlyinclude>{{Series overview\n| color0S     = #AE0057\n| link0S      = <includeonly>List of Rugrats episodes</includeonly>#Pilot (2001)\n| linkT0S     = Pilot\n| start0S     = August 7, 2001 <small>(on DVD)</small>\n\n| color1     = #FF5F5F\n| link1      = <includeonly>List of Rugrats episodes</includeonly>#Season 1 (1991\u201392)\n| episodes1  = 13\n| start1     = {{Start date|1991|8|11}}\n| end1       = {{End date|1992|5|24}}\n\n| color2     = #FF7F00\n| link2      = <includeonly>List of Rugrats episodes</includeonly>#Season 2 (1992\u201393)\n| episodes2  = 26\n| start2     = {{Start date|1992|9|6}}\n| end2       = {{End date|1993|5|9}}\n\n| color3     = #FFFF00\n| link3      = <includeonly>List of Rugrats episodes</includeonly>#Season 3 (1993\u201395)\n| episodes3  = 26\n| start3     = {{Start date|1993|9|26}}\n| end3       = {{End date|1995|4|13}}\n\n| color4     = #00FF00\n| link4      = <includeonly>List of Rugrats episodes</includeonly>#Season 4 (1996\u201397)\n| episodes4  = 17\n| start4     = {{Start date|1996|12|4}}\n| end4       = {{End date|1997|11|22}}\n\n| color5     = #0000FF\n| link5      = <includeonly>List of Rugrats episodes</includeonly>#Season 5 (1998)\n| episodes5  = 12\n| start5     = {{Start date|1998|8|15}}\n| end5       = {{End date|1998|9|21}}\n\n| color6     = #800080\n| link6      = <includeonly>List of Rugrats episodes</includeonly>#Season 6 (1999\u20132001)\n| episodes6  = 36\n| start6     = {{Start date|1999|1|18}}\n| end6       = {{End date|2001|7|20}}\n\n| color7     = #FFC0CB\n| link7      = <includeonly>List of Rugrats episodes</includeonly>#Season 7 (2001\u201302)\n| episodes7  = 14\n| start7     = {{Start date|2001|1|15}}\n| end7       = {{End date|2002|1|21}}\n\n| color8     = #F857BA\n| link8      = <includeonly>List of Rugrats episodes</includeonly>#Season 8 (2001\u201303)\n| episodes8  = 14\n| start8     = {{Start date|2001|7|21}}\n| end8       = {{End date|2003|1|10}}\n\n| color9     = #8A4500\n| link9      = <includeonly>List of Rugrats episodes</includeonly>#Season 9 (2002\u201304)\n| episodes9  = 14\n| start9     = {{Start date|2002|9|28}}\n| end9       = {{End date|2004|8|1}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Episodes==\n\n===Pilot (2001)===\n{{Episode table\n|background = #AE0057\n|title      = 30\n|director   = 15\n|writer     = 23\n|airdate    = 11\n|prodcode   = 7\n|episodes   =\n{{Episode list\n|Title           = Tommy Pickles and The Great White Thing\n|DirectedBy      = [[Peter Chung]]\n|WrittenBy       = Ben Herndon and [[Paul Germain]]\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2001|8|7}} <small>(on DVD)</small><ref group=lower-alpha>The pilot episode was later released on the ''Decade in Diapers'' VHS/DVD.</ref>\n|ProdCode        = 100\n|ShortSummary    = After seeing his grandpa go into the bathroom so many times, Tommy Pickles wants to go in to see what the \"great white thing\" (toilet) was, creating a mess when he investigates it.\n\n''Note'': Tami Hollbrook voices Tommy in this episode.\n|LineColor       = AE0057\n}}\n}}\n\n===Season 1 (1991\u201392)===\n{{Episode table\n|background = #FF5F5F\n|overall    = 8\n|season     = 6\n|title      = 30\n|director   = 15\n|writer     = 23\n|airdate    = 11\n|prodcode   = 7\n|episodes   =\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber   = 1\n|EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n|Title           = Tommy's First Birthday\n|DirectedBy      = Howard E.
