(UK TV series)|Who Do You Think You Are?]]\" that he is descended from the Couch family who operated the mill in the 19th century.<ref> http://m.whodoyouthinkyouaremagazine.com/episode/nigel-havers </ref>\n\n==Couch Descendants== \nThe Couch family is large and has branched in many directions. They spread out between the Eastern and Southern United States, Australia, Canada, Italy, and some still remaining in England near Couch\u2019s mill. The Couch\u2019s were said to have been a class of nobility while we resided in Cornwall. The family had a massed some wealth and lived in a large estate. They would refer to themselves as [[Master]] and [[Mistress]]. They also had close ties and friendships to the people living at what is now [[https://www.boconnoc.com/|Bonnocc Estate]]. \n\nThe particular branch I will be referencing is the one that migrated to [[New England]].\nAround the early 1900\u2019s, Raymond Couch was brought here by his father who lived in Couch\u2019s Mill. \nIt is unsure of where they first settled, However, their final destination was [[Maine]].\n\nRaymond Couch was said to have met his wife Margaret Beauchanine during [[World War II|WWII]]. Margaret was the Nurse who cared for him, they quickly fell for each other. They had over five children, one of them being Shirley Couch. When Shirley was around 25 years old she moved to NH and was there the remainder of her life. She had four girls, Bonnie T, Donna Rae Barratt, Mary, and (unknown).\n\nDonna Barratt has two children, David Kenneth Barratt and Stephanie Torrance. \nDonna took her children and moved to RI, for a short period. In this time, David B met his spouse Lynn Gerry. Together they had 2 children; Anthony Barratt and Nicholas Barratt. Stephanie, Donna\u2019s daughter has 5 children; Angel Barratt, Hector Guzman, Nadia Guzman, Kellen, and Benny.\nThe family mostly remains in New England. The family still holds the title of master/mistress before their name by choice.\n\n  \n\n\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Cornwall}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Cornwall|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Hamlets in Cornwall]]\n\n\n{{Cornwall-geo-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{Infobox UK place\n|static_image_name=  Couchs Mill - geograph.org.uk - 1550716.jpg\n|static_image_caption=  Couch's Mill\n|official_name=     Couch's Mill\n|country=           England\n|region=            South West England\n|os_grid_reference=  SX1460\n|coordinates = {{coord|50.401|-4.604|display=inline,title}}\n|label_position=  top\n|civil_parish=  [[Boconnoc]]\n|unitary_england=  [[Cornwall]]\n|lieutenancy_england=  [[Cornwall]]\n|constituency_westminster=  [[South East Cornwall (UK Parliament constituency)|South East Cornwall]]\n|post_town=  LOSTWITHIEL\n|postcode_area=     PL\n|postcode_district= PL22\n|dial_code=         01208<br>01503\n}}\n\n'''Couch's Mill''' is a small [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] in east [[Cornwall]], England, United Kingdom.

that officials knowingly lied by repeatedly asserting the attack was spontaneously triggered by the [[Innocence of Muslims]] video rather than a pre-planned terrorist attack; that a secret CIA gun-running operation to Syrian rebels was being conducted out of Libya; that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were absent and negligent on the night of the attack; that Hillary Clinton had personally declined multiple requests for more security at the compound; that a live video feed of the attack was viewed at the White House or State Department; that Ambassador Stevens had been captured by terrorists and dragged through the streets; and that witnesses had been prevented from testifying. These accusations were widely shared across various blogs and social media platforms. Ultimately, none of the accusations of scandal and cover-up were confirmed by any of the [[Investigation into the 2012 Benghazi attack|ten Benghazi investigations]], including six investigations conducted by Republican-controlled congressional committees.\n\nThe [[Center for Media and Public Affairs]] at George Mason University described the conclusions of an unpublished study on November 2, 2012.

That led Susan Rice, then U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, to inaccurately assert that the attack had evolved from a protest, when in fact there had been no protest. But it was intelligence analysts, not political appointees, who made the wrong call, the committee found. The report did not conclude that Rice or any other government official acted in bad faith or intentionally misled the American people.\n\n...\n\nIn the aftermath of the attacks, Republicans criticized the Obama administration and its then-secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is expected to run for president in 2016. People in and out of government have alleged that a CIA response team was ordered to \"stand down\" after the State Department compound came under attack, that a military rescue was nixed, that officials intentionally downplayed the role of al-Qaida figures in the attack, and that Stevens and the CIA were involved in a secret operation to spirit weapons out of Libya and into the hands of Syrian rebels. None of that is true, according to the House Intelligence Committee report.\n\nThe report did find, however, that the State Department facility where Stevens and Smith were killed was not well-protected, and that State Department security agents knew they could not defend it from a well-armed attack.

that officials knowingly lied by repeatedly asserting the attack was spontaneously triggered by the [[Innocence of Muslims]] video rather than a pre-planned terrorist attack; that a secret CIA gun-running operation to Syrian rebels was being conducted out of Libya; that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were absent and negligent on the night of the attack; that Hillary Clinton had personally declined multiple requests for more security at the compound; that a live video feed of the attack was viewed at the White House or State Department; that Ambassador Stevens had been captured by terrorists and dragged through the streets; and that witnesses had been prevented from testifying. These accusations were widely shared across various blogs and social media platforms. Ultimately, none of the accusations of scandal and cover-up were confirmed by any of the [[Investigation into the 2012 Benghazi attack|ten Benghazi investigations]], including six investigations conducted by Republican-controlled congressional committees.\n\nThe [[Center for Media and Public Affairs]] at George Mason University described the conclusions of an unpublished study on November 2, 2012.

That led Susan Rice, then U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, to inaccurately assert that the attack had evolved from a protest, when in fact there had been no protest. But it was intelligence analysts, not political appointees, who made the wrong call, the committee found. The report did not conclude that Rice or any other government official acted in bad faith or intentionally misled the American people.\n\n...\n\nIn the aftermath of the attacks, Republicans criticized the Obama administration and its then-secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is expected to run for president in 2016. People in and out of government have alleged that a CIA response team was ordered to \"stand down\" after the State Department compound came under attack, that a military rescue was nixed, that officials intentionally downplayed the role of al-Qaida figures in the attack, and that Stevens and the CIA were involved in a secret operation to spirit weapons out of Libya and into the hands of Syrian rebels. None of that is true, according to the House Intelligence Committee report.\n\nThe report did find, however, that the State Department facility where Stevens and Smith were killed was not well-protected, and that State Department security agents knew they could not defend it from a well-armed attack.

She gained recognition by winning both the 1984 [[Ang Bagong Kampeon]] and the 1989 [[Asia-Pacific Song Contest]], representing the Philippines in the latter. Velasquez rose to fame with the release of \"Kung Maibabalik Ko Lang\" from her [[Regine (album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1987. The album was generally well received and produced two more singles, \"Urong Sulong\" and \"Isang Lahi\", that established her as a commercially viable [[Music of the Philippines#Original Pilipino Music|Filipino pop]] artist.\n\nVelasquez-Alcasid signed a recording contract with [[Polygram|Polygram Records]] in 1994 and released ''[[Listen Without Prejudice (Regine Velasquez album)|Listen Without Prejudice]]'', marking her debut as an up-and-coming artist in the [[Music of Asia|Southeast and East Asian region]]. It became her best-selling record in the region to date and produced {{nowrap|\"In Love With You\"}}, which became her most successful single of the 1990s. Its accompanying music video was named Video of the Decade by [[MTV Asia]]. Velasquez parted with Polygram in 1997, citing a lack of creative control over her music and public image, and signed a record deal with [[VIVA Records]] the following year. She was given full conceptual and creative control as the executive producer of ''[[R2K]]'' (1999). The album became the [[List of best-selling albums in the Philippines|best-selling album by a female artist]] in the Philippines, and the best-selling album by a local artist in 1999 and 2000.\n\nVelasquez ventured into film with a lead role in ''[[Regine Velasquez filmography#Movies|Wanted Perfect Mother]]'' (1996). She continued to play female lead roles in romantic comedy films \u2014 including ''[[Kailangan Ko'y Ikaw]]'' (2000) and ''Pangako Ikaw Lang'' (2001), with the latter being the highest-grossing Filipino film in 2001. She has also been successful in television with the shows ''[[Maalaala Mo Kaya#Notable episodes|Maalaala Mo Kaya]]'' (2002), ''[[Forever In My Heart]]'' (2004), ''[[Diva (2010 TV series)|Diva]]''{{nbsp}}(2010) and ''[[Poor Se\u00f1orita]]'' (2016). In the first of these, she appeared as a mentally challenged woman in a featured episode, which earned her a [[16th PMPC Star Awards for Television|Star Award for Best Actress]], while the other three were lead roles in prime time television shows.\n\nDuring her career, Velasquez has sold more than 8.5 million records regionally.

She gained recognition by winning both the 1984 [[Ang Bagong Kampeon]] and the 1989 [[Asia-Pacific Song Contest]], representing the Philippines in the latter. Velasquez rose to fame with the release of \"Kung Maibabalik Ko Lang\" from her [[Regine (album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1987. The album was generally well received and produced two more singles, \"Urong Sulong\" and \"Isang Lahi\", that established her as a commercially viable [[Music of the Philippines#Original Pilipino Music|Filipino pop]] artist.\n\nVelasquez-Alcasid signed a recording contract with [[Polygram|Polygram Records]] in 1994 and released ''[[Listen Without Prejudice (Regine Velasquez album)|Listen Without Prejudice]]'', marking her debut as an up-and-coming artist in the [[Music of Asia|Southeast and East Asian region]]. It became her best-selling record in the region to date and produced {{nowrap|\"In Love With You\"}}, which became her most successful single of the 1990s. Its accompanying music video was named Video of the Decade by [[MTV Asia]]. Velasquez parted with Polygram in 1997, citing a lack of creative control over her music and public image, and signed a record deal with [[VIVA Records]] the following year. She was given full conceptual and creative control as the executive producer of ''[[R2K]]'' (1999). The album became the [[List of best-selling albums in the Philippines|best-selling album by a female artist]] in the Philippines, and the best-selling album by a local artist in 1999 and 2000.\n\nVelasquez ventured into film with a lead role in ''[[Regine Velasquez filmography#Movies|Wanted Perfect Mother]]'' (1996). She continued to play female lead roles in romantic comedy films \u2014 including ''[[Kailangan Ko'y Ikaw]]'' (2000) and ''Pangako Ikaw Lang'' (2001), with the latter being the highest-grossing Filipino film in 2001. She has also been successful in television with the shows ''[[Maalaala Mo Kaya#Notable episodes|Maalaala Mo Kaya]]'' (2002), ''[[Forever In My Heart]]'' (2004), ''[[Diva (2010 TV series)|Diva]]''{{nbsp}}(2010) and ''[[Poor Se\u00f1orita]]'' (2016). In the first of these, she appeared as a mentally challenged woman in a featured episode, which earned her a [[16th PMPC Star Awards for Television|Star Award for Best Actress]], while the other three were lead roles in prime time television shows.\n\nDuring her career, Velasquez has sold more than 8.5 million records regionally.
