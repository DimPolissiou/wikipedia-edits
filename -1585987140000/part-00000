[[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] driver [[Michael Schumacher]] won the 71-lap race from a third-position start. [[Giancarlo Fisichella]] of the [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]] team finished in second and [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]]'s [[Heinz-Harald Frentzen]] was third.\n\n[[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]] of the [[McLaren]] team took [[pole position]] by recording the fastest lap in qualifying. He led on the first lap of the race before Michael Schumacher passed him at the start of lap two. Thereafter, Michael Schumacher opened up a 17.6 second lead before his first of two [[pit stop]]s for fuel and tyres on lap 20. He retook the lead after H\u00e4kkinen retired with a loss of engine oil pressure ten laps later. [[David Coulthard]] in the other McLaren gained on Michael Schumacher in the final 12 laps as the latter slowed to manage an [[oil pressure]] problem. He was not close enough to make a pass for the win and Michael Schumacher took his second consecutive victory of the season, his third in Brazil and the 37th of his career.\n\nAfter the race, Coulthard was disqualified from second place due to an illegal front wing endplate. McLaren filed an appeal to the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile]]'s International Court of Appeal, which was rejected. The disqualification advanced every driver behind Coulthard by a single position. The result extended Michael Schumacher's lead atop the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Drivers' Championship]] to 12 [[List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems|points]]. Fisichella moved from fifth to second as [[Rubens Barrichello]] in the second Ferrari fell to third after not finishing the race. Ferrari further increased their lead in the [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|Constructors' Championship]] to 18 points as Benetton advanced to second with fifteen races left in the season.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Aut\u00f3dromo Jos\u00e9 Carlos Pace, July 3, 2018 SkySat (cropped).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|The [[Aut\u00f3dromo Jos\u00e9 Carlos Pace]] ''(pictured in 2018)'', where the race was held.]]\nThe 2000 [[Brazilian Grand Prix]] was the second of the 17 motor races in the [[2000 Formula One World Championship]] and the 29th overall edition of the event.

[[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] driver [[Michael Schumacher]] won the 71-lap race from a third-position start. [[Giancarlo Fisichella]] of the [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]] team finished in second and [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]]'s [[Heinz-Harald Frentzen]] was third.\n\n[[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]] of the [[McLaren]] team took [[pole position]] by recording the fastest lap in qualifying. He led on the first lap of the race before Michael Schumacher passed him at the start of lap two. Thereafter, Michael Schumacher opened up a 17.6 second lead before his first of two [[pit stop]]s for fuel and tyres on lap 20. He retook the lead after H\u00e4kkinen retired with a loss of engine oil pressure ten laps later. [[David Coulthard]] in the other McLaren gained on Michael Schumacher in the final 12 laps as the latter slowed to manage an [[oil pressure]] problem. He was not close enough to make a pass for the win and Michael Schumacher took his second consecutive victory of the season, his third in Brazil and the 37th of his career.\n\nAfter the race, Coulthard was disqualified from second place due to an illegal front wing endplate. McLaren filed an appeal to the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile]]'s International Court of Appeal, which was rejected. The disqualification advanced every driver behind Coulthard by a single position. The result extended Michael Schumacher's lead atop the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Drivers' Championship]] to 12 [[List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems|points]]. Fisichella moved from fifth to second as [[Rubens Barrichello]] in the second Ferrari fell to third after not finishing the race. Ferrari further increased their lead in the [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|Constructors' Championship]] to 18 points as Benetton advanced to second with fifteen races left in the season.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Aut\u00f3dromo Jos\u00e9 Carlos Pace, July 3, 2018 SkySat (cropped).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|The [[Aut\u00f3dromo Jos\u00e9 Carlos Pace]] ''(pictured in 2018)'', where the race was held.]]\nThe 2000 [[Brazilian Grand Prix]] was the second of the 17 motor races in the [[2000 Formula One World Championship]] and the 29th overall edition of the event.

Each week, 20 contestants compete in a series of challenges in an attempt to win \u00a310,000. These challenges were based in large pools of water or mud and generally involved large [[assault course]]s that participants had to cross. The 20 contestants are narrowed down to 12, then to either 6 or 5, with the final 3 progressing to the Wipeout Zone.\n\n''Total Wipeout'' was a licensed version of ''[[Wipeout (2008 U.S. game show)|Wipeout]]'', the [[Endemol]] show that originated in the United States in 2008, with the name slightly altered to avoid confusion with the BBC version of the [[Wipeout (UK game show)|earlier game show of the same name]].\n\nOn 29 March 2012, the BBC confirmed that they would axe ''Total Wipeout'' after its sixth series.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sweney|first=Mark|title=Total Wipeout dropped by BBC1|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/mar/29/total-wipeout-dropped-bbc1?newsfeed=true|newspaper=Guardian|date=29 March 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2122176/Total-Wipeout-axed-series-served-purpose.html?ito=feeds-newsxml BBC show Total Wipeout axed after six series after it had 'served its purpose']</ref> The remaining 10 episodes from Series 5 began airing on 18 August 2012\n\n==Format==\nThe show is hosted by [[Richard Hammond]], who commentates as the contestants attempt to complete the challenges. He is also seen in a studio to provide certain links within the show. Although the main footage was filmed in Buenos Aires, Argentina,<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00gvnn8 |title=BBC One \u2013 Total Wipeout, Series 1 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2012-06-30 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref> Hammond recorded his sections from a studio in England. Meanwhile, [[Amanda Byram]] interviewed the contestants during the show and remained on the sidelines as they made their way through the course.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00gmmv8|title=BBC One Programmes \u2013 Total Wipeout, Episode 1}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{Main|List of Total Wipeout obstacles}}During ''Total Wipeout'' contestants are put through a series of obstacle courses and challenges. After each challenge a certain number of them are eliminated from the competition. After the fourth and final round the fastest of the remaining three competitors around the course wins the game and the cash prize. The eliminated contestants can be seen sitting at the side during later challenges.\n\n===Stage 1===\n====The Qualifier====\n''The Qualifier'' involves twenty contestants attempting to complete a short obstacle course in the least time possible; the eight contestants with the slowest times are eliminated, with the fastest twelve advancing to either The Sweeper or Crash Mountain or Double Cross. The Qualifier contains the dominant Sucker Punch and Big Balls. The first and last obstacles change every week, however the first obstacle is always set over a pool of water or mud, and the final obstacle is always a 'swing' to the goal. 52 contenders in the show's history have conquered the Big Balls, declared by Hammond as the hardest Wipeout obstacle ever. Those are: Jo and Carole (Series 1, Episode 5), Kierron (Series 1, Episode 7), Alice (Series 2, Episode 2), Alex (Series 2, Episode 6), Eliza, Julian and Victoria (Series 2, Episode 8), Chris and Katie(Series 2, \"Champion of Champions\"), Paul and Nix (Series 3, Episode 2), Colm, Nic, Ed and Becky (Series 3, Episode 6), Junior and Andy (Series 3, \"Champion of Champions\"), [[Jason King (radio)|Jason King]] and [[Sarah Cawood]] (Series 3, \"Celebrity Special #2\"), Liam (Series 4, Episode 1), Andy (Series 4, Episode 3 and Champion of Champions), Katie (Series 4, Episode 5), Fran (Series 4, Episode 6), Tamara (Series 4, Episode 7) Scott, Frankie, Mikey and James (Series 4, \"Champion of Champions\"), [[Chris Simmons]] (Series 4, \"Celebrity Special #1\"), [[Dean Macey]] (Series 4 \"Celebrity Special #2\"), Marina (Winter Wipeout, Episode 1), Dan (Winter Wipeout, Episode 3 and Champion of Champions), Lawrence (Winter Wipeout, Episode 6), John W (Winter Wipeout, Episode 6 and Champion of Champions), Tom (Winter Wipeout, Episode 7) Edward (Winter Wipeout, Episode 8), Jon, Helen, Mikey, John C, and John W (Winter Wipeout, \"Champion of Champions\"), [[Nicola McLean]] (Series 5, \"Celebrity Special #1\"), [[Clare Nasir]] (Series 5, \"Celebrity Special #2),  Becky and Amanda (Series 5 Episode 1), Ron (Series 5, Episode 4) William and Helene (Series 5 Episode 7), Amy, Ellen and Liam (Series 5 Episode 8), and Ashley, (Series 5 \"Champion of Champions).  Only 7 contestants; Kierron (Series 1, Episode 7), Becky and Ed (Series 3, Episode 6), Junior (Series 3, \"Champion of Champions\"), James (Series 4, \"Champion of Champions\"), [[Chris Simmons]] (Series 4, \"Champion of Champions\") and William (Series 5, Episode 7) have not fallen off any obstacle during the Qualifier.\n\nAs of August 2012, the fastest time on the Qualifier is 0:56 by [[Dean Macey]], and the slowest time was set by \u2018Bouncy\u2019 Jill with 16:44.\n\n===Stage 2===\n====The Sweeper (Series 1\u20132)====\n''The Sweeper'' involves the twelve remaining contestants standing on {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} podiums, over water, while a robotic arm spins around in a circular motion. Before the Sweeper starts, [[Richard Hammond]] tells who is on what podium by naming the podiums from 1\u201312 in order. The contestants have to jump over it, with the arm getting faster and higher in random sections of every rotation. The game continues until a single player remains, but unlike the American version the winner does not receive a prize. The six contestants who are first to fall are eliminated; the rest move on to Dizzy Dummies. In Series 2 the rules were modified so that only the final five advanced instead of six (depending on the next challenge). Series 2 saw modified versions of The Sweeper, including \"The Crusher\" and the addition of Potato Sacks. Claire (Series 2, Episode 4 and Champion of Champions) is the only contestant who has come first in the Sweeper round twice.\n\n====Crash Mountain (Series 3\u20134)====\nSeries 3 introduced a brand new challenge, in the form of ''Crash Mountain''. Crash Mountain involves the twelve remaining contestants standing on 10&nbsp;ft tall podiums over water while three robotic arms swing round in a circular motion. Before Crash Mountain starts, [[Richard Hammond]] will tell who is on what podium by naming the podiums from 1\u201312 in order. 1 arm is designed for the contestants to jump onto to reach the centre of the mountain; the other 2 arms are designed to knock the contestants into the water while spinning in opposite directions. If any contestants falls into the water they must go to any unoccupied podium, climb and attempt it again. Contestants do not have to attempt to reach the mountain on every rotation of the arm. The five who make it to the centre first advance to Dizzy Dummies. Brian (Series 3 Episode 7 and Series 3 Champion of Champions) and James (Series 4 Episode 3 and Series 4 Champion of Champions) were the only 2 people to win Crash Mountain twice.\n\nSeries 4 episode 9 (the Champions of Champions) was the only episode when it was an all-male crash mountain.\n\n====Double Cross (Series 5)====\nIn Series 5, ''Double Cross'' was introduced and is the same as the American version: contestants enter on the three green platforms and exit from the single red one as four sweeper arms come the other way. The fastest six go through to Terror-Go-Round.\n\n====Ski Lift (Winter Wipeout)====\nFor Winter Wipeout, the ''Ski Lift'' is used instead of Double Cross. The ''Ski Lift'' works the same as the American version, which involves the twelve remaining contestants standing on podiums on a \"human merry-go-round\", over water, while two robotic sweeper arms, called the Scary quid Ski-poles, spin around trying to knock them over. The contestants have to use the grab-bars provided to lift themselves over the sweepers, which spin faster and higher in random sections of every rotation. The game continues until a single player remains, but unlike the American version the winner does not receive a prize. The seven contestants who are first to fall are eliminated; the rest move on to the next round \u2013 Winter Blunderland.\n\n===Stage 3===\nIn Series 2\u20133, both Dizzy Dummies and The Dreadmill were used. Either Dizzy Dummies or The Dreadmill was played in each episode for stage 3. The Dreadmill was only used once, in episode 7 of Series 3, but both obstacles were used more equally in the second series.\n\n====Dizzy Dummies (Series 1\u20134)====\n''Dizzy Dummies'' involves two rounds with one contestant being eliminated in each round. The five contestants are strapped onto a \"human merry-go-round\" and spun at speed for 40 seconds. When they are released, the contestants must make their way to the finish line by crossing the obstacles in their way. The challenge has two different routes: round 1 uses the first route, round 2 uses the second. The final contestant in each round to reach the finish line is eliminated. The rest spin again and take part in the next round. Examples of obstacles in Dizzy Dummies include the Tippy Tables, Teeter Totters, Dock Maze, Crazy Beams, Doughnuts and the Barrel Crossing. In Series 3 Dizzy Dummies was upgraded, including the addition of The Spinner (from the American challenge \"Dizzy Dummy 2.0\") and further new obstacles.\n\n====The Dreadmill (Series 2\u20133)====\n''The Dreadmill'' also involves three rounds in which the six semi-finalists are paired up. There are two challenges on the dreadmill, which change from show to show. In the first challenge the participants must stand on two parallel treadmills, and when the klaxon sounds they must duck to avoid a giant swinging wrecking ball, which is being lowered and getting faster with every swing. The first person who falls from The Dreadmill is eliminated. In the second challenge, when the klaxon sounds the contestants must lift three rubber doors to reach the end of The Dreadmill. The last person to reach the end of The Dreadmill, or the first to fall off, is eliminated. In both challenges the dreadmill is going against them, making the challenge even harder. The winners of each of the three heats advance to 'The Wipeout Zone'.\n\n====Terror-Go-Round (Series 5)====\n''Terror-Go-Round'' is the same as the American version except for the name; the American version is called 'The Spinner Round'. Contestants need to keep running while the sweeper arms move and the Terror Twins throw things at them. The game is played over three heats, with the winner of each heat going through to 'The Wipeout Zone'.\n\n====Winter Blunderland (Winter Wipeout)====\nFor Winter Wipeout, ''Winter Blunderland'' is used. The course is the same as the American version; except for the name which is different. The five contestants are strapped onto a \"human merry-go-round\" and spun at speed for 40 seconds (same as Dizzy Dummies). When they are released, the contestants must make their way to the finish line by crossing the obstacles in their way. The obstacles remain the same each week but a different course \"theme\" may be used (Ice Hockey or The Alps for example). The game is played twice and each time the final contestant to reach the finish line is eliminated. The remaining three contestants advance to 'The Wipeout Zone'.\n\n===Final Stage===\n====The Wipeout Zone====\n''The Wipeout Zone'' is the final stage of the competition. The three remaining contestants must complete the \"toughest obstacle course in the world\" in the quickest time possible. The contestant who completes the zone fastest wins the grand prize of \u00a310,000. The Wipeout Zone is made up of five/six obstacles. In later series and Winter Wipeout, the contestant does not have to re-attempt the obstacle if they fall off; they simply swim to the next to save time. After 6 series of Total Wipeout, only 5 episodes have seen a female winner: Rachel of Series 2, Episode 2, [[Danielle Lloyd]] of the second Celebrity Special, Mica of Winter Wipeout Series 1, Episode 5, Kia of Series 5, Episode 3 and Nicola of Series 5, Episode 8.\n\nIn addition, Series 5, Episode 3 was the first episode to feature an all-female Wipeout Zone, whilst in its existence, not a single contestant fell off the Seesaw of Truth\n\n'''Course times'''\n\nThe fastest time of 1:10 on the old Wipeout Zone was set by James (Series 2, Episode 8), and he matched that time in Champions of Champions. The fastest regular contestant time in the new Wipeout Zone was set by both Scott and William with 0:58 albeit during different shows. In the Celebrity Special #8, [[Dalton Grant]] beat the record with 0:54, making him the record holder. The slowest winning time on the Wipeout Zone is 4:53 (set by Steve, Series 1 Episode 2).\n\nThe nine main episodes of Series 4 winning times were 100 seconds or under, with 0:58 being the fastest and 1:40 being the slowest.\n\n'''Winter Wipeout'''\n\nThe winning times have varied for those who competed in ''Winter Wipeout''. The fastest winning time is 1:34 (set by Dan, Episode 8) and the slowest winning time is 4:29 (set by Mica, Episode 5). As for losing times, a new record for the slowest time was set in Episode 5, by Ross who came in with 9:13. The reason for many slow times was down to the \"Impossible Snowflakes\", as out of the 27 people who made it to the Wipeout Zone, only 6 people crossed them.\n\n'''The Course layout'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width: 70%\"\n|-\n!

Although meant to feature all three Wipeout Zone contestants from each heat, no Final has featured all of them.\n\n'''Series 3 & 5'''<br>\nSeries 3 also introduced '''The Legends''' special, which gave competitors from across all the previous series a second chance to reach the Wipeout Zone. A similar special episode, called '''Last Chance Saloon''', featured in Series 5.\n\n'''Series 4'''<br>\nIn Series 4 there has been a '''North vs. South''' Special with individuals from the North and the South of the country to see \"who is better\". Also in Series 4 there was an '''International''' Special in which a handful of British contestants went head-to-head with contestants from around the world as ''Total Wipeout'' went global for the first time, each side captained by a former ''Total Wipeout'' \"legend\".\n\n===''Celebrity Total Wipeout''===\nDuring Total Wipeout's run, celebrity specials have been aired since series 2. The format is slightly different from the original show. There are ten celebrities in each show and all of them compete in both the Qualifier and the following round. After these rounds points are given, with the best performing celebrity scoring ten, and the worst performer receiving one. After the two rounds the points are added up and the five highest scorers progress to Stage 3. In the case of a tie, the celebrity with the faster Qualifier time goes through.\n\n====Contestants====\nThe first episode, which aired on 26 December 2009,<ref name=\"The Sun\">The Sun Xmas Tv Guide, 26 November 2009</ref> featured fitness expert [[Kevin Adams]], ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'' professional dancers [[James Jordan (dancer)|James]] and [[Ola Jordan]], actor [[Luke Bailey (actor)|Luke Bailey]], ''[[I'm a Celebrity\u2026Get Me Out of Here!

Most games are almost identical to the originals, and most games and a few obstacles retain their American names. Differences are relatively minor, but are as follows:\n\n===The Qualifier===\n: The course is almost identical to the US version, albeit with a slightly smaller selection of obstacles to end the course. The main difference is that whereas the US show begins with 24 contestants, ''Total Wipeout'' begins with 20, though in both versions 12 progress to the second round.\n\n===The Sweeper===\n: The UK version used the \"classic\" version of The Sweeper in series 1 and some episodes in series 2, as well as \"The Crusher\" and the Sacks variation, in the other episodes of the second series. The UK version reduces the players from 12 to 5 or 6 (depending on whether the next round is Dizzy Dummies or The Dreadmill), and then continues until one player remains. However, the US version sounds a siren when the \"elimination\" part of the game is over, and offers a $1,000 bonus prize to the winner. The UK version does neither, with commentary often mocking the fact that players may well be unaware that they need not continue, and that they are putting such effort into something that offers no reward. The round is continued in the UK version to see who is the 'last man standing'. In celebrity editions a player's ranking (first to last to fall) in this round counts towards their points score.\n\n===Dizzy Dummies===\n: The courses and obstacles are identical to the US version, but the format of the round differs. In the US version, the round is played 4 times, with the winner of each round automatically winning a place in the Wipeout Zone, and thus taking no further part in Dizzy Dummies. In the UK, it is played 2 times, with the last person to complete the course eliminated. Thus, the finalists for the UK version are not decided until the last Dizzy Dummies round is complete. This process also means that the UK show has 3 contestants in the Wipeout Zone, rather than the US version's 4. As of Series 2, Dizzy Dummies was often replaced by \"The Dreadmill\", in which two contestants battle to keep up with an industrial sized treadmill, while trying to avoid wrecking balls trying to knock them off.\n\n===The Dreadmill===\n: In the US version, there is only one Dreadmill, but in the UK version, there are two; because of that, the format differs. In the Wrecking Ball variation, the contestants had to stay on as long as they could, but unlike the US version, the contestant that wipes out on the Dreadmill gets eliminated from the competition. In the Doors variation, the UK version doesn't use tennis balls. The pit that contestants wipe out on is always a pool of water, unlike the Single Dreadmill where the pit changes (e.g. pit of flour and foam pieces).\n\n===The Wipeout Zone===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}\n:The course is almost identical, albeit with the UK only ever using the \"waterfall\" version of the WaterWall obstacle, never the \"Waterjet\" version. The US version's 4-part \"Launch Pads\" section is changed to the \"rolling beam\", followed by two Launch Pads. Finally, US contestants hear a horn when their time exceeds that of a previous contestant, whereas UK contestants are not told of their opponents' times until after they complete the course. One significant change in the rules to the US version is that if a contestant wipes out on an obstacle in the Zone, they have to go back to the start of that obstacle and re-attempt it until they clear it but in Season 7 the contestants are now allowed to skip the obstacle once they fall of like on ''Total Wipeout'' (since series 2) they swim on to the start of the next obstacle like in the Qualifier.\n\n:As a publicly funded broadcaster, large prizes are extremely rare on BBC gameshows. As such, the prize money is relatively low at \u00a310,000 (plus a trophy), though this is tax-free, as are all UK gameshow prizes. US winners receive $50,000 (approx \u00a330,000).\n\n===General===\n:In presentation, the major difference is the use of one commentator (Hammond), rather than two. Also, contestants are referred to by first name only, with much greater use of nicknames. The show retains the gentle mockery of the contestants, although the style of humour is generally drier than the US version. Although the courses are near-identical, the US courses are in California, while the UK version is filmed on the \"international\" ''Wipeout'' set in Argentina, along with the other non-US versions of the show. The commentary makes great use of this fact, referencing the location constantly, and often gently mocking contestants for having travelled so far to take part.\n\n:The slight change to the show's name is to differentiate it from an earlier BBC gameshow named ''[[Wipeout (UK game show)|Wipeout]]'', hosted by [[Paul Daniels]], and later [[Bob Monkhouse]].\n\n==''Total Wipeout'' episodes==\n{{main|List of Total Wipeout episodes}}\n\n===Series 1 (2009)===\nSeries 1 contained eight episodes, airing from 3 January to 21 March 2009.

Each week, 20 contestants compete in a series of challenges in an attempt to win \u00a310,000. These challenges were based in large pools of water or mud and generally involved large [[assault course]]s that participants had to cross. The 20 contestants are narrowed down to 12, then to either 6 or 5, with the final 3 progressing to the Wipeout Zone.\n\n''Total Wipeout'' was a licensed version of ''[[Wipeout (2008 U.S. game show)|Wipeout]]'', the [[Endemol]] show that originated in the United States in 2008, with the name slightly altered to avoid confusion with the BBC version of the [[Wipeout (UK game show)|earlier game show of the same name]].\n\nOn 29 March 2012, the BBC confirmed that they would axe ''Total Wipeout'' after its sixth series.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sweney|first=Mark|title=Total Wipeout dropped by BBC1|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/mar/29/total-wipeout-dropped-bbc1?newsfeed=true|newspaper=Guardian|date=29 March 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2122176/Total-Wipeout-axed-series-served-purpose.html?ito=feeds-newsxml BBC show Total Wipeout axed after six series after it had 'served its purpose']</ref> The remaining 10 episodes from Series 5 began airing on 18 August 2012\n\n==Format==\nThe show is hosted by [[Richard Hammond]], who commentates as the contestants attempt to complete the challenges. He is also seen in a studio to provide certain links within the show. Although the main footage was filmed in Buenos Aires, Argentina,<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00gvnn8 |title=BBC One \u2013 Total Wipeout, Series 1 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2012-06-30 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref> Hammond recorded his sections from a studio in England. Meanwhile, [[Amanda Byram]] interviewed the contestants during the show and remained on the sidelines as they made their way through the course.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00gmmv8|title=BBC One Programmes \u2013 Total Wipeout, Episode 1}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{Main|List of Total Wipeout obstacles}}During ''Total Wipeout'' contestants are put through a series of obstacle courses and challenges. After each challenge a certain number of them are eliminated from the competition. After the fourth and final round the fastest of the remaining three competitors around the course wins the game and the cash prize. The eliminated contestants can be seen sitting at the side during later challenges.\n\n===Stage 1===\n====The Qualifier====\n''The Qualifier'' involves twenty contestants attempting to complete a short obstacle course in the least time possible; the eight contestants with the slowest times are eliminated, with the fastest twelve advancing to either The Sweeper or Crash Mountain or Double Cross. The Qualifier contains the dominant Sucker Punch and Big Balls. The first and last obstacles change every week, however the first obstacle is always set over a pool of water or mud, and the final obstacle is always a 'swing' to the goal. 52 contenders in the show's history have conquered the Big Balls, declared by Hammond as the hardest Wipeout obstacle ever. Those are: Jo and Carole (Series 1, Episode 5), Kierron (Series 1, Episode 7), Alice (Series 2, Episode 2), Alex (Series 2, Episode 6), Eliza, Julian and Victoria (Series 2, Episode 8), Chris and Katie(Series 2, \"Champion of Champions\"), Paul and Nix (Series 3, Episode 2), Colm, Nic, Ed and Becky (Series 3, Episode 6), Junior and Andy (Series 3, \"Champion of Champions\"), [[Jason King (radio)|Jason King]] and [[Sarah Cawood]] (Series 3, \"Celebrity Special #2\"), Liam (Series 4, Episode 1), Andy (Series 4, Episode 3 and Champion of Champions), Katie (Series 4, Episode 5), Fran (Series 4, Episode 6), Tamara (Series 4, Episode 7) Scott, Frankie, Mikey and James (Series 4, \"Champion of Champions\"), [[Chris Simmons]] (Series 4, \"Celebrity Special #1\"), [[Dean Macey]] (Series 4 \"Celebrity Special #2\"), Marina (Winter Wipeout, Episode 1), Dan (Winter Wipeout, Episode 3 and Champion of Champions), Lawrence (Winter Wipeout, Episode 6), John W (Winter Wipeout, Episode 6 and Champion of Champions), Tom (Winter Wipeout, Episode 7) Edward (Winter Wipeout, Episode 8), Jon, Helen, Mikey, John C, and John W (Winter Wipeout, \"Champion of Champions\"), [[Nicola McLean]] (Series 5, \"Celebrity Special #1\"), [[Clare Nasir]] (Series 5, \"Celebrity Special #2),  Becky and Amanda (Series 5 Episode 1), Ron (Series 5, Episode 4) William and Helene (Series 5 Episode 7), Amy, Ellen and Liam (Series 5 Episode 8), and Ashley, (Series 5 \"Champion of Champions).  Only 7 contestants; Kierron (Series 1, Episode 7), Becky and Ed (Series 3, Episode 6), Junior (Series 3, \"Champion of Champions\"), James (Series 4, \"Champion of Champions\"), [[Chris Simmons]] (Series 4, \"Champion of Champions\") and William (Series 5, Episode 7) have not fallen off any obstacle during the Qualifier.\n\nAs of August 2012, the fastest time on the Qualifier is 0:56 by [[Dean Macey]], and the slowest time was set by \u2018Bouncy\u2019 Jill with 16:44.\n\n===Stage 2===\n====The Sweeper (Series 1\u20132)====\n''The Sweeper'' involves the twelve remaining contestants standing on {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} podiums, over water, while a robotic arm spins around in a circular motion. Before the Sweeper starts, [[Richard Hammond]] tells who is on what podium by naming the podiums from 1\u201312 in order. The contestants have to jump over it, with the arm getting faster and higher in random sections of every rotation. The game continues until a single player remains, but unlike the American version the winner does not receive a prize. The six contestants who are first to fall are eliminated; the rest move on to Dizzy Dummies. In Series 2 the rules were modified so that only the final five advanced instead of six (depending on the next challenge). Series 2 saw modified versions of The Sweeper, including \"The Crusher\" and the addition of Potato Sacks. Claire (Series 2, Episode 4 and Champion of Champions) is the only contestant who has come first in the Sweeper round twice.\n\n====Crash Mountain (Series 3\u20134)====\nSeries 3 introduced a brand new challenge, in the form of ''Crash Mountain''. Crash Mountain involves the twelve remaining contestants standing on 10&nbsp;ft tall podiums over water while three robotic arms swing round in a circular motion. Before Crash Mountain starts, [[Richard Hammond]] will tell who is on what podium by naming the podiums from 1\u201312 in order. 1 arm is designed for the contestants to jump onto to reach the centre of the mountain; the other 2 arms are designed to knock the contestants into the water while spinning in opposite directions. If any contestants falls into the water they must go to any unoccupied podium, climb and attempt it again. Contestants do not have to attempt to reach the mountain on every rotation of the arm. The five who make it to the centre first advance to Dizzy Dummies. Brian (Series 3 Episode 7 and Series 3 Champion of Champions) and James (Series 4 Episode 3 and Series 4 Champion of Champions) were the only 2 people to win Crash Mountain twice.\n\nSeries 4 episode 9 (the Champions of Champions) was the only episode when it was an all-male crash mountain.\n\n====Double Cross (Series 5)====\nIn Series 5, ''Double Cross'' was introduced and is the same as the American version: contestants enter on the three green platforms and exit from the single red one as four sweeper arms come the other way. The fastest six go through to Terror-Go-Round.\n\n====Ski Lift (Winter Wipeout)====\nFor Winter Wipeout, the ''Ski Lift'' is used instead of Double Cross. The ''Ski Lift'' works the same as the American version, which involves the twelve remaining contestants standing on podiums on a \"human merry-go-round\", over water, while two robotic sweeper arms, called the Scary quid Ski-poles, spin around trying to knock them over. The contestants have to use the grab-bars provided to lift themselves over the sweepers, which spin faster and higher in random sections of every rotation. The game continues until a single player remains, but unlike the American version the winner does not receive a prize. The seven contestants who are first to fall are eliminated; the rest move on to the next round \u2013 Winter Blunderland.\n\n===Stage 3===\nIn Series 2\u20133, both Dizzy Dummies and The Dreadmill were used. Either Dizzy Dummies or The Dreadmill was played in each episode for stage 3. The Dreadmill was only used once, in episode 7 of Series 3, but both obstacles were used more equally in the second series.\n\n====Dizzy Dummies (Series 1\u20134)====\n''Dizzy Dummies'' involves two rounds with one contestant being eliminated in each round. The five contestants are strapped onto a \"human merry-go-round\" and spun at speed for 40 seconds. When they are released, the contestants must make their way to the finish line by crossing the obstacles in their way. The challenge has two different routes: round 1 uses the first route, round 2 uses the second. The final contestant in each round to reach the finish line is eliminated. The rest spin again and take part in the next round. Examples of obstacles in Dizzy Dummies include the Tippy Tables, Teeter Totters, Dock Maze, Crazy Beams, Doughnuts and the Barrel Crossing. In Series 3 Dizzy Dummies was upgraded, including the addition of The Spinner (from the American challenge \"Dizzy Dummy 2.0\") and further new obstacles.\n\n====The Dreadmill (Series 2\u20133)====\n''The Dreadmill'' also involves three rounds in which the six semi-finalists are paired up. There are two challenges on the dreadmill, which change from show to show. In the first challenge the participants must stand on two parallel treadmills, and when the klaxon sounds they must duck to avoid a giant swinging wrecking ball, which is being lowered and getting faster with every swing. The first person who falls from The Dreadmill is eliminated. In the second challenge, when the klaxon sounds the contestants must lift three rubber doors to reach the end of The Dreadmill. The last person to reach the end of The Dreadmill, or the first to fall off, is eliminated. In both challenges the dreadmill is going against them, making the challenge even harder. The winners of each of the three heats advance to 'The Wipeout Zone'.\n\n====Terror-Go-Round (Series 5)====\n''Terror-Go-Round'' is the same as the American version except for the name; the American version is called 'The Spinner Round'. Contestants need to keep running while the sweeper arms move and the Terror Twins throw things at them. The game is played over three heats, with the winner of each heat going through to 'The Wipeout Zone'.\n\n====Winter Blunderland (Winter Wipeout)====\nFor Winter Wipeout, ''Winter Blunderland'' is used. The course is the same as the American version; except for the name which is different. The five contestants are strapped onto a \"human merry-go-round\" and spun at speed for 40 seconds (same as Dizzy Dummies). When they are released, the contestants must make their way to the finish line by crossing the obstacles in their way. The obstacles remain the same each week but a different course \"theme\" may be used (Ice Hockey or The Alps for example). The game is played twice and each time the final contestant to reach the finish line is eliminated. The remaining three contestants advance to 'The Wipeout Zone'.\n\n===Final Stage===\n====The Wipeout Zone====\n''The Wipeout Zone'' is the final stage of the competition. The three remaining contestants must complete the \"toughest obstacle course in the world\" in the quickest time possible. The contestant who completes the zone fastest wins the grand prize of \u00a310,000. The Wipeout Zone is made up of five/six obstacles. In later series and Winter Wipeout, the contestant does not have to re-attempt the obstacle if they fall off; they simply swim to the next to save time. After 6 series of Total Wipeout, only 5 episodes have seen a female winner: Rachel of Series 2, Episode 2, [[Danielle Lloyd]] of the second Celebrity Special, Mica of Winter Wipeout Series 1, Episode 5, Kia of Series 5, Episode 3 and Nicola of Series 5, Episode 8.\n\nIn addition, Series 5, Episode 3 was the first episode to feature an all-female Wipeout Zone, whilst in its existence, not a single contestant fell off the Seesaw of Truth\n\n'''Course times'''\n\nThe fastest time of 1:10 on the old Wipeout Zone was set by James (Series 2, Episode 8), and he matched that time in Champions of Champions. The fastest regular contestant time in the new Wipeout Zone was set by both Scott and William with 0:58 albeit during different shows. In the Celebrity Special #8, [[Dalton Grant]] beat the record with 0:54, making him the record holder. The slowest winning time on the Wipeout Zone is 4:53 (set by Steve, Series 1 Episode 2).\n\nThe nine main episodes of Series 4 winning times were 100 seconds or under, with 0:58 being the fastest and 1:40 being the slowest.\n\n'''Winter Wipeout'''\n\nThe winning times have varied for those who competed in ''Winter Wipeout''. The fastest winning time is 1:34 (set by Dan, Episode 8) and the slowest winning time is 4:29 (set by Mica, Episode 5). As for losing times, a new record for the slowest time was set in Episode 5, by Ross who came in with 9:13. The reason for many slow times was down to the \"Impossible Snowflakes\", as out of the 27 people who made it to the Wipeout Zone, only 6 people crossed them.\n\n'''The Course layout'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width: 70%\"\n|-\n!

Although meant to feature all three Wipeout Zone contestants from each heat, no Final has featured all of them.\n\n'''Series 3 & 5'''<br>\nSeries 3 also introduced '''The Legends''' special, which gave competitors from across all the previous series a second chance to reach the Wipeout Zone. A similar special episode, called '''Last Chance Saloon''', featured in Series 5.\n\n'''Series 4'''<br>\nIn Series 4 there has been a '''North vs. South''' Special with individuals from the North and the South of the country to see \"who is better\". Also in Series 4 there was an '''International''' Special in which a handful of British contestants went head-to-head with contestants from around the world as ''Total Wipeout'' went global for the first time, each side captained by a former ''Total Wipeout'' \"legend\".\n\n===''Celebrity Total Wipeout''===\nDuring Total Wipeout's run, celebrity specials have been aired since series 2. The format is slightly different from the original show. There are ten celebrities in each show and all of them compete in both the Qualifier and the following round. After these rounds points are given, with the best performing celebrity scoring ten, and the worst performer receiving one. After the two rounds the points are added up and the five highest scorers progress to Stage 3. In the case of a tie, the celebrity with the faster Qualifier time goes through.\n\n====Contestants====\nThe first episode, which aired on 26 December 2009,<ref name=\"The Sun\">The Sun Xmas Tv Guide, 26 November 2009</ref> featured fitness expert [[Kevin Adams]], ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'' professional dancers [[James Jordan (dancer)|James]] and [[Ola Jordan]], actor [[Luke Bailey (actor)|Luke Bailey]], ''[[I'm a Celebrity\u2026Get Me Out of Here!

Most games are almost identical to the originals, and most games and a few obstacles retain their American names. Differences are relatively minor, but are as follows:\n\n===The Qualifier===\n: The course is almost identical to the US version, albeit with a slightly smaller selection of obstacles to end the course. The main difference is that whereas the US show begins with 24 contestants, ''Total Wipeout'' begins with 20, though in both versions 12 progress to the second round.\n\n===The Sweeper===\n: The UK version used the \"classic\" version of The Sweeper in series 1 and some episodes in series 2, as well as \"The Crusher\" and the Sacks variation, in the other episodes of the second series. The UK version reduces the players from 12 to 5 or 6 (depending on whether the next round is Dizzy Dummies or The Dreadmill), and then continues until one player remains. However, the US version sounds a siren when the \"elimination\" part of the game is over, and offers a $1,000 bonus prize to the winner. The UK version does neither, with commentary often mocking the fact that players may well be unaware that they need not continue, and that they are putting such effort into something that offers no reward. The round is continued in the UK version to see who is the 'last man standing'. In celebrity editions a player's ranking (first to last to fall) in this round counts towards their points score.\n\n===Dizzy Dummies===\n: The courses and obstacles are identical to the US version, but the format of the round differs. In the US version, the round is played 4 times, with the winner of each round automatically winning a place in the Wipeout Zone, and thus taking no further part in Dizzy Dummies. In the UK, it is played 2 times, with the last person to complete the course eliminated. Thus, the finalists for the UK version are not decided until the last Dizzy Dummies round is complete. This process also means that the UK show has 3 contestants in the Wipeout Zone, rather than the US version's 4. As of Series 2, Dizzy Dummies was often replaced by \"The Dreadmill\", in which two contestants battle to keep up with an industrial sized treadmill, while trying to avoid wrecking balls trying to knock them off.\n\n===The Dreadmill===\n: In the US version, there is only one Dreadmill, but in the UK version, there are two; because of that, the format differs. In the Wrecking Ball variation, the contestants had to stay on as long as they could, but unlike the US version, the contestant that wipes out on the Dreadmill gets eliminated from the competition. In the Doors variation, the UK version doesn't use tennis balls. The pit that contestants wipe out on is always a pool of water, unlike the Single Dreadmill where the pit changes (e.g. pit of flour and foam pieces).\n\n===The Wipeout Zone===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}\n:The course is almost identical, albeit with the UK only ever using the \"waterfall\" version of the WaterWall obstacle, never the \"Waterjet\" version. The US version's 4-part \"Launch Pads\" section is changed to the \"rolling beam\", followed by two Launch Pads. Finally, US contestants hear a horn when their time exceeds that of a previous contestant, whereas UK contestants are not told of their opponents' times until after they complete the course. One significant change in the rules to the US version is that if a contestant wipes out on an obstacle in the Zone, they have to go back to the start of that obstacle and re-attempt it until they clear it but in Season 7 the contestants are now allowed to skip the obstacle once they fall of like on ''Total Wipeout'' (since series 2) they swim on to the start of the next obstacle like in the Qualifier.\n\n:As a publicly funded broadcaster, large prizes are extremely rare on BBC gameshows. As such, the prize money is relatively low at \u00a310,000 (plus a trophy), though this is tax-free, as are all UK gameshow prizes. US winners receive $50,000 (approx \u00a330,000).\n\n===General===\n:In presentation, the major difference is the use of one commentator (Hammond), rather than two. Also, contestants are referred to by first name only, with much greater use of nicknames. The show retains the gentle mockery of the contestants, although the style of humour is generally drier than the US version. Although the courses are near-identical, the US courses are in California, while the UK version is filmed on the \"international\" ''Wipeout'' set in Argentina, along with the other non-US versions of the show. The commentary makes great use of this fact, referencing the location constantly, and often gently mocking contestants for having travelled so far to take part.\n\n:The slight change to the show's name is to differentiate it from an earlier BBC gameshow named ''[[Wipeout (UK game show)|Wipeout]]'', hosted by [[Paul Daniels]], and later [[Bob Monkhouse]].\n\n==''Total Wipeout'' episodes==\n{{main|List of Total Wipeout episodes}}\n\n===Series 1 (2009)===\nSeries 1 contained eight episodes, airing from 3 January to 21 March 2009.

The committee was founded by four women known as the \"Washington Wives\" \u2013 a reference to their husbands' connections with government in the Washington, D.C. area. The women who founded the PMRC are [[Tipper Gore]], wife of [[United States Senate|Senator]] and later [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Al Gore]]; Susan Baker, wife of [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[James Baker]]; Pam Howar, wife of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] realtor Raymond Howar; and Sally Nevius, wife of former [[Council of the District of Columbia|Washington City Council]] Chairman [[John Nevius]]. The PMRC eventually grew to include 22 participants before shutting down in the mid-to-late 1990s.\n\n== Actions ==\nAs a method of combating this alleged problem, the PMRC suggested a voluntary move by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] and the music industry to develop music labeling in the form of a rating system similar to the [[Motion_Picture_Association_of_America_film_rating_system| film rating system]] developed by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]].<ref>Deflem, Mathieu. 2020.

Before the labels could be put into place, the [[United States Senate|Senate]] agreed to hold a hearing on so-called \"porn rock\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joesapt.net/superlink/shrg99-529/|title=RECORD LABELING|author=|date=|website=www.joesapt.net|accessdate=March 10, 2019}}</ref> The hearing was held on September 19, 1985, when representatives from the PMRC, three musicians \u2014[[Dee Snider]], [[Frank Zappa]], [[John Denver]]\u2014 and Senators [[Paula Hawkins]], [[Al Gore]], and others testified before the [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee]] on \"the subject of the content of certain sound recordings and suggestions that recording packages be labeled to provide a warning to prospective purchasers of sexually explicit or other potentially offensive content.\"<ref>[[United States Senate]] (1985): [http://www.joesapt.net/superlink/shrg99-529/ Record Labeling: Hearing before the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation]. United States Senate, Ninety-ninth Congress, First Session on Contents of Music and the Lyrics of Records (September 19, 1985). Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office.</ref>\n\n=== Supporting witnesses ===\n[[Paula Hawkins]] presented three record covers (''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]'' by [[Def Leppard]], ''[[WOW (Wendy O. Williams album)|W.O.W.]]'' by [[Wendy O. Williams]] and  ''[[W.A.S.P. (album)|W.A.S.P.]]'' by [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]]) and the music videos for \"[[Hot for Teacher]]\" by [[Van Halen]], and \"[[We're Not Gonna Take It (Twisted Sister song)|We're Not Gonna Take It]]\" by [[Twisted Sister]], commenting: \"Much has changed since Elvis' seemingly innocent times. Subtleties, suggestions, and innuendo have given way to overt expressions and descriptions of often violent sexual acts, drug taking, and flirtations with the occult. The record album covers to me are self-explanatory.\"\n\nSusan Baker testified that \"There certainly are many causes for these ills in our society, but it is our contention that the pervasive messages aimed at children which promote and glorify suicide, rape, sadomasochism, and so on, have to be numbered among the contributing factors.\" Tipper Gore asked record companies to voluntarily \"plac[e] a warning label on music products inappropriate for younger children due to explicit sexual or violent lyrics.\"\n\nNational PTA Vice President for Legislative Activity Millie Waterman related the PTA's role in the debate, and proposed printing the symbol \"R\" on the cover of recordings containing \"explicit sexual language, violence, profanity, the occult and glorification of drugs and alcohol\", and providing lyrics for \"R\"-labeled albums.\n\nIn addition, Dr. Joe Stuessy, a music professor at the [[University of Texas at San Antonio]], spoke regarding the power of music to influence behavior. He argued that heavy metal was different from earlier forms of music such as [[jazz]] and [[rock and roll]] because it was \"church music\" and \"had as one of its central elements the element of hatred.\" Dr. Paul King, a child and adolescent [[psychiatrist]], testified on the deification of heavy metal musicians, and to the presentation of heavy metal as a religion. He also stated that \"many\" adolescents read deeply into song lyrics.\n\n=== Opposing witnesses ===\nDuring his statement, musician and [[record producer|producer]] [[Frank Zappa]] asserted that \"the PMRC proposal is an ill-conceived piece of nonsense which fails to deliver any real benefits to children, infringes the civil liberties of people who are not children, and promises to keep the courts busy for years dealing with the interpretation and enforcement problems inherent in the proposal's design.\" He went on to state his suspicion that the hearings were a front for H.R. 2911, a proposed [[private copying levy|blank tape tax]]: \"The major record labels need to have H.R. 2911 whiz through a few committees before anybody smells a rat. One of them is chaired by [[Strom Thurmond|Senator Thurmond]]. Is it a coincidence that Mrs. Thurmond is affiliated with the PMRC?\" Zappa had earlier stated about the Senate's agreement to hold a hearing on the matter that \"A couple of [[blowjob]]s here and there and Bingo!\u2014you get a hearing.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lyons |first=Steve |author2=Batya Friedman |title=Winter in America |publisher=[[Option (music magazine)|Option]] |date=January\u2013February 1987 |url=http://www.afka.net/articles/1987-01_Option.htm |accessdate=2014-07-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227060044/http://www.afka.net/Articles/1987-01_Option.htm |archive-date=February 27, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[Folk rock]] musician [[John Denver]] stated he was \"strongly opposed to censorship of any kind in our society or anywhere else in the world\", and that in his experience censors often misinterpret music, as was the case with his song \"[[Rocky Mountain High]]\". In addition, Denver expressed his belief that censorship is counterproductive: \"That which is denied becomes that which is most desired, and that which is hidden becomes that which is most interesting. Consequently, a great deal of time and energy is spent trying to get at what is being kept from you.\" When Denver came up to give his speech, many on the PMRC board expected him to side with them, thinking he would be offended by the lyrics as well.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n[[Dee Snider]], [[frontman]] and [[lead singer]] of the [[metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Twisted Sister]], testified that he \"[did] not support ... [RIAA president] Gortikov's unnecessary and unfortunate decision to agree to a so-called generic label on some selected records\".<ref>Snider's testimony is also available [http://www.vh1.com/artists/interview/1456097/07152002/twisted_sister.jhtml at VH1].</ref> Like John Denver, Snider felt that his music had been misinterpreted. He defended the Twisted Sister songs \"[[Under the Blade (song)|Under the Blade]]\", which had been interpreted as referring to [[sadomasochism]], [[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], and rape, and \"[[We're Not Gonna Take It (Twisted Sister song)|We're Not Gonna Take It]]\", which had been accused of promoting violence. Snider said about \"Under the Blade\", a song Snider claimed was written about an impending surgery, that \"the only sadomasochism, bondage, and rape in this song is in the mind of Ms. Gore.\" He stated \"Ms. Gore was looking for sadomasochism and bondage, and she found it. Someone looking for surgical references would have found it as well.\" Snider concluded that \"The full responsibility for defending my children falls on the shoulders of my wife and I, because there is no one else capable of making these judgments for us.\"\n\nNotable snippets of audio from the hearing found their way into Zappa's audiocollage \"Porn Wars\", released on the ''[[Frank Zappa Meets the Mothers of Prevention]]'' album. Senators [[Al Gore|Gore]], [[Fritz Hollings|Hollings]], [[Slade Gorton|Gorton]], [[Paula Hawkins|Hawkins]], and others appeared. The album cover featured a parody of the RIAA warning label. The [[Gramophone record|LP]] included a note to listeners to send to Zappa's [[Barking Pumpkin Records]] for a free  ''Z-PAC'', a printed information package that included transcripts of the committee hearing, and a letter from Zappa encouraging young people to register to vote. Zappa's full testimonial was released on a posthumous 2010 compilation called ''[[Congress Shall Make No Law...]]''\n\n== Parental Advisory sticker ==\n{{main|Parental Advisory}}\nOn November 1, 1985, before the hearing ended, the [[RIAA]] agreed to put \"[[Parental Advisory]]\" labels on selected releases at their own discretion. The labels were generic, unlike the original idea of a descriptive label categorizing the explicit lyrics.\n\nMany record stores refused to sell albums containing the label (most notably [[Wal-Mart]]), and others limited sales of those albums to adults.  One of the albums to receive the \"Parental Advisory\" sticker was Frank Zappa's Grammy-winning album ''[[Jazz from Hell]]'', presumably for the use of the word \"Hell\" in its title but also for the song \"[[G-Spot Tornado]]\", even though it is a collection of instrumental pieces and contains no lyrics at all.\n\nIt is uncertain whether the \"Tipper sticker\" is effective in preventing children from being exposed to explicit content.<ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/2010641.stm |work=BBC News |title=Spotlight on explicit lyrics warning |date=2002-05-27 |access-date=May 21, 2010}}</ref> Some, citing the \"[[Forbidden fruit|forbidden-fruit effect]]\", suggest that the sticker in fact increases record sales. [[Philip Bailey]] of [[Earth, Wind & Fire]] said that \"for the most part [the sticker] might even sell more records in some areas - all you've got to do is tell somebody this is a no-no and then that's what they want to go see.\"<ref name=\"bbc\" /> [[Ice-T]]'s track \"Freedom of Speech\" contains the lyrics: \"Hey, PMRC, you stupid fuckin' assholes/The sticker on the record is what makes 'em sell gold./Can't you see, you alcoholic idiots/The more you try to suppress us, the larger we get.\" While lyrics from the [[Furnaceface]] song \"We Love You, Tipper Gore\", from their 1991 album ''Just Buy It'', suggest that the label \"only whets my appetite ... only makes us want to hear it that much more\".\n\n== Musician reaction ==\nMany musicians have criticized or parodied the PMRC and Tipper Gore:\n* \"In a world with major pollution and guns ablaze\", [[John Lydon]] marveled, \"they have to pick on someone using foul language.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Neely |first=Kim |date=9 August 1990 |title=Rockers sound off |magazine=Billboard |pages=27\u201328}}</ref>\n* In 1987, the punk rock band [[NOFX]] released an EP titled ''[[The P.M.R.C.

This is still one of the only songs about<ref name=\"Big Brother\" /> Tipper Gore and the PMRC to reach a wide audience.\n* Some prints of [[Metallica]]'s album ''[[Master of Puppets]]'' contained a [[parody]] warning, shaped like a stop sign, that read \"THE ONLY TRACK YOU PROBABLY WON'T WANT TO PLAY IS \"DAMAGE, INC.\" DUE TO MULTIPLE USE OF THE INFAMOUS \"F\" WORD. OTHERWISE, THERE AREN'T ANY \"S...S,\" \"F..KS,\" \"P.SSES,\" \"C.NTS,\" \"MOTHERF...ERS\" OR \"C.CKS...ERS\" ANYWHERE ON THIS RECORD.\" This also references [[George Carlin]]'s \"[[seven dirty words]]\" routine by mentioning six of them.<ref>https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-03-03-25-things-you-might-not-know-about-metallicas-master-of-puppets/</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.feelnumb.com/2012/07/03/metallica-master-of-puppets-vulgar-warning-sticker/|title=Metallica \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d Vulgar Warning Sticker|first=|last=raul|date=July 4, 2012|website=feelnumb.com|access-date=March 10, 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Flotsam and Jetsam (band)|Flotsam and Jetsam]]'s song \"Hard on You\" (from their 1988 album ''[[No Place for Disgrace]]'') is a direct reference to the PMRC, with several lines such as \"One that's young sees the circled 'R', does he buy it?\", \"Can't you see, you're ripping away our independence\" and \"If your committee is so damn right, why did we write this song?\".\n* The [[Megadeth]] song \"Hook In Mouth\" from their 1988 album ''[[So Far, So Good...

Just Watch What You Say!]]'' contains many criticisms of the PMRC. One song in particular, \"Freedom of Speech\", is an extended attack on Tipper Gore:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nYo, Tip, what's the matter? You ain't gettin' no dick?\nYou're bitchin' about rock 'n' roll\u2014that's censorship, dumb bitch\nThe Constitution says we all got a right to speak\nSay what we want, Tip\u2014your argument is weak\n</poem></blockquote>\n\n:In his book ''The Ice Opinion'', Ice-T wrote \"Tipper Gore is the only woman I ever directly called a bitch on any of my records, and I meant that in the most negative sense of the word.\"<ref>Ice-T: ''The Ice Opinion'', p. 98.</ref> On \"You Shoulda Killed Me Last Year\", his spoken-word outro to his album ''[[O.G.

Bush]], and [[Tipper Gore]].\n* One of the bonus tracks on [[Warrant (American band)|Warrant]]'s 1990 album ''[[Cherry Pie (album)|Cherry Pie]]'', titled \"Ode to Tipper Gore\", is a montage of short audio clips from various live performances by the band, featuring ample use of expletives and obscene language.\n* The liner notes of [[Sonic Youth]]'s 1990 album ''[[Goo (album)|Goo]]'' include a cartoon with the caption \"SMASH THE PMRC.\"<ref>http://www.sonicyouth.com/mustang/lp/lp08h.jpg</ref>\n* The cover art for the 1990 [[PDQ Bach]] album ''[[Oedipus Tex and Other Choral Calamities]]'' features a \"Pathetic Advisory: Inane Lyrics\" warning label.\n* Cinderella referenced the PMRC in their song \"Shelter Me\" (from their ''[[Heartbreak Station]]'' album) with the lines \"Tipper led the war against the record industry, she said she saw the devil on her MTV\".\n* The 1990 [[Dead Milkmen]] song \"Do the Brown Nose\" includes the lyrics ''You, yes you, here's a dime, run out and call the PMRC.''\n* On July 18, 1993, [[Rage Against the Machine]] protested against the PMRC at [[Lollapalooza]] III by standing naked onstage with [[duct tape]] covering their mouths and the letters PMRC on their chests. The band used up their 14-minute performance time without playing any songs. The only sound emitted was [[audio feedback]] from [[Tom Morello]] and [[Tim Commerford]]'s guitars.<ref name=\"moderndrummer\">Micallef, Ken (March 1996), [http://www.musicfanclubs.org/rage/articles/drummer.htm Rage Against The Machine's Brad Wilk], ''[[Modern Drummer]].''

This song ridicules the members of the PMRC.\n* Punk rock band [[The Ramones]] recorded for their 1992 album ''[[Mondo Bizarro]]'' the song \"Censorshit\" about how rock and rap albums were being censored by the PMRC. It mentions [[Frank Zappa]] and [[Ozzy Osbourne]], and is addressed to [[Tipper Gore]].\n* The 1997 Canadian punk band [[Reset (Canadian band)|Reset]]'s album ''No Worries'' features a track titled \"Go Away\", which is entirely about their disapproval of the PMRC and Tipper Gore, with one line directly naming Gore.\n\n<blockquote>\nTipper, won't you understand the message that I want to say<br />\nIt's kind of rude but here it goes: it's \"fuck you!\"<br />\nI don't like what you do, and I don't like you.\n</blockquote>\n* On the 2001 [[Dead Kennedys]] live album ''[[Mutiny on the Bay]]'' (recorded in a 1986 concert), during their song \"M.T.V. - Get off the Air\", lead singer [[Jello Biafra]] tells the audience to \"buy a homemade [record] instead, before the PMRC closes the stores down that sell 'em.\" Biafra had earlier been brought to trial on charges of \"distributing harmful matter to minors\" in an incident involving the 1985 Dead Kennedys's album ''[[Frankenchrist]]'', which featured an insert of [[H. R. Giger]]'s ''[[Penis Landscape]]'' and a parody sticker on the front cover reading:\n<blockquote>WARNING: The inside fold out to this record cover is a work of art by H.R.

It is also worth pointing out that Eminem's reference to burning the flag was censored {{citation needed|date=July 2017}} on the album release, which added a twist of irony to his claims here.\n* [[Suicidal Tendencies]] referenced Tipper Gore in their song \"Lovely\" from the album ''[[Lights...Camera...Revolution!]]'': \"Tipper, babe, don't you remember me/Now I'm kinder, gentler, and so happy\".\n* [[Harry and the Potters]] reference Tipper Gore and the PMRC in the title track of their album ''[[Voldemort Can't Stop the Rock!]]'' with the line \"We won't let [[Voldemort|the Dark Lord]] ruin our party just like Tipper Gore tried with the PMRC.\"\n* [[Bad Religion]] cryptically references the PMRC in its song \"I Want to Conquer the World\" (from the album ''[[No Control (Bad Religion album)|No Control]]''): \"Hey, moral soldier, you've got righteous proclamations, and precious tomes to fuel your pulpy conflagrations.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/discography/song.asp?songName=I%20Want%20To%20Conquer%20The%20World|title=I Want To Conquer The World|publisher=|access-date=November 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Warning: Parental Advisory]]''\n* [[Parents Television Council]]\n* [[Terry Rakolta]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Christe, Ian. 2004.

The committee was founded by four women known as the \"Washington Wives\" \u2013 a reference to their husbands' connections with government in the Washington, D.C. area. The women who founded the PMRC are [[Tipper Gore]], wife of [[United States Senate|Senator]] and later [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Al Gore]]; Susan Baker, wife of [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[James Baker]]; Pam Howar, wife of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] realtor Raymond Howar; and Sally Nevius, wife of former [[Council of the District of Columbia|Washington City Council]] Chairman [[John Nevius]]. The PMRC eventually grew to include 22 participants before shutting down in the mid-to-late 1990s.\n\n== Actions ==\nAs a method of combating this alleged problem, the PMRC suggested a voluntary move by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] and the music industry to develop music labeling in the form of a rating system similar to the [[Motion_Picture_Association_of_America_film_rating_system| film rating system]] developed by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]].<ref>Deflem, Mathieu. 2020.

Before the labels could be put into place, the [[United States Senate|Senate]] agreed to hold a hearing on so-called \"porn rock\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joesapt.net/superlink/shrg99-529/|title=RECORD LABELING|author=|date=|website=www.joesapt.net|accessdate=March 10, 2019}}</ref> The hearing was held on September 19, 1985, when representatives from the PMRC, three musicians \u2014[[Dee Snider]], [[Frank Zappa]], [[John Denver]]\u2014 and Senators [[Paula Hawkins]], [[Al Gore]], and others testified before the [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee]] on \"the subject of the content of certain sound recordings and suggestions that recording packages be labeled to provide a warning to prospective purchasers of sexually explicit or other potentially offensive content.\"<ref>[[United States Senate]] (1985): [http://www.joesapt.net/superlink/shrg99-529/ Record Labeling: Hearing before the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation]. United States Senate, Ninety-ninth Congress, First Session on Contents of Music and the Lyrics of Records (September 19, 1985). Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office.</ref>\n\n=== Supporting witnesses ===\n[[Paula Hawkins]] presented three record covers (''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]'' by [[Def Leppard]], ''[[WOW (Wendy O. Williams album)|W.O.W.]]'' by [[Wendy O. Williams]] and  ''[[W.A.S.P. (album)|W.A.S.P.]]'' by [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]]) and the music videos for \"[[Hot for Teacher]]\" by [[Van Halen]], and \"[[We're Not Gonna Take It (Twisted Sister song)|We're Not Gonna Take It]]\" by [[Twisted Sister]], commenting: \"Much has changed since Elvis' seemingly innocent times. Subtleties, suggestions, and innuendo have given way to overt expressions and descriptions of often violent sexual acts, drug taking, and flirtations with the occult. The record album covers to me are self-explanatory.\"\n\nSusan Baker testified that \"There certainly are many causes for these ills in our society, but it is our contention that the pervasive messages aimed at children which promote and glorify suicide, rape, sadomasochism, and so on, have to be numbered among the contributing factors.\" Tipper Gore asked record companies to voluntarily \"plac[e] a warning label on music products inappropriate for younger children due to explicit sexual or violent lyrics.\"\n\nNational PTA Vice President for Legislative Activity Millie Waterman related the PTA's role in the debate, and proposed printing the symbol \"R\" on the cover of recordings containing \"explicit sexual language, violence, profanity, the occult and glorification of drugs and alcohol\", and providing lyrics for \"R\"-labeled albums.\n\nIn addition, Dr. Joe Stuessy, a music professor at the [[University of Texas at San Antonio]], spoke regarding the power of music to influence behavior. He argued that heavy metal was different from earlier forms of music such as [[jazz]] and [[rock and roll]] because it was \"church music\" and \"had as one of its central elements the element of hatred.\" Dr. Paul King, a child and adolescent [[psychiatrist]], testified on the deification of heavy metal musicians, and to the presentation of heavy metal as a religion. He also stated that \"many\" adolescents read deeply into song lyrics.\n\n=== Opposing witnesses ===\nDuring his statement, musician and [[record producer|producer]] [[Frank Zappa]] asserted that \"the PMRC proposal is an ill-conceived piece of nonsense which fails to deliver any real benefits to children, infringes the civil liberties of people who are not children, and promises to keep the courts busy for years dealing with the interpretation and enforcement problems inherent in the proposal's design.\" He went on to state his suspicion that the hearings were a front for H.R. 2911, a proposed [[private copying levy|blank tape tax]]: \"The major record labels need to have H.R. 2911 whiz through a few committees before anybody smells a rat. One of them is chaired by [[Strom Thurmond|Senator Thurmond]]. Is it a coincidence that Mrs. Thurmond is affiliated with the PMRC?\" Zappa had earlier stated about the Senate's agreement to hold a hearing on the matter that \"A couple of [[blowjob]]s here and there and Bingo!\u2014you get a hearing.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lyons |first=Steve |author2=Batya Friedman |title=Winter in America |publisher=[[Option (music magazine)|Option]] |date=January\u2013February 1987 |url=http://www.afka.net/articles/1987-01_Option.htm |accessdate=2014-07-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227060044/http://www.afka.net/Articles/1987-01_Option.htm |archive-date=February 27, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[Folk rock]] musician [[John Denver]] stated he was \"strongly opposed to censorship of any kind in our society or anywhere else in the world\", and that in his experience censors often misinterpret music, as was the case with his song \"[[Rocky Mountain High]]\". In addition, Denver expressed his belief that censorship is counterproductive: \"That which is denied becomes that which is most desired, and that which is hidden becomes that which is most interesting. Consequently, a great deal of time and energy is spent trying to get at what is being kept from you.\" When Denver came up to give his speech, many on the PMRC board expected him to side with them, thinking he would be offended by the lyrics as well.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n[[Dee Snider]], [[frontman]] and [[lead singer]] of the [[metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Twisted Sister]], testified that he \"[did] not support ... [RIAA president] Gortikov's unnecessary and unfortunate decision to agree to a so-called generic label on some selected records\".<ref>Snider's testimony is also available [http://www.vh1.com/artists/interview/1456097/07152002/twisted_sister.jhtml at VH1].</ref> Like John Denver, Snider felt that his music had been misinterpreted. He defended the Twisted Sister songs \"[[Under the Blade (song)|Under the Blade]]\", which had been interpreted as referring to [[sadomasochism]], [[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], and rape, and \"[[We're Not Gonna Take It (Twisted Sister song)|We're Not Gonna Take It]]\", which had been accused of promoting violence. Snider said about \"Under the Blade\", a song Snider claimed was written about an impending surgery, that \"the only sadomasochism, bondage, and rape in this song is in the mind of Ms. Gore.\" He stated \"Ms. Gore was looking for sadomasochism and bondage, and she found it. Someone looking for surgical references would have found it as well.\" Snider concluded that \"The full responsibility for defending my children falls on the shoulders of my wife and I, because there is no one else capable of making these judgments for us.\"\n\nNotable snippets of audio from the hearing found their way into Zappa's audiocollage \"Porn Wars\", released on the ''[[Frank Zappa Meets the Mothers of Prevention]]'' album. Senators [[Al Gore|Gore]], [[Fritz Hollings|Hollings]], [[Slade Gorton|Gorton]], [[Paula Hawkins|Hawkins]], and others appeared. The album cover featured a parody of the RIAA warning label. The [[Gramophone record|LP]] included a note to listeners to send to Zappa's [[Barking Pumpkin Records]] for a free  ''Z-PAC'', a printed information package that included transcripts of the committee hearing, and a letter from Zappa encouraging young people to register to vote. Zappa's full testimonial was released on a posthumous 2010 compilation called ''[[Congress Shall Make No Law...]]''\n\n== Parental Advisory sticker ==\n{{main|Parental Advisory}}\nOn November 1, 1985, before the hearing ended, the [[RIAA]] agreed to put \"[[Parental Advisory]]\" labels on selected releases at their own discretion. The labels were generic, unlike the original idea of a descriptive label categorizing the explicit lyrics.\n\nMany record stores refused to sell albums containing the label (most notably [[Wal-Mart]]), and others limited sales of those albums to adults.  One of the albums to receive the \"Parental Advisory\" sticker was Frank Zappa's Grammy-winning album ''[[Jazz from Hell]]'', presumably for the use of the word \"Hell\" in its title but also for the song \"[[G-Spot Tornado]]\", even though it is a collection of instrumental pieces and contains no lyrics at all.\n\nIt is uncertain whether the \"Tipper sticker\" is effective in preventing children from being exposed to explicit content.<ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/2010641.stm |work=BBC News |title=Spotlight on explicit lyrics warning |date=2002-05-27 |access-date=May 21, 2010}}</ref> Some, citing the \"[[Forbidden fruit|forbidden-fruit effect]]\", suggest that the sticker in fact increases record sales. [[Philip Bailey]] of [[Earth, Wind & Fire]] said that \"for the most part [the sticker] might even sell more records in some areas - all you've got to do is tell somebody this is a no-no and then that's what they want to go see.\"<ref name=\"bbc\" /> [[Ice-T]]'s track \"Freedom of Speech\" contains the lyrics: \"Hey, PMRC, you stupid fuckin' assholes/The sticker on the record is what makes 'em sell gold./Can't you see, you alcoholic idiots/The more you try to suppress us, the larger we get.\" While lyrics from the [[Furnaceface]] song \"We Love You, Tipper Gore\", from their 1991 album ''Just Buy It'', suggest that the label \"only whets my appetite ... only makes us want to hear it that much more\".\n\n== Musician reaction ==\nMany musicians have criticized or parodied the PMRC and Tipper Gore:\n* \"In a world with major pollution and guns ablaze\", [[John Lydon]] marveled, \"they have to pick on someone using foul language.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Neely |first=Kim |date=9 August 1990 |title=Rockers sound off |magazine=Billboard |pages=27\u201328}}</ref>\n* In 1987, the punk rock band [[NOFX]] released an EP titled ''[[The P.M.R.C.

This is still one of the only songs about<ref name=\"Big Brother\" /> Tipper Gore and the PMRC to reach a wide audience.\n* Some prints of [[Metallica]]'s album ''[[Master of Puppets]]'' contained a [[parody]] warning, shaped like a stop sign, that read \"THE ONLY TRACK YOU PROBABLY WON'T WANT TO PLAY IS \"DAMAGE, INC.\" DUE TO MULTIPLE USE OF THE INFAMOUS \"F\" WORD. OTHERWISE, THERE AREN'T ANY \"S...S,\" \"F..KS,\" \"P.SSES,\" \"C.NTS,\" \"MOTHERF...ERS\" OR \"C.CKS...ERS\" ANYWHERE ON THIS RECORD.\" This also references [[George Carlin]]'s \"[[seven dirty words]]\" routine by mentioning six of them.<ref>https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-03-03-25-things-you-might-not-know-about-metallicas-master-of-puppets/</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.feelnumb.com/2012/07/03/metallica-master-of-puppets-vulgar-warning-sticker/|title=Metallica \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d Vulgar Warning Sticker|first=|last=raul|date=July 4, 2012|website=feelnumb.com|access-date=March 10, 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Flotsam and Jetsam (band)|Flotsam and Jetsam]]'s song \"Hard on You\" (from their 1988 album ''[[No Place for Disgrace]]'') is a direct reference to the PMRC, with several lines such as \"One that's young sees the circled 'R', does he buy it?\", \"Can't you see, you're ripping away our independence\" and \"If your committee is so damn right, why did we write this song?\".\n* The [[Megadeth]] song \"Hook In Mouth\" from their 1988 album ''[[So Far, So Good... So What!]]'' is aimed at the PMRC, which is explicitly mentioned in the chorus.<ref>{{cite web |url =http://www.megadeth.com/_sections/scorpion/10_04_04.html |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20041102082625/http://www.megadeth.com/_sections/scorpion/10_04_04.html |archivedate = 2004-11-02 |title = Scorpion Archive |work = www.MEGADETH.com}}</ref>\n* [[Alice Donut]]'s 1988 debut album ''[[Donut Comes Alive]]'' ends with the song \"Tipper Gore,\" which pretends to lionize Gore for her crusade against obscene lyrics in music, but in reality is loaded with [[double entendre]]s.<ref>[http://www.songlyrics.com/alice-donut/tipper-gore-lyrics/ Alice Donut - Tipper Gore Lyrics (SongLyrics.com)]</ref>\n* [[Ice-T]]'s 1989 album ''[[The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech... Just Watch What You Say!]]'' contains many criticisms of the PMRC. One song in particular, \"Freedom of Speech\", is an extended attack on Tipper Gore:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nYo, Tip, what's the matter? You ain't gettin' no dick?\nYou're bitchin' about rock 'n' roll\u2014that's censorship, dumb bitch\nThe Constitution says we all got a right to speak\nSay what we want, Tip\u2014your argument is weak\n</poem></blockquote>\n\n:In his book ''The Ice Opinion'', Ice-T wrote \"Tipper Gore is the only woman I ever directly called a bitch on any of my records, and I meant that in the most negative sense of the word.\"<ref>Ice-T: ''The Ice Opinion'', p. 98.</ref> On \"You Shoulda Killed Me Last Year\", his spoken-word outro to his album ''[[O.G. Original Gangster]]'', he curses the [[CIA]], the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]], [[FBI]], [[George H. W. Bush]], and [[Tipper Gore]].\n* One of the bonus tracks on [[Warrant (American band)|Warrant]]'s 1990 album ''[[Cherry Pie (album)|Cherry Pie]]'', titled \"Ode to Tipper Gore\", is a montage of short audio clips from various live performances by the band, featuring ample use of expletives and obscene language.\n* The liner notes of [[Sonic Youth]]'s 1990 album ''[[Goo (album)|Goo]]'' include a cartoon with the caption \"SMASH THE PMRC.\"<ref>http://www.sonicyouth.com/mustang/lp/lp08h.jpg</ref>\n* The cover art for the 1990 [[PDQ Bach]] album ''[[Oedipus Tex and Other Choral Calamities]]'' features a \"Pathetic Advisory: Inane Lyrics\" warning label.\n* Cinderella referenced the PMRC in their song \"Shelter Me\" (from their ''[[Heartbreak Station]]'' album) with the lines \"Tipper led the war against the record industry, she said she saw the devil on her MTV\".\n* The 1990 [[Dead Milkmen]] song \"Do the Brown Nose\" includes the lyrics ''You, yes you, here's a dime, run out and call the PMRC.''\n* On July 18, 1993, [[Rage Against the Machine]] protested against the PMRC at [[Lollapalooza]] III by standing naked onstage with [[duct tape]] covering their mouths and the letters PMRC on their chests. The band used up their 14-minute performance time without playing any songs. The only sound emitted was [[audio feedback]] from [[Tom Morello]] and [[Tim Commerford]]'s guitars.<ref name=\"moderndrummer\">Micallef, Ken (March 1996), [http://www.musicfanclubs.org/rage/articles/drummer.htm Rage Against The Machine's Brad Wilk], ''[[Modern Drummer]].''

This song ridicules the members of the PMRC.\n* Punk rock band [[The Ramones]] recorded for their 1992 album ''[[Mondo Bizarro]]'' the song \"Censorshit\" about how rock and rap albums were being censored by the PMRC. It mentions [[Frank Zappa]] and [[Ozzy Osbourne]], and is addressed to [[Tipper Gore]].\n* The 1997 Canadian punk band [[Reset (Canadian band)|Reset]]'s album ''No Worries'' features a track titled \"Go Away\", which is entirely about their disapproval of the PMRC and Tipper Gore, with one line directly naming Gore.\n\n<blockquote>\nTipper, won't you understand the message that I want to say<br />\nIt's kind of rude but here it goes: it's \"fuck you!\"<br />\nI don't like what you do, and I don't like you.\n</blockquote>\n* On the 2001 [[Dead Kennedys]] live album ''[[Mutiny on the Bay]]'' (recorded in a 1986 concert), during their song \"M.T.V. - Get off the Air\", lead singer [[Jello Biafra]] tells the audience to \"buy a homemade [record] instead, before the PMRC closes the stores down that sell 'em.\" Biafra had earlier been brought to trial on charges of \"distributing harmful matter to minors\" in an incident involving the 1985 Dead Kennedys's album ''[[Frankenchrist]]'', which featured an insert of [[H. R. Giger]]'s ''[[Penis Landscape]]'' and a parody sticker on the front cover reading:\n<blockquote>WARNING: The inside fold out to this record cover is a work of art by H.R.

Life can sometimes be that way.<ref>[http://www.alternativetentacles.com/bandinfo.php?band=deadkennedys&page=2 Alternative Tentacles - Bands<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref></blockquote>\n* Rapper [[Eminem]] directly referenced [[Tipper Gore]] and indirectly referenced the PMRC in \"[[White America (song)|White America]]\", the opening selection of his 2002 album ''[[The Eminem Show]]''; in it, he referred to his mission as being\n<blockquote>To burn the {flag} and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker/ <br /> To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy/ <br /> Fuck you, Ms. Cheney; Fuck you, Tipper Gore.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/59271|title=To burn the flag and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker|publisher=|access-date=November 24, 2016}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n:Eminem also included [[Lynne Cheney]], owing to her heavy criticism of his previous album and its explicit lyrical content, ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]'', at a [[United States Senate]] hearing. It is also worth pointing out that Eminem's reference to burning the flag was censored {{citation needed|date=July 2017}} on the album release, which added a twist of irony to his claims here.\n* [[Suicidal Tendencies]] referenced Tipper Gore in their song \"Lovely\" from the album ''[[Lights...Camera...Revolution!]]'': \"Tipper, babe, don't you remember me/Now I'm kinder, gentler, and so happy\".\n* [[Harry and the Potters]] reference Tipper Gore and the PMRC in the title track of their album ''[[Voldemort Can't Stop the Rock!]]'' with the line \"We won't let [[Voldemort|the Dark Lord]] ruin our party just like Tipper Gore tried with the PMRC.\"\n* [[Bad Religion]] cryptically references the PMRC in its song \"I Want to Conquer the World\" (from the album ''[[No Control (Bad Religion album)|No Control]]''): \"Hey, moral soldier, you've got righteous proclamations, and precious tomes to fuel your pulpy conflagrations.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/discography/song.asp?songName=I%20Want%20To%20Conquer%20The%20World|title=I Want To Conquer The World|publisher=|access-date=November 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Warning: Parental Advisory]]''\n* [[Parents Television Council]]\n* [[Terry Rakolta]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Christe, Ian. 2004.

It sells a range of clothing, household items and furniture. \n\nHeadquartered in [[Regent's Place]] in the [[London Borough of Camden]], the company owns the Danish department store chain, [[Magasin du Nord]], and has a subsidiary in Ireland.\n\n==History==\n\n===18th and 19th centuries===\n[[File:Debenham and Freebody Wigmore Street 10.jpg|thumb|left|The former Debenham, Son & Freebody building in Wigmore Street which was completed in 1908]]\nThe business was formed in 1778 by William Clark, who began trading at 44 Wigmore Street in London as a [[Drapery|drapers]]' store.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Debenhams |url=http://www.debenhams.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/contentView?filepath=/DebenhamsUKSite/Static/history_debenhams_uk.xml&storeId=10701&langId=-1 |publisher=Debenhams |accessdate=14 September 2013}}</ref> In 1813, [[William Debenham]] became a partner and the corporate name changed to ''Clark & Debenham''. The shop was later renamed Cavendish House and carried drapery, silks, haberdashery, millinery, hosiery, lace and family mourning goods. As the trade grew, the partners determined to expand the business by opening branches in Cheltenham and Harrogate.<ref name=\"housefraserarchive.ac.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.housefraserarchive.ac.uk/company/?id=c1536|title=Cavendish House Co Ltd|publisher=House of Fraser Archive|accessdate=3 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nBy 1823, Clark & Debenham had opened a small drapery business at 3 Promenade Rooms, Cheltenham, selling a selection of silks, muslins, shawls, gloves, lace and fancy goods.<ref name=\"housefraserarchive.ac.uk\"/> In 1837, Clark retired from the business and Debenham assumed two of his most trusted staff, William Pooley and John Smith, as partners, trading in both London and Cheltenham as Debenham, Pooley & Smith.<ref name=\"housefraserarchive.ac.uk\"/> By 1840, the management of the Cheltenham branch appears to have been given to Clement Freebody, Debenham's brother-in-law. Around 1843, another branch shop was launched in Harrogate.<ref name=\"housefraserarchive.ac.uk\"/>\n\nExtended and refurbished premises opened in Cheltenham in October 1844. Pooley and Smith retired from the business in 1851 when Debenham took his son, William, and Clement Freebody into partnership, trading as Debenham, Son & Freebody. At this time all three shops in London, Cheltenham and Harrogate were trading in similar goods and issued a joint catalogue, called the Fashion Book, that was the basis of an extensive mail-order trade. In 1876 when Freebody retired, a new partnership, Debenham & Hewitt, was formed. George Hewitt appears to have worked at the Cheltenham store as a draper's assistant during the early 1860s but details of his subsequent career are not known. By 1883, George Hewitt was the sole owner of the Cheltenham business, Frank and William Debenham having withdrawn to manage the London store as a separate concern.<ref name=\"housefraserarchive.ac.uk\"/>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Crypt Chambers 1.jpg|thumb|[[Crypt Chambers]] in Chester houses part of the Browns of Chester store and is a Grade&nbsp;I [[listed building]].]]\nThe business was incorporated as ''Debenhams Limited'' in 1905.<ref>{{cite web|title=Business History of Department Stores: Interesting Dates |url=http://www.kipnotes.com/RetailDepartmentStores.htm |publisher=KIPnotes |date=1 October 2008 |accessdate=22 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091226213520/http://www.kipnotes.com/RetailDepartmentStores.htm |archivedate=26 December 2009  }}</ref> A new headquarters building, which was designed by William Wallace and [[James Glen Sivewright Gibson]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/survey-of-london/tag/debenham-and-freebody/|title=South-East Marylebone Old and New|publisher=Survey of London|accessdate=27 July 2019}}</ref> and built by [[Trollope & Colls]], was completed in Wigmore Street in 1908.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=074-btrl&cid=0#0 |title=Trollope & Colls|publisher= National Archives|accessdate=27 July 2019}}</ref> The modern Debenhams group grew from the acquisition of department stores in towns and cities throughout the UK, under the leadership of its chairman, [[Ernest Debenham]].

The shop was later renamed Cavendish House and carried drapery, silks, haberdashery, millinery, hosiery, lace and family mourning goods. As the trade grew, the partners determined to expand the business by opening branches in Cheltenham and Harrogate.<ref name=\"housefraserarchive.ac.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.housefraserarchive.ac.uk/company/?id=c1536|title=Cavendish House Co Ltd|publisher=House of Fraser Archive|accessdate=3 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nBy 1823, Clark & Debenham had opened a small drapery business at 3 Promenade Rooms, Cheltenham, selling a selection of silks, muslins, shawls, gloves, lace and fancy goods.<ref name=\"housefraserarchive.ac.uk\"/> In 1837, Clark retired from the business and Debenham assumed two of his most trusted staff, William Pooley and John Smith, as partners, trading in both London and Cheltenham as Debenham, Pooley & Smith.<ref name=\"housefraserarchive.ac.uk\"/> By 1840, the management of the Cheltenham branch appears to have been given to Clement Freebody, Debenham's brother-in-law. Around 1843, another branch shop was launched in Harrogate.<ref name=\"housefraserarchive.ac.uk\"/>\n\nExtended and refurbished premises opened in Cheltenham in October 1844. Pooley and Smith retired from the business in 1851 when Debenham took his son, William, and Clement Freebody into partnership, trading as Debenham, Son & Freebody. At this time all three shops in London, Cheltenham and Harrogate were trading in similar goods and issued a joint catalogue, called the Fashion Book, that was the basis of an extensive mail-order trade. In 1876 when Freebody retired, a new partnership, Debenham & Hewitt, was formed. George Hewitt appears to have worked at the Cheltenham store as a draper's assistant during the early 1860s but details of his subsequent career are not known.
