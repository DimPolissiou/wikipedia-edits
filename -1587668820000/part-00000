AbeBooks currently{{when?|date=February 2020}} has a reseller agreement only with Amazon.com.\n\nIn 2001, AbeBooks acquired Germany's [[JustBooks|JustBooks GmbH]] online book marketplace, which helped the company expand into the German, French and British online bookselling markets.

In 2004, the company expanded its model to include new books, and acquired the Spanish company [[IberLibro]], to better serve [[Spanish language]] markets.

Prices are fixed (with US$1 being the minimum) and there are no auctions. Items available range from the extremely common, where there might be hundreds of copies listed, to first editions and signed books worth thousands of dollars. In addition to books, the marketplace also offers periodicals and journals, fine art such as prints and posters, vintage photographs, maps, sheet music and paper ephemera such as postcards, letters and other documents.\n\n==Sellers==\nSellers pay a monthly subscription to list their books on the site, ranging from [[USD|$]]25 to $500, depending on how many books they list. This subscription fee has been in place since at least April 2008. In addition, sellers pay a percentage fee for each book sold via the websites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://help.abebooks.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-sell-on-abebooks/|title=How Much Does it Cost to Sell on AbeBooks and How Does AbeBooks Pay Me?|date=4 March 2013|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nAbeBooks initially offered its services for a flat listings fee, based on the number of titles listed for sale. The model was changed in the early 2000s to include a commission on sales. In April 2006, AbeBooks started mandatory processing of MasterCard and Visa credit card transactions on behalf of its sellers and added a 5.5% charge for the provision of this service: previously this service had been optional. In 2008, AbeBooks started charging a commission of 13.5% on the cost of postage as well as the book price. Currently (2013) the commission charge is set at 8% of postage and book price.\n\nSellers can, within limits, set their own standard postage rates to various countries or by different carriers. Booksellers can upload their inventory using their own spreadsheet software or via the site's interface. Items that sell are mailed directly from the individual bookseller's location. Some booksellers have new books directly mailed from wholesalers or publishers.

The XM was voted 1990 [[European Car of the Year]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/4758195/Portrait-of-a-driver-Jonathan-Meades.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Harry | last=Mount | title=Portrait of a driver: Jonathan Meades | date=22 February 2003}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nLaunched on 23 May 1989,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/22/business/company-news-new-citroen-model-offered-by-peugeot.html?scp=4&sq=Citroen%20xm&st=cse |title=COMPANY NEWS; New Citroen Model Offered by Peugeot \u2013 New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=22 March 1989 |accessdate=22 December 2011}}</ref> the XM was the modern iteration of the ''Big Citro\u00ebn'', a flagship saloon replacement for the [[Citro\u00ebn CX]]. It went on sale in its native [[France]] immediately afterwards, and was available in right-hand drive on the UK market from October 1989.\n\nThe XM estate was launched in the spring of 1991, until which time the estate version of the CX remained in production.\n\nThe XM inherited a loyal global customer base of executive class customers and a clear [[Brand#Corporate Brand Identity|brand image]], but did not enjoy the commercial success and iconic status of its predecessors, the [[Citro\u00ebn CX|CX]] and the [[Citro\u00ebn DS|DS]], which both raised the bar of automotive performance for other manufacturers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nekrolog: Den store Citro\u00ebn er d\u00f8d|first=Claus|last=Ebberfeld|url=http://www.viaretro.com/2012/12/nekrolog-den-store-citroen-er-dod/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20141121082409/http://www.viaretro.com/2012/12/nekrolog-den-store-citroen-er-dod/|url-status=dead|archive-date=21 November 2014|date=20 December 2012|accessdate=21 November 2014}} In Danish</ref>\n\nWith total sales over its lifetime of just 330,000 units in 11 years, and the fact that its replacement [[Citro\u00ebn C6]] was not launched until the end of 2005 (despite being scheduled for launch in 2001), the XM might be considered a failure. By the second half of the 1990s, sales were in sharp decline, but Citro\u00ebn did not end production of the car until 2000.\n\nDespite its common roots with the Peugeot 605, the XM is already emerging as a collectible car, as the DS and CX both did.<ref name=\"Classic pp 144-151\"/>\n\n===Advances in Design===\nThere were many advances, most apparently designed to counteract the main criticisms of its predecessor. The CX leaned in corners, so the XM had active electronic management of the suspension; the CX rusted, so the XM had a partially galvanised body shell (many surviving XMs have very little corrosion); the CX was underpowered, so the XM offered the option of a 3.0&nbsp;L [[V6]] engine&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;the first V6 in a Citro\u00ebn since the [[Maserati]]-engined [[Citro\u00ebn SM|SM]] ceased production in the mid 1970s. When the estate model joined the line-up, Citro\u00ebn had a competitor at almost every level with most other similar-sized European cars.\n\nVentilation was markedly more effective in the XM. Rear accommodation in the XM was improved over the CX in both width, legroom and height. In particular the rear passengers were seated higher than those in the front in order to afford a good view out, important for a vehicle which would operate in French government service.<ref>The Daily Express World Car Guide 1998, page 30</ref> The XM shared a floorpan with the [[Peugeot 605]], and the two models fared similarly in both teething problems and market acceptance.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Unlike the 605 [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]] design, the XM was a [[liftback]] design&nbsp;-&nbsp;a feature thought to be desirable in certain European markets - perhaps uniquely, it featured an additional glass panel that could lift with the tailgate but when shut, isolated the passenger compartment, to mimic the feel of a salon car.\n\n===Competition===\nXM was intended to compete against prestige vehicles like the [[Audi 100]] and [[BMW 5 Series|BMW's 5 Series]] in a sector that accounted for 14.2% of the European market. It also competed with cars from mainstream brands including the [[Ford Scorpio]] and [[Opel Omega]]. Citro\u00ebn was quoted as saying that the car was supposed to \"take what Citro\u00ebn means and make it acceptable\".<ref name=\"autocar38\">Autocar, 24 May 1989, page 38.</ref> The car's initial reception was positive. Some six months after its launch, The XM won the prestigious [[European Car of the Year]] award for 1990 (gaining almost twice as many votes as the second, the [[Mercedes-Benz SL]])<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1990_1/coty |title=Previous winners |publisher=Car of the year |accessdate=18 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626071657/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1990_1/coty |archive-date=26 June 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and went on to win a further 14 major awards within a year of its launch.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.piecescitroensport.citroen.com/CWW/en-US/HISTORY/CITROENHISTORY/1990TO1999/ |title=Citro\u00ebn in 1990 |publisher=Piecescitroensport.citroen.com |date= |accessdate=7 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008130824/http://www.piecescitroensport.citroen.com/CWW/en-US/HISTORY/CITROENHISTORY/1990TO1999/ |archive-date=8 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe anticipated annual sales of 450 cars a day in the first full year of production, or 160,000 units a year, never materialized.<ref>Car Styling, July 1989, page 7.</ref> Sales never reached this ambitious level (higher than even its popular predecessor) for a variety of reasons. Like the CX, the XM did not have the worldwide distribution of competitors from [[BMW]], [[Audi]], and [[Mercedes-Benz]]. Also, it was launched only a year before a [[Early 1990s recession|major global recession]] began, impacting negatively on car sales across the world; a notable example being the UK, where more than 2.3 million new cars were registered in 1989, but that figure fell to less than 1.6 million in 1991 (a drop of more than 30% in just two years). In Japan the XM was sold through [[Mazda]]'s [[Eunos (automobile)|Eunos]] dealership chain, part of an effort to minimize the appearance of Japan's automobile market being closed to imports.<ref name=DaiRede>{{citation | title = Daihatsu Automobile: Erfahrung f\u00fcr die Zukunft | last = Kie\u00dfler | first = Bernd-Wilfried | language = de | ref = DAK | page = 52 | isbn = 9783517012254 | publisher = S\u00fcdwest | date = 1992 }}</ref> It was also offered by Citro\u00ebn's traditional importer [[Seibu Department Stores|Seibu Motor]], who kept selling the XM by themselves after the Eunos brand was discontinued in 1996.\n\nThe market for executive cars made by volume manufacturers ([[Ford]], [[Opel]], etc.) was on the verge of decline as customers opted for offerings from more prestigious marques, a trend which saw Ford pull out of this market sector in 1998<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Scorpio</ref> and Opel in 2003.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opel_Omega</ref> Customers were placing a higher priority on speed and handling rather than ride comfort which was Citro\u00ebn's specialty.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The XM was underdeveloped at launch which resulted in reliability problems; the vehicle as designed was inconsistent in its abilities. The XM's styling was also controversial and alienated those who desired a more conventional [[Sedan (automobile)|three box sedan]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Peugeot introduced an XM competitor, the very similar [[Peugeot 605]] that also sold weakly. Most subjective of all was the matter of the XM not living up to the expectations created by its forerunner the [[Citro\u00ebn DS]],{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} despite that car having been launched in an era of national markets, of different demands and standards, an era when there was more scope for large advances in engineering and design than were possible in 1989.\n\nExport markets experienced lower sales from the outset, partly due to the XM's pricing. The least expensive XM was nearly 50% more expensive at the time of launch than the corresponding CX. Whilst strong at first<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/01/business/market-place-slumping-peugeot-is-recommended.html?scp=2&sq=Citroen%20xm&st=cse |title=Market Place; Slumping Peugeot Is Recommended \u2013 New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1 July 1991 |accessdate=22 December 2011 |first=Steven |last=Greenhouse}}</ref> home market sales also declined, after the mechanical issues of the first few model years became known. \n\nBy early 1993, the XM was viewed as an \"underachiever\".<ref name=\"Autocar, 24 Feb, page 54\">[Autocar, 24 Feb, page 54].</ref> Initial sales in the UK were at 3,500 units a year, making it Citro\u00ebn's weakest seller. The 2.0-litre petrol engined variants were viewed as being the least competitive. As a result, Citro\u00ebn restructured the range such that all but the base model petrols were fitted with low-inertia Garret turbochargers to add an extra {{convert|15|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. This made the cars more powerful than more expensive competitors such as the Rover 820, Vauxhall Carlton and Ford Granada 2.0 GLX.<ref name=\"Autocar, 24 Feb, page 54\"/>\n\nAfter a run of 11 years, production finally ended in June 2000. By 1998, Citro\u00ebn had confirmed that it would soon be discontinuing the XM and replacing it with an all-new model. At the Geneva Motor Show in March 1999, it unveiled the C6 Lignage concept car, which was scheduled for launch in 2001. In the event, the XM's successor - the C6 - did not go on sale until late 2005 and was even less successful.<ref>{{cite web|first=Julian|last=Marsh |url=http://www.citroenet.org.uk/passenger-cars/psa/xm/xm-index.html |title=Citro\u00ebn XM |publisher=Citroenet.org.uk |date=10 June 2000 |accessdate=7 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Facelift===\nIn mid-1994, the XM was revised in order to improve competitiveness.<ref name=\"Car, May 1995 p94-104\">Car, May 1995 p94-104</ref> This did not materially impact sales.\n\nAll models were fitted with driver's airbag (signalling the end of the single-spoke steering wheel), belt-pretensioners, a redesigned dashboard and upper door casings. The suspension was redesigned to reduce roll, pitch and dive. Most noticeable was the adoption of a passive rear-steering system similar to that on the [[Citro\u00ebn Xantia]]. This sharpened the \"steering without inducing a nervous twitch.<ref name=\"Car, May 1995 p94-104\"/>\" Power output on the turbocharged motor was increased to {{convert|150|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} from {{convert|145|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 4400 rpm. This allowed the car to develop more torque at much lower revs. The important 50\u201370 acceleration time was 8 seconds compared to the [[Ford Scorpio]] 2.0 16V Ghia's 17 seconds. The view of ''[[Car (magazine)|CAR]]'' magazine was that this engine \"provides unusually swift access to effortless power ... it delivers progressively with commendably little fuss; that this 2.0 turbo is as refined as it is muscular makes the XM's performance all the more creditable<ref name=\"Car, May 1995 p94-104\"/>\".\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]] market, demand was reduced to a virtual trickle by the late 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|author=Custom byline text:&nbsp; Ross Finlay |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/seduced-by-gallic-charmers-1.253952 |title=Accessed Dec 21, 2011 |publisher=Heraldscotland.com |date=14 January 2000 |accessdate=22 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Custom byline text:&nbsp; ROSS FINLAY |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/prestige-and-performance-round-up-1.342854 |title=Prestige and performance round-up |publisher=Herald Scotland |date=21 May 1998 |accessdate=22 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Style==\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = 1993 Citro\u00ebn XM hatchback (28603668230).jpg\n| image2 = 1993 citroen xm us model rear sidemarker light.jpg\n| caption2 = Hatchback (pre-facelift)\n| image3 = Citroen XM Break (1991-1994) II.jpg\n| caption3 = Break (pre-facelift)\n}}\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = 2000 Citro\u00ebn XM hatchback (2010-11-28).jpg\n| caption1 = Hatchback (facelift)\n| image2 = Citroen XM Safari long time resident.JPG\n| caption2 = Break (facelift)\n| image3 = 1995 Citroen XM Break VSX Turbo 2.0 Rear.jpg\n| caption3 = Break (facelift)\n}}\n\nThe angular, dart-like [[Gruppo Bertone|Bertone]] design was a development of [[Marcello Gandini]]'s [[Citro\u00ebn BX]] concept. It was a longer car with a longer, inclined nose, more refined details and with headlamps that were very much slimmer than the norm (Gandini's own XM proposal was rejected as looking too much like an Opel<ref>CAR, June 1989</ref>). The design process of the car was described in the journal ''Car Styling''.<ref>Car Styling, 1989,7., pp 6\u201316</ref> In the article Citro\u00ebn's design chief, Art Blakeslee, explained the appearance of the car, saying \"I believe the XM is a modern and dynamic shape, with unique styling elements such as the very long, low hood, the extensive use of glass and the kick-up in the belt line\". In the book ''Citroen XM''<ref>\"Citroen XM\" Jan P. Norbye, Autmobilia, Italy, 1989. Page 62.</ref> another Citro\u00ebn designer, Daniel Abramson, explained: \"We lowered the belt line to give the shape a stronger image. It is purely a 'design statement' that is not functional and does nothing for the aerodynamics of the vehicle. We wanted a car that looks good from every angle\". Abramson is also reported as saying that they \"picked three areas to emphasise: 1) A very aggressive look (\"Almost sinister\"), 2) Lots of glass to create a greenhouse effect, and 3) An aerodynamic accent based on fact (low drag)<ref>\"Citroen XM\" Jan P. Norbye, Autmobilia, Italy, 1989. Page 63</ref>\".\n\nDesign critic Jonathan Meades described the XM as the last gothic car, as quoted by [[Stephen Bayley]] in \"Design Made Visible\" (2007).<ref>Stephen Bayley, Terence Conran. 2007 \u201cDesign: intelligence made visible\u201d. Firefly Books, 2007. Page 115</ref> In 2013 ''Car''<ref>Bird, G. (2013) \"Bertone at 100\" Car, April 2013, page 115.</ref> magazine described the XM as one of Bertone's seven \"game changer\" designs, referring to its \"cool\" angular design and its \"distinctive staggered beltline\".\n{{clear}}\n\n==Suspension==\n[[File:Citroen XM-Rear.jpg|thumb|left|1994\u20132000 Citro\u00ebn XM (suspension fully lowered)]]\nThe [[hydropneumatic]] [[self-leveling suspension]] (featuring grapefruit-sized metal spheres containing [[nitrogen]], acting as both springs and shock absorbers) gained a very sophisticated electronic control system called [[Hydractive]]. This system used sensors in the steering, brakes, suspension, throttle pedal and transmission to feed information on the car's speed, acceleration, and road conditions to on-board computers. Where appropriate \u2013 and within milliseconds \u2013 these computers switched an extra suspension sphere in or out of circuit, to allow the car a [[ride quality|smooth supple ride]] in normal circumstances, or greater roll resistance for better handling in corners.\n\nThe Hydractive system was somewhat \"ahead of the curve\" when the car was launched and early versions were sometimes unreliable. Many problems stemmed from the sensitive electronics controlling the car's hydraulic system, often caused by the poor quality of the multipoint grounding blocks \u2013 one on each front inner wing, one at the rear, and one under the dashboard. These tended to corrode (especially the ones in the engine compartment), causing all manner of intermittent faults which were hard to diagnose. On later cars, these were changed to screw terminals bolted through the bodywork, and most of the older cars have been modified in a similar way.\n\nWhen the Hydractive system worked, the result was a big car with a smooth \"magic carpet\" ride, and better handling than many smaller, lighter, sports cars. When it didn't work, it was quite harsh and bumpy, although no worse than any contemporary high-performance sports sedan. However, right-hand drive XMs were never fitted with the [[DIRAVI]] variable fully powered steering of the CX, having an almost conventional [[DIRASS]] power-assisted setup.\n\nAlthough the Hydractive suspension coped superbly with undulations and driving at speed, it could be unexpectedly harsh if a sudden change in road height was encountered at moderate speed - eg lateral ridges or speed bumps.  Citro\u00ebn finally addressed this, and for Xantia (which shared the Hydractive system with XM) came up with a modified design of the suspension (centre sphere) regulator valves, which made them immune to hydraulic impulses produced by the road surface, and which could push the older-type valves into Firm mode, just when this wasn't needed.  The modified valves were fitted to production Xantias from 8 March 1999 (and were available as replacements), but were not fitted to XM, which was nearing end of production.  Interest in these new-type valves has led to a good few XM owners successfully fitting them, and benefiting from a noticeable improvement in smoothness and consistency of ride.\n\nSome production models of the XM were not equipped with the Hydractive system, but had a 'conventional' [[hydropneumatic]] suspension closer to that of the [[Citro\u00ebn BX]].

It was located off-centre in the first generation cars.\n* The \"XM\" badge on the rear had a more stylised font (like that on the [[Citro\u00ebn Xantia|Xantia]]) and it was moved to the right of the tailgate.\n* The second generation cars were fitted with a lower rear spoiler on the tailgate, sitting much closer to the top of the boot.\n* The grey/black panel between the leading edge of the windscreen and the rear edge of the bonnet was colour-coded with the body colour. The original colouring was designed to echo the upward kick in the window line behind the rear door. With body coloured plastic this visual relationship became less clear and the \"visual mass\" of the front of the car increased somewhat. This effect was clearer on light coloured cars where the contrast between the dark areas and light areas was more pronounced.\n* The door mirrors were modified to improve the view of the passenger side mirror from the driver's seat. Previously it was slightly obscured by the A-pillar. However, the obscuration only affected the field of view above the road horizon which is relatively less important.\n\nDifferences to the interior include:\n\n* A more conventional four-spoke [[steering wheel]] including an integrated [[airbag]]. The driver airbag was standard on most models and countries, regardless of hand-drive configuration. As a result, the second generation models never had Citro\u00ebn's distinctive single-spoke wheel. In certain markets (mainly the UK) and for certain models, XMs of the first generation were fitted with a two-spoke wheel after mid-1992.\n* A modified [[Dashboard|instrument panel]], to accommodate an optional passenger airbag (standard after December 1995). Also, in 1997, front seat-mounted side airbags were added, which were optional or standard depending on model and market. The design was similar to the Xantia's dashboard.\n* The quality of the interior materials was marginally improved, with the leather and the seating being both softer but more supportive.\n* The upper part of door trim were redesigned to soften the shape. Series 1 cars had a pronounced chamfer-effect in keeping with the angular theme of the dashboard.\n* The driver and all passengers comfort was further enhanced (on Exclusive models) by variable heat seating, rather than as before just \"on or off\", with a dial switch allowing a heat setting of 1, 2, or 3.\n\nOther major improvements include:\n\n* Better, more reliable electrics and a faster computer system controlling the new Hydractive 2 suspension.\n* Some models also received the \"Auto Adaptive\" gearbox, which supposedly assesses the driver's driving style, then switches to the most appropriate of approximately 6 onboard programmes. This gearbox was further enhanced by a \"Sport\" mode button (in addition to the sports button for the suspension), which shortened the gear change times, therefore offering a more responsive experience. The final new upgrade effecting the driving experience saw the introduction of a \"Snow Mode\" button, located next to the new sport mode button. Although rarely used in some countries, this was a surprisingly effective addition to the driver's arsenal; during any notable falls of snow that may affect the road ahead, a simple push of this button commands the gearbox to only accelerate from 2nd gear and up, and not to rev the engine too high, thus preventing any loss of traction.\n\nIn addition, the following changes were made to make the car easier to accept by more mainstream car buyers:\n\n* As a direct consequence of their high pressure hydraulics, early XM brake pedals had very little, if any, travel. Phase 2 XMs had some sponginess deliberately built into the braking system (by inserting a sleeved spring into the pedal linkage) to make their brakes feel more like those on other cars.\n* The Phase 2 \"Hydractive 2\" cars no longer \"settled\" down to the bottom of their suspension travel after having been parked for a while; this feature was termed \"Anti-Sink\" by Citro\u00ebn. Such systems have even more complex hydraulics than 'Sinkers' because of the use of isolating valves and an extra sphere near the rear 'axle'. The hydraulic systems were also a lot quieter when maneuvering; this was due to the changes the \"Anti-Sink\" system brought. Early cars, 'sinkers', had a single output hydraulic pump which had its output divided into separate circuits, one for the power steering and one for the suspension/brake circuits (power steering needs a large flow rate whereas the suspension/brakes doesn't). The device which does this job is called a FDV (Flow Diverter Value), and this device hisses noticeably when the car is standing still or maneuvering. A slight pull on the steering wheel or a blip of the throttle will stop the hiss for a few seconds or so. Later \"Anti-Sink\" cars have a dual output pump, referred to as a 6+2 pump due to the number of internal piston chambers. Such cars therefore have no need of the \"FDV\" and therefore do not hiss.\n\n==The DIRAVI functions==\nA function much missed by Citro\u00ebn enthusiasts was the \"[[DIRAVI]]\" System, previously present in the SM and CX. This option was only available for the French or LHD Export market and then only on the 3.0 V6 models. The functionality varied from car to car, but simply put the system affects steering control, at lower speeds less steering centering force aids parking and make city driving easier, but at higher speeds the system makes the steering heavier keeping you in a straight line on highways and suppressing the \"sneeze\" factor inherent to fast steering ratios. Another helpful function of DIRAVI is its ability to return the steering wheel to its central or neutral position when let go by the driver, even when the car is stationary. This is especially helpful when parking as the driver can be assured that his or her wheels will be in the correct position when the ignition is turned off; again this function also aids high speed, straight line driving on highways etc. Although an odd sensation to start with, most Citro\u00ebn drivers become accustomed to DIRAVI in a very short time, only appreciating its unique abilities when they let go of the steering wheel in a car without DIRAVI, only to find nothing happens. DIRAVI makes the tendency of all cars' steering to return to center constant in DIRAVI equipped Citro\u00ebns, rather than being affected by tire adhesion, road tilt, tire pressure, tire failure, etc.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:XM Tissier.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Citro\u00ebn XM twin rear-axle ambulance by Tissier]]\nThe standard 5-door models were called \"Berline\". The XM was also available as a \"Break\" (station wagon) \u2013 and in France, Tissier continued a tradition begun with the DS and CX, converting many to be used as [[ambulances]] and specialised delivery vehicles including their distinctive twin rear-axle conversions.\n\nAlthough not an official variant XMs produced around 1992/1993 have been termed series 1.5 cars due to the mix of newer technology (developed for the series 2) with the series 1 vehicle type. One example of this being the alterations to the \"Hydractive\" suspension system on such cars. Early vehicles (series 1) had a system that could be switched from 'Comfort' to 'Sport' mode, this did exactly what you would expect and firmed up the suspension on flicking the switch but this made for a harsh ride which Citro\u00ebn owners don't like. So Citro\u00ebn developed \"Hydractive 2\" suspension (for series 2 vehicles) that although in essence was the same it worked differently, it still had to two states 'hard' and 'soft' but the switching was controlled differently. In general smooth gentle driving the suspension would be in 'soft' mode (\"Normal\" mode according to Citro\u00ebn on series 2 vehicles) which utilized all 6 suspension spheres and allowed 'crossflow' of fluid from side to side producing the characteristic wafting ride, but as soon as the suspension ECU sensed a large or sudden change in one of the sensors it would put the suspension into 'hard' mode locking out the extra centre spheres and stopping the 'crossflow' of fluid, this dramatically firmed up the suspension and cut body roll, as soon as the vehicle stabilized the ECU would switch the suspension system back into 'soft' mode. This is the basis of \"Hydractive 2\", a soft cosseting ride all the time unless the conditions demand otherwise, switching a \"Hydractive 2\" vehicle into \"Sport\" mode doesn't just switch out the extra spheres as with \"Hydractive 1\", it simply just narrows the parameters that cause the suspension to go into 'hard' mode and keeps the suspension in that mode for longer before defaulting back to 'soft' mode. So a series 1.5 vehicle has the styling of a series 1 but with some of the suspension refinements of the series 2 vehicles. There are other detail changes to the actual implementation of the \"Hydractive\" but unless you are maintaining the vehicle yourself these are unimportant.\n\n==Critical appraisal==\nThe XM was reviewed by numerous automotive magazines during the course of its life. These reviews were generally favorable, if inconsistent, particularly concerning the car's ride quality and appearance. Eventually, reviewers had set up a vicious circle where the car was criticized for not selling and this was offered as a reason not to buy one.\n\nThe suspension, for example, was praised by ''Car'' during testing in 1989 when \u201cthe XM showed the most exceptional side of its character. The new big Citro\u00ebn has the finest suspension of any car yet made, as well as the most advanced\u201d.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">CAR Magazine June 1989, page 103-109</ref> ''Autocar'' compared the XM 3.0 V6 to the BMW 535 and Rover 800 (2.6 litre V6) and found that the XM's suspension allowed \"some bump combinations\" to bring \"unexpected reactions from the suspension\" but concluded the XM presented a \"remarkable display of chassis competence\".<ref>Autocar, 19 August 1989, page 41</ref>'\n\n''Performance Car'' commended the suspension's suppleness but also noted firmness over small surfaces irregularities.<ref>Simister, J., (1989) ''Performance Car'', July.</ref> Autocar <ref>\"Assault on the establishment\".

The magazine discussed the difficulty of replacing the [[Citro\u00ebn CX]] and the writer, Gavin Green, reported that managing director Xavier Karcher chose a design consistent with the BX rather than developing the outgoing car's themes. Green commented that \"People will either love or hate the look of the XM for, like any car that inspires strong feelings, the CX-successor is distinctive. For that, if nothing else, Citro\u00ebn deserve credit\". He described the appearance as \"displeasing\" with an \"awkward, kicked-up hip-line\". Green reported the XM's directional stability in \"gale force winds\" while other cars \"including our own photographic [[Citro\u00ebn BX]] \u2013 nervously {{sic|?|hide=y|side-|stepped}} their way forward ...\" On secondary roads \"the XM showed the most exceptional side of its character. The new big Citro\u00ebn has the finest suspension of any car yet made, as well as the most advanced\". Green's said that \"in soft mode, the car rides just as deftly as a [[Rolls-Royce Motors|Rolls-Royce]], probably better: the suspension feels more compliant than the CX's. In sports setting the XM handles beautifully, far less body roll and pitch than that which betrayed the CX. Only the car's bulk prevents you from staying with the GTis ... It feels like a CX all the same ... there is that same wonderful sense of detachment from the road surface\". The steering was described as inferior to the CX in that the ratio was reduced from 13.5:1 to 17:1, and that the XM has 3.25 turns lock to lock versus 2.5 on the CX. ''CAR'' noted that the interior was \"utterly and depressingly conventional\" other than the single-spoke steering wheel. \"The indicators are sited on a large, self-cancelling stalk, rather than on dainty and ergonomically superior rockers\". The author referred to \"a row of push button switches, all from the PSA parts bin ... scattered just below the steering wheel\".'Photos show two arrays of buttons grouped on an inclined plane, within the radius of the steering wheel. On the credit side \"the XM's cabin is trimmed in attractive plastics and velours of a higher quality than that which used to clothe the CX's interior\". On general assembly: \"Paint finish, panel gaps, general solidity, interior finish \u2013 in every area the XM is streets ahead [of the CX]\". The general roominess was noted, and the visibility was summed up as follows: \"You have a much more panoramic view of the road and scenery in an XM than in a CX. The beltline is very low \u2013 below shoulder level for most drivers \u2013 and the windscreen seems vast.\"\n\nThe conclusion of the article was that \"the XM is a much better car than the CX ... faster, sharper, roomier, better made and more comfortable; it is all these things as well as being distinctive to the eye. It's also the most comfortable car in its class: in absolute terms only a [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] or Rolls-Royce can match it ... It is a far better car than I thought, a far more intriguing car than I feared.\"\n\n''Autocar & Motor'' described the XM's V6 as offering a competitive {{convert|177|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. The reviewer wrote that the engine while benefiting from many technical refinements lacked the \"silky smoothness of a [[BMW]] or a [[Mercedes-Benz]] [in-line] six\".<ref name=\"Autocar, 24 May 1989, page 39\">Autocar & Motor, 24 May 1989, page 39</ref> However, low-end flexibility was \"impressive\" and mid-range response \"strong.\" Overall performance was \"formidable\". Discussing the 2.0-litre variant, Autocar said that when shifting \"you'll find the XM corners with an agility, the steering turning in sharply [...] poise and cornering balance are marvelous; straight line stability is excellent.\" The brakes \"performed superbly\".<ref name=\"Autocar, 24 May 1989, page 41\"/>\n\n''Autocar'''s criticisms related to the \"bland\"<ref name=\"Autocar, 24 May 1989, page 38\"/> frontal styling and the \"awkward\"<ref name=\"Autocar, 24 May 1989, page 39\"/> sharply rising waistline (though overall, Autocar judged the car to be \"elegantly proportioned\"<ref name=\"Autocar, 24 May 1989, page 40\">Autocar, 24 May 1989, page 40</ref>). Noise suppression was also rated mediocre for the V6.<ref name=\"Autocar, 24 May 1989, page 40\"/> However, the 2.0-litre compared favourably to the [[Audi 100]]. The 2.0-litre XM didn't \"feel as quick as the figures indicate\".<ref name=\"Autocar, 24 May 1989, page 40\"/>\n\nIn August 1989, ''Autocar & Motor'' did a group test of the XM versus what it termed the best- and best-selling executive cars in the UK: the BMW 535i and Rover 800 2.6 V6. The XM's cabin was described as being of \"near Germanic quality\" and \"spacious\", airier than the BMW but less luxurious that the Rover.<ref>Autocar & Motor, 16 August 1989, page 37</ref> The magazine considered the exterior styling \"more conformist\" but \"still recognisably Citro\u00ebn\". In summing up, ''Autocar'' felt that both Rover and BMW could offer strong competition to the XM. The magazine was impressed with the Rover's V6 and automatic transmission which could be purchased for less by means of selecting carefully from the options list. Whilst the BMW 530i was more expensive than the XM, most of the vehicle's best features (driving position, styling, best chassis) could be found in a cheaper 520i. The XM was not viewed by ''Autocar & Motor'' as the best driver's car,<ref>''Autocar & Motor'', 16 August 1989, page 41.</ref> as it left the driver \"too isolated from the action\". For ''Autocar & Motor'', it was a close second, with the XM as the \"most spacious, practical and comfortable for five [...] solidly built and generally as well finished as the other pair\". ''Autocar & Motor'' decided that good as it was, the XM would have a difficult job winning sales from the established competition.\n\n''Autocar'' tested the 2.0 SEi in November 1989. Their verdict was that the XM was \"an extraordinary looking machine, capable of extraordinary feats\" but said the XM was an \"acquired taste\" though its \"considerable virtues [were] accessible\".<ref name=\"Autocar, 15 November 1989, page 33\">Autocar, 15 November 1989, page 33</ref> The 2-litre XU-series engine came in for the most criticism. ''Autocar'' described its performance and economy as being disappointing, \"standing at odds with the smoothness and finesse that seem to be so much a part of the car\".<ref>Autocar, 15 November 1989, page 33.</ref> The magazine listed the XM 2.0 SEi's rivals as being the [[BMW 5 Series (E34)|BMW E34 520SE]], [[Ford Scorpio|Ford Granada Scorpio]] 2.0i, [[Mercedes Benz W124|Mercedes Benz 200E]] Auto, the [[Rover 820]] Si and the [[Vauxhall Carlton]] 2.0i CDX. ''Autocar'' judged the Rover (launched in 1986) to be the best buy in the class, based on its low price, the performance of its engine, its \"attractive\" shape, cruising ability and standard equipment.<ref name=\"Autocar, 15 November 1989, page 33\"/>\n\n''[[What Car]]'' tested the XM 2.0 (8v) Si against the [[Renault 25]] GTX, [[Lancia Thema]] CDi and [[Saab 9000]] 2.0 16v.<ref>'What Car' September 1989 Page 52-59, Page 62</ref> The XM came second overall. The magazine summarized its test as follows \"The XM is an impressive car in many respects, particularly in its excellent interior spaciousness, and for the confirmed Citro\u00ebn enthusiast the oleo pneumatic suspension, super sharp steering and brakes will be a major attraction. It's a great long distance cruiser but is let down by mediocre outright performance. Many will consider the XM to have outstanding elegance and style, a brilliant car that stands out among the current crop of jelly-mould, computer-designs. Others will be put off in the first ten minutes by what they see as the oversharp steering and brakes.\" Concerning the ride quality, What Car noted that while the overall ride was of a high quality, the XM was unable to absorb short, sharp irregularities.<ref>'What Car' September 1989 Page 55.</ref>\n\nIn January 1990 UK's Car Magazine ran a comparison of the 2.0 Si against the [[BMW 5 Series (E34)|BMW 520i]] and [[Lancia Thema]] 16V 2.0<ref>CAR Magazine, January 1990</ref> in a review of lower-end executive sector cars. The article says, \"Citro\u00ebn expects business buyers to account for 80% of the 9000 XMs it hopes to shift in 1990... This is the middle trim level of a range that is extremely well-equipped, presumably as an inducement to forget your preconceptions.\" CAR called the XM \"a rather exotic dish for executives raised on a staple of Granadas, Carltons, Rovers.\" The theme of polarizing styling was repeated in the 1990 review: \"Anyone who feared that Citro\u00ebn's individuality might perish in [[PSA Group]]'s drive for increased sales and profitability will be heartened by the XM. There's a touch of love it or loathe it about the styling, but there's no denying that it is striking.\" The slim [[Valeo]] headlamps design helped to make feasible the \"low, penetrating front end\" styling. While the Citro\u00ebn had a drag coefficient of 0.28, the BMW 520's was 0.30 and the Lancia's was 0.32. The article explained that the UK market XM's were not fitted with the self-centering power-steering because \"buyers here don't like it.\" Regarding performance, the Lancia recorded a 0\u201360&nbsp;mph time of 9.6 seconds versus 12.4 for the Citro\u00ebn and 10.6 for the BMW. The Thema was \"the most mettlesome of the trio\" due to sharp throttle responses and engine sound quality. The XM was marked down for the coarseness of the 2.0-litre XU series engine which was \"rough and noisy. There's no pleasure to be gained from revving it hard. Yet this is precisely what you must do to proceed with any sort of haste.\" Performance was reckoned to be \"par for the class. Above 80 mph acceleration falls off dramatically, a victim of a tall top gear.\" The fuel economy of all three cars was considered \"poor\" under test conditions. The XM's braking action was \"the least satisfactory of the group.\" Under roadholding, \"the XM introduces a new motoring experience to those who don't work as engineers on active ride projects \u2013 the flat cornering attitude. In medium speed bends, the XM scurries around with little discernable body roll, wheels upright and all four tyres planted firmly on the tarmac. Body roll isn't entirely cancelled out, though as Hydractive doesn't act as an anti-roll bar, it merely stiffens spring and damper rates. In tight, fast corners the XM leans like any conventional car. When grip from the XM's 195/60 [[Michelin MXV2]]s runs out the Citro\u00ebn starts to understeer gently. The tail can feel a bit light if you lift off part of the way around the corner, but it's a sensation that doesn't develop into anything more sinister.\" The steering was criticized for lack of feel at high speeds. The XM cabin was praised for its solid quality and roominess though the Lancia was reckoned to be as wide and had as much front head room and rear legroom. The BMW was comparatively less spacious. \"Rear seat riders are best off in the XM, where they enjoy the most headroom of the group ... put the centre armrest down, and there is a soft armchair quality to the seats. The front chairs are similar, yet they manage to locate you well when pressing on, and remain comfortable on long journeys.\" About the ride quality the reviewer wrote that \"the XM's ride quality is a big disappointment, especially at low speeds. Fractured urban road surfaces make it thud noisily, while it pummels rather than absorbs, the contusions. It's jittery around town and will slap its tyres over ridges. A BX feels more composed in the same conditions. At higher speeds the XM is more impressive.\" In comparison, the BMW was reckoned to have a \"ride superior to that of the Citro\u00ebn.\" There were \"occasional flashes of brilliance from the XM's chassis, but for the majority of the time it is outshone by the BMW.\" Under driver appeal, the relatively thick a-pillar, foot-operated park brake and obstructed passenger-side mirror came in for criticism. To drive the car \"practice is required to drive it fluidly.\" On the inside \"the XM's cabin is cossetting and is a relaxing place to spend a full day of motorway driving. The quality of trim is easily the best ever to adorn a Citro\u00ebn, and looks plusher than that of the plainer BMW.\" The conclusion of the article was that the BMW won the test against \"all comers in the 2.0 litre class\", primarily for its completeness and engineering quality. But \"in spite of its faults you can't help be intrigued by the XM. You get the feeling that there is a lot to be learned about the car over an extended period of ownership, a hidden facet that can only be revealed by familiarity. And there's the satisfaction of driving a car that looks so distinctive.\" Reported fuel consumption for the cars at {{convert|75|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} were: Citro\u00ebn {{convert|34.9|mpgimp|L/100 km mpgus|abbr=on}}, Lancia {{convert|34.4|mpgimp|L/100 km mpgus|abbr=on}} and BMW {{convert|32.1|mpgimp|L/100 km mpgus|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn March 1990 ''[[Autocar & Motor]]''<ref>Autocar & Motor, 28 March 1990 pages 46\u201351</ref> reviewed the 2.0 turbo diesel variant, labelled Turbo SD. The car's plus points were its economy, space, excellent ride and handling. The negative aspects of the XM were the slow turbo response, engine refinement and gearchange. In detail, ''Autocar & Motor'' described the instrumentation as \"excellent\" and the accommodation as \"generous.\" The chassis was judged to be \"superb, combining fail-safe handling with a pliant ride\".<ref>Autocar & Motor, 28 March 1990, page 49</ref> Ventilation through-put was described as \"excellent\". The overall the ride quality was commended as \"almost unbeatable\" for its capacity to \"swallow up persistent motorway undulations almost as if they didn't exist\" and to \"spit out surface imperfections as if they didn't exist\".<ref>Autocar & Motor, 28 March 1990, page 48</ref> It was admitted that though not often there were conditions the XM's suspension handled less well. These were transverse ridges or some instances where \"some surfaces produce an unpleasant rocking or pitching motion\"<ref>Autocar & Motor, 28 March 1990 page 48</ref> In summary, Autocar & Motor's view was that \"in turbodiesel form, the XM is a fast and effortless long-distance tourer that was always return excellent economy of such a roomy car. Yes, refinement and noise-suppression could be better, and the controls lack the engineered slickness of a BMW or a Mercedes but the XM is a welcome addition to the growing ranks of [[diesel fuel|diesel]]-powered cars and in interesting alternative to conventional [[petrol]]-driven saloons.<ref>Autocar & Motor, 28 March 1990, page 51</ref>\"\n\nCAR magazine tested the diesel variant in July 1990.<ref name=\"citroenet1990\"/> CAR's opinion was that \"a weekend trip to [[Bavaria]] proved this latest addition to the XM range to be a very competent and economical long-hauler. At more moderate British road speeds, we have managed 43mpg in mixed running with four people aboard.\" In this review the car was viewed as being superior to a [[BMW 5 Series]]: \"Early in the trip the car was uncannily smooth over the bumpy back roads between [[Calais]] and [[Dunkirk]]. On German autobahns, travelling at speeds which turn bends into corners, the XM remained impressively flat as the [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] altered to cope with high cornering loads. We made the trip accompanied by a BMW 535i, which rolled appreciably more through fast bends, and passengers who tried both cars preferred the XM.\" Points of criticism were again, the left-side mirror and rear headroom: \" The most serious [problem] is ungenerous rear headroom, though three passengers of average height found the rear bench comfortable for a 12-hour journey. More irritating, because avoidable, is the nearside mirror, which is partially obscured by the A-pillar. This deficiency is particularly noticeable on the continent, when you need the mirror for overtaking.\" The foot-operated parking brake was also criticized: \"... four days weren\u2019t enough to dispel our annoyance with the US-style foot-operated [[parking brake]]. We noted sourly that you would probably fail a driving test in the XM, because you cannot apply the brake (using your left foot) until you have put the car in neutral.\" In conclusion, CAR's view was that \"the XM is a car that grows on you, and in Turbo Diesel form, it's cheap to operate. If you're contemplating high mileages, particularly abroad where diesel is sensibly priced much cheaper than petrol, it\u2019s well worth considering the stiff extra price of the oil-burner. If you care about reducing [[carbon dioxide]] emissions by improving fuel consumption, the XM Turbo Diesel offers dramatic gains without sacrificing big-car virtues.\"\n\nTested by ''Autocar'' against the Alfa Romeo Cloverleaf V6, the V6 version of the XM was placed ahead, but the car was described as \"an uneven performer - high ability but somewhat retarded in the finesse department\".<ref>\"Assault on the establishment\". Autocar, January 30, 1991, page 35</ref> Reservations related to the gear change and the ride quality over rough road surfaces.\n\nIn February 1991, Car Magazine<ref>Car Magazine, February 1991.</ref> tested the XM in V6 form alongside ten other executive cars ([[Alfa Romeo 164]] V6 Lusso, BMW 525i 24v, [[Ford Scorpio]] 2.9 EFi, [[Jaguar XJ6]] 3.2, Mercedes Benz 260E, [[Peugeot 605]] 3.0 SVE, [[Rover Sterling]], [[Saab 9000]] CDs 2.3 turbo, [[Vauxhall Senator]] CD 3.0i and [[Volvo 960]] 3.0i-24). The winner was the Jaguar with the XM in second place. The summary was that \"... the Citro\u00ebn in second place impressed us enormously. The XM is the most advanced car here, the precursor of even better things to come. Such are the Citro\u00ebn's accomplishments that we'd have put it first had its refinement measured up that of the [[Peugeot]] stablemate.\" The Peugeot shared the same engine as the Citro\u00ebn but in the Peugeot installation it was more refined and less \"inexplicably throbby.\" In terms of styling CAR preferred the originality of the XM to the anonymity of the Peugeot: \"criticize the fussy, multi-pillared super-structure if you will but the XM eschews convention and for that we applaud this individualistic car.\" For performance, the XM was praised for its robust acceleration (9.3 seconds to 60&nbsp;mph ) and its top speed (133&nbsp;mph). Under roadholding and handling: \"Hydractive suspension engenders unique feel, making the XM like no other car. Sharp steering and limpet cornering give uncanny responses, modest body roll and terrific composure. Torque steer seldom a problem. Brakes strong and sensitive.\" The report for the accommodation and comfort noted that the instrument dials were too small and that minor switches were mounted too low, out of sight (they are inside the radius of the steering wheel). The [[hatchback]] boot was described as \"massive\" and \"can be extended by folding the seats.\" The XM interior was described as \"plush, its seats soft, supportive and electric.\" The XM tied with the [[Ford Granada (Europe)|Ford Granada]] for having the most rear-legroom. The rear was described as \"spacious.\" With the head restraint of the front seat set to its minimum height rear passengers enjoyed an uninterrupted view out through the windscreen. The model tested was an automatic and cost 25,330 GBP versus the Jaguar's 27,500 GBP price.\n\nBenchmarked against the [[Mercedes E-class]], CAR rated it as superior in 1991.<ref name=\"Car Magazine, Feb, 1991\"/> When compared to the [[BMW 5 Series]] the same journal considered it both inferior and superior.<ref name=\"CAR Magazine, Jan 1990\"/><ref name=\"citroenet1990\"/> By 1994, the XM was described as a car that \u201cdeals less smoothly with surface abrasions\u201d.<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\"/> Motoring magazine programme ''[[Top Gear (1977 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', reviewing the \"high speed hold-all\" market, compared the XM estate with the [[Audi 100]] in 1991<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kx0v5UDjbw |title=Old Top Gear 1991 \u2013 Citroen XM and Audi 100 estates (Bad Quality) |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=17 December 2011}}</ref> (Season 14, episode 16). The presenter reported Citro\u00ebn's claim that its XM had the world's largest estate loading bay and went on to say: \"with this high rear window line you have truly a vast volume of space hidden from prying eyes.\" The load capacity of the boot was cited as 25 cubic feet with the load bay [[tonneau]] removed, helped by a \"low sill and a spare tyre you get at from underneath.\" The Audi 100 had less concealed load space, a flimsy cover and less load space overall. The Audi's maximum capacity was 44 cubic feet versus the Citro\u00ebn's 69 cubic feet. On driving quality, the XM \"is acknowledged to have one of the finest ride qualities in the world and the estate version is just as good.\" But the minor controls were said to be \"intimidating\" and the high rear window line was criticized for its effect on outward visibility. \"Behind the helm the XM shows itself to be a disarmingly fine car,\" reported the presenter. \"Its poised magic carpet ride and velvetty drive train make for gentle and unruffled progress.\" At autobahn speed the car was said to be able \"to soak up every pimple and declivity without so much as a solitary thud.\" With improved quality, shorter service intervals and good looks the \"[[Top Gear (1977 TV series)|Top Gear]]\" view was that residual values \"should stay healthy.\"\n\nThe 1992 edition of the [[Daily Mail]] Motor review, edited by Michael Kemp<ref>Daily Mail Motor review, 1992, page 17</ref> described the styling as \"modern but sometimes awkward.\" The \"high speed roadholding is disappointing\", but the XM was a \"well equipped and comfortable luxury car with fine engine options.\"\n\nThe revised 2.0 turbo model was tested in February 1993 by ''Autocar''.<ref name=\"Autocar page 54\">Autocar, 24 Feb, page 54.</ref> ''Autocar'''s view was that fitting a turbo-charger avoided turbo lag, but \"there's no mistaking the engine's hesitant nature at low revs, making smooth first gear getaways ... unnecessarily awkward\".<ref name=\"Autocar, 24 Feb, page 55\">Autocar, 24 Feb, page 55.</ref> However, the turbo-charged version was a \"swift performer\"<ref name=\"Autocar, 24 Feb, page 55\"/> with {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} achieved in 8.2 seconds versus the non-turbo's 11.2 seconds. Top speed increased to {{convert|131|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, ahead of the [[Ford Granada (Europe)|Ford Granada]] and [[Vauxhall Carlton]]. The XM was commended for its motorway handling, with low rpms at cruising speed and \"excellent\"<ref name=\"Autocar, 24 Feb, page 55\"/> overtaking ability. Engine noise was reduced, addressing earlier criticisms. The ride was improved by a recalibration of the engine's mounting points. In summary, \"add this new found refinement and performance to the XM's other strengths, most noticeably its superb ride and excellent cabin space, and you'd be hard pushed to find a better motorway mile-eater.\" All in all, the revisions to the XM left it in a \"much more competitive position\".<ref name=\"Autocar page 54\"/>\n\nIn July 1994, Roger Bell of the UK's ''Independent'' tested the 2.5-litre turbodiesel variant of the XM.<ref>\n{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/motoring/motoring-time-for-some-tough-torque--roger-bell-is-impressed-by-the-muscular-new-citroen-xm-25td-room-to-move-citroens-xm-25td--road-test-1417186.html |title=Motoring: Time for some tough torque \u2013 Roger Bell is impressed by the muscular new Citroen XM 2.5TD Room to move: Citroen's XM 2.5TD / Road Test \u2013 Motoring \u2013 Life & Style |publisher=The Independent |date=30 July 1994 |accessdate=17 December 2011 |location=London}}</ref> He said that \"the introduction of a new high-torque diesel is among a range of sales-boosting improvements made by Citro\u00ebn to its flagging flagship, still shunned by the British as a Gallic oddity.\" The pricing and equipment were viewed as competitive. The comfort and roominess were praised, but comments on the drive quality focused on the idiosyncrasies. Even though the steering ratio was much reduced compared to the CX, Bell still considered it over-direct and said that \"clumsy drivers should look elsewhere\". Roger Bell's conclusion was that \"anyone in the market for a big, roomy, comfortable car that goes well on little fuel would be foolish to ignore it. Apart from being good value, the XM is one of the last true 'characters' left in a market of lookalikes.\" Fuel economy of 40 mpg was reported for this test.\n\nIn May 1995, John Simister of ''CAR''<ref name=\"Car, May 1995 p94-104\"/> tested the revised XM 2.0 VSX against the [[Alfa Romeo 164]] 2.0 T-Spark, [[Ford Scorpio]] 2.0 16V [[Ghia]] and [[Vauxhall Omega]] 2.0 GLS 16V. The article highlighted an entirely new iteration of the Omega and the recent launch of the [[Ford Scorpio]]. Simister introduced the XM as the \"daring maverick of the quartet, technically and aesthetically.<ref name=\"Car, May 1995 p94-104\"/>\" Due to its hydraulic steering, brakes and suspension the XM was recognized as having \"a different feel.\" The conclusion of the test highlighted the XM's uneven capabilities and also the extent to which the competition was catching up on Citro\u00ebn's unique sales propositions of ride quality and comfort: \"there's a telling generation gap between the two front-drive cars [XM and 164] and the younger rear-drive pair in this confrontation [Scorpio and Omega]\". Though based on the architecture of a much older car, the Mk3 [[Ford Granada (Europe)|Ford Granada]] of 1985, the Scorpio bested the XM on seat comfort and rear legroom. The XM's front seats and cabin ambience did not fare well against the Ford or Vauxhall. However, the turbo-charged Citro\u00ebn beat the Ford on performance. The Alfa was viewed as having the \"sportiest character\" with best handling, but the Citro\u00ebn had better space, comfort, finish and refinement. So a combination of superior speed (compared to the Ford) and comfort (compared to the Alfa) put the XM in second place. The Vauxhall's all-round competence, but particularly its ride, put it in first place. The Vauxhall's suspension was described as \"brilliant. The ride is supple, controlled, well damped ... to obtain such outstanding results through conventional means is to challenge Citro\u00ebn's innovation.<ref name=\"Car, May 1995 p94-104\"/>\" The Opel also boasted accurate steering and \"splendid centre-point responses. No rival turns into corners with greater resolution, bite or fluency.\" The XM's gearchange was described as \"graunchy, downgraded by the mushy clutch.\" And \"despite mid-life refurbishment the XM's dash and switchgear are not up the best.\" The XM was highly rated in steering, it being \"nicely responsive rather than ultra-sharp \u2013 especially at speed, when little more than telepathy is needed to corner with inch-perfect precision.\" In contrast to the Vauxhall and Ford, the Citro\u00ebn's suspension failed to absorb surface abrasions which \"generate high-frequency agitation and knobbliness\".<ref name=\"Car, May 1995 p94-104\"/> However, the oleo-pneumatic suspension could \"waft over foundation irregularities\" better than the competitors. The foot-applied parking brake was described as \"treacherous.\" The luggage capacity of the XM was rated at 460 litres, joint third place with the Ford.\n\nAn unrelated article in the same edition of CAR<ref>Car, May 1995, page 166.</ref> discussed the sales performance of large, diesel cars in the UK market in the previous year. The [[Volkswagen Passat]] was ranked first and the XM took eighth place. Under the category \"Could Do Better Department\" the XM was described as a \"technofest.\" The unnamed author exhorted readers as follows: \"Listen people, they're fab, so try one.\"\n\nDiscussing the merits of turbo-diesels, the [[Glasgow Herald]] described the car in mid-1996 in the following way: \"The Citro\u00ebn XM in turbo diesel form is a splendid long-legged autoroute car.<ref>{{cite web|author=Custom byline text:&nbsp; From the archive |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/the-turbo-touch-transforms-a-diesel-1.448486 |title=Accessed Dec 21, 2011 |publisher=Heraldscotland.com |date=27 June 1996 |accessdate=22 December 2011}}</ref> \" The same edition of the Glasgow Herald summarised the car as \"a fine motorway cruiser, with unexpectedly good handling around the lanes, and masses of space for passengers and luggage.<ref>{{cite web| first = Ross | last = Finlay |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/exclusive-can-be-elusive-1.448428 |title=Accessed Dec 21, 2011 |publisher=Heraldscotland.com |date=27 June 1996 |accessdate=22 December 2011}}</ref> \"\n\nThe view of the [[Daily Express]] World Car Guide 1998 was that the XM was \"as distinctive an executive class car as it's possible to find.\" The interior was described as \"huge.\" The news for that model year was the replacement of the 12-valve 3.0-litre V6 with a 24-valve 3.0-litre V6 that was used in the [[Citro\u00ebn Xantia]].<ref>{{citation | title = [[Daily Express]] World Car Guide, 1998 | ref = DEWC98 | date = 1998 | page = 30 | editor-last = Burgess | editor-first = Peter }}</ref> The Guide commented that the interior was looking dated, but it was described as a \"thoroughly relaxing drive.\"\n\nThe [[Daily Express]] World Car Guide 1999 said \"Citro\u00ebn's largest car is also the most quirky.\" But the XM \"is not without its qualities though, with a smooth ride and mile-munching motorway ability.\"<ref>{{citation | title = [[Daily Express]] World Car Guide, 1999 | ref = DEWC99 | date = 1999 | page = 35 | editor-last = Burgess | editor-first = Peter }}</ref> The depreciation to which the car was prone had become part of the car's identity in many reviews. Typical is \"only a few hundred are sold and values plummet on the used market.\" The 2.1- and 2.5-litre diesels were said to be \"stars of the range with economy and reasonable performance.\" In contrast to earlier reviews, the Guide thought the interiors were \"fragile.\" But the ergonomics remained a point of criticism: \"the interior takes some getting used to.\" Referring to the load carrying capacity of the estate, the Guide said the car was \"capable of carrying more than some vans.\"\n\nBy September 2000 <ref name=\"CAR Magazine, September 2000\"/> the Citro\u00ebn XM's press visibility had diminished. CAR magazine's GBU section was one of the last places it was reviewed. The summary was that the XM as \"an ancient intergalactic cruiser reminds us of what Citro\u00ebn used to be. Bertone's needle-nosed styling is wearing quite well, and comfy, spacious cabin a pleasure on top of the hydraulic chassis. Quite good in diesel and turbo forms ... Estate an unbeatable load carrier but at a decade old this monster is best avoided.\"\n\nCAR magazine's final article on the XM was from November 2000.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The \"Parting Shot\" series was known for its unequivocally harsh stance so the commentary in that tradition was almost wholly negative. The article in question, by Richard Bremner, focused on the issue of the defective electrical connectors: \"Early XMs could be relied upon to go wrong, but little else. And often the cause of the trouble could be pinpointed to one component \u2013 a defective electrical connector\". The result of this reputation was that people \"stayed away in droves, even if some got cars that gave no trouble at all.\" The article noted that \"Citro\u00ebn worked hard at fixing the problems, introducing a new kind of connector after the car was launched, but by then the XM had lost almost all connections with its potential audience.\" The article conceded that a changed market also made conditions difficult for the XM: \"While the CX before it sold well to successful types who needed something big and futuristic, by the time the XM came along their thoughts were turning towards the slickly packaged prestige of [[BMW]] and [[Mercedes-Benz|Benz]]. The market for big cars from volume makers was dying\". Bremner pointed out that it was going to be difficult for any modern Citro\u00ebn to be great. \"What it really needed to be, however unreasonable it is to expect one car company to keep delivering it, was a new concept in big car design, something as radical as the [[Renault Espace]]. But the XM was not that and it has died unloved and destined, one suspects, to become very rare very soon\".\n\nThe XM has a mixed reputation in its post-production twilight. Discussing bargain used cars, the [[Glasgow Herald]] wrote in 1999<ref>{{cite web| first = James | last = Currie |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/bargains-on-a-plate-1.275038 |title=Accessed Dec 21 2011 |publisher=Heraldscotland.com |date=27 August 1999 |accessdate=22 December 2011}}</ref> that the XM has \"a solid reputation, smooth engines, plenty of street presence and lots of room for people and luggage.\" But, writing in the [[Daily Telegraph]] in September 2005,<ref>{{cite news|first = Andrew | last = English |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/carreviews/2737359/Citroen-a-Grande-Vitesse.html |title=Citro\u00ebn \u00e0 Grande Vitesse |publisher=Telegraph |date= 17 September 2005|accessdate=17 December 2011 |location=London}}</ref> Andrew English led his discussion on the [[Citro\u00ebn C6]] with this comment: \"It has been 17 years since Citro\u00ebn last introduced a large car. The slab-of-cheese-like XM that went out of production in 2000 was a mockery of the idea, however. Not just in the coincidence of its design house's name, [[Gruppo Bertone|Bertone]], with that of [[Flaminio Bertoni]], who penned the beautiful and elegant DS models in the 1950s, but also for its staggering unreliability\". When reviewing the [[Citro\u00ebn C6]] in 2006, [[The Irish Times]] referred to the marked improvement in the quality of the new vehicle compared to its predecessor: \"unlike previous big Citro\u00ebns, such as the XM, the C6 has a feel of quality in its fit and finish\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/motors/2006/0823/1155714925772.html |title=Accessed Dec 21 2011 |publisher=Irishtimes.com |date=23 August 2006 |accessdate=22 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nBritain's Classic & Sportscar<ref name=\"Classic pp 144-151\">Classic & Sportscar, July 2010 pp 144\u2013151</ref> published an essay on Citro\u00ebn's large cars, from DS to C6. The tone is more charitable, but still refers to a car with a reputation \"tarnished by complexity\". For comparison purposes a Series 2 XM in 2.1-litre diesel configuration was presented. The article's contention was that the XM was intended to compete with the ascendant German marques. The article views the car's design as influenced strongly by the [[Citro\u00ebn SM]] and calls it \"the world's most subtle retro design.\" On interior (a series 2 which resembles the Xantia's), the author says \"the black cabin is a little dour, but there are playful touches, too, such as the black strip of smoked plastic behind the wheel, from which warning lights<ref name=\"Classic pp 144-151\"/> emerge and vanish.\" Turning to the driving quality, the author remarks, \"you'll find a confidence not always present in its ancestors. There's little [[understeer]], the brakes are more conventionally controlled and the 2.1-litre turbocharged unit has ample torque for cannoning the XM from bend to bend. The bump-eliminating suspension ... still features \u2013 you'll barely notice cattle grids \u2013 but with it comes a firmness more orientated towards the sporting driver.\"\n\nThe UK-based car review website Honest John<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.honestjohn.co.uk/carbycar/citroen/xm-1990/ |title=XM 1990 &#124; Citroen &#124; Car Reviews |publisher=Honest John |date=1 December 2011 |accessdate=17 December 2011}}</ref> summarises the XM, as a used purchase, as \"Comfortable and spacious, especially the estate. Excellent ride and tidy handling. Plenty of potential problems, so buy with care and find an experienced XM specialist.\"\n\nThe used-car website Compucars<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.compucars.co.uk/car-reviews/citroen/xm/ |title=Accessed Dec 15, 2011 |location=GB |publisher=Compucars.co.uk |date=19 October 2006 |accessdate=17 December 2011}}</ref> views the XM as \"surprisingly good to drive thanks to that suspension system. You find yourself relishing country B roads, despite the car's obvious bulk. You need to be careful with the foot-operated parking brake though. A lever on the dashboard, which can take some getting used to, releases it.\" The overall impression of the car, according to Compucars is: \"Gallic charm with attitude. The XM makes a pleasant change from normal executive fare. Buy carefully and enjoy.\"\n\n==Headlight issues==\nComponents supplier Valeo designed the XM's lamps and a similar design was used on the [[Eagle Premier]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://papers.sae.org/970901 |title=Complex Shape Headlamps:Eight Years of Experience |publisher=Papers.sae.org |date=24 February 1997 |accessdate=22 December 2011}}</ref> The goal of the design was to reduce the size of the lamps and to increase their output. The XM's new \"complex surface\" [[headlamp]]s were not powerful enough on dipped beam,<ref>{{cite web|first=Julian|last=Marsh |url=http://www.citroenet.org.uk/passenger-cars/psa/xm/xm-11.html |title=Citro\u00ebn XM headlamp complaints |publisher=Citroenet.org.uk |date=10 June 2000 |accessdate=10 October 2010}}</ref> though main beam was perfectly adequate. This could be traced to the use of a plastic optical element between the bulb and the outer lens, which yellowed with age.\n\nThe XM was not alone here; the pre-facelifted first-generation [[Ford Mondeo]]s suffered from the same problem. Series 2 (from mid-1994 onwards) [[Right- and left-hand traffic|LHD]] XMs had improved light units without the plastic element, but slow [[United Kingdom]] sales meant these were never fitted to [[Right- and left-hand traffic|RHD]] forms. Headlamp retrofit kits using dual or triple round optics are available from third party suppliers, though this changes the aesthetics of the car. Series 1 cars can be fitted with series 2 headlights.\n\n==US import==\n[[File:Citroen XM Hatchback.JPG|thumb|left|Citro\u00ebn XM hatchback (US)]]\nThe XM was imported into the United States by CXA, a company that had imported several hundred [[Citro\u00ebn CX|CX25]] GTi and Prestige model cars for Citro\u00ebn [[fan (aficionado)|loyalists]] in the USA.\n\nCxAuto presented the XM at the 1991 [[New York International Auto Show|New York Motor Show]], in the spring of 1991 and began converting and selling the XM Pallas (combined with the 2.0 injection engine) and the XM Vitesse (combined with the 3.0 V6 engine). In 1993, the XM Exclusive was added to the range. Unfortunately, the XM cost 40% more than the CX Prestige, with a price in excess of $50,000 and only a few examples were sold. As a result of newer, tougher US anti-pollution standards, the import of these cars ceased in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citroenet.org.uk/foreign/usa/90-01.html |title=1990 CxAuto XM Vitesse advertisement |publisher= |date= |accessdate=13 December 2011}}</ref> XM parts must be sent over from Europe.\n\n== Chinese production ==\n{{Clear}}The Citro\u00ebn XM, along with the Citro\u00ebn Xantia were assembled in a form of CKD in Huizhou, Guangdong province.

It went on sale in its native [[France]] immediately afterwards, and was available in right-hand drive on the UK market from October 1989.\n\nThe XM estate was launched in the spring of 1991, until which time the estate version of the CX remained in production.\n\nThe XM inherited a loyal global customer base of executive class customers and a clear [[Brand#Corporate Brand Identity|brand image]], but did not enjoy the commercial success and iconic status of its predecessors, the [[Citro\u00ebn CX|CX]] and the [[Citro\u00ebn DS|DS]], which both raised the bar of automotive performance for other manufacturers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nekrolog: Den store Citro\u00ebn er d\u00f8d|first=Claus|last=Ebberfeld|url=http://www.viaretro.com/2012/12/nekrolog-den-store-citroen-er-dod/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20141121082409/http://www.viaretro.com/2012/12/nekrolog-den-store-citroen-er-dod/|url-status=dead|archive-date=21 November 2014|date=20 December 2012|accessdate=21 November 2014}} In Danish</ref>\n\nWith total sales over its lifetime of just 330,000 units in 11 years, and the fact that its replacement [[Citro\u00ebn C6]] was not launched until the end of 2005 (despite being scheduled for launch in 2001), the XM might be considered a failure. By the second half of the 1990s, sales were in sharp decline, but Citro\u00ebn did not end production of the car until 2000.\n\nDespite its common roots with the Peugeot 605, the XM is already emerging as a collectible car, as the DS and CX both did.<ref name=\"Classic pp 144-151\"/>\n\n===Advances in Design===\nThere were many advances, most apparently designed to counteract the main criticisms of its predecessor. The CX leaned in corners, so the XM had active electronic management of the suspension; the CX rusted, so the XM had a partially galvanised body shell (many surviving XMs have very little corrosion); the CX was underpowered, so the XM offered the option of a 3.0&nbsp;L [[V6]] engine&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;the first V6 in a Citro\u00ebn since the [[Maserati]]-engined [[Citro\u00ebn SM|SM]] ceased production in the mid 1970s. When the estate model joined the line-up, Citro\u00ebn had a competitor at almost every level with most other similar-sized European cars.\n\nVentilation was markedly more effective in the XM. Rear accommodation in the XM was improved over the CX in both width, legroom and height. In particular the rear passengers were seated higher than those in the front in order to afford a good view out, important for a vehicle which would operate in French government service.<ref>The Daily Express World Car Guide 1998, page 30</ref> The XM shared a floorpan with the [[Peugeot 605]], and the two models fared similarly in both teething problems and market acceptance.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Unlike the 605 [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]] design, the XM was a [[liftback]] design&nbsp;-&nbsp;a feature thought to be desirable in certain European markets - perhaps uniquely, it featured an additional glass panel that could lift with the tailgate but when shut, isolated the passenger compartment, to mimic the feel of a salon car.\n\n===Competition===\nXM was intended to compete against prestige vehicles like the [[Audi 100]] and [[BMW 5 Series|BMW's 5 Series]] in a sector that accounted for 14.2% of the European market. It also competed with cars from mainstream brands including the [[Ford Scorpio]] and [[Opel Omega]]. Citro\u00ebn was quoted as saying that the car was supposed to \"take what Citro\u00ebn means and make it acceptable\".<ref name=\"autocar38\">Autocar, 24 May 1989, page 38.</ref> The car's initial reception was positive.

Like the CX, the XM did not have the worldwide distribution of competitors from [[BMW]], [[Audi]], and [[Mercedes-Benz]]. Also, it was launched only a year before a [[Early 1990s recession|major global recession]] began, impacting negatively on car sales across the world; a notable example being the UK, where more than 2.3 million new cars were registered in 1989, but that figure fell to less than 1.6 million in 1991 (a drop of more than 30% in just two years). In Japan the XM was sold through [[Mazda]]'s [[Eunos (automobile)|Eunos]] dealership chain, part of an effort to minimize the appearance of Japan's automobile market being closed to imports.<ref name=DaiRede>{{citation | title = Daihatsu Automobile: Erfahrung f\u00fcr die Zukunft | last = Kie\u00dfler | first = Bernd-Wilfried | language = de | ref = DAK | page = 52 | isbn = 9783517012254 | publisher = S\u00fcdwest | date = 1992 }}</ref> It was also offered by Citro\u00ebn's traditional importer [[Seibu Department Stores|Seibu Motor]], who kept selling the XM by themselves after the Eunos brand was discontinued in 1996.\n\nThe market for executive cars made by volume manufacturers ([[Ford]], [[Opel]], etc.) was on the verge of decline as customers opted for offerings from more prestigious marques, a trend which saw Ford pull out of this market sector in 1998<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Scorpio</ref> and Opel in 2003.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opel_Omega</ref> Customers were placing a higher priority on speed and handling rather than ride comfort which was Citro\u00ebn's specialty.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The XM was underdeveloped at launch which resulted in reliability problems; the vehicle as designed was inconsistent in its abilities. The XM's styling was also controversial and alienated those who desired a more conventional [[Sedan (automobile)|three box sedan]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Peugeot introduced an XM competitor, the very similar [[Peugeot 605]] that also sold weakly. Most subjective of all was the matter of the XM not living up to the expectations created by its forerunner the [[Citro\u00ebn DS]],{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} despite that car having been launched in an era of national markets, of different demands and standards, an era when there was more scope for large advances in engineering and design than were possible in 1989.\n\nExport markets experienced lower sales from the outset, partly due to the XM's pricing. The least expensive XM was nearly 50% more expensive at the time of launch than the corresponding CX.

The 2.0-litre petrol engined variants were viewed as being the least competitive. As a result, Citro\u00ebn restructured the range such that all but the base model petrols were fitted with low-inertia Garret turbochargers to add an extra {{convert|15|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. This made the cars more powerful than more expensive competitors such as the Rover 820, Vauxhall Carlton and Ford Granada 2.0 GLX.<ref name=\"Autocar, 24 Feb, page 54\"/>\n\nAfter a run of 11 years, production finally ended in June 2000. By 1998, Citro\u00ebn had confirmed that it would soon be discontinuing the XM and replacing it with an all-new model. At the Geneva Motor Show in March 1999, it unveiled the C6 Lignage concept car, which was scheduled for launch in 2001. In the event, the XM's successor - the C6 - did not go on sale until late 2005 and was even less successful.<ref>{{cite web|first=Julian|last=Marsh |url=http://www.citroenet.org.uk/passenger-cars/psa/xm/xm-index.html |title=Citro\u00ebn XM |publisher=Citroenet.org.uk |date=10 June 2000 |accessdate=7 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Facelift===\nIn mid-1994, the XM was revised in order to improve competitiveness.<ref name=\"Car, May 1995 p94-104\">Car, May 1995 p94-104</ref> This did not materially impact sales.\n\nAll models were fitted with driver's airbag (signalling the end of the single-spoke steering wheel), belt-pretensioners, a redesigned dashboard and upper door casings. The suspension was redesigned to reduce roll, pitch and dive. Most noticeable was the adoption of a passive rear-steering system similar to that on the [[Citro\u00ebn Xantia]]. This sharpened the \"steering without inducing a nervous twitch.<ref name=\"Car, May 1995 p94-104\"/>\" Power output on the turbocharged motor was increased to {{convert|150|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} from {{convert|145|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 4400 rpm. This allowed the car to develop more torque at much lower revs. The important 50\u201370 acceleration time was 8 seconds compared to the [[Ford Scorpio]] 2.0 16V Ghia's 17 seconds. The view of ''[[Car (magazine)|CAR]]'' magazine was that this engine \"provides unusually swift access to effortless power ... it delivers progressively with commendably little fuss; that this 2.0 turbo is as refined as it is muscular makes the XM's performance all the more creditable<ref name=\"Car, May 1995 p94-104\"/>\".\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]] market, demand was reduced to a virtual trickle by the late 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|author=Custom byline text:&nbsp; Ross Finlay |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/seduced-by-gallic-charmers-1.253952 |title=Accessed Dec 21, 2011 |publisher=Heraldscotland.com |date=14 January 2000 |accessdate=22 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Custom byline text:&nbsp; ROSS FINLAY |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/prestige-and-performance-round-up-1.342854 |title=Prestige and performance round-up |publisher=Herald Scotland |date=21 May 1998 |accessdate=22 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Style==\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = 1993 Citro\u00ebn XM hatchback (28603668230).jpg\n| image2 = 1993 citroen xm us model rear sidemarker light.jpg\n| caption2 = Hatchback (pre-facelift)\n| image3 = Citroen XM Break (1991-1994) II.jpg\n| caption3 = Break (pre-facelift)\n}}\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = 2000 Citro\u00ebn XM hatchback (2010-11-28).jpg\n| caption1 = Hatchback (facelift)\n| image2 = Citroen XM Safari long time resident.JPG\n| caption2 = Break (facelift)\n| image3 = 1995 Citroen XM Break VSX Turbo 2.0 Rear.jpg\n| caption3 = Break (facelift)\n}}\n\nThe angular, dart-like [[Gruppo Bertone|Bertone]] design was a development of [[Marcello Gandini]]'s [[Citro\u00ebn BX]] concept. It was a longer car with a longer, inclined nose, more refined details and with headlamps that were very much slimmer than the norm (Gandini's own XM proposal was rejected as looking too much like an Opel<ref>CAR, June 1989</ref>). The design process of the car was described in the journal ''Car Styling''.<ref>Car Styling, 1989,7., pp 6\u201316</ref> In the article Citro\u00ebn's design chief, Art Blakeslee, explained the appearance of the car, saying \"I believe the XM is a modern and dynamic shape, with unique styling elements such as the very long, low hood, the extensive use of glass and the kick-up in the belt line\". In the book ''Citroen XM''<ref>\"Citroen XM\" Jan P. Norbye, Autmobilia, Italy, 1989. Page 62.</ref> another Citro\u00ebn designer, Daniel Abramson, explained: \"We lowered the belt line to give the shape a stronger image. It is purely a 'design statement' that is not functional and does nothing for the aerodynamics of the vehicle. We wanted a car that looks good from every angle\". Abramson is also reported as saying that they \"picked three areas to emphasise: 1) A very aggressive look (\"Almost sinister\"), 2) Lots of glass to create a greenhouse effect, and 3) An aerodynamic accent based on fact (low drag)<ref>\"Citroen XM\" Jan P. Norbye, Autmobilia, Italy, 1989.

This system used sensors in the steering, brakes, suspension, throttle pedal and transmission to feed information on the car's speed, acceleration, and road conditions to on-board computers. Where appropriate \u2013 and within milliseconds \u2013 these computers switched an extra suspension sphere in or out of circuit, to allow the car a [[ride quality|smooth supple ride]] in normal circumstances, or greater roll resistance for better handling in corners.\n\nThe Hydractive system was somewhat \"ahead of the curve\" when the car was launched and early versions were sometimes unreliable. Many problems stemmed from the sensitive electronics controlling the car's hydraulic system, often caused by the poor quality of the multipoint grounding blocks \u2013 one on each front inner wing, one at the rear, and one under the dashboard. These tended to corrode (especially the ones in the engine compartment), causing all manner of intermittent faults which were hard to diagnose. On later cars, these were changed to screw terminals bolted through the bodywork, and most of the older cars have been modified in a similar way.\n\nWhen the Hydractive system worked, the result was a big car with a smooth \"magic carpet\" ride, and better handling than many smaller, lighter, sports cars. When it didn't work, it was quite harsh and bumpy, although no worse than any contemporary high-performance sports sedan. However, right-hand drive XMs were never fitted with the [[DIRAVI]] variable fully powered steering of the CX, having an almost conventional [[DIRASS]] power-assisted setup.\n\nAlthough the Hydractive suspension coped superbly with undulations and driving at speed, it could be unexpectedly harsh if a sudden change in road height was encountered at moderate speed - eg lateral ridges or speed bumps.  Citro\u00ebn finally addressed this, and for Xantia (which shared the Hydractive system with XM) came up with a modified design of the suspension (centre sphere) regulator valves, which made them immune to hydraulic impulses produced by the road surface, and which could push the older-type valves into Firm mode, just when this wasn't needed.  The modified valves were fitted to production Xantias from 8 March 1999 (and were available as replacements), but were not fitted to XM, which was nearing end of production.  Interest in these new-type valves has led to a good few XM owners successfully fitting them, and benefiting from a noticeable improvement in smoothness and consistency of ride.\n\nSome production models of the XM were not equipped with the Hydractive system, but had a 'conventional' [[hydropneumatic]] suspension closer to that of the [[Citro\u00ebn BX]]. These lower specification vehicles were all built for markets in mainland Europe.\n\n==Engines==\nThe XM was fitted with a wide range of gasoline and diesel engines:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!Model!!Engine!!Displacement!!Valvetrain!!Fuel system!!Max. power at rpm!!Max. torque at rpm!!0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h (0-62 mph)!!Top speed!!Years\n|-\n| colspan=\"10\" |Petrol engines\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|'''2.0'''||[[PSA XU engine#XU10|XU10 2C]]||1,998 cc||[[Single overhead camshaft|SOHC]] 8v||[[Carburettor]]||{{convert|114|PS|kW hp||abbr=on}} at 5,800 rpm||{{convert|164|Nm|lbft||abbr=on}} at 2,250 rpm||12.2 s||{{convert|193|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}||1989\u20131992\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|'''2.0 [[catalytic converter|cat]]'''||[[PSA XU engine#XU10|XU10 2C]]||1,998 cc||[[Single overhead camshaft|SOHC]] 8v||[[Carburettor]]||{{convert|107|PS|kW hp||abbr=on}} at 5,600 rpm||{{convert|164|Nm|lbft||abbr=on}} at 2,250 rpm||12.4 s||{{convert|190|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}||1989\u20131992\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|'''2.0 i [[catalytic converter|cat]]'''||[[PSA XU engine#XU10|XU10]]||1,998 cc||[[Single overhead camshaft|SOHC]] 8v||[[Single-point fuel injection]]||{{convert|110|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5,600 rpm||{{convert|164|Nm|lbft||abbr=on}} at 3,500 rpm||12.4 s||{{convert|190|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}||1989\u20131994\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|'''2.0 i'''||[[PSA XU engine#XU10|XU10]] M||1,998 cc||[[Single overhead camshaft|SOHC]] 8v||[[Multi-point fuel injection]]||{{convert|128|PS|kW hp||abbr=on}} at 5,600 rpm||{{convert|175|Nm|lbft||abbr=on}} at 4,800 rpm||11.5 s||{{convert|205|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}||1989\u20131992\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|'''2.0 i [[catalytic converter|cat]]'''||[[PSA XU engine#XU10|XU10]] J2C (RFU)||1,998 cc||[[Single overhead camshaft|SOHC]] 8v||[[Multi-point fuel injection]]||{{convert|121|PS|kW hp||abbr=on}} at 5,600 rpm||{{convert|170|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,000 rpm||11.9 s||{{convert|201|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}||1989\u20131994\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|'''2.0 i [[Multi-valve|16V]]'''||[[PSA XU engine#XU10|XU10]] J4R (RFV)||1,998 cc||[[Double overhead camshaft|DOHC]] [[Multi-valve|16v]]||[[Multi-point fuel injection]]||{{convert|132|PS|kW hp||abbr=on}} at 5,500 rpm||{{convert|180|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,200 rpm||10.8 s||{{convert|205|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}||1994\u20132000\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|'''2.0 i [[Turbocharger|Turbo]] CT'''||[[PSA XU engine#XU10|XU10]] J2TE (RGY)||1,998 cc||[[Single overhead camshaft|SOHC]] 8v||[[Multi-point fuel injection]]||{{convert|141|PS|kW hp||abbr=on}} at 4,400 rpm||{{convert|225|Nm|lbft||abbr=on}} at 2,200 rpm||9.8 s||{{convert|212|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}||1992\u20131994\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|'''2.0 i [[Turbocharger|Turbo]] CT'''||[[PSA XU engine#XU10|XU10]] J2TE (RGX)||1,998 cc||[[Single overhead camshaft|SOHC]] 8v||[[Multi-point fuel injection]]||{{convert|147|PS|kW hp||abbr=on}} at 5,300 rpm||{{convert|235|Nm|lbft||abbr=on}} at 2,500 rpm||9.3 s||{{convert|215|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}||1994\u20132000\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|'''3.0 i [[V6 engine|V6]]'''||[[PRV engine|PRV]] ZPJ S6A||2,975 cc||[[Single overhead camshaft|SOHC]] 12v||[[Multi-point fuel injection]]||{{convert|167|PS|kW hp||abbr=on}} at 5,600 rpm||{{convert|235|Nm|lbft||abbr=on}} at 4,600 rpm||8.9 s||{{convert|222|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}||1989\u20131993\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|'''3.0 i [[V6 engine|V6]]'''||[[PRV engine|PRV]]  ZPJ S6A||2,963 cc||[[Single overhead camshaft|SOHC]] 12v||[[Multi-point fuel injection]]||{{convert|167|PS|kW hp||abbr=on}} at 5,600 rpm||{{convert|235|Nm|lbft||abbr=on}} at 4,600 rpm||9.7 s||{{convert|222|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}||1993\u20131997\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|'''3.0 i [[V6 engine|V6]] [[Multi-valve|24V]]'''||[[PRV engine|PRV]] ZPJ4 SKZ||2,975 cc||[[Single overhead camshaft|SOHC]] [[Multi-valve|24v]]||[[Multi-point fuel injection]]||{{convert|200|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6,000 rpm||{{convert|260|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 3,600 rpm||8.6*<sup>2</sup> s||{{convert|235|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}||1990\u20131993\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|'''3.0 i [[V6 engine|V6]] [[Multi-valve|24V]]'''||[[PRV engine|PRV]] ZPJ4 SKZ<ref>Citroen Technical bulletin for XM.

It was located off-centre in the first generation cars.\n* The \"XM\" badge on the rear had a more stylised font (like that on the [[Citro\u00ebn Xantia|Xantia]]) and it was moved to the right of the tailgate.\n* The second generation cars were fitted with a lower rear spoiler on the tailgate, sitting much closer to the top of the boot.\n* The grey/black panel between the leading edge of the windscreen and the rear edge of the bonnet was colour-coded with the body colour. The original colouring was designed to echo the upward kick in the window line behind the rear door. With body coloured plastic this visual relationship became less clear and the \"visual mass\" of the front of the car increased somewhat. This effect was clearer on light coloured cars where the contrast between the dark areas and light areas was more pronounced.\n* The door mirrors were modified to improve the view of the passenger side mirror from the driver's seat. Previously it was slightly obscured by the A-pillar. However, the obscuration only affected the field of view above the road horizon which is relatively less important.\n\nDifferences to the interior include:\n\n* A more conventional four-spoke [[steering wheel]] including an integrated [[airbag]]. The driver airbag was standard on most models and countries, regardless of hand-drive configuration. As a result, the second generation models never had Citro\u00ebn's distinctive single-spoke wheel. In certain markets (mainly the UK) and for certain models, XMs of the first generation were fitted with a two-spoke wheel after mid-1992.\n* A modified [[Dashboard|instrument panel]], to accommodate an optional passenger airbag (standard after December 1995). Also, in 1997, front seat-mounted side airbags were added, which were optional or standard depending on model and market. The design was similar to the Xantia's dashboard.\n* The quality of the interior materials was marginally improved, with the leather and the seating being both softer but more supportive.\n* The upper part of door trim were redesigned to soften the shape. Series 1 cars had a pronounced chamfer-effect in keeping with the angular theme of the dashboard.\n* The driver and all passengers comfort was further enhanced (on Exclusive models) by variable heat seating, rather than as before just \"on or off\", with a dial switch allowing a heat setting of 1, 2, or 3.\n\nOther major improvements include:\n\n* Better, more reliable electrics and a faster computer system controlling the new Hydractive 2 suspension.\n* Some models also received the \"Auto Adaptive\" gearbox, which supposedly assesses the driver's driving style, then switches to the most appropriate of approximately 6 onboard programmes. This gearbox was further enhanced by a \"Sport\" mode button (in addition to the sports button for the suspension), which shortened the gear change times, therefore offering a more responsive experience. The final new upgrade effecting the driving experience saw the introduction of a \"Snow Mode\" button, located next to the new sport mode button. Although rarely used in some countries, this was a surprisingly effective addition to the driver's arsenal; during any notable falls of snow that may affect the road ahead, a simple push of this button commands the gearbox to only accelerate from 2nd gear and up, and not to rev the engine too high, thus preventing any loss of traction.\n\nIn addition, the following changes were made to make the car easier to accept by more mainstream car buyers:\n\n* As a direct consequence of their high pressure hydraulics, early XM brake pedals had very little, if any, travel. Phase 2 XMs had some sponginess deliberately built into the braking system (by inserting a sleeved spring into the pedal linkage) to make their brakes feel more like those on other cars.\n* The Phase 2 \"Hydractive 2\" cars no longer \"settled\" down to the bottom of their suspension travel after having been parked for a while; this feature was termed \"Anti-Sink\" by Citro\u00ebn. Such systems have even more complex hydraulics than 'Sinkers' because of the use of isolating valves and an extra sphere near the rear 'axle'. The hydraulic systems were also a lot quieter when maneuvering; this was due to the changes the \"Anti-Sink\" system brought. Early cars, 'sinkers', had a single output hydraulic pump which had its output divided into separate circuits, one for the power steering and one for the suspension/brake circuits (power steering needs a large flow rate whereas the suspension/brakes doesn't). The device which does this job is called a FDV (Flow Diverter Value), and this device hisses noticeably when the car is standing still or maneuvering. A slight pull on the steering wheel or a blip of the throttle will stop the hiss for a few seconds or so. Later \"Anti-Sink\" cars have a dual output pump, referred to as a 6+2 pump due to the number of internal piston chambers. Such cars therefore have no need of the \"FDV\" and therefore do not hiss.\n\n==The DIRAVI functions==\nA function much missed by Citro\u00ebn enthusiasts was the \"[[DIRAVI]]\" System, previously present in the SM and CX. This option was only available for the French or LHD Export market and then only on the 3.0 V6 models. The functionality varied from car to car, but simply put the system affects steering control, at lower speeds less steering centering force aids parking and make city driving easier, but at higher speeds the system makes the steering heavier keeping you in a straight line on highways and suppressing the \"sneeze\" factor inherent to fast steering ratios. Another helpful function of DIRAVI is its ability to return the steering wheel to its central or neutral position when let go by the driver, even when the car is stationary. This is especially helpful when parking as the driver can be assured that his or her wheels will be in the correct position when the ignition is turned off; again this function also aids high speed, straight line driving on highways etc. Although an odd sensation to start with, most Citro\u00ebn drivers become accustomed to DIRAVI in a very short time, only appreciating its unique abilities when they let go of the steering wheel in a car without DIRAVI, only to find nothing happens. DIRAVI makes the tendency of all cars' steering to return to center constant in DIRAVI equipped Citro\u00ebns, rather than being affected by tire adhesion, road tilt, tire pressure, tire failure, etc.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:XM Tissier.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Citro\u00ebn XM twin rear-axle ambulance by Tissier]]\nThe standard 5-door models were called \"Berline\". The XM was also available as a \"Break\" (station wagon) \u2013 and in France, Tissier continued a tradition begun with the DS and CX, converting many to be used as [[ambulances]] and specialised delivery vehicles including their distinctive twin rear-axle conversions.\n\nAlthough not an official variant XMs produced around 1992/1993 have been termed series 1.5 cars due to the mix of newer technology (developed for the series 2) with the series 1 vehicle type. One example of this being the alterations to the \"Hydractive\" suspension system on such cars. Early vehicles (series 1) had a system that could be switched from 'Comfort' to 'Sport' mode, this did exactly what you would expect and firmed up the suspension on flicking the switch but this made for a harsh ride which Citro\u00ebn owners don't like. So Citro\u00ebn developed \"Hydractive 2\" suspension (for series 2 vehicles) that although in essence was the same it worked differently, it still had to two states 'hard' and 'soft' but the switching was controlled differently. In general smooth gentle driving the suspension would be in 'soft' mode (\"Normal\" mode according to Citro\u00ebn on series 2 vehicles) which utilized all 6 suspension spheres and allowed 'crossflow' of fluid from side to side producing the characteristic wafting ride, but as soon as the suspension ECU sensed a large or sudden change in one of the sensors it would put the suspension into 'hard' mode locking out the extra centre spheres and stopping the 'crossflow' of fluid, this dramatically firmed up the suspension and cut body roll, as soon as the vehicle stabilized the ECU would switch the suspension system back into 'soft' mode. This is the basis of \"Hydractive 2\", a soft cosseting ride all the time unless the conditions demand otherwise, switching a \"Hydractive 2\" vehicle into \"Sport\" mode doesn't just switch out the extra spheres as with \"Hydractive 1\", it simply just narrows the parameters that cause the suspension to go into 'hard' mode and keeps the suspension in that mode for longer before defaulting back to 'soft' mode. So a series 1.5 vehicle has the styling of a series 1 but with some of the suspension refinements of the series 2 vehicles. There are other detail changes to the actual implementation of the \"Hydractive\" but unless you are maintaining the vehicle yourself these are unimportant.\n\n==Critical appraisal==\nThe XM was reviewed by numerous automotive magazines during the course of its life. These reviews were generally favorable, if inconsistent, particularly concerning the car's ride quality and appearance. Eventually, reviewers had set up a vicious circle where the car was criticized for not selling and this was offered as a reason not to buy one.\n\nThe suspension, for example, was praised by ''Car'' during testing in 1989 when \u201cthe XM showed the most exceptional side of its character. The new big Citro\u00ebn has the finest suspension of any car yet made, as well as the most advanced\u201d.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">CAR Magazine June 1989, page 103-109</ref> ''Autocar'' compared the XM 3.0 V6 to the BMW 535 and Rover 800 (2.6 litre V6) and found that the XM's suspension allowed \"some bump combinations\" to bring \"unexpected reactions from the suspension\" but concluded the XM presented a \"remarkable display of chassis competence\".<ref>Autocar, 19 August 1989, page 41</ref>'\n\n''Performance Car'' commended the suspension's suppleness but also noted firmness over small surfaces irregularities.<ref>Simister, J., (1989) ''Performance Car'', July.</ref> Autocar <ref>\"Assault on the establishment\". ''Autocar'', Jan 30, 1991, page 35.</ref> contrasted the car's competence at \"controlling wheel and body motion when traversing bumps and dips\" but there were some instances when the vehicle's pliancy was \"mediocre\" by provoking \"annoying harshness through the body shell\". In 1994 the XM was described as a car \u201cthat floats the car over foundation bumps, though it deals less smoothly with surface abrasions\u201d.<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\">The Independent. 1994-07-30. https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/motoring/motoring-time-for-some-tough-torque--roger-bell-is-impressed-by-the-muscular-new-citroen-xm-25td-room-to-move-citroens-xm-25td--road-test-1417186.html.

Autocar's conclusion (based on a test of a French specification 3.0-litre V6 model and a 2.0-litre four)) was that \"the Germans will need to treat this car with a great deal of respect\".<ref name=\"Autocar, 24 May 1989, page 41\">Autocar, 24 May 1989, page 41</ref> The XM was described as having a \"superb ride from a suspension capable of cushioning the worst bumps\".<ref name=\"Autocar, 24 May 1989, page 38\">Autocar, 24 May 1989, page 38</ref> ''Autocar'' said that the Citro\u00ebn had made a \"major advance\"<ref name=\"Autocar, 24 May 1989, page 38\"/> over previous versions of the hydropneumatic suspension system, with the ability of the suspension to stiffen up and provide \"precise and responsive handling\".<ref name=\"Autocar, 24 May 1989, page 38\"/> The interior was described as \"roomy\", with German competitors seeming \"decidedly cramped\" by comparison. Only the [[Ford Scorpio]] was deemed to rival the XM in passenger accommodation but \"even it can't match the XM's comfort levels with its deep, high mounted cushion and tall backrest offering a rare level of opulence\".<ref name=\"Autocar, 24 May 1989, page 38\"/> The interior build quality was praised and the interior cabin was \"agreeable\". The driver's seats were \"supportive and comfortable\". The low waist gave the car \"an incredibly spacious feeling\".<ref name=\"autocar38\" />\n\nIn June 1989, ''CAR Magazine''<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> published a full test of the car in V6 guise. The magazine discussed the difficulty of replacing the [[Citro\u00ebn CX]] and the writer, Gavin Green, reported that managing director Xavier Karcher chose a design consistent with the BX rather than developing the outgoing car's themes. Green commented that \"People will either love or hate the look of the XM for, like any car that inspires strong feelings, the CX-successor is distinctive. For that, if nothing else, Citro\u00ebn deserve credit\". He described the appearance as \"displeasing\" with an \"awkward, kicked-up hip-line\". Green reported the XM's directional stability in \"gale force winds\" while other cars \"including our own photographic [[Citro\u00ebn BX]] \u2013 nervously {{sic|?|hide=y|side-|stepped}} their way forward ...\" On secondary roads \"the XM showed the most exceptional side of its character. The new big Citro\u00ebn has the finest suspension of any car yet made, as well as the most advanced\". Green's said that \"in soft mode, the car rides just as deftly as a [[Rolls-Royce Motors|Rolls-Royce]], probably better: the suspension feels more compliant than the CX's. In sports setting the XM handles beautifully, far less body roll and pitch than that which betrayed the CX. Only the car's bulk prevents you from staying with the GTis ... It feels like a CX all the same ... there is that same wonderful sense of detachment from the road surface\". The steering was described as inferior to the CX in that the ratio was reduced from 13.5:1 to 17:1, and that the XM has 3.25 turns lock to lock versus 2.5 on the CX. ''CAR'' noted that the interior was \"utterly and depressingly conventional\" other than the single-spoke steering wheel. \"The indicators are sited on a large, self-cancelling stalk, rather than on dainty and ergonomically superior rockers\". The author referred to \"a row of push button switches, all from the PSA parts bin ... scattered just below the steering wheel\".'Photos show two arrays of buttons grouped on an inclined plane, within the radius of the steering wheel. On the credit side \"the XM's cabin is trimmed in attractive plastics and velours of a higher quality than that which used to clothe the CX's interior\". On general assembly: \"Paint finish, panel gaps, general solidity, interior finish \u2013 in every area the XM is streets ahead [of the CX]\". The general roominess was noted, and the visibility was summed up as follows: \"You have a much more panoramic view of the road and scenery in an XM than in a CX. The beltline is very low \u2013 below shoulder level for most drivers \u2013 and the windscreen seems vast.\"\n\nThe conclusion of the article was that \"the XM is a much better car than the CX ... faster, sharper, roomier, better made and more comfortable; it is all these things as well as being distinctive to the eye. It's also the most comfortable car in its class: in absolute terms only a [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] or Rolls-Royce can match it ... It is a far better car than I thought, a far more intriguing car than I feared.\"\n\n''Autocar & Motor'' described the XM's V6 as offering a competitive {{convert|177|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. The reviewer wrote that the engine while benefiting from many technical refinements lacked the \"silky smoothness of a [[BMW]] or a [[Mercedes-Benz]] [in-line] six\".<ref name=\"Autocar, 24 May 1989, page 39\">Autocar & Motor, 24 May 1989, page 39</ref> However, low-end flexibility was \"impressive\" and mid-range response \"strong.\" Overall performance was \"formidable\". Discussing the 2.0-litre variant, Autocar said that when shifting \"you'll find the XM corners with an agility, the steering turning in sharply [...] poise and cornering balance are marvelous; straight line stability is excellent.\" The brakes \"performed superbly\".<ref name=\"Autocar, 24 May 1989, page 41\"/>\n\n''Autocar'''s criticisms related to the \"bland\"<ref name=\"Autocar, 24 May 1989, page 38\"/> frontal styling and the \"awkward\"<ref name=\"Autocar, 24 May 1989, page 39\"/> sharply rising waistline (though overall, Autocar judged the car to be \"elegantly proportioned\"<ref name=\"Autocar, 24 May 1989, page 40\">Autocar, 24 May 1989, page 40</ref>). Noise suppression was also rated mediocre for the V6.<ref name=\"Autocar, 24 May 1989, page 40\"/> However, the 2.0-litre compared favourably to the [[Audi 100]]. The 2.0-litre XM didn't \"feel as quick as the figures indicate\".<ref name=\"Autocar, 24 May 1989, page 40\"/>\n\nIn August 1989, ''Autocar & Motor'' did a group test of the XM versus what it termed the best- and best-selling executive cars in the UK: the BMW 535i and Rover 800 2.6 V6. The XM's cabin was described as being of \"near Germanic quality\" and \"spacious\", airier than the BMW but less luxurious that the Rover.<ref>Autocar & Motor, 16 August 1989, page 37</ref> The magazine considered the exterior styling \"more conformist\" but \"still recognisably Citro\u00ebn\". In summing up, ''Autocar'' felt that both Rover and BMW could offer strong competition to the XM. The magazine was impressed with the Rover's V6 and automatic transmission which could be purchased for less by means of selecting carefully from the options list. Whilst the BMW 530i was more expensive than the XM, most of the vehicle's best features (driving position, styling, best chassis) could be found in a cheaper 520i. The XM was not viewed by ''Autocar & Motor'' as the best driver's car,<ref>''Autocar & Motor'', 16 August 1989, page 41.</ref> as it left the driver \"too isolated from the action\". For ''Autocar & Motor'', it was a close second, with the XM as the \"most spacious, practical and comfortable for five [...] solidly built and generally as well finished as the other pair\". ''Autocar & Motor'' decided that good as it was, the XM would have a difficult job winning sales from the established competition.\n\n''Autocar'' tested the 2.0 SEi in November 1989. Their verdict was that the XM was \"an extraordinary looking machine, capable of extraordinary feats\" but said the XM was an \"acquired taste\" though its \"considerable virtues [were] accessible\".<ref name=\"Autocar, 15 November 1989, page 33\">Autocar, 15 November 1989, page 33</ref> The 2-litre XU-series engine came in for the most criticism. ''Autocar'' described its performance and economy as being disappointing, \"standing at odds with the smoothness and finesse that seem to be so much a part of the car\".<ref>Autocar, 15 November 1989, page 33.</ref> The magazine listed the XM 2.0 SEi's rivals as being the [[BMW 5 Series (E34)|BMW E34 520SE]], [[Ford Scorpio|Ford Granada Scorpio]] 2.0i, [[Mercedes Benz W124|Mercedes Benz 200E]] Auto, the [[Rover 820]] Si and the [[Vauxhall Carlton]] 2.0i CDX. ''Autocar'' judged the Rover (launched in 1986) to be the best buy in the class, based on its low price, the performance of its engine, its \"attractive\" shape, cruising ability and standard equipment.<ref name=\"Autocar, 15 November 1989, page 33\"/>\n\n''[[What Car]]'' tested the XM 2.0 (8v) Si against the [[Renault 25]] GTX, [[Lancia Thema]] CDi and [[Saab 9000]] 2.0 16v.<ref>'What Car' September 1989 Page 52-59, Page 62</ref> The XM came second overall. The magazine summarized its test as follows \"The XM is an impressive car in many respects, particularly in its excellent interior spaciousness, and for the confirmed Citro\u00ebn enthusiast the oleo pneumatic suspension, super sharp steering and brakes will be a major attraction. It's a great long distance cruiser but is let down by mediocre outright performance. Many will consider the XM to have outstanding elegance and style, a brilliant car that stands out among the current crop of jelly-mould, computer-designs. Others will be put off in the first ten minutes by what they see as the oversharp steering and brakes.\" Concerning the ride quality, What Car noted that while the overall ride was of a high quality, the XM was unable to absorb short, sharp irregularities.<ref>'What Car' September 1989 Page 55.</ref>\n\nIn January 1990 UK's Car Magazine ran a comparison of the 2.0 Si against the [[BMW 5 Series (E34)|BMW 520i]] and [[Lancia Thema]] 16V 2.0<ref>CAR Magazine, January 1990</ref> in a review of lower-end executive sector cars. The article says, \"Citro\u00ebn expects business buyers to account for 80% of the 9000 XMs it hopes to shift in 1990... This is the middle trim level of a range that is extremely well-equipped, presumably as an inducement to forget your preconceptions.\" CAR called the XM \"a rather exotic dish for executives raised on a staple of Granadas, Carltons, Rovers.\" The theme of polarizing styling was repeated in the 1990 review: \"Anyone who feared that Citro\u00ebn's individuality might perish in [[PSA Group]]'s drive for increased sales and profitability will be heartened by the XM. There's a touch of love it or loathe it about the styling, but there's no denying that it is striking.\" The slim [[Valeo]] headlamps design helped to make feasible the \"low, penetrating front end\" styling. While the Citro\u00ebn had a drag coefficient of 0.28, the BMW 520's was 0.30 and the Lancia's was 0.32. The article explained that the UK market XM's were not fitted with the self-centering power-steering because \"buyers here don't like it.\" Regarding performance, the Lancia recorded a 0\u201360&nbsp;mph time of 9.6 seconds versus 12.4 for the Citro\u00ebn and 10.6 for the BMW. The Thema was \"the most mettlesome of the trio\" due to sharp throttle responses and engine sound quality. The XM was marked down for the coarseness of the 2.0-litre XU series engine which was \"rough and noisy. There's no pleasure to be gained from revving it hard. Yet this is precisely what you must do to proceed with any sort of haste.\" Performance was reckoned to be \"par for the class. Above 80 mph acceleration falls off dramatically, a victim of a tall top gear.\" The fuel economy of all three cars was considered \"poor\" under test conditions. The XM's braking action was \"the least satisfactory of the group.\" Under roadholding, \"the XM introduces a new motoring experience to those who don't work as engineers on active ride projects \u2013 the flat cornering attitude. In medium speed bends, the XM scurries around with little discernable body roll, wheels upright and all four tyres planted firmly on the tarmac. Body roll isn't entirely cancelled out, though as Hydractive doesn't act as an anti-roll bar, it merely stiffens spring and damper rates. In tight, fast corners the XM leans like any conventional car. When grip from the XM's 195/60 [[Michelin MXV2]]s runs out the Citro\u00ebn starts to understeer gently. The tail can feel a bit light if you lift off part of the way around the corner, but it's a sensation that doesn't develop into anything more sinister.\" The steering was criticized for lack of feel at high speeds. The XM cabin was praised for its solid quality and roominess though the Lancia was reckoned to be as wide and had as much front head room and rear legroom. The BMW was comparatively less spacious. \"Rear seat riders are best off in the XM, where they enjoy the most headroom of the group ... put the centre armrest down, and there is a soft armchair quality to the seats. The front chairs are similar, yet they manage to locate you well when pressing on, and remain comfortable on long journeys.\" About the ride quality the reviewer wrote that \"the XM's ride quality is a big disappointment, especially at low speeds. Fractured urban road surfaces make it thud noisily, while it pummels rather than absorbs, the contusions. It's jittery around town and will slap its tyres over ridges. A BX feels more composed in the same conditions. At higher speeds the XM is more impressive.\" In comparison, the BMW was reckoned to have a \"ride superior to that of the Citro\u00ebn.\" There were \"occasional flashes of brilliance from the XM's chassis, but for the majority of the time it is outshone by the BMW.\" Under driver appeal, the relatively thick a-pillar, foot-operated park brake and obstructed passenger-side mirror came in for criticism. To drive the car \"practice is required to drive it fluidly.\" On the inside \"the XM's cabin is cossetting and is a relaxing place to spend a full day of motorway driving. The quality of trim is easily the best ever to adorn a Citro\u00ebn, and looks plusher than that of the plainer BMW.\" The conclusion of the article was that the BMW won the test against \"all comers in the 2.0 litre class\", primarily for its completeness and engineering quality. But \"in spite of its faults you can't help be intrigued by the XM. You get the feeling that there is a lot to be learned about the car over an extended period of ownership, a hidden facet that can only be revealed by familiarity. And there's the satisfaction of driving a car that looks so distinctive.\" Reported fuel consumption for the cars at {{convert|75|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} were: Citro\u00ebn {{convert|34.9|mpgimp|L/100 km mpgus|abbr=on}}, Lancia {{convert|34.4|mpgimp|L/100 km mpgus|abbr=on}} and BMW {{convert|32.1|mpgimp|L/100 km mpgus|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn March 1990 ''[[Autocar & Motor]]''<ref>Autocar & Motor, 28 March 1990 pages 46\u201351</ref> reviewed the 2.0 turbo diesel variant, labelled Turbo SD. The car's plus points were its economy, space, excellent ride and handling. The negative aspects of the XM were the slow turbo response, engine refinement and gearchange. In detail, ''Autocar & Motor'' described the instrumentation as \"excellent\" and the accommodation as \"generous.\" The chassis was judged to be \"superb, combining fail-safe handling with a pliant ride\".<ref>Autocar & Motor, 28 March 1990, page 49</ref> Ventilation through-put was described as \"excellent\". The overall the ride quality was commended as \"almost unbeatable\" for its capacity to \"swallow up persistent motorway undulations almost as if they didn't exist\" and to \"spit out surface imperfections as if they didn't exist\".<ref>Autocar & Motor, 28 March 1990, page 48</ref> It was admitted that though not often there were conditions the XM's suspension handled less well. These were transverse ridges or some instances where \"some surfaces produce an unpleasant rocking or pitching motion\"<ref>Autocar & Motor, 28 March 1990 page 48</ref> In summary, Autocar & Motor's view was that \"in turbodiesel form, the XM is a fast and effortless long-distance tourer that was always return excellent economy of such a roomy car. Yes, refinement and noise-suppression could be better, and the controls lack the engineered slickness of a BMW or a Mercedes but the XM is a welcome addition to the growing ranks of [[diesel fuel|diesel]]-powered cars and in interesting alternative to conventional [[petrol]]-driven saloons.<ref>Autocar & Motor, 28 March 1990, page 51</ref>\"\n\nCAR magazine tested the diesel variant in July 1990.<ref name=\"citroenet1990\"/> CAR's opinion was that \"a weekend trip to [[Bavaria]] proved this latest addition to the XM range to be a very competent and economical long-hauler. At more moderate British road speeds, we have managed 43mpg in mixed running with four people aboard.\" In this review the car was viewed as being superior to a [[BMW 5 Series]]: \"Early in the trip the car was uncannily smooth over the bumpy back roads between [[Calais]] and [[Dunkirk]]. On German autobahns, travelling at speeds which turn bends into corners, the XM remained impressively flat as the [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] altered to cope with high cornering loads. We made the trip accompanied by a BMW 535i, which rolled appreciably more through fast bends, and passengers who tried both cars preferred the XM.\" Points of criticism were again, the left-side mirror and rear headroom: \" The most serious [problem] is ungenerous rear headroom, though three passengers of average height found the rear bench comfortable for a 12-hour journey. More irritating, because avoidable, is the nearside mirror, which is partially obscured by the A-pillar. This deficiency is particularly noticeable on the continent, when you need the mirror for overtaking.\" The foot-operated parking brake was also criticized: \"... four days weren\u2019t enough to dispel our annoyance with the US-style foot-operated [[parking brake]]. We noted sourly that you would probably fail a driving test in the XM, because you cannot apply the brake (using your left foot) until you have put the car in neutral.\" In conclusion, CAR's view was that \"the XM is a car that grows on you, and in Turbo Diesel form, it's cheap to operate. If you're contemplating high mileages, particularly abroad where diesel is sensibly priced much cheaper than petrol, it\u2019s well worth considering the stiff extra price of the oil-burner. If you care about reducing [[carbon dioxide]] emissions by improving fuel consumption, the XM Turbo Diesel offers dramatic gains without sacrificing big-car virtues.\"\n\nTested by ''Autocar'' against the Alfa Romeo Cloverleaf V6, the V6 version of the XM was placed ahead, but the car was described as \"an uneven performer - high ability but somewhat retarded in the finesse department\".<ref>\"Assault on the establishment\". Autocar, January 30, 1991, page 35</ref> Reservations related to the gear change and the ride quality over rough road surfaces.\n\nIn February 1991, Car Magazine<ref>Car Magazine, February 1991.</ref> tested the XM in V6 form alongside ten other executive cars ([[Alfa Romeo 164]] V6 Lusso, BMW 525i 24v, [[Ford Scorpio]] 2.9 EFi, [[Jaguar XJ6]] 3.2, Mercedes Benz 260E, [[Peugeot 605]] 3.0 SVE, [[Rover Sterling]], [[Saab 9000]] CDs 2.3 turbo, [[Vauxhall Senator]] CD 3.0i and [[Volvo 960]] 3.0i-24). The winner was the Jaguar with the XM in second place. The summary was that \"... the Citro\u00ebn in second place impressed us enormously. The XM is the most advanced car here, the precursor of even better things to come. Such are the Citro\u00ebn's accomplishments that we'd have put it first had its refinement measured up that of the [[Peugeot]] stablemate.\" The Peugeot shared the same engine as the Citro\u00ebn but in the Peugeot installation it was more refined and less \"inexplicably throbby.\" In terms of styling CAR preferred the originality of the XM to the anonymity of the Peugeot: \"criticize the fussy, multi-pillared super-structure if you will but the XM eschews convention and for that we applaud this individualistic car.\" For performance, the XM was praised for its robust acceleration (9.3 seconds to 60&nbsp;mph ) and its top speed (133&nbsp;mph). Under roadholding and handling: \"Hydractive suspension engenders unique feel, making the XM like no other car. Sharp steering and limpet cornering give uncanny responses, modest body roll and terrific composure. Torque steer seldom a problem. Brakes strong and sensitive.\" The report for the accommodation and comfort noted that the instrument dials were too small and that minor switches were mounted too low, out of sight (they are inside the radius of the steering wheel). The [[hatchback]] boot was described as \"massive\" and \"can be extended by folding the seats.\" The XM interior was described as \"plush, its seats soft, supportive and electric.\" The XM tied with the [[Ford Granada (Europe)|Ford Granada]] for having the most rear-legroom. The rear was described as \"spacious.\" With the head restraint of the front seat set to its minimum height rear passengers enjoyed an uninterrupted view out through the windscreen. The model tested was an automatic and cost 25,330 GBP versus the Jaguar's 27,500 GBP price.\n\nBenchmarked against the [[Mercedes E-class]], CAR rated it as superior in 1991.<ref name=\"Car Magazine, Feb, 1991\"/> When compared to the [[BMW 5 Series]] the same journal considered it both inferior and superior.<ref name=\"CAR Magazine, Jan 1990\"/><ref name=\"citroenet1990\"/> By 1994, the XM was described as a car that \u201cdeals less smoothly with surface abrasions\u201d.<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\"/> Motoring magazine programme ''[[Top Gear (1977 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', reviewing the \"high speed hold-all\" market, compared the XM estate with the [[Audi 100]] in 1991<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kx0v5UDjbw |title=Old Top Gear 1991 \u2013 Citroen XM and Audi 100 estates (Bad Quality) |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=17 December 2011}}</ref> (Season 14, episode 16). The presenter reported Citro\u00ebn's claim that its XM had the world's largest estate loading bay and went on to say: \"with this high rear window line you have truly a vast volume of space hidden from prying eyes.\" The load capacity of the boot was cited as 25 cubic feet with the load bay [[tonneau]] removed, helped by a \"low sill and a spare tyre you get at from underneath.\" The Audi 100 had less concealed load space, a flimsy cover and less load space overall. The Audi's maximum capacity was 44 cubic feet versus the Citro\u00ebn's 69 cubic feet. On driving quality, the XM \"is acknowledged to have one of the finest ride qualities in the world and the estate version is just as good.\" But the minor controls were said to be \"intimidating\" and the high rear window line was criticized for its effect on outward visibility. \"Behind the helm the XM shows itself to be a disarmingly fine car,\" reported the presenter. \"Its poised magic carpet ride and velvetty drive train make for gentle and unruffled progress.\" At autobahn speed the car was said to be able \"to soak up every pimple and declivity without so much as a solitary thud.\" With improved quality, shorter service intervals and good looks the \"[[Top Gear (1977 TV series)|Top Gear]]\" view was that residual values \"should stay healthy.\"\n\nThe 1992 edition of the [[Daily Mail]] Motor review, edited by Michael Kemp<ref>Daily Mail Motor review, 1992, page 17</ref> described the styling as \"modern but sometimes awkward.\" The \"high speed roadholding is disappointing\", but the XM was a \"well equipped and comfortable luxury car with fine engine options.\"\n\nThe revised 2.0 turbo model was tested in February 1993 by ''Autocar''.<ref name=\"Autocar page 54\">Autocar, 24 Feb, page 54.</ref> ''Autocar'''s view was that fitting a turbo-charger avoided turbo lag, but \"there's no mistaking the engine's hesitant nature at low revs, making smooth first gear getaways ... unnecessarily awkward\".<ref name=\"Autocar, 24 Feb, page 55\">Autocar, 24 Feb, page 55.</ref> However, the turbo-charged version was a \"swift performer\"<ref name=\"Autocar, 24 Feb, page 55\"/> with {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} achieved in 8.2 seconds versus the non-turbo's 11.2 seconds. Top speed increased to {{convert|131|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, ahead of the [[Ford Granada (Europe)|Ford Granada]] and [[Vauxhall Carlton]]. The XM was commended for its motorway handling, with low rpms at cruising speed and \"excellent\"<ref name=\"Autocar, 24 Feb, page 55\"/> overtaking ability. Engine noise was reduced, addressing earlier criticisms. The ride was improved by a recalibration of the engine's mounting points. In summary, \"add this new found refinement and performance to the XM's other strengths, most noticeably its superb ride and excellent cabin space, and you'd be hard pushed to find a better motorway mile-eater.\" All in all, the revisions to the XM left it in a \"much more competitive position\".<ref name=\"Autocar page 54\"/>\n\nIn July 1994, Roger Bell of the UK's ''Independent'' tested the 2.5-litre turbodiesel variant of the XM.<ref>\n{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/motoring/motoring-time-for-some-tough-torque--roger-bell-is-impressed-by-the-muscular-new-citroen-xm-25td-room-to-move-citroens-xm-25td--road-test-1417186.html |title=Motoring: Time for some tough torque \u2013 Roger Bell is impressed by the muscular new Citroen XM 2.5TD Room to move: Citroen's XM 2.5TD / Road Test \u2013 Motoring \u2013 Life & Style |publisher=The Independent |date=30 July 1994 |accessdate=17 December 2011 |location=London}}</ref> He said that \"the introduction of a new high-torque diesel is among a range of sales-boosting improvements made by Citro\u00ebn to its flagging flagship, still shunned by the British as a Gallic oddity.\" The pricing and equipment were viewed as competitive. The comfort and roominess were praised, but comments on the drive quality focused on the idiosyncrasies. Even though the steering ratio was much reduced compared to the CX, Bell still considered it over-direct and said that \"clumsy drivers should look elsewhere\". Roger Bell's conclusion was that \"anyone in the market for a big, roomy, comfortable car that goes well on little fuel would be foolish to ignore it. Apart from being good value, the XM is one of the last true 'characters' left in a market of lookalikes.\" Fuel economy of 40 mpg was reported for this test.\n\nIn May 1995, John Simister of ''CAR''<ref name=\"Car, May 1995 p94-104\"/> tested the revised XM 2.0 VSX against the [[Alfa Romeo 164]] 2.0 T-Spark, [[Ford Scorpio]] 2.0 16V [[Ghia]] and [[Vauxhall Omega]] 2.0 GLS 16V. The article highlighted an entirely new iteration of the Omega and the recent launch of the [[Ford Scorpio]]. Simister introduced the XM as the \"daring maverick of the quartet, technically and aesthetically.<ref name=\"Car, May 1995 p94-104\"/>\" Due to its hydraulic steering, brakes and suspension the XM was recognized as having \"a different feel.\" The conclusion of the test highlighted the XM's uneven capabilities and also the extent to which the competition was catching up on Citro\u00ebn's unique sales propositions of ride quality and comfort: \"there's a telling generation gap between the two front-drive cars [XM and 164] and the younger rear-drive pair in this confrontation [Scorpio and Omega]\". Though based on the architecture of a much older car, the Mk3 [[Ford Granada (Europe)|Ford Granada]] of 1985, the Scorpio bested the XM on seat comfort and rear legroom. The XM's front seats and cabin ambience did not fare well against the Ford or Vauxhall. However, the turbo-charged Citro\u00ebn beat the Ford on performance. The Alfa was viewed as having the \"sportiest character\" with best handling, but the Citro\u00ebn had better space, comfort, finish and refinement. So a combination of superior speed (compared to the Ford) and comfort (compared to the Alfa) put the XM in second place. The Vauxhall's all-round competence, but particularly its ride, put it in first place. The Vauxhall's suspension was described as \"brilliant. The ride is supple, controlled, well damped ... to obtain such outstanding results through conventional means is to challenge Citro\u00ebn's innovation.<ref name=\"Car, May 1995 p94-104\"/>\" The Opel also boasted accurate steering and \"splendid centre-point responses. No rival turns into corners with greater resolution, bite or fluency.\" The XM's gearchange was described as \"graunchy, downgraded by the mushy clutch.\" And \"despite mid-life refurbishment the XM's dash and switchgear are not up the best.\" The XM was highly rated in steering, it being \"nicely responsive rather than ultra-sharp \u2013 especially at speed, when little more than telepathy is needed to corner with inch-perfect precision.\" In contrast to the Vauxhall and Ford, the Citro\u00ebn's suspension failed to absorb surface abrasions which \"generate high-frequency agitation and knobbliness\".<ref name=\"Car, May 1995 p94-104\"/> However, the oleo-pneumatic suspension could \"waft over foundation irregularities\" better than the competitors. The foot-applied parking brake was described as \"treacherous.\" The luggage capacity of the XM was rated at 460 litres, joint third place with the Ford.\n\nAn unrelated article in the same edition of CAR<ref>Car, May 1995, page 166.</ref> discussed the sales performance of large, diesel cars in the UK market in the previous year. The [[Volkswagen Passat]] was ranked first and the XM took eighth place. Under the category \"Could Do Better Department\" the XM was described as a \"technofest.\" The unnamed author exhorted readers as follows: \"Listen people, they're fab, so try one.\"\n\nDiscussing the merits of turbo-diesels, the [[Glasgow Herald]] described the car in mid-1996 in the following way: \"The Citro\u00ebn XM in turbo diesel form is a splendid long-legged autoroute car.<ref>{{cite web|author=Custom byline text:&nbsp; From the archive |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/the-turbo-touch-transforms-a-diesel-1.448486 |title=Accessed Dec 21, 2011 |publisher=Heraldscotland.com |date=27 June 1996 |accessdate=22 December 2011}}</ref> \" The same edition of the Glasgow Herald summarised the car as \"a fine motorway cruiser, with unexpectedly good handling around the lanes, and masses of space for passengers and luggage.<ref>{{cite web| first = Ross | last = Finlay |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/exclusive-can-be-elusive-1.448428 |title=Accessed Dec 21, 2011 |publisher=Heraldscotland.com |date=27 June 1996 |accessdate=22 December 2011}}</ref> \"\n\nThe view of the [[Daily Express]] World Car Guide 1998 was that the XM was \"as distinctive an executive class car as it's possible to find.\" The interior was described as \"huge.\" The news for that model year was the replacement of the 12-valve 3.0-litre V6 with a 24-valve 3.0-litre V6 that was used in the [[Citro\u00ebn Xantia]].<ref>{{citation | title = [[Daily Express]] World Car Guide, 1998 | ref = DEWC98 | date = 1998 | page = 30 | editor-last = Burgess | editor-first = Peter }}</ref> The Guide commented that the interior was looking dated, but it was described as a \"thoroughly relaxing drive.\"\n\nThe [[Daily Express]] World Car Guide 1999 said \"Citro\u00ebn's largest car is also the most quirky.\" But the XM \"is not without its qualities though, with a smooth ride and mile-munching motorway ability.\"<ref>{{citation | title = [[Daily Express]] World Car Guide, 1999 | ref = DEWC99 | date = 1999 | page = 35 | editor-last = Burgess | editor-first = Peter }}</ref> The depreciation to which the car was prone had become part of the car's identity in many reviews. Typical is \"only a few hundred are sold and values plummet on the used market.\" The 2.1- and 2.5-litre diesels were said to be \"stars of the range with economy and reasonable performance.\" In contrast to earlier reviews, the Guide thought the interiors were \"fragile.\" But the ergonomics remained a point of criticism: \"the interior takes some getting used to.\" Referring to the load carrying capacity of the estate, the Guide said the car was \"capable of carrying more than some vans.\"\n\nBy September 2000 <ref name=\"CAR Magazine, September 2000\"/> the Citro\u00ebn XM's press visibility had diminished. CAR magazine's GBU section was one of the last places it was reviewed. The summary was that the XM as \"an ancient intergalactic cruiser reminds us of what Citro\u00ebn used to be. Bertone's needle-nosed styling is wearing quite well, and comfy, spacious cabin a pleasure on top of the hydraulic chassis. Quite good in diesel and turbo forms ... Estate an unbeatable load carrier but at a decade old this monster is best avoided.\"\n\nCAR magazine's final article on the XM was from November 2000.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The \"Parting Shot\" series was known for its unequivocally harsh stance so the commentary in that tradition was almost wholly negative. The article in question, by Richard Bremner, focused on the issue of the defective electrical connectors: \"Early XMs could be relied upon to go wrong, but little else. And often the cause of the trouble could be pinpointed to one component \u2013 a defective electrical connector\". The result of this reputation was that people \"stayed away in droves, even if some got cars that gave no trouble at all.\" The article noted that \"Citro\u00ebn worked hard at fixing the problems, introducing a new kind of connector after the car was launched, but by then the XM had lost almost all connections with its potential audience.\" The article conceded that a changed market also made conditions difficult for the XM: \"While the CX before it sold well to successful types who needed something big and futuristic, by the time the XM came along their thoughts were turning towards the slickly packaged prestige of [[BMW]] and [[Mercedes-Benz|Benz]]. The market for big cars from volume makers was dying\". Bremner pointed out that it was going to be difficult for any modern Citro\u00ebn to be great. \"What it really needed to be, however unreasonable it is to expect one car company to keep delivering it, was a new concept in big car design, something as radical as the [[Renault Espace]]. But the XM was not that and it has died unloved and destined, one suspects, to become very rare very soon\".\n\nThe XM has a mixed reputation in its post-production twilight. Discussing bargain used cars, the [[Glasgow Herald]] wrote in 1999<ref>{{cite web| first = James | last = Currie |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/bargains-on-a-plate-1.275038 |title=Accessed Dec 21 2011 |publisher=Heraldscotland.com |date=27 August 1999 |accessdate=22 December 2011}}</ref> that the XM has \"a solid reputation, smooth engines, plenty of street presence and lots of room for people and luggage.\" But, writing in the [[Daily Telegraph]] in September 2005,<ref>{{cite news|first = Andrew | last = English |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/carreviews/2737359/Citroen-a-Grande-Vitesse.html |title=Citro\u00ebn \u00e0 Grande Vitesse |publisher=Telegraph |date= 17 September 2005|accessdate=17 December 2011 |location=London}}</ref> Andrew English led his discussion on the [[Citro\u00ebn C6]] with this comment: \"It has been 17 years since Citro\u00ebn last introduced a large car. The slab-of-cheese-like XM that went out of production in 2000 was a mockery of the idea, however. Not just in the coincidence of its design house's name, [[Gruppo Bertone|Bertone]], with that of [[Flaminio Bertoni]], who penned the beautiful and elegant DS models in the 1950s, but also for its staggering unreliability\". When reviewing the [[Citro\u00ebn C6]] in 2006, [[The Irish Times]] referred to the marked improvement in the quality of the new vehicle compared to its predecessor: \"unlike previous big Citro\u00ebns, such as the XM, the C6 has a feel of quality in its fit and finish\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/motors/2006/0823/1155714925772.html |title=Accessed Dec 21 2011 |publisher=Irishtimes.com |date=23 August 2006 |accessdate=22 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nBritain's Classic & Sportscar<ref name=\"Classic pp 144-151\">Classic & Sportscar, July 2010 pp 144\u2013151</ref> published an essay on Citro\u00ebn's large cars, from DS to C6. The tone is more charitable, but still refers to a car with a reputation \"tarnished by complexity\". For comparison purposes a Series 2 XM in 2.1-litre diesel configuration was presented. The article's contention was that the XM was intended to compete with the ascendant German marques. The article views the car's design as influenced strongly by the [[Citro\u00ebn SM]] and calls it \"the world's most subtle retro design.\" On interior (a series 2 which resembles the Xantia's), the author says \"the black cabin is a little dour, but there are playful touches, too, such as the black strip of smoked plastic behind the wheel, from which warning lights<ref name=\"Classic pp 144-151\"/> emerge and vanish.\" Turning to the driving quality, the author remarks, \"you'll find a confidence not always present in its ancestors. There's little [[understeer]], the brakes are more conventionally controlled and the 2.1-litre turbocharged unit has ample torque for cannoning the XM from bend to bend. The bump-eliminating suspension ... still features \u2013 you'll barely notice cattle grids \u2013 but with it comes a firmness more orientated towards the sporting driver.\"\n\nThe UK-based car review website Honest John<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.honestjohn.co.uk/carbycar/citroen/xm-1990/ |title=XM 1990 &#124; Citroen &#124; Car Reviews |publisher=Honest John |date=1 December 2011 |accessdate=17 December 2011}}</ref> summarises the XM, as a used purchase, as \"Comfortable and spacious, especially the estate. Excellent ride and tidy handling. Plenty of potential problems, so buy with care and find an experienced XM specialist.\"\n\nThe used-car website Compucars<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.compucars.co.uk/car-reviews/citroen/xm/ |title=Accessed Dec 15, 2011 |location=GB |publisher=Compucars.co.uk |date=19 October 2006 |accessdate=17 December 2011}}</ref> views the XM as \"surprisingly good to drive thanks to that suspension system. You find yourself relishing country B roads, despite the car's obvious bulk. You need to be careful with the foot-operated parking brake though. A lever on the dashboard, which can take some getting used to, releases it.\" The overall impression of the car, according to Compucars is: \"Gallic charm with attitude. The XM makes a pleasant change from normal executive fare. Buy carefully and enjoy.\"\n\n==Headlight issues==\nComponents supplier Valeo designed the XM's lamps and a similar design was used on the [[Eagle Premier]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://papers.sae.org/970901 |title=Complex Shape Headlamps:Eight Years of Experience |publisher=Papers.sae.org |date=24 February 1997 |accessdate=22 December 2011}}</ref> The goal of the design was to reduce the size of the lamps and to increase their output. The XM's new \"complex surface\" [[headlamp]]s were not powerful enough on dipped beam,<ref>{{cite web|first=Julian|last=Marsh |url=http://www.citroenet.org.uk/passenger-cars/psa/xm/xm-11.html |title=Citro\u00ebn XM headlamp complaints |publisher=Citroenet.org.uk |date=10 June 2000 |accessdate=10 October 2010}}</ref> though main beam was perfectly adequate. This could be traced to the use of a plastic optical element between the bulb and the outer lens, which yellowed with age.\n\nThe XM was not alone here; early [[Ford Mondeo]]s suffered from the same problem.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Series 2 (from mid-1994 onwards) [[Right- and left-hand traffic|LHD]] XMs had improved light units without the plastic element, but slow [[United Kingdom]] sales meant these were never fitted to [[Right- and left-hand traffic|RHD]] forms. Headlamp retrofit kits using dual or triple round optics are available from third party suppliers, though this changes the aesthetics of the car. Series 1 cars can be fitted with series 2 headlights.\n\n==US import==\n[[File:Citroen XM Hatchback.JPG|thumb|left|Citro\u00ebn XM hatchback (US)]]\nThe XM was imported into the United States by CXA, a company that had imported several hundred [[Citro\u00ebn CX|CX25]] GTi and Prestige model cars for Citro\u00ebn [[fan (aficionado)|loyalists]] in the USA.\n\nCxAuto presented the XM at the 1991 [[New York International Auto Show|New York Motor Show]], in the spring of 1991 and began converting and selling the XM Pallas (combined with the 2.0 injection engine) and the XM Vitesse (combined with the 3.0 V6 engine). In 1993, the XM Exclusive was added to the range. Unfortunately, the XM cost 40% more than the CX Prestige, with a price in excess of $50,000 and only a few examples were sold. As a result of newer, tougher US anti-pollution standards, the import of these cars ceased in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citroenet.org.uk/foreign/usa/90-01.html |title=1990 CxAuto XM Vitesse advertisement |publisher= |date= |accessdate=13 December 2011}}</ref> XM parts must be sent over from Europe.\n\n== Chinese production ==\n{{Clear}}The Citro\u00ebn XM, along with the Citro\u00ebn Xantia were assembled in a form of CKD in Huizhou, Guangdong province.

These two cities combined were part of Farmington Township in the time of the Northwest Territory. Features of the community include a recently renovated downtown, boutiques, a vintage cinema, numerous restaurants, exotic car dealerships, art galleries, and public parks including Heritage Park. There are several historical sites including the Longacre House and the [[Fred M. Warner|Governor Warner]] Mansion. Both cities are served by [[Farmington Public Schools (Michigan)|Farmington Public Schools]]. \n\nFarmington Hills is the home of the [[Holocaust Memorial Center]], the only Holocaust Memorial in the State of Michigan. The Center's mission is to educate the public about the tragedy and evils of the Holocaust.  The Holocaust Memorial Center was originally located in neighboring West Bloomfield Township, but has since expanded and moved to its current facility.<ref>[http://www.holocaustcenter.org Farmington Hills Holocaust Memorial Center website], holocaustcenter.org; accessed June 26, 2015.</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|33.31|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|33.28|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.03|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=2012-11-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archive-date=2012-01-25 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe first white settler in what became Farmington Township was a [[Quaker]] from [[Farmington, New York]], named Arthur Power. He purchased land in 1823 and returned in 1824 with a group of families and associates to clear the land. The settlement became known as '''Quakertown'''. A post office was established in February 1826 with the name of Farmington. The original post office is still standing today, and is a designated [[historical site]]. The township of Farmington was organized in 1827, and the settlement was incorporated as the village of [[Farmington, Michigan|Farmington]] in the winter of 1866\u201367. A fire on October 9, 1872 destroyed many buildings in the village center. Farmington was incorporated as a city in 1926.\n\nA small settlement was also developed in '''Clarenceville''', in the extreme southeast corner of the township on the boundary with [[Livonia, Michigan|Livonia]] in [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]]. Stephen Jennings built a tavern and a general store to accommodate travelers on the plank road between Detroit and Howell. The name remains in the [[Clarenceville School District]]. Even though the school buildings for Clarenceville are in Livonia in Wayne County, the school district serves a portion of Farmington Hills.\n\nIn 1847, a post office named '''North Farmington''' was established a mile south of the township line as Wolcott's Corners. After the death of postmaster Chauncey D. Walcott in 1865, the office moved to the township line in the northeast quarter of [[section (United States land surveying)|section]] 4 (near the intersection of 14 Mile Road and Farmington Road). The post office functioned until September 1902.<ref name=\"Romig\">{{cite book | last = Romig | first = Walter  | year = 1986 | title = Michigan Place Names | origyear= 1973 | publisher = Wayne State University Press | location = Detroit, Michigan | isbn = 0-8143-1838-X}}</ref>\n\nIn 1839, a post office named '''East Farmington''' was opened, but it closed in 1842.<ref>Romig, ''Michigan Place Names'', p. 169</ref>\n\nBefore the remainder of Farmington Township was incorporated as the city of Farmington Hills, there were two other incorporated entities within its boundaries. The first began as a subdivision named Quaker Valley Farms that was incorporated as the village of Quakertown in 1959. The other was Wood Creek Farms, developed in 1937 as a subdivision by George Wellington of Franklin, who named it after a [[New England]] estate. It was incorporated as a village in 1957.<ref name=\"Romig\" /> The villages, together with the remainder of Farmington Township, were incorporated into the City of Farmington Hills in 1973.\n\n==Economy==\n{{See also|Economy of metropolitan Detroit}}\n[[File:Hitachi Automotive Systems Americas Offices Farmington Hills Michigan.JPG|thumb|[[Hitachi]] Automotive Systems Americas Offices]]\n[[Gale (publisher)|Gale]], an educational publishing company owned by [[Cengage Learning]], and the auto loan company [[TD Auto Finance]], are located in Farmington Hills.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gale.com/contact/|title=Contact and Support|publisher=Gale |accessdate=February 28, 2020}}</ref> \n\nThe [[Nissan]] Technical Center North America  and Nissan Trading Corp. are located in Farmington Hills.<ref>\"[http://www.nissanusa.com/about/corporate-info/nissan-in-north-america.html Nissan in North America] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116235448/http://www.nissanusa.com/about/corporate-info/nissan-in-north-america.html |date=2012-11-16 }}.\" ''[[Nissan]]''.

The city council appoints a [[City Manager]] (currently: Dave Boyer), who manages the day-to-day operations of the city; a [[City Clerk]] who maintains all City Codes, Ordinances, Resolutions and other legal documents (currently Pam Smith); and a [[City Attorney]] who acts as legal advisor and representative for all City matters (currently Steve Joppich).\n\nFarmington Hills is neighbor to [[Farmington, Michigan|Farmington]]. Together, the cities form a district represented in Michigan's State House District 37 by Democrat [[Christine Greig]]. Farmington Hills is part of State Senate District 14, represented by Democrat [[Brenda Lawrence]].\n\nThe Mayor's Youth Council is an active teen committee/council who work under the city to help address teen problems and issues. This council helped to build the Riley Skate Park (the largest skate park in the Midwest), and sends delegates to the [[National League of Cities]] (NLC) conferences, has articles published in the local newspaper, helps run citywide events, organizes battle of the bands, and hosts their own talk show.\nThe Commission for Children, Youth and Families - operated in partnership with neighboring Farmington - is dedicated to creating a welcoming community for individuals of all ages and backgrounds.  With a special emphasis on volunteerism, community service and education, the Commission partners with the Multi-Racial Multi-Cultural Commission (MRMC), the Commission on Aging, Farmington Public School District and the Farmington Public Library to inform residents on a variety of quality-of-life issues designed to promote wellness, access and knowledge.\n\nIn 2006, a public meeting was held in Farmington Hills to discuss the possible merger of the two cities as a money saving venture, and also as a way to keep the two communities vibrant. Farmington and Farmington Hills already share several services, such as a school district, a library system and a district court, however, both cities utilize their own fire departments, and Farmington has a public safety department rather than a police department.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1980= 58056\n|1990= 74611\n|2000= 82111\n|2010= 79740\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=81093\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 22, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=2018 Estimate<ref name=\"2018 Pop Estimate\">{{cite web|title=Population Estimates|url=https://census.gov/data/tables/2018/demo/popest/total-cities-and-towns.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=June 8, 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAccording to a 2015 estimate, the median income for a household in the city was $93,274, and the median income for a family was $198,136.

There are several historical sites including the Longacre House and the [[Fred M. Warner|Governor Warner]] Mansion. Both cities are served by [[Farmington Public Schools (Michigan)|Farmington Public Schools]]. \n\nFarmington Hills is the home of the [[Holocaust Memorial Center]], the only Holocaust Memorial in the State of Michigan.

He purchased land in 1823 and returned in 1824 with a group of families and associates to clear the land. The settlement became known as '''Quakertown'''. A post office was established in February 1826 with the name of Farmington. The original post office is still standing today, and is a designated [[historical site]]. The township of Farmington was organized in 1827, and the settlement was incorporated as the village of [[Farmington, Michigan|Farmington]] in the winter of 1866\u201367. A fire on October 9, 1872 destroyed many buildings in the village center. Farmington was incorporated as a city in 1926.\n\nA small settlement was also developed in '''Clarenceville''', in the extreme southeast corner of the township on the boundary with [[Livonia, Michigan|Livonia]] in [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]]. Stephen Jennings built a tavern and a general store to accommodate travelers on the plank road between Detroit and Howell. The name remains in the [[Clarenceville School District]]. Even though the school buildings for Clarenceville are in Livonia in Wayne County, the school district serves a portion of Farmington Hills.\n\nIn 1847, a post office named '''North Farmington''' was established a mile south of the township line as Wolcott's Corners. After the death of postmaster Chauncey D. Walcott in 1865, the office moved to the township line in the northeast quarter of [[section (United States land surveying)|section]] 4 (near the intersection of 14 Mile Road and Farmington Road). The post office functioned until September 1902.<ref name=\"Romig\">{{cite book | last = Romig | first = Walter  | year = 1986 | title = Michigan Place Names | origyear= 1973 | publisher = Wayne State University Press | location = Detroit, Michigan | isbn = 0-8143-1838-X}}</ref>\n\nIn 1839, a post office named '''East Farmington''' was opened, but it closed in 1842.<ref>Romig, ''Michigan Place Names'', p. 169</ref>\n\nBefore the remainder of Farmington Township was incorporated as the city of Farmington Hills, there were two other incorporated entities within its boundaries. The first began as a subdivision named Quaker Valley Farms that was incorporated as the village of Quakertown in 1959. The other was Wood Creek Farms, developed in 1937 as a subdivision by George Wellington of Franklin, who named it after a [[New England]] estate. It was incorporated as a village in 1957.<ref name=\"Romig\" /> The villages, together with the remainder of Farmington Township, were incorporated into the City of Farmington Hills in 1973.\n\nIn 1964, the city of Farmington started a tradition that became known as the Founders Festival. The festival is held in mid-July each summer, and a fair is held in downtown Farmington which has exhibits of arts and crafts, stage entertainment, street food, friends and family, and a fun atmosphere.\n\n==Economy==\n{{See also|Economy of metropolitan Detroit}}\n[[File:Hitachi Automotive Systems Americas Offices Farmington Hills Michigan.JPG|thumb|[[Hitachi]] Automotive Systems Americas Offices]]\n[[Gale (publisher)|Gale]], an educational publishing company owned by [[Cengage Learning]], and the auto loan company [[TD Auto Finance]], are located in Farmington Hills.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gale.com/contact/|title=Contact and Support|publisher=Gale |accessdate=February 28, 2020}}</ref> \n\nThe [[Nissan]] Technical Center North America  and Nissan Trading Corp. are located in Farmington Hills.<ref>\"[http://www.nissanusa.com/about/corporate-info/nissan-in-north-america.html Nissan in North America] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116235448/http://www.nissanusa.com/about/corporate-info/nissan-in-north-america.html |date=2012-11-16 }}.\" ''[[Nissan]]''.

With a special emphasis on volunteerism, community service and education, the Commission partners with the Multi-Racial Multi-Cultural Commission (MRMC), the Commission on Aging, Farmington Public School District and the Farmington Public Library to inform residents on a variety of quality-of-life issues designed to promote wellness, access and knowledge.\n\nIn 2006, a public meeting was held in Farmington Hills to discuss the possible merger of the two cities as a money saving venture, and also as a way to keep the two communities vibrant. Farmington and Farmington Hills already share several services, such as a school district, a library system and a district court, however, both cities utilize their own fire departments, and Farmington has a public safety department rather than a police department.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1980= 58056\n|1990= 74611\n|2000= 82111\n|2010= 79740\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=81093\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 22, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=2018 Estimate<ref name=\"2018 Pop Estimate\">{{cite web|title=Population Estimates|url=https://census.gov/data/tables/2018/demo/popest/total-cities-and-towns.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=June 8, 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAccording to a 2015 estimate, the median income for a household in the city was $93,274, and the median income for a family was $198,136.

It is part of the [[Salisbury metropolitan area|Salisbury, Maryland-Delaware Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n==History==\nSnow Hill was founded in 1686 in [[Somerset County, Maryland|Somerset County]] by [[England|English]] settlers, who may have named it after a street and neighborhood of the [[City of London]] called \"[[Snow Hill, London|Snow Hill]]\", despite the location's elevation of just {{convert|16|ft}} above sea level and the infrequency of snowfall. The town received its first charter on October 26, 1686, and was made a port of entry in 1694.{{citation needed|date = November 2019}}\n\nIn 1742, [[Worcester County, Maryland|Worcester County]] was carved out of the eastern half of old [[Somerset County, Maryland|Somerset County]] and Snow Hill, centrally located in the new county and at the head of navigation on the [[Pocomoke River]], was made the [[County seat|county seat]].{{citation needed|date = November 2019}}\n\nMajor fires in 1844 and 1893 destroyed the center of Snow Hill, including two successive [[Courthouse|Court Houses]], although some eighteenth century structures survived both fires. Following the second fire, much of the commercial area was rapidly rebuilt, so the downtown today contains many historic buildings of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  The Snow Hill [[Historic district (United States)#Local-level|Historic District]], which includes approximately 80% of the town, was created in 2002.{{citation needed|date = November 2019}}\n\nIn December 2010, a Snow Hill businessman started a petition to remove the town's incorporation and revert the area to county control. The reasons given were lower county taxes, better services provided to the town, and a need for revitalization. The push was abandoned in January 2011.<ref>http://www.wboc.com/Global/story.asp?S=13935194</ref>\n\nThe [[All Hallows Episcopal Church]], [[Chanceford]], [[Old Friendship United Methodist Church]], [[Samuel Gunn House]], [[Makemie Memorial Presbyterian Church]], [[James Martin House (Snow Hill, Maryland)|James Martin House]], [[Nassawango Iron Furnace Site]], [[Nun's Green]], [[George Washington Purnell House]], and [[Gov.

It is part of the [[Salisbury metropolitan area|Salisbury, Maryland-Delaware Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n==History==\nSnow Hill was founded in 1686 in [[Somerset County, Maryland|Somerset County]] by [[England|English]] settlers, who may have named it after a street and neighborhood of the [[City of London]] called \"[[Snow Hill, London|Snow Hill]]\", despite the location's elevation of just {{convert|16|ft}} above sea level and the infrequency of snowfall. The town received its first charter on October 26, 1686, and was made a port of entry in 1694.{{citation needed|date = November 2019}}\n\nIn 1742, [[Worcester County, Maryland|Worcester County]] was carved out of the eastern half of old [[Somerset County, Maryland|Somerset County]] and Snow Hill, centrally located in the new county and at the head of navigation on the [[Pocomoke River]], was made the [[County seat|county seat]].{{citation needed|date = November 2019}}\n\nMajor fires in 1844 and 1893 destroyed the center of Snow Hill, including two successive [[Courthouse|Court Houses]], although some eighteenth century structures survived both fires. Following the second fire, much of the commercial area was rapidly rebuilt, so the downtown today contains many historic buildings of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  The Snow Hill [[Historic district (United States)#Local-level|Historic District]], which includes approximately 80% of the town, was created in 2002.{{citation needed|date = November 2019}}\n\nIn December 2010, a Snow Hill businessman started a petition to remove the town's incorporation and revert the area to county control. The reasons given were lower county taxes, better services provided to the town, and a need for revitalization. The push was abandoned in January 2011.<ref>http://www.wboc.com/Global/story.asp?S=13935194</ref>\n\nThe [[All Hallows Episcopal Church]], [[Chanceford]], [[Old Friendship United Methodist Church]], [[Samuel Gunn House]], [[Makemie Memorial Presbyterian Church]], [[James Martin House (Snow Hill, Maryland)|James Martin House]], [[Nassawango Iron Furnace Site]], [[Nun's Green]], [[George Washington Purnell House]], and [[Gov.

In addition, there are the Baltic [[seaside resort]]s of [[Binz]], [[Baabe]], [[G\u00f6hren (R\u00fcgen)|G\u00f6hren]], [[Sellin]] and [[Thiessow]].\n\nR\u00fcgen is very popular as a [[tourism in Germany|tourist destination]] because of its [[resort architecture]], the diverse landscape and its long, sandy beaches.\n\n== Geology ==\nR\u00fcgen, together with the Danish island of [[M\u00f8n]] on the far side of R\u00fcgen in the Baltic Sea and the area around [[Dover]], England,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} once belonged to a large [[chalk]] plateau, which had been pushed by tectonic movements to the earth's surface. The vast majority of this land mass has disappeared as a result of erosion and faulting, leaving the two islands with their characteristic white chalk cliffs.\n\n[[File:Kap Arkona2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cape Arkona]]]]\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:K\u00f6nigsstuhl und Viktoria-Sicht.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jasmund National Park]], famous for its [[chalk]] cliffs, the symbol of R\u00fcgen: ''Victoria-Sicht'' (Victoria's View) and ''K\u00f6nigsstuhl'' (King's Chair) from the [[Baltic Sea]]]]\nThe main body of the island, known as [[Muttland]], is surrounded by several peninsulas.  To the north lie the peninsulas of [[Wittow]] and [[Jasmund]], connected to each other by the [[Schaabe]] [[bar (landform)|sandbar]] and to Muttland by the [[Schmale Heide]], an embankment at [[Lietzow]] and the [[Wittow Ferry]]. The northern peninsulas are separated from Muttland by several lagoons or {{lang|de|[[bodden]]}}, the largest of which are the [[Gro\u00dfer Jasmunder Bodden]] and [[Kleiner Jasmunder Bodden]]. Major peninsulas in the south are [[Zudar]] and [[M\u00f6nchgut]] which both face the [[Bay of Greifswald]].\n\nR\u00fcgen has a total area of {{convert|926.4|km2|abbr=on}}, or {{convert|974|km2|abbr=on}} if the adjacent small islands are included.<ref name=Wurlitzer15>{{cite book|title=R\u00fcgen|first=Bernd|last=Wurlitzer|edition=11|publisher=Mair Dumont Marco Polo|year=2006|isbn=3-8297-0171-3|language=German|page=15}}</ref> The maximum diameter is {{convert|51.4|km|abbr=on}} from north to south, and {{convert|42.8|km|abbr=on}} from east to west.<ref name=Wurlitzer15/> Of an overall {{convert|574|km|abbr=on|adj=on}}-long coastline, {{convert|56|km|abbr=on}} are sandy [[Baltic Sea]] beaches, and {{convert|2.8|km|abbr=on}} sandy {{lang|de|[[bodden]]}} beaches.<ref name=Wurlitzer15/> The highest elevations are on the [[Jasmund]] peninsula: [[Piekberg]] ({{convert|161|m|abbr=on}}) and [[K\u00f6nigsstuhl (R\u00fcgen)|K\u00f6nigsstuhl]] ({{convert|117|m|abbr=on}}).<ref name=Wurlitzer15/>\n\nThe northern part of the [[Bay of Greifswald]], the [[R\u00fcgischer Bodden]], is a large bay in the south of R\u00fcgen island, with the island of  [[Vilm]] lying just offshore. At the western end of the bay, the peninsula of [[Zudar]] runs out to the southernmost point of R\u00fcgen ([[Palmer Ort]]), at the eastern end the highly indented peninsula of [[M\u00f6nchgut]] projects into the sea. This peninsula ends in the east at the [[cape (geography)|cape]] of [[Nordperd]] near [[G\u00f6hren (R\u00fcgen)|G\u00f6hren]] and in the south at the cape of ''S\u00fcdperd'' by Thiessow. In the west of the peninsula of M\u00f6nchgut a narrow, {{convert|5|km|abbr=on|adj=on}}-long [[bar (landform)|bar]], the [[Reddevitz H\u00f6ft]], separates the two bays of [[Having (bay)|Having]] and [[Hagensche Wiek]].\n\n[[File:Binz (2011-05-21) 03.JPG|thumb|[[Binz]]]]\nIn the north-east of the island of R\u00fcgen is formed by the peninsula of [[Jasmund]], which is joined to the heart of the island, ''[[Muttland]]'', by the [[bar (landform)|bar]] of [[Schmale Heide]] between Binz-[[Seebad Prora|Prora]] and Sassnitz-Mukran and by a rail and road embankment at [[Lietzow]]. The Schmale Heide separates the outer bay of [[Prorer Wiek]] from the lagoon of the [[Kleiner Jasmunder Bodden]]. On the peninsula of Jasmund are the [[Piekberg]] ({{H\u00f6he|161|DE-NN|link=true}}), the highest point on R\u00fcgen, and the [[K\u00f6nigsstuhl (R\u00fcgen)|K\u00f6nigsstuhl]], a {{convert|118|m|adj=on}}-high [[chalk]] cliff in [[Stubbenkammer]], which forms the most striking landmark on the island. Another bar, the [[Schaabe]], links Jasmund to the peninsula of [[Wittow]] in the north of R\u00fcgen. The Schaabe, in turn, separates the outer bay of [[Tromper Wiek]] from the lagoon of the [[Gro\u00dfer Jasmunder Bodden]]. The peninsula of Wittow and the long, narrow peninsula of [[Bug (R\u00fcgen)|Bug]] to the west are separated from the main body of R\u00fcgen by the [[Rassower Strom]], the [[Breetzer Bodden]] and the ''Breeger Bodden''. The Wittow peninsula is adjoined in the north by [[Cape Arkona]]. Just under a kilometre to the northwest, located at 54\u00b041' N, is the northernmost point of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Below this [[coastal cliff|cliff]] ({{lang|de|Gellort}}) on the shoreline is the [[Siebenschneiderstein]] - the fourth largest [[glacial erratic]] boulder on R\u00fcgen.\n\nThe northwestern and western sides of R\u00fcgen are also highly indented, but a little flatter. Offshore are the larger islands of [[Hiddensee]] and [[Ummanz]] as well as the smaller islands [[\u00d6he]] [[Liebitz]] and [[Heuwiese]]. Sand removal and deposition by the Baltic Sea has to be constantly countered by dredging operations to the north and south of Hiddensee, otherwise Hiddensee would merge with R\u00fcgen within a few years.  R\u00fcgen is dotted with many glacial erratic boulders, of which the 22 largest belong to legally-protected [[geotope]]s (''see also: [[Erratics on and around R\u00fcgen]]).\n\n=== Land use ===\nThe heartland of R\u00fcgen is gently rolling, and the area is characterized primarily by [[agriculture]]. East of the town of Bergen auf R\u00fcgen the land climbs to {{H\u00f6he|90|DE-NN}} (at [[Rugard]] where there is an observation tower) and to {{H\u00f6he|107|DE-NN}} in the southeastern hill country of the [[Granitz]]. The soil on R\u00fcgen is very fertile and productive, particularly in Wittow, the granary of the island. There are major coal-producing regions.\n\nTwo German national parks are situated on R\u00fcgen: the [[Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park]], in the west (including [[Hiddensee]]), and the [[Jasmund National Park]], a smaller park including the famous chalk cliffs ([[K\u00f6nigsstuhl (R\u00fcgen)|K\u00f6nigsstuhl]]). There is also a nature reserve, the [[Southeast R\u00fcgen Biosphere Reserve]], consisting of the peninsulas in the southeast.\n{{wide image|R\u00fcgen Panorama.jpg|1000px|Panoramic view over R\u00fcgen from [[Granitz Hunting Lodge|Granitz Castle]] near [[Binz]]}}\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate is in the [[temperate zone]]. The winters are not particularly cold, with mean temperatures in January and February of {{convert|0.0|C}}; and summers are mild and temperate, with a mean temperature in August of {{convert|16.3|C}}. There is an average rainfall of {{convert|520|\u2013|560|mm}} and approximately 1800\u20131870 hours of sunshine annually.\n\n== Administration ==\nAdministratively, R\u00fcgen is part of the district [[Vorpommern-R\u00fcgen]].

All over R\u00fcgen there are numerous stone monuments, such as megalithic tombs and altar stones that have survived to the present day. By the 1st century, the inhabitants of R\u00fcgen were part of the [[Germanic peoples|East Germanic]] tribe of [[Rugii]], who roughly occupied the region that was later to become Western Pomerania and who gave the island its name. The Rugii may have originated from [[Scandinavia]] or evolved from [[Indigenous peoples|autochthonous]] tribes. In the [[Migration Period]], many Rugii moved south and founded an empire in [[Pannonia (Roman province)|Pannonia]].\n\n=== Slavic Rani ===\nFrom the 7th&nbsp;century the West Slavic [[Rani (Slavic tribe)|Rani]] (or Rujani) built an empire on R\u00fcgen and the neighbouring coast between [[Recknitz]] and [[Ryck]]. It decidedly affected the history of the Baltic Sea area and the surrounding [[Obodrites|Obodritic]] (in the west) and [[Liutici]]an (in the south) occupied mainland for the next few centuries. Many traces of their life can be found today.\n\nThe basis of their great military strength was a combination of the Ranian navy and a favourable location. Denmark, which was at that time very successful in Britain and Scandinavia, was neither able to match with its Ranian rivals in the Baltic Sea region nor to protect its coastline from Ranian armies until well into the 12th century. Meanwhile, the Ranians built numerous castles and temples in the [[Barth, Germany|Barth]]-[[Jasmund]]-[[Gristow]] triangle.\n\nThe temple hill of [[Cape Arkona|Jaromarsburg]], at the northern tip of R\u00fcgen and dedicated to the god [[Svetovid]], was significant well beyond the boundaries of the Ranian empire. After the fall of [[Radgosc]] it became the chief shrine for the pagan northwestern Slavs. The administrative centre of the empire was [[Charenza]] (possibly identical with the present [[Garz/R\u00fcgen|Garz]] or Venz hillfort). The main trading centre of the empire was [[Ralswiek]] at the southernmost point of the [[Gro\u00dfer Jasmunder Bodden]].\n\n=== Principality under Danish suzerainty ===\nIn 1168, the [[Denmark|Danish]] king, [[Valdemar I of Denmark|Valdemar I]], and his army commander and advisor, Bishop [[Absalon of Lund|Absalon of Roskilde]] destroyed the [[Svetovid]] temple in the hillfort at [[Cape Arkona]], ending both the territorial and religious autonomy of the Rani; their former monarchs became Danish [[Pomeranian duchies and dukes|princes of R\u00fcgen]]. The Rani prince [[Jaromar I, Prince of R\u00fcgen|Jaromar I]] (died 1218) was a vassal of the Danish king and [[Christianization|Christianized]] the island's inhabitants. In 1184, the Pomeranians, whose rule had previously extended as far as the land of G\u00fctzkow and to Demmin and thus made them the immediate neighbours of the now Danish [[Principality of Rugia]], were commissioned by their overlord, the Holy Roman Emperor, to seize R\u00fcgen for the empire, but were defeated in the [[Bay of Greifswald]].\n\nUnder Danish rule the Principality of Rugia changed its character. Danish monasteries were established (e.g. Bergen Abbey in 1193 and [[Eldena Abbey|Hilda Abbey]], today Eldena Abbey, in 1199). [[German eastward expansion|German colonists]] were introduced into the land and soon they became the largest and most culturally influential group within the population. The Slavic cultural element disappeared, mostly due to the lack of their own Slavic church structures, so that the Rani were [[cultural assimilation|absorbed]] in the period that followed into the now German-influenced people of R\u00fcgen. In addition to the colonization of the country and the building of new monasteries and churches, towns were also re-established. In 1234 the R\u00fcgen Prince [[Wizlaw I, Prince of R\u00fcgen|Wizlaw I]] founded the town of [[Stralsund]] and granted [[Greifswald]] market rights in 1241. The power of the towns grew rapidly, forcing R\u00fcgen's rulers to make concessions\u2014for example, the prince's castle at [[Barth, Germany|Barth]] was slighted and Schadegast, the princely \"twin\" of the municipally-controlled Stralsund, was ousted in favour of the latter.\n\nIn 1304 a [[storm surge]], known as the [[All Saints' Flood (1304)|All Saints' Flood]], devastated the island and flooded the peninsula between [[M\u00f6nchgut]] and [[Ruden (island)|Ruden]].\n\n[[File:Belagerung ruegen.jpg|thumb|Invasion of R\u00fcgen by Brandenburg-Prussia at [[Putbus|Neukamp]] in 1678 (etching by Jan Luiken).]]\n\n=== Part of Pomerania ===\nAfter the death of the last Slav prince, [[Wizlaw III, Prince of R\u00fcgen|Wizlaw III]], in 1325, the principality was acquired by [[Pomerania-Wolgast]] as a consequence of the 1321 inheritance agreement ({{lang|de|Erbverbr\u00fcderung}}), and from 1368/72\u20131451 was part of the estate of a branch line, the House of Barth. This state of affairs, together with the disputes over the Danish throne that occurred at that time, led to the [[R\u00fcgen wars of succession]]. After they had played out, the former principality went in 1354 to Pomerania-Wolgast and thus became part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. In 1478, Pomerania-Wolgast and [[Pomerania-Stettin]] were united and, 170 years later, the combined state went to Sweden in 1648 as a result of the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] (see [[Swedish Pomerania]]). R\u00fcgen was part of Swedish Pomerania from 1648 to 1815. Under [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden]] the town of [[Gustavia, R\u00fcgen|Gustavia]] was constructed on the [[M\u00f6nchgut]] peninsula, but was abandoned during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. In the years 1678 and 1715, R\u00fcgen was briefly wrested from the Swedes by the Elector of Brandenburg, [[Frederick William of Brandenburg|Frederick William]] and by the King in Prussia, [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William I]]. For example, a Brandenburg-Danish army landed on the island as part of the [[Invasion of R\u00fcgen (1678)|invasion of R\u00fcgen in 1678]].  After the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain (1679)|Treaty of Saint-Germain]] in 1679 the island passed from Danish to Swedish ownership again. At the time of [[Napoleonic Wars]], R\u00fcgen was held by the [[France|French]] from 1807\u20131813. In the [[Treaty of Kiel]] of 1814, it was transferred initially from Sweden to Denmark and then fell to [[Prussia]], along with New Western Pomerania ({{lang|de|Neuvorpommern}}), thanks to the [[Congress of Vienna|Vienna Convention]] of 1815. In 1818 the island became part of the administrative district of [[Regierungsbezirk Stralsund|Stralsund]] and thus belonged to the Prussian [[Province of Pomerania (1815\u20131945)|Province of Pomerania]].\n\nIn 1816 the first bathing resort was founded at [[Putbus]]. Later more resorts were established, and R\u00fcgen remained the most famous holiday resort of Germany until [[World War II]].\n\n=== German National Socialist era ===\nThe German National Socialists added a large resort: [[Prora]], planned by the [[Strength through Joy]] organisation, which aimed to occupy people's free time. However, Prora was never completed.\n\nIn 1936 the first bridge connecting R\u00fcgen with the mainland was constructed ([[R\u00fcgendamm]]), replacing the former ferry shuttles.\n\nThe operation commanded by [[Wolfram von Richthofen]] that [[bombing of Guernica|bombed the town of Guernica]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]], was named after the island. An [[Abwehr]] [[Signals intelligence]] Operation during the same conflict was titled Operation Bodden after the strait separating R\u00fcgen from the German mainland.\n\nIn the aftermath of World War II, East German and Soviet authorities exiled landholders from the mainland to the island.<ref>Exorcising Hitler, The Occupation and Denazifcation of germany, by Frederick Taylor, Bloomsbury Press</ref>\n\n=== GDR era ===\nAfter the [[Second World War]] R\u00fcgen became part of the state of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Mecklenburg]] within the [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR). In 1952 the island became part of the [[Bezirk Rostock|district of Rostock]].\n\nThe island was the focal point of Project Rose (''Action Rose'') by the GDR government designed to nationalize hotels, taxis and service companies on 10 February 1953. The occasion was supposed to have been a visit by [[Walter Ulbricht]] to the island of R\u00fcgen, during which he had been annoyed by the many surviving private hotels and guest houses. Many of the hotel owners were convicted by [[kangaroo court]]s under the pretext of having been engaged in [[economic crime]] or as agents working for the West. Their property was then confiscated and they were sent to prison. Many of the owners and small businessmen were incarcerated in B\u00fctzow prison. The hotels were supposed to have been expropriated by the [[Free German Trade Union Federation]] (FDGB). In fact, they were used as accommodation for the barracks-based \"people's police\" ({{lang|de|[[Kasernierte Volkspolizei]]}} or CPI). As a result of the confiscation of hotels, tourism on R\u00fcgen in 1953 came almost to a complete standstill for a time.\n\nIn the following nearly four decades, the island became one of the main tourist areas in the GDR. The FDGB played a dominant role in tourist accommodation. In 1963 the FDGB had 7,519 holiday places, the [[Reiseb\u00fcro der DDR]] 2,906 places and a further 5,025 were available for businesses and organizations. In addition, there were 12,245 places for children in summer camps and another 20,800 places for campers. The plots were located mainly near the beaches.<ref>Dr. Rudolf Petzold, 1964, Die B\u00e4derk\u00fcste R\u00fcgens, Veb Brockhaus Verlag,Leipzig, page 5</ref> Increased holiday capacity was not however generated until the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n=== Reunited Germany ===\n[[File:Kurhaus Binz Panorama Nacht.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Binz]], one of several [[spa]]s on R\u00fcgen, featuring the typical [[Resort architecture]] of the [[German Baltic Sea]] \u2014 ''Kurhaus'' (spa hotel) at night]]\n[[File:Sellin Seebr\u00fccke nachts 1.jpg|thumb|The pier of [[Sellin]] at night]]\nIn 1990, R\u00fcgen became part of the new state of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] and, together with the neighbouring islands of [[Hiddensee]] and [[Ummanz]], formed the [[Landkreis R\u00fcgen|district of R\u00fcgen]]. Since the 2011 Mecklenburg-Vorpommern district reforms R\u00fcgen has been part of [[Vorpommern-R\u00fcgen]].\n\nIn 2007 a second bridge, the [[R\u00fcgen Bridge]] ({{lang|de|R\u00fcgenbr\u00fccke}}), was built to replace the first one built in 1936.\n\nR\u00fcgen has now surpassed [[Sylt]] as the most popular German island again.\n\n== Tourist resorts ==\nR\u00fcgen is one of the most popular holiday destinations in Germany. The island receives about one quarter of all overnight stays in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Most visitors come to R\u00fcgen between April and October, the peak season being from June to August, but its quiet atmosphere in winter is also appreciated.\n\nThe first bathing facility on R\u00fcgen opened in 1794 at the mineral-rich spring in [[Sagard]].<ref>{{cite book|title=R\u00fcgen, Hiddensee|first1=Bernhard|last1=Jendricke|first2=Gabriele|last2=Gockel|edition=3|publisher=DuMont|year=2008|isbn=3-7701-6058-4|language=German|page=36}}</ref> In 1818, the [[Putbus]] village of [[Lauterbach (R\u00fcgen)|Lauterbach]] became R\u00fcgen's first seaside resort.<ref name=Kuester300>{{cite book|title=Die Ostsee: eine Natur- und Kulturgeschichte|first=Hansj\u00f6rg|last=K\u00fcster|edition=2|publisher=C.H.Beck|year=2004|isbn=3-406-52366-8|language=German|page=300}}</ref> In the 1860s [[Sassnitz]] became a seaside resort, followed by [[Binz]] in the 1880s.<ref name=Kuester300/> During [[World War II]] [[Prora]] was constructed as a mass tourist resort but it was never finished.<ref name=Kuester300/>\n\nToday the most popular seaside resorts are the [[Schaabe]] beaches between [[Altenkirchen]] and [[Juliusruh]] including Drewoldke, [[Glowe]] and [[Breege]], and the eastern beaches between [[Sassnitz]] and [[G\u00f6hren, R\u00fcgen|G\u00f6hren]] including [[Neu Mukran]], [[Prora]], [[Binz]], [[Sellin]] and [[Baabe]]. The latter are accessible via an historic [[narrow gauge railway]] employing steam locomotives, called the [[R\u00fcgensche B\u00e4derbahn]].

R\u00fcgen is often visited by windsurfers and kitesurfers and offers more than fifteen different locations for surfing. The most popular locations are [[Dranske]], [[Rosengarten, Lower Saxony|Rosengarten]], [[Wiek, R\u00fcgen|Wiek]], Suhrendorf and [[Neu Mukran]].\n\nOn the peninsula of Jasmund is the [[Jasmund National Park]], which consists of the beech forest of [[Stubnitz]], including the famous chalk cliffs of R\u00fcgen. On the [[K\u00f6nigsstuhl (R\u00fcgen)|K\u00f6nigsstuhl]] itself is the [[K\u00f6nigsstuhl National Park Centre]], which has a multivision cinema and audio-guide exhibitions with information about the national park in several languages.\n\n{{Wide image|07.07.18.R\u00fcgen Kreidefelsen4.jpg|1500px|[[Jasmund National Park]] chalk cliffs}}\n\n== Transport ==\n\n=== Rail ===\n[[File:Sellin Ost Bahnhof.jpg|thumb|[[R\u00fcgensche B\u00e4derbahn|Rasender Roland]] (\"Rushing Roland\") is R\u00fcgen's famous historical [[Steam engine|steam-powered]] railway, that runs from [[Putbus]] to [[Binz]], [[Baabe]], [[Sellin]] and [[G\u00f6hren, R\u00fcgen|G\u00f6hren]].]]\nThe [[railway]] network consists of the electrified [[standard gauge]] stretch of the [[Deutsche Bahn]] [[Stralsund-Sassnitz railway|Stralsund (R\u00fcgendamm)-Bergen-Sassnitz line]] (timetable route (KBS) 195), Lietzow-Binz (KBS 197), the non-electrified routes Bergen-Putbus-Lauterbach Mole of the PRESS (KBS 198) and the [[narrow gauge]] stretch ({{RailGauge|750mm|lk=on}}) of the [[R\u00fcgensche B\u00e4derbahn|R\u00fcgen Resort Railway]] ({{lang|de|Rasender Roland}}): Lauterbach Mole-Putbus-Binz-Sellin-G\u00f6hren (KBS 199).\n\nIn addition to regional trains, there are also [[Intercity (Deutsche Bahn)|Intercity]] services from [[Ostseebad Binz railway station|Binz]] via [[Bergen auf R\u00fcgen station|Bergen]] and [[Stralsund station|Stralsund]] to [[Berlin]], [[Hamburg]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Stuttgart]] and the [[Ruhr]].

The [[German Avenue Road]] starts in [[Sellin]] on the island and leads down to the far South of Germany (until [[Lake Constance]]).]]\nUntil October 2007, individual traffic from the mainland to the island of R\u00fcgen was mainly routed along the two-lane R\u00fcgendamm causeway, running between [[Stralsund]] and [[Altef\u00e4hr]] over the sound of [[Strelasund]].\n\nThe cornerstone for a second crossing over the Strelasund was laid on 31 August 2004. This bridge, the R\u00fcgen Bridge, running parallel to the R\u00fcgendamm, has a length of about 4.1 kilometres and a vertical clearance for ships of 42 metres, and was on opened on 20 October 2007. In order to relieve the town of Stralsund, a [[ring road]] has been built in the last few years, coming from the southwest. The [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 96|B 96 federal road]] between Stralsund and [[Greifswald]] is also connected via an access road to the [[Bundesautobahn 20|A 20 motorway]]. The B 96 runs from Stralsund via Bergen to Sassnitz. Here a new route with bypasses is planned (the \"New B 96\").\n\nThe main tourist attractions of Cape Arkona, the [[K\u00f6nigsstuhl (R\u00fcgen)|K\u00f6nigsstuhl]] and the [[Granitz hunting lodge]] are, however, car-free in order to protect the countryside, as is the island of Hiddensee which belongs to Vorpommern-R\u00fcgen district. All these destinations can be reached using public transport, without needing a car.\n\n=== Cycling ===\nR\u00fcgen has a signposted network of cycle paths. The condition and signing of this network varies considerably from one place to another, from very good in the seaside resorts to poor in the area between Garz and Zudar. There is a circular cycle path around the whole island.\nDuring the summer season there is the option on some routes to carry bicycles on the buses. This is always possible on the railways.\n\n=== Ship ===\n[[File:Sassnitz Mukran (2011-05-21) 5.JPG|thumb|[[Ferry]] port ''Mukran'', (part of [[Sassnitz]])]]\n\nTwo car ferries belonging to the {{lang|de|[[Wei\u00dfe Flotte (Stralsund)|Wei\u00dfe Flotte]]}} operate every half-an-hour between the Zudar peninsula on R\u00fcgen and Stahlbrode on the mainland, halfway between Stralsund and Greifswald .\n\nAnother {{lang|de|Wei\u00dfe Flotte}} car ferry, the [[Wittow Ferry]] runs from the heartland of R\u00fcgen (''Muttland'') to Wittow.\n\nA ferry sails from [[Sassnitz]] ferry port in Mukran to the Danish island of [[Bornholm]], to Swedish [[Trelleborg]], to [[Klaipeda]] (formerly Memel) in [[Lithuania]], to [[Baltiysk]] (formerly Pillau) and to [[Saint Petersburg]].\n\nThe island of [[Hiddensee]], which also belongs to the county of Vorpommern-R\u00fcgen, is connected by a regular ferry service from Schaprode to R\u00fcgen, and is increasingly integrated into the clock-schedule timetable on the main island. In addition, there is a regular ship service from Stralsund, [[Wiek (R\u00fcgen)|Wiek]] and [[Breege]] to Hiddensee. Tourist services include ferry connections from [[Lauterbach (R\u00fcgen)|Lauterbach]] to [[Gager (municipality)|Gager]], and between Sassnitz, Binz, Sellin and G\u00f6hren. There are also round-trips mainly from Sassnitz, but also from [[Lohme]], to the K\u00f6nigsstuhl.\nPleasure steamers also ply between the resorts and [[Peenem\u00fcnde]] on Usedom, where there is a connection to the [[Usedomer B\u00e4derbahn|Usedom Railway]] (UBB).\n\n=== Ferries ===\n[[Sassnitz]]\u2013[[Neu Mukran]] is the international ferry terminal on R\u00fcgen, with ferry services to\n*[[Trelleborg]] ([[Sweden]], served by [[Stena Line]]),<ref name=FShome>{{cite web|url=http://www.faehrhafen-sassnitz.de/index-fl.htm|accessdate=2009-08-24|title=F\u00e4hrhafen Sassnitz Gmbh (homepage), Verkehre, Liniendienste}}</ref>\n*[[R\u00f8nne]] ([[Bornholm]], [[Denmark]], served by [[Bornholmslinjen]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bornholmslinjen.com}}</ref>\n*[[Klaip\u0117da]] (Memel, [[Lithuania]], served by [[DFDS Lisco]]),<ref name=FShome/>\n*[[Baltiysk]] (Pillau, [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], [[Russia]], served by [[DFDS Lisco]]),<ref name=FShome/>\n*[[Saint Petersburg]] ([[Russia]], served by ''TransRussiaExpress'')<ref name=FShome/>\n*[[Ust-Luga]] (near [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]; planned).<ref name=DBFS>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressrelations.de/new/standard/result_main.cfm?r=374388&aktion=jour_pm|accessdate=2009-08-24|title=Deutsche Bahn Pressemitteilung vom 03.07.2009, 16:12}}</ref>\nSassnitz-Mukran is the largest railway ferry terminal in [[Germany]] and the only one in Europe where different tracks allow switching from [[standard gauge]] to [[broad gauge]].<ref name=FShome/>\n\nLocal passenger ferries connect the [[pier]]s of [[Sassnitz]], [[Binz]], [[Sellin]] and [[G\u00f6hren, R\u00fcgen|G\u00f6hren]] with the adjacent islands of [[Hiddensee]], [[Vilm]] and [[Greifswalder Oie]].

In addition, there are the Baltic [[seaside resort]]s of [[Binz]], [[Baabe]], [[G\u00f6hren (R\u00fcgen)|G\u00f6hren]], [[Sellin]] and [[Thiessow]].\n\nR\u00fcgen is very popular as a [[tourism in Germany|tourist destination]] because of its [[resort architecture]], the diverse landscape and its long, sandy beaches.\n\n== Geology ==\nR\u00fcgen, together with the Danish island of [[M\u00f8n]] on the far side of R\u00fcgen in the Baltic Sea and the area around [[Dover]], England,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} once belonged to a large [[chalk]] plateau, which had been pushed by tectonic movements to the earth's surface.

To the north lie the peninsulas of [[Wittow]] and [[Jasmund]], connected to each other by the [[Schaabe]] [[bar (landform)|sandbar]] and to Muttland by the [[Schmale Heide]], an embankment at [[Lietzow]] and the [[Wittow Ferry]]. The northern peninsulas are separated from Muttland by several lagoons or ''[[bodden]]'', the largest of which are the [[Gro\u00dfer Jasmunder Bodden]] and [[Kleiner Jasmunder Bodden]]. Major peninsulas in the south are [[Zudar]] and [[M\u00f6nchgut]] which both face the [[Bay of Greifswald]].\n\nR\u00fcgen has a total area of 926.4&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, or 974&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> if the adjacent small islands are included.<ref name=Wurlitzer15>{{cite book|title=R\u00fcgen|first=Bernd|last=Wurlitzer|edition=11|publisher=Mair Dumont Marco Polo|year=2006|isbn=3-8297-0171-3|language=German|page=15}}</ref> The maximum diameter is 51.4&nbsp;km from north to south, and 42.8&nbsp;km from east to west.<ref name=Wurlitzer15/> Of an overall 574&nbsp;km-long coastline, 56&nbsp;km are sandy [[Baltic Sea]] beaches, and 2.8&nbsp;km sandy ''[[bodden]]'' beaches.<ref name=Wurlitzer15/> The highest elevations are on the [[Jasmund]] peninsula: [[Piekberg]] (161 m) and [[K\u00f6nigsstuhl (R\u00fcgen)|K\u00f6nigsstuhl]] (117 m).<ref name=Wurlitzer15/>\n\nThe northern part of the [[Bay of Greifswald]], the [[R\u00fcgischer Bodden]], is a large bay in the south of R\u00fcgen island, with the island of  [[Vilm]] lying just offshore. At the western end of the bay, the peninsula of [[Zudar]] runs out to the southernmost point of R\u00fcgen ([[Palmer Ort]]), at the eastern end the highly indented peninsula of [[M\u00f6nchgut]] projects into the sea. This peninsula ends in the east at the [[cape (geography)|cape]] of [[Nordperd]] near [[G\u00f6hren (R\u00fcgen)|G\u00f6hren]] and in the south at the cape of ''S\u00fcdperd'' by Thiessow. In the west of the peninsula of M\u00f6nchgut a narrow, 5-km-long [[bar (landform)|bar]], the [[Reddevitz H\u00f6ft]], separates the two bays of [[Having (bay)|Having]] and [[Hagensche Wiek]].\n\n[[File:Binz (2011-05-21) 03.JPG|thumb|[[Binz]]]]\nIn the north-east of the island of R\u00fcgen is formed by the peninsula of [[Jasmund]], which is joined to the heart of the island, ''[[Muttland]]'', by the [[bar (landform)|bar]] of [[Schmale Heide]] between Binz-[[Seebad Prora|Prora]] and Sassnitz-Mukran and by a rail and road embankment at [[Lietzow]]. The Schmale Heide separates the outer bay of [[Prorer Wiek]] from the lagoon of the [[Kleiner Jasmunder Bodden]]. On the peninsula of Jasmund are the [[Piekberg]] ({{H\u00f6he|161|DE-NN|link=true}}), the highest point on R\u00fcgen, and the [[K\u00f6nigsstuhl (R\u00fcgen)|K\u00f6nigsstuhl]], a 118-metre-high [[chalk]] cliff in [[Stubbenkammer]], which forms the most striking landmark on the island. Another bar, the [[Schaabe]], links Jasmund to the peninsula of [[Wittow]] in the north of R\u00fcgen. The Schaabe, in turn, separates the outer bay of [[Tromper Wiek]] from the lagoon of the [[Gro\u00dfer Jasmunder Bodden]]. The peninsula of Wittow and the long, narrow peninsula of [[Bug (R\u00fcgen)|Bug]] to the west are separated from the main body of R\u00fcgen by the [[Rassower Strom]], the [[Breetzer Bodden]] and the ''Breeger Bodden''. The Wittow peninsula is adjoined in the north by [[Cape Arkona]]. Just under a kilometre to the northwest, located at 54\u00b041' N, is the northernmost point of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Below this [[coastal cliff|cliff]] (''Gellort'') on the shoreline is the [[Siebenschneiderstein]] - the fourth largest [[glacial erratic]] boulder on R\u00fcgen.\n\nThe northwestern and western sides of R\u00fcgen are also highly indented, but a little flatter. Offshore are the larger islands of [[Hiddensee]] and [[Ummanz]] as well as the smaller islands [[\u00d6he]] [[Liebitz]] and [[Heuwiese]]. Sand removal and deposition by the Baltic Sea has to be constantly countered by dredging operations to the north and south of Hiddensee, otherwise Hiddensee would merge with R\u00fcgen within a few years.  R\u00fcgen is dotted with many glacial erratic boulders, of which the 22 largest belong to legally-protected [[geotope]]s (''see also:[[Erratics on and around R\u00fcgen]]).\n\n=== Land use ===\nThe heartland of R\u00fcgen is gently rolling, and the area is characterized primarily by [[agriculture]]. East of the town of Bergen auf R\u00fcgen the land climbs to {{H\u00f6he|90|DE-NN}} (at [[Rugard]] where there is an observation tower) and to {{H\u00f6he|107|DE-NN}} in the southeastern hill country of the [[Granitz]]. The soil on R\u00fcgen is very fertile and productive, particularly in Wittow, the granary of the island. There are major coal-producing regions.\n\nTwo German national parks are situated on R\u00fcgen: the [[Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park]], in the west (including [[Hiddensee]]), and the [[Jasmund National Park]], a smaller park including the famous chalk cliffs ([[K\u00f6nigsstuhl (R\u00fcgen)|K\u00f6nigsstuhl]]). There is also a nature reserve, the [[Southeast R\u00fcgen Biosphere Reserve]], consisting of the peninsulas in the southeast.\n{{wide image|R\u00fcgen Panorama.jpg|1000px|Panoramic view over R\u00fcgen from [[Granitz Hunting Lodge|Granitz Castle]] near [[Binz]]}}\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate is in the [[temperate zone]]. The winters are not particularly cold, with mean temperatures in January and February of {{convert|0.0|C}}; and summers are mild and temperate, with a mean temperature in August of {{convert|16.3|C}}. There is an average rainfall of {{convert|520|\u2013|560|mm}} and approximately 1800\u20131870 hours of sunshine annually.\n\n== Administration ==\nAdministratively, R\u00fcgen is part of the district [[Vorpommern-R\u00fcgen]].

All over R\u00fcgen there are numerous stone monuments, such as megalithic tombs and altar stones that have survived to the present day. By the 1st century, the inhabitants of R\u00fcgen were part of the [[Germanic peoples|East Germanic]] tribe of [[Rugii]], who roughly occupied the region that was later to become Western Pomerania and who gave the island its name. The Rugii may have originated from [[Scandinavia]] or evolved from [[Indigenous peoples|autochthonous]] tribes. In the [[Migration Period]], many Rugii moved south and founded an empire in [[Pannonia (Roman province)|Pannonia]].\n\n=== Slavic Rani ===\nFrom the 7th&nbsp;century the West Slavic [[Rani (Slavic tribe)|Rani]] (or Rujani) built an empire on R\u00fcgen and the neighbouring coast between [[Recknitz]] and [[Ryck]]. It decidedly affected the history of the Baltic Sea area and the surrounding [[Obodrites|Obodritic]] (in the west) and [[Liutici]]an (in the south) occupied mainland for the next few centuries. Many traces of their life can be found today.\n\nThe basis of their great military strength was a combination of the Ranian navy and a favourable location. Denmark, which was at that time very successful in Britain and Scandinavia, was neither able to match with its Ranian rivals in the Baltic Sea region nor to protect its coastline from Ranian armies until well into the 12th century. Meanwhile, the Ranians built numerous castles and temples in the [[Barth, Germany|Barth]]-[[Jasmund]]-[[Gristow]] triangle.\n\nThe temple hill of [[Cape Arkona|Jaromarsburg]], at the northern tip of R\u00fcgen and dedicated to the god [[Svetovid]], was significant well beyond the boundaries of the Ranian empire. After the fall of [[Radgosc]] it became the chief shrine for the pagan northwestern Slavs. The administrative centre of the empire was [[Charenza]] (possibly identical with the present [[Garz/R\u00fcgen|Garz]] or Venz hillfort). The main trading centre of the empire was [[Ralswiek]] at the southernmost point of the [[Gro\u00dfer Jasmunder Bodden]].\n\n=== Principality under Danish suzerainty ===\nIn 1168, the [[Denmark|Danish]] king, [[Valdemar I of Denmark|Valdemar I]], and his army commander and advisor, Bishop [[Absalon of Lund|Absalon of Roskilde]] destroyed the [[Svetovid]] temple in the hillfort at [[Cape Arkona]], ending both the territorial and religious autonomy of the Rani; their former monarchs became Danish [[Pomeranian duchies and dukes|princes of R\u00fcgen]]. The Rani prince [[Jaromar I, Prince of R\u00fcgen|Jaromar I]] (died 1218) was a vassal of the Danish king and [[Christianization|Christianized]] the island's inhabitants. In 1184, the Pomeranians, whose rule had previously extended as far as the land of G\u00fctzkow and to Demmin and thus made them the immediate neighbours of the now Danish [[Principality of Rugia]], were commissioned by their overlord, the Holy Roman Emperor, to seize R\u00fcgen for the empire, but were defeated in the [[Bay of Greifswald]].\n\nUnder Danish rule the Principality of Rugia changed its character. Danish monasteries were established (e.g. Bergen Abbey in 1193 and [[Eldena Abbey|Hilda Abbey]], today Eldena Abbey, in 1199). [[German eastward expansion|German colonists]] were introduced into the land and soon they became the largest and most culturally influential group within the population. The Slavic cultural element disappeared, mostly due to the lack of their own Slavic church structures, so that the Rani were [[cultural assimilation|absorbed]] in the period that followed into the now German-influenced people of R\u00fcgen. In addition to the colonization of the country and the building of new monasteries and churches, towns were also re-established. In 1234 the R\u00fcgen Prince [[Wizlaw I, Prince of R\u00fcgen|Wizlaw I]] founded the town of [[Stralsund]] and granted [[Greifswald]] market rights in 1241. The power of the towns grew rapidly, forcing R\u00fcgen's rulers to make concessions\u2014for example, the prince's castle at [[Barth, Germany|Barth]] was slighted and Schadegast, the princely \"twin\" of the municipally-controlled Stralsund, was ousted in favour of the latter.\n\nIn 1304 a [[storm surge]], known as the [[All Saints' Flood (1304)|All Saints' Flood]], devastated the island and flooded the peninsula between [[M\u00f6nchgut]] and [[Ruden (island)|Ruden]].\n\n[[File:Belagerung ruegen.jpg|thumb|Invasion of R\u00fcgen by Brandenburg-Prussia at [[Putbus|Neukamp]] in 1678 (etching by Jan Luiken).]]\n\n=== Part of Pomerania ===\nAfter the death of the last Slav prince, [[Wizlaw III, Prince of R\u00fcgen|Wizlaw III]], in 1325, the principality was acquired by [[Pomerania-Wolgast]] as a consequence of the 1321 inheritance agreement (''Erbverbr\u00fcderung''), and from 1368/72\u20131451 was part of the estate of a branch line, the House of Barth. This state of affairs, together with the disputes over the Danish throne that occurred at that time, led to the [[R\u00fcgen wars of succession]]. After they had played out, the former principality went in 1354 to Pomerania-Wolgast and thus became part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. In 1478, Pomerania-Wolgast and [[Pomerania-Stettin]] were united and, 170 years later, the combined state went to Sweden in 1648 as a result of the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] (see [[Swedish Pomerania]]). R\u00fcgen was part of Swedish Pomerania from 1648 to 1815. Under [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden]] the town of [[Gustavia, R\u00fcgen|Gustavia]] was constructed on the [[M\u00f6nchgut]] peninsula, but was abandoned during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. In the years 1678 and 1715, R\u00fcgen was briefly wrested from the Swedes by the Elector of Brandenburg, [[Frederick William of Brandenburg|Frederick William]] and by the King in Prussia, [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William I]]. For example, a Brandenburg-Danish army landed on the island as part of the [[Invasion of R\u00fcgen (1678)|invasion of R\u00fcgen in 1678]].  After the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain (1679)|Treaty of Saint-Germain]] in 1679 the island passed from Danish to Swedish ownership again. At the time of [[Napoleonic Wars]], R\u00fcgen was held by the [[France|French]] from 1807\u20131813. In the [[Treaty of Kiel]] of 1814, it was transferred initially from Sweden to Denmark and then fell to [[Prussia]], along with New Western Pomerania (''Neuvorpommern''), thanks to the [[Congress of Vienna|Vienna Convention]] of 1815. In 1818 the island became part of the administrative district of [[Regierungsbezirk Stralsund|Stralsund]] and thus belonged to the Prussian [[Province of Pomerania (1815\u20131945)|Province of Pomerania]].\n\nIn 1816 the first bathing resort was founded at [[Putbus]]. Later more resorts were established, and R\u00fcgen remained the most famous holiday resort of Germany until [[World War II]].\n\n=== German National Socialist era ===\nThe German National Socialists added a large resort: [[Prora]], planned by the [[Strength through Joy]] organisation, which aimed to occupy people's free time. However, Prora was never completed.\n\nIn 1936 the first bridge connecting R\u00fcgen with the mainland was constructed ([[R\u00fcgendamm]]), replacing the former ferry shuttles.\n\nThe operation commanded by [[Wolfram von Richthofen]] that [[bombing of Guernica|bombed the town of Guernica]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]], was named after the island. An [[Abwehr]] [[Signals intelligence]] Operation during the same conflict was titled Operation Bodden after the strait separating R\u00fcgen from the German mainland.\n\nIn the aftermath of World War II, East German and Soviet authorities exiled landholders from the mainland to the island.<ref>Exorcising Hitler, The Occupation and Denazifcation of germany, by Frederick Taylor, Bloomsbury Press</ref>\n\n=== GDR era ===\nAfter the [[Second World War]] R\u00fcgen became part of the state of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Mecklenburg]] within the [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR). In 1952 the island became part of the [[Bezirk Rostock|district of Rostock]].\n\nThe island was the focal point of Project Rose (''Action Rose'') by the GDR government designed to nationalize hotels, taxis and service companies on 10 February 1953. The occasion was supposed to have been a visit by [[Walter Ulbricht]] to the island of R\u00fcgen, during which he had been annoyed by the many surviving private hotels and guest houses. Many of the hotel owners were convicted by [[kangaroo court]]s under the pretext of having been engaged in [[economic crime]] or as agents working for the West. Their property was then confiscated and they were sent to prison. Many of the owners and small businessmen were incarcerated in B\u00fctzow prison. The hotels were supposed to have been expropriated by the [[Free German Trade Union Federation]] (FDGB). In fact, they were used as accommodation for the barracks-based \"people's police\" (''[[Kasernierte Volkspolizei]]'' or CPI). As a result of the confiscation of hotels, tourism on R\u00fcgen in 1953 came almost to a complete standstill for a time.\n\nIn the following nearly four decades, the island became one of the main tourist areas in the GDR. The FDGB played a dominant role in tourist accommodation. In 1963 the FDGB had 7,519 holiday places, the [[Reiseb\u00fcro der DDR]] 2,906 places and a further 5,025 were available for businesses and organizations. In addition, there were 12,245 places for children in summer camps and another 20,800 places for campers. The plots were located mainly near the beaches.<ref>Dr. Rudolf Petzold, 1964, Die B\u00e4derk\u00fcste R\u00fcgens, Veb Brockhaus Verlag,Leipzig, page 5</ref> Increased holiday capacity was not however generated until the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n=== Reunited Germany ===\n[[File:Kurhaus Binz Panorama Nacht.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Binz]], one of several [[spa]]s on R\u00fcgen, featuring the typical [[Resort architecture]] of the [[German Baltic Sea]] \u2014 ''Kurhaus'' (spa hotel) at night]]\n[[File:Sellin Seebr\u00fccke nachts 1.jpg|thumb|The pier of [[Sellin]] at night]]\nIn 1990, R\u00fcgen became part of the new state of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] and, together with the neighbouring islands of [[Hiddensee]] and [[Ummanz]], formed the [[Landkreis R\u00fcgen|district of R\u00fcgen]]. Since the 2011 Mecklenburg-Vorpommern district reforms R\u00fcgen has been part of [[Vorpommern-R\u00fcgen]].\n\nIn 2007 a second bridge, the [[R\u00fcgen Bridge]] (''R\u00fcgenbr\u00fccke''), was built to replace the first one built in 1936.\n\nR\u00fcgen has now surpassed [[Sylt]] as the most popular German island again.\n\n== Tourist resorts ==\nR\u00fcgen is one of the most popular holiday destinations in Germany. The island receives about one quarter of all overnight stays in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Most visitors come to R\u00fcgen between April and October, the peak season being from June to August, but its quiet atmosphere in winter is also appreciated.\n\nThe first bathing facility on R\u00fcgen opened in 1794 at the mineral-rich spring in [[Sagard]].<ref>{{cite book|title=R\u00fcgen, Hiddensee|first1=Bernhard|last1=Jendricke|first2=Gabriele|last2=Gockel|edition=3|publisher=DuMont|year=2008|isbn=3-7701-6058-4|language=German|page=36}}</ref> In 1818, the [[Putbus]] village of [[Lauterbach (R\u00fcgen)|Lauterbach]] became R\u00fcgen's first seaside resort.<ref name=Kuester300>{{cite book|title=Die Ostsee: eine Natur- und Kulturgeschichte|first=Hansj\u00f6rg|last=K\u00fcster|edition=2|publisher=C.H.Beck|year=2004|isbn=3-406-52366-8|language=German|page=300}}</ref> In the 1860s [[Sassnitz]] became a seaside resort, followed by [[Binz]] in the 1880s.<ref name=Kuester300/> During [[World War II]] [[Prora]] was constructed as a mass tourist resort but it was never finished.<ref name=Kuester300/>\n\nToday the most popular seaside resorts are the [[Schaabe]] beaches between [[Altenkirchen]] and [[Juliusruh]] including Drewoldke, [[Glowe]] and [[Breege]], and the eastern beaches between [[Sassnitz]] and [[G\u00f6hren, R\u00fcgen|G\u00f6hren]] including [[Neu Mukran]], [[Prora]], [[Binz]], [[Sellin]] and [[Baabe]]. The latter are accessible via an historic [[narrow gauge railway]] employing steam locomotives, called the [[R\u00fcgensche B\u00e4derbahn]]. Tourist destinations, other than seaside resorts, include [[Cape Arkona]], the wood-covered [[Stubbenkammer]] hills on [[Jasmund]] with interesting chalk cliff formations, the wood-covered [[Granitz]] hills with their ''Jagdschlo\u00df'' or [[Granitz hunting lodge|hunting lodge]], the [[Classicism|classicist]] buildings of [[Putbus]] and the inland villages of [[Bergen auf R\u00fcgen]], [[Ralswiek]] and [[Gingst]].\n\nThe island offers a huge variety of different beach and shore areas. R\u00fcgen is often visited by windsurfers and kitesurfers and offers more than fifteen different locations for surfing. The most popular locations are [[Dranske]], [[Rosengarten, Lower Saxony|Rosengarten]], [[Wiek, R\u00fcgen|Wiek]], Suhrendorf and [[Neu Mukran]].\n\nOn the peninsula of Jasmund is the [[Jasmund National Park]], which consists of the beech forest of [[Stubnitz]], including the famous chalk cliffs of R\u00fcgen. On the [[K\u00f6nigsstuhl (R\u00fcgen)|K\u00f6nigsstuhl]] itself is the [[K\u00f6nigsstuhl National Park Centre]], which has a multivision cinema and audio-guide exhibitions with information about the national park in several languages.\n\n{{Wide image|07.07.18.R\u00fcgen Kreidefelsen4.jpg|1500px|[[Jasmund National Park]] chalk cliffs}}\n\n== Transport ==\n\n=== Rail ===\n[[File:Sellin Ost Bahnhof.jpg|thumb|[[R\u00fcgensche B\u00e4derbahn|Rasender Roland]] (\"Rushing Roland\") is R\u00fcgen's famous historical [[Steam engine|steam-powered]] railway, that runs from [[Putbus]] to [[Binz]], [[Baabe]], [[Sellin]] and [[G\u00f6hren, R\u00fcgen|G\u00f6hren]].]]\nThe [[railway]] network consists of the electrified [[standard gauge]] stretch of the [[Deutsche Bahn]] [[Stralsund-Sassnitz railway|Stralsund (R\u00fcgendamm)-Bergen-Sassnitz line]] (timetable route (KBS) 195), Lietzow-Binz (KBS 197), the non-electrified routes Bergen-Putbus-Lauterbach Mole of the PRESS (KBS 198) and the [[narrow gauge]] stretch ({{RailGauge|750mm|lk=on}}) of the [[R\u00fcgensche B\u00e4derbahn|R\u00fcgen Resort Railway]] (''Rasender Roland''): Lauterbach Mole-Putbus-Binz-Sellin-G\u00f6hren (KBS 199).\n\nIn addition to regional trains, there are also [[Intercity (Deutsche Bahn)|Intercity]] services from [[Ostseebad Binz railway station|Binz]] via [[Bergen auf R\u00fcgen station|Bergen]] and [[Stralsund station|Stralsund]] to [[Berlin]], [[Hamburg]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Stuttgart]] and the [[Ruhr]]. Night train services to [[Munich]], Basle and the Ruhr area were deleted from the timetable on 9 December 2007, despite massive protests from the local hotel industry.\n\n=== Bus ===\nThe bus service on R\u00fcgen is operated by the ''R\u00fcgener Personennahverkehr''. Since 1996 it has been continuously expanded, and has developed an integral [[clock-face schedule]]. There is a service between all major towns and municipalities on the island at least every two hours, sometimes more frequently during peak season. Throughout the year, buses now run at least every hour on the routes between Sassnitz-Binz-Bergen, Schaprode\u2013Bergen\u2013Klein Zicker, Bergen/Sassnitz-[[Altenkirchen (R\u00fcgen)|Altenkirchen]]-[[Wiek (R\u00fcgen)|Wiek]]-[[Dranske]] and the Altenkirchen-[[Putgarten]] near Cape Arkona. In addition, the bus service is well-linked with the railway, especially in Bergen, but also at other railway stations.\n\n=== Road ===\n[[File:AlleeR\u00fcgen1.jpg|thumb|right| Typical avenue on R\u00fcgen. The [[German Avenue Road]] starts in [[Sellin]] on the island and leads down to the far South of Germany (until [[Lake Constance]]).]]\nUntil October 2007, individual traffic from the mainland to the island of R\u00fcgen was mainly routed along the two-lane R\u00fcgendamm causeway, running between [[Stralsund]] and [[Altef\u00e4hr]] over the sound of [[Strelasund]].\n\nThe cornerstone for a second crossing over the Strelasund was laid on 31 August 2004. This bridge, the ''R\u00fcgen Bridge'', running parallel to the R\u00fcgendamm, has a length of about 4.1 kilometres and a vertical clearance for ships of 42 metres, and was on opened on 20 October 2007. In order to relieve the town of Stralsund, a [[ring road]] has been built in the last few years, coming from the southwest. The [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 96|B 96 federal road]] between Stralsund and [[Greifswald]] is also connected via an access road to the [[Bundesautobahn 20|A 20 motorway]]. The B 96 runs from Stralsund via Bergen to Sassnitz. Here a new route with bypasses is planned (the \"New B 96\").\n\nThe main tourist attractions of Cape Arkona, the [[K\u00f6nigsstuhl (R\u00fcgen)|K\u00f6nigsstuhl]] and the [[Granitz hunting lodge]] are, however, car-free in order to protect the countryside, as is the island of Hiddensee which belongs to Vorpommern-R\u00fcgen district. All these destinations can be reached using public transport, without needing a car.\n\n=== Cycling ===\nR\u00fcgen has a signposted network of cycle paths. The condition and signing of this network varies considerably from one place to another, from very good in the seaside resorts to poor in the area between Garz and Zudar. There is a circular cycle path around the whole island.\nDuring the summer season there is the option on some routes to carry bicycles on the buses. This is always possible on the railways.\n\n=== Ship ===\n[[File:Sassnitz Mukran (2011-05-21) 5.JPG|thumb|[[Ferry]] port ''Mukran'', (part of [[Sassnitz]])]]\n\nTwo car ferries belonging to the ''[[Wei\u00dfe Flotte (Stralsund)|Wei\u00dfe Flotte]]'' operate every half-an-hour between the Zudar peninsula on R\u00fcgen and Stahlbrode on the mainland, halfway between Stralsund and Greifswald .\n\nAnother ''Wei\u00dfe Flotte'' car ferry, the [[Wittow Ferry]] runs from the heartland of R\u00fcgen (''Muttland'') to Wittow.\n\nA ferry sails from [[Sassnitz]] ferry port in Mukran to the Danish island of [[Bornholm]], to Swedish [[Trelleborg]], to [[Klaipeda]] (formerly Memel) in [[Lithuania]], to [[Baltiysk]] (formerly Pillau) and to [[Saint Petersburg]].\n\nThe island of [[Hiddensee]], which also belongs to the county of Vorpommern-R\u00fcgen, is connected by a regular ferry service from Schaprode to R\u00fcgen, and is increasingly integrated into the clock-schedule timetable on the main island. In addition, there is a regular ship service from Stralsund, [[Wiek (R\u00fcgen)|Wiek]] and [[Breege]] to Hiddensee. Tourist services include ferry connections from [[Lauterbach (R\u00fcgen)|Lauterbach]] to [[Gager (municipality)|Gager]], and between Sassnitz, Binz, Sellin and G\u00f6hren. There are also round-trips mainly from Sassnitz, but also from [[Lohme]], to the K\u00f6nigsstuhl.\nPleasure steamers also ply between the resorts and [[Peenem\u00fcnde]] on Usedom, where there is a connection to the [[Usedomer B\u00e4derbahn|Usedom Railway]] (UBB).\n\n=== Ferries ===\n[[Sassnitz]]\u2013[[Neu Mukran]] is the international ferry terminal on R\u00fcgen, with ferry services to\n*[[Trelleborg]] ([[Sweden]], served by [[Stena Line]]),<ref name=FShome>{{cite web|url=http://www.faehrhafen-sassnitz.de/index-fl.htm|accessdate=2009-08-24|title=F\u00e4hrhafen Sassnitz Gmbh (homepage), Verkehre, Liniendienste}}</ref>\n*[[R\u00f8nne]] ([[Bornholm]], [[Denmark]], served by [[Bornholmslinjen]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bornholmslinjen.com}}</ref>\n*[[Klaip\u0117da]] (Memel, [[Lithuania]], served by [[DFDS Lisco]]),<ref name=FShome/>\n*[[Baltiysk]] (Pillau, [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], [[Russia]], served by [[DFDS Lisco]]),<ref name=FShome/>\n*[[Saint Petersburg]] ([[Russia]], served by ''TransRussiaExpress'')<ref name=FShome/>\n*[[Ust-Luga]] (near [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]; planned).<ref name=DBFS>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressrelations.de/new/standard/result_main.cfm?r=374388&aktion=jour_pm|accessdate=2009-08-24|title=Deutsche Bahn Pressemitteilung vom 03.07.2009, 16:12}}</ref>\nSassnitz-Mukran is the largest railway ferry terminal in [[Germany]] and the only one in Europe where different tracks allow switching from [[standard gauge]] to [[broad gauge]].<ref name=FShome/>\n\nLocal passenger ferries connect the [[pier]]s of [[Sassnitz]], [[Binz]], [[Sellin]] and [[G\u00f6hren, R\u00fcgen|G\u00f6hren]] with the adjacent islands of [[Hiddensee]], [[Vilm]] and [[Greifswalder Oie]].

Phosphorus can cause [[eutrophication]], and [[hydrogen sulfide]] can be toxic to marine life, meaning that cable bacteria play an important role in maintaining marine ecosystems in coastal areas.\n\n==== Methane emissions ====\nThe presence of cable bacteria can lead to a decrease in methane emissions from saturated soils. The transfer of electrons through cable bacteria allows the sulfate reduction that occurs in inundated soils to be balanced by sulfate oxidation. Oxidation is possible because of the release of electrons through the cable bacteria filaments. Through this balance, sulfate remains readily available for [[sulfate reducing bacteria]], which out compete [[Methanogen|methanogens.]] This causes a decrease in production of methane by methanogens.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Scholz|first=Vincent V.|last2=Meckenstock|first2=Rainer U.|last3=Nielsen|first3=Lars Peter|last4=Risgaard-Petersen|first4=Nils|date=2020-04-20|title=Cable bacteria reduce methane emissions from rice-vegetated soils|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15812-w|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|pages=1\u20135|doi=10.1038/s41467-020-15812-w|issn=2041-1723}}</ref>\n\n==Practical applications==\nCable bacteria have been found associated with benthic [[microbial fuel cells]], devices that convert chemical energy on the ocean floor to electrical energy.<ref name=\"Reimers2017\">Reimers CE, Li C, Graw MF, Schrader PS, Wolf M.

Phosphorus can cause [[eutrophication]], and [[hydrogen sulfide]] can be toxic to marine life, meaning that cable bacteria play an important role in maintaining marine ecosystems in coastal areas.\n\n==== Methane emissions ====\nThe presence of cable bacteria can lead to a decrease in methane emissions from saturated soils. The transfer of electrons through cable bacteria allows the sulfate reduction that occurs in inundated soils to be balanced by sulfate oxidation. Oxidation is possible because of the release of electrons through the cable bacteria filaments. Through this balance, sulfate remains readily available for [[sulfate reducing bacteria]], which out compete [[Methanogen|methanogens.]] This causes a decrease in production of methane by methanogens.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Scholz|first=Vincent V.|last2=Meckenstock|first2=Rainer U.|last3=Nielsen|first3=Lars Peter|last4=Risgaard-Petersen|first4=Nils|date=2020-04-20|title=Cable bacteria reduce methane emissions from rice-vegetated soils|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15812-w|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|pages=1\u20135|doi=10.1038/s41467-020-15812-w|issn=2041-1723}}</ref>\n\n==Practical applications==\nCable bacteria have been found associated with benthic [[microbial fuel cells]], devices that convert chemical energy on the ocean floor to electrical energy.<ref name=\"Reimers2017\">Reimers CE, Li C, Graw MF, Schrader PS, Wolf M.
