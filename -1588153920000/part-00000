It is a subsidiary of [[Fubon Financial Holding Co., Ltd.]] of [[Taiwan]].  Prior to adopting the Fubon brand on April 6, 2005, the organisation was known as [[International Bank of Asia]], more commonly known as '''IBA''' ({{zh|t=\u6e2f\u57fa\u9280\u884c}}, formerly branded as {{zh|t=\u6e2f\u57fa\u570b\u969b\u9280\u884c}}).\n\n==History==\n[[File:Fubon Bank Branch.jpg|thumb|200px|Fubon Bank Branch in [[Hong Kong]]]]\n\nFubon Bank (Hong Kong) Limited was established as [[Sun Hung Kai Finance Company]], the financing arm of Sun Hung Kai Securities.  The name '''[[Sun Hung Kai Bank]]''' was adopted in 1982, when it received a multi-branch banking licence.  The original Sun Hung Kai Bank shareholders included [[Banque Paribas]], [[Merrill Lynch]], and the family of [[Fung King Hey]] (founder of Sun Hung Kai Securities).\n\nIn 1985, Ahmet D. Arsan, Asia Head of [[Arab Banking Corporation]] (ABC), arranged for ABC to acquire 75% of Sun Hung Kai Bank, which, at the time, was suffering from sub-optimal results and was ripe for a take-over.  Arsan was a well-known and highly influential Turkish-American banker who ABC had recruited in 1982 to head ABC Asia Pacific, after his success, years earlier, in establishing the Asia Pacific arm of First Chicago (now JPMorgan Asia).  Immediately following the 1985 acquisition of Sun Hung Kai Bank by ABC, Arsan made sweeping changes in the bank, ranging from the executive management team and most of the bank's staff, to the bank's entire set of operating procedures, on which all employees were trained.\n\nIn 1986, Arsan changed the institution's name and re-branded the organisation as [[International Bank of Asia]] (IBA); (\u6e2f\u57fa\u570b\u969b\u9280\u884c).  Ahmet D. Arsan was the founding Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of IBA from 1985 to 1989, after which Arsan left IBA and established a private Hong Kong based trading firm.\n\nIn 1990, following Arsan's departure, ABC acquired the remaining 25% of IBA shares, making IBA a wholly owned subsidiary of ABC, until October 1993 when [[China Everbright Group]] became a 20% stake holder.  In November 1990, IBA was listed on the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]].\n\nIn February 2004 [[Fubon Financial Holding Co., Ltd.]], a member of Taiwanese financial institution Fubon Group, in an acquisition of IBA shares from both ABC and [[China Everbright Limited]] ( a subsidiary of Everbright Group incorporated in 1997), acquired a 75% stake in IBA.  The M&A advisor was Citigroup Global Markets.\n\nAt the 2005 Fubon Group annual general meeting, the Fubon board approved a movement for IBA to adopt the Fubon name.  On April 6, 2005, IBA was renamed Fubon Bank (Hong Kong) Limited.\n\nFubon Bank (Hong Kong) Limited operates 26 branches in Hong Kong inclusive of commercial banking centre and securities services centers. The branches are distributed across Hong Kong Island (9), Kowloon (10) and New Territories (7). <ref>[http://www.fubonbank.com.hk/en/branch-locator.html Fubon branch locations, retrieved on 2018-05-22]</ref> Fubon provides a wide range of financial services encompassing consumer and wholesale banking, wealth management, financial markets, hire purchase, securities brokerage and investment services.  Fubon Bank is listed on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (stock code: 636) and holds an A-2 short-term, BBB+ long-term rating from S&P.  The rating reflects Fubon Bank's strong capitalization, good liquidity and sound asset quality.\n\n==Timeline==\n\n1970  - Established as Sun Hung Kai Finance Company.\n\n1982  - Sun Hung Kai Finance was renamed Sun Hung Kai Bank after receiving a multi-branch licence.\n\n1985 - Arab Banking Corporation (\"ABC\") acquired 75% of the Bank, and the Fung family retained 25%.\n\n1986 - The Bank was renamed International Bank of Asia (IBA).\n\n1990  - ABC purchased the remaining 25% and IBA became a wholly owned subsidiary of ABC until 1993.\n\nOctober 1993  - China Everbright Holdings acquired a 20% shareholding of IBA.\n \nNovember 1993  - IBA listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong.\n\nNovember 1996   - IBA became the first bank in Hong Kong to receive a full rating from Standard and Poor's (S&P).

He took his idea to [[Lyon]], which was then a centre of weaving, where he did manage to gain the help of one weaver, who made two [[cotton]] strips that worked. However, the cotton wore out quickly, so de Mestral turned to [[synthetic fibre]]s.<ref name=\"How\"/> He settled on [[nylon]] as being the best synthetic after, through trial and error, he eventually discovered that nylon forms hooks that were perfect for the hook side of the fastener when sewn under hot infrared light.<ref name=\"swissinfo\"/> Though he had figured out how to make the hooks, he had yet to figure out a way to mechanise the process, and to make the looped side. Next he found that nylon thread, when woven in loops and heat-treated, retains its shape and is resilient, however the loops had to be cut in just the right spot so that they could be fastened and unfastened many times. On the verge of giving up, a new idea came to him. He bought a pair of shears and trimmed the tops off the loops, thus creating hooks that would match up perfectly with the loops.<ref name=\"How\"/>\n\nMechanising the process of the weave of the hooks took eight years, and it took another year to create the loom that trimmed the loops after weaving them. In all, it took ten years to create a mechanised process that worked.<ref name=\"How\"/> He submitted his idea for [[patent]] in Switzerland in 1951 and the patent was granted in 1955.<ref name=\"swissinfo\"/> De Mestral expected a high demand immediately. Within a few years, he received patents and subsequently opened shop in [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Sweden]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], and [[Canada]]. In 1957 he branched out to the textile centre of [[Manchester, New Hampshire]] in the [[United States]].<ref name=\"How\"/>\n\nDe Mestral gave the name Velcro, a portmanteau of the French words velours (\"velvet\"), and crochet (\"hook\"), to his invention as well as his company, which continues to manufacture and market the fastening system.<ref name=\"OED\">\"Velcro.\" ''The Oxford English Dictionary''. 2nd ed. 1989.</ref><ref name=\"swissinfo\"/>\n\nHowever, hook and loop's integration into the textile industry took time, partly because of its appearance. Hook and loop in the early 1960s looked like it had been made from left-over bits of cheap fabric, an unappealing aspect for clothiers.<ref name=\"Why\">{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Allyn|author2=Bob Golden|title=Why Didn't I Think of That: Bizarre Origins of Ingenious Inventions We Couldn't Live Without|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EVafPNDvWlYC&pg=PA99|accessdate=2008-05-09|date=September 1997|publisher=Wiley|isbn=0-471-16511-5|pages=99-pp.104}}</ref> The first notable use for Velcro\u00ae brand hook and loop came in the [[aerospace]] industry, where it helped [[astronauts]] manoeuvre in and out of bulky [[space suit]]s.

He took his idea to [[Lyon]], which was then a centre of weaving, where he did manage to gain the help of one weaver, who made two [[cotton]] strips that worked. However, the cotton wore out quickly, so de Mestral turned to [[synthetic fibre]]s.<ref name=\"How\"/> He settled on [[nylon]] as being the best synthetic after, through trial and error, he eventually discovered that nylon forms hooks that were perfect for the hook side of the fastener when sewn under hot infrared light.<ref name=\"swissinfo\"/> Though he had figured out how to make the hooks, he had yet to figure out a way to mechanise the process, and to make the looped side. Next he found that nylon thread, when woven in loops and heat-treated, retains its shape and is resilient, however the loops had to be cut in just the right spot so that they could be fastened and unfastened many times. On the verge of giving up, a new idea came to him. He bought a pair of shears and trimmed the tops off the loops, thus creating hooks that would match up perfectly with the loops.<ref name=\"How\"/>\n\nMechanising the process of the weave of the hooks took eight years, and it took another year to create the loom that trimmed the loops after weaving them. In all, it took ten years to create a mechanised process that worked.<ref name=\"How\"/> He submitted his idea for [[patent]] in Switzerland in 1951 and the patent was granted in 1955.<ref name=\"swissinfo\"/> De Mestral expected a high demand immediately. Within a few years, he received patents and subsequently opened shop in [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Sweden]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], and [[Canada]]. In 1957 he branched out to the textile centre of [[Manchester, New Hampshire]] in the [[United States]].<ref name=\"How\"/>\n\nDe Mestral gave the name Velcro, a portmanteau of the French words velours (\"velvet\"), and crochet (\"hook\"), to his invention as well as his company, which continues to manufacture and market the fastening system.<ref name=\"OED\">\"Velcro.\" ''The Oxford English Dictionary''. 2nd ed. 1989.</ref><ref name=\"swissinfo\"/>\n\nHowever, hook and loop's integration into the textile industry took time, partly because of its appearance.

Patients who are experiencing intense [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[anxiety]], [[shame]], and are upset over these thoughts are very different from those who actually act on them.  The history of violent crime is dominated by those who feel no guilt or [[remorse]]; the very fact that someone is tormented by intrusive thoughts and has never acted on them before is an excellent predictor that they will not act upon the thoughts.

The doubt that accompanies OCD leads to uncertainty regarding whether one might act on the intrusive thoughts, resulting in self-criticism or loathing.<ref name= \"Osgood\" />\n\nOne of the more common sexual intrusive thoughts occurs when an obsessive person doubts their sexual identity.  As in the case of most sexual obsessions, sufferers may feel shame and live in isolation, finding it hard to discuss their fears, doubts, and concerns about their sexual identity.<ref name= \"PenzelGay\" />\n\nA person experiencing sexual intrusive thoughts may feel shame, \"embarrassment, guilt, distress, torment, fear of acting on the thought or perceived impulse, and doubt about whether they have already acted in such a way.\"  Depression may be a result of the self-loathing that can occur, depending on how much the OCD interferes with daily functioning or causes distress.<ref name= \"Osgood\" />  Their concern over these thoughts may cause them to scrutinize their bodies to determine if the thoughts result in feelings of arousal.  However, focusing their attention on any part of the body can result in feelings in that body part, hence doing so may decrease confidence and increase fear about acting on the urges.  Part of the treatment of sexual intrusive thoughts involves therapy to help sufferers accept intrusive thoughts and stop trying to reassure themselves by checking their bodies.<ref>Baer (2001), p. 35.</ref> This arousal within the body parts is due to conditioned physiological responses in the brain, which do not respond to the subject of the sexual intrusive thought but rather to the fact that a sexual thought is occurring at all and thus engage an automatic response (research indicates that the correlation between what the genitalia regard as \"sexually relevant\" and what the brain regards as \"sexually appealing\" only correlates 50% of the time in men and 10% of the time in women<ref>{{Citation | last = Nagoski | first = E | title = Come as you are: The surprising new science that will transform your sex life | year = 2015 | place = Simon & Schuster | pages = 193\u2013205}}.</ref>). This means that an arousal response does not necessarily indicate that the person desires what they are thinking about.

This is true of all types of anxiety and fear reactions, not just OCD.\" Because it is uncomfortable to experience bad thoughts and urges, shame, doubt or fear, the initial reaction is usually to do something to make the feelings diminish.  By engaging in a ritual or compulsion to diminish the anxiety or bad feeling, the action is strengthened via a process called negative reinforcement\u2014the mind learns that the way to avoid the bad feeling is by engaging in a ritual or compulsions.  When OCD becomes severe, this leads to more interference in life and continues the frequency and severity of the thoughts the person sought to avoid.<ref name=\"Osgood\"/>\n\nExposure therapy (or exposure and response prevention) is the practice of staying in an anxiety-provoking or feared situation until the distress or anxiety diminishes.  The goal is to reduce the fear reaction, learning to not react to the bad thoughts.

Patients who are experiencing intense [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[anxiety]], [[shame]], and are upset over these thoughts are very different from those who actually act on them.  The history of violent crime is dominated by those who feel no guilt or [[remorse]]; the very fact that someone is tormented by intrusive thoughts and has never acted on them before is an excellent predictor that they will not act upon the thoughts.  Patients who are not troubled or shamed by their thoughts, do not find them distasteful, or who have actually taken action, might need to have more serious conditions such as [[psychosis]] or potentially criminal behaviors ruled out.<ref>Baer (2001), pp. 37\u201338.</ref>  According to Lee Baer, a patient should be concerned that intrusive thoughts are dangerous if the person does not feel upset by the thoughts, or rather finds them pleasurable; has ever acted on violent or sexual thoughts or urges; hears voices or sees things that others do not see; or feels uncontrollable irresistible anger.<ref>Baer (2001), pp. 43\u201344.</ref>\n\n===Aggressive thoughts===\nIntrusive thoughts may involve violent obsessions about hurting others or themselves.<ref>Baer (2001), pp. 33, 78</ref> They can be related to [[primarily obsessional obsessive compulsive disorder]]. These thoughts can include harming a child; jumping from a bridge, mountain, or the top of a tall building; urges to jump in front of a train or automobile; and urges to push another in front of a train or automobile.<ref name=\"Baerxiv\"/>  Rachman's survey of healthy college students found that virtually all of them had intrusive thoughts from time to time, including:<ref name=\"BaerRachman\"/>\n* causing harm to elderly people\n* imagining or wishing harm upon someone close to oneself\n* impulses to violently attack, hit, harm or kill a person, small child, or animal\n* impulses to shout at or abuse someone, or attack and violently punish someone, or say something rude, inappropriate, nasty, or violent to someone.\n\nThese thoughts are part of being human, and need not ruin the quality of life.<ref>Baer (2001), p. xv</ref>  Treatment is available when the thoughts are associated with OCD and become persistent, severe, or distressing.\n\nA variant of aggressive intrusive thoughts is '''''L'appel du vide''''', or '''the call of the void'''. Sufferers of ''L'appel du vide'' generally describe the condition as manifesting in certain situations, normally as a wish or brief desire to jump from a high location.\n\n===Sexual thoughts===\n[[sexual obsessions|Sexual obsession]] involves intrusive thoughts or images of \"kissing, touching, fondling, [[oral sex]], [[anal sex]], [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]], and [[rape]]\" with \"strangers, acquaintances, parents, children, family members, friends, coworkers, animals and religious figures\", involving \"[[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] or [[homosexuality|homosexual]] content\" with persons of any age.<ref name=\"Osgood\"/>\n\nCommon sexual themes for intrusive thoughts for men involve \u201c(a) having sex in a public place, (b) people I come in contact with being naked, and (c) engaging in a sexual act with someone who is unacceptable to me because they have authority over me.\u201d While common sexual intrusive thoughts for women are (a) having sex in a public place, (b) engaging in a sexual act with someone who is unacceptable to me because they have authority over me, and (c) being sexually victimized.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Byers|first=E.

The doubt that accompanies OCD leads to uncertainty regarding whether one might act on the intrusive thoughts, resulting in self-criticism or loathing.<ref name= \"Osgood\" />\n\nOne of the more common sexual intrusive thoughts occurs when an obsessive person doubts their sexual identity.  As in the case of most sexual obsessions, sufferers may feel shame and live in isolation, finding it hard to discuss their fears, doubts, and concerns about their sexual identity.<ref name= \"PenzelGay\" />\n\nA person experiencing sexual intrusive thoughts may feel shame, \"embarrassment, guilt, distress, torment, fear of acting on the thought or perceived impulse, and doubt about whether they have already acted in such a way.\"  Depression may be a result of the self-loathing that can occur, depending on how much the OCD interferes with daily functioning or causes distress.<ref name= \"Osgood\" />  Their concern over these thoughts may cause them to scrutinize their bodies to determine if the thoughts result in feelings of arousal.  However, focusing their attention on any part of the body can result in feelings in that body part, hence doing so may decrease confidence and increase fear about acting on the urges.  Part of the treatment of sexual intrusive thoughts involves therapy to help sufferers accept intrusive thoughts and stop trying to reassure themselves by checking their bodies.<ref>Baer (2001), p. 35.</ref> This arousal within the body parts is due to conditioned physiological responses in the brain, which do not respond to the subject of the sexual intrusive thought but rather to the fact that a sexual thought is occurring at all and thus engage an automatic response (research indicates that the correlation between what the genitalia regard as \"sexually relevant\" and what the brain regards as \"sexually appealing\" only correlates 50% of the time in men and 10% of the time in women<ref>{{Citation | last = Nagoski | first = E | title = Come as you are: The surprising new science that will transform your sex life | year = 2015 | place = Simon & Schuster | pages = 193\u2013205}}.</ref>). This means that an arousal response does not necessarily indicate that the person desires what they are thinking about. However, rational thinking processes attempt to explain this reaction and OCD causes people to attribute false meaning and importance to these physiological reactions in an attempt to make sense of them.<ref>{{Citation | last = Osgood-Hynes | first = Deborah | archivedate = 2011-11-15 | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] | url = http://www.raminader.com/PDFs%20Uploaded/OCD%20-%20Thinking%20Bad%20Thoughts.pdf | title = Thinking Bad Thoughts | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111115230001/http://raminader.com/PDFs%20Uploaded/OCD%20-%20Thinking%20Bad%20Thoughts.pdf |date= 2011-11-15 | publisher = MGH McLean Institute | place = Belmont MA}}.</ref> Sufferers can also experience heightened anxiety caused by \"forbidden\" images or simply by discussing the matter which can then also cause physiological arousal, such as sweating, increased heart rate and some degree of tumescence or lubrication.

Director of Psychological Services and Training at the MGH/McLean OCD Institute, \"In order to reduce a fear, you have to face a fear. This is true of all types of anxiety and fear reactions, not just OCD.\" Because it is uncomfortable to experience bad thoughts and urges, shame, doubt or fear, the initial reaction is usually to do something to make the feelings diminish.  By engaging in a ritual or compulsion to diminish the anxiety or bad feeling, the action is strengthened via a process called negative reinforcement\u2014the mind learns that the way to avoid the bad feeling is by engaging in a ritual or compulsions.  When OCD becomes severe, this leads to more interference in life and continues the frequency and severity of the thoughts the person sought to avoid.<ref name=\"Osgood\"/>\n\nExposure therapy (or exposure and response prevention) is the practice of staying in an anxiety-provoking or feared situation until the distress or anxiety diminishes.  The goal is to reduce the fear reaction, learning to not react to the bad thoughts.  This is the most effective way to reduce the frequency and severity of the intrusive thoughts.<ref name=\"Osgood\"/>  The goal is to be able to \"expose yourself to the thing that most triggers your fear or discomfort for one to two hours at a time, without leaving the situation, or doing anything else to distract or comfort you.\"<ref>Baer (2001), p. 73</ref>  Exposure therapy will not completely eliminate intrusive thoughts\u2014everyone has bad thoughts\u2014but most patients find that it can decrease their thoughts sufficiently that intrusive thoughts no longer interfere with their lives.<ref>Baer (2001), p. 86</ref>\n\n===Cognitive behavioral therapy===\n[[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) is a newer therapy than exposure therapy, available for those unable or unwilling to undergo exposure therapy.<ref name=\"Baer91\"/>  Cognitive therapy has been shown to be useful in reducing intrusive thoughts,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Deblinger E, Stauffer LB, Steer RA |title=Comparative efficacies of supportive and cognitive behavioral group therapies for young children who have been sexually abused and their nonoffending mothers |journal=Child Maltreat |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=332\u201343 |date=November 2001 |pmid=11675816 |doi= 10.1177/1077559501006004006}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sousa MB, Isolan LR, Oliveira RR, Manfro GG, Cordioli AV |title=A randomized clinical trial of cognitive-behavioral group therapy and sertraline in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=67 |issue=7 |pages=1133\u20139 |date=July 2006 |pmid=16889458 |doi= 10.4088/JCP.v67n0717}}</ref> but developing a conceptualization of the obsessions and compulsions with the patient is important.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Purdon C |title=Cognitive-behavioral treatment of repugnant obsessions |journal=J Clin Psychol |volume=60 |issue=11 |pages=1169\u201380 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15389619 |doi=10.1002/jclp.20081 }}</ref> One of the strategies sometimes used in Cognitive Behavioral Theory is mindfulness exercises.
