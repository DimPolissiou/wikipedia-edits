Groningen is a university city, with an estimated 31,000 students at the [[University of Groningen]] (1 October 2018), and an estimated 28,000 at the [[Hanze University of Applied Sciences, Groningen|Hanze University of Applied Sciences]] (1 October 2018).\n\n==History==\nThe city was founded at the northernmost point of the ''[[Hondsrug]]'' area. The oldest document referring to Groningen's existence dates from 1040. However, the city already existed long before then: the oldest archaeological traces found are believed to stem from the years 3950\u20133720 BC, although the first major settlement in Groningen has been traced back to the 3rd century AD.\n\nIn the 13th century, when Groningen was an important trade centre, its inhabitants built a [[city wall]] to underline its authority. The city had a strong influence on the surrounding lands and made its [[dialect]] a common tongue. The most influential period of the city was the end of the 15th century, when the nearby province of [[Friesland]] was administered from Groningen. During these years, the ''[[Martinitoren]]'', then {{convert|127|m|abbr=off}} tall, was built; it loomed over the city. The city's independence ended in 1536, when it chose to accept [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], the Habsburg ruler of the other Netherlands, as its overlord.\n\n[[File:Groningen 1565.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Groningen in the 16th century]]\nIn 1594, Groningen, until then held by Spain, [[Siege of Groningen (1594)|was captured]] by a Dutch and English force led by [[Maurice of Nassau]]. Soon afterwards the city and the province joined the [[Dutch Republic|Republic of the Seven United Provinces]].\n\nIn 1614, the [[University of Groningen]] was founded, initially only for [[Theology#Theology as an academic discipline|religious education]]. In the same period the city expanded rapidly and a new city wall was built. That same city wall was tested during the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1672, when the city was [[Siege of Groningen|attacked fiercely]] by the bishop of [[Bishopric of M\u00fcnster|M\u00fcnster]], [[Bernhard von Galen]]. The city walls resisted, an event that is still celebrated with music and fireworks on 28 August (as \"''[[:nl:Gronings Ontzet|Gronings Ontzet]]''\" or \"''Bommen Berend''\").\n[[File:Groningen-7.jpg|alt=|thumb|280px|Der Aa Church and the Canal (2018)]]\nThe city did not escape the devastation of [[World War II]]. In particular, the main square, the Grote Markt, was largely destroyed in April 1945 in the [[Battle of Groningen]]. However, the ''Martinitoren'', its church, the ''[[Goudkantoor]]'', and the city hall were not damaged. The battle lasted several days.\n\n==Geography==\n===Climate===\nGroningen has an oceanic temperate climate, like all of the Netherlands, although slightly colder in winter than other major cities in the Netherlands due to its northeasterly position. Weather is influenced by the North Sea to the north-west and its prevailing north-western winds and gales.\n\nSummers are somewhat warm and humid. Temperatures of {{convert|30|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} or higher occur sporadically; the average daytime high is around {{convert|22|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Very rainy periods are common, especially in spring and summer. Average annual precipitation is about {{convert|800|mm|0|abbr=on}}. Annual sunshine hours vary, but are usually below 1600&nbsp;hours, giving much cloud cover similar to most of the Netherlands.  Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round.  The [[K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification]] subtype for this climate is \"[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification#GROUP C: Mild Temperate/mesothermal climates|Cfb]]\". (Marine West Coast Climate/[[Oceanic climate]]).<ref>[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=592559&cityname=Groningen%2C+Groningen%2C+Netherlands&units= Climate Summary for Groningen]</ref>\n\nWinters are cool: on average above freezing, although frosts are common during spells of easterly wind from Germany, Russia and even Siberia. Night-time temperatures of {{convert|-10|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} or lower are not uncommon during cold winter periods. The lowest temperature ever recorded is {{convert|-26.8|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}} on 16 February 1956. Snow often falls, but rarely stays long due to warmer daytime temperatures, although white snowy days happen every winter. \n{{Groningen weatherbox}}\n\n== Population growth ==\n[[File:Martini2.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Martinitoren|Martini Tower]]]]\n[[File:Eyecatcher (23907089).jpeg|thumb|280px|High Rise Office of ministry of Education]]\nThe municipality of Groningen has grown rapidly.

Before closing down, its sugar production amounted to 250,000 [[tonnes]] of [[beet sugar]], with 250 employees (2005 figures). The only remaining sugar factory is ''CSM Vierverlaten'' in [[Hoogkerk]], which produces 235,000&nbsp;tonnes of beet sugar, with 283 employees.\n\nWell known companies from Groningen are publishing company [[Noordhoff Uitgevers]], tobacco company [[Royal Theodorus Niemeyer]], health insurance company Menzis, distillery [[Hooghoudt distillery|Hooghoudt]], and natural gas companies GasUnie and [[GasTerra]].

A large network of bike paths makes it convenient to cycle to various destinations. In 2000, Groningen was chosen as ''[[Cycling in the Netherlands|Fietsstad 2002]]'' \u2014 top BikeCity of the Netherlands for 2002.\n\nThe city is very much adapted to the wishes of those who want to get around without a car, as it has an extensive network of segregated cycle-paths, good public transport, and a large pedestrianised zone in the city centre. The transformation of the historic centre into a pedestrian priority zone enables and invites walking and biking. This is achieved by applying the principle of [[Permeability (spatial and transport planning)|\"filtered permeability\"]]. It means that the network configuration favours [[active transportation]] and selectively \"filters out\" the car by reducing the number of streets that run through the centre. While certain streets are discontinuous for cars, they connect to a network of pedestrian and bike paths which permeate the entire centre.

[[Gronings]]: {{lang|gos|Grunnen}}) is the main municipality as well as the capital city of the [[Groningen (province)|eponymous province]] in the [[Netherlands]]. It is the largest city in the north of the Netherlands and has 231,037 inhabitants (31 January 2019) on a total area of {{convert|180.21|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, and land area of {{convert|168.93|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} with a population density of 1,367 per km<sup>2</sup> (3,540 per square mile). It merged with [[Ten Boer]] and [[Haren, Groningen|Haren]] municipalities in 1 January 2019. The [[Groningen-Assen metropolitan area]] has about half a million inhabitants. Groningen is an old city (more than 950 years) and was the regional power of the north of the Netherlands, a semi-independent city-state and member of the German [[Hanseatic League]]. Groningen is a university city, with an estimated 31,000 students at the [[University of Groningen]] (1 October 2018), and an estimated 28,000 at the [[Hanze University of Applied Sciences, Groningen|Hanze University of Applied Sciences]] (1 October 2018).\n\n==History==\nThe city was founded at the northernmost point of the ''[[Hondsrug]]'' area. The oldest document referring to Groningen's existence dates from 1040. However, the city already existed long before then: the oldest archaeological traces found are believed to stem from the years 3950\u20133720 BC, although the first major settlement in Groningen has been traced back to the 3rd century AD.\n\nIn the 13th century, when Groningen was an important trade centre, its inhabitants built a [[city wall]] to underline its authority. The city had a strong influence on the surrounding lands and made its [[dialect]] a common tongue. The most influential period of the city was the end of the 15th century, when the nearby province of [[Friesland]] was administered from Groningen. During these years, the ''[[Martinitoren]]'', then {{convert|127|m|abbr=off}} tall, was built; it loomed over the city. The city's independence ended in 1536, when it chose to accept [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], the Habsburg ruler of the other Netherlands, as its overlord.\n\n[[File:Groningen 1565.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Groningen in the 16th century]]\nIn 1594, Groningen, until then held by Spain, [[Siege of Groningen (1594)|was captured]] by a Dutch and English force led by [[Maurice of Nassau]]. Soon afterwards the city and the province joined the [[Dutch Republic|Republic of the Seven United Provinces]].\n\nIn 1614, the [[University of Groningen]] was founded, initially only for [[Theology#Theology as an academic discipline|religious education]]. In the same period the city expanded rapidly and a new city wall was built. That same city wall was tested during the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1672, when the city was [[Siege of Groningen|attacked fiercely]] by the bishop of [[Bishopric of M\u00fcnster|M\u00fcnster]], [[Bernhard von Galen]]. The city walls resisted, an event that is still celebrated with music and fireworks on 28 August (as \"''[[:nl:Gronings Ontzet|Gronings Ontzet]]''\" or \"''Bommen Berend''\").\n[[File:Groningen-7.jpg|alt=|thumb|280px|Der Aa Church and the Canal (2018)]]\nThe city did not escape the devastation of [[World War II]]. In particular, the main square, the Grote Markt, was largely destroyed in April 1945 in the [[Battle of Groningen]]. However, the ''Martinitoren'', its church, the ''[[Goudkantoor]]'', and the city hall were not damaged. The battle lasted several days.\n\n==Geography==\n===Climate===\nGroningen has an oceanic temperate climate, like all of the Netherlands, although slightly colder in winter than other major cities in the Netherlands due to its northeasterly position. Weather is influenced by the North Sea to the north-west and its prevailing north-western winds and gales.\n\nSummers are somewhat warm and humid. Temperatures of {{convert|30|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} or higher occur sporadically; the average daytime high is around {{convert|22|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Very rainy periods are common, especially in spring and summer. Average annual precipitation is about {{convert|800|mm|0|abbr=on}}. Annual sunshine hours vary, but are usually below 1600&nbsp;hours, giving much cloud cover similar to most of the Netherlands.  Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round.  The [[K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification]] subtype for this climate is \"[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification#GROUP C: Mild Temperate/mesothermal climates|Cfb]]\". (Marine West Coast Climate/[[Oceanic climate]]).<ref>[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=592559&cityname=Groningen%2C+Groningen%2C+Netherlands&units= Climate Summary for Groningen]</ref>\n\nWinters are cool: on average above freezing, although frosts are common during spells of easterly wind from Germany, Russia and even Siberia. Night-time temperatures of {{convert|-10|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} or lower are not uncommon during cold winter periods. The lowest temperature ever recorded is {{convert|-26.8|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}} on 16 February 1956. Snow often falls, but rarely stays long due to warmer daytime temperatures, although white snowy days happen every winter. \n{{Groningen weatherbox}}\n\n== Population growth ==\n[[File:Martini2.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Martinitoren|Martini Tower]]]]\n[[File:Eyecatcher (23907089).jpeg|thumb|280px|High Rise Office of ministry of Education]]\nThe municipality of Groningen has grown rapidly.

The [[Suiker Unie]] plant was originally outside Groningen, but it was completely swallowed by the expansion of the city. After a campaign to close the factory, it was finally shut down in 2008/2009. Before closing down, its sugar production amounted to 250,000 [[tonnes]] of [[beet sugar]], with 250 employees (2005 figures). The only remaining sugar factory is ''CSM Vierverlaten'' in [[Hoogkerk]], which produces 235,000&nbsp;tonnes of beet sugar, with 283 employees.\n\nWell known companies from Groningen are publishing company [[Noordhoff Uitgevers]], tobacco company [[Royal Theodorus Niemeyer]], health insurance company Menzis, distillery [[Hooghoudt distillery|Hooghoudt]], and natural gas companies GasUnie and [[GasTerra]].

The large number of students living in Groningen also contributes to a diverse cultural scene for a city of its size.\n\nSince 2016 Groningen is host of the [[International Cycling Film Festival]], an annual film festival for bicycle related films. It takes place in the art house cinema of the old Roman Catholic Hospital.\n\n===Museums===\n[[File:Groninger_Forum.jpg|right|thumb|280px|Forum Groningen]]\nThe most famous museum in Groningen is the [[Groninger Museum]].

Vera is located on the Oosterstraat, the Grand Theatre on the Grote Markt, and Simplon on the Boterdiep. Several caf\u00e9s feature live music, a few of which specialize in jazz music, including ''Jazzcafe De Spieghel'' on the Peperstraat. The jazz music students from the [[Prince Claus Conservatoire]] have been known to hold regular jam sessions in caf\u00e9s such as ''Peter Pan'' on the ''Voor Het Voormalige Klein Poortje'' and ''caf\u00e9 De Smederij'' on the Tuinstraat 2\u20134. Groningen is also the host city for [[Eurosonic Noorderslag]], an annual music showcase event for over a hundred bands from all over Europe.\n\n===Nightlife===\nGroningen's nightlife depends largely on its student population. Its cultural scene is vibrant and remarkable for a city its size. In particular, the Grote Markt, the Vismarkt, the Poelestraat and Peperstraat are crowded every night of the week, and most bars do not close until 5 in the morning.

A large network of bike paths makes it convenient to cycle to various destinations. In 2000, Groningen was chosen as ''[[Cycling in the Netherlands|Fietsstad 2002]]'' \u2014 top BikeCity of the Netherlands for 2002.\n\nThe city is very much adapted to the wishes of those who want to get around without a car, as it has an extensive network of segregated cycle-paths, good public transport, and a large pedestrianised zone in the city centre. The transformation of the historic centre into a pedestrian priority zone enables and invites walking and biking. This is achieved by applying the principle of [[Permeability (spatial and transport planning)|\"filtered permeability\"]]. It means that the network configuration favours [[active transportation]] and selectively \"filters out\" the car by reducing the number of streets that run through the centre. While certain streets are discontinuous for cars, they connect to a network of pedestrian and bike paths which permeate the entire centre. In addition, these paths go through public squares and open spaces, increasing the enjoyment of the trip (see image). The logic of filtering a mode of transport is fully expressed in a comprehensive model for laying out neighbourhoods and districts \u2013 the [[fused grid]].\n\n===Public transport===\n====Train's<ref>https://nieuws.ns.nl/spoorkaart-2020-hier-te-downloaden/</ref>====\n[[File:20080430_Hoofdstation_Groningen_NL.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Groningen_railway_station|Railway station ]] Groningen (2008)]]\nThe Station of [[Groningen railway station|Groningen]] or Hoofdstation as the locals call it, has regular services to most of the major cities in the Netherlands.

{"title_page": "Anti-bureaucratic revolution", "text_new": "{{Milo\u0161evi\u0107 sidebar}}\nThe '''anti-bureaucratic revolution''' was a campaign of street protests by supporters of Serbian leader [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] that ran between 1988 and 1989 in [[Yugoslavia]]. The protests overthrew the governments of the Serbian autonomous provinces of [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina|Vojvodina]] and [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|Kosovo]], as well as the government of the [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro]], and replaced them with allies of Milo\u0161evi\u0107, thereby creating a dominant voting bloc within the [[Presidency of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav presidency council]].\n\nThe name ''anti-bureaucratic revolution'' is derived from the proclaimed revolt against bureaucratic and [[political corruption|corrupt governing structures]].\n\nThe events were condemned by the [[communist]] governments of the western Yugoslav republics (especially [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|SR Slovenia]] and [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|SR Croatia]]), who successfully resisted the attempts to expand the revolt onto their territories, and turned against Milo\u0161evi\u0107. The rising antagonism eventually resulted in the dissolution of the ruling [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] in 1990, and subsequently in the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]].\n\nThese protests were in support of [[nationalism|Serbian nationalism]], a centralized [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Economic liberalism|economic liberalism]], and [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107| Milo\u0161evi\u0107]].\n\n==Prelude==\n{{expert needed| reason=Institutional access required to verify source in this section|talk=Prelude: Milo\u0161evi\u0107's rise to power |date=January 2016}}\n\nSince the adoption of the 1974 Constitution of Yugoslavia, Serbia and its two autonomous provinces Kosovo and Vojvodina entered into political deadlock with the provincial governments in Kosovo and Vojvodina.{{sfn|Jovi\u0107|2008|p=172}} In 1976 the Serbian government issued its first complaints of unconstitutional practice of autonomy by the provinces to Tito and [[Edvard Kardelj]] and issued a subsequent complaint in 1984 on the matter, attempting to resolve the problems within the 1974 Constitution.{{sfn|Jovi\u0107|2008|pp=173\u2013174}} It was reported that the provinces had repeatedly denied the Serbian government the ability to enact policies in their territories, such as regulation of citizenship policy, common defense law, and [[Social policy|social plans]].{{sfn|Jovi\u0107|2008|p=174}}\n\nThe situation in Kosovo became a crisis in the [[1981 protests in Kosovo]] by Albanians who were heard shouting slogans such as \"We are Albanians, not Yugoslavs\", \"Kosova Republic\", \"Unity with Albania\", \"Long live Marxism-Leninism, Down with Revisionism\" and others.{{sfn|Jovi\u0107|2008|p=185}} The presence of ethnic and ideological dimensions to the protestors' demands led to Yugoslav authorities deciding to forcibly stop the protests. The president of the Pristina League of Communists, Aslan Fazlia (an Albanian) said that the protests were nationalistic and counterrevolutionary and announced tough police action against the demonstrators.{{sfn|Jovi\u0107|2008|p=185}} This action failed to quell the protests that instead grew in response with protests by Albanians sweeping across Kosovo, the President of the League of Communists of Kosovo [[Mahmut Bakalli]] decided in response to ask the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) to bring tanks onto the streets.{{sfn|Jovi\u0107|2008|p=185}} Police reinforcements from [[Central Serbia]] were stopped by a roadblock and then Albanian demonstrators took hostages from thirty-four houses of Serbs and Montenegrins, demanding that these police forces leave Kosovo in exchange for the release of the hostages.{{sfn|Jovi\u0107|2008|pp=185\u2013186}} Only after additional police forces from Pri\u0161tina arrived were the hostages released.{{sfn|Jovi\u0107|2008|pp=185\u2013186}} The protests led to vandalism throughout Kosovo including smashed windows of cars, shops, and state institutions.{{sfn|Jovi\u0107|2008|pp=185\u2013186}} The Yugoslav leadership declared a \"crisis situation in Kosovo\" and all republics were requested to send their police troops to Kosovo.{{sfn|Jovi\u0107|2008|pp=185\u2013186}} The Yugoslav leadership was shocked by the extent of the violence used by the demonstrators and the relatively large participation in the demonstrations.{{sfn|Jovi\u0107|2008|pp=185\u2013186}}\n\nThe aftermath of the 1981 protests in Kosovo resulted in resentment by Serbs in Kosovo to the political situation in Kosovo.{{sfn|Crampton|2013|p=148}} Serbs suspected that deliberate [[Albanianization]] of Kosovo and Serbs being driven out was demonstrated by statistics showing that the population of Serbs in Kosovo had significantly decreased from 23.5% in 1961 to 13.2% in 1981, as well as making claims that they were being persecuted by Albanians including that Serb women were being systematically raped by Albanians.{{sfn|Crampton|2013|p=148}} Many of these claims were not backed up by factual evidence but built up as popular rumours believed amongst Serbs in Kosovo.{{sfn|Crampton|2013|p=148}}\n\nMilo\u0161evi\u0107 took control of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]]'s [[League of Communists of Serbia|Serbian branch]] in September 1987, when his faction won over its opposition, led by [[Ivan Stamboli\u0107]]. His rise to power coincided with Serbo-Albanian tensions in [[Kosovo]], as [[Serbs of Kosovo|Kosovo Serbs]] felt oppressed by [[Albanians in Kosovo|Albanians]] and the Albanian-dominated leadership of the province. The tensions were further boosted by inflammatory reports in the Serbian media.\n\nAccording to the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution|1974 Yugoslav constitution]], the two [[autonomous province]]s of Serbia ([[Vojvodina]] and Kosovo) were largely independent from the central Serbian government, with both of them holding a seat in the Yugoslav Presidency, on a par with the six constituent republics of Yugoslavia. In effect, their status was almost equivalent to the republics', which enabled provincial leaderships of Kosovo and Vojvodina to have policies that were practically independent.\n\nIn late 1987 and 1988, a populist campaign started in Serbia against this situation, which it described as untenable. Provincial leaderships were being accused of bureaucratic inefficiency and alienation from the people. Popular slogans like \"Oh Serbia in three parts, you will be whole again\" (\u041e\u0458 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u043e \u0438\u0437 \u0442\u0440\u0438 \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e \u045b\u0435\u0448 \u0431\u0438\u0442\u0438 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u0430, ''oj Srbijo iz tri dela ponovo \u0107e\u0161 biti cela'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nin.co.rs/arhiva/2431/1.html|title=Duh Belog dvora|publisher=[[NIN (magazine)|NIN]]|date=1997-08-01|author=Petar Ignja|language=Serbian}}</ref> caught on. The atmosphere was further stirred up by numerous articles and readers' letters in Serbian press, the most notorious being ''[[Politika]]'''s rubric \"Odjeci i reagovanja\" (''Echoes and reactions''), a [[letters to the editor]] column which was used as a type of [[astroturfing]].<ref name=\"Politika\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GkBmdCwHuDsC&pg=PA550&lpg=PA550&dq=anti-bureaucratic+revolution\n|title=Politika in the Storm of Nationalism|author=Aleksandar Nenadovi\u0107|year=1993|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=978-963-9116-56-6}}</ref>{{sfn|Milosavljevi\u0107|2003}}\n\nThe main points of the campaign were the following:<ref name=kearns>{{cite journal|title=Western Intervention and the Promotion of Democracy in Serbia|author=Ian Kearns|publisher=The Political Quarterly|pages=23|year=1999|volume=70|issue=1|issn=0032-3179|doi=10.1111/1467-923X.00201|journal=The Political Quarterly}}</ref>\n*Serbs in Kosovo were being harassed by Albanians and suppressed by the Albanian-dominated Kosovo government\n*Due to the 1974 constitution, Serbia had no effective control over its provinces, whose leaderships were bureaucratic and estranged from the people\n*This constitution was created by the influence of the other Yugoslav republics, especially Slovenia and Croatia, in order to suppress Serbia's power and create an environment for the exploitation of Serbia's natural resources\n*The constitution had, in effect, created a [[confederal]] type of government, as no decision could be made without the [[consensus]] of all six republics in the federal parliament; and a system with a better consideration of popular majority was called for (the slogan \"[[one man, one vote]]\" was one of the most popular)\n*Therefore, a thorough revision of the federal constitution and the enhancement of Serbian control over its provinces were necessary\n\n==Protests==\nThe mass protests started in February 1986, with several meetings of Kosovo Serbs in [[Belgrade]] and in Kosovo, pleading for a resolution of the problematic situation on Kosovo. These were relatively small, with 100-5,000 participants, and were mostly reactions to individual inter-ethnic incidents. The largest such protest was held in [[Kosovo Polje]] in April 1987, gathering around 20,000 people.{{sfn|Milosavljevi\u0107|2003}}\n\nHowever, the outburst of protests began in the latter half of 1988. In June, the protest of workers of the [[Zmaj (factory)|Zmaj]] factory gathered 5,000 protestors; in July, meetings were held in seven towns with tens of thousands protesters, and in August in ten towns with 80,000 people. By September they spread to 39 towns with over 400,000 people.{{sfn|Milosavljevi\u0107|2003}}\n\n===Vojvodina (October 1988)===\nOn 5 October 1988, around 150,000 people gathered in [[Novi Sad]] to protest against the Vojvodina provincial government. The gathering started a day earlier in the nearby town of [[Ba\u010dka Palanka]], and, as ''Politika'' explained it, people spontaneously gathered and moved on to Novi Sad, the provincial capital.{{sfn|Milosavljevi\u0107|2003}} The protest in Ba\u010dka Palanka was led by [[Mihalj Kertes]], a mid-level official of the Communist Party, an ethnic [[Hungarians in Vojvodina|Hungarian]] who would later become famous for his remark \"How can you Serbs be afraid of Serbia when I, a Hungarian, am not afraid of Serbia?\"<ref name=\"Kertes\">{{cite web|title=Crash of Yugoslavia's Money Man|\nurl=http://listserv.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0011&L=justwatch-l&O=D&P=77111|author=Michael Dobbs|publisher=Washington Post Foreign Service|date=2000-11-29}}</ref> (and later still, as Milo\u0161evi\u0107's money man). Protesters from Novi Sad and other parts of Serbia gathered in huge numbers, and began the protest in front of the provincial [[Parliament of Vojvodina]].\n\nThe provincial leadership, led by [[Milovan \u0160ogorov]], [[Bo\u0161ko Kruni\u0107]] and [[\u017divan Berisavljevi\u0107]], were caught by surprise. Before the event, they tried to compromise and negotiate with Milo\u0161evi\u0107, expressing cautious support for the constitutional changes while trying to keep their and Vojvodina's position intact. However, the avalanche of media campaign orchestrated from Belgrade was about to overwhelm them; they were labelled as power-hungry \"[[Armchair revolutionary|armchair]]ers\" (\u0444\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0459\u0430\u0448\u0438 / ''fotelja\u0161i'') and \"autonomists\" (\u0430\u0443\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0448\u0438 / ''autonoma\u0161i'').<ref name=\"NIN\">{{cite web|title=Vojvodina:U\u017eegli jogurt|date=1998-10-15|url=http://www.nin.co.rs/arhiva/2494/6.html|author=Petar Ignja|publisher=NIN|language=Serbian}}</ref>\n\nThe Vojvodina government then cut off power and water supply to protesters, a move which enraged them further still, and caused even more people from Novi Sad and its vicinity to join. When power was restored, they tried a different tactic: in order to cheer the demonstrators up, they gave them bread and [[yogurt]]. However, thousands of yogurt packages were soon thrown at the Parliament building by angry protesters. That term \"Yogurt Revolution\" for the protest was named after that episode.<ref name=\"Kerenji\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aENQit9KT0sC&pg=RA2-PA354&lpg=RA2-PA354&dq=Yogurt+revolution+Novi+Sad|\ntitle=Serbia Since 1989: Politics And Society Under Milosevic And After (pp 350\u2013379)|author=Emil Kerenji|editor=[[Sabrina Petra Ramet]]|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-295-98538-1}}</ref>\n\nOn October 6, the entire collective leadership of Vojvodina resigned and were soon replaced with Milo\u0161evi\u0107's men of trust [[Nedeljko \u0160ipovac]], Radovan Pankov and [[Radoman Bo\u017eovi\u0107]]. The Vojvodina representative in the Central Committee of [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|SKJ]], Bo\u0161ko Kruni\u0107, resigned and was replaced by Stanko Radmilovi\u0107, while the President of the Central Committee of the [[League of Communists of Vojvodina|SKV]], Milovan \u0160ogorov, resigned and was replaced by Bogosav Kova\u010devi\u0107.\n\n===U\u0161\u0107e rally===\nThe rally in [[Belgrade]], at [[U\u0161\u0107e, Belgrade|U\u0161\u0107e]] (the large field at confluence of [[Sava|Sava River]] into [[Danube]]) was held on November 19, 1988. According to the state press, it gathered about a million people, and according to others, several hundred thousands. It was conceived as a \"mother of all rallies\", and a huge crowd of people come from all parts of Serbia by public and factory buses taken just for this opportunity. Milo\u0161evi\u0107 reaffirmed his and Serbia's confinement to the principles of liberty and Serbian equity within Yugoslavia:<ref name=\"Bg\">{{cite web|url=http://www.beograd.rs/cms/view.php?id=201267|title=Disintegration Years 1988\u20132000|publisher=Assembly of Belgrade}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>We will win the battle for [[Kosovo]] regardless of the obstacles placed in front of us in the country and abroad.

In order to deal with the situation the leadership proclaimed the [[state of emergency]]. The state of emergency did not last long, as it was taken as an act of hostility towards Serbia by media outlets controlled by Milo\u0161evi\u0107 as well as Milo\u0161evi\u0107's supporters in Montenegro.<ref name=\"Vreme\">{{cite web|title=Serbian President: The Technology Of A Showdown|url=http://www.scc.rutgers.edu/serbian_digest/153/t153-3.htm|publisher=Vreme|author=Milan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, Filip \u0160varm|date=1994-08-29}}</ref>\n\nThe second act started with joint rallies consisting of workers from Radoje Daki\u0107, a state-owned factory, and [[Veljko Vlahovi\u0107 University]] students.

The League of Communists of Montenegro was subsequently transformed by the \"triumvirate\" who had full control over the (Socialist) Republic of Montenegro into the [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro]], which vigorously maintained its grip over Montenegro and does so to this day more than 20 years later.\n\n===Toppling of Kosovar leadership and reduction of autonomy===\n[[Azem Vllasi]] and [[Kaqusha Jashari]], the two top-ranked Kosovo politicians, were replaced in November 1988.{{sfn|Milosavljevi\u0107|2003}} The Albanian population of Kosovo grew restless, and in February 1989 they engaged in a general strike, particularly manifesting itself in the [[1989 Kosovo miners' strike]].

The protests overthrew the governments of the Serbian autonomous provinces of [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina|Vojvodina]] and [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|Kosovo]], as well as the government of the [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro]], and replaced them with allies of Milo\u0161evi\u0107, thereby creating a dominant voting bloc within the [[Presidency of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav presidency council]].\n\nThe name ''anti-bureaucratic revolution'' is derived from the proclaimed revolt against bureaucratic and [[political corruption|corrupt governing structures]].\n\nThe events were condemned by the [[communist]] governments of the western Yugoslav republics (especially [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|SR Slovenia]] and [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|SR Croatia]]), who successfully resisted the attempts to expand the revolt onto their territories, and turned against Milo\u0161evi\u0107. The rising antagonism eventually resulted in the dissolution of the ruling [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] in 1990, and subsequently in the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]].\n\nThese protests were in support of [[nationalism|Serbian nationalism]], a centralized [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Economic liberalism|Free Market economic reforms]], and [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107| Milo\u0161evi\u0107]].\n\n==Prelude==\n{{expert needed| reason=Institutional access required to verify source in this section|talk=Prelude: Milo\u0161evi\u0107's rise to power |date=January 2016}}\n\nSince the adoption of the 1974 Constitution of Yugoslavia, Serbia and its two autonomous provinces Kosovo and Vojvodina entered into political deadlock with the provincial governments in Kosovo and Vojvodina.{{sfn|Jovi\u0107|2008|p=172}} In 1976 the Serbian government issued its first complaints of unconstitutional practice of autonomy by the provinces to Tito and [[Edvard Kardelj]] and issued a subsequent complaint in 1984 on the matter, attempting to resolve the problems within the 1974 Constitution.{{sfn|Jovi\u0107|2008|pp=173\u2013174}} It was reported that the provinces had repeatedly denied the Serbian government the ability to enact policies in their territories, such as regulation of citizenship policy, common defense law, and [[Social policy|social plans]].{{sfn|Jovi\u0107|2008|p=174}}\n\nThe situation in Kosovo became a crisis in the [[1981 protests in Kosovo]] by Albanians who were heard shouting slogans such as \"We are Albanians, not Yugoslavs\", \"Kosova Republic\", \"Unity with Albania\", \"Long live Marxism-Leninism, Down with Revisionism\" and others.{{sfn|Jovi\u0107|2008|p=185}} The presence of ethnic and ideological dimensions to the protestors' demands led to Yugoslav authorities deciding to forcibly stop the protests. The president of the Pristina League of Communists, Aslan Fazlia (an Albanian) said that the protests were nationalistic and counterrevolutionary and announced tough police action against the demonstrators.{{sfn|Jovi\u0107|2008|p=185}} This action failed to quell the protests that instead grew in response with protests by Albanians sweeping across Kosovo, the President of the League of Communists of Kosovo [[Mahmut Bakalli]] decided in response to ask the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) to bring tanks onto the streets.{{sfn|Jovi\u0107|2008|p=185}} Police reinforcements from [[Central Serbia]] were stopped by a roadblock and then Albanian demonstrators took hostages from thirty-four houses of Serbs and Montenegrins, demanding that these police forces leave Kosovo in exchange for the release of the hostages.{{sfn|Jovi\u0107|2008|pp=185\u2013186}} Only after additional police forces from Pri\u0161tina arrived were the hostages released.{{sfn|Jovi\u0107|2008|pp=185\u2013186}} The protests led to vandalism throughout Kosovo including smashed windows of cars, shops, and state institutions.{{sfn|Jovi\u0107|2008|pp=185\u2013186}} The Yugoslav leadership declared a \"crisis situation in Kosovo\" and all republics were requested to send their police troops to Kosovo.{{sfn|Jovi\u0107|2008|pp=185\u2013186}} The Yugoslav leadership was shocked by the extent of the violence used by the demonstrators and the relatively large participation in the demonstrations.{{sfn|Jovi\u0107|2008|pp=185\u2013186}}\n\nThe aftermath of the 1981 protests in Kosovo resulted in resentment by Serbs in Kosovo to the political situation in Kosovo.{{sfn|Crampton|2013|p=148}} Serbs suspected that deliberate [[Albanianization]] of Kosovo and Serbs being driven out was demonstrated by statistics showing that the population of Serbs in Kosovo had significantly decreased from 23.5% in 1961 to 13.2% in 1981, as well as making claims that they were being persecuted by Albanians including that Serb women were being systematically raped by Albanians.{{sfn|Crampton|2013|p=148}} Many of these claims were not backed up by factual evidence but built up as popular rumours believed amongst Serbs in Kosovo.{{sfn|Crampton|2013|p=148}}\n\nMilo\u0161evi\u0107 took control of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]]'s [[League of Communists of Serbia|Serbian branch]] in September 1987, when his faction won over its opposition, led by [[Ivan Stamboli\u0107]]. His rise to power coincided with Serbo-Albanian tensions in [[Kosovo]], as [[Serbs of Kosovo|Kosovo Serbs]] felt oppressed by [[Albanians in Kosovo|Albanians]] and the Albanian-dominated leadership of the province. The tensions were further boosted by inflammatory reports in the Serbian media.\n\nAccording to the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution|1974 Yugoslav constitution]], the two [[autonomous province]]s of Serbia ([[Vojvodina]] and Kosovo) were largely independent from the central Serbian government, with both of them holding a seat in the Yugoslav Presidency, on a par with the six constituent republics of Yugoslavia. In effect, their status was almost equivalent to the republics', which enabled provincial leaderships of Kosovo and Vojvodina to have policies that were practically independent.\n\nIn late 1987 and 1988, a populist campaign started in Serbia against this situation, which it described as untenable. Provincial leaderships were being accused of bureaucratic inefficiency and alienation from the people. Popular slogans like \"Oh Serbia in three parts, you will be whole again\" (\u041e\u0458 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u043e \u0438\u0437 \u0442\u0440\u0438 \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e \u045b\u0435\u0448 \u0431\u0438\u0442\u0438 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u0430, ''oj Srbijo iz tri dela ponovo \u0107e\u0161 biti cela'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nin.co.rs/arhiva/2431/1.html|title=Duh Belog dvora|publisher=[[NIN (magazine)|NIN]]|date=1997-08-01|author=Petar Ignja|language=Serbian}}</ref> caught on. The atmosphere was further stirred up by numerous articles and readers' letters in Serbian press, the most notorious being ''[[Politika]]'''s rubric \"Odjeci i reagovanja\" (''Echoes and reactions''), a [[letters to the editor]] column which was used as a type of [[astroturfing]].<ref name=\"Politika\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GkBmdCwHuDsC&pg=PA550&lpg=PA550&dq=anti-bureaucratic+revolution\n|title=Politika in the Storm of Nationalism|author=Aleksandar Nenadovi\u0107|year=1993|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=978-963-9116-56-6}}</ref>{{sfn|Milosavljevi\u0107|2003}}\n\nThe main points of the campaign were the following:<ref name=kearns>{{cite journal|title=Western Intervention and the Promotion of Democracy in Serbia|author=Ian Kearns|publisher=The Political Quarterly|pages=23|year=1999|volume=70|issue=1|issn=0032-3179|doi=10.1111/1467-923X.00201|journal=The Political Quarterly}}</ref>\n*Serbs in Kosovo were being harassed by Albanians and suppressed by the Albanian-dominated Kosovo government\n*Due to the 1974 constitution, Serbia had no effective control over its provinces, whose leaderships were bureaucratic and estranged from the people\n*This constitution was created by the influence of the other Yugoslav republics, especially Slovenia and Croatia, in order to suppress Serbia's power and create an environment for the exploitation of Serbia's natural resources\n*The constitution had, in effect, created a [[confederal]] type of government, as no decision could be made without the [[consensus]] of all six republics in the federal parliament; and a system with a better consideration of popular majority was called for (the slogan \"[[one man, one vote]]\" was one of the most popular)\n*Therefore, a thorough revision of the federal constitution and the enhancement of Serbian control over its provinces were necessary\n\n==Protests==\nThe mass protests started in February 1986, with several meetings of Kosovo Serbs in [[Belgrade]] and in Kosovo, pleading for a resolution of the problematic situation on Kosovo. These were relatively small, with 100-5,000 participants, and were mostly reactions to individual inter-ethnic incidents. The largest such protest was held in [[Kosovo Polje]] in April 1987, gathering around 20,000 people.{{sfn|Milosavljevi\u0107|2003}}\n\nHowever, the outburst of protests began in the latter half of 1988. In June, the protest of workers of the [[Zmaj (factory)|Zmaj]] factory gathered 5,000 protestors; in July, meetings were held in seven towns with tens of thousands protesters, and in August in ten towns with 80,000 people. By September they spread to 39 towns with over 400,000 people.{{sfn|Milosavljevi\u0107|2003}}\n\n===Vojvodina (October 1988)===\nOn 5 October 1988, around 150,000 people gathered in [[Novi Sad]] to protest against the Vojvodina provincial government. The gathering started a day earlier in the nearby town of [[Ba\u010dka Palanka]], and, as ''Politika'' explained it, people spontaneously gathered and moved on to Novi Sad, the provincial capital.{{sfn|Milosavljevi\u0107|2003}} The protest in Ba\u010dka Palanka was led by [[Mihalj Kertes]], a mid-level official of the Communist Party, an ethnic [[Hungarians in Vojvodina|Hungarian]] who would later become famous for his remark \"How can you Serbs be afraid of Serbia when I, a Hungarian, am not afraid of Serbia?\"<ref name=\"Kertes\">{{cite web|title=Crash of Yugoslavia's Money Man|\nurl=http://listserv.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0011&L=justwatch-l&O=D&P=77111|author=Michael Dobbs|publisher=Washington Post Foreign Service|date=2000-11-29}}</ref> (and later still, as Milo\u0161evi\u0107's money man). Protesters from Novi Sad and other parts of Serbia gathered in huge numbers, and began the protest in front of the provincial [[Parliament of Vojvodina]].\n\nThe provincial leadership, led by [[Milovan \u0160ogorov]], [[Bo\u0161ko Kruni\u0107]] and [[\u017divan Berisavljevi\u0107]], were caught by surprise. Before the event, they tried to compromise and negotiate with Milo\u0161evi\u0107, expressing cautious support for the constitutional changes while trying to keep their and Vojvodina's position intact. However, the avalanche of media campaign orchestrated from Belgrade was about to overwhelm them; they were labelled as power-hungry \"[[Armchair revolutionary|armchair]]ers\" (\u0444\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0459\u0430\u0448\u0438 / ''fotelja\u0161i'') and \"autonomists\" (\u0430\u0443\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0448\u0438 / ''autonoma\u0161i'').<ref name=\"NIN\">{{cite web|title=Vojvodina:U\u017eegli jogurt|date=1998-10-15|url=http://www.nin.co.rs/arhiva/2494/6.html|author=Petar Ignja|publisher=NIN|language=Serbian}}</ref>\n\nThe Vojvodina government then cut off power and water supply to protesters, a move which enraged them further still, and caused even more people from Novi Sad and its vicinity to join. When power was restored, they tried a different tactic: in order to cheer the demonstrators up, they gave them bread and [[yogurt]].

According to the state press, it gathered about a million people, and according to others, several hundred thousands. It was conceived as a \"mother of all rallies\", and a huge crowd of people come from all parts of Serbia by public and factory buses taken just for this opportunity.

Meanwhile, on February 28, another major rally was held in Belgrade, where the chants \"We want weapons\" and \"Arrest Vllasi\" were heard, and three days later, Vllasi was indeed placed under arrest.{{sfn|Milosavljevi\u0107|2003}}\n\nIn early 1989, the [[Parliament of Serbia]] had proposed constitutional amendments that would have significantly reduced SAP Kosovo's autonomous status within SR Serbia.{{sfn|Krieger|2001|p=522}} Kosovo Albanians organized large demonstrations against these moves,{{sfn|Krieger|2001|p=522}} but in March 1989, preceding a final push for the ratification of constitutional changes in the Assembly of Kosovo, the Yugoslav police rounded up around 240 prominent Kosovo Albanians, apparently selected based on their anti-ratification sentiment, and detained them with complete disregard for [[due process]].{{sfn|Anderson|1990|pp=27\u201329}}\n\nAlbanian representatives in the [[Parliament of Kosovo]] boycotted the vote on the matter on March 23, 1989, but regardless of the failure of the motion to meet the required two-thirds majority, it was declared to have passed.{{sfn|Krieger|2001|p=522}} On March 28, the Serbian parliament approved the constitutional changes.{{sfn|Krieger|2001|p=522}}\n\n===Gazimestan rally===\n{{Main article|Gazimestan speech}}\nThe largest rally of all was held at [[Gazimestan]] on 28 June 1989, gathering two million according to ''[[Politika]]''.{{sfn|Milosavljevi\u0107|2003}}\n\n===Action North===\n\nWhen a \"Rally of Truth\" ({{lang-sl|Miting resnice}}) was attempted in [[Ljubljana]], [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|SR Slovenia]] in December 1989, in an action named '''Action North''' Slovene police forces prevented it with the help of Croatian police forces.

This was Sir Roger Moore's final film appearance and the film was dedicated to his memory; Moore portrayed Templar in a [[The Saint (TV series)|1960s TV series of the same title]]. Filmed in 2013 as a [[television pilot]] for a proposed TV series, the film was not originally intended for release when the series was not picked up. It eventually saw release direct-to-video in 2017 when it was released in tribute to Moore following his death. [[Ian Ogilvy]], who portrayed Templar in a 1970s TV series titled ''[[Return of the Saint]]'', also appears.\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[Simon Templar]] intervenes when terrorists attempt to trade gold to the [[Russian Ground Forces|Russian Army]] for bombs. After subduing both parties, he takes most of the gold and escapes, leaving his calling card as \"The Saint\". Agent Cooper of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] has been monitoring the meeting.\n\n[[President of Nigeria|Nigerian President]] Ezekiel Ibaka secures $2.5 billion in private aid for his country, but a mysterious man ([[Ian Ogilvy]]) instructs associate Arnie Valecross, a private banker with criminal ties, to steal the funds. He gives Valecross a ring, claiming that it is an heirloom he took from \"someone pathetic\". \n\nTemplar takes the gold from the Moscow heist to an old friend in [[Bucharest]]. He gives instructions to distribute the funds among various [[humanitarian aid]] organizations. \n\nIn [[Los Angeles]], Valecross diverts the funds to one of his own accounts and requests protection from the FBI. His mysterious employer sends his henchman, Rayt Marius, to kidnap Valecross' daughter Zooey, giving Arnie only 48 hours to return the money. \n\nIn [[Paris, France]], Templar hears of the Nigerian theft and agrees to help recover the funds. Simon's friend [[Patricia Holm]] and the FBI each use their own methods to quickly identify the thief as Valecross and track him to the Grand Del Mar Resort in [[San Diego]].\n\nSpecial Agent John Henry Fernack, who has been pursuing The Saint for years, gets to Valecross' suite first and unsuccessfully attempts to question him. Templar uses the adjoining room to break into Valecross' suite, but he is discovered. Valecross asks Templar to rescue his daughter. Marius uses a helicopter to fire on Templar through the window. Templar shoots down the helicopter, but Valecross is fatally wounded. As he dies, Valecross tells Templar, \"The account numbers are in your ring, the key is in the nomad.\"\n\nSimon and Patricia engage Doyle Cosentino to develop a new plan now that Valecross is dead. It is revealed that Simon met Patricia in Iraq while escaping from the Russian deal. The trio search for the \"nomad\" in Valecross' home. Mrs Valecross immediately recognizes Templar. They decide to call Marius, who has a history with Patricia.\n\nFernack obtains help from the Los Angeles Police Department in the form of Detective Garces ([[Greg Grunberg]]). The two men nearly catch Simon when he, Patricia and Doyle leave the Valecross home. The trio notice the men tailing them and escape. Fernack catches up to Templar on a [[funicular]] railway car in a busy retail area. Simon overpowers and handcuffs him, escaping by jumping onto a car moving in the opposite direction. Simon, Patricia and Doyle visit former counterfeiter Sonali Alves in her hidden [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]] fighting studio and gambling den. They ask for help breaking into Valecross' data storage facility. She forces Simon to battle a fighter in the ring while handcuffed in exchange for the heist gear he needs. During the fight, Simon's handcuffs are broken and he easily defeats his opponent.\n\nEntering the storage facility, Patricia knocks out the guards. She guides Simon as he penetrates the security on two heavy duty doors and disables the pressure-sensitive floor. He uses a glove that mimics fingerprints of a building employee to access the computer server room, and begins searching for the account data. Fernack arrives too late and Simon escapes with the data, locking Fernack in the server room. Outside, Templar finds that Garces has been shot and that Marius has captured Patricia.\n\nFernack agrees to work with Simon to rescue Patricia and Zooey. Overpowering the armed guards on the boat, they attempt to trade the stolen funds for Marius' hostages. Marius reveals that Patricia is his ex-wife and that he is working for the man who killed Simon's parents. Fernack tries to rescue Zooey but is restrained by her stepmother, who is working with Marius. Templar shoots Marius when tries to use Zooey as a shield and Patricia knocks him to the floor. Marius refuses to identify his employer. \n\nZooey returns the money to President Ibaka. Templar evades Fernack. \n\nThe mysterious man calls for help from an associate ([[Roger Moore]]) who refuses him, knowing their superiors will make an example of him for his failure. Simon tails the mystery man, recognizing him as his parents' killer by a unique tattoo on his arm. Templar identifies him as Xander, hired by Simon's father to train Simon to fight as a youth. Resisting the urge to kill the man, Templar allows Xander to be arrested by Agent Cooper on terrorism charges. Simon disappears from sight.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Adam Rayner]] as [[Simon Templar]]\n* [[Eliza Dushku]] as [[Patricia Holm]]\n* Sir [[Roger Moore]] as Jasper\n* [[James Remar]] as Arnold Valecross\n* [[Ian Ogilvy]] as The Fixer/older Xander\n* [[Adam Woodward]] as Xander\n* [[Enrique Murciano]] as Inspector John Henry Fernack \n* [[Sammi Hanratty]] as Zooey Valecross\n* [[Greg Grunberg]] as Detective Garces\n* [[Thomas Kretschmann]] as Rayt Marius\n* [[Yani Gellman]] as Doyle Cosentino\n* Kristy Mitchell as Mrs. Templar\n* [[Beatrice Rosen]] as Katherine Valecross\n* [[Melissa Bolona]] as Guest Star\n* [[Jason Brooks (actor)|Jason Brooks]] as Captain Miller\n* [[Christopher Villiers]] as Arthur Templar\n* [[Louis Hynes]] as Young Simon Templar\n* [[Femi Elufowoju Jr.]] as Ezekiel Ibaka\n* [[Alec Secareanu]] as Bashir\n* [[Richard Ashton]] as Vadim / Gerry\n* [[Andrew Pleavin]] as Andrei\n* Sonalii Castillo as Sonali Alves\n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\n\nIn December 2012, it was announced that [[Roger Moore]] would produce a new series to star [[Adam Rayner]] as Simon Templar and [[Eliza Dushku]] as his assistant Patricia Holm.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bedfordshire-news.co.uk/Lifestyle-and-leisure/Movies/The-Saint-is-back-Dr-who-miranda-adam-rayner-eliza-dushku-buffy-dollhouse-roger-moore.htm |title=The Saint Is Back |work= Bedfordshire-news.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/12/eliza-dushku-to-co-star-in-the-saint-backdoor-pilot-roger-moore-to-co-produce/ |title=Eliza Dushku To Co-Star In \u2018The Saint\u2019 Backdoor Pilot, Roger Moore To Co-Produce |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref> In a later promotion , it was also shown that Moore would star in the new series, as would his successor in ''Return of the Saint'', [[Ian Ogilvy]].

On a new website, titled \"The Black Sheep Dog\", Corapi wrote:\n\n<blockquote>There are certain persons in authority in the Church that want me gone, and I shall be gone...They can't prove I'm guilty of the things alleged because I'm not, and they can't prove I'm innocent because that is simply illogical and impossible...My canon lawyer and my civil lawyers have concluded that I cannot receive a fair and just hearing under the Church's present process.  </blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The Church will conclude that I am not cooperating with the process because I refuse to give up all of my civil and human rights in order to hold harmless anyone who chooses to say defamatory and actionable things against me with no downside to them. ... I am, indeed, not ready to be extinguished. Under the name \"The Black Sheep Dog,\" I shall be with you through radio broadcasts and writing. My autobiography, ''The Black Sheep Dog'', is almost ready for publication. My topics will be broader than in the past, and my audience likewise is apt to be broader. I'll do what I can under the circumstances.<ref name=\"bsd\" /></blockquote>\n\nOn July 5, 2011, Father Gerald Sheehan, Corapi's religious superior in the Society of Our Lady of the Trinity, released a press statement accusing Corapi of drug and alcohol abuse, \"[[sexting]]\", having an affair with a former prostitute, and violating his promise of poverty as a perpetually professed member of the society by owning more than $1 million in real estate, numerous luxury vehicles, motorcycles, an ATV, a boat dock, and several motor boats. He stated, \"SOLT's prior direction to Fr. John Corapi not to engage in any preaching or teaching, the celebration of the sacraments or other public ministry continues. Catholics should understand that SOLT does not consider Fr. John Corapi as fit for ministry.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soltnews.blogspot.com/2011/07/press-release-concerning-fr-john-corapi.html|title=Press Release Concerning Fr John Corapi from SOLT Regional Priest Servant|first=Gerard|last=Sheehan|date=July 5, 2011|accessdate=July 5, 2011|publisher=Society of Our Lady of the Trinity}}</ref>\n\nOn July 7, 2011, Corapi announced that he would not obey Sheehan's order to relocate from Montana and take up residence in a house of the society.
