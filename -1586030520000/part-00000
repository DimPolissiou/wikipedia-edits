They are in the same vehicle class as the discontinued [[Ford E series]] and [[Dodge Ram van]].\n\nThe term ''Chevrolet van'' also refers to the entire series of vans sold by Chevrolet.  The first '''Chevrolet van''' was released in 1961 on the Corvair platform, and the latest Chevrolet van in production is the [[Chevrolet Express]].\n\nThe G20 and its counterparts replaced the original [[Chevrolet Corvair]] Greenbrier Van which was manufactured until 1965. First fielded in the mid-1960s, the model line evolved until it was replaced in 1996 by the [[Chevrolet Express]].  1964-70 G20s came with six-lug wheels (6 lugs - 5.5\" (139.6&nbsp;mm) [[wikt:bolt circle|bolt circle]]), while the 1971\u20131995 generation came with the 5 lug - 5\" (127&nbsp;mm) bolt circle.\n\nG20s were fitted with the ball joints from the Chevrolet/GMC \u00be- and 1-ton pickups although using the \u00bd ton pickup's brake rotors.\n\nA light duty version, the G10, was produced alongside the G20\u2014the early versions used the Chevrolet passenger car wheels (5 lugs - 4.75\" (120.7&nbsp;mm) bolt circle) until 1975 (G10s manufactured prior to the 1976 model year had the smaller bolt pattern, common with the short wheelbase vans), yet can still handle LT tire sizes for better handling and stability. The G20 series sported an SB 262 4.3L engine, not much was changed mechanically in the vehicles since their release, other than carburetor to a throttle body injection fuel system, and less use of a vacuum system. Currently there are more after market part options available for its V8 counterparts. Not much has been done in the lines of performance options for the small V6 G20 models, but the reliability remains the same throughout all the G-series models.\n\nThe G20's low cost of upkeep, size, and options have made this van popular with all different kinds of trades, from plumbers to caterers.\n\n== First generation (1964\u20131966)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|image=OldChevyVan.jpg\n|name= First generation\n|aka=Chevrolet Sportvan<br>GMC Handi-Van<br>GMC Handi-Bus\n|production=1964\u20131966\n|assembly=[[Pontiac, Michigan]], U.S.\n|manufacturer=[[General Motors]]\n|class=[[Compact van]]\n|body_style=3+1 door [[van]]\n|layout=[[FMR layout]]\n|engine=[[Chevrolet 153 4-cylinder engine|{{convert|153|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br>[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#194|{{convert|194|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br>[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#230|{{convert|230|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]\n|wheelbase=SWB: {{convert|2286|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}}}\n\nThe first [[General Motors]] van was the [[Chevrolet Corvair]]-based [[Chevrolet Greenbrier]] van, or Corvan introduced for 1961, which used a [[flat-6]] [[Opposed piston engine|opposed]] [[rear engine]] with [[Air-cooled engine|air cooling]], inspired by the [[Volkswagen Type 2|Volkswagen bus]].  Production of the [[Chevrolet Greenbrier]] ended during the 1965 model year.\n\n''First-generation Chevyvan'' refers to the first G-10 half-ton production years 1964 through 1966.  [[General Motors]] saw a market for a [[compact van]] based on a modified passenger car platform to compete with the already successful [[Ford E series|Ford Econoline]] and [[Dodge A100]]. The 1964 Chevyvan had a cab forward design with the [[engine]] placed in a \"doghouse\" between and behind the front seats. The implementation of situating the driver on top of the front axle with the engine near the front wheels is called internationally a \"[[cab over]]\" vehicle. Engines and brakes were sourced from the [[Chevy II]], a more conventional [[compact car]] than [[Chevrolet Corvair]].    This model was also sold by [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] as \"Handi-Van\".  The 1st Gen vans were available in only the short 90-inch wheelbase and were only sold with the standard 90&nbsp;hp 153-cubic-inch [[straight-4]] or [[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine]].  A first gen is quickly identified by its single piece flat windshield glass.  The first 1964 Chevyvan was originally marketed and sold as a panel van for purely utilitarian purposes.  Windows were available as an option, but were simply cut into the sides from the factory.   In 1965, Chevy added \"Sportvan\", which featured windows actually integrated into the body.  GMC marketed their window van as \"Handi-Bus\". Air conditioning, power steering and power brakes were not available in the 1st generation vans.\n\n===Updates===\n\n====1964====\nThe original \"classic\" flat windshield van. The 90&nbsp;hp (67&nbsp;kW) 153 cu in (2.51 L) four-cylinder engine was standard equipment with optional 120&nbsp;hp (89&nbsp;kW) 194 cu in (3.18 L) [[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine]] available.  The straightforward construction and a boxy design was ideal for economically hauling cargo, tools and equipment around town.  The base cargo model was the Chevyvan, available with or without windows and side cargo doors. Even the heater and right front passenger seat were optional.\nThe Warner 3-speed [[manual transmission]] was standard with column shift.  A 2-speed [[Powerglide]] [[automatic transmission]] was available as an option.\n\n====1965====\nFor 1965, the van remained largely unchanged.  The grille openings were widened, and received one additional slot just above the bumper to increase cooling.  Seat belts were added.\nThe exciting news for the 1965 model year was the introduction of the Chevy Sportvan and GMC Handi-Bus.  Sportvan was a passenger friendly van with windows molded into the van body.  A retractable rear courtesy step for the passenger side doors was used on the Sportvan.\nThe 194 6-cylinder engine was now standard equipment, with an available 'Hi-Torque' 140&nbsp;hp (100&nbsp;kW) 230 cu in (3.8 L) six-cylinder\n\n====1966====\nThis was the last year of the flat glass front end on the Chevy Vans.  Changes for 1966 include the addition of back-up lights, the side Chevyvan emblems were moved forward and now mounted on the front doors, and the antennae location was moved from the right side to the left side.  The base model \"Sportvan\" now had two additional trim packages available: Sportvan Custom and Sportvan Deluxe.  These featured available upgrades such as chrome bumpers, two tone paint, rear passenger seats, interior paneling, padded dash, chrome horn ring.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=={{anchor|2nd|second}}Second generation (1967\u20131970)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|image=1968 Sportvan Custom 108.jpg\n|name= Second generation\n|aka=Chevrolet Sportvan<br>GMC Handi-Van<br>GMC Handi-Bus\n|production=1967\u20131970\n|assembly=[[Pontiac, Michigan]], U.S.\n|manufacturer=[[General Motors]]\n|class=[[Van]]\n|body_style=3+1 door [[van]]\n|layout=[[FMR layout]]\n|engine=[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#230|{{convert|230|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br>[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#250|{{convert|250|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br>[[Chevrolet small-block engine#283|{{convert|283|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>[[Chevrolet small-block engine#307|{{convert|307|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>[[Chevrolet small-block engine#350|{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|wheelbase=SWB: {{convert|2286|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}<br>LWB: {{convert|2743|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\nIn 1967, Chevy Van received a major facelift, including moving the headlights down to a new redesigned grille, larger, rectangular tail lights and a curved windshield.  The forward control cab design was retained, but the doghouse was lengthened, widened and slightly relocated in order to fit an optional [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine]].  Engine cooling was improved with the addition of an optional larger cross-flow type radiator and a redesigned front  which included a low-profile tunnel allowing more fresh air to the radiator. The 2nd gen vans were available in either the 90-inch or the longer 108-inch wheelbase. Power steering and \"conventional\" air conditioning (with dash vents & controls)  were never available on the second-generation van.\n\n===1967===\nThe \"second-generation\" Chevy Van began with the 1967 model, with a whole new look to the van and offering a longer 108\" wheelbase and V8 power to buyers for the first time.  GM designers moved the headlights down to a new grille, added longer, rectangular tail lights and a rounded glass windshield.  1967 was the only early 2nd generation  that did not have side marker lights. The forward control cab design was retained, but the doghouse was widened and lengthened in order to fit the optional [[V8 engine|V8]] [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine]].  Engine cooling was improved with redesigned doghouse, the addition of a larger optional cross-flow type radiator and a redesigned front floor tunnel more fresh air to the radiator. The 2nd gen G-10 vans were available in the original short wheelbase {{convert|90|in|mm|0}} or the new optional long wheelbase {{convert|108|in|mm|0|adj=on}} with 5 on 4&3/4\" lug bolt pattern.  Another feature in 1967 was the availability of a new G-20 heavy duty 3/4 ton van.  The G-20 featured heavier suspension, a 12 bolt rear axle and increased hauling capability with a 6 lug bolt pattern.  The G-20 model was available only on the 108 long wheelbase.\nFor 1967, the 140&nbsp;hp (100&nbsp;kW) 230 cu in (3.8 L) six-cylinder was now standard, with the optional 155&nbsp;hp (116&nbsp;kW) 250 cu in (4.1 L) six-cylinder or the 175&nbsp;hp, 283 cu in (4.64 L) 2-barrel, [[V8 engine|V8]]. Brakes were now upgraded to a safer split system including a dual reservoir [[master cylinder]].\n\n===1968===\nThis was the first year that Chevy vans had side-marker lights, mandated by federal government regulations. The front lights were located towards the front in the middle of the front doors, while the rear marker lights were located about a foot inward of the very back edge just below the vertical middle of the van.\n\nThe optional V-8 engine was upgraded from the 283 2-barrel (175&nbsp;HP) to the larger, more powerful 307 2-barrel V8 (200&nbsp;HP at 4600 rpm, 300 lbs-ft torque at 2400 RPM).\n\nA column shift 4-speed transmission (Borg-Warner T10) was now available as an option, and you could get power brakes (option # J70) on the G20 3/4 tons vans.\n\n===1969===\nFor the 1969 model year, the 3-speed TH-350 [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] [[automatic transmission]] was an option.\n\n\"Body-integrated\" air conditioning was an offered on the Sportvan models. This was not your typical AC setup with dash vents and controls, but rather a roof-mounted unit with a single blower duct that had adjustable louvers to direct air flow. The AC unit was independent from the cabin heater. It was operated by a single knob on a roof control panel that turned on the AC and allowed you to select the fan speed. With no actual temperature control, fan speed was the only way to adjust for desired comfort level.\n\nUp front, the Chevrolet bowtie emblem changed in color from red to blue this year.\n\n===1970===\n1970 was the last year of the square styling, front drum brakes, and I-beam front axle.  The 250 CID 6-cylinder (155Hp at 4200 rpm) was now standard equipment. In addition to the 307-2-barrel V-8, a 350-4-barrel (255&nbsp;HP at 4600 rpm, 355 lbs-ft torque at 3000 rpm) V-8 engine may have been available as an option for the first time in 1970. It's not clear whether the 350 engine was available, since it's referenced in the owner's manual, but not mentioned in the dealer brochures. The 3-speed automatic and manual 4-speed column shift continued to be available as transmission options.\n\nAir conditioning may not have been available in 1970. It's not listed as an option in a detailed 12-page brochure, and unlike 1969, there is no mention of it in the owner's manual.\n\n== Third generation (1971\u20131995) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = Chevrolet Beauville -- 01-17-2011.jpg\n| name = Third generation\n| aka = Chevrolet Beauville<br />Chevrolet Bonaventure<br />Chevrolet G series<br />[[Chevrolet Nomad]]<br />Chevrolet Sport Van<br />GMC Rally Wagon<br />GMC Vandura<br />Chevrolet Bonanza\n| production = 1971&ndash;1995\n| manufacturer = [[General Motors]]\n| class = Full-size [[van]]\n| body_style = 3-door [[van]]<br />3+1 door [[wagon]]<br />4-door [[van]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|110|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (SWB)<br />{{convert|125|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (LWB)<br />{{convert|146|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (EWB)\n| length = {{convert|178.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (SWB)<br />{{convert|202.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (LWB)<br />{{convert|223.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (EWB)\n| width = {{convert|79.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|79.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (SWB)<br />{{convert|79.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (LWB)<br />{{convert|79.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (SWB)<br />{{convert|81.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (LWB)\n| engine = [[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#250|4.1L]] [[Straight-6|I6]]<br />[[General Motors 90\u00b0 V6 engine#LB1 and LB4|4.3L]] [[V6]]<br />[[Chevrolet small-block engine#307|5.0L]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br />[[Chevrolet small-block engine#350|5.7L]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br />[[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#L29|7.4L]] V8<br />[[Detroit Diesel V8 engine#6.2 L|6.2L diesel V8]] (1982\u201393)<br />[[Detroit Diesel V8 engine#6.5 L|6.5L diesel V8]] (1994\u201395)\n| layout = [[Car layout#Front-engine, rear-wheel_drive|Front-engine, rear-wheel drive]] / [[four-wheel drive]]\n| transmission = 3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />4-speed automatic<br />3-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]<br />4-speed manual\n| assembly = [[Lordstown, Ohio]], United States<br />[[Flint, Michigan]], United States<br />[[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]], [[Ontario]], Canada\n| related = [[Chevrolet C/K|Chevrolet/GMC C/K]]\n}}\n[[File:GMC Vandura Campwagon.jpg|thumb|left|GMC Vandura Campwagon]]\n[[File:Chevrolet Conversion Van (Auto classique Laval '11).JPG|thumb|left|Chevrolet Conversion Van]]\nIn 1971, Chevy Van received a major redesign, moving the engine forward of the driver with a short front clip and hood. Its UK-built counterpart, the [[Bedford CF]] (introduced in 1970), had a similar design and look, but with different specifications. The van was constructed of a solid frame and thicker floor pan steel. GM also employed stronger truck style hubs and brakes with dual A-arm independent front suspension. The major restyle followed the engine-forward design of the competing 1968 [[Ford E series|Ford Econoline]]. Suspension and steering parts came from the [[Chevrolet C/K]]. GMC now marketed their vans under the VanDura name, while the Chevrolet equivalent vans were now given a \"G\" designation (G10, G20, and G30).\n\nFor the 1996 model year, the Chevrolet and GMC vans were replaced with the next-generation [[Chevrolet Express]] and GMC Savana with more aerodynamic styling. These vans were built on a stronger truck frame versus the previous generation's unibody construction. A left-side door was made available for the passenger van market.\n\n=== Engines ===\nThe third generation GM van was fitted with a variety of engines over its lifetime. A 4.1L (250 CID) straight six was the base engine, this was replaced by the 4.3L V6 in 1985. The 4.3L initially used a four-barrel carburetor; this was updated to TBI fuel injection in 1987. 5.0L and 5.7L small block V8s were the mainstay engines, these were also updated to fuel injection in 1987. A 7.4-liter V8 ({{Convert|230-255|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|385|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3600 rpm) was added in 1990, exclusive to the G30. The transmission choices were a three-speed manual, three-speed automatic, four-speed manual, or 4-speed automatic, depending on the model year. Chevrolet also offered, in 1982\u20131995, the [[Detroit Diesel V8 engine]].\n\n=== Updates ===\n==== 1971 ====\nAll new bodystyle was introduced this year, which continued until the end of the 1995 model year. The Vandura and sister Chevy Van replaced the earlier flat front end model. The GMCs were introduced in April 1970; interior components such as the steering column and steering wheel were sourced from the [[Chevrolet C/K]] pickups. The short wheelbase vans measured {{convert|110|in|mm|0}}, while the long wheelbase was {{convert|125|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase. Clear blinker housings were used on early models, along with blue grille ornaments Chevrolet models.\n\n==== 1973 ====\nFor 1973, the dashboard was redesigned, steering wheel and side fender badges became similar to that used on the new for 1973 pickups and the Chevrolet bowtie grille emblem was changed from blue to yellow. In these 73-77 Chevy Van years you could order a custom van of your dreams, complete with shag carpet and side pipe exhaust from the comfort of the Chevrolet dealership, through a company called \"Van-Tastic\" owned by Hop Cap Inc. in Bremen, Indiana. During the same period, GMC offered cutaway versions called the MagnaVan, while Chevrolet offered a similar version called the \"Hi-Cube Van.\" In 1975 the Chevy G20 series had a Surveyor line of class B motorhomes offered by Futura. The Surveyor came equipped with a bathroom, refrigerator, stove/oven, hot/cold sink and sleeping for four. The Surveyor is almost identical to the Open Road line of class B coaches offered by Chevrolet but the production numbers are significantly fewer.\n\n==== 1978 ====\n[[File:78-82 Chevrolet Van.jpg|thumb|left|1980\u20131982 Chevrolet Van]]\nThe front sheet metal was updated. Changes include a new, built-out plastic grille with integrated blinkers (grille assembly sourced from the C/K truck), different fenders, round headlamps on lower-end models and square headlamps on higher-end models. The dashboard was redesigned and would remain mostly unchanged until the end of production in 1995. Front and rear bumpers were enlarged. Chrome grille required square headlamps.\n\n1979 <ref>CGL159XXXXXX</ref>\nThere is a Concept Pre-production Built in 1979 Model G 10 Chevrolet Panel Van Veh. WT. 01800 Reg. Gross WT. 02500\n\n==== 1980-1983 ====\nAll 1980 vans were given new rear-view mirrors on the driver and passenger doors. Some models got electronic spark control.\n[[File:Chevrolet Sportvan Beauville.jpg|thumb|left|1981 Chevrolet Sportvan Beauville]]\nChevrolet offers Bonaventure trim for 1981 and 82 with chrome bumpers, chrome side marker lights and trim around the tail lamps. Also, the only G-series vans that had chrome grille and round headlamps from the factory. Any other G van with a chrome grille from 1978-1982 required the rectangular headlamp option. For 1982, the locking steering column was introduced; the ignition switch, dimmer switch and wiper switch were relocated to the steering column.\n\nAfter 1982, 3-speed manuals would be relocated to the floor and base models will no longer have round headlamps, which would make Manual Transmission 1982 G vans rare and collectable as 1982 was the only model year with column shift manual transmission and ignition switch on the steering column. Also, 1982 was the only year with the left rear glass as an option on one side only.\n[[File:Long Beach Comic Expo 2012 - A-Team van (7186650356).jpg|thumb|Custom 1983 [[The A-Team|A-Team]] van]]\nThe 6.2-litre Diesel was first available and four headlamps, stacked in pairs, were introduced, along with a revised grille. Base models continued with two headlamps. All van models now had rectangular headlamps. From this model year on, tilt steering was available with a manual transmission, because the steering column was retilted to be similar to the C/K trucks and all manual transmission levers wee now on the floor. New steering wheels were introduced as well to be similar to the Monte Carlo/Malibu. Automatic overdrive was introduced. 4-speed manual 117M transmission was introduced. This version was made famous by the American television series ''[[The A-Team]]''.\n\n==== 1984-1989 ====\nNew swing-out side doors were introduced to go with the standard sliding side door. The doors were a 60/40 split. It was the final year for chrome trim side marker lamps and chrome trim around tail lamps options. For 1985, the taillight and side marker lenses were redesigned. New grille treatment similar to the pickups. Front doors were redesigned with raised body line. For 1986 and 1987, most engines were fuel-injected and a 4.3-liter [[V6]] replaced the old 4.1-liter [[Straight-6|inline six]] 115&nbsp;hp. A 6.2-litre Diesel engine was available in 165&nbsp;hp. A carbureted 5.7-liter 152&nbsp;hp [[V8 engine]] (option LE9) was also available in the 49-state version, with fuel injection for California-emission vehicles only. In 1989, a TBI 454 C.I. G30 was introduced.\n\n==== 1990 ====\nUnlike the [[Dodge Ram Wagon]] and [[Ford Econoline]] vans, which had a welded-on body extension, a {{convert|146|in|mm|0|adj=on}} extended wheelbase<ref>{{Cite web|title=1990 Chevy Van/Vandura|url=https://www.gmheritagecenter.com/docs/gm-heritage-archive/vehicle-information-kits/G-Van/1990-Chevrolet-G-Van.pdf|website=www.gmheritagecenter.com|publisher=GM Heritage Center|access-date=26 November 2014}}</ref> was introduced (about the same length as a Chevrolet/GMC crew cab truck). This was done to accommodate an extra bench seat, finally giving GM a 15-passenger van. GM was the last American automaker to produce such a van, with Dodge introducing the genre in 1971 and Ford joining them in 1978.\n\n==== 1992-1995 ====\n[[File:GMC-Vandura-Rally.jpg|thumb|right|GMC Vandura Rally]]\nIn 1992, there was a facelift using the front grille from the former Chevrolet/GMC R/V-series pickups and [[SUV]]s ([[Chevrolet K5 Blazer|Blazer]], [[Chevrolet Suburban|Suburban]], Crew Cab/Dually), previously phased out of production in 1991.\nG30 models getting the 4L80E transmission as standard. The 4L80E/4L60E [[automatic transmission]] was introduced, replacing the TH400/TH700R4. Brake-shift interlock became a standard, new-for-1993 feature, which required the brake pedal to be depressed in order to shift from park. A 4-wheel antilock brake system was also a standard, new-for-1993 feature. For 1994, a driver's side airbag and center high mount stop lamp were made standard, as well as CFC-free refrigerant in models equipped with air conditioning. For 1995, a new longer nose and four-headlamp design was introduced (similar to the C/K of the same era), which became a very popular school bus conversion. The engine was also revised, with the 4.3L V6, now labeled the \"Vortec\". Engine sizes remained about the same (4.3L, 5.7L, 7.4L, and a 6.5L normally-aspirated Diesel). Several versions of the van were available for purchase depending on the buyer's needs. The base trim was essentially a stripped down model, with no frills, a very limited interior, and no rear seats. The \"Sportvan\" had all the features of a full conversion van, but lacked rear seats and a fiberglass roof extension. Finally, the \"Conversion\" models were sent from the factory bare-bones, to have the interior and exterior upgrades added by third-party companies such as \"Mark III, Tiara, Coach, Starcraft, etc.\"\n\n==Concept vehicles==\nIn 1966, General Motors developed the [[concept vehicle]] Electrovan, based on the GMC Handi-Van.  The vehicle used a [[Union Carbide]] cryogenic [[fuel cell]] to power a 115-horsepower electric motor.  It never went into production due to cost issues and safety concerns.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/17/business/private-sector-an-electrovan-not-an-edsel.html?scp=1&sq=An%20Electrovan,%20Not%20an%20Edsel |title=Private Sector; An Electrovan, Not an Edsel |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2002-11-17 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\nThere is a Concept Pre-production Built in 1979 G 10 Panel Van\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Hall, Douglas Kent (1977).

They are in the same vehicle class as the discontinued [[Ford E series]] and [[Dodge Ram van]].\n\nThe term ''Chevrolet van'' also refers to the entire series of vans sold by Chevrolet.  The first '''Chevrolet van''' was released in 1961 on the Corvair platform, and the latest Chevrolet van in production is the [[Chevrolet Express]].\n\nThe G20 and its counterparts replaced the original [[Chevrolet Corvair]] Greenbrier Van which was manufactured until 1965. First fielded in the mid-1960s, the model line evolved until it was replaced in 1996 by the [[Chevrolet Express]].  1964-70 G20s came with six-lug wheels (6 lugs - 5.5\" (139.6&nbsp;mm) [[wikt:bolt circle|bolt circle]]), while the 1971\u20131995 generation came with the 5 lug - 5\" (127&nbsp;mm) bolt circle.\n\nG20s were fitted with the ball joints from the Chevrolet/GMC \u00be- and 1-ton pickups although using the \u00bd ton pickup's brake rotors.\n\nA light duty version, the G10, was produced alongside the G20\u2014the early versions used the Chevrolet passenger car wheels (5 lugs - 4.75\" (120.7&nbsp;mm) bolt circle) until 1975 (G10s manufactured prior to the 1976 model year had the smaller bolt pattern, common with the short wheelbase vans), yet can still handle LT tire sizes for better handling and stability. The G20 series sported an SB 262 4.3L engine, not much was changed mechanically in the vehicles since their release, other than carburetor to a throttle body injection fuel system, and less use of a vacuum system. Currently there are more after market part options available for its V8 counterparts. Not much has been done in the lines of performance options for the small V6 G20 models, but the reliability remains the same throughout all the G-series models.\n\nThe G20's low cost of upkeep, size, and options have made this van popular with all different kinds of trades, from plumbers to caterers.\n\n== First generation (1964\u20131966)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|image=OldChevyVan.jpg\n|name= First generation\n|aka=Chevrolet Sportvan<br>GMC Handi-Van<br>GMC Handi-Bus\n|production=1964\u20131966\n|assembly=[[Pontiac, Michigan]], U.S.\n|manufacturer=[[General Motors]]\n|class=[[Compact van]]\n|body_style=3+1 door [[van]]\n|layout=[[FMR layout]]\n|engine=[[Chevrolet 153 4-cylinder engine|{{convert|153|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br>[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#194|{{convert|194|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br>[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#230|{{convert|230|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]\n|wheelbase=SWB: {{convert|2286|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}}}\n\nThe first [[General Motors]] van was the [[Chevrolet Corvair]]-based [[Chevrolet Greenbrier]] van, or Corvan introduced for 1961, which used a [[flat-6]] [[Opposed piston engine|opposed]] [[rear engine]] with [[Air-cooled engine|air cooling]], inspired by the [[Volkswagen Type 2|Volkswagen bus]].  Production of the [[Chevrolet Greenbrier]] ended during the 1965 model year.\n\n''First-generation Chevyvan'' refers to the first G-10 half-ton production years 1964 through 1966.  [[General Motors]] saw a market for a [[compact van]] based on a modified passenger car platform to compete with the already successful [[Ford E series|Ford Econoline]] and [[Dodge A100]]. The 1964 Chevyvan had a cab forward design with the [[engine]] placed in a \"doghouse\" between and behind the front seats. The implementation of situating the driver on top of the front axle with the engine near the front wheels is called internationally a \"[[cab over]]\" vehicle. Engines and brakes were sourced from the [[Chevy II]], a more conventional [[compact car]] than [[Chevrolet Corvair]].    This model was also sold by [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] as \"Handi-Van\".  The 1st Gen vans were available in only the short 90-inch wheelbase and were only sold with the standard 90&nbsp;hp 153-cubic-inch [[straight-4]] or [[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine]].  A first gen is quickly identified by its single piece flat windshield glass.  The first 1964 Chevyvan was originally marketed and sold as a panel van for purely utilitarian purposes.  Windows were available as an option, but were simply cut into the sides from the factory.   In 1965, Chevy added \"Sportvan\", which featured windows actually integrated into the body.  GMC marketed their window van as \"Handi-Bus\". Air conditioning, power steering and power brakes were not available in the 1st generation vans.\n\n===Updates===\n\n====1964====\nThe original \"classic\" flat windshield van. The 90&nbsp;hp (67&nbsp;kW) 153 cu in (2.51 L) four-cylinder engine was standard equipment with optional 120&nbsp;hp (89&nbsp;kW) 194 cu in (3.18 L) [[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine]] available.  The straightforward construction and a boxy design was ideal for economically hauling cargo, tools and equipment around town.  The base cargo model was the Chevyvan, available with or without windows and side cargo doors. Even the heater and right front passenger seat were optional.\nThe Warner 3-speed [[manual transmission]] was standard with column shift.  A 2-speed [[Powerglide]] [[automatic transmission]] was available as an option.\n\n====1965====\nFor 1965, the van remained largely unchanged.  The grille openings were widened, and received one additional slot just above the bumper to increase cooling.  Seat belts were added.\nThe exciting news for the 1965 model year was the introduction of the Chevy Sportvan and GMC Handi-Bus.  Sportvan was a passenger friendly van with windows molded into the van body.  A retractable rear courtesy step for the passenger side doors was used on the Sportvan.\nThe 194 6-cylinder engine was now standard equipment, with an available 'Hi-Torque' 140&nbsp;hp (100&nbsp;kW) 230 cu in (3.8 L) six-cylinder\n\n====1966====\nThis was the last year of the flat glass front end on the Chevy Vans.  Changes for 1966 include the addition of back-up lights, the side Chevyvan emblems were moved forward and now mounted on the front doors, and the antennae location was moved from the right side to the left side.  The base model \"Sportvan\" now had two additional trim packages available: Sportvan Custom and Sportvan Deluxe.  These featured available upgrades such as chrome bumpers, two tone paint, rear passenger seats, interior paneling, padded dash, chrome horn ring.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=={{anchor|2nd|second}}Second generation (1967\u20131970)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|image=1968 Sportvan Custom 108.jpg\n|name= Second generation\n|aka=Chevrolet Sportvan<br>GMC Handi-Van<br>GMC Handi-Bus\n|production=1967\u20131970\n|assembly=[[Pontiac, Michigan]], U.S.\n|manufacturer=[[General Motors]]\n|class=[[Van]]\n|body_style=3+1 door [[van]]\n|layout=[[FMR layout]]\n|engine=[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#230|{{convert|230|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br>[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#250|{{convert|250|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br>[[Chevrolet small-block engine#283|{{convert|283|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>[[Chevrolet small-block engine#307|{{convert|307|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>[[Chevrolet small-block engine#350|{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|wheelbase=SWB: {{convert|2286|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}<br>LWB: {{convert|2743|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\nIn 1967, Chevy Van received a major facelift, including moving the headlights down to a new redesigned grille, larger, rectangular tail lights and a curved windshield.  The forward control cab design was retained, but the doghouse was lengthened, widened and slightly relocated in order to fit an optional [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine]].  Engine cooling was improved with the addition of an optional larger cross-flow type radiator and a redesigned front  which included a low-profile tunnel allowing more fresh air to the radiator. The 2nd gen vans were available in either the 90-inch or the longer 108-inch wheelbase. Power steering and \"conventional\" air conditioning (with dash vents & controls)  were never available on the second-generation van.\n\n===1967===\nThe \"second-generation\" Chevy Van began with the 1967 model, with a whole new look to the van and offering a longer 108\" wheelbase and V8 power to buyers for the first time.  GM designers moved the headlights down to a new grille, added longer, rectangular tail lights and a rounded glass windshield.  1967 was the only early 2nd generation  that did not have side marker lights. The forward control cab design was retained, but the doghouse was widened and lengthened in order to fit the optional [[V8 engine|V8]] [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine]].  Engine cooling was improved with redesigned doghouse, the addition of a larger optional cross-flow type radiator and a redesigned front floor tunnel more fresh air to the radiator. The 2nd gen G-10 vans were available in the original short wheelbase {{convert|90|in|mm|0}} or the new optional long wheelbase {{convert|108|in|mm|0|adj=on}} with 5 on 4&3/4\" lug bolt pattern.  Another feature in 1967 was the availability of a new G-20 heavy duty 3/4 ton van.  The G-20 featured heavier suspension, a 12 bolt rear axle and increased hauling capability with a 6 lug bolt pattern.  The G-20 model was available only on the 108 long wheelbase.\nFor 1967, the 140&nbsp;hp (100&nbsp;kW) 230 cu in (3.8 L) six-cylinder was now standard, with the optional 155&nbsp;hp (116&nbsp;kW) 250 cu in (4.1 L) six-cylinder or the 175&nbsp;hp, 283 cu in (4.64 L) 2-barrel, [[V8 engine|V8]]. Brakes were now upgraded to a safer split system including a dual reservoir [[master cylinder]].\n\n===1968===\nThis was the first year that Chevy vans had side-marker lights, mandated by federal government regulations. The front lights were located towards the front in the middle of the front doors, while the rear marker lights were located about a foot inward of the very back edge just below the vertical middle of the van.\n\nThe optional V-8 engine was upgraded from the 283 2-barrel (175&nbsp;HP) to the larger, more powerful 307 2-barrel V8 (200&nbsp;HP at 4600 rpm, 300 lbs-ft torque at 2400 RPM).\n\nA column shift 4-speed transmission (Borg-Warner T10) was now available as an option, and you could get power brakes (option # J70) on the G20 3/4 tons vans.\n\n===1969===\nFor the 1969 model year, the 3-speed TH-350 [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] [[automatic transmission]] was an option.\n\n\"Body-integrated\" air conditioning was an offered on the Sportvan models. This was not your typical AC setup with dash vents and controls, but rather a roof-mounted unit with a single blower duct that had adjustable louvers to direct air flow. The AC unit was independent from the cabin heater. It was operated by a single knob on a roof control panel that turned on the AC and allowed you to select the fan speed. With no actual temperature control, fan speed was the only way to adjust for desired comfort level.\n\nUp front, the Chevrolet bowtie emblem changed in color from red to blue this year.\n\n===1970===\n1970 was the last year of the square styling, front drum brakes, and I-beam front axle.  The 250 CID 6-cylinder (155Hp at 4200 rpm) was now standard equipment. In addition to the 307-2-barrel V-8, a 350-4-barrel (255&nbsp;HP at 4600 rpm, 355 lbs-ft torque at 3000 rpm) V-8 engine may have been available as an option for the first time in 1970. It's not clear whether the 350 engine was available, since it's referenced in the owner's manual, but not mentioned in the dealer brochures. The 3-speed automatic and manual 4-speed column shift continued to be available as transmission options.\n\nAir conditioning may not have been available in 1970. It's not listed as an option in a detailed 12-page brochure, and unlike 1969, there is no mention of it in the owner's manual.\n\n== Third generation (1971\u20131995) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = Chevrolet Beauville -- 01-17-2011.jpg\n| name = Third generation\n| aka = Chevrolet Beauville<br />Chevrolet Bonaventure<br />Chevrolet G series<br />[[Chevrolet Nomad]]<br />Chevrolet Sport Van<br />GMC Rally Wagon<br />GMC Vandura<br />Chevrolet Bonanza\n| production = 1971&ndash;1995\n| manufacturer = [[General Motors]]\n| class = Full-size [[van]]\n| body_style = 3-door [[van]]<br />3+1 door [[wagon]]<br />4-door [[van]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|110|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (SWB)<br />{{convert|125|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (LWB)<br />{{convert|146|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (EWB)\n| length = {{convert|178.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (SWB)<br />{{convert|202.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (LWB)<br />{{convert|223.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (EWB)\n| width = {{convert|79.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|79.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (SWB)<br />{{convert|79.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (LWB)<br />{{convert|79.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (SWB)<br />{{convert|81.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (LWB)\n| engine = [[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#250|4.1L]] [[Straight-6|I6]]<br />[[General Motors 90\u00b0 V6 engine#LB1 and LB4|4.3L]] [[V6]]<br />[[Chevrolet small-block engine#307|5.0L]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br />[[Chevrolet small-block engine#350|5.7L]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br />[[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#L29|7.4L]] V8<br />[[Detroit Diesel V8 engine#6.2 L|6.2L diesel V8]] (1982\u201393)<br />[[Detroit Diesel V8 engine#6.5 L|6.5L diesel V8]] (1994\u201395)\n| layout = [[Car layout#Front-engine, rear-wheel_drive|Front-engine, rear-wheel drive]] / [[four-wheel drive]]\n| transmission = 3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />4-speed automatic<br />3-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]<br />4-speed manual\n| assembly = [[Lordstown, Ohio]], United States<br />[[Flint, Michigan]], United States<br />[[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]], [[Ontario]], Canada\n| related = [[Chevrolet C/K|Chevrolet/GMC C/K]]\n}}\n[[File:GMC Vandura Campwagon.jpg|thumb|left|GMC Vandura Campwagon]]\n[[File:Chevrolet Conversion Van (Auto classique Laval '11).JPG|thumb|left|Chevrolet Conversion Van]]\nIn 1971, Chevy Van received a major redesign, moving the engine forward of the driver with a short front clip and hood. Its UK-built counterpart, the [[Bedford CF]] (introduced in 1970), had a similar design and look, but with different specifications. The van was constructed of a solid frame and thicker floor pan steel. GM also employed stronger truck style hubs and brakes with dual A-arm independent front suspension. The major restyle followed the engine-forward design of the competing 1968 [[Ford E series|Ford Econoline]]. Suspension and steering parts came from the [[Chevrolet C/K]]. GMC now marketed their vans under the VanDura name, while the Chevrolet equivalent vans were now given a \"G\" designation (G10, G20, and G30).\n\nFor the 1996 model year, the Chevrolet and GMC vans were replaced with the next-generation [[Chevrolet Express]] and GMC Savana with more aerodynamic styling. These vans were built on a stronger truck frame versus the previous generation's unibody construction. A left-side door was made available for the passenger van market.\n\n=== Engines ===\nThe third generation GM van was fitted with a variety of engines over its lifetime. A 4.1L (250 CID) straight six was the base engine, this was replaced by the 4.3L V6 in 1985. The 4.3L initially used a four-barrel carburetor; this was updated to TBI fuel injection in 1987. 5.0L and 5.7L small block V8s were the mainstay engines, these were also updated to fuel injection in 1987. A 7.4-liter V8 ({{Convert|230-255|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|385|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3600 rpm) was added in 1990, exclusive to the G30. The transmission choices were a three-speed manual, three-speed automatic, four-speed manual, or 4-speed automatic, depending on the model year. Chevrolet also offered, in 1982\u20131995, the [[Detroit Diesel V8 engine]].\n\n=== Updates ===\n==== 1971 ====\nAll new bodystyle was introduced this year, which continued until the end of the 1995 model year. The Vandura and sister Chevy Van replaced the earlier flat front end model. The GMCs were introduced in April 1970; interior components such as the steering column and steering wheel were sourced from the [[Chevrolet C/K]] pickups. The short wheelbase vans measured {{convert|110|in|mm|0}}, while the long wheelbase was {{convert|125|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase. Clear blinker housings were used on early models, along with blue grille ornaments Chevrolet models.\n\n==== 1973 ====\nFor 1973, the dashboard was redesigned, steering wheel and side fender badges became similar to that used on the new for 1973 pickups and the Chevrolet bowtie grille emblem was changed from blue to yellow. In these 73-77 Chevy Van years you could order a custom van of your dreams, complete with shag carpet and side pipe exhaust from the comfort of the Chevrolet dealership, through a company called \"Van-Tastic\" owned by Hop Cap Inc. in Bremen, Indiana. During the same period, GMC offered cutaway versions called the MagnaVan, while Chevrolet offered a similar version called the \"Hi-Cube Van.\" In 1975 the Chevy G20 series had a Surveyor line of class B motorhomes offered by Futura. The Surveyor came equipped with a bathroom, refrigerator, stove/oven, hot/cold sink and sleeping for four. The Surveyor is almost identical to the Open Road line of class B coaches offered by Chevrolet but the production numbers are significantly fewer.\n\n==== 1978 ====\n[[File:78-82 Chevrolet Van.jpg|thumb|left|1980\u20131982 Chevrolet Van]]\nThe front sheet metal was updated. Changes include a new, built-out plastic grille with integrated blinkers (grille assembly sourced from the C/K truck), different fenders, round headlamps on lower-end models and square headlamps on higher-end models. The dashboard was redesigned and would remain mostly unchanged until the end of production in 1995. Front and rear bumpers were enlarged. Chrome grille required square headlamps.\n\n1979 <ref>CGL1590XXXXXX</ref>\nThere is a Concept Pre-production Built in 1979 Model G 10 Chevrolet Panel Van Veh. WT. 01800 Reg. Gross WT. 02500\n\n==== 1980-1983 ====\nAll 1980 vans were given new rear-view mirrors on the driver and passenger doors. Some models got electronic spark control.\n[[File:Chevrolet Sportvan Beauville.jpg|thumb|left|1981 Chevrolet Sportvan Beauville]]\nChevrolet offers Bonaventure trim for 1981 and 82 with chrome bumpers, chrome side marker lights and trim around the tail lamps. Also, the only G-series vans that had chrome grille and round headlamps from the factory. Any other G van with a chrome grille from 1978-1982 required the rectangular headlamp option. For 1982, the locking steering column was introduced; the ignition switch, dimmer switch and wiper switch were relocated to the steering column.\n\nAfter 1982, 3-speed manuals would be relocated to the floor and base models will no longer have round headlamps, which would make Manual Transmission 1982 G vans rare and collectable as 1982 was the only model year with column shift manual transmission and ignition switch on the steering column. Also, 1982 was the only year with the left rear glass as an option on one side only.\n[[File:Long Beach Comic Expo 2012 - A-Team van (7186650356).jpg|thumb|Custom 1983 [[The A-Team|A-Team]] van]]\nThe 6.2-litre Diesel was first available and four headlamps, stacked in pairs, were introduced, along with a revised grille. Base models continued with two headlamps. All van models now had rectangular headlamps. From this model year on, tilt steering was available with a manual transmission, because the steering column was retilted to be similar to the C/K trucks and all manual transmission levers wee now on the floor. New steering wheels were introduced as well to be similar to the Monte Carlo/Malibu. Automatic overdrive was introduced. 4-speed manual 117M transmission was introduced. This version was made famous by the American television series ''[[The A-Team]]''.\n\n==== 1984-1989 ====\nNew swing-out side doors were introduced to go with the standard sliding side door. The doors were a 60/40 split. It was the final year for chrome trim side marker lamps and chrome trim around tail lamps options. For 1985, the taillight and side marker lenses were redesigned. New grille treatment similar to the pickups. Front doors were redesigned with raised body line. For 1986 and 1987, most engines were fuel-injected and a 4.3-liter [[V6]] replaced the old 4.1-liter [[Straight-6|inline six]] 115&nbsp;hp. A 6.2-litre Diesel engine was available in 165&nbsp;hp. A carbureted 5.7-liter 152&nbsp;hp [[V8 engine]] (option LE9) was also available in the 49-state version, with fuel injection for California-emission vehicles only. In 1989, a TBI 454 C.I. G30 was introduced.\n\n==== 1990 ====\nUnlike the [[Dodge Ram Wagon]] and [[Ford Econoline]] vans, which had a welded-on body extension, a {{convert|146|in|mm|0|adj=on}} extended wheelbase<ref>{{Cite web|title=1990 Chevy Van/Vandura|url=https://www.gmheritagecenter.com/docs/gm-heritage-archive/vehicle-information-kits/G-Van/1990-Chevrolet-G-Van.pdf|website=www.gmheritagecenter.com|publisher=GM Heritage Center|access-date=26 November 2014}}</ref> was introduced (about the same length as a Chevrolet/GMC crew cab truck). This was done to accommodate an extra bench seat, finally giving GM a 15-passenger van. GM was the last American automaker to produce such a van, with Dodge introducing the genre in 1971 and Ford joining them in 1978.\n\n==== 1992-1995 ====\n[[File:GMC-Vandura-Rally.jpg|thumb|right|GMC Vandura Rally]]\nIn 1992, there was a facelift using the front grille from the former Chevrolet/GMC R/V-series pickups and [[SUV]]s ([[Chevrolet K5 Blazer|Blazer]], [[Chevrolet Suburban|Suburban]], Crew Cab/Dually), previously phased out of production in 1991.\nG30 models getting the 4L80E transmission as standard. The 4L80E/4L60E [[automatic transmission]] was introduced, replacing the TH400/TH700R4. Brake-shift interlock became a standard, new-for-1993 feature, which required the brake pedal to be depressed in order to shift from park. A 4-wheel antilock brake system was also a standard, new-for-1993 feature. For 1994, a driver's side airbag and center high mount stop lamp were made standard, as well as CFC-free refrigerant in models equipped with air conditioning. For 1995, a new longer nose and four-headlamp design was introduced (similar to the C/K of the same era), which became a very popular school bus conversion. The engine was also revised, with the 4.3L V6, now labeled the \"Vortec\". Engine sizes remained about the same (4.3L, 5.7L, 7.4L, and a 6.5L normally-aspirated Diesel). Several versions of the van were available for purchase depending on the buyer's needs. The base trim was essentially a stripped down model, with no frills, a very limited interior, and no rear seats. The \"Sportvan\" had all the features of a full conversion van, but lacked rear seats and a fiberglass roof extension. Finally, the \"Conversion\" models were sent from the factory bare-bones, to have the interior and exterior upgrades added by third-party companies such as \"Mark III, Tiara, Coach, Starcraft, etc.\"\n\n==Concept vehicles==\nIn 1966, General Motors developed the [[concept vehicle]] Electrovan, based on the GMC Handi-Van.  The vehicle used a [[Union Carbide]] cryogenic [[fuel cell]] to power a 115-horsepower electric motor.

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 U.S. Census]], the city had a population of 45,362. It is the center of the [[Guayama metropolitan area]], which was home to 84,214 in 2010.\n\n== History ==\nDuring the early years of the Spanish colonization, the region known today as Guayama was inhabited by [[Ta\u00edno]] Indians. The indigenous population in this area decreased due to slavery and migration to the Lesser Antilles. The following centuries, the region was under attack from the [[Ta\u00edno rebellion]], [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] and pirates. The town was founded on January 29, 1736 as San Antonio de Padua de Guayama by then Spanish Governor [[Mat\u00edas de Abad\u00eda]], although there is knowledge of it being populated by native Indians as early as 1567. Guayama took its name from an Indian leader, or [[cacique]] who governed the Southeastern region of the Island, the Guaman\u00ed cacique and the Guayama cacique. The meaning of the Indian name is \"Great Place\" (in Spanish ''Sitio Grande''). It was Governor Don Tom\u00e1s de Abad\u00eda who officially declared Guayama a \"pueblo\" (town) with the name of ''San Antonio de Padua de Guayama''. That same year the Catholic Church in town, San Antonio de Padua, was declared a Parish. In 1776, Guayama had 200 houses, the church and a central plaza and the total population was approximately 5,000 villagers. Construction on Guayama's Parroquial church of San Antonio de Padua began in 1827 and was completed 40 years later. In 1828 the construction of the King's House (Casa del Rey) was completed and the church was rebuilt as well. Earlier that year, Guayama was hit by a terrible fire that destroyed 57 houses and 9 huts. Guayama territorial order was altered at different times through the years. Some of the most populated neighborhoods were segregated to form new towns. Patillas was established in 1811 as an independent municipality. In 1831, the territory comprised the neighborhoods: Algarrobos, Ancones, [[Arroyo, Puerto Rico|Arroyo]], Carreras, Guayama Pueblo, Guaman\u00ed, Jobos, Machete, and Yaurel. Later, Arroyo was divided into Arroyo Este and Arroyo Oeste and neighborhoods emerged: Pozo Hondo, Palmas de Aguamanil, Caimital, Pitajayas, Cuatro Calles, Sabana Eneas, Palmas, and [[Salinas, Puerto Rico|Salinas]]. The latter had been segregated from [[Coamo]].\n\nIn 1855, Arroyo was separated to become an independent municipality, taking the neighborhoods: Ancones, Arroyo, Yaurel, Pitajaya, and Cuatro Calles. By 1878, Guayama was a department head including: [[Comer\u00edo]] (then Sabana del Palmar), [[Cidra]], [[Cayey, Puerto Rico|Cayey]], Salinas, Arroyo, [[San Lorenzo, Puerto Rico|San Lorenzo]] (then called Hato Grande), [[Aguas Buenas]], [[Caguas]], [[Gurabo, Puerto Rico|Gurabo]], and [[Juncos]]. The development continued with the construction of the town cemetery in 1844, the slaughterhouse and meat market in 1851, and a wooden theater of two levels in 1878. By then Guayama had fourteen sugar plantations operating with steam engines and three with ox mills. Also practiced in this municipality was the exploitation of lead mines by the company \"La Estrella\", owned by Miguel Planellas, as well as the mineral galena, by the company \"La Rosita\", owned by Antonio Aponte. In 1881, Guayama is declared a Villa (First Order Municipality).\n\n[[File:Hacienda Azucarera Vives, Barrio Machete (Guayama County, Puerto Rico).jpg|thumb|200px|left|Hacienda Azucarera Vives, Barrio Machete]]\nDuring the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], American forces under General [[Nelson A. Miles]] landed at [[Gu\u00e1nica]] near [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]] on July 25, 1898. The landing surprised the United States War Department no less than the Spanish, as Miles had been instructed to land near [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] (the War Department learned of the landing through an Associate Press release.) However, en route to Puerto Rico Miles concluded that a San Juan landing was vulnerable to attack by small boats, and so changed plans.  Ponce, said at the time to be the largest city in Puerto Rico, was connected with San Juan by a 70-mile military road, well defended by the Spanish at Coamo and Aibonito. In order to flank this position, American Major General [[John R. Brooke]] landed at Arroyo, just east of Guayama, intending to move on [[Cayey, Puerto Rico|Cayey]], which is northwest of Guayama, along the road from Ponce to San Juan. General Brooke occupied Guayama August 5, 1898, after slight opposition, in the [[Battle of Guayama]]. On August 9, the [[Battle of Guaman\u00ed]] took place north of Guayama.  A more significant battle, the [[Battle of Aibonito Pass]], was halted on the morning of August 13 upon notification of the armistice between the United States and Spain.\n\nWhen after the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)]], the U.S. conducted its first census of Puerto Rico, the population of Guayama was 12,749.<ref name=\"OfficeSanger1900\">{{cite book|author1=Joseph Prentiss Sanger|author2=Henry Gannett|author3=Walter Francis Willcox|title=Informe sobre el censo de Puerto Rico, 1899, United States.

The Bernardini Theater built by engineer Manuel Texidor y Alcal\u00e1 del Olmo opened in 1913. The venue, property of attorney Thomas Bernardini, was the scene for artists of international fame. By that time, Guayama was considered one of the most important cities on the island's social scene.\n\n[[File:Front view of the Guayama Convention Center.jpg|thumb|320px|right|Guayama Convention Center]]\nIn the early twentieth century, there were selected societies such as the 'Coliseo Derkes' and 'Grupo Primavera', which endowed performing arts as well as scientific events. By the mid-twentieth century, Guayama achieved great industrial development, especially with the establishment of Univis Optical Corp., Angela Manufacturing Company and a petrochemical complex of the [[Phillips Petroleum Company]]. In 1968, the company started production of paraffin, benzene, synthetic fibers, nylon, plastic anhydrous, a million gallons of gasoline a day, and many other products. During that same decade agriculture began to decline as a result of [[land loss]], industrialization and the construction of multiple housing developments. The [[urban growth]] affected the [[sugar cane industry]]. However, in 1974, 155,595 tons of sugar cane was harvested in the Municipality producing 12,655 tons of refined sugar.\n\nIn November 2002, AES Puerto Rico opened its [[coal power plant]] in Guayama.

Guayama's municipal territory reaches the central mountain range to the north and the Caribbean Sea to the south. The mountain systems Sierra de Jajome (2,395 feet or 730 meters) and Sierra de Cayey cover some of the municipality area. The highest points are the Cerro de la Tabla (2,834 feet or 863 meters) and Cerro Tumbado (2,450 feet or 746 meters), which are part of the Sierra de Cayey mountain system. Other elevations are the mountains Garau, Charcas and Pe\u00f1a Hendida. Parts of the Guavate-Carite Forest and the [[Aguirre State Forest]] are in Guayama. The Guavate-Carite Forest, a 6,000-acre nature reserve is inhabited by 50 species of birds, making this spot a recognized area for birding and has a reserve with a [[dwarf forest]] that was produced by the region's high humidity and moist soil. The Aguirre Forest includes: mangroves, tidal flats, bird rookeries, research lakes & large manatee population. The Jobos Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve was established in 1987. The reserve is located between the coasts of Salinas and Guayama, approximately 2,883 acres of mangrove forest and freshwater wetlands. The two main components: Mar Negro mangrove forest, which consists of a mangrove forest and a complex system of lagoons and channels interspersed with salt and mud flats; and Cayos Caribe Islets, which are surrounded by coral reefs and seagrass beds, with small beach deposits and upland areas.\n\n===Hurricane Maria===\n[[Hurricane Maria]] on September 20, 2017 triggered numerous landslides in Guayama with the significant amount of rainfall.<ref name=\"USGS_Maria_Landslides\">{{cite web|url=https://www.usgs.gov/natural-hazards/landslide-hazards/science/preliminary-locations-landslide-impacts-hurricane-maria|title=Preliminary Locations of Landslide Impacts from Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico|last=|first=|date=October 27, 2017|website=USGS Landslide Hazards Program|publisher=USGS|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 17, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"USGS_Maria_Landslides map\">{{cite web|url=https://landslides.usgs.gov/research/featured/2017/maria-pr/images/PR_Maria_LS_density_map.pdf|title=Preliminary Locations of Landslide Impacts from Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico|last=|first=|date=|website=USGS Landslide Hazards Program|publisher=USGS|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190303143147/https://landslides.usgs.gov/research/featured/2017/maria-pr/images/PR_Maria_LS_density_map.pdf|archive-date=2019-03-03|access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref> After Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, the people of Guayama had to resort to collecting spring water.<ref name=\"Baez_Reuters\">{{cite news |last1=Baez |first1=Alvin |title=The search for water in Puerto Rico |url=https://www.reuters.com/news/picture/the-search-for-water-in-puerto-rico-idUSRTS1H0TR |accessdate=15 January 2019 |work=Reuters |date=October 18, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190115234453/https://www.reuters.com/news/picture/the-search-for-water-in-puerto-rico-idUSRTS1H0TR |archive-date=15 January 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Features===\n* Islands include Cayo Caribes, Isla Morrillito and Mata Redonda.\n* Carite Dam\n* Gorges; Barros, Brander\u00ed, Cimarrona, Coraz\u00f3n, Culebra, Palmas Bajas, and Salada.\n* Lakes: Melania Lake, [[Carite Lake]]\n* Las Mareas Lagoon\n* Rivers: [[R\u00edo Chiquito (Guayama, Puerto Rico)|R\u00edo Chiquito]], [[R\u00edo Guaman\u00ed]], [[Rio de la Plata (Puerto Rico)|R\u00edo de la Plata]] and [[Seco River, Puerto Rico|R\u00edo Seco]].\n\n===Climate===\nThe annual precipitation is approximately 52&nbsp;inches and the average temperature is 81&nbsp;\u00b0F.\n\n===Barrios===\n[[File:Guayama, Puerto Rico locator map.png|thumb|Subdivisions of Guayama.]]\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Guayama is subdivided into [[Barrios of Puerto Rico|barrios]].

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 U.S. Census]], the city had a population of 45,362. It is the center of the [[Guayama metropolitan area]], which was home to 84,214 in 2010.\n\n== History ==\nDuring the early years of the Spanish colonization, the region known today as Guayama was inhabited by [[Ta\u00edno]] Indians. The indigenous population in this area decreased due to slavery and migration to the Lesser Antilles. The following centuries, the region was under attack from the [[Ta\u00edno rebellion]], [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] and pirates. The town was founded on January 29, 1736 as San Antonio de Padua de Guayama by then Spanish Governor [[Mat\u00edas de Abad\u00eda]], although there is knowledge of it being populated by native Indians as early as 1567. Guayama took its name from an Indian leader, or [[cacique]] who governed the Southeastern region of the Island, the Guaman\u00ed cacique and the Guayama cacique. The meaning of the Indian name is \"Great Place\" (in Spanish ''Sitio Grande''). It was Governor Don Tom\u00e1s de Abad\u00eda who officially declared Guayama a \"pueblo\" (town) with the name of ''San Antonio de Padua de Guayama''. That same year the Catholic Church in town, San Antonio de Padua, was declared a Parish. In 1776, Guayama had 200 houses, the church and a central plaza and the total population was approximately 5,000 villagers. Construction on Guayama's Parroquial church of San Antonio de Padua began in 1827 and was completed 40 years later. In 1828 the construction of the King's House (Casa del Rey) was completed and the church was rebuilt as well. Earlier that year, Guayama was hit by a terrible fire that destroyed 57 houses and 9 huts. Guayama territorial order was altered at different times through the years. Some of the most populated neighborhoods were segregated to form new towns. Patillas was established in 1811 as an independent municipality. In 1831, the territory comprised the neighborhoods: Algarrobos, Ancones, [[Arroyo, Puerto Rico|Arroyo]], Carreras, Guayama Pueblo, Guaman\u00ed, Jobos, Machete, and Yaurel. Later, Arroyo was divided into Arroyo Este and Arroyo Oeste and neighborhoods emerged: Pozo Hondo, Palmas de Aguamanil, Caimital, Pitajayas, Cuatro Calles, Sabana Eneas, Palmas, and [[Salinas, Puerto Rico|Salinas]]. The latter had been segregated from [[Coamo]].\n\nIn 1855, Arroyo was separated to become an independent municipality, taking the neighborhoods: Ancones, Arroyo, Yaurel, Pitajaya, and Cuatro Calles. By 1878, Guayama was a department head including: [[Comer\u00edo]] (then Sabana del Palmar), [[Cidra]], [[Cayey, Puerto Rico|Cayey]], Salinas, Arroyo, [[San Lorenzo, Puerto Rico|San Lorenzo]] (then called Hato Grande), [[Aguas Buenas]], [[Caguas]], [[Gurabo, Puerto Rico|Gurabo]], and [[Juncos]]. The development continued with the construction of the town cemetery in 1844, the slaughterhouse and meat market in 1851, and a wooden theater of two levels in 1878. By then Guayama had fourteen sugar plantations operating with steam engines and three with ox mills. Also practiced in this municipality was the exploitation of lead mines by the company \"La Estrella\", owned by Miguel Planellas, as well as the mineral galena, by the company \"La Rosita\", owned by Antonio Aponte. In 1881, Guayama is declared a Villa (First Order Municipality).\n\n[[File:Hacienda Azucarera Vives, Barrio Machete (Guayama County, Puerto Rico).jpg|thumb|200px|left|Hacienda Azucarera Vives, Barrio Machete]]\nDuring the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], American forces under General [[Nelson A. Miles]] landed at [[Gu\u00e1nica]] near [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]] on July 25, 1898. The landing surprised the United States War Department no less than the Spanish, as Miles had been instructed to land near [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] (the War Department learned of the landing through an Associate Press release.) However, en route to Puerto Rico Miles concluded that a San Juan landing was vulnerable to attack by small boats, and so changed plans.  Ponce, said at the time to be the largest city in Puerto Rico, was connected with San Juan by a 70-mile military road, well defended by the Spanish at Coamo and Aibonito. In order to flank this position, American Major General [[John R. Brooke]] landed at Arroyo, just east of Guayama, intending to move on [[Cayey, Puerto Rico|Cayey]], which is northwest of Guayama, along the road from Ponce to San Juan. General Brooke occupied Guayama August 5, 1898, after slight opposition, in the [[Battle of Guayama]]. On August 9, the [[Battle of Guaman\u00ed]] took place north of Guayama.  A more significant battle, the [[Battle of Aibonito Pass]], was halted on the morning of August 13 upon notification of the armistice between the United States and Spain.\n\nWhen after the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)]], the U.S. conducted its first census of Puerto Rico, the population of Guayama was 12,749.<ref name=\"OfficeSanger1900\">{{cite book|author1=Joseph Prentiss Sanger|author2=Henry Gannett|author3=Walter Francis Willcox|title=Informe sobre el censo de Puerto Rico, 1899, United States.

The Bernardini Theater built by engineer Manuel Texidor y Alcal\u00e1 del Olmo opened in 1913. The venue, property of attorney Thomas Bernardini, was the scene for artists of international fame. By that time, Guayama was considered one of the most important cities on the island's social scene.\n\n[[File:Front view of the Guayama Convention Center.jpg|thumb|320px|right|Guayama Convention Center]]\nIn the early twentieth century, there were selected societies such as the 'Coliseo Derkes' and 'Grupo Primavera', which endowed performing arts as well as scientific events. By the mid-twentieth century, Guayama achieved great industrial development, especially with the establishment of Univis Optical Corp., Angela Manufacturing Company and a petrochemical complex of the [[Phillips Petroleum Company]]. In 1968, the company started production of paraffin, benzene, synthetic fibers, nylon, plastic anhydrous, a million gallons of gasoline a day, and many other products. During that same decade agriculture began to decline as a result of [[land loss]], industrialization and the construction of multiple housing developments. The [[urban growth]] affected the [[sugar cane industry]]. However, in 1974, 155,595 tons of sugar cane was harvested in the Municipality producing 12,655 tons of refined sugar.\n\nIn November 2002, AES Puerto Rico opened its [[coal power plant]] in Guayama. The company transmits and distributes electricity through a 25-year contract with the [[Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority]]. The 2012 National [[Puerto Rican Day Parade]] was dedicated to the Municipality of Guayama and its people.\n\n== Geography ==\nGuayama is located at {{Coord|17.974241|-66.110034|type:city_region:US-PR|format=dms|display=inline}}.<ref name=\"GR1\" /><ref name=\"PR_Ency\">{{cite web|url=https://enciclopediapr.org/en/encyclopedia/guayama-municipality/|title=Guayama Municipality|last=|first=|date=|website=Enciclopedia de Puerto Rico|publisher=Fundaci\u00f3n Puertorrique\u00f1a de las Humanidades (FPH)|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501062510/https://enciclopediapr.org/en/encyclopedia/guayama-municipality/|archive-date=2019-05-01|access-date=2019-03-20}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cordillera Central, Guayama, Puerto Rico.jpg|thumb|View of Guayama looking towards the \"Cordillera Central\" and Bosque de Carite.]]\nThe Municipality of Guayama is located on the Southern Coastal Valley region, bordering the Caribbean Sea, south of Cayey; east of Salinas; and west of Patillas and Arroyo. Guayama's municipal territory reaches the central mountain range to the north and the Caribbean Sea to the south. The mountain systems Sierra de Jajome (2,395 feet or 730 meters) and Sierra de Cayey cover some of the municipality area. The highest points are the Cerro de la Tabla (2,834 feet or 863 meters) and Cerro Tumbado (2,450 feet or 746 meters), which are part of the Sierra de Cayey mountain system. Other elevations are the mountains Garau, Charcas and Pe\u00f1a Hendida. Parts of the Guavate-Carite Forest and the [[Aguirre State Forest]] are in Guayama. The Guavate-Carite Forest, a 6,000-acre nature reserve is inhabited by 50 species of birds, making this spot a recognized area for birding and has a reserve with a [[dwarf forest]] that was produced by the region's high humidity and moist soil. The Aguirre Forest includes: mangroves, tidal flats, bird rookeries, research lakes & large manatee population. The Jobos Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve was established in 1987. The reserve is located between the coasts of Salinas and Guayama, approximately 2,883 acres of mangrove forest and freshwater wetlands. The two main components: Mar Negro mangrove forest, which consists of a mangrove forest and a complex system of lagoons and channels interspersed with salt and mud flats; and Cayos Caribe Islets, which are surrounded by coral reefs and seagrass beds, with small beach deposits and upland areas.\n\n===Hurricane Maria===\n[[Hurricane Maria]] on September 20, 2017 triggered numerous landslides in Guayama with the significant amount of rainfall.<ref name=\"USGS_Maria_Landslides\">{{cite web|url=https://www.usgs.gov/natural-hazards/landslide-hazards/science/preliminary-locations-landslide-impacts-hurricane-maria|title=Preliminary Locations of Landslide Impacts from Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico|last=|first=|date=October 27, 2017|website=USGS Landslide Hazards Program|publisher=USGS|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 17, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"USGS_Maria_Landslides map\">{{cite web|url=https://landslides.usgs.gov/research/featured/2017/maria-pr/images/PR_Maria_LS_density_map.pdf|title=Preliminary Locations of Landslide Impacts from Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico|last=|first=|date=|website=USGS Landslide Hazards Program|publisher=USGS|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190303143147/https://landslides.usgs.gov/research/featured/2017/maria-pr/images/PR_Maria_LS_density_map.pdf|archive-date=2019-03-03|access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref> After Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, the people of Guayama had to resort to collecting spring water.<ref name=\"Baez_Reuters\">{{cite news |last1=Baez |first1=Alvin |title=The search for water in Puerto Rico |url=https://www.reuters.com/news/picture/the-search-for-water-in-puerto-rico-idUSRTS1H0TR |accessdate=15 January 2019 |work=Reuters |date=October 18, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190115234453/https://www.reuters.com/news/picture/the-search-for-water-in-puerto-rico-idUSRTS1H0TR |archive-date=15 January 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Features===\n* Islands include Cayo Caribes, Isla Morrillito and Mata Redonda.\n* Carite Dam\n* Gorges; Barros, Brander\u00ed, Cimarrona, Coraz\u00f3n, Culebra, Palmas Bajas, and Salada.\n* Lakes: Melania Lake, [[Carite Lake]]\n* Las Mareas Lagoon\n* Rivers: [[R\u00edo Chiquito (Guayama, Puerto Rico)|R\u00edo Chiquito]], [[R\u00edo Guaman\u00ed]], [[Rio de la Plata (Puerto Rico)|R\u00edo de la Plata]] and [[Seco River, Puerto Rico|R\u00edo Seco]].\n\n===Climate===\nThe annual precipitation is approximately 52&nbsp;inches and the average temperature is 81&nbsp;\u00b0F.\n\n===Barrios===\n[[File:Guayama, Puerto Rico locator map.png|thumb|Subdivisions of Guayama.]]\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Guayama is subdivided into [[Barrios of Puerto Rico|barrios]].

This [[American Revolutionary War]] skirmish involved a small colonial militia force (state militia and some [[Continental Army]] soldiers), led by, among others, General [[David Wooster]], who died in the engagement, and [[Benedict Arnold]],<ref>See [http://jackfsanders.tripod.com/arnold.htm Benedict Arnold, a Ridgefield hero] for more on his local exploits</ref> whose horse was shot from under him. They faced a larger British force that had landed at Westport and was returning from a raid on the colonial supply depot in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]]. The battle was a tactical victory for the British but a strategic one for the Colonials because the British would never again conduct inland operations in Connecticut, despite western Connecticut's strategic importance in securing the [[Hudson River Valley]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Jones|first=Keith M|title=The Battle of Ridgefield|publisher=Town of Ridgefield, Connecticut|url=http://www.ridgefieldct.org/content/42/249/1077.aspx|accessdate=2011-12-25|ref=Jones|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725192648/http://www.ridgefieldct.org/content/42/249/1077.aspx|archivedate=2010-07-25}}</ref> Today, the dead from both sides are buried together in a small cemetery on Main Street on the right of the entrance to Casagmo condominiums: \"...foes in arms, brothers in death...\". The [[Keeler Tavern]], a local inn and museum, features a British cannonball still lodged in the side of the building. There are many other landmarks from the Revolutionary War in the town, with most along Main Street.\n\nIn the summer of 1781, the French army under the [[Comte de Rochambeau]] marched through Connecticut, encamping in the Ridgebury section of town, where the first [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] mass in Ridgefield was offered.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n[[File:RidgefieldCTMainSt1875.jpg|thumb|left|Main Street, looking south, 1875]]\n[[File:PostcardRidgefieldCTMainStFrBranchvilleRd1906.jpg|thumb|right|Main Street, looking south from Branchville Road, about 1906]]\n[[File:PostcardTheRidgefieldSchool,CT1909.jpg|thumb|right|The Ridgefield School (postcard sent in 1909)]]\n\nFor much of its three centuries, Ridgefield was a farming community.  Among the important families in the 19th century were the Rockwells and Lounsburys, which intermarried.  They produced two Connecticut governors, [[George Lounsbury]] and [[Phineas Lounsbury]]. The Ridgefield Veterans Memorial Community Center on Main Street, also called the Lounsbury House, was built by Gov. Phineas Chapman Lounsbury around 1896 as his primary residence. The Lounsbury Farm near the Florida section of Ridgefield is one of the only remaining operational farms in Ridgefield.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nIn the late 19th century, spurred by the new railroad connection to its lofty village and the fact that nearby countryside reaches {{convert|1000|ft|m}} above sea level, Ridgefield began to be discovered by wealthy New York City residents, who assembled large estates and built huge \"summer cottages\" throughout the higher sections of town. Among the more noteworthy estates were Col. Louis D. Conley's \"Outpost Farm\", which at one point totalled nearly {{convert|2000|acre|km2}}, some of which is now Bennett's Pond State Park; Seth Low Pierrepont's \"Twixthills\", more than {{convert|600|acre|km2}}, much of which is now [[Pierrepont State Park]]; Frederic E. Lewis's \"Upagenstit\", {{convert|100|acre|km2}} that became Grey Court College in the 1940s, but is now mostly subdivisions; and Col. Edward M. Knox's \"Downesbury Manor\", whose {{convert|300|acre|km2}} included a 45-room mansion that [[Mark Twain]] often visited.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThese and dozens of other estates became unaffordable and unwieldy during and after the [[Great Depression]], and most were broken up. Many mansions were razed. In their place came subdivisions of one- and {{convert|2|acre|m2|adj=on}} lots that turned the town into a suburban, bedroom community in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. However, strong planning and zoning has maintained much of the 19th- and early 20th-century charm of the town, especially along its famous mile-long Main Street.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nIn 1946, Ridgefield was one of the locations considered for the United Nations secretariat building,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jackfsanders.tripod.com/sunsethall.htm|title=Sunset Hall|website=jackfsanders.tripod.com|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref> but was not chosen due to its relative inaccessibility.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n==Geography==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|35.0|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|34.4|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|0.5|sqmi}}, or 1.52%, is water.  The town is bordered by the towns of [[North Salem, New York|North Salem]] and [[Lewisboro, New York|Lewisboro]] in [[Westchester County, New York]] to the west, [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] to the north, [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]] to the south and [[Redding, Connecticut|Redding]] to the east.\n\nThe town has a [[Metro-North Railroad]] station called [[Branchville (Metro-North station)|Branchville]] in the [[Branchville (Ridgefield)|Branchville]] corner of town. The census-designated place (CDP) corresponding to the [[Ridgefield (CDP), Connecticut|town center]] covers a total area of {{convert|6.4|sqmi}}, of which 0.16% is water. Other locales within the town include Titicus on Route 116 just north of the village; Ridgebury in the northern section of town; Scotland, which is south of Ridgebury; Farmingville, located northeast and east of the town center; Limestone, located northeast of the town center; Flat Rock, located south of the town center; and Florida, located just north of Branchville.\n\n=== Geology ===\nRidgefield consists of hilly, rocky terrain, ranging from {{convert|1060|ft|m}} above sea level (at [[Pine Mountain Reserve (Connecticut)|Pine Mountain]]) to {{convert|342|ft|m}} at [[Branchville (Ridgefield)|Branchville]]. Its average village elevation is {{convert|725|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref>http://www.maps-n-stats.com/us_ct/us_ct_ridgefield_i.html</ref> The landscape is strewn with countless rocks deposited by [[glacier]]s, and among the town's bodies of water is [[Round Pond (Connecticut)|Round Pond]], formed in a [[Kettle (landform)|kettle]] left by the last glacier 20,000 years ago. A particularly interesting feature is [[Cameron's Line]], named for Eugene N. Cameron, who discovered that rocks west of the line differed greatly from those east of it. This fault line was formed some 250 million years ago by the collision of \"Proto [[North America]]\" and \"Proto [[Africa]]\", and there are still occasional light earthquakes felt along its length. The line bisects the southern half of the town, running generally north of West Lane, across the north end of the village, past the south end of Great Swamp and generally easterly into Redding in the Topstone area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://3dparks.wr.usgs.gov/nyc/highlands/highlands.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 22, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722153634/http://3dparks.wr.usgs.gov/nyc/highlands/highlands.html |archivedate=July 22, 2011 }}</ref> North of Cameron's Line, the town is rich in [[limestone]].

This [[American Revolutionary War]] skirmish involved a small colonial militia force (state militia and some [[Continental Army]] soldiers), led by, among others, General [[David Wooster]], who died in the engagement, and [[Benedict Arnold]],<ref>See [http://jackfsanders.tripod.com/arnold.htm Benedict Arnold, a Ridgefield hero] for more on his local exploits</ref> whose horse was shot from under him. They faced a larger British force that had landed at Westport and was returning from a raid on the colonial supply depot in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]]. The battle was a tactical victory for the British but a strategic one for the Colonials because the British would never again conduct inland operations in Connecticut, despite western Connecticut's strategic importance in securing the [[Hudson River Valley]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Jones|first=Keith M|title=The Battle of Ridgefield|publisher=Town of Ridgefield, Connecticut|url=http://www.ridgefieldct.org/content/42/249/1077.aspx|accessdate=2011-12-25|ref=Jones|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725192648/http://www.ridgefieldct.org/content/42/249/1077.aspx|archivedate=2010-07-25}}</ref> Today, the dead from both sides are buried together in a small cemetery on Main Street on the right of the entrance to Casagmo condominiums: \"...foes in arms, brothers in death...\". The [[Keeler Tavern]], a local inn and museum, features a British cannonball still lodged in the side of the building. There are many other landmarks from the Revolutionary War in the town, with most along Main Street.\n\nIn the summer of 1781, the French army under the [[Comte de Rochambeau]] marched through Connecticut, encamping in the Ridgebury section of town, where the first [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] mass in Ridgefield was offered.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n[[File:RidgefieldCTMainSt1875.jpg|thumb|left|Main Street, looking south, 1875]]\n[[File:PostcardRidgefieldCTMainStFrBranchvilleRd1906.jpg|thumb|right|Main Street, looking south from Branchville Road, about 1906]]\n[[File:PostcardTheRidgefieldSchool,CT1909.jpg|thumb|right|The Ridgefield School (postcard sent in 1909)]]\n\nFor much of its three centuries, Ridgefield was a farming community.  Among the important families in the 19th century were the Rockwells and Lounsburys, which intermarried.  They produced two Connecticut governors, [[George Lounsbury]] and [[Phineas Lounsbury]]. The Ridgefield Veterans Memorial Community Center on Main Street, also called the Lounsbury House, was built by Gov. Phineas Chapman Lounsbury around 1896 as his primary residence. The Lounsbury Farm near the Florida section of Ridgefield is one of the only remaining operational farms in Ridgefield.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nIn the late 19th century, spurred by the new railroad connection to its lofty village and the fact that nearby countryside reaches {{convert|1000|ft|m}} above sea level, Ridgefield began to be discovered by wealthy New York City residents, who assembled large estates and built huge \"summer cottages\" throughout the higher sections of town. Among the more noteworthy estates were Col. Louis D. Conley's \"Outpost Farm\", which at one point totalled nearly {{convert|2000|acre|km2}}, some of which is now Bennett's Pond State Park; Seth Low Pierrepont's \"Twixthills\", more than {{convert|600|acre|km2}}, much of which is now [[Pierrepont State Park]]; Frederic E. Lewis's \"Upagenstit\", {{convert|100|acre|km2}} that became Grey Court College in the 1940s, but is now mostly subdivisions; and Col. Edward M. Knox's \"Downesbury Manor\", whose {{convert|300|acre|km2}} included a 45-room mansion that [[Mark Twain]] often visited.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThese and dozens of other estates became unaffordable and unwieldy during and after the [[Great Depression]], and most were broken up. Many mansions were razed. In their place came subdivisions of one- and {{convert|2|acre|m2|adj=on}} lots that turned the town into a suburban, bedroom community in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. However, strong planning and zoning has maintained much of the 19th- and early 20th-century charm of the town, especially along its famous mile-long Main Street.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nIn 1946, Ridgefield was one of the locations considered for the United Nations secretariat building,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jackfsanders.tripod.com/sunsethall.htm|title=Sunset Hall|website=jackfsanders.tripod.com|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref> but was not chosen due to its relative inaccessibility.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n==Geography==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|35.0|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|34.4|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|0.5|sqmi}}, or 1.52%, is water.  The town is bordered by the towns of [[North Salem, New York|North Salem]] and [[Lewisboro, New York|Lewisboro]] in [[Westchester County, New York]] to the west, [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] to the north, [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]] to the south and [[Redding, Connecticut|Redding]] to the east.\n\nThe town has a [[Metro-North Railroad]] station called [[Branchville (Metro-North station)|Branchville]] in the [[Branchville (Ridgefield)|Branchville]] corner of town. The census-designated place (CDP) corresponding to the [[Ridgefield (CDP), Connecticut|town center]] covers a total area of {{convert|6.4|sqmi}}, of which 0.16% is water. Other locales within the town include Titicus on Route 116 just north of the village; Ridgebury in the northern section of town; Scotland, which is south of Ridgebury; Farmingville, located northeast and east of the town center; Limestone, located northeast of the town center; Flat Rock, located south of the town center; and Florida, located just north of Branchville.\n\n=== Geology ===\nRidgefield consists of hilly, rocky terrain, ranging from {{convert|1060|ft|m}} above sea level (at [[Pine Mountain Reserve (Connecticut)|Pine Mountain]]) to {{convert|342|ft|m}} at [[Branchville (Ridgefield)|Branchville]]. Its average village elevation is {{convert|725|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref>http://www.maps-n-stats.com/us_ct/us_ct_ridgefield_i.html</ref> The landscape is strewn with countless rocks deposited by [[glacier]]s, and among the town's bodies of water is [[Round Pond (Connecticut)|Round Pond]], formed in a [[Kettle (landform)|kettle]] left by the last glacier 20,000 years ago. A particularly interesting feature is [[Cameron's Line]], named for Eugene N. Cameron, who discovered that rocks west of the line differed greatly from those east of it. This fault line was formed some 250 million years ago by the collision of \"Proto [[North America]]\" and \"Proto [[Africa]]\", and there are still occasional light earthquakes felt along its length. The line bisects the southern half of the town, running generally north of West Lane, across the north end of the village, past the south end of Great Swamp and generally easterly into Redding in the Topstone area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://3dparks.wr.usgs.gov/nyc/highlands/highlands.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 22, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722153634/http://3dparks.wr.usgs.gov/nyc/highlands/highlands.html |archivedate=July 22, 2011 }}</ref> North of Cameron's Line, the town is rich in [[limestone]].

Hamilton was told by the Chief Whip to stay neutral, but says he ignored this instruction. \"I naturally ignored this advice and fed all my intelligence into her campaign.\" He also said that he made the fateful suggestion that she interview each cabinet member individually, believing they would lack the resolve to tell her to her face that she must go. \"Unfortunately, I had miscalculated.\"<ref>Neil Hamilton in Iain Dale (ed) ''Memories of Margaret Thatcher: A Portrait, By Those Who Knew Her Best'' (Biteback Publishing, 2013) {{ISBN|184954607X}}</ref> Hamilton strongly encouraged Thatcher to persist.

He came under pressure to step down after the resignation of another minister, [[Tim Smith (British politician)|Tim Smith]], on 19 October 1994, after Smith had admitted to taking money in the cash-for-questions scandal.

His majority at the 1992 general election had been almost 16,000 votes. In 1997, Tatton was the fourth safest Conservative seat in Britain.

Bell defeated Hamilton, winning by a majority of over 11,000 votes with a swing of 48%.

It claimed the money was paid to the men by [[Mohamed Al-Fayed]], the owner of [[Harrods]]. In return, the men were to ask questions on behalf of Al-Fayed in the [[United Kingdom House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Smith admitted his guilt and resigned immediately. Hamilton claimed innocence but was forced to resign five days later, on 25 October 1994.\n\n====The action against ''The Guardian''====\nHamilton brought legal action for [[libel]] against ''The Guardian''. Hamilton joined [[Ian Greer (lobbyist)|Ian Greer]], a parliamentary lobbyist, as a co-plaintiff. In the process, the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] was amended by the [[Defamation Act 1996]] to allow statements made in Parliament to be questioned in court.<ref>Robert Shrimsley, \"Guardian Case MP seeks law change\", ''Financial Times'', 15 February 1996<br />{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/1468-2230.00087 | volume=60 | issue=3 | title='Only Flattery is Safe': Political Speech and the Defamation Act 1996 | year=1997 | journal=Modern Law Review | pages=388\u2013393 | last1 = Williams | first1 = Kevin}}</ref>\n\nOn 30 September 1996, the day before the start of the trial, Hamilton and Greer settled, citing a conflict of interest and lack of funds. ''The Guardian'' greeted the Hamilton collapse with the headline 'A Liar and a Cheat'. Alan Rusbridger, editor of ''The Guardian'', said, \"The decision by Neil Hamilton and Ian Greer must be one of the most astonishing legal cave-ins in the history of the law of libel\" and called for the issues to be examined by Sir Gordon Downey, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, and the Inland Revenue.<ref>David Hencke, David Leigh and David Pallister, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1996/oct/01/hamiltonvalfayed.davidhencke \"A Liar and a Cheat\"], ''The Guardian'', 1 October 1996.</ref>\nThey each paid \u00a37,500 towards the paper's legal costs.

Hamilton vowed that if the \"Downey report\" found against him, he would resign.\n\n[[Edwina Currie]], a former health minister, gave evidence. She told the inquiry that, in May 1988, Hamilton had been unmoved by a set of photographs that depicted smoking related cancers; that is, harm to young people which might be caused by a product (tobacco) that he promoted.<ref>''The Independent'', 5 July 1997.</ref> Hamilton argued the pictures were irrelevant.

Hamilton received over \u00a325,000 and had deliberately misled Michael Heseltine, then [[President of the Board of Trade]], in October 1994, when he said he had no financial relationship with Ian Greer. In a phone conversation, Hamilton gave an absolute assurance to Heseltine that there was no such relationship, but he had received two payments from Greer in 1988 and 1989, totalling \u00a310,000.<ref name=IndDM>Donald McIntyre, [https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/a-clear-response-to-the-cash-for-questions-mps-1248896.html \"A clear response to the cash for questions MPs\"], ''The Independent'', 4 July 1997.</ref> Hamilton had asked for payment in kind so the money would not be taxable. He also failed to register his stays at the [[H\u00f4tel Ritz Paris]] and at Al-Fayed's castle in Scotland in 1989.<ref>\"The sleaze report: Five men who fell below the standards that Parliament demands from an MP - Hamilton: cash and a stay at Ritz; Smith: accepted cash in return for lobbying; Grylls: Misled committee over dealings Bowden: Did not declare; Brown: Failed to register\", ''The Independent'', 4 July 1997.</ref>\n\nOn 3 July 1997, the enquiry found Hamilton guilty of taking \"cash for questions\". The Independent wrote, \"Sir Gordon, contrary to Hamilton's confident expectations, had no compunction about concluding that he did indeed take cash in brown envelopes\" and called on the new party leader to \"expel the miscreants\".<ref name=IndDM/> Hamilton, Smith (also found guilty), Brown and [[Michael Grylls]] were harshly criticised. If Hamilton and Smith had remained in parliament, Downey said he might have recommended long periods of suspension for both. Hamilton rejected these findings, whereas Smith, who had stood down, accepted them, apologised for his conduct, and retired from politics altogether.\n\n====The libel action against Al-Fayed====\nHamilton also brought a legal action for libel against Mohamed Al-Fayed. On 16 January 1997, Al-Fayed appeared in an edition of the ''[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]]'' documentary series on [[Channel 4]].<ref>[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmselect/cmstnprv/030ii/sp0157.htm \"Appendix 33 \u2013 continued: Appendix 1 Channel 4 and Fourth Estate Press Releases\"], Select Committee on Standards and Privileges First Report, House of Commons, January 1997.</ref> He claimed that Hamilton had demanded and had accepted cash payments of up to \u00a3110,000,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/573630.stm \"Hamilton loses libel case\"], ''BBC News'', 21 December 1999.</ref> Harrods' gift vouchers and a free holiday at the [[H\u00f4tel Ritz Paris]] in 1987, in return for asking questions in Parliament on behalf of Harrods. While Hamilton did not deny the holiday, he continued to maintain that he was innocent of improper conduct.\n\nOn 31 July 1998, Hamilton's action was approved for a court listing. Funds for the action were donated by [[Lord Harris of High Cross]], the [[Earl of Portsmouth]] and Taki, who raised \u00a350,000.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/576284.stm \"The odd couple behind the odd couple\"], ''BBC News'', 23 December 1999.</ref> Other contributors to the fund included [[Simon Heffer]], [[Norris McWhirter]], Peter Clarke, [[Lord Bell]], [[Gyles Brandreth]] and Gerald Howarth (Hamilton's co-plaintiff in the BBC action). Some Conservative MPs (approximately 40 of the 165) also made contributions. In total, approximately \u00a3410,000 was raised.<ref>''The Independent'', 23 December 1999.</ref>\n\nThe jury trial commenced in November 1999. Hamilton and his wife were cross-examined by [[George Carman]] QC. Carman put to Hamilton that he had acted corruptly to demand and then take \u00a310,000 from [[Mobil Oil]] in 1989 for the tabling of an amendment to a finance bill. At the time, Hamilton was a member of a Commons select committee on finance.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/575299.stm |work=BBC News | title=The undoing of Neil Hamilton | date=22 December 1999 | accessdate=26 March 2010}}</ref> Al-Fayed said Hamilton had taken the money either in brown envelope cash payments or through Ian Greer.

On 6 November, the committee only partially endorsed Downey's report, but still criticised Hamilton's behaviour whilst an MP.\n\nIn April 2001, Hamilton was refused leave to appeal to the [[House of Lords]]. On 22 May 2001, unable to pay his legal fees and with costs amounting to some \u00a33m, Hamilton declared bankruptcy. He was discharged from bankruptcy in May 2004.\n\n===False rape accusation===\nOn 10 August 2001, the Hamiltons were arrested by police who were investigating an alleged rape.

Commenting on Powell's [[Rivers of Blood speech|'Rivers of Blood' speech]] about mass immigration, Hamilton said that Powell was wrong about predicting racial violence, but had been \"proved right by events\" in terms of social change that was \"never desired by the majority of the British people\". Hamilton said that Powell \"changed politics by articulating the fears and resentments of millions and millions of people who are being ignored by the establishment\". In response, the leader of [[Plaid Cymru]], [[Leanne Wood]], accused Hamilton of \"keeping Powell's racist rhetoric going\". Labour AM [[Hefin David]] described Hamilton's comments as \"outrageous\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-43783172|title=UKIP Wales leader defends Enoch Powell|date=16 April 2018|work=BBC News|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Television personality==\nOn 9 May 1997 Hamilton and his wife, Christine, appeared on the current affairs satire quiz ''[[Have I Got News for You]]''. The episode was recorded one week after Hamilton lost his seat. [[Angus Deayton]], the presenter of the [[panel game]], wore a white suit instead of his usual brown one. This was a humorous reference to [[Martin Bell]], who wore just such a suit throughout the 1997 general election campaign. As a further taunt, at the end of the show, the Hamiltons were handed their \"fee\" in brown envelopes.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1485042.stm \"'Invincible' Christine at Neil's side\"], ''BBC News'', 10 August 2001.</ref> At one point Hamilton quipped, \"I've found it's much better making political jokes than being one.\"<ref>''Have I Got News for You'', season 13 episode 4.

In an appearance on a celebrity edition of ''[[Mastermind (TV series)|Mastermind]]'' on [[Boxing Day]] 2004, Hamilton described himself as being \"an object of professional curiosity\".

Hamilton said he supported the introduction of Skoal Bandits on [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] grounds, and lobbied ministers (including [[Edwina Currie]] and [[David Mellor]]) to allow its introduction.

Hamilton and some other Conservative ministers had also opposed the treaty. Despite this, Hamilton remained, for a time, loyal to the Major government which endorsed the treaty. Hamilton urged his colleagues not to resign over the Treaty and other issues.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nAfter Hamilton resigned as a minister in October 1994, he voted against Major in thr [[1995 Conservative Party leadership election]].

His majority at the 1992 general election had been almost 16,000 votes. In 1997, Tatton was the fourth safest Conservative seat in Britain. Hamilton was under investigation by the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner as part of the ''cash for questions'' enquiry and some party members thought he should stand down after the collapse of his case against ''The Guardian''.<ref>The 1997 General Election edited by D.

''The Observer'' commissioned ICM polls in the constituencies of the three Conservative candidates tainted by scandal and seeking re-election: Hamilton, [[Allan Stewart (politician)|Allan Stewart]] and [[Piers Merchant]]. Both Stewart and Merchant were found to have support consistent with their party's standing, but in Tatton \"there was massive hostility to Hamilton\".<ref>Bruce Page, ''The Murdoch Archipelago'', 2003, {{ISBN|9781849837798}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Martin Bell]], the BBC war correspondent, announced he would stand as an independent candidate in Tatton, the Labour and Liberal Democrat candidates for the area stood down in order to give Bell a clear run against Hamilton. Bell defeated Hamilton, winning by a majority of over 11,000 votes with a swing of 48%.

The Independent wrote, \"Sir Gordon, contrary to Hamilton's confident expectations, had no compunction about concluding that he did indeed take cash in brown envelopes\" and called on the new party leader to \"expel the miscreants\".<ref name=IndDM/> Hamilton, Smith (also found guilty), Brown and [[Michael Grylls]] were harshly criticised. If Hamilton and Smith had remained in parliament, Downey said he might have recommended long periods of suspension for both. Hamilton rejected these findings, whereas Smith, who had stood down, accepted them, apologised for his conduct, and retired from politics altogether.\n\n====The libel action against Al-Fayed====\nHamilton also brought a legal action for libel against Mohamed Al-Fayed. On 16 January 1997, Al-Fayed appeared in an edition of the ''[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]]'' documentary series on [[Channel 4]].<ref>[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmselect/cmstnprv/030ii/sp0157.htm \"Appendix 33 \u2013 continued: Appendix 1 Channel 4 and Fourth Estate Press Releases\"], Select Committee on Standards and Privileges First Report, House of Commons, January 1997.</ref> He claimed that Hamilton had demanded and had accepted cash payments of up to \u00a3110,000,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/573630.stm \"Hamilton loses libel case\"], ''BBC News'', 21 December 1999.</ref> Harrods' gift vouchers and a free holiday at the [[H\u00f4tel Ritz Paris]] in 1987, in return for asking questions in Parliament on behalf of Harrods. While Hamilton did not deny the holiday, he continued to maintain that he was innocent of improper conduct.\n\nOn 31 July 1998, Hamilton's action was approved for a court listing. Funds for the action were donated by [[Lord Harris of High Cross]], the [[Earl of Portsmouth]] and Taki, who raised \u00a350,000.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/576284.stm \"The odd couple behind the odd couple\"], ''BBC News'', 23 December 1999.</ref> Other contributors to the fund included [[Simon Heffer]], [[Norris McWhirter]], Peter Clarke, [[Lord Bell]], [[Gyles Brandreth]] and Gerald Howarth (Hamilton's co-plaintiff in the BBC action). Some Conservative MPs (approximately 40 of the 165) also made contributions. In total, approximately \u00a3410,000 was raised.<ref>''The Independent'', 23 December 1999.</ref>\n\nThe jury trial commenced in November 1999. Hamilton and his wife were cross-examined by [[George Carman]] QC. Carman put to Hamilton that he had acted corruptly to demand and then take \u00a310,000 from [[Mobil Oil]] in 1989 for the tabling of an amendment to a finance bill. At the time, Hamilton was a member of a Commons select committee on finance.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/575299.stm |work=BBC News | title=The undoing of Neil Hamilton | date=22 December 1999 | accessdate=26 March 2010}}</ref> Al-Fayed said Hamilton had taken the money either in brown envelope cash payments or through Ian Greer.

On 6 November, the committee only partially endorsed Downey's report, but still criticised Hamilton's behaviour whilst an MP.\n\nIn April 2001, Hamilton was refused leave to appeal to the [[House of Lords]]. On 22 May 2001, unable to pay his legal fees and with costs amounting to some \u00a33m, Hamilton declared bankruptcy. He was discharged from bankruptcy in May 2004.\n\n===False rape accusation===\nOn 10 August 2001, the Hamiltons were arrested by police who were investigating an alleged rape. The Hamiltons said they could not have been present at the alleged rape scene because they were hosting a dinner party and produced alibis including one from [[Derek Laud]].<ref>Tara Womersley and Peter Foster, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1337240/Dinner-guests-whose-testimony-will-count.html \"Dinner guests whose testimony will count\"], ''Daily Telegraph'', 13 August 2001.</ref> The investigation against the couple was dropped when it became apparent that the accusations were [[False accusation of rape|entirely false]].

Commenting on Powell's [[Rivers of Blood speech|'Rivers of Blood' speech]] about mass immigration, Hamilton said that Powell was wrong about predicting racial violence, but had been \"proved right by events\" in terms of social change that was \"never desired by the majority of the British people\". Hamilton said that Powell \"changed politics by articulating the fears and resentments of millions and millions of people who are being ignored by the establishment\". In response, the leader of [[Plaid Cymru]], [[Leanne Wood]], accused Hamilton of \"keeping Powell's racist rhetoric going\". Labour AM [[Hefin David]] described Hamilton's comments as \"outrageous\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-43783172|title=UKIP Wales leader defends Enoch Powell|date=16 April 2018|work=BBC News|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Television personality==\nOn 9 May 1997 Hamilton and his wife, Christine, appeared on the current affairs satire quiz ''[[Have I Got News for You]]''. The episode was recorded one week after Hamilton lost his seat. [[Angus Deayton]], the presenter of the [[panel game]], wore a white suit instead of his usual brown one. This was a humorous reference to [[Martin Bell]], who wore just such a suit throughout the 1997 general election campaign. As a further taunt, at the end of the show, the Hamiltons were handed their \"fee\" in brown envelopes.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1485042.stm \"'Invincible' Christine at Neil's side\"], ''BBC News'', 10 August 2001.</ref> At one point Hamilton quipped, \"I've found it's much better making political jokes than being one.\"<ref>''Have I Got News for You'', season 13 episode 4.

They have also appeared on programmes such as ''[[The Weakest Link]]'' and ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (UK game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'', as well as in [[pantomime]]. In an appearance on a celebrity edition of ''[[Mastermind (TV series)|Mastermind]]'' on [[Boxing Day]] 2004, Hamilton described himself as being \"an object of professional curiosity\".

Hamilton was a member of the \"[[No Turning Back (political group)|No Turning Back group]]\", a part of the Conservative Party calling for the privatisation of schools and the National Health Service, which he described as \"vast monoliths\".{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Parliamentary wit===\nIn November 1989, Hamilton won the ''[[The Spectator|Spectator]]'' parliamentary wit of the year award.
