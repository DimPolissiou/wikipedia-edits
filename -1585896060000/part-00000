Human V1 is located on the [[Anatomical terms of location#Left and right (lateral), and medial|medial]] side of the occipital lobe within the [[calcarine sulcus]]; the full extent of V1 often continues onto the [[cerebral hemisphere#Poles|occipital pole]]. V1 is often also called striate cortex because it can be identified by a large stripe of myelin, the [[Stria of Gennari]].  Visually driven regions outside V1 are called [[Extrastriate| extrastriate cortex]]. There are many extrastriate regions, and these are specialized for different visual tasks, such as visuospatial processing, color differentiation, and motion perception. The name derives from the overlying [[occipital bone]], which is named from the Latin '''ob''', ''behind'', and '''caput''', ''the head''. Bilateral lesions of the occipital lobe can lead to cortical blindness (See [[Anton's syndrome]]).\n\n==Structure==\n[[File:Gyri of lateral cortex.png|thumb|Diagram of gyri of brain viewed on lateral hemisphere. Occipital gyri shown lower right]]\n[[File:Occipital lobe animation small.gif|thumb|Animation. Occipital lobe (red) of left cerebral hemisphere.]]\nThe two occipital lobes are the smallest of four paired lobes in the [[human brain]]. Located in the rearmost portion of the [[skull]], the occipital lobes are part of the posterior [[cerebrum]]. The lobes of the brain are named from the overlying bone and the [[occipital bone]] overlies the occipital lobes.\n\nThe lobes rest on the [[tentorium cerebelli]], a process of [[dura mater]] that separates the cerebrum from the [[cerebellum]]. They are structurally isolated in their respective cerebral hemispheres by the separation of the [[cerebral fissure]]. At the front edge of the occipital lobe are several [[occipital gyri]], which are separated by [[lateral occipital sulcus]].\n\nThe occipital aspects along the inside face of each hemisphere are divided by the [[calcarine sulcus]]. Above the medial, Y-shaped sulcus lies the [[cuneus]], and the area below the sulcus is the [[lingual gyrus]].\n\nDamage to the primary visual areas of the occipital lobe can cause partial or complete blindness.<ref>Schacter, D. L., Gilbert, D. L. & Wegner, D. M. (2009). Psychology. (2nd ed.). New Work (NY): Worth Publishers.</ref>\n\n==Function==\nThe occipital lobe is divided into several functional visual areas.  Each visual area contains a full map of the visual world.  Although there are no anatomical markers distinguishing these areas (except for the prominent striations in the [[striate cortex]]), physiologists have used electrode recordings to divide the cortex into different functional regions.\n\nThe first functional area is the [[primary visual cortex]].  It contains a low-level description of the local orientation, spatial-frequency and color properties within small [[receptive fields]].  [[Primary visual cortex]] projects to the occipital areas of the [[ventral stream]] ([[visual area V2]] and [[visual area V4]]), and the occipital areas of the [[dorsal stream]]\u2014[[visual area V3]], [[visual area MT]] (V5), and the [[dorsomedial area]] (DM).\n\nThe ventral stream is known for the processing the \"what\" in vision, while the dorsal stream handles the \"where/how.\" This is because the ventral stream provides important information for the identification of stimuli that are stored in memory. With this information in memory, the dorsal stream is able to focus on motor actions in response to the outside stimuli.\n\nAlthough numerous studies have shown that the two systems are independent and structured separately from another, there is also evidence that both are essential for successful perception, especially as the stimuli take on more complex forms. For example, a case study using fMRI was done on shape and location. The first procedure consisted of location tasks. The second procedure was in a lit-room where participants were shown stimuli on a screen for 600&nbsp;ms. They found that the two pathways play a role in shape perception even though location processing continues to lie within the dorsal stream.<ref>(Valyear, Culham, Sharif, Westwood, & Goodale, 2006).</ref>\n\nThe dorsomedial (DM) is not as thoroughly studied. However, there is some evidence that suggests that this stream interacts with other visual areas. A case study on monkeys revealed that information from V1 and V2 areas make up half the inputs in the DM. The remaining inputs are from multiple sources that have to do with any sort of visual processing <ref>(Valyear et al., 2006).</ref>\n\nA significant functional aspect of the occipital lobe is that it contains the primary visual cortex.\n\n[[Retina]]l [[photoreceptor cell|sensors]] convey stimuli through the optic tracts to the [[lateral geniculate body|lateral geniculate bodies]], where optic radiations continue to the visual cortex. Each visual cortex receives raw sensory information from the outside half of the retina on the same side of the head and from the inside half of the retina on the other side of the head. The cuneus (Brodmann's area 17) receives visual information from the contralateral superior retina representing the inferior visual field.  The lingula receives information from the contralateral inferior retina representing the superior visual field.  The retinal inputs pass through a \"way station\" in the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] of the [[thalamus]] before projecting to the cortex. Cells on the posterior aspect of the occipital lobes' [[gray matter]] are arranged as a spatial map of the retinal field. [[Functional neuroimaging]] reveals similar patterns of response in cortical tissue of the lobes when the retinal fields are exposed to a strong pattern.\nScrew All That , I Feel Somthing Else In There When I'm Listening To My Favorite Music!!!!\n\n==Clinical significance==\nIf one occipital lobe is damaged, the result can be [[homonymous hemianopsia]] [[vision loss]] from similarly positioned \"field cuts\" in each eye. Occipital [[lesion]]s can cause visual [[hallucination]]s. Lesions in the parietal-temporal-occipital [[association area]] are associated with [[color agnosia]], [[akinetopsia|movement agnosia]], and [[agraphia]].
