The 354&nbsp;MW SEGS was the largest solar power plant in the world, until 2014.\n\nNo commercial concentrated solar was constructed from 1990 when SEGS was completed until 2006 when the [[Compact linear Fresnel reflector]] system at Liddell Power Station in Australia was built. Few other plants were built with this design although the 5&nbsp;MW [[Kimberlina Solar Thermal Energy Plant]] opened in 2009.\n\nIn 2007, 75&nbsp;MW Nevada Solar One was built, a trough design and the first large plant since SEGS. Between 2009 and 2013, Spain built over 40 parabolic trough systems, standardized in 50&nbsp;MW blocks.\n\nDue to the success of Solar Two, a commercial power plant, called [[Gemasolar Thermosolar Plant|Solar Tres Power Tower]], was built in Spain in 2011, later renamed Gemasolar Thermosolar Plant. Gemasolar's results paved the way for further plants of its type. [[Ivanpah Solar Power Facility]] was constructed at the same time but without thermal storage, using natural gas to preheat water each morning.\n\nMost concentrated solar power plants use the parabolic trough design, instead of the power tower or Fresnel systems. There have also been variations of parabolic trough systems like the [[Combined cycle#Integrated solar combined cycle (ISCC)|integrated solar combined cycle (ISCC)]] which combines troughs and conventional fossil fuel heat systems.\n\nCSP was originally treated as a competitor to photovoltaics, and Ivanpah was built without energy storage, although Solar Two had included several hours of thermal storage.

Flat mirrors allow more reflective surface in the same amount of space than a parabolic reflector, thus capturing more of the available sunlight, and they are much cheaper than parabolic reflectors. Fresnel reflectors can be used in various size CSPs.<ref>[http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/app/research/solar/clfr.html Compact CLFR]. Physics.usyd.edu.au (12 June 2002).

The cost efficiency of this model is what causes some to use this instead of others with higher output ratings.

The study found that concentrated solar power could account for up to 25% of the world's energy needs by 2050.

Also, it exports its technology, further increasing the technology's stake in energy worldwide. Because the technology works best with areas of high [[insolation]] (solar radiation), experts predict the biggest growth in places like Africa, Mexico, and the southwest United States. It indicates that the thermal storage systems based in [[nitrates]] ([[Calcium nitrate|calcium]], [[Potassium nitrate|potassium]], [[Sodium nitrate|sodium]],...) will make the CSP plants more and more profitable. The study examined three different outcomes for this technology: no increases in CSP technology, investment continuing as it has been in Spain and the US, and finally the true potential of CSP without any barriers on its growth. The findings of the third part are shown in the table below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right; width: 330px;\"\n|-\n! Year !! Annual<br />Investment !!

The plan was backed mainly by German industrialists and predicted production of 15% of Europe's power by 2050. [[Morocco]] was a major partner in Desertec and as it has barely 1% of the electricity consumption of the EU, it could produce more than enough energy for the entire country with a large energy surplus to deliver to Europe.<ref name=\"reuters.com\">Tom Pfeiffer (23 August 2009) [https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE57N00920090824?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=11613 Europe's Saharan power plan: miracle or mirage?] ''Reuters''</ref> [[Algeria]] has the biggest area of desert, and private Algerian firm [[Cevital]] signed up for Desertec.<ref name=\"reuters.com\" /> With its wide desert (the highest CSP potential in the Mediterranean and Middle East regions ~ about 170&nbsp;TWh/year) and its strategic geographical location near Europe, Algeria is one of the key countries to ensure the success of Desertec project.

This plant had the architecture of today's power tower plants with a solar receiver in the center of a field of solar collectors. The plant was able to produce 1&nbsp;MW with superheated steam at 100 bar and 500&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>Ken Butti, John Perlin (1980) ''A Golden Thread: 2500 Years of Solar Architecture and Technology'', Cheshire Books, p. 68, {{ISBN|0442240058}}.</ref> The 10&nbsp;MW [[The Solar Project|Solar One]] power tower was developed in Southern California in 1981.

The molten salt approach proved effective, and Solar Two operated successfully until it was decommissioned in 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2015/ph240/dodaro2/|title=Molten Salt Storage|website=large.stanford.edu|access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref> The parabolic-trough technology of the nearby [[Solar Energy Generating Systems]] (SEGS), begun in 1984, was more workable. The 354&nbsp;MW SEGS was the largest solar power plant in the world, until 2014.\n\nNo commercial concentrated solar was constructed from 1990 when SEGS was completed until 2006 when the [[Compact linear Fresnel reflector]] system at Liddell Power Station in Australia was built. Few other plants were built with this design although the 5&nbsp;MW [[Kimberlina Solar Thermal Energy Plant]] opened in 2009.\n\nIn 2007, 75&nbsp;MW Nevada Solar One was built, a trough design and the first large plant since SEGS. Between 2009 and 2013, Spain built over 40 parabolic trough systems, standardized in 50&nbsp;MW blocks.\n\nDue to the success of Solar Two, a commercial power plant, called [[Gemasolar Thermosolar Plant|Solar Tres Power Tower]], was built in Spain in 2011, later renamed Gemasolar Thermosolar Plant. Gemasolar's results paved the way for further plants of its type. [[Ivanpah Solar Power Facility]] was constructed at the same time but without thermal storage, using natural gas to preheat water each morning.\n\nMost concentrated solar power plants use the parabolic trough design, instead of the power tower or Fresnel systems. There have also been variations of parabolic trough systems like the [[Combined cycle#Integrated solar combined cycle (ISCC)|integrated solar combined cycle (ISCC)]] which combines troughs and conventional fossil fuel heat systems.\n\nCSP was originally treated as a competitor to photovoltaics, and Ivanpah was built without energy storage, although Solar Two had included several hours of thermal storage. By 2015, prices for photovoltaic plants had fallen and PV commercial power was selling for {{frac|1|3}} of recent CSP contracts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2015/12/15/nrg-ivanpah-faces-chance-of-default-PGE-contract|title=Ivanpah Solar Project Faces Risk of Default on PG&E Contracts|work=KQED News|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325144752/http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2015/12/15/nrg-ivanpah-faces-chance-of-default-PGE-contract|archivedate=25 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://guntherportfolio.com/2013/04/esolar-sierra-suntower-a-history-of-concentrating-solar-power-underperformance/ |title=eSolar Sierra SunTower: a History of Concentrating Solar Power Underperformance|publisher=}}</ref> However, increasingly, CSP was being bid with 3 to 12 hours of thermal energy storage, making CSP a dispatchable form of solar energy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/why-concentrating-solar-power-needs-storage-to-survive#gs.zD6uAiA|title=Why Concentrating Solar Power Needs Storage to Survive|accessdate=21 November 2017}}</ref> As such, it is increasingly seen as competing with natural gas and PV with batteries for flexible, dispatchable power.\n\n== Current technology ==\nCSP is used to produce electricity (sometimes called solar thermoelectricity, usually generated through [[steam]]).

The concentrated light is then used as heat or as a heat source for a conventional [[power plant]] (solar thermoelectricity). The solar concentrators used in CSP systems can often also be used to provide industrial process heating or cooling, such as in [[solar air conditioning]].\n\nConcentrating technologies exist in four optical types, namely [[parabolic trough]], [[dish Stirling|dish]], [[Compact Linear Fresnel Reflector|concentrating linear Fresnel reflector]], and [[solar power tower]].<ref name=tomkonrad>[http://tomkonrad.wordpress.com/2006/12/07/they-do-it-with-mirrors-concentrating-solar-power/ Types of solar thermal CSP plants].

Fresnel reflectors can be used in various size CSPs.<ref>[http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/app/research/solar/clfr.html Compact CLFR]. Physics.usyd.edu.au (12 June 2002).

Although the heat engine's efficiency (Carnot) increases with higher temperature, the receiver's efficiency does not. On the contrary, the receiver's efficiency is decreasing, as the amount of energy it cannot absorb (Q<sub>lost</sub>) grows by the fourth power as a function of temperature. Hence, there is a maximum reachable temperature.

These certificates can then be sold and transferred to liable entities (usually electricity retailers) to meet their obligations under this tradeable certificates scheme.

Also, it exports its technology, further increasing the technology's stake in energy worldwide. Because the technology works best with areas of high [[insolation]] (solar radiation), experts predict the biggest growth in places like Africa, Mexico, and the southwest United States. It indicates that the thermal storage systems based in [[nitrates]] ([[Calcium nitrate|calcium]], [[Potassium nitrate|potassium]], [[Sodium nitrate|sodium]],...) will make the CSP plants more and more profitable. The study examined three different outcomes for this technology: no increases in CSP technology, investment continuing as it has been in Spain and the US, and finally the true potential of CSP without any barriers on its growth. The findings of the third part are shown in the table below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right; width: 330px;\"\n|-\n! Year !! Annual<br />Investment !!

The plan was backed mainly by German industrialists and predicted production of 15% of Europe's power by 2050. [[Morocco]] was a major partner in Desertec and as it has barely 1% of the electricity consumption of the EU, it could produce more than enough energy for the entire country with a large energy surplus to deliver to Europe.<ref name=\"reuters.com\">Tom Pfeiffer (23 August 2009) [https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE57N00920090824?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=11613 Europe's Saharan power plan: miracle or mirage?] ''Reuters''</ref> [[Algeria]] has the biggest area of desert, and private Algerian firm [[Cevital]] signed up for Desertec.<ref name=\"reuters.com\" /> With its wide desert (the highest CSP potential in the Mediterranean and Middle East regions ~ about 170&nbsp;TWh/year) and its strategic geographical location near Europe, Algeria is one of the key countries to ensure the success of Desertec project.

Most of the participants pulled out of the effort at the end of 2014.\n\nOther organizations had predicted CSP to cost $0.06(US)/kWh by 2015 due to efficiency improvements and mass production of equipment.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/internal_ReutersNewsRoom_BehindTheScenes_MOLT/idUSTRE57N01720090824?sp=true CSP and photovoltaic solar power], ''Reuters'' (23 August 2009).</ref> That would have made CSP as cheap as conventional power.

It also is much easier to deploy and install. The glossy film uses several layers of polymers, with an inner layer of pure silver.\n\nTelescope designer [[Roger Angel]] ([[Univ. of Arizona]]) has turned his attention to [[Concentrated photovoltaics|CPV]], and is a partner in a company called Rehnu.

After initially denying the allegations, Haggard claimed to have purchased methamphetamine and thrown it away without using it. Haggard resigned his post at New Life Church and his other leadership roles shortly after the allegations became public. Later, Haggard admitted to having used drugs, participated in some sexual activity with Jones, and engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a young man who attended New Life Church.\n\nIn 2010, Haggard and his wife, Gayle, founded St. James Church in Colorado Springs; as of September 2018, Haggard continues to serve as founding pastor at St. James Church.\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:New Life Church in Colorado Springs 2.jpg|thumb|The main entrance of New Life Church in Colorado Springs]]\nHaggard was born in [[Indiana]].<ref>Sharlett, p. 42.</ref> His father, J.

Regardless, Haggard responded by saying, \"We're so grateful that he failed a polygraph test this morning, my accuser did.\" Jones was not asked questions about drug use.

He believed that churches and their members either lived \"in the Tree of Life\" or \"in the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil\", referring to the two trees in the Garden of Eden (see Gen. 2:9). He wrote a book, ''The Life-Giving Church,'' to expound on this difference, and said that motivations are the key difference between two types of Christians. \"One way we can tell which tree we are living in,\" wrote Haggard, \"is our response to sin... one of the greatest marks of bearing His [Christ's] character is our response to someone else's sin. If we handle others' mistakes with a life-giving attitude, then we (and they) have the opportunity to enjoy great power and freedom. But if we handle others' mistakes negatively, then we're eating from the wrong tree and will begin to die.\" Christians who live in the \"tree of life,\" writes Haggard, \"grow in their understanding of right and wrong, and they find great insight, wisdom, victory, and joy in the stream of Jesus' righteousness.\" Those who dwell in the opposite tree find and display \"frustration, judgmental attitudes, and death.\"<ref name= \"Haggard, Ted 2001\">Haggard, Ted, ''The Life-Giving Church,'' pp. 51\u201361 Regal Books, 2001.</ref>\n\nIn ''The Life-Giving Church'', Haggard sets forth bylaws he initiated that were meant to help other churches with forming their own bylaws. A significant part of the bylaws was a universal pay scale Haggard instituted for all pastoral staff. Including himself, all pastors at New Life Church were paid on the same scale so that the longer one was employed, the better the pay became.<ref>Haggard, Ted, ''The Life-Giving Church'', pp. 220\u201365, Regal Books, 2001.</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Forman, Bill, \"The Resurrection of Pastor Ted\", ''Colorado Springs Independent'', October 1, 2009.</ref>\n\nA significant part of Haggard's ministry at New Life Church was based around an entrepreneurial leadership model, which is also covered in ''The Life-Giving Church.'' Haggard felt that young and upcoming leaders of the church would bog down in \"cumbersome systems\" in their churches and decide to take their talents elsewhere, resulting in the church losing its \"brightest and best future leaders\".<ref>Haggard, Ted, ''The Life-Giving Church'', p. 48, Regal Books, 2001.</ref> Rather than a top-down command and control hierarchy where Haggard made all the decisions and people fell in line, he instituted a free market concept that encouraged young leaders to debate the best ideas (even to the point of disagreeing with him) and pursue God-inspired dreams and visions in their own departments and beyond.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In Haggard's book, ''Primary Purpose'', he explains that the normal leadership style that governments and many corporations use is top down, while the servant leadership model he teaches is the opposite. In a visual representation, Haggard uses an upside down triangle to illustrate this concept. The leader is at the bottom and the people to be served are on top. This \"Philippians 2 Attitude\" comes from the scripture that states, \"Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves. Each of you should look not only to your interests, but also to the interests of others.\"<ref>Haggard, Ted, ''Primary Purpose,'' pp. 128\u201331.

He served as President of the [[National Association of Evangelicals]] (NAE) from 2003 until November 2006.\n\nHaggard made national headlines in November 2006 when male [[Prostitution|prostitute]] and [[masseur]] Mike Jones alleged that Haggard, who had advocated against the legalization of same-sex marriage, had paid him for sex for three years and had also purchased and used [[crystal methamphetamine]]. After initially denying the allegations, Haggard claimed to have purchased methamphetamine and thrown it away without using it. Haggard resigned his post at New Life Church and his other leadership roles shortly after the allegations became public. Later, Haggard admitted to having used drugs, participated in some sexual activity with Jones, and engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a young man who attended New Life Church.\n\nIn 2010, Haggard and his wife, Gayle, founded St. James Church in Colorado Springs; as of September 2018, Haggard continues to serve as founding pastor at St. James Church.\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:New Life Church in Colorado Springs 2.jpg|thumb|The main entrance of New Life Church in Colorado Springs]]\nHaggard was born in [[Indiana]].<ref>Sharlett, p. 42.</ref> His father, J.

Jones volunteered to take a polygraph test on a [[KHOW]] radio show hosted by [[Peter Boyles]], where Jones first made the allegations. However, Jones's responses during the section of the polygraph test about whether he had engaged in sex with Haggard indicated deception.

Regardless, Haggard responded by saying, \"We're so grateful that he failed a polygraph test this morning, my accuser did.\" Jones was not asked questions about drug use.

He believed that churches and their members either lived \"in the Tree of Life\" or \"in the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil\", referring to the two trees in the Garden of Eden (see Gen. 2:9). He wrote a book, ''The Life-Giving Church,'' to expound on this difference, and said that motivations are the key difference between two types of Christians. \"One way we can tell which tree we are living in,\" wrote Haggard, \"is our response to sin... one of the greatest marks of bearing His [Christ's] character is our response to someone else's sin. If we handle others' mistakes with a life-giving attitude, then we (and they) have the opportunity to enjoy great power and freedom. But if we handle others' mistakes negatively, then we're eating from the wrong tree and will begin to die.\" Christians who live in the \"tree of life,\" writes Haggard, \"grow in their understanding of right and wrong, and they find great insight, wisdom, victory, and joy in the stream of Jesus' righteousness.\" Those who dwell in the opposite tree find and display \"frustration, judgmental attitudes, and death.\"<ref name= \"Haggard, Ted 2001\">Haggard, Ted, ''The Life-Giving Church,'' pp. 51\u201361 Regal Books, 2001.</ref>\n\nIn ''The Life-Giving Church'', Haggard sets forth bylaws he initiated that were meant to help other churches with forming their own bylaws. A significant part of the bylaws was a universal pay scale Haggard instituted for all pastoral staff. Including himself, all pastors at New Life Church were paid on the same scale so that the longer one was employed, the better the pay became.<ref>Haggard, Ted, ''The Life-Giving Church'', pp. 220\u201365, Regal Books, 2001.</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Forman, Bill, \"The Resurrection of Pastor Ted\", ''Colorado Springs Independent'', October 1, 2009.</ref>\n\nA significant part of Haggard's ministry at New Life Church was based around an entrepreneurial leadership model, which is also covered in ''The Life-Giving Church.'' Haggard felt that young and upcoming leaders of the church would bog down in \"cumbersome systems\" in their churches and decide to take their talents elsewhere, resulting in the church losing its \"brightest and best future leaders\".<ref>Haggard, Ted, ''The Life-Giving Church'', p. 48, Regal Books, 2001.</ref> Rather than a top-down command and control hierarchy where Haggard made all the decisions and people fell in line, he instituted a free market concept that encouraged young leaders to debate the best ideas (even to the point of disagreeing with him) and pursue God-inspired dreams and visions in their own departments and beyond.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In Haggard's book, ''Primary Purpose'', he explains that the normal leadership style that governments and many corporations use is top down, while the servant leadership model he teaches is the opposite. In a visual representation, Haggard uses an upside down triangle to illustrate this concept. The leader is at the bottom and the people to be served are on top. This \"Philippians 2 Attitude\" comes from the scripture that states, \"Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves. Each of you should look not only to your interests, but also to the interests of others.\"<ref>Haggard, Ted, ''Primary Purpose,'' pp. 128\u201331.

Nenana developed as a [[Tanana Athabaskans|Lower Tanana]] community at the confluence where the tributary [[Nenana River]] enters the [[Tanana River|Tanana]]. The population was 378 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], down from 402 in 2000.\n\nCompleted in 1923, the {{convert|700|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[Mears Memorial Bridge]] was built over the Tanana River as part of the territory's railroad project connecting [[Anchorage]] and [[Fairbanks]].\n\n==History and culture==\nNenana is in the westernmost portion of [[Tanana Athabaskans|Tanana]] territory. (The Tanana are among the large  [[Den\u00e9]] language family, also known as Athabascan.) The town was first known by European Americans as ''Tortella,'' a transliteration of the Indian word ''Toghotthele'' (TOG-uh-TEE-lee), which means \"mountain that parallels the river.\" It was later named for the river and the Nenana people who live nearby. The Nenana people became accustomed to contact with Europeans, due to trading journeys to the Village of [[Tanana, Alaska|Tanana]], where Russians bartered Western goods for furs from 1838.<ref name=\"tortella\"/>\n\nThe United States purchased Alaska from [[Russia]] in 1867. Early American explorers and traders, such as [[Henry Tureman Allen]], [[Arthur Harper (trader)|Arthur Harper]] and Bates, first entered the [[Tanana Valley]] in 1874 and 1885.<ref name=\"tortella\">[http://library.alaska.gov/hist/hist_docs/finding_aids/MS004-11-02.doc Guide to Collection: St. Mark's Mission, Nenana, Alaska; \"Biographical/Historical Note\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129013142/http://library.alaska.gov/hist/hist_docs/finding_aids/MS004-11-02.doc |date=2016-01-29 }}, 2010, State of Alaska Library, accessed 22 September 2013</ref>\n\nIn 1902 the discovery of gold in [[Fairbanks]] brought intense activity to the region. The next year, Jim Duke built a trading post/roadhouse to supply river travelers and trade with the Nenana community.\n\nIn 1905 the Episcopal Church, which had missionaries in Alaska, built the St. Mark's Episcopal mission and Tortella School a short distance upriver. The boarding school taught about 28 children of various ages at a time.<ref name=\"tortella\"/> [[Hudson Stuck]], the Archdeacon of the Yukon, regularly visited the settlement, part of the 250,000 square-acre territory of the Interior he administered. Native children from other communities, such as [[Minto, Alaska|Minto]], also attended school in Nenana.<ref name=\"tortella\"/>\n\nA post office opened in 1908. In 1915, construction of the [[Alaska Railroad]] brought new settlers, who doubled Nenana's population. The railroad connected Nenana to the southern port city of Anchorage. The community incorporated as a city in 1921.\n\nThe Railroad Depot was completed in 1923. That year, United States President [[Warren Harding]] arrived to drive the final, golden spike at the north end of the {{convert|700|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[Mears Memorial Bridge]] built over the Tanana River as part of the state's railroad project.\n\nThis railroad truss bridge, the longest in the United States and its territories when completed, gave Nenana a rail transportation link north to Fairbanks and [[Seward, Alaska]]. The bridge still ranks as the longest span in Alaska and the third-longest truss bridge in the United States.\n\nThe construction had encouraged businesses and settlement in town. According to local records, 5,000 residents lived in Nenana by the early 1920s. After the railroad was completed, however, contractors and construction workers left the area. The city suffered an economic slump, and most of the residents migrated to seek work in other places. By 1930, the population had dropped to 291.\n\nNenana was the starting point for the [[1925 serum run to Nome]], after [[diphtheria]] antitoxin had been transported by rail from [[Anchorage]]. It was carried by [[dog sled]] to Nome to treat people in an [[epidemic]].\n\nIn 1961, [[Clear Air Force Station]] was constructed 21 miles southwest. During this construction, many civilian contractors commuted from Nenana. A road was constructed south to Clear, but northbound vehicles had to be ferried across the Tanana River.\n\nIn 1967 the community was devastated by one of the largest floods ever recorded in the valley. In 1968 a $6 million bridge for vehicles was completed across the Tanana River, which gave the town a modern road link to Fairbanks and replaced the river ferry. The [[George Parks Highway]] was completed in 1971, providing a shorter, direct route to [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]].\n\nThe federally recognized tribe in the community is the [[Nenana Native Association]], who traditionally spoke the [[Lower Tanana language]]. Under the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]] of 1971, they have rights of self-government and managing some of their traditional territory. According to the 2000 Census, 41% of the city residents were Native American (or Alaska Natives).\n\nResidents of Nenana sponsor the [[Nenana Ice Classic]], a nature-based lottery. Entrants buy a ticket and pick a date in April or May and a time, to the closest minute, when they think the winter ice on the [[Tanana River]] will break up. This lottery began in 1917 among a group of surveyors working for the Alaska Railroad. They formed a [[betting pool]] as they waited for the river to open and boats to arrive with needed supplies.\n\nThe competition is run as follows: a large striped tripod is placed on the frozen Tanana River and connected to a clock. The winner is whoever comes closest to guessing the precise time when the ice beneath weakens to the point that the tripod moves and stops the clock. Interest in the pool has increased and attracts bettors statewide. This lottery has paid out nearly $10 million in prize money, with the winning pool in recent years being near $300,000.\n\nIn the summer of 2008, Nenana suffered heavy damage due to [[2008 Tanana Valley flood|flooding]]. The Tanana River reached its second-highest level since written record keeping began.\n\n==Geography and climate==\nNenana is located at {{Coord|64|33|50|N|149|5|35|W|type:city_region:US}},<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> (Sec. 14, T004S, R008W, Fairbanks Meridian) in the Nenana [[Recording District (Alaska)|Recording District]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|6.1|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|6.0|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} of it (0.99%) is water.\n\nNenana is located 55 road miles southwest of Fairbanks on the [[George Parks Highway]] and 304 road miles north of Anchorage.

A piped gravity system collects sewage, which is treated at a secondary treatment plant. Most of the City is connected to the piped water and sewer system: 215 homes and the school are served. The remaining homes have individual wells and septic systems.\n\nRefuse is collected by a private firm and hauled to the new Denali Borough regional landfill, located south of Anderson. Electricity is provided by Golden Valley Electric Association. [[Nenana School District|A school]] provides education for grades kindergarten through 12 (200 students).  The [[Nenana Student Living Center]], one of three statewide boarding schools for high school students, attracts students from around the state to attend the local school.

Golden Valley Electric Association has a regional office in Nenana. Nenana has a rural lifestyle but has good access to Fairbanks on the major north-south George Parks Highway.\n\nNenana has affordable housing and low rents.  The private sector economy is based on its role as the center of rail-to-river barge transportation for the Interior. Crowley Marine is a major private employer, supplying villages along the Tanana and [[Yukon River|Yukon]] rivers each summer with cargo and fuel.\n\nThe City also attracts independent travelers with such attractions as the Alaska Railroad Museum, the Golden Railroad Spike Historic Park and Interpretive Center, the historical St. Mark's Episcopal Church (built in 1905), [[Iditarod]] dog kennels, and a replica of the [[sternwheeler]] ''Nenana.'' A heritage center features displays of local culture and history, and is open during the summer tourist season from May to September.\n\nNenana is a center of dog mushing; a number of world-class teams train in the area. It is also home to a number of artists whose works reflect the local frontier lifestyle. A number of large farms produce quality and specialized crops in some of the best growing conditions in Alaska.  The Nenana Ice Classic administration provides employment for nearly 100 locals during the counting and tabulation of entries for the Tanana River ice breakup. Twenty-seven residents hold commercial fishing permits. Numerous Native and non-Native households rely on traditional subsistence foods, such as salmon, moose, caribou, bear, waterfowl and berries.\n\nTaxes:\tSales: 4%, Property: 12.0 mills, Special: None\n\nNenana has air, river, road and railroad access. The George Parks Highway provides road access to Fairbanks and Anchorage. A boat landing at the end of 10th street turning west off the George Parks Highway provides free boat access to the Nenana River. A short distance north of the landing is the confluence of the Nenana and Tanana rivers, so boaters have easy access to the river system of the Tanana River and Minto Flats. The boat landing is used by hundreds of hunters and outdoor enthusiasts each year.\n\nThe railroad provides daily freight service. The [[Nenana Municipal Airport]] offers two landing areas: a lighted, asphalt runway 5,000 feet long by 100 feet wide, and an airstrip, turf, 2,520 feet long by 80 feet wide. The airport also has landing areas for float planes and ski planes. The Nenana Port Authority operates the dry cargo loading and unloading facilities, dock, bulkhead, and warehouse. The Tanana River is shallow, with a maximum draft for loaded river barges of 4.5 feet; by comparison, the Yukon River has few shallow areas.\n\n==Popular culture==\nNenana and the Ice Classic were featured in the 1938 movie ''Call of the Yukon''. [[Richard Arlen]] and [[Beverly Roberts]] played a mis-matched pair on a trek to Nenana to escape a village famine.\n\nNenana was also featured in the 1995 animated movie ''[[Balto (film)|Balto]]''. Nenana was where the antitoxin was unloaded from the [[Alaska Railroad]] and run to [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] by dogsled.\n\nNenana was also featured in Season 6 of Life Below Zero 2015 depicting Jesse who lives with his 25 sled dogs and lives off the land.\n\nIt was also featured in the BBC World Series Alaska.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Nenana,

The population was 378 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], down from 402 in 2000.\n\nCompleted in 1923, the {{convert|700|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[Mears Memorial Bridge]] was built over the Tanana River as part of the territory's railroad project connecting [[Anchorage]] and [[Fairbanks]].\n\n==History and culture==\nNenana is in the westernmost portion of [[Tanana Athabaskans|Tanana]] territory. (The Tanana are among the large  [[Den\u00e9]] language family, also known as Athabascan.) The town was first known by European Americans as ''Tortella,'' a transliteration of the Indian word ''Toghotthele'' (TOG-uh-TEE-lee), which means \"mountain that parallels the river.\" It was later named for the river and the Nenana people who live nearby. The Nenana people became accustomed to contact with Europeans, due to trading journeys to the Village of [[Tanana, Alaska|Tanana]], where Russians bartered Western goods for furs from 1838.<ref name=\"tortella\"/>\n\nThe United States purchased Alaska from [[Russia]] in 1867. Early American explorers and traders, such as [[Henry Tureman Allen]], [[Arthur Harper (trader)|Arthur Harper]] and Bates, first entered the [[Tanana Valley]] in 1874 and 1885.<ref name=\"tortella\">[http://library.alaska.gov/hist/hist_docs/finding_aids/MS004-11-02.doc Guide to Collection: St. Mark's Mission, Nenana, Alaska; \"Biographical/Historical Note\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129013142/http://library.alaska.gov/hist/hist_docs/finding_aids/MS004-11-02.doc |date=2016-01-29 }}, 2010, State of Alaska Library, accessed 22 September 2013</ref>\n\nIn 1902 the discovery of gold in [[Fairbanks]] brought intense activity to the region. The next year, Jim Duke built a trading post/roadhouse to supply river travelers and trade with the Nenana community.\n\nIn 1905 the Episcopal Church, which had missionaries in Alaska, built the St. Mark's Episcopal mission and Tortella School a short distance upriver. The boarding school taught about 28 children of various ages at a time.<ref name=\"tortella\"/> [[Hudson Stuck]], the Archdeacon of the Yukon, regularly visited the settlement, part of the 250,000 square-acre territory of the Interior he administered. Native children from other communities, such as [[Minto, Alaska|Minto]], also attended school in Nenana.<ref name=\"tortella\"/>\n\nA post office opened in 1908. In 1915, construction of the [[Alaska Railroad]] brought new settlers, who doubled Nenana's population. The railroad connected Nenana to the southern port city of Anchorage. The community incorporated as a city in 1921.\n\nThe Railroad Depot was completed in 1923. That year, United States President [[Warren Harding]] arrived to drive the final, golden spike at the north end of the {{convert|700|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[Mears Memorial Bridge]] built over the Tanana River as part of the state's railroad project.\n\nThis railroad truss bridge, the longest in the United States and its territories when completed, gave Nenana a rail transportation link north to Fairbanks and [[Seward, Alaska]]. The bridge still ranks as the longest span in Alaska and the third-longest truss bridge in the United States.\n\nThe construction had encouraged businesses and settlement in town. According to local records, 5,000 residents lived in Nenana by the early 1920s. After the railroad was completed, however, contractors and construction workers left the area. The city suffered an economic slump, and most of the residents migrated to seek work in other places. By 1930, the population had dropped to 291.\n\nNenana was the starting point for the [[1925 serum run to Nome]], after [[diphtheria]] antitoxin had been transported by rail from [[Anchorage]]. It was carried by [[dog sled]] to Nome to treat people in an [[epidemic]].\n\nIn 1961, [[Clear Air Force Station]] was constructed 21 miles southwest. During this construction, many civilian contractors commuted from Nenana. A road was constructed south to Clear, but northbound vehicles had to be ferried across the Tanana River.\n\nIn 1967 the community was devastated by one of the largest floods ever recorded in the valley. In 1968 a $6 million bridge for vehicles was completed across the Tanana River, which gave the town a modern road link to Fairbanks and replaced the river ferry. The [[George Parks Highway]] was completed in 1971, providing a shorter, direct route to [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]].\n\nThe federally recognized tribe in the community is the [[Nenana Native Association]], who traditionally spoke the [[Lower Tanana language]]. Under the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]] of 1971, they have rights of self-government and managing some of their traditional territory. According to the 2000 Census, 41% of the city residents were Native American (or Alaska Natives).\n\nResidents of Nenana sponsor the [[Nenana Ice Classic]], a nature-based lottery. Entrants buy a ticket and pick a date in April or May and a time, to the closest minute, when they think the winter ice on the [[Tanana River]] will break up. This lottery began in 1917 among a group of surveyors working for the Alaska Railroad. They formed a [[betting pool]] as they waited for the river to open and boats to arrive with needed supplies.\n\nThe competition is run as follows: a large striped tripod is placed on the frozen Tanana River and connected to a clock. The winner is whoever comes closest to guessing the precise time when the ice beneath weakens to the point that the tripod moves and stops the clock. Interest in the pool has increased and attracts bettors statewide. This lottery has paid out nearly $10 million in prize money, with the winning pool in recent years being near $300,000.\n\nIn the summer of 2008, Nenana suffered heavy damage due to [[2008 Tanana Valley flood|flooding]]. The Tanana River reached its second-highest level since written record keeping began.\n\n==Geography and climate==\nNenana is located at {{Coord|64|33|50|N|149|5|35|W|type:city_region:US}},<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> (Sec. 14, T004S, R008W, Fairbanks Meridian) in the Nenana [[Recording District (Alaska)|Recording District]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|6.1|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|6.0|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} of it (0.99%) is water.\n\nNenana is located 55 road miles southwest of Fairbanks on the [[George Parks Highway]] and 304 road miles north of Anchorage.

A piped gravity system collects sewage, which is treated at a secondary treatment plant. Most of the City is connected to the piped water and sewer system: 215 homes and the school are served. The remaining homes have individual wells and septic systems.\n\nRefuse is collected by a private firm and hauled to the new Denali Borough regional landfill, located south of Anderson. Electricity is provided by Golden Valley Electric Association. [[Nenana School District|A school]] provides education for grades kindergarten through 12 (200 students).  The [[Nenana Student Living Center]], one of three statewide boarding schools for high school students, attracts students from around the state to attend the local school. The school has an extensive arts program (music, artistic and performing programs), strong academic quality, and vocational studies.\n\nThe City has a library with a full-time librarian, internet access and full library services, including inter-library loans. Health clinic services are provided by the Nenana Native Clinic.  A regional hospital is located in Fairbanks, 55 miles away.  Specialized services include the Railbelt Mental Health & Addiction Services.\n\nEmergency Services have highway, river and airport access. 911 emergency service is available in Nenana; auxiliary health care is provided by Nenana Volunteer Fire/EMS or Fairbanks hospitals.

Golden Valley Electric Association has a regional office in Nenana. Nenana has a rural lifestyle but has good access to Fairbanks on the major north-south George Parks Highway.\n\nNenana has affordable housing and low rents.  The private sector economy is based on its role as the center of rail-to-river barge transportation for the Interior. Crowley Marine is a major private employer, supplying villages along the Tanana and [[Yukon River|Yukon]] rivers each summer with cargo and fuel.\n\nThe City also attracts independent travelers with such attractions as the Alaska Railroad Museum, the Golden Railroad Spike Historic Park and Interpretive Center, the historical St. Mark's Episcopal Church (built in 1905), [[Iditarod]] dog kennels, and a replica of the [[sternwheeler]] ''Nenana.'' A heritage center features displays of local culture and history, and is open during the summer tourist season from May to September.\n\nNenana is a center of dog mushing; a number of world-class teams train in the area. It is also home to a number of artists whose works reflect the local frontier lifestyle. A number of large farms produce quality and specialized crops in some of the best growing conditions in Alaska.  The Nenana Ice Classic administration provides employment for nearly 100 locals during the counting and tabulation of entries for the Tanana River ice breakup. Twenty-seven residents hold commercial fishing permits. Numerous Native and non-Native households rely on traditional subsistence foods, such as salmon, moose, caribou, bear, waterfowl and berries.\n\nTaxes:\tSales: 4%, Property: 12.0 mills, Special: None\n\nNenana has air, river, road and railroad access. The George Parks Highway provides road access to Fairbanks and Anchorage. A boat landing at the end of 10th street turning west off the George Parks Highway provides free boat access to the Nenana River. A short distance north of the landing is the confluence of the Nenana and Tanana rivers, so boaters have easy access to the river system of the Tanana River and Minto Flats. The boat landing is used by hundreds of hunters and outdoor enthusiasts each year.\n\nThe railroad provides daily freight service. The [[Nenana Municipal Airport]] offers two landing areas: a lighted, asphalt runway 5,000 feet long by 100 feet wide, and an airstrip, turf, 2,520 feet long by 80 feet wide. The airport also has landing areas for float planes and ski planes. The Nenana Port Authority operates the dry cargo loading and unloading facilities, dock, bulkhead, and warehouse. The Tanana River is shallow, with a maximum draft for loaded river barges of 4.5 feet; by comparison, the Yukon River has few shallow areas.\n\n==Popular culture==\nNenana and the Ice Classic were featured in the 1938 movie ''Call of the Yukon''. [[Richard Arlen]] and [[Beverly Roberts]] played a mis-matched pair on a trek to Nenana to escape a village famine.\n\nNenana was also featured in the 1995 animated movie ''[[Balto (film)|Balto]]''. Nenana was where the antitoxin was unloaded from the [[Alaska Railroad]] and run to [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] by dogsled.\n\nNenana was also featured in Season 6 of Life Below Zero 2015 depicting Jesse who lives with his 25 sled dogs and lives off the land.\n\nIt was also featured in the BBC World Series Alaska.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Nenana, Alaska}}\n* [http://www.nenanahomepage.com Community-based information about Nenana]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120206221347/http://nenanasd.org/default.aspx Nenana City School District]\n* \n* [https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/dcra/DCRAExternal/community/Details=Nenana Alaska Division of Community Advocacy - Community Information Summary] {{dead link|date=December 2015}}\n\n{{Yukon\u2013Koyukuk Census Area, Alaska}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cities in Alaska]]\n[[Category:Cities in Yukon\u2013Koyukuk Census Area, Alaska]]\n", "name_user": "Menchi", "label": "safe", "comment": "langtags", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nenana,_Alaska"}
{"title_page": "Rotary phase converter", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{Refimprove|date=October 2015}}\n{{original research|date=January 2013}}\n}}\n[[Image:Basic Phase Converter.jpg|thumb|200px|A simple homemade phase converter]]\n\nA '''rotary phase converter''', abbreviated '''RPC''', is an [[electrical machine]] that converts power from one [[polyphase system]] (including frequency) to another, converting through rotary motion. Typically, [[single-phase electric power]] is used to produce [[three-phase electric power]] locally to run three-phase loads (any industrial machinery with three-phase motors) in premises (often residential or consumer) where only single-phase is available.\n\n==Operation==\nThe main principles of RPC operation are as follows:\n\nA basic, single-voltage three-phase induction motor will have three windings, each end connected to terminals typically numbered (arbitrarily) as L1, L2, and L3 and sometimes T1, T2, T3. \n\nA three-phase induction motor can be run at two-thirds of its rated horsepower on single-phase power applied to a single winding, once spun up by some means.  A three-phase motor running on a single phase cannot start itself because it lacks the other phases to create a rotation on its own, much like a crank that is at dead center.\n\nA three-phase induction motor that is spinning under single-phase power applied to terminals L1 and L2 will generate an electric potential (voltage) across terminal L3 in respect with L1 and L2.  However, L1 to L3 and L2 to L3 will be 120 degrees out of phase with the input voltage, thus creating 3 phase power. However, without current injection, special idler windings, or other means of regulation, the voltage will sag when a load is applied.\n\n[[Power factor correction#Power factor correction in non-linear loads|Power factor correction]] is a very important consideration when building or choosing an RPC. This is desirable because an RPC that has power factor correction will consume less current from the single-phase service supplying power to the phase converter and its loads.  \n\nA major concern with three phase power is that each phase be at similar voltages.  A discrepancy between phases is known as phase imbalance. As a general guideline, unbalanced three-phase power that exceeds 4% in voltage variation can damage the equipment that it is meant to operate.\n\n==History==\n[[File:V50.jpg|thumbnail|right|The first locomotive with a phase converter (only for demonstration purposes)]]\n[[File:Kand\u00f3-f\u00e9le f\u00e1zisv\u00e1lt\u00f3 1933-ban.jpg|thumb|right|262px|The Kand\u00f3 phase converter (1933)]]\n[[File:Kando mozdony.jpg|thumbnail|right|The \"Kand\u00f3\" locomotive, the first locomotive using a phase converter system]]\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, there were two main principles of electric railway [[traction current]] systems:\n# DC system\n# 16\u2154&nbsp;Hz [[single phase]] system\nThese systems used [[Universal motor|series-wound traction motors]]. All of them needed a separated supply system or converters to take power from the standard 50&nbsp;Hz electric network.\n\n=== Kand\u00f3 synchronous phase converter ===\n[[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Kand\u00f3]] recognized that the electric traction system must be supplied by single-phase 50&nbsp;Hz power from the standard electric network, and it must be converted in the locomotive to three-phase power for traction motors.\n<!-- \nClarify. Series motors, and why 1 phase on the supply? The series motor needs 16 1/3 Hz network. The single phase needs because a single overhead line can supply only a single-phase. More overhead lines increases expenses and decreases the speed\n-->\n\nHe created an electric machine called a synchronous phase converter, which was a single-phase [[synchronous motor]] and a three-phase [[synchronous generator]] with common stator and rotor.\n\nIt had two independent windings:\n* The outer winding is a single-phase synchronous motor. The motor takes the power from the [[overhead line]].\n* The inner winding is a three-phase (or variable-phase) synchronous generator, which provides the power for the three- (or more) phase traction motors.\n\n=== Single-phase supply ===\nThe direct feed from a standard electric network makes the system less complicated than the earlier systems and makes possible simple recuperation.\n\nThe single-phase feed makes it possible to use a single overhead line. More overhead lines increase the costs, and restrict the maximum speed of train.\n\n=== Speed control ===\nThe asynchronous traction motor can run on a single RPM determined by the frequency of the feeding current and the loading torque.\n\nThe solution was to use more secondary windings on phase converter, and more windings on motor different number of magnetic poles.\n\n==Types ==\nA rotary phase converter (RPC) may be built as a [[motor-generator]] set. These completely isolate the load from the single-phase supply and produce balanced three-phase output. However, due to weight, cost, and efficiency concerns, most RPCs are not built this way.\n\nInstead, they are built out of a three-phase induction motor or generator, called an idler, on which two of the terminals (the idler inputs) are powered from the single-phase line.  The [[Magnetic flux|rotating flux]] in the motor produces a voltage on the third terminal. A voltage is induced in the third terminal that is phase shifted from the voltage between the first two terminals. In a three-winding motor, two of the windings are acting as a motor, and the third winding is acting as a generator.  Because two of the outputs are the same as the single phase input, their phase relationship is 180\u00b0. This leaves the synthesized phase to be +/-90\u00b0 from the input terminals.  This non-ideal phase relationship requires a slight power de-rating of motors driven by this type of phase converter. Also, since the third, synthesized phase is driven differently from the other two, its response to load changes may be different causing this phase to sag more under load.  Since induction motors are sensitive to voltage imbalance, this is another factor in de-rating of motors driven by this type of phase converter.  For example, a small 5% imbalance in phase voltage requires a much larger 24% reduction of motor rated power.<ref name=\"MotorDerating\">{{cite web |title=Voltage Imbalance - Derating Factor in Polyphase Motors |url=https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/electrical-motor-voltage-imbalance-d_648.html |website=engineeringtoolbox.com |publisher=The Engineering Toolbox |accessdate=17 November 2019}}</ref> Thus tuning a rotary phase converter circuit for equal phase voltages under maximum load may be quite important.\n\n===Power quality===\nA common measure of the quality of the power produced by an RPC or any phase converter is the voltage balance, which may be measured while the RPC is driving a balanced load such as a three-phase motor. Other quality measures include the harmonic content of the power produced and the [[power factor]] of the RPC motor combination as seen by the utility. Selection of the best phase converter for any application depends on the sensitivity of the load to these factors.   Three-phase [[induction motor]]s are very sensitive to voltage imbalances.\n\nThe quality of three-phase power generated by such a phase converter depends upon a number of factors including:\n* Power capacity of the phase converter (idler horsepower rating).\n* Power level demands of the equipment being supplied. For instance, \"hard starting\" loads such as heavily loaded machinery or well pumps may have higher requirements than other loads rated at the same horsepower.\n* Power quality demands of the equipment being supplied ([[Numerical control|CNC equipment]] may have more stringent power quality requirements than a [[Arc welding|welding machine]])\n* Use of techniques to balance the voltage between the three legs.\n\n===Quality improvement===\nRPC manufacturers use a variety of techniques to deal with these problems. Some of the techniques include,\n\n*  The insertion of capacitors between the terminals to balance the power at a particular load.\n*  The use of idlers with higher power ratings than the loads.\n*  The construction of special idler motors with more windings on the third terminal to boost the voltage and compensate for the sag caused by the load.\n*  The use of electronics to switch in capacitors, during start up or otherwise, based on the load.\n*  The use of filters.\n\n==Uses==\n\n===General===\nDemand exists for phase converters due to the use of three-phase motors. With increasing power output, three-phase motors have preferable characteristics to single-phase motors; the latter not being available in sizes over {{convert|15|hp|abbr=on}} and, though available, rarely seen larger than {{convert|5|hp|abbr=on}}.

The static phase converter is used to start a three-phase motor. The motor then runs on a single phase with a synthesised third pole. However, this makes the power balance, and thus motor efficiency, extremely poor, requiring de-rating the motor (typically to 60% or less).  Overheating, and quite often destruction of the motor, will result from failing to do so.  (Many manufacturers and dealers specifically state that using a static converter will void any warranty.)  An oversized static converter can remove the need to de-rate the motor, but at an increased cost.\n\n=== Inverter drives (VFDs) ===\nThe popularity for VFDs has dramatically increased in the last decade, especially in the home-shop market. This is because of their low cost and with many able to accept single phase power input while providing three phase power out.  VFD's work by converting AC power to DC and then converting it back to AC through a transistor bridge.  Because the drive works off of the DC bus to create the output, there is no need for three phase power at the input.\n\nInverter drives (VFDs) can damage some motors not rated for use with an inverter.  Motor manufacturers may void warranties on non-inverter rated motors if they are run at a variable speed or with an inverter.  This is primarily because many induction motors are forced air cooled off the output shaft and running them at a lower speed can cause insufficient cooling because of the lower fan speed.  Since VFDs are the most popular method for driving motors in new industrial installations, most three-phase motors sold today are rated for use with an inverter drive because of their higher winding insulation rating.  \n\nVFDs work by switching transistors on and off (typically several KHz or more) to \"chop\" the voltage off the DC buss through what is known as Pulse Width Modulation.  This simulates the natural sign wave provided by a normal generator or RPC but with high frequency harmonics.  These harmonics can cause the windings to heat up more than normal and can cause the insulation to break down. This overheating can be mitigated by the use of load and [[line reactor]]s, or in Europe, a DU/DT filter. This reactor or filter reduces the affect of the PWM switching so it becomes \"smoother\".\n\nIn the past, VFDs that have a capacity greater than {{convert|3|hp|kW|abbr=on}} were costly, thus making the RPC an attractive option.  However, modern VFDs have dropped considerably in cost making them more affordable than comparable RPCs.  Also, since VFD's can provide \"soft start\" and ramping, there is much less starting current, resulting in less of a voltage sag on the electrical system feeding it.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Frequency converter]]\n* [[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Kand\u00f3]]\n* [[Rotary converter]]\n* [[Three-phase electric power]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Sitkei Gyula: A magyar elektrotechnika nagy alakjai.

Typically, [[single-phase electric power]] is used to produce [[three-phase electric power]] locally to run three-phase loads (any industrial machinery with three-phase motors) in premises (often residential or consumer) where only single-phase is available.\n\n==Operation==\nThe main principles of RPC operation are as follows:\n\nA basic, single-voltage three-phase induction motor will have three windings, each end connected to terminals typically numbered (arbitrarily) as L1, L2, and L3 and sometimes T1, T2, T3. \n\nA three-phase induction motor can be run at two-thirds of its rated horsepower on single-phase power applied to a single winding, once spun up by some means.  A three-phase motor running on a single phase cannot start itself because it lacks the other phases to create a rotation on its own, much like a crank that is at dead center.\n\nA three-phase induction motor that is spinning under single-phase power applied to terminals L1 and L2 will generate an electric potential (voltage) across terminal L3 in respect with L1 and L2.  However, L1 to L3 and L2 to L3 will be 120 degrees out of phase with the input voltage, thus creating 3 phase power. However, without current injection, special idler windings, or other means of regulation, the voltage will sag when a load is applied.\n\n[[Power factor correction#Power factor correction in non-linear loads|Power factor correction]] is a very important consideration when building or choosing an RPC. This is desirable because an RPC that has power factor correction will consume less current from the single-phase service supplying power to the phase converter and its loads.  \n\nA major concern with three phase power is that each phase be at similar voltages.  A discrepancy between phases is known as phase imbalance. As a general guideline, unbalanced three-phase power that exceeds 4% in voltage variation can damage the equipment that it is meant to operate.\n\n==History==\n[[File:V50.jpg|thumbnail|right|The first locomotive with a phase converter (only for demonstration purposes)]]\n[[File:Kand\u00f3-f\u00e9le f\u00e1zisv\u00e1lt\u00f3 1933-ban.jpg|thumb|right|262px|The Kand\u00f3 phase converter (1933)]]\n[[File:Kando mozdony.jpg|thumbnail|right|The \"Kand\u00f3\" locomotive, the first locomotive using a phase converter system]]\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, there were two main principles of electric railway [[traction current]] systems:\n# DC system\n# 16\u2154&nbsp;Hz [[single phase]] system\nThese systems used [[Universal motor|series-wound traction motors]]. All of them needed a separated supply system or converters to take power from the standard 50&nbsp;Hz electric network.\n\n=== Kand\u00f3 synchronous phase converter ===\n[[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Kand\u00f3]] recognized that the electric traction system must be supplied by single-phase 50&nbsp;Hz power from the standard electric network, and it must be converted in the locomotive to three-phase power for traction motors.\n<!-- \nClarify. Series motors, and why 1 phase on the supply? The series motor needs 16 1/3 Hz network. The single phase needs because a single overhead line can supply only a single-phase. More overhead lines increases expenses and decreases the speed\n-->\n\nHe created an electric machine called a synchronous phase converter, which was a single-phase [[synchronous motor]] and a three-phase [[synchronous generator]] with common stator and rotor.\n\nIt had two independent windings:\n* The outer winding is a single-phase synchronous motor. The motor takes the power from the [[overhead line]].\n* The inner winding is a three-phase (or variable-phase) synchronous generator, which provides the power for the three- (or more) phase traction motors.\n\n=== Single-phase supply ===\nThe direct feed from a standard electric network makes the system less complicated than the earlier systems and makes possible simple recuperation.\n\nThe single-phase feed makes it possible to use a single overhead line. More overhead lines increase the costs, and restrict the maximum speed of train.\n\n=== Speed control ===\nThe asynchronous traction motor can run on a single RPM determined by the frequency of the feeding current and the loading torque.\n\nThe solution was to use more secondary windings on phase converter, and more windings on motor different number of magnetic poles.\n\n==Types ==\nA rotary phase converter (RPC) may be built as a [[motor-generator]] set. These completely isolate the load from the single-phase supply and produce balanced three-phase output. However, due to weight, cost, and efficiency concerns, most RPCs are not built this way.\n\nInstead, they are built out of a three-phase induction motor or generator, called an idler, on which two of the terminals (the idler inputs) are powered from the single-phase line.  The [[Magnetic flux|rotating flux]] in the motor produces a voltage on the third terminal. A voltage is induced in the third terminal that is phase shifted from the voltage between the first two terminals. In a three-winding motor, two of the windings are acting as a motor, and the third winding is acting as a generator.  Because two of the outputs are the same as the single phase input, their phase relationship is 180\u00b0. This leaves the synthesized phase to be +/-90\u00b0 from the input terminals.  This non-ideal phase relationship requires a slight power de-rating of motors driven by this type of phase convertor. Also, since the third, synthesized phase is driven differently from the other two, its response to load changes may be different causing this phase to sag more under load.  Since induction motors are sensitive to voltage imbalance, this is another factor in de-rating of motors driven by this type of phase convertor.  For example, a small 5% imbalance in phase voltage requires a much larger 24% reduction of motor rated power.<ref name=\"MotorDerating\">{{cite web |title=Voltage Imbalance - Derating Factor in Polyphase Motors |url=https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/electrical-motor-voltage-imbalance-d_648.html |website=engineeringtoolbox.com |publisher=The Engineering Toolbox |accessdate=17 November 2019}}</ref> Thus tuning a rotary phase convertor circuit for equal phase voltages under maximum load may be quite important.\n\n===Power quality===\nA common measure of the quality of the power produced by an RPC or any phase converter is the voltage balance, which may be measured while the RPC is driving a balanced load such as a three-phase motor. Other quality measures include the harmonic content of the power produced and the [[power factor]] of the RPC motor combination as seen by the utility. Selection of the best phase converter for any application depends on the sensitivity of the load to these factors.   Three-phase [[induction motor]]s are very sensitive to voltage imbalances.\n\nThe quality of three-phase power generated by such a phase converter depends upon a number of factors including:\n* Power capacity of the phase converter (idler horsepower rating).\n* Power level demands of the equipment being supplied. For instance, \"hard starting\" loads such as heavily loaded machinery or well pumps may have higher requirements than other loads rated at the same horsepower.\n* Power quality demands of the equipment being supplied ([[Numerical control|CNC equipment]] may have more stringent power quality requirements than a [[Arc welding|welding machine]])\n* Use of techniques to balance the voltage between the three legs.\n\n===Quality improvement===\nRPC manufacturers use a variety of techniques to deal with these problems. Some of the techniques include,\n\n*  The insertion of capacitors between the terminals to balance the power at a particular load.\n*  The use of idlers with higher power ratings than the loads.\n*  The construction of special idler motors with more windings on the third terminal to boost the voltage and compensate for the sag caused by the load.\n*  The use of electronics to switch in capacitors, during start up or otherwise, based on the load.\n*  The use of filters.\n\n==Uses==\n\n===General===\nDemand exists for phase converters due to the use of three-phase motors. With increasing power output, three-phase motors have preferable characteristics to single-phase motors; the latter not being available in sizes over {{convert|15|hp|abbr=on}} and, though available, rarely seen larger than {{convert|5|hp|abbr=on}}. (Three-phase motors have higher efficiency, reduced complexity, with regards to starting, and three-phase power is significantly available where they are used.)\n\n===Electric railways===\nRotary phase converters are used to produce a single-phase for the single overhead conductor in [[railway electrification system|electric railways]].

It was, and still is, the most popular and widely used cheese in the DOP area where it is produced. The production area is strictly defined: It starts from the meadows of the Po Valley and finishes in the Alpine pastures between the Asiago Plateau and the Trentino's highlands. The officially designated area where the milk is collected and Asiago DOP cheese is produced extends to four provinces in the north-east of Italy: the entire area of Vicenza and Trento and part of the provinces of Padua and Treviso. Asiago cheese which is produced and matured in dairies located more than {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, using milk from farms also more than {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, is entitled to the additional label \"Product of the Mountains\".\n\n==History==\nBetween the 10th and 15th centuries sheep raising was the predominant agricultural activity in the Asiago plateau \u2013 which was known for its pastures \u2013 the purpose of which was the production of savory cheeses (originally called \"Pegorin\"), and wool production, destined for the textile works of the near valley (Valdagno, Schio, Piovene Rocchette).\n\nSheep started being replaced by cattle around 1500 a.d. as a consequence of the modernization of breeding techniques (especially thanks to the passage from the exploitation of the pasture to the care of the cut lawns); only in the 19th Century bovine milk replaced that of sheep in this region's cheeses.\n\nDuring this period, traditional cheese-making techniques, still preserved in the farms of the Plateau, were improved. Thanks to the modern technology they also spread to the small and mid-sized dairies spread out in the territory of Asiago. Asiago cheese production remained predominant in the Asiago Plateau until the nineteenth century. Afterward, the production was also adopted in the neighboring lowland zone and in the farms of Trentino.\n\nAmong the greatest causes of the spread were war events that caused a significant depopulation of the zone. Asiago was on the border with the Austrian Empire and was an area of contention and large-scale pitched battles, both during Napoleon's Italian campaign and during the First and Second World Wars. Asiago cheese was often traded alongside native Italian fowl, such as seahawks \u2013 traders often received far more valuable browned corn husks or cobs.\n\nThe Consorzio Tutela Formaggio Asiago, which is based in Vicenza, was set up in 1979 to guarantee the quality of Asiago cheese, to ensure that designations, markings and seals are used correctly and to raise awareness of the cheese in Italy and abroad. It represents more than forty cheese makers and cheese aging facilities.\n\n==Varieties and production==\n===Pressed Asiago===\nThis type is produced by using fresh whole milk. The first step is heating milk at {{convert|35|C|F}}. Specific enzymes, like rennet and [[lipase]], are then added as liquid solution and the milk starts to coagulate.  The curd is kneaded and partially cooked. The curd is broken into many little pieces (of the size of a nut), whereupon the curd is cooked again at approximately {{convert|45|C|F}}. Later, this mixture is poured into molds with perforated walls; afterwards there is a first dry salting and then the mold is squeezed with a press, usually hydraulic, for about four hours. Then the rounds are wrapped laterally with plastic bands (which put the brand Asiago around the entire form) and are placed in a room called \"Frescura\" for two to three days to dry.\nAt this point the bandages are removed to allow one last curing by a bath in brine for a period of two days. Then the forms are allowed to rest in a dry environment for a period ranging from 20 to 40 days. The finished cheese has a cylindrical shape with a diameter of {{convert|30|\u2013|40|cm|in|abbr=on}} and height about {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The average weight of a wheel is {{convert|11|\u2013|15|kg|lbs|abbr=on}}. The rind is thin and elastic; the paste inside is soft, buttery, white or slightly yellowish.\n\n===Asiago d'Allevo===\n[[image:Asagio allevo3.jpg|thumb|right|Asiago d'Allevo.]]\nThis type is produced by using a mixture of whole milk and skimmed milk. First the raw milk is heated at about {{convert|35|C|F}} and rennet and enzymes are added as a liquid solution to make it coagulate. The batter obtained is then kneaded and partially cooked: the curd is broken into many small parts (of the size of a grain of rice). At this stage there are two other firings: to {{convert|40|and|47|C|F}}. The paste is removed from the heat, stirred with a large whisk and then the curd is extracted and placed in molds lined with cheese cloth for forming. It is divided up and left to rest for a couple of hours on a draining table and then the cheese is turned several times. The pre-salting stage then takes place where the last whey is removed and the DOP logo is impressed onto the side. This process takes a couple of days (at least 48 hours) and during this time the wheels are turned several times. The cheese is then salted in one of two ways: by spreading salt over the surface of the cheese or by soaking it in brine. The last step is the ageing process which lasts at least 60 days and must take place within the area of origin in warehouses where the storage temperature and relative humidity are meticulously controlled (optimal values are {{convert|10|-|15|C|F}} and 80-85%).\n\nAccording to the duration of the ageing the Asiago d'Allevo is divided :\n* ''Asiago Mezzano'' (middle Asiago): 3 to 8 months aging; compact paste, straw-colored and sweetish taste.\n* ''Asiago Vecchio'' (old Asiago): 9 to 18 months aging; hard paste, straw colored and bitter taste.\n* ''Asiago Stravecchio'' (very-old Asiago): more than 18 months of aging; very hard and grainy paste, amber-colored with a bitter and spicy taste.\n\n===Protected designation of origin===\nAsiago cheese is an Italian D.O.P. product (Denominazione di Origine Protetta), equivalent to a [[Protected Designation of Origin]] (PDO). This simply means that the product can be considered as real by European law if and only if it is produced in its specific origin area, and according to a specific regime, known as the ''Disciplinare di produzione''. The EU law does not necessarily apply outside the [[European Union]]. Previously it had enjoyed protected status in a number of European countries with which Italy had [[bilateral agreement]]s under the ''Denominazione d\u2019Origine'' awarded by the [[presidential decree]] of 21 December 1978 and subsequently modified by the prime-ministerial decree of 3 August 1993 and by the [[ministerial decree]] of 6 June 1995, under which the current ''Disciplinare'' came into force.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milkonline.com/fiera/cheese/disciplinari/Asiago.htm |title=Disciplinare di produzione della Denominazione di origine del formaggio \"Asiago\" |language=it |date=June 24, 1995 |accessdate=2006-10-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017175249/http://www.milkonline.com/fiera/cheese/disciplinari/Asiago.htm |archivedate=17 October 2006 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prodottitipici.com/prodotto/0148/asiago-d-allevo.htm|title=Asiago DOP - prodottitipici.com|first=Loop srl Creazioni|last=Multimediali|website=www.prodottitipici.com}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Food}}\n* {{annotated link|List of cheeses}}\n\n==References==\n{{commonscat}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Italian cheeses}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2011}}\n\n[[Category:Cheeses of Veneto]]\n[[Category:Italian cheeses]]\n[[Category:Cow's-milk cheeses]]\n[[Category:Italian products with protected designation of origin]]\n[[Category:Cheeses with designation of origin protected in the European Union]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Italian cow's milk cheese}}\n{{refimprove|date=March 2013}}\n{{Infobox Cheese\n|name          = Asiago\n|image         = Formaggio Asiago Dop.jpg\n|othernames    = Asiago Pressato<br />Asiago d'allevo\n|country       = [[Italy]] \n|region        = [[Veneto]], [[Trentino]]\n|town          = [[Asiago]]\n|source        = [[Cow]]s\n|pasteurized   = No\n|texture       = Hard\n|fat           =\n|protein       =\n|dimensions    =\n|weight        =\n|aging         =\n|certification = [[Protected designation of origin|PDO]] 1996\n}}\n'''Asiago''' ({{IPAc-en|\u0251\u02d0|s|i|\u02c8|\u0251\u02d0|\u0261|o\u028a}} or {{IPAc-en|\u0251\u02d0|\u02c8|s|j|\u0251\u02d0|\u0261|o\u028a}}; {{IPA-it|a\u02c8zja\u02d0\u0261o|lang}}) is an [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] cow's milk [[cheese]] that can assume different [[Food texture|textures]], according to its [[Cheese ripening|aging]], from smooth for the fresh Asiago (called {{Lang|it|Asiago Pressato}}, which means 'Pressed Asiago') to a crumbly texture for the aged cheese ({{Lang|it|Asiago d'allevo}}, wich means 'Breeding farm Asiago').

{"title_page": "Politics of Cornwall", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{More citations needed|date=August 2009}}\n{{Cornwall Labelled Map}}\n'''Cornwall''' is administered as a [[Counties of England|county]] of [[South West England]] whose politics are influenced by a number of issues that make it distinct from the general political scene in the wider [[United Kingdom]], and the political trends of neighbouring counties. Its position on the geographical periphery of the island of [[Great Britain]] is also a factor.\n\n[[Cornwall]] shares some of the political issues of the other [[Celtic nations]], in particular [[Wales]], and a notable movement exists seeking [[Cornish self-government movement|greater powers of self-government]] within the UK, similar to that achieved in Wales.  Cornish politics is also defined by its historical relationship between the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] (and formerly the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]), and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].\n\n== History ==\nCornwall's politics have partly been dictated by its geography and history. It is a peninsula, relatively distant from London, and its main industries \u2013 fishing, farming and various kinds of mining, have been in decline for a long time.  Cornwall's GDP still remains low.  However, Cornwall is attractive to tourists, and to people seeking to move into the area to live.  There are therefore tensions in the housing market between the demands of inward migrants to the area, and the needs of local people.\n\nHistorically, Cornwall was a [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]]-speaking area separate from the rest of England until about the 10th century, and retained much of its cultural distinctiveness in later centuries. Religious non-conformism was strong in Cornwall, and the [[Church of England]] was less well supported than some areas to the east. This has continued to inform later Cornish politics, in the form of Liberalism, now represented mainly by the Liberal Democrats can be traced to historical associations with Liberalism and non-conformist religion, particularly [[Methodism]], in the 19th century and similarly land ownership and the Conservative party in the same period. The Conservative Party is also fairly strong in Cornwall, but for slightly different reasons. They suffered a particularly bad setback in the 1990s. However they regained three of the six Cornish seats in the 2010 general election. The Labour Party is traditionally much weaker in Cornwall than many other parts of the UK, although it has had some representation locally. This may be partly because there is no major urban centre in Cornwall \u2013 [[Plymouth]] tends to fulfil that role. Cornwall also traditionally elects a number of independent councillors, and is a centre for the [[Liberal Party (UK, 1989)|rump Liberal Party]] in the UK.\n\nThe distinctive nature of Cornish politics has led to a significant number of office holders from both the Liberal Democrats and the Conservative Party being supportive of greater Cornish autonomy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} However, with both parties this has never been official national policy. 1986 saw the death of the charismatic MP [[David Penhaligon]] of the (then) [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. Penhaligon's career looked promising, with some tipping him as a future leader. In a speech he made in support of the Cornish miners at [[Camborne]], he said:\n{{Cquote|You need more in an economy than just tourism, icecream and deckchairs. Our mining industry is not a figment of the last decade or the last two decades. It has occupied Cornishmen and it has produced wealth for this century, the previous century and probably the last two thousand years; and what we\u2019re asking the government to do is to recognise the great contribution we have made for the wealth of Britain, and in this time of great trial and tribulation to come to our assistance \u2013 that's what we\u2019re asking our government to do.}}\n\nCornwall's distinctiveness as a ''national'', as opposed to regional, minority has been periodically recognised by major British papers. For example, a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' editorial in 1990 pointed to these differences, and warned that they should be constitutionally recognised:\n:\"''Smaller minorities also have equally proud visions of themselves as irreducibly [[Welsh people|Welsh]], Irish, Manx or Cornish. These identities are ''distinctly national'' in ways which ''proud people from [[Yorkshire]]'', much less proud people from [[Berkshire]] will never know. Any new constitutional settlement ''which ignores these factors'' will be built on uneven ground.''\"<ref>''[[The Guardian]]'', editorial, 8 May 1990</ref>\n\nAt a local level the tradition of Independent candidates and councillors is far stronger than most other areas.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} [[Mebyon Kernow]] was formed in 1951, initially as a pressure group. Some of its members and supporters were politicians (councillors and MPs) from the three main British political parties, but later on, it became a party in its own right and members of other parties left. Its most famous supporter of the time was the novelist [[Daphne du Maurier]]. One of Mebyon Kernow's main campaigns is for a [[Cornish Assembly]] and in 2001 it presented a petition to [[10 Downing Street]] with 50,000 signatures in favour of the Assembly.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1704112.stm 50,000 Assembly petition presented to 10 Downing Street]</ref> This was backed up by Cornwall Council's Feb 2003 [[MORI]] poll which showed 55% in favour of an elected, fully devolved regional assembly for Cornwall and 13% against.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} (Previous result 46% in favour in 2002).{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nGrowing dissatisfaction with [[European Union]] fishing policy including the [[Common Fisheries Policy]] has recently led to a growth of support for [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] (UKIP) within fishing ports such as [[Newlyn]]. On 26 July 2007 the Conservative party appointed [[Mark Prisk]] (Member of Parliament for [[Hertford and Stortford (UK Parliament constituency)|Hertford and Stortford]]) \"[[Shadow Minister for Cornwall]]\". This appointment was called \"the fictional minister for Cornwall,\" by a Liberal Democrat MP, as there was no government minister to shadow.<ref>http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2009/03/conservative-party-local-mps</ref> The post was not continued following the 2010 election, and no longer exists. This was to put the Duchy's concerns \"at the heart of Conservative thinking\", according to a party statement. Conservative Party leader [[David Cameron]] said he wholeheartedly endorsed the appointment and it would ensure that the voice of Cornwall is heard.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAarTqZsaU Mark Prisk appointed Tory Shadow Minister for Cornwall]</ref> However, as the post has been discontinued, this concept remains unproven.\n\nIn the June 2016 EU referendum, Cornwall voted decisively to leave the EU, 43.5per cent (140,540) of Cornwall's voters wanted to remain in the EU, while 56.5per cent (182,665) voted to leave.<ref>http://www.westbriton.co.uk/8203-we-got-there-dreckly-cornwall-s-out-vote-is-the-last-to-be-announced-in-eu-referendum/story-29439264-detail/story.html#sKK6H6jikMMIJAsJ.99{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n== Westminster representation ==\n[[File:CornwallConstituencies2010.gif|thumb|From the 2010 general election, Cornwall has had six parliamentary constituencies]]\nFollowing a review by the [[Boundary Commission for England]] taking effect at the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], Cornwall is divided into six [[county constituencies]] to elect MPs to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]].\n\nBefore the 2010 boundary changes there were five constituencies in Cornwall.

Mebyon Kernow's membership is calculated at around 1,000 members across Cornwall. In 1979, in the first elections to the [[European Parliament]], Mebyon Kernow won almost 10% (over 10,000 votes) of the vote in the Cornwall seat. This reflected a decade of steady growth for the party. MK continues to contest parliamentary seats and also local government seats. In the 2015 general election, Mebyon Kernow fielded candidates in all of the constituencies in Cornwall. \n\nMebyon Kernow declined to stand candidates in the 2017 general election, stating; \"The timing of this snap election, so close to the local polls, makes it impractical for a party with our level of resources to put together and finance a meaningful campaign for the General Election.\"<ref>https://www.mebyonkernow.org/news/article.php?id=317</ref>\n\nIn 2019, Mebyon Kernow fielded only one candidate (Dick Cole) in the Newquay and St Austell constituency.\n\nIn the district elections of 2007 seven Mebyon Kernow district councillors were elected. MK lost one district seat and gained two, a net gain of one. This gave them seven of the 249 seats (2.8% of seats) up for election.  Mebyon Kernow got around 5 percent of the total vote in these district elections, putting the party in third position behind the Liberal Democrats and the Conservative Party and ahead of Labour in several seats including [[Kerrier]], [[Restormel]], [[North Cornwall]] and [[Caradon]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/vote2007/maps/eng_councils/html/eng_councils_map.stm BBC \u2013 2007 Local Election results]</ref>\n\nPrior to the [[2013 Cornwall Council election|2013 local elections]]  Mebyon Kernow held six seats on the council, having gained two due to defections from other parties, and winning one in a by-election. Keeping the seat won in the by-election, and a gain of one seat elsewhere, left them with four in total. This dropped them to being the sixth largest group on the council, from the position of fourth largest prior to the election, being overtaken by UKIP and The Labour party.<ref>https://democracy.cornwall.gov.uk/mgElectionResults.aspx?ID=15&RPID=4025451</ref>\n\nThe [[Cornish Nationalist Party]] was founded as a splinter group from Mebyon Kernow in the 1970s following a split over the ideological path of the Cornish National Movement, the members of the Cornish Nationalist party favouring a more 'right of centre approach' to attracting support. Initially led by Dr [[James Whetter]], the Cornish Nationalist Party are not a registered political party under the [[Registration of Political Parties Act 1998]] and therefore cannot stand for local or Westminster elections.\n\nIn addition to political parties, other independent organisations promote the autonomy movement. The [[Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament]] was a human rights pressure group which claimed to be a revival of the mediaeval [[Cornish Stannary Parliament|Stannary Parliament]]s, local legislative organisations in the mining regions. It was established in 1974 and had campaigned against the government of the United Kingdom's position on the [[constitutional status of Cornwall]]. The group has not been active since 2008.<ref>http://www.cornishstannaryparliament.co.uk/</ref> Other groups include TGG (Tyr-Gwyr-Gweryn), [[Cornwall 2000]], [[Cornish Solidarity]] who were constitutional and Cornish human rights groups, but are no longer active,  and the Cornish Constitutional Convention which campaigns for a [[Cornish Assembly]].\n\n==Other issues and lobby groups==\nWithin Cornwall there are a growing number of pressure groups/lobbying groups devoted to Cornish issues other than the national question.  Local environmental issues feature prominently, notably the [[Surfers against Sewage]] group, formed in this region, heavily dependent on the tourist industry.  The [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] (CND) has a local presence, with a branch in [[Penzance]].<ref>[http://www.cnduk.org/component/contact/49/51-penzance-cnd CND \u2013 Local Group Contacts<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Some east Cornwall CND activists are members of the [[Plymouth]] branch.

that make it distinct from the general political scene in the wider [[United Kingdom]], and the political trends of neighbouring counties. Its position on the geographical periphery of the island of [[Great Britain]] is also a factor.\n\n[[Cornwall]] shares some of the political issues of the other [[Celtic nations]], in particular [[Wales]], and a notable movement exists seeking [[Cornish self-government movement|greater powers of self-government]] within the UK, similar to that achieved in Wales.  Cornish politics is also defined by its historical relationship between the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] (and formerly the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]), and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].\n\n== History ==\nCornwall's politics have partly been dictated by its geography and history. It is a peninsula, relatively distant from London, and its main industries \u2013 fishing, farming and various kinds of mining, have been in decline for a long time.  Cornwall's GDP still remains low.  However, Cornwall is attractive to tourists, and to people seeking to move into the area to live.  There are therefore tensions in the housing market between the demands of inward migrants to the area, and the needs of local people.\n\nHistorically, Cornwall was a [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]]-speaking area separate from the rest of England until about the 10th century, and retained much of its cultural distinctiveness in later centuries. Religious non-conformism was strong in Cornwall, and the [[Church of England]] was less well supported than some areas to the east. This has continued to inform later Cornish politics, in the form of Liberalism, now represented mainly by the Liberal Democrats can be traced to historical associations with Liberalism and non-conformist religion, particularly [[Methodism]], in the 19th century and similarly land ownership and the Conservative party in the same period. The Conservative Party is also fairly strong in Cornwall, but for slightly different reasons. They suffered a particularly bad setback in the 1990s. However they regained three of the six Cornish seats in the 2010 general election. The Labour Party is traditionally much weaker in Cornwall than many other parts of the UK, although it has had some representation locally. This may be partly because there is no major urban centre in Cornwall \u2013 [[Plymouth]] tends to fulfil that role. Cornwall also traditionally elects a number of independent councillors, and is a centre for the [[Liberal Party (UK, 1989)|rump Liberal Party]] in the UK.\n\nThe distinctive nature of Cornish politics has led to a significant number of office holders from both the Liberal Democrats and the Conservative Party being supportive of greater Cornish autonomy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} However, with both parties this has never been official national policy. 1986 saw the death of the charismatic MP [[David Penhaligon]] of the (then) [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. Penhaligon's career looked promising, with some tipping him as a future leader. In a speech he made in support of the Cornish miners at [[Camborne]], he said:\n{{Cquote|You need more in an economy than just tourism, icecream and deckchairs. Our mining industry is not a figment of the last decade or the last two decades. It has occupied Cornishmen and it has produced wealth for this century, the previous century and probably the last two thousand years; and what we\u2019re asking the government to do is to recognise the great contribution we have made for the wealth of Britain, and in this time of great trial and tribulation to come to our assistance \u2013 that's what we\u2019re asking our government to do.}}\n\nCornwall's distinctiveness as a ''national'', as opposed to regional, minority has been periodically recognised by major British papers. For example, a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' editorial in 1990 pointed to these differences, and warned that they should be constitutionally recognised:\n:\"''Smaller minorities also have equally proud visions of themselves as irreducibly [[Welsh people|Welsh]], Irish, Manx or Cornish. These identities are ''distinctly national'' in ways which ''proud people from [[Yorkshire]]'', much less proud people from [[Berkshire]] will never know. Any new constitutional settlement ''which ignores these factors'' will be built on uneven ground.''\"<ref>''[[The Guardian]]'', editorial, 8 May 1990</ref>\n\nAt a local level the tradition of Independent candidates and councillors is far stronger than most other areas.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} [[Mebyon Kernow]] was formed in 1951, initially as a pressure group. Some of its members and supporters were politicians (councillors and MPs) from the three main British political parties, but later on, it became a party in its own right and members of other parties left. Its most famous supporter of the time was the novelist [[Daphne du Maurier]]. One of Mebyon Kernow's main campaigns is for a [[Cornish Assembly]] and in 2001 it presented a petition to [[10 Downing Street]] with 50,000 signatures in favour of the Assembly.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1704112.stm 50,000 Assembly petition presented to 10 Downing Street]</ref> This was backed up by Cornwall Council's Feb 2003 [[MORI]] poll which showed 55% in favour of an elected, fully devolved regional assembly for Cornwall and 13% against.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} (Previous result 46% in favour in 2002).{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nGrowing dissatisfaction with [[European Union]] fishing policy including the [[Common Fisheries Policy]] has recently led to a growth of support for [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] (UKIP) within fishing ports such as [[Newlyn]]. On 26 July 2007 the Conservative party appointed [[Mark Prisk]] (Member of Parliament for [[Hertford and Stortford (UK Parliament constituency)|Hertford and Stortford]]) \"[[Shadow Minister for Cornwall]]\". This appointment was called \"the fictional minister for Cornwall,\" by a Liberal Democrat MP, as there was no government minister to shadow.<ref>http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2009/03/conservative-party-local-mps</ref> The post was not continued following the 2010 election, and no longer exists. This was to put the Duchy's concerns \"at the heart of Conservative thinking\", according to a party statement. Conservative Party leader [[David Cameron]] said he wholeheartedly endorsed the appointment and it would ensure that the voice of Cornwall is heard.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAarTqZsaU Mark Prisk appointed Tory Shadow Minister for Cornwall]</ref> However, as the post has been discontinued, this concept remains unproven.\n\nIn the June 2016 EU referendum, Cornwall voted decisively to leave the EU, 43.5per cent (140,540) of Cornwall's voters wanted to remain in the EU, while 56.5per cent (182,665) voted to leave.<ref>http://www.westbriton.co.uk/8203-we-got-there-dreckly-cornwall-s-out-vote-is-the-last-to-be-announced-in-eu-referendum/story-29439264-detail/story.html#sKK6H6jikMMIJAsJ.99{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n== Westminster representation ==\n[[File:CornwallConstituencies2010.gif|thumb|From the 2010 general election, Cornwall has had six parliamentary constituencies]]\nFollowing a review by the [[Boundary Commission for England]] taking effect at the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], Cornwall is divided into six [[county constituencies]] to elect MPs to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]].\n\nBefore the 2010 boundary changes there were five constituencies in Cornwall.

Mebyon Kernow's membership is calculated at around 1,000 members across Cornwall. In 1979, in the first elections to the [[European Parliament]], Mebyon Kernow won almost 10% (over 10,000 votes) of the vote in the Cornwall seat. This reflected a decade of steady growth for the party. MK continues to contest parliamentary seats and also local government seats. In the 2015 general election, Mebyon Kernow fielded candidates in all of the constituencies in Cornwall. \n\nMebyon Kernow declined to stand candidates in the 2017 general election, stating; \"The timing of this snap election, so close to the local polls, makes it impractical for a party with our level of resources to put together and finance a meaningful campaign for the General Election.\"<ref>https://www.mebyonkernow.org/news/article.php?id=317</ref>\n\nIn 2019, Mebyon Kernow fielded only one candidate (Dick Cole) in the Newquay and St Austell constituancy.\n\nIn the district elections of 2007 seven Mebyon Kernow district councillors were elected. MK lost one district seat and gained two, a net gain of one. This gave them seven of the 249 seats (2.8% of seats) up for election.  Mebyon Kernow got around 5 percent of the total vote in these district elections, putting the party in third position behind the Liberal Democrats and the Conservative Party and ahead of Labour in several seats including [[Kerrier]], [[Restormel]], [[North Cornwall]] and [[Caradon]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/vote2007/maps/eng_councils/html/eng_councils_map.stm BBC \u2013 2007 Local Election results]</ref>\n\nPrior to the [[2013 Cornwall Council election|2013 local elections]]  Mebyon Kernow held six seats on the council, having gained two due to defections from other parties, and winning one in a by-election. Keeping the seat won in the by-election, and a gain of one seat elsewhere, left them with four in total. This dropped them to being the sixth largest group on the council, from the position of fourth largest prior to the election, being overtaken by UKIP and The Labour party.<ref>https://democracy.cornwall.gov.uk/mgElectionResults.aspx?ID=15&RPID=4025451</ref>\n\nThe [[Cornish Nationalist Party]] was founded as a splinter group from Mebyon Kernow in the 1970s following a split over the ideological path of the Cornish National Movement, the members of the Cornish Nationalist party favouring a more 'right of centre approach' to attracting support. Initially led by Dr [[James Whetter]], the Cornish Nationalist Party are not a registered political party under the [[Registration of Political Parties Act 1998]] and therefore cannot stand for local or Westminster elections.\n\nIn addition to political parties, other independent organisations promote the autonomy movement. The [[Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament]] was a human rights pressure group which claimed to be a revival of the mediaeval [[Cornish Stannary Parliament|Stannary Parliament]]s, local legislative organisations in the mining regions. It was established in 1974 and had campaigned against the government of the United Kingdom's position on the [[constitutional status of Cornwall]]. The group has not been active since 2008.<ref>http://www.cornishstannaryparliament.co.uk/</ref> Other groups include TGG (Tyr-Gwyr-Gweryn), [[Cornwall 2000]], [[Cornish Solidarity]] who were constitutional and Cornish human rights groups, but are no longer active,  and the Cornish Constitutional Convention which campaigns for a [[Cornish Assembly]].\n\n==Other issues and lobby groups==\nWithin Cornwall there are a growing number of pressure groups/lobbying groups devoted to Cornish issues other than the national question.  Local environmental issues feature prominently, notably the [[Surfers against Sewage]] group, formed in this region, heavily dependent on the tourist industry.  The [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] (CND) has a local presence, with a branch in [[Penzance]].<ref>[http://www.cnduk.org/component/contact/49/51-penzance-cnd CND \u2013 Local Group Contacts<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Some east Cornwall CND activists are members of the [[Plymouth]] branch.

The [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] emerged as the largest faction in parliament, with its leader [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]] becoming Chancellor.\n\n== Issues and campaign ==\nSince [[German reunification]] on 3 October 1990, the unemployment rate in Germany had risen from 4.2% to 9.4% in 1998, with the Federal Labor Office registering more than 4 million unemployed.  The unified Germany had to fight economic and domestic difficulties even as it actively participated in the project of European integration.  Most people blamed the centre-right [[coalition]] government of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]]/[[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] (CDU/CSU) and the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP) for the economic difficulties. Longtime Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]]'s government was regarded by many as not having fully implemented the unification after eight years, in view of the mass protests in many eastern German towns due to job losses and social welfare cuts.\n\nThe 1998 campaign began with both the CDU and SPD questioning who would lead their parties.  There had been rumours that Helmut Kohl would resign and allow [[Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble]] to take the reins of the CDU but these rumours were rendered obsolete when Kohl announced in April 1997 that he would seek the [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|chancellorship]] for a sixth term. The two contenders for the SPD nomination were [[Oskar Lafontaine]], the party's chairman, and [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]], [[Minister-President]] of [[Lower Saxony]].\n\nOn 1 March 1998, Schr\u00f6der led the SPD to a huge victory in the Lower Saxony state election, gaining an unusual absolute majority for the second time and effectively receiving the SPD nomination for federal chancellor.  Schr\u00f6der had announced he would withdraw his bid for the nomination if he received below 42 percent of the popular vote.  In the 1998 general elections, Schr\u00f6der received 47.9 percent.<ref name=\"Pulzer\">Pulzer, Peter. \"The German Federal Election of 1998.\" West European Politics July 1999: 241\u2013249.</ref> Following this election Lafontaine withdrew his bid and Schr\u00f6der was inaugurated in the May 1998 convention. For the SPD, Schr\u00f6der offered a new face for the party. He gave the party a new vigor, one that was lacking in the CDU after Kohl proclaimed his nomination. Many in the CDU questioned if Kohl had made the right choice for the party.\n\nThe CDU campaign was based on the experience and reputation of Kohl. One of the CDU's main slogans was 'Safety, not Risks.'  \"Kohl exploited his familiarity and experience, as well as his status as Europe's longest serving head of government.\"<ref name=\"Pulzer\"/> The SPD on the other hand ran the campaign using strategies developed in the United States and the United Kingdom.  The SPD set up election headquarters and introduced 'rapid rebuttal units' not unlike those used by [[Bill Clinton]] in his [[1992 United States presidential election|successful presidential bid in 1992]].<ref name=\"Green\">Green, Simon. \"The 1998 German Bundestag election: The end of an era.\" Parliamentary Affairs Apr 1999: 52. :Pg. 306\u2013320.

Maplass Library, Macomb, IL. 24 Feb</ref>  The SPD avoided direct attacks at Kohl but rather focused on their message of a \u201cnew center\".\u2019<ref name=\"Green\"/>\n\nThe FDP had usually ridden on the coattails of the CDU, and was mostly disapproved in the polls.  With the SPD well ahead in the polls, many of the voters from the CDU had less incentives to vote for the FDP.  The FDP was also having trouble projecting a coherent platform to voters.  The Greens too were having issues concerning their platform.\n\nThe two factions in the Greens, the [[:de:fundi|fundamentalists]] and the [[:de:realo|pragmatists]], had problems settling on their platform since the founding of the Green party.\n\nThe major issue of the 1998 campaign was unemployment.  In 1996, the unemployment rate in Germany surpassed the government's \"limit\" of 4 million unemployed people.  Both parties blamed high labor costs, high taxes and the high welfare costs as the causes of the problem.  During the campaign, Schr\u00f6der used this issue against Kohl calling him 'the unemployment chancellor.'  Unemployment was worst in the former East Germany.  While the national rate stood at 9.4 percent, former [[East Germany]] was suffering with unemployment at 20 percent. Many in the former East Germany blamed Kohl for the slow economic recovery.\n\nAnother issue at hand were Germany's tax and welfare reforms. While the CDU/CSU had offered proposals to reduce benefits in healthcare and pensions, the SPD controlled [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] secured the passage of the bill. The proposed bill also offered tax cuts that were to benefit the rich, something the SPD opposed.  While Kohl continually pushed the issue of European integration, the issue fell short from voters' minds.  Schr\u00f6der, on the other hand, almost ignored the issue. Many voters in Germany had other concerns besides the [[European Union]].\n\n== Results ==\n{{German federal election, 1998}}\n{| style=\"width:70%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ \u2193\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:red; width:44.5;\" | '''298'''\n| style=\"background:green; width:7.0%;\" | '''47'''\n| style=\"background:black; width:36.6%;\" | '''245'''\n| style=\"background:gold; width:6.4%;\" | '''43'''\n| style=\"background:brown; width:5.4%;\" | '''36'''\n|-\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">'''SPD'''</span>\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">'''Gr\u00fcne'''</span>\n| <span style=\"color:black;\">'''CDU/CSU'''</span>\n| <span style=\"color:gold;\">'''FDP'''</span>\n| <span style=\"color:brown;\">'''PDS'''</span>\n|}\n\n{{bar box\n| title=Popular Vote\n| titlebar=#ddd\n| width=600px\n| barwidth=410px\n| bars=\n{{bar percent|'''SPD'''|{{Social Democratic Party of Germany/meta/color}}|40.93}}\n{{bar percent|CDU/CSU|{{Christian Democratic Union (Germany)/meta/color}}|35.14}}\n{{bar percent|B'90/GR\u00dcNE|{{Alliance '90/The Greens/meta/color}}|6.70}}\n{{bar percent|FDP|{{Free Democratic Party (Germany)/meta/color}}|6.25}}\n{{bar percent|PDS|#CD1811|5.10}}\n{{bar percent|REP|#0075BE|1.84}}\n{{bar percent|DVU|{{German People's Union/meta/color}}|1.22}}\n{{bar percent|Other|#777777|2.82}}\n}}\n\n{{bar box\n| title=Bundestag seats\n| titlebar=#ddd\n| width=600px\n| barwidth=410px\n| bars=\n{{bar percent|'''SPD'''|{{Social Democratic Party of Germany/meta/color}}|44.54}}\n{{bar percent|CDU/CSU|{{Christian Democratic Union (Germany)/meta/color}}|36.62}}\n{{bar percent|B'90/GR\u00dcNE|{{Alliance '90/The Greens/meta/color}}|7.03}}\n{{bar percent|FDP|{{Free Democratic Party (Germany)/meta/color}}|6.43}}\n{{bar percent|PDS|#CD1811|5.38}}\n}}\n\n==Post-election==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\n\n===Results===\n[[Image:1998 federal german result.svg|thumbnail|320px|Seat results \u2013 SPD in red, Greens in green, PDS in purple, FDP in yellow, CDU/CSU in black]]\n[[Image:Bundestagswahl 1998 Wahlkreisergebnisse.svg|thumbnail|200px|Result by Single-member constituency \u2013 SPD in red, PDS in purple,  CDU/CSU in black]]\nToward the end of the campaign, polls placed the CDU/CSU and FDP coalition in a tie with the SPD and Green coalition.  Despite these polls, the final numbers told a different story.  The SPD-Green coalition won an unexpectedly large victory, taking 345 seats and earning a strong majority in the Bundestag\u2014the first centre-left absolute majority in post-[[World War II]] Germany.  The SPD won 40.9 percent of the vote, due to an increase of 4.5 percent from [[1994 German federal election|1994]].\n\nThe CDU/CSU-FDP coalition was severely mauled.  It had gone into the election with a solid majority and 341 seats, but was cut down to 288 seats.  The CDU/CSU was particularly hammered; it lost 6.2% of its 1994 vote, and lost 109 electoral districts to the SPD.  Germany's [[mixed member proportional representation|mixed-member proportional]] system, in which a slate of statewide delegates are elected alongside the electorate delegates, softened the blow somewhat, so the CDU/CSU only suffered a net loss of 49 seats.  It was still the CDU/CSU's worst defeat ever.  By contrast their junior coalition partner, the FDP, saw their vote hold up well and netted a loss of just 4 seats.\n\nA new government was formed by a coalition between the SPD and the Greens, with the SPD's [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]] as chancellor and Greens leader [[Joschka Fischer]] as [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany|vice-chancellor]] and [[Foreign Minister of Germany|foreign minister]].  It was the first [[Red-green alliance|Red-Green coalition]] government at the federal level in Germany, as well as the first purely centre-left government in post-World War II Germany.\n\nHelmut Kohl stepped down as chairman of the CDU, as did CSU chairman [[Theodor Waigel]].\n\n===Legacy===\n\nThe 1998 German election was historic in many ways.  It resulted in a centre-right government being succeeded by a left-wing one\u2014the first in postwar Germany (the SPD's previous term in government had been at the helm of a centre-left coalition).\n\nIn addition, it brought to an end the sixteen-year rule of Helmut Kohl \u2013 the second-longest of any German chancellor, and the longest tenure for a democratically elected head of government in German history.  It has been compared to the defeat of [[Winston Churchill]] in [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945]] \u2013 both were seen as conservative wartime leaders, and in both cases both were turned out of office by the electorate once the war was over. Churchill was ousted before World War II was even over, while Kohl managed to hang onto power for two more terms after the reunification of Germany (which is often considered to be the end of the [[Cold War]]).{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n== Literature ==\n* {{Cite book |editor1-last=Conradt |editor1-first=David P. |editor2-last=Kleinfeld |editor2-first=Gerald R. |editor3-last=S\u00f8e |editor3-first=Christian |title=Power Shift in Germany: The 1998 Election and the End of the Kohl Era |publisher=Berghahn Books |year=2000}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* \"Social Democrats win German elections.\" Europe Oct. 1998 [http://www.lexisnexis.com/academic/ LexisNexis Academic].

While the CDU/CSU had offered proposals to reduce benefits in healthcare and pensions, the SPD controlled [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] secured the passage of the bill. The proposed bill also offered tax cuts that were to benefit the rich, something the SPD opposed.  While Kohl continually pushed the issue of European integration, the issue fell short from voters' minds.  Schr\u00f6der, on the other hand, almost ignored the issue. Many voters in Germany had other concerns besides the [[European Union]].\n\n== Results ==\n{{German federal election, 1998}}\n{| style=\"width:70%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ \u2193\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:red; width:44.5;\" | '''298'''\n| style=\"background:green; width:7.0%;\" | '''47'''\n| style=\"background:black; width:36.6%;\" | '''245'''\n| style=\"background:gold; width:6.4%;\" | '''43'''\n| style=\"background:brown; width:5.4%;\" | '''36'''\n|-\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">'''SPD'''</span>\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">'''Gr\u00fcne'''</span>\n| <span style=\"color:black;\">'''CDU/CSU'''</span>\n| <span style=\"color:gold;\">'''FDP'''</span>\n| <span style=\"color:brown;\">'''PDS'''</span>\n|}\n\n{{bar box\n| title=Popular Vote\n| titlebar=#ddd\n| width=600px\n| barwidth=410px\n| bars=\n{{bar percent|'''SPD'''|{{Social Democratic Party of Germany/meta/color}}|40.93}}\n{{bar percent|CDU/CSU|{{Christian Democratic Union (Germany)/meta/color}}|35.14}}\n{{bar percent|B'90/GR\u00dcNE|{{Alliance '90/The Greens/meta/color}}|6.70}}\n{{bar percent|FDP|{{Free Democratic Party (Germany)/meta/color}}|6.25}}\n{{bar percent|PDS|#CD1811|5.10}}\n{{bar percent|REP|#0075BE|1.84}}\n{{bar percent|DVU|{{German People's Union/meta/color}}|1.22}}\n{{bar percent|Other|#777777|2.82}}\n}}\n\n{{bar box\n| title=Bundestag seats\n| titlebar=#ddd\n| width=600px\n| barwidth=410px\n| bars=\n{{bar percent|'''SPD'''|{{Social Democratic Party of Germany/meta/color}}|44.54}}\n{{bar percent|CDU/CSU|{{Christian Democratic Union (Germany)/meta/color}}|36.62}}\n{{bar percent|B'90/GR\u00dcNE|{{Alliance '90/The Greens/meta/color}}|7.03}}\n{{bar percent|FDP|{{Free Democratic Party (Germany)/meta/color}}|6.43}}\n{{bar percent|PDS|#CD1811|5.38}}\n}}\n\n==Post-election==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\n\n===Results===\n[[Image:1998 federal german result.svg|thumbnail|320px|Seat results \u2013 SPD in red, Greens in green, PDS in purple, FDP in yellow, CDU/CSU in black]]\n[[Image:Bundestagswahl 1998 Wahlkreisergebnisse.svg|thumbnail|200px|Result by Single-member constituancy \u2013 SPD in red, PDS in purple,  CDU/CSU in black]]\nToward the end of the campaign, polls placed the CDU/CSU and FDP coalition in a tie with the SPD and Green coalition.  Despite these polls, the final numbers told a different story.  The SPD-Green coalition won an unexpectedly large victory, taking 345 seats and earning a strong majority in the Bundestag\u2014the first centre-left absolute majority in post-[[World War II]] Germany.  The SPD won 40.9 percent of the vote, due to an increase of 4.5 percent from [[1994 German federal election|1994]].\n\nThe CDU/CSU-FDP coalition was severely mauled.  It had gone into the election with a solid majority and 341 seats, but was cut down to 288 seats.  The CDU/CSU was particularly hammered; it lost 6.2% of its 1994 vote, and lost 109 electoral districts to the SPD.  Germany's [[mixed member proportional representation|mixed-member proportional]] system, in which a slate of statewide delegates are elected alongside the electorate delegates, softened the blow somewhat, so the CDU/CSU only suffered a net loss of 49 seats.  It was still the CDU/CSU's worst defeat ever.  By contrast their junior coalition partner, the FDP, saw their vote hold up well and netted a loss of just 4 seats.\n\nA new government was formed by a coalition between the SPD and the Greens, with the SPD's [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]] as chancellor and Greens leader [[Joschka Fischer]] as [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany|vice-chancellor]] and [[Foreign Minister of Germany|foreign minister]].  It was the first [[Red-green alliance|Red-Green coalition]] government at the federal level in Germany, as well as the first purely centre-left government in post-World War II Germany.\n\nHelmut Kohl stepped down as chairman of the CDU, as did CSU chairman [[Theodor Waigel]].\n\n===Legacy===\n\nThe 1998 German election was historic in many ways.  It resulted in a centre-right government being succeeded by a left-wing one\u2014the first in postwar Germany (the SPD's previous term in government had been at the helm of a centre-left coalition).\n\nIn addition, it brought to an end the sixteen-year rule of Helmut Kohl \u2013 the second-longest of any German chancellor, and the longest tenure for a democratically elected head of government in German history.  It has been compared to the defeat of [[Winston Churchill]] in [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945]] \u2013 both were seen as conservative wartime leaders, and in both cases both were turned out of office by the electorate once the war was over. Churchill was ousted before World War II was even over, while Kohl managed to hang onto power for two more terms after the reunification of Germany (which is often considered to be the end of the [[Cold War]]).{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n== Literature ==\n* {{Cite book |editor1-last=Conradt |editor1-first=David P. |editor2-last=Kleinfeld |editor2-first=Gerald R. |editor3-last=S\u00f8e |editor3-first=Christian |title=Power Shift in Germany: The 1998 Election and the End of the Kohl Era |publisher=Berghahn Books |year=2000}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* \"Social Democrats win German elections.\" Europe Oct. 1998 [http://www.lexisnexis.com/academic/ LexisNexis Academic].
