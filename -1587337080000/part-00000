The song garnered similar chart success in Canada, peaking at number four on the [[Canada Country|Country]] chart and number 67 on the [[Canadian Hot 100]].\n\nThe accompanying music video for the song was directed by [[Peter Zavadil]] and is a sequel to Moore's previous single \"[[Point at You]]\", with Jessica Ahlberg reprising her role as his girlfriend and going out in the town at night.\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe song received a favorable review from ''[[Taste of Country]]'', which said that \"the specifics are what set the song apart from others that borrow from the same spice rack of country song cooking.\" It concluded that \"the singer isn\u2019t veering from a course that\u2019s clearly working for him.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Justin Moore, \u2018Lettin\u2019 the Night Roll\u2019 [Listen]|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/justin-moore-lettin-the-night-roll/|accessdate=November 26, 2013|newspaper=Taste of Country|date=October 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe music video was directed by [[Peter Zavadil]] and premiered in December 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/videos/justin-moore/983485/lettin-the-night-roll.jhtml|title=CMT : Videos : Justin Moore : Lettin' the Night Roll|publisher=[[Country Music Television]]|accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref> The video is a sequel to the music video of Moore's song \"Point at You,\" and begins where the previous video ends (with a police chase) Jesica Ahlberg, who played Moore's girlfriend in the \"Point at You\" video, reprises her role in this video.

Due to the makeup of the Jewish community in the US, most of the prayer books are geared to the [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazic]] custom. In more recent years, Artscroll has collaborated with Sephardic community leaders in an attempt to bridge this gap. Examples of this include a Sephardic [[Haggadah]] published by Artscroll, written by Sephardic Rabbi Eli Mansour, and the book ''[[Aleppo]]'', about a prominent [[Sephardic Jews|Sephardic]] community in [[Syria]].<ref>{{cite book\n   |title=Through the flames of Aleppo: A novel (ArtScroll youth series)\n   |url=https://www.amazon.com/Through-flames-Aleppo-novel-ArtScroll/dp/1578195381\n   |isbn=1578195381}}</ref>\n\nIn translations and commentaries, ArtScroll accepts [[midrash]]ic accounts in a historical fashion, and at times literally; it disagrees with [[textual criticism]]. Page \"X\" of the preface to Artscroll's first publication set the tone: A long paragraph includes \"''No non-Jewish sources have even been consulted, much less quoted.'' I consider it offensive that the Torah should need authentication from the secular or so-called 'scientific' sources.\"<ref>The first of these sentences was the end of a series of ''italicized'' sentences.</ref><ref>{{cite newspaper  |newspaper=[[The Jewish Press]]\n   |url=https://www.jewishpress.com/indepth/interviews-and-profiles/meir-zlotowitzs-legacy-the-spiritual-engine-of-american-orthodoxys-renaissance/2018/07/18\n   |date=July 18, 2018  |accessdate=January 10, 2019\n   |title=Meir Zlotowitz\u2019s Legacy: The Spiritual Engine Of American Orthodoxy\u2019s Renaissance\n   |author=Yaakov Kornreich}}</ref>\n\nFrequently coalescing to give voice to ArtScroll's worldview is, in the words of Rabbi Nosson Scherman, \"a heavy combination of ''[[Musar literature|mussar]]'' and ''[[Hasidic philosophy|chassidus]]'' that we incorporate into our commentary\" such as commentary by [[Hasidic]] Rabbis [[Zadok HaKohen|Tzadok HaKohen]] and [[Yehudah Aryeh Leib Alter|Yehudah Leib Alter]].<ref>[https://jewishaction.com/cover-story/the-case-for-a-traditional-approach-in-the-study-of-tanach/ The Case for a Traditional Approach in the Study of Tanach] in the Jewish Action Winter 2018 issue</ref>\n\n==Schottenstein Edition Talmud==\n{{Main|Schottenstein Edition of the Babylonian Talmud}}\nMesorah has a line of [[Mishnah]] translations and commentaries, and a line of [[Babylonian Talmud]] translations and commentaries, The Schottenstein Edition of The ''Talmud Bavli'' (\"Babylonian Talmud\"). The set of Talmud was completed in late 2004, giving a 73 volume English edition of the entire Talmud. This was the second complete translation of the Talmud into English (the other being the [[Soncino Press|Soncino]] Talmud published in the United Kingdom during the mid-twentieth century).\n\nThe first volume, Tractate Makkos, was published in 1990,<ref name=\"ny\"/> and dedicated by Mr. and Mrs. Marcos Katz. [[Jerome Schottenstein]] was introduced by Dr. Norman Lamm to the publication committee shortly thereafter. He began by donating funds for the project in memory of his parents Ephraim and Anna Schottenstein one volume at a time, and later decided to back the entire project. When Jerome died, his children and widow, Geraldine, rededicated the project to his memory in addition to those of his parents. The goal of the project was to, \"open the doors of the Talmud and welcome its people inside.\"\n\nThe text generally consists of two side-by-side pages: one of the [[Jewish Babylonian Aramaic|Aramaic]]/[[Mishnaic Hebrew|Hebrew]] [[Vilna Edition]] text, and the corresponding page consists of an English translation. The English translation has a bolded literal translation of the Talmud's text, but also includes un-bolded text clarifying the literal translation. (The original Talmud's text is often very unclear, referring to places, times, people, and laws that it does not explain. The un-bolded text attempts to explain these situations. The text of the Talmud also contains few prepositions, articles, etc. The un-bolded text takes the liberty of inserting these parts of speech.) The result is an English text that reads in full sentences with full explanations, while allowing the reader to distinguish between direct translation and a more liberal approach to the translation. (This also results in one page of the Vilna Talmud requiring several pages of English translation.) Below the English translation appear extensive notes including diagrams.<ref name=\"ny\"/>\n\nArtScroll's English explanations and footnoted commentary in the Schottenstein Edition of the Talmud are based on the perspective of classical Jewish sources. The clarifying explanation is generally based on the viewpoint of [[Rashi]], the medieval commentator who wrote the first comprehensive commentary on the Talmud. The Schottenstein Edition does not include contemporary academic or critical scholarship.  The overall guidelines follow a pattern defined by the late Rabbi Hersh Goldwurm, \"a Monsey, N.Y., scholar who died in 1993.\"<ref name=\"ny\"/>\n\nThe total cost of the project is estimated at US$21 million,<ref name=\"ny\"/> most of which was contributed by private donors and foundations. Some volumes have up to 2 million copies in distribution, while more recent volumes have only 90,000 copies currently printed.

Stone|Stone Editions]] of Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) and [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] (Pentateuch) use many more transliterated Hebrew words than English words, compared to editions such as the [[Tanakh]] of the [[Jewish Publication Society]]. This reflects a higher use of untranslated Hebrew terminology in Haredi English usage.\n\nArtScroll's transliteration system for [[Hebrew transliteration]] for readers of the English language generally uses [[Ashkenazi Hebrew|Ashkenazi]] consonants and [[Sephardi Hebrew|Sefardi]] vowels. The two major differences between the way Sefardi and Ashkenazi Hebrew dialects are transcribed are as follows:\n*the letter [[Taw (letter)|Tav]] without a [[dagesh]] (emphasis point) is transcribed as [t] and [s] respectively\n**ArtScroll uses the latter\n*the vowel [[niqqud|kamatz gadol]], is transcribed [a] and [o] respectively\n**ArtScroll uses the former\n\nAs such, the following transliterations are used:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Ashkenazi\n!Sefardi\n!ArtScroll\n|-\n|Boruch\n|Barukh\n|Baruch\n|-\n|Shabbos\n|Shabbat\n|Shabbos (<small>ArtScroll makes an exception due to widespread usage</small>)\n|-\n|Succos\n|Succot\n|Succos\n|-\n|Avrohom\n|Avraham\n|Avraham\n|-\n|Akeidas Yitzchok\n|Akedat Yitzhak\n|Akeidas Yitzchak\n|}\n\n==Criticism==\n* A large number of grammatical errors exist in their Bible and commentary translations, changing the meaning of these passages. B. Barry Levy alleged in 1981:<blockquote>''Dikduk'' (grammar) is anathema in many Jewish circles, but the translation and presentation of texts is, to a large extent, a [[Philology|philological]] activity and must be philologically accurate. The ArtScroll effort has not achieved a respectable level. There are dozens of cases where prepositions are misunderstood, where verb tenses are not perceived properly and where grammatical or linguistic terms are used incorrectly. Words are often vocalized incorrectly. These observations, it should be stressed, are not limited to the Bible text but refer to the talmudic, midrashic, targumic, medieval and modern works as well. Rabbinical passages are removed from their contexts, presented in fragmentary form thus distorting their contents, emended to update their messages even though these new ideas were not expressed in the texts themselves, misvocalized, and mistranslated: i.e. misrepresented.<ref>{{cite journal|first=B. Barry |last=Levy |title=Judge Not a Book By Its Cover |journal=Tradition |volume=19 |issue=1 |date=Spring 1981|pages=89&ndash;95}}</ref></blockquote>\n* ArtScroll biographies have been criticized as providing incomplete and partial portrayals of Rabbinic figures. Notably, this is not disputed by ArtScroll. Rabbi Nosson Scherman stated that as it pertains to biographies the mission of ArtScroll \"is to impart a positive message\" without mentioning \"disputes that can often become vitriolic.\"<ref>Scherman in an interview with Rabbi Yitzchok Frankfurter published in ''A Conversation with Rabbi Nosson Scherman On Chinuch'' (p. 66-73 in Ami Magazine, June 21, 2017), in which Frankfurter stated \"[t]o be honest, I sometimes question ArtScroll's approach when it comes to certain things. One of these is the tendency to portray the commonality between ''gedolei Yisrael'' rather than their particular ''hashkafos'' [worldviews]. I grew up in a generation when people liked to debate what this ''gadol'' said versus what another one said. Today there's much more uniformity; everyone believes the same things in the same way.\" Upon responding \"[o]ur role is not to discuss issues in current events. Our intention is to present the text,\" Frankfurter questioned Scherman: \"Even when it comes to biographies and the like?\" Scherman replied: \"We include the opinions of whichever ''gadol'' is the subject of the biography, but we don't necessarily discuss dissenting views. We feel that our mission is to educate people and to be ''marbeh kevod shamayim'' [to increase honor of God]. We try to stay away from disputes that can often become vitriolic. Getting involved in such things is not our mission. Our mission is to impart a positive message.\"</ref>\n* The commentary of [[Rashbam]] to the first chapter of Genesis<ref>ArtScroll omitted entire sections of Rashbam's commentary on Gen. 1:4, 1:5, 1:8, and 1:31.

However, Rashbam takes a [[peshat]] (plain sense) approach, as he does throughout his commentary, reading the verse as follows: \"There was an evening (at the conclusion of daytime) and a morning (at the end of night), one day\"; that is, the day begins in the morning and lasts until the next daybreak.<ref>First identified by [[Marc B.

Due to the makeup of the Jewish community in the US, most of the prayer books are geared to the [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazic]] custom. In more recent years, Artscroll has collaborated with Sephardic community leaders in an attempt to bridge this gap. Examples of this include a Sephardic [[Haggadah]] published by Artscroll, written by Sephardic Rabbi Eli Mansour, and the book ''[[Aleppo]]'', about a prominent [[Sephardic Jews|Sephardic]] community in [[Syria]].<ref>{{cite book\n   |title=Through the flames of Aleppo: A novel (ArtScroll youth series)\n   |url=https://www.amazon.com/Through-flames-Aleppo-novel-ArtScroll/dp/1578195381\n   |isbn=1578195381}}</ref>\n\nIn translations and commentaries, ArtScroll accepts [[midrash]]ic accounts in a historical fashion, and at times literally; it disagrees with [[textual criticism]].

This was the second complete translation of the Talmud into English (the other being the [[Soncino Press|Soncino]] Talmud published in the United Kingdom during the mid-twentieth century).\n\nThe first volume, Tractate Makkos, was published in 1990,<ref name=\"ny\"/> and dedicated by Mr. and Mrs. Marcos Katz. [[Jerome Schottenstein]] was introduced by Dr. Norman Lamm to the publication committee shortly thereafter. He began by donating funds for the project in memory of his parents Ephraim and Anna Schottenstein one volume at a time, and later decided to back the entire project. When Jerome died, his children and widow, Geraldine, rededicated the project to his memory in addition to those of his parents. The goal of the project was to, \"open the doors of the Talmud and welcome its people inside.\"\n\nThe text generally consists of two side-by-side pages: one of the [[Jewish Babylonian Aramaic|Aramaic]]/[[Mishnaic Hebrew|Hebrew]] [[Vilna Edition]] text, and the corresponding page consists of an English translation. The English translation has a bolded literal translation of the Talmud's text, but also includes un-bolded text clarifying the literal translation. (The original Talmud's text is often very unclear, referring to places, times, people, and laws that it does not explain. The un-bolded text attempts to explain these situations. The text of the Talmud also contains few prepositions, articles, etc. The un-bolded text takes the liberty of inserting these parts of speech.) The result is an English text that reads in full sentences with full explanations, while allowing the reader to distinguish between direct translation and a more liberal approach to the translation. (This also results in one page of the Vilna Talmud requiring several pages of English translation.) Below the English translation appear extensive notes including diagrams.<ref name=\"ny\"/>\n\nArtScroll's English explanations and footnoted commentary in the Schottenstein Edition of the Talmud are based on the perspective of classical Jewish sources. The clarifying explanation is generally based on the viewpoint of [[Rashi]], the medieval commentator who wrote the first comprehensive commentary on the Talmud. The Schottenstein Edition does not include contemporary academic or critical scholarship.  The overall guidelines follow a pattern defined by the late Rabbi Hersh Goldwurm, \"a Monsey, N.Y., scholar who died in 1993.\"<ref name=\"ny\"/>\n\nThe total cost of the project is estimated at US$21 million,<ref name=\"ny\"/> most of which was contributed by private donors and foundations. Some volumes have up to 2 million copies in distribution, while more recent volumes have only 90,000 copies currently printed. A completed set was dedicated on February 9, 2005, to the [[Library of Congress]], and the [[siyum]] (celebration at the \"completion\") was held on March 15, 2005, the 13th [[yahrzeit]] of Jerome Schottenstein, at the [[New York Hilton]].\n\nMesorah and the Schottenstein family have also printed a Hebrew version of the commentary and have begun both an English and Hebrew translation of the ''Talmud Yerushalmi'' ([[Jerusalem Talmud]]).\n\nThe blue-covered Hebrew Talmud set, which like the English counterpart is 73 volumes, has a [[Haskama|HasKaMa]] (approbation) from a [[Bobover]] Rebbe, Grand Rabbi [[Naftali Tzvi Halberstam|Naftali Halberstam]].<ref>printed inside</ref>\n\nA French language set was begun.<ref>copies have been sold in the USA. The first volume was in memory of Mr. [[Safra Group|Safra]] of the eponymous bank.</ref>\n\n==Transliteration system==\nArtscroll publications,<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Jewish prayers for Orthodox services - Translation and transliteration\n|url=http://www.kakatuv.com/orthodox.html\n|quote=... correspond to the Rabbinical Council of America Edition of the Artscroll Siddur}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|title=If You Can Read This - You Can Pray In Hebrew\n|url=http://ou.org.s3.amazonaws.com/publications/siddur.htm}}</ref> such as the [[Irving I. Stone|Stone Editions]] of Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) and [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] (Pentateuch) use many more transliterated Hebrew words than English words, compared to editions such as the [[Tanakh]] of the [[Jewish Publication Society]]. This reflects a higher use of untranslated Hebrew terminology in Haredi English usage.\n\nArtScroll's transliteration system for [[Hebrew transliteration]] for readers of the English language generally uses [[Ashkenazi Hebrew|Ashkenazi]] consonants and [[Sephardi Hebrew|Sefardi]] vowels. The two major differences between the way Sefardi and Ashkenazi Hebrew dialects are transcribed are as follows:\n*the letter [[Taw (letter)|Tav]] without a [[dagesh]] (emphasis point) is transcribed as [t] and [s] respectively\n**ArtScroll uses the latter\n*the vowel [[niqqud|kamatz gadol]], is transcribed [a] and [o] respectively\n**ArtScroll uses the former\n\nAs such, the following transliterations are used:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Ashkenazi\n!Sefardi\n!ArtScroll\n|-\n|Boruch\n|Barukh\n|Baruch\n|-\n|Shabbos\n|Shabbat\n|Shabbos (<small>ArtScroll makes an exception due to widespread usage</small>)\n|-\n|Succos\n|Succot\n|Succos\n|-\n|Avrohom\n|Avraham\n|Avraham\n|-\n|Akeidas Yitzchok\n|Akedat Yitzhak\n|Akeidas Yitzchak\n|}\n\n==Criticism==\n* A large number of grammatical errors exist in their Bible and commentary translations, changing the meaning of these passages. B. Barry Levy alleged in 1981:<blockquote>''Dikduk'' (grammar) is anathema in many Jewish circles, but the translation and presentation of texts is, to a large extent, a [[Philology|philological]] activity and must be philologically accurate. The ArtScroll effort has not achieved a respectable level. There are dozens of cases where prepositions are misunderstood, where verb tenses are not perceived properly and where grammatical or linguistic terms are used incorrectly. Words are often vocalized incorrectly. These observations, it should be stressed, are not limited to the Bible text but refer to the talmudic, midrashic, targumic, medieval and modern works as well. Rabbinical passages are removed from their contexts, presented in fragmentary form thus distorting their contents, emended to update their messages even though these new ideas were not expressed in the texts themselves, misvocalized, and mistranslated: i.e. misrepresented.<ref>{{cite journal|first=B. Barry |last=Levy |title=Judge Not a Book By Its Cover |journal=Tradition |volume=19 |issue=1 |date=Spring 1981|pages=89&ndash;95}}</ref></blockquote>\n* ArtScroll biographies have been criticized as providing incomplete and partial portrayals of Rabbinic figures. Notably, this is not disputed by ArtScroll. Rabbi Nosson Scherman stated that as it pertains to biographies the mission of ArtScroll \"is to impart a positive message\" without mentioning \"disputes that can often become vitriolic.\"<ref>Scherman in an interview with Rabbi Yitzchok Frankfurter published in ''A Conversation with Rabbi Nosson Scherman On Chinuch'' (p. 66-73 in Ami Magazine, June 21, 2017), in which Frankfurter stated \"[t]o be honest, I sometimes question ArtScroll's approach when it comes to certain things. One of these is the tendency to portray the commonality between ''gedolei Yisrael'' rather than their particular ''hashkafos'' [worldviews]. I grew up in a generation when people liked to debate what this ''gadol'' said versus what another one said. Today there's much more uniformity; everyone believes the same things in the same way.\" Upon responding \"[o]ur role is not to discuss issues in current events. Our intention is to present the text,\" Frankfurter questioned Scherman: \"Even when it comes to biographies and the like?\" Scherman replied: \"We include the opinions of whichever ''gadol'' is the subject of the biography, but we don't necessarily discuss dissenting views. We feel that our mission is to educate people and to be ''marbeh kevod shamayim'' [to increase honor of God]. We try to stay away from disputes that can often become vitriolic. Getting involved in such things is not our mission. Our mission is to impart a positive message.\"</ref>\n* The commentary of [[Rashbam]] to the first chapter of Genesis<ref>ArtScroll omitted entire sections of Rashbam's commentary on Gen. 1:4, 1:5, 1:8, and 1:31.

However, Rashbam takes a [[peshat]] (plain sense) approach, as he does throughout his commentary, reading the verse as follows: \"There was an evening (at the conclusion of daytime) and a morning (at the end of night), one day\"; that is, the day begins in the morning and lasts until the next daybreak.<ref>First identified by [[Marc B.

It has been mined extensively for these purposes.\n\n==History==\nThe first shipment of saltpeter to Europe arrived in England from Peru in 1820 or 1825, right after that country's independence from Spain, but did not find any buyers and was dumped at sea in order to avoid customs toll.<ref>S.

For more than a century, the world supply of the compound was mined almost exclusively from the [[Atacama]] desert in northern Chile until, at the turn of the 20th century, German chemists [[Fritz Haber]] and [[Carl Bosch]] developed a process for producing [[ammonia]] from the atmosphere on an industrial scale (see [[Haber process]]).  With the onset of [[World War I]], Germany began converting ammonia from this process into a synthetic ''Chilean saltpeter'', which was as practical as the natural compound in production of [[gunpowder]] and other munitions.  By the 1940s, this conversion process resulted in a dramatic decline in demand for sodium nitrate procured from natural sources.\n\nChile still has the largest reserves of [[caliche]],with active mines in such locations as [[Pedro de Valdivia]], [[Mar\u00eda Elena]] and Pampa Blanca, and there it used to be called ''white gold''.<ref name=nitrate_towns/><ref name=ghost_towns/> Sodium nitrate, [[potassium nitrate]], [[sodium sulfate]] and [[iodine]] are all obtained by the processing of caliche.

At lower pressure the lower temperature needed results in less decomposition.  The theoretical 2 moles of nitric acid per 1 mole of [[sulfuric acid]] results in a very high end temperature, much decomposition and a solid neutral sulfate that is difficult to remove.  When this reaction was important industrially, it was common practice to operate with [[sulfuric acid]] in excess to end on a mostly bisulfate product poured molten out of the retort.\n\n[[Hobbyist]] gold refiners use sodium nitrate to make a hybrid [[aqua regia]] that dissolves gold and other metals.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nLess common applications include as an oxidizer in fireworks, replacing [[potassium nitrate]] commonly found in [[black powder]], and as a component in instant cold packs.<ref>Albert A.

It has been mined extensively for these purposes.\n\n==History==\nThe first shipment of Peruvian saltpeter to Europe arrived in England in 1820 or 1825, right after that country's independence from Spain, but did not find any buyers and was dumped at sea in order to avoid customs toll.<ref>S.

For more than a century, the world supply of the compound was mined almost exclusively from the [[Atacama]] desert in northern Chile until, at the turn of the 20th century, German chemists [[Fritz Haber]] and [[Carl Bosch]] developed a process for producing [[ammonia]] from the atmosphere on an industrial scale (see [[Haber process]]).  With the onset of [[World War I]], Germany began converting ammonia from this process into a synthetic ''Chilean saltpeter'', which was as practical as the natural compound in production of [[gunpowder]] and other munitions.  By the 1940s, this conversion process resulted in a dramatic decline in demand for sodium nitrate procured from natural sources.\n\nChile still has the largest reserves of [[caliche]],with active mines in such locations as [[Pedro de Valdivia]], [[Mar\u00eda Elena]] and Pampa Blanca, and there it used to be called ''white gold''.<ref name=nitrate_towns/><ref name=ghost_towns/> Sodium nitrate, [[potassium nitrate]], [[sodium sulfate]] and [[iodine]] are all obtained by the processing of caliche.

At lower pressure the lower temperature needed results in less decomposition.  The theoretical 2 moles of nitric acid per 1 mole of [[sulfuric acid]] results in a very high end temperature, much decomposition and a solid neutral sulfate that is difficult to remove.  When this reaction was important industrially, it was common practice to operate with [[sulfuric acid]] in excess to end on a mostly bisulfate product poured molten out of the retort.\n\n[[Hobbyist]] gold refiners use sodium nitrate to make a hybrid [[aqua regia]] that dissolves gold and other metals.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nLess common applications include as an oxidizer in fireworks, replacing [[potassium nitrate]] commonly found in [[black powder]], and as a component in instant cold packs.<ref>Albert A.

[[Nitrosomonas]], a genus of [[microorganism]]s, consumes nitrate in preference to oxygen, enabling it to grow more rapidly in the wastewater to be treated.\n\nSodium nitrate is also sometimes used by marine aquarists who utilize carbon-dosing techniques.

The Victorian Bar is affiliated with the [[Australian Bar Association]] and is a member of the [[Law Council of Australia]].\n\nThe first association of barristers in Victoria was formed in 1884, although the first barristers admitted to practice in Victoria were appointed in 1841. On 20 June 1900 an official Bar Council was established, and a Bar Roll was started. By 1902, all barristers practising in [[Melbourne]] had signed the Roll. To this day, new barristers sign the Roll when they are admitted to the Bar.\n\nThe Victorian Bar\u2019s mission is to foster the independence, excellence, leadership and growth of its members individually and as a profession. The Victorian Bar supports its members and the community by delivering services to promote the better administration of justice and the rule of law, enhance the reputation, effectiveness and cohesion of the Bar and the profession, and ensure the well-being of its members.\n\nAs at June 2019, 30% of barristers at the Victorian Bar were women, and women made up 43% of those with less than 10 years\u2019 practising at the Bar.

The arc begins with \"[[Pray You Catch Me]]\", with Beyonc\u00e9 suspecting her husband of infidelity. On the outro of the track, Beyonc\u00e9 asks \"What are you doing, my love?\". She is in denial of the affair in \"[[Hold Up (song)|Hold Up]]\", but spills over into anger on \"[[Don't Hurt Yourself (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Don't Hurt Yourself]]\", telling him \"If you try this shit again, you gon lose your wife\". Beyonc\u00e9 is apathetic about the relationship in \"[[Sorry (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Sorry]]\", deciding to leave her husband and telling him \"I left a note in the hallway. By the time you read it, I'll be far away\" and saying \"He better call Becky with the good hair\". Beyonc\u00e9 expresses emptiness on \"[[6 Inch]]\", but shows signs of vulnerability as she ends the track with a repetition of \"Come back, come back\". On \"[[Daddy Lessons]]\", Beyonc\u00e9 connects Jay-Z to her father, [[Mathew Knowles]], who cheated on Beyonc\u00e9's mother [[Tina Knowles|Tina]], and contemplates if she can forgive her husband as she forgave her father. On \"[[Love Drought]]\", Beyonc\u00e9 reaches out to Jay-Z, professing her love and making a plea to him. Beyonc\u00e9 relates how she can't live without her husband, telling him \"Your heart is broken 'cause I walked away. Show me your scars and I won't walk away, and I know I promised that I couldn't stay, baby. Every promise don't work out that way\". Beyonc\u00e9 decides on moving ahead with her husband on \"[[Forward (song)|Forward]]\", while on \"[[Freedom (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Freedom]]\" Beyonc\u00e9 relates her overcoming of her challenges to that of African-American women. The arc ends with \"[[All Night (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|All Night]]\", where Beyonc\u00e9 sings \"They say true love's the greatest weapon to win the war caused by pain, but every diamond has imperfections, but my love's too pure to watch it chip away\". On the outro of the track, Beyonc\u00e9 says \"How I missed you, my love\", mirroring the outro of the album opener, with the two phrases bookending Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s emotional rollercoaster. \"Formation\" is a [[black pride]] anthem, with Beyonc\u00e9 celebrating her Deep Southern heritage and culture, such as in the lyrics \"My daddy Alabama, momma Louisiana, you mix that [[negro]] with that [[Creole peoples|Creole]], make a Texas bama. I like my baby heir with baby hair and afros, I like my negro nose with [[The Jackson 5|Jackson Five]] nostrils.

At the end of the song \"[[Freedom (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Freedom]]\", an audio recording of Hattie White speaking to a crowd at her ninetieth birthday party in December 2015 is played. During the speech, Hattie says: \"I had my ups and downs, but I always find the inner strength to pull myself up. I was served lemons, but I made lemonade\", referencing the proverb \"[[when life gives you lemons, make lemonade]]\" that encourages turning sourness and difficulty to something positive. Beyonc\u00e9 also draws a connection to her own grandmother, Agnez Der\u00e9on, using her lemonade recipe that was passed down through the generations as a metaphor for the mechanisms for healing passed through generations:<ref name=\":28\" /><blockquote>Take one pint of water, add a half pound of sugar, the juice of eight lemons, the zest of half lemon. Pour the water into one, then to another several times. Strain through a clean napkin. Grandmother, the [[Alchemy|alchemist]], you spun gold out of this hard life, conjured beauty from the things left behind. Found healing where it did not live. Discovered the antidote in your own kit. Broke the curse with your own two hands. You passed these instructions down to your daughter who then passed it down to her daughter. My grandma said \"Nothing real can be threatened. True love brought salvation back into me. With every tear came redemption and my torturer became my remedy\".</blockquote>The cover artwork for ''Lemonade'' features Beyonc\u00e9 standing next to a car, wearing a fur coat and [[cornrow]] braids, hiding her face behind her arm. It was shot during the filming of the music video for \"[[Don't Hurt Yourself (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Don't Hurt Yourself]]\".\n\n== Release and promotion ==\n=== Release ===\n''Lemonade'' was first made available for [[online streaming]] via [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]] on April 23, 2016 through [[Parkwood Entertainment]] and [[Columbia Records]], and for [[Music download|digital download]] the following day.

In ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', [[Greg Tate]] calls ''Lemonade'' \"a triumph of marketing and musicality, spectacle and song, vision and collaboration, [[Assimilation (Star Trek)|Borg-like assimilation]], and \u2014 as of 2013 \u2014 the element of surprise\". Lauding both the film and album, Tate writes \"Visually, literarily, choreographically, cinematically, this full accessing of her Southern bona fides shows up in the HBO project as ritual evidence that Bey\u2019s spent her downtime delving into the avant-garde mysticism of [[Black feminism|black-feminist]] poetry, novel writing, dance, gallery art, and film... The album, however, is out to sonorously suck you into its gully gravitational orbit the old fashioned way, placing the burden of conjuration on its steamy witches' brew of beats, melodies, and heavy-hearted-to-merry-pranksterish vocal seductions. In her mastery of carnal and esoteric mysteries, Queen Bey raises the spirits, sizzles the flesh, and rallies her troops.\"<ref name=\"Spin\">{{cite web|first=Greg|last=Tate|authorlink=Greg Tate|url=http://www.spin.com/2016/04/review-beyonce-lemonade/|title=Review: Beyonc\u00e9 Is the Rightful Heir to Michael Jackson and Prince on 'Lemonade'|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|accessdate=April 28, 2016|date=April 28, 2016}}</ref> [[AllMusic]] writer Andy Kellman called ''Lemonade'' \"culturally seismic\" through its \"layers of meaning and references, and experienced en masse through its televised premiere\", adding that \"the cathartic and wounded moments here resonate in a manner matched by few, if any, of Beyonc\u00e9's contemporaries.\"<ref name=\"AllMusic Review\" />\n\nIn a five-star review for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Rob Sheffield]] calls ''Lemonade'' \"a welcome reminder that giants still walk among us\", describing it as an \"album of emotional discord and marital meltdown... from the most respected and creative artist in the pop game\".

Yet the most astounding sound is always Bey\u2019s voice\", which is described as \"her wildest, rawest vocals ever\".

The arc begins with \"[[Pray You Catch Me]]\", with Beyonc\u00e9 suspecting her husband of infidelity. On the outro of the track, Beyonc\u00e9 asks \"What are you doing, my love?\". She is in denial of the affair in \"[[Hold Up (song)|Hold Up]]\", but spills over into anger on \"[[Don't Hurt Yourself (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Don't Hurt Yourself]]\", telling him \"If you try this shit again, you gon lose your wife\". Beyonc\u00e9 is apathetic about the relationship in \"[[Sorry (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Sorry]]\", deciding to leave her husband and telling him \"I left a note in the hallway. By the time you read it, I'll be far away\" and saying \"He better call Becky with the good hair\". Beyonc\u00e9 expresses emptiness on \"[[6 Inch]]\", but shows signs of vulnerability as she ends the track with a repetition of \"Come back, come back\". On \"[[Daddy Lessons]]\", Beyonc\u00e9 connects Jay-Z to her father, [[Mathew Knowles]], who cheated on Beyonc\u00e9's mother [[Tina Knowles|Tina]], and contemplates if she can forgive her husband as she forgave her father. On \"[[Love Drought]]\", Beyonc\u00e9 reaches out to Jay-Z, professing her love and making a plea to him. Beyonc\u00e9 relates how she can't live without her husband, telling him \"Your heart is broken 'cause I walked away. Show me your scars and I won't walk away, and I know I promised that I couldn't stay, baby. Every promise don't work out that way\". Beyonc\u00e9 decides on moving ahead with her husband on \"[[Forward (song)|Forward]]\", while on \"[[Freedom (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Freedom]]\" Beyonc\u00e9 relates her overcoming of her challenges to that of African-American women. The arc ends with \"[[All Night (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|All Night]]\", where Beyonc\u00e9 sings \"They say true love's the greatest weapon to win the war caused by pain, but every diamond has imperfections, but my love's too pure to watch it chip away\". On the outro of the track, Beyonc\u00e9 says \"How I missed you, my love\", mirroring the outro of the album opener, with the two phrases bookending Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s emotional rollercoaster. \"Formation\" is a [[black pride]] anthem, with Beyonc\u00e9 celebrating her Deep Southern heritage and culture, such as in the lyrics \"My daddy Alabama, momma Louisiana, you mix that [[negro]] with that [[Creole peoples|Creole]], make a Texas bama. I like my baby heir with baby hair and afros, I like my negro nose with [[The Jackson 5|Jackson Five]] nostrils.

Lord, forgive me, I've been running, running blind in truth\"), [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]] (\"I'ma wade, I'ma [[Wade in the Water|wave through the waters]]\"), and [[Black Lives Matter]] (\"I'ma riot, I'ma riot through your borders, call me bulletproof\"). [[Kendrick Lamar]]'s verse also contains many political allusions, including the lyrics \"Seven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona, six headlights wavin' in my direction\"; both Beyonc\u00e9 and Lamar faced backlash for their respective songs \"[[Formation (song)|Formation]]\" and \"[[Alright (Kendrick Lamar song)|Alright]]\", with some critics misconstruing the songs' messages of hope and anti-[[police brutality]] and claiming the artists were instead inciting violence and hatred.<ref>{{Citation|title=Beyonc\u00e9 (Ft.

At the end of the song \"[[Freedom (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Freedom]]\", an audio recording of Hattie White speaking to a crowd at her ninetieth birthday party in December 2015 is played. During the speech, Hattie says: \"I had my ups and downs, but I always find the inner strength to pull myself up. I was served lemons, but I made lemonade\", referencing the proverb \"[[when life gives you lemons, make lemonade]]\" that encourages turning sourness and difficulty to something positive. Beyonc\u00e9 also draws a connection to her own grandmother, Agnez Der\u00e9on, using her lemonade recipe that was passed down through the generations as a metaphor for the mechanisms for healing passed through generations:<ref name=\":28\" /><blockquote>Take one pint of water, add a half pound of sugar, the juice of eight lemons, the zest of half lemon. Pour the water into one, then to another several times. Strain through a clean napkin. Grandmother, the [[Alchemy|alchemist]], you spun gold out of this hard life, conjured beauty from the things left behind. Found healing where it did not live. Discovered the antidote in your own kit. Broke the curse with your own two hands. You passed these instructions down to your daughter who then passed it down to her daughter. My grandma said \"Nothing real can be threatened. True love brought salvation back into me. With every tear came redemption and my torturer became my remedy\".</blockquote>The cover artwork for ''Lemonade'' features Beyonc\u00e9 standing next to a car, wearing a fur coat and [[cornrow]] braids, hiding her face behind her arm. It was shot during the filming of the music video for \"[[Don't Hurt Yourself (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Don't Hurt Yourself]]\".\n\n== Release and promotion ==\n=== Release ===\n''Lemonade'' was first made available for [[online streaming]] via [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]] on April 23, 2016 through [[Parkwood Entertainment]] and [[Columbia Records]], and for [[Music download|digital download]] the following day.

Lauding both the film and album, Tate writes \"Visually, literarily, choreographically, cinematically, this full accessing of her Southern bona fides shows up in the HBO project as ritual evidence that Bey\u2019s spent her downtime delving into the avant-garde mysticism of [[Black feminism|black-feminist]] poetry, novel writing, dance, gallery art, and film... The album, however, is out to sonorously suck you into its gully gravitational orbit the old fashioned way, placing the burden of conjuration on its steamy witches' brew of beats, melodies, and heavy-hearted-to-merry-pranksterish vocal seductions. In her mastery of carnal and esoteric mysteries, Queen Bey raises the spirits, sizzles the flesh, and rallies her troops.\"<ref name=\"Spin\">{{cite web|first=Greg|last=Tate|authorlink=Greg Tate|url=http://www.spin.com/2016/04/review-beyonce-lemonade/|title=Review: Beyonc\u00e9 Is the Rightful Heir to Michael Jackson and Prince on 'Lemonade'|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|accessdate=April 28, 2016|date=April 28, 2016}}</ref> [[AllMusic]] writer Andy Kellman called ''Lemonade'' \"culturally seismic\" through its \"layers of meaning and references, and experienced en masse through its televised premiere\", adding that \"the cathartic and wounded moments here resonate in a manner matched by few, if any, of Beyonc\u00e9's contemporaries.\"<ref name=\"AllMusic Review\" />\n\nIn a five-star review for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Rob Sheffield]] calls ''Lemonade'' \"a welcome reminder that giants still walk among us\", describing it as an \"album of emotional discord and marital meltdown... from the most respected and creative artist in the pop game\".

Yet the most astounding sound is always Bey\u2019s voice\", which is described as \"her wildest, rawest vocals ever\".
