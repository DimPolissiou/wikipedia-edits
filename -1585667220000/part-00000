In the French-derived branch of Arthurian legend, the Knights are an order in the service of Arthur, tasked with ensuring the peace of the kingdom and charged with leading the quest for the [[Holy Grail]]. The [[Round Table]] at which they met was supposed to represent the equality of all the members.\n\nDifferent stories presented different numbers of the Knights, ranging from only 12 to as many as 150 or more. [[Bedivere]], [[Gawain]] and [[Sir Kay|Kay]] are the oldest characters associated with Arthur. Gawain was also one of those most popular, alongside [[Lancelot]], [[Percival]] and [[Tristan]], each of them featured as protagonist or eponymous hero in multiple works of the [[chivalric romance]] genre. Other well-known members of the order include [[Galahad]], the most perfect knight in the later tradition wherein he replaced Percival as achiever of the Grail, and the traitor [[Mordred]].\n\n== List ==\nTheir total number (always symbolic) and the names vary depending on the text. The first sources state 24, 36 or 72. For [[Robert de Boron]], for whom the [[Round Table]] is a replica of the table of the [[Last Supper]], they are fifty. In some versions, including ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' by [[Thomas Malory]], they are 150 (\"three times fifty\" is a phrase that is often found in Welsh or Irish texts, which means \"a large number\" or even \"immeasurable\"). Those best known are as follows: \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#ffdead;\" | Knights of the Round Table\n|-\n! style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" |Name\n! style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" |Other names\n! style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" |Introduction\n! style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" |Other medieval works\n! style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" |Notes\n|-\n| [[Aglovale]]\n| Agloval, Sir Aglovale de Galis\n|\n| ''The Life of Sir Aglovale de Galis''\n| King Pellinore's eldest son\n|-\n| [[Agravain]]\n| Agravaine\n|\n| [[Lancelot-Grail]], ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''\n| Second son of [[King Lot]] (of either [[Lothian]] or [[Orkney]]) and Arthur's sister [[Morgause]] \n|-\n| [[King Arthur|Arthur]]\n| Arthur Pendragon, Arturus\n| ''[[Y Gododdin]]'', c. 7th century\n| Many\n| High King of the Britons, ruler of [[Logres]] and lord of [[Camelot]]\n|-\n| [[Bagdemagus]]\n|\n|\n|''[[Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart]]'', 1170s\n| Meleagant's father and ruler of Gorre\n|-\n| [[Bedivere]]\n| (Welsh: ''Bedwyr'', French: ''B\u00e9doier'') Bedevere\n| ''Pa Gur yv y Porthaur'', c. 10th century\n| ''[[Cadoc|Vita Cadoc]]'', ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', ''[[Englynion y Beddau|Stanzas of the Graves]]'', ''[[Welsh Triads]]'', ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'', ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', numerous others\n| Returns [[Excalibur]] to the [[Lady of the Lake]], brother to Lucan\n|-\n| [[Bors]] the Younger\n|\n|\n|\n| Son of Bors the Elder, father of Elyan the White; in some versions Arthur's successor\n|-\n|[[Brunor]]\n| Breunor le Noir, ''La Cote Male Taile'' (\"The Badly-shaped Coat\")\n|\n|\n|Knight who wears his murdered father's coat, brother of Dinadan and Daniel\n|-\n| [[Cador]]\n| (Latin: ''Cadorius'')\n|\n| ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'', ''[[The Dream of Rhonabwy]]''\n| Raised [[Guinevere]] as his ward, father to Constantine, described in some works as Arthur's cousin\n|-\n| [[Calogrenant]]\n| Colgrevance, Cynan\n| ''[[Yvain, the Knight of the Lion]]'', 1170s\n| ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''\n| Cousin to Sir Yvain\n|-\n| [[Caradoc]]\n| (Latin: ''Caractacus'') (Welsh: ''Caradog Freichfras'', meaning Caradoc Strong Arm) (French: ''Carados Briefbras'')\n|\n| ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail]]'', the ''[[Mabinogion]]''\n| Rebelled against Arthur when he first became king, but later supported him.

Like his brothers [[Sir Tor|Tor]], [[Lamorak]], Dornar and [[Percival]], he is a Knight of the [[Round Table]]. In [[chivalric romance]]s, Aglovale never cuts as impressive a figure as his brothers Lamorak and Percival, but his valor is unquestioned. \n\nAccording to the [[Post-Vulgate Cycle|Post Vulgate Cycle]] and [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', it is he who first brings Percival to [[Camelot]] to be knighted. In the [[Vulgate Cycle]], Aglovale dies accidentally at [[Gawain]]'s hand during the Quest for the [[Holy Grail]]. However, in Malory he and his brother Tor are among the knights charged with defending the execution of [[Guinevere]] and are both killed when [[Lancelot]] and his men rescue the queen.\n\nAglovale appears prominently in the Dutch romance ''[[Morien]]''. In a situation similar to [[Gahmuret]]'s begetting of [[Feirefiz]] in [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]'s ''[[Parzival]]'', Aglovale visits [[Moors|Moorish]] lands where he meets a beautiful black Christian princess and conceives a child with her. He returns to his own lands, and thirteen years later, his son Morien comes to find him. After a number of adventures, father and son are reunited and both return to Morien's country to take back their rightful lands. \n\nIn modern works, Aglovale is the eponymous protagonist of [[Clemence Housman]]'s 1905 novel ''The Life of Sir Aglovale de Galis.'' [[T. H. White]]'s book ''[[The Once and Future King]]'' gives a particularly endearing portrait of the knight.\n\n=== Agravain ===\n{{main|Agravain}}\n\n=== Bagdemagus ===\n{{main|Bagdemagus}}\n\n=== Bedivere ===\n{{main|Bedivere}}\n\n=== Bors ===\n{{main|Bors}}\n\n=== Brunor ===\n{{main|Brunor}}\n\n=== Cador ===\n{{main|Cador}}\n\n===Calogrenant===\n'''Calogrenant''', sometimes known in English as '''Colgrevance''', is a cousin to [[Yvain]], and his courtesy and eloquence were known throughout the kingdom. Calogrenant first appears in [[Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes]]' ''[[Yvain, the Knight of the Lion]]''. After a good meal, Calogrenant tells a story to a group of knights and [[Queen Guinevere]] about an adventure he had in the forest of [[Broc\u00e9liande]]. He had heard of a magic spring in those woods which could create a huge storm whenever someone poured its water into a nearby basin. With directions from a local family and a gruesomely depicted giant, Calogrenant reached the spring and summoned the storm. Immediately after the storm, a knight named [[Esclados]] attacked him for causing such havoc. The knight soundly defeated Calogrenant, but did not kill him. Calogrenant's cousin Yvain is upset that Calogrenant never told him of this defeat, and sets out to avenge him, embarking on the adventure that sets up the remainder of events in the romance.\n\nHis character has been derived from the [[Welsh mythology|Welsh mythological]] hero [[Cynon ap Clydno]], usually the lover of [[Owain]]'s sister [[Morvydd]], although in ''[[Owain, or the Lady of the Fountain]]'' Cynon is stated to be the son of Clydno, possibly connected to [[Clyddno Eiddin]].<ref name=\"rl\">{{cite book|title=Arthurian Tradition and Chretien De Troyes|last=Loomis|first=Roger|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1949}}</ref> [[Roger Sherman Loomis]] and other scholars speculated that Calogrenant was used specifically as a foil for [[Sir Kay|Kay]] in some lost early version of the ''Yvain'' story. In Chr\u00e9tien's romance he is presented as everything Kay is not: polite, respectful, and well-mannered. By this theory, his name can be deconstructed to \"Cai lo grenant\", or \"Cai the grumbler\", which would represent another opposite characteristic of Kay, who was famous for his acid tongue.<ref name=\"rl\" />\n\nCalogrenant appears later in the [[Lancelot-Grail]] cycle as an excellent knight, though his kinship to Yvain is not as clear as in Chr\u00e9tien. He dies during the [[Grail Quest]] while trying to keep  [[Sir Lionel|Lionel]] from killing his own brother, [[Bors]]. Bors had faced a dilemma over whom to rescue between Lionel, who was getting beaten with thorns by two rogue knights, and a maiden who had just been abducted, and chose the maiden over his brother. Lionel was not pleased by this, and attacked Bors the next time he saw him. A religious [[hermit]] tried to intervene, but was killed accidentally in the process, and Calogrenant stepped in. Bors would not fight his brother, and Lionel slays Calogrenant and goes after Bors until God steps in and renders him immobile.\n\n[[Thomas Malory]] recounts Calogrenant's death scene in his ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', but also includes another one later in the narrative. Despite dying on the Grail quest, he turns up as one of the twelve knights who help [[Agravaine]] and [[Mordred]] trap [[Lancelot]] and Guinevere together. Lancelot has no armour or weapons, but manages to pull Calogrenant into the room and kills him, then uses his sword to defeat the rest of Mordred's companions.\n\n=== Caradoc ===\n{{main|Caradoc}}\n\n===Claudin===\n'''Prince Claudin''', also known as '''Claudin the Younger''' or '''Claudine''', is the son of the [[Franks|Frankish]] King [[Claudas]]. He appears in the [[Lancelot-Grail]] and in ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''. His father is a villain during [[King Arthur]]'s early reign, an enemy to Arthur's French allies [[King Ban|Ban]] and [[Bors]], but Claudin is a virtuous young man and wants no part of his father's schemes. Claudas eventually succumbs to Arthur and company, and Claudin seeks adventure elsewhere.\n\n=== Clig\u00e8s ===\n{{main|Clig\u00e8s}}\n\n=== Dagonet ===\n{{main|Dagonet}}\n\n=== Daniel ===\n{{main|Daniel von dem bl\u00fchenden Tal}}\n\n=== Dinadan ===\n{{main|Dinadan}}\n\n=== Elyan the White ===\n'''Elyan the White''' or '''Helyan le Blanc''' is the son of [[Bors]]. His mother is King Brandegoris' daughter Claire, who tricked Bors into sleeping with her using a magic ring; this is sometimes said to be the only time Bors broke his vow of chastity. When he is older Elyan is accepted as a member to the [[Round Table]], where he becomes known as an excellent knight. Like his father and the rest of his family, Elyan helps his cousin [[Lancelot]] rescue [[Guinevere]] after their affair is exposed and then joins him in exile. \n\nElyan's mother Claire is the half-sister of [[Sagramore]]; their mother is the daughter of the [[List of Byzantine Emperors|Eastern Roman Emperor]]. According to the [[Lancelot-Grail]] Cycle, Elyan eventually became Emperor of [[Constantinople]] himself.\n\nIn modern works, Elyan the White was portrayed as Guinevere's brother in the 2008 TV series ''[[Merlin (2008 TV series)|Merlin]]''. Appearing as just Elyan, he was played there by black actor [[Adetomiwa Edun]].\n\n===Erec===\n[[File:Hb-herec.jpg|thumb|upright|The attributed arms of \"Herec le fils Lac\"]]\n\n'''Erec''', the son of King Lac features in numerous Arthurian tales (notably the [[Post-Vulgate Cycle]]), but he is most famous as the protagonist in [[Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes]]' first romance, ''[[Erec and Enide]]''. Because of ''Erec and Enide''\u2018s relationship to the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''[[Geraint and Enid]]'', Erec and [[Geraint]] are often conflated or confused.\n\nIn Chr\u00e9tien's story, Erec meets his future wife [[Enide]] while on a quest to defeat a knight who had mistreated one of [[Guinevere]]'s servants. The two fall in love and marry, but rumours spread that Erec no longer cares for knighthood or anything else besides his domestic life. Enide cries about these rumours, causing Erec to prove his abilities, both to himself and to his wife, through a test of Enide's love for him. He has her go on a long, tortuous trip with him where she is forbidden to speak to him. She breaks his conditions several times to warn him of danger, and after a number of adventures that prove both his love and his abilities, husband and wife are reconciled. When Erec's father Lac dies, Erec inherits his kingdom.\n\n=== Esclabor ===\n[[File:Hb-exclabor.jpg|thumb|upright|The attributed arms of \"Exclabor ly Viescovtiens\"]]\n\n'''Esclabor''' is a pagan lord of [[Babylon]] or [[Galilee]] in Arthurian legend. He is the father of [[Palamedes (Arthurian legend)|Palamedes]], [[Safir (Arthurian legend)|Safir]], and [[Segwarides]], among others. While visiting [[Rome]], he saves the life of the [[Roman emperor|Roman Emperor]]. He then goes to Arthur's [[Logres]], where he saves the life of [[King Pellinore]]. He eventually retires to [[Camelot]], later adventuring with Palamedes and [[Galahad]] during the [[Holy Grail|Grail Quest]].\n\n=== Gaheris ===\n{{main|Gaheris}}\n\n=== Galahad ===\n{{main|Galahad}}\n\n=== Galehaut ===\n{{main|Galehaut}}\n\n=== Galeschin ===\n'''Galeschin''' (or '''Galeshin''') is a nephew of [[King Arthur]], son of the king's half-sister [[Elaine (legend)#Elaine_of_Garlot|Elaine]] and King [[Budic II of Brittany|Nentres of Garlot]]. He appears in the story of the ''Dolorous Tower'' in the [[Lancelot-Grail|Vulgate Cycle]], as he and his cousin [[Yvain]] attempt to rescue [[Gawain]] from the wicked Carados but are taken captive as well; the trio are eventually rescued by [[Lancelot]]. Galeschin is referred to as the [[Duke of Clarence]],<ref>Loomis (1997), p. 63</ref> an [[anachronism]] as the duchy of Clarence was not created until 1362. Though mentioned in a few other Arthurian stories, Galeschin's role is ultimately minor.\n\n[[Roger Sherman Loomis]] derives the name Galeschin from the name ''Galvariun'', found on the [[Modena Archivolt]]. He theorises that the name was altered to make it sound more like ''Galesche'', the Old French word for [[Gaul]], and derives the name Galvariun from the epithet ''Gwallt Euryn'', found in ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', which he translates as \"golden hair\".\n\n=== Gareth ===\n{{main|Gareth}}\n\n=== Gawain ===\n{{main|Gawain}}\n\n=== Geraint ===\n{{main|Geraint}}\n\n=== Gingalain ===\n{{main|Gingalain}}\n\n===Gornemant===\n'''Gornemant''' was [[Percival]]'s mentor. He is mentioned in a few early romances, but achieves prominence in ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail]]'', where he instructs the young hero in the ways of [[knighthood]]. Gornemant's niece is [[Blanchefleur]], whom Percival later marries after successfully defending her city against attackers.\n\nIn modern works, his character became famous as '''Gurnemanz''' in [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera ''[[Parsifal]]'', in which he is one of the main Grail Knights.\n\n=== Griflet ===\n{{main|Griflet}}\n\n===Hector de Maris===\n[[File:Blason Hector des mares.svg|thumb|upright|The attributed arms of Hector des Mares]]\n\n'''Hector de Maris''' (or '''Ector de Maris''', '''Hector des Mares''') is the younger half-brother of [[Lancelot]] and the [[Illegitimacy|natural son]] of [[King Ban]] of Benwick and the Lady de Maris; [[Sir Bors|Bors]] and [[Sir Lionel|Lionel]] are his cousins. He should not be mistaken with [[Sir Ector|Ector]], the father of [[Sir Kay|Kay]] and foster father of [[King Arthur|Arthur]].\n\nHector's adventures in the name of [[King Arthur]] were many and wide-ranging. With Morganore, it was Hector de Maris who welcomed [[Tristan]] to [[Camelot]] when he was shipwrecked nearby. The two jousted in a friendly competition, but Hector was ashamed to have been beaten by a knight of [[Cornwall]]. Other times he was more successful at tournaments, getting the better of both [[Palomides]] and [[Percivale]]. He, however, failed to defeat Turquine and became one of the knights he imprisoned before being rescued by his brother, [[Lancelot]]. He returned the favour by rediscovering the lost Knight of the Lake after his period of insanity and returning him to the court. He is known to have had a long relationship with Lady Perse of the Narrow Borderland, whose fianc\u00e9 he murdered in order to be with her. Hector later had an affair with the cousin of the Lady of Roestoc, before being reunited with Perse.\n\nHector also participates in the [[Grail Quest]], but he is one of the many knights who prove unworthy of achieving the object. In the ''Quest du Saint Graal'' of the [[Vulgate Cycle]], Hector and [[Gawain]] are travelling together when they experience a vision of what [[Jessie Weston]] called an \"unintelligent\" variation on the theme of the perilous Black Hand in other romances in the Grail Cycle.<ref>[[Jessie Weston|Weston, Jessie L.]] ''From Ritual to Romance'' 1920 [http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/frr/frr16.htm#fn_263 Chapter XIII The Perilous Chapel].</ref>\n\nWhen Lancelot is caught in his affair with [[Guinevere]], Hector stands by his brother and leaves court with him. He becomes one of the top leaders of Lancelot's faction, participating in the battle to rescue the queen at her execution, and the defence of Lancelot's castle [[Joyous Guard]]. Like all his family, he joins Lancelot in France when they are expelled from Arthur's kingdom, and he helps defeat the army led by [[Mordred]]'s sons after the [[Battle of Camlann]] (Salisbury). He then joins his brother at the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]'s hermitage and apparently dies there.\n\n=== Hoel ===\n{{main|Hoel}}\n\n=== Kay ===\n{{main|Sir Kay}}\n\n=== Lamorak ===\n{{main|Lamorak}}\n\n=== Lancelot ===\n{{main|Lancelot}}\n\n=== Lanval ===\n{{main|Lanval}}\n\n=== Lionel ===\n{{main|Sir Lionel}}\n\n===Lucan===\n[[File:Hb-lvcam-le-bovteillier.jpg|thumb|upright|The attributed arms of \"Lucam le Bovteillier\"]]\n\n'''Lucan the Butler''' is a servant of [[King Arthur]] and the son of Duke Corneus, brother to [[Bedivere]] and cousin to [[Griflet]]. He and his relatives are among Arthur's earliest allies in the fight against the rebel kings such as [[King Lot|Lot]], [[Urien]] and [[Caradoc]], and remained one of Arthur's loyal companions throughout his life. \n\nLucan was a solid and reliable Knight of the [[Round Table]] and one of King Arthur's earliest companions. He took on the post of royal butler \u2013 an important position in charge of the royal household rather than a serving man. The duties of a \"[[butler]]\" have changed over time; Lucan was supposed to have been in charge of the royal court, along with Bedivere the [[Marshal]] and [[Sir Kay|Kay]] the [[Seneschal]]. He valiantly defended Arthur's right to the throne at the Battle of Bedegraine and against subsequent rebellions. Though he sought adventure, he never came to the fore in Arthurian tales with renowned exploits of his own. He always attended the royal tournaments and was once hurt so badly by [[Tristan|Tristram]] that [[Yvain]] had to escort him to [[Gannes]] Abbey for medical assistance.\n\nIn most accounts of Arthur's death, from the [[Lancelot-Grail]] cycle to ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', Lucan is one of the last knights at the king's side at the [[Battle of Camlann]] and is usually the last of them to die. Lucan remained loyal to King Arthur throughout the schism with [[Lancelot]] and on occasion acted as their go-between. Similarly, he stayed by the monarch's side during [[Mordred]]'s rebellion and tried to dissuade Arthur from his final attack on his son/nephew, but was unsuccessful and the King received his mortal wound. Gravely wounded himself, Lucan was one of the few knights left at Camlann, along his brother, Bedivere. Worried about looters on the battlefield, Lucan and Bedivere attempts to move the dying Arthur into a nearby chapel for safety, but the strain is too much for Lucan as a severe wound bursts open, spilling out his bowels; he dies from his own wounds just before the king returns [[Excalibur]] to the [[Lady of the Lake]] and sails off for [[Avalon]]. Though the knight Arthur asks to cast the sword into the lake is usually Griflet (Lancelot-Grail) or Bedivere (''Le Morte d'Arthur'', the [[Alliterative Morte Arthure|Alliterative ''Morte Arthure'']], the [[Stanzaic Morte Arthur|Stanzaic ''Morte Arthur'']]), the 16th-century English ballad ''King Arthur's Death'' ascribes this duty to Lucan.<ref>\"King Arthur's Death\" is a continuation of the ballad \"The Legend of King Arthur\". See Noble, James (1991). \"King Arthur's Death\". In [[Lacy, Norris J.]] (Ed.), ''The New Arthurian Encyclopedia'', pp. 262\u2013263. New York: Garland. {{ISBN|0-8240-4377-4}}.</ref>\n\nIn modern works, a character named Lucan appears in the 2004 film ''[[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]'', played by [[Johnny Brennan]]. He is a young boy found and cared for by Arthur's warrior [[Dagonet]].\n\n=== Meliant de Lis ===\n[[File:Hb-meliandris.jpg|thumb|upright|The attributed arms of \"Mellienderis\"]]\n\n'''Meliant de Lis''' (variants include '''Melianz''', '''Melians '''and '''Melyans''') is a minor character in several [[Arthurian]] romances. In ''Livre de Artus'', [[Gawain]]'s lover Floree marries Melianz de Lis. In the Vulgate ''Lancelot'', the second romance of the [[Lancelot-Grail|Vulgate Cycle]], Carados of the Dolorous Tower takes Melyans le Gai's wife as his mistress.<ref>Loomis (1997). p. 11</ref> In ''Queste'', the third romance of the cycle, [[Galahad]], [[Bors]] and [[Percival]] are joined at Castle [[Corbenic]] by nine other knights, one of whom is Melians de Danemarche.<ref>Loomis (1997). p. 157</ref>\n\n=== Mordred ===\n{{main|Mordred}}\n\n=== Moriaen ===\n{{main|Moriaen}}\n\n=== Morholt ===\n'''Morholt''' (also called ''Marhalt'', ''Marhault'', ''Morold'', ''Marhaus'' and other variations) is an Irish warrior who demands tribute from [[Mark of Cornwall|King Mark]] of [[Cornwall]] until he is slain by [[Tristan]], Mark's nephew and defender. In many versions of the legend, Morholt's name is prefaced with a [[Article (grammar)|definite article]] (i.e. ''The'' Morholt) as if it were a rank or a title, but scholars have found no reason for this.<ref name=\"Curtis1\">Curtis, Ren\u00e9e L. (translator) (1994). The Romance of Tristan, Oxford. {{ISBN|0-19-282792-8}}.</ref> \n\nHe appears in almost all versions of the legend of [[Tristan and Iseult]], beginning with the verse works of [[Thomas of Britain]] and [[B\u00e9roul]]. In the early material, Morholt is the brother of the Queen of Ireland and the uncle of Tristan's future love (both mother and daughter are named [[Iseult]]). He comes to Cornwall to collect tribute owed to his country, but Tristan agrees to battle the champion on the remote [[Samson of Dol|Saint Samson's]] Isle in order to release his people from the debt. Tristan mortally wounds Morholt, leaving a piece of his sword in the Irishman's skull, but Morholt stabs him with a poisoned spear and escapes to Ireland to die. The injured Tristan eventually travels to Ireland incognito to receive healing from the Iseult the Younger, but is found out when the queen discovers the piece of metal found in her brother's head fits perfectly into a chink in Tristan's blade.\n\nThe authors of later romances expanded Morholt's role; in works like the [[Prose Tristan|Prose ''Tristan'']], the [[Post-Vulgate Cycle]], and [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', he is a Knight of the [[Round Table]] before his fateful encounter with Tristan. The prose romances add many more details to Morholt's career; the Post-Vulgate and Malory record his adventures with the young [[Gawain]] and [[Yvain]] early in [[King Arthur]]'s reign. In the later versions, Tristan takes Morholt's place at the Round Table when he joins the company himself.\n\n=== Palamedes ===\n{{main|Palamedes (Arthurian legend)}}\n\n=== Pelleas ===\n{{main|Pelleas}}\n\n=== Pellinore ===\n{{main|Pellinore}}\n\n=== Percival ===\n{{main|Percival}}\n\n \t\n=== Priamus ===\n'''Priamus''' is a Roman ally of Emperor Lucius in [[Thomas Malory]]'s [[Le Morte d'Arthur|''Le Morte d'Arthur.'']] He claims to be descended from [[Alexander of Africa]] and [[Judas Maccabeus]].

He is a courageous and loyal knight and was, in his time, a fairly popular character, showing up in the [[Prose Tristan|Prose ''Tristan'']] and [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''. His name is included on the [[Winchester Round Table]]. Both his brothers, [[Segwarides]] and [[Palamedes (Arthurian legend)|Palamedes]], also belong to the Round Table. \n\nSafir appears in many works of Arthurian literature, usually alongside his brother Palamedes. Though he is a younger brother, Safir converted to Christianity some time before Palamedes. In one story, Safir is disguised as [[Ector de Maris]] and fights with Helior le Preuse, defeats him, and wins Espinogres' lady. Vowing to defend the lady's honour, Palamedes arrives on the scene, and locks sword with Safir, not realising it is his brother. After fighting for an hour, both are impressed with each other's prowess and skill, and decide to ask the other's identity. Safir is devastated to find that he was fighting with his own brother and asks Palamedes for forgiveness; together, they return the lady to Espinogres. When the affair between [[Lancelot]] and [[Guinevere]] is exposed, Safir and Palamedes join Lancelot's side in the ensuing civil war between Lancelot and [[King Arthur]]. When they are banished to Lancelot's homeland in [[Gaul]], Safir is made Duke of [[Languedoc|Landok]] while Palamedes becomes Duke of [[Provence]].\n\n=== Sagramore ===\n{{main|Sagramore}}\n\n=== Segwarides ===\n[[File:Hb-securades.jpg|thumb|upright|The attributed arms of \"Securades\"]]\n\n[[File:Sir Segwarides rides ater Sir Tristram.png|thumb|Tristan and Segwarides (1912)|left]]\n\n'''Segwarides''' is a [[Vassal|liegeman]] of [[King Mark]] who is cuckolded by [[Tristan]] in the [[Prose Tristan|Prose ''Tristan'']] and [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''. Malory also lists a knight of this name as a son of the [[Saracen]] king [[Esclabor]], his brothers being [[Palamedes (Arthurian legend)|Palamedes]] and [[Safir (Arthurian legend)|Safir]]; it seems there were originally two characters of this name, but the stories in which they appear fail to differentiate between them.\n\nIn Malory, Tristan has a brief affair with Segwarides' wife, and wounds the knight after being found out. Tristan encounters Segwarides later on the Isle of Servage. Segwardies forgives the more famous knight saying he \"will never hate a noble knight for a light lady\" and the two team up to avoid the dangers of the isle. Soon afterwards, Tristan makes Segwarides the Lord of Servage. Segwarides is eventually killed trying to repel [[Lancelot]]'s rescue of [[Guinevere]] from the stake.\n\n=== Tor ===\n[[File:Blason Tor.svg|thumb|upright|The attributed arms of Tor]]\n\n'''Tor''' appears frequently in Arthurian literature. In earlier mentions Tor's father is King Ars or Aries,<ref>For example, [[Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes]]' list of knights in ''[[Erec and Enide]]''. From Owen, ''Arthurian Romances''.</ref> but the [[Post-Vulgate Cycle]] and [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' say this man is his adoptive father while his natural father is [[King Pellinore]].<ref>Lacy, ''Lancelot-Grail'', volume 4.</ref><ref>Malory, ''Le Morte d'Arthur'', Book III, ch. IV, p. 83.</ref> \n\nIn the Post-Vulgate and Malory, Tor is brother to [[Aglovale]], [[Lamorak]], Dornar, [[Percival]], and [[Dindrane]]. He is born when Pellinore sleeps with his mother \"half by force\", and she marries Aries shortly afterward; here Aries is not a king, but a [[shepherd]]. Tor and his twelve half-brothers are raised as shepherds, but Tor dreams of being a [[knight]]. Finally his parents take him to [[King Arthur]]'s court, and Arthur makes the boy one of his first knights. Later [[Merlin]] reveals Tor's true parentage, and Pellinore embraces his son; neither Aries nor his wife seem offended. Tor distinguishes himself at the wedding feast of Arthur and [[Guinevere]] when he takes up a quest to retrieve a mysterious white [[Scent hound|brachet]] hound that had come into the court. According to Malory, Tor and his brother Aglovale are among the knights charged with defending the execution of Guinevere and they both die when [[Lancelot]] and his followers rescue the queen.<ref>Malory, ''Le Morte d'Arthur'', Book XX, ch.

He is often confused with his half-brother [[Yvain]], after whom he was named; while the older Yvain is the child of Urien and his wife [[Morgan le Fay]], King Urien sired Yvain the Bastard on the wife of his [[seneschal]]. \n\nHe is encountered frequently in Arthurian romance as a hearty and sensible warrior. His death comes at the hands of his cousin [[Gawain]] during the Quest for the [[Holy Grail]]. The two meet, disguised by their armour, and decide to joust. Yvain is mortally wounded, and it is not until Gawain takes him to a hermitage for his last rites that he realises he has killed his own cousin.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Arthurian characters]]\n*[[Paladin]]\n*[[Pentecostal Oath]]\n*[[Siege Perilous]] {{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes; Owen, D.

In the French-derived branch of Arthurian legend, the Knights are an order in the service of Arthur, tasked with ensuring the peace of the kingdom and charged with leading the quest for the [[Holy Grail]]. The [[Round Table]] at which they met was supposed to represent the equality of all the members.\n\nDifferent stories presented different numbers of the Knights, ranging from only 12 to as many as 150 or more. [[Bedivere]], [[Gawain]] and [[Sir Kay|Kay]] are the oldest characters associated with Arthur. Gawain was also one of those most popular, alongside [[Lancelot]], [[Percival]] and [[Tristan]], each of them featured as protagonist or eponymous hero in multiple works of the [[chivalric romance]] genre. Other well-known members of the order include [[Galahad]], the most perfect knight in the later tradition wherein he replaced Percival as achiever of the Grail, and the traitor [[Mordred]].\n\n== List ==\nTheir total number (always symbolic) and the names vary depending on the text. The first sources state 24, 36 or 72. For [[Robert de Boron]], for whom the [[Round Table]] is a replica of the table of the [[Last Supper]], they are fifty. In some versions, including ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' by [[Thomas Malory]], they are 150 (\"three times fifty\" is a phrase that is often found in Welsh or Irish texts, which means \"a large number\" or even \"immeasurable\").

Like his brothers [[Sir Tor|Tor]], [[Lamorak]], Dornar and [[Percival]], he is a Knight of the [[Round Table]]. In [[chivalric romance]]s, Aglovale never cuts as impressive a figure as his brothers Lamorak and Percival, but his valor is unquestioned. \n\nAccording to the [[Post-Vulgate Cycle|Post Vulgate Cycle]] and [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', it is he who first brings Percival to [[Camelot]] to be knighted. In the [[Vulgate Cycle]], Aglovale dies accidentally at [[Gawain]]'s hand during the Quest for the [[Holy Grail]]. However, in Malory he and his brother Tor are among the knights charged with defending the execution of [[Guinevere]] and are both killed when [[Lancelot]] and his men rescue the queen.\n\nAglovale appears prominently in the Dutch romance ''[[Morien]]''. In a situation similar to [[Gahmuret]]'s begetting of [[Feirefiz]] in [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]'s ''[[Parzival]]'', Aglovale visits [[Moors|Moorish]] lands where he meets a beautiful black Christian princess and conceives a child with her. He returns to his own lands, and thirteen years later, his son Morien comes to find him. After a number of adventures, father and son are reunited and both return to Morien's country to take back their rightful lands. \n\nIn modern works, Aglovale is the eponymous protagonist of [[Clemence Housman]]'s 1905 novel ''The Life of Sir Aglovale de Galis.'' [[T. H. White]]'s book ''[[The Once and Future King]]'' gives a particularly endearing portrait of the knight.\n\n=== Agravain ===\n{{main|Agravain}}\n\n=== Bagdemagus ===\n{{main|Bagdemagus}}\n\n=== Bedivere ===\n{{main|Bedivere}}\n\n=== Bors ===\n{{main|Bors}}\n\n=== Brunor ===\n{{main|Brunor}}\n\n=== Cador ===\n{{main|Cador}}\n\n===Calogrenant===\n'''Calogrenant''', sometimes known in English as '''Colgrevance''', is a cousin to [[Yvain]], and his courtesy and eloquence were known throughout the kingdom. Calogrenant first appears in [[Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes]]' ''[[Yvain, the Knight of the Lion]]''. After a good meal, Calogrenant tells a story to a group of knights and [[Queen Guinevere]] about an adventure he had in the forest of [[Broc\u00e9liande]]. He had heard of a magic spring in those woods which could create a huge storm whenever someone poured its water into a nearby basin. With directions from a local family and a gruesomely depicted giant, Calogrenant reached the spring and summoned the storm. Immediately after the storm, a knight named [[Esclados]] attacked him for causing such havoc. The knight soundly defeated Calogrenant, but did not kill him. Calogrenant's cousin Yvain is upset that Calogrenant never told him of this defeat, and sets out to avenge him, embarking on the adventure that sets up the remainder of events in the romance.\n\nHis character has been derived from the [[Welsh mythology|Welsh mythological]] hero [[Cynon ap Clydno]], usually the lover of [[Owain]]'s sister [[Morvydd]], although in ''[[Owain, or the Lady of the Fountain]]'' Cynon is stated to be the son of Clydno, possibly connected to [[Clyddno Eiddin]].<ref name=\"rl\">{{cite book|title=Arthurian Tradition and Chretien De Troyes|last=Loomis|first=Roger|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1949}}</ref> [[Roger Sherman Loomis]] and other scholars speculated that Calogrenant was used specifically as a foil for [[Sir Kay|Kay]] in some lost early version of the ''Yvain'' story. In Chr\u00e9tien's romance he is presented as everything Kay is not: polite, respectful, and well-mannered. By this theory, his name can be deconstructed to \"Cai lo grenant\", or \"Cai the grumbler\", which would represent another opposite characteristic of Kay, who was famous for his acid tongue.<ref name=\"rl\" />\n\nCalogrenant appears later in the [[Lancelot-Grail]] cycle as an excellent knight, though his kinship to Yvain is not as clear as in Chr\u00e9tien. He dies during the [[Grail Quest]] while trying to keep  [[Sir Lionel|Lionel]] from killing his own brother, [[Bors]]. Bors had faced a dilemma over whom to rescue between Lionel, who was getting beaten with thorns by two rogue knights, and a maiden who had just been abducted, and chose the maiden over his brother. Lionel was not pleased by this, and attacked Bors the next time he saw him. A religious [[hermit]] tried to intervene, but was killed accidentally in the process, and Calogrenant stepped in. Bors would not fight his brother, and Lionel slays Calogrenant and goes after Bors until God steps in and renders him immobile.\n\n[[Thomas Malory]] recounts Calogrenant's death scene in his ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', but also includes another one later in the narrative. Despite dying on the Grail quest, he turns up as one of the twelve knights who help [[Agravaine]] and [[Mordred]] trap [[Lancelot]] and Guinevere together. Lancelot has no armour or weapons, but manages to pull Calogrenant into the room and kills him, then uses his sword to defeat the rest of Mordred's companions.\n\n=== Caradoc ===\n{{main|Caradoc}}\n\n===Claudin===\n'''Prince Claudin''', also known as '''Claudin the Younger''' or '''Claudine''', is the son of the [[Franks|Frankish]] King [[Claudas]]. He appears in the [[Lancelot-Grail]] and in ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''. His father is a villain during [[King Arthur]]'s early reign, an enemy to Arthur's French allies [[King Ban|Ban]] and [[Bors]], but Claudin is a virtuous young man and wants no part of his father's schemes. Claudas eventually succumbs to Arthur and company, and Claudin seeks adventure elsewhere.\n\n=== Clig\u00e8s ===\n{{main|Clig\u00e8s}}\n\n=== Dagonet ===\n{{main|Dagonet}}\n\n=== Daniel ===\n{{main|Daniel von dem bl\u00fchenden Tal}}\n\n=== Dinadan ===\n{{main|Dinadan}}\n\n=== Elyan the White ===\n'''Elyan the White''' or '''Helyan le Blanc''' is the son of [[Bors]]. His mother is King Brandegoris' daughter Claire, who tricked Bors into sleeping with her using a magic ring; this is sometimes said to be the only time Bors broke his vow of chastity. When he is older Elyan is accepted as a member to the [[Round Table]], where he becomes known as an excellent knight. Like his father and the rest of his family, Elyan helps his cousin [[Lancelot]] rescue [[Guinevere]] after their affair is exposed and then joins him in exile. \n\nElyan's mother Claire is the half-sister of [[Sagramore]]; their mother is the daughter of the [[List of Byzantine Emperors|Eastern Roman Emperor]]. According to the [[Lancelot-Grail]] Cycle, Elyan eventually became Emperor of [[Constantinople]] himself.\n\nIn modern works, Elyan the White was portrayed as Guinevere's brother in the 2008 TV series ''[[Merlin (2008 TV series)|Merlin]]''. Appearing as just Elyan, he was played there by black actor [[Adetomiwa Edun]].\n\n===Erec===\n[[File:Hb-herec.jpg|thumb|upright|The attributed arms of \"Herec le fils Lac\"]]\n\n'''Erec''', the son of King Lac features in numerous Arthurian tales (notably the [[Post-Vulgate Cycle]]), but he is most famous as the protagonist in [[Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes]]' first romance, ''[[Erec and Enide]]''. Because of ''Erec and Enide''\u2018s relationship to the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''[[Geraint and Enid]]'', Erec and [[Geraint]] are often conflated or confused.\n\nIn Chr\u00e9tien's story, Erec meets his future wife [[Enide]] while on a quest to defeat a knight who had mistreated one of [[Guinevere]]'s servants. The two fall in love and marry, but rumours spread that Erec no longer cares for knighthood or anything else besides his domestic life. Enide cries about these rumours, causing Erec to prove his abilities, both to himself and to his wife, through a test of Enide's love for him. He has her go on a long, tortuous trip with him where she is forbidden to speak to him. She breaks his conditions several times to warn him of danger, and after a number of adventures that prove both his love and his abilities, husband and wife are reconciled. When Erec's father Lac dies, Erec inherits his kingdom.\n\n=== Esclabor ===\n[[File:Hb-exclabor.jpg|thumb|upright|The attributed arms of \"Exclabor ly Viescovtiens\"]]\n\n'''Esclabor''' is a pagan lord of [[Babylon]] or [[Galilee]] in Arthurian legend. He is the father of [[Palamedes (Arthurian legend)|Palamedes]], [[Safir (Arthurian legend)|Safir]], and [[Segwarides]], among others. While visiting [[Rome]], he saves the life of the [[Roman emperor|Roman Emperor]]. He then goes to Arthur's [[Logres]], where he saves the life of [[King Pellinore]]. He eventually retires to [[Camelot]], later adventuring with Palamedes and [[Galahad]] during the [[Holy Grail|Grail Quest]].\n\n=== Gaheris ===\n{{main|Gaheris}}\n\n=== Galahad ===\n{{main|Galahad}}\n\n=== Galehaut ===\n{{main|Galehaut}}\n\n=== Galeschin ===\n'''Galeschin''' (or '''Galeshin''') is a nephew of [[King Arthur]], son of the king's half-sister [[Elaine (legend)#Elaine_of_Garlot|Elaine]] and King [[Budic II of Brittany|Nentres of Garlot]]. He appears in the story of the ''Dolorous Tower'' in the [[Lancelot-Grail|Vulgate Cycle]], as he and his cousin [[Yvain]] attempt to rescue [[Gawain]] from the wicked Carados but are taken captive as well; the trio are eventually rescued by [[Lancelot]]. Galeschin is referred to as the [[Duke of Clarence]],<ref>Loomis (1997), p. 63</ref> an [[anachronism]] as the duchy of Clarence was not created until 1362. Though mentioned in a few other Arthurian stories, Galeschin's role is ultimately minor.\n\n[[Roger Sherman Loomis]] derives the name Galeschin from the name ''Galvariun'', found on the [[Modena Archivolt]]. He theorises that the name was altered to make it sound more like ''Galesche'', the Old French word for [[Gaul]], and derives the name Galvariun from the epithet ''Gwallt Euryn'', found in ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', which he translates as \"golden hair\".\n\n=== Gareth ===\n{{main|Gareth}}\n\n=== Gawain ===\n{{main|Gawain}}\n\n=== Geraint ===\n{{main|Geraint}}\n\n=== Gingalain ===\n{{main|Gingalain}}\n\n===Gornemant===\n'''Gornemant''' was [[Percival]]'s mentor. He is mentioned in a few early romances, but achieves prominence in ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail]]'', where he instructs the young hero in the ways of [[knighthood]]. Gornemant's niece is [[Blanchefleur]], whom Percival later marries after successfully defending her city against attackers.\n\nIn modern works, his character became famous as '''Gurnemanz''' in [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera ''[[Parsifal]]'', in which he is one of the main Grail Knights.\n\n=== Griflet ===\n{{main|Griflet}}\n\n===Hector de Maris===\n[[File:Blason Hector des mares.svg|thumb|upright|The attributed arms of Hector des Mares]]\n\n'''Hector de Maris''' (or '''Ector de Maris''', '''Hector des Mares''') is the younger half-brother of [[Lancelot]] and the [[Illegitimacy|natural son]] of [[King Ban]] of Benwick and the Lady de Maris; [[Sir Bors|Bors]] and [[Sir Lionel|Lionel]] are his cousins. He should not be mistaken with [[Sir Ector|Ector]], the father of [[Sir Kay|Kay]] and foster father of [[King Arthur|Arthur]].\n\nHector's adventures in the name of [[King Arthur]] were many and wide-ranging. With Morganore, it was Hector de Maris who welcomed [[Tristan]] to [[Camelot]] when he was shipwrecked nearby. The two jousted in a friendly competition, but Hector was ashamed to have been beaten by a knight of [[Cornwall]]. Other times he was more successful at tournaments, getting the better of both [[Palomides]] and [[Percivale]]. He, however, failed to defeat Turquine and became one of the knights he imprisoned before being rescued by his brother, [[Lancelot]]. He returned the favour by rediscovering the lost Knight of the Lake after his period of insanity and returning him to the court. He is known to have had a long relationship with Lady Perse of the Narrow Borderland, whose fianc\u00e9 he murdered in order to be with her. Hector later had an affair with the cousin of the Lady of Roestoc, before being reunited with Perse.\n\nHector also participates in the [[Grail Quest]], but he is one of the many knights who prove unworthy of achieving the object. In the ''Quest du Saint Graal'' of the [[Vulgate Cycle]], Hector and [[Gawain]] are travelling together when they experience a vision of what [[Jessie Weston]] called an \"unintelligent\" variation on the theme of the perilous Black Hand in other romances in the Grail Cycle.<ref>[[Jessie Weston|Weston, Jessie L.]] ''From Ritual to Romance'' 1920 [http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/frr/frr16.htm#fn_263 Chapter XIII The Perilous Chapel].</ref>\n\nWhen Lancelot is caught in his affair with [[Guinevere]], Hector stands by his brother and leaves court with him. He becomes one of the top leaders of Lancelot's faction, participating in the battle to rescue the queen at her execution, and the defence of Lancelot's castle [[Joyous Guard]]. Like all his family, he joins Lancelot in France when they are expelled from Arthur's kingdom, and he helps defeat the army led by [[Mordred]]'s sons after the [[Battle of Camlann]] (Salisbury). He then joins his brother at the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]'s hermitage and apparently dies there.\n\n=== Hoel ===\n{{main|Hoel}}\n\n=== Kay ===\n{{main|Sir Kay}}\n\n=== Lamorak ===\n{{main|Lamorak}}\n\n=== Lancelot ===\n{{main|Lancelot}}\n\n=== Lanval ===\n{{main|Lanval}}\n\n=== Lionel ===\n{{main|Sir Lionel}}\n\n===Lucan===\n[[File:Hb-lvcam-le-bovteillier.jpg|thumb|upright|The attributed arms of \"Lucam le Bovteillier\"]]\n\n'''Lucan the Butler''' is a servant of [[King Arthur]] and the son of Duke Corneus, brother to [[Bedivere]] and cousin to [[Griflet]]. He and his relatives are among Arthur's earliest allies in the fight against the rebel kings such as [[King Lot|Lot]], [[Urien]] and [[Caradoc]], and remained one of Arthur's loyal companions throughout his life. \n\nLucan was a solid and reliable Knight of the [[Round Table]] and one of King Arthur's earliest companions. He took on the post of royal butler \u2013 an important position in charge of the royal household rather than a serving man. The duties of a \"[[butler]]\" have changed over time; Lucan was supposed to have been in charge of the royal court, along with Bedivere the [[Marshal]] and [[Sir Kay|Kay]] the [[Seneschal]]. He valiantly defended Arthur's right to the throne at the Battle of Bedegraine and against subsequent rebellions. Though he sought adventure, he never came to the fore in Arthurian tales with renowned exploits of his own. He always attended the royal tournaments and was once hurt so badly by [[Tristan|Tristram]] that [[Yvain]] had to escort him to [[Gannes]] Abbey for medical assistance.\n\nIn most accounts of Arthur's death, from the [[Lancelot-Grail]] cycle to ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', Lucan is one of the last knights at the king's side at the [[Battle of Camlann]] and is usually the last of them to die. Lucan remained loyal to King Arthur throughout the schism with [[Lancelot]] and on occasion acted as their go-between. Similarly, he stayed by the monarch's side during [[Mordred]]'s rebellion and tried to dissuade Arthur from his final attack on his son/nephew, but was unsuccessful and the King received his mortal wound. Gravely wounded himself, Lucan was one of the few knights left at Camlann, along his brother, Bedivere. Worried about looters on the battlefield, Lucan and Bedivere attempts to move the dying Arthur into a nearby chapel for safety, but the strain is too much for Lucan as a severe wound bursts open, spilling out his bowels; he dies from his own wounds just before the king returns [[Excalibur]] to the [[Lady of the Lake]] and sails off for [[Avalon]]. Though the knight Arthur asks to cast the sword into the lake is usually Griflet (Lancelot-Grail) or Bedivere (''Le Morte d'Arthur'', the [[Alliterative Morte Arthure|Alliterative ''Morte Arthure'']], the [[Stanzaic Morte Arthur|Stanzaic ''Morte Arthur'']]), the 16th-century English ballad ''King Arthur's Death'' ascribes this duty to Lucan.<ref>\"King Arthur's Death\" is a continuation of the ballad \"The Legend of King Arthur\". See Noble, James (1991). \"King Arthur's Death\". In [[Lacy, Norris J.]] (Ed.), ''The New Arthurian Encyclopedia'', pp. 262\u2013263.

He is a young boy found and cared for by Arthur's warrior [[Dagonet]].\n\n=== Meliant de Lis ===\n[[File:Hb-meliandris.jpg|thumb|upright|The attributed arms of \"Mellienderis\"]]\n\n'''Meliant de Lis''' (variants include '''Melianz''', '''Melians '''and '''Melyans''') is a minor character in several [[Arthurian]] romances. In ''Livre de Artus'', [[Gawain]]'s lover Floree marries Melianz de Lis. In the Vulgate ''Lancelot'', the second romance of the [[Lancelot-Grail|Vulgate Cycle]], Carados of the Dolorous Tower takes Melyans le Gai's wife as his mistress.<ref>Loomis (1997). p. 11</ref> In ''Queste'', the third romance of the cycle, [[Galahad]], [[Bors]] and [[Percival]] are joined at Castle [[Corbenic]] by nine other knights, one of whom is Melians de Danemarche.<ref>Loomis (1997). p. 157</ref>\n\n=== Mordred ===\n{{main|Mordred}}\n\n=== Moriaen ===\n{{main|Moriaen}}\n\n=== Morholt ===\n'''Morholt''' (also called ''Marhalt'', ''Marhault'', ''Morold'', ''Marhaus'' and other variations) is an Irish warrior who demands tribute from [[Mark of Cornwall|King Mark]] of [[Cornwall]] until he is slain by [[Tristan]], Mark's nephew and defender. In many versions of the legend, Morholt's name is prefaced with a [[Article (grammar)|definite article]] (i.e. ''The'' Morholt) as if it were a rank or a title, but scholars have found no reason for this.<ref name=\"Curtis1\">Curtis, Ren\u00e9e L. (translator) (1994). The Romance of Tristan, Oxford. {{ISBN|0-19-282792-8}}.</ref> \n\nHe appears in almost all versions of the legend of [[Tristan and Iseult]], beginning with the verse works of [[Thomas of Britain]] and [[B\u00e9roul]]. In the early material, Morholt is the brother of the Queen of Ireland and the uncle of Tristan's future love (both mother and daughter are named [[Iseult]]). He comes to Cornwall to collect tribute owed to his country, but Tristan agrees to battle the champion on the remote [[Samson of Dol|Saint Samson's]] Isle in order to release his people from the debt. Tristan mortally wounds Morholt, leaving a piece of his sword in the Irishman's skull, but Morholt stabs him with a poisoned spear and escapes to Ireland to die. The injured Tristan eventually travels to Ireland incognito to receive healing from the Iseult the Younger, but is found out when the queen discovers the piece of metal found in her brother's head fits perfectly into a chink in Tristan's blade.\n\nThe authors of later romances expanded Morholt's role; in works like the [[Prose Tristan|Prose ''Tristan'']], the [[Post-Vulgate Cycle]], and [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', he is a Knight of the [[Round Table]] before his fateful encounter with Tristan. The prose romances add many more details to Morholt's career; the Post-Vulgate and Malory record his adventures with the young [[Gawain]] and [[Yvain]] early in [[King Arthur]]'s reign. In the later versions, Tristan takes Morholt's place at the Round Table when he joins the company himself.\n\n=== Palamedes ===\n{{main|Palamedes (Arthurian legend)}}\n\n=== Pelleas ===\n{{main|Pelleas}}\n\n=== Pellinore ===\n{{main|Pellinore}}\n\n=== Percival ===\n{{main|Percival}}\n\n=== Priamus ===\n'''Priamus''' is a Roman ally of Emperor Lucius in [[Thomas Malory]]'s [[Le Morte d'Arthur|''Le Morte d'Arthur.'']] He claims to be descended from [[Alexander of Africa]] and [[Judas Maccabeus]]. Upon meeting Gawain in ''[[The Tale of King Arthur and Emperor Lucius]]'', he betrays Lucius to join forces with [[King Arthur]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Le Morte Arthur|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783111392165-002|work=Le morte Arthur|publisher=DE GRUYTER|isbn=978-3-11-139216-5|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref>\n\n=== Safir ===\n'''Safir''' is the youngest son of the [[Saracen]] king [[Esclabor]] in the [[Arthurian legend]]. He is a courageous and loyal knight and was, in his time, a fairly popular character, showing up in the [[Prose Tristan|Prose ''Tristan'']] and [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''. His name is included on the [[Winchester Round Table]]. Both his brothers, [[Segwarides]] and [[Palamedes (Arthurian legend)|Palamedes]], also belong to the Round Table. \n\nSafir appears in many works of Arthurian literature, usually alongside his brother Palamedes. Though he is a younger brother, Safir converted to Christianity some time before Palamedes. In one story, Safir is disguised as [[Ector de Maris]] and fights with Helior le Preuse, defeats him, and wins Espinogres' lady. Vowing to defend the lady's honour, Palamedes arrives on the scene, and locks sword with Safir, not realising it is his brother. After fighting for an hour, both are impressed with each other's prowess and skill, and decide to ask the other's identity. Safir is devastated to find that he was fighting with his own brother and asks Palamedes for forgiveness; together, they return the lady to Espinogres. When the affair between [[Lancelot]] and [[Guinevere]] is exposed, Safir and Palamedes join Lancelot's side in the ensuing civil war between Lancelot and [[King Arthur]]. When they are banished to Lancelot's homeland in [[Gaul]], Safir is made Duke of [[Languedoc|Landok]] while Palamedes becomes Duke of [[Provence]].\n\n=== Sagramore ===\n{{main|Sagramore}}\n\n=== Segwarides ===\n[[File:Hb-securades.jpg|thumb|upright|The attributed arms of \"Securades\"]]\n\n[[File:Sir Segwarides rides ater Sir Tristram.png|thumb|Tristan and Segwarides (1912)|left]]\n\n'''Segwarides''' is a [[Vassal|liegeman]] of [[King Mark]] who is cuckolded by [[Tristan]] in the [[Prose Tristan|Prose ''Tristan'']] and [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''. Malory also lists a knight of this name as a son of the [[Saracen]] king [[Esclabor]], his brothers being [[Palamedes (Arthurian legend)|Palamedes]] and [[Safir (Arthurian legend)|Safir]]; it seems there were originally two characters of this name, but the stories in which they appear fail to differentiate between them.\n\nIn Malory, Tristan has a brief affair with Segwarides' wife, and wounds the knight after being found out. Tristan encounters Segwarides later on the Isle of Servage. Segwardies forgives the more famous knight saying he \"will never hate a noble knight for a light lady\" and the two team up to avoid the dangers of the isle. Soon afterwards, Tristan makes Segwarides the Lord of Servage. Segwarides is eventually killed trying to repel [[Lancelot]]'s rescue of [[Guinevere]] from the stake.\n\n=== Tor ===\n[[File:Blason Tor.svg|thumb|upright|The attributed arms of Tor]]\n\n'''Tor''' appears frequently in Arthurian literature. In earlier mentions Tor's father is King Ars or Aries,<ref>For example, [[Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes]]' list of knights in ''[[Erec and Enide]]''. From Owen, ''Arthurian Romances''.</ref> but the [[Post-Vulgate Cycle]] and [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' say this man is his adoptive father while his natural father is [[King Pellinore]].<ref>Lacy, ''Lancelot-Grail'', volume 4.</ref><ref>Malory, ''Le Morte d'Arthur'', Book III, ch. IV, p. 83.</ref> \n\nIn the Post-Vulgate and Malory, Tor is brother to [[Aglovale]], [[Lamorak]], Dornar, [[Percival]], and [[Dindrane]]. He is born when Pellinore sleeps with his mother \"half by force\", and she marries Aries shortly afterward; here Aries is not a king, but a [[shepherd]]. Tor and his twelve half-brothers are raised as shepherds, but Tor dreams of being a [[knight]]. Finally his parents take him to [[King Arthur]]'s court, and Arthur makes the boy one of his first knights. Later [[Merlin]] reveals Tor's true parentage, and Pellinore embraces his son; neither Aries nor his wife seem offended. Tor distinguishes himself at the wedding feast of Arthur and [[Guinevere]] when he takes up a quest to retrieve a mysterious white [[Scent hound|brachet]] hound that had come into the court. According to Malory, Tor and his brother Aglovale are among the knights charged with defending the execution of Guinevere and they both die when [[Lancelot]] and his followers rescue the queen.<ref>Malory, ''Le Morte d'Arthur'', Book XX, ch. VII, p. 880.</ref>\n\n=== Tristan ===\n{{main|Tristan}}\n\n=== Urien ===\n{{main|Urien}}\n\n=== Yvain ===\n{{main|Yvain}}\n\n=== Yvain the Bastard ===\n[[File:Hb-yvain-avoultres.jpg|thumb|upright|The attributed arms of Yvain the Adventurous]]\n\n'''Yvain the Bastard''', also called '''Ywain the Adventurous''', is a son of [[Urien|King Urien]] of Gore. He is often confused with his half-brother [[Yvain]], after whom he was named; while the older Yvain is the child of Urien and his wife [[Morgan le Fay]], King Urien sired Yvain the Bastard on the wife of his [[seneschal]]. \n\nHe is encountered frequently in Arthurian romance as a hearty and sensible warrior. His death comes at the hands of his cousin [[Gawain]] during the Quest for the [[Holy Grail]]. The two meet, disguised by their armour, and decide to joust. Yvain is mortally wounded, and it is not until Gawain takes him to a hermitage for his last rites that he realises he has killed his own cousin.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Arthurian characters]]\n*[[Paladin]]\n*[[Pentecostal Oath]]\n*[[Siege Perilous]] {{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes; Owen, D.

{"title_page": "Formula One video games", "text_new": "{{Formula One|lists}}\nEver since ''[[Pole Position]]'' in 1983, '''[[Formula One]]''' has always played a part of the racing genre in '''[[video games]]'''. [[Geoff Crammond]]'s 1991 simulation ''[[Formula One Grand Prix (Geoff Crammond)|Grand Prix]]'' played an integral role in moving Formula One games from arcade games to being full simulations of the sport.\nPlatforms: [[Arcade game|Arcade]], [[SG-1000]], [[Intellivision]], [[ColecoVision]], [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Atari 7800]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[Game Boy]], [[Commodore 16]], [[Commodore Plus/4]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[MSX]], [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[PC DOS]], [[Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis]], [[Sega Game Gear]], [[TurboGrafx-16]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[Sega Master System]], [[Sega CD]], [[Sega Saturn]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Nintendo 64]], [[Dreamcast]], [[Game Boy Color]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[GameCube]], [[PlayStation Portable]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Wii]], [[Xbox 360]], [[iOS]], [[PlayStation Vita]], [[Nintendo 3DS]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Wii U]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], [[macOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[tvOS]], [[Linux]]\n\n==Early roots and arcade games==\nThe roots of Formula One games can be traced back to the 1970s, with arcade games such as ''[[Speed Race]]'' and ''[[Gran Trak 10]]'' which depicted F1-like cars going on a race track.\n\nHowever, the first successful Formula One game in arcade history was ''[[Pole Position (arcade game)|Pole Position]]'', by [[Namco]]. In Pole Position, the player has to complete a lap in a certain amount of time in order to qualify for a race at the [[Fuji Speedway|Fuji]] racetrack. After qualifying, the player had to face other cars in a championship race. The game was very successful and it spawned an official sequel, ''[[Pole Position II]]'', and an unofficial one, ''[[Final Lap]]''. After the success of ''Pole Position'', many similar games appeared in arcades (and later ported to home computers) such as ''[[TX-1]]''.\n\nDuring the late 1980s, arcades began being dropped in favour of home computer games. Late successful arcade games can be considered ''[[Super Sprint]]'', which uses the top view instead of the rear view of most games, and its sequel ''[[Championship Sprint]]''.\n\n==Dawn of the home computer era==\nThe first true Formula One racing [[simulator]]s were ''[[Chequered Flag (video game)|Chequered Flag]]'' and Geoff Crammond's ''[[Formula One Grand Prix (video game)|Formula One Grand Prix]]'' (''F1GP''). ''Chequered Flag'' featured fuel depletion and car damage, and a set of several real circuits. Previously, most racing games representing Formula One, such as [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]]'s ''[[Grand Prix Circuit (video game)|Grand Prix Circuit]]'' and [[Electronic Arts]]' ''Ferrari Formula One'', had been [[arcade game|arcade]]-style games, but ''F1GP'' paid more attention to the physics of the cars, in addition to innovative graphics and accurate rendering of the actual racing tracks. The game, released in [[1992 in video games|1992]], was based on the {{F1|1991}} season. Over the years, the game had sequels ''[[Grand Prix 2]]'', ''[[Grand Prix 3|3]]'', and ''[[Grand Prix 4|4]]'' (based on {{F1|1994}}, {{F1|1998}}, with a {{F1|2000}} update, and {{F1|2001}} respectively).\n\nThe [[Formula One Administration|F1 official license]] was also held by [[Ubisoft]] and later transferred to Electronic Arts, which published seasonal simulations and also ''[[F1 Challenge '99-'02]]''.\n\nA notable place on PC simulation games is held by [[Papyrus Design Group|Papyrus']] ''[[Grand Prix Legends]]'', which depicted the [[1967 Formula One season]] instead of the then-current season, like all other contemporaries. It recreates in a very accurate way the physics of the car and the feel of driving a real 1967 Formula One racer: for this, even after many years, it is still considered one of the most realistic games ever made. The game still has a vast popularity among video gamers, with many mods and original circuits being produced.\n\n==Console gaming==\nBeginning from the second part of the 1980s more games were being created for personal computers, which could guarantee an easier and less expensive development.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} Most of these games featured racetracks, cars and driver names similar to the real ones, but all modified slightly, since they did not have official licenses from [[FIA]]. Examples of this are ''[[Super Monaco GP]]'' (and its sequel ''[[Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II]]'', which had a license to display only [[Ayrton Senna]]'s name) or ''[[Nigel Mansell's World Championship]]'', but many other less known games had similar features.\n\nThe first half of the 1990s saw a growing in popularity of Formula One games, and many software houses began acquiring licences and display most real names and cars, for example ''[[F1 (Domark)|Formula One]]'' by [[Domark]], which featured most real tracks, drivers and teams.\n\nThe 3D graphics revolution started by ''Geoff Crammond's Grand Prix'' did not go unnoticed by the console market: some software houses began developing games in this style like [[Sega]] with its ''[[Virtua Racing]]'', and later [[Namco]] with ''[[Ace Driver: Victory Lap]]'' (which featured futuristic, F1-like cars).\n\nThe first 3D game to feature a full license was ''[[Formula 1 (video game)|Formula 1]]'', developed by [[Bizarre Creations]] and released on [[PlayStation]], the first game of the successful [[Formula One (video game series)|Formula One]] series. Despite the game being a mostly arcade game rather than a simulation, it was very well received; later the series moved towards a more realistic race approach. Other Formula One games released around the same time include [[EA Sports F1 Series]] and [[Video System]]/[[Nintendo]]'s ''[[F-1 World Grand Prix]]'' and ''[[F-1 World Grand Prix II]]''.\n\nWhile Formula One games in general are strict reproductions of the sport regardless of gameplay style, [[Codemasters]]' ''[[F1 Race Stars]]'' was the first to bring ''[[Mario Kart]]''-style gameplay to the setting, while their official license from FIA (which the company has held since 2009) allowed for the teams (complete with their respective sponsors) and drivers from that year's season to be given a cartoonish makeover.\n\n==Modern PC simulators==\nAs the trend towards [[Open-source software|open source]] software has increased, developers have realised that many video games users like to add their own features to the games, and many modern PC racing games have become easier to [[Mod (computer gaming)|mod]]. Games such as ''[[rFactor]]'', although not primarily a Formula One game, have become somewhat of a development stage. ''rFactor'' players can download several mods for various F1 seasons, including \"classic\" seasons such as {{F1|1955}} and {{F1|1979}}. The game's makers, [[Image Space Incorporated]], have worked with the [[BMW Sauber]] F1 team to introduce a realistic version of both the [[BMW Sauber F1.06|F1.06]] and [[BMW Sauber F1.07|F1.07]].\n\nSony had held an exclusive license to make Formula One games from 1996 until 2006. It is now held by [[Codemasters]], who have released games based around the {{F1|2009}} through {{F1|2019}} F1 seasons.\n\n==PS2 and PS3==\nAfter ''[[Formula 1 (video game)|Formula 1]]'' was released on [[PlayStation]] (PS1), F1 games were then taken over by [[PlayStation 2]] (PS2) and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]. The first being ''[[Formula One 2001 (video game)|Formula One 2001]]'' for the PS2, and PS1. In 2002, [[EA Sports]] released a video game called ''[[EA Sports F1 Series|F1 Career Challenge]]'' for PS2 and Xbox which runs from the 1999&ndash;2002 F1 season with all drivers from each season.\n\nIn 2003, ''[[Grand Prix Challenge]]'' was released by [[Krome Studios Melbourne|Melbourne House]] and published by [[Atari]]. It was well received by critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-2/grand-prix-challenge/critic-reviews|title=Grand Prix Challenge|work=metacritic.com|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref> Although unknown by most F1 gaming fans, it was praised for high quality graphics for its time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/03/27/grand-prix-challenge-review?page=2|title=Grand Prix Challenge Review|date=27 March 2003|work=ign.com|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''[[Formula One 06]]'' was released on PS2, [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] and Studio Liverpool released a new version for the [[PlayStation 3]] in early 2007 called ''[[Formula One Championship Edition]]''.\n\n[[Codemasters]] has released Formula One racing games for the 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and the 2014 seasons for the PlayStation 3.\n\n==Xbox 360==\nCodemasters after securing the Licence in 2008, created ''[[F1 2010 (video game)|F1 2010]]'' which was released on the [[Xbox 360]] for the first time. This is based on the [[2010 Formula One season|2010 season]], and features all the official drivers and circuits. The game was released in September 2010, and was also released on the PC and [[PlayStation 3]]. A sequel to the game - ''[[F1 2011 (video game)|F1 2011]]'' - was released in September 2011 and was updated to feature the new drivers and circuits in the [[2011 Formula One season]], upon which the game was based. The game was initially available for [[Xbox 360]], PC, [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation Vita]]. In November 2011, a version of the game was released for the handheld, [[Nintendo 3DS]].\n\n==PC mods==\nIn most PC racing games like ''[[rFactor]]'', ''[[Grand Prix 4]]'' and ''[[F1 Challenge '99-'02]]'', players can download mods that enable the game to replicate mostly all seasons of Formula One.\n\n== List ==\n{{Expand list|date=October 2011}}\n\nA '''list of Formula One video games''' that lists only those uses the F1 name, whether it is licensed by the [[Formula One Group]] or just F1 in name; is licensed by racing drivers and teams involved within the series otherwise featuring sprites that resemble a [[Formula One car]] in a way to get around licensing, featuring deliberately misspelt driver and team names; is named after a Grand Prix race that appear in the F1 calendar or those that features races that appear in the F1 calendar.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"1\" style=\"font-size:85%; text-align:center; width:auto;\"\n|-\n!\n!Platforms\n!Release Date\n!Developer / Publisher\n!Formula 1 Season\n|-\n| ''[[F-1 (arcade game)|F-1]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/arcade/arcade75.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120730112145/http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/arcade/arcade75.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 July 2012 |title=Atari Coin-Op/Arcade Systems |first=Curt |last=Vendel |work=atarimuseum.com |accessdate=1 December 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=f-1&page=detail&id=14081|title=F-1 other game by Atari, Inc.

1983, '''[[Formula One]]''' has always played a part of the racing genre in '''[[video games]]'''. [[Geoff Crammond]]'s 1991 simulation ''[[Formula One Grand Prix (Geoff Crammond)|Grand Prix]]'' played an integral role in moving Formula One games from arcade games to being full simulations of the sport.\nPlatforms: [[Arcade game|Arcade]], [[SG-1000]], [[Intellivision]], [[ColecoVision]], [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Atari 7800]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[Game Boy]], [[Commodore 16]], [[Commodore Plus/4]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[MSX]], [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[PC DOS]], [[Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis]], [[Sega Game Gear]], [[TurboGrafx-16]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[Sega Master System]], [[Sega CD]], [[Sega Saturn]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Nintendo 64]], [[Dreamcast]], [[Game Boy Color]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[GameCube]], [[PlayStation Portable]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Wii]], [[Xbox 360]], [[iOS]], [[PlayStation Vita]], [[Nintendo 3DS]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Wii U]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], [[macOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[tvOS]], [[Linux]]\n\n==Early roots and arcade games==\nThe roots of Formula One games can be traced back to the 1970s, with arcade games such as ''[[Speed Race]]'' and ''[[Gran Trak 10]]'' which depicted F1-like cars going on a race track.\n\nHowever, the first successful Formula One game in arcade history was ''[[Pole Position (arcade game)|Pole Position]]'', by [[Namco]]. In Pole Position, the player has to complete a lap in a certain amount of time in order to qualify for a race at the [[Fuji Speedway|Fuji]] racetrack. After qualifying, the player had to face other cars in a championship race. The game was very successful and it spawned an official sequel, ''[[Pole Position II]]'', and an unofficial one, ''[[Final Lap]]''. After the success of ''Pole Position'', many similar games appeared in arcades (and later ported to home computers) such as ''[[TX-1]]''.\n\nDuring the late 1980s, arcades began being dropped in favour of home computer games. Late successful arcade games can be considered ''[[Super Sprint]]'', which uses the top view instead of the rear view of most games, and its sequel ''[[Championship Sprint]]''.\n\n==Dawn of the home computer era==\nThe first true Formula One racing [[simulator]]s were ''[[Chequered Flag (video game)|Chequered Flag]]'' and Geoff Crammond's ''[[Formula One Grand Prix (video game)|Formula One Grand Prix]]'' (''F1GP''). ''Chequered Flag'' featured fuel depletion and car damage, and a set of several real circuits. Previously, most racing games representing Formula One, such as [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]]'s ''[[Grand Prix Circuit (video game)|Grand Prix Circuit]]'' and [[Electronic Arts]]' ''Ferrari Formula One'', had been [[arcade game|arcade]]-style games, but ''F1GP'' paid more attention to the physics of the cars, in addition to innovative graphics and accurate rendering of the actual racing tracks. The game, released in [[1992 in video games|1992]], was based on the {{F1|1991}} season. Over the years, the game had sequels ''[[Grand Prix 2]]'', ''[[Grand Prix 3|3]]'', and ''[[Grand Prix 4|4]]'' (based on {{F1|1994}}, {{F1|1998}}, with a {{F1|2000}} update, and {{F1|2001}} respectively).\n\nThe [[Formula One Administration|F1 official license]] was also held by [[Ubisoft]] and later transferred to Electronic Arts, which published seasonal simulations and also ''[[F1 Challenge '99-'02]]''.\n\nA notable place on PC simulation games is held by [[Papyrus Design Group|Papyrus']] ''[[Grand Prix Legends]]'', which depicted the [[1967 Formula One season]] instead of the then-current season, like all other contemporaries. It recreates in a very accurate way the physics of the car and the feel of driving a real 1967 Formula One racer: for this, even after many years, it is still considered one of the most realistic games ever made. The game still has a vast popularity among video gamers, with many mods and original circuits being produced.\n\n==Console gaming==\nBeginning from the second part of the 1980s more games were being created for personal computers, which could guarantee an easier and less expensive development.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} Most of these games featured racetracks, cars and driver names similar to the real ones, but all modified slightly, since they did not have official licenses from [[FIA]]. Examples of this are ''[[Super Monaco GP]]'' (and its sequel ''[[Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II]]'', which had a license to display only [[Ayrton Senna]]'s name) or ''[[Nigel Mansell's World Championship]]'', but many other less known games had similar features.\n\nThe first half of the 1990s saw a growing in popularity of Formula One games, and many software houses began acquiring licences and display most real names and cars, for example ''[[F1 (Domark)|Formula One]]'' by [[Domark]], which featured most real tracks, drivers and teams.\n\nThe 3D graphics revolution started by ''Geoff Crammond's Grand Prix'' did not go unnoticed by the console market: some software houses began developing games in this style like [[Sega]] with its ''[[Virtua Racing]]'', and later [[Namco]] with ''[[Ace Driver: Victory Lap]]'' (which featured futuristic, F1-like cars).\n\nThe first 3D game to feature a full license was ''[[Formula 1 (video game)|Formula 1]]'', developed by [[Bizarre Creations]] and released on [[PlayStation]], the first game of the successful [[Formula One (video game series)|Formula One]] series. Despite the game being a mostly arcade game rather than a simulation, it was very well received; later the series moved towards a more realistic race approach. Other Formula One games released around the same time include [[EA Sports F1 Series]] and [[Video System]]/[[Nintendo]]'s ''[[F-1 World Grand Prix]]'' and ''[[F-1 World Grand Prix II]]''.\n\nWhile Formula One games in general are strict reproductions of the sport regardless of gameplay style, [[Codemasters]]' ''[[F1 Race Stars]]'' was the first to bring ''[[Mario Kart]]''-style gameplay to the setting, while their official license from FIA (which the company has held since 2009) allowed for the teams (complete with their respective sponsors) and drivers from that year's season to be given a cartoonish makeover.\n\n==Modern PC simulators==\nAs the trend towards [[Open-source software|open source]] software has increased, developers have realised that many video games users like to add their own features to the games, and many modern PC racing games have become easier to [[Mod (computer gaming)|mod]]. Games such as ''[[rFactor]]'', although not primarily a Formula One game, have become somewhat of a development stage. ''rFactor'' players can download several mods for various F1 seasons, including \"classic\" seasons such as {{F1|1955}} and {{F1|1979}}. The game's makers, [[Image Space Incorporated]], have worked with the [[BMW Sauber]] F1 team to introduce a realistic version of both the [[BMW Sauber F1.06|F1.06]] and [[BMW Sauber F1.07|F1.07]].\n\nSony had held an exclusive license to make Formula One games from 1996 until 2006. It is now held by [[Codemasters]], who have released games based around the {{F1|2009}} through {{F1|2019}} F1 seasons.\n\n==PS2 and PS3==\nAfter ''[[Formula 1 (video game)|Formula 1]]'' was released on [[PlayStation]] (PS1), F1 games were then taken over by [[PlayStation 2]] (PS2) and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]. The first being ''[[Formula One 2001 (video game)|Formula One 2001]]'' for the PS2, and PS1. In 2002, [[EA Sports]] released a video game called ''[[EA Sports F1 Series|F1 Career Challenge]]'' for PS2 and Xbox which runs from the 1999&ndash;2002 F1 season with all drivers from each season.\n\nIn 2003, ''[[Grand Prix Challenge]]'' was released by [[Krome Studios Melbourne|Melbourne House]] and published by [[Atari]]. It was well received by critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-2/grand-prix-challenge/critic-reviews|title=Grand Prix Challenge|work=metacritic.com|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref> Although unknown by most F1 gaming fans, it was praised for high quality graphics for its time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/03/27/grand-prix-challenge-review?page=2|title=Grand Prix Challenge Review|date=27 March 2003|work=ign.com|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''[[Formula One 06]]'' was released on PS2, [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] and Studio Liverpool released a new version for the [[PlayStation 3]] in early 2007 called ''[[Formula One Championship Edition]]''.\n\n[[Codemasters]] has released Formula One racing games for the 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and the 2014 seasons for the PlayStation 3.\n\n==Xbox 360==\nCodemasters after securing the Licence in 2008, created ''[[F1 2010 (video game)|F1 2010]]'' which was released on the [[Xbox 360]] for the first time. This is based on the [[2010 Formula One season|2010 season]], and features all the official drivers and circuits. The game was released in September 2010, and was also released on the PC and [[PlayStation 3]]. A sequel to the game - ''[[F1 2011 (video game)|F1 2011]]'' - was released in September 2011 and was updated to feature the new drivers and circuits in the [[2011 Formula One season]], upon which the game was based. The game was initially available for [[Xbox 360]], PC, [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation Vita]]. In November 2011, a version of the game was released for the handheld, [[Nintendo 3DS]].\n\n==PC mods==\nIn most PC racing games like ''[[rFactor]]'', ''[[Grand Prix 4]]'' and ''[[F1 Challenge '99-'02]]'', players can download mods that enable the game to replicate mostly all seasons of Formula One.\n\n== List ==\n{{Expand list|date=October 2011}}\n\nA '''list of Formula One video games''' that lists only those uses the F1 name, whether it is licensed by the [[Formula One Group]] or just F1 in name; is licensed by racing drivers and teams involved within the series otherwise featuring sprites that resemble a [[Formula One car]] in a way to get around licensing, featuring deliberately misspelt driver and team names; is named after a Grand Prix race that appear in the F1 calendar or those that features races that appear in the F1 calendar.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"1\" style=\"font-size:85%; text-align:center; width:auto;\"\n|-\n!\n!Platforms\n!Release Date\n!Developer / Publisher\n!Formula 1 Season\n|-\n| ''[[F-1 (arcade game)|F-1]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/arcade/arcade75.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120730112145/http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/arcade/arcade75.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 July 2012 |title=Atari Coin-Op/Arcade Systems |first=Curt |last=Vendel |work=atarimuseum.com |accessdate=1 December 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=f-1&page=detail&id=14081|title=F-1 other game by Atari, Inc.

Ethel Hallow makes a good first impression on the teachers. Mildred helps Maud, whose glasses were broken in the crash, get to school, but they both crash-land in the pond.

In order to get her cat back, Bea uses magic scissors to create a vanishment hole, but everything that has gone into vanishment reappears and Esper's show goes ahead, though the students are amazed that Miss Bat is Esper. Sybil, Clarice and Bea struggle to keep the vanished things away and when Ollie performs as a girl, he receives praise from The Great Wizard, but he is horrified when he finds out it is Ollie. Mildred makes a point about gender equality and uses a staff to prevent The Great Wizard being attacked by the vanished things, which prompts The Great Wizard to allow Ollie to have chanting lessons.

The next day, an emotion potion made by Mildred, Maud and Enid ends up in the drinks of all the staff when it was just intended for Miss Bat to help her and Mr Rowan-Webb make up. The potion works on Miss Mould when she begins to fall for Mr Rowan-Webb and Ethel presents Esmerelda with the school founding stone to help get her powers back. Mildred, Maud, Enid and Felicity realise they have to keep Mr Rowan-Webb away from the teachers and Ethel tells Esmerelda that the founding stone that was returned was a clone made by her. Miss Hardbroom begins to fall for Mr Rowan-Webb when Enid fails to distract her away from him, as does Miss Drill whilst Ethel explains how she cloned the stone, but Esmerelda refuses to take the powers. Miss Bat makes amends with him when the potion begins to work on her and Mr Rowan-Webb falls for himself upon seeing his reflection, so Mildred and Maud get him into a classroom by using his reflection. Esmerelda takes Mildred up on her offer on advice on normal schools, giving Ethel the importunity to put in place a spell to trap Esmerelda in her room with the founding stone. Maud fails to keep the staff away from Mr Rowan-Webb, but Mildred is able to warn Miss Cackle about the situation in time for her to negate the spell. Sybil goes into Ethel's room and is scared to be trapped in and Esmerelda is annoyed that Ethel's kindness towards her is to gain their mum's approval.

Miss Cackle allows the pupils to play magical tricks on the staff without fear on Halloween. Esmerelda and Sybil recall a bedtime story from when they were younger about one of their ancestors reigniting her coven's stone, so using the Hallow family tree, Mildred asks for the Hallow responsible for that to come forward and tell them what to do, but they fly away. Miss Hardbroom struggles to get Miss Mould's references from the school she used to teach at while Mildred, Maud, Enid and Ethel try to get the answers out the Hallow ancestors. When they find the Hallow who reignited the stone, the Hallow tells them she just took credit for it. Clarice and Beatrice are convinced the magic in the school has gone haywire and eventually Esmerelda and Sybil are forced to admit that Esmerelda has got her magic back by taking it from the Stone. When Miss Drill notices the school is freezing, Miss Cackle evacuates the school, but she, Miss Hardbroom, Maud, Enid and Felicity are trapped in the potions lab. Mildred returns to the family trees to get answers from the Hallows and the witch who actually reignited the Stone long ago emerges, who turns out to be Mildred's ancestor, Mirabelle Hubble. \n\n(The Big Freeze) Mirabelle explains that she had to sacrifice her magic as well as 12 descendants' magic to save the stone, and Mildred is her 13th descendant, the first magical Hubble for centuries. Mildred is delighted to find out that she is from a witching family after all. Whilst Mildred's mum Julie is in the park, she is told by her miniature self to go to Cackle's. In the potions lab, Felicity is suspended in a block of ice, so Miss Cackle, Maud and Enid give the rest of their magic to Miss Hardbroom to help Mildred, putting them into ice blocks. Mildred is unhappy about leaving the school, but Miss Mould tells her about a coven Mildred could go to, where she could be individual and creative. When Miss Hardbroom gets outside, it turns out that the founding stone is still in the school and the coven Miss Mould knows off is run by Agatha. Miss Mould's plan was to allow Agatha to escape the photograph once the Stone's magic failed. Mildred praises Miss Mould as a teacher before she is frozen herself. Ethel decides to sacrifice her magic to the stone, but she is too late as when she makes a speech, Miss Hardbroom, Esmerelda and Sybil are put into ice blocks, and then she is. Julie Hubble arrives at the school and gets Mildred out of her block; Mildred explains to her mum about their ancestor. Mildred decides to sacrifice her powers to the stone, but although she starts the process, Miss Mould, moved by what Mildred said to her, completes the ritual in her place and reignites the stone, losing her powers.

They tell Miss Hardbroom that Mildred was supposed to attend Pentangle's, but decided that Cackle's is better. Esmerelda Hallow, Ethel's older sister, gives the students a tour and Miss Cackle helps Mildred cope with the effects of a transfer spell. Mildred and Maud sneak off to look at the kittens and Ethel eavesdrops on them discussing how Mildred is not from a magical family. They lose a kitten, but find it in the kitchens. Later, Mildred struggles with the written exam. Miss Cackle encourages her to do what she is good at, but she only manages to get 1%, due to filling her paper with drawings instead of answers, as her best subject is art. Miss Cackle's twin sister, Agatha, turns up, and Miss Cackle gives her permission to speak to Miss Hardbroom for an internet article. The students make their potions and Mildred successfully manages to levitate, after taking some of Ethel's pondweed from her dragon potion (due to Ethel having taken all of it), making Ethel wrongly turn into a worm.\n\n'''First appearances''': [[Bella Ramsey]] as [[Mildred Hubble]], Meibh Campbell as Maud Spellbody, Jenny Richardson as [[Ethel Hallow]], Miriam Petche as Esmerelda Hallow, Tallulah Milligan as [[Drusilla Paddock]], Dagny Rollins as Felicity Foxglove, [[Clare Higgins]] as Miss Ada Cackle/Agatha Cackle, [[Raquel Cassidy]] as Miss Hecate Hardbroom, [[Wendy Craig]] as Miss Bat, [[Shauna Shim]] as Miss Drill, [[Kacey Ainsworth]] as Miss Gullet, [[Zita Sattar]] as Miss Tapioca and [[Nicola Stephenson]] as Julie Hubble\n\n'''Note''': Episode 1 and 2 aired in a 1 hour episode.\n|LineColor       = 69AFFF\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)\n|EpisodeNumber   = 3\n|EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n|Title           = Tabby\n|DirectedBy      = Brian Grant\n|WrittenBy       = Emma Reeves\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|1|18|df=y}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/cbbc/status/819213818|title=CBBC (@cbbc) - Twitter|website=twitter.com}}{{dead link|date=January 2018|fix-attempted=yes|bot=TweetCiteBot}}</ref>\n|Viewers         = 0.334\n|ShortSummary    = On their first day, Mildred's phone is confiscated by Miss Hardbroom.

She later reassures Miss Cackle and Mildred and Maud successfully disenchant Felicity, Miss Mould and Ethel and Ethel is angry with Mildred upon her return to school when she sees Esmerelda leaves with their dad.\n|LineColor       = #00BB00\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)\n|EpisodeNumber   = 21\n|EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n|Title           = Miss Cackle's Birthday\n|RTitle          = \n|DirectedBy      = Dermot Boyd\n|WrittenBy       = Matt Evans\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|2|26|df=y}}\n|Viewers         = 0.298\n|ShortSummary    = Maud is acting as director for Miss Cackle's show for her birthday, but Maud is miserable when her best act is not that good. When Sybil, Clarice and Bea practise their broom dance, Ethel has a go at Sybil and Miss Hardbroom shows Miss Cackle a newspaper article about the recent failings at Cackles. Miss Hardbroom magics the second year to the potion lab when they spend their lesson practising for their show and when Maud contemplates resigning as director, Mildred and Enid work on a happiness potion for Maud and when she takes it, Maud turns into a baby, the last time she was happy. Miss Hardbroom cancels potions class when Miss Cackle frets about the mistakes and believes she should quit; she also appoints Ethel as director in place of Maud. When baby Maud causes a mess, Miss Bat takes her when Enid tidies up and Ethel decides that the show will be an instrumentless orchestra instead of individual acts. Enid discovers baby Maud is in the potions lab when she magically transports herself to the pond and everyone walks out from the orchestra. Mildred confesses to Miss Cackle about Maud and when she summons Enid and baby Maud, she changes Maud back. At the show, Ethel's solo ocherstra fails to impress, so Mildred gets Sybil, Clarice and Bea to perform their broom dance, Felicity to dance and she, Maud and Enid perform a sketch as Miss Hardbroom, Miss Cackle and Miss Drill as well as performing the school song.

Mildred eavesdrops outside the staff room, where she overhears Miss Hardbroom telling the staff Miss Cackle has been summoned to a disciplinary hearing at the magic council and the school is being inspected by Miss Doomstone later that day. Mildred tells Maud and Enid and when Miss Bat falls asleep while covering potions class, Mildred, Maud and Enid sneak off to the magic council to show support for Miss Cackle. In the first years potion class, Miss Hardbroom upsets Sybil when she makes a mistake with her colour changing potion, causing her cauldron to explode, so Bea decides to make a personality changing potion for Miss Hardbroom. Mildred, Maud and Enid gain access into the magic council ground and hide as The Great Wizard points out Miss Cackle's failings. Bea gives Miss Hardbroom the potion, which works when Bea suggests the class have fun and Miss Hardbroom makes jokes at Ethel and Felicity. Mrs Hallow blames Miss Cackle for Esmerelda losing her powers while Miss Hardbroom lets the class sing their potion recipes as well as dismissing them early. Mrs Hallow presents a petition for parents asking Miss Cackle to be removed as headmistress and Mildred, Maud and Enid emerge, asking if they can speak in Miss Cackle's defence, which Mildred does. Sybil, Clarice and Bea work on an antidote, but Miss Hardbroom refuses to take it and after being held up, Miss Doomstone arrives to see Miss Hardbroom, but slips on frog gloop. Miss Doomstone is given a personality changing potion as Miss Hardbroom takes the antidote and Miss Doomstone informs everyone she has recommended that the school stays open.

Mildred, Maud and Enid are upset about the prospect of all going to different schools as Maud's parents are visiting Miss Amulet's Academy and Miss Cackle continues to look at the petition. Miss Pentangle is summoned to Miss Cackle's office and admits she has been asked to be headmistress at Cackles as well as Pentangles. Miss Pentangle impresses the first years with her modern chanting and gives Mildred a power boost in order to perform an invisibility spell in potions. Sybil faints in chanting after performing a chant with confidence and Mildred confides in Miss Pentangle over wanting to get Miss Cackle reinstated. Mildred sneaks off to Miss Cackle's office during chanting to see the petition when her classmates say their parents never signed and Miss Pentangle watches Miss Cackle help Sybil with her spells and potions when she becomes emotional after struggling. With Maud and Enid's help, Mildred makes a true author potion when Maud and Enid's signatures are on the petition and when they attempt to show Miss Hardbroom, Mildred burns the scroll as her powers are strong. The Great Wizard arrives at Cackles and Mildred tells him she believes the petition signatures are forged, so using the mists of time, they find out Mrs Hallow forged the signatures. Mrs Hallow is magicked to the school and Ethel is hurt that Mrs Hallow did it out of revenge for Esmerelda and she is sacked from the council while Miss Cackle is reinstated.\n\n'''Guest Starring''': Miss Pentangle\n\n|LineColor       = #00BB00\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)\n|EpisodeNumber   = 24\n|EpisodeNumber2  = 11\n|Title           = Love at First Sight\n|RTitle          = \n|DirectedBy      = Delyth Thomas\n|WrittenBy       = Claire Miller\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|3|19|df=y}}\n|Viewers         = 0.277\n|ShortSummary    = On Halloween, Mildred scares Maud and Enid and with Clarice and Bea, Sybil tells them about a ghoul in one of the turrets. The next day, an emotion potion made by Mildred, Maud and Enid ends up in the drinks of all the staff when it was just intended for Miss Bat to help her and Mr Rowan-Webb make up. The potion works on Miss Mould when she begins to fall for Mr Rowan-Webb and Ethel presents Esmerelda with the school founding stone to help get her powers back. Mildred, Maud, Enid and Felicity realise they have to keep Mr Rowan-Webb away from the teachers and Ethel tells Esmerelda that the founding stone that was returned was a clone made by her. Miss Hardbroom begins to fall for Mr Rowan-Webb when Enid fails to distract her away from him, as does Miss Drill whilst Ethel explains how she cloned the stone, but Esmerelda refuses to take the powers. Miss Bat makes amends with him when the potion begins to work on her and Mr Rowan-Webb falls for himself upon seeing his reflection, so Mildred and Maud get him into a classroom by using his reflection. Esmerelda takes Mildred up on her offer on advice on normal schools, giving Ethel the importunity to put in place a spell to trap Esmerelda in her room with the founding stone. Maud fails to keep the staff away from Mr Rowan-Webb, but Mildred is able to warn Miss Cackle about the situation in time for her to negate the spell. Sybil goes into Ethel's room and is scared to be trapped in and Esmerelda is annoyed that Ethel's kindness towards her is to gain their mum's approval. Esmerelda is forced to gain powers from the stone when Sybil has climbed out of the roof and on the verge of falling, which delights Ethel, but the stone dies.\n|LineColor       = #00BB00\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)\n|EpisodeNumber   = 25 <hr />26\n|EpisodeNumber2  = 12 <hr />13\n|Title           = All Hallow's Eve\n|AltTitle        = The Big Freeze\n|DirectedBy      = Delyth Thomas\n|WrittenBy       = Neil Jones\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|3|26|df=y}}\n|Viewers         = 0.414\n|ShortSummary    = (All Hallow's Eve) Esmerelda attempts to give the powers back to the stone, but fails. Miss Cackle allows the pupils to play magical tricks on the staff without fear on Halloween. Esmerelda and Sybil recall a bedtime story from when they were younger about one of their ancestors reigniting her coven's stone, so using the Hallow family tree, Mildred asks for the Hallow responsible for that to come forward and tell them what to do, but they fly away. Miss Hardbroom struggles to get Miss Mould's references from the school she used to teach at while Mildred, Maud, Enid and Ethel try to get the answers out the Hallow ancestors. When they find the Hallow who reignited the stone, the Hallow tells them she just took credit for it. Clarice and Beatrice are convinced the magic in the school has gone haywire and eventually Esmerelda and Sybil are forced to admit that Esmerelda has got her magic back by taking it from the Stone. When Miss Drill notices the school is freezing, Miss Cackle evacuates the school, but she, Miss Hardbroom, Maud, Enid and Felicity are trapped in the potions lab. Mildred returns to the family trees to get answers from the Hallows and the witch who actually reignited the Stone long ago emerges, who turns out to be Mildred's ancestor, Mirabelle Hubble. \n\n(The Big Freeze) Mirabelle explains that she had to sacrifice her magic as well as 12 descendants' magic to save the stone, and Mildred is her 13th descendant, the first magical Hubble for centuries. Mildred is delighted to find out that she is from a witching family after all. Whilst Mildred's mum Julie is in the park, she is told by her miniature self to go to Cackle's. In the potions lab, Felicity is suspended in a block of ice, so Miss Cackle, Maud and Enid give the rest of their magic to Miss Hardbroom to help Mildred, putting them into ice blocks. Mildred is unhappy about leaving the school, but Miss Mould tells her about a coven Mildred could go to, where she could be individual and creative. When Miss Hardbroom gets outside, it turns out that the founding stone is still in the school and the coven Miss Mould knows off is run by Agatha. Miss Mould's plan was to allow Agatha to escape the photograph once the Stone's magic failed. Mildred praises Miss Mould as a teacher before she is frozen herself. Ethel decides to sacrifice her magic to the stone, but she is too late as when she makes a speech, Miss Hardbroom, Esmerelda and Sybil are put into ice blocks, and then she is. Julie Hubble arrives at the school and gets Mildred out of her block; Mildred explains to her mum about their ancestor. Mildred decides to sacrifice her powers to the stone, but although she starts the process, Miss Mould, moved by what Mildred said to her, completes the ritual in her place and reignites the stone, losing her powers. The school is saved and later celebrates Halloween.\n|LineColor       = #00BB00\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n===Series 3 (2019)===\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#FF36FF |overall=6 |series=6 |title=30 |director=14 |writer=20 |airdate=14 |viewers=10 |country=UK | viewersR=<ref name=\"BARB2\">[https://www.barb.co.uk/viewing-data/four-screen-dashboard/ Weekly top programmes on four screens (from Sept 2018)] Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (BARB)</ref> |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)\n|EpisodeNumber   = 27\n|EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n|Title           = The Wishing Star\n|DirectedBy      = Dirk Campbell\n|WrittenBy       = Neil Jones\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|1|7|df=y}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/schedules/p00fzl9r/2019/01/07|title=BBC TV Guide|website=bbc.co.uk|access-date=9 January 2019}}</ref>\n|Viewers         = 0.279\n|ShortSummary    = Mildred enters the Great Wizard\u2019s broomstick-flying contest to win a Wishing Star so she can wish her Mum magical, but trouble arises when she competes with her new stray dog rather than Tabby.

The party was a splinter group of [[One Nation (Australia)|Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation]] (PHON). It was a socially conservative populist party on the right of the political spectrum and its policies were similar to that of the original One Nation party, advocating reduced immigration levels, an end to Australia\u2019s policy of multiculturalism and an end to what it perceives to be overly favourable treatment of Australian indigenous Aboriginal population.\n\nThe party arose as a result of internal divisions within PHON in October 2000 after [[Pauline Hanson]] expelled [[David Oldfield (politician)|David Oldfield]], co-founder of PHON and the sole representative of that party in the NSW State Parliament. At the 2000 NSW State Conference Hanson accused Oldfield of abusing his authority, usurping power and setting up alternative political parties under his control. His expulsion created even more instability in a party which was constantly embroiled in scandal and internal strife and the party saw a split in its NSW division. As a result, One Nation NSW was formed in 2001. The new party took advantage of electoral party registration laws to register itself as political party under the \u2018One Nation\u2019 name with the NSW electoral commission, and achieved registration in April, 2002. The effect of this was that the original PHON party was now unable to gain registration for NSW elections, and therefore any candidates which that party chose to represent them at state elections could not use the party name. Consequently, PHON could only contest Federal elections in NSW under the 'One Nation' banner, whilst the Oldfield group could present itself as 'One Nation' only at state elections.\n\nOne Nation NSW encountered some internal ruptures in 2002-2003 during the preselection process for the [[2003 New South Wales state election|March 2003 NSW election]]. [[Brian Burston]], (a former National Director of PHON) had been preselected by a party conference in December 2002 for 1st place on the party ticket, for the election to the Upper House, the [[New South Wales Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] (LC). Oldfield however, had intended that his wife [[Lisa Oldfield]], secure this position. He therefore summoned a second meeting of party members in January 2003, which saw a reversal of the December decision to give Burston the top spot on the ticket, in favour of Lisa Oldfield. Burston and his supporters filed legal action, and the court upheld the initial party decision of December, which gave Burston the leading position on the ticket.\n\nAt the March election, One Nation NSW achieved only 1.5% of the primary vote, compared to 6.3% for PHON in the previous [[1999 New South Wales state election|1999 election]] that saw Oldfield elected. This result was substantially below the 4.55% election quota, and consequently Burston failed to get elected. Apart from the internal feuding which affected the party\u2019s performance, was the fact that Pauline Hanson also ran in the election as a grouped independent, with support from what was left of PHON, and this fractured the One Nation vote. Hanson polled slightly better than Burston\u2019s group, achieving 1.9%, and narrowly missed gaining the last LC spot.\n\nAfter the 2003 election, One Nation NSW kept a very low profile. The party did not maintain a website and drew very little media attention. Consequently, many Australian political commentators weren't even aware that two separate One Nation parties continued to operate in NSW at this time. Oldfield resigned from the party in December 2004, to serve the remainder of his term as an independent. His term expired in March 2007.\n\nOne Nation NSW met all the necessary registration criteria to achieve registration for the [[2007 New South Wales state election|March 2007 NSW election]]. However, the party decided not to contest that election, and was deregistered shortly after the election. The party was disbanded shortly afterwards.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of political parties in Australia]]\n\n[[Category:Political parties established in 2002]]\n[[Category:Political parties in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:2002 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Political parties disestablished in 2007]]\n[[Category:2007 disestablishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Pauline Hanson's One Nation breakaway groups]]\n[[Category:Social conservative parties]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\n{{unreferenced|date=October 2007}}\n{{Infobox political party\n| name = One Nation NSW\n| logo = \n| colorcode = #F8F16F\n| leader = \n| president = \n| chairman = \n| general_secretary = \n| first_secretary = \n| secretary_general = \n| presidium = \n| secretary = \n| spokesperson = \n| foundation = {{start date|2000|10|08}}\n| dissolved = {{end date|2007}}\n| split = [[Pauline Hanson's One Nation]]\n| ideology = [[Australian nationalism]]<br>[[Protectionism]]<br>[[Social conservatism]]\n| position = [[Right-wing]]\n| headquarters = \n| international = \n| website = \n| country = Australia\n}}\n\n'''One Nation NSW''' was a minor [[Australia]]n political party, which operated exclusively in the state of [[New South Wales]] (NSW), in the early 2000's.

The game was first released in Japan by [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]] on June 21, 2001 and the following March in other territories as part of the [[Eidos Interactive]] \"Fresh Games\" label.\n\nThe player controls a [[mosquito]] named \"Mister Mosquito\", the game's title character, who has taken up residency in the house of the Yamada family, life-sized humans that serve as the protagonist's food source in the game. The goal of the game is to stock up on [[blood]] through the summer so that the mosquito will [[Hibernation|survive the winter]] ahead. The player is tasked with sucking blood from specific body parts of the family members without being noticed. If the player is not careful, the human will become stressed and eventually attack.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe gameplay revolves around one thing: sucking blood from the Yamada family while they go about their everyday business. However, the player can only suck from a designated body area which is only available at specific times. Each family member follows a set looping pattern of movements. By following these movements, the player must fill a quota of blood for each stage. The challenge in bloodsucking is that each victim has a \"stress meter\". The player must make sure that the victim stays unaware. Sucking too fast or too slow will increase the victim's stress level. If Mister Mosquito is swatted while sucking blood, instant death occurs. If the player is noticed by a victim while flying around, Battle Mode begins, played out like a boss battle. The victim tries to attack Mister Mosquito through various means. To calm them, the player must hit a number of [[pressure point]]s, relieving them of tension. Once they are relaxed enough, they return to their business.\n\nThe game is made up of a series of [[Level (video gaming)|stages]] which must be unlocked in order by completing each previous stage. Players can choose their own path though each stage. At the start of each stage is a briefing detailing the room where the stage takes place, the victim and area(s) on their body from which blood can be sucked, and any prevalent dangers.

The game was first released in Japan by [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]] on June 21, 2001 and the following March in other territories as part of the [[Eidos Interactive]] \"Fresh Games\" label.\n\nThe player controls a [[mosquito]] named \"Mister Mosquito\", the game's title character, who has taken up residency in the house of the Yamada family, life-sized humans that serve as the protagonist's food source in the game. The goal of the game is to stock up on [[blood]] through the summer so that the mosquito will [[Hibernation|survive the winter]] ahead. The player is tasked with sucking blood from specific body parts of the family members without being noticed. If the player is not careful, the human will become stressed and eventually attack.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe gameplay revolves around one thing: sucking blood from the Yamada family while they go about their everyday business. However, the player can only suck from a designated body area which is only available at specific times. Each family member follows a set looping pattern of movements. By following these movements, the player must fill a quota of blood for each stage. The challenge in bloodsucking is that each victim has a \"stress meter\". The player must make sure that the victim stays unaware. Sucking too fast or too slow will increase the victim's stress level. If Mister Mosquito is swatted while sucking blood, instant death occurs. If the player is noticed by a victim while flying around, Battle Mode begins, played out like a boss battle. The victim tries to attack Mister Mosquito through various means. To calm them, the player must hit a number of [[pressure point]]s, relieving them of tension. Once they are relaxed enough, they return to their business.\n\nThe game is made up of a series of [[Level (video gaming)|stages]] which must be unlocked in order by completing each previous stage. Players can choose their own path though each stage. At the start of each stage is a briefing detailing the room where the stage takes place, the victim and area(s) on their body from which blood can be sucked, and any prevalent dangers. The rooms in each stage are fully explorable. Each room has items hidden in obscure places which can bring various benefits.\n\n==Development==\n''Mister Mosquito'' was first announced in March 2001 just prior to the [[Tokyo Game Show]].

Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley identified the suspect as 57-year-old Lonnie David Franklin Jr., a mechanic who worked between 1981 and 1988 for the City of Los Angeles in the sanitation department and briefly for the LAPD.<ref name=msn/> Franklin was identified for arrest, at least in part, on [[DNA profiling#DNA evidence as evidence in criminal trials|familial DNA analysis]].<ref name=latimesblog>{{cite news |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/07/lapd-make-arrest-in-grim-sleeper-serial-killings.html |title=LAPD make arrest in Grim Sleeper serial killings |publisher=Latimesblogs.latimes.com |date= 2010-07-07|accessdate=2010-07-08}}</ref>\n\nPolice had found no exact match between DNA found at the crime scenes and any of the profiles in California's DNA profile database, so they searched the database for stored profiles that demonstrated sufficient similarity to allow police to infer a familial relationship. They found similar DNA belonging to Franklin's son, Christopher, who had been convicted of a [[felony]] weapons charge. According to Cooley, detectives then used a piece of discarded pizza with Franklin's DNA to make the link.<ref name=yahoonews1/>\n\nOne undercover police officer pretended to be a waiter at a restaurant where Franklin ate, collecting dishes, silverware, glasses, and pizza crusts to obtain DNA.<ref name=yahoonews1/> The identification was used to arrest Franklin after his DNA was obtained and deemed a match.<ref name=CNN1/> Saliva found on the victims established a DNA match linking Franklin to the deaths.<ref name=abcnews1/>\n\nLaw enforcement missed an opportunity to catch Franklin because his DNA was not previously collected. In 2003, Franklin was convicted of a felony and was serving three years of supervised [[probation]]. In 2004, voters passed [[California Proposition 69 (2004)|Proposition 69]], which requires that DNA must be collected from all felons and everyone arrested on some specified charges. It also requires the expansion of the DNA database. Authorities collected and sorted through thousands of DNA samples. While he was on probation, Franklin's DNA was supposed to be entered in the system but was not as probation officers did not collect samples from people who were on unsupervised probation between November 2004 and August 2005. The probation department did not have the resources to collect samples until August 2005.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/15/local/la-me-grim-sleeper-dna-20100715|title=Authorities Missed A Chance to Catch Grim Sleeper Suspect|work=Los Angeles Times|date=2010-07-15|accessdate=2010-07-23|first=Jack|last=Leonard}}</ref>\n\nOn December 16, 2010, the LAPD released 180 photos of women, found in Franklin's home after unsuccessful attempts to identify the individuals, possibly additional victims. \"These people are not suspects, we don't even know if they are victims, but we do know this: Lonnie Franklin's reign of terror in the city of Los Angeles, which spanned well over two decades, culminating with almost a dozen murder victims, certainly needs to be investigated further,\" said Police Chief [[Charlie Beck]].<ref name=reuters1/>\n\nIn all, investigators found over 1,000 photos and several hundred hours of video in his home.<ref name=reuters1>{{cite news |last=Whitcomb |first=Dan |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6BF6EU20101216 |title=L.A. police release photos of possible Grim Sleeper victims |publisher=Reuters |date= 2010-12-16|accessdate=2010-12-18}}</ref> The images show mainly black women of a wide age range, from teenagers to middle-aged and older, often nude.

Of the remaining four victims, two bodies were discovered in the 1980s and two were reported missing in 2005 but the remains of the other two were never found, police said.

After a four-month investigation, ''[[LA Weekly]]'' [[investigative journalism|investigative reporter]] Christine Pelisek broke the news of the task force's existence, the link between Peters' killing and the earlier murders, and the silence of [[Mayor of Los Angeles|Mayor]] [[Antonio Villaraigosa]] and Police Chief [[William J.

They found similar DNA belonging to Franklin's son, Christopher, who had been convicted of a [[felony]] weapons charge. According to Cooley, detectives then used a piece of discarded pizza with Franklin's DNA to make the link.<ref name=yahoonews1/>\n\nOne undercover police officer pretended to be a waiter at a restaurant where Franklin ate, collecting dishes, silverware, glasses, and pizza crusts to obtain DNA.<ref name=yahoonews1/> The identification was used to arrest Franklin after his DNA was obtained and deemed a match.<ref name=CNN1/> Saliva found on the victims established a DNA match linking Franklin to the deaths.<ref name=abcnews1/>\n\nLaw enforcement missed an opportunity to catch Franklin because his DNA was not previously collected. In 2003, Franklin was convicted of a felony and was serving three years of supervised [[probation]]. In 2004, voters passed [[California Proposition 69 (2004)|Proposition 69]], which requires that DNA must be collected from all felons and everyone arrested on some specified charges. It also requires the expansion of the DNA database. Authorities collected and sorted through thousands of DNA samples. While he was on probation, Franklin's DNA was supposed to be entered in the system but was not as probation officers did not collect samples from people who were on unsupervised probation between November 2004 and August 2005. The probation department did not have the resources to collect samples until August 2005.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/15/local/la-me-grim-sleeper-dna-20100715|title=Authorities Missed A Chance to Catch Grim Sleeper Suspect|work=Los Angeles Times|date=2010-07-15|accessdate=2010-07-23|first=Jack|last=Leonard}}</ref>\n\nOn December 16, 2010, the LAPD released 180 photos of women, found in Franklin's home after unsuccessful attempts to identify the individuals, possibly additional victims. \"These people are not suspects, we don't even know if they are victims, but we do know this: Lonnie Franklin's reign of terror in the city of Los Angeles, which spanned well over two decades, culminating with almost a dozen murder victims, certainly needs to be investigated further,\" said Police Chief [[Charlie Beck]].<ref name=reuters1/>\n\nIn all, investigators found over 1,000 photos and several hundred hours of video in his home.<ref name=reuters1>{{cite news |last=Whitcomb |first=Dan |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6BF6EU20101216 |title=L.A. police release photos of possible Grim Sleeper victims |publisher=Reuters |date= 2010-12-16|accessdate=2010-12-18}}</ref> The images show mainly black women of a wide age range, from teenagers to middle-aged and older, often nude.

The {{lang|it|[[Stanza della Segnatura]]}} was the first of the rooms to be decorated, and ''The School of Athens'', representing Philosophy, was probably the third painting to be finished there, after {{lang|it|[[Disputation of the Holy Sacrament|La Disputa]]}} (Theology) on the opposite wall, and the ''[[The Parnassus|Parnassus]]'' (Literature).<ref>Jones and Penny, p. 74: \"The execution of the ''School of Athens'' ... probably followed that of the ''Parnassus''.\"</ref> The picture has long been seen as \"Raphael's [[masterpiece]] and the perfect embodiment of the classical spirit of the Renaissance\".<ref name=\"JJ\"/> The painting is notable for its accurate perspective projection.<ref name=\"raytracing\">{{Cite journal|title=Who invented ray tracing?|author=Georg Rainer Hofmann|journal=The Visual Computer|volume=6|issue=3|pages=120\u2013124|year=1990|doi=10.1007/BF01911003}}.</ref>\n\n==Program, subject, figure identifications and interpretations==\n''The School of Athens'' is one of a group of four main frescoes on the walls of the Stanza (those on either side centrally interrupted by windows) that depict distinct branches of knowledge. Each theme is identified above by a separate [[tondo (art)|tondo]] containing a majestic female figure seated in the clouds, with [[Putto|putti]] bearing the phrases: \"Seek Knowledge of Causes,\"  \"Divine Inspiration,\"  \"Knowledge of Things Divine\" (''Disputa''), \"To Each What Is Due.\"  Accordingly, the figures on the walls below exemplify Philosophy, Poetry (including Music), Theology, and Law.<ref>See [[Giorgio Vasari]], \"Raphael of Urbino\", in ''Lives of the Artists'', vol. I: \"In each of the four circles he made an allegorical figure to point the significance of the scene beneath, towards which it turns. For the first, where he had painted Philosophy, Astrology, Geometry and Poetry agreeing with Theology, is a woman representing Knowledge, seated in a chair supported on either side by a goddess Cybele, with the numerous breasts ascribed by the ancients to Diana Polymastes. Her garment is of four colours, representing the four elements, her head being the colour of fire, her bust that of air, her thighs that of earth, and her legs that of water.\" For further clarification, and introduction to more subtle interpretations, see E. H. Gombrich, \"Raphael\u2019s ''Stanza della Segnatura'' and the Nature of Its Symbolism\", in ''Symbolic Images: Studies in the Art of the Renaissance'' (London: Phaidon, 1975).</ref> The traditional title is not Raphael's. The subject of the \"School\" is actually \"Philosophy,\" or at least ancient Greek philosophy, and its overhead tondo-label, \"Causarum Cognitio\", tells us what kind, as it appears to echo [[Aristotle]]'s emphasis on wisdom as knowing why, hence knowing the causes, in ''Metaphysics'' Book I and ''Physics'' Book II. Indeed, [[Plato]] and Aristotle appear to be the central figures in the scene. However, all the philosophers depicted sought knowledge of first causes. Many lived before Plato and Aristotle, and hardly a third were Athenians. The architecture contains Roman elements, but the general semi-circular setting having Plato and Aristotle at its centre might be alluding to Pythagoras' ''[[Monad (philosophy)|circumpunct]]''.\n\n[[File:Scuola di atene 23.jpg|thumb|[[Bramante]] as [[Euclid]] or [[Archimedes]].]]\n[[File:Raffael_071.jpg|thumb|[[Zoroaster]], [[Ptolemy]], Raphael as [[Apelles]] and [[Perugino]] or [[Timoteo Viti]] as [[Protogenes]]]]\nCommentators have suggested that nearly every great ancient Greek philosopher can be found in the painting, but determining which are depicted is difficult, since Raphael made no designations outside possible likenesses, and no contemporary documents explain the painting. Compounding the problem, Raphael had to invent a system of iconography to allude to various figures for whom there were no traditional visual types. For example, while the [[Socrates]] figure is immediately recognizable from Classical busts, the alleged [[Epicurus]] is far removed from his standard type. Aside from the identities of the figures depicted, many aspects of the fresco have been variously interpreted, but few such interpretations are unanimously accepted among scholars.\n\nThe popular idea that the rhetorical gestures of Plato and Aristotle are kinds of pointing (to the heavens, and down to earth) is very likely. But Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' \u2013 which is the book Raphael places in his hand \u2013 was a sophisticated treatment of space, time, and change, including the Earth, which guided mathematical sciences for over a millennium. Aristotle, with his four-elements theory, held that all change on Earth was owing to motions of the heavens. In the painting Aristotle carries his ''[[Ethics (Aristotle)|Ethics]]'', which he denied could be reduced to a mathematical science. It is not certain how much the young Raphael knew of ancient philosophy, what guidance he might have had from people such as [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]], or whether a detailed program was dictated by his sponsor, [[Pope Julius II]].\n\nNevertheless, the fresco has even recently been  interpreted as an exhortation to philosophy and, in a deeper way, as a visual representation of the role of Love in elevating people toward upper knowledge, largely in consonance with contemporary theories of [[Marsilio Ficino]] and other neo-Platonic thinkers linked to Raphael.<ref>M.

[A review of the main interpretations proposed in the last two centuries.]</ref>\n\nFinally, according to Vasari, the scene includes Raphael himself, the [[Duke of Mantua]], [[Zoroaster]] and some [[Evangelism|Evangelists]].<ref>According to Vasari, \"Raphael received a hearty welcome from Pope Julius, and in the chamber of the Segnatura he painted the theologians reconciling Philosophy and Astrology with Theology, including portraits of all the wise men of the world in dispute.\"</ref>\n\nHowever, to [[Heinrich W\u00f6lfflin]], \"it is quite wrong to attempt interpretations of the ''School of Athens'' as an esoteric treatise ... The all-important thing was the artistic motive which expressed a physical or spiritual state, and the name of the person was a matter of indifference\" in Raphael's time.<ref>W\u014dlfflin, p. 88.</ref> Raphael's artistry then orchestrates a beautiful space, continuous with that of viewers in the Stanza, in which a great variety of human figures, each one expressing \"mental states by physical actions,\" interact, in a \"polyphony\" unlike anything in earlier art, in the ongoing dialogue of Philosophy.<ref>W\u014dlfflin, pp. 94ff.</ref>\n\nAn interpretation of the fresco relating to hidden symmetries of the figures and the star constructed by Bramante was given by Guerino Mazzola and collaborators.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/de/book/9783540172673|author=Guerino Mazzola |display-authors=etal |title=Rasterbild - Bildraster|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1986|isbn=978-3-540-17267-3}}</ref> The main basis are two mirrored triangles on the drawing from Bramante (Euclid), which correspond to the feet positions of certain figures.<ref>This can be seen [https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bbm%3A978-3-642-71700-0%2F1.pdf here].</ref>\n\n===Figures===\nThe identities of some of the philosophers in the picture, such as Plato and Aristotle, are certain. Beyond that, identifications of Raphael's figures have always been hypothetical. To complicate matters, beginning from Vasari's efforts, some have received multiple identifications, not only as ancients but also as figures contemporary with Raphael. [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]] mentions portraits of the young [[Federico II Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua]], leaning over Bramante with his hands raised near the bottom right, and Raphael himself.<ref>Giorgio Vasari, ''Lives of the Artists'', v. I, sel. & transl. by George Bull (London: Penguin, 1965), p. 292.</ref>  He was writing over 40 years after the painting, and never knew Raphael, but no doubt reflects what was believed in his time.  Many other popular identifications of portraits are very dubious.\n\n{{ill|Luitpold Dussler|de}} counts among those who can be identified with some certainty: Plato,{{efn|Although probably based on [[Leonardo da Vinci]], it is known that [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] owned a portrait of Plato said to have been found in the ruins of the Academy at Athens.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Salmi |first1=Mario |author1link=Mario Salmi|last2=Becherucci |first2=Luisa |last3=Marabottini |first3=Alessandro |last4=Tempesti |first4=Anna Forlani |last5=Marchini |first5=Giuseppe |last6=Becatti |author6link=Giovanni Becatti |first6=Giovanni |last7=Castagnoli |first7=Ferdinando |author7link=Ferdinando Castagnoli |last8=Golzio |first8=Vincenzo |title=The Complete Work of Raphael |date=1969 |publisher=Reynal and Co., [[William Morrow and Company]] |location=New York |p=522}}</ref>}} Aristotle, Socrates, Pythagoras,<ref name=Raffael>J\u00fcrg Meyer zur Capellen, however, qualifies the certainty of this identification writing \"eine Gruppe von Lesenden und Disputierenden, die um eine Sitzfigur, vielleicht Pythagoras, angeordnet ist.\" (\"a group of people reading and debating, arranged around a seated figure, perhaps Pythagoras.\").

Both figures hold modern (of the time), bound copies of their books in their left hands, while gesturing with their right. Plato holds ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'',  Aristotle his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''. Plato is depicted as old, grey, and bare-foot.  By contrast, Aristotle, slightly ahead of him, is in mature manhood, wearing sandals and gold-trimmed robes, and the youth about them seem to look his way.  In addition, these two central figures gesture along different dimensions: Plato vertically, upward along the picture-plane, into the vault above; Aristotle on the horizontal plane at right-angles to the picture-plane (hence in strong [[foreshortening]]), initiating a flow of space toward viewers.\n\nIt is popularly thought that their gestures indicate central aspects of their philosophies, for Plato, his [[Theory of Forms]], and for Aristotle, with an emphasis on concrete [[particular]]s. Many interpret the painting to show a divergence of the two philosophical schools. Plato argues a sense of timelessness whilst Aristotle looks into the physicality of life and the present realm.\n\n===Setting===\n[[File:Raffael_060.jpg|thumb|Detail of the architecture]]\nThe building is in the shape of a [[St. Clement's Cross|Greek cross]], which some have suggested was intended to show a harmony between [[paganism|pagan]] [[philosophy]] and [[Christian theology]]<ref name=\"JJ\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=MMYHuvhWBH4C''History of Art: The Western Tradition''] by Horst Woldemar Janson, Anthony F.

Each theme is identified above by a separate [[tondo (art)|tondo]] containing a majestic female figure seated in the clouds, with [[Putto|putti]] bearing the phrases: \"Seek Knowledge of Causes,\"  \"Divine Inspiration,\"  \"Knowledge of Things Divine\" (''Disputa''), \"To Each What Is Due.\"  Accordingly, the figures on the walls below exemplify Philosophy, Poetry (including Music), Theology, and Law.<ref>See [[Giorgio Vasari]], \"Raphael of Urbino\", in ''Lives of the Artists'', vol. I: \"In each of the four circles he made an allegorical figure to point the significance of the scene beneath, towards which it turns. For the first, where he had painted Philosophy, Astrology, Geometry and Poetry agreeing with Theology, is a woman representing Knowledge, seated in a chair supported on either side by a goddess Cybele, with the numerous breasts ascribed by the ancients to Diana Polymastes. Her garment is of four colours, representing the four elements, her head being the colour of fire, her bust that of air, her thighs that of earth, and her legs that of water.\" For further clarification, and introduction to more subtle interpretations, see E. H. Gombrich, \"Raphael\u2019s ''Stanza della Segnatura'' and the Nature of Its Symbolism\", in ''Symbolic Images: Studies in the Art of the Renaissance'' (London: Phaidon, 1975).</ref> The traditional title is not Raphael's. The subject of the \"School\" is actually \"Philosophy,\" or at least ancient Greek philosophy, and its overhead tondo-label, \"Causarum Cognitio\", tells us what kind, as it appears to echo [[Aristotle]]'s emphasis on wisdom as knowing why, hence knowing the causes, in ''Metaphysics'' Book I and ''Physics'' Book II. Indeed, [[Plato]] and Aristotle appear to be the central figures in the scene. However, all the philosophers depicted sought knowledge of first causes. Many lived before Plato and Aristotle, and hardly a third were Athenians. The architecture contains Roman elements, but the general semi-circular setting having Plato and Aristotle at its centre might be alluding to Pythagoras' ''[[Monad (philosophy)|circumpunct]]''.\n\n[[File:Scuola di atene 23.jpg|thumb|[[Bramante]] as [[Euclid]] or [[Archimedes]].]]\n[[File:Raffael_071.jpg|thumb|[[Zoroaster]], [[Ptolemy]], Raphael as [[Apelles]] and [[Perugino]] or [[Timoteo Viti]] as [[Protogenes]]]]\nCommentators have suggested that nearly every great ancient Greek philosopher can be found in the painting, but determining which are depicted is difficult, since Raphael made no designations outside possible likenesses, and no contemporary documents explain the painting. Compounding the problem, Raphael had to invent a system of iconography to allude to various figures for whom there were no traditional visual types. For example, while the [[Socrates]] figure is immediately recognizable from Classical busts, the alleged [[Epicurus]] is far removed from his standard type. Aside from the identities of the figures depicted, many aspects of the fresco have been variously interpreted, but few such interpretations are unanimously accepted among scholars.\n\nThe popular idea that the rhetorical gestures of Plato and Aristotle are kinds of pointing (to the heavens, and down to earth) is very likely. But Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' \u2013 which is the book Raphael places in his hand \u2013 was a sophisticated treatment of space, time, and change, including the Earth, which guided mathematical sciences for over a millennium. Aristotle, with his four-elements theory, held that all change on Earth was owing to motions of the heavens. In the painting Aristotle carries his ''[[Ethics (Aristotle)|Ethics]]'', which he denied could be reduced to a mathematical science. It is not certain how much the young Raphael knew of ancient philosophy, what guidance he might have had from people such as [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]], or whether a detailed program was dictated by his sponsor, [[Pope Julius II]].\n\nNevertheless, the fresco has even recently been  interpreted as an exhortation to philosophy and, in a deeper way, as a visual representation of the role of Love in elevating people toward upper knowledge, largely in consonance with contemporary theories of [[Marsilio Ficino]] and other neo-Platonic thinkers linked to Raphael.<ref>M.

[A review of the main interpretations proposed in the last two centuries.]</ref>\n\nFinally, according to Vasari, the scene includes Raphael himself, the [[Duke of Mantua]], [[Zoroaster]] and some [[Evangelism|Evangelists]].<ref>According to Vasari, \"Raphael received a hearty welcome from Pope Julius, and in the chamber of the Segnatura he painted the theologians reconciling Philosophy and Astrology with Theology, including portraits of all the wise men of the world in dispute.\"</ref>\n\nHowever, to [[Heinrich W\u00f6lfflin]], \"it is quite wrong to attempt interpretations of the ''School of Athens'' as an esoteric treatise ... The all-important thing was the artistic motive which expressed a physical or spiritual state, and the name of the person was a matter of indifference\" in Raphael's time.<ref>W\u014dlfflin, p. 88.</ref> Raphael's artistry then orchestrates a beautiful space, continuous with that of viewers in the Stanza, in which a great variety of human figures, each one expressing \"mental states by physical actions,\" interact, in a \"polyphony\" unlike anything in earlier art, in the ongoing dialogue of Philosophy.<ref>W\u014dlfflin, pp. 94ff.</ref>\n\nAn interpretation of the fresco relating to hidden symmetries of the figures and the star constructed by Bramante was given by Guerino Mazzola and collaborators.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/de/book/9783540172673|author=Guerino Mazzola |display-authors=etal |title=Rasterbild - Bildraster|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1986|isbn=978-3-540-17267-3}}</ref> The main basis are two mirrored triangles on the drawing from Bramante (Euclid), which correspond to the feet positions of certain figures.<ref>This can be seen [https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bbm%3A978-3-642-71700-0%2F1.pdf here].</ref>\n\n===Figures===\nThe identities of some of the philosophers in the picture, such as Plato and Aristotle, are certain. Beyond that, identifications of Raphael's figures have always been hypothetical. To complicate matters, beginning from Vasari's efforts, some have received multiple identifications, not only as ancients but also as figures contemporary with Raphael. [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]] mentions portraits of the young [[Federico II Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua]], leaning over Bramante with his hands raised near the bottom right, and Raphael himself.<ref>Giorgio Vasari, ''Lives of the Artists'', v. I, sel. & transl. by George Bull (London: Penguin, 1965), p. 292.</ref>  He was writing over 40 years after the painting, and never knew Raphael, but no doubt reflects what was believed in his time.  Many other popular identifications of portraits are very dubious.\n\n{{ill|Luitpold Dussler|de}} counts among those who can be identified with some certainty: Plato,{{efn|Although probably based on [[Leonardo da Vinci]], it is known that [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] owned a portrait of Plato said to have been found in the ruins of the Academy at Athens.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Salmi |first1=Mario |author1link=Mario Salmi|last2=Becherucci |first2=Luisa |last3=Marabottini |first3=Alessandro |last4=Tempesti |first4=Anna Forlani |last5=Marchini |first5=Giuseppe |last6=Becatti |author6link=Giovanni Becatti |first6=Giovanni |last7=Castagnoli |first7=Ferdinando |author7link=Ferdinando Castagnoli |last8=Golzio |first8=Vincenzo |title=The Complete Work of Raphael |date=1969 |publisher=Reynal and Co., [[William Morrow and Company]] |location=New York |p=522}}</ref>}} Aristotle, Socrates, Pythagoras,<ref name=Raffael>J\u00fcrg Meyer zur Capellen, however, qualifies the certainty of this identification writing \"eine Gruppe von Lesenden und Disputierenden, die um eine Sitzfigur, vielleicht Pythagoras, angeordnet ist.\" (\"a group of people reading and debating, arranged around a seated figure, perhaps Pythagoras.\").

Both figures hold modern (of the time), bound copies of their books in their left hands, while gesturing with their right. Plato holds ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'',  Aristotle his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''. Plato is depicted as old, grey, and bare-foot.  By contrast, Aristotle, slightly ahead of him, is in mature manhood, wearing sandals and gold-trimmed robes, and the youth about them seem to look his way.  In addition, these two central figures gesture along different dimensions: Plato vertically, upward along the picture-plane, into the vault above; Aristotle on the horizontal plane at right-angles to the picture-plane (hence in strong [[foreshortening]]), initiating a flow of space toward viewers.\n\nIt is popularly thought that their gestures indicate central aspects of their philosophies, for Plato, his [[Theory of Forms]], and for Aristotle, with an emphasis on concrete [[particular]]s. Many interpret the painting to show a divergence of the two philosophical schools. Plato argues a sense of timelessness whilst Aristotle looks into the physicality of life and the present realm.\n\n===Setting===\n[[File:Raffael_060.jpg|thumb|Detail of the architecture]]\nThe building is in the shape of a [[St. Clement's Cross|Greek cross]], which some have suggested was intended to show a harmony between [[paganism|pagan]] [[philosophy]] and [[Christian theology]]<ref name=\"JJ\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=MMYHuvhWBH4C''History of Art: The Western Tradition''] by Horst Woldemar Janson, Anthony F.

Mimaut mentioned in the 19th century nine statues at Serapeum of Alexandria holding rolls. Eleven statues were found at [[Saqqara]]. A review of \"Les Statues Ptol\u00e9ma\u00efques du Sarapieion de Memphis\" noted they were probably sculpted in the 3rd century with limestone and stucco, some standing others sitting. [[Alan Rowe (archaeologist)|Rowe]] and Rees 1956 suggested that both scenes in the Serapeum of Alexandria and Saqqara share a similar theme, such as with Plato's Academy mosaic, with Saqqara figures attributed to: \"(1) Pindare, (2) D\u00e9m\u00e9trios de Phal\u00e8re, (3) x (?), (4) Orph\u00e9e (?) aux oiseaux, (5) H\u00e9siode, (6) Hom\u00e8re, (7) x (?), (8) Protagoras, (9) Thal\u00e8s, (10) H\u00e9raclite, (11) Platon, (12) Aristote (?).\"<ref name=\"RoweRees1956\">{{cite web|url=https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1914&datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF|author=Alan Rowe |author2=B.
