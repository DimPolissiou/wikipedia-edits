Blige]]. The album was released by [[MCA Records|MCA]] on August 28, 2001.\n\nFollowing the critical and commercial success of her fourth studio album ''[[Mary (Mary J. Blige album)|Mary]]'' (1999), ''No More Drama'' was similarly well-received.  It debuted at number two on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and at number one on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums|R&B Albums]] chart, selling 324,000 copies in its first week.<ref>[http://www.hitsdailydouble.com/sales/archcht.cgi?cht760 HITS Daily Double: Previous Album Sales Chart<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120604211103/http://www.hitsdailydouble.com/sales/archcht.cgi?cht760 |date=2012-06-04 }}</ref> It has spawned four singles that have attained ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'' chart success, including its lead single \"[[Family Affair (2001 song)|Family Affair]]\", which became Blige's first career number-one single on the [[Billboard Hot 100|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and a worldwide number-one hit.\n\nThe album received two [[Grammy Award]] nominations for [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Album|Best R&B Album]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance|Best Female R&B Vocal Performance]] (for \"[[Family Affair (2001 song)|Family Affair]]\") at the [[44th Grammy Awards]]. Blige would win her first in the latter category for the track \"He Think I Don't Know\" the following year. As of December 2016, the album has been certified triple platinum for shipping over three million copies in the US by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).\n\n==Conception==\nThe inspiration for ''No More Drama'' came largely from Blige's own confused and hectic life. In a later interview she confessed to living a life of alcohol and drug abuse at the time, and as a result getting involved in a series of abusive relationships. The album was an attempt to break free from this vicious circle, which was a result of a deprived childhood.<ref name=\"Brown\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/3670996/Mary-J-Blige-Proud-to-shout-it-out-without-selling-out-on-Growing-Pains.html|title=Mary J Blige: Proud to shout it out without selling out on 'Growing Pains'|last=Brown|first=Helen|date=2008-07-02|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=2009-07-21}}</ref>\n\nStylistically, the album diverged from Blige's typically blues-soaked R&B into the hip-hop beats and influences that had made her debut, 1992's ''[[What's the 411?]]'', a hit. This is especially evident in the first single, \"[[Family Affair (2001 song)|Family Affair]]\". Rapper [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]] appears on the track \"Where I've Been\" as well, and urban influences can be heard throughout the album.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nEarly in its development, the album carried the full title '''''Mary Jane - No More Drama''''' and was to be a sequel to 1999's ''[[Mary (Mary J. Blige album)|Mary]]''. Blige's then-manager hinted that the album would be the second in a trilogy and be followed by an album titled '''''Mary Jane Blige'''''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1442450/20010403/blige_mary_j.jhtml|title=Mary J.

The song was leaked to mixtapes around June 2001, two months before the album was scheduled to be released and subsequently did not make the final cut on the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1444771/20010625/jay_z.jhtml|title=Blige May Cut Leaked Jay-Z/Kravitz Track From Album|publisher=MTV News}}</ref>\n\nThe original advance copy of ''No More Drama'' was slightly different from the later, official release.

Blige]]. The album was released by [[MCA Records|MCA]] on August 28, 2001.\n\nFollowing the critical and commercial success of her fourth studio album ''[[Mary (Mary J. Blige album)|Mary]]'' (1999), ''No More Drama'' was similarly well-received.  It debuted at number two on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and at number one on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums|R&B Albums]] chart, selling 324,000 copies in its first week.<ref>[http://www.hitsdailydouble.com/sales/archcht.cgi?cht760 HITS Daily Double: Previous Album Sales Chart<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120604211103/http://www.hitsdailydouble.com/sales/archcht.cgi?cht760 |date=2012-06-04 }}</ref> It has spawned four singles that have attained ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'' chart success, including its lead single \"[[Family Affair (2001 song)|Family Affair]]\", which became Blige's first career number-one single on the [[Billboard Hot 100|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and a worldwide number-one hit.\n\nThe album received two [[Grammy Award]] nominations for [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Album|Best R&B Album]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance|Best Female R&B Vocal Performance]] (for \"[[Family Affair (2001 song)|Family Affair]]\") at the [[44th Grammy Awards]]. Blige would win her first in the latter category for the track \"He Think I Don't Know\" the following year. As of December 2016, the album has been certified triple platinum for shipping over three million copies in the US by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).\n\n==Conception==\nThe inspiration for ''No More Drama'' came largely from Blige's own confused and hectic life. In a later interview she confessed to living a life of alcohol and drug abuse at the time, and as a result getting involved in a series of abusive relationships. The album was an attempt to break free from this vicious circle, which was a result of a deprived childhood.<ref name=\"Brown\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/3670996/Mary-J-Blige-Proud-to-shout-it-out-without-selling-out-on-Growing-Pains.html|title=Mary J Blige: Proud to shout it out without selling out on 'Growing Pains'|last=Brown|first=Helen|date=2008-07-02|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=2009-07-21}}</ref>\n\nStylistically, the album diverged from Blige's typically blues-soaked R&B into the hip-hop beats and influences that had made her debut, 1992's ''[[What's the 411?]]'', a hit. This is especially evident in the first single, \"[[Family Affair (2001 song)|Family Affair]]\". Rapper [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]] appears on the track \"Where I've Been\" as well, and urban influences can be heard throughout the album.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nEarly in its development, the album carried the full title '''''Mary Jane - No More Drama''''' and was to be a sequel to 1999's ''[[Mary (Mary J. Blige album)|Mary]]''. Blige's then-manager hinted that the album would be the second in a trilogy and be followed by an album titled '''''Mary Jane Blige'''''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1442450/20010403/blige_mary_j.jhtml|title=Mary J.

In 1896, [[Andres Bonifacio]] founded the [[Katipunan]] to prepare his band of Filipinos for armed revolt against the Spanish government. The Katipunan formed an army of [[insurgent]]s.\n\nAlmost a year after the outbreak of hostilities between the Katipuneros and the Spanish troops, Emilio Aguinaldo's Philippine Revolutionary Government and its Army were born on March 22, 1897 at Tejeros, San Francisco de Malabon in Cavite. General [[Artemio Ricarte]] was named Captain General of the Ejercito en la Republica de las Islas Filipinas or the revolutionary Philippine Army. This date marks the founding day [[Philippine Revolutionary Army]] (PRA).\n\nOn June 12, 1898, General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] declared Philippine Independence from Spain and formed the first [[First Philippine Republic|Philippine Republic]], in which he sat as its president. The Filipino troops were to enjoy only a brief respite from combat when American forces came in to establish rule in the islands by virtue of the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]], which Spain co-signed with America on 10 December 1898. The treaty ceded the Philippines to the United States.\n\n[[File:Insurgent soldiers in the Philippines 1899.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the Philippine Revolutionary Army during the Philippine\u2013American War]]\n\n===Philippine\u2013American War (1899\u20131902)===\nDuring the final years of the Philippine\u2013American War, with the notable successes by the all-Filipino Macabebe Scouts cavalry squadron (raised in 1899) under U.S. command against the [[Philippine Revolutionary Army]] (PRA), the American President Theodore Roosevelt officially sanctioned the raising of the [[Philippine Scouts]] (PS) as part of the [[United States Army]], with full effect starting from October 1901. Earlier, in August that same year, came the colonial civil government's decision to found the [[Philippine Constabulary]] (PC) as the national [[gendarmerie]] force for law enforcement. Both of these organizations and their victories over the PRA contributed to the official end of the conflict in 1902, even as resistance continued (inclusive of the Muslims of the south, resulting in the [[Moro Rebellion]]) through 1914.\n\nStarting in 1910, Filipino personnel in the Philippine Scouts were sent to the [[United States Military Academy]] with one PS soldier being sent per year. Several of these graduates who served with the Scouts, plus PC officers, both formed part of the first officer corps of the revitalized [[Philippine Commonwealth Army|Philippine Army]] established in 1935.\n\n===Commonwealth Period (1935\u20131946)===\n[[File:Philippine Scouts 1905.jpg|thumb|Philippine Scouts in formation during the American colonial period]]\nThe Philippine Army of today was initially organized under the [[National Defense Act of 1935]]  (Commonwealth Act No. 1) that formally created the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]]. The act specified that in so far as may be practicable, original appointments by the President in grades above third lieutenant should be made from among former holders of reserve commissions in the United States Army, from among former officers of the Philippine Scouts and Constabulary.<ref name=CA1>{{cite book|last=Jose|first=Ricardo Trota|title=The Philippine Army: 1935\u20131942|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kGocnp15GQ8C|year=1992|publisher=Ateneo University Press|isbn=978-971-550-081-4|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=kGocnp15GQ8C&pg=PA23 23\u201349]|ref=harv|access-date=2016-08-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111113837/http://books.google.com/books?id=kGocnp15GQ8C|archive-date=2014-01-11|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/commonwealthacts/commonwealthactno1.html|title=Commonwealth Act No. 1|date=December 21, 1935|work=Philippine Laws, Statutes, and Codes|publisher=Chan Robles Law Library|access-date=October 27, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113172053/http://www.chanrobles.com/commonwealthacts/commonwealthactno1.html|archive-date=January 13, 2009|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nAfter the establishment of the Philippine Commonwealth on November 15, 1935, [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Manuel L. Quezon]] sought the services of General [[Douglas MacArthur]] to evolve a national defense plan. The official rebirth of the Philippine Army occurred with the passage of ''Commonwealth Act No. 1'', approved on December 21, 1935, which effected the organization of a ''Council of National Defense'' and of the ''Army of the Philippines''. The act set forth the organizational structure of the army in some detail, set forth enlistment procedures, and established mobilization procedures.<ref name=CA1 /> With this act, the AFP was officially established.\n\nThe development of the new Philippine Army was slow.<ref name=FallP>''U.S. Army in World War II'': \"Fall of the Philippines\", Chapter 1</ref> The year 1936 was devoted to the building of camps, organization of cadres, and the special training of instructors, drawn largely from the Constabulary, which joined the new force as the Constabulary Division. The commander of the Philippine Department provided Philippine Scouts as instructors and detailed U.S. Army officers to assist in the inspection, instruction, and administration of the program. By the end of the year instructors had been trained and camps established.\n\nThe first group of 20,000 men was called up on January 1, 1937; and by the end of 1939 there were 4,800 officers and 104,000 men in the reserves.<ref name=FallP /> Infantry training was given at camps scattered throughout the Philippines; field artillery training was concentrated in the vicinity of the U.S. Army's [[Fort Stotsenburg]] near Angeles, about fifty miles north of Manila, and specialized training was given at [[Fort William McKinley]] just south of Manila. Coast artillery instruction was carried on at Fort Stotsenburg and at Grande Island in Subic Bay by personnel supplied largely by the American commander at Corregidor.\n\nWith the threat of war with Japan becoming imminent, on July 26, 1941 a new U.S. command in the Far East was created, known as the [[United States Army Forces Far East]] (USAFFE) under the command of General MacArthur. On the same date, U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], issued a [[Executive order|Presidential Order]] (6 Fed. Reg. 3825) which called the Philippine Army into the service of the Armed Forces of the United States. The Presidential Order did not order all the military forces of the Philippine government into the service of the United States Armed Forces; only those units and personnel indicated in orders issued by a general officer of the United States Army were mobilized and made an integral part of the United States Army Forces Far East (USAFFE), and only those members of a unit who physically reported for duty were inducted.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jose|1992|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=kGocnp15GQ8C&pg=PA191 191\u2013210]}}.</ref><ref name=\"COMMONWEALTH\">{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/st-louis/military-personnel/philippine-army-records.html|title=Philippine Army and Guerrilla Records|date=3 July 2013|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=24 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224163626/http://www.archives.gov/st-louis/military-personnel/philippine-army-records.html|archive-date=24 December 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  With an annual appropriation of 16 million pesos, the mobilized units trained new Filipino members in defending the nation and protecting its people.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Philippine Scouts at Fort McKinley.jpg|thumb|Philippine Scouts operating a [[37 mm gun M3]] at [[Fort Bonifacio|Fort McKinley]].]]\nWhen World War II broke out in December 1941, two regular and ten reserve divisions of the Philippine Army undertook the defense of the Philippines.

Defending forces included regiments of the [[Harbor Defenses of Manila and Subic Bays]], the [[4th Marine Regiment]] and other Philippine, U.S. Army and Navy units and soldiers. Japanese forces landed at Corregidor on May 5, 1942. The island's fall led to the surrender of all defending Filipino and American forces on May 6, 1942. About 4,000 of the 11,000 American and Filipino prisoners of war from the island were marched through the streets of Manila to incarceration at [[Fort Santiago]] in [[Intramuros]] and [[Bilibid Prison]] in [[Muntinlupa]], [[Rizal]], which had become Japanese camps.\n\nWith the fall of Corregidor, Filipino and U.S. forces under U.S. command surrendered. After the surrender, thousands of Filipinos formerly under U.S. command (especially the former [[Visayan-Mindanao Force]], which had seen little combat) evaded Japanese confinement and hid in the jungle. Every major island had guerrilla groups; Luzon had a dozen, including the Communist [[Huks]]. After initial clashes based on religious and political rivalries order was gradually restored, with most willing to trust the United States to grant independence in time.<ref>Michael Wright, \"The World at Arms: The Reader's Digest Illustrated History of World War II\" Reader\u2019s Digest, 1989, 384.</ref> Many of these groups worked under the control of General Douglas MacArthur's General Headquarters, [[Southwest Pacific Area]]. The [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines]] saw repeated combat between the Japanese imperial forces, their collaborators and Filipino guerrillas. The American and Allied liberation force which began landing on October 17, 1944 was aided by local Filipino soldiers and recognized guerrillas in the [[Philippines Campaign (1944-45)|liberation of the Philippines]].\n\nPresident [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a]] and Major General [[Basilio J. Valdes]] ordered the re-establishment of the army. The general headquarters of the Philippine Army and the United States Army Forces in the Far East moved to [[Tacloban]], [[Leyte]] on October 23. From October 17, 1944 to September 2, 1945, local Philippine Constabulary troops, guerrilla units and the American liberation forces fought Imperial Japanese and [[Kempeitai]] troops which were supported by the Bureau of Constabulary and [[Makapili]] militia.\n\nAfter the restoration of the Commonwealth of the Philippines on October 20, 1944, President Sergio Osmena, the government, military officials and cabinet returned from exile in the United States.\n\nAfter the war, four military areas were activated to take the place of military districts. The Armed Forces was reorganized which gave birth to the four major services of the Armed Forces. Headquarters National Defense Forces was renamed General Headquarters Armed Forces of the Philippines.\n\n===Post-war period===\n[[File:Special Force.jpg|thumb|[[Special Operations Command (Philippines)|Philippine Army Special Operations Command (SOCOM)]] operators with Special Operations Command, stationed at Fort Magsaysay.]]\n[[File:Army.mil-2008-02-21-124604.jpg|thumb|upright|Philippine Army SSG Manolo Martin demonstrates the proper method of holding a cobra during a survival course in the [[Balikatan]] Exercise 2008.]]\nService of the Philippine Army as part of the [[United States Army]] terminated as of midnight, June 30, 1946, by authority of General Order #168, [[U.S. Army Forces, Western Pacific]].<ref name=\"COMMONWEALTH\" />  The next day, on July 1, President Manuel Roxas issued Executive Order No. 94 s. 1947 which, among other things, reorganized the Philippine Army into a service branch of what was now called the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gov.ph/1947/10/04/executive-order-no-94-s-1947|title=Executive Order No. 94 s. 1947|newspaper=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette of the Philippines]]|access-date=2013-07-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131124035018/http://www.gov.ph/1947/10/04/executive-order-no-94-s-1947/|archive-date=2013-11-24|url-status=live}}</ref> This resulted in the formation of the [[Philippine Air Force]] and reformation of the [[Philippine Navy]] as separate organizations after long years as part of the Philippine Army.\n\nIn the early fifties and the mid-sixties, the Philippine government extended a helping hand to war-torn countries as part of its commitment as member of the United Nations.\n\n1950 would see the new army not just fighting Communist groups in Luzon but from August of that year, even the [[Korean People's Army]] and their allies in the [[People's Liberation Army]] in the [[Korean War]] as PA Battalion Combat Teams (BCTs) forming the bulk of the [[Philippine Expeditionary Forces to Korea]] formed part of the UN forces, led by the US, that fought in the conflict. The decade saw the raising of the first active division of the Army, the 1st Infantry Division. With the victory over the Huks later in the 50s, the BCTs became active duty infantry battalions. Formed in the same time was the [[1st Scout Ranger Regiment]], and in 1962 the PA raised its airborne and special forces formation, the [[Special Forces Regiment (Airborne)]] following the traditions of the US Army Special Forces (the Green Berets) and the 11th Airborne Division that helped liberate Southern Luzon and Manila at the closing stages of the Japanese occupation of the country.\n\nIt would only take until the 1970s and the Communist and Muslim rebellions that would force the PA into the establishment of its 2nd Infantry Division, which led to the raising of more infantry divisions all over the country, as well as the formal raising of the Army's Special Operations Command and what is now today the Armor Division. By the 2000s, the Army acquired a small aviation capability for transport purposes, with plans to include attack and transport helicopters, a rocket artillery battery unit, and a land-based missile battery system unit . \n\n==Rank Structure==\n===Officers===\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armed Forces/OF/Blank}}\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| \n| colspan=2 style=\"background:#cfcfcf;\"| '''[[President of the Republic of the Philippines|Commander-in-Chief]]'''\n| colspan=8 style=\"background:#cfcfcf;\"| '''Generals'''\n| colspan=6 style=\"background:#cfcfcf;\"| '''Senior officers'''\n| colspan=8 style=\"background:#cfcfcf;\"| '''Junior officers'''\n| colspan=12 style=\"background:#cfcfcf;\"| '''Officer Candidates'''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armies/OF/Philippines}}\n|}\n\n===Enlisted===\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Air Forces/OR/Blank}}\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| \n| colspan=8 style=\"background:#cfcfcf;\"| '''Warrant Officers'''\n| colspan=28 style=\"background:#cfcfcf;\"| '''Non-Commissioned Officers'''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armies/OR/Philippines}}\n|}\n\n==Organization==\nThe Philippine Army is headed by the [[Commanding General of the Philippine Army]], attaining the rank of [[Lieutenant General]].

In 1896, [[Andres Bonifacio]] founded the [[Katipunan]] to prepare his band of Filipinos for armed revolt against the Spanish government. The Katipunan formed an army of [[insurgent]]s.\n\nAlmost a year after the outbreak of hostilities between the Katipuneros and the Spanish troops, Emilio Aguinaldo's Philippine Revolutionary Government and its Army were born on March 22, 1897 at Tejeros, San Francisco de Malabon in Cavite. General [[Artemio Ricarte]] was named Captain General of the Ejercito en la Republica de las Islas Filipinas or the revolutionary Philippine Army. This date marks the founding day [[Philippine Revolutionary Army]] (PRA).\n\nOn June 12, 1898, General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] declared Philippine Independence from Spain and formed the first [[First Philippine Republic|Philippine Republic]], in which he sat as its president. The Filipino troops were to enjoy only a brief respite from combat when American forces came in to establish rule in the islands by virtue of the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]], which Spain co-signed with America on 10 December 1898. The treaty ceded the Philippines to the United States.\n\n[[File:Insurgent soldiers in the Philippines 1899.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the Philippine Revolutionary Army during the Philippine\u2013American War]]\n\n===Philippine\u2013American War (1899\u20131902)===\nDuring the final years of the Philippine\u2013American War, with the notable successes by the all-Filipino Macabebe Scouts cavalry squadron (raised in 1899) under U.S. command against the [[Philippine Revolutionary Army]] (PRA), the American President Theodore Roosevelt officially sanctioned the raising of the [[Philippine Scouts]] (PS) as part of the [[United States Army]], with full effect starting from October 1901. Earlier, in August that same year, came the colonial civil government's decision to found the [[Philippine Constabulary]] (PC) as the national [[gendarmerie]] force for law enforcement. Both of these organizations and their victories over the PRA contributed to the official end of the conflict in 1902, even as resistance continued (inclusive of the Muslims of the south, resulting in the [[Moro Rebellion]]) through 1914.\n\nStarting in 1910, Filipino personnel in the Philippine Scouts were sent to the [[United States Military Academy]] with one PS soldier being sent per year. Several of these graduates who served with the Scouts, plus PC officers, both formed part of the first officer corps of the revitalized [[Philippine Commonwealth Army|Philippine Army]] established in 1935.\n\n===Commonwealth Period (1935\u20131946)===\n[[File:Philippine Scouts 1905.jpg|thumb|Philippine Scouts in formation during the American colonial period]]\nThe Philippine Army of today was initially organized under the [[National Defense Act of 1935]]  (Commonwealth Act No. 1) that formally created the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]].

Quezon]] sought the services of General [[Douglas MacArthur]] to evolve a national defense plan. The official rebirth of the Philippine Army occurred with the passage of ''Commonwealth Act No. 1'', approved on December 21, 1935, which effected the organization of a ''Council of National Defense'' and of the ''Army of the Philippines''. The act set forth the organizational structure of the army in some detail, set forth enlistment procedures, and established mobilization procedures.<ref name=CA1 /> With this act, the AFP was officially established.\n\nThe development of the new Philippine Army was slow.<ref name=FallP>''U.S. Army in World War II'': \"Fall of the Philippines\", Chapter 1</ref> The year 1936 was devoted to the building of camps, organization of cadres, and the special training of instructors, drawn largely from the Constabulary, which joined the new force as the Constabulary Division. The commander of the Philippine Department provided Philippine Scouts as instructors and detailed U.S. Army officers to assist in the inspection, instruction, and administration of the program. By the end of the year instructors had been trained and camps established.\n\nThe first group of 20,000 men was called up on January 1, 1937; and by the end of 1939 there were 4,800 officers and 104,000 men in the reserves.<ref name=FallP /> Infantry training was given at camps scattered throughout the Philippines; field artillery training was concentrated in the vicinity of the U.S. Army's [[Fort Stotsenburg]] near Angeles, about fifty miles north of Manila, and specialized training was given at [[Fort William McKinley]] just south of Manila. Coast artillery instruction was carried on at Fort Stotsenburg and at Grande Island in Subic Bay by personnel supplied largely by the American commander at Corregidor.\n\nWith the threat of war with Japan becoming imminent, on July 26, 1941 a new U.S. command in the Far East was created, known as the [[United States Army Forces Far East]] (USAFFE) under the command of General MacArthur. On the same date, U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], issued a [[Executive order|Presidential Order]] (6 Fed. Reg. 3825) which called the Philippine Army into the service of the Armed Forces of the United States. The Presidential Order did not order all the military forces of the Philippine government into the service of the United States Armed Forces; only those units and personnel indicated in orders issued by a general officer of the United States Army were mobilized and made an integral part of the United States Army Forces Far East (USAFFE), and only those members of a unit who physically reported for duty were inducted.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jose|1992|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=kGocnp15GQ8C&pg=PA191 191\u2013210]}}.</ref><ref name=\"COMMONWEALTH\">{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/st-louis/military-personnel/philippine-army-records.html|title=Philippine Army and Guerrilla Records|date=3 July 2013|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=24 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224163626/http://www.archives.gov/st-louis/military-personnel/philippine-army-records.html|archive-date=24 December 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  With an annual appropriation of 16 million pesos, the mobilized units trained new Filipino members in defending the nation and protecting its people.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Philippine Scouts at Fort McKinley.jpg|thumb|Philippine Scouts operating a [[37 mm gun M3]] at [[Fort Bonifacio|Fort McKinley]].]]\nWhen World War II broke out in December 1941, two regular and ten reserve divisions of the Philippine Army undertook the defense of the Philippines.

Defending forces included regiments of the [[Harbor Defenses of Manila and Subic Bays]], the [[4th Marine Regiment]] and other Philippine, U.S. Army and Navy units and soldiers. Japanese forces landed at Corregidor on May 5, 1942. The island's fall led to the surrender of all defending Filipino and American forces on May 6, 1942. About 4,000 of the 11,000 American and Filipino prisoners of war from the island were marched through the streets of Manila to incarceration at [[Fort Santiago]] in [[Intramuros]] and [[Bilibid Prison]] in [[Muntinlupa]], [[Rizal]], which had become Japanese camps.\n\nWith the fall of Corregidor, Filipino and U.S. forces under U.S. command surrendered. After the surrender, thousands of Filipinos formerly under U.S. command (especially the former [[Visayan-Mindanao Force]], which had seen little combat) evaded Japanese confinement and hid in the jungle. Every major island had guerrilla groups; Luzon had a dozen, including the Communist [[Huks]]. After initial clashes based on religious and political rivalries order was gradually restored, with most willing to trust the United States to grant independence in time.<ref>Michael Wright, \"The World at Arms: The Reader's Digest Illustrated History of World War II\" Reader\u2019s Digest, 1989, 384.</ref> Many of these groups worked under the control of General Douglas MacArthur's General Headquarters, [[Southwest Pacific Area]].

The American and Allied liberation force which began landing on October 17, 1944 was aided by local Filipino soldiers and recognized guerrillas in the [[Philippines Campaign (1944-45)|liberation of the Philippines]].\n\nPresident [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a]] and Major General [[Basilio J. Valdes]] ordered the re-establishment of the army. The general headquarters of the Philippine Army and the United States Army Forces in the Far East moved to [[Tacloban]], [[Leyte]] on October 23. From October 17, 1944 to September 2, 1945, local Philippine Constabulary troops, guerrilla units and the American liberation forces fought Imperial Japanese and [[Kempeitai]] troops which were supported by the Bureau of Constabulary and [[Makapili]] militia.\n\nAfter the restoration of the Commonwealth of the Philippines on October 20, 1944, President Sergio Osmena, the government, military officials and cabinet returned from exile in the United States.\n\nAfter the war, four military areas were activated to take the place of military districts. The Armed Forces was reorganized which gave birth to the four major services of the Armed Forces. Headquarters National Defense Forces was renamed General Headquarters Armed Forces of the Philippines.\n\n===Post-war period===\n[[File:Special Force.jpg|thumb|[[Special Operations Command (Philippines)|Philippine Army Special Operations Command (SOCOM)]] operators with Special Operations Command, stationed at Fort Magsaysay.]]\n[[File:Army.mil-2008-02-21-124604.jpg|thumb|upright|Philippine Army SSG Manolo Martin demonstrates the proper method of holding a cobra during a survival course in the [[Balikatan]] Exercise 2008.]]\nService of the Philippine Army as part of the [[United States Army]] terminated as of midnight, June 30, 1946, by authority of General Order #168, [[U.S. Army Forces, Western Pacific]].<ref name=\"COMMONWEALTH\" />  The next day, on July 1, President Manuel Roxas issued Executive Order No. 94 s. 1947 which, among other things, reorganized the Philippine Army into a service branch of what was now called the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gov.ph/1947/10/04/executive-order-no-94-s-1947|title=Executive Order No. 94 s. 1947|newspaper=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette of the Philippines]]|access-date=2013-07-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131124035018/http://www.gov.ph/1947/10/04/executive-order-no-94-s-1947/|archive-date=2013-11-24|url-status=live}}</ref> This resulted in the formation of the [[Philippine Air Force]] and reformation of the [[Philippine Navy]] as separate organizations after long years as part of the Philippine Army.\n\nIn the early fifties and the mid-sixties, the Philippine government extended a helping hand to war-torn countries as part of its commitment as member of the United Nations.\n\n1950 would see the new army not just fighting Communist groups in Luzon but from August of that year, even the [[Korean People's Army]] and their allies in the [[People's Liberation Army]] in the [[Korean War]] as PA Battalion Combat Teams (BCTs) forming the bulk of the [[Philippine Expeditionary Forces to Korea]] formed part of the UN forces, led by the US, that fought in the conflict. The decade saw the raising of the first active division of the Army, the 1st Infantry Division. With the victory over the Huks later in the 50s, the BCTs became active duty infantry battalions. Formed in the same time was the [[1st Scout Ranger Regiment]], and in 1962 the PA raised its airborne and special forces formation, the [[Special Forces Regiment (Airborne)]] following the traditions of the US Army Special Forces (the Green Berets) and the 11th Airborne Division that helped liberate Southern Luzon and Manila at the closing stages of the Japanese occupation of the country.\n\nIt would only take until the 1970s and the Communist and Muslim rebellions that would force the PA into the establishment of its 2nd Infantry Division, which led to the raising of more infantry divisions all over the country, as well as the formal raising of the Army's Special Operations Command and what is now today the Armor Division. By the 2000s, the Army acquired a small aviation capability for transport purposes, with plans to include attack and transport helicopters, a rocket artillery battery unit, and a land-based missile battery system unit . \n\n==Rank Structure==\n===Officers===\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armed Forces/OF/Blank}}\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| \n| colspan=2 style=\"background:#cfcfcf;\"| '''[[President of the Republic of the Philippines|Commander-in-Chief]]'''\n| colspan=8 style=\"background:#cfcfcf;\"| '''Generals'''\n| colspan=6 style=\"background:#cfcfcf;\"| '''Senior officers'''\n| colspan=8 style=\"background:#cfcfcf;\"| '''Junior officers'''\n| colspan=12 style=\"background:#cfcfcf;\"| '''Officer Candidates'''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armies/OF/Philippines}}\n|}\n\n===Enlisted===\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Air Forces/OR/Blank}}\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| \n| colspan=8 style=\"background:#cfcfcf;\"| '''Warrant Officers'''\n| colspan=28 style=\"background:#cfcfcf;\"| '''Non-Commissioned Officers'''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armies/OR/Philippines}}\n|}\n\n==Organization==\nThe Philippine Army is headed by the [[Commanding General of the Philippine Army]], attaining the rank of [[Lieutenant General]].

The storms resulted in 6 tornado-related fatalities, all of which occurred as a result of a nighttime EF3 tornado that caused major damage in and around [[Woodward, Oklahoma]]. Numerous other tornadoes occurred, including a violent EF4 tornado that passed near [[Marquette, Kansas]], and an EF3 that caused major damage in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]].\n\n==Meteorological synopsis==\nAn impressive low pressure area and associated trough began tracking into the Great Plains on April 13, and a slight risk of severe weather was issued. The outlook mentioned the possibility of tornadoes, including the risk for isolated strong tornadoes. No strong tornadoes occurred, though an EF1 tornado caused considerable damage in [[Norman, Oklahoma]].\n[[File:Evolution of SPC Forecasts Leading to April 14, 2012.png|thumb|left|A montage of the Storm Prediction Center's severe weather outlooks leading up to the outbreak.

In the discussion, the SPC stated that a major tornado outbreak was likely across central Kansas and north-central Oklahoma during the afternoon and overnight hours of April 14, with long-tracked violent tornadoes likely. It was later expanded to include a second high risk area across much of Nebraska, where a rare 45% tornado probability was given during the late morning update on April&nbsp;13.  During the morning hours on the 14th, the high risk area was expanded again to combine the two separate areas into a single large one. Later in the day, the 45% tornado probability was shifted from Nebraska south to Kansas and northern Oklahoma. A large outbreak of tornadoes impacted the Great Plains states on April 14, and several [[Particularly dangerous situation|PDS]] [[Tornado Warning]]s were issued during the outbreak. Initially, most of the tornadoes were small or remained over open country, though more significant tornado activity began to develop throughout the day. A high-end EF2 tornado struck [[Creston, Iowa]], flipping vehicles and causing major structural damage to homes and other buildings in town. Another EF2 wedge tornado struck [[Thurman, Iowa]], damaging 75% of the town. In Nebraska, a strong EF2 tornado destroyed outbuildings and badly damaged a home near [[Cook, Nebraska|Cook]], while a large and violent EF4 tornado leveled a home and debarked trees near [[Marquette, Kansas]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/14/us/midwest-storms/index.html?hpt=hp_t1 | work=CNN | title=Storm hits Iowa hospital; tornado warning issued for Wichita | date=April 15, 2012}}</ref> Later that evening, a cyclic supercell thunderstorm developed in northern Oklahoma before moving into southern Kansas, producing multiple tornadoes along the way. This included a large EF3 wedge tornado that destroyed homes near [[Conway Springs, Kansas|Conway Springs]]. As this supercell moved into [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] around 10:15 pm CDT (0315 UTC), another large EF3 wedge tornado touched down and caused major damage in the southeastern part of the city. Staff at the Wichita [[National Weather Service]] Weather Forecast Office at [[Wichita Mid-Continent Airport]] were forced to hand over responsibility for their County Warning Area to the National Weather Service office in Topeka and take shelter at about 10:00 pm CDT (0300 UTC), returning to duty half an hour later.

The cyclic supercell storm produced additional tornadoes as it continued into south-central Kansas, including an EF3 that passed near [[Argonia, Kansas|Argonia]] and [[Conway Springs, Kansas|Conway Springs]]. As the supercell moved into the [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] metropolitan area, a tornado touched down in the southern part of [[Haysville, Kansas|Haysville]], moving through the eastern part of town along a northeasterly path. Damage in Haysville ranged from EF0 to EF1 in intensity as homes sustained damage to roofs, windows, and garage doors. Trees were also downed, some of which landed on houses. Farther to the northeast, additional minor to moderate damage occurred as the tornado approached the southeastern city limits of Wichita. By this time, local news stations and storm spotters were reporting a large wedge tornado moving into southeastern Wichita, accompanied by numerous power flashes. Staff at the Wichita [[National Weather Service]] Weather Forecast Office on the western perimeter of the [[Wichita Mid-Continent Airport]] were forced to hand over responsibility for their County Warning Area to the National Weather Service office in [[Topeka]] and take shelter at about 10:00 pm CDT (0300 UTC), due to the close proximity of the predicted tornado track to their location. While within their shelter room, the NWS Wichita staff used a laptop computer and personal smartphones to continue to monitor the tornado on radar. The tornado ended up passing within six miles of the facility at its closest point, and the staff returned to duty half an hour later.<ref name=\"WFO ICT shelter\" /><ref>http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/120414_rpts.html</ref> The tornado reached EF3 intensity as it entered Wichita, tearing directly through the [[Oaklawn-Sunview, Kansas|Oaklawn-Sunview]] neighborhood. Major damage occurred in this residential area, as numerous one-story homes were severely damaged or destroyed, including many that lost roofs and exterior walls. One home was leveled, and many large trees were snapped, defoliated, and denuded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ksn.com/news/local/story/Large-tornado-moves-through-south-Wichita/214MfgE3ak-M0ROcP5h1zg.cspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417150605/http://www.ksn.com/news/local/story/Large-tornado-moves-through-south-Wichita/214MfgE3ak-M0ROcP5h1zg.cspx |archivedate=2012-04-17 }}</ref><ref>https://www.weather.gov/ict/april14th_sgTrack</ref>\n\nSome of the most significant damage in this area occurred at the Pinaire Mobile Home Park, where 90 of the 150 mobile homes were damaged, several of which were completely destroyed. Ruptured gas lines in the mobile home park resulted in a fire, and several residents were left trapped in the rubble, but were later rescued. Despite the severity of the damage, no fatalities occurred at the Pinaire Mobile Home Park or anywhere else along the path of the tornado. Continuing to the northeast, the tornado weakened to EF2 strength and struck [[Spirit AeroSystems]], Wichita's largest employer. Every building at the facility sustained some degree of damage, and six of the buildings sustained significant damage. One of these buildings was largely destroyed. At nearby [[McConnell Air Force Base]], hangars and fences were heavily damaged, and airplanes were damaged at the [[Kansas Aviation Museum]]. Past McConnell Air Force Base, the tornado weakened to EF1 strength and passed near the intersection of Rock Road and East Pawnee Street, snapping power poles and toppling a billboard over onto a nearby building. Minor tree, fence, and house damage occurred in residential areas along this segment of the path, and an apartment building had a large portion of its roof torn off. At the East Harry Street and South Webb Road intersection, a [[QuikTrip]], [[Dillons]], [[Walgreens]], and several other businesses sustained EF0 to EF1 damage. Continuing to the northeast, EF0 to EF1 damage continued as the tornado passed near the intersection of Greenwich Road and East Kellogg Avenue, blowing the windows out of vehicles at a car dealership and causing roof damage to the [[Hawker Beechcraft]] facility. A large [[ferris wheel]] was toppled over in the parking lot of Morningstar Community Church, where a fair had been taking place earlier in the day. Additional minor tree and house damage occurred before the tornado dissipated to the west of [[Andover, Kansas|Andover]], after injuring 38 people and causing 500 million dollars in damage. The path of this tornado bore a striking resemblance to the track of an [[April 26, 1991 tornado outbreak|F5 tornado]] that killed 17 people in Sedgwick and Butler counties on April 26, 1991.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Wichita Eagle|date=April 17, 2012|accessdate=April 19, 2012|title=Wichita tornado brings destruction, but no deaths|url=http://www.kansas.com/2012/04/15/2298200/wichita-tornado-brings-destruction.html}}</ref><ref>https://www.bizjournals.com/wichita/blog/2012/04/tornado-damage.html</ref>\n\n===Woodward, Oklahoma tornado===\n[[File:WoodwardOKEF32012.jpg|thumb|left|EF3 damage to homes in the southwestern part of Woodward, Oklahoma.]]\nTouching down {{convert|3|mi|km}} northeast of [[Arnett, Oklahoma|Arnett]] in southern [[Ellis County, Oklahoma]] at 11:50&nbsp;p.m. CDT on April 14, this deadly EF3 nighttime tornado was the only tornado of the outbreak that resulted in any fatalities. After touching down, the tornado rapidly intensified and continued through sparsely populated areas to the northeast of Arnett, destroying two homes and causing lesser damage to a few others. Damage along this segment of the path was rated EF3. The tornado tracked northeastward into [[Woodward County, Oklahoma]] around 11:59&nbsp;p.m. CDT, producing EF2 damage. Power lines were downed and two mobile homes were completely destroyed to the southeast of [[Fargo, Oklahoma|Fargo]], killing three people. Illuminated by lightning and power flashes, the large stovepipe tornado entered the southwestern part of [[Woodward, Oklahoma|Woodward]] at 12:19&nbsp;a.m. CDT on April 15.<ref>[http://www.srh.noaa.gov/images/fxc/oun/graphicast/image_full6.jpg Woodward Tornado Timeline], [[National Weather Service]] (Norman WFO), Retrieved April 16, 2012.</ref> The first area impacted in Woodward was a subdivision along Quail Drive and Meadowlake Drive. EF3 damage occurred in this areas as numerous homes were damaged or destroyed, some of which were left with only a few interior walls standing. Large trees were defoliated, snapped, and denuded, and vehicles were tossed and severely damaged. The tornado reached high-end EF3 strength as it moved through neighborhoods just to the west of 34th Street, where multiple homes had roofs ripped off and sustained collapse of exterior walls. One two-story home was completely flattened with only a pile of rubble left behind, though overall context was not indicative of a tornado exceeding high-end EF3 intensity. EF3 damage continued just beyond this point as one-story condominium buildings along Lakeside Lane were destroyed. One of the buildings at the complex was leveled, though the structures were not well-anchored to their foundations. A carpet store housed in a large retail building in this area also sustained EF3 damage, sustaining total roof loss and collapse of multiple exterior walls, with metal support beams bent. A nearby movie theater building was badly damaged as well.\n\nThe tornado then crossed Oklahoma Avenue, snapping trees and bending metal street signs to the ground. The [[Mutual of Omaha]] Customer Service Center, housed in a large and well-built office building, was impacted at low-end EF3 intensity. The structure sustained many blown out windows, roof loss, major damage to its interior, and partial exterior wall failure. Large amounts of debris was scattered throughout the area, and small ornamental trees on the property sustained some debarking. Farther to the northeast, the tornado maintained its strength as it ripped through residential areas in western Woodward, severely damaging or completely destroying many homes in the vicinity of Cheyenne Drive, Choctaw Court, and Ridgecrest Avenue. Past this area, the tornado struck the Hideaway Mobile Home Park along 26th Street in the northwestern part of town, resulting in devastating damage. Three people were killed as several mobile homes were obliterated, with their metal frames thrown and mangled. Debris was scattered in all directions, vehicles were tossed, and ground scouring was noted at the mobile home park. The tornado then exited Woodward and weakened, moving through open country before lifting at around 12:27&nbsp;a.m. CDT approximately {{convert|4|mi|km}} northeast of Woodward in northwestern Woodward County. 89 homes and 13 businesses were reportedly damaged or destroyed in Woodward, including 10 houses that were leveled. 6 people were killed by the tornado, and 28 others were injured.<ref name=\"Woodward Tornado\">[http://www.koco.com/news/30898939/detail.html Woodward Death Toll Rises To 6], [[KOCO-TV]], April 16, 2012.</ref><ref>https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/StormDamage/DamageViewer/</ref>\n\nThe 20 outdoor warning sirens located throughout Woodward did not sound prior to the tornado striking the town.

Numerous other tornadoes occurred, including a violent EF4 tornado that passed near [[Marquette, Kansas]], and an EF3 that caused major damage in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]].\n\n==Meteorological synopsis==\nAn impressive low pressure area and associated trough began tracking into the Great Plains on April 13, and a slight risk of severe weather was issued. The outlook mentioned the possibility of tornadoes, including the risk for isolated strong tornadoes. No strong tornadoes occurred, though an EF1 tornado caused considerable damage in [[Norman, Oklahoma]].\n[[File:Evolution of SPC Forecasts Leading to April 14, 2012.png|thumb|left|A montage of the Storm Prediction Center's severe weather outlooks leading up to the outbreak.

In the discussion, the SPC stated that a major tornado outbreak was likely across central Kansas and north-central Oklahoma during the afternoon and overnight hours of April 14, with long-tracked violent tornadoes likely. It was later expanded to include a second high risk area across much of Nebraska, where a rare 45% tornado probability was given during the late morning update on April&nbsp;13.  During the morning hours on the 14th, the high risk area was expanded again to combine the two separate areas into a single large one. Later in the day, the 45% tornado probability was shifted from Nebraska south to Kansas and northern Oklahoma. A large outbreak of tornadoes impacted the Great Plains states on April 14, and several [[Particularly dangerous situation|PDS]] [[Tornado Warning]]s were issued during the outbreak. Initially, most of the tornadoes were small or remained over open country, though more significant tornado activity began to develop throughout the day. A high-end EF2 tornado struck [[Creston, Iowa]], flipping vehicles and causing major structural damage to homes and other buildings in town. Another EF2 wedge tornado struck [[Thurman, Iowa]], damaging 75% of the town. In Nebraska, a strong EF2 tornado destroyed outbuildings and badly damaged a home near [[Cook, Nebraska|Cook]], while a large and violent EF4 tornado leveled a home and debarked trees near [[Marquette, Kansas]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/14/us/midwest-storms/index.html?hpt=hp_t1 | work=CNN | title=Storm hits Iowa hospital; tornado warning issued for Wichita | date=April 15, 2012}}</ref> Later that evening, a cyclic supercell thunderstorm developed in northern Oklahoma before moving into southern Kansas, producing multiple tornadoes along the way.

The cyclic supercell storm produced additional tornadoes as it continued into south-central Kansas, including an EF3 that passed near [[Argonia, Kansas|Argonia]] and [[Conway Springs, Kansas|Conway Springs]]. As the supercell moved into the [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] metropolitan area, a tornado touched down in the southern part of [[Haysville, Kansas|Haysville]], moving through the eastern part of town along a northeasterly path. Damage in Haysville ranged from EF0 to EF1 in intensity as homes sustained damage to roofs, windows, and garage doors. Trees were also downed, some of which landed on houses. Farther to the northeast, additional minor to moderate damage occurred as the tornado approached the southeastern city limits of Wichita. By this time, local news stations and storm spotters were reporting a large wedge tornado moving into southeastern Wichita, accompanied by numerous power flashes. Staff at the Wichita [[National Weather Service]] Weather Forecast Office on the western perimeter of the [[Wichita Mid-Continent Airport]] were forced to hand over responsibility for their County Warning Area to the National Weather Service office in [[Topeka]] and take shelter at about 10:00 pm CDT (0300 UTC), due to the close proximity of the predicted tornado track to their location. While within their shelter room, the NWS Wichita staff used a laptop computer and personal smartphones to continue to monitor the tornado on radar. The tornado ended up passing within six miles of the facility at its closest point, and the staff returned to duty half an hour later.<ref name=\"WFO ICT shelter\" /><ref>http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/120414_rpts.html</ref> The tornado reached EF3 intensity as it entered Wichita, tearing directly through the [[Oaklawn-Sunview, Kansas|Oaklawn-Sunview]] neighborhood. Major damage occurred in this residential area, as numerous one-story homes were severely damaged or destroyed, including many that lost roofs and exterior walls. One home was leveled, and many large trees were snapped, defoliated, and denuded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ksn.com/news/local/story/Large-tornado-moves-through-south-Wichita/214MfgE3ak-M0ROcP5h1zg.cspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417150605/http://www.ksn.com/news/local/story/Large-tornado-moves-through-south-Wichita/214MfgE3ak-M0ROcP5h1zg.cspx |archivedate=2012-04-17 }}</ref><ref>https://www.weather.gov/ict/april14th_sgTrack</ref>\n\nSome of the most significant damage in this area occurred at the Pinaire Mobile Home Park, where 90 of the 150 mobile homes were damaged, several of which were completely destroyed. Ruptured gas lines in the mobile home park resulted in a fire, and several residents were left trapped in the rubble, but were later rescued. Despite the severity of the damage, no fatalities occurred at the Pinaire Mobile Home Park or anywhere else along the path of the tornado. Continuing to the northeast, the tornado weakened to EF2 strength and struck [[Spirit AeroSystems]], Wichita's largest employer. Every building at the facility sustained some degree of damage, and six of the buildings sustained significant damage. One of these buildings was largely destroyed. At nearby [[McConnell Air Force Base]], hangars and fences were heavily damaged, and airplanes were damaged at the [[Kansas Aviation Museum]]. Past McConnell Air Force Base, the tornado weakened to EF1 strength and passed near the intersection of Rock Road and East Pawnee Street, snapping power poles and toppling a billboard over onto a nearby building. Minor tree, fence, and house damage occurred in residential areas along this segment of the path, and an apartment building had a large portion of its roof torn off. At the East Harry Street and South Webb Road intersection, a [[QuikTrip]], [[Dillons]], [[Walgreens]], and several other businesses sustained EF0 to EF1 damage. Continuing to the northeast, EF0 to EF1 damage continued as the tornado passed near the intersection of Greenwich Road and East Kellogg Avenue, blowing the windows out of vehicles at a car dealership and causing roof damage to the [[Hawker Beechcraft]] facility. A large [[ferris wheel]] was toppled over in the parking lot of Morningstar Community Church, where a fair had been taking place earlier in the day. Additional minor tree and house damage occurred before the tornado dissipated to the west of [[Andover, Kansas|Andover]], after injuring 38 people and causing 500 million dollars in damage. The path of this tornado bore a striking resemblance to the track of an [[April 26, 1991 tornado outbreak|F5 tornado]] that killed 17 people in Sedgwick and Butler counties on April 26, 1991.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Wichita Eagle|date=April 17, 2012|accessdate=April 19, 2012|title=Wichita tornado brings destruction, but no deaths|url=http://www.kansas.com/2012/04/15/2298200/wichita-tornado-brings-destruction.html}}</ref><ref>https://www.bizjournals.com/wichita/blog/2012/04/tornado-damage.html</ref>\n\n===Woodward, Oklahoma tornado===\n[[File:WoodwardOKEF32012.jpg|thumb|left|EF3 damage to homes in the southwestern part of Woodward, Oklahoma.]]\nTouching down {{convert|3|mi|km}} northeast of [[Arnett, Oklahoma|Arnett]] in southern [[Ellis County, Oklahoma]] at 11:50&nbsp;p.m. CDT on April 14, this deadly EF3 nighttime tornado was the only tornado of the outbreak that resulted in any fatalities. After touching down, the tornado rapidly intensified and continued through sparsely populated areas to the northeast of Arnett, destroying two homes and causing lesser damage to a few others. Damage along this segment of the path was rated EF3. The tornado tracked northeastward into [[Woodward County, Oklahoma]] around 11:59&nbsp;p.m. CDT, producing EF2 damage. Power lines were downed and two mobile homes were completely destroyed to the southeast of [[Fargo, Oklahoma|Fargo]], killing three people. Illuminated by lightning and power flashes, the large stovepipe tornado entered the southwestern part of [[Woodward, Oklahoma|Woodward]] at 12:19&nbsp;a.m. CDT on April 15.<ref>[http://www.srh.noaa.gov/images/fxc/oun/graphicast/image_full6.jpg Woodward Tornado Timeline], [[National Weather Service]] (Norman WFO), Retrieved April 16, 2012.</ref> The first area impacted in Woodward was a subdivision along Quail Drive and Meadowlake Drive. EF3 damage occurred in this areas as numerous homes were damaged or destroyed, some of which were left with only a few interior walls standing. Large trees were defoliated, snapped, and denuded, and vehicles were tossed and severely damaged. The tornado reached high-end EF3 strength as it moved through neighborhoods just to the west of 34th Street, where multiple homes had roofs ripped off and sustained collapse of exterior walls. One two-story home was completely flattened with only a pile of rubble left behind, though overall context was not indicative of a tornado exceeding high-end EF3 intensity. EF3 damage continued just beyond this point as one-story condominium buildings along Lakeside Lane were destroyed. One of the buildings at the complex was leveled, though the structures were not well-anchored to their foundations. A carpet store housed in a large retail building in this area also sustained EF3 damage, sustaining total roof loss and collapse of multiple exterior walls, with metal support beams bent. A nearby movie theater building was badly damaged as well.\n\nThe tornado then crossed Oklahoma Avenue, snapping trees and bending metal street signs to the ground. The [[Mutual of Omaha]] Customer Service Center, housed in a large and well-built office building, was impacted at low-end EF3 intensity. The structure sustained many blown out windows, roof loss, major damage to its interior, and partial exterior wall failure. Large amounts of debris was scattered throughout the area, and small ornamental trees on the property sustained some debarking. Farther to the northeast, the tornado maintained its strength as it ripped through residential areas in western Woodward, severely damaging or completely destroying many homes in the vicinity of Cheyenne Drive, Choctaw Court, and Ridgecrest Avenue. Past this area, the tornado struck the Hideaway Mobile Home Park along 26th Street in the northwestern part of town, resulting in devastating damage. Three people were killed as several mobile homes were obliterated, with their metal frames thrown and mangled. Debris was scattered in all directions, vehicles were tossed, and ground scouring was noted at the mobile home park. The tornado then exited Woodward and weakened, moving through open country before lifting at around 12:27&nbsp;a.m. CDT approximately {{convert|4|mi|km}} northeast of Woodward in northwestern Woodward County. 89 homes and 13 businesses were reportedly damaged or destroyed in Woodward, including 10 houses that were leveled. 6 people were killed by the tornado, and 28 others were injured.<ref name=\"Woodward Tornado\">[http://www.koco.com/news/30898939/detail.html Woodward Death Toll Rises To 6], [[KOCO-TV]], April 16, 2012.</ref><ref>https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/StormDamage/DamageViewer/</ref>\n\nThe 20 outdoor warning sirens located throughout Woodward did not sound prior to the tornado striking the town. This was due to lightning strike damage from the previous day sustained to a tower used to activate the local electricity-powered siren warning system. As a result, most Woodward area residents had to rely on warnings either from local television stations broadcasting from the [[Oklahoma City metropolitan area|Oklahoma City market]] through [[cable television|cable]] and [[satellite television]] or [[NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards]].<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57414503/experts-dont-rely-just-on-tornado-warning-sirens/ Experts: Don't rely just on tornado warning sirens], [[CBS News]], April 16, 2012.</ref><ref>[http://kfor.com/2012/04/15/how-reliable-are-okla-tornado-sirens/ How reliable are Okla. tornado sirens?], [[KFOR-TV]], April 15, 2012.

Originally, the ruble was the currency unit of [[Imperial Russia]] and then the [[Soviet Union]] (as the [[Soviet ruble]]). {{Asof|2020}} it is the currency unit of [[Russia]] (as the [[Russian ruble]]), [[Belarus]] (as the [[Belarussian ruble]]) and [[Transnistria]] (as the [[Transnistrian ruble]]). The Russian ruble is also used in two regions of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the partially recognised states (including by Russia) [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]].

The weight of one ''ruble'' was equal to the weight of one ''grivna''.\n\nIn Russian, a folk name for ruble, ''tselkovyj'' (\u0446\u0435\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0301\u0432\u044b\u0439, {{IPA-ru|ts\u0268l\u02c8kov\u0268j|IPA}}, wholesome), is known, which is a shortening of the \u0446\u0435\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0443\u0431\u043b\u044c (\"tselkovyj ruble\"), i.e., a wholesome, uncut ruble.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} This name persists in the [[Mordvin language|Mordvin]] word for ruble, ''\u0446\u0435\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439''.\n\nThe word ''kopek'', ''kopeck'', ''copeck'', or ''kopeyka'' (in {{lang-ru|link=no|\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0439\u043a\u0430}}, ''kopeyka'') is a diminutive form of the Russian ''kop'yo'' (\u043a\u043e\u043f\u044c\u0451) \u2014 a [[spear]]. The first kopek coins, minted at [[Novgorod]] and [[Pskov]] from about 1534 onwards, show a horseman with a spear.  From the 1540s onwards the horseman bears a crown, and doubtless the intention was to represent [[Ivan the Terrible]], who was Grand Prince of all Russia until 1547, and Tsar thereafter. Subsequent mintings of the coin, starting in the 18th century, bear instead Saint George striking down a serpent.\n\nSince the monetary reform of 1534, one Russian accounting ruble became equivalent to 100 silver Novgorod [[denga]] coins or smaller 200 Muscovite denga coins or even smaller 400 ''[[polushka]]'' coins. Exactly the former coin with a rider on it soon became colloquially known as ''kopek'' and was the higher coin until the beginning of the 18th century. Ruble coins as such did not exist till Peter the Great, when in 1704 he reformed the old monetary system and ordered mintage of a 28-gramme silver ruble coin equivalent to 100 new copper kopek coins. Apart from one ruble and one kopek coins other smaller and greater coins existed as well.\n\n===English spelling===<!-- This section is linked from [[Russian ruble]] -->\n[[File:Russian rubles.jpg|thumbnail|Russian rubles \u2013 banknotes of 1000 and 5000 rubles.]]\nBoth the spellings ''ruble'' and ''rouble'' are used in English.  The form ''rouble'' is preferred by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], but the earliest use recorded in English is the now completely obsolete ''robble''. The form ''rouble'' probably derives from the transliteration into French used among the [[Tsarist]] [[aristocracy]]. There are two main usage tendencies: one is for [[North American]] authors to use ''ruble'' and other English speakers to use ''rouble'', while the other is for older sources to use ''rouble'' and more recent ones to use ''ruble''. Neither tendency is absolutely consistent, and there is also the obvious danger of confusion with ''rubble''.\n\nThe Russian [[plural]]s that may be seen on the actual currency are modified according to [[Russian grammar]]. Numbers ending in 1 (except for 11) are followed by [[nominative]] singular \u0440\u0443\u0431\u043b\u044c ''rubl\u2032'', \u043a\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0301\u0439\u043a\u0430 ''kop\u00e9yka''.

Especially in [[Turkic languages]] or languages influenced by them, the ruble is often known (also officially) as ''som'' or ''sum'' (meaning ''pure''), or ''manat'' (from Russian ''moneta'', meaning ''coin''). Soviet banknotes had their value printed in the [[Languages of the Soviet Union|languages]] of all [[Soviet republics|15 republics]] of the Soviet Union.\n\n==History==\n===Imperial ruble (14th century \u2013 1917)===\n[[File:Russian Empire 1912 500 rub Obverse.jpg|thumb|Five hundred rubles featuring [[Peter the Great]] and a [[personification]] of [[Mother Russia]], 1912]]\n[[File:Russian Empire-1898-Bill-1-Reverse.jpg|thumb|1898 [[Russian Empire]] one ruble bill, obverse]]\nFrom the 14th to the 17th centuries the ruble was neither a coin nor a currency but rather a unit of weight. The most used currency was a small silver coin called ''denga'' (pl. ''dengi''). There were two variants of the denga minted in [[Veliki Novgorod|Novgorod]] and Moscow. The weight of a denga silver coin was unstable and inflating, but by 1535 one Novgorod denga weighted {{convert|0.68|g|ozt|abbr=off}}, the Moscow denga being a half of the Novgorod denga. Thus one ''account ruble'' consisted of 100 Novgorod or 200 Moscow dengi ({{convert|68|g|ozt|abbr=on}} of silver). As the Novgorod denga bore the image of a rider with a spear ({{lang-ru|\u043a\u043e\u043f\u044c\u0451, kop\u2019yo}}), it later has become known as ''kopek''. In the 17th century the weight of a kopek coin lowered to {{convert|0.48|g|ozt|abbr=on}}, thus one ruble was equal to {{convert|48|g|ozt|abbr=on}} of silver.<ref name=RusMetr/><ref name=Spas1970/>\n\nIn 1654\u20131655 tsar [[Alexis I]] tried to carry out a monetary reform and ordered to mint silver one ruble coins from imported [[joachimsthaler]]s and new kopek coins from copper (old silver kopeks was left in circulation). Although around 1 million of such rubles was made, its lower weight (28\u201332 grams) against the nominal ruble (48 g) led to counterfeit, speculation and inflation, and after the [[Copper Riot]] of 1662 the new monetary system was abandoned in favour of the old one.<ref name=RusMetr/><ref name=Spas1970/>\n\n====Russian Empire====\nIn 1704 [[Peter the Great]] finally reformed the old Russian monetary system, ordering the minting of a {{convert|28|g|oz|abbr=on|adj=on}} silver ruble coin equivalent to 100 new copper kopek coins, thus making the Russian ruble the world's first decimal currency.<ref name=RusMetr/>\n\nThe amount of precious metal in a ruble varied over time. In a 1704 currency reform, [[Peter the Great]] standardized the ruble to 28&nbsp;grams{{clarify|reason=Grams had not been invented. How many of what unit did he actually specify?|date=June 2018}} of silver. While ruble coins were silver, there were higher denominations minted of gold and [[platinum]]. By the end of the 18th century, the ruble was set to 4 [[zolotnik]] 21 dolya (almost exactly equal to 18&nbsp;grams) of pure silver or 27 dolya (almost exactly equal to 1.2&nbsp;grams) of pure gold, with a ratio of 15:1 for the values of the two metals. In 1828, platinum coins were introduced with 1 ruble equal to 77\u2154 dolya (3.451&nbsp;grams).\n\nOn 17 December 1885, a new standard was adopted which did not change the silver ruble but reduced the gold content to 1.161&nbsp;grams, pegging the gold ruble to the [[French franc]] at a rate of 1 ruble = 4 francs. This rate was revised in 1897 to 1 ruble = 2\u2154 francs (0.774&nbsp;grams gold).\n\nThe ruble was worth about 0.50 USD in 1914.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberussr.com/hcunn/gold-std.html |title=Gold and Silver Standards |publisher=Cyberussr.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dollartimes.com/inflation/inflation.php?amount=100000&year=1914 |title=Calculate the value of $100000 in 1914 \u2013 Inflation on 100000 dollars |publisher=DollarTimes.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-30}}</ref>\n\nWith the outbreak of [[World War I]], the [[gold standard]] peg was dropped and the ruble fell in value, suffering from [[hyperinflation]] in the early 1920s. With the founding of the Soviet Union in 1922, the Russian ruble was replaced by the Soviet ruble. The pre-revolutionary [[Chervonets|Chervonetz]] was temporarily brought back into circulation from 1922\u20131925.<ref>''La Crise de la Monnaie Anglaise'' (1931), Catiforis S.J.

The provisional government lasted approximately eight months, and ceased to exist when the Bolsheviks gained power after the October Revolution in October [November, N.S.] 1917.\n\n===Soviet ruble (1917\u20131992)===\n{{Main|Soviet ruble}}\n\nThe [[Soviet ruble]] replaced the ruble of the Russian Empire. The Soviet ruble (code: SUR) was the currency of the [[Soviet Union]] between 1917 and the [[breakup of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. The Soviet ruble was issued by the [[Gosbank|State Bank of the USSR]]. The Soviet ruble continued to be used in the 15 [[Post-Soviet states]].\n\nThe Soviet ruble was used until 1992 in [[Russia]] (replaced by [[Russian ruble]]), [[Ukraine]] (replaced by [[Ukrainian karbovanets]]), [[Estonia]] (replaced by [[Estonian kroon]]), [[Latvia]] (replaced by [[Latvian rublis]]), [[Lithuania]] (replaced by [[Lithuanian talonas]]), and until 1993 in [[Belarus]] (replaced by [[Belarusian ruble]]), [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (replaced by [[Georgian lari]]), [[Armenia]] (replaced by [[Armenian dram]]), [[Kazakhstan]] (replaced by [[Kazakhstani tenge]]), [[Kyrgyzstan]] (replaced by [[Kyrgyzstani som]]), [[Moldova]] (replaced by [[Moldovan cupon]]), [[Turkmenistan]] (replaced by [[Turkmenistan manat]]), [[Uzbekistan]] (replaced by [[Uzbekistani so'm]]), and until 1994 in [[Azerbaijan]] (replaced by [[Azerbaijani manat]]) and until 1995 in [[Tajikistan]] (replaced by [[Tajikistani ruble]]).\n<ref>[[Russian Provisional Government]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=October 2019}}\n\n==List of rubles==\n===Current===\n* [[Russian ruble]]\n* [[Belarusian ruble]]\n* [[Transnistrian ruble]]\n\n===Obsolete===\n(This list may not contain all historical rubles, especially rubles issued by sub-national entities)\n; Soviet ruble\n* [[Sovznak]]\n* Ruble of the Far-Eastern Republic\n* Transcaucasian ruble\n* [[Chervonets]]\n* [[Soviet ruble]], in various Soviet republics the ruble carried local names as well\n\n;Pre-Soviet currency\n* [[Armenian ruble]]\n* [[Azerbaijani ruble]] (''ruble'' is the Russian name of the first [[Azerbaijani manat]])\n* Georgian ruble (''ruble'' is the Russian name of the [[Georgian maneti]])\n* [[Latvian rublis]]\n* {{ill|Ruble of Svalbard|ru|\u0420\u0443\u0431\u043b\u044c \u0428\u043f\u0438\u0446\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0430}}\n* [[Tajikistani ruble]]\n* [[Transcaucasian ruble]]\n* Ukrainian coupon ([[Ukrainian karbovanets]])\n* [[Tuva]]n [[ak\u015fa]] and [[k\u0275pejek]]\n\n;Ruble of Imperial Russia\n* Silver ruble (1704\u20131897), [[Assignation ruble]] (1769\u20131849), [[Constantine ruble]] (collectible)\n* Gold ruble (1897\u20131917), Brut ruble (credit banknote)\n* Copper ruble and Sestroretsk ruble\n\n;Rubles of World War I and the Russian Civil War\n* [[German ostruble]] (1916\u20131918)\n* [[Kerenka]] (1917\u20131919)\n* Odessa ruble\n* Don ruble\n* Siberia ruble\n* Harbin ruble\n\n;Others\n* [[Lithuanian long currency|Lithuanian ruble / grivna]] (until 1579)\n\n{{Portal|Numismatics|Money}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|ruble|rouble}}\n* [http://monety-rossii.com \u041c\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0442\u044b \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420]\n* [http://www.historicalstatistics.org/Currencyconverter.html Historical Currency Converter] Historical value of the ruble in other currencies\n{{Ruble}}\n\n[[Category:Modern obsolete currencies]]\n[[Category:Denominations (currency)]]\n[[Category:Currencies of Russia]]\n[[Category:Numismatics]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|currency units named ruble|the Russian currency unit|Russian ruble|the ruble in the [[Soviet Union]]|Soviet ruble}}\n{{short description|Currencies with \"rouble\"}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2012}}\n[[File:Banknote 5000 rubles (1997) front.jpg|thumb|5000 [[Russian ruble]]s issued in 2006]]\n[[File:100000-rubles-Belarus-2000-f.jpg|thumb|100,000 [[Belarusian ruble]]s issued in 2000]]\n[[File:100 Olympic rubles.jpg|thumb|150px|Vertical 100 [[Russian ruble]]s issued in 2013, printed to commemorate the Olympic Games in Sochi-2014]]\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Transnistria rubla 2000.jpg|thumb|1 [[Transnistrian ruble]] issued in 2000]] -->\n\nThe '''ruble''' or '''rouble''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|r|u\u02d0|b|\u0259l}}; {{lang-rus|\u0440\u0443\u0431\u043b\u044c|p=rubl\u02b2}}) or '''[[Ruble sign|\u20bd]]''' is or was a [[currency]] unit of a number of countries in Eastern Europe closely associated with the [[economy of Russia]].

The weight of one ''ruble'' was equal to the weight of one ''grivna''.\n\nIn Russian, a folk name for ruble, ''tselkovyj'' (\u0446\u0435\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0301\u0432\u044b\u0439, {{IPA-ru|ts\u0268l\u02c8kov\u0268j|IPA}}, wholesome), is known, which is a shortening of the \u0446\u0435\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0443\u0431\u043b\u044c (\"tselkovyj ruble\"), i.e., a wholesome, uncut ruble.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} This name persists in the [[Mordvin language|Mordvin]] word for ruble, ''\u0446\u0435\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439''.\n\nThe word ''kopek'', ''kopeck'', ''copeck'', or ''kopeyka'' (in {{lang-ru|link=no|\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0439\u043a\u0430}}, ''kopeyka'') is a diminutive form of the Russian ''kop'yo'' (\u043a\u043e\u043f\u044c\u0451) \u2014 a [[spear]]. The first kopek coins, minted at [[Novgorod]] and [[Pskov]] from about 1534 onwards, show a horseman with a spear.  From the 1540s onwards the horseman bears a crown, and doubtless the intention was to represent [[Ivan the Terrible]], who was Grand Prince of all Russia until 1547, and Tsar thereafter. Subsequent mintings of the coin, starting in the 18th century, bear instead Saint George striking down a serpent.\n\nSince the monetary reform of 1534, one Russian accounting ruble became equivalent to 100 silver Novgorod [[denga]] coins or smaller 200 Muscovite denga coins or even smaller 400 ''[[polushka]]'' coins. Exactly the former coin with a rider on it soon became colloquially known as ''kopek'' and was the higher coin until the beginning of the 18th century. Ruble coins as such did not exist till Peter the Great, when in 1704 he reformed the old monetary system and ordered mintage of a 28-gramme silver ruble coin equivalent to 100 new copper kopek coins. Apart from one ruble and one kopek coins other smaller and greater coins existed as well.\n\n===English spelling===<!-- This section is linked from [[Russian ruble]] -->\n[[File:Russian rubles.jpg|thumbnail|Russian rubles \u2013 banknotes of 1000 and 5000 rubles.]]\nBoth the spellings ''ruble'' and ''rouble'' are used in English.  The form ''rouble'' is preferred by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], but the earliest use recorded in English is the now completely obsolete ''robble''. The form ''rouble'' probably derives from the transliteration into French used among the [[Tsarist]] [[aristocracy]]. There are two main usage tendencies: one is for [[North American]] authors to use ''ruble'' and other English speakers to use ''rouble'', while the other is for older sources to use ''rouble'' and more recent ones to use ''ruble''. Neither tendency is absolutely consistent, and there is also the obvious danger of confusion with ''rubble''.\n\nThe Russian [[plural]]s that may be seen on the actual currency are modified according to [[Russian grammar]]. Numbers ending in 1 (except for 11) are followed by [[nominative]] singular \u0440\u0443\u0431\u043b\u044c ''rubl\u2032'', \u043a\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0301\u0439\u043a\u0430 ''kop\u00e9yka''.

Especially in [[Turkic languages]] or languages influenced by them, the ruble is often known (also officially) as ''som'' or ''sum'' (meaning ''pure''), or ''manat'' (from Russian ''moneta'', meaning ''coin''). Soviet banknotes had their value printed in the [[Languages of the Soviet Union|languages]] of all [[Soviet republics|15 republics]] of the Soviet Union.\n\n==History==\n===Imperial ruble (14th century \u2013 1917)===\n[[File:Russian Empire 1912 500 rub Obverse.jpg|thumb|Five hundred rubles featuring [[Peter the Great]] and a [[personification]] of [[Mother Russia]], 1912]]\n[[File:Russian Empire-1898-Bill-1-Reverse.jpg|thumb|1898 [[Russian Empire]] one ruble bill, obverse]]\nFrom the 14th to the 17th centuries the ruble was neither a coin nor a currency but rather a unit of weight. The most used currency was a small silver coin called ''denga'' (pl. ''dengi''). There were two variants of the denga minted in [[Veliki Novgorod|Novgorod]] and Moscow. The weight of a denga silver coin was unstable and inflating, but by 1535 one Novgorod denga weighted {{convert|0.68|g|ozt|abbr=off}}, the Moscow denga being a half of the Novgorod denga. Thus one ''account ruble'' consisted of 100 Novgorod or 200 Moscow dengi ({{convert|68|g|ozt|abbr=on}} of silver). As the Novgorod denga bore the image of a rider with a spear ({{lang-ru|\u043a\u043e\u043f\u044c\u0451, kop\u2019yo}}), it later has become known as ''kopek''. In the 17th century the weight of a kopek coin lowered to {{convert|0.48|g|ozt|abbr=on}}, thus one ruble was equal to {{convert|48|g|ozt|abbr=on}} of silver.<ref name=RusMetr/><ref name=Spas1970/>\n\nIn 1654\u20131655 tsar [[Alexis I]] tried to carry out a monetary reform and ordered to mint silver one ruble coins from imported [[joachimsthaler]]s and new kopek coins from copper (old silver kopeks was left in circulation). Although around 1 million of such rubles was made, its lower weight (28\u201332 grams) against the nominal ruble (48 g) led to counterfeit, speculation and inflation, and after the [[Copper Riot]] of 1662 the new monetary system was abandoned in favour of the old one.<ref name=RusMetr/><ref name=Spas1970/>\n\n====Russian Empire====\nIn 1704 [[Peter the Great]] finally reformed the old Russian monetary system, ordering the minting of a {{convert|28|g|oz|abbr=on|adj=on}} silver ruble coin equivalent to 100 new copper kopek coins, thus making the Russian ruble the world's first decimal currency.<ref name=RusMetr/>\n\nThe amount of precious metal in a ruble varied over time. In a 1704 currency reform, [[Peter the Great]] standardized the ruble to 28&nbsp;grams{{clarify|reason=Grams had not been invented. How many of what unit did he actually specify?|date=June 2018}} of silver. While ruble coins were silver, there were higher denominations minted of gold and [[platinum]]. By the end of the 18th century, the ruble was set to 4 [[zolotnik]] 21 dolya (almost exactly equal to 18&nbsp;grams) of pure silver or 27 dolya (almost exactly equal to 1.2&nbsp;grams) of pure gold, with a ratio of 15:1 for the values of the two metals. In 1828, platinum coins were introduced with 1 ruble equal to 77\u2154 dolya (3.451&nbsp;grams).\n\nOn 17 December 1885, a new standard was adopted which did not change the silver ruble but reduced the gold content to 1.161&nbsp;grams, pegging the gold ruble to the [[French franc]] at a rate of 1 ruble = 4 francs. This rate was revised in 1897 to 1 ruble = 2\u2154 francs (0.774&nbsp;grams gold).\n\nThe ruble was worth about 0.50 USD in 1914.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberussr.com/hcunn/gold-std.html |title=Gold and Silver Standards |publisher=Cyberussr.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dollartimes.com/inflation/inflation.php?amount=100000&year=1914 |title=Calculate the value of $100000 in 1914 \u2013 Inflation on 100000 dollars |publisher=DollarTimes.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-30}}</ref>\n\nWith the outbreak of [[World War I]], the [[gold standard]] peg was dropped and the ruble fell in value, suffering from [[hyperinflation]] in the early 1920s. With the founding of the Soviet Union in 1922, the Russian ruble was replaced by the Soviet ruble. The pre-revolutionary [[Chervonets|Chervonetz]] was temporarily brought back into circulation from 1922\u20131925.<ref>''La Crise de la Monnaie Anglaise'' (1931), Catiforis S.J.

Silver 20 kopeks were introduced in 1820, followed by copper 10 kopeks minted between 1830 and 1839, and copper 3 kopeks introduced in 1840. Between 1828 and 1845, platinum 3, 6 and 12 rubles were issued. In 1860, silver 15 kopeks were introduced, due to the use of this denomination (equal to 1 [[Polish z\u0142oty|z\u0142oty]]) in Poland, whilst, in 1869, gold 3 rubles were introduced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pjsymes.com.au/articles/three.htm |title=Currency of Three |author=Peter Symes |publisher=Pjsymes.com.au |accessdate=2015-08-30}}</ref> In 1886, a new gold coinage was introduced consisting of 5 and 10 ruble coins. This was followed by another in 1897. In addition to smaller 5 and 10 ruble coins, {{frac|7|1|2}} and 15 ruble coins were issued for a single year, as these were equal in size to the previous 5 and 10 ruble coins.

Its manufacture was being prepared at the [[Saint Petersburg Mint]] during the brief [[Russian interregnum of 1825|Interregnum of 1825]], but it was never minted in numbers, and never circulated in public. Its existence became known in 1857 in foreign publications.<ref>By 1880 Russian numismatists were well aware of the existence of Constantine rubles, but their first printed description was published only in 1886 \u2013 Kalinin, [http://www.arcamax.ru/books/const/kalin01.htm p.1].</ref>\n\n====Banknotes====\n=====Imperial issues=====\n[[File:25 rublej 1769 goda..jpg|thumb|25 Assignation rubles of 1769]]\n[[File:Russian Empire-1898-Bill-1-Obverse.jpg|thumb|1898 [[Russian Empire]] one ruble bill, reverse]]\n\nIn 1768, during the reign of [[Catherine the Great]], the [[:Saint Petersburg State University of Economics and Finance#Assignation Bank|Assignation Bank]] was instituted to issue the government paper money. It opened in [[Saint Petersburg]] and in Moscow in 1769.\n\nIn 1769, [[Assignation ruble]]s were introduced for 25, 50, 75 and 100 rubles, with 5 and 10 rubles added in 1787 and 200 ruble in 1819. The value of the Assignation rubles fell relative to the coins until, in 1839, the relationship was fixed at 1 coin ruble = 3\u00bd assignat rubles. In 1840, the State Commercial Bank issued 3, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 rubles notes, followed by 50 ruble credit notes of the Custody Treasury and State Loan Bank.\n\nIn 1843, the Assignation Bank ceased operations, and ''state credit notes'' (Russian: {{lang|ru|\u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0431\u0438\u043b\u0435\u0442\u044b}}, {{lang|ru-Latn|gosudarstvenniye kreditniye bilety}}) were introduced in denominations of 1, 3, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 rubles. In 1859 a paper credit ruble was worth about nine tenths of a silver ruble <ref>Jerome Blum, The End of the Old Order in Rural Europe, 1978, p169</ref> These circulated, in various types, until the revolution, with 500 rubles notes added in 1898 and 250 and 1000 rubles notes added in 1917. In 1915, two kinds of small change notes were issued. One, issued by the Treasury, consisted of regular style (if small) notes for 1, 2, 3, 5 and 50 kopeks. The other consisted of the designs of stamps printed onto card with text and the imperial eagle printed on the reverse. These were in denominations of 1, 2, 3, 10, 15 and 20 kopeks.\n\n=====Provisional Government issues=====\nIn 1917, the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] issued treasury notes for 20 and 40 rubles. These notes are known as \"Kerenski\" or \"[[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]] rubles\". The provisional government also had 25 and 1,000 rubles state credit notes printed in the United States but most were not issued.\n\n=====Provisional Government=====\nThe Russian Provisional Government (Russian: \u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438, tr. Vremennoye pravitel'stvo Rossii) was a provisional government of Russia established immediately following the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II of the Russian Empire on 2 March [15 March, New Style] 1917.[1][2] The intention of the provisional government was the organization of elections to the Russian Constituent Assembly and its convention. The provisional government lasted approximately eight months, and ceased to exist when the Bolsheviks gained power after the October Revolution in October [November, N.S.] 1917.\n\n===Soviet ruble (1917\u20131992)===\n{{Main|Soviet ruble}}\n\nThe [[Soviet ruble]] replaced the ruble of the Russian Empire. The Soviet ruble (code: SUR) was the currency of the [[Soviet Union]] between 1917 and the [[breakup of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. The Soviet ruble was issued by the [[Gosbank|State Bank of the USSR]]. The Soviet ruble continued to be used in the 15 [[Post-Soviet states]].\n\nThe Soviet ruble was used until 1992 in [[Russia]] (replaced by [[Russian ruble]]), [[Ukraine]] (replaced by [[Ukrainian karbovanets]]), [[Estonia]] (replaced by [[Estonian kroon]]), [[Latvia]] (replaced by [[Latvian rublis]]), [[Lithuania]] (replaced by [[Lithuanian talonas]]), and until 1993 in [[Belarus]] (replaced by [[Belarusian ruble]]), [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (replaced by [[Georgian lari]]), [[Armenia]] (replaced by [[Armenian dram]]), [[Kazakhstan]] (replaced by [[Kazakhstani tenge]]), [[Kyrgyzstan]] (replaced by [[Kyrgyzstani som]]), [[Moldova]] (replaced by [[Moldovan cupon]]), [[Turkmenistan]] (replaced by [[Turkmenistan manat]]), [[Uzbekistan]] (replaced by [[Uzbekistani so'm]]), and until 1994 in [[Azerbaijan]] (replaced by [[Azerbaijani manat]]) and until 1995 in [[Tajikistan]] (replaced by [[Tajikistani ruble]]).\n<ref>[[Russian Provisional Government]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=October 2019}}\n\n==List of rubles==\n===Current===\n* [[Russian ruble]]\n* [[Belarusian ruble]]\n* [[Transnistrian ruble]]\n\n===Obsolete===\n(This list may not contain all historical rubles, especially rubles issued by sub-national entities)\n; Soviet ruble\n* [[Sovznak]]\n* Ruble of the Far-Eastern Republic\n* Transcaucasian ruble\n* [[Chervonets]]\n* [[Soviet ruble]], in various Soviet republics the ruble carried local names as well\n\n;Pre-Soviet currency\n* [[Armenian ruble]]\n* [[Azerbaijani ruble]] (''ruble'' is the Russian name of the first [[Azerbaijani manat]])\n* Georgian ruble (''ruble'' is the Russian name of the [[Georgian maneti]])\n* [[Latvian rublis]]\n* {{ill|Ruble of Svalbard|ru|\u0420\u0443\u0431\u043b\u044c \u0428\u043f\u0438\u0446\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0430}}\n* [[Tajikistani ruble]]\n* [[Transcaucasian ruble]]\n* Ukrainian coupon ([[Ukrainian karbovanets]])\n* [[Tuva]]n [[ak\u015fa]] and [[k\u0275pejek]]\n\n;Ruble of Imperial Russia\n* Silver ruble (1704\u20131897), [[Assignation ruble]] (1769\u20131849), [[Constantine ruble]] (collectible)\n* Gold ruble (1897\u20131917), Brut ruble (credit banknote)\n* Copper ruble and Sestroretsk ruble\n\n;Rubles of World War I and the Russian Civil War\n* [[German ostruble]] (1916\u20131918)\n* [[Kerenka]] (1917\u20131919)\n* Odessa ruble\n* Don ruble\n* Siberia ruble\n* Harbin ruble\n\n;Others\n* [[Lithuanian long currency|Lithuanian ruble / grivna]] (until 1579)\n\n{{Portal|Numismatics|Money}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|ruble|rouble}}\n* [http://monety-rossii.com \u041c\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0442\u044b \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420]\n* [http://www.historicalstatistics.org/Currencyconverter.html Historical Currency Converter] Historical value of the ruble in other currencies\n{{Ruble}}\n\n[[Category:Modern obsolete currencies]]\n[[Category:Denominations (currency)]]\n[[Category:Currencies of Russia]]\n[[Category:Numismatics]]\n", "name_user": "Astro Reeves", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruble"}

Aron was a player in the coffee and gold markets, and the former CEO of Goldman, [[Lloyd Blankfein]], joined the firm as a result of this merger. In 1985 it underwrote the public offering of the [[real estate investment trust]] that owned [[Rockefeller Center]], then the largest [[Real estate investment trust|REIT]] offering in history. In accordance with the beginning of the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the firm also became involved in facilitating the global privatization movement by advising companies that were spinning off from their parent governments.\n\nIn 1986, the firm formed Goldman Sachs Asset Management, which manages the majority of its mutual funds and [[hedge fund]]s today. In the same year, the firm also underwrote the IPO of [[Microsoft]], advised [[GE|General Electric]] on its acquisition of [[RCA]] and joined the [[London Stock Exchange|London]] and [[Tokyo stock exchange]]s. 1986 also was the year when Goldman became the first United States bank to rank in the top 10 of [[mergers and acquisitions]] in the United Kingdom. During the 1980s the firm became the first bank to distribute its investment research electronically and created the first public offering of original issue deep-discount [[bond (finance)|bond]].\n\n[[Robert Rubin]] and [[Stephen Friedman (PFIAB)|Stephen Friedman]] assumed the Co-Senior Partnership in 1990 and pledged to focus on globalization of the firm and strengthening the Merger & Acquisition and Trading business lines. During their reign, the firm introduced paperless trading to the New York Stock Exchange and lead-managed the first-ever global [[Corporate bond|debt offering]] by a U.S. corporation. It also launched the [[Goldman Sachs Commodity Index]] (GSCI) and opened a Beijing office in 1994.

Aron & Company, a [[commodities trading]] firm which merged with the Fixed Income division to become known as Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities. J. Aron was a player in the coffee and gold markets, and the former CEO of Goldman, [[Lloyd Blankfein]], joined the firm as a result of this merger. In 1985 it underwrote the public offering of the [[real estate investment trust]] that owned [[Rockefeller Center]], then the largest [[Real estate investment trust|REIT]] offering in history. In accordance with the beginning of the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the firm also became involved in facilitating the global privatization movement by advising companies that were spinning off from their parent governments.\n\nIn 1986, the firm formed Goldman Sachs Asset Management, which manages the majority of its mutual funds and [[hedge fund]]s today. In the same year, the firm also underwrote the IPO of [[Microsoft]], advised [[GE|General Electric]] on its acquisition of [[RCA]] and joined the [[London Stock Exchange|London]] and [[Tokyo stock exchange]]s. 1986 also was the year when Goldman became the first United States bank to rank in the top 10 of [[mergers and acquisitions]] in the United Kingdom. During the 1980s the firm became the first bank to distribute its investment research electronically and created the first public offering of original issue deep-discount [[bond (finance)|bond]].\n\n[[Robert Rubin]] and [[Stephen Friedman (PFIAB)|Stephen Friedman]] assumed the Co-Senior Partnership in 1990 and pledged to focus on globalization of the firm and strengthening the Merger & Acquisition and Trading business lines. During their reign, the firm introduced paperless trading to the New York Stock Exchange and lead-managed the first-ever global [[Corporate bond|debt offering]] by a U.S. corporation. It also launched the [[Goldman Sachs Commodity Index]] (GSCI) and opened a Beijing office in 1994.

[[Etymology|Etymologically]], the two words are unrelated. The term ''niggardly,'' arising in the [[Middle Ages]], long predates the term ''[[nigger]]'', which arose in the 16th century.<ref name=\"Pilgrim\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ferris.edu/news/jimcrow/caricature/|title=Nigger and Caricatures|last=Pilgrim|first=David|date=September 2001|accessdate=June 19, 2007}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Niggardly'' (noun: ''niggard'') is an adjective meaning \"stingy\" or \"miserly\". It is derived from the [[Middle English]] word ''{{lang|enm|nigard}}'', which is probably derived from [[Old Norse]] ''{{lang|non|hn\u01ebggr}}'' (\"stingy\").<ref>Erik Bj\u00f6rkman, ''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IZRMl0NXHZ8C&pg=PA34&lpg=PA34&dq=middle+english+word+nig&#v=onepage&q=middle%20english%20word%20nig&f=false Scandinavian Loan-words in Middle English]'', page 34.</ref>\n\n''Nigger'', a racial epithet in English, derives from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]]/[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word ''{{lang|es|negro}}'', meaning \"[[black]]\", and the [[French language|French]] word ''{{lang|fr|n\u00e8gre}}''. Both ''{{lang|es|negro}}'' and ''{{lang|fr|noir}}'' (and therefore also ''{{lang|fr|n\u00e8gre}}'' and ''nigger'') ultimately come from ''{{lang|la|nigrum}}'', the [[accusative case]] singular masculine and neuter <!-- Nouns in Western Romance languages typically come from the accusative case, rather than the nominative case that we quote in English. --> form of the [[Latin]] masculine adjective ''{{lang|la|niger}}'', meaning \"black\" or \"[[dark]]\".<ref>{{cite dictionary |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/nigger |title=''Nigger'' Usage Note |dictionary=[[Dictionary.com]] |accessdate=May 17, 2015 }}</ref> Its first recorded use dates to 1574, and its first recorded derogatory use to 1775.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Peterson|first1=Christopher|title=Bestial Traces: Race, Sexuality, Animality|date=2013|publisher=Fordham Univ Press|isbn=978-0-8232-4520-8|page=91|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=_Z54563cYpoC&pg=PA91#v=onepage|accessdate=August 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Patricia T.

It was commissioned by the British newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' in 1931 and conceived by [[Stanley Morison]], the artistic adviser to the British branch of the printing equipment company [[Monotype Imaging|Monotype]], in collaboration with [[Victor Lardent]], a lettering artist in ''The Times's'' advertising department. It has become one of the most popular typefaces of all time and is installed on most [[desktop computer]]s.\n\nAsked to advise on a redesign, Morison recommended that ''The Times'' change their text typeface from a spindly nineteenth-century face to a more robust, solid design, returning to traditions of printing from the eighteenth century and before. This matched a common trend in printing tastes of the period. Morison proposed an older Monotype typeface named [[Plantin (typeface)|Plantin]] as a basis for the design, and Times New Roman mostly matches Plantin's dimensions. The main change was that the contrast between strokes was enhanced to give a crisper image. The new design made its debut in ''The Times'' on 3 October 1932. After one year, the design was released for commercial sale. In Times New Roman's name, Roman is a reference to the regular or [[Roman type|roman]] style (sometimes also called [[Antiqua\u2013Fraktur dispute|Antiqua]]), the first part of the Times New Roman family to be designed. Roman type has roots in Italian printing of the late 15th and early 16th centuries, but Times New Roman's design has no connection to [[Rome]] or to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].\n\n''The Times'' stayed with Times New Roman for 40 years, but new production techniques and the format change from [[broadsheet]] to [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] in 2004 have caused it to switch typeface five times from 1972 to 2007.

The major changes to the Times Roman typeface itself were a reduction in the slope of italic characters to 12 degrees from 16 degrees, so as to reduce the need for kerning, and a change in the form of italic v and w so that italic v could be more easily distinguished from a Greek nu.<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n\nThe 4-line system involved casting characters for 10-point Times Roman on 6-point [[Body (typography)|bodies]]. The top of the character would overhang the slug, forming a [[kern (typography)|kern]] which was less fragile than the normal kerns of foundry type, as it was on a slab of cast metal. This technique had been in previous use on Monotype machines, usually involving double-height matrices, to allow the automatic setting of \"advertising figures\" (numbers that occupy two or more lines, usually to clearly indicate a price in an advertisement set in small type). This meant that the same matrix could be used for both superscript and subscript numbers. More importantly, it allowed a variable or other item to have both a superscript and a subscript at the same time, one above the other, without inordinate difficulty.<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n\nPreviously, while the Monotype system, due to its flexibility, was widely used for setting mathematical formulas, the typeface Modern Series 7 was usually used for this purpose.<ref>T. W. Chaundy, P. R. Barett, Charles Batey, ''The Printing of Mathematics'', Oxford University Press (1954, 1957)</ref> Because of the popularity of Times Roman at the time, Monotype chose to design a variant of Times Roman suited to mathematical composition, and recut many additional characters needed for mathematics, including special symbols as well as Greek and Fraktur alphabets, to accompany the system instead of designing it around the typeface that was being used, for which characters were already available. Matrices for some 700 characters were available as part of Times Roman Series 569 when it was released in 1958, with new characters constantly being added for over a decade afterwards (thus, in 1971, 8,000 characters were included, and new ones were being added at a rate of about 5 per week).<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n{{clear}}\n\n==Usage==\n[[File:Colliers Times New Roman letter perfect.jpg|thumb|right|A 1943 brochure used by Crowell-Collier, one of the first major American users of Times New Roman, to promote the changeover.<ref name=\"Happiness is Times New Roman\" />]]\nTimes New Roman's popularity rapidly expanded beyond its original niche, becoming popular in book printing and general publishing.

Users found that in the hot metal period it was common for the molten metal to rapidly eat through the matrices as type was being cast, and so it did not become popular among other newspapers: \"Times Roman achieved its popularity chiefly in general printing, not in newspaper work.\"{{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=204}} He described it as particularly used in \"book work, especially non-fiction\" such as the ''[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]]''.{{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=204}} Hutt also commented that Times New Roman's relative condensation was less useful than might be expected for newspaper printing, since in a normal newspaper column frequent paragraph breaks tend to provide area that can absorb the space of wider letters without increasing the number of lines used\u2013but ''The Times'', whose [[Style guide|house style]] in the 1930s was to minimise the number of paragraph breaks, was an exception to this.{{sfn|Hutt|1970|p=264}}\n\nTimes New Roman remains popular in publishing, helped by the extremely large range of characters available for international and mathematics printing.{{sfn|Williamson|1956|p=102}}<ref name=\"Es gilt das gesprochene Wort\">{{cite web |last1=Bergmann |first1=Christopher |title=Es gilt das gesprochene Wort: Schriftarten f\u00fcr IPA-Transkriptionen |url=https://www.isoglosse.de/2014/03/schriftarten-ipa-transkriptionen/ |website=Isoglosse |accessdate=14 November 2018}}</ref> For example, the [[American Psychological Association]] suggests using Times New Roman in papers written in its [[APA style]].<ref name=\"APA Style Blog\">{{cite web |last1=Lee |first1=Chelsea |title=Fonts of Knowledge |url=https://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2013/03/fonts-of-knowledge.html |website=APA Style Blog |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |accessdate=14 November 2018}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n==Linotype releases==\n[[File:Many accented a (8277806822).jpg|thumb|Working drawings for a Linotype release of \"Times Roman\".

Linotype referred to the design as ''Times'' or ''Times Roman''. Monotype and Linotype have since merged, but slight differences have split the lineage of Times into two subtly different designs.\n\nAlthough Times New Roman and Times are very similar, various differences developed between the versions marketed by Linotype and Monotype when the master fonts were transferred from metal to [[cold type|photo]] and digital media. For example, Linotype has slanted [[serif]]s on the capital S, while Monotype's are vertical, and Linotype has an extra serif on the number 5.<ref name=\"Strizver TypeTalk\">{{cite web|first=Ilene|last=Strizver|url=http://www.creativepro.com/blog/typetalk-times-roman-vs-times-new-roman|title=TypeTalk: Times Roman vs Times New Roman|work=CreativePro.com}}</ref> Most of these differences are invisible in body text at normal reading distances, or 10pts at 300 dpi. Subtle competition grew between the two foundries, as the proportions and details as well as the width metrics for their version of Times grew apart.<ref name=\"times-development\" /> Differences between the two versions do occur in the lowercase z in the italic weight, (Times Linotype has a curl also followed in the STIX revival, Times New Roman is straight){{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=204}} and in the percent sign in all weights. (Linotype and STIX have a stroke connecting up the left-hand zero with a slash, Times New Roman does not.) Monotype's 'J' is non-descending, but Linotype's in the bold weight descends below the baseline.\n\nLinotype licensed its version to [[Xerox]] and then [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], guaranteeing its importance in digital printing by making it one of the core fonts of the [[PostScript]] page description language.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shaw|first1=Paul|title=Some history about Arial|url=http://www.paulshawletterdesign.com/2011/09/blue-pencil-no-18%E2%80%94some-history-about-arial/|website=Paul Shaw Letter Design|accessdate=22 May 2015}}</ref> Microsoft's version of Times New Roman is licensed from Monotype, hence the original name.

It was commissioned by the British newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' in 1931 and conceived by [[Stanley Morison]], the artistic adviser to the British branch of the printing equipment company [[Monotype Imaging|Monotype]], in collaboration with [[Victor Lardent]], a lettering artist in ''The Times's'' advertising department. It has become one of the most popular typefaces of all time and is installed on most [[desktop computer]]s.\n\nAsked to advise on a redesign, Morison recommended that ''The Times'' change their text typeface from a spindly nineteenth-century face to a more robust, solid design, returning to traditions of printing from the eighteenth century and before. This matched a common trend in printing tastes of the period. Morison proposed an older Monotype typeface named [[Plantin (typeface)|Plantin]] as a basis for the design, and Times New Roman mostly matches Plantin's dimensions. The main change was that the contrast between strokes was enhanced to give a crisper image. The new design made its debut in ''The Times'' on 3 October 1932. After one year, the design was released for commercial sale. In Times New Roman's name, Roman is a reference to the regular or [[Roman type|roman]] style (sometimes also called [[Antiqua\u2013Fraktur dispute|Antiqua]]), the first part of the Times New Roman family to be designed. Roman type has roots in Italian printing of the late 15th and early 16th centuries, but Times New Roman's design has no connection to [[Rome]] or to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].\n\n''The Times'' stayed with Times New Roman for 40 years, but new production techniques and the format change from [[broadsheet]] to [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] in 2004 have caused it to switch typeface five times from 1972 to 2007. However, all the new fonts have been variants of the original New Roman typeface.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Times New Roman and predecessor.jpg|thumb|right|Twenty-two lines in Times New Roman compared to its predecessor \"modern\" serif font.{{efn|\"Modern\" in typography is a generic term referring to designs in the [[Didone (typography)|modern or Didone]] style of the nineteenth century.}} Times appears larger on the page, with tighter linespacing and more solid in appearance.<ref name=\"Printing the Times 1932\">{{cite book |title=Printing the Times: A record of the changes introduced in the issue for October 3, 1932 |date=1932 |location=London}}</ref>]]\nTimes New Roman has a robust [[Type color|colour]] on the page and influences of European [[Early modern period|early modern]] and [[Baroque period|Baroque]] printing.<ref name=\"Monotype Recorder: The Changing Newspaper\">{{cite journal|first=Stanley|last=Morison|title=Monotype Recorder: The Changing Newspaper|journal=Monotype Recorder|volume=35|issue=1|date=1936|url=http://www.metaltype.co.uk/downloads/mr/mr_35_1.pdf}}</ref>{{efn|\"The Changing Newspaper\" articles in the ''Monotype Recorder'' are unsigned, but Monotype's newspaper consultant Allen Hutt, who co-authored the issue, attributes them to Morison.{{sfn|Hutt|1970|p=263}}}} As a typeface designed for newspaper printing, Times New Roman has a high [[x-height]], short [[descender]]s to allow tight linespacing and a relatively condensed appearance.{{sfn|Williamson|1956|p=117}}{{efn|While Times is often described as being quite \"condensed\" this is relative to its high x-height: typefaces with lower x-height, such as many versions of [[Garamond]], [[Caslon]] and [[Bembo]], are narrower at equalised cap height.

The major changes to the Times Roman typeface itself were a reduction in the slope of italic characters to 12 degrees from 16 degrees, so as to reduce the need for kerning, and a change in the form of italic v and w so that italic v could be more easily distinguished from a Greek nu.<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n\nThe 4-line system involved casting characters for 10-point Times Roman on 6-point [[Body (typography)|bodies]]. The top of the character would overhang the slug, forming a [[kern (typography)|kern]] which was less fragile than the normal kerns of foundry type, as it was on a slab of cast metal. This technique had been in previous use on Monotype machines, usually involving double-height matrices, to allow the automatic setting of \"advertising figures\" (numbers that occupy two or more lines, usually to clearly indicate a price in an advertisement set in small type). This meant that the same matrix could be used for both superscript and subscript numbers. More importantly, it allowed a variable or other item to have both a superscript and a subscript at the same time, one above the other, without inordinate difficulty.<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n\nPreviously, while the Monotype system, due to its flexibility, was widely used for setting mathematical formulas, the typeface Modern Series 7 was usually used for this purpose.<ref>T. W. Chaundy, P. R. Barett, Charles Batey, ''The Printing of Mathematics'', Oxford University Press (1954, 1957)</ref> Because of the popularity of Times Roman at the time, Monotype chose to design a variant of Times Roman suited to mathematical composition, and recut many additional characters needed for mathematics, including special symbols as well as Greek and Fraktur alphabets, to accompany the system instead of designing it around the typeface that was being used, for which characters were already available. Matrices for some 700 characters were available as part of Times Roman Series 569 when it was released in 1958, with new characters constantly being added for over a decade afterwards (thus, in 1971, 8,000 characters were included, and new ones were being added at a rate of about 5 per week).<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n{{clear}}\n\n==Usage==\n[[File:Colliers Times New Roman letter perfect.jpg|thumb|right|A 1943 brochure used by Crowell-Collier, one of the first major American users of Times New Roman, to promote the changeover.<ref name=\"Happiness is Times New Roman\" />]]\nTimes New Roman's popularity rapidly expanded beyond its original niche, becoming popular in book printing and general publishing.

For example, Linotype has slanted [[serif]]s on the capital S, while Monotype's are vertical, and Linotype has an extra serif on the number 5.<ref name=\"Strizver TypeTalk\">{{cite web|first=Ilene|last=Strizver|url=http://www.creativepro.com/blog/typetalk-times-roman-vs-times-new-roman|title=TypeTalk: Times Roman vs Times New Roman|work=CreativePro.com}}</ref> Most of these differences are invisible in body text at normal reading distances, or 10pts at 300 dpi. Subtle competition grew between the two foundries, as the proportions and details as well as the width metrics for their version of Times grew apart.<ref name=\"times-development\" /> Differences between the two versions do occur in the lowercase z in the italic weight, (Times Linotype has a curl also followed in the STIX revival, Times New Roman is straight){{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=204}} and in the percent sign in all weights. (Linotype and STIX have a stroke connecting up the left-hand zero with a slash, Times New Roman does not.) Monotype's 'J' is non-descending, but Linotype's in the bold weight descends below the baseline.\n\nLinotype licensed its version to [[Xerox]] and then [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], guaranteeing its importance in digital printing by making it one of the core fonts of the [[PostScript]] page description language.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shaw|first1=Paul|title=Some history about Arial|url=http://www.paulshawletterdesign.com/2011/09/blue-pencil-no-18%E2%80%94some-history-about-arial/|website=Paul Shaw Letter Design|accessdate=22 May 2015}}</ref> Microsoft's version of Times New Roman is licensed from Monotype, hence the original name.

In the 1980s, there was an attempt by a group of entrepreneurs to seek from [[Rupert Murdoch]], who owned ''The Times'', the right to use the Times Roman name; separately, a legal action was also initiated to clarify the right of Monotype to use the name in the US despite Linotype's registration. As a result of legal action, Linotype and its licensees continued to use the name Times Roman, while Monotype and its licensees used the name Times New Roman.<ref name=\"times-development\">{{cite web |url= http://www.truetype-typography.com/articles/times.htm |title=Times (New) Roman and its part in the Development of Scalable Font Technology |author=Charles Bigelow |year=1994 |accessdate=4 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Modern releases==\n\n===As Times New Roman===\nMonotype sells a wider range of styles and [[Font#Optical size|optical sizes]] for Times New Roman than are offered with Windows, in order to meet the needs of newspapers and books which print at a range of text sizes.<ref name=\"Changing the Times\" /> Its current release includes Regular, Medium, Semi Bold and Bold weights with matching italics, Extra Bold, Condensed (in regular, italic and bold), Seven (for smaller text, in regular, italic, bold and bold italic) and Small Text (for very small text, in regular, italic and bold).<ref>{{cite web|title=Monotype Library: Times New Roman|url=http://www.linotype.com/1540/TimesNewRoman-family.html|publisher=Monotype|accessdate=14 July 2015}}</ref> The four-weight version included with Windows was also distributed as part of Microsoft's [[Core Fonts for the Web]] package.<ref name=\"apple-techspot\">{{cite web | url=http://www.techspot.com/news/26438-microsoft-and-apple-extend-font-licensing-agreement.html |title=Microsoft and Apple extend font licensing agreement |author=Jose Vilches |date=2007-08-03 |accessdate=2011-06-25}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2017, the version of Times New Roman included with [[Windows 10]], version 6.96, includes [[small capitals]], [[text figures]], and italic [[swash capitals]].<ref name=\"TNR 6.96\">{{cite AV media | people = | date =\n | title = Times New Roman, v. 6.96 | medium = Font digitisation }}</ref><ref name=\"FIU New Roman Times Swash capital comment\">{{cite web |last1=Thiago |last2=Hardwig |first2=Florian |title=New Roman Times \u2013 Camper Van Beethoven |url=https://fontsinuse.com/uses/25135/new-roman-times-camper-van-beethoven#comment-631475 |website=Fonts in Use |accessdate=2 April 2019}}</ref> The Microsoft/Monotype digitisation of Times New Roman omits automatic [[typographic ligature|ligature]] insertion (although as of v. 6.96 it is selectable),<ref name=\"TNR 6.96\" /> which the version of Times installed with macOS has.

In a [[Pisco Sour]] a few drops are sprinkled on top of the foam, both for aroma and decoration. In a [[Champagne Cocktail]] a few drops of bitters are added to a sugar cube.\n\nIn Hong Kong, Angostura bitters are included in the local [[Gunner (cocktail)|Gunner]] cocktail. Though not in the classic recipe, bartenders sometimes add more flavour to the [[Mojito]] cocktail by sprinkling a few drops of Angostura bitters on top. Bitters can also be used in \"soft\" drinks; a common drink served in Australian and New Zealand pubs is [[lemon, lime and bitters]]. In [[Malawi]], bitters are added to a mix of crushed ice, [[ginger ale]] and [[Sprite (drink)|Sprite]] to make a 'rock shandy'.\n\n''Angostura Bitters Drink Guide'', a promotional booklet of 1908, was reprinted in 2008 with a new introduction by Ross Bolton.\n\nAmong certain bartending communities (especially in Malaysia) shots of Angostura are taken as the 'bartender's handshake' either during or after the shift is done.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://talesofthecocktail.com/culture/praise-bartenders-handshake|title=In Praise of the Bartender's Handshake|date=2017-02-01|work=Tales of the Cocktail|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe largest purveyor of Angostura bitters in the world is Nelsen's Hall Bitters Pub on [[Washington Island (Wisconsin)|Washington Island]] off the northeast tip of [[Door Peninsula]] in [[Door County, Wisconsin|Door County]], [[Wisconsin]].

Originally used to help with upset stomachs of the soldiers in Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar's army, it later became popular in soda water and was usually served with [[gin]]. The mix stuck in the form of a [[pink gin]], and is also used in many other alcoholic [[cocktails]] such as [[long vodka]], consisting of [[vodka]], bitters, and [[lemonade]]. In the United States, it is best known for its use in whiskey cocktails: [[Old fashioned (cocktail)|Old Fashioned]], made with [[whiskey]], bitters, sugar, and water,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drinksmixer.com/drink407.html|title=Old Fashioned recipe|author=|date=|website=www.drinksmixer.com|accessdate=20 April 2018}}</ref> and [[Manhattan (cocktail)|Manhattan]], made usually with [[rye whiskey]] and red [[vermouth]]. In a [[Pisco Sour]] a few drops are sprinkled on top of the foam, both for aroma and decoration. In a [[Champagne Cocktail]] a few drops of bitters are added to a sugar cube.\n\nIn Hong Kong, Angostura bitters are included in the local [[Gunner (cocktail)|Gunner]] cocktail. Though not in the classic recipe, bartenders sometimes add more flavour to the [[Mojito]] cocktail by sprinkling a few drops of Angostura bitters on top. Bitters can also be used in \"soft\" drinks; a common drink served in Australian and New Zealand pubs is [[lemon, lime and bitters]]. In [[Malawi]], bitters are added to a mix of crushed ice, [[ginger ale]] and [[Sprite (drink)|Sprite]] to make a 'rock shandy'.\n\n''Angostura Bitters Drink Guide'', a promotional booklet of 1908, was reprinted in 2008 with a new introduction by Ross Bolton.\n\nAmong certain bartending communities (especially in Malaysia) shots of Angostura are taken as the 'bartender's handshake' either during or after the shift is done.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://talesofthecocktail.com/culture/praise-bartenders-handshake|title=In Praise of the Bartender's Handshake|date=2017-02-01|work=Tales of the Cocktail|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe largest purveyor of Angostura bitters in the world is Nelsen's Hall Bitters Pub on [[Washington Island (Wisconsin)|Washington Island]] off the northeast tip of [[Door Peninsula]] in [[Door County, Wisconsin|Door County]], [[Wisconsin]].

In his home country the United Kingdom it reached number five on the [[UK Singles Chart]], and also charted in the top 10 in more than twenty nations around the world.

In an interview in 1992, Clapton said of the song, \"It was in the back of my head but it didn\u2019t really have a reason for being until I was scoring this movie ... then it sort of had a reason to be.

He told me that he had admired the work I did with [[Steve Winwood]] and finally there was nothing else but to do as he requested, despite the sensitivity of the subject.

In an interview in 1992, Clapton said of the song, \"It was in the back of my head but it didn\u2019t really have a reason for being until I was scoring this movie ... then it sort of had a reason to be.

He told me that he had admired the work I did with [[Steve Winwood]] and finally there was nothing else but to do as he requested, despite the sensitivity of the subject.

Clapton stopped performing \"Tears in Heaven\" in 2004, as well as the song \"[[My Father's Eyes (song)|My Father's Eyes]]\", stating: \"I didn't feel the loss any more, which is so much a part of performing those songs. I really have to connect with the feelings that were there when I wrote them. They're kind of gone and I really don't want them to come back, particularly. My life is different now. They probably just need a rest and maybe I'll introduce them for a much more detached point of view.\"<!-- <ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://music.uk.msn.com/photos/photos.aspx?cp-documentid=154814955&page=2 |title=2.

Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen presented a scenario that, in their view, indicated that quantum particles, like [[electron]]s and [[photon]]s, must carry physical properties or attributes not included in quantum theory, and the uncertainties in quantum theory's predictions are due to ignorance of these properties, later termed \"hidden variables\". Their scenario involves a pair of widely separated physical objects, prepared in such a way that the [[quantum state]] of the pair is [[quantum entanglement|entangled]].\n\nBell carried the analysis of quantum entanglement much further. He deduced that if measurements are performed independently on the two separated halves of a pair, then the assumption that the outcomes depend upon hidden variables within each half implies a constraint on how the outcomes on the two halves are correlated. This constraint would later be named the Bell inequality. Bell then showed that quantum physics predicts correlations that violate this inequality. Consequently, the only way that hidden variables could explain the predictions of quantum physics is if they are \"nonlocal\", somehow associated with both halves of the pair and able to carry influences instantly between them no matter how widely the two halves are separated.<ref name=\"C.B.

These have been [[Bell test experiments|tested experimentally]] in physics laboratories many times since 1972. Often, these experiments have had the goal of ameliorating problems of experimental design or set-up that could in principle affect the validity of the findings of earlier Bell tests. This is known as \"closing [[loopholes in Bell test experiments]]\". To date, Bell tests have found that the hypothesis of local hidden variables is inconsistent with the way that physical systems do, in fact, behave.<ref name=\"NAT-20180509\">{{cite journal |author=The BIG Bell Test Collaboration |title=Challenging local realism with human choices |date=9 May 2018 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=557 |issue=7704 |pages=212\u2013216 |doi=10.1038/s41586-018-0085-3 |pmid=29743691 |bibcode=2018Natur.557..212B |arxiv=1805.04431 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/20170207-bell-test-quantum-loophole/|title=Experiment Reaffirms Quantum Weirdness|last=Wolchover|first=Natalie|authorlink=Natalie Wolchover|date=2017-02-07|work=[[Quanta Magazine]]|language=en-US|accessdate=2020-02-08}}</ref>\n\nThe exact nature of the assumptions required to prove a Bell-type constraint on correlations have been debated by physicists and by [[philosophy of physics|philosophers]]. While the significance of Bell's theorem is not in doubt, its full implications for the [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]] remain unresolved.\n\n== Historical background ==\nIn the early 1930s, the philosophical implications of the current interpretations of quantum theory troubled many prominent physicists of the day, including [[Albert Einstein]].  In a well-known 1935 paper, [[Boris Podolsky]] and co-authors Einstein and [[Nathan Rosen]] (collectively \"EPR\") sought to demonstrate by the [[EPR paradox]] that quantum mechanics was incomplete.  This provided hope that a more complete (and less troubling) theory might one day be discovered.  But that conclusion rested on the seemingly reasonable assumptions of ''locality'' and ''realism'' (together called \"local realism\" or \"[[local hidden variables]]\", often interchangeably). In the vernacular of Einstein: [[Principle of locality|locality]] meant no instantaneous [[quantum entanglement|(\"spooky\") action at a distance]]; realism meant the moon is there even when not being observed. These assumptions were hotly debated in the physics community, notably [[Bohr\u2013Einstein debates|between Einstein and Niels Bohr]].\n\nIn his groundbreaking 1964 paper, \"On the Einstein Podolsky Rosen paradox\",<ref name=Bell1964/><ref>Reprinted in {{cite book |title=Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics: Collected Papers on Quantum Philosophy  |author=JS Bell |chapter=Chapter 2:On the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mwAhAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT8 |isbn=978-0521523387  |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |edition=Alain Aspect introduction to 1987 |pages=14\u201321}}</ref> physicist [[John Stewart Bell]] presented an analogy (based on spin measurements on pairs of entangled electrons) to EPR's hypothetical paradox.  Using their reasoning, he said, a choice of measurement setting here should not affect the outcome of measurement there (and vice versa).  After providing a mathematical formulation of locality and realism based on this, he showed specific cases where this would be inconsistent with the predictions of quantum mechanics theory.\n\nNon-local hidden variable theories are inconsistent with the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics. In the latter, the measurement instrument is differentiated from the quantum effects being observed. This has been called the \"[[measurement problem]]\" and the \"[[Observer effect (physics)|observer effect]].\"\n\nIn experimental tests following Bell's example, now using [[quantum entanglement]] of photons instead of electrons, [[John Clauser]] and [[Stuart Freedman]] (1972) and [[Alain Aspect]] ''et al''. (1981) demonstrated that the predictions of quantum mechanics are correct in this regard, although relying on additional unverifiable assumptions that open [[Loopholes in Bell test experiments|loopholes]] for local realism.\n\nIn October 2015, Hensen and colleagues<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |doi = 10.1038/nature15759 | volume=526 | issue=7575 | title=Loophole-free Bell inequality violation using electron spins separated by 1.3 kilometres | journal=Nature | pages=682\u2013686|bibcode = 2015Natur.526..682H |arxiv=1508.05949 | pmid=26503041 | last1 = Hensen | first1 = B | last2 = Bernien | first2 = H | last3 = Dr\u00e9au | first3 = AE | last4 = Reiserer | first4 = A | last5 = Kalb | first5 = N | last6 = Blok | first6 = MS | last7 = Ruitenberg | first7 = J | last8 = Vermeulen | first8 = RF | last9 = Schouten | first9 = RN | last10 = Abell\u00e1n | first10 = C | last11 = Amaya | first11 = W | last12 = Pruneri | first12 = V | last13 = Mitchell | first13 = MW | last14 = Markham | first14 = M | last15 = Twitchen | first15 = DJ | last16 = Elkouss | first16 = D | last17 = Wehner | first17 = S | last18 = Taminiau | first18 = TH | last19 = Hanson | first19 = R| year=2015 }}</ref> reported that they performed a loophole-free Bell test which might force one to reject at least one of the principles of locality, realism, or [[Loopholes in Bell test experiments#Free choice of detector orientations|freedom-of-choice]] (the last \"could\" lead to alternative [[Superdeterminism|superdeterministic]] theories).<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Zeeya Merali |title=Quantum 'spookiness' passes toughest test yet |journal=Nature |volume= 525 |issue=7567 |pages=14\u201315 |date=2015-08-27|doi=10.1038/nature.2015.18255 |pmid=26333448 |bibcode=2015Natur.525...14M |doi-access=free }}</ref> Two of these logical possibilities, non-locality and non-realism, correspond to well-developed interpretations of quantum mechanics, and have many supporters; this is not the case for the third logical possibility, non-freedom. Conclusive experimental evidence of the violation of Bell's inequality would drastically reduce the class of acceptable deterministic theories but would not falsify absolute determinism, which was described by Bell himself as \"not just inanimate nature running on behind-the-scenes clockwork, but with our behaviour, including our belief that we are free to choose to do one experiment rather than another, absolutely predetermined\". However, Bell himself considered absolute determinism an implausible solution.\n\n== Overview ==\n{{Specific|section|date=June 2019}}\nThe theorem is usually proved by consideration of a quantum system of two [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] [[qubit]]s with the original tests as stated above done on photons. The most common examples concern systems of particles that are entangled in [[spin (physics)|spin]] or [[polarization (waves)|polarization]]. Quantum mechanics allows predictions of correlations that would be observed if these two particles have their spin or polarization measured in different directions. Bell showed that if a local hidden variable theory holds, then these correlations would have to satisfy certain constraints, called Bell inequalities.\n\n[[File:Mermin's inequality.pdf|thumb|400px|With two-state particles and observables A, B and C (as on the picture) one gets the violation of Bell-type inequality. According to quantum mechanics, the sum of probabilities to get equal results measuring different observables is 3/4. But assuming predetermined results (equal for the same observables), this sum must be at least 1 since in each pair at least two out of three observables are then predetermined to be equal.]]\n\nFollowing the argument in the [[EPR paradox|Einstein\u2013Podolsky\u2013Rosen (EPR) paradox]] paper (but using the example of spin, as in [[David Bohm]]'s version of the EPR argument<ref>{{cite book|last=Bohm|first=David|title=Quantum Theory|authorlink=David Bohm|publisher=Prentice\u2212Hall|year=1951}}</ref>), Bell considered a [[thought experiment]] in which there are \"a pair of spin one-half particles formed somehow in the [[Singlet state|singlet spin state]] and moving freely in opposite directions.\"<ref name=Bell1964/> The two particles travel away from each other to two distant locations, at which measurements of spin are performed, along axes that are independently chosen. Each measurement yields a result of either spin-up&nbsp;(+) or spin-down&nbsp;(\u2212); it means, spin in the positive or negative direction of the chosen axis.\n\nThe probability of the same result being obtained at the two locations depends on the relative angles at which the two spin measurements are made, and is strictly between zero and one for all relative angles other than perfectly parallel or antiparallel alignments (0\u00b0 or 180\u00b0). Since total angular momentum is conserved, and since the total spin is zero in the singlet state, the probability of the same result with parallel (antiparallel) alignment is 0 (1). This last prediction is true classically as well as quantum mechanically.\n\nBell's theorem is concerned with correlations defined in terms of averages taken over very many trials of the experiment. The [[Quantum correlation|correlation]] of two binary variables is usually defined in quantum physics as the average of the products of the pairs of measurements. Note that this is different from the usual definition of [[correlation]] in statistics. The quantum physicist's \"correlation\" is the statistician's \"raw (uncentered, unnormalized) product [[Moment (mathematics)|moment]]\". They are similar in that, with either definition, if the pairs of outcomes are always the same, the correlation is +1; if the pairs of outcomes are always opposite, the correlation is \u22121; and if the pairs of outcomes agree 50% of the time, then the correlation is 0. The correlation is related in a simple way to the probability of equal outcomes, namely it is equal to twice the probability of equal outcomes, minus one.\n\n[[Pauli operator|Measuring the spin]] of these entangled particles along anti-parallel directions (i.e., facing in precisely opposite directions, perhaps offset by some arbitrary distance) the set of all results is perfectly correlated. On the other hand, if measurements are performed along parallel directions (i.e., facing in precisely the same direction, perhaps offset by some arbitrary distance) they always yield opposite results, and the set of measurements shows perfect anti-correlation. This is in accord with the above stated probabilities of measuring the same result in these two cases. Finally, measurement at perpendicular directions has a 50% chance of matching, and the total set of measurements is uncorrelated. These basic cases are illustrated in the table below.

In his paper, Bell started from the same two assumptions as did EPR, namely (i) ''reality'' (that microscopic objects have real properties determining the outcomes of quantum mechanical measurements), and (ii) ''locality'' (that reality in one location is not influenced by measurements performed simultaneously at a distant location). Bell was able to derive from those two assumptions an important result, namely Bell's inequality. The theoretical (and later experimental) violation of this inequality implies that at least one of the two assumptions must be false.\n\nIn two respects Bell's 1964 paper was a step forward compared to the EPR paper: firstly, it considered more [[Hidden variable theory|hidden variables]] than merely the [[EPR paradox|element of physical reality]] in the EPR paper; and Bell's inequality was, in part, experimentally testable, thus raising the possibility of testing the local realism hypothesis. Limitations on such tests to date are noted below.  Whereas Bell's paper deals only with deterministic hidden variable theories, Bell's theorem was later generalized to [[stochastic]] theories<ref name=\"Clauser\u2013Horne\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.10.526|title=Experimental consequences of objective local theories|year=1974|last1=Clauser|first1=John F.|journal=Physical Review D|volume=10|issue=2|pages=526\u2013535|bibcode=1974PhRvD..10..526C|url=http://www.philoscience.unibe.ch/documents/physics/Clauser1974/Clauser1974.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225072037/http://www.philoscience.unibe.ch/documents/physics/Clauser1974/Clauser1974.pdf|archivedate=2013-12-25}}</ref> as well, and it was also realised<ref>{{cite journal |last= Eberhard |first=P.

Existence of these variables is called the assumption of realism, or the assumption of [[counterfactual definiteness]].\n\nAfter the EPR paper, quantum mechanics was in an unsatisfactory position: either it was incomplete, in the sense that it failed to account for some elements of physical reality, or it violated the principle of a finite propagation speed of physical effects. In a modified version of the EPR thought experiment, two hypothetical [[Observer (quantum physics)|observers]], now commonly referred to as [[Alice and Bob|''Alice'' and ''Bob'']], perform independent measurements of spin on a pair of electrons, prepared at a source in a special state called a ''[[spin singlet]] state''. It is the conclusion of EPR that once Alice measures spin in one direction (e.g. on the ''x'' axis), Bob's measurement in that direction is determined with certainty, as being the opposite outcome to that of Alice, whereas immediately before Alice's measurement Bob's outcome was only statistically determined (i.e., was only a probability, not a certainty); thus, either the spin in each direction is an ''element of physical reality'', or the effects travel from Alice to Bob instantly.\n\nIn QM, predictions are formulated in terms of [[probability|probabilities]] \u2014 for example, the probability that an [[electron]] will be detected in a particular place, or the probability that its spin is up or down. The idea persisted, however, that the electron in fact has a ''definite'' position and spin, and that QM's weakness is its inability to predict those values precisely. The possibility existed that some unknown theory, such as a ''hidden variables theory'', might be able to predict those quantities exactly, while at the same time also being in complete agreement with the probabilities predicted by QM. If such a hidden variables theory exists, then because the hidden variables are not described by QM the latter would be an incomplete theory.\n\n==Local realism==\nThe concept of local realism is formalized to state, and prove, Bell's theorem and generalizations.  A common approach is the following:\n# There is a [[probability space]] {{math|\u039b}} and the observed outcomes by both Alice and Bob result by random sampling of the (unknown, \"hidden\") parameter {{math|''\u03bb'' \u2208 \u039b}}.\n# The values observed by Alice or Bob are functions of the local detector settings, the state of the incoming event (spin for material or phase for photon) and the hidden parameter only. Thus, there are functions {{math|''A'',''B'' : ''S''<sup>2</sup> \u00d7 \u039b \u2192 {-1, +1} }}, where a detector setting is modeled as a location on the unit sphere {{math|''S''<sup>2</sup>}}, such that\n#*The value observed by Alice with detector setting {{mvar|a}} is {{math|''A''(''a'', ''\u03bb'')}}\n#*The value observed by Bob with detector setting {{mvar|b}} is {{math|''B''(''b'', ''\u03bb'')}}\n\nPerfect anti-correlation would require {{math|''B''(''c'', ''\u03bb'') {{=}} \u2212''A''(''c'', ''\u03bb''), ''c'' \u2208 ''S''<sup>2</sup>}}. Implicit in assumption 1) above, the hidden parameter space {{math|\u039b}} has a [[probability measure]] {{mvar|\u03bc}} and the [[expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation]] of a random variable {{mvar|X}} on {{math|\u039b}} with respect to {{mvar|\u03bc}} is written\n\n:<math> \\operatorname{E}(X) = \\int_\\Lambda X(\\lambda) p(\\lambda) \\, d \\lambda, </math>\n\nwhere for accessibility of notation we assume that the probability measure has a [[probability density]] {{mvar|p}} that therefore is nonnegative and integrates to {{math|1}}. The hidden parameter is often thought of as being associated with the source but it can just as well also contain components associated with the two measurement devices.\n\n== Bell inequalities ==\nBell inequalities concern measurements made by observers on pairs of particles that have interacted and then separated. Assuming local realism, certain constraints must hold on the relationships between the correlations between subsequent measurements of the particles under various possible measurement settings. Let {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} be as above. Define for the present purposes three correlation functions:\n*Let {{math|''C''<sub>''e''</sub>(''a'', ''b'')}} denote the experimentally measured correlation defined by\n*:<math>C_e(a, b) = \\frac{N_{++} + N_{--} - N_{+-} - N_{-+}}{N_{++} + N_{--} + N_{+-} + N_{-+}},</math>\n:where {{math|''N''<sub>++</sub>}} is the number of measurements yielding \"spin up\" in the direction of {{math|'''a'''}} measured by Alice (first subscript {{math|+}}) ''and'' \"spin up\" in the direction of {{math|'''b'''}} measured by Bob. The other occurrences of {{mvar|N}} are analogously defined. In other words, this expression denotes the number of times Alice and Bob found the same spin, minus the number of times they found an opposite spin, divided by the total number of measurements, for a given pair of angles.\n*Let {{math|''C''<sub>''q''</sub>(''a'', ''b'')}} denote the correlation as predicted by quantum mechanics. This is given by the expression\n*:<math>C_q(a, b) = \\left\\langle A \\left|(\\boldsymbol\\sigma \\cdot \\mathbf b)^{(2)}(\\boldsymbol\\sigma \\cdot \\mathbf a)^{(1)}\\right| A \\right\\rangle,</math>\n:where {{mvar|A}} is the antisymmetric spin wave function. This value is calculated to be\n::<math>C_q(a, b) = -\\mathbf a \\cdot \\mathbf b.</math>\n*Let {{math|''C''<sub>''h''</sub>(''a'', ''b'')}} denote the correlation as predicted by any hidden variable theory. In the formalization of above, this is\n*:<math>C_h(a, b) = E(A(\\mathbf{a}, \\lambda) B(\\mathbf{b}, \\lambda)) = \\int_\\Lambda A(\\mathbf{a}, \\lambda)B(\\mathbf{b}, \\lambda) p(\\lambda) \\, d\\lambda.</math>\n\n{{Hidden begin\n | title style=color:green; background:lightgrey;\n | title=Details on calculation of {{math|''C''<sub>''q''</sub>('''a''', '''b''')}}\n}}\nThe two-particle spin space is the [[tensor product]] of the two-dimensional spin Hilbert spaces of the individual particles. Each individual space is an [[Irreducible representation|irreducible representation space]] of the [[rotation group SO(3)]]. The product space decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible representations with definite total spins {{math|0}} and {{math|1}} of dimensions {{math|1}} and {{math|3}} respectively. Full details may be found in [[Clebsch\u2013Gordan coefficients|Clebsch\u2014Gordan decomposition]]. The total spin zero subspace is spanned by the [[singlet state]] in the product space, a vector explicitly given by\n:<math>\n  |A\\rangle =\n  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\alpha^{(1)}\\beta^{(2)} - \\beta^{(1)}\\alpha^{(2)}) =\n  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\n    \\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix} \\otimes \\begin{bmatrix}0 \\\\ 1\\end{bmatrix} -\n    \\begin{bmatrix}0 \\\\ 1\\end{bmatrix} \\otimes \\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}\n  \\right),\n</math>\n\nwith adjoint in this representation\n:<math>\\langle A| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\\end{bmatrix}\\otimes\\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1\\end{bmatrix} - \\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1\\end{bmatrix}\\otimes\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\\end{bmatrix}\\right).</math>\n\nThe way single particle operators act on the product space is exemplified below by the example at hand; one defines the tensor product of operators, where the factors are single particle operators, thus if {{math|\u03a0, \u03a9}} are single particle operators,\n:<math>(\\Pi \\otimes \\Omega ) (|x\\rangle \\otimes |y\\rangle) \\equiv \\Pi|x\\rangle \\otimes \\Omega|y\\rangle,</math>\n\nand\n:<math>\\Pi^{(1)} (|x\\rangle \\otimes |y\\rangle) \\equiv \\Pi|x\\rangle \\otimes \\operatorname{Id}|y\\rangle,</math>\n\netc., where the superscript in parentheses indicates on which Hilbert space in the tensor product space the action is intended and the action is defined by the right hand side. The singlet state has total spin {{math|0}} as may be verified by application of the operator of total spin {{math|'''J''' \u00b7 '''J''' {{=}} ('''J'''<sub>1</sub> + '''J'''<sub>2</sub>) \u22c5 ('''J'''<sub>1</sub> + '''J'''<sub>2</sub>)}} by a calculation similar to that presented below.\n\nThe expectation value of the operator\n:<math>\n  \\left(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}\\right)^{(2)}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}\\right)^{(1)} =\n  \\left(\\operatorname{Id} \\otimes \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}\\right)\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{a} \\otimes \\operatorname{Id}\\right),\n</math>\n\nin the singlet state can be calculated straightforwardly.

That is to say, no local hidden variable theory can make the same predictions as quantum mechanics.\n*Experimentally, instances of\n::<math>C_e \\ne C_h</math>\n:have been found (whatever the hidden variable theory), but \n::<math>C_e \\ne C_q\\quad \\text{(not found)}</math>\n:has never been found. That is to say, predictions of quantum mechanics have never been falsified by experiment. These experiments include such that can rule out local hidden variable theories. But see below on possible loopholes.\n\n=== Original Bell's inequality ===\nThe inequality that Bell derived can then be written as:<ref name=Bell1964/>\n\n:<math>C_h(a, c) - C_h(b, a) - C_h(b, c) \\le 1,</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|a, b}} and {{mvar|c}} refer to three arbitrary settings of the two analysers. This inequality is however restricted in its application to the rather special case in which the outcomes on both sides of the experiment are always exactly anticorrelated whenever the analysers are parallel. The advantage of restricting attention to this special case is the resulting simplicity of the derivation. In experimental work, the inequality is not very useful because it is hard, if not impossible, to create ''perfect'' anti-correlation.\n\nThis simple form has an intuitive explanation, however. It is equivalent to the following elementary result from probability theory. Consider three (highly correlated, and possibly biased) coin-flips {{mvar|X, Y}}, and ''Z'', with the property that:\n#''X'' and ''Y'' give the same outcome (both heads or both tails) 99% of the time\n#''Y'' and ''Z'' also give the same outcome 99% of the time,\n\nthen ''X'' and ''Z'' must also yield the same outcome at least 98% of the time. The number of mismatches between ''X'' and ''Y'' (1/100) plus the number of mismatches between ''Y'' and ''Z'' (1/100) are together the ''maximum possible'' number of mismatches between ''X'' and ''Z'' (a simple [[Fr\u00e9chet inequalities|Boole\u2013Fr\u00e9chet inequality]]).\n\nImagine a pair of particles that can be measured at distant locations. Suppose that the measurement devices have settings, which are angles\u2014e.g., the devices measure something called spin in some direction. The experimenter chooses the directions, one for each particle, separately. Suppose the measurement outcome is binary (e.g., spin up, spin down). Suppose the two particles are perfectly anti-correlated\u2014in the sense that whenever both measured in the same direction, one gets identically opposite outcomes, when both measured in opposite directions they always give the same outcome. The only way to imagine how this works is that both particles leave their common source with, somehow, the outcomes they will deliver when measured in any possible direction. (How else could particle 1 know how to deliver the same answer as particle 2 when measured in the same direction? They don't know in advance how they are going to be measured...). The measurement on particle 2 (after switching its sign) can be thought of as telling us what the same measurement on particle 1 would have given.\n\nStart with one setting exactly opposite to the other. All the pairs of particles give the same outcome (each pair is either both spin up or both spin down). Now shift Alice's setting by one degree relative to Bob's. They are now one degree off being exactly opposite to one another. A small fraction of the pairs, say ''f'', now give different outcomes. If instead we had left Alice's setting unchanged but shifted Bob's by one degree (in the opposite direction), then again a fraction ''f'' of the pairs of particles turns out to give different outcomes. Finally consider what happens when both shifts are implemented at the same time: the two settings are now exactly two degrees away from being opposite to one another. By the mismatch argument, the chance of a mismatch at two degrees can't be more than twice the chance of a mismatch at one degree: it cannot be more than 2''f''.\n\nCompare this with the predictions from quantum mechanics for the singlet state. For a small angle {{mvar|\u03b8}}, measured in radians, the chance of a different outcome is approximately <math>f_1=\\theta^2/4</math> as explained by [[small-angle approximation]]. At two times this small angle, the chance of a mismatch is therefore about 4 times larger, since <math>f_2=(2\\theta)^2/4=2^2 \\theta^2/4 \\approx 4f_1</math>. But we just argued that it cannot be more than 2 times as large.\n\nThis intuitive formulation is due to [[David Mermin]]. The small-angle limit is discussed in Bell's original article, and therefore goes right back to the origin of the Bell inequalities.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===CHSH inequality===\n{{Main|CHSH inequality}}\nGeneralizing Bell's original inequality,<ref name=Bell1964/> [[John Clauser]], Michael Horne, [[Abner Shimony]] and R.

It follows that for any <math>\\lambda\\in\\Lambda</math>, one of <math>B+B'</math> and <math>B-B'</math> is zero, and the other is <math>\\pm2</math>. From this it follows that\n\n:<math>AB + AB' + A'B - A'B'= A(B + B') + A'(B - B') \\leq 2,</math>\n\nand therefore\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  C_h(a, b) + C_h(a, b') + C_h(a', b) - C_h(a', b') \n    &= \\int_\\Lambda ABp \\, d\\lambda + \\int_\\Lambda AB'p \\,d\\lambda + \\int_\\Lambda A'Bp \\,d\\lambda - \\int_\\Lambda A'B'p \\,d\\lambda \\\\\n    &= \\int_\\Lambda (AB + AB' + A'B - A'B')p \\,d\\lambda \\\\\n    &= \\int_\\Lambda (A(B + B') + A'(B - B')) p \\,d\\lambda \\leq 2.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nAt the heart of this derivation is a simple algebraic inequality concerning four variables, <math>A,A',B,B'</math>, which take the values <math>\\pm1</math> only:\n\n:<math>AB + AB' + A'B - A'B' = A(B + B') + A'(B - B') \\le 2.</math>\n\nThe CHSH inequality is seen to depend only on the following three key features of a local hidden variables theory: (1) realism: alongside of the outcomes of actually performed measurements, the outcomes of potentially performed measurements also exist at the same time; (2) locality, the outcomes of measurements on Alice's particle don't depend on which measurement Bob chooses to perform on the other particle; (3) freedom: Alice and Bob can indeed choose freely which measurements to perform.\n\nThe ''realism'' assumption is actually somewhat idealistic, and Bell's theorem only proves non-locality with respect to variables that only ''exist'' for metaphysical reasons{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}. However, before the discovery of quantum mechanics, both realism and locality were completely uncontroversial features of physical theories.\n\n====Quantum mechanical predictions violate CHSH inequalities====\nThe measurements performed by Alice and Bob are spin measurements on electrons. Alice can choose between two detector settings labeled <math>a</math> and <math>a'</math>; these settings correspond to measurement of spin along the <math>z</math> or the ''<math>x</math>'' axis. Bob can choose between two detector settings labeled ''<math>b</math>'' and <math>b'</math>; these correspond to measurement of spin along the <math>z'</math> or <math>x'</math> axis, where the <math>x'-z'</math> coordinate system is rotated 135\u00b0 relative to the <math>x-z</math> coordinate system.  The spin observables are represented by the 2 \u00d7 2 self-adjoint matrices:\n\n:<math> S_x = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 &  0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad S_z = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nThese are the [[Pauli spin matrix|Pauli spin matrices]], which are known to have eigenvalues equal to <math>\\pm 1</math>. As is customary, we will use [[bra\u2013ket notation]] to denote the eigenvectors of <math>S_z</math> as <math>|0\\rangle,|1\\rangle</math>, where<math display=\"block\">|0\\rangle\\equiv\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix},\n\\qquad\n|1\\rangle\\equiv\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}.</math>Consider now the single state <math>|\\Phi^-\\rangle</math> defined as <math display=\"block\">|\\Phi^-\\rangle\\equiv\\frac{1}{\\sqrt2}\\left(|0,1\\rangle-|1,0\\rangle\\right),</math>where we used the shortened notation <math>|0,1\\rangle\\equiv|0\\rangle\\otimes|1\\rangle,\n|1,0\\rangle\\equiv|1\\rangle\\otimes|0\\rangle.</math>\n\nAccording to quantum mechanics, the choice of measurements is encoded into the choice of Hermitian operators applied to this state. In particular, consider the following operators:\n\n: <math display=\"block\">\\begin{align}\n  A(a)  &= S_z \\otimes I\\\\\n  A(a') &= S_x \\otimes I\\\\\n  B(b)  &= \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\ I \\otimes (S_z + S_x)\\\\\n  B(b') &=  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\ I \\otimes (S_z - S_x),\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere <math>A(a),A(a')</math> represent two measurement choices of Alice, and <math>B(b),B(b')</math> two measurement choices of Bob.\n\nTo obtain the expectation value given by a given measurement choice of Alice and Bob, one has to compute the expectation value of the corresponding pair of operators (for example, <math>A(a)B(b)</math> if the inputs are chosen to be <math>a, b</math>) over the shared state <math>|\\Phi^-\\rangle</math>.\n\nFor example, the expectation value <math>\\langle A(a)B(b)\\rangle</math> corresponding to Alice choosing the measurement setting <math>a</math> and Bob choosing the measurement setting <math>b</math> is computed as<math display=\"block\">\\langle A(a)B(b)\\rangle \\equiv \\langle \\Phi^-|\\left(\\frac{-1}{\\sqrt2}S_z\\otimes(S_x+S_z) \\right)\n|\\Phi^-\\rangle =\n-\\frac{1}{2}\\langle\\Phi^-|\\Big[|0\\rangle\\otimes(|0\\rangle-|1\\rangle)+|1\\rangle\\otimes(|1\\rangle+|0\\rangle)\\Big]\n=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt2}.</math>Similar computations are used to obtain<math display=\"block\">\\begin{align}\n  \\left\\langle A(a) B(b) \\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle A(a') B(b) \\right\\rangle =\n    \\left\\langle A(a') B(b') \\right\\rangle &=  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\n                \\left\\langle A(a) B(b') \\right\\rangle &= -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\end{align}</math>It follows that the value of <math>S</math> given by this particular experimental arrangement is\n\n:<math>\n  \\left\\langle A(a) B(b) \\right\\rangle + \\left\\langle A(a') B(b') \\right\\rangle +\n  \\left\\langle A\\left(a'\\right) B(b) \\right\\rangle - \\left\\langle A(a) B(b') \\right\\rangle =\n    \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{2}} = 2\\sqrt{2} > 2.\n</math>\n\nBell's Theorem: If the quantum mechanical formalism is correct, then the system consisting of a pair of entangled electrons cannot satisfy the principle of local realism.  Note that <math>2\\sqrt2</math> is indeed the upper bound for quantum mechanics called [[Tsirelson's bound]].

Each photon encounters a two-channel polariser whose orientation (a or b) can be set by the experimenter. Emerging signals from each channel are detected and coincidences of four types (++, \u2212\u2212, +\u2212 and \u2212+) counted by the coincidence monitor.]]\n{{Main|Bell test experiments}}\n\nExperimental tests can determine whether the Bell inequalities required by local realism hold up to the empirical evidence.\n\nActually, most experiments have been performed using polarization of photons rather than spin of electrons (or other spin-half particles). The quantum state of the pair of entangled photons is not the singlet state, and the correspondence between angles and outcomes is different from that in the spin-half set-up. The polarization of a photon is measured in a pair of perpendicular directions. Relative to a given orientation, polarization is either vertical (denoted by V or by +) or horizontal (denoted by H or by -). The photon pairs are generated in the quantum state\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left (|V\\rangle\\otimes |V\\rangle+|H\\rangle\\otimes|H\\rangle \\right)</math>\n\nwhere <math>|V\\rangle</math> and <math>|H\\rangle</math> denotes the state of a single vertically or horizontally polarized photon, respectively (relative to a fixed and common reference direction for both particles).\n\nWhen the polarization of both photons is measured in the same direction, both give the same outcome: perfect correlation. When measured at directions making an angle 45\u00b0 with one another, the outcomes are completely random (uncorrelated). Measuring at directions at 90\u00b0 to one another, the two are perfectly anti-correlated. In general, when the polarizers are at an angle {{mvar|\u03b8}} to one another, the correlation is {{math|cos(2''\u03b8'')}}. So relative to the correlation function for the singlet state of spin half particles, we have a positive rather than a negative cosine function, and angles are halved: the correlation is periodic with period {{mvar|\u03c0}} instead of {{math|2''\u03c0''}}.\n\nBell's inequalities are tested by \"coincidence counts\" from a Bell test experiment such as the optical one shown in the diagram.  Pairs of particles are emitted as a result of a quantum process, analysed with respect to some key property such as polarisation direction, then detected.  The setting (orientations) of the analysers are selected by the experimenter.\n\nBell test experiments to date overwhelmingly violate Bell's inequality.\n\n===Two classes of Bell inequalities===\nThe [[Loopholes in Bell test experiments#Detection efficiency, or fair sampling|fair sampling problem]] was faced openly in the 1970s. In early designs of their 1973 experiment, Freedman and Clauser<ref name=\"Clauser\u2013Freedman\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.28.938 |title=Experimental Test of Local Hidden-Variable Theories |year=1972 |last1=Freedman |first1=Stuart J. |last2=Clauser |first2=John F. |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=28 |issue=14 |pages=938\u2013941|bibcode = 1972PhRvL..28..938F |url= http://dieumsnh.qfb.umich.mx/archivoshistoricosMQ/ModernaHist/Freedman.pdf }}</ref> used ''fair sampling'' in the form of the Clauser\u2013Horne\u2013Shimony\u2013Holt (CHSH<ref name=\"Clauser 1969\"/>) hypothesis. However, shortly afterwards Clauser and Horne<ref name=\"Clauser\u2013Horne\"/>  made the important distinction between inhomogeneous (IBI) and homogeneous (HBI) Bell inequalities. Testing an IBI requires that we compare certain coincidence rates in two separated detectors with the singles rates of the two detectors. Nobody needed to perform the experiment, because singles rates with all detectors in the 1970s were at least ten times all the coincidence rates. So, taking into account this low detector efficiency, the QM prediction actually satisfied the IBI. To arrive at an experimental design in which the QM prediction violates IBI we require detectors whose efficiency exceeds 82.8% for singlet states,<ref name=\"Garg & Mermin, 1987\">{{citation |author1=Anupam Garg |author2=N.D.

This is now within reach.\n\n===Practical challenges===\n{{Main|Loopholes in Bell test experiments}}\n\nBecause, at that time, even the best detectors didn't detect a large fraction of all photons, Clauser and Horne<ref name=\"Clauser\u2013Horne\"/> recognized that testing Bell's inequality required some extra assumptions. They introduced the ''No Enhancement Hypothesis'' (NEH):\n\n{{quote|A light signal, originating in an [[atomic cascade]] for example, has a certain probability of activating a detector.  Then, if a polarizer is interposed between the cascade and the detector, the detection probability cannot increase.}}\n\nGiven this assumption, there is a Bell inequality between the coincidence rates with polarizers and coincidence rates without polarizers.\n\nThe experiment was performed by Freedman and Clauser,<ref name=\"Clauser\u2013Freedman\"/> who found that the Bell's inequality was violated. So the no-enhancement hypothesis cannot be true in a local hidden variables model.\n\nWhile early experiments used atomic cascades,  later experiments have used parametric down-conversion, following a suggestion by Reid and Walls,<ref>{{cite journal|author1-link=Margaret D. Reid |first1=M. D. |last1=Reid |first2=D. F. |last2=Walls |title= Violations of classical inequalities in quantum optics|journal=[[Physical Review A]]|volume=34|issue=2 |pages=1260\u20131276|year=1986|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.34.1260|bibcode = 1986PhRvA..34.1260R }}</ref> giving improved generation and detection properties. As a result, recent experiments with photons no longer have to suffer from the detection loophole. This made the photon the first experimental system for which all main experimental loopholes were surmounted, although at first only in separate experiments. From 2015, experimentalists were able to surmount all the main experimental loopholes simultaneously; see [[Bell test experiments]].\n\n<br />\n\n== Interpretations of Bell's theorem ==\n\n=== Non-local hidden variables ===\n\nMost advocates of the hidden-variables idea believe that experiments have ruled out local hidden variables.  They are ready to give up locality, explaining the violation of Bell's inequality by means of a non-local [[hidden variable theory]], in which the particles exchange information about their states. This is the basis of the [[Bohm interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, which requires that all particles in the universe be able to instantaneously exchange information with all others. A 2007 experiment ruled out a large class of non-Bohmian non-local hidden variable theories.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature05677 |title=An experimental test of non-local realism |year=2007 |last1=Gr\u00f6blacher |first1=Simon |last2=Paterek |first2=Tomasz |last3=Kaltenbaek |first3=Rainer |last4=Brukner |first4=\u010caslav |last5=\u017bukowski |first5=Marek |last6=Aspelmeyer |first6=Markus |last7=Zeilinger |first7=Anton |journal=Nature |volume=446 |issue=7138 |pages=871\u20135 |pmid=17443179|bibcode = 2007Natur.446..871G | arxiv= 0704.2529 }}</ref>\n\n===Transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics===\n\nIf the hidden variables can communicate with each other faster than light, Bell's inequality can easily be violated. Once one particle is measured, it can communicate the necessary correlations to the other particle. Since in relativity the notion of simultaneity is not absolute, this is unattractive. One idea is to replace instantaneous communication with a process that travels backwards in time along the past [[light cone]]. This is the idea behind a [[transactional interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, which interprets the statistical emergence of a quantum history as a gradual coming to agreement between histories that go both forward and backward in time.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.58.647|title=The transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics|year=1986|last1=Cramer|first1=John|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics| volume=58| issue=3| pages=647\u2013687| bibcode = 1986RvMP...58..647C }}</ref>\n\n=== Many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics ===\n\nThe [[Many-Worlds interpretation]] is local and deterministic, as it consists of the unitary part of quantum mechanics without collapse. It can generate correlations that violate a Bell inequality because it doesn't satisfy the implicit assumption that Bell made that measurements have a single outcome. In fact, Bell's theorem can be proven in the Many-Worlds framework from the assumption that a measurement has a single outcome. Therefore a violation of a Bell inequality can be interpreted as a demonstration that measurements have multiple outcomes.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=David Deutsch |author2=Patrick Hayden |title=Information flow in entangled quantum systems |journal=Proceedigs of the Royal Society A |date=200 |volume=456 |pages=1759{1774 |doi=10.1098/rspa.2000.0585|arxiv=quant-ph/9906007}}</ref>\n\nThe explanation it provides for the Bell correlations is that when Alice and Bob make their measurements, they split into local branches. From the point of view of each copy of Alice, there are multiple copies of Bob experiencing different results, so Bob cannot have a definite result, and the same is true from the point of view of each copy of Bob. They will obtain a mutually well-defined result only when their future light cones overlap. At this point we can say that the Bell correlation starts existing, but it was produced by a purely local mechanism. Therefore the violation of a Bell inequality cannot be interpreted as a proof of non-locality.<ref>{{Cite book|author1=Harvey R. Brown|author2 = Christopher G.

There is no need for a faster-than-light signal to tell particle ''A'' what measurement has been carried out on particle&nbsp;''B'', because the universe, including particle&nbsp;''A'', already 'knows' what that measurement, and its outcome, will be.<ref>The quotation is an adaptation from the edited transcript of the radio interview with John Bell of 1985.

This interpretation is a misunderstanding of probability theory. As Jaynes shows,<ref name=\"E.T. Jaynes 1989\"/> \"one cannot even reason correctly in so simple a problem as drawing two balls from Bernoulli's Urn, if he interprets probabilities in this way.\"\n# Bell's inequality does not apply to some possible hidden variable theories. It only applies to a certain class of local hidden variable theories.  In fact, it might have just missed the kind of hidden variable theories that Einstein is most interested in.\n\n[[Richard D. Gill]] claimed that Jaynes misunderstood Bell's analysis. Gill points out that in the same conference volume in which Jaynes argues against Bell, Jaynes confesses to being extremely impressed by a short proof by [[Steve Gull]] presented at the same conference, that the singlet correlations could not be reproduced by a computer simulation of a local hidden variables theory.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Time, Finite Statistics, and Bell's Fifth Position |year=2003 |last1=Gill |first1=Richard D. |journal=Proc.

This non-locality was originally supposed to be illusory, because the standard interpretation could easily do away with action-at-a-distance by simply assigning to each particle definite spin-states for all possible spin directions. The EPR argument was: therefore these definite states exist, therefore quantum theory is incomplete in the EPR sense, since they do not appear in the theory. Bell's theorem showed that the \"entangledness\" prediction of quantum mechanics has a degree of non-locality that cannot be explained away by any classical theory of local hidden variables.\n\nWhat is powerful about Bell's theorem is that it doesn't refer to any particular theory of local hidden variables.

Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen presented a scenario that, in their view, indicated that quantum particles, like [[electron]]s and [[photon]]s, must carry physical properties or attributes not included in quantum theory, and the uncertainties in quantum theory's predictions are due to ignorance of these properties, later termed \"hidden variables\". Their scenario involves a pair of widely separated physical objects, prepared in such a way that the [[quantum state]] of the pair is [[quantum entanglement|entangled]].\n\nBell carried the analysis of quantum entanglement much further. He deduced that if measurements are performed independently on the two separated halves of a pair, then the assumption that the outcomes depend upon hidden variables within each half implies a constraint on how the outcomes on the two halves are correlated. This constraint would later be named the Bell inequality. Bell then showed that quantum physics predicts correlations that violate this inequality. Consequently, the only way that hidden variables could explain the predictions of quantum physics is if they are \"nonlocal\", somehow associated with both halves of the pair and able to carry influences instantly between them no matter how widely the two halves are separated.<ref name=\"C.B.

These have been [[Bell test experiments|tested experimentally]] in physics laboratories many times since 1972. Often, these experiments have had the goal of ameliorating problems of experimental design or set-up that could in principle affect the validity of the findings of earlier Bell tests. This is known as \"closing [[loopholes in Bell test experiments]]\". To date, Bell tests have found that the hypothesis of local hidden variables is inconsistent with the way that physical systems do, in fact, behave.<ref name=\"NAT-20180509\">{{cite journal |author=The BIG Bell Test Collaboration |title=Challenging local realism with human choices |date=9 May 2018 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=557 |issue=7704 |pages=212\u2013216 |doi=10.1038/s41586-018-0085-3 |pmid=29743691 |bibcode=2018Natur.557..212B |arxiv=1805.04431 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/20170207-bell-test-quantum-loophole/|title=Experiment Reaffirms Quantum Weirdness|last=Wolchover|first=Natalie|authorlink=Natalie Wolchover|date=2017-02-07|work=[[Quanta Magazine]]|language=en-US|accessdate=2020-02-08}}</ref>\n\nThe exact nature of the assumptions required to prove a Bell-type constraint on correlations have been debated by physicists and by [[philosophy of physics|philosophers]]. While the significance of Bell's theorem is not in doubt, its full implications for the [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]] remain unresolved.\n\n== Historical background ==\nIn the early 1930s, the philosophical implications of the current interpretations of quantum theory troubled many prominent physicists of the day, including [[Albert Einstein]].  In a well-known 1935 paper, [[Boris Podolsky]] and co-authors Einstein and [[Nathan Rosen]] (collectively \"EPR\") sought to demonstrate by the [[EPR paradox]] that quantum mechanics was incomplete.  This provided hope that a more complete (and less troubling) theory might one day be discovered.  But that conclusion rested on the seemingly reasonable assumptions of ''locality'' and ''realism'' (together called \"local realism\" or \"[[local hidden variables]]\", often interchangeably). In the vernacular of Einstein: [[Principle of locality|locality]] meant no instantaneous [[quantum entanglement|(\"spooky\") action at a distance]]; realism meant the moon is there even when not being observed. These assumptions were hotly debated in the physics community, notably [[Bohr\u2013Einstein debates|between Einstein and Niels Bohr]].\n\nIn his groundbreaking 1964 paper, \"On the Einstein Podolsky Rosen paradox\",<ref name=Bell1964/><ref>Reprinted in {{cite book |title=Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics: Collected Papers on Quantum Philosophy  |author=JS Bell |chapter=Chapter 2:On the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mwAhAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT8 |isbn=978-0521523387  |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |edition=Alain Aspect introduction to 1987 |pages=14\u201321}}</ref> physicist [[John Stewart Bell]] presented an analogy (based on spin measurements on pairs of entangled electrons) to EPR's hypothetical paradox.  Using their reasoning, he said, a choice of measurement setting here should not affect the outcome of measurement there (and vice versa).  After providing a mathematical formulation of locality and realism based on this, he showed specific cases where this would be inconsistent with the predictions of quantum mechanics theory.\n\nNon-local hidden variable theories are inconsistent with the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics. In the latter, the measurement instrument is differentiated from the quantum effects being observed. This has been called the \"[[measurement problem]]\" and the \"[[Observer effect (physics)|observer effect]].\"\n\nIn experimental tests following Bell's example, now using [[quantum entanglement]] of photons instead of electrons, [[John Clauser]] and [[Stuart Freedman]] (1972) and [[Alain Aspect]] ''et al''. (1981) demonstrated that the predictions of quantum mechanics are correct in this regard, although relying on additional unverifiable assumptions that open [[Loopholes in Bell test experiments|loopholes]] for local realism.\n\nIn October 2015, Hensen and colleagues<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |doi = 10.1038/nature15759 | volume=526 | issue=7575 | title=Loophole-free Bell inequality violation using electron spins separated by 1.3 kilometres | journal=Nature | pages=682\u2013686|bibcode = 2015Natur.526..682H |arxiv=1508.05949 | pmid=26503041 | last1 = Hensen | first1 = B | last2 = Bernien | first2 = H | last3 = Dr\u00e9au | first3 = AE | last4 = Reiserer | first4 = A | last5 = Kalb | first5 = N | last6 = Blok | first6 = MS | last7 = Ruitenberg | first7 = J | last8 = Vermeulen | first8 = RF | last9 = Schouten | first9 = RN | last10 = Abell\u00e1n | first10 = C | last11 = Amaya | first11 = W | last12 = Pruneri | first12 = V | last13 = Mitchell | first13 = MW | last14 = Markham | first14 = M | last15 = Twitchen | first15 = DJ | last16 = Elkouss | first16 = D | last17 = Wehner | first17 = S | last18 = Taminiau | first18 = TH | last19 = Hanson | first19 = R| year=2015 }}</ref> reported that they performed a loophole-free Bell test which might force one to reject at least one of the principles of locality, realism, or [[Loopholes in Bell test experiments#Free choice of detector orientations|freedom-of-choice]] (the last \"could\" lead to alternative [[Superdeterminism|superdeterministic]] theories).<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Zeeya Merali |title=Quantum 'spookiness' passes toughest test yet |journal=Nature |volume= 525 |issue=7567 |pages=14\u201315 |date=2015-08-27|doi=10.1038/nature.2015.18255 |pmid=26333448 |bibcode=2015Natur.525...14M |doi-access=free }}</ref> Two of these logical possibilities, non-locality and non-realism, correspond to well-developed interpretations of quantum mechanics, and have many supporters; this is not the case for the third logical possibility, non-freedom. Conclusive experimental evidence of the violation of Bell's inequality would drastically reduce the class of acceptable deterministic theories but would not falsify absolute determinism, which was described by Bell himself as \"not just inanimate nature running on behind-the-scenes clockwork, but with our behaviour, including our belief that we are free to choose to do one experiment rather than another, absolutely predetermined\". However, Bell himself considered absolute determinism an implausible solution.\n\n== Overview ==\n{{Specific|section|date=June 2019}}\nThe theorem is usually proved by consideration of a quantum system of two [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] [[qubit]]s with the original tests as stated above done on photons. The most common examples concern systems of particles that are entangled in [[spin (physics)|spin]] or [[polarization (waves)|polarization]]. Quantum mechanics allows predictions of correlations that would be observed if these two particles have their spin or polarization measured in different directions. Bell showed that if a local hidden variable theory holds, then these correlations would have to satisfy certain constraints, called Bell inequalities.\n\n[[File:Mermin's inequality.pdf|thumb|400px|With two-state particles and observables A, B and C (as on the picture) one gets the violation of Bell-type inequality. According to quantum mechanics, the sum of probabilities to get equal results measuring different observables is 3/4. But assuming predetermined results (equal for the same observables), this sum must be at least 1 since in each pair at least two out of three observables are then predetermined to be equal.]]\n\nFollowing the argument in the [[EPR paradox|Einstein\u2013Podolsky\u2013Rosen (EPR) paradox]] paper (but using the example of spin, as in [[David Bohm]]'s version of the EPR argument<ref>{{cite book|last=Bohm|first=David|title=Quantum Theory|authorlink=David Bohm|publisher=Prentice\u2212Hall|year=1951}}</ref>), Bell considered a [[thought experiment]] in which there are \"a pair of spin one-half particles formed somehow in the [[Singlet state|singlet spin state]] and moving freely in opposite directions.\"<ref name=Bell1964/> The two particles travel away from each other to two distant locations, at which measurements of spin are performed, along axes that are independently chosen. Each measurement yields a result of either spin-up&nbsp;(+) or spin-down&nbsp;(\u2212); it means, spin in the positive or negative direction of the chosen axis.\n\nThe probability of the same result being obtained at the two locations depends on the relative angles at which the two spin measurements are made, and is strictly between zero and one for all relative angles other than perfectly parallel or antiparallel alignments (0\u00b0 or 180\u00b0). Since total angular momentum is conserved, and since the total spin is zero in the singlet state, the probability of the same result with parallel (antiparallel) alignment is 0 (1). This last prediction is true classically as well as quantum mechanically.\n\nBell's theorem is concerned with correlations defined in terms of averages taken over very many trials of the experiment. The [[Quantum correlation|correlation]] of two binary variables is usually defined in quantum physics as the average of the products of the pairs of measurements. Note that this is different from the usual definition of [[correlation]] in statistics. The quantum physicist's \"correlation\" is the statistician's \"raw (uncentered, unnormalized) product [[Moment (mathematics)|moment]]\". They are similar in that, with either definition, if the pairs of outcomes are always the same, the correlation is +1; if the pairs of outcomes are always opposite, the correlation is \u22121; and if the pairs of outcomes agree 50% of the time, then the correlation is 0. The correlation is related in a simple way to the probability of equal outcomes, namely it is equal to twice the probability of equal outcomes, minus one.\n\n[[Pauli operator|Measuring the spin]] of these entangled particles along anti-parallel directions (i.e., facing in precisely opposite directions, perhaps offset by some arbitrary distance) the set of all results is perfectly correlated. On the other hand, if measurements are performed along parallel directions (i.e., facing in precisely the same direction, perhaps offset by some arbitrary distance) they always yield opposite results, and the set of measurements shows perfect anti-correlation. This is in accord with the above stated probabilities of measuring the same result in these two cases. Finally, measurement at perpendicular directions has a 50% chance of matching, and the total set of measurements is uncorrelated. These basic cases are illustrated in the table below. Columns should be read as ''examples'' of pairs of values that could be recorded by Alice and Bob with time increasing going to the right.\n\n{| style=\"float:center; text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:bottom;\"\n! rowspan=2 style=\"text-align:left;\" | Anti-parallel\n! colspan=6 | Pair\n! rowspan=2 |\n|-\n! 1    !! 2  !! 3  !! 4  !! ... !! {{math|''n''}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | [[Alice and Bob|Alice]], 0\u00b0\n| +    || \u2212  || +  || +  || ... || \u2212              ||\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | [[Alice and Bob|Bob]], 180\u00b0\n| +    || \u2212  || +  || +  || ... || \u2212              ||\n|- style=\"text-align:left;\"\n| Correlation\n| ( +1 || +1 || +1 || +1 || ... || +1 )           || / {{math|''n''}} = +1\n|-\n| colspan=7 |\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | <small>(100% identical)</small>\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | Parallel\n! 1    !! 2  !! 3  !! 4  !! ... !! {{math|''n''}}\n!\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | [[Alice and Bob|Alice]], 0\u00b0\n| +    || \u2212  || \u2212  || +  || ... || +              ||\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | [[Alice and Bob|Bob]], 0\u00b0 or 360\u00b0\n| \u2212    || +  || +  || \u2212  || ... || \u2212              ||\n|- style=\"text-align:left;\"\n| Correlation\n| ( \u22121 || \u22121 || \u22121 || \u22121 || ... || \u22121 )           || / {{math|''n''}} = \u22121\n|-\n| colspan=7 |\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | <small>(100% opposite)</small>\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | Orthogonal\n! 1    !! 2  !! 3  !! 4  !! ... !! {{math|''n''}}\n!\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Alice, 0\u00b0\n| +    || \u2212  || +  || \u2212  || ... || \u2212              ||\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Bob, 90\u00b0 or 270\u00b0\n| \u2212    || \u2212  || +  || +  || ... || \u2212              ||\n|- style=\"text-align:left;\"\n| Correlation\n| ( \u22121 || +1 || +1 || \u22121 || ... || +1 )           || / {{math|''n''}} = 0\n|-\n| colspan=7 |\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | <small>(50% identical, 50% opposite)</small>\n|}\n\n[[Image:Bell.svg|400px|thumb|The best possible local realist imitation (red) for the quantum correlation of two spins in the singlet state (blue), insisting on perfect anti-correlation at 0\u00b0, perfect correlation at 180\u00b0.

In his paper, Bell started from the same two assumptions as did EPR, namely (i) ''reality'' (that microscopic objects have real properties determining the outcomes of quantum mechanical measurements), and (ii) ''locality'' (that reality in one location is not influenced by measurements performed simultaneously at a distant location). Bell was able to derive from those two assumptions an important result, namely Bell's inequality. The theoretical (and later experimental) violation of this inequality implies that at least one of the two assumptions must be false.\n\nIn two respects Bell's 1964 paper was a step forward compared to the EPR paper: firstly, it considered more [[Hidden variable theory|hidden variables]] than merely the [[EPR paradox|element of physical reality]] in the EPR paper; and Bell's inequality was, in part, experimentally testable, thus raising the possibility of testing the local realism hypothesis. Limitations on such tests to date are noted below.  Whereas Bell's paper deals only with deterministic hidden variable theories, Bell's theorem was later generalized to [[stochastic]] theories<ref name=\"Clauser\u2013Horne\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.10.526|title=Experimental consequences of objective local theories|year=1974|last1=Clauser|first1=John F.|journal=Physical Review D|volume=10|issue=2|pages=526\u2013535|bibcode=1974PhRvD..10..526C|url=http://www.philoscience.unibe.ch/documents/physics/Clauser1974/Clauser1974.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225072037/http://www.philoscience.unibe.ch/documents/physics/Clauser1974/Clauser1974.pdf|archivedate=2013-12-25}}</ref> as well, and it was also realised<ref>{{cite journal |last= Eberhard |first=P.

Existence of these variables is called the assumption of realism, or the assumption of [[counterfactual definiteness]].\n\nAfter the EPR paper, quantum mechanics was in an unsatisfactory position: either it was incomplete, in the sense that it failed to account for some elements of physical reality, or it violated the principle of a finite propagation speed of physical effects. In a modified version of the EPR thought experiment, two hypothetical [[Observer (quantum physics)|observers]], now commonly referred to as [[Alice and Bob|''Alice'' and ''Bob'']], perform independent measurements of spin on a pair of electrons, prepared at a source in a special state called a ''[[spin singlet]] state''. It is the conclusion of EPR that once Alice measures spin in one direction (e.g. on the ''x'' axis), Bob's measurement in that direction is determined with certainty, as being the opposite outcome to that of Alice, whereas immediately before Alice's measurement Bob's outcome was only statistically determined (i.e., was only a probability, not a certainty); thus, either the spin in each direction is an ''element of physical reality'', or the effects travel from Alice to Bob instantly.\n\nIn QM, predictions are formulated in terms of [[probability|probabilities]] \u2014 for example, the probability that an [[electron]] will be detected in a particular place, or the probability that its spin is up or down. The idea persisted, however, that the electron in fact has a ''definite'' position and spin, and that QM's weakness is its inability to predict those values precisely. The possibility existed that some unknown theory, such as a ''hidden variables theory'', might be able to predict those quantities exactly, while at the same time also being in complete agreement with the probabilities predicted by QM. If such a hidden variables theory exists, then because the hidden variables are not described by QM the latter would be an incomplete theory.\n\n==Local realism==\nThe concept of local realism is formalized to state, and prove, Bell's theorem and generalizations.  A common approach is the following:\n# There is a [[probability space]] {{math|\u039b}} and the observed outcomes by both Alice and Bob result by random sampling of the (unknown, \"hidden\") parameter {{math|''\u03bb'' \u2208 \u039b}}.\n# The values observed by Alice or Bob are functions of the local detector settings, the state of the incoming event (spin for material or phase for photon) and the hidden parameter only. Thus, there are functions {{math|''A'',''B'' : ''S''<sup>2</sup> \u00d7 \u039b \u2192 {-1, +1} }}, where a detector setting is modeled as a location on the unit sphere {{math|''S''<sup>2</sup>}}, such that\n#*The value observed by Alice with detector setting {{mvar|a}} is {{math|''A''(''a'', ''\u03bb'')}}\n#*The value observed by Bob with detector setting {{mvar|b}} is {{math|''B''(''b'', ''\u03bb'')}}\n\nPerfect anti-correlation would require {{math|''B''(''c'', ''\u03bb'') {{=}} \u2212''A''(''c'', ''\u03bb''), ''c'' \u2208 ''S''<sup>2</sup>}}. Implicit in assumption 1) above, the hidden parameter space {{math|\u039b}} has a [[probability measure]] {{mvar|\u03bc}} and the [[expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation]] of a random variable {{mvar|X}} on {{math|\u039b}} with respect to {{mvar|\u03bc}} is written\n\n:<math> \\operatorname{E}(X) = \\int_\\Lambda X(\\lambda) p(\\lambda) \\, d \\lambda, </math>\n\nwhere for accessibility of notation we assume that the probability measure has a [[probability density]] {{mvar|p}} that therefore is nonnegative and integrates to {{math|1}}. The hidden parameter is often thought of as being associated with the source but it can just as well also contain components associated with the two measurement devices.\n\n== Bell inequalities ==\nBell inequalities concern measurements made by observers on pairs of particles that have interacted and then separated. Assuming local realism, certain constraints must hold on the relationships between the correlations between subsequent measurements of the particles under various possible measurement settings. Let {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} be as above. Define for the present purposes three correlation functions:\n*Let {{math|''C''<sub>''e''</sub>(''a'', ''b'')}} denote the experimentally measured correlation defined by\n*:<math>C_e(a, b) = \\frac{N_{++} + N_{--} - N_{+-} - N_{-+}}{N_{++} + N_{--} + N_{+-} + N_{-+}},</math>\n:where {{math|''N''<sub>++</sub>}} is the number of measurements yielding \"spin up\" in the direction of {{math|'''a'''}} measured by Alice (first subscript {{math|+}}) ''and'' \"spin up\" in the direction of {{math|'''b'''}} measured by Bob. The other occurrences of {{mvar|N}} are analogously defined. In other words, this expression denotes the number of times Alice and Bob found the same spin, minus the number of times they found an opposite spin, divided by the total number of measurements, for a given pair of angles.\n*Let {{math|''C''<sub>''q''</sub>(''a'', ''b'')}} denote the correlation as predicted by quantum mechanics. This is given by the expression\n*:<math>C_q(a, b) = \\left\\langle A \\left|(\\boldsymbol\\sigma \\cdot \\mathbf b)^{(2)}(\\boldsymbol\\sigma \\cdot \\mathbf a)^{(1)}\\right| A \\right\\rangle,</math>\n:where {{mvar|A}} is the antisymmetric spin wave function. This value is calculated to be\n::<math>C_q(a, b) = -\\mathbf a \\cdot \\mathbf b.</math>\n*Let {{math|''C''<sub>''h''</sub>(''a'', ''b'')}} denote the correlation as predicted by any hidden variable theory. In the formalization of above, this is\n*:<math>C_h(a, b) = E(A(\\mathbf{a}, \\lambda) B(\\mathbf{b}, \\lambda)) = \\int_\\Lambda A(\\mathbf{a}, \\lambda)B(\\mathbf{b}, \\lambda) p(\\lambda) \\, d\\lambda.</math>\n\n{{Hidden begin\n | title style=color:green; background:lightgrey;\n | title=Details on calculation of {{math|''C''<sub>''q''</sub>('''a''', '''b''')}}\n}}\nThe two-particle spin space is the [[tensor product]] of the two-dimensional spin Hilbert spaces of the individual particles. Each individual space is an [[Irreducible representation|irreducible representation space]] of the [[rotation group SO(3)]]. The product space decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible representations with definite total spins {{math|0}} and {{math|1}} of dimensions {{math|1}} and {{math|3}} respectively. Full details may be found in [[Clebsch\u2013Gordan coefficients|Clebsch\u2014Gordan decomposition]]. The total spin zero subspace is spanned by the [[singlet state]] in the product space, a vector explicitly given by\n:<math>\n  |A\\rangle =\n  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\alpha^{(1)}\\beta^{(2)} - \\beta^{(1)}\\alpha^{(2)}) =\n  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\n    \\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix} \\otimes \\begin{bmatrix}0 \\\\ 1\\end{bmatrix} -\n    \\begin{bmatrix}0 \\\\ 1\\end{bmatrix} \\otimes \\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}\n  \\right),\n</math>\n\nwith adjoint in this representation\n:<math>\\langle A| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\\end{bmatrix}\\otimes\\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1\\end{bmatrix} - \\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1\\end{bmatrix}\\otimes\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\\end{bmatrix}\\right).</math>\n\nThe way single particle operators act on the product space is exemplified below by the example at hand; one defines the tensor product of operators, where the factors are single particle operators, thus if {{math|\u03a0, \u03a9}} are single particle operators,\n:<math>(\\Pi \\otimes \\Omega ) (|x\\rangle \\otimes |y\\rangle) \\equiv \\Pi|x\\rangle \\otimes \\Omega|y\\rangle,</math>\n\nand\n:<math>\\Pi^{(1)} (|x\\rangle \\otimes |y\\rangle) \\equiv \\Pi|x\\rangle \\otimes \\operatorname{Id}|y\\rangle,</math>\n\netc., where the superscript in parentheses indicates on which Hilbert space in the tensor product space the action is intended and the action is defined by the right hand side. The singlet state has total spin {{math|0}} as may be verified by application of the operator of total spin {{math|'''J''' \u00b7 '''J''' {{=}} ('''J'''<sub>1</sub> + '''J'''<sub>2</sub>) \u22c5 ('''J'''<sub>1</sub> + '''J'''<sub>2</sub>)}} by a calculation similar to that presented below.\n\nThe expectation value of the operator\n:<math>\n  \\left(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}\\right)^{(2)}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}\\right)^{(1)} =\n  \\left(\\operatorname{Id} \\otimes \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}\\right)\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{a} \\otimes \\operatorname{Id}\\right),\n</math>\n\nin the singlet state can be calculated straightforwardly.

That is to say, no local hidden variable theory can make the same predictions as quantum mechanics.\n*Experimentally, instances of\n::<math>C_e \\ne C_h</math>\n:have been found (whatever the hidden variable theory), but \n::<math>C_e \\ne C_q\\quad \\text{(not found)}</math>\n:has never been found. That is to say, predictions of quantum mechanics have never been falsified by experiment. These experiments include such that can rule out local hidden variable theories. But see below on possible loopholes.\n\n=== Original Bell's inequality ===\nThe inequality that Bell derived can then be written as:<ref name=Bell1964/>\n\n:<math>C_h(a, c) - C_h(b, a) - C_h(b, c) \\le 1,</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|a, b}} and {{mvar|c}} refer to three arbitrary settings of the two analysers. This inequality is however restricted in its application to the rather special case in which the outcomes on both sides of the experiment are always exactly anticorrelated whenever the analysers are parallel. The advantage of restricting attention to this special case is the resulting simplicity of the derivation. In experimental work, the inequality is not very useful because it is hard, if not impossible, to create ''perfect'' anti-correlation.\n\nThis simple form has an intuitive explanation, however. It is equivalent to the following elementary result from probability theory. Consider three (highly correlated, and possibly biased) coin-flips {{mvar|X, Y}}, and ''Z'', with the property that:\n#''X'' and ''Y'' give the same outcome (both heads or both tails) 99% of the time\n#''Y'' and ''Z'' also give the same outcome 99% of the time,\n\nthen ''X'' and ''Z'' must also yield the same outcome at least 98% of the time. The number of mismatches between ''X'' and ''Y'' (1/100) plus the number of mismatches between ''Y'' and ''Z'' (1/100) are together the ''maximum possible'' number of mismatches between ''X'' and ''Z'' (a simple [[Fr\u00e9chet inequalities|Boole\u2013Fr\u00e9chet inequality]]).\n\nImagine a pair of particles that can be measured at distant locations. Suppose that the measurement devices have settings, which are angles\u2014e.g., the devices measure something called spin in some direction. The experimenter chooses the directions, one for each particle, separately. Suppose the measurement outcome is binary (e.g., spin up, spin down). Suppose the two particles are perfectly anti-correlated\u2014in the sense that whenever both measured in the same direction, one gets identically opposite outcomes, when both measured in opposite directions they always give the same outcome. The only way to imagine how this works is that both particles leave their common source with, somehow, the outcomes they will deliver when measured in any possible direction. (How else could particle 1 know how to deliver the same answer as particle 2 when measured in the same direction? They don't know in advance how they are going to be measured...). The measurement on particle 2 (after switching its sign) can be thought of as telling us what the same measurement on particle 1 would have given.\n\nStart with one setting exactly opposite to the other. All the pairs of particles give the same outcome (each pair is either both spin up or both spin down). Now shift Alice's setting by one degree relative to Bob's. They are now one degree off being exactly opposite to one another. A small fraction of the pairs, say ''f'', now give different outcomes. If instead we had left Alice's setting unchanged but shifted Bob's by one degree (in the opposite direction), then again a fraction ''f'' of the pairs of particles turns out to give different outcomes. Finally consider what happens when both shifts are implemented at the same time: the two settings are now exactly two degrees away from being opposite to one another. By the mismatch argument, the chance of a mismatch at two degrees can't be more than twice the chance of a mismatch at one degree: it cannot be more than 2''f''.\n\nCompare this with the predictions from quantum mechanics for the singlet state. For a small angle {{mvar|\u03b8}}, measured in radians, the chance of a different outcome is approximately <math>f_1=\\theta^2/4</math> as explained by [[small-angle approximation]]. At two times this small angle, the chance of a mismatch is therefore about 4 times larger, since <math>f_2=(2\\theta)^2/4=2^2 \\theta^2/4 \\approx 4f_1</math>. But we just argued that it cannot be more than 2 times as large.\n\nThis intuitive formulation is due to [[David Mermin]]. The small-angle limit is discussed in Bell's original article, and therefore goes right back to the origin of the Bell inequalities.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===CHSH inequality===\n{{Main|CHSH inequality}}\nGeneralizing Bell's original inequality,<ref name=Bell1964/> [[John Clauser]], Michael Horne, [[Abner Shimony]] and R.

However, before the discovery of quantum mechanics, both realism and locality were completely uncontroversial features of physical theories.\n\n====Quantum mechanical predictions violate CHSH inequalities====\nThe measurements performed by Alice and Bob are spin measurements on electrons. Alice can choose between two detector settings labeled <math>a</math> and <math>a'</math>; these settings correspond to measurement of spin along the <math>z</math> or the ''<math>x</math>'' axis. Bob can choose between two detector settings labeled ''<math>b</math>'' and <math>b'</math>; these correspond to measurement of spin along the <math>z'</math> or <math>x'</math> axis, where the <math>x'-z'</math> coordinate system is rotated 135\u00b0 relative to the <math>x-z</math> coordinate system.  The spin observables are represented by the 2 \u00d7 2 self-adjoint matrices:\n\n:<math> S_x = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 &  0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad S_z = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nThese are the [[Pauli spin matrix|Pauli spin matrices]], which are known to have eigenvalues equal to <math>\\pm 1</math>. As is customary, we will use [[bra\u2013ket notation]] to denote the eigenvectors of <math>S_z</math> as <math>|0\\rangle,|1\\rangle</math>, where<math display=\"block\">|0\\rangle\\equiv\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix},\n\\qquad\n|1\\rangle\\equiv\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}.</math>Consider now the single state <math>|\\Phi^-\\rangle</math> defined as <math display=\"block\">|\\Phi^-\\rangle\\equiv\\frac{1}{\\sqrt2}\\left(|0,1\\rangle-|1,0\\rangle\\right),</math>where we used the shortened notation <math>|0,1\\rangle\\equiv|0\\rangle\\otimes|1\\rangle,\n|1,0\\rangle\\equiv|1\\rangle\\otimes|0\\rangle.</math>\n\nAccording to quantum mechanics, the choice of measurements is encoded into the choice of Hermitian operators applied to this state. In particular, consider the following operators:\n\n: <math display=\"block\">\\begin{align}\n  A(a)  &= S_z \\otimes I\\\\\n  A(a') &= S_x \\otimes I\\\\\n  B(b)  &= \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\ I \\otimes (S_z + S_x)\\\\\n  B(b') &=  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\ I \\otimes (S_z - S_x),\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere <math>A(a),A(a')</math> represent two measurement choices of Alice, and <math>B(b),B(b')</math> two measurement choices of Bob.\n\nTo obtain the expectation value given by a given measurement choice of Alice and Bob, one has to compute the expectation value of the corresponding pair of operators (for example, <math>A(a)B(b)</math> if the inputs are chosen to be <math>a, b</math>) over the shared state <math>|\\Phi^-\\rangle</math>.\n\nFor example, the expectation value <math>\\langle A(a)B(b)\\rangle</math> corresponding to Alice choosing the measurement setting <math>a</math> and Bob choosing the measurement setting <math>b</math> is computed as<math display=\"block\">\\langle A(a)B(b)\\rangle \\equiv \\langle \\Phi^-|\\left(\\frac{-1}{\\sqrt2}S_z\\otimes(S_x+S_z) \\right)\n|\\Phi^-\\rangle =\n-\\frac{1}{2}\\langle\\Phi^-|\\Big[|0\\rangle\\otimes(|0\\rangle-|1\\rangle)+|1\\rangle\\otimes(|1\\rangle+|0\\rangle)\\Big]\n=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt2}.</math>Similar computations are used to obtain<math display=\"block\">\\begin{align}\n  \\left\\langle A(a) B(b) \\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle A(a') B(b) \\right\\rangle =\n    \\left\\langle A(a') B(b') \\right\\rangle &=  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\n                \\left\\langle A(a) B(b') \\right\\rangle &= -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\end{align}</math>It follows that the value of <math>S</math> given by this particular experimental arrangement is\n\n:<math>\n  \\left\\langle A(a) B(b) \\right\\rangle + \\left\\langle A(a') B(b') \\right\\rangle +\n  \\left\\langle A\\left(a'\\right) B(b) \\right\\rangle - \\left\\langle A(a) B(b') \\right\\rangle =\n    \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{2}} = 2\\sqrt{2} > 2.\n</math>\n\nBell's Theorem: If the quantum mechanical formalism is correct, then the system consisting of a pair of entangled electrons cannot satisfy the principle of local realism.

Each photon encounters a two-channel polariser whose orientation (a or b) can be set by the experimenter.

The quantum state of the pair of entangled photons is not the singlet state, and the correspondence between angles and outcomes is different from that in the spin-half set-up. The polarization of a photon is measured in a pair of perpendicular directions. Relative to a given orientation, polarization is either vertical (denoted by V or by +) or horizontal (denoted by H or by -). The photon pairs are generated in the quantum state\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left (|V\\rangle\\otimes |V\\rangle+|H\\rangle\\otimes|H\\rangle \\right)</math>\n\nwhere <math>|V\\rangle</math> and <math>|H\\rangle</math> denotes the state of a single vertically or horizontally polarized photon, respectively (relative to a fixed and common reference direction for both particles).\n\nWhen the polarization of both photons is measured in the same direction, both give the same outcome: perfect correlation. When measured at directions making an angle 45\u00b0 with one another, the outcomes are completely random (uncorrelated). Measuring at directions at 90\u00b0 to one another, the two are perfectly anti-correlated. In general, when the polarizers are at an angle {{mvar|\u03b8}} to one another, the correlation is {{math|cos(2''\u03b8'')}}. So relative to the correlation function for the singlet state of spin half particles, we have a positive rather than a negative cosine function, and angles are halved: the correlation is periodic with period {{mvar|\u03c0}} instead of {{math|2''\u03c0''}}.\n\nBell's inequalities are tested by \"coincidence counts\" from a Bell test experiment such as the optical one shown in the diagram.  Pairs of particles are emitted as a result of a quantum process, analysed with respect to some key property such as polarisation direction, then detected.  The setting (orientations) of the analysers are selected by the experimenter.\n\nBell test experiments to date overwhelmingly violate Bell's inequality.\n\n===Two classes of Bell inequalities===\nThe [[Loopholes in Bell test experiments#Detection efficiency, or fair sampling|fair sampling problem]] was faced openly in the 1970s. In early designs of their 1973 experiment, Freedman and Clauser<ref name=\"Clauser\u2013Freedman\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.28.938 |title=Experimental Test of Local Hidden-Variable Theories |year=1972 |last1=Freedman |first1=Stuart J. |last2=Clauser |first2=John F. |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=28 |issue=14 |pages=938\u2013941|bibcode = 1972PhRvL..28..938F |url= http://dieumsnh.qfb.umich.mx/archivoshistoricosMQ/ModernaHist/Freedman.pdf }}</ref> used ''fair sampling'' in the form of the Clauser\u2013Horne\u2013Shimony\u2013Holt (CHSH<ref name=\"Clauser 1969\"/>) hypothesis. However, shortly afterwards Clauser and Horne<ref name=\"Clauser\u2013Horne\"/>  made the important distinction between inhomogeneous (IBI) and homogeneous (HBI) Bell inequalities. Testing an IBI requires that we compare certain coincidence rates in two separated detectors with the singles rates of the two detectors. Nobody needed to perform the experiment, because singles rates with all detectors in the 1970s were at least ten times all the coincidence rates. So, taking into account this low detector efficiency, the QM prediction actually satisfied the IBI. To arrive at an experimental design in which the QM prediction violates IBI we require detectors whose efficiency exceeds 82.8% for singlet states,<ref name=\"Garg & Mermin, 1987\">{{citation |author1=Anupam Garg |author2=N.D.

This is now within reach.\n\n===Practical challenges===\n{{Main|Loopholes in Bell test experiments}}\n\nBecause, at that time, even the best detectors didn't detect a large fraction of all photons, Clauser and Horne<ref name=\"Clauser\u2013Horne\"/> recognized that testing Bell's inequality required some extra assumptions. They introduced the ''No Enhancement Hypothesis'' (NEH):\n\n{{quote|A light signal, originating in an [[atomic cascade]] for example, has a certain probability of activating a detector.  Then, if a polarizer is interposed between the cascade and the detector, the detection probability cannot increase.}}\n\nGiven this assumption, there is a Bell inequality between the coincidence rates with polarizers and coincidence rates without polarizers.\n\nThe experiment was performed by Freedman and Clauser,<ref name=\"Clauser\u2013Freedman\"/> who found that the Bell's inequality was violated. So the no-enhancement hypothesis cannot be true in a local hidden variables model.\n\nWhile early experiments used atomic cascades,  later experiments have used parametric down-conversion, following a suggestion by Reid and Walls,<ref>{{cite journal|author1-link=Margaret D. Reid |first1=M. D. |last1=Reid |first2=D. F. |last2=Walls |title= Violations of classical inequalities in quantum optics|journal=[[Physical Review A]]|volume=34|issue=2 |pages=1260\u20131276|year=1986|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.34.1260|bibcode = 1986PhRvA..34.1260R }}</ref> giving improved generation and detection properties. As a result, recent experiments with photons no longer have to suffer from the detection loophole. This made the photon the first experimental system for which all main experimental loopholes were surmounted, although at first only in separate experiments. From 2015, experimentalists were able to surmount all the main experimental loopholes simultaneously; see [[Bell test experiments]].\n\n== Interpretations of Bell's theorem ==\n\n=== Non-local hidden variables ===\n\nMost advocates of the hidden-variables idea believe that experiments have ruled out local hidden variables.  They are ready to give up locality, explaining the violation of Bell's inequality by means of a non-local [[hidden variable theory]], in which the particles exchange information about their states. This is the basis of the [[Bohm interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, which requires that all particles in the universe be able to instantaneously exchange information with all others. A 2007 experiment ruled out a large class of non-Bohmian non-local hidden variable theories.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature05677 |title=An experimental test of non-local realism |year=2007 |last1=Gr\u00f6blacher |first1=Simon |last2=Paterek |first2=Tomasz |last3=Kaltenbaek |first3=Rainer |last4=Brukner |first4=\u010caslav |last5=\u017bukowski |first5=Marek |last6=Aspelmeyer |first6=Markus |last7=Zeilinger |first7=Anton |journal=Nature |volume=446 |issue=7138 |pages=871\u20135 |pmid=17443179|bibcode = 2007Natur.446..871G | arxiv= 0704.2529 }}</ref>\n\n===Transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics===\n\nIf the hidden variables can communicate with each other faster than light, Bell's inequality can easily be violated. Once one particle is measured, it can communicate the necessary correlations to the other particle. Since in relativity the notion of simultaneity is not absolute, this is unattractive. One idea is to replace instantaneous communication with a process that travels backwards in time along the past [[light cone]]. This is the idea behind a [[transactional interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, which interprets the statistical emergence of a quantum history as a gradual coming to agreement between histories that go both forward and backward in time.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.58.647|title=The transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics|year=1986|last1=Cramer|first1=John|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics| volume=58| issue=3| pages=647\u2013687| bibcode = 1986RvMP...58..647C }}</ref>\n\n=== Many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics ===\n\nThe [[Many-Worlds interpretation]] is local and deterministic, as it consists of the unitary part of quantum mechanics without collapse. It can generate correlations that violate a Bell inequality because it doesn't satisfy the implicit assumption that Bell made that measurements have a single outcome. In fact, Bell's theorem can be proven in the Many-Worlds framework from the assumption that a measurement has a single outcome. Therefore a violation of a Bell inequality can be interpreted as a demonstration that measurements have multiple outcomes.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=David Deutsch |author2=Patrick Hayden |title=Information flow in entangled quantum systems |journal=Proceedigs of the Royal Society A |date=200 |volume=456 |pages=1759{1774 |doi=10.1098/rspa.2000.0585|arxiv=quant-ph/9906007}}</ref>\n\nThe explanation it provides for the Bell correlations is that when Alice and Bob make their measurements, they split into local branches. From the point of view of each copy of Alice, there are multiple copies of Bob experiencing different results, so Bob cannot have a definite result, and the same is true from the point of view of each copy of Bob. They will obtain a mutually well-defined result only when their future light cones overlap. At this point we can say that the Bell correlation starts existing, but it was produced by a purely local mechanism. Therefore the violation of a Bell inequality cannot be interpreted as a proof of non-locality.<ref>{{Cite book|author1=Harvey R. Brown|author2 = Christopher G.

It only applies to a certain class of local hidden variable theories.  In fact, it might have just missed the kind of hidden variable theories that Einstein is most interested in.\n\n[[Richard D. Gill]] claimed that Jaynes misunderstood Bell's analysis. Gill points out that in the same conference volume in which Jaynes argues against Bell, Jaynes confesses to being extremely impressed by a short proof by [[Steve Gull]] presented at the same conference, that the singlet correlations could not be reproduced by a computer simulation of a local hidden variables theory.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Time, Finite Statistics, and Bell's Fifth Position |year=2003 |last1=Gill |first1=Richard D. |journal=Proc.

The Bell violations show that no resolution of such issues can avoid the ultimate strangeness of quantum behavior.<ref>{{cite book |first=E. |last=Abers |title=Quantum Mechanics |edition= |pages=193\u2013195 |year=2004 |publisher=Addison Wesley |isbn=9780131461000}}</ref>\n\nThe EPR paper \"pinpointed\" the unusual properties of the ''entangled states'', e.g. the above-mentioned singlet state, which is the foundation for present-day applications of quantum physics, such as [[quantum cryptography]]; one application involves the measurement of quantum entanglement as a physical source of bits for [[Michael O. Rabin|Rabin's]] [[oblivious transfer]] protocol. This non-locality was originally supposed to be illusory, because the standard interpretation could easily do away with action-at-a-distance by simply assigning to each particle definite spin-states for all possible spin directions. The EPR argument was: therefore these definite states exist, therefore quantum theory is incomplete in the EPR sense, since they do not appear in the theory. Bell's theorem showed that the \"entangledness\" prediction of quantum mechanics has a degree of non-locality that cannot be explained away by any classical theory of local hidden variables.\n\nWhat is powerful about Bell's theorem is that it doesn't refer to any particular theory of local hidden variables. It shows that nature violates the most general assumptions behind classical pictures, not just details of some particular models. No combination of local deterministic and local random hidden variables can reproduce the phenomena predicted by quantum mechanics and repeatedly observed in experiments.<ref>{{cite book | author1 = R.G.

based in [[Ratchaburi Province]] and currently plays in [[Thai League 1]].
