In 1902, when he was 16 years old, his family migrated west by [[covered wagon]] along the [[Oregon Trail]], settling in California. It did not take long after this for his long record of run-ins with the law to begin; early that decade, he was arrested and jailed in [[Modesto, California|Modesto]] for a minor robbery.<ref name=\"Enterprise legend\" />\n\nIn 1909 Wright married Goldie Fay Coolidge, a relative of [[Calvin Coolidge]], who would later serve as [[President of the United States]].<ref name=\"Record-Courier\" /><ref name=\"Record family\" /> Marriage did not dampen his inclination for crime. Later that year, he was convicted of second-degree burglary and sentenced to 18 months in the infamous [[Folsom State Prison]]. Upon release he reunited with his wife, and the couple produced four children: Goldie Ina, Edwin, Glenn, and Norman.<ref name=\"Record family\" /> In 1916, needing steady income to support his wife and children but struggling to find work due to his rap sheet, he enlisted in the [[U.S. Army]].<ref name=\"Record-Courier\" /> A year later, due to financial strains and Edwin's long absences while on Army service, the couple separated, and Goldie moved with the children to [[Stockton, California|Stockton]].<ref name=\"Record-Courier\" /><ref name=\"Record family\" /> After the couple's separation, Wright moved to the Sierra Nevada mountains, where he soon found work as a [[cowboy]] and [[prospecting|prospector]].<ref name=\"Record-Courier\" /> Upon the arrival of the [[Selective Service Act of 1917|World War 1 draft]], Wright registered as \"Monte Wolfe\" &ndash; his first known use of the name he would keep for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"Record-Courier\" />\n\n==Life in the Sierras==\n\nIn the Sierras, Wolfe worked a number of jobs to earn the income he needed, including trapping, prospecting, and working as a fishing guide. At this point, he had not yet withdrawn from wider society altogether. That would change in 1927, when Wolfe had another run-in with law enforcement &ndash; he was arrested for [[felony]] burglary and spent 75 days in a [[Tuolumne County, California|Tuolumne County]] jail. In his trial that took place after this delay, the [[jury]] found Wolfe not guilty; however, upon acquittal, the county sheriff drove him to the city of [[Angels Camp]] in nearby [[Calaveras County]], \"unceremoniously dumped\" him there, and told him to never again set foot in Tuolumne County.<ref name=\"Enterprise legend\" />\n\nAccording to historian Eric Jung, this series of events made Wolfe \"finally decide &lsquo;I've had enough of people&rsquo;,\" and for the rest of his life he would live off the land deep inside the rugged Sierras.<ref name=\"Enterprise legend\" /> Wolfe built himself two log cabins. The first cabin was destroyed by [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] workers sometime before 2009. The second cabin remains standing to this day.<ref name=\"Enterprise legend\" />\n\n==Disappearance==\n\nOne day late in the spring of 1940, three of Wolfe's friends &ndash; the brothers Art, Harry, and Reuben Schimke &ndash; set out to visit Wolfe in his cabin. Upon their arrival, they found the cabin empty, and could not find Wolfe. The last date crossed off on his calendar had been April 20 &ndash; his birthday &ndash; of that same year. It is unknown what caused Wolfe's disappearance and presumed death, but the surviving Schimke brothers believe it was unintentional. Wolfe had been suffering from some chronic health problems, which could have made him more likely to fall victim to an accident.<ref name=\"Enterprise legend\" />\n\n==Cabin preservation dispute==\n\nMonte Wolfe's cabin, one of the last surviving pioneer structures in California built by one person entirely by hand, has become embroiled in a dispute between wilderness protection and historic preservation. After passage of the [[Wilderness Act]] of 1964, the ground upon which the cabin sits became part of the newly designated [[Mokelumne Wilderness]]. Wilderness area regulations generally prohibit the maintenance or construction of any buildings or structures not necessary to patrolling and maintaining the wilderness itself. As a result, rangers have at times sought to speed up the natural decay of the cabin, while preservationists have attempted to maintain it. The two groups at one point reached an agreement to leave the cabin as is in a state of \"arrested decay\", but both sides have accused the other side of violating this agreement.\n\n<!--==Notes==\n{{notelist|refs=\n{{efn|name=spelling|Spelled \"Archie Wright\" in some sources.}}\n}}-->==References==\n<references>\n<ref name=\"Record-Courier\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.recordcourier.com/news/local/grand-opening-at-the-alpine-county-museum/|publisher=[[Record-Courier (Nevada)|The Record-Courier]]|title=Grand opening at the Alpine County museum|author=Virginia York|date=June 3, 2010|accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Record family\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.recordnet.com/article/20090727/A_NEWS/907270305|publisher=[[The Record (Stockton, California)|The Record]]|title=Turns out Monte Wolfe had a family|date=July 27, 2009|access-date=April 17, 2020|author=Alex Breitler}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Enterprise\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.calaverasenterprise.com/news/article_6225002c-50b1-50b4-86fa-b67a5794e9d6.html|publisher=[[Calaveras Enterprise]]|title=Remote cabin triggers heated controversy|access-date=April 17, 2020}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Enterprise legend\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.calaverasenterprise.com/news/article_8865e579-f08e-5915-94c3-86d4508a6342.html|publisher=[[Calaveras Enterprise]]|title=Looking for a legend|access-date=April 17, 2020}}</ref>\n</references>\n\n[[Category: People from North Dakota]]\n[[Category: People from California]]\n[[Category: People from Alpine County, California]]\n[[Category: 1886 births]]\n[[Category: 1940 deaths]]\n[[Category: Mountain men]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wolfe, Monte}}\n", "text_old": "<!-- This article uses [[WP:LDR|list-defined references]].

It is unknown what caused Wolfe's disappearance and presumed death, but the surviving Schimke brothers believe it was unintentional. Wolfe had been suffering from some chronic health problems, which could have made him more likely to fall victim to an accident.<ref name=\"Enterprise legend />\n\n==Cabin preservation dispute==\n\nMonte Wolfe's cabin, one of the last surviving pioneer structures in California built by one person entirely by hand, has become embroiled in a dispute between wilderness protection and historic preservation. After passage of the [[Wilderness Act]] of 1964, the ground upon which the cabin sits became part of the newly designated [[Mokelumne Wilderness]]. Wilderness area regulations generally prohibit the maintenance or construction of any buildings or structures not necessary to patrolling and maintaining the wilderness itself. As a result, rangers have at times sought to speed up the natural decay of the cabin, while preservationists have attempted to maintain it. The two groups at one point reached an agreement to leave the cabin as is in a state of \"arrested decay\", but both sides have accused the other side of violating this agreement.\n\n<!--==Notes==\n{{notelist|refs=\n{{efn|name=spelling|Spelled \"Archie Wright\" in some sources.}}\n}}-->==References==\n<references>\n<ref name=\"Record-Courier\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.recordcourier.com/news/local/grand-opening-at-the-alpine-county-museum/|publisher=[[Record-Courier (Nevada)|The Record-Courier]]|title=Grand opening at the Alpine County museum|author=Virginia York|date=June 3, 2010|accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Record family\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.recordnet.com/article/20090727/A_NEWS/907270305|publisher=[[The Record (Stockton, California)|The Record]]|title=Turns out Monte Wolfe had a family|date=July 27, 2009|access-date=April 17, 2020|author=Alex Breitler}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Enterprise\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.calaverasenterprise.com/news/article_6225002c-50b1-50b4-86fa-b67a5794e9d6.html|publisher=[[Calaveras Enterprise]]|title=Remote cabin triggers heated controversy|access-date=April 17, 2020}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Enterprise legend\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.calaverasenterprise.com/news/article_8865e579-f08e-5915-94c3-86d4508a6342.html|publisher=[[Calaveras Enterprise]]|title=Looking for a legend|access-date=April 17, 2020}}</ref>\n</references>\n\n[[Category: People from North Dakota]]\n[[Category: People from California]]\n[[Category: People from Alpine County, California]]\n[[Category: 1886 births]]\n[[Category: 1940 deaths]]\n[[Category: Mountain men]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wolfe, Monte}}\n", "name_user": "G\u00fcnniX", "label": "safe", "comment": "v2.02 -WP:WCWproject (Unbalanced quotes in ref name or illegal character.)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Wolfe"}

Precipitation occurs when a portion of the atmosphere becomes saturated with water vapor (reaching 100% [[relative humidity]]), so that the water condenses and \"precipitates\".  Thus, fog and mist are not precipitation but suspensions, because the water vapor does not condense sufficiently to precipitate.  Two processes, possibly acting together, can lead to air becoming saturated: cooling the air or adding water vapor to the air. Precipitation forms as smaller droplets coalesce via collision with other rain drops or ice crystals within a cloud.  Short, intense periods of rain in scattered locations are called \"showers.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=What's the difference between 'rain' and 'showers'? |date=December 26, 2015 |author=Scott Sistek\n|publisher=[[KOMO-TV]]\n|url=http://komonews.com/weather/faq/whats-the-difference-between-rain-and-showers |accessdate=January 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\nMoisture that is lifted or otherwise forced to rise over a layer of sub-freezing air at the surface may be condensed into clouds and rain. This process is typically active when freezing rain occurs. A [[stationary front]] is often present near the area of freezing rain and serves as the focus for forcing and rising air. Provided necessary and sufficient atmospheric moisture content, the moisture within the rising air will condense into clouds, namely [[Stratus cloud|stratus]] and [[cumulonimbus]]. Eventually, the cloud droplets will grow large enough to form raindrops and descend toward the Earth where they will freeze on contact with exposed objects.  Where relatively warm water bodies are present, for example due to water evaporation from lakes, [[lake-effect snow]]fall becomes a concern downwind of the warm lakes within the cold [[cyclone|cyclonic]] flow around the backside of [[extratropical cyclone]]s.  Lake-effect snowfall can be locally heavy.  [[Thundersnow]] is possible within a cyclone's [[Extratropical cyclone#Surface pressure and wind distribution|comma head]] and within lake effect precipitation bands.  In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within [[windward]] sides of the terrain at elevation.

This is equivalent to the unit liters per square meter (L/m<sup>2</sup>) if assuming that 1 liter of water has a mass of 1 kg, which is acceptable for most practical purposes. Rainfall is sometimes, but rarely, expressed in centimeters (cm).{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} The corresponding English unit used is usually inches. In Australia before metrication, rainfall was measured in \"points\" which were defined as a hundredth of an inch.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n;Solid precipitation: A [[snow gauge]] is usually used to measure the amount of solid precipitation. Snowfall is usually measured in centimeters by letting snow fall into a container and then measure the height. The snow can then optionally be melted to obtain a [[Snow water equivalent|water equivalent]] measurement in millimeters like for liquid precipitation. The relationship between snow height and water equivalent depends on the water content of the snow; the water equivalent can thus only provide a rough estimate of snow depth. Other forms of solid precipitation, such as snow pellets and hail or even sleet (rain and snow mixed), can also be melted and measured as water equivalent, usually expressed millimeters like for liquid precipitation.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==How the air becomes saturated==\n\n===Cooling air to its dew point===\n[[File:Regnbyge.jpg|thumb|Late-summer rainstorm in Denmark]]\n[[File:Lenticular Cloud in Wyoming 0034b.jpg|thumb|Lenticular cloud forming due to mountains over Wyoming]]\nThe [[dew point]] is the temperature to which a parcel of air must be cooled in order to become saturated, and (unless super-saturation occurs) condenses to water.<ref>{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=dewpoint1|title=Dewpoint|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=2011-01-31|url-status=dead|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110705162052/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=dewpoint1|archivedate=2011-07-05}}</ref>  Water vapor normally begins to condense on [[Cloud condensation nuclei|condensation nuclei]] such as dust, ice, and salt in order to form clouds.

Once a droplet has frozen, it grows in the [[supersaturation|supersaturated]] environment. Because water droplets are more numerous than the ice crystals the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of micrometers in size at the expense of the water droplets.  This process is known as the [[Wegener\u2013Bergeron\u2013Findeisen process]].  The corresponding depletion of water vapor causes the droplets to evaporate, meaning that the ice crystals grow at the droplets' expense.  These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation, since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass, and may collide and stick together in clusters, or aggregates.  These aggregates are snowflakes, and are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground.<ref name=\"natgeojan07\">{{cite journal | author=M.

Those bands bring strong localized snowfall which can be understood as follows: Large water bodies such as lakes efficiently store heat that results in significant temperature differences (larger than 13&nbsp;\u00b0C or 23&nbsp;\u00b0F) between the water surface and the air above.<ref>{{cite news |author=B.

Any particulates of liquid or solid water in the atmosphere are known as hydrometeors.  Formations due to condensation, such as clouds, [[haze]], fog, and mist, are composed of hydrometeors.  All precipitation types are made up of hydrometeors by definition, including virga, which is precipitation which evaporates before reaching the ground.  Particles blown from the Earth's surface by wind, such as blowing snow and blowing sea spray, are also hydrometeors, as are hail and snow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Hydrometeor|author=Glossary of Meteorology|title=Hydrometeor|year=2009|accessdate=2009-07-16|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]}}</ref>\n\n===Satellite estimates===\nAlthough surface precipitation gauges are considered the standard for measuring precipitation, there are many areas in which their use is not feasible. This includes the vast expanses of ocean and remote land areas. In other cases, social, technical or administrative issues prevent the dissemination of gauge observations. As a result, the modern global record of precipitation largely depends on satellite observations.<ref>{{cite web|author=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|year=2012|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GPM/news/overview.html#.Ut3LEnn0CqQ|title=NASA and JAXA's GPM Mission Takes Rain Measurements Global|accessdate=2014-01-21|author-link=National Aeronautics and Space Administration}}</ref>\n\nSatellite sensors work by remotely sensing precipitation\u2014recording various parts of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] that theory and practice show are related to the occurrence and intensity of precipitation. The sensors are almost exclusively passive, recording what they see, similar to a camera, in contrast to active sensors ([[radar]], [[lidar]]) that send out a signal and detect its impact on the area being observed.\n\nSatellite sensors now in practical use for precipitation fall into two categories. Thermal [[infrared]] (IR) sensors record a channel around 11 micron wavelength and primarily give information about cloud tops. Due to the typical structure of the atmosphere, cloud-top temperatures are approximately inversely related to cloud-top heights, meaning colder clouds almost always occur at higher altitudes. Further, cloud tops with a lot of small-scale variation are likely to be more vigorous than smooth-topped clouds. Various mathematical schemes, or algorithms, use these and other properties to estimate precipitation from the IR data.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Global Precipitation Measurement|author1=C. Kidd |author2=G.J. Huffman |journal=[[Meteorological Applications]]|volume=18|issue=3 |year=2011|pages=334\u2013353|doi=10.1002/met.284|bibcode = 2011MeApp..18..334K }}</ref>\n\nThe second category of sensor channels is in the [[microwave]] part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The frequencies in use range from about 10 gigahertz  to a few hundred GHz. Channels up to about 37&nbsp;GHz primarily provide information on the liquid hydrometeors (rain and drizzle) in the lower parts of clouds, with larger amounts of liquid emitting higher amounts of microwave radiant energy. Channels above 37&nbsp;GHz display emission signals, but are dominated by the action of solid hydrometeors (snow, graupel, etc.) to scatter microwave radiant energy. Satellites such as the [[Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission]] (TRMM) and the [[Global Precipitation Measurement]] (GPM) mission employ microwave sensors to form precipitation estimates.\n\nAdditional sensor channels and products have been demonstrated to provide additional useful information including visible channels, additional IR channels, water vapor channels and atmospheric sounding retrievals. However, most precipitation data sets in current use do not employ these data sources.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Global Precipitation Measurement Methods, Datasets and Applications.|author=F.J. Tapiador|display-authors=etal|journal=Atmospheric Research|volume=104\u2013105|year=2012|pages=70\u201397|doi=10.1016/j.atmosres.2011.10.012|bibcode = 2013AtmRe.119..131W }}</ref>\n\n===Satellite data sets===\nThe IR estimates have rather low skill at short time and space scales, but are available very frequently (15 minutes or more often) from satellites in [[geosynchronous]] Earth orbit. IR works best in cases of deep, vigorous convection\u2014such as the tropics\u2014and becomes progressively less useful in areas where stratiform (layered) precipitation dominates, especially in mid- and high-latitude regions. The more-direct physical connection between hydrometeors and microwave channels gives the microwave estimates greater skill on short time and space scales than is true for IR. However, microwave sensors fly only on low Earth orbit satellites, and there are few enough of them that the average time between observations exceeds three hours. This several-hour interval is insufficient to adequately document precipitation because of the transient nature of most precipitation systems as well as the inability of a single satellite to appropriately capture the typical daily cycle of precipitation at a given location.\n\nSince the late 1990s, several algorithms have been developed to combine precipitation data from multiple satellites' sensors, seeking to emphasize the strengths and minimize the weaknesses of the individual input data sets. The goal is to provide \"best\" estimates of precipitation on a uniform time/space grid, usually for as much of the globe as possible. In some cases the long-term homogeneity of the dataset is emphasized, which is the [[Climate Data Record]] standard.\n\nIn other cases, the goal is producing the best instantaneous satellite estimate, which is the High Resolution Precipitation Product approach. In either case, of course, the less-emphasized goal is also considered desirable. One key result of the multi-satellite studies is that including even a small amount of surface gauge data is very useful for controlling the biases that are endemic to satellite estimates. The difficulties in using gauge data are that 1) their availability is limited, as noted above, and 2) the best analyses of gauge data take two months or more after the observation time to undergo the necessary transmission, assembly, processing and quality control. Thus, precipitation estimates that include gauge data tend to be produced further after the observation time than the no-gauge estimates. As a result, while estimates that include gauge data may provide a more accurate depiction of the \"true\" precipitation, they are generally not suited for real- or near-real-time applications.\n\nThe work described has resulted in a variety of datasets possessing different formats, time/space grids, periods of record and regions of coverage, input datasets, and analysis procedures, as well as many different forms of dataset version designators.<ref>{{cite web|author=International Precipitation Working Group|url=http://www.isac.cnr.it/~ipwg/data/datasets.html|title=Global Precipitation Datasets|accessdate=2014-01-21|author-link=International Precipitation Working Group}}</ref> In many cases, one of the modern multi-satellite data sets is the best choice for general use.\n\n==Return period==\n{{see also|100-year flood}}\nThe likelihood or probability of an event with a specified intensity and duration, is called the [[return period]] or frequency.<ref>{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=return-period1|title=Return period|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=2009-01-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020151220/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=return-period1|archivedate=2006-10-20}}</ref> The intensity of a storm can be predicted for any return period and storm duration, from charts based on historic data for the location.<ref>{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&query=return+period&submit=Search|title=Rainfall intensity return period|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=2009-01-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606085617/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&query=return+period&submit=Search|archivedate=2011-06-06}}</ref>  The term ''1 in 10&nbsp;year storm'' describes a rainfall event which is rare and is only likely to occur once every 10&nbsp;years, so it has a 10&nbsp;percent likelihood any given year.

Precipitation occurs when a portion of the atmosphere becomes saturated with water vapor (reaching 100% [[relative humidity]]), so that the water condenses and \"precipitates\".  Thus, fog and mist are not precipitation but suspensions, because the water vapor does not condense sufficiently to precipitate.  Two processes, possibly acting together, can lead to air becoming saturated: cooling the air or adding water vapor to the air. Precipitation forms as smaller droplets coalesce via collision with other rain drops or ice crystals within a cloud.  Short, intense periods of rain in scattered locations are called \"showers.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=What's the difference between 'rain' and 'showers'? |date=December 26, 2015 |author=Scott Sistek\n|publisher=[[KOMO-TV]]\n|url=http://komonews.com/weather/faq/whats-the-difference-between-rain-and-showers |accessdate=January 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\nMoisture that is lifted or otherwise forced to rise over a layer of sub-freezing air at the surface may be condensed into clouds and rain. This process is typically active when freezing rain occurs. A [[stationary front]] is often present near the area of freezing rain and serves as the focus for forcing and rising air. Provided necessary and sufficient atmospheric moisture content, the moisture within the rising air will condense into clouds, namely [[Stratus cloud|stratus]] and [[cumulonimbus]]. Eventually, the cloud droplets will grow large enough to form raindrops and descend toward the Earth where they will freeze on contact with exposed objects.  Where relatively warm water bodies are present, for example due to water evaporation from lakes, [[lake-effect snow]]fall becomes a concern downwind of the warm lakes within the cold [[cyclone|cyclonic]] flow around the backside of [[extratropical cyclone]]s.  Lake-effect snowfall can be locally heavy.  [[Thundersnow]] is possible within a cyclone's [[Extratropical cyclone#Surface pressure and wind distribution|comma head]] and within lake effect precipitation bands.  In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within [[windward]] sides of the terrain at elevation.

This is equivalent to the unit liters per square meter (L/m<sup>2</sup>) if assuming that 1 liter of water has a mass of 1 kg, which is acceptable for most practical purposes. Rainfall is sometimes, but rarely, expressed in centimeters (cm).{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} The corresponding English unit used is usually inches. In Australia before metrication, rainfall was measured in \"points\" which were defined as a hundredth of an inch.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n;Solid precipitation: A [[snow gauge]] is usually used to measure the amount of solid precipitation. Snowfall is usually measured in centimeters by letting snow fall into a container and then measure the height. The snow can then optionally be melted to obtain a [[Snow water equivalent|water equivalent]] measurement in millimeters like for liquid precipitation. The relationship between snow height and water equivalent depends on the water content of the snow; the water equivalent can thus only provide a rough estimate of snow depth. Other forms of solid precipitation, such as snow pellets and hail or even sleet (rain and snow mixed), can also be melted and measured as water equivalent, usually expressed millimeters like for liquid precipitation.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==How the air becomes saturated==\n\n===Cooling air to its dew point===\n[[File:Regnbyge.jpg|thumb|Late-summer rainstorm in Denmark]]\n[[File:Lenticular Cloud in Wyoming 0034b.jpg|thumb|Lenticular cloud forming due to mountains over Wyoming]]\nThe [[dew point]] is the temperature to which a parcel of air must be cooled in order to become saturated, and (unless super-saturation occurs) condenses to water.<ref>{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=dewpoint1|title=Dewpoint|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=2011-01-31|url-status=dead|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110705162052/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=dewpoint1|archivedate=2011-07-05}}</ref>  Water vapor normally begins to condense on [[Cloud condensation nuclei|condensation nuclei]] such as dust, ice, and salt in order to form clouds.

Once a droplet has frozen, it grows in the [[supersaturation|supersaturated]] environment. Because water droplets are more numerous than the ice crystals the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of micrometers in size at the expense of the water droplets.  This process is known as the [[Wegener\u2013Bergeron\u2013Findeisen process]].  The corresponding depletion of water vapor causes the droplets to evaporate, meaning that the ice crystals grow at the droplets' expense.  These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation, since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass, and may collide and stick together in clusters, or aggregates.  These aggregates are snowflakes, and are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground.<ref name=\"natgeojan07\">{{cite journal | author=M.

Any particulates of liquid or solid water in the atmosphere are known as hydrometeors.  Formations due to condensation, such as clouds, [[haze]], fog, and mist, are composed of hydrometeors.  All precipitation types are made up of hydrometeors by definition, including virga, which is precipitation which evaporates before reaching the ground.  Particles blown from the Earth's surface by wind, such as blowing snow and blowing sea spray, are also hydrometeors, as are hail and snow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Hydrometeor|author=Glossary of Meteorology|title=Hydrometeor|year=2009|accessdate=2009-07-16|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]}}</ref>\n\n===Satellite estimates===\nAlthough surface precipitation gauges are considered the standard for measuring precipitation, there are many areas in which their use is not feasible. This includes the vast expanses of ocean and remote land areas. In other cases, social, technical or administrative issues prevent the dissemination of gauge observations. As a result, the modern global record of precipitation largely depends on satellite observations.<ref>{{cite web|author=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|year=2012|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GPM/news/overview.html#.Ut3LEnn0CqQ|title=NASA and JAXA's GPM Mission Takes Rain Measurements Global|accessdate=2014-01-21|author-link=National Aeronautics and Space Administration}}</ref>\n\nSatellite sensors work by remotely sensing precipitation\u2014recording various parts of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] that theory and practice show are related to the occurrence and intensity of precipitation. The sensors are almost exclusively passive, recording what they see, similar to a camera, in contrast to active sensors ([[radar]], [[lidar]]) that send out a signal and detect its impact on the area being observed.\n\nSatellite sensors now in practical use for precipitation fall into two categories. Thermal [[infrared]] (IR) sensors record a channel around 11 micron wavelength and primarily give information about cloud tops. Due to the typical structure of the atmosphere, cloud-top temperatures are approximately inversely related to cloud-top heights, meaning colder clouds almost always occur at higher altitudes. Further, cloud tops with a lot of small-scale variation are likely to be more vigorous than smooth-topped clouds. Various mathematical schemes, or algorithms, use these and other properties to estimate precipitation from the IR data.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Global Precipitation Measurement|author1=C. Kidd |author2=G.J. Huffman |journal=[[Meteorological Applications]]|volume=18|issue=3 |year=2011|pages=334\u2013353|doi=10.1002/met.284|bibcode = 2011MeApp..18..334K }}</ref>\n\nThe second category of sensor channels is in the [[microwave]] part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The frequencies in use range from about 10 gigahertz  to a few hundred GHz. Channels up to about 37&nbsp;GHz primarily provide information on the liquid hydrometeors (rain and drizzle) in the lower parts of clouds, with larger amounts of liquid emitting higher amounts of microwave radiant energy. Channels above 37&nbsp;GHz display emission signals, but are dominated by the action of solid hydrometeors (snow, graupel, etc.) to scatter microwave radiant energy. Satellites such as the [[Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission]] (TRMM) and the [[Global Precipitation Measurement]] (GPM) mission employ microwave sensors to form precipitation estimates.\n\nAdditional sensor channels and products have been demonstrated to provide additional useful information including visible channels, additional IR channels, water vapor channels and atmospheric sounding retrievals. However, most precipitation data sets in current use do not employ these data sources.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Global Precipitation Measurement Methods, Datasets and Applications.|author=F.J. Tapiador|display-authors=etal|journal=Atmospheric Research|volume=104\u2013105|year=2012|pages=70\u201397|doi=10.1016/j.atmosres.2011.10.012|bibcode = 2013AtmRe.119..131W }}</ref>\n\n===Satellite data sets===\nThe IR estimates have rather low skill at short time and space scales, but are available very frequently (15 minutes or more often) from satellites in [[geosynchronous]] Earth orbit. IR works best in cases of deep, vigorous convection\u2014such as the tropics\u2014and becomes progressively less useful in areas where stratiform (layered) precipitation dominates, especially in mid- and high-latitude regions. The more-direct physical connection between hydrometeors and microwave channels gives the microwave estimates greater skill on short time and space scales than is true for IR. However, microwave sensors fly only on low Earth orbit satellites, and there are few enough of them that the average time between observations exceeds three hours. This several-hour interval is insufficient to adequately document precipitation because of the transient nature of most precipitation systems as well as the inability of a single satellite to appropriately capture the typical daily cycle of precipitation at a given location.\n\nSince the late 1990s, several algorithms have been developed to combine precipitation data from multiple satellites' sensors, seeking to emphasize the strengths and minimize the weaknesses of the individual input data sets. The goal is to provide \"best\" estimates of precipitation on a uniform time/space grid, usually for as much of the globe as possible. In some cases the long-term homogeneity of the dataset is emphasized, which is the [[Climate Data Record]] standard.\n\nIn other cases, the goal is producing the best instantaneous satellite estimate, which is the High Resolution Precipitation Product approach. In either case, of course, the less-emphasized goal is also considered desirable. One key result of the multi-satellite studies is that including even a small amount of surface gauge data is very useful for controlling the biases that are endemic to satellite estimates. The difficulties in using gauge data are that 1) their availability is limited, as noted above, and 2) the best analyses of gauge data take two months or more after the observation time to undergo the necessary transmission, assembly, processing and quality control. Thus, precipitation estimates that include gauge data tend to be produced further after the observation time than the no-gauge estimates. As a result, while estimates that include gauge data may provide a more accurate depiction of the \"true\" precipitation, they are generally not suited for real- or near-real-time applications.\n\nThe work described has resulted in a variety of datasets possessing different formats, time/space grids, periods of record and regions of coverage, input datasets, and analysis procedures, as well as many different forms of dataset version designators.<ref>{{cite web|author=International Precipitation Working Group|url=http://www.isac.cnr.it/~ipwg/data/datasets.html|title=Global Precipitation Datasets|accessdate=2014-01-21|author-link=International Precipitation Working Group}}</ref> In many cases, one of the modern multi-satellite data sets is the best choice for general use.\n\n==Return period==\n{{see also|100-year flood}}\nThe likelihood or probability of an event with a specified intensity and duration, is called the [[return period]] or frequency.<ref>{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=return-period1|title=Return period|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=2009-01-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020151220/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=return-period1|archivedate=2006-10-20}}</ref> The intensity of a storm can be predicted for any return period and storm duration, from charts based on historic data for the location.<ref>{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&query=return+period&submit=Search|title=Rainfall intensity return period|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=2009-01-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606085617/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&query=return+period&submit=Search|archivedate=2011-06-06}}</ref>  The term ''1 in 10&nbsp;year storm'' describes a rainfall event which is rare and is only likely to occur once every 10&nbsp;years, so it has a 10&nbsp;percent likelihood any given year.

Precipitation has generally increased over land north of 30\u00b0N from 1900 to 2005 but has declined over the tropics since the 1970s.  Globally there has been no statistically significant overall trend in precipitation over the past century, although trends have varied widely by region and over time.  Eastern portions of North and South America, northern Europe, and northern and central Asia have become wetter.  The Sahel, the Mediterranean, southern Africa and parts of southern Asia have become drier.  There has been an increase in the number of heavy precipitation events over many areas during the past century, as well as an increase since the 1970s in the prevalence of droughts\u2014especially in the tropics and subtropics.  Changes in precipitation and evaporation over the oceans are suggested by the decreased salinity of mid- and high-latitude waters (implying more precipitation), along with increased salinity in lower latitudes (implying less precipitation, more evaporation, or both).  Over the contiguous United States, total annual precipitation increased at an average rate of 6.1% per century since 1900, with the greatest increases within the East North Central climate region (11.6% per century) and the South (11.1%). Hawaii was the only region to show a decrease (\u22129.25%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/science/recentpsc.html|title=Precipitation and Storm Changes|author=Climate Change Division|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=2008-12-17|accessdate=2009-07-17}}</ref>\n\n==Changes due to urban heat island==\n{{See also|Urban heat island}}\n[[File:Atlanta thermal.jpg|thumb|Image of [[Atlanta, Georgia]], showing temperature distribution, with hot areas appearing white]]\nThe [[urban heat island]] warms cities 0.6 to 5.6&nbsp;\u00b0C (1.1 to 10.1&nbsp;\u00b0F) above surrounding suburbs and rural areas.
