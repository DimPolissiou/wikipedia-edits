The film was produced and directed by [[Tinnu Anand]]. The story of the film was written by Amitabh Bachchan's wife [[Jaya Bachchan]] and the screenplay was written by veteran screenwriter [[Inder Raj Anand]], who died before the film was released. The film marked Bachchan's comeback to films after a three-year hiatus during which he had entered politics. Bachchan still had films releasing during the hiatus, as they were projects he had previously completed. The film became the second highest grossing film of 1988.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://muvyz.com/boxoffice/byyear/y3/1988|title=Box Office by Year - Top Grossing Movies of 1988|website=MuVyz|accessdate=12 April 2018}}</ref> It is remembered for the famous dialogue \"''Rishtey mein toh hum tumhare baap lagte hai...naam hai Shahenshah''\". The film is also remembered for Bachchan's  performance as a comic policeman and a crimefighting superhero. Meenakshi Sheshadri performance as the leading lady was also appreciated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cinestaan.com/articles/2018/nov/16/16829|title=5 memorable roles of Meenakshi Seshadri \u2013 Birthday special|last=Thombare|first=Suparna|website=Cinestaan|access-date=26 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA corrupt and sniveling bank manager Mathur ([[Prem Chopra]]) has illegally borrowed 2.5 million rupees and loaned them to crime baron J.K. Verma ([[Amrish Puri]]). J.K orchestrates a bank robbery to bail him out. Inspector Anand Shrivastav ([[Kader Khan]]) gets wind of this plot. He is about to crack the case when J.K. enlists an exotic dancer, Julie ([[Aruna Irani]]), to use the robbery as a backdrop and frame the honest inspector for corruption. Inspector Shrivastav is arrested and is imprisoned for three months. Inspector Shrivastav, the honest and innocent inspector, is so depressed about the false charges that he hangs himself at home after being released on bail. This creates a lasting and powerful impression on his young eight-year-old son, Vijaykumar. Vijay retains the noose his father used to hang himself. He vows someday restore his father's honour. Vijay and his mother leave their house and live in the house of another honest police inspector named Aslam Khan.\n\nYears later, a young Vijay ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]) in the inspector uniform,  grows up in the care of Inspector Aslam Khan ([[Pran (actor)|Pran]]), Inspector Shrivastav's friend and partner, who has allowed Vijay and his mother to live with him, and Vijay becomes a cop himself. Vijay is friends with Shaheena, the daughter of Aslam Khan. Aslam Khan is an honest cop much like Vijay's father. Vijay is an obsequious and cowardly inspector, prone to bribery and generally scared of powerful criminals. It doesn't take JK long to find Vijay, get him on the payroll, and run his underworld crime empire (drugs, guns, racketeering) past the cops.\n\nA new apparition bursts upon this scene who calls himself \"Shahenshah\", a costumed crime fighter (see movie poster). He has a left iron hand which is used to attack enemies and smash objects, and Shahenshah's other weapon is a noose. Oddly enough, it is the same noose Vijay's father used to hang himself with. This is because it is revealed later that Shahenshah is actually Vijay. When wearing Shahenshah's attire, Vijay describes himself as \"one who doesn't hold a cop's job but does the same work; one who apprehends criminals himself, conducts the trials himself, and, pronounces and executes the sentences himself\". So Vijay/Shahenshah's outward mission is to take out crime, but his real goal is to get to the guys who framed his father.\n\nShahenshah quietly breaks up several of J.K.'s gambling dens and illicit liquor distilleries. He also halts the demolition of a slum. This catches the eye of small-time trickster Shalu ([[Meenakshi Seshadri]]) who lives there with her aging and ailing mother Julie. J.K. had ordered her assassination after she helped frame Vijay's father; she has been on the run from him ever since, which becomes Shalu's motivation for seeking out and eliminating J.K. Shalu decides to infiltrate J.K.'s coterie by becoming an exotic dancer. One night, she attempts to kill J.K. by shooting him but is shocked when J.K. reveals he had been wearing a bullet-proof vest the whole time. Vijay lies to J.K. that Shahenshah's weakness is not letting Shalu die. He also lies that if J.K. returns Shalu to Shahenshah, Shahenshah will return J. K.'s goods worth millions. But J.K. is ultimately fooled. Shahenshah later detonates a bomb planted in J.K.'s truck. \n\nJ.K. murders an honest crime reporter Mohammed Salim ([[Vijayendra Ghatge]]), who was about to expose J.K.'s crime ring. Salim was married to Shaheena ([[Supriya Pathak]]), the daughter of Aslam Khan, and was also Vijay's brother-in-law. Vijay now decides to turn around his image as a cowardly cop. He openly defies J.K. Julie agrees to testify against J.K. Shalu provides ancillary evidence. And J.K. prepares for an all out war against Shahenshah/Vijay, Shalu and the lot of his enemies. At Salim's funeral, only one of the many witnesses of his death were present. He was about to reveal J.K.'s name, but a sharpshooter shoots him to death. \n\nThere is a veritable bloodbath on the streets as Inspector Vijay tries to get Julie into the courthouse. And there is a final showdown where Shahenshah reveals his secret identity and becomes the nemesis for all the culprits. To give himself a chance to escape, J.K. abducts Shalu. The showdown leads Vijay, dressed in Shahenshah's attire, chasing J.K. to the roof of the courthouse where J.K. is pleading his case, because his cover is blown. J.K. falls through a hole in the roof and is clinging on for dear life, with the whole court, judge sahab, audience and all looks on in astonishment. Vijay throws the noose down to J.K., and he gratefully accepts it. J.K., being the ruthless man that he is, attempts to attack Vijay. Vijay lets go of the noose, which slips around J.K.'s neck, and before the whole court, J.K. Verma is hanged, avenging Inspector Shrivastav and Salim the reporter, Shaheena's husband.\n\n== Cast ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Actor\n!Character in the movie\n!Notes\n|-\n| [[Amitabh Bachchan]]\n| Insp.

The story of ''Shahenshah'' was written by Amitabh's wife, Jaya Bachchan<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0080149 |title=Jaya Bhaduri - IMDb|accessdate=30 October 2015}}</ref> and further refined by Tinnu Anand's father Inder Raj Anand. Even though Anand signed up Bachchan in 1983, the film could not commence shooting because only three days before shooting was to begin in Bangalore, Amitabh fell seriously ill.<ref name=\"indiatoday_328860\">{{cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/release-of-amitabh-bachchan-film-shahenshah-delayed/1/328860.html |title=IndiaToday|accessdate=30 October 2015}}</ref> After a thorough medical examination it was revealed that he had developed myasthenia gravis, a rare chronic autoimmune disease marked by muscular weakness without atrophy.\n\nDue to Amitabh's illness and his commitments to other movies, the start of ''Shahenshah's'' shooting was delayed until 1985.<ref name=\"indiatoday_328860\"/> By this time, the main heroine of the film, [[Dimple Kapadia]], was replaced by [[Meenakshi Sheshadri]].<ref name=\"indiatoday_328860\"/> The now iconic costume that Amitabh donned in this movie weighed almost 18&nbsp;kg, and despite his illness, Amitabh insisted on wearing the costume in all of his fight scenes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/look/when-amitabh-almost-gave-up-acting/20121005.htm |title=Tinnu Anand Interview - Rediff|accessdate=30 October 2015}}</ref> During shooting, Amitabh and Tinnu got into a disagreement over one particular scene in which Tinnu wanted Amitabh to wear his police uniform but Amitabh insisted on wearing a blazer instead. The argument got quite heated and with neither of the two willing to change his stance, shooting was temporarily halted. It was not until Tinnu's father, Inder Raj Anand, intervened and convinced Amitabh to wear the police uniform by explaining its significance in the scene that the shooting resumed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-interview-with-tinnu-anand/20130611.htm#6 |title=Tinnu Anand Interview - Rediff|accessdate=30 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe shooting eventually wrapped up in October 1987. Even though the film was initially planned to be released in November, the release date kept on being pushed back due to the threat of a boycott of the movie by some opposition political parties.<ref name=\"indiatoday_328860\"/> These parties had had some conflict with Amitabh while he was a Congress MP and they maintained bitterness towards him even after he had retired from politics.\n\n''Shahenshah'' was finally released in February 1988 and went on to become a huge blockbuster earning over 6 crores by its fifth week.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.indicine.com/bollywood/shahenshah/ |title=Indicine Box Office Results - 1988|accessdate=30 October 2015}}</ref> The film performed very well at the box office despite strong competition from other superhit movies like ''[[Tezaab]]'' and ''[[Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak]]'', both of which were targeted towards the newer generation.\n\n==Music==\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column = Singer(s)\n| title1   = Andheri Raaton Main\n| extra1   = [[Kishore Kumar]]\n| length1  = 07:32\n|\n| title2   = Jaane Do Jaane Do Mujhe Jaana Hai\n| extra2   = [[Mohammed Aziz]], [[Lata Mangeshkar]]\n| length2  = 06:28\n|\n| title3   = Hoga Thanedaar Tu\n| extra3   = Kishore Kumar, Lata Mangeskhar\n| length3  = 07:02\n|\n| title4   = Gardish Main Jab Jaam\n| extra4   = [[Asha Bhosle]]\n| length4  = 06:22\n|\n| title5   = O Behna\n| extra5   = Mohammed Aziz\n| length5  = 04:32\n|\n| title6   = O Behna (Sad)\n| extra6   = Mohammed Aziz\n| length6  = 01:20\n|\n| total_length = 33:16\n}}\n\n==Awards==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n!

The film was produced and directed by [[Tinnu Anand]]. The story of the film was written by Amitabh Bachchan's wife [[Jaya Bachchan]] and the screenplay was written by veteran screenwriter [[Inder Raj Anand]], who died before the film was released. The film marked Bachchan's comeback to films after a three-year hiatus during which he had entered politics. Bachchan still had films releasing during the hiatus, as they were projects he had previously completed. The film became the second highest grossing film of 1988.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://muvyz.com/boxoffice/byyear/y3/1988|title=Box Office by Year - Top Grossing Movies of 1988|website=MuVyz|accessdate=12 April 2018}}</ref> It is remembered for the famous dialogue \"''Rishtey mein toh hum tumhare baap lagte hai...naam hai Shahenshah''\". The film is also remembered for Bachchan's  performance as a comic policeman and a crimefighting superhero.

Verma ([[Amrish Puri]]). J.K orchestrates a bank robbery to bail him out. Inspector Anand Shrivastav ([[Kader Khan]]) gets wind of this plot. He is about to crack the case when J.K. enlists an exotic dancer, Julie ([[Aruna Irani]]), to use the robbery as a backdrop and frame the honest inspector for corruption. Inspector Shrivastav is arrested and is imprisoned for three months. Inspector Shrivastav, the honest and innocent inspector, is so depressed about the false charges that he hangs himself at home after being released on bail. This creates a lasting and powerful impression on his young eight-year-old son, Vijaykumar. Vijay retains the noose his father used to hang himself. He vows someday restore his father's honour. Vijay and his mother leave their house and live in the house of another honest police inspector named Aslam Khan.\n\nYears later, a young Vijay ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]) in the inspector uniform,  grows up in the care of Inspector Aslam Khan ([[Pran (actor)|Pran]]), Inspector Shrivastav's friend and partner, who has allowed Vijay and his mother to live with him, and Vijay becomes a cop himself. Vijay is friends with Shaheena, the daughter of Aslam Khan. Aslam Khan is an honest cop much like Vijay's father. Vijay is an obsequious and cowardly inspector, prone to bribery and generally scared of powerful criminals. It doesn't take JK long to find Vijay, get him on the payroll, and run his underworld crime empire (drugs, guns, racketeering) past the cops.\n\nA new apparition bursts upon this scene who calls himself \"Shahenshah\", a costumed crime fighter (see movie poster). He has a left iron hand which is used to attack enemies and smash objects, and Shahenshah's other weapon is a noose. Oddly enough, it is the same noose Vijay's father used to hang himself with. This is because it is revealed later that Shahenshah is actually Vijay. When wearing Shahenshah's attire, Vijay describes himself as \"one who doesn't hold a cop's job but does the same work; one who apprehends criminals himself, conducts the trials himself, and, pronounces and executes the sentences himself\". So Vijay/Shahenshah's outward mission is to take out crime, but his real goal is to get to the guys who framed his father.\n\nShahenshah quietly breaks up several of J.K.'s gambling dens and illicit liquor distilleries. He also halts the demolition of a slum. This catches the eye of small-time trickster Shalu ([[Meenakshi Seshadri]]) who lives there with her aging and ailing mother Julie. J.K. had ordered her assassination after she helped frame Vijay's father; she has been on the run from him ever since, which becomes Shalu's motivation for seeking out and eliminating J.K. Shalu decides to infiltrate J.K.'s coterie by becoming an exotic dancer. One night, she attempts to kill J.K. by shooting him but is shocked when J.K. reveals he had been wearing a bullet-proof vest the whole time. Vijay lies to J.K. that Shahenshah's weakness is not letting Shalu die. He also lies that if J.K. returns Shalu to Shahenshah, Shahenshah will return J. K.'s goods worth millions. But J.K. is ultimately fooled. Shahenshah later detonates a bomb planted in J.K.'s truck. \n\nJ.K. murders an honest crime reporter Mohammed Salim ([[Vijayendra Ghatge]]), who was about to expose J.K.'s crime ring. Salim was married to Shaheena ([[Supriya Pathak]]), the daughter of Aslam Khan, and was also Vijay's brother-in-law. Vijay now decides to turn around his image as a cowardly cop. He openly defies J.K. Julie agrees to testify against J.K. Shalu provides ancillary evidence. And J.K. prepares for an all out war against Shahenshah/Vijay, Shalu and the lot of his enemies. At Salim's funeral, only one of the many witnesses of his death were present. He was about to reveal J.K.'s name, but a sharpshooter shoots him to death. \n\nThere is a veritable bloodbath on the streets as Inspector Vijay tries to get Julie into the courthouse. And there is a final showdown where Shahenshah reveals his secret identity and becomes the nemesis for all the culprits. To give himself a chance to escape, J.K. abducts Shalu. The showdown leads Vijay, dressed in Shahenshah's attire, chasing J.K. to the roof of the courthouse where J.K. is pleading his case, because his cover is blown. J.K. falls through a hole in the roof and is clinging on for dear life, with the whole court, judge sahab, audience and all looks on in astonishment. Vijay throws the noose down to J.K., and he gratefully accepts it. J.K., being the ruthless man that he is, attempts to attack Vijay. Vijay lets go of the noose, which slips around J.K.'s neck, and before the whole court, J.K. Verma is hanged, avenging Inspector Shrivastav and Salim the reporter, Shaheena's husband.\n\n== Cast ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Actor\n!Character in the movie\n!Notes\n|-\n| [[Amitabh Bachchan]]\n| Insp.

The story of ''Shahenshah'' was written by Amitabh's wife, Jaya Bachchan<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0080149 |title=Jaya Bhaduri - IMDb|accessdate=30 October 2015}}</ref> and further refined by Tinnu Anand's father Inder Raj Anand.

The argument got quite heated and with neither of the two willing to change his stance, shooting was temporarily halted. It was not until Tinnu's father, Inder Raj Anand, intervened and convinced Amitabh to wear the police uniform by explaining its significance in the scene that the shooting resumed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-interview-with-tinnu-anand/20130611.htm#6 |title=Tinnu Anand Interview - Rediff|accessdate=30 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe shooting eventually wrapped up in October 1987. Even though the film was initially planned to be released in November, the release date kept on being pushed back due to the threat of a boycott of the movie by some opposition political parties.<ref name=\"indiatoday_328860\"/> These parties had had some conflict with Amitabh while he was a Congress MP and they maintained bitterness towards him even after he had retired from politics.\n\n''Shahenshah'' was finally released in February 1988 and went on to become a huge blockbuster earning over 6 crores by its fifth week.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.indicine.com/bollywood/shahenshah/ |title=Indicine Box Office Results - 1988|accessdate=30 October 2015}}</ref> The film performed very well at the box office despite strong competition from other superhit movies like ''[[Tezaab]]'' and ''[[Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak]]'', both of which were targeted towards the newer generation.\n\n==Music==\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column = Singer(s)\n| title1   = Andheri Raaton Main\n| extra1   = [[Kishore Kumar]]\n| length1  = 07:32\n|\n| title2   = Jaane Do Jaane Do Mujhe Jaana Hai\n| extra2   = [[Mohammed Aziz]], [[Lata Mangeshkar]]\n| length2  = 06:28\n|\n| title3   = Hoga Thanedaar Tu\n| extra3   = Kishore Kumar, Lata Mangeskhar\n| length3  = 07:02\n|\n| title4   = Gardish Main Jab Jaam\n| extra4   = [[Asha Bhosle]]\n| length4  = 06:22\n|\n| title5   = O Behna\n| extra5   = Mohammed Aziz\n| length5  = 04:32\n|\n| title6   = O Behna (Sad)\n| extra6   = Mohammed Aziz\n| length6  = 01:20\n|\n| total_length = 33:16\n}}\n\n==Awards==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n!

From the Ancient [[Greeks]] and Romans to Napoleon's [[France]] and Elizabethan [[England]], much of history is filled with stories of entertainment based on games of chance.\n\nThe first known European gambling house, not called a casino although meeting the modern definition, was the [[Ridotto]], established in [[Venice]], Italy, in 1638 by the [[Great Council of Venice]] to provide controlled gambling during the carnival season. It was closed in 1774 as the city government felt it was impoverishing the local gentry.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Thomassen|first1=Bj\u00f8rn|title=Liminality and the Modern: Living Through the In-Between|date=2014|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|page=160|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5Sd7BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA160&lpg=PA160&dq=ridotto+1638+casino#v=onepage&q=ridotto%201638%20casino&f=false|accessdate=August 17, 2015|isbn=9781409460800}}</ref>\n\nIn American history, early gambling establishments were known as [[Western saloon|saloons]]. The creation and importance of saloons was greatly influenced by four major cities: [[New Orleans]], [[St. Louis]], [[Chicago]] and [[San Francisco]]. It was in the saloons that travelers could find people to talk to, drink with, and often gamble with. During the early 20th century in America, gambling was outlawed by state legislation. However, in 1931, gambling was legalized throughout the state of [[Nevada]], where America's first legalized casinos were set up. In 1976 [[New Jersey]] allowed gambling in [[Atlantic City]], now America's second largest gambling city.\n\n==Gambling in [http://linvenon.com/NPek casinos]==\n[[File:Casino slots2.jpg|thumb|[[Slot machine]]s in Atlantic City.

This can be expressed more precisely by the notion of [[expected value]], which is uniformly negative (from the player's perspective). This advantage is called the ''[[Casino game#House advantage|house edge]]''. In games such as [[poker]] where players play against each other, the house takes a commission called the [[Rake (poker)|rake]].

From the Ancient [[Greeks]] and Romans to Napoleon's [[France]] and Elizabethan [[England]], much of history is filled with stories of entertainment based on games of chance.\n\nThe first known European gambling house, not called a casino although meeting the modern definition, was the [[Ridotto]], established in [[Venice]], Italy, in 1638 by the [[Great Council of Venice]] to provide controlled gambling during the carnival season. It was closed in 1774 as the city government felt it was impoverishing the local gentry.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Thomassen|first1=Bj\u00f8rn|title=Liminality and the Modern: Living Through the In-Between|date=2014|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|page=160|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5Sd7BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA160&lpg=PA160&dq=ridotto+1638+casino#v=onepage&q=ridotto%201638%20casino&f=false|accessdate=August 17, 2015|isbn=9781409460800}}</ref>\n\nIn American history, early gambling establishments were known as [[Western saloon|saloons]]. The creation and importance of saloons was greatly influenced by four major cities: [[New Orleans]], [[St. Louis]], [[Chicago]] and [[San Francisco]]. It was in the saloons that travelers could find people to talk to, drink with, and often gamble with. During the early 20th century in America, gambling was outlawed by state legislation. However, in 1931, gambling was legalized throughout the state of [[Nevada]], where America's first legalized casinos were set up. In 1976 [[New Jersey]] allowed gambling in [[Atlantic City]], now America's second largest gambling city.\n\n==Gambling in [http://linvenon.com/s4ek casinos]==\n[[File:Casino slots2.jpg|thumb|[[Slot machine]]s in Atlantic City.

Most games have mathematically determined [[odds]] that ensure the house has at all times an advantage over the players. This can be expressed more precisely by the notion of [[expected value]], which is uniformly negative (from the player's perspective). This advantage is called the ''[[Casino game#House advantage|house edge]]''. In games such as [[poker]] where players play against each other, the house takes a commission called the [[Rake (poker)|rake]]. Casinos sometimes give out complimentary items or [[Comps (casino)|comps]] to gamblers.\n\n''Payout'' is the percentage of funds (\"winnings\") returned to players.\n\nCasinos in the United States say that a player staking money won from the casino is ''playing with the house's money''.\n\nVideo Lottery Machines (slot machines) have become one of the most popular forms of gambling in casinos. {{As of | 2011}} investigative reports have started calling into question whether the modern-day slot-machine is addictive.<ref>\n[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/01/07/60minutes/main7223329.shtml/ \"Slot Machines: The Big Gamble\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713080253/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/01/07/60minutes/main7223329.shtml/ |date=July 13, 2011 }}, (Jan. 10, 2011).
