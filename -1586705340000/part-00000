{"title_page": "Economy of the Empire of Japan", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{no footnotes|date=March 2008}}\n{{copy edit|date=March 2020}}\n}}\n\nIn the half-century up to 1999, [[Japan]]'s [[export]]s grew from 144 million to 5,331 million [[yen]] (\u00a5). This amounted to a share of world trade of only 3.7%, compared with 13.7% for the [[United Kingdom]] or 11.8% for the [[United States]]. The [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s also resulted in imports exceeding exports by \u00a51,000 million.\n\nIn 1936, Japan had the third-largest commercial shipping fleet in the world, valued at $1,183,000,000, or $28.10<!-- Is this US dollars? --> per person.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Government economic administration (Meiji through World War II)==\nThe official government entities who guided the Japanese national economy were the Economy and Finance Ministry, the [[Bank of Japan]], and the Industry and Commerce Ministry. For military spending, there was the [[Ministry of the Navy (Japan)|Navy Ministry]] and the [[Ministry of the Army]].\n\n==Investment in Korea (through World War II)==\nIn 1932, Japan invested $550,000,000 and similarly invested $320,000,000 in 1938. This investment produced a return of 400% in industrial monetary value.\n\nIn the fishing industry, Japan extracted a value of $20,000,000 annually. This is a high per capita statistic in fishing and comprised 15% of world fishing volumes.\n\nThe Noguchi Family put their principal investments in Banking commerce and Industry in this province. With their funds, the [[zaibatsu]] and the Japanese government founded the [[Bank of Chosen]], the central banking institution in the province, which stayed linked with the [[Central Bank of Manchou]], the Manchu central bank.\n\nOther significant industries were chemicals (30%) and Metal and machinery (10%) with a total 1,000,000 of workers in these areas, plus woodworking, textile, foods, and handcrafts.\n\n==Fishing (World War II era)==\nThe important Okhotsk fisheries had a value of \u00a550 million. Other fisheries in [[Korea under Japanese rule|Chosen]], [[Karafuto]], [[South Mandate]] and [[Taiwan|Formosa]] came to \u00a5122,000,000 and \u00a5358,000,000 from Japan proper, for a total of \u00a5480,000,000 (1938 figures). Secondary products from fishing had a value of \u00a5150 million to \u00a5200 million. (From another source, fishing values were of \u00a5235,000,000 and \u00a5275,000,000 from 1919 to 1913, more than the British.)\n\nCoastal fishing represented 61% of the total value, with a fleet of 364,260 small boats, of which 20% had engines; the rest were sailing boats. High seas fishing represented 28% of the industry, with [[whaling]], [[coral]] and [[pearl]] collecting and pisciculture on land making up the rest. The high seas vessels operated in the [[North Pacific]] area ([[Alaska]] coasts), to the South Pacific. During Japanese administration, the fishing in the [[Kwantung]] leased territory was 61,000 tonnes.\n\nIn 1938, the [[fish factory vessel]]s packed 204,000,000 packages of crab and 370 packages of sea salmon. In the same year, four whale hunting vessels fished in the waters around the [[Antarctic]]. Factories were built in [[Chisima]], [[Hokkaid\u014d]], [[Karafuto]], [[Taiwan]], [[Korea under Japanese rule|Chosen]], [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]], [[Shikoku]] and other coastal areas to process fish products.\n\n==Forestry products (World War II era)==\nLocal forestry represented a production of 14,000,000 meters of wood with a value of \u00a575,000,000, a total value of \u00a550,000,000 in cut wood, \u00a53,000,000 in [[bamboo]] and other secondary wood products for a total value of \u00a5100,000,000. The local forests covered 200,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, 90,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> under State administration or Imperial Family reserves. And, taking part in scientific forest research during the latter years. Coal of wood was valued at 100,000,000 yen. The Sugi (Cryptomeria Japonica), representing a quarter of the total quantity, Pine more than 20% in quantity and value and the Hinoki (Chamaecyparis Obtusa) only 1/4% of quantity, but more than 9% in value.\n\nDespite many forests and their importance, Japan continued to buy wood overseas. In accordance with the other dates, Japan had 200,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of forest, 100,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in private hands, the other 75,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in state control and 12,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> owned by the Imperial House. Wood exports were made to the rest of the Japanese empire and to foreign markets.\n\n==Paper and cellulose industry==\nSince ancient times, Japan has manufactured assorted paper types by hand. A modern mechanized industry appeared in 1872 and became one of the most important industries in the nation. The total production was about 1,000,000 [[ton]]nes of paper and cardboard. [[Wood pulp|cellulose paste]], the principal prime material, was made in [[Shikoku]], [[Hokkaid\u014d]] and [[Karafuto]]. The [[Cellulose]] production resulted in 8% of U.S. manufacture; the Cellulose industry in Japan developed in [[Shikoku]], North [[Honsh\u016b]], [[Hokkaid\u014d]], [[Korea under Japanese rule|Chosen]], [[Manchukuo]] and [[Karafuto]]. In Karafuto was the [[Shiretoru]] Cellulose Factory, the most advanced installation dedicated to the cellulose industry in all of [[East Asia]]. The first place where European-type paper was manufactured in Japan was in the city of [[Shikuka]]. Additionally, to complement this local production, these products were sold in [[Canada]] and the [[United States of America]].\n\n==North Sakhalin and Japanese-Russian fishing convention==\nThe Japanese and Russian oil wells, in the same oil zone, were strictly controlled to ensure equitable exploitation. The pits stayed in direct connection with the Moskalvo port on the west coast of Ohka through a network of oil pipelines.\n\nIn 1925, the Soviet Government granted Japan petroliferous and carbonaceous concessions in North Sakhalin to Mitsubishi, Itoh-Korada, Mitsui and other Japanese Companies for a period of 45 years. By Protocols and agreements signed in Moscow in May 1944, these concessions expired 26 years before the accorded time in 1970, while a new Japanese-Russian accord over fishing conventions agreed to the formal retirement of some Japanese fisheries in the Far East to Japanese concessors, the right of Soviet Organizations to buy annually and for auction 10% of Japanese fish shares, and a supplementary payment in gold for Japanese owners.\n\nWhen modifying these fishing conventions in 1928, according to the activities of Soviet Fishing Organizations, citizens were subject to substantial reductions. The Japanese-Russian accord of March 1944 canceled all restrictions previously observed.\n\nJapanese subjects and foreigners were banned from fishing in certain maritime zones in the Far East under an agreement with the Soviet Government made in July 1941. The Japanese Government also guaranteed that fishing rights on the East Coast of [[Kamchatka]] and [[Olyutorsk]] were not taken up by the Japanese.\n\n==Birth rates==\nSome dates and figures:\n*In 1914, the Japanese birth rate stood at 15%, close to that of [[Germany]] or [[Russia]], slightly lower than [[Java (island)|Java]] (Dutch Indies) at 22%. There was a reduction to 13.6% in 1924. For example, in Japan proper there were 157 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>, and Hokkaido had 184 residents in per km<sup>2</sup> (cf. Java, which had 274).\n*In 1925, the population grew by 875,000 per year, in 1926 by 900,000, in 1927 this number grew to 1,000,000. In the next four years, the annual increase in population averaged 900,000, but in 1932-1940 the net growth was more than 1,000,000 per year, a rate which would double the population in 40 years. Japan imported 10% of the food for this population.\n*In 1936, Japan had 30.3 births per 1,000 residents and 17.5 deaths per 1,000. The net increase in population was 1,028,623 in 1935, but notably reduced to 653,000 in 1939 and 239,000 in 1940. Among the great countries, the birth average of Japan immediately followed British India (34.9) and was double that of the United States (16.7). This was accompanied by a growth in rice production between 1880-1940 of 60 million [[koku]] (300 million [[bushel]]s).\n*Japanese thinkers were preoccupied with demographics: to reduce the rate of deaths and increase that of births and comparing this with growth in China and the Soviet Union. Army ideologists pondered the question and produced a [[eugenics]] law which ordered the sterilization or abortion of inferior or inadequate babies and ordered the increase of birth physically \"perfect\" future Samurai warriors. The Japanese government gave economic support to all mothers having many children. These experts planned a ten-year program to increase the number of soldiers to the number of 100,000,000. If needed for conquest purposes, Japanese mothers \"manufactured\" three million babies or, in other words, a sixfold increase in this \"production\" by all Japanese women.\n\nThese programs were guided by [[Katsuko Tojo]], [[General Tojo]]'s wife. She said wives should have seven children and suggested this should be the correct Japanese mother. This included participation by the central government, as she suggested creating one program for increasing the number of marriages.\n\n==Naval construction industry==\nIn 1893 naval construction was in the range 177,000 to 1,528,000 tonnes. In 1913 this increased to 3,565,000 tonnes. In 1924 with 237 500-tonnes vessels and 11 10,000-tonnes and reaching 4,140,000 tonnes in 1928. The Japanese Navy was third in the world behind British and American Navies and dominated the West Pacific area before the war. The first modern Shipyard was built in 1891, and since then naval construction rapidly advanced. Japanese boats of more than 100 tonnes represented a total registered tonnage of 5,007,000 tonnes out of 1,198,000 corresponding to naval construction of 1936\u20131938. This put Japan in third place between maritime powers, a notable realization in such a short time. The old vessels were destroyed or disarmed which is why the regular fleet was efficient and modern. Without scarcity of Petrol, much of these modern vessels were designed for that energy source.\n\n==Military industry==\nThis sector was important from the [[First Chinese-Japanese war]] to the Pacific War.\n\nLarge industrial groups received large investment for making weapons for Japanese Army and Navy in national war efforts. In military aircraft industry exist the next names of important companies how:\n\nFor the Japanese Navy:\n*[[Aichi Kokuki|Aichi]] (1,643,913 weapons)\n*[[Kawanishi Aircraft Company|Kawanishi]] (1,036,435 weapons)\n*Showa/[[Nakajima Aircraft Company|Nakajima]]\n*[[Nihon]]\n*[[Maeda Corporation|Maeda]]\n*[[Yokosuka]] (980,136 weapons)\n*[[Watanabe]]\n*[[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]] (218,102 weapons)\n*[[Kugisho]]\n*[[Mizuno Corporation|Mizuno]]\n*[[Funryu]]\nFor the Japanese Army:\n*[[Nikkoku]]\n*[[Yokoi]]\n*[[Maeda Corporation|Maeda]]\n*[[Rikugun/Kokukosho]]\n*[[Rikugun/Kogiken]]\n*[[Tachikawa]] (2,078,832 weapons)\n*[[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]] (2,172,875 weapons)\n*[[Kokusai]] (60,037 weapons)\n*[[Kayaba]]\nFor both armed branches:\n*[[Nakajima Aircraft Company|Nakajima]] (2,052,157 (army) and 3,148,417 (navy) weapons)\n*[[Mitsubishi]] (2,503,194 (army) and 1,287,742 (navy) weapons)\nFor Manchukuo and the Japanese Army:\n*[[Manchuria Airplane Manufacturing Company|Mansh\u016b]] (125,379 weapons)\nand other related companies.\n\nIn other war material, the name of [[Nambu Company]] are charged for making hand weapons for both armed branches, the [[Mitsubishi]] heavy industries with subsidiaries ([[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] Company, [[Ikegai]] Iron Works, [[Sagami Arsenal]] (factory) and others) possess the contract to manufacture the second Tank Type in use for armed forces the Medium Tank Type 97 or Chi-Ha and Shinhoto-Chi-Ha with a total of 1,049 units made in 1938\u20131941.\n*The first prototypes of Type 97 Medium Tank are constructed for Tokyo Plant of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and [[Osaka Arsenal]]. The engines are designed by Mitsubishi and Ikegai Iron Works Ltd.\n*Production numbers of Medium Tank type 97:\n**1938 (25 units)\n**1939 (202 units)\n**1940 (315 units)\n**1941 (507 units)\n**1942 (531 units)\n**1943 (543 units)\n**1944 (production ceased)\n*Total by factories:\n**Mitsubishi: (1,224 units)\n**Hitachi: (355 units)\n*Other factories who construct these tanks include:\n**Sagami Arsenal\n*Of theirs ones:\n**2,123 units of \"Shinhoto-Chi-Ha\" (New turret version)\n**Unknown cipher of \"Chi-Ha\" (regular model)\n*Total production stay in ones 1,049 units between 1938\u20131941.\n\nThe shipyards of [[Mitsubishi]] and [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]] jointly with Naval arsenals making the war vessels and Submarines need for Japanese navy and exist other industrialist groups why manufactured other equipment needed for these war efforts too. Apart debt at agreements with Germany, theirs receiving much military technology and samples of weapons for develop in country or Japanese government buying any licenses to making and the prototypes for same purpose too.\n\nAdditionally Japanese before and during last times of war, developed some types of unusual military combat infantry techniques, artifacts, special weapons and certain weapons of mass destruction between other various bellicose equipment. Theirs are collectively named \"Japanese Secret and Special Weapons\".\n\nFor this, also see \"[[Japanese Secret and Special Weapons]]\".\n\n==Natural Resources in occupied areas after 1937==\n===Occupied Chinese Mainland===\nFrom 1937, during the Japanese military occupation of territories in [[China]], they controlled certain mineral deposits in those areas. They fall into three sectors:\n\nDeposits of tungsten, tin and manganese, also.\n*[[Chekiang]]: coal reserves were 101 million tonnes and extraction 250,000 tonnes in 1934. There were certain soils rich in bauxite.\n\n====South China area====\n*[[Fujian|Fukien]]: coal reserves of 500 million tonnes in 1934.\n*[[Kwantung]] (Canton): 421 million tonnes of coal reserves, and production was 338,000 tonnes in 1934. Iron reserves in [[Hainan]], with 400 million tonnes of iron of high grade in 1934. A small tungsten production, also.\n*[[Kwangsi]]: coal reserves of 300 million tonnes, and production of 30,000 tonnes in 1940. There were some sources of tungsten, manganese (production of 1,246 tonnes in 1940) and a tin production of 417,000 tonnes too.\n*[[Hunan]]: coal reserves were 1,793 million tonnes and extraction of 1,050,000 tonnes in 1940. Some deposits of tungsten, mercury, antimony ([[Hsikwangshan]] mine), manganese and gold.\n*[[Kweichow]]: coal reserves were 1,549 million tonnes, and extraction 360,750 tonnes in 1940. Deposits of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], [[copper]], [[antimony]], and [[sulphur]] also.\n\n===South East Asia===\nThis zone when conquered by Japanese forces added further resources and strategic points. This had formed part of Japanese Navy plans to expand into the '[[South Sea lands]]'.\n*[[Burma]]: in the [[Ayeyarwady River|Irrawaddy river]] zone, there were the [[Yenangyaung]] and [[Chauk]] oil fields, 300 miles (500&nbsp;km) north of [[Rangoon]]. These sources and other in [[Singu]] extracted 260,000,000 gallons in 1938, and there was an unexploited coal deposit. This nation had other minerals: [[amber]] and [[jade]] ([[nefrite]] stone), [[lapis lazuli]], [[lazurite]], [[rubies]], extraction {{convert|141490|carat|kg}} in 1937, [[sapphire]]s, etc. in [[Shan Mesete]]. There was a major mine in [[Bawdwin]], producing silver, lead, zinc, nickel and copper. This deposit produced 72,000 tonnes of lead and ones 5,000,000 ounces in 1933, rock with content 20% of lead and zinc as a mineral. In [[Mergui]] and [[Tavoy]] ([[Tenasseri]]n area) mines produced tungsten and tin from 1910. Tin extraction rose to 6,623 tonnes in 1937.\n*[[Thailand]]: in its ranges were abundant sources of tin, which were extracted for mining, and from rivers. On the south coast [[guano]] was mined for [[fertilizer]] production.\n*[[French Indochina]]: in [[Honggay]] (near [[Haipong]]) extracted ones 2,308,000 tonnes of coal in 1937. Minerals included Tungsten, Chromium, Tin, antimony and manganese in the northern area and Phosphate rock in the southern area. These minerals were extracted to export in bulk for processing abroad.\n*[[Malacca]]: Tin extraction was in the hands of its Chinese citizens; production in 1939 was 55,950 tonnes or some 30% of world production. There were tin factories in [[Singapore]] and [[Penang]] for processing local extractions, and those of Thailand, Burma and Indochina. In the same area Japanese pre-war investment had related to bauxite, iron and manganese. The Kelantan, Trengganu and Johore iron mineral extractions represented 1,944,701 tonnes in 1939; the manganese was from [[Kelantan]] and [[Trengganu]] and Bauxite provided from Johore in the same year. Other Japanese mining investments were in the Dutch island of [[Bintang]] and existing coal deposits.\n*[[Dutch Indies]]: Its minerals were scarce but had important value. The oil in the [[Palembang]] ([[Sumatra]]), [[Djambi]], [[Medan]] and [[Borneo]] fields in [[Balikpapan]] and [[Tarakan Island|Tarakan]] produced 7,938,000 tonnes in 1940; perhaps a greater yield than California and Iran. Coal was in Sumatra and Borneo, with 1,456,647 tonnes mined in the same year. Additionally there were sulphur and manganese in Java, and nickel in [[Sulawesi|Celebes]]. Tin came from [[Bangka Island|Banka]] and the [[Billington Islands]], which extracted 43,900 tonnes in 1940. The Japanese mining business in the Bintang Island tin deposits produced 275,000 tonnes that year, supposedly one sixth of world production.\n*[[Philippines]]: Its mining industry had spectacularly developed during the U.S. administration. It produced more gold than Alaska, or any other American state apart from California. Gold extraction in 1941 represented 1,109,000 troy oz (34,500&nbsp;kg), five times more than in 1931, and silver associated with gold ore at the same level. These extractions proceeded mostly from the [[Benget]] district in [[Baguio Province]], [[Luzon]]. Iron deposits were rapidly developed and during 1941 1,191,641 tonnes was exported to Japan. Iron sources were located in [[North Camarines]] ([[Luzon]]), [[Samar (island)|Samar Island]] and [[Surigao (province)|Surigao]] in [[Mindanao island]]. In the last of these, the iron reserves were estimated as 500 million tonnes; [[Laterithic]] minerals with content of silicon, sulphur, phosphorus, and an iron content of 48% were of easy extraction from coastal areas. Chromium was not discovered until 1935, but the Philippines in 1939 produced 164,000 tonnes and had fifth place, or 11%, of world production. Sources were in [[Zambales]] (Luzon) with its extraction of 10 million tonnes, chrome oxide with a high 50% of chrome content. Manganese was abundant but of medium quality, and was sent to the US from 1935; the local production was 58,038 tonnes in 1940. There were also copper, lead, zinc and coal.\n\n===Pacific Sea lands===\nIn total or partial control:\n*New Guinea: certain Gold deposits in Bulolo (East New Guinea) with other minerals in these islands.\n*Nauru: certain sources of phosphates.\n*Gilberts: are other deposits of phosphates.\n*Salomon: sources of gold, copper and phosphates.\n*Palau Islands: Source of bauxite\n\n===Summary===\nExcept for the transportation difficulties due to great distances, the frequent sinking of Japanese merchants vessels or downed transport aircraft, guerrilla and local resistance movements' strikes against the mines, centers or transport lines, aerial allied attacks against occupied areas and great colonial administrative difficulties to manage these great territories outside Japan, these active or potential resources could not be used or disposed in adequate form for the Japanese Empire and much of these potential mineral exports did not arrive in Japanese markets and industries for finishing the process during the Pacific war time.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Agriculture in the Empire of Japan]]\n*[[Demographics of Imperial Japan]]\n*[[Japanese heavy industry during WW2 times]]\n*[[Japanese mining and energy resources (WWII)]]\n*[[Japanese exterior Commerce during WW2 Times]]\n*[[Japanese-German pre-WWII industrial co-operation]]\n*[[Japanese Nuclear Weapons Development]]\n*[[Empire of Japan (foreign commerce and shipping)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080312173606/http://www.users.bigpond.com/battleforAustralia/historicalbackground/JapMilaggro.html JAPAN'S MILITARY AGGRESSION IN EAST ASIA 1931-1937] at users.bigpond.com/battleforaustralia\n* [http://www.historyorb.com/asia/japan_economic_expansion.shtml Japan's Economic Expansion into Manchuria and China in World War Two] at historyorb.com Author: James Graham Published: May, 2004\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.combinedfleet.com/economic.htm Why Japan ''Really'' Lost The War]\n\n{{JapanEmpireNavbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Empire Of Japan, Economy Of the}}\n[[Category:Economic history of Japan]]\n[[Category:Economic history of World War II]]\n[[Category:Empire of Japan|Economy]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{no footnotes|date=March 2008}}\n{{copy edit|date=March 2020}}\n}}\n\nIn the half-century up to 1999, [[Japan]]'s [[export]]s grew from 144 million to 5,331 million [[yen]] (\u00a5). This amounted to a share of world trade of only 3.7%, compared with 13.7% for the [[United Kingdom]] or 11.8% for the [[United States]]. The [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s also resulted in imports exceeding exports by \u00a51,000 million.\n\nIn 1936, Japan had the third-largest commercial shipping fleet in the world, valued at $1,183,000,000, or $28.10<!-- Is this US dollars? --> per person{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}.\n\n==Government economic administration (Meiji through World War II)==\nThe official government entities who guided the Japanese national economy were the Economy and Finance Ministry, the [[Bank of Japan]], and the Industry and Commerce Ministry. For military spending, there was the [[Ministry of the Navy (Japan)|Navy Ministry]] and the [[Ministry of the Army]].\n\n==Investment in Korea (through World War II)==\nIn 1932, Japan invested $550,000,000 and similarly invested $320,000,000 in 1938. This investment produced a return of 400% in industrial monetary value.\n\nIn the fishing industry, Japan extracted a value of $20,000,000 annually. This is a high per capita statistic in fishing and comprised 15% of world fishing volumes.\n\nThe Noguchi Family put their principal investments in Banking commerce and Industry in this province. With their funds, the [[zaibatsu]] and the Japanese government founded the [[Bank of Chosen]], the central banking institution in the province, which stayed linked with the [[Central Bank of Manchou]], the Manchu central bank.\n\nOther significant industries were chemicals (30%) and Metal and machinery (10%) with a total 1,000,000 of workers in these areas, plus woodworking, textile, foods, and handcrafts.\n\n==Fishing (World War II era)==\nThe important Okhotsk fisheries had a value of \u00a550 million. Other fisheries in [[Korea under Japanese rule|Chosen]], [[Karafuto]], [[South Mandate]] and [[Taiwan|Formosa]] came to \u00a5122,000,000 and \u00a5358,000,000 from Japan proper, for a total of \u00a5480,000,000 (1938 figures). Secondary products from fishing had a value of \u00a5150 million to \u00a5200 million. (From another source, fishing values were of \u00a5235,000,000 and \u00a5275,000,000 from 1919 to 1913, more than the British.)\n\nCoastal fishing represented 61% of the total value, with a fleet of 364,260 small boats, of which 20% had engines; the rest were sailing boats. High seas fishing represented 28% of the industry, with [[whaling]], [[coral]] and [[pearl]] collecting and pisciculture on land making up the rest. The high\nseas vessels operated in the [[North Pacific]] area ([[Alaska]] coasts), to the South Pacific. During Japanese administration, the fishing in the [[Kwantung]] leased territory was 61,000 tonnes.\n\nIn 1938, the [[fish factory vessel]]s packed 204,000,000 packages of crab and 370 packages of sea salmon. In the same year, four whale hunting vessels fished in the waters around the [[Antarctic]]. Factories were built in [[Chisima]], [[Hokkaid\u014d]], [[Karafuto]], [[Taiwan]], [[Korea under Japanese rule|Chosen]], [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]], [[Shikoku]] and other coastal areas to process fish products.\n\n==Forestry products (World War II era)==\nLocal forestry represented a production of 14,000,000 meters of wood with a value of \u00a575,000,000, a total value of \u00a550,000,000 in cut wood, \u00a53,000,000 in [[bamboo]] and other secondary wood products for a total value of \u00a5100,000,000. The local forests covered 200,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, 90,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> under State administration or Imperial Family reserves. And, taking part in scientific forest research during the latter years. Coal of wood was valued at 100,000,000 yen. The Sugi (Cryptomeria Japonica), representing a quarter of the total quantity, Pine more than 20% in quantity and value and the Hinoki (Chamaecyparis Obtusa) only 1/4% of quantity, but more than 9% in value.\n\nDespite many forests and their importance, Japan continued to buy wood overseas. In accordance with the other dates, Japan had 200,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of forest, 100,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in private hands, the other 75,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in state control and 12,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> owned by the Imperial House. Wood exports were made to the rest of the Japanese empire and to foreign markets.\n\n==Paper and cellulose industry==\nSince ancient times, Japan has manufactured assorted paper types by hand. A modern mechanized industry appeared in 1872 and became one of the most important industries in the nation. The total production was about 1,000,000 [[ton]]nes of paper and cardboard. [[Wood pulp|cellulose paste]], the principal prime material, was made in [[Shikoku]], [[Hokkaid\u014d]] and [[Karafuto]]. The [[Cellulose]] production resulted in 8% of U.S. manufacture; the Cellulose industry in Japan developed in [[Shikoku]], North [[Honsh\u016b]], [[Hokkaid\u014d]], [[Korea under Japanese rule|Chosen]], [[Manchukuo]] and [[Karafuto]]. In Karafuto was the [[Shiretoru]] Cellulose Factory, the most advanced installation dedicated to the cellulose industry in all of [[East Asia]]. The first place where European-type paper was manufactured in Japan was in the city of [[Shikuka]]. Additionally, to complement this local production, these products were sold in [[Canada]] and the [[United States of America]].\n\n==North Sakhalin and Japanese-Russian fishing convention==\nThe Japanese and Russian oil wells, in the same oil zone, were strictly controlled to ensure equitable exploitation. The pits stayed in direct connection with the Moskalvo port on the west coast of Ohka through a network of oil pipelines.\n\nIn 1925, the Soviet Government granted Japan petroliferous and carbonaceous concessions in North Sakhalin to Mitsubishi, Itoh-Korada, Mitsui and other Japanese Companies for a period of 45 years. By Protocols and agreements signed in Moscow in May 1944, these concessions expired 26 years before the accorded time in 1970, while a new Japanese-Russian accord over fishing conventions agreed to the formal retirement of some Japanese fisheries in the Far East to Japanese concessors, the right of Soviet Organizations to buy annually and for auction 10% of Japanese fish shares, and a supplementary payment in gold for Japanese owners.\n\nWhen modifying these fishing conventions in 1928, according to the activities of Soviet Fishing Organizations, citizens were subject to substantial reductions. The Japanese-Russian accord of March 1944 canceled all restrictions previously observed.\n\nJapanese subjects and foreigners were banned from fishing in certain maritime zones in the Far East under an agreement with the Soviet Government made in July 1941. The Japanese Government also guaranteed that fishing rights on the East Coast of [[Kamchatka]] and [[Olyutorsk]] were not taken up by the Japanese.\n\n==Birth rates==\nSome dates and figures:\n*In 1914, the Japanese birth rate stood at 15%, close to that of [[Germany]] or [[Russia]], slightly lower than [[Java (island)|Java]] (Dutch Indies) at 22%. There was a reduction to 13.6% in 1924. For example, in Japan proper there were 157 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>, and Hokkaido had 184 residents in per km<sup>2</sup> (cf. Java, which had 274).\n*In 1925, the population grew by 875,000 per year, in 1926 by 900,000, in 1927 this number grew to 1,000,000. In the next four years, the annual increase in population averaged 900,000, but in 1932-1940 the net growth was more than 1,000,000 per year, a rate which would double the population in 40 years. Japan imported 10% of the food for this population.\n*In 1936, Japan had 30.3 births per 1,000 residents and 17.5 deaths per 1,000. The net increase in population was 1,028,623 in 1935, but notably reduced to 653,000 in 1939 and 239,000 in 1940. Among the great countries, the birth average of Japan immediately followed British India (34.9) and was double that of the United States (16.7). This was accompanied by a growth in rice production between 1880-1940 of 60 million [[koku]] (300 million [[bushel]]s).\n*Japanese thinkers were preoccupied with demographics: to reduce the rate of deaths and increase that of births and comparing this with growth in China and the Soviet Union. Army ideologists pondered the question and produced a [[eugenics]] law which ordered the sterilization or abortion of inferior or inadequate babies and ordered the increase of birth physically \"perfect\" future Samurai warriors. The Japanese government gave economic support to all mothers having many children. These experts planned a ten-year program to increase the number of soldiers to the number of 100,000,000. If needed for conquest purposes, Japanese mothers \"manufactured\" three million babies or, in other words, a sixfold increase in this \"production\" by all Japanese women.\n\nThese programs were guided by [[Katsuko Tojo]], [[General Tojo]]'s wife. She said wives should have seven children and suggested this should be the correct Japanese mother. This included participation by the central government, as she suggested creating one program for increasing the number of marriages.\n\n==Naval construction industry==\nIn 1893 naval construction was in the range 177,000 to 1,528,000 tonnes. In 1913 this increased to 3,565,000 tonnes. In 1924 with 237 500-tonnes vessels and 11 10,000-tonnes and reaching 4,140,000 tonnes in 1928. The Japanese Navy was third in the world behind British and American Navies and dominated the West Pacific area before the war. The first modern Shipyard was built in 1891, and since then naval construction rapidly advanced. Japanese boats of more than 100 tonnes represented a total registered tonnage of 5,007,000 tonnes out of 1,198,000 corresponding to naval construction of 1936\u20131938. This put Japan in third place between maritime powers, a notable realization in such a short time. The old vessels were destroyed or disarmed which is why the regular fleet was efficient and modern. Without scarcity of Petrol, much of these modern vessels were designed for that energy source.\n\n==Military industry==\nThis sector was important from the [[First Chinese-Japanese war]] to the Pacific War.\n\nLarge industrial groups received large investment for making weapons for Japanese Army and Navy in national war efforts. In military aircraft industry exist the next names of important companies how:\n\nFor the Japanese Navy:\n*[[Aichi Kokuki|Aichi]] (1,643,913 weapons)\n*[[Kawanishi Aircraft Company|Kawanishi]] (1,036,435 weapons)\n*Showa/[[Nakajima Aircraft Company|Nakajima]]\n*[[Nihon]]\n*[[Maeda Corporation|Maeda]]\n*[[Yokosuka]] (980,136 weapons)\n*[[Watanabe]]\n*[[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]] (218,102 weapons)\n*[[Kugisho]]\n*[[Mizuno Corporation|Mizuno]]\n*[[Funryu]]\nFor the Japanese Army:\n*[[Nikkoku]]\n*[[Yokoi]]\n*[[Maeda Corporation|Maeda]]\n*[[Rikugun/Kokukosho]]\n*[[Rikugun/Kogiken]]\n*[[Tachikawa]] (2,078,832 weapons)\n*[[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]] (2,172,875 weapons)\n*[[Kokusai]] (60,037 weapons)\n*[[Kayaba]]\nFor both armed branches:\n*[[Nakajima Aircraft Company|Nakajima]] (2,052,157 (army) and 3,148,417 (navy) weapons)\n*[[Mitsubishi]] (2,503,194 (army) and 1,287,742 (navy) weapons)\nFor Manchukuo and the Japanese Army:\n*[[Manchuria Airplane Manufacturing Company|Mansh\u016b]] (125,379 weapons)\nand other related companies.\n\nIn other war material, the name of [[Nambu Company]] are charged for making hand weapons for both armed branches, the [[Mitsubishi]] heavy industries with subsidiaries ([[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] Company, [[Ikegai]] Iron Works, [[Sagami Arsenal]] (factory) and others) possess the contract to manufacture the second Tank Type in use for armed forces the Medium Tank Type 97 or Chi-Ha and Shinhoto-Chi-Ha with a total of 1,049 units made in 1938\u20131941.\n*The first prototypes of Type 97 Medium Tank are constructed for Tokyo Plant of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and [[Osaka Arsenal]].

Apart debt at agreements with Germany, theirs receiving much military technology and samples of weapons for develop in country or Japanese government buying any licenses to making and the prototypes for same purpose too.\n\nAdditionally Japanese before and during last times of war, developed some types of unusual military combat infantry techniques, artifacts, special weapons and certain weapons of mass destruction between other various bellicose equipment. Theirs are collectively named \"Japanese Secret and Special Weapons\".\n\nFor this, also see \"[[Japanese Secret and Special Weapons]]\".\n\n==Natural Resources in occupied areas after 1937==\n===Occupied Chinese Mainland===\nFrom 1937, during the Japanese military occupation of territories in [[China]], they\ncontrolled certain mineral deposits in those areas. They fall into three sectors:\n\nDeposits of tungsten, tin and manganese, also.\n*[[Chekiang]]: coal reserves were 101 million tonnes and extraction 250,000 tonnes in 1934. There were certain soils rich in bauxite.\n\n====South China area====\n*[[Fujian|Fukien]]: coal reserves of 500 million tonnes in 1934.\n*[[Kwantung]] (Canton): 421 million tonnes of coal reserves, and production was 338,000 tonnes in 1934.

Deposits of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], [[copper]], [[antimony]], and [[sulphur]] also.\n\n===South East Asia===\nThis zone when conquered by Japanese forces added further resources and strategic points. This had formed part of Japanese Navy plans to expand into the '[[South Sea lands]]'.\n*[[Burma]]: in the [[Ayeyarwady River|Irrawaddy river]] zone, there were the [[Yenangyaung]] and [[Chauk]] oil fields, 300 miles (500&nbsp;km) north of [[Rangoon]].

Affordability is only one factor. There is evidence of food security being a concern many thousands of years ago, with central authorities in [[ancient China]] and [[ancient Egypt]] being known to release food from storage in times of famine. At the 1974 [[World Food Conference]] the term \"food security\" was defined with an emphasis on supply. They said food security is the \"availability at all times of adequate, nourishing, diverse, balanced and moderate world food supplies of basic foodstuffs to sustain a steady expansion of food consumption and to offset fluctuations in production and prices\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Trade Reforms and Food Security: Conceptualizing the Linkages|date=2003 |publisher=FAO, UN|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/y4671e/y4671e06.htm}}</ref> Later definitions added demand and access issues to the definition.

The 20th century has examples of governments, as in [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union]] or the [[Great Leap Forward]] in the [[People's Republic of China]] undermining the food security of their own nations.  Mass starvation is frequently a weapon of war, as in the [[blockade of Germany]], the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], and the [[blockade of Japan]] during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] and in the [[Hunger Plan]] enacted by [[Nazi Germany]].\n\nGovernments sometimes have a narrow base of support, built upon [[cronyism]] and [[patronage]]. [[Fred Cuny]] pointed out in 1999 that under these conditions: \"The distribution of food within a country is a political issue. Governments in most countries give priority to urban areas, since that is where the most influential and powerful families and enterprises are usually located. The government often neglects subsistence farmers and rural areas in general. The more remote and underdeveloped the area the less likely the government will be to effectively meet its needs. Many agrarian policies, especially the pricing of agricultural [[commodities]], discriminate against rural areas. Governments often keep prices of basic grains at such artificially low levels that subsistence producers cannot accumulate enough capital to make investments to improve their production. Thus, they are effectively prevented from getting out of their precarious situation.\"<ref>[[Fred Cuny]]\u2013Famine, Conflict, and Response: a Basic Guide; Kumarian Press, 1999.</ref>\n\nSocialist governments have used food as a political weapon, rewarding supporters while denying food supplies to areas that oppose their rule.<ref>{{cite news |last1=MERIDITH KOHUT |last2=ISAYEN HERRERA |title=As Venezuela Collapses, Children Are Dying of Hunger. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/17/world/americas/venezuela-children-starving.html |accessdate=17 February 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=17 February 2019 |quote=government has used food to keep the Socialists in power, critics say.

When the [[rule of law]] is absent, or [[private property]] is non-existent, farmers have little incentive to improve their productivity.{{according to whom|date=October 2014}} If a farm becomes noticeably more productive than neighboring farms, it may become the target of individuals well connected to the government. Rather than risk being noticed and possibly losing their land, farmers may be content with the perceived safety of mediocrity.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n===Food sovereignty===\nThe approach known as [[food sovereignty]] views the business practices of multinational corporations as a form of [[neocolonialism]]. It contends that multinational corporations have the financial resources available to buy up the agricultural resources of impoverished nations, particularly in the tropics. They also have the political clout to convert these resources to the exclusive production of [[cash crops]] for sale to [[industrialized nations]] outside of the tropics, and in the process to squeeze the poor off of the more productive lands.<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\" /> Under this view, [[Subsistence farming|subsistence farmers]] are left to cultivate only lands that are so marginal in terms of productivity as to be of no interest to the multinational corporations. Likewise, food sovereignty holds it to be true that communities should be able to define their own means of production and that food is a basic human right. With several multinational corporations now pushing agricultural technologies on developing countries, technologies that include improved seeds, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides, crop production has become an increasingly analyzed and debated issue.\n\n===Food waste===\n{{See also|Food waste}}\nFood waste may be diverted for alternative human consumption when economic variables allow for it. The waste of consumable food is even gaining attention from large food conglomerates. For instance, due to low food prices, simply discarding irregular carrots has typically been more cost-effective than spending money on the extra labor or machinery necessary to handle them. A juice factory in the Netherlands, however, has developed a process to efficiently divert and use previously rejected carrots, and its parent company is expanding this innovation to plants in Great Britain.<ref>''Food Savers''.

It is a project to organize 21 rice exporting countries to create a homonymous organisation to control the price of rice. The group is mainly made up of Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. The organization attempts to serve the purpose of making a \"contribution to ensuring food stability, not just in an individual country but also to address food shortages in the region and the world\". However, it is still questionable whether this organization will serve its role as an effective rice price fixing cartel, that is similar to OPEC's mechanism for managing petroleum. Economic analysts and traders said the proposal would go nowhere because of the inability of governments to cooperate with each other and control farmers' output. Moreover, countries that are involved expressed their concern that this could only worsen the food security.<ref>[http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/news/stories/200804/s2232076.htm?tab=asia Mekong nations to form rice price-fixing cartel] Radio Australia, April 30, 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080824102712/http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/news/stories/200804/s2232076.htm?tab=asia |date=August 24, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/News/01May2008_news07.php|title=&#124;Bangkok Post&#124;May 1, 2008&#124;PM floats idea of five-nation rice cartel}}</ref><ref>[http://www.orecinternational.org/ Welcome to OREC \u2013 Rice for Life].

However, women face discrimination in access to land, credit, technologies, finance and other services. Empirical studies suggest that if women had the same access to productive resources as men, women could boost their yields by 20\u201330%, raising the overall agricultural output in developing countries by 2.5 to 4%.

The genome of these crops can be altered to address one or more aspects of the plant that may be preventing it from being grown in various regions under certain conditions. Many of these alterations can address the challenges that were previously mentioned above, including the water crisis, land degradation, and the ever-changing climate.\n\nIn agriculture and [[animal husbandry]], the [[Green Revolution]] popularized the use of conventional [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]ization to increase yield by creating [[high-yielding varieties]]. Often, the handful of hybridized breeds originated in developed countries and were further hybridized with local varieties in the rest of the developing world to create high yield strains resistant to local climate and diseases.\n\nThe area sown to genetically engineered crops in developing countries is rapidly catching up with the area sown in industrial nations. According to the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA), GM crops were grown by approximately 8.5 million farmers in 21 countries in 2005; up from 8.25 million farmers in 17 countries in 2004.\n\n=== Opposition to GM crops ===\nSome scientists question the safety of biotechnology as a panacea; agroecologists [[Miguel Altieri]] and Peter Rosset have enumerated ten reasons<ref name=\"altros\">{{cite journal|last2=Rosset|first2=Peter|year=1999|title=Ten Reasons Why Biotechnology Will Not Help the Developing World|url=|journal=AgBioForum|volume=2|issue=3&4|pages=155\u201362|last1=Altieri|first1=Miguel A.}}</ref> why biotechnology will not ensure food security, protect the environment, or reduce poverty. Reasons include:\n* There is no relationship between the prevalence of hunger in a given country and its population\n* Most innovations in agricultural biotechnology have been profit-driven rather than need-driven\n* Ecological theory predicts that the large-scale landscape homogenization with transgenic crops will exacerbate the ecological problems already associated with monoculture agriculture\n* And, that much of the needed food can be produced by small farmers located throughout the world using existing agroecological technologies.\n\nBased on evidence from previous attempts, there is a likely lack of transferability of one type of GM crop from one region to another. For example, modified crops that have proven successful in Asia from the Green Revolution have failed when tried in regions of Africa.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Klara|date=2016-07-01|title=Why new crop technology is not scale-neutral\u2014A critique of the expectations for a crop-based African Green Revolution|journal=Research Policy|volume=45|issue=6|pages=1185\u20131194|doi=10.1016/j.respol.2016.03.007}}</ref> More research must be done regarding the specific requirements of growing a specific crop in a specific region.\n\nThere is also a drastic lack of education given to governments, farmers, and the community about the science behind GM crops, as well as suitable growing practices. In most relief programs, farmers are given seeds with little explanation and little attention is paid to the resources available to them or even laws that prohibit them from distributing produce. Governments are often not advised on the economic and health implications that come with growing GM crops, and are then left to make judgments on their own. Because they have so little information regarding these crops, they usually shy away from allowing them or do not take the time and effort required to regulate their use. Members of the community that will then consume the produce from these crops are also left in the dark about what these modifications mean and are often scared off by their 'unnatural' origins. This has resulted in failure to properly grow crops as well as strong opposition to the unknown practices.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pathways to productivity: The role of GMOs for food security in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda|last=Wedding|first=K.|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nA study published in June 2016 evaluated the status of the implementation of [[Golden rice|Golden Rice]], which was first developed in the 1990s to produce higher levels of Vitamin A than its non-GMO counterparts.

The first Millennium Development Goal states that the UN \"is to eradicate extreme hunger and poverty\" by 2015.<ref name=\"IFPRI 2003\" /> Olivier De Schutter, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, advocates for a multidimensional approach to food security challenges. This approach emphasizes the physical availability of food; the social, economic and physical access people have to food; and the nutrition, safety and cultural appropriateness or adequacy of food.<ref>{{cite web|last=De Schutter|first=Olivier|title=Report submitted by the Special Rapporteur on the right to food|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/food/docs/A-HRC-16-49.pdf|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=22 October 2013|pages=1\u201321|date=December 2010}}</ref>\n\n====By the Food and Agriculture Organization====\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations stated in ''The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2003'' that countries that have reduced hunger often had rapid economic growth, specifically in their [[agriculture|agricultural sectors]].

In ''The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2012'', the FAO restated its focus on [[economic growth]] and agricultural growth to achieve food security and added a focus on the poor and on \"nutrition-sensitive\" growth. For example, economic growth should be used by governments to provide public services to benefit poor and hungry populations. The FAO also cited smallholders, including women, as groups that should be involved in agricultural growth to generate employment for the poor. For economic and agricultural growth to be \"nutrition-sensitive\", resources should be utilized to improve access to diverse diets for the poor as well as access to a safe [[water supply]] and to healthcare.<ref name=\"FAO, WFP, IFAD 2012\" />\n\nThe FAO has proposed a \"twin track\" approach to fight food insecurity that combines sustainable development and short-term hunger relief. Development approaches include investing in rural markets and rural infrastructure.<ref name=\"FAO\" /> In general, the FAO proposes the use of public policies and programs that promote long-term economic growth that will benefit the poor. To obtain short-term food security, [[vouchers]] for seeds, [[fertilizer]], or access to services could promote agricultural production. The use of conditional or unconditional food or cash transfers was another approach the FAO noted. Conditional transfers could include [[school feeding in low-income countries|school feeding programs]], while unconditional transfers could include general food distribution, [[aid|emergency food aid]] or cash transfers. A third approach is the use of [[Subsidy|subsidies]] as safety nets to increase the purchasing power of households. The FAO stated that \"approaches should be human rights-based, target the poor, promote gender equality, enhance long-term resilience and allow sustainable graduation out of poverty.\"<ref name=\"FAO, WFP, IFAD 2012\" />\n\nThe FAO noted that some countries have been successful in fighting food insecurity and decreasing the number of people suffering from undernourishment. Bangladesh is an example of a country that has met the Millennium Development Goal hunger target. The FAO credited growth in agricultural productivity and macroeconomic stability for the rapid economic growth in the 1990s that resulted in an increase in food security.

According to Tim Josling, a Senior Fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, [[Stanford University]], food stamps or other methods of distribution of purchasing power directly to consumers might fit into the range of international programs under consideration to tackle food insecurity.<ref name=\"josling\">[http://ictsd.org/downloads/2011/12/global-food-stamps-an-idea-worth-considering.pdf Global Food Stamps: An Idea Worth Considering], August 2011, ICTSD, Issue Paper No.36.</ref>\n\n===Improving agricultural productivity to benefit the rural poor===\n[[File:Africa Food Security 15 (10665294293).jpg|thumb|right|A farmer on the outskirts of [[Lilongwe]] ([[Malawi]]) prepares a field for planting.]]\nThere are strong, direct relationships between agricultural productivity, hunger, poverty, and sustainability. Three-quarters of the world's poor live in rural areas and make their living from agriculture. Hunger and child [[malnutrition]] are greater in these areas than in urban areas. Moreover, the higher the proportion of the rural population that obtains its income solely from subsistence farming (without the benefit of pro-poor technologies and access to markets), the higher the incidence of malnutrition. Therefore, improvements in agricultural productivity aimed at small-scale farmers will benefit the rural poor first. Food and feed crop demand is likely to double in the next 50 years, as the global population approaches nine billion. Growing sufficient food will require people to make changes such as increasing productivity in areas dependent on [[rainfed agriculture]]; improving [[soil]] fertility management; expanding cropped areas; investing in [[irrigation]]; conducting agricultural trade between countries; and reducing gross food demand by influencing diets and reducing post-harvest losses.\n\nAccording to the [[Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture]], a major study led by the [[International Water Management Institute]] (IWMI), managing rainwater and [[soil moisture]] more effectively, and using supplemental and small-scale irrigation, hold the key to helping the greatest number of poor people. It has called for a new era of water investments and policies for upgrading rainfed agriculture that would go beyond controlling field-level soil and water to bring new freshwater sources through better local management of rainfall and runoff.<ref>Molden, D. (Ed). ''Water for food, Water for life: [[A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture]].'' Earthscan/IWMI, 2007.</ref> Increased agricultural productivity enables farmers to grow more food, which translates into better diets and, under market conditions that offer a level playing field, into higher farm incomes. With more money, farmers are more likely to diversify production and grow higher-value crops, benefiting not only themselves but the economy as a whole.<ref name=\"IFPRI 2003\">{{cite book|title=Agriculture, Food Security, Nutrition, and the Millennium Development Goals: Annual Report Essay|year=2003|publisher=IFPRI|url=http://www.ifpri.org/publication/agriculture-food-security-nutrition-and-millenium-development-goals|author1=Joachim von Braun |author2=M.S.

They do so by contributing premium to an insurance fund, which will indemnify those who suffer insured loss. This procedure reduces the risk for an individual by spreading his/her risk among the multiple fund contributors. Insurance can be designed to protect many types of individuals and assets against single or multiple perils and buffer insured parties against sudden and dramatic income or asset loss.\n\nCrop insurance is purchased by agricultural producers to protect themselves against either the loss of their crops due to natural disasters. Two type of insurances are available:<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = de Leeuw | first1 = Jan | last2 = Vrieling | first2 = Anton | last3 = Shee | first3 = Apurba | last4 = Atzberger | first4 = Clement | last5 = Hadgu | first5 = Kiros M. | last6 = Biradar | first6 = Chandrashekhar M. | last7 = Keah | first7 = Humphrey | last8 = Turvey | first8 = Calum | year = 2014 | title = The Potential and Uptake of Remote Sensing in Insurance: A Review | url = | journal = Remote Sensing | volume = 6 | issue = 11| pages = 10888\u201310912 | doi = 10.3390/rs61110888 | bibcode = 2014RemS....610888D }}</ref> claim-based insurances and index-based insurances. In particular, in poor countries facing food security problems, index-based insurances offer some advantages, including indices that can be derived from globally available satellite images that correlate well with what is insured. These indices can be delivered at low cost, and the insurance products open up new markets that are not served by claim-based insurances.{{relevance inline|date=November 2015}}\n\nAn advantage of index-based insurance is that it can potentially be delivered at lower cost. A significant barrier that hinders uptake of claim-based insurance is the high transaction cost for searching for prospective policyholders, negotiating and administering contracts, verifying losses and determining payouts. Index insurance eliminates the loss verification step, thereby mitigating a significant transaction cost. A second advantage of index-based insurance is that, because it pays an indemnity based on the reading of an index rather than individual losses, it eliminates much of the fraud, moral hazard and adverse selection, which are common in classical claim-based insurance. A further advantage of index insurance is that payments based on a standardized and indisputable index also allow for a fast indemnity payment. The indemnity payment could be automated, further reducing transaction costs.{{relevance inline|date=November 2015}}\n\nBasis risk is a major disadvantage of index-based insurance. It is the situation where an individual experiences a loss without receiving payment or vice versa. Basis risk is a direct result of the strength of the relation between the index that estimates the average loss by the insured group and the loss of insured assets by an individual. The weaker this relation the higher the basis risk. High basis risk undermines the willingness of potential clients to purchase insurance. It thus challenges insurance companies to design insurances such as to minimize basis risk.{{relevance inline|date=November 2015}}\n\n=== Food Justice Movement ===\n{{Main|Food Justice Movement}}\nThe Food Justice Movement has been seen as a unique and multifaceted movement with relevance to the issue of food security. It has been described as a movement about social-economic and political problems in connection to [[environmental justice]], improved nutrition and health, and activism. Today, a growing number of individuals and minority groups are embracing the Food Justice due to the perceived increase in hunger within nations such as the United States as well as the amplified effect of food insecurity on many minority communities, particularly the Black and Latino communities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hilmers|first=Angela|last2=Hilmers|first2=David C.|last3=Dave|first3=Jayna|date=2017-04-24|title=Neighborhood Disparities in Access to Healthy Foods and Their Effects on Environmental Justice|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=102|issue=9|pages=1644\u20131654|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2012.300865|issn=0090-0036| pmc=3482049 |pmid=22813465}}</ref>\n\nA number of organizations have either championed the Food Justice Cause or greatly impacted the Food Justice space. An example of a prominent organization within the food justice movement has been the [[Coalition of Immokalee Workers]], which is a worker-based human rights organization that has been recognized globally for its accomplishments in the areas of human trafficking, social responsibility and gender-based violence at work. The Coalition of Immoaklee Workers most prominent accomplishment related to the food justice space has been its part in implementing the [[Fair Food Program]], which increased the pay and bettered working conditions of farm workers in the [[tomato industry]] who had been exploited for generations. This accomplishment provided over 30,000 workers more income and the ability to access better and more healthy foods for themselves and their families. Another organization in the food justice space is the Fair Food Network, an organization that has embraced the mission of helping families who need healthy food gain access to it while also increasing the livelihoold for farmers in America and growing local economies. Started by [[Oran B. Hesterman|Oran B.

At the 1974 [[World Food Conference]] the term \"food security\" was defined with an emphasis on supply.

The 20th century has examples of governments, as in [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union]] or the [[Great Leap Forward]] in the [[People's Republic of China]] undermining the food security of their own nations.  Mass starvation is frequently a weapon of war, as in the [[blockade of Germany]], the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], and the [[blockade of Japan]] during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] and in the [[Hunger Plan]] enacted by [[Nazi Germany]].\n\nGovernments sometimes have a narrow base of support, built upon [[cronyism]] and [[patronage]]. [[Fred Cuny]] pointed out in 1999 that under these conditions: \"The distribution of food within a country is a political issue. Governments in most countries give priority to urban areas, since that is where the most influential and powerful families and enterprises are usually located. The government often neglects subsistence farmers and rural areas in general. The more remote and underdeveloped the area the less likely the government will be to effectively meet its needs. Many agrarian policies, especially the pricing of agricultural [[commodities]], discriminate against rural areas. Governments often keep prices of basic grains at such artificially low levels that subsistence producers cannot accumulate enough capital to make investments to improve their production. Thus, they are effectively prevented from getting out of their precarious situation.\"<ref>[[Fred Cuny]]\u2013Famine, Conflict, and Response: a Basic Guide; Kumarian Press, 1999.</ref>\n\nSocialist governments have used food as a political weapon, rewarding supporters while denying food supplies to areas that oppose their rule.<ref>{{cite news |last1=MERIDITH KOHUT |last2=ISAYEN HERRERA |title=As Venezuela Collapses, Children Are Dying of Hunger. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/17/world/americas/venezuela-children-starving.html |accessdate=17 February 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=17 February 2019 |quote=government has used food to keep the Socialists in power, critics say.

When the [[rule of law]] is absent, or [[private property]] is non-existent, farmers have little incentive to improve their productivity.{{according to whom|date=October 2014}} If a farm becomes noticeably more productive than neighboring farms, it may become the target of individuals well connected to the government. Rather than risk being noticed and possibly losing their land, farmers may be content with the perceived safety of mediocrity.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n===Food sovereignty===\nThe approach known as [[food sovereignty]] views the business practices of multinational corporations as a form of [[neocolonialism]]. It contends that multinational corporations have the financial resources available to buy up the agricultural resources of impoverished nations, particularly in the tropics. They also have the political clout to convert these resources to the exclusive production of [[cash crops]] for sale to [[industrialized nations]] outside of the tropics, and in the process to squeeze the poor off of the more productive lands.<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\" /> Under this view, [[Subsistence farming|subsistence farmers]] are left to cultivate only lands that are so marginal in terms of productivity as to be of no interest to the multinational corporations. Likewise, food sovereignty holds it to be true that communities should be able to define their own means of production and that food is a basic human right. With several multinational corporations now pushing agricultural technologies on developing countries, technologies that include improved seeds, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides, crop production has become an increasingly analyzed and debated issue.\n\n===Food waste===\n{{See also|Food waste}}\nFood waste may be diverted for alternative human consumption when economic variables allow for it. The waste of consumable food is even gaining attention from large food conglomerates. For instance, due to low food prices, simply discarding irregular carrots has typically been more cost-effective than spending money on the extra labor or machinery necessary to handle them. A juice factory in the Netherlands, however, has developed a process to efficiently divert and use previously rejected carrots, and its parent company is expanding this innovation to plants in Great Britain.<ref>''Food Savers''.

It is a project to organize 21 rice exporting countries to create a homonymous organisation to control the price of rice. The group is mainly made up of Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. The organization attempts to serve the purpose of making a \"contribution to ensuring food stability, not just in an individual country but also to address food shortages in the region and the world\". However, it is still questionable whether this organization will serve its role as an effective rice price fixing cartel, that is similar to OPEC's mechanism for managing petroleum.

The genome of these crops can be altered to address one or more aspects of the plant that may be preventing it from being grown in various regions under certain conditions. Many of these alterations can address the challenges that were previously mentioned above, including the water crisis, land degradation, and the ever-changing climate.\n\nIn agriculture and [[animal husbandry]], the [[Green Revolution]] popularized the use of conventional [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]ization to increase yield by creating [[high-yielding varieties]]. Often, the handful of hybridized breeds originated in developed countries and were further hybridized with local varieties in the rest of the developing world to create high yield strains resistant to local climate and diseases.\n\nThe area sown to genetically engineered crops in developing countries is rapidly catching up with the area sown in industrial nations. According to the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA), GM crops were grown by approximately 8.5 million farmers in 21 countries in 2005; up from 8.25 million farmers in 17 countries in 2004.\n\n=== Opposition to GM crops ===\nSome scientists question the safety of biotechnology as a panacea; agroecologists [[Miguel Altieri]] and Peter Rosset have enumerated ten reasons<ref name=\"altros\">{{cite journal|last2=Rosset|first2=Peter|year=1999|title=Ten Reasons Why Biotechnology Will Not Help the Developing World|url=|journal=AgBioForum|volume=2|issue=3&4|pages=155\u201362|last1=Altieri|first1=Miguel A.}}</ref> why biotechnology will not ensure food security, protect the environment, or reduce poverty. Reasons include:\n* There is no relationship between the prevalence of hunger in a given country and its population\n* Most innovations in agricultural biotechnology have been profit-driven rather than need-driven\n* Ecological theory predicts that the large-scale landscape homogenization with transgenic crops will exacerbate the ecological problems already associated with monoculture agriculture\n* And, that much of the needed food can be produced by small farmers located throughout the world using existing agroecological technologies.\n\nBased on evidence from previous attempts, there is a likely lack of transferability of one type of GM crop from one region to another. For example, modified crops that have proven successful in Asia from the Green Revolution have failed when tried in regions of Africa.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Klara|date=2016-07-01|title=Why new crop technology is not scale-neutral\u2014A critique of the expectations for a crop-based African Green Revolution|journal=Research Policy|volume=45|issue=6|pages=1185\u20131194|doi=10.1016/j.respol.2016.03.007}}</ref> More research must be done regarding the specific requirements of growing a specific crop in a specific region.\n\nThere is also a drastic lack of education given to governments, farmers, and the community about the science behind GM crops, as well as suitable growing practices. In most relief programs, farmers are given seeds with little explanation and little attention is paid to the resources available to them or even laws that prohibit them from distributing produce. Governments are often not advised on the economic and health implications that come with growing GM crops, and are then left to make judgments on their own. Because they have so little information regarding these crops, they usually shy away from allowing them or do not take the time and effort required to regulate their use. Members of the community that will then consume the produce from these crops are also left in the dark about what these modifications mean and are often scared off by their 'unnatural' origins. This has resulted in failure to properly grow crops as well as strong opposition to the unknown practices.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pathways to productivity: The role of GMOs for food security in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda|last=Wedding|first=K.|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nA study published in June 2016 evaluated the status of the implementation of [[Golden rice|Golden Rice]], which was first developed in the 1990s to produce higher levels of Vitamin A than its non-GMO counterparts.

The first Millennium Development Goal states that the UN \"is to eradicate extreme hunger and poverty\" by 2015.<ref name=\"IFPRI 2003\" /> Olivier De Schutter, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, advocates for a multidimensional approach to food security challenges. This approach emphasizes the physical availability of food; the social, economic and physical access people have to food; and the nutrition, safety and cultural appropriateness or adequacy of food.<ref>{{cite web|last=De Schutter|first=Olivier|title=Report submitted by the Special Rapporteur on the right to food|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/food/docs/A-HRC-16-49.pdf|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=22 October 2013|pages=1\u201321|date=December 2010}}</ref>\n\n====By the Food and Agriculture Organization====\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations stated in ''The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2003'' that countries that have reduced hunger often had rapid economic growth, specifically in their [[agriculture|agricultural sectors]]. These countries were also characterized as having slower [[population growth]], lower HIV rates, and higher rankings in the [[Human Development Index]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The State of Food Security in the World 2003|url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/006/j0083e/j0083e00.pdf|publisher=FAO|accessdate=31 October 2013|author=FAO|year=2003}}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> At that time, the FAO considered addressing agriculture and population growth vital to achieving food security. In ''The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2012'', the FAO restated its focus on [[economic growth]] and agricultural growth to achieve food security and added a focus on the poor and on \"nutrition-sensitive\" growth. For example, economic growth should be used by governments to provide public services to benefit poor and hungry populations. The FAO also cited smallholders, including women, as groups that should be involved in agricultural growth to generate employment for the poor. For economic and agricultural growth to be \"nutrition-sensitive\", resources should be utilized to improve access to diverse diets for the poor as well as access to a safe [[water supply]] and to healthcare.<ref name=\"FAO, WFP, IFAD 2012\" />\n\nThe FAO has proposed a \"twin track\" approach to fight food insecurity that combines sustainable development and short-term hunger relief. Development approaches include investing in rural markets and rural infrastructure.<ref name=\"FAO\" /> In general, the FAO proposes the use of public policies and programs that promote long-term economic growth that will benefit the poor. To obtain short-term food security, [[vouchers]] for seeds, [[fertilizer]], or access to services could promote agricultural production. The use of conditional or unconditional food or cash transfers was another approach the FAO noted. Conditional transfers could include [[school feeding in low-income countries|school feeding programs]], while unconditional transfers could include general food distribution, [[aid|emergency food aid]] or cash transfers. A third approach is the use of [[Subsidy|subsidies]] as safety nets to increase the purchasing power of households. The FAO stated that \"approaches should be human rights-based, target the poor, promote gender equality, enhance long-term resilience and allow sustainable graduation out of poverty.\"<ref name=\"FAO, WFP, IFAD 2012\" />\n\nThe FAO noted that some countries have been successful in fighting food insecurity and decreasing the number of people suffering from undernourishment. Bangladesh is an example of a country that has met the Millennium Development Goal hunger target. The FAO credited growth in agricultural productivity and macroeconomic stability for the rapid economic growth in the 1990s that resulted in an increase in food security. [[Irrigation systems]] were established through infrastructure development programs. Two programs, HarvestPlus and the Golden Rice Project, provided [[Biofortification|biofortified crops]] in order to decrease micronutrient deficiencess.<ref name=\"FAO, WFP, IFAD 2013\" />\n\n[[World Food Day]] was established on October 16, in honor of the date that the FAO was founded in 1945. On this day, the FAO hosts a variety of event at the headquarters in Rome and around the world, as well as seminars with UN officials.<ref name=\"UN World Food Day\" />\n\n====By the World Food Programme====\n[[File:WalktheWorldLogo.jpg|thumb|right|Fight Hunger: Walk the World campaign is a United Nations [[World Food Programme]] initiative.]]\nThe [[World Food Programme]] (WFP) is an agency of the United Nations that uses [[food aid]] to promote food security and eradicate hunger and poverty. In particular, the WFP provides food aid to refugees and to others experiencing food emergencies. It also seeks to improve nutrition and quality of life to the most vulnerable populations and promote self-reliance.<ref name=\"WFP Mission Statement\">{{cite web|last=WFP|title=Mission Statement|url=http://www.wfp.org/about/mission-statement|publisher=WFP|accessdate=2 November 2013}}</ref> An example of a WFP program is the \"Food For Assets\" program in which participants work on new infrastructure, or learn new skills, that will increase food security, in exchange for food.<ref>{{cite web|last=WFP|title=Food For Assets|url=http://www.wfp.org/food-assets|accessdate=26 November 2013}}</ref> The WFP and the Government of Kenya have partnered in the Food For Assets program in hopes of increasing the resilience of communities to shocks.<ref>{{cite web|last=WFP and Republic of Kenya|title=Cash/Food For Assets|url=http://ffa.kenyafoodsecurity.org|accessdate=26 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213044451/http://ffa.kenyafoodsecurity.org/|archivedate=13 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Global partnerships to achieve food security and end hunger===\nIn April 2012, the [[Food Assistance Convention]] was signed, the world's first legally binding international agreement on food aid. The May 2012 [[Copenhagen Consensus]] recommended that efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition should be the first priority for politicians and private sector philanthropists looking to maximize the effectiveness of aid spending. They put this ahead of other priorities, like the fight against [[malaria]] and [[AIDS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Projects/CC12/Outcome.aspx|title=Outcome - Copenhagen Consensus Center|website=www.copenhagenconsensus.com}}</ref>\n\nThe main global policy to reduce hunger and poverty are the recently approved [[Sustainable Development Goals]].

Current agricultural yields are insufficient to feed the growing populations. Eventually, the rising agricultural productivity drives economic growth.\n* Securing property rights and [[access to finance]]\n* Enhancing [[human capital]] through education and improved health\n* Conflict prevention and resolution mechanisms and democracy and governance based on principles of accountability and transparency in public institutions and the rule of law are basic to reducing vulnerable members of society.\n\nSince the 1960s, the U.S. has been implementing a food stamp program (now called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) to directly target consumers who lack the income to purchase food. According to Tim Josling, a Senior Fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, [[Stanford University]], food stamps or other methods of distribution of purchasing power directly to consumers might fit into the range of international programs under consideration to tackle food insecurity.<ref name=\"josling\">[http://ictsd.org/downloads/2011/12/global-food-stamps-an-idea-worth-considering.pdf Global Food Stamps: An Idea Worth Considering], August 2011, ICTSD, Issue Paper No.36.</ref>\n\n===Improving agricultural productivity to benefit the rural poor===\n[[File:Africa Food Security 15 (10665294293).jpg|thumb|right|A farmer on the outskirts of [[Lilongwe]] ([[Malawi]]) prepares a field for planting.]]\nThere are strong, direct relationships between agricultural productivity, hunger, poverty, and sustainability. Three-quarters of the world's poor live in rural areas and make their living from agriculture. Hunger and child [[malnutrition]] are greater in these areas than in urban areas. Moreover, the higher the proportion of the rural population that obtains its income solely from subsistence farming (without the benefit of pro-poor technologies and access to markets), the higher the incidence of malnutrition. Therefore, improvements in agricultural productivity aimed at small-scale farmers will benefit the rural poor first. Food and feed crop demand is likely to double in the next 50 years, as the global population approaches nine billion. Growing sufficient food will require people to make changes such as increasing productivity in areas dependent on [[rainfed agriculture]]; improving [[soil]] fertility management; expanding cropped areas; investing in [[irrigation]]; conducting agricultural trade between countries; and reducing gross food demand by influencing diets and reducing post-harvest losses.\n\nAccording to the [[Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture]], a major study led by the [[International Water Management Institute]] (IWMI), managing rainwater and [[soil moisture]] more effectively, and using supplemental and small-scale irrigation, hold the key to helping the greatest number of poor people. It has called for a new era of water investments and policies for upgrading rainfed agriculture that would go beyond controlling field-level soil and water to bring new freshwater sources through better local management of rainfall and runoff.<ref>Molden, D. (Ed). ''Water for food, Water for life: [[A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture]].'' Earthscan/IWMI, 2007.</ref> Increased agricultural productivity enables farmers to grow more food, which translates into better diets and, under market conditions that offer a level playing field, into higher farm incomes. With more money, farmers are more likely to diversify production and grow higher-value crops, benefiting not only themselves but the economy as a whole.<ref name=\"IFPRI 2003\">{{cite book|title=Agriculture, Food Security, Nutrition, and the Millennium Development Goals: Annual Report Essay|year=2003|publisher=IFPRI|url=http://www.ifpri.org/publication/agriculture-food-security-nutrition-and-millenium-development-goals|author1=Joachim von Braun |author2=M.S.

They do so by contributing premium to an insurance fund, which will indemnify those who suffer insured loss. This procedure reduces the risk for an individual by spreading his/her risk among the multiple fund contributors. Insurance can be designed to protect many types of individuals and assets against single or multiple perils and buffer insured parties against sudden and dramatic income or asset loss.\n\nCrop insurance is purchased by agricultural producers to protect themselves against either the loss of their crops due to natural disasters. Two type of insurances are available:<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = de Leeuw | first1 = Jan | last2 = Vrieling | first2 = Anton | last3 = Shee | first3 = Apurba | last4 = Atzberger | first4 = Clement | last5 = Hadgu | first5 = Kiros M. | last6 = Biradar | first6 = Chandrashekhar M. | last7 = Keah | first7 = Humphrey | last8 = Turvey | first8 = Calum | year = 2014 | title = The Potential and Uptake of Remote Sensing in Insurance: A Review | url = | journal = Remote Sensing | volume = 6 | issue = 11| pages = 10888\u201310912 | doi = 10.3390/rs61110888 | bibcode = 2014RemS....610888D }}</ref> claim-based insurances and index-based insurances. In particular, in poor countries facing food security problems, index-based insurances offer some advantages, including indices that can be derived from globally available satellite images that correlate well with what is insured. These indices can be delivered at low cost, and the insurance products open up new markets that are not served by claim-based insurances.{{relevance inline|date=November 2015}}\n\nAn advantage of index-based insurance is that it can potentially be delivered at lower cost. A significant barrier that hinders uptake of claim-based insurance is the high transaction cost for searching for prospective policyholders, negotiating and administering contracts, verifying losses and determining payouts. Index insurance eliminates the loss verification step, thereby mitigating a significant transaction cost. A second advantage of index-based insurance is that, because it pays an indemnity based on the reading of an index rather than individual losses, it eliminates much of the fraud, moral hazard and adverse selection, which are common in classical claim-based insurance. A further advantage of index insurance is that payments based on a standardized and indisputable index also allow for a fast indemnity payment. The indemnity payment could be automated, further reducing transaction costs.{{relevance inline|date=November 2015}}\n\nBasis risk is a major disadvantage of index-based insurance. It is the situation where an individual experiences a loss without receiving payment or vice versa. Basis risk is a direct result of the strength of the relation between the index that estimates the average loss by the insured group and the loss of insured assets by an individual. The weaker this relation the higher the basis risk. High basis risk undermines the willingness of potential clients to purchase insurance. It thus challenges insurance companies to design insurances such as to minimize basis risk.{{relevance inline|date=November 2015}}\n\n=== Food Justice Movement ===\n{{Main|Food Justice Movement}}\nThe Food Justice Movement has been seen as a unique and multifaceted movement with relevance to the issue of food security. It has been described as a movement about social-economic and political problems in connection to [[environmental justice]], improved nutrition and health, and activism. Today, a growing number of individuals and minority groups are embracing the Food Justice due to the perceived increase in hunger within nations such as the United States as well as the amplified effect of food insecurity on many minority communities, particularly the Black and Latino communities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hilmers|first=Angela|last2=Hilmers|first2=David C.|last3=Dave|first3=Jayna|date=2017-04-24|title=Neighborhood Disparities in Access to Healthy Foods and Their Effects on Environmental Justice|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=102|issue=9|pages=1644\u20131654|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2012.300865|issn=0090-0036| pmc=3482049 |pmid=22813465}}</ref>\n\nA number of organizations have either championed the Food Justice Cause or greatly impacted the Food Justice space. An example of a prominent organization within the food justice movement has been the [[Coalition of Immokalee Workers]], which is a worker-based human rights organization that has been recognized globally for its accomplishments in the areas of human trafficking, social responsibility and gender-based violence at work. The Coalition of Immoaklee Workers most prominent accomplishment related to the food justice space has been its part in implementing the [[Fair Food Program]], which increased the pay and bettered working conditions of farm workers in the [[tomato industry]] who had been exploited for generations. This accomplishment provided over 30,000 workers more income and the ability to access better and more healthy foods for themselves and their families.

The second chicane was also re-profiled.  In the Formula 1 Grand Prix of the same year, the first to use these new chicanes, a fire marshal, Paolo Gislimberti, was killed by flying debris after a big pileup at the second chicane.<ref name=Clarin/>\n\nIn 2007, the run-off area at the second chicane was changed from gravel to asphalt. The length of the track in its current configuration is {{convert|5.793|km|3}}.<ref name=F1.comLap/> At the [[2010 Monza Superbike World Championship round]], Italian rider [[Max Biaggi]] set the fastest ever motorcycle lap of Monza when he rode his [[Aprilia RSV 4|Aprilia RSV4 1000 F]] to pole position in a time of 1:42.121. In the Superpole qualification for the 2011 race, he improved on this lap time, for a new lap record of 1:41.745 and his speed was captured at 205+ MPH.\n\nIn late 2016, work was planned on a new first bend, which would have bypassed the first chicane and the Curva Grande. Drivers were to go through a fast right hand kink entering the old Pirelli circuit and into a new, faster chicane. Work was planned for to be completed by 2017 in hopes of a renewed contract for Formula 1. Gravel would have also returned to the run-off area at the Parabolica bend.<ref name=Monza2017>{{cite web|title=New Monza over a second faster for F1 \u2013 and Parabolica gravel will return|url=http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2016/06/01/new-monza-second-quicker-f1-cars-2017/|publisher=F1 Fanatic|date=1 June 2016|accessdate=11 June 2016}}</ref> However, plans for the track's change were suspended due to the track being in the historic [[Monza Park]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==A lap of the circuit in a Formula One car==\n[[File:Autodromo Nazionale Monza, April 22, 2018 SkySat (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Satellite photograph of the circuit from 2018]]\n[[File:Autodromo Monza.jpg|thumb|The {{convert|1.12|km|yd|3|abbr=on}} start/finish straight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mclaren.com/formula1/2015/italian-grand-prix/2015-italian-grand-prix-preview/|title=McLaren Formula 1 - 2015 Italian Grand Prix Preview|publisher=McLaren|accessdate=12 January 2016}}</ref>]]\nMonza consists of very long straights and tight chicanes, putting a premium on good braking stability and traction.  The {{convert|5.793|km|3}}<ref name=F1.comLap/> circuit is very hard on gearboxes, with many gear changes per lap. Formula 1 engines are at full throttle for nearly 80% of the lap, with engine failures common, notably [[Fernando Alonso]] in the [[2006 Italian Grand Prix]].\n\nFormula One cars are set up with one of the smallest wing angles on the F1 calendar to ensure the lowest level of drag on the straights. There are only 6 corner complexes at Monza: the first two chicanes, the two ''Lesmos'', the ''Ascari'' complex and the ''Parabolica''. Thus cars are set up for maximum performance on the straights.\n\nCars approach the first corner at {{convert|340|km/h}} in eighth gear,<ref name=F1.comLap/> and brake at about {{convert|120|m}} before the first chicane \u2013 the ''Variante del Rettifilo'' \u2013 entering at {{convert|86|km/h|abbr=on}} in first gear, and exiting at {{convert|74|km/h}} in second gear.<ref name=F1.comLap/> This is the scene of many first lap accidents. Higher kerbs were installed at the first two chicanes in 2009 to prevent cutting.<ref name=\"The Official Formula 1 Website\">{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2009/9/9881.html|title=Bigger kerbs installed for Monza chicanes|publisher=formula 1.com|date=8 September 2009|accessdate=21 September 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091004215814/http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2009/9/9881.html| archivedate= 4 October 2009 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nGood traction out of the first corner is imperative for a quick lap. Conservation of speed through the first chicane is made possible by driving the straightest line, as a small mistake here can result in a lot of time being lost through the ''Curva Grande'' down to the ''Variante della Roggia'' chicane in seventh gear, at {{convert|330|km/h}}.<ref name=F1.comLap/> The braking point is just under the bridge. The kerbs are very vicious and it is very easy for a car to become unbalanced and a driver to lose control, as [[Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen]] did in 2005. This chicane is probably the best overtaking chance on the lap, as it is the only one with the \"slow corner, long straight, slow corner\"; one of the characteristics of modern circuits.\n[[File:Monza aerial photo.jpg|thumb|Aerial photo of the Autodromo of Monza, with the village of Villasanta in the upper part. The city of Monza is southwards off to the right of the photo.]]\n\nThe ''Curve di Lesmo'' are two corners that are not as fast as they used to be, but are still challenging corners. The first is blind, entered at {{convert|264|km/h|abbr=on}} in fifth gear, dropping to fourth gear at {{convert|193|km/h|abbr=on}},<ref name=F1.comLap/> and has a slight banking. The second is a fifth gear entry at {{convert|260|km/h|abbr=on}}, apexing in third gear at {{convert|178|km/h}},<ref name=F1.comLap/> and it is very important that all the kerb is used. A mistake at one of these corners will result in a spin into the gravel, while good exits can set you up for an overtaking move into ''Variante Ascari''.\n\nThe downhill straight down to ''Variante Ascari'' is very bumpy under the bridge. ''Variante Ascari'' is a very tricky sequence of corners and is key to the lap time.\n\nThe final challenge is the ''Curva Parabolica'': approaching at {{convert|335|km/h}} in seventh gear,<ref name=F1.comLap/> cars quickly dance around the corner, apexing in fourth gear at {{convert|215|km/h}}<ref name=F1.comLap/> and exiting in fifth gear at {{convert|285|km/h}},<ref name=F1.comLap/> accelerating onto the main start/finish straight. A good exit and slipstream off a fellow driver along the main straight can produce an overtaking opportunity under heavy braking into ''Variante del Rettifilo;'' however, it is difficult to follow a leading car closely through the ''Parabolica'' as the tow will reduce downforce and cornering speed.\n\nMaximum speed achieved in a 2019 Formula One car is {{convert|359.7|km/h|abbr=on}}, achieved at the end of the start/finish straight.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fia.com/file/94332/download |title=Formula 1 Gran Premio Heineken d'Italia 2019 \u2013 Race Maximum Speeds |publisher=FIA |date=8

The {{convert|5.793|km|3}}<ref name=F1.comLap/> circuit is very hard on gearboxes, with many gear changes per lap. Formula 1 engines are at full throttle for nearly 80% of the lap, with engine failures common, notably [[Fernando Alonso]] in the [[2006 Italian Grand Prix]].\n\nFormula One cars are set up with one of the smallest wing angles on the F1 calendar to ensure the lowest level of drag on the straights. There are only 6 corner complexes at Monza: the first two chicanes, the two ''Lesmos'', the ''Ascari'' complex and the ''Parabolica''. Thus cars are set up for maximum performance on the straights.\n\nCars approach the first corner at {{convert|340|km/h}} in eighth gear,<ref name=F1.comLap/> and brake at about {{convert|120|m}} before the first chicane \u2013 the ''Variante del Rettifilo'' \u2013 entering at {{convert|86|km/h|abbr=on}} in first gear, and exiting at {{convert|74|km/h}} in second gear.<ref name=F1.comLap/> This is the scene of many first lap accidents. Higher kerbs were installed at the first two chicanes in 2009 to prevent cutting.<ref name=\"The Official Formula 1 Website\">{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2009/9/9881.html|title=Bigger kerbs installed for Monza chicanes|publisher=formula 1.com|date=8 September 2009|accessdate=21 September 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091004215814/http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2009/9/9881.html| archivedate= 4 October 2009 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nGood traction out of the first corner is imperative for a quick lap. Conservation of speed through the first chicane is made possible by driving the straightest line, as a small mistake here can result in a lot of time being lost through the ''Curva Grande'' down to the ''Variante della Roggia'' chicane in seventh gear, at {{convert|330|km/h}}.<ref name=F1.comLap/> The braking point is just under the bridge. The kerbs are very vicious and it is very easy for a car to become unbalanced and a driver to lose control, as [[Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen]] did in 2005. This chicane is probably the best overtaking chance on the lap, as it is the only one with the \"slow corner, long straight, slow corner\"; one of the characteristics of modern circuits.\n[[File:Monza aerial photo.jpg|thumb|Aerial photo of the Autodromo of Monza, with the village of Villasanta in the upper part. The city of Monza is southwards off to the right of the photo.]]\n\nThe ''Curve di Lesmo'' are two corners that are not as fast as they used to be, but are still challenging corners. The first is blind, entered at {{convert|264|km/h|abbr=on}} in fifth gear, dropping to fourth gear at {{convert|193|km/h|abbr=on}},<ref name=F1.comLap/> and has a slight banking. The second is a fifth gear entry at {{convert|260|km/h|abbr=on}}, apexing in third gear at {{convert|178|km/h}},<ref name=F1.comLap/> and it is very important that all the kerb is used. A mistake at one of these corners will result in a spin into the gravel, while good exits can set you up for an overtaking move into ''Variante Ascari''.\n\nThe downhill straight down to ''Variante Ascari'' is very bumpy under the bridge. ''Variante Ascari'' is a very tricky sequence of corners and is key to the lap time.\n\nThe final challenge is the ''Curva Parabolica'': approaching at {{convert|335|km/h}} in seventh gear,<ref name=F1.comLap/> cars quickly dance around the corner, apexing in fourth gear at {{convert|215|km/h}}<ref name=F1.comLap/> and exiting in fifth gear at {{convert|285|km/h}},<ref name=F1.comLap/> accelerating onto the main start/finish straight. A good exit and slipstream off a fellow driver along the main straight can produce an overtaking opportunity under heavy braking into ''Variante del Rettifilo;'' however, it is difficult to follow a leading car closely through the ''Parabolica'' as the tow will reduce downforce and cornering speed.\n\nMaximum speed achieved in a 2019 Formula One car is {{convert|359.7|km/h|abbr=on}}, achieved at the end of the start/finish straight.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fia.com/file/94332/download |title=Formula 1 Gran Premio Heineken d'Italia 2019 \u2013 Race Maximum Speeds |publisher=FIA |date=8

Following some violent attacks on African-Americans in downtown State College in 1988 and complaints that Penn State was not adequately recruiting African-American faculty and students to representative population levels, student activists occupied Old Main and demanded that Penn State do more to recruit minority students and address intolerance toward minority students on campus, as well as in the local community.  After President Bryce Jordan canceled a promised meeting with students and organizations in the Paul Robeson Cultural Center on April 8, 1988, 250 students and activists nonviolently occupied Penn State's Telecommunications building on campus. The following morning, 50 state troopers and 45 local and campus police, equipped with helmets, batons, and rubber gloves, entered the building as the crowd outside sang \"We Shall Overcome\", arresting 89 individuals for trespassing.<ref>''[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]]''.

With more than 200 faculty in 15 departments, 4 colleges, and 2 Department of Defense research laboratories, MRI was designed to break down the academic walls that traditionally divide disciplines and thereby enable faculty to collaborate across departmental and even college boundaries. MRI has become a model for this interdisciplinary approach to research, both within and outside the university. Dr. Richard E. Tressler was an international leader in the development of high-temperature materials. He pioneered high-temperature fiber testing and use, advanced instrumentation and test methodologies for thermostructural materials, and design and performance verification of ceramics and composites in high-temperature aerospace, industrial and energy applications. He was founding director of the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) which supported many faculty and students from the College of Earth and Mineral Science, the Eberly College of Science, the College of Engineering, the Materials Research Laboratory and the Applied Research Laboratories at Penn State on high-temperature materials.

Following some violent attacks on African-Americans in downtown State College in 1988 and complaints that Penn State was not adequately recruiting African-American faculty and students to representative population levels, student activists occupied Old Main and demanded that Penn State do more to recruit minority students and address intolerance toward minority students on campus, as well as in the local community.  After President Bryce Jordan canceled a promised meeting with students and organizations in the Paul Robeson Cultural Center on April 8, 1988, 250 students and activists nonviolently occupied Penn State's Telecommunications building on campus. The following morning, 50 state troopers and 45 local and campus police, equipped with helmets, batons, and rubber gloves, entered the building as the crowd outside sang \"We Shall Overcome\", arresting 89 individuals for trespassing.<ref>''[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]]''.

With more than 200 faculty in 15 departments, 4 colleges, and 2 Department of Defense research laboratories, MRI was designed to break down the academic walls that traditionally divide disciplines and thereby enable faculty to collaborate across departmental and even college boundaries. MRI has become a model for this interdisciplinary approach to research, both within and outside the university. Dr. Richard E. Tressler was an international leader in the development of high-temperature materials. He pioneered high-temperature fiber testing and use, advanced instrumentation and test methodologies for thermostructural materials, and design and performance verification of ceramics and composites in high-temperature aerospace, industrial and energy applications. He was founding director of the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) which supported many faculty and students from the College of Earth and Mineral Science, the Eberly College of Science, the College of Engineering, the Materials Research Laboratory and the Applied Research Laboratories at Penn State on high-temperature materials.
