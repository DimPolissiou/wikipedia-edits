Wells, mmn = Morris</ref> in Surrey. In 1940, Ted Wells sent young Julia to live with her mother and stepfather, who the elder Wells thought would be better able to provide for his talented daughter's artistic training. According to her 2008 autobiography ''Home'', while Julie had been used to calling Ted Andrews \"Uncle Ted\", her mother suggested it would be more appropriate to refer to her stepfather as \"Pop\", while her father remained \"Dad\" or \"Daddy\" to her. Julie disliked this change.\n\nThe Andrews family was \"very poor\" and they \"lived in a bad slum area of London,\" Andrews recalled, adding, \"That was a very black period in my life.\" According to Andrews, her stepfather was violent and an alcoholic.<ref name=\"Brockes2008-03-30\" /> Ted Andrews twice, while drunk, tried to get into bed with his stepdaughter, resulting in Andrews fitting a lock on her door.<ref name=\"Brockes2008-03-30\" /> As the stage career of Ted and Barbara Andrews improved, they were able to afford to move to better surroundings, first to [[Beckenham]] and then, as the war ended, back to the Andrews' hometown of [[Hersham]]. The Andrews family took up residence at the Old Meuse, in West Grove, Hersham, a house (now demolished) where Andrews' maternal grandmother had served as a maid.<ref name=\"windeler20\" />\n\nAndrews' stepfather sponsored lessons for her, first at the Cone-Ripman School (now known commonly as [[Arts Educational Schools, London|ArtsEd]]), an independent arts educational school in London, then with concert soprano and voice instructor Madame [[Lilian Stiles-Allen]]. \"She had an enormous influence on me\", Andrews said of Stiles-Allen, adding, \"She was my third mother&nbsp;\u2013 I've got more mothers and fathers than anyone in the world.\" In her memoir ''Julie Andrews \u2013 My Star Pupil'', Stiles-Allen records, \"The range, accuracy and tone of Julie's voice amazed me ... she had possessed the rare gift of [[absolute pitch]]\",<ref>Stirling, Richard; Julie Andrews: An Intimate Biography; Portrait, 2007; {{ISBN|978-0-7499-5135-1}}; p. 22</ref> though Andrews herself refutes this in her 2008 autobiography ''Home''.<ref name=\"spindle1\" /><ref name=\"windeler22\">Windeler (1970), pp. 22\u201323</ref> According to Andrews, \"Madame was sure that I could do Mozart and Rossini, but, to be honest, I never was\".<ref name=\"Stirling24\">Stirling, p. 24</ref> Of her own voice, she says, \"I had a very pure, white, thin voice, a four-octave range \u2013 dogs would come from miles around.\"<ref name=\"Stirling24\" /> After Cone-Ripman School, Andrews continued her academic education at the nearby Woodbrook School, a local state school in Beckenham.<ref>Timothy White (1998) ''The Entertainers'' p. 111.

In 1940, Ted Wells sent young Julia to live with her mother and stepfather, who the elder Wells thought would be better able to provide for his talented daughter's artistic training. According to her 2008 autobiography ''Home'', while Julie had been used to calling Ted Andrews \"Uncle Ted\", her mother suggested it would be more appropriate to refer to her stepfather as \"Pop\", while her father remained \"Dad\" or \"Daddy\" to her. Julie disliked this change.\n\nThe Andrews family was \"very poor\" and they \"lived in a bad slum area of London,\" Andrews recalled, adding, \"That was a very black period in my life.\" According to Andrews, her stepfather was violent and an alcoholic.<ref name=\"Brockes2008-03-30\" /> Ted Andrews twice, while drunk, tried to get into bed with his stepdaughter, resulting in Andrews fitting a lock on her door.<ref name=\"Brockes2008-03-30\" /> As the stage career of Ted and Barbara Andrews improved, they were able to afford to move to better surroundings, first to [[Beckenham]] and then, as the war ended, back to the Andrews' hometown of [[Hersham]].

Andrews made her professional solo debut at the [[London Hippodrome]] singing the difficult aria \"Je suis Titania\" from ''[[Mignon]]'' as part of a musical revue called \"Starlight Roof\" on 22 October 1947.

When a young Andrews was taken by her parents to be examined by a [[ENT specialist|throat specialist]], the doctor concluded that she had \"an almost adult [[larynx]].\"<ref name=\":0\" /> In spite of the fact that her voice teacher, English soprano [[Lilian Stiles-Allen]], continually encouraged her to pursue opera, Andrews herself felt that her voice was unsuited for the genre and \"too big a stretch\". At the time, Andrews described her own voice as \"extremely high and thin\", feeling that it lacked \"the necessary guts and weight for opera\", preferring musical theatre instead. As Andrews aged, so did her voice, which began to naturally deepen. Losing her vast upper register, her \"top notes\" became increasingly difficult to sing while \"her middle register matured into the warm golden tone\" for which she has become known, according to Tim Wong of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url = http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/culture/timwong/100075040/julie-andrews-the-operatic-sensation-that-never-was/|title = Julie Andrews, the operatic sensation that never was|date = 26 May 2014|accessdate = 23 August 2014|website = The Daily Telegraphy|publisher = Telegraph Media Group Limited|last = Wong|first = Tim|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160306122658/http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/culture/timwong/100075040/julie-andrews-the-operatic-sensation-that-never-was/|archive-date = 6 March 2016|url-status=dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nMusically, Andrews had always preferred singing music that was \"bright and sunny\", choosing to avoid songs that were sad, depressing, upsetting, or written in a minor key, for fear of losing her voice \"in a mess of emotion\".

He argued (against conventional wisdom) that money was not the creation of governments. Markets emerged, in his view, out of the division of labor, by which individuals began to specialize in specific crafts and hence had to depend on others for subsistence goods. These goods were first exchanged by barter. Specialization depended on trade, but was hindered by the \"[[double coincidence of wants]]\" which barter requires, i.e., for the exchange to occur, each participant must want what the other has. To complete this hypothetical history, craftsmen would stockpile one particular good, be it salt or metal, that they thought no one would refuse. This is the origin of money according to Smith. Money, as a universally desired medium of exchange, allows each half of the transaction to be separated.<ref name=\"Graeber-p21-41\">{{cite book|author= [[David Graeber]]|title= Debt: the first 5,000 years|url= https://archive.org/details/debtfirst5000yea00grae|url-access= registration|year= 2011|publisher= Melville House|location= New York|pages= [https://archive.org/details/debtfirst5000yea00grae/page/21 21\u201341]}}</ref>\n\nBarter is characterized in Adam Smith's \"''[[The Wealth of Nations]]''\" by a disparaging vocabulary: \"haggling, swapping, dickering.\" It has also been characterized as negative reciprocity, or \"selfish profiteering.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Barter, Exchange and Value: An Anthropological Approach|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=3|authorlink=Introduction|editor=Humphrey, Carolyn and Stephen Hugh-Jones}}</ref>\n\nAnthropologists have argued, in contrast, \"that when something resembling barter ''does'' occur in stateless societies it is almost always between strangers.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of our Dreams|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|page=154}}</ref> Barter occurred between strangers, not fellow villagers, and hence cannot be used to naturalistically explain the origin of money without the state.

[[Olaus Magnus]], 1555]]\nOther anthropologists have questioned whether barter is typically between \"total\" strangers, a form of barter known as \"silent trade\". Silent trade, also called silent barter, dumb barter (\"dumb\" here used in its old meaning of \"mute\"), or depot trade, is a method by which [[Merchant|traders]] who cannot speak each other's [[language]] can trade without talking. However, Benjamin Orlove has shown that while barter occurs through \"silent trade\" (between strangers), it also occurs in commercial markets as well. \"Because barter is a difficult way of conducting trade, it will occur only where there are strong institutional constraints on the use of money or where the barter symbolically denotes a special social relationship and is used in well-defined conditions. To sum up, multipurpose money in markets is like lubrication for machines - necessary for the most efficient function, but not necessary for the existence of the market itself.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Economic Anthropology|year=1989|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|pages=179|author=Plattner, Stuart|authorlink=Markets and Marketplaces|editor=Plattner, Stuart}}</ref>\n\nIn his analysis of barter between coastal and inland villages in the [[Trobriand Islands]], Keith Hart highlighted the difference between highly ceremonial gift exchange between community leaders, and the barter that occurs between individual households. The haggling that takes place between strangers is possible because of the larger temporary political order established by the gift exchanges of leaders. From this he concludes that barter is \"an atomized interaction predicated upon the presence of society\" (i.e. that social order established by gift exchange), and not typical between complete strangers.<ref>{{cite book|last=M. Bloch|first=J. Parry|title=Money and the Morality of Exchange|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=10}}</ref>\n\n===Times of monetary crisis===\n\nAs Orlove noted, barter may occur in commercial economies, usually during periods of monetary crisis. During such a crisis, currency may be in short supply, or highly devalued through hyperinflation. In such cases, money ceases to be the universal medium of exchange or standard of value. Money may be in such short supply that it becomes an item of barter itself rather than the means of exchange. Barter may also occur when people cannot afford to keep money (as when hyperinflation quickly devalues it).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Humphrey|first=Caroline|title=Barter and Economic Disintegration|journal=Man|year=1985|volume=20|issue=1|page=52|doi=10.2307/2802221}}</ref>\n\nAn example of this would be during the [[Crisis in Bolivarian Venezuela]], when Venezuelans resorted to bartering as a result of hyperinflation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-barter/fish-for-flour-barter-is-the-new-currency-in-collapsing-venezuela-idUSKBN1JT1UM?il=0|title=Fish for flour?

All of these strategies are found in ancient economies including Ptolemaic Egypt. They are also the basis for more recent barter exchange systems.<ref>{{cite book|title=Trade and Market in Early Empires|year=1957|publisher=The Free Press|location=Glencoe, Illinois|page=14|author=Polanyi, Karl|authorlink=Marketless Trading in Hammurabi's Time|editor=Polanyi, Karl|display-editors=etal}}</ref>\n\nWhile one-to-one bartering is practiced between individuals and businesses on an informal basis, organized barter exchanges have developed to conduct third party bartering which helps overcome some of the limitations of barter. A barter exchange operates as a broker and bank in which each participating member has an account that is debited when purchases are made, and credited when sales are made.\n\nModern barter and trade has evolved considerably to become an effective method of increasing sales, conserving cash, moving inventory, and making use of excess production capacity for businesses around the world. Businesses in a barter earn trade credits (instead of cash) that are deposited into their account. They then have the ability to purchase goods and services from other members utilizing their trade credits \u2013 they are not obligated to purchase from those whom they sold to, and vice versa. The exchange plays an important role because they provide the record-keeping, brokering expertise and monthly statements to each member. Commercial exchanges make money by charging a commission on each transaction either all on the buy side, all on the sell side, or a combination of both. Transaction fees typically run between 8 and 15%.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole paragraph.|date=May 2019}}\n\nThroughout the 18th century, retailers began to abandon the prevailing system of bartering. Retailers operating out of the Palais complex in Paris, France were among the first in Europe to abandon the bartering, and adopt fixed-prices thereby sparing their clientele the hassle of bartering. The Palais retailers stocked luxury goods that appealed to the wealthy elite and upper middle classes. Stores were fitted with long glass exterior windows which allowed the emerging middle-classes to window shop and indulge in fantasies, even when they may not have been able to afford the high retail prices. Thus, the Palais-Royal became one of the first examples of a new style of shopping arcade, which adopted the trappings of a sophisticated, modern shopping complex and also changed pricing structures, for both the aristocracy and the middle classes.<ref>Byrne-Paquet, L., ''The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping,'' ECW Press, Toronto, Canada, pp. 90\u201393</ref>\n\n==== Utopian socialism ====\n{{Main article|Utopian socialism}}\n[[File:LaborNote.JPG|thumb|right|350px|A 19th-century example of barter: A sample labor for labor note for the [[Cincinnati Time Store]]. Scanned from ''Equitable Commerce'' by [[Josiah Warren]] (1846)]]\n\nThe Owenite socialists in Britain and the United States in the 1830s were the first to attempt to organize barter exchanges. Owenism developed a \"theory of equitable exchange\" as a critique of the exploitative wage relationship between capitalist and labourer, by which all profit accrued to the capitalist. To counteract the uneven playing field between employers and employed, they proposed \"schemes of labour notes based on labour time, thus institutionalizing Owen's demand that human labour, not money, be made the standard of value.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=John|title=Quest for the New Moral World: Robert Owen and the Owenites in Britain and America|url=https://archive.org/details/questfornewmoral00harr|url-access=registration|year=1969|publisher=Charles Scibners Sons|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/questfornewmoral00harr/page/72 72]}}</ref> This alternate currency eliminated price variability between markets, as well as the role of merchants who bought low and sold high. The system arose in a period where paper currency was an innovation. Paper currency was an [[I.O.U.|IOU]] circulated by a bank (a promise to pay, not a payment in itself). Both merchants and an unstable paper currency created difficulties for direct producers.\n\nAn alternate currency, denominated in labour time, would prevent profit taking by middlemen; all goods exchanged would be priced only in terms of the amount of labour that went into them as expressed in the maxim '[[Cost the limit of price]]'. It became the basis of exchanges in London, and in America, where the idea was implemented at the [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]] communal settlement by [[Josiah Warren]] in 1826, and in his Cincinnati 'Time store' in 1827. Warren ideas were adopted by other Owenites and currency reformers, even though the labour exchanges were relatively short lived.<ref>{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=John|title=Quest for the New Moral World: Robert Owen and the Owenites in Britain and America|url=https://archive.org/details/questfornewmoral00harr|url-access=registration|year=1969|publisher=Charles Scibners Sons|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/questfornewmoral00harr/page/73 73]}}</ref>\n\nIn England, about 30 to 40 cooperative societies sent their surplus goods to an \"exchange bazaar\" for direct barter in London, which later adopted a similar labour note.

Corporate barter exchanges typically use media and advertising as leverage for their larger transactions.  It entails the use of a currency unit called a \"trade-credit\".  The trade-credit must not only be known and guaranteed but also be valued in an amount the media and advertising could have been purchased for had the \"client\" bought it themselves (contract to eliminate ambiguity and risk).{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nSoviet [[bilateral trade]] is occasionally called \"barter trade\", because although the purchases were denominated in U.S. dollars, the transactions were credited to an international [[clearing account]], avoiding the use of hard cash.\n\n==Tax implications==\nIn the United States, [[Karl Hess]] used bartering to make it harder for the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] to seize his wages and as a form of [[tax resistance]].

If one barters for a [[profit (accounting)|profit]], one pays the appropriate tax; if one generates a loss in the transaction, they have a loss.

Markets emerged, in his view, out of the division of labor, by which individuals began to specialize in specific crafts and hence had to depend on others for subsistence goods. These goods were first exchanged by barter. Specialization depended on trade, but was hindered by the \"[[double coincidence of wants]]\" which barter requires, i.e., for the exchange to occur, each participant must want what the other has. To complete this hypothetical history, craftsmen would stockpile one particular good, be it salt or metal, that they thought no one would refuse. This is the origin of money according to Smith. Money, as a universally desired medium of exchange, allows each half of the transaction to be separated.<ref name=\"Graeber-p21-41\">{{cite book|author= [[David Graeber]]|title= Debt: the first 5,000 years|url= https://archive.org/details/debtfirst5000yea00grae|url-access= registration|year= 2011|publisher= Melville House|location= New York|pages= [https://archive.org/details/debtfirst5000yea00grae/page/21 21\u201341]}}</ref>\n\nBarter is characterized in Adam Smith's \"''[[The Wealth of Nations]]''\" by a disparaging vocabulary: \"haggling, haggling, swapping, dickering.\" It has also been characterized as negative reciprocity, or \"selfish profiteering.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Barter, Exchange and Value: An Anthropological Approach|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=3|authorlink=Introduction|editor=Humphrey, Carolyn and Stephen Hugh-Jones}}</ref>\n\nAnthropologists have argued, in contrast, \"that when something resembling barter ''does'' occur in stateless societies it is almost always between strangers.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of our Dreams|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|page=154}}</ref> Barter occurred between strangers, not fellow villagers, and hence cannot be used to naturalistically explain the origin of money without the state.

Silent trade, also called silent barter, dumb barter (\"dumb\" here used in its old meaning of \"mute\"), or depot trade, is a method by which [[Merchant|traders]] who cannot speak each other's [[language]] can trade without talking. However, Benjamin Orlove has shown that while barter occurs through \"silent trade\" (between strangers), it also occurs in commercial markets as well. \"Because barter is a difficult way of conducting trade, it will occur only where there are strong institutional constraints on the use of money or where the barter symbolically denotes a special social relationship and is used in well-defined conditions. To sum up, multipurpose money in markets is like lubrication for machines - necessary for the most efficient function, but not necessary for the existence of the market itself.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Economic Anthropology|year=1989|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|pages=179|author=Plattner, Stuart|authorlink=Markets and Marketplaces|editor=Plattner, Stuart}}</ref>\n\nIn his analysis of barter between coastal and inland villages in the [[Trobriand Islands]], Keith Hart highlighted the difference between highly ceremonial gift exchange between community leaders, and the barter that occurs between individual households. The haggling that takes place between strangers is possible because of the larger temporary political order established by the gift exchanges of leaders. From this he concludes that barter is \"an atomized interaction predicated upon the presence of society\" (i.e. that social order established by gift exchange), and not typical between complete strangers.<ref>{{cite book|last=M.

During such a crisis, currency may be in short supply, or highly devalued through hyperinflation. In such cases, money ceases to be the universal medium of exchange or standard of value. Money may be in such short supply that it becomes an item of barter itself rather than the means of exchange. Barter may also occur when people cannot afford to keep money (as when hyperinflation quickly devalues it).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Humphrey|first=Caroline|title=Barter and Economic Disintegration|journal=Man|year=1985|volume=20|issue=1|page=52|doi=10.2307/2802221}}</ref>\n\nAn example of this would be during the [[Crisis in Bolivarian Venezuela]], when Venezuelans resorted to bartering as a result of hyperinflation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-barter/fish-for-flour-barter-is-the-new-currency-in-collapsing-venezuela-idUSKBN1JT1UM?il=0|title=Fish for flour?

A barter exchange operates as a broker and bank in which each participating member has an account that is debited when purchases are made, and credited when sales are made.\n\nModern barter and trade has evolved considerably to become an effective method of increasing sales, conserving cash, moving inventory, and making use of excess production capacity for businesses around the world. Businesses in a barter earn trade credits (instead of cash) that are deposited into their account. They then have the ability to purchase goods and services from other members utilizing their trade credits \u2013 they are not obligated to purchase from those whom they sold to, and vice versa. The exchange plays an important role because they provide the record-keeping, brokering expertise and monthly statements to each member. Commercial exchanges make money by charging a commission on each transaction either all on the buy side, all on the sell side, or a combination of both. Transaction fees typically run between 8 and 15%.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole paragraph.|date=May 2019}}\n\nThroughout the 18th century, retailers began to abandon the prevailing system of bartering. Retailers operating out of the Palais complex in Paris, France were among the first in Europe to abandon the bartering, and adopt fixed-prices thereby sparing their clientele the hassle of bartering. The Palais retailers stocked luxury goods that appealed to the wealthy elite and upper middle classes. Stores were fitted with long glass exterior windows which allowed the emerging middle-classes to window shop and indulge in fantasies, even when they may not have been able to afford the high retail prices. Thus, the Palais-Royal became one of the first examples of a new style of shopping arcade, which adopted the trappings of a sophisticated, modern shopping complex and also changed pricing structures, for both the aristocracy and the middle classes.<ref>Byrne-Paquet, L., ''The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping,'' ECW Press, Toronto, Canada, pp. 90\u201393</ref>\n\n==== Utopian socialism ====\n{{Main article|Utopian socialism}}\n[[File:LaborNote.JPG|thumb|right|350px|A 19th-century example of barter: A sample labor for labor note for the [[Cincinnati Time Store]].

Both merchants and an unstable paper currency created difficulties for direct producers.\n\nAn alternate currency, denominated in labour time, would prevent profit taking by middlemen; all goods exchanged would be priced only in terms of the amount of labour that went into them as expressed in the maxim '[[Cost the limit of price]]'. It became the basis of exchanges in London, and in America, where the idea was implemented at the [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]] communal settlement by [[Josiah Warren]] in 1826, and in his Cincinnati 'Time store' in 1827.

The largest b2b barter exchange is [[Tradebank]], founded in 1987. P2P bartering has seen a renaissance in major Canadian cities through Bunz - built as a network of Facebook groups that went on to become a stand-alone bartering based app in January 2016. Within the first year, Bunz accumulated over 75,000 users<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-24/maybe-mark-zuckerberg-should-listen-to-these-canadian-hipsters|title=Facebook Is Trying To Build a Successful Online Marketplace.

Corporate barter exchanges typically use media and advertising as leverage for their larger transactions.  It entails the use of a currency unit called a \"trade-credit\".  The trade-credit must not only be known and guaranteed but also be valued in an amount the media and advertising could have been purchased for had the \"client\" bought it themselves (contract to eliminate ambiguity and risk).{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nSoviet [[bilateral trade]] is occasionally called \"barter trade\", because although the purchases were denominated in U.S. dollars, the transactions were credited to an international [[clearing account]], avoiding the use of hard cash.\n\n==Tax implications==\nIn the United States, [[Karl Hess]] used bartering to make it harder for the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] to seize his wages and as a form of [[tax resistance]]. Hess explained how he turned to barter in an [[op-ed]] for ''The New York Times'' in 1975.<ref>{{cite book |title=We Won\u2019t Pay: A Tax Resistance Reader|editor=David M. Gross|year=2008|pages=437\u2013440}}</ref> However the IRS now requires barter exchanges to be reported as per the [[Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982]]. Barter exchanges are considered taxable revenue by the IRS and must be reported on a 1099-B form. According to the IRS, \"The fair market value of goods and services exchanged must be included in the [[income]] of both parties.\"<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc420.html|title=Tax Topics - Topic 420 Bartering Income|publisher=United States Internal Revenue Service|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nOther countries, though, do not have the reporting requirement that the U.S. does concerning proceeds from barter transactions, but taxation is handled the same way as a cash transaction. If one barters for a [[profit (accounting)|profit]], one pays the appropriate tax; if one generates a loss in the transaction, they have a loss. Bartering for business is also taxed accordingly as business income or business expense.  Many barter exchanges require that one register as a business.\n\n==Recent developments==\n\nSince the 1830s, barter in some [[western world | western]] [[market economies]] has been aided by exchanges which use alternative currencies based on the [[labour theory of value]], and which are intended to prevent [[profit taking | profit-taking]] by [[intermediary | intermediaries]]. Examples include the [[Owenite]] socialists, the [[Cincinnati Time Store|Cincinnati Time store]], and more recently{{when?|date=June 2018}} [[Ithaca Hours|Ithaca HOURS]] ([[time banking]]) and the [[Local exchange trading system | LETS system]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Business and economics}}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Collaborative consumption]]\n* [[Complementary currencies]]\n* [[Gift economy]]\n* [[International trade]]\n* [[List of international trade topics]]\n* [[Local exchange trading system]]\n* [[Natural economy]]\n* [[Private currency]]\n* [[Property caretaker]]\n* [[Quid pro quo]]\n* [[Simple living]]\n* [[Trading cards]]\n* [[Time banking]]\n* [[Kanthalloor#Barter system|How barter works in Kanthalloor, India]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commons category-inline|Barter}}\n*{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Barter |volume=3 |short=x}}\n*\n\n{{Means of Exchange}}\n{{simple living}}\n{{tax resistance}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Business terms]]\n[[Category:Cashless society]]\n[[Category:Economic systems]]\n[[Category:Pricing]]\n[[Category:Simple living]]\n[[Category:Tax avoidance]]\n[[Category:Trade]]\n", "name_user": "Marc Lenaerts", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barter"}

Freeman, 1963</ref> In this sense, an OTU is a pragmatic definition to group individuals by similarity, equivalent to but not necessarily in line with classical [[Linnaean taxonomy]] or modern [[evolutionary taxonomy]].\n\nNowadays, however, the term \"OTU\" is also used in a different context and refers to clusters of (uncultivated or unknown) organisms, grouped by DNA sequence similarity of a specific taxonomic marker gene (originally coined as mOTU; molecular OTU).<ref name=\"Blaxter-2005\">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Blaxter | first1 = M. | last2 = Mann | first2 = J. | last3 = Chapman | first3 = T. | last4 = Thomas | first4 = F. | last5 = Whitton | first5 = C. | last6 = Floyd | first6 = R. | last7 = Abebe | first7 = E. | title = Defining operational taxonomic units using DNA barcode data. | journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | volume = 360 | issue = 1462 | pages = 1935\u201343 |date=October 2005 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2005.1725 | pmid = 16214751 | pmc=1609233}}</ref> In other words, OTUs are pragmatic proxies for \"[[species]]\" (microbial or metazoan) at different taxonomic levels, in the absence of traditional systems of [[biological classification]] as are available for macroscopic organisms. For several years, OTUs have been the most commonly used units of diversity, especially when analysing small subunit [[16S rRNA|16S]] (for prokaryotes) or [[18S rRNA]] (for eukaryotes <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sommer|first=Stephanie A.|last2=Woudenberg|first2=Lauren Van|last3=Lenz|first3=Petra H.|last4=Cepeda|first4=Georgina|last5=Goetze|first5=Erica|date=2017|title=Vertical gradients in species richness and community composition across the twilight zone in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre|journal=Molecular Ecology|language=en|volume=26|issue=21|pages=6136\u20136156|doi=10.1111/mec.14286|pmid=28792641|issn=1365-294X|hdl=11336/53966|doi-access=free}}</ref>) marker gene sequence datasets.\n\nSequences can be clustered according to their similarity to one another, and operational taxonomic units are defined based on the similarity threshold (usually 97% similarity; however also 100% similarity is common, also known as [[Amplicon sequence variant|single variants]] <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Porter|first=Teresita M.|last2=Hajibabaei|first2=Mehrdad|date=2018|title=Scaling up: A guide to high-throughput genomic approaches for biodiversity analysis|journal=Molecular Ecology|language=en|volume=27|issue=2|pages=313\u2013338|doi=10.1111/mec.14478|pmid=29292539|issn=1365-294X|doi-access=free}}</ref>) set by the researcher.  It remains debatable how well this commonly-used method recapitulates true microbial species phylogeny or ecology. Although OTUs can be calculated differently when using different algorithms or thresholds, recent research by Schmidt et al. demonstrated that microbial OTUs were generally ecologically consistent across habitats and several OTU clustering approaches.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schmidt|first1=Thomas S.
