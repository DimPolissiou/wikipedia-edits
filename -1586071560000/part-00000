The [[Gila River]] forms in western [[New Mexico]] and flows west across southeastern, south-central, and southwestern Arizona; it changes directions as it progresses across the state, and defines specific areas and valleys. The central portion of the river flows through the southern [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] valley region (the ''[[Salt River (Arizona)|Salt River]] Valley'' joins the Gila River Valley in this area), and the final sections in southwestern Arizona form smaller, irrigated valleys, such as [[Dome Valley]], [[Mohawk Valley (Arizona)|Mohawk Valley]], and [[Hyder Valley]].\n\nTwo mountain ranges are named for the Gila River: the [[Gila Mountains (Graham County)]] bordering the Gila River Valley, northeast of [[Safford, Arizona|Safford]]; the [[Gila Mountains (Yuma County)]] border the Gila River Valley before the Gila River joins its confluence with the [[Colorado River]]; that range is east of [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]] and the [[Fortuna Foothills, Arizona|Fortuna Foothills]].\n\n== Graham County ==\nThe Gila Valley begins as a 35-mile (56&nbsp;km)<!--{{convert|35|mi|km|0}}--> long valley in central [[Graham County, Arizona]].
