Control over the city fluctuated between the [[Chola Empire|Chola Dynasty]] of [[Tamil Nadu]] and the [[Gajapati Kingdom]] of [[Odisha]]<ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\" /> until its conquest by the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] in the 15th century.<ref name=\"history3\" /> In the 16th century it was conquered by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]]. European powers eventually set up trading interests in the city and Visakhapatnam came under [[French India|French]] rule at the end of the 18th century.<ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\" />\n\nThe city was ruled by Andhra Kings of Vengi and Pallavas. The city is named after Sri Vishaka Varma. Legend has it that [[Radha]] and [[Visakha|Vi\u015bakha]] were born on the same day and were equally beautiful. Sri Vishaka Sakhi is the second most important [[gopi]] of the eight main gopis. She carries messages between Radha and Krishna and is the most expert gopi messenger. Local residents believe that an Andhra king built a temple to pay homage to his family deity Vi\u015bakha. This is now inundated under sea water near R K Beach. Another theory is that it is named after a woman disciple of Buddha named [[Visakha|Vi\u015bakha]]. Later it was ruled by [[Qutb Shahi]]s, [[Mughal Empire]] (between 1689 and 1724), [[Nizam]] (1724\u20131757) and France (1757\u20131765) before being captured by the British in 1765. European powers eventually set up trading interests in the city and Visakhapatnam came under [[French India|French]] rule at the end of the 18th century.<ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\" />\n\nThe British captured Visakhapatnam after the 1804 [[Battle of Vizagapatam]] and it remained under [[British Raj|British colonial rule]] until [[Independence of India|India's independence in 1947]] which was a part of the [[Northern Circars]].\n\n=== Buddhist influence ===\n\nHindu texts state that during the fifth century BC, the Visakhapatnam region was part of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] territory, which extended to the [[Godavari River]]. Relics found in the area also prove the existence of a Buddhist empire in the region. Kalinga later lost the territory to [[Ashoka the Great|King Ashoka]] in the bloodiest battle of its time, which prompted Ashoka to embrace [[Buddhism]]. Visakhapatnam is surrounded by ancient Buddhist sites, most of which have been excavated recently and illustrate the legacy of Buddhism in the region.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}\n\n==== Pavurallakonda ====\n[[File:Yaksha Sculpture Relief at Pavurallakonda Buddhist Remnant Site near Bheemunipatnam.jpg|thumb|Yaksha Relief at [[Pavurallakonda]] near [[Bheemunipatnam]]|alt=eramic sculptures of guardian Yakshas]]\n[[Pavurallakonda]] (\"pigeon hill\") is a [[hillock]] west of Bhimli, about {{convert|24|km|abbr=on}} from Visakhapatnam.

The name \"\u015aankaram\" derives from the [[Sangharama]] (temple or monastery). Located {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}} south of Visakhapatnam, it is known locally as [[Bojjannakonda]] and is a significant Buddhist site in Andhra Pradesh. The three major schools of Buddhism (Hinayana, Mahayana and Vajrayana) flourished here. The complex is known for its monolithic [[stupa]]s, rock-cut caves and brick structures. The primary stupa was initially carved out of rock and covered with bricks. Excavations yielded historic pottery and Satavahana coins from the first century AD. At Lingalakonda, there are also rock-cut monolithic stupas in rows spread over the hill. The vihara was active for about 1,000 years.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}\n\nNearby is another Buddhist site, Bojjannakonda, with a number of images of the Buddha carved on the rock face of the caves. At Ligalametta there are hundreds of rock-cut monolithic stupas in rows, spread across the hill.

Here the Buddhist habitation is noticed on a 16&nbsp;ha flat terraced area. The Hinayana school of Buddhism was practised at the monastery between the 3rd century B.C. and the 3rd century A.D. Bavikonda has remains of an entire Buddhist complex, comprising 26 structures belonging to three phases. A piece of bone stored in an urn recovered here is believed to belong to the mortal remains of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]].

It is located {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} from Visakhapatnam and is a significant Buddhist site.\nExcavation carried out from 1982 to 1987 revealed a Buddhist establishment including a mahachaitya embedded with relic caskets,{{Clarify|date=May 2012}} a large vihara complex, numerous votive stupas, a stone-pillared congregation and rectangular halls and a refectory. Artifacts recovered from the site include Roman and [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahana]] coins and pottery dating from the third century BC to the second century AD. A significant finding was a piece of bone (with a large quantity of ash) in an urn, which is believed to be the remains of the [[Buddha]]. The Bavikonda site is considered one of the oldest Buddhist sites in Asia. It is a reminder of the Buddhist civilisation which once existed in southern India, and also reminiscent of [[Borobudur]] in Indonesia.<ref>{{cite web|title=bavikonda|url=http://www.buddhist-tourism.com/countries/india/buddhist-sites/bavikonda-andhra-pradesh.html/|publisher=www.buddhist-tourism.com|accessdate=7 September 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222172341/http://www.buddhist-tourism.com/countries/india/buddhist-sites/bavikonda-andhra-pradesh.html|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==== Thotlakonda ====\n[[File:Mahastupa in Thotlakonda, Visakhapatnam (2).jpg|thumbnail|left|Third-century BC Buddhist ruins of [[Thotlakonda|Totlakonda]]|alt=Corner of light-coloured, angular stone ruins]]\nAbout {{convert|16|km|abbr=on}} from Visakhapatnam is [[Thotlakonda]], a [[Buddhist]] complex situated on top of a hill.

These structures include the Stupa, Chaityagrihas, pillared congregation halls, bhandagaras, refectory (bhojanasala), drainage and stone pathways. The site covers an area of {{convert|120|acre|ha|abbr=off}}, and has been declared a protected area by the government of Andhra Pradesh.

The region was ruled by the [[Eastern Ganga dynasty|Eastern Ganga king]]- SuryaVamsa Kshatriyas and the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapati kings]] of [[Odisha]] from the 10th century to the 16th centuries AD (when the region came under the Visakhapatnam rulers). Based on archaeological evidence, the [[Prabhakar]] and the Eastern Ganga Kings of Odisha built temples in the city in the 11th and 12th centuries. The [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] ruled the area under the Visakhapatnam [[Nizam]] during the late 15th and early 16th centuries. European merchants from France, Holland and the [[East India Company]] used the natural port to export tobacco, [[Paddy (unmilled rice)|paddy]], coal, iron ore, ivory, [[muslin]] and other textile products.\n\nLocal legend tells that an [[Coastal Andhra|Andhra]] king, on his way to [[Varanasi|Benares]], rested at Visakhapatnam and was so enchanted by its beauty that he ordered a temple to be built in honour of his family deity, Vi\u015bakha. Archaeological sources, however, reveal that the temple was probably built between the 11th and 12th centuries by the Cholas. A shipping merchant, Shankarayya Chetty, built one of the mandapams (pillared halls) of the temple. Although it no longer exists (possibly washed away about 100 years ago by a cyclonic storm), elderly residents of Visakhapatnam remember visits to the ancient shrine by their grandparents (although author Ganapatiraju Atchuta Rama Raju denies this).<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/07/15/stories/2002071501150200.htm |title=Vi\u015bakha traces its name to Buddhist princess |publisher=The Hindu |date=15 July 2002 |accessdate=24 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030913214905/http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/07/15/stories/2002071501150200.htm |archive-date=13 September 2003 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 18th century Visakhapatnam was part of the [[Northern Circars]], a region comprising [[coastal Andhra]] and southern coastal Odisha which was first under French control and later British. Visakhapatnam became a district in the [[Madras Presidency]] of [[British India]]. In September 1804, British and French squadrons fought the naval [[Battle of Vizagapatam]] near the harbour. After India's independence it was the largest district in the country and was subsequently divided into the districts of [[Srikakulam]], [[Vizianagaram]] and Visakhapatnam.\n\nPart of the city is known by its colonial British name, Waltair; during the colonial era, the city's hub was the Waltair railway station and a part of the city is still called Waltair.\n\n<gallery caption=\"\" widths=\"220px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Passage Exercise (PASSEX) during International Fleet Review 2016 (01).JPG|International Fleet Review 2016\n</gallery>\n\n== Geography ==\n\n[[File:Boats in Kondakarla ava 2.jpg|thumb|[[Kondakarla Ava]], a bird sanctuary near Visakhapatnam]]\nThe city is situated between the [[Eastern Ghats]] and the [[Bay of Bengal]].<ref name=\"location\" /> The city coordinates lies between 17.7041 N and 83.2977 E.<ref name=\"geo\" /><ref name=\"climate\" />\n\n=== Climate ===\nVisakhapatnam has a [[tropical savanna climate|tropical wet and dry climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Aw'').<ref name=\"climate\" /> The annual mean temperatures ranges between {{Convert|24.7|\u2013|30.6|C|F|0|abbr=on}}, with the maximum in the month of May and the minimum in January; the minimum temperatures ranges between {{Convert|20|\u2013|27|C|F|0|abbr=on}}.

Historically considered part of the [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] region,<ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\" /> it was ruled by the [[Vengi]] kingdom and the [[Pallava Dynasty|Pallava]] and [[Eastern Ganga Dynasty|Eastern Ganga]] dynasties during medieval times.<ref name=\"history3\" /> Archaeological records suggest that the present city was built around the 11th and 12th centuries C.E. by the [[Chola Empire|Chola Dynasty]] king [[Kulothunga Chola I|Kulothunga I]]. Control over the city fluctuated between the [[Chola Empire|Chola Dynasty]] of [[Tamil Nadu]] and the [[Gajapati Kingdom]] of [[Odisha]]<ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\" /> until its conquest by the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] in the 15th century.<ref name=\"history3\" /> In the 16th century it was conquered by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]]. European powers eventually set up trading interests in the city and Visakhapatnam came under [[French India|French]] rule at the end of the 18th century.<ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\" />\n\nThe city was ruled by Andhra Kings of Vengi and Pallavas. The city is named after Sri Vishaka Varma. Legend has it that [[Radha]] and [[Visakha|Vi\u015bakha]] were born on the same day and were equally beautiful. Sri Vishaka Sakhi is the second most important [[gopi]] of the eight main gopis. She carries messages between Radha and Krishna and is the most expert gopi messenger. Local residents believe that an Andhra king built a temple to pay homage to his family deity Vi\u015bakha. This is now inundated under sea water near R K Beach. Another theory is that it is named after a woman disciple of Buddha named [[Visakha|Vi\u015bakha]]. Later it was ruled by [[Qutb Shahi]]s, [[Mughal Empire]] (between 1689 and 1724), [[Nizam]] (1724\u20131757) and France (1757\u20131765) before being captured by the British in 1765. European powers eventually set up trading interests in the city and Visakhapatnam came under [[French India|French]] rule at the end of the 18th century.<ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\" />\n\nThe British captured Visakhapatnam after the 1804 [[Battle of Vizagapatam]] and it remained under [[British Raj|British colonial rule]] until [[Independence of India|India's independence in 1947]] which was a part of the [[Northern Circars]].\n\n=== Buddhist influence ===\n\nHindu texts state that during the fifth century BC, the Visakhapatnam region was part of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] territory, which extended to the [[Godavari River]]. Relics found in the area also prove the existence of a Buddhist empire in the region. Kalinga later lost the territory to [[Ashoka the Great|King Ashoka]] in the bloodiest battle of its time, which prompted Ashoka to embrace [[Buddhism]]. Visakhapatnam is surrounded by ancient Buddhist sites, most of which have been excavated recently and illustrate the legacy of Buddhism in the region.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}\n\n==== Pavurallakonda ====\n[[File:Yaksha Sculpture Relief at Pavurallakonda Buddhist Remnant Site near Bheemunipatnam.jpg|thumb|Yaksha Relief at [[Pavurallakonda]] near [[Bheemunipatnam]]|alt=eramic sculptures of guardian Yakshas]]\n[[Pavurallakonda]] (\"pigeon hill\") is a [[hillock]] west of Bhimli, about {{convert|24|km|abbr=on}} from Visakhapatnam.

The name \"\u015aankaram\" derives from the [[Sangharama]] (temple or monastery). Located {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}} south of Visakhapatnam, it is known locally as [[Bojjannakonda]] and is a significant Buddhist site in Andhra Pradesh. The three major schools of Buddhism (Hinayana, Mahayana and Vajrayana) flourished here. The complex is known for its monolithic [[stupa]]s, rock-cut caves and brick structures. The primary stupa was initially carved out of rock and covered with bricks. Excavations yielded historic pottery and Satavahana coins from the first century AD. At Lingalakonda, there are also rock-cut monolithic stupas in rows spread over the hill. The vihara was active for about 1,000 years.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}\n\nNearby is another Buddhist site, Bojjannakonda, with a number of images of the Buddha carved on the rock face of the caves. At Ligalametta there are hundreds of rock-cut monolithic stupas in rows, spread across the hill. Among other Buddhist attractions are a relic casket, three [[chaitya]] halls, votive platforms, stupas and [[Vajrayana]] sculptures.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}\n{{-}}\n\n==== Bavikonda ====\n[[File:Bavikonda stupas.JPG|thumb|[[Bavikonda]] stupas|alt=Bavikonda Buddhist Complex]]\n\nBavikonda is an important Buddhist heritage site located on a hill about 15&nbsp;km, northeast from Visakhapatnam city. Here the Buddhist habitation is noticed on a 16&nbsp;ha flat terraced area. The Hinayana school of Buddhism was practised at the monastery between the 3rd century B.C. and the 3rd century A.D. Bavikonda has remains of an entire Buddhist complex, comprising 26 structures belonging to three phases. A piece of bone stored in an urn recovered here is believed to belong to the mortal remains of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. The word ''Bavikonda'' in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] means \"a hill of wells\". Fitting its name, Bavikonda is a hill with wells for the collection of rainwater. It is located {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} from Visakhapatnam and is a significant Buddhist site.\nExcavation carried out from 1982 to 1987 revealed a Buddhist establishment including a mahachaitya embedded with relic caskets,{{Clarify|date=May 2012}} a large vihara complex, numerous votive stupas, a stone-pillared congregation and rectangular halls and a refectory. Artifacts recovered from the site include Roman and [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahana]] coins and pottery dating from the third century BC to the second century AD. A significant finding was a piece of bone (with a large quantity of ash) in an urn, which is believed to be the remains of the [[Buddha]]. The Bavikonda site is considered one of the oldest Buddhist sites in Asia. It is a reminder of the Buddhist civilisation which once existed in southern India, and also reminiscent of [[Borobudur]] in Indonesia.<ref>{{cite web|title=bavikonda|url=http://www.buddhist-tourism.com/countries/india/buddhist-sites/bavikonda-andhra-pradesh.html/|publisher=www.buddhist-tourism.com|accessdate=7 September 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222172341/http://www.buddhist-tourism.com/countries/india/buddhist-sites/bavikonda-andhra-pradesh.html|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==== Thotlakonda ====\n[[File:Mahastupa in Thotlakonda, Visakhapatnam (2).jpg|thumbnail|left|Third-century BC Buddhist ruins of [[Thotlakonda|Totlakonda]]|alt=Corner of light-coloured, angular stone ruins]]\nAbout {{convert|16|km|abbr=on}} from Visakhapatnam is [[Thotlakonda]], a [[Buddhist]] complex situated on top of a hill. The Buddhist complex on the Mangamaripeta hilltop, locally known as [[Thotlakonda|Totlakonda]], lies about 16&nbsp;km from Visakhapatnam on Visakhapatnam-Bheemili Beach Road. After its discovery (during an aerial survey), the Government of Andhra Pradesh declared the 48&nbsp;ha site as a protected monument in 1978. Excavations in 1988 to 1992 exposed structural remains and artefacts, classified as Religious, Secular and Civil. These structures include the Stupa, Chaityagrihas, pillared congregation halls, bhandagaras, refectory (bhojanasala), drainage and stone pathways. The site covers an area of {{convert|120|acre|ha|abbr=off}}, and has been declared a protected area by the government of Andhra Pradesh. Excavations have revealed three kinds of structural remains: religious, secular and civil. Structures include a mahastupa, sixteen votive [[stupa]]s, a stone-pillared congregation hall, eleven rock-cut cisterns, well-paved stone pathways, an [[Apse|apsidal]] [[chaitya]]-griha, three round chaitgya-grihas, two votive platforms, ten [[vihara]]s and a kitchen complex with three halls and a refectory (dining hall). Apart from the structures, Buddhist treasures excavated include nine [[Satavahana]] and five Roman silver coins, [[terracotta]] tiles, stucco decorative pieces, sculptured panels, miniature [[stupa]] models in stone, Buddha [[Pada (foot)|padas]] depicted with [[ashtamangala]] symbols (i.e. the eight auspicious symbols of Swastika, Shrivasta, Nandhyavarta, Vardhamanaka, Bhadrasana, Kalasha, Minyugala and Darpan) and early pottery.<ref>{{cite web |title=thotlakonda |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/thotlakonda-as-heritage-tourism-destination/article7329607.ece?ref=slideshow#im-image-3| publisher= The Hindu|accessdate= 18 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Later history ===\n\nThe territory of Visakhapatnam then came under the Andhra rulers of [[Vengi]], and [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukyas]] and [[Pallava dynasty|Pallavas]] ruled the land. The region was ruled by the [[Eastern Ganga dynasty|Eastern Ganga king]]- SuryaVamsa Kshatriyas and the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapati kings]] of [[Odisha]] from the 10th century to the 16th centuries AD (when the region came under the Visakhapatnam rulers). Based on archaeological evidence, the [[Prabhakar]] and the Eastern Ganga Kings of Odisha built temples in the city in the 11th and 12th centuries. The [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] ruled the area under the Visakhapatnam [[Nizam]] during the late 15th and early 16th centuries. European merchants from France, Holland and the [[East India Company]] used the natural port to export tobacco, [[Paddy (unmilled rice)|paddy]], coal, iron ore, ivory, [[muslin]] and other textile products.\n\nLocal legend tells that an [[Coastal Andhra|Andhra]] king, on his way to [[Varanasi|Benares]], rested at Visakhapatnam and was so enchanted by its beauty that he ordered a temple to be built in honour of his family deity, Vi\u015bakha. Archaeological sources, however, reveal that the temple was probably built between the 11th and 12th centuries by the Cholas. A shipping merchant, Shankarayya Chetty, built one of the mandapams (pillared halls) of the temple. Although it no longer exists (possibly washed away about 100 years ago by a cyclonic storm), elderly residents of Visakhapatnam remember visits to the ancient shrine by their grandparents (although author Ganapatiraju Atchuta Rama Raju denies this).<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/07/15/stories/2002071501150200.htm |title=Vi\u015bakha traces its name to Buddhist princess |publisher=The Hindu |date=15 July 2002 |accessdate=24 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030913214905/http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/07/15/stories/2002071501150200.htm |archive-date=13 September 2003 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 18th century Visakhapatnam was part of the [[Northern Circars]], a region comprising [[coastal Andhra]] and southern coastal Odisha which was first under French control and later British. Visakhapatnam became a district in the [[Madras Presidency]] of [[British India]]. In September 1804, British and French squadrons fought the naval [[Battle of Vizagapatam]] near the harbour. After India's independence it was the largest district in the country and was subsequently divided into the districts of [[Srikakulam]], [[Vizianagaram]] and Visakhapatnam.\n\nPart of the city is known by its colonial British name, Waltair; during the colonial era, the city's hub was the Waltair railway station and a part of the city is still called Waltair.\n\n<gallery caption=\"\" widths=\"220px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Passage Exercise (PASSEX) during International Fleet Review 2016 (01).JPG|International Fleet Review 2016\n</gallery>\n\n== Geography ==\n\n[[File:Boats in Kondakarla ava 2.jpg|thumb|[[Kondakarla Ava]], a bird sanctuary near Visakhapatnam]]\nThe city is situated between the [[Eastern Ghats]] and the [[Bay of Bengal]].<ref name=\"location\" /> The city coordinates lies between 17.7041 N and 83.2977 E.<ref name=\"geo\" /><ref name=\"climate\" />\n\n=== Climate ===\nVisakhapatnam has a [[tropical savanna climate|tropical wet and dry climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Aw'').<ref name=\"climate\" /> The annual mean temperatures ranges between {{Convert|24.7|\u2013|30.6|C|F|0|abbr=on}}, with the maximum in the month of May and the minimum in January; the minimum temperatures ranges between {{Convert|20|\u2013|27|C|F|0|abbr=on}}.
