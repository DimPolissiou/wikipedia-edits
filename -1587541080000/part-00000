Ownership of several villages on both sides of the [[de facto]] border were disputed and claimed by both countries. The dispute over the demarcation of the Indo-Bangladeshi border worsened due to the existence of over [[Indo-Bangladesh enclaves|190 enclaves]].\n\nOne of the disputed areas was a small sliver of land near the village of Padua/Pyrdiwah, on the border between Bangladesh and the Indian state of [[Meghalaya]],<ref name=\"Analysis\" /> which during the 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] was used by Indian security forces to train the Bangladeshi [[Mukti Bahini]], who were fighting the [[Pakistani Army]].

It took place around the village of Pyrdiwah (also known as Padua), in the Indian state of Meghalaya <ref name=\"Analysis\" /> which adjoins the Tamabil area of the Bangladesh border in the Sylhet district. In that area, 6.5 kilometres of the border had remained in dispute for the past 30 years, but a [[Status quo]] had been maintained for that period.<ref name=\"Analysis\" />\n\nOn April 15, 2001, <ref name=\"Analysis\" /> approximately 1000 Bangladeshi soldiers <ref name=\"withdrawls\" /> attacked and captured Pyrdiwah village, breaking the [[Status quo]] and forced Indian civilians there to flee.<ref name=\"frl\" /><ref name=\"fline\" /> The Indian BSF post in Pyrdiwah village was surrounded, trapping 31 BSF personnel within. However both sides held their fire and began negotiations. The Bangladeshi soldiers claimed, the village had been illegally occupied by India since Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971.<ref name=\"Analysis\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1285576.stm Analysis: Surprising outbreak of hostilities], ''BBC''</ref><ref name=\"Tension\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1283703.stm Tension along the border], ''BBC''</ref> The Bangladeshi soldiers stated that they were acting on orders from their government and insisted that the BSF personnel vacate the village. The next day, on April 17, Director-General of the Bangladesh Rifles, Fazlur Rahman gave details of the Pyrdiwah thrust and stated \"We have just completed a mission to restore our territory and sovereignty.\" This incident was resolved later without any bloodshed.<ref name=\"itoday\" />\n\nImmediately after the incident at Pyrdiwah, BSF troops along the Bangladesh border were put on alert and intensified border patrolling.<ref name=\"itoday\" /> A few days later, a contingent of BSF troops entered Bangladeshi territory at the village of Boroibari, more than 200&nbsp;km to the west of Padua. Unlike Pyrdiwah, which was an adverse possession - a village inhabited by Indians but one that actually belonged to Bangladesh (pending ratification of the border agreement) - Boraibari bordering Assam lay across a fence. Also, unlike Pyrdiwah, which was neither fenced nor had any pillars to clearly demarcate it, Boraibari was a large village with a population of at least 1,000. Its population had also largely been hostile to India, according to Indian security officials, over incidents of cross border violations by the villagers.\n\nThe intrusion was intended to serve as retaliation for the incident of Padua.<ref name=\"frl\" /><ref name=\"itoday\" /> According to Bangladesh sources, Indian forces launched an early morning attack on their posts in the frontier district of Kurigram \u2013 which lies on the border with Indian state of Assam.<ref name=\"bbc1\" /> \n\nImmediately upon entering Bangladeshi territory the Indian paramilitary personnel were ambushed and disarmed by Bangladeshi soldiers assisted by hundreds of villagers. They were then allegedly tortured and executed, before their bodies were returned to the Indian side. General Gurbachan Jagat of India's Border Security Force claimed that the bodies showed signs of multilation, including strangulation, broken bones, as well as evidence of charring and scalding. <ref name=\"bbc1\" /><ref name=\"cnn1\" /><ref name=\"guardian\" /><ref name=\"assamtribune\" /><ref name=wsws /> The attack also left 3 Bangladeshi border guards dead and 5 injured.About 10,000 civilians fled the area after some 24 were wounded in the exchange of fire.<ref name=\"schendel\">van Schendel, Willem; ''The Wagah Syndrome: Territorial Roots of Contemporary violence in South Asia'', in Basu, Amrita; and Roy, Srirupa ''Violence and Democracy in India'', Seagull Books, Calcutta, 2007, pp. 55-57</ref>\n\nAccording to a [[Bangladeshis|Bangladeshi]] civilian Ruhul Amin's report,In 18 april 2001,at 5:00 AM when some Bangladeshi farmer were going to their field a force of 100+ Indian [[Border Security Force|BSF]] entered into [[Bangladesh]].At first they thought It was a BDR(Now [[Border Guards Bangladesh|BGB]]) patrolling.But they came to the farmers and talk in [[Hindi]] and asked for the location of the nearest [[Border Guards Bangladesh|BDR]] camp.Then they understood that it was Indian [[Border Security Force|BSF]] not Bangladeshi [[Border Guards Bangladesh|BDR]].At that time they afraid and give them a wrong location and came back to the village.A little boy named Minhaz sent a massage to the [[Border Guards Bangladesh|BDR]] camp.When the BSF couldn't find the [[Border Guards Bangladesh|BDR]] camp the give some blank shot and desperately searched for the [[Border Guards Bangladesh|BDR]] camp.Civilians entered to more deep of [[Bangladesh]] with their child and animals.Then [[Director General of Border Guards Bangladesh|director general of BDR]] major general [[A.

Ownership of several villages on both sides of the [[de facto]] border were disputed and claimed by both countries. The dispute over the demarcation of the Indo-Bangladeshi border worsened due to the existence of over [[Indo-Bangladesh enclaves|190 enclaves]].\n\nOne of the disputed areas was a small sliver of land near the village of Padua/Pyrdiwah, on the border between Bangladesh and the Indian state of [[Meghalaya]],<ref name=\"Analysis\" /> which during the 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] was used by Indian security forces to train the Bangladeshi [[Mukti Bahini]], who were fighting the [[Pakistani Army]].

It took place around the village of Pyrdiwah (also known as Padua), in the Indian state of Meghalaya <ref name=\"Analysis\" /> which adjoins the Tamabil area of the Bangladesh border in the Sylhet district. In that area, 6.5 kilometres of the border had remained in dispute for the past 30 years, but a [[Status quo]] had been maintained for that period.<ref name=\"Analysis\" />\n\nOn April 15, 2001, <ref name=\"Analysis\" /> approximately 1000 Bangladeshi soldiers <ref name=\"withdrawls\" /> attacked and captured Pyrdiwah village, breaking the [[Status quo]] and forced Indian civilians there to flee.<ref name=\"frl\" /><ref name=\"fline\" /> The Indian BSF post in Pyrdiwah village was surrounded, trapping 31 BSF personnel within.

The Bangladeshi soldiers claimed, the village had been illegally occupied by India since Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971.<ref name=\"Analysis\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1285576.stm Analysis: Surprising outbreak of hostilities], ''BBC''</ref><ref name=\"Tension\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1283703.stm Tension along the border], ''BBC''</ref> The Bangladeshi soldiers stated that they were acting on orders from their government and insisted that the BSF personnel vacate the village. The next day, on April 17, Director-General of the Bangladesh Rifles, Fazlur Rahman gave details of the Pyrdiwah thrust and stated \"We have just completed a mission to restore our territory and sovereignty.\" This incident was resolved later without any bloodshed.<ref name=\"itoday\" />\n\nImmediately after the incident at Pyrdiwah, BSF troops along the Bangladesh border were put on alert and intensified border patrolling.<ref name=\"itoday\" /> A few days later, a contingent of BSF troops entered Bangladeshi territory at the village of Boroibari, more than 200&nbsp;km to the west of Padua. Unlike Pyrdiwah, which was an adverse possession - a village inhabited by Indians but one that actually belonged to Bangladesh (pending ratification of the border agreement) - Boraibari bordering Assam lay across a fence. Also, unlike Pyrdiwah, which was neither fenced nor had any pillars to clearly demarcate it, Boraibari was a large village with a population of at least 1,000. Its population had also largely been hostile to India, according to Indian security officials, over incidents of cross border violations by the villagers.\n\nThe intrusion was intended to serve as retaliation for the incident of Padua.<ref name=\"frl\" /><ref name=\"itoday\" /> According to Bangladesh sources, Indian forces launched an early morning attack on their posts in the frontier district of Kurigram \u2013 which lies on the border with Indian state of Assam.<ref name=\"bbc1\" /> \n\nImmediately upon entering Bangladeshi territory the Indian paramilitary personnel were ambushed and disarmed by Bangladeshi soldiers assisted by hundreds of villagers. They were then allegedly tortured and executed, before their bodies were returned to the Indian side.

The theory was that plants of the same species would not compete with each other. In natural cycles they did fully compete, which actually stunted growth and resulted in lower yields.\n\nAnother implemented policy (known as \"[[deep plowing]]\") was based on the ideas of Lysenko's colleague Terentiy Maltsev, who encouraged peasants across China to eschew normal [[plowing]] depths of 15\u201320 centimeters and instead plow extremely deeply into the soil (1 to 2 meters). The deep plowing theory stated that the most fertile soil was deep in the earth, and plowing unusually deep would allow extra strong root growth. However, in shallow soil, useless rocks, soil, and sand were driven up instead, burying the fertile topsoil and severely stunting seedling growth.\n\n==== Four Pest Campaign ====\n{{Main Article|Four Pests Campaign}}\n[[File:Tree-Sparrow-2009-16-02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Eurasian tree sparrow]] was the most notable target of the [[Four Pests Campaign]]]]\n\nAdditionally, in the [[Four Pests Campaign]], citizens were called upon to destroy sparrows and other wild birds that ate crop seeds, in order to protect fields. Pest birds were shot down or scared away from landing until dropping in exhaustion. This system failed and resulted in an explosion of the vermin population, especially crop-eating insects, which consequently had no predators.\n\n==== Illusion of superabundance ====\nSince 1957, the [[Communist Party of China]] had began to report excessive production of grains. However, the actual production of grains throughout China was decreasing from 1957\u20131961. For examples,  \n\n* In [[Sichuan Province]], even though the collected grain was decreasing from 1958\u20131961, the numbers reported to the central government kept increasing.<ref name=\"Jisheng2012\">{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=240}}</ref>\n* In [[Gansu]], the grain yield declined by 4,273,000 [[Tonne|tonnes]] from 1957 to 1961.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958-1962|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=126}}</ref>\n\nThis series of events resulted in an \"illusion of superabundance (\u6d6e\u5938\u98ce)\", and the Party believed that they had an excess amount of grains. On the contrary, the crop yields were in fact lower than average. For instance, Beijing believed that \"in 1960 state granaries would have 50 billion ''[[Chinese units of measurement|jin]]'' of grain,\" when they actually contained 12.7 billion ''jin.''<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|author2=Felix Wemheuer|author3=Gao Hua|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=177|chapter=Food Augmentation Methods and Food Substitutes during the Great Famine}}</ref> The effects of the illusion of superabundance were significant, leaving some historians to argue that it being the major cause of much of the starvation throughout China. Yang Dali states that there were three main consequences from the illusion of superabundance:<ref>{{cite book|author=Dali L. Yang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmLuoAkMKrkC|title=Calamity and Reform in China: State, Rural Society, and Institutional Change Since the Great Leap Famine|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8047-3470-7|page=65}}</ref> <blockquote>First, it led to planners to shift lands from grain to economic crops, such as cotton, sugarcane, and beets, and divert huge numbers agricultural laborers into industrial sectors, fueling state demand for procured grain from the countryside. Second, it prompted the Chinese leadership, especially [[Zhou Enlai]], to speed up grain exports to secure more foreign currency to purchase capital goods needed for industrialization.

Zeng proposed agricultural projects without consulting colleagues which caused Anhui's agriculture to fail terribly.  Zhang Kaifan, a party secretary and deputy-governor of the province, heard rumours of a famine breaking out in Anhui and disagreed with many of Zeng's policies. Zeng reported Zhang to Mao for such speculations which led Mao to label Zhang \"a member of the 'Peng Dehuai anti-Party military clique,'\" resulting in him being purged from the local party. Zeng was unable to report of the famine when it became an emergency situation as this would prove his hypocrisy and caused him to become a \"blatant political radical who almost single-handedly damaged Anhui.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=213|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\nJiangxi encountered a situation almost opposite to that of Anhui. The leaders of Jiangxi publicly opposed some of the Great Leap programs, quietly made themselves unavailable, and even appeared to take a passive attitude towards the Maoist economy. As the leaders worked collaboratively among themselves, they also worked with the local population as well. By being able to create an environment in which the Great Leap Forward did not become fully implemented, the Jiangxi government \"did their best to minimize damage\u2026\" These findings concluded

This ended up making things much worse, the crop failed completely, leaving barren fields.

The theory was that plants of the same species would not compete with each other. In natural cycles they did fully compete, which actually stunted growth and resulted in lower yields.\n\nAnother implemented policy (known as \"[[deep plowing]]\") was based on the ideas of Lysenko's colleague Terentiy Maltsev, who encouraged peasants across China to eschew normal [[plowing]] depths of 15\u201320 centimeters and instead plow extremely deeply into the soil (1 to 2 meters). The deep plowing theory stated that the most fertile soil was deep in the earth, and plowing unusually deep would allow extra strong root growth. However, in shallow soil, useless rocks, soil, and sand were driven up instead, burying the fertile topsoil and severely stunting seedling growth.\n\n==== Four Pest Campaign ====\n{{Main Article|Four Pests Campaign}}\n[[File:Tree-Sparrow-2009-16-02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Eurasian tree sparrow]] was the most notable target of the [[Four Pests Campaign]]]]\n\nAdditionally, in the [[Four Pests Campaign]], citizens were called upon to destroy sparrows and other wild birds that ate crop seeds, in order to protect fields. Pest birds were shot down or scared away from landing until dropping in exhaustion. This system failed and resulted in an explosion of the vermin population, especially crop-eating insects, which consequently had no predators.\n\n==== Illusion of superabundance ====\nSince 1957, the [[Communist Party of China]] had began to report excessive production of grains. However, the actual production of grains throughout China was decreasing from 1957\u20131961.

On the contrary, the crop yields were in fact lower than average. For instance, Beijing believed that \"in 1960 state granaries would have 50 billion ''[[Chinese units of measurement|jin]]'' of grain,\" when they actually contained 12.7 billion ''jin.''<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|author2=Felix Wemheuer|author3=Gao Hua|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=177|chapter=Food Augmentation Methods and Food Substitutes during the Great Famine}}</ref> The effects of the illusion of superabundance were significant, leaving some historians to argue that it being the major cause of much of the starvation throughout China. Yang Dali states that there were three main consequences from the illusion of superabundance:<ref>{{cite book|author=Dali L. Yang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmLuoAkMKrkC|title=Calamity and Reform in China: State, Rural Society, and Institutional Change Since the Great Leap Famine|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8047-3470-7|page=65}}</ref> <blockquote>First, it led to planners to shift lands from grain to economic crops, such as cotton, sugarcane, and beets, and divert huge numbers agricultural laborers into industrial sectors, fueling state demand for procured grain from the countryside. Second, it prompted the Chinese leadership, especially [[Zhou Enlai]], to speed up grain exports to secure more foreign currency to purchase capital goods needed for industrialization. Finally, the illusion of superabundance made the adoption of the commune mess halls seem rational at the time. All these changes, of course, contributed to the rapid exhaustion of grain supplies.</blockquote>\n\n=== More policies from the central government ===\nEconomists Xin Meng, [[Nancy Qian]] and Pierre Yared showed that, much like Nobel laureate [[Amartya Sen]]'s earlier claims, aggregate production was sufficient for avoiding famine and that the famine was caused by over-procurement and poor distribution within the country. They show that unlike most other famines, there was surprisingly more deaths in places that produced more food per capita and argue that the inflexibility in the centrally planned food procurement system explains at least half of the famine mortality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meng|first=Xin|last2=Qian|first2=Nancy|last3=Yared|first3=Pierre|date=2015-10-01|title=The Institutional Causes of China's Great Famine, 1959\u20131961|url=https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/82/4/1568/2607347|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|volume=82|issue=4|pages=1568\u20131611|doi=10.1093/restud/rdv016|issn=0034-6527}}</ref> Economic historians James Kung and Shuo Chen show that there was more over procurement in places where politicians faced more competition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kung|first=James Kai-Sing|last2=Chen|first2=Shuo|date=February 2011|title=The Tragedy of the Nomenklatura: Career Incentives and Political Radicalism during China's Great Leap Famine|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=105|issue=1|pages=27\u201345|doi=10.1017/S0003055410000626|issn=1537-5943}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, policies from the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) and the central government that were implemented, particularly the [[Three Red Banners]] and the [[Socialist Education Movement]] (SEM), proved to be ideologically detrimental to the aggrevating famine. The Three Red Banners of the CCP \"sparked the fanaticism of 1958\"  and the implementation of the [[Mass line|Mass Line]], one of the three banners which told people to, \"go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, better, and more economical results\" directly links to the pressures officials felt when reporting a superabundance of grain.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=87}}</ref> The SEM, established in 1957, also led to the severity of the famine in various ways, including causing the \"illusion of superabundance (\u6d6e\u5938\u98ce)\".

By enforcing such passivity at a local level while there already was passivity at an official level, speaking and acting against the famine became a seemingly impossible task.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=110|chapter=\"The Grain Problem is an Ideological Problem\" : Discourses of Hunger in the 1957 Socialist Education Campaign}}</ref>\n\nThe influence of local government in the famine can be seen in the comparison between the provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi.

Zeng proposed agricultural projects without consulting colleagues which caused Anhui's agriculture to fail terribly.  Zhang Kaifan, a party secretary and deputy-governor of the province, heard rumours of a famine breaking out in Anhui and disagreed with many of Zeng's policies. Zeng reported Zhang to Mao for such speculations which led Mao to label Zhang \"a member of the 'Peng Dehuai anti-Party military clique,'\" resulting in him being purged from the local party. Zeng was unable to report of the famine when it became an emergency situation as this would prove his hypocrisy and caused him to become a \"blatant political radical who almost single-handedly damaged Anhui.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=213|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\nJiangxi encountered a situation almost opposite to that of Anhui. The leaders of Jiangxi publicly opposed some of the Great Leap programs, quietly made themselves unavailable, and even appeared to take a passive attitude towards the Maoist economy. As the leaders worked collaboratively among themselves, they also worked with the local population as well. By being able to create an environment in which the Great Leap Forward did not become fully implemented, the Jiangxi government \"did their best to minimize damage\u2026\" These findings concluded that much of the severity of the famine came down to provincial leaders and their responsibility for their regions.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating

agricultural performance. They also suspected that local officials tended to exaggerate such reports to obtain more state assistance or tax relief. Clearly, the weather contributed to the appalling drop in output, but it is impossible to assess to what extent. </blockquote>\n\n==Aftermath ==\n\n=== Initial cover-ups ===\nLocal party leaders, for their part, conspired to cover up shortfalls and reassign blame in order to protect their own lives and positions.{{citation needed|reason=They did cover up shortfalls and invent numbers, but the second part of this needs a citation.|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn visits to [[Henan province]] in 1958, Mao observed what local officials claimed was increases in crop yield of one thousand to three thousand percent achieved, supposedly, in massive 24-hour pushes organized by the officials which they called \"sputnik launches\".  But the numbers were faked, and so were the fields that Mao observed, which had been carefully prepared in advance of Mao's visit by local officials, who removed shoots of grain from various fields and carefully transplanted them into a field prepared especially for Mao, which appeared to be a bumper crop.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nThe local officials became trapped by these sham demonstrations to Mao, and exhorted the peasants to reach unattainable goals, by \"deep ploughing and close planting\", and other techniques. This ended up making things much worse, the crop failed completely, leaving barren fields. No one was in a position to challenge Mao's ideas as incorrect, so peasants pulled out their bedding and coats into the fields, added seeds and water, and after they sprouted, buried the materials under the soil once the seedlings were high enough.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nIn a similar manner to the massive Soviet-created famine in Ukraine (the [[Holodomor]]), doctors were prohibited from listing \"starvation\" as a cause of death on death certificates. This kind of deception was far from uncommon; a famous [[propaganda]] picture from the famine shows Chinese children from [[Shandong]] province ostensibly standing atop a field of wheat, so densely grown that it could apparently support their weight. In reality, they were standing on a bench concealed beneath the plants, and the \"field\" was again entirely composed of individually transplanted stalks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKNEdojrsMo|title=Mao's Great Famine|last=International School History|date=21 January 2015|accessdate=19 September 2018|via=YouTube|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030033514/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKNEdojrsMo|archive-date=30 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>[http://www.disasterhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Standing-on-Grain-Propaganda-1959.jpg Aforementioned propaganda photo. ]\n\n=== Cultural Revolution ===\n{{Main Article|Cultural Revolution}}\nIn April and May 1961, [[Liu Shaoqi]], then [[President of the People's Republic of China]], concluded after 44 days of field research in villages of [[Hunan]] that the reasons for the famine were 30% natural disaster and 70% human error.<ref name=\":4\">[http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64162/64172/85037/85039/5898093.html \u5218\u5c11\u5947\"\u4e09\u5206\u5929\u707e\uff0c\u4e03\u5206\u4eba\u7978\"\u63d0\u6cd5\u7684\u7531\u6765] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214040606/http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64162/64172/85037/85039/5898093.html |date=14 December 2012 }}, Selection of the Party History (\u515a\u53f2\u535a\u91c7), 22 June 2007, Accessed Sept 1, 2018, CPC News. {{in lang|zh-Hans}}</ref><ref name=\":5\" /> The failure of the Great Leap Forward as well as the famine led [[Mao Zedong]] to withdraw from active decision making and turn many future responsibilities over to other leaders such as Liu Shaoqi and [[Deng Xiaoping]].<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/special/china_1950_leaders.htm|title=Three Chinese Leaders: Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping {{!}} Asia for Educators {{!}} Columbia University|website=afe.easia.columbia.edu|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> However, the disagreement between Mao and Liu (and Deng) gradually increased, until Mao launched the [[Cultural Revolution]] in 1966 during which Liu was accused of attributing only 30 percent to natural calamities and was accused of being a traitor and an enemy agent.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":13\">{{Cite journal|last=Dittmer|first=Lowell|date=1981|title=Death and Transfiguration: Liu Shaoqi's Rehabilitation and Contemporary Chinese Politics|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2054551.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A5a66dc4d344383910ea236fb655170fd|journal=The Journal of Asian Studies|volume=40|pages=455-479|via=}}</ref> Liu was persecuted to death in 1968.<ref name=\":13\" />  \n\n=== Reflections ===\n{{Main Article|Reforms and Opening Up}}\nIn 1978, Deng Xiaoping became the new [[Paramount Leader of China|paramount leader of China]] and launched by [[Reforms and Opening Up|Reforms and Opening up]] program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/69112/69113/index.html|title=\u9093\u5c0f\u5e73\u7eaa\u5ff5\u7f51--\u9886\u8896\u4eba\u7269\u7eaa\u5ff5\u9986--\u4eba\u6c11\u7f51|website=cpc.people.com.cn|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> Until the early 1980s, the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]]'s stance, reflected by the name \"Three Years of Natural Disasters\", was still that the famine was largely a result of a series of natural disasters compounded by several planning errors. \n\nResearchers outside China have argued that massive institutional and policy changes that accompanied the Great Leap Forward were the key factors in the famine, or at least worsened nature-induced disasters.<ref>{{cite video|title=China: A Century of Revolution|date=1997|people=Sue Williams (director), Howard Sharp (editor), [[Will Lyman]] (narrator)|publisher=WinStar Home Entertainment}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Encyclopedia of Population|volume=1|pages=388\u2013390|year=2003|editor-last=Demeny|editor-first=Paul|contribution=Famine in China|place=New York|publisher=Macmillan Reference|editor2-last=McNicoll|editor2-first=Geoffrey}}</ref> In particular, Nobel laureate [[Amartya Sen]] puts this famine in a global context, arguing that lack of democracy is the major culprit: \"Indeed, no substantial famine has ever occurred in a democratic country\u2014no matter how poor.\" He adds that it is \"hard to imagine that anything like this could have happened in a country that goes to the polls regularly and that has an independent press.

This led to him being given one final chance on 6 October, where he rose to the occasion and impressed his CTU teammates enough to continue his association with them. To solidify his status with the stable, Devitt teamed with CTU leader, [[Jyushin Thunder Liger]] to take on [[Wataru Inoue (wrestler)|Wataru Inoue]] and [[Ryusuke Taguchi]].
