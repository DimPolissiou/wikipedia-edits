Towards the end of his Customs career, he met [[Shehu Musa Yar'Adua]], who had been second-in-command of the military government that ruled Nigeria between 1976 and 1979. Abubakar was drawn by Yar'Adua into the political meetings that were now happening regularly in Yar'Adua's Lagos home. In 1989 Abubakar was elected a National Vice-Chairman of the Peoples Front of Nigeria, the political association led by Yar'Adua, to participate in the transition programme initiated by Head of State Ibrahim Babangida. The Peoples Front of Nigeria included politicians such as [[Umaru Musa Yar'Adua]], [[Babalola Borishade]], [[Bola Tinubu]], [[Abdullahi Aliyu Sumaila]], [[Rabiu Kwankwaso]] , [[Dapo Sarumi]] and [[Sabo Bakin Zuwo]].\n\nAbubakar won a seat to represent his constituency at the 1989 Constituent Assembly, set up to decide a new constitution for Nigeria.

Towards the end of his Customs career, he met [[Shehu Musa Yar'Adua]], who had been second-in-command of the military government that ruled Nigeria between 1976 and 1979. Abubakar was drawn by Yar'Adua into the political meetings that were now happening regularly in Yar'Adua's Lagos home. In 1989 Abubakar was elected a National Vice-Chairman of the Peoples Front of Nigeria, the political association led by Yar'Adua, to participate in the transition programme initiated by Head of State Ibrahim Babangida. The Peoples Front of Nigeria included politicians such as [[Umaru Musa Yar'Adua]], [[Babalola Borishade]], [[Bola Tinubu]], [[Abdullahi Aliyu Sumaila]], [[Rabiu Kwankwaso]] , [[Dapo Sarumi]] and [[Sabo Bakin Zuwo]].\n\nAbubakar won a seat to represent his constituency at the 1989 Constituent Assembly, set up to decide a new constitution for Nigeria.

It is Hamburg's oldest school and was founded in 1529 by [[Johannes Bugenhagen]]. The school\u00b4s focus is on the teaching of Latin and ancient Greek. It is proud of having educated some of Germany's political leaders as well as some of Germany's notable scientists.<ref>[http://www.johanneum-hamburg.de/index.php/schola-nostra/schule-mit-geschichte/beruehmte-alumni Johanneum]</ref> The school is operated and financed by the city of Hamburg.\n\n== Twinned schools ==\nThe school is twinned with the two [[London]] schools [[Latymer Upper School]] and [[Godolphin and Latymer School]].\n\n== ''Journey to the Centre of the Earth'' ==\nIn Jules Verne's novel, ''[[Journey to the Centre of the Earth]]'', one of the main characters, Otto Lidenbrock, is a professor at the Johanneum.\n\n== H\u00f6dh\u00fctte ==\n''H\u00f6dh\u00fctte'' is the country house of the ''Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums''.

Living conditions are very simple (the house has only one tap, students sleep in communal bunks, there is no TV and no telephone and students are not allowed to bring their cellphones). All pupils are required to spend 11 days at ''H\u00f6rdh\u00fctte'' during their seventh year of schooling. This is believed to build community spirit and strengthen character.

It has 55,000 books written in Latin, Ancient Greek, English, French, Italian and German. The library prides itself in having the first editions of many of the milestones of European literature. The oldest book is a Latin bible dating from 1491.\n\n== Alumni society ==\nThe school has an alumni society called ''Verein ehemaliger Sch\u00fcler der Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums zu Hamburg e.V.''.

Along with [[Classen School of Advanced Studies]], it was named for Anton H. Classen, an early Oklahoma City real estate developer and philanthropist.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.okcps.org/sch/hs/nwchs.htm/ | title = Northwest Classen High School | accessdate = January 23, 2008 | publisher = Oklahoma City Public Schools | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070126144054/http://www.okcps.org/sch/hs/nwchs.htm | archivedate = January 26, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://classenokc.org | title = Classen High School History | accessdate = January 23, 2008 | publisher = Classen High School Alumni Association }}</ref>\n\nAs the neighborhoods around Northwest Classen have changed, so has the cultural makeup of the campus.  Initially an almost all-Caucasian school, the population has gradually become more multi-cultural.  Today, the enrollment in the school is nearly an equal split of Hispanic, African American, and Caucasian students with almost 100 different races and cultures represented.\n\n== Hudson Performance Hall ==\nThe original auditorium was, along with the rest of the school, targeted for upgrades and renovation as part of Oklahoma City's \"MAPS for Kids\" program in 2010.  Alumni J. Clifford Hudson (a local businessman) and his wife Leslie, who had met in that auditorium, donated $500,000 in additional funds to install updated sound and lighting technology, improve the acoustics and update the audience area for the site.  Now named the \"Hudson Performance Hall\", the venue has held concerts by notable acts such as Vince Gill (also an alumni), Al Yankovic, Arlo Guthrie, and Sinbad.<ref>{{cite web | title = About Us | url = http://hudsonperformancehall.com/page/about_us.html|website=Hudson Performance Hall | accessdate = August 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Extracurricular activities ==\nNorthwest fields teams in [[Oklahoma Secondary School Activities Association]]-sanctioned competition in baseball, fast-pitch softball, football, cheerleading, cross country, volleyball, basketball, tennis, wrestling, golf, soccer, and track.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ossaa.com/partners/ossaa/classifications/index.html | title = OSSAA Schools Classification by Sport | accessdate = January 23, 2008 | publisher = Oklahoma Secondary School Activities Association | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071210043818/http://www.ossaa.com/partners/ossaa/classifications/index.html | archivedate = December 10, 2007 | url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n<!-- Please add citations for any alumni you want to add -->\n{{category see also|Northwest Classen High School alumni}}\n* [[William A.

Along with [[Classen School of Advanced Studies]], it was named for Anton H. Classen, an early Oklahoma City real estate developer and philanthropist.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.okcps.org/sch/hs/nwchs.htm/ | title = Northwest Classen High School | accessdate = January 23, 2008 | publisher = Oklahoma City Public Schools | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070126144054/http://www.okcps.org/sch/hs/nwchs.htm | archivedate = January 26, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://classenokc.org | title = Classen High School History | accessdate = January 23, 2008 | publisher = Classen High School Alumni Association }}</ref>\n\nAs the neighborhoods around Northwest Classen have changed, so has the cultural makeup of the campus.  Initially an almost all-Caucasian school, the population has gradually become more multi-cultural.  Today, the enrollment in the school is nearly an equal split of Hispanic, African American, and Caucasian students with almost 100 different races and cultures represented.\n\n== Hudson Performance Hall ==\nThe original auditorium was, along with the rest of the school, targeted for upgrades and renovation as part of Oklahoma City's \"MAPS for Kids\" program in 2010.  Alumni J. Clifford Hudson (a local businessman) and his wife Leslie, who had met in that auditorium, donated $500,000 in additional funds to install updated sound and lighting technology, improve the acoustics and update the audience area for the site.  Now named the \"Hudson Performance Hall\", the venue has held concerts by notable acts such as Vince Gill (also an alumni), Al Yankovic, Arlo Guthrie, and Sinbad.<ref>{{cite web | title = About Us | url = http://hudsonperformancehall.com/page/about_us.html|website=Hudson Performance Hall | accessdate = August 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Extracurricular activities ==\nNorthwest fields teams in [[Oklahoma Secondary School Activities Association]]-sanctioned competition in baseball, fast-pitch softball, football, cheerleading, cross country, volleyball, basketball, tennis, wrestling, golf, soccer, and track.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ossaa.com/partners/ossaa/classifications/index.html | title = OSSAA Schools Classification by Sport | accessdate = January 23, 2008 | publisher = Oklahoma Secondary School Activities Association | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071210043818/http://www.ossaa.com/partners/ossaa/classifications/index.html | archivedate = December 10, 2007 | url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n<!-- Please add citations for any alumni you want to add -->\n{{category see also|Northwest Classen High School alumni}}\n* [[William A.
