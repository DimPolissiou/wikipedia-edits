In Rhodes' own words, \"I ... desire to encourage and foster an appreciation of the advantages which I implicitly believe will result from the union of the English-speaking peoples throughout the world and to encourage in the students from North America who would benefit from the American Scholarships.\"<ref name=\"will\" /> Rhodes also bequeathed scholarships to German students in the hope that, \"a good understanding between England, Germany and the United States of America will secure the peace of the world.\"\n\nRhodes, who attended [[Oriel College, Oxford]], believed the university's residential colleges would be the best venue to nurture diplomatic ties between future world leaders.\n\nTo this day, controversies persist over Rhodes\u2019 Anglo-supremacist beliefs, most of which date back to his 1877 confession of faith.<ref>For an online version, see http://pages.uoregon.edu/kimball/Rhodes-Confession.htm</ref> However, such convictions did not play a part in the final vision for the scholarship. The scholarships are based on Rhodes' final will and testament, which states that \"no student shall be qualified or disqualified for election ... on account of race or religious opinions\".<ref name=\"will\" />\n\nThe Rhodes Scholarships are administered and awarded by the Rhodes Trust, which is located at [[Rhodes House]] in Oxford. The trust has been modified by four acts of Parliament: the Rhodes Estate Act 1916, the Rhodes Trust Act 1929, the Rhodes Trust Act 1946; and most recently by the Rhodes Trust (Modification) Order 1976, a [[statutory instrument]] in accordance with Section 78 (4) of the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://files.www.rhodesscholarshiptrust.com/rhodes-trust/key-governance-documents/Rhodes_Trust_Signed_Accounts_2015.pdf|title=The Rhodes Trust Annual Report and Financial Statements for the Year Ended 30 June 2015|access-date=1 September 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610184533/http://files.www.rhodesscholarshiptrust.com/rhodes-trust/key-governance-documents/Rhodes_Trust_Signed_Accounts_2015.pdf|archivedate=10 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== After Rhodes' death ===\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1925, the [[Commonwealth Fund Fellowship]]s (later renamed the [[Harkness Fellowship]]s) were established to reciprocate the Rhodes Scholarships by enabling British graduates to study in the United States.<ref name=Harkness>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.ms-ms9258 History of the Harkness Fellowships] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223320/http://nla.gov.au/nla.ms-ms9258 |date=3 March 2016 }}, nla.gov.au</ref> The [[Kennedy Scholarship]] programme, created in 1966 as a memorial to [[John F. Kennedy]], adopts a comparable selection process to the Rhodes Scholarships to allow ten British post-graduate students per year to study at either [[Harvard]] or the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT). It also cooperates with universities in China, BLCC, for example. BLCC offers high-level scholarships for international students who aim to study Chinese in Beijing. In 1953, the Parliament of the United Kingdom created the [[Marshall Scholarship]] as a coeducational alternative to the Rhodes Scholarship that would serve as a \"living gift\" to the United States.\n\nCecil Rhodes wished current scholars and Rhodes alumni (in the words of his will) to have \"opportunities of meeting and discussing their experiences and prospects\". This has been reflected, for example, in the initiation by the first warden (Sir [[Francis Wylie]]), of an annual warden's Christmas letter (now supplemented by Rhodes e-news and other communications); the creation of alumni associations in several countries, most prominently the Association of American Rhodes Scholars (which publishes ''The American Oxonian'', founded in 1914, and oversees the Eastman Professorship); and the holding of reunions for Rhodes Scholars of all countries.\n\nIn recognition of the centenary of the foundation of the Rhodes Trust in 2003, four former Rhodes Scholars were awarded [[honorary degrees]] by the University of Oxford. These were [[John Brademas]], [[Bob Hawke]] (Western Australia and [[University College, Oxford|University]] 1953), [[Rex Nettleford]] and David R. Woods.

The first area was to be judged by examination, the second and third by ballot from the candidate's fellow students, and the fourth by the headmaster of the candidate's school. The results for each candidate would be sent to the trustees of Rhodes's will, or their appointees, who would then give a final assessment by averaging the marks for each candidate. Except for the candidates submitted by the four schools in southern Africa, the trustees were vested with the final decisions.\n\nRhodes also added that the scholars should be distributed among the Colleges at Oxford, that the trustees could remove any scholar at their discretion, and that the trustees were to host an annual dinner so scholars could discuss their \u201cexperiences and prospects.\u201d The trustees were also encouraged to invite to the dinner other \u201cpersons who have shown sympathy with the views expressed by me in this my Will.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, the same criteria underwent revision, and now specify no gender. They are now:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rhodesscholar.org/applying-for-the-scholarship/frequently-asked-questions/|title=Frequently Asked Questions - The Rhodes Scholarships|author=|date=|website=www.rhodesscholar.org}}</ref>\n\n*literary and scholastic attainments\n*energy to use one's talents to the full\n*truth, courage, devotion to duty, sympathy for and protection of the weak, kindliness, unselfishness and fellowship\n*moral force of character and instincts to lead, and to take an interest in one's fellow beings\n\nEach country's scholarship varies in its selectivity. In the United States, applicants must first pass a university-internal endorsement process, then proceed to one of the 16 U.S. districts committees. In 2016, approximately 2,500 students sought their institution's endorsement for the American Rhodes scholarship, among those 882 from 311 institutions were university-endorsed, of whom 32 were ultimately elected. As such, the American Rhodes Scholarship is more selective than the [[Churchill Scholarship]], [[Truman Scholarship]], [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Scholarship]], [[Gates Scholarship]], and [[Mitchell Scholarship]], but marginally less selective than the [[Marshall Scholarship]] in terms of university-endorsed applicants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rhodesscholar.org/news-and-announcements/american-rhodes-scholarship-winners-2017/|title=American Rhodes Scholarships Winners 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=www.rhodesscholar.org|access-date=2017-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/meet-the-2014-rhodes-scholars/2013/11/26/ea276b1a-5600-11e3-835d-e7173847c7cc_story.html|title=Meet the 2014 Rhodes Scholars|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-09-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marshallscholarship.org/about/statistics|title=Statistics|website=www.marshallscholarship.org|access-date=2017-04-08}}</ref> In Canada between 1997-2002, there were an average of 234 university-endorsed applicants annually for 11 scholarships, for an acceptance rate of 4.7%.

That stipulation would not change until 1977. Rhodes developed his scholarships partly through conversation with [[William Thomas Stead]], editor of ''[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]'' and confidant of Rhodes, and at one time an executor of the Will who was stricken from the role when he objected to Rhodes's ill-fated effort to seize the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]]. Shortly after Rhodes's death, Stead implied in a published article about the Will that he suggested that Rhodes open the scholarships to women.<ref>William Thomas Stead, \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=h2ZPAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA609&lpg=PA609&dq=mr.+rhodes%27s+will+and+its+genesis+stead&source=bl&ots=dlaGVFpnWK&sig=A4PK-gC5Ui7AitbMuBM-ECRaOqA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiluoqGm7bdAhVHNd8KHRJpBwoQ6AEwAXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=mr.%20rhodes's%20will%20and%20its%20genesis%20stead&f=false Mr. Rhodes\u2019s Will and Its Genesis]\", p. 479, ''The Review of Reviews'' 25, pp. 471\u201382</ref>  But Rhodes refused. Nothing more is said on the matter.\n\nAfter his death, the will was under the control of the Board of Trustees of the Rhodes Trust. In 1916, however, the trustees introduced a bill into the House of Commons that, catering to popular British sentiment during the [[World War I|War]], \"revoked and annulled\" the scholarships for Germans.<ref>See [[Angela Stent]], \"The Women's Bid for a Rhodes\", ''Change'', Vol. 6, No. 5 (June 1974), pp 13.16.</ref> Since then, legal control over the will has resided with Parliament.\n\nIn 1970, the trustees established the Rhodes Visiting Fellowships. Unlike the regular scholarship, a Visiting Fellow was expected to have a doctorate or comparable degree, and to use the two-year funded study to engage in independent research. Only 33 Visiting Fellowships were awarded.<ref>See [http://www.otago.ac.nz/library/exhibitions/rhodes_scholars/rhodes_women.html \"Rhodes Visiting Fellowships for Women\"].</ref>\n\nIn 1975, Parliament passed the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975|Sex Discrimination Act of 1975]] that banned discrimination based on sex, including in education.  The trustees then applied to the Secretary of State for Education to admit women into the scholarship, and in 1976 the request was granted.<ref>Philip Ziegler, ''Legacy: Cecil Rhodes, the Rhodes Trust and Rhodes Scholarships'', 2008, Yale University Press, p. 221.</ref> In 1977, women were finally admitted to the full scholarship. To a large degree, this change was the result of the advances of the feminist movement as well as the importance of [[Title IX]] legislation in the United States that made illegal sex discrimination in colleges that received federal financial assistance.\n\nBefore Parliament passed the 1975 Act, some universities protested against the exclusion of women by nominating female candidates, who were later disqualified at the state level of the American competition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1973/10/6/harvard-endorses-3-women-for-male-restricted/|title=Harvard Endorses 3 Women For Male-Restricted Rhodes {{!}} News {{!}} The Harvard Crimson|website=www.thecrimson.com|access-date=2016-09-01}}</ref> In 1977, the first year women were eligible, 24 women (out of 72 total scholars) were selected worldwide, with 13 women and 19 men selected from the United States.<ref name=WomenScholars>[https://archive.today/20121210090918/http://therhodesproject.wordpress.com/2010/01/29/second-class-citizens-how-women-became-rhodes-scholars/ \"Second-class citizens: How women became Rhodes Scholars\"], 29 January 2010, therhodesproject.wordpress.com</ref> Since then, the average female share of the scholarship in the United States had been around 35 percent.<ref name=WomenScholars/>\n\nIn his 2008 book ''Legacy: Cecil Rhodes, the Rhodes Trust and Rhodes Scholarship'' ([[Yale University Press]]), biographer and historian [[Philip Ziegler]] writes that \"The advent of women does not seem notably to have affected the balance of Scholars among the various professions, though it has reduced the incidence of worldly success.\"  The idea has persisted that women Rhodes Scholars are less successful overall than their male peers. But the Rhodes Project<ref>[http://rhodesproject.com/ The Rhodes Project]</ref> seeks to challenge this idea.<ref>See \"30 Years of Rhodes Women\" (https://www.americanrhodes.org/assets/attachments/347.pdf).</ref>\n\nIn South Africa, the will of Cecil Rhodes expressly allocated scholarships to four all-male private schools. In 1992, one of the four schools partnered with an all-girls school in order to allow female applicants. In 2012, the three remaining schools followed suit to allow women to apply.<ref name=\"rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/news/south-african-schools-scholarships|title=New partnerships for South African schools' Rhodes Scholarships|access-date=2016-09-01|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123172624/http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/news/south-african-schools-scholarships|archivedate=23 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Today, four of the nine scholarships allocated to South Africa are open only to students and alumni of these schools and partner schools.<ref name=\"rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk\"/>\n\n=== Exclusion of black Africans ===\nRhodes clearly specified in the will that \"No student shall be qualified or disqualified for election to a Scholarship on account of his race or religious opinions.\" Rhodes often in his writings used the word \"race\" with reference to black Africans, what he called \"natives\". In the context of the historical era, it would have been entirely out of character for Rhodes, and seen as absurd by the trustees and Oxford, to suggest that some of the scholarships might go to Africans. Furthermore, as Rhodes himself knew, and as Oxford University insisted in the early years of the scholarships, all applicants for the scholarship were required to pass the entrance exam for Oxford, or its equivalent, called [[Responsions]], which included ancient Greek and Latin. It would have been highly unusual for any Africans in that era to be admitted into those European schools in southern Africa that taught such subjects. Rhodes's scholarships intentionally excluded women and Africans, and those stipulations were followed carefully in the implementation<ref>E.g., Tim Nuttall, 2001, \"A Century of South African Rhodes Scholarships\", in A. Kenny, ed., ''The History of the Rhodes Trust 1902\u20131999'', Oxford University Press, pp. 251\u2013314</ref> Nothing in the will or in any of Rhodes' other writings suggests his desire to educate non-Europeans. In fact, the four South African schools named by Rhodes only admitted whites, and would not open their doors to black Africans until the end of [[apartheid]] in the early 1990s.\n\nBeginning in 1970, scholars began protesting against the fact that all Rhodes Scholars from southern Africa were white, with 120 Oxford dons and 80 of the 145 Rhodes Scholars in residence at the time signing a petition calling for non-white scholars to be elected in 1971.<ref name=\"Schaeper\">Schaeper, Thomas and Kathleen Schaeper. ''Rhodes Scholars: Oxford, and the Creation of an American Elite'', 2010. Berghahn Books: New York</ref>{{rp|238}} The case of South Africa was especially difficult to resolve, because in his will establishing the scholarships, unlike for other constituencies, Rhodes specifically allocated four scholarships to alumni of four white-only private secondary schools. According to Schaeper and Schaeper,<ref name=\"Schaeper\" />{{rp|236\u2013237}} the issue became \"explosive\" in the 1970s and 1980s as scholars argued that the scholarship be changed while the trustees argued they were powerless to change the will. Despite such protests, only in 1991 with the rise of the [[African National Congress]] did black South Africans begin to win the scholarships.<ref name=\"Schaeper\" />{{rp|240}}\n\n=== Criticism of Rhodes as colonialist ===\n{{see also|Rhodes Must Fall|Cecil Rhodes#Political Views}}\n\nPublic criticism of the scholarship has also focused on Cecil Rhodes's [[white supremacist]] views.

''Rhodes Scholars: Oxford, and the Creation of an American Elite'', Berghahn Books: New York, 2010, p. 279.</ref> Although Cecil Rhodes imagined that scholars would \"pursue a full-time career in government [...] the number of scholars in local, state and federal government has remained at a steady 7 percent\" over the past century.

Berghahn Books: New York, p. 311.</ref>\n\nThe highest-ranking career choice for Rhodes Scholars is education and academia, with many becoming deans of law and medical schools and others becoming professors and lecturers. Many of the most distinguished Rhodes Scholars, such as Zambian activist [[Lucy Banda-Sichone|Lucy Banda]], have become prominent members of the civil rights movement.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/zambian-activist-lucy-banda-becomes-first-female-rhodes-scholar-to-have-portrait-displayed-at-oxford-a6766946.html|title=The first ever portrait of a female Rhodes scholar has been unveiled|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-11-23}}</ref> In 1990, third-wave feminist author Naomi Wolf put forward ideas about beauty and power with her book ''[[The Beauty Myth]]'', ushering in a new type of feminism that has risen to prominence in the digital age.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/oct/18/classics.shopping|title=Women: A quick reminder ...

As early as 1931, [[Afrikaans]]-born anti-apartheid lawyer Bram Fischer and Rhodes Scholar campaigned for equal rights for all South Africans.

Like the Rhodes, the Marshall is a two-stage geographic scholarship organised through districts in selecting countries. Like the Gates Cambridge, the Rhodes is tenable at only one university. In structure, the Marshall Scholarship is more flexible than the Rhodes Scholarship, in that Marshall Scholars can study at any British university and can also attend a different university each year during a scholar's tenure.

In Rhodes' own words, \"I ... desire to encourage and foster an appreciation of the advantages which I implicitly believe will result from the union of the English-speaking peoples throughout the world and to encourage in the students from North America who would benefit from the American Scholarships.\"<ref name=\"will\" /> Rhodes also bequeathed scholarships to German students in the hope that, \"a good understanding between England, Germany and the United States of America will secure the peace of the world.\"\n\nRhodes, who attended [[Oriel College, Oxford]], believed the university's residential colleges would be the best venue to nurture diplomatic ties between future world leaders.\n\nTo this day, controversies persist over Rhodes\u2019 Anglo-supremacist beliefs, most of which date back to his 1877 confession of faith.<ref>For an online version, see http://pages.uoregon.edu/kimball/Rhodes-Confession.htm</ref> However, such convictions did not play a part in the final vision for the scholarship. The scholarships are based on Rhodes' final will and testament, which states that \"no student shall be qualified or disqualified for election ... on account of race or religious opinions\".<ref name=\"will\" />\n\nThe Rhodes Scholarships are administered and awarded by the Rhodes Trust, which is located at [[Rhodes House]] in Oxford. The trust has been modified by four acts of Parliament: the Rhodes Estate Act 1916, the Rhodes Trust Act 1929, the Rhodes Trust Act 1946; and most recently by the Rhodes Trust (Modification) Order 1976, a [[statutory instrument]] in accordance with Section 78 (4) of the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://files.www.rhodesscholarshiptrust.com/rhodes-trust/key-governance-documents/Rhodes_Trust_Signed_Accounts_2015.pdf|title=The Rhodes Trust Annual Report and Financial Statements for the Year Ended 30 June 2015|access-date=1 September 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610184533/http://files.www.rhodesscholarshiptrust.com/rhodes-trust/key-governance-documents/Rhodes_Trust_Signed_Accounts_2015.pdf|archivedate=10 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== After Rhodes' death ===\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1925, the [[Commonwealth Fund Fellowship]]s (later renamed the [[Harkness Fellowship]]s) were established to reciprocate the Rhodes Scholarships by enabling British graduates to study in the United States.<ref name=Harkness>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.ms-ms9258 History of the Harkness Fellowships] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223320/http://nla.gov.au/nla.ms-ms9258 |date=3 March 2016 }}, nla.gov.au</ref> The [[Kennedy Scholarship]] programme, created in 1966 as a memorial to [[John F. Kennedy]], adopts a comparable selection process to the Rhodes Scholarships to allow ten British post-graduate students per year to study at either [[Harvard]] or the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT). It also cooperates with universities in China, BLCC, for example. BLCC offers high-level scholarships for international students who aim to study Chinese in Beijing. In 1953, the Parliament of the United Kingdom created the [[Marshall Scholarship]] as a coeducational alternative to the Rhodes Scholarship that would serve as a \"living gift\" to the United States.\n\nCecil Rhodes wished current scholars and Rhodes alumni (in the words of his will) to have \"opportunities of meeting and discussing their experiences and prospects\". This has been reflected, for example, in the initiation by the first warden (Sir [[Francis Wylie]]), of an annual warden's Christmas letter (now supplemented by Rhodes e-news and other communications); the creation of alumni associations in several countries, most prominently the Association of American Rhodes Scholars (which publishes ''The American Oxonian'', founded in 1914, and oversees the Eastman Professorship); and the holding of reunions for Rhodes Scholars of all countries.\n\nIn recognition of the centenary of the foundation of the Rhodes Trust in 2003, four former Rhodes Scholars were awarded [[honorary degrees]] by the University of Oxford. These were [[John Brademas]], [[Bob Hawke]] (Western Australia and [[University College, Oxford|University]] 1953), [[Rex Nettleford]] and David R. Woods.

The first area was to be judged by examination, the second and third by ballot from the candidate's fellow students, and the fourth by the headmaster of the candidate's school. The results for each candidate would be sent to the trustees of Rhodes's will, or their appointees, who would then give a final assessment by averaging the marks for each candidate. Except for the candidates submitted by the four schools in southern Africa, the trustees were vested with the final decisions.\n\nRhodes also added that the scholars should be distributed among the Colleges at Oxford, that the trustees could remove any scholar at their discretion, and that the trustees were to host an annual dinner so scholars could discuss their \u201cexperiences and prospects.\u201d The trustees were also encouraged to invite to the dinner other \u201cpersons who have shown sympathy with the views expressed by me in this my Will.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, the same criteria underwent revision, and now specify no gender. They are now:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rhodesscholar.org/applying-for-the-scholarship/frequently-asked-questions/|title=Frequently Asked Questions - The Rhodes Scholarships|author=|date=|website=www.rhodesscholar.org}}</ref>\n\n*literary and scholastic attainments\n*energy to use one's talents to the full\n*truth, courage, devotion to duty, sympathy for and protection of the weak, kindliness, unselfishness and fellowship\n*moral force of character and instincts to lead, and to take an interest in one's fellow beings\n\nEach country's scholarship varies in its selectivity. In the United States, applicants must first pass a university-internal endorsement process, then proceed to one of the 16 U.S. districts committees. In 2016, approximately 2,500 students sought their institution's endorsement for the American Rhodes scholarship, among those 882 from 311 institutions were university-endorsed, of whom 32 were ultimately elected. As such, the American Rhodes Scholarship is more selective than the [[Churchill Scholarship]], [[Truman Scholarship]], [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Scholarship]], [[Gates Scholarship]], and [[Mitchell Scholarship]], but marginally less selective than the [[Marshall Scholarship]] in terms of university-endorsed applicants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rhodesscholar.org/news-and-announcements/american-rhodes-scholarship-winners-2017/|title=American Rhodes Scholarships Winners 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=www.rhodesscholar.org|access-date=2017-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/meet-the-2014-rhodes-scholars/2013/11/26/ea276b1a-5600-11e3-835d-e7173847c7cc_story.html|title=Meet the 2014 Rhodes Scholars|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-09-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marshallscholarship.org/about/statistics|title=Statistics|website=www.marshallscholarship.org|access-date=2017-04-08}}</ref> In Canada between 1997-2002, there were an average of 234 university-endorsed applicants annually for 11 scholarships, for an acceptance rate of 4.7%.

That stipulation would not change until 1977. Rhodes developed his scholarships partly through conversation with [[William Thomas Stead]], editor of ''[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]'' and confidant of Rhodes, and at one time an executor of the Will who was stricken from the role when he objected to Rhodes's ill-fated effort to seize the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]]. Shortly after Rhodes's death, Stead implied in a published article about the Will that he suggested that Rhodes open the scholarships to women.<ref>William Thomas Stead, \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=h2ZPAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA609&lpg=PA609&dq=mr.+rhodes%27s+will+and+its+genesis+stead&source=bl&ots=dlaGVFpnWK&sig=A4PK-gC5Ui7AitbMuBM-ECRaOqA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiluoqGm7bdAhVHNd8KHRJpBwoQ6AEwAXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=mr.%20rhodes's%20will%20and%20its%20genesis%20stead&f=false Mr. Rhodes\u2019s Will and Its Genesis]\", p. 479, ''The Review of Reviews'' 25, pp. 471\u201382</ref>  But Rhodes refused. Nothing more is said on the matter.\n\nAfter his death, the will was under the control of the Board of Trustees of the Rhodes Trust. In 1916, however, the trustees introduced a bill into the House of Commons that, catering to popular British sentiment during the [[World War I|War]], \"revoked and annulled\" the scholarships for Germans.<ref>See [[Angela Stent]], \"The Women's Bid for a Rhodes\", ''Change'', Vol. 6, No. 5 (June 1974), pp 13.16.</ref> Since then, legal control over the will has resided with Parliament.\n\nIn 1970, the trustees established the Rhodes Visiting Fellowships. Unlike the regular scholarship, a Visiting Fellow was expected to have a doctorate or comparable degree, and to use the two-year funded study to engage in independent research. Only 33 Visiting Fellowships were awarded.<ref>See [http://www.otago.ac.nz/library/exhibitions/rhodes_scholars/rhodes_women.html \"Rhodes Visiting Fellowships for Women\"].</ref>\n\nIn 1975, Parliament passed the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975|Sex Discrimination Act of 1975]] that banned discrimination based on sex, including in education.  The trustees then applied to the Secretary of State for Education to admit women into the scholarship, and in 1976 the request was granted.<ref>Philip Ziegler, ''Legacy: Cecil Rhodes, the Rhodes Trust and Rhodes Scholarships'', 2008, Yale University Press, p. 221.</ref> In 1977, women were finally admitted to the full scholarship. To a large degree, this change was the result of the advances of the feminist movement as well as the importance of [[Title IX]] legislation in the United States that made illegal sex discrimination in colleges that received federal financial assistance.\n\nBefore Parliament passed the 1975 Act, some universities protested against the exclusion of women by nominating female candidates, who were later disqualified at the state level of the American competition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1973/10/6/harvard-endorses-3-women-for-male-restricted/|title=Harvard Endorses 3 Women For Male-Restricted Rhodes {{!}} News {{!}} The Harvard Crimson|website=www.thecrimson.com|access-date=2016-09-01}}</ref> In 1977, the first year women were eligible, 24 women (out of 72 total scholars) were selected worldwide, with 13 women and 19 men selected from the United States.<ref name=WomenScholars>[https://archive.today/20121210090918/http://therhodesproject.wordpress.com/2010/01/29/second-class-citizens-how-women-became-rhodes-scholars/ \"Second-class citizens: How women became Rhodes Scholars\"], 29 January 2010, therhodesproject.wordpress.com</ref> Since then, the average female share of the scholarship in the United States had been around 35 percent.<ref name=WomenScholars/>\n\nIn his 2008 book ''Legacy: Cecil Rhodes, the Rhodes Trust and Rhodes Scholarship'' ([[Yale University Press]]), biographer and historian [[Philip Ziegler]] writes that \"The advent of women does not seem notably to have affected the balance of Scholars among the various professions, though it has reduced the incidence of worldly success.\"  The idea has persisted that women Rhodes Scholars are less successful overall than their male peers. But the Rhodes Project<ref>[http://rhodesproject.com/ The Rhodes Project]</ref> seeks to challenge this idea.<ref>See \"30 Years of Rhodes Women\" (https://www.americanrhodes.org/assets/attachments/347.pdf).</ref>\n\nIn South Africa, the will of Cecil Rhodes expressly allocated scholarships to four all-male private schools. In 1992, one of the four schools partnered with an all-girls school in order to allow female applicants. In 2012, the three remaining schools followed suit to allow women to apply.<ref name=\"rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/news/south-african-schools-scholarships|title=New partnerships for South African schools' Rhodes Scholarships|access-date=2016-09-01|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123172624/http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/news/south-african-schools-scholarships|archivedate=23 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Today, four of the nine scholarships allocated to South Africa are open only to students and alumni of these schools and partner schools.<ref name=\"rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk\"/>\n\n=== Exclusion of black Africans ===\nRhodes clearly specified in the will that \"No student shall be qualified or disqualified for election to a Scholarship on account of his race or religious opinions.\" Rhodes often in his writings used the word \"race\" with reference to black Africans, what he called \"natives\". In the context of the historical era, it would have been entirely out of character for Rhodes, and seen as absurd by the trustees and Oxford, to suggest that some of the scholarships might go to Africans. Furthermore, as Rhodes himself knew, and as Oxford University insisted in the early years of the scholarships, all applicants for the scholarship were required to pass the entrance exam for Oxford, or its equivalent, called [[Responsions]], which included ancient Greek and Latin. It would have been highly unusual for any Africans in that era to be admitted into those European schools in southern Africa that taught such subjects. Rhodes's scholarships intentionally excluded women and Africans, and those stipulations were followed carefully in the implementation<ref>E.g., Tim Nuttall, 2001, \"A Century of South African Rhodes Scholarships\", in A. Kenny, ed., ''The History of the Rhodes Trust 1902\u20131999'', Oxford University Press, pp. 251\u2013314</ref> Nothing in the will or in any of Rhodes' other writings suggests his desire to educate non-Europeans. In fact, the four South African schools named by Rhodes only admitted whites, and would not open their doors to black Africans until the end of [[apartheid]] in the early 1990s.\n\nBeginning in 1970, scholars began protesting against the fact that all Rhodes Scholars from southern Africa were white, with 120 Oxford dons and 80 of the 145 Rhodes Scholars in residence at the time signing a petition calling for non-white scholars to be elected in 1971.<ref name=\"Schaeper\">Schaeper, Thomas and Kathleen Schaeper. ''Rhodes Scholars: Oxford, and the Creation of an American Elite'', 2010. Berghahn Books: New York</ref>{{rp|238}} The case of South Africa was especially difficult to resolve, because in his will establishing the scholarships, unlike for other constituencies, Rhodes specifically allocated four scholarships to alumni of four white-only private secondary schools. According to Schaeper and Schaeper,<ref name=\"Schaeper\" />{{rp|236\u2013237}} the issue became \"explosive\" in the 1970s and 1980s as scholars argued that the scholarship be changed while the trustees argued they were powerless to change the will. Despite such protests, only in 1991 with the rise of the [[African National Congress]] did black South Africans begin to win the scholarships.<ref name=\"Schaeper\" />{{rp|240}}\n\n=== Criticism of Rhodes as colonialist ===\n{{see also|Rhodes Must Fall|Cecil Rhodes#Political Views}}\n\nPublic criticism of the scholarship has also focused on Cecil Rhodes's [[white supremacist]] views. For example, in 1966, regional committees in interviews asked a white American candidate to assure them he would not publicly belittle the scholarship after he referred to its founding on \"blood money\".<ref name=\"Schaeper\" />{{rp|238}} In 2015, a South African Rhodes Scholar, [[Ntokozo Qwabe]], began a campaign to address Rhodes' [[Cecil Rhodes#Political Views|controversial historical and political legacy]], with a focus on Qwabe\u2019s own views which included such statements as \"dismantling the open glorification of colonial genocide in educational and other public spaces \u2013 which makes it easy for British people to believe that these genocides were 'not that bad' \u2013 and props up the continuing structural legacies of British colonialism, neocolonialism, and ongoing imperialism\".<ref name=\"cherwell.org\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cherwell.org/2015/12/23/oxford-rhodes-scholar-attacked-for-quothypocrisyquot/|title=Oxford Rhodes scholar attacked for \"hypocrisy\"|last=Foxton|first=Hannah|date=2015-12-23|website=Cherwell.org|access-date=2016-09-01}}</ref> Among other things, the campaign called for the removal of a statue of Rhodes from Oriel College and changes to Oxford's curriculum.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jun/18/oxford-uni-must-decolonise-its-campus-and-curriculum-say-students|title=Oxford Uni must decolonise its campus and curriculum, say students|last=Rhoden-Paul|first=Andr\u00e9|date=2015-06-18|newspaper=The Guardian|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-09-01}}</ref> While the college agreed to review the placement of the statue, the Chancellor of the university, Lord Patten, was critical of the accuracy of Qwabe\u2019s statements and warned against \"pandering to contemporary views\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/12094277/Cecil-Rhodes-Oxford-University-students-must-confront-views-they-find-objectionable-says-new-head.html|title=Cecil Rhodes: Lord Patten warns against 'pandering to contemporary views' over statue row|access-date=2016-09-01|date=2016-01-13|last1=Espinoza|first1=Javier}}</ref>\n\nA group of Rhodes Scholars also created the group Redress Rhodes whose mission was to \"attain a more critical, honest, and inclusive reflection of the legacy of Cecil John Rhodes\" and to \"make reparative justice a more central theme for Rhodes Scholars.\" Their demands include, among other things, shifting the Rhodes Scholarships awarded exclusively to previously all-white South African schools (rather than the at-large national pool), dedicating a \"space at Rhodes House for the critical engagement with Cecil Rhodes' legacy, as well as imperial history\", and ending a ceremonial toast Rhodes Scholars make to the founder.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/redress-rhodes|title=Redress Rhodes|website=The Rhodes Scholarships|access-date=2016-09-01|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923213857/http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/redress-rhodes|archivedate=23 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> While the group does not have a position on the removal of the statue, its co-founder has called for the scholarship to be renamed as it is \"the ultimate form of veneration and colonial apologism; it's a large part of why many continue to understand Rhodes as a benevolent founder and benefactor.\"<ref name=\"theguardian.com\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/12/cecil-rhodes-scholars-reject-hypocrisy-claims-amid-row-over-oriel-college-statue|title=Oxford scholars reject hypocrisy claims amid row over Cecil Rhodes statue|last=Khomami|first=Nadia|date=2016-01-13|newspaper=The Guardian|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-09-01}}</ref>\n\nPublic criticism has also focused on the alleged hypocrisy of applying for and accepting the Rhodes Scholarship while criticizing it, with University of Cambridge academic [[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], writing in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', arguing that Scholars \"[could not] have your cake and eat it here: I mean you can't whitewash Rhodes out of history, but go on using his cash.\"<ref name=\"cherwell.org\"/><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/12062808/Rhodes-scholar-branded-hypocrite-for-leading-campaign-to-have-Rhodes-statue-removed-criticised-by-Mary-Beard.html|title=Rhodes scholar branded hypocrite for leading campaign to have Rhodes' statue removed criticised by Mary Beard|access-date=2016-09-01|date=2015-12-21|last1=Espinoza|first1=Javier}}</ref> Reacting to this criticism, Qwabe replied that \"all that [Rhodes] looted must absolutely be returned immediately.

''Rhodes Scholars: Oxford, and the Creation of an American Elite'', Berghahn Books: New York, 2010 p. 314.</ref> that while \"few of them have 'changed the world' ... most of them have been a credit to their professions ... and communities\", finding that \"the great majority of Rhodes Scholars have had solid, respectable careers.\" Eight former Rhodes scholars subsequently became heads of government or heads of [[sovereign state|state]], including [[Wasim Sajjad]] (Pakistan), [[Bill Clinton]] (United States), [[Dom Mintoff]] (Malta), [[John Turner]] (Canada), [[Norman Manley]] (Jamaica) and three Australian Prime Ministers: [[Bob Hawke]], [[Tony Abbott]] and [[Malcolm Turnbull]].\n\nFrom 1951 to 1997, 32% of American Rhodes Scholars pursued careers in education and academia, 20% in law, 15% in business and 10% in medicine and science.<ref>Schaeper, Thomas and Kathleen Schaeper. ''Rhodes Scholars: Oxford, and the Creation of an American Elite'', Berghahn Books: New York, 2010, p. 279.</ref> Although Cecil Rhodes imagined that scholars would \"pursue a full-time career in government [...] the number of scholars in local, state and federal government has remained at a steady 7 percent\" over the past century. Of the 200 or so scholars who have spent their careers in government, \"most of them have had solid, but undistinguished careers,\" while \"perhaps forty or more can be said to have had a significant, national impact in their particular areas.\"<ref>Schaeper, Thomas and Kathleen Schaeper. \"Rhodes Scholars: Oxford, and the Creation of an American Elite,\" 2010. Berghahn Books: New York, p. 311.</ref>\n\nThe highest-ranking career choice for Rhodes Scholars is education and academia, with many becoming deans of law and medical schools and others becoming professors and lecturers. Many of the most distinguished Rhodes Scholars, such as Zambian activist [[Lucy Banda-Sichone|Lucy Banda]], have become prominent members of the civil rights movement.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/zambian-activist-lucy-banda-becomes-first-female-rhodes-scholar-to-have-portrait-displayed-at-oxford-a6766946.html|title=The first ever portrait of a female Rhodes scholar has been unveiled|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-11-23}}</ref> In 1990, third-wave feminist author Naomi Wolf put forward ideas about beauty and power with her book ''[[The Beauty Myth]]'', ushering in a new type of feminism that has risen to prominence in the digital age.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/oct/18/classics.shopping|title=Women: A quick reminder ...

Howard Florey was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship in 1922 after studying medicine at Adelaide Medical school. In 1939 Florey, along with fellow scientist [[Ernst Chain|Ernst Boris Chain]], led the team that successfully isolated and purified penicillin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1945/florey/biographical/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1945|website=NobelPrize.org|access-date=2018-11-23}}</ref>\n\n=== Human rights, social justice and advocacy ===\n\n==== Law ====\nChallenging some of the convictions of the scholarship's founder is not a recent occurrence. As early as 1931, [[Afrikaans]]-born anti-apartheid lawyer Bram Fischer and Rhodes Scholar campaigned for equal rights for all South Africans. This led him to join the [[Communist Party of South Africa]]. Fischer was struck off the roll by the Johannesburg Bar Council in 1965 after he skipped bail on charges under the Suppression of Communism Act. He was later arrested and sentenced to life in prison.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nelsonmandela.org/news/entry/bram-fischer-a-hero-born-100-years-ago|title=Bram Fischer: a hero born 100 years ago \u2013 Nelson Mandela Foundation|website=www.nelsonmandela.org|access-date=2018-11-23}}</ref> Other Rhodes Scholars have taken on difficult social causes with more success. In 1980, former Rhodes Scholar [[Ann Olivarius]] sued Yale University over their mis-handling of on-campus sexual harassment complaints.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11632346/Sex-harassment-in-British-universities-What-date-rape-inventor-thinks.html|title=What the woman who coined the term \u2018date rape\u2019 thinks of British universities|last=Goldhill|first=Olivia|date=2015-05-27|access-date=2018-11-23|issn=0307-1235}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11570529/Revenge-porn-This-sexual-crime-can-be-stopped-with-street-tactics.html|title=Revenge porn: 'Street tactics' can stamp out this industrial scale sexual crime|last=Olivarius|first=Dr Ann|date=2015-05-11|access-date=2018-11-23|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\n==== Education and child welfare ====\nAfter leaving Oxford to write his first novel, former Rhodes Scholar [[Jonathan Kozol]] volunteered as a teacher in [[Roxbury, Boston]]. He would go on to write ''Death at an Early Age: The Destruction of the Hearts and Minds of Negro Children in the Boston Public Schools,'' after witnessing first-hand the devastating effect educational inequality was having on America.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2007-01-01|title=Kozol, Jonathan|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-2587100047.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181124055047/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-2587100047.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2018-11-24}}</ref> Rhodes Scholars Marc Kielburger and Roxanne Joyal conduct similar work with their organisation Free the Children.

South African Justice Edwin Cameron initially focussed his attention on law and employment law, but later worked in the field of LGBT rights as well as co-founding the Aids Consortium. Two-time Pulitzer-winning journalist [[Nicholas Kristof|Nick Kristof]] was pivotal in shedding light on atrocities such as Tiananmen Square and the genocide in Darfur.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/column/nicholas-kristof|title=Nicholas Kristof|access-date=2018-11-23}}</ref> Professor [[Sandra Fredman]] has also written extensively on anti-discrimination law, human rights law and labour law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://denning.law.ox.ac.uk/members/profile.php?lecturer_code=fredmans|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121223021844/http://denning.law.ox.ac.uk/members/profile.php?lecturer_code=fredmans|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-12-23|title=Oxford Law :: Profile of Sandra Fredman|date=2012-12-23|work=archive.is|access-date=2018-11-23}}</ref> [[Rhiana Gunn-Wright]] was the creator of the [[Green New Deal]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060107485|title=CLIMATE: Meet the scholar crafting the 'Green New Deal'|website=www.eenews.net|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref>\n\n=== Medical innovation ===\n\n==== Genetics ====\nIn 2014, Iranian Rhodes Scholar and front-person for [[Indie rock|indie-rock]] band Thousand Days, [[Pardis Sabeti]], used genome sequencing and computational genetics to identify the source of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/ebola-outbreak-strains-sequenced-36944|title=Ebola Outbreak Strains Sequenced|website=The Scientist Magazine\u00ae|access-date=2018-11-23}}</ref>\n\nAnother Rhodes Scholar working in [[genome]] research is the mathematician and geneticist [[Eric Lander]].

Warren was lambasted by his peers who told him that the study of English literature was a soft option; seeking to rebut such attacks, he introduced new critical ideas into the study of poetry and fiction, and these ideas went on to change how literature was taught at undergraduate and postgraduate levels, not only in America itself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/m_r/ransom/life.htm|title=John Crowe Ransom's Life and Career|website=www.english.illinois.edu|access-date=2018-11-23}}</ref>\n\n==== Hip-hop ====\nIn 2006 (before receiving a Rhodes Scholarship), lawyer and current Democratic Congressman [[Antonio Delgado (politician)|Antonio Delgado]] critiqued capitalism and racial injustice under the name \"AD the Voice\"; arguably, however, his most significant contribution to [[hip-hop]] is not his music but the community outreach work he does in [[New York's 19th congressional district]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/17/us/politics/antonio-delgado-lyrics.html|title=A Congressional Candidate Used to Be a Rapper.

As well as winning a Pulitzer for non-fiction, Greene made some ground-breaking discoveries in the field of superstring theory and was one of the cosmologists to co-discover superstring theory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://codcourier.org/8400/news/theoretical-physicist-brian-greene-proposes-string-theory-as-the-theory-of-everything/|title=Theoretical physicist Brian Greene proposes String Theory as the theory of everything \u2013 The Courier|last=Weslo|first=Joey|website=codcourier.org|access-date=2018-11-23|date=2018-04-03}}</ref>\n\n== Comparison to other post-graduate scholarships ==\n{{see also|Marshall_Scholarship#Comparison to other post-graduate scholarships|label 1 = Comparison of the Marshall Scholarship to other scholarships}}\nAs the first large-scale programme of international scholarships,<ref name=\":1\">The American Rhodes Scholarships: A Review of the First Forty Years, Review author[s]: Harvie Branscomb, The American Historical Review \u00a9 1947 American Historical Association</ref> the Rhodes Scholarship inspired the creation of other awards, including:\n\n* The international [[Fulbright Program]] to teach study and research or teach English in over 150 countries (1946)\n* The [[Marshall Scholarship]] for Americans to study at any university in the United Kingdom (1953), an official British scholarship scheme for Americans\n* The [[Chevening Scholarship]] for citizens from 144 countries and territories to undertake postgraduate studies or courses in universities in the United Kingdom (1983), an official British scholarship scheme for countries other than the United States\n* The Churchill Scholarship for Americans to study at [[Churchill College, Cambridge|Churchill College]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] (1959)\n* The [[Kennedy Scholarship]] for British nationals to study at [[Harvard University]] or the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (1964)\n* The Harkness Fellowship for citizens of nine countries to conduct research related to health policy in the United States (1997)\n* The Mitchell Scholarship for Americans to study at any university in Ireland (2000)\n* The international [[Gates Cambridge Scholarship]] to study at the [[University of Cambridge]] (2000)\n* The [[Clarendon_Fund|Clarendon Scholarship]] for \"the best and brightest minds in any given field\" to pursue post-graduate study at the [[University of Oxford]] (2001)\n* The [[John Monash Scholars]]hip for Australians to study at any university worldwide (2004)\n* The international [[Yenching Scholars]]hip for study at [[Peking University]] (2015)\n* The international [[Schwarzman Scholars]]hip for study at [[Tsinghua University]] (2016)\n* The international [[Knight-Hennessy Scholars]] to study at [[Stanford University]] (2018)\n\nIn structure and selection criteria, the scholarship is most similar to the Gates Cambridge Scholarship, Marshall Scholarship and UK Fulbright Program. Like the Rhodes, the Marshall is a two-stage geographic scholarship organised through districts in selecting countries. Like the Gates Cambridge, the Rhodes is tenable at only one university. In structure, the Marshall Scholarship is more flexible than the Rhodes Scholarship, in that Marshall Scholars can study at any British university and can also attend a different university each year during a scholar's tenure. In addition, a limited number of one-year Marshall scholarships are available. The Marshall Scholarship also places a greater emphasis on academic achievement and potential, requiring a minimum grade point average of 3.7. For example, winners of the Marshall Scholarship from [[Harvard University]] have had average [[Grading in education|GPAs]] of 3.92, while winners of the Rhodes Scholarship from Harvard have had an average GPA of 3.8.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url =http://cabot.harvard.edu/content/Post-Graduate.docx|title =Harvard Post Graduate|publisher =Harvard|url-status =dead|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20141224142940/http://cabot.harvard.edu/content/Post-Graduate.docx|archivedate =24 December 2014|df =dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Rhodes Scholars]]\n* [[Gates Cambridge Scholarship]]\n* [[Chevening Scholarship]]\n* [[Fulbright Scholarship]]\n* [[Marshall Scholarship]]\n* [[Clarendon Scholarship]]\n* [[Jardine Scholarship]]\n* [[Knight-Hennessy Scholars]]\n* [[Thouron Award]]\n* [[Schwarzman Scholars]]\n* [[Yenching Academy]]\n*[[Rise (education program)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Godfrey Elton, ''The First Fifty Years of The Rhodes Trust and Scholarships, 1903-1953''.

The entire K9 fleet operated by the ROK Armed Forces is now undergoing upgrades to K9A1 standard, and a further development of a K9A2 variant is in process.\n\n==History==\n===Development===\nIn 1980s, the ROK Armed Forces came in need of new artillery system to contest North Korean equipment. The armed forces operated [[M107 self-propelled gun]] and [[M109 howitzer|K55 self-propelled howitzer]]; however, they had shorter firing range compared to [[Koksan (artillery)|M-1978 Koksan]] and were outnumbered by various North Korean artillery. With the success of designing and manufacturing KH-178 and KH-179 towed artillery, and experience gained by license producing K55 (KM109A2), the Ministry of Defense ordered to develop new system that has longer firing range, faster firing rate, and high mobility. The development started in 1989 and was led by the [[Agency for Defense Development]] (ADD) and Samsung Aerospace Industries (now Hanwha Defense).<ref name=\"K9 Developer Interview (1)\">{{cite AV media |date=2015-09-16 |title=[\ucca8\ub2e8\uad6d\uac00\uc758 \ucd08\uc11d, \ubc29\uc704\uc0b0\uc5c5] \uc790\uc8fc\ud3ec\uc758 \uc0c8 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc744 \uc5f4\ub2e4 - K-9 \ucc9c\ub465(1\ubd80) |language=Korean |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2tivketAK0 |publisher=\uad6d\ubc29TV}}</ref>\n\nThe ADD first offered upgrades on existing K55, inspired by the United States' M109 Howitzer Improvement Program (HIP), but was rejected by the [[Republic of Korea Army]]. As a result, the ADD determined to create new weapon system and worked on conceptual model till 1991. Early concept requested by the military includes river crossing capability and installation of [[M61 Vulcan]] as anti-air weapon, which were removed due to unnecessity for such long-range weapon.<ref name=\"K9 Developer Interview (1)\" />\n\nIn 1992, the Ground System Division of United Defense LP (now BAE Systems Land and Armaments) invited members of the ADD for its first M109A6 Paladin release ceremony and expressed interest in participating Korea's self-propelled howitzer program by upgrading K55 to Paladin standard, which was rejected by South Korea.<ref name=\"K9 Developer Interview (2)\">{{cite AV media |date=2015-10-15 |title=[\ucca8\ub2e8\uad6d\uac00\uc758 \ucd08\uc11d, \ubc29\uc704\uc0b0\uc5c5] \uc790\uc8fc\ud3ec\uc758 \uc0c8 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc744 \uc5f4\ub2e4 - K-9 \ucc9c\ub465(2\ubd80) |language=Korean |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh_CVAm3XNo |publisher=\uad6d\ubc29TV}}</ref>\n\nBy late 1990s, internal review showed localization of 107 out of 235 (45.5%) technologies required to build the artillery. After the review, South Korea decided to continue developing domestic main system, main gun, 155&nbsp;mm ammunition, fire control system, structure, and autoloader. On the other hand, engine, transmission, and INS were chosen to be imported from foreign partners, and license produce hydropneumatic suspension to boost up localization by 70%. The engineers faced biggest challenge on designing main gun and suspension due to lack of experience; while licensing the K55, its main gun was brought as finished product and suspension was produced under knowledge base from the United States.<ref name=\"K9 Developer Interview (2)\" />\n\nThe turret servo electrohydraulic system is a derive from that of [[K1 88-Tank|K1 MBT]].

In addition, one howitzer experienced a problem during the exercise when a shell became stuck in the barrel, disabling it. Two units received slight damage to their firing control systems during the initial North Korean attack, meaning only three out of the six units were able to counterattack. Eventually, the howitzer that had barrel problems joined the second counterattack after receiving field repairs. The K9s fired only one shell every 1.5 minutes, because the marines had to carry the shells from the armory and manually load the howitzer under heavy fire after exhausting B/L rounds.<ref>[http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=100&oid=214&aid=0000161667 \"K-9 \uc790\uc8fc\ud3ec\uc5d0 \ud3ec\ud0c4 \ud55c \ubc1c\ub3c4 \uc5c6\uc5c8\ub2e4\"], MBC, 27.

The entire K9 fleet operated by the ROK Armed Forces is now undergoing upgrades to K9A1 standard, and a further development of a K9A2 variant is in process.\n\n==History==\n===Development===\nIn 1980s, the ROK Armed Forces came in need of new artillery system to contest North Korean equipment. The armed forces operated [[M107 self-propelled gun]] and [[M109 howitzer|K55 self-propelled howitzer]]; however, they had shorter firing range compared to [[Koksan (artillery)|M-1978 Koksan]] and were outnumbered by various North Korean artillery. With the success of designing and manufacturing KH-178 and KH-179 towed artillery, and experience gained by license producing K55 (KM109A2), the Ministry of Defense ordered to develop new system that has longer firing range, faster firing rate, and high mobility. The development started in 1989 and was led by the [[Agency for Defense Development]] (ADD) and Samsung Aerospace Industries (now Hanwha Defense).<ref name=\"K9 Developer Interview (1)\">{{cite AV media |date=2015-09-16 |title=[\ucca8\ub2e8\uad6d\uac00\uc758 \ucd08\uc11d, \ubc29\uc704\uc0b0\uc5c5] \uc790\uc8fc\ud3ec\uc758 \uc0c8 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc744 \uc5f4\ub2e4 - K-9 \ucc9c\ub465(1\ubd80) |language=Korean |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2tivketAK0 |publisher=\uad6d\ubc29TV}}</ref>\n\nThe ADD first offered upgrades on existing K55, inspired by the United States' M109 Howitzer Improvement Program (HIP), but was rejected by the [[Republic of Korea Army]]. As a result, the ADD determined to create new weapon system and worked on conceptual model till 1991. Early concept requested by the military includes river crossing capability and installation of [[M61 Vulcan]] as anti-air weapon, which were removed due to unnecessity for such long-range weapon.<ref name=\"K9 Developer Interview (1)\"></ref>\n\nIn 1992, the Ground System Division of United Defense LP (now BAE Systems Land and Armaments) invited members of the ADD for its first M109A6 Paladin release ceremony and expressed interest in participating Korea's self-propelled howitzer program by upgrading K55 to Paladin standard, which was rejected by South Korea.<ref name=\"K9 Developer Interview (2)\">{{cite AV media |date=2015-10-15 |title=[\ucca8\ub2e8\uad6d\uac00\uc758 \ucd08\uc11d, \ubc29\uc704\uc0b0\uc5c5] \uc790\uc8fc\ud3ec\uc758 \uc0c8 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc744 \uc5f4\ub2e4 - K-9 \ucc9c\ub465(2\ubd80) |language=Korean |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh_CVAm3XNo |publisher=\uad6d\ubc29TV}}</ref>\n\nBy late 1990s, internal review showed localization of 107 out of 235 (45.5%) technologies required to build the artillery.

On the other hand, engine, transmission, and INS were chosen to be imported from foreign partners, and license produce hydropneumatic suspension to boost up localization by 70%. The engineers faced biggest challenge on designing main gun and suspension due to lack of experience; while licensing the K55, its main gun was brought as finished product and suspension was produced under knowledge base from the United States.<ref name=\"K9 Developer Interview (2)\"></ref>\n\nThe turret servo electrohydraulic system is a derive from that of [[K1 88-Tank|K1 MBT]].

In addition, one howitzer experienced a problem during the exercise when a shell became stuck in the barrel, disabling it. Two units received slight damage to their firing control systems during the initial North Korean attack, meaning only three out of the six units were able to counterattack. Eventually, the howitzer that had barrel problems joined the second counterattack after receiving field repairs.

Separately, the [[Nuclear Suppliers Group]] has agreed on guidelines for nuclear exports, including reactors and fuel.  Those guidelines condition such exports on comprehensive safeguards by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], which are designed to verify that nuclear energy is not diverted from peaceful use to weapons programs. Though neither India, Israel, nor Pakistan have signed the NPT, India argues that instead of addressing the central objective of universal and comprehensive non-proliferation, the treaty creates a club of \"nuclear haves\" and a larger group of \"nuclear have-nots\" by restricting the legal possession of nuclear weapons to those states that tested them before 1967, who alone are free to possess and multiply their nuclear stockpiles.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.indianembassy.org/policy/CTBT/embassy_non_proliferation.htm \n |title=Embassy of India: Nuclear Non-proliferation \n |accessdate=June 1, 2006 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708024145/http://www.indianembassy.org/policy/CTBT/embassy_non_proliferation.htm \n |archivedate=July 8, 2006 \n}}</ref>\nIndia insists on a comprehensive action plan for a nuclear-free world within a specific time-frame and has also adopted a voluntary \"no first use policy\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nLed by the U.S., other states have set up an informal group, the [[Nuclear Suppliers Group]] (NSG), to  control exports of nuclear materials, equipment and technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/nuke/control/nsg/index.html|title=Nuclear Suppliers Group|website=Fas.org}}</ref> Consequently, India was left outside the international nuclear order, which forced India to develop its own resources for each stage of the nuclear fuel cycle and power generation, including next generation reactors such as fast [[breeder reactor]]s and a [[thorium]] breeder reactor<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ans.org/pubs/journals/nt/va-133-1-1-32|title=A Thorium Breeder Reactor|website=Ans.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2005/aug/25nuke.htm|title=India unveils 'world's safest nuclear reactor'|website=Rediff.com}}</ref> known as the [[Advanced Heavy Water Reactor]]. In addition to impelling India to achieve success in developing these new reactor technologies, the sanctions also provided India with the impetus to continue developing [[India and weapons of mass destruction|its own nuclear weapons technology]] with a specific goal of achieving self-sufficiency for all key components for weapons design, testing and production.\n\nGiven that India is estimated to possess reserves of about 80,000\u2013112,369 tons of [[uranium]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/atomsforwarfinal4.pdf|title=Atoms for War?

Although no Indian analyst, let alone a policy maker, has ever advocated any nuclear inventory that even remotely approximates such numbers, this heuristic exercise confirms that New Delhi has the capability to produce a gigantic nuclear arsenal while subsisting well within the lowest estimates of its known uranium reserves.</blockquote>\n\nHowever, because the amount of nuclear fuel required for the electricity generation sector is far greater than that required to maintain a nuclear weapons program, and since India's estimated reserve of uranium represents only 1% of the world's known uranium reserves, the NSG's uranium export restrictions mainly affected Indian nuclear power generation capacity. Specifically, the NSG sanctions challenge India's long-term plans to expand and fuel its civilian nuclear power generation capacity from its current output of about 4GWe  (GigaWatt electricity) to a power output of 20GWe by 2020; assuming the planned expansion used conventional Uranium/Plutonium fueled [[heavy water]] and light water nuclear power plants.\n\nConsequently, India's nuclear isolation constrained expansion of its civil nuclear program, but left India relatively immune to foreign reactions to a prospective nuclear test.

In particular,  portions of the agreement dealing with guaranteeing India a fuel supply or allowing India to maintain a strategic reserve of nuclear fuel appear to be diametrically opposed to what the Indian parliament was led to expect from the agreement:\nPrime Minister Manmohan Singh's statement in parliament is totally at variance with the Bush Administration's communication to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which says India will not be allowed to stockpile such nuclear fuel stocks as to undercut American leverage to re-impose sanctions. To drive home this point, it says the 123 Agreement is not inconsistent with the Hyde Act's stipulation\u2014the little-known 'Barack Obama Amendment' \u2013 that the supply of nuclear fuel should be \"commensurate with reasonable operating requirements\". The 'strategic reserve' that is crucial to India's nuclear program is, therefore, a non-starter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypioneer.com/columnist1.asp?main_variable=Columnist&file_name=KANCHAN196.txt&writer=KANCHAN&validit=yes |title=The Pioneer > Columnists |website=The Pioneer |location=India |accessdate=October 2, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the agreement, as a result of its compliance with the Hyde Act, contained a direct linkage between shutting down US nuclear trade with India and any potential future Indian nuclear weapons test, a point that was factually inconsistent with explicit reassurances made on this subject by Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, during final parliamentary debate on the nuclear deal.

The waiver's Section 3(e) refers to this key paragraph, which allows a supplier to call for a special NSG meeting, and seek termination of cooperation, in the event of a test or any other \"violation of a supplier-recipient understanding\". The recently leaked Bush administration letter to Congress has cited how this Paragraph 16 rule will effectively bind India to the Hyde Act's conditions on the pain of a U.S.-sponsored cut-off of all multilateral cooperation.

Separately, the [[Nuclear Suppliers Group]] has agreed on guidelines for nuclear exports, including reactors and fuel.  Those guidelines condition such exports on comprehensive safeguards by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], which are designed to verify that nuclear energy is not diverted from peaceful use to weapons programs. Though neither India, Israel, nor Pakistan have signed the NPT, India argues that instead of addressing the central objective of universal and comprehensive non-proliferation, the treaty creates a club of \"nuclear haves\" and a larger group of \"nuclear have-nots\" by restricting the legal possession of nuclear weapons to those states that tested them before 1967, who alone are free to possess and multiply their nuclear stockpiles.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.indianembassy.org/policy/CTBT/embassy_non_proliferation.htm \n |title=Embassy of India: Nuclear Non-proliferation \n |accessdate=June 1, 2006 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708024145/http://www.indianembassy.org/policy/CTBT/embassy_non_proliferation.htm \n |archivedate=July 8, 2006 \n}}</ref>\nIndia insists on a comprehensive action plan for a nuclear-free world within a specific time-frame and has also adopted a voluntary \"no first use policy\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nLed by the U.S., other states have set up an informal group, the [[Nuclear Suppliers Group]] (NSG), to  control exports of nuclear materials, equipment and technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/nuke/control/nsg/index.html|title=Nuclear Suppliers Group|website=Fas.org}}</ref> Consequently, India was left outside the international nuclear order, which forced India to develop its own resources for each stage of the nuclear fuel cycle and power generation, including next generation reactors such as fast [[breeder reactor]]s and a [[thorium]] breeder reactor<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ans.org/pubs/journals/nt/va-133-1-1-32|title=A Thorium Breeder Reactor|website=Ans.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2005/aug/25nuke.htm|title=India unveils 'world's safest nuclear reactor'|website=Rediff.com}}</ref> known as the [[Advanced Heavy Water Reactor]].

Although no Indian analyst, let alone a policy maker, has ever advocated any nuclear inventory that even remotely approximates such numbers, this heuristic exercise confirms that New Delhi has the capability to produce a gigantic nuclear arsenal while subsisting well within the lowest estimates of its known uranium reserves.</blockquote>\n\nHowever, because the amount of nuclear fuel required for the electricity generation sector is far greater than that required to maintain a nuclear weapons program, and since India's estimated reserve of uranium represents only 1% of the world's known uranium reserves, the NSG's uranium export restrictions mainly affected Indian nuclear power generation capacity. Specifically, the NSG sanctions challenge India's long term plans to expand and fuel its civilian nuclear power generation capacity from its current output of about 4GWe  (GigaWatt electricity) to a power output of 20GWe by 2020; assuming the planned expansion used conventional Uranium/Plutonium fueled [[heavy water]] and light water nuclear power plants.\n\nConsequently, India's nuclear isolation constrained expansion of its civil nuclear program, but left India relatively immune to foreign reactions to a prospective nuclear test.

Although many mainstream political parties including the [[Congress(I)]] supported the deal along with regional parties like [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] and [[Rashtriya Janata Dal]] its realization ran into difficulties in the face of stiff political opposition in India. Also, in November 2007, former Indian Military chiefs, bureaucrats and scientists drafted a letter to Members of Parliament expressing their support for the deal.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.indianexpress.com/story/239308._.html |title = 'The question is can we get a better n-deal?

The [[Samajwadi Party]] (SP) which was with the [[Left Front (West Bengal)|Left Front]] in opposing the deal changed its stand after discussing with ex-president of India and scientist Dr [[A. P. J. Abdul Kalam]]. The SP then supported the government and the deal. The Indian Government survived a vote of confidence by 275\u2013256 after the Left Front withdrew their support to the government over this dispute.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7519860.stm |title=Indian government survives vote |date=July 22, 2008 |work=BBC News |accessdate=November 25, 2011}}</ref> Incidentally, results showed ten MPs belonging to the opposing [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) cross-voting in the favor of the government.\n\nAs details were revealed about serious inconsistencies between what the Indian parliament was told about the deal, and the facts about the agreement that were presented by the Bush administration to the US Congress, opposition grew in India against the deal. In particular,  portions of the agreement dealing with guaranteeing India a fuel supply or allowing India to maintain a strategic reserve of nuclear fuel appear to be diametrically opposed to what the Indian parliament was led to expect from the agreement:\nPrime Minister Manmohan Singh's statement in parliament is totally at variance with the Bush Administration's communication to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which says India will not be allowed to stockpile such nuclear fuel stocks as to undercut American leverage to re-impose sanctions. To drive home this point, it says the 123 Agreement is not inconsistent with the Hyde Act's stipulation\u2014the little-known 'Barack Obama Amendment' \u2013 that the supply of nuclear fuel should be \"commensurate with reasonable operating requirements\". The 'strategic reserve' that is crucial to India's nuclear program is, therefore, a non-starter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypioneer.com/columnist1.asp?main_variable=Columnist&file_name=KANCHAN196.txt&writer=KANCHAN&validit=yes |title=The Pioneer > Columnists |website=The Pioneer |location=India |accessdate=October 2, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the agreement, as a result of its compliance with the Hyde Act, contained a direct linkage between shutting down US nuclear trade with India and any potential future Indian nuclear weapons test, a point that was factually inconsistent with explicit reassurances made on this subject by Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, during final parliamentary debate on the nuclear deal. As professor Brahma Chellaney, an expert in strategic affairs and one of the authors of the Indian Nuclear Doctrine,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.rediff.com/news/2006/apr/27brahma.htm?zcc=rl |title=Brahma Chellaney a strategic affairs expert, is a professor at the Centre for Policy Research.

The NSG waiver is overtly anchored in NSG Guidelines Paragraph 16, which deals with the consequence of \"an explosion of a nuclear device\". The waiver's Section 3(e) refers to this key paragraph, which allows a supplier to call for a special NSG meeting, and seek termination of cooperation, in the event of a test or any other \"violation of a supplier-recipient understanding\". The recently leaked Bush administration letter to Congress has cited how this Paragraph 16 rule will effectively bind India to the Hyde Act's conditions on the pain of a U.S.-sponsored cut-off of all multilateral cooperation. India will not be able to escape from the U.S.-set conditions by turning to other suppliers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chellaney.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!4913C7C8A2EA4A30!788.entry |title=Stagecraft and Statecraft&#58; India's retarded nuclear deterrent |publisher=Chellaney.spaces.live.com |accessdate=2008-10-02|date=2008-09-21 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Indian parliament vote==\n{{Further|2008 Lok Sabha vote of confidence|Notes-for-Vote scandal}}\nOn July 9, 2008, India formally submitted the safeguards agreement to the IAEA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isis-online.org/publications/southasia/India_IAEA_safeguards.pdf|title=Text of India-IAEA Safeguards Agreement|website=Isis-online.org}}</ref> This development came after the Prime Minister of India [[Manmohan Singh]] returned from the [[34th G8 summit]] meeting in [[Hokkaido]], Japan, where he met with U.S. President George W.

Consequently, Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC) is being developed into a major Amphibious Warfare Hub for Indian Navy and it is considered crucial to counter China's strategic moves in the Indian Ocean as well as ensure security of these sea lanes.\n\nIn 2011, it was reported that India is looking for up to four LHD type aviation and amphibious ships, with designs to come from foreign firms. In November 2013, the Defence Ministry has issued a tender for building warships which can carry helicopters. The tender was issued as part of efforts by the government to build the capabilities of the indigenous industry.\n\n==Criteria for selection==\nAlthough moderately flexible, the basic criteria are:<ref name=DID112711/><ref name=toi2011-09-10/><ref name=\"navyrecognition.com\"/><ref name=dnd13/>\n:# '''Size''': Should be no more than 215 metres long; and draught at full load must not exceed 8 metres.\n:# '''Aviation facilities''': Aviation deck to carry 10 heavy helicopters, up to 35 tons.\n:# '''Troop space''': Accommodate 1,430 personnel, including 60 officers, 470 sailors and 900 troops.\n:# '''Load carrying capability''': Combination of landing craft, including landing craft mechanised to ferry tanks; landing craft, vehicle, personnel to transport troops; and the fast-moving landing craft air cushion vessels. Should carry six main battle tanks, 20 infantry combat vehicles and 40 heavy trucks.\n:# '''On-board weapons''': Point-defence missile system, close-in weapon system, an anti-torpedo decoy system, a chaff system, and heavy and light machine guns.\n:# '''Range and endurance''': Endurance of 45 days, with a maximum sustained speed of not less than 20 knots.\n:# '''Propulsion''': Powered by electric propulsion systems.\n:# '''Special Features''': Specialised areas from hospital facilities to naval command centre.\n:# '''Role''': Conducting maritime surveillance, special operations, search and rescue, medical support and humanitarian aid.\n\n==Contenders==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" align=\"center\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|----- bgcolor=#006699\n!

It is also a strong contender for the title of \"Multi-Role Support Vessel\" as it meets each criterion perfectly. With its [[Flight Deck#Ski-jump ramp|ski jump]] for [[STOVL]] operations, it is conceptually similar to a {{sclass-|Wasp|amphibious assault ship|0}} LHD and can be used to operate [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|F-35B]] in case [[Indian Navy]] wants. Nonetheless, if India would be willing to compromise with a smaller vessel or LPD, then this would expand Navantia's scope by including  the {{sclass-|Galicia|landing platform dock|0}} LPD, which was co-developed with Royal Schelde.\n\n== Progress ==\nThe Indian Navy issued a \u20b916,000 [[crore]] (160 Billion INR - US$2.6 billion) domestic tender to three domestic shipyards - [[Larsen & Toubro]] (L&T) which has tied up with Navantia of Spain, [[Pipavav Shipyard|Pipavav Defence and Offshore Engineering]] which has partnered with France's DCNS, and [[ABG Shipyard]] (Later disqualified due to poor financial health)<ref name=\":0\" /> which has partnered with United States' Alion.

Consequently, Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC) is being developed into a major Amphibious Warfare Hub for Indian Navy and it is considered crucial to counter China's strategic moves in the Indian Ocean as well as ensure security of these sea lanes.\n\nIn 2011, it was reported that India is looking for up to four LHD type aviation and amphibious ships, with designs to come from foreign firms. In November 2013, the Defence Ministry has issued a tender for building warships which can carry helicopters. The tender was issued as part of efforts by the government to build the capabilities of the indigenous industry.\n\n==Criteria for selection==\nAlthough moderately flexible, the basic criteria are:<ref name=DID112711/><ref name=toi2011-09-10/><ref name=\"navyrecognition.com\"/><ref name=dnd13/>\n:# '''Size''': Should be no more than 215 metres long; and draught at full load must not exceed 8 metres.\n:# '''Aviation facilities''': Aviation deck to carry 10 heavy helicopters, up to 35 tons.\n:# '''Troop space''': Accommodate 1,430 personnel, including 60 officers, 470 sailors and 900 troops.\n:# '''Load carrying capability''': Combination of landing craft, including landing craft mechanised to ferry tanks; landing craft, vehicle, personnel to transport troops; and the fast-moving landing craft air cushion vessels.

She also wrote the world's longest-running play ''[[The Mousetrap]],'' performed in the [[West End theatre|West End]] since 1952, as well as six novels under the pseudonym '''Mary Westmacott'''. In 1971, she was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) for her contribution to literature.\n\nChristie was born into a wealthy upper-middle-class family in [[Torquay]], [[Devon]]. She served in a Devon hospital during the [[World War I|First World War]], acquiring a good knowledge of poisons which would later feature in many of her novels, short stories, and plays. She was initially an unsuccessful writer with six consecutive rejections, but this changed when ''[[The Mysterious Affair at Styles]]'' was published in 1920 featuring Hercule Poirot. Following her second marriage in 1930 to an archaeologist, she used her first-hand knowledge of her husband's profession in her fiction. During the [[World War II|Second World War]], she worked as a pharmacy assistant at [[University College Hospital]], London, updating her knowledge of toxins while contributing to the war effort.\n\n''[[Guinness World Records]]'' lists Christie as the best-selling novelist of all time. Her novels have sold roughly 2 billion copies, and her estate claims that her works come third in the rankings of the world's most-widely published books, behind only [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] works and the [[Bible]]. According to [[Index Translationum]], she remains the [[list of most-translated individual authors|most-translated individual author]], having been translated into at least 103 languages. ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' is Christie's best-selling novel, with 100 million sales to date, making it the world's best-selling mystery ever and one of the best-selling books of all time. Christie's stage play ''The Mousetrap'' holds the world record for longest initial run. It opened at the [[Ambassadors Theatre (London)|Ambassadors Theatre]] in the West End on 25 November 1952, and by September 2018 there had been more than 27,500 performances.\n\nIn 1955, Christie was the first recipient of the [[Mystery Writers of America]]'s [[MWA Grand Master Award|Grand Master Award]]. Later that year, ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (play)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'' received an [[Edgar Award]]  for best play. In 2013, she was voted the best crime writer and ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'' the best crime novel ever by 600 professional novelists of the [[Crime Writers' Association]]. In September 2015, coinciding with her 125th birthday, ''And Then There Were None'' was named the \"World's Favourite Christie\" in a vote sponsored by the author's estate. Most of Christie's books and short stories have been adapted for television, radio, video games, and comics, and more than thirty feature films have been based on her work.\n\n==Life and career==\n===Childhood and adolescence: 1890\u20131910===\nAgatha Mary Clarissa Miller<!-- Christie comes from her first marriage. --> was born on 15 September 1890 into a wealthy [[upper-middle-class]] family in Torquay, Devon.

Both books were sealed in a [[bank vault]] for over thirty years and were released for publication by Christie only at the end of her life, when she realised that she could not write any more novels.

She saw herself as an entertainer whose job was to produce what the public liked, and the public liked Poirot.<ref>{{cite web|work=The Christie Mystery|title=Agatha Christie&nbsp;\u2013 Her Detectives & Other Characters|date=22 February 2009|url=http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|accessdate=25 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906011416/http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|archive-date=6 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> She did marry off Poirot's companion [[Arthur Hastings|Captain Hastings]] in an attempt to trim her cast commitments.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{rp|268}}\n\nIn contrast, Christie was fond of Miss Marple. However, the Belgian detective's titles outnumber the Marple titles more than two to one. This is largely because Christie wrote numerous Poirot novels early in her career, while ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' remained the sole Marple novel until the 1940s. Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple. In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: \"Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady.

(from the [[Book of Common Prayer]]), and ''[[Come, Tell Me How You Live]]'' (from Lewis Carroll's ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'').\n\nChristie biographer Gillian Gill said that \"Christie's writing has the sparseness, the directness, the narrative pace, and the universal appeal of the fairy story, and it is perhaps as modern fairy stories for grown-up children that Christie's novels succeed.\"<ref name=\":10\" />{{Rp|208}} Reflecting a juxtaposition of innocence and horror, numerous Christie titles were drawn from well-known children's [[nursery rhyme]]s: ''And Then There Were None'' (from \"[[Ten Little Indians]]\"), ''[[One, Two, Buckle My Shoe (novel)|One, Two, Buckle My Shoe]]'' (from \"[[One, Two, Buckle My Shoe]]\"), ''Five Little Pigs'' (from \"[[This Little Piggy]]\"), ''[[Crooked House]]'' (from \"[[There Was a Crooked Man]]\"), ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' (from \"[[Sing a Song of Sixpence]]\"), ''[[Hickory Dickory Dock (novel)|Hickory Dickory Dock]]'' (from \"[[Hickory Dickory Dock]]\"), and ''[[Three Blind Mice and Other Stories|Three Blind Mice]]'' (from \"[[Three Blind Mice]]\"). Similarly, the novel ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]'' is named after a children's game that is explained in the course of the story.\n\n====Character stereotypes====\nChristie would insert stereotyped descriptions of characters into her work, particularly before the end of the Second World War (when such attitudes were more commonly expressed publicly), and particularly in regard to Italians, Jews, and non-Europeans.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|264\u2013266}} For example, she described \"men of Hebraic extraction, sallow men with hooked noses, wearing rather flamboyant jewellery\" in the short story \"The Soul of the Croupier\" from the collection ''[[The Mysterious Mr Quin]].'' In 1947, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] in the US sent an official letter of complaint to Christie's American publishers, Dodd, Mead and Company, regarding perceived [[antisemitism]] in her works.

To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie portrayed some \"foreign\" characters as victims, or potential victims, at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (''[[Hallowe'en Party]]'') and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \"How Does Your Garden Grow?\"). Jewish characters are often seen as un-English (such as Oliver Manders in ''Three Act Tragedy''), but they are rarely the culprits.<ref>{{Citation|last=Pendergast|first=Bruce|title=Everyman's Guide to the Mysteries of Agatha Christie|publisher=Trafford|year=2004|location=Victoria, BC, Canada|page=399|isbn=1-4120-2304-1}}</ref>\n\n==== Plays ====\n[[File:Agatha Christie Memorial (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Memorial to Christie in central London]]\nIn 1928, ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'' was adapted for the stage by Michael Morton under the title ''[[Alibi (play)|Alibi]]''.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|177}} While the play enjoyed a respectable run, Christie disliked the changes made to her original work and, in future, preferred to write for the theatre herself.

The first was the 1928 British film ''[[The Passing of Mr. Quin]]''. Poirot's first film appearance was in 1931 in ''[[Alibi (1931 film)|Alibi]]'', which starred [[Austin Trevor]] as Christie's sleuth.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite book|last=Palmer|first=Scott|title=The Films of Agatha Christie|publisher=B.T.

Although Christie personally liked the actress, she considered the first film \"pretty poor\" and thought no better of the rest.<ref name=\"thompson\" />{{Rp|430\u2013431}}\n\nShe felt differently about the 1974 film ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]],'' directed by [[Sidney Lumet]], which featured major stars and high production values; her attendance at the London premiere was one of her last public outings.<ref name=\"thompson\" />{{Rp|476,482}}<ref name=\":13\" />{{Rp|57}} In 2016, a new film version was released, directed by [[Kenneth Branagh]], who also starred, adorned by \"the most extravagant mustache moviegoers have ever seen\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/murder-on-the-orient-express-review-1202605173/|title=Film Review: 'Murder on the Orient Express'|last=Debruge|first=Peter|date=2 November 2017|website=variety.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nNotable television adaptations include:\n\n* ''[[Agatha Christie's Poirot]]'', with [[David Suchet]] in the title role, which ran for 70 episodes over 13 series, 1989\u20132013, and was nominated for and won various [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] awards in 1990\u20131992<ref>{{cite web|url=http://awards.bafta.org/keyword-search?keywords=poirot|title=BAFTA Awards Database|last=|first=|date=|work=BAFTA.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130529070546/http://awards.bafta.org/keyword-search?keywords=poirot|archivedate=29 May 2013|accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n* ''[[Miss Marple (TV series)|Miss Marple]],'' with [[Joan Hickson]] as \"the BBC's peerless Miss Marple\", which adapted all twelve Marple novels 1984\u20131992<ref name=\"thompson\" />{{Rp|500}}\n* {{Lang|fr|[[Les Petits Meurtres d'Agatha Christie]]}} (in French), including a four-part mini-series (2006) and a run of two series: 2009\u20132012 and 2013\u20132019, which adapted thirty-six of Christie's works of detective fiction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1349600/|title=Agatha Christie's Criminal Games: Les petits meurtres d'Agatha Christie (original title)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.imdb.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Interests and influences==\n=== Pharmacology ===\nIn the midst of the First World War, Christie took a break from nursing to train for the Apothecaries Hall Examination. While she subsequently found dispensing in the hospital pharmacy monotonous, and thus less enjoyable than nursing, her new knowledge provided her with a solid background in potentially toxic drugs. Early in the Second World War, she brought her skills up-to-date at Torquay Hospital.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{Rp|235,470}}\n\nAs Michael C. Gerald puts it, her \"activities as a hospital dispenser during both World Wars not only supported the war effort but also provided her with an appreciation of drugs as therapeutic agents and poisons \u2026 These hospital experiences were also likely responsible for the prominent role physicians, nurses, and pharmacists play in her stories\".<ref name=\":11\" />{{Rp|viii}} There were to be many medical practitioners, pharmacists and scientists, na\u00efve or suspicious, in Christie's future: ''Murder in Mesopotamia'', ''Cards on the Table'', ''The Pale Horse'', and ''Mrs. McGinty's Dead'', among numerous others.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nGillian Gill also notes that the murder method in Christie's very first detective novel, ''The Mysterious Affair at Styles'', \"comes right out of Agatha Christie's work in the hospital dispensary.\"<ref name=\":10\" />{{Rp|34}} In an interview with journalist Marcelle Bernstein, Christie stated, \"I don't like messy deaths \u2026 I'm more interested in peaceful people who die in their own beds and no one knows why.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=Agatha Christie: \u2018Queen of Crime\u2019 Is a Gentlewoman|date=8 March 1970|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=|url-status=live|page=60, quoted in Gerald (1993), p. 4.}}</ref> With her expert knowledge, Christie had no need of poisons unknown to science, which were forbidden under [[Ronald Knox]]'s \"Ten Rules for Detective Fiction\".<ref name=\":12\" />{{Rp|58}} Arsenic, aconite, strychnine, digitalis, thallium, and many other standard pharmaceuticals were utilised to dispatch victims in the ensuing decades.<ref name=\":11\" /> \n\n===Archaeology===\n{{quote box\n| align = right\n| width = 30%|\n| source = \u2013 Agatha Christie, 1977<ref name=\"Auto1993\"/>{{rp|364}}\n| quote = The lure of the past came up to grab me. To see a dagger slowly appearing, with its gold glint, through the sand was romantic. The carefulness of lifting pots and objects from the soil filled me with a longing to be an archaeologist myself.\n}}\n\nChristie had a lifelong interest in archaeology. She met her second husband, Max Mallowan, a distinguished archaeologist, on a trip to the excavation site at [[Ur]] in 1930. But her fame as an author far surpassed his fame in archaeology.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dever|first=Norma|date=2004|title=They Also Dug!

Christie accompanied Mallowan on countless archaeological trips, spending three to four months at a time in [[Syria]] and Iraq at excavation sites at Ur, [[Nineveh]], [[Tell Arpachiyah]], [[Chagar Bazar]], [[Tell Brak]], and [[Nimrud]]. She wrote novels and short stories, but also contributed work to the archaeological sites, more specifically to the archaeological restoration and labelling of ancient exhibits, including tasks such as cleaning and conserving delicate ivory pieces, reconstructing pottery, developing photos from early excavations which later led to taking photographs of the site and its findings, and taking field notes.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\">{{cite web|publisher=Trustees of the British Museum|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/middle_east/agatha_christie__archaeology/agatha_christie__archaeology.aspx|title=Agatha Christie: Archaeology|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nChristie would always pay for her own board and lodging and her travel expenses so as to not influence the funding of the archaeological excavations, and she also supported excavations as an anonymous sponsor.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\"/> During their time in the Middle East, there was also a large amount of time spent travelling to and from Mallowan's sites. Their extensive travelling was reflected in novels such as ''Murder on the Orient Express'', as well as suggesting the idea of archaeology as an adventure itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|title=Archaeology is a brand!|publisher=Comhem|accessdate=30 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505140439/http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|archivedate=5 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Second World War, she chronicled her time in Syria with fondness in ''Come Tell Me How You Live''. Anecdotes, memories, funny episodes are strung in a rough timeline, with more emphasis on eccentric characters and lovely scenery than on factual accuracy.<ref name=\"mallowan\">{{cite book|last=Christie Mallowan|first=Agatha|title=Come, Tell Me How You Live|date=1990|publisher=Fontana Books|isbn=0-00-637594-4|location=London, UK|page=|pages=|orig-year=1946}}</ref> From 8 November 2001 to 24 March 2002, [[British Museum|The British Museum]] had an exhibit named ''Agatha Christie and Archaeology: Mystery in Mesopotamia'', which presented the life of Christie and the influences of archaeology in her life and works.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\"/>\n\nMany of the settings for Christie's books were directly inspired by the numerous archaeological field seasons spent in the Middle East on the sites managed by her husband Max. The extent of her time spent at the many locations featured in her books is apparent from the extreme detail in which she describes them, such as the temple of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]], depicted in ''Death on the Nile''.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|212}} Similarly, throughout ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' she draws upon her knowledge of daily life on a dig.<ref name=\":8\" />{{Rp|269}} Among the characters in her books, Christie has given prominence to the archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts, most notably Dr. Eric Leidner in ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' and Signor Richetti in ''Death on the Nile''; several minor characters are archaeologists in ''They Came to Baghdad''.\n\nSome of Christie's best known novels with strong archaeological influences are:\n* ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' (1936)&nbsp;\u2013 set in the Middle East at an archaeological dig site and its associated expedition house. The main characters include archaeologist Dr. Eric Leidner, his wife, many specialists and assistants, and the men working on the site.\n* ''Death on the Nile'' (1937)&nbsp;\u2013 takes place on a tour boat on the Nile. Many archaeological sites are visited along the way and one of the main characters, Signor Richetti, is an archaeologist.\n* ''[[Appointment with Death]]'' (1938)&nbsp;\u2013 set in [[Jerusalem]] and the surrounding area. The eponymous death occurs at an old cave site in [[Petra]] and Christie provides some very descriptive details of sites which she may have visited.\n* ''[[They Came to Baghdad]]'' (1951)&nbsp;\u2013 involves an archaeologist as the heroine's love interest.\n\n==Portrayals==\nChristie has been portrayed in film and television. Biographical programmes have been made, such as [[BBC television]]'s ''[[Agatha Christie: A Life in Pictures]]'' (2004; in which she was portrayed by [[Olivia Williams]], [[Anna Massey]], and [[Bonnie Wright]], at different stages in her life), and in Season 3, Episode 1 of ''[[ITV (TV channel)|ITV Perspectives]]'': \"The Mystery of Agatha Christie\" (2013), hosted by David Suchet, who plays Hercule Poirot on television.<ref>{{cite news|work=Perspectives|publisher=ITV|title=The Mystery of Agatha Christie with David Suchet|year=2013|author=Suchet, David|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUmbf2fMF5M}}</ref>\n\nChristie has also been portrayed fictionally. Some of these portrayals have explored and offered accounts of Christie's disappearance in 1926, including:\n\n* the film ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'' (1979) with [[Vanessa Redgrave]], in which she sneaks away to plan revenge against her husband (Christie's heirs sued unsuccessfully to prevent the film's distribution<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/1083600%7C0/Agatha.html|title=Agatha|author=Axmaker, Sean|work=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref>);\n* the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode \"[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]\" (17 May 2008), with [[Fenella Woolgar]], in which her disappearance is the result of her suffering a temporary breakdown owing to a brief psychic link being formed between her and an alien wasp called the [[Vespiform]]; and\n* ''[[Agatha and the Truth of Murder]]'' (2018), in which she goes under cover to solve the murder of [[Florence Nightingale]]'s [[goddaughter]], Florence Nightingale Shore.\n\nA fictionalised account of Christie's disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, ''Agatha''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical Agatha|url=http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|website=VisitSeoul.com|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Government|accessdate=10 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416100240/http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|archivedate=16 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nOther portrayals, such as Hungarian film, ''Kojak Budapesten'' (1980; not to be confused with the 1986 comedy of the same name) create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skill. In the TV play, ''Murder by the Book'' (1986), Christie herself (Dame [[Peggy Ashcroft]]) murdered one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. The heroine of Liar-Soft's [[visual novel]] ''[[Shikkoku no Sharnoth: What a Beautiful Tomorrow]]'' (2008), Mary Clarissa Christie, is based on the real-life Christie. Christie features as a character in Gaylord Larsen's ''Dorothy and Agatha'' and ''The London Blitz Murders'' by Max Allan Collins.<ref>{{cite book|first=Gaylord|last=Larsen|publisher=Amazon|url=https://archive.org/details/dorothyagatha00lars|title=Dorothy and Agatha: A Mystery Novel|isbn=978-0-525-24865-1|accessdate=30 November 2012|year=1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Max Allan|last=Collins|title=The London Blitz Murders|isbn=978-0-425-19805-6|year=2004}}</ref> A young Agatha is depicted in the Spanish historical television series ''[[Gran Hotel (TV series)|Gran Hotel]]'' (2011).

She also wrote the world's longest-running play ''[[The Mousetrap]],'' performed in the [[West End theatre|West End]] since 1952, as well as six novels under the pseudonym '''Mary Westmacott'''. In 1971, she was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) for her contribution to literature.\n\nChristie was born into a wealthy upper-middle-class family in [[Torquay]], [[Devon]]. She served in a Devon hospital during the [[World War I|First World War]], acquiring a good knowledge of poisons which would later feature in many of her novels, short stories, and plays. She was initially an unsuccessful writer with six consecutive rejections, but this changed when ''[[The Mysterious Affair at Styles]]'' was published in 1920 featuring Hercule Poirot. Following her second marriage in 1930 to an archaeologist, she used her first-hand knowledge of her husband's profession in her fiction. During the [[World War II|Second World War]], she worked as a pharmacy assistant at [[University College Hospital]], London, updating her knowledge of toxins while contributing to the war effort.\n\n''[[Guinness World Records]]'' lists Christie as the best-selling novelist of all time. Her novels have sold roughly 2 billion copies, and her estate claims that her works come third in the rankings of the world's most-widely published books, behind only [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] works and the [[Bible]]. According to [[Index Translationum]], she remains the [[list of most-translated individual authors|most-translated individual author]], having been translated into at least 103 languages. ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' is Christie's best-selling novel, with 100 million sales to date, making it the world's best-selling mystery ever and one of the best-selling books of all time. Christie's stage play ''The Mousetrap'' holds the world record for longest initial run. It opened at the [[Ambassadors Theatre (London)|Ambassadors Theatre]] in the West End on 25 November 1952, and by September 2018 there had been more than 27,500 performances.\n\nIn 1955, Christie was the first recipient of the [[Mystery Writers of America]]'s [[MWA Grand Master Award|Grand Master Award]]. Later that year, ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (play)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'' received an [[Edgar Award]]  for best play. In 2013, she was voted the best crime writer and ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'' the best crime novel ever by 600 professional novelists of the [[Crime Writers' Association]]. In September 2015, coinciding with her 125th birthday, ''And Then There Were None'' was named the \"World's Favourite Christie\" in a vote sponsored by the author's estate. Most of Christie's books and short stories have been adapted for television, radio, video games, and comics, and more than thirty feature films have been based on her work.\n\n==Life and career==\n===Childhood and adolescence: 1890\u20131910===\nAgatha Mary Clarissa Miller<!-- Christie comes from her first marriage. --> was born on 15 September 1890 into a wealthy [[upper-middle-class]] family in Torquay, Devon.

She also read the work of [[Edith Nesbit]], including ''[[The Story of the Treasure Seekers]]'' (1899), ''[[The Phoenix and the Carpet]]'' (1903), and ''[[The Railway Children]]'' (1906).

Both books were sealed in a [[bank vault]] for over thirty years and were released for publication by Christie only at the end of her life, when she realised that she could not write any more novels.

She saw herself as an entertainer whose job was to produce what the public liked, and the public liked Poirot.<ref>{{cite web|work=The Christie Mystery|title=Agatha Christie&nbsp;\u2013 Her Detectives & Other Characters|date=22 February 2009|url=http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|accessdate=25 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906011416/http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|archive-date=6 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> She did marry off Poirot's companion [[Arthur Hastings|Captain Hastings]] in an attempt to trim her cast commitments.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{rp|268}}\n\nIn contrast, Christie was fond of Miss Marple. However, the Belgian detective's titles outnumber the Marple titles more than two to one. This is largely because Christie wrote numerous Poirot novels early in her career, while ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' remained the sole Marple novel until the 1940s. Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple. In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: \"Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirot \u2013 a professional sleuth \u2013 would not be at home at all in Miss Marple's world\".<ref name=\"BBCdustyClues\" />  However, ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]'' does feature both Hercule Poirot and the elderly bachelor Mr. Satterthwaite (confederate of Harley Quin).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Three Act Tragedy|last=Christie, Agatha|date=2018|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=978-0008255787|oclc=1027804732}}</ref>\n\nAnticipating the publication of ''Curtain'', Poirot became the first fictional character to be covered on the front page of ''The New York Times'' when his obituary was printed there on 6 August 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poirot.us/obituary.php|title=Poirot's Obituary|last=Hobbs|first=JD|date=6 August 1975|website=|publisher=Poirot|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=11 April 2020|place=USA}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the great success of ''Curtain'', Christie gave permission for the release of ''Sleeping Murder'' sometime in 1976 but died in January 1976 before the book could be published. This may explain some of the inconsistencies compared to the rest of the Marple series; for example, Colonel Arthur Bantry, husband of Miss Marple's friend Dolly, is still alive and well in ''Sleeping Murder'' although he is noted as having died in books published earlier. It may be that Christie simply did not have time to revise the manuscript before she died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/agatha-christie/biography|title=About Agatha Christie|work=Artists|publisher=MTV|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the Christie family gave their \"full backing\" to the release of a new Poirot story, ''[[The Monogram Murders]]'', which was written by British author [[Sophie Hannah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders|title=The Monogram Murders|publisher=Agatha Christie.com|accessdate=11 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403183934/http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders/|archivedate=3 April 2015}}</ref> Hannah later released two more Poirot mysteries, ''[[Closed Casket (novel)|Closed Casket]]'', in 2016<ref name=\":7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/news/2016/an-interview-with-sophie-hannah|title=An interview with Sophie Hannah|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> and [[Agatha Christie#Writings|''The Mystery of the Three-Quarters'']] in 2018.\n\n====Formula and plot devices====\nEarly in Christie's career, a reporter noted that \"her plots are possible, logical, and always new\".<ref name=\":6\" /> According to Sophie Hannah, \"At the start of each novel, she shows us an apparently impossible situation and we go mad wondering 'How can this be happening?'

(from the [[Book of Common Prayer]]), and ''[[Come, Tell Me How You Live]]'' (from Lewis Carroll's ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'').\n\nChristie biographer Gillian Gill said that \"Christie's writing has the sparseness, the directness, the narrative pace, and the universal appeal of the fairy story, and it is perhaps as modern fairy stories for grown-up children that Christie's novels succeed.\"<ref name=\":10\" />{{Rp|208}} Reflecting a juxtaposition of innocence and horror, numerous Christie titles were drawn from well-known children's [[nursery rhyme]]s: ''And Then There Were None'' (from \"[[Ten Little Indians]]\"), ''[[One, Two, Buckle My Shoe (novel)|One, Two, Buckle My Shoe]]'' (from \"[[One, Two, Buckle My Shoe]]\"), ''Five Little Pigs'' (from \"[[This Little Piggy]]\"), ''[[Crooked House]]'' (from \"[[There Was a Crooked Man]]\"), ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' (from \"[[Sing a Song of Sixpence]]\"), ''[[Hickory Dickory Dock (novel)|Hickory Dickory Dock]]'' (from \"[[Hickory Dickory Dock]]\"), and ''[[Three Blind Mice and Other Stories|Three Blind Mice]]'' (from \"[[Three Blind Mice]]\"). Similarly, the novel ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]'' is named after a children's game that is explained in the course of the story.\n\n====Character stereotypes====\nChristie would insert stereotyped descriptions of characters into her work, particularly before the end of the Second World War (when such attitudes were more commonly expressed publicly), and particularly in regard to Italians, Jews, and non-Europeans.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|264\u2013266}} For example, she described \"men of Hebraic extraction, sallow men with hooked noses, wearing rather flamboyant jewellery\" in the short story \"The Soul of the Croupier\" from the collection ''[[The Mysterious Mr Quin]].'' In 1947, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] in the US sent an official letter of complaint to Christie's American publishers, Dodd, Mead and Company, regarding perceived [[antisemitism]] in her works. Christie's British literary agent later wrote to her US representative, authorising American publishers to \"omit the word 'Jew' when it refers to an unpleasant character in future books\".<ref name=\"thompson\" />{{Rp|386}}\n\nIn ''[[The Hollow]]'', published as late as 1946, one of the more unsympathetic characters is \"a Whitechapel Jewess with dyed hair and a voice like a [[corncrake]]&nbsp;... a small woman with a thick nose, henna red and a disagreeable voice\". To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie portrayed some \"foreign\" characters as victims, or potential victims, at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (''[[Hallowe'en Party]]'') and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \"How Does Your Garden Grow?\"). Jewish characters are often seen as un-English (such as Oliver Manders in ''Three Act Tragedy''), but they are rarely the culprits.<ref>{{Citation|last=Pendergast|first=Bruce|title=Everyman's Guide to the Mysteries of Agatha Christie|publisher=Trafford|year=2004|location=Victoria, BC, Canada|page=399|isbn=1-4120-2304-1}}</ref>\n\n==== Plays ====\n[[File:Agatha Christie Memorial (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Memorial to Christie in central London]]\nIn 1928, ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'' was adapted for the stage by Michael Morton under the title ''[[Alibi (play)|Alibi]]''.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|177}} While the play enjoyed a respectable run, Christie disliked the changes made to her original work and, in future, preferred to write for the theatre herself.

Christie accompanied Mallowan on countless archaeological trips, spending three to four months at a time in [[Syria]] and Iraq at excavation sites at Ur, [[Nineveh]], [[Tell Arpachiyah]], [[Chagar Bazar]], [[Tell Brak]], and [[Nimrud]]. She wrote novels and short stories, but also contributed work to the archaeological sites, more specifically to the archaeological restoration and labelling of ancient exhibits, including tasks such as cleaning and conserving delicate ivory pieces, reconstructing pottery, developing photos from early excavations which later led to taking photographs of the site and its findings, and taking field notes.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\">{{cite web|publisher=Trustees of the British Museum|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/middle_east/agatha_christie__archaeology/agatha_christie__archaeology.aspx|title=Agatha Christie: Archaeology|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nChristie would always pay for her own board and lodging and her travel expenses so as to not influence the funding of the archaeological excavations, and she also supported excavations as an anonymous sponsor.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\"/> During their time in the Middle East, there was also a large amount of time spent travelling to and from Mallowan's sites.

The extent of her time spent at the many locations featured in her books is apparent from the extreme detail in which she describes them, such as the temple of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]], depicted in ''Death on the Nile''.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|212}} Similarly, throughout ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' she draws upon her knowledge of daily life on a dig.<ref name=\":8\" />{{Rp|269}} Among the characters in her books, Christie has given prominence to the archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts, most notably Dr. Eric Leidner in ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' and Signor Richetti in ''Death on the Nile''; several minor characters are archaeologists in ''They Came to Baghdad''.\n\nSome of Christie's best known novels with strong archaeological influences are:\n* ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' (1936)&nbsp;\u2013 set in the Middle East at an archaeological dig site and its associated expedition house. The main characters include archaeologist Dr. Eric Leidner, his wife, many specialists and assistants, and the men working on the site.\n* ''Death on the Nile'' (1937)&nbsp;\u2013 takes place on a tour boat on the Nile. Many archaeological sites are visited along the way and one of the main characters, Signor Richetti, is an archaeologist.\n* ''[[Appointment with Death]]'' (1938)&nbsp;\u2013 set in [[Jerusalem]] and the surrounding area. The eponymous death occurs at an old cave site in [[Petra]] and Christie provides some very descriptive details of sites which she may have visited.\n* ''[[They Came to Baghdad]]'' (1951)&nbsp;\u2013 involves an archaeologist as the heroine's love interest.\n\n==Portrayals==\nChristie has been portrayed in film and television. Biographical programmes have been made, such as [[BBC television]]'s ''[[Agatha Christie: A Life in Pictures]]'' (2004; in which she was portrayed by [[Olivia Williams]], [[Anna Massey]], and [[Bonnie Wright]], at different stages in her life), and in Season 3, Episode 1 of ''[[ITV (TV channel)|ITV Perspectives]]'': \"The Mystery of Agatha Christie\" (2013), hosted by David Suchet, who plays Hercule Poirot on television.<ref>{{cite news|work=Perspectives|publisher=ITV|title=The Mystery of Agatha Christie with David Suchet|year=2013|author=Suchet, David|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUmbf2fMF5M}}</ref>\n\nChristie has also been portrayed fictionally. Some of these portrayals have explored and offered accounts of Christie's disappearance in 1926, including:\n\n* the film ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'' (1979) with [[Vanessa Redgrave]], in which she sneaks away to plan revenge against her husband (Christie's heirs sued unsuccessfully to prevent the film's distribution<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/1083600%7C0/Agatha.html|title=Agatha|author=Axmaker, Sean|work=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref>);\n* the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode \"[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]\" (17 May 2008), with [[Fenella Woolgar]], in which her disappearance is the result of her suffering a temporary breakdown owing to a brief psychic link being formed between her and an alien wasp called the [[Vespiform]]; and\n* ''[[Agatha and the Truth of Murder]]'' (2018), in which she goes under cover to solve the murder of [[Florence Nightingale]]'s [[goddaughter]], Florence Nightingale Shore.\n\nA fictionalised account of Christie's disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, ''Agatha''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical Agatha|url=http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|website=VisitSeoul.com|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Government|accessdate=10 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416100240/http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|archivedate=16 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nOther portrayals, such as Hungarian film, ''Kojak Budapesten'' (1980; not to be confused with the 1986 comedy of the same name) create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skill.

Since the start of the war in 1793 the French fleet had suffered a series of damaging defeats and was restricted to limited operations off the French Mediterranean Coast in the face of a determined allied [[blockade]]. The French fleet, commanded by [[Pierre Martin (French Navy officer)|Pierre Martin]], had sought to test the blockade during 1795, and in March had been caught by the British, under [[William Hotham, 1st Baron Hotham|William Hotham]], in the [[Gulf of Genoa]]. At the ensuing [[Battle of Genoa (1795)|Battle of Genoa]] two French ships were captured before Martin was able to retreat to a safe anchorage.\n\nDuring the spring Martin and Hotham both received reinforcements from their respective Atlantic Fleets, the British admiral sailing off [[Minorca]] while Martin was forced to put down a mutiny among his sailors. By June Hotham had returned to the [[Ligurian Sea]], anchored in [[Saint-Florent, Haute-Corse|San Fiorenzo Bay]], when the French fleet sailed once more. In early July Martin's fleet was discovered off [[Cap Corse]] by a British flying squadron under Captain [[Horatio Nelson]] and, with some delay, Hotham set off in pursuit. Martin retreated towards the safe anchorage of the [[\u00celes d'Hy\u00e8res]], but on 13 July his straggling ships were caught by the British vanguard. In a short battle the British cut off the rearmost ship {{Ship|French ship|Alcide|1782|2}} and forced it to surrender.\n\n''Alcide'' had caught fire during the action and blew up shortly afterwards with heavy loss of life. Hotham was in a position to attack the surviving French fleet but declined, to the frustration of his officers and the criticism of later historians. The British retained their blockade, and Martin did not contest it again for the remainder of the year. This was the last fleet action in the Mediterranean before the British fleet was forced to withdraw in late 1796 \u2013 the next major engagement in the region was the [[Battle of the Nile]] in 1798.\n\n==Background==\nEarly in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] the British Mediterranean Fleet seized the entire French Mediterranean Fleet at the start of the [[Siege of Toulon]] in August 1793.<ref name=\"BI178\">Ireland, p.178</ref> Shortly before French forces recaptured the city in December, boarding parties attempted to burn the French fleet, but due to failures by Spanish forces only half of the French ships were destroyed.<ref name=\"RG105\">Gardiner, p.105</ref> In 1794, as the French repaired their ships, the British [[Invasion of Corsica (1794)|invaded and captured]] the island of [[Corsica]], subsequently using [[Saint-Florent, Haute-Corse|San Fiorenzo Bay]] as an anchorage from which they could [[blockade]] [[Toulon]].<ref name=\"BI145\">Ireland, p.145</ref>\n\nAlthough the French fleet, under the command of Contre-amiral [[Pierre Martin (French Navy officer)|Pierre Martin]], made a [[Martin's cruise of 1794|brief sally from port]] in June 1794, it was not until March 1795 that it had the strength necessary for a large scale cruise.<ref name=\"WJ254\">James, p.254</ref> Sailing from Toulon on 3 March, the fleet [[Action of 8 March 1795|encountered and captured]] the British ship [[HMS Berwick (1775)|HMS ''Berwick'']] off [[Cap Corse]],<ref name=\"WLC267\">Clowes, p.267</ref> but was then pursued by a joint British-Neapolitan fleet in the [[Gulf of Genoa]]. Retreating towards Toulon, the French were unable to evade the British fleet, under Vice-Admiral [[William Hotham, 1st Baron Hotham|William Hotham]], and on 13 March at the [[Battle of Genoa (1795)|Battle of Genoa]] the rearmost ship was cut off and badly damaged.<ref name=\"GB89\">Bennett, p.89</ref>  The following day this ship, the {{ship|French ship|\u00c7a Ira|1781|2}}, and its companion {{ship|French ship|Censeur|1782|2}}, were forced to surrender as Martin and the remainder of his ships escaped to the west.<ref name=\"CF75\">Forester, p.75</ref>\n\nHotham sailed to an anchorage off [[La Spezia]], where one ship was wrecked, before returning to San Fiorenzo for refit.<ref name=\"WLC273\">Clowes, p.273</ref> In April he took the fleet to [[Livorno|Leghorn]], where he learned of his promotion to [[Admiral of the Blue]], and he then sailed on an extended cruise to Cape Mola off [[Mah\u00f3n]] on [[Minorca]]. There he met on 14 June with a large reinforcement sent from Britain, comprising nine [[ships of the line]] under Rear-Admiral [[Robert Mann (Royal Navy officer)|Robert Mann]].<ref name=\"WJ266\"/> Hotham was concerned that in his absence the French fleet might have sailed once more, and sent a small [[frigate]] squadron under Captain [[George Henry Towry]] back into the [[Ligurian Sea]] to search for Martin. This squadron instead encountered a squadron of French frigates on the same mission and in the ensuing [[Action of 24 June 1795]] the French frigate [[French frigate Minerve (1794)|''Minerve'']] was captured.<ref name=\"WJ289\">James, p.289</ref>\n\nThe French had been unable to sail for most of the spring; Martin was initially preoccupied with gathering his ships and conducting repairs in his anchorage at the [[\u00celes d'Hy\u00e8res]] off the French coast.<ref name=\"WJ265\">James, p.265</ref> He sent his most damaged ships back to Toulon, and they were joined there on 4 April by a reinforcement of six ships of the line under Contre-amiral [[Jean Fran\u00e7ois Renaudin]], sent from [[Brest, France|Brest]] on 22 February. Martin joined this force soon afterwards, but in May his fleet was struck by a significant mutiny. The sailors of Martin's fleet, although not of Renaudin's recently arrived squadron, refused further service, and it was only the efforts of [[Repr\u00e9sentant en mission]] [[Joseph Niou]] which persuaded the rebellious seamen to return to duty, Niou making them promise \"to wash their crime in the blood of the enemies of the [French] republic.\"<ref name=\"WJ266\">James, p.266</ref>\n\n==Pursuit==\n{{see also|Order of battle at the Battle of the Hy\u00e8res Islands}}\nAt Niou's urging Martin took his fleet to sea once more on 7 June, his force comprising 17 ships of the line and six frigates.<ref name=\"WJ266\"/> Hotham remained off Minorca until 24 June, before sailing up the eastern coast of Corsica and Sardinia, arriving at San Fiorenzo on 29 June.<ref name=\"WJ266\"/> En route messages sent by Towry on the [[cutter (ship)|cutter]] [[Hired armed cutter Fox (1793)|''Fox'']] reached Hotham, warning that prisoners taken from ''Minerve'' reported that Martin was at sea.<ref name=\"LG2\">{{London Gazette|issue=13801|pages=804\u2013805|date=1 August 1795}}</ref> Hotham decided that the French were on a sailing exercise rather than an offensive operation and decided not to intervene, ordering his ships to refit and resupply. He did not post guard frigates or send scouts in search of Martin's force.<ref name=\"NM163\">Mostert, p.163</ref>  On 4 July Hotham detached a small squadron led by Captain [[Horatio Nelson]] in [[HMS Agamemnon (1781)|HMS ''Agamemnon'']], with the frigate [[HMS Meleager (1785)|HMS ''Meleager'']] and the smaller ships [[HMS Ariadne (1776)|HMS ''Ariadne'']], [[HMS Moselle (1793)|HMS ''Moselle'']] and {{HMS|Mutine|1797|6}}.<ref name=\"WJ266\"/> Nelson's orders were to liaise with Austrian general [[Joseph Nikolaus De Vins]] for operations against French [[Army of Italy (France)|Army of Italy]] positions in Northwestern Italy,<ref name=\"NM163\"/> as well as patrol off [[Genoa]] and then to pass along the French coast to the west.<ref name=\"WJ266\"/>\n\nAt 16:00 on 7 July off Cape del Melle, Nelson's force discovered the French fleet. Martin had visited Genoa, where [[Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinand III]] the [[Grand Duke of Tuscany]] had recently signed peace terms with France, and then sent [[French ship Mercure (1783)|''Mercure'']] and [[French ship Guerrier (1754)|''Guerrier'']] back to Toulon.<ref name=\"Tr434\">Troude, p.434</ref> On sighting Nelson, Martin recognised the small size of the British force and led his fleet in pursuit, Nelson retreating towards San Fiorenzo with ''Moselle'' trailing behind the rest of the squadron.<ref name=\"WLC274\">Clowes, p.274</ref> At 07:20 the following morning, ''Agamemnon'' began firing signal guns in the hope of alerting Hotham to the presence of the French, and at 09:30 the leading French ships saw the British fleet at anchor.<ref name=\"WJ267\">James, p.267</ref> Although the British were unprepared and vulnerable to attack, Martin immediately ordered his fleet to turn away to the west, towards Toulon.<ref name=\"NM163\"/> The winds were blowing from the west and both Martin and Hotham were hampered.<ref name=\"EB118\"/> The British fleet was in a state of unreadiness, and it was not until 21:00 that Hotham was able to lead 23 ships of the line, including ''Agamemnon'' and two allied [[Kingdom of Naples|Neapolitan]] ships, out of the bay in pursuit of the French, who had used the delay to escape to the north.<ref name=\"GB45\">Bennett, p.45</ref>\n\nFor four days Hotham searched for the French against the wind coming from the southwest. Late on 12 July, approximately {{convert|24|nmi|km}} east of [[\u00cele du Levant]], the small frigate [[HMS Cyclops (1779)|HMS ''Cyclops'']] learned from passing vessels that the French had recently passed by to the south.<ref name=\"LG1\">{{London Gazette|issue=13802|pages=816|date=4 August 1795}}</ref> Hotham gave the signal to \"prepare for battle\" and led his fleet to the southwest in the expectation of meeting the French. During the night a [[gale]] from the northwest caused damage to the sails of a number of ships, but at dawn on 13 July the French were seen just {{convert|5|nmi|km}} to [[leeward]], scattered widely.<ref name=\"WLC274\"/> \n\nAt 03:45 Hotham gave orders to form his ships up and sailed to [[larboard]] in an effort to cut the French off from land. Martin used the time to organise his fleet and by 08:00 the French were sailing in [[line of battle]] back towards the \u00celes d'Hy\u00e8res.<ref name=\"WLC275\">Clowes, p.275</ref>\n\n==Catching the rearguard==\nRecognising that the French might now escape, Hotham gave orders for a general chase, allowing his fastest ships the opportunity to come up with the French to the best of their ability.<ref name=\"LG1\"/> By noon the French were {{convert|0.75|nmi|km}} ahead of the British to the northeast, with Hotham's fleet scattered across {{convert|8|nmi|km}} of sea.<ref name=\"WJ268\">James, p.268</ref> At 12:30 a wind shift from southwest to the north brought the French about so that the [[broadside]]s of the last three French ships could bear on the approaching British. The leading British ships, [[HMS Culloden (1783)|HMS ''Culloden'']], [[HMS Cumberland (1774)|HMS ''Cumberland'']] and [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']] all came under fire.<ref name=\"WLC275\"/>\n\nThe shift in wind favoured the British, allowing them to gain rapidly on the French.<ref name=\"NM163\"/> The British ships were soon able to return fire, targeting the slowest French ship, {{Ship|French ship|Alcide|1782|2}}. Although ''Culloden'' was forced back after losing a topmast, ''Alcide'' was soon badly damaged and isolated. At 14:00, in danger of being overwhelmed, Captain Leblond Saint-Hylaire [[struck his colours]] and surrendered his ship to ''Cumberland''.<ref name=\"WJ268\"/> Captain [[Bartholomew Rowley]] did not acknowledge the surrender, passing on to attack the next French ship in line, and the French frigates [[French frigate Alceste (1780)|''Alceste'']] and [[French frigate Justice (1794)|''Justice'']] attempted to pass a tow rope to ''Alcide'' and drag it away from the British fleet.<ref name=\"WLC276\">Clowes, p.276</ref> The [[ship's boat]] carrying the rope was sunk by fire from ''Victory'', and the frigates sheered off under heavy fire.<ref name=\"WJ269\">James, p.269</ref> An attempt by [[French ship Aquilon (1789)|''Aquilon'']] to reach ''Alcide'' was abandoned when it became clear that the surrendered ship was on fire.<ref name=\"Tr435\"/>\n\nBy 14:42 more British ships, including ''Agamemnon'', [[HMS Blenheim (1761)|HMS ''Blenheim'']], [[HMS Captain (1787)|HMS ''Captain'']] and [[HMS Defence (1763)|HMS ''Defence'']] were now within long range and trading fire with the rearmost French ships [[French ship G\u00e9n\u00e9reux (1785)|''G\u00e9n\u00e9reux'']], [[HMS Berwick (1775)|''Berwick'']], [[French ship Tyrannicide (1793)|''Tyrannicide'']] and ''Aquilon'',<ref name=\"Tr435\">Troude, p.435</ref> with which ''Cumberland'' was now heavily engaged.<ref name=\"WJ269\"/> Hotham then suddenly issued [[flag signals]] instructing his captains to discontinue the action and return to the flagship [[HMS Britannia (1762)|HMS ''Britannia'']]. Hotham was at this point {{convert|8|nmi|km}} from the action and unable to see that his ships were poised to attack the main French fleet, concerned that his dispersed ships were vulnerable to the fire from the French fleet and shore batteries.<ref name=\"NM163\"/> Admiral Mann on ''Victory'' had to repeat the order twice before Rowley acknowledged and retired from combat.<ref name=\"WJ269\"/> At this point the battling ships were approximately {{convert|12|nmi|km}} southeast of Cape Roux, towards which the French, having gained the [[weather gage]] by a shift in wind to the east were now sailing.<ref name=\"WLC276\"/>\n\nFire had taken hold on the surrendered ''Alcide'' in the foretop, probably due to the detonation of a [[grenade]].<ref name=\"EB118\"/> By 14:15 it had spread out of control, sweeping the ship from end to end.<ref name=\"WJ271\">James, p.271</ref> The crew threw themselves into the sea to escape the flames and approximately 300 were collected by boats from the passing British ships, but at least 300 are believed to have been killed when the ship's magazines detonated at 15:45.<ref name=\"WLC277\">Clowes, p.277</ref> Captain Leblond Saint-Hylaire was among the dead.<ref name=\"Tr435\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nAside from the heavy loss of life on ''Alcide'', French losses are not reported, although few other French ships were heavily engaged. British losses were mild, with 11 killed and 28 wounded across five ships. ''Cumberland'', the most heavily engaged of the British fleet, suffered no casualties at all. ''Victory'', ''Cumberland'' and ''Culloden'' had all been damaged in the sails and rigging, but none seriously.<ref name=\"WJ271\"/>\n\nMartin led his surviving ships into the bay off [[Fr\u00e9jus]], anchoring there by 19:00.<ref name=\"LG1\"/> The French fleet was later able to return to Toulon along the coast without interference from Hotham, and remained in harbour until 14 September when orders from the [[National Convention]] arrived instructing Martin to send six ships of the line and three frigates back to the Atlantic fleet at Brest to replace losses incurred at the [[Battle of Groix]] in June.<ref name=\"WJ273\"/> This force was commanded by Contre-amiral [[Joseph de Richery]] and on 7 October it [[Action of 7 October 1795|encountered and attacked]] an escorted British convoy off [[Cape St. Vincent]], capturing a ship of the line and 30 merchant ships.<ref name=\"WJ273\">James, p.273</ref>\n\nHotham returned to San Fiorenzo and then to Leghorn. In August he briefly cruised off Toulon before retiring once more, although Nelson was detached with a squadron to operate against French Army movements on the Mediterranean Coast, attacking coastal positions near [[Alassio]].<ref name=\"GB46\">Bennett, p.46</ref> In September Hotham sent a detachment in pursuit of Richery, but this force was far too late to prevent the destruction of the convoy in October.<ref name=\"WJ273\"/> Later in the year another French squadron was [[Ganteaume's expedition of 1795|sent on a mission]] to [[Smyrna]], escaped Toulon under Captain [[Honor\u00e9 Ganteaume]], and caused severe damage to British merchant shipping in the Eastern Mediterranean.<ref name=\"WJ275\">James, p.275</ref> Hotham retired from his post at Leghorn on 1 November, passing command of the Mediterranean Fleet to Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Sir John Jervis]].<ref name=\"NM173\">Mostert, p.173</ref> Martin did not lead a fleet to sea again during the Mediterranean campaign, but in late 1796 French victories on land in Italy eliminated British allies from the war, making the maintenance of a fleet off Toulon impractical.

Since the start of the war in 1793 the French fleet had suffered a series of damaging defeats and was restricted to limited operations off the French Mediterranean Coast in the face of a determined allied [[blockade]]. The French fleet, commanded by [[Pierre Martin (French Navy officer)|Pierre Martin]], had sought to test the blockade during 1795, and in March had been caught by the British, under [[William Hotham, 1st Baron Hotham|William Hotham]], in the [[Gulf of Genoa]]. At the ensuing [[Battle of Genoa (1795)|Battle of Genoa]] two French ships were captured before Martin was able to retreat to a safe anchorage.\n\nDuring the spring Martin and Hotham both received reinforcements from their respective Atlantic Fleets, the British admiral sailing off [[Minorca]] while Martin was forced to put down a mutiny among his sailors. By June Hotham had returned to the [[Ligurian Sea]], anchored in [[Saint-Florent, Haute-Corse|San Fiorenzo Bay]], when the French fleet sailed once more. In early July Martin's fleet was discovered off [[Cap Corse]] by a British flying squadron under Captain [[Horatio Nelson]] and, with some delay, Hotham set off in pursuit. Martin retreated towards the safe anchorage of the [[\u00celes d'Hy\u00e8res]], but on 13 July his straggling ships were caught by the British vanguard. In a short battle the British cut off the rearmost ship {{Ship|French ship|Alcide|1782|2}} and forced it to surrender.\n\n''Alcide'' had caught fire during the action and blew up shortly afterwards with heavy loss of life. Hotham was in a position to attack the surviving French fleet but declined, to the frustration of his officers and the criticism of later historians. The British retained their blockade, and Martin did not contest it again for the remainder of the year. This was the last fleet action in the Mediterranean before the British fleet was forced to withdraw in late 1796 \u2013 the next major engagement in the region was the [[Battle of the Nile]] in 1798.\n\n==Background==\nEarly in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] the British Mediterranean Fleet seized the entire French Mediterranean Fleet at the start of the [[Siege of Toulon]] in August 1793.<ref name=\"BI178\">Ireland, p.178</ref> Shortly before French forces recaptured the city in December, boarding parties attempted to burn the French fleet, but due to failures by Spanish forces only half of the French ships were destroyed.<ref name=\"RG105\">Gardiner, p.105</ref> In 1794, as the French repaired their ships, the British [[Invasion of Corsica (1794)|invaded and captured]] the island of [[Corsica]], subsequently using [[Saint-Florent, Haute-Corse|San Fiorenzo Bay]] as an anchorage from which they could [[blockade]] [[Toulon]].<ref name=\"BI145\">Ireland, p.145</ref>\n\nAlthough the French fleet, under the command of Contre-amiral [[Pierre Martin (French Navy officer)|Pierre Martin]], made a [[Martin's cruise of 1794|brief sally from port]] in June 1794, it was not until March 1795 that it had the strength necessary for a large scale cruise.<ref name=\"WJ254\">James, p.254</ref> Sailing from Toulon on 3 March, the fleet [[Action of 8 March 1795|encountered and captured]] the British ship [[HMS Berwick (1775)|HMS ''Berwick'']] off [[Cap Corse]],<ref name=\"WLC267\">Clowes, p.267</ref> but was then pursued by a joint British-Neapolitan fleet in the [[Gulf of Genoa]]. Retreating towards Toulon, the French were unable to evade the British fleet, under Vice-Admiral [[William Hotham, 1st Baron Hotham|William Hotham]], and on 13 March at the [[Battle of Genoa (1795)|Battle of Genoa]] the rearmost ship was cut off and badly damaged.<ref name=\"GB89\">Bennett, p.89</ref>  The following day this ship, the {{ship|French ship|\u00c7a Ira|1781|2}}, and its companion {{ship|French ship|Censeur|1782|2}}, were forced to surrender as Martin and the remainder of his ships escaped to the west.<ref name=\"CF75\">Forester, p.75</ref>\n\nHotham sailed to an anchorage off [[La Spezia]], where one ship was wrecked, before returning to San Fiorenzo for refit.<ref name=\"WLC273\">Clowes, p.273</ref> In April he took the fleet to [[Livorno|Leghorn]], where he learned of his promotion to [[Admiral of the Blue]], and he then sailed on an extended cruise to Cape Mola off [[Mah\u00f3n]] on [[Minorca]]. There he met on 14 June with a large reinforcement sent from Britain, comprising nine [[ships of the line]] under Rear-Admiral [[Robert Mann (Royal Navy officer)|Robert Mann]].<ref name=\"WJ266\"/> Hotham was concerned that in his absence the French fleet might have sailed once more, and sent a small [[frigate]] squadron under Captain [[George Henry Towry]] back into the [[Ligurian Sea]] to search for Martin. This squadron instead encountered a squadron of French frigates on the same mission and in the ensuing [[Action of 24 June 1795]] the French frigate [[French frigate Minerve (1794)|''Minerve'']] was captured.<ref name=\"WJ289\">James, p.289</ref>\n\nThe French had been unable to sail for most of the spring; Martin was initially preoccupied with gathering his ships and conducting repairs in his anchorage at the [[\u00celes d'Hy\u00e8res]] off the French coast.<ref name=\"WJ265\">James, p.265</ref> He sent his most damaged ships back to Toulon, and they were joined there on 4 April by a reinforcement of six ships of the line under Contre-amiral [[Jean Fran\u00e7ois Renaudin]], sent from [[Brest, France|Brest]] on 22 February. Martin joined this force soon afterwards, but in May his fleet was struck by a significant mutiny. The sailors of Martin's fleet, although not of Renaudin's recently arrived squadron, refused further service, and it was only the efforts of [[Repr\u00e9sentant en mission]] [[Joseph Niou]] which persuaded the rebellious seamen to return to duty, Niou making them promise \"to wash their crime in the blood of the enemies of the [French] republic.\"<ref name=\"WJ266\">James, p.266</ref>\n\n==Pursuit==\n{{see also|Order of battle at the Battle of the Hy\u00e8res Islands}}\nAt Niou's urging Martin took his fleet to sea once more on 7 June, his force comprising 17 ships of the line and six frigates.<ref name=\"WJ266\"/> Hotham remained off Minorca until 24 June, before sailing up the eastern coast of Corsica and Sardinia, arriving at San Fiorenzo on 29 June.<ref name=\"WJ266\"/> En route messages sent by Towry on the [[cutter (ship)|cutter]] [[Hired armed cutter Fox (1793)|''Fox'']] reached Hotham, warning that prisoners taken from ''Minerve'' reported that Martin was at sea.<ref name=\"LG2\">{{London Gazette|issue=13801|pages=804\u2013805|date=1 August 1795}}</ref> Hotham decided that the French were on a sailing exercise rather than an offensive operation and decided not to intervene, ordering his ships to refit and resupply. He did not post guard frigates or send scouts in search of Martin's force.<ref name=\"NM163\">Mostert, p.163</ref>  On 4 July Hotham detached a small squadron led by Captain [[Horatio Nelson]] in [[HMS Agamemnon (1781)|HMS ''Agamemnon'']], with the frigate [[HMS Meleager (1785)|HMS ''Meleager'']] and the smaller ships [[HMS Ariadne (1776)|HMS ''Ariadne'']], [[HMS Moselle (1793)|HMS ''Moselle'']] and {{HMS|Mutine|1797|6}}.<ref name=\"WJ266\"/> Nelson's orders were to liaise with Austrian general [[Joseph Nikolaus De Vins]] for operations against French [[Army of Italy (France)|Army of Italy]] positions in Northwestern Italy,<ref name=\"NM163\"/> as well as patrol off [[Genoa]] and then to pass along the French coast to the west.<ref name=\"WJ266\"/>\n\nAt 16:00 on 7 July off Cape del Melle, Nelson's force discovered the French fleet. Martin had visited Genoa, where [[Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinand III]] the [[Grand Duke of Tuscany]] had recently signed peace terms with France, and then sent [[French ship Mercure (1783)|''Mercure'']] and [[French ship Guerrier (1754)|''Guerrier'']] back to Toulon.<ref name=\"Tr434\">Troude, p.434</ref> On sighting Nelson, Martin recognised the small size of the British force and led his fleet in pursuit, Nelson retreating towards San Fiorenzo with ''Moselle'' trailing behind the rest of the squadron.<ref name=\"WLC274\">Clowes, p.274</ref> At 07:20 the following morning, ''Agamemnon'' began firing signal guns in the hope of alerting Hotham to the presence of the French, and at 09:30 the leading French ships saw the British fleet at anchor.<ref name=\"WJ267\">James, p.267</ref> Although the British were unprepared and vulnerable to attack, Martin immediately ordered his fleet to turn away to the west, towards Toulon.<ref name=\"NM163\"/> The winds were blowing from the west and both Martin and Hotham were hampered.<ref name=\"EB118\"/> The British fleet was in a state of unreadiness, and it was not until 21:00 that Hotham was able to lead 23 ships of the line, including ''Agamemnon'' and two allied [[Kingdom of Naples|Neapolitan]] ships, out of the bay in pursuit of the French, who had used the delay to escape to the north.<ref name=\"GB45\">Bennett, p.45</ref>\n\nFor four days Hotham searched for the French against the wind coming from the southwest. Late on 12 July, approximately {{convert|24|nmi|km}} east of [[\u00cele du Levant]], the small frigate [[HMS Cyclops (1779)|HMS ''Cyclops'']] learned from passing vessels that the French had recently passed by to the south.<ref name=\"LG1\">{{London Gazette|issue=13802|pages=816|date=4 August 1795}}</ref> Hotham gave the signal to \"prepare for battle\" and led his fleet to the southwest in the expectation of meeting the French. During the night a [[gale]] from the northwest caused damage to the sails of a number of ships, but at dawn on 13 July the French were seen just {{convert|5|nmi|km}} to [[leeward]], scattered widely.<ref name=\"WLC274\"/> \n\nAt 03:45 Hotham gave orders to form his ships up and sailed to [[larboard]] in an effort to cut the French off from land. Martin used the time to organise his fleet and by 08:00 the French were sailing in [[line of battle]] back towards the \u00celes d'Hy\u00e8res.<ref name=\"WLC275\">Clowes, p.275</ref>\n\n==Catching the rearguard==\nRecognising that the French might now escape, Hotham gave orders for a general chase, allowing his fastest ships the opportunity to come up with the French to the best of their ability.<ref name=\"LG1\"/> By noon the French were {{convert|0.75|nmi|km}} ahead of the British to the northeast, with Hotham's fleet scattered across {{convert|8|nmi|km}} of sea.<ref name=\"WJ268\">James, p.268</ref> At 12:30 a wind shift from southwest to the north brought the French about so that the [[broadside]]s of the last three French ships could bear on the approaching British. The leading British ships, [[HMS Culloden (1783)|HMS ''Culloden'']], [[HMS Cumberland (1774)|HMS ''Cumberland'']] and [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']] all came under fire.<ref name=\"WLC275\"/>\n\nThe shift in wind favoured the British, allowing them to gain rapidly on the French.<ref name=\"NM163\"/> The British ships were soon able to return fire, targeting the slowest French ship, {{Ship|French ship|Alcide|1782|2}}. Although ''Culloden'' was forced back after losing a topmast, ''Alcide'' was soon badly damaged and isolated. At 14:00, in danger of being overwhelmed, Captain Leblond Saint-Hylaire [[struck his colours]] and surrendered his ship to ''Cumberland''.<ref name=\"WJ268\"/> Captain [[Bartholomew Rowley]] did not acknowledge the surrender, passing on to attack the next French ship in line, and the French frigates [[French frigate Alceste (1780)|''Alceste'']] and [[French frigate Justice (1794)|''Justice'']] attempted to pass a tow rope to ''Alcide'' and drag it away from the British fleet.<ref name=\"WLC276\">Clowes, p.276</ref> The [[ship's boat]] carrying the rope was sunk by fire from ''Victory'', and the frigates sheered off under heavy fire.<ref name=\"WJ269\">James, p.269</ref> An attempt by [[French ship Aquilon (1789)|''Aquilon'']] to reach ''Alcide'' was abandoned when it became clear that the surrendered ship was on fire.<ref name=\"Tr435\"/>\n\nBy 14:42 more British ships, including ''Agamemnon'', [[HMS Blenheim (1761)|HMS ''Blenheim'']], [[HMS Captain (1787)|HMS ''Captain'']] and [[HMS Defence (1763)|HMS ''Defence'']] were now within long range and trading fire with the rearmost French ships [[French ship G\u00e9n\u00e9reux (1785)|''G\u00e9n\u00e9reux'']], [[HMS Berwick (1775)|''Berwick'']], [[French ship Tyrannicide (1793)|''Tyrannicide'']] and ''Aquilon'',<ref name=\"Tr435\">Troude, p.435</ref> with which ''Cumberland'' was now heavily engaged.<ref name=\"WJ269\"/> Hotham then suddenly issued [[flag signals]] instructing his captains to discontinue the action and return to the flagship [[HMS Britannia (1762)|HMS ''Britannia'']]. Hotham was at this point {{convert|8|nmi|km}} from the action and unable to see that his ships were poised to attack the main French fleet, concerned that his dispersed ships were vulnerable to the fire from the French fleet and shore batteries.<ref name=\"NM163\"/> Admiral Mann on ''Victory'' had to repeat the order twice before Rowley acknowledged and retired from combat.<ref name=\"WJ269\"/> At this point the battling ships were approximately {{convert|12|nmi|km}} southeast of Cape Roux, towards which the French, having gained the [[weather gage]] by a shift in wind to the east were now sailing.<ref name=\"WLC276\"/>\n\nFire had taken hold on the surrendered ''Alcide'' in the foretop, probably due to the detonation of a [[grenade]].<ref name=\"EB118\"/> By 14:15 it had spread out of control, sweeping the ship from end to end.<ref name=\"WJ271\">James, p.271</ref> The crew threw themselves into the sea to escape the flames and approximately 300 were collected by boats from the passing British ships, but at least 300 are believed to have been killed when the ship's magazines detonated at 15:45.<ref name=\"WLC277\">Clowes, p.277</ref> Captain Leblond Saint-Hylaire was among the dead.<ref name=\"Tr435\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nAside from the heavy loss of life on ''Alcide'', French losses are not reported, although few other French ships were heavily engaged. British losses were mild, with 11 killed and 28 wounded across five ships. ''Cumberland'', the most heavily engaged of the British fleet, suffered no casualties at all. ''Victory'', ''Cumberland'' and ''Culloden'' had all been damaged in the sails and rigging, but none seriously.<ref name=\"WJ271\"/>\n\nMartin led his surviving ships into the bay off [[Fr\u00e9jus]], anchoring there by 19:00.<ref name=\"LG1\"/> The French fleet was later able to return to Toulon along the coast without interference from Hotham, and remained in harbour until 14 September when orders from the [[National Convention]] arrived instructing Martin to send six ships of the line and three frigates back to the Atlantic fleet at Brest to replace losses incurred at the [[Battle of Groix]] in June.<ref name=\"WJ273\"/> This force was commanded by Contre-amiral [[Joseph de Richery]] and on 7 October it [[Action of 7 October 1795|encountered and attacked]] an escorted British convoy off [[Cape St. Vincent]], capturing a ship of the line and 30 merchant ships.<ref name=\"WJ273\">James, p.273</ref>\n\nHotham returned to San Fiorenzo and then to Leghorn. In August he briefly cruised off Toulon before retiring once more, although Nelson was detached with a squadron to operate against French Army movements on the Mediterranean Coast, attacking coastal positions near [[Alassio]].<ref name=\"GB46\">Bennett, p.46</ref> In September Hotham sent a detachment in pursuit of Richery, but this force was far too late to prevent the destruction of the convoy in October.<ref name=\"WJ273\"/> Later in the year another French squadron was [[Ganteaume's expedition of 1795|sent on a mission]] to [[Smyrna]], escaped Toulon under Captain [[Honor\u00e9 Ganteaume]], and caused severe damage to British merchant shipping in the Eastern Mediterranean.<ref name=\"WJ275\">James, p.275</ref> Hotham retired from his post at Leghorn on 1 November, passing command of the Mediterranean Fleet to Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Sir John Jervis]].<ref name=\"NM173\">Mostert, p.173</ref> Martin did not lead a fleet to sea again during the Mediterranean campaign, but in late 1796 French victories on land in Italy eliminated British allies from the war, making the maintenance of a fleet off Toulon impractical. The Mediterranean Fleet was forced to withdraw to the [[Tagus]], ceding the Mediterranean theatre to France.<ref name=\"NM188\">Mostert, p.188</ref>\n\nHotham was heavily criticised at the time for his conduct during the battle, a series of delays and hesitations allowing the French to escape when they might easily have been destroyed.<ref name=\"WLC276\"/> His second-in-command [[Samuel Goodall]] was said to have kicked his hat across the deck in fury at Hotham's order to withdraw.<ref name=\"NR434\">Rodger, p.434</ref>  Nelson wrote of the decision to withdraw that \"In the forenoon we had every prospect of taking every Ship in the Fleet; and at noon it was almost certain we should have the six near ships.\" He was critical of Martin too, writing \"The French Admiral, I am sure, is not a wise man, nor an Officer: he was undetermined whether to fight or run away.\"<ref name=\"EB118\">Bradford, p.118</ref> Later historians have been scathing of Hotham's failure to bring Martin to action earlier and more vigorously; [[C.

Troops from [[Rwanda]] and [[Uganda]] continued to support rebel groups against the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and rifts also grew between Rwanda and Uganda as they accused each other of supporting rival rebel groups as well. [[Laurent Kabila]], president of the DRC, was assassinated in January 2001 and his son, [[Joseph Kabila]], took power. Throughout 2002 steps were made towards peace and Rwanda and Uganda both removed their troops from the country. On December 17, 2002, a massive treaty officially ended the war. However, the DRC only holds power in less than half of the country, with most of the eastern and northern portions still controlled by rebel groups, where there is still significant infighting. In addition, Rwanda still supports anti-DRC rebels and anti-Rwandan rebels continue to operate from the DRC.

The [[September 11 attacks|9/11 terrorist attacks]] triggered invasions of [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] and partially and controversially [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]]. The [[War on Terror]] has seen controversies over [[civil liberties]], accusations of [[torture]], continued terrorist attacks and ongoing instability, violence, and military occupation. Violence continues in the [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict]]. Considerable concern remains about [[nuclear proliferation]], especially in [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]], and the availability of [[weapons of mass destruction]] to rogue groups.\n**'''[[War on drugs]].''' Increasingly, the legal, social and military battle led by governments against drug cartels around the world show little results in ending drug trading and consumption, and a constant increase in the lives taken from this struggle. Notably, after 2006 in the [[Mexican Drug War]], more than 100,000 human lives have been lost to this conflict. Some jurisdictions have enacted some degree of legalization or decriminalization of some kinds of drugs, notably including several U.S. states legalizing [[marijuana]] either for recreational or medical use.\n* '''[[Intellectual property]].''' The increasing popularity of digital formats for entertainment media such as movies and music, and the ease of copying and distributing it via the [[Internet]] and [[peer-to-peer]] networks, has raised concerns in the media industry about [[copyright infringement]]. Much debate is proceeding about the proper bounds between protection of [[copyright]], [[trademark]] and [[patent]] rights versus [[fair use]] and the [[public domain]], where some argue that such laws have shifted greatly towards intellectual property owners and away from the interests of the general public in recent years, while others say that such legal change is needed to deal with a perceived threat of new technologies against the rights of authors and artists (or, as others put it, against the outmoded business models of the current entertainment industry). [[Domain name]] \"cybersquatting\" and access to patented drugs and generics to combat epidemics in third-world countries are other IP concerns.\n* '''[[Technology]]''' developments continue to change society. [[Cybernetics|Communications and control]] technology continues to augment the intelligence of individual humans, collections of humans, and machines. Some, notably [[Ray Kurzweil]], have predicted that by the middle of the century there will be a [[technological singularity]] if [[artificial intelligence]] that outsmarts humans is created. In addition, some [[economists]] have expressed concerns over [[technological unemployment]].[[File:World laws pertaining to homosexual relationships and expression.svg|thumb|{{legend|#025|Marriage open to same-sex couples}}{{legend|#800000|[[Death penalty for homosexuality]]}}]]  \n* '''[[Civil and political rights|Civil rights]]''', including [[women's rights]], [[LGBT rights by country or territory|LGBT rights]], [[racial equality]] and the rights of [[disability rights|disabled]] and [[neurodiversity|neurodiverse]] people are still a work in progress. [[Women]] are not able to realize or are outright denied their rights in many countries, including [[India]], [[China]]<ref>https://www.du.edu/korbel/hrhw/researchdigest/china/WomenChina.pdf</ref> and [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[sexual violence]] against women is still an enormous problem everywhere in the world. [[Sex-selective abortion]] has reduced the number of women born worldwide since 1990, mostly because of [[son preference]] in [[China]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Vietnam]], [[South Korea]] and some other smaller countries. In many countries attitudes towards [[homosexuality]] have become more tolerant. [[Same-sex marriage]] was legalized in several jurisdictions during the first two decades of the century, but outlawed by constitutional amendment in other places. Meanwhile, some countries such as [[Uganda]] and [[Russia]] moved to toughen their laws against any sort of [[homosexuality|homosexual]] behavior or expression. Political battles over pro- or anti-gay legislation provoked much activism in the streets and on the Internet. [[Hate group]]s remain a serious problem, and ethnic minorities have a lower status in many countries, including the United States.

Regarding this, academics suggested that since former years such as 1805 and 1905 were commonly pronounced as \"eighteen oh five\" or \"nineteen oh five\", the year 2005 should naturally have been pronounced as \"twenty oh five\".<ref name=\"preferMC\">{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article376957.ece|title=Login|publisher=}}</ref> A less common variation would have been \"twenty nought five\".

A 1999 ceasefire quickly broke down and a UN peacekeeping mission, [[MONUC]], was unable to control the fighting. Troops from [[Rwanda]] and [[Uganda]] continued to support rebel groups against the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and rifts also grew between Rwanda and Uganda as they accused each other of supporting rival rebel groups as well. [[Laurent Kabila]], president of the DRC, was assassinated in January 2001 and his son, [[Joseph Kabila]], took power. Throughout 2002 steps were made towards peace and Rwanda and Uganda both removed their troops from the country. On December 17, 2002, a massive treaty officially ended the war. However, the DRC only holds power in less than half of the country, with most of the eastern and northern portions still controlled by rebel groups, where there is still significant infighting. In addition, Rwanda still supports anti-DRC rebels and anti-Rwandan rebels continue to operate from the DRC. The war killed an estimated 3.9 million people, displaced nearly 5.5 million, and led to a widespread and ongoing famine that continues to result in deaths. Severe human rights violations continue to be reported.\n*2001 \u2013 The [[Nepalese royal massacre]] occurred on 1 June 2001, at a house on the grounds of the [[Narayanhity Palace|Narayanhity Royal Palace]], the residence of the Nepalese monarchy.

In 2005, the ICC decided that Darfur war criminals would be tried, and on July 14, 2008, Sudanese president [[Omar al-Bashir]] was charged with 5 accounts of [[crimes against humanity]] and 2 accounts of war crimes, although the ICC has no power to enforce these charges.\n*2003\u20132010 \u2013 The [[Multinational force in Iraq|U.S.-led coalition]] [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invaded]] [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]] on March 20, 2003, and overthrew the government of [[Saddam Hussein]] (who was executed by the Iraqi government on December 30, 2006). Coalition troops remain in the country to install a democratic government and fight an escalating insurgency. In addition to an insurgency against the American presence, Iraq also suffered from a [[Iraqi insurgency (2003\u201311)|civil war]] for several years. The war was soon seen as the central front of the War on Terror by many governments, despite growing international dissatisfaction with the war.

Advances in [[telecommunications]] and [[transportation]], the expansion of [[capitalism]] and [[democratization|democracy]]{{disputed inline|discuss=Talk:21st century#democratization|date=April 2019}} since the late 1980s, and [[free trade]] agreements have resulted in unprecedented global economic and cultural integration.

CNN. August 12, 2009.</ref>]]\n* '''[[Population]].''' The world's population demographics will shift considerably in this century, with the population of [[Europe]] and [[East Asia]] to decline considerably and the population of [[Africa]] and to a lesser extent [[South Asia]] to grow considerably. The [[United Nations]] estimates that [[world population]] will reach 9.8 billion by the year 2050.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/population/world-population-prospects-2017.html|title=World population projected to reach 9.8 billion in 2050, and 11.2 billion in 2100|date=June 21, 2017|website=UN DESA - United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs}}</ref> Most of this growth will take place in the world's poorer countries, which may slow down the global reduction of poverty and combined with the effects of [[global warming]] may lead to large migrations. \n** '''[[Human overpopulation|Overpopulation]].''' The [[United Nations]] [http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/02/24/un.population/ estimates] that [[world population]] will reach 9.2 billion by mid-century. Such growth raises questions of ecological [[sustainability]] and creates many [[economic]] and [[political]] disruptions. In response, many countries have adopted policies which either force or encourage their citizens to have fewer children, and others have limited [[immigration]]. Considerable debate exists over what the ultimate carrying capacity of the planet may be; whether or not population growth containment policies are necessary; to what degree growth can safely occur thanks to increased economic and [[ecological efficiency]]; and how distribution mechanisms should accommodate demographic shifts. Many developed countries (most notably Japan) will experience [[population decline]], and the population debate is strongly tied with discussions about the [[distribution of wealth]].\n* '''[[Poverty]].''' Poverty remains the root cause of many of the world's other ills, including [[famine]], [[disease]], and insufficient [[education]]. Poverty contains many self-reinforcing elements (for instance, poverty can make education an unaffordable luxury, which tends to result in continuing poverty) that various aid groups hope to rectify in this century. Immense progress has been made in reducing poverty, especially in China and India but increasingly in Africa as well. [[Microcredit]] lending has also started to gain a profile as a useful anti-poverty tool.\n* '''[[Disease]].''' [[AIDS]], [[tuberculosis]] and [[malaria]] each kill over a million people annually. [[HIV]] remains without a cure or vaccine, and while new cases are declining it remains a major problem, especially for women.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avert.org/global-hiv-and-aids-statistics|title=Global HIV and AIDS statistics|date=July 16, 2015|website=AVERT}}</ref> [[Antibiotic resistance]] is a growing concern for organisms such as [[tuberculosis]]. Other diseases, such as [[SARS]], [[ebola]], the [[Zika virus]] and [[flu]] variations, are also causes for concern. The [[World Health Organization]] has [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3524824.stm warned] of a possible coming flu [[pandemic]] resulting from [[Avian influenza|bird flu]] [[mutation]]s. In 2009, there was an outbreak of [[2009 flu pandemic|swine flu]] whose country of origin is still unknown.[[File:World nuclear weapons.png|thumb|right|In early 2019, more than 90% of world's 13,865 [[List of states with nuclear weapons|nuclear weapons]] were owned by Russia and the United States.<ref>{{cite news |title=Global Nuclear Arsenal Declines, But Future Cuts Uncertain Amid U.S.-Russia Tensions |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/nuclear-weapons-russia-start-inf-warheads/30003088.html |work=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty |date=17 June 2019}}</ref> ]]\n* '''[[War]] and [[terrorism]].'''

The [[September 11 attacks|9/11 terrorist attacks]] triggered invasions of [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] and partially and controversially [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]]. The [[War on Terror]] has seen controversies over [[civil liberties]], accusations of [[torture]], continued terrorist attacks and ongoing instability, violence, and military occupation. Violence continues in the [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict]]. Considerable concern remains about [[nuclear proliferation]], especially in [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]], and the availability of [[weapons of mass destruction]] to rogue groups.\n**'''[[War on drugs]].''' Increasingly, the legal, social and military battle led by governments against drug cartels around the world show little results in ending drug trading and consumption, and a constant increase in the lives taken from this struggle. Notably, after 2006 in the [[Mexican Drug War]], more than 100,000 human lives have been lost to this conflict. Some jurisdictions have enacted some degree of legalization or decriminalization of some kinds of drugs, notably including several U.S. states legalizing [[marijuana]] either for recreational or medical use.\n* '''[[Intellectual property]].''' The increasing popularity of digital formats for entertainment media such as movies and music, and the ease of copying and distributing it via the [[Internet]] and [[peer-to-peer]] networks, has raised concerns in the media industry about [[copyright infringement]]. Much debate is proceeding about the proper bounds between protection of [[copyright]], [[trademark]] and [[patent]] rights versus [[fair use]] and the [[public domain]], where some argue that such laws have shifted greatly towards intellectual property owners and away from the interests of the general public in recent years, while others say that such legal change is needed to deal with a perceived threat of new technologies against the rights of authors and artists (or, as others put it, against the outmoded business models of the current entertainment industry). [[Domain name]] \"cybersquatting\" and access to patented drugs and generics to combat epidemics in third-world countries are other IP concerns.\n* '''[[Technology]]''' developments continue to change society. [[Cybernetics|Communications and control]] technology continues to augment the intelligence of individual humans, collections of humans, and machines. Some, notably [[Ray Kurzweil]], have predicted that by the middle of the century there will be a [[technological singularity]] if [[artificial intelligence]] that outsmarts humans is created. In addition, some [[economists]] have expressed concerns over [[technological unemployment]].[[File:World laws pertaining to homosexual relationships and expression.svg|thumb|{{legend|#025|Marriage open to same-sex couples}}{{legend|#800000|[[Death penalty for homosexuality]]}}]]  \n* '''[[Civil and political rights|Civil rights]]''', including [[women's rights]], [[LGBT rights by country or territory|LGBT rights]], [[racial equality]] and the rights of [[disability rights|disabled]] and [[neurodiversity|neurodiverse]] people are still a work in progress. [[Women]] are not able to realize or are outright denied their rights in many countries, including [[India]], [[China]]<ref>https://www.du.edu/korbel/hrhw/researchdigest/china/WomenChina.pdf</ref> and [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[sexual violence]] against women is still an enormous problem everywhere in the world. [[Sex-selective abortion]] has reduced the number of women born worldwide since 1990, mostly because of [[son preference]] in [[China]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Vietnam]], [[South Korea]] and some other smaller countries. In many countries attitudes towards [[homosexuality]] have become more tolerant. [[Same-sex marriage]] was legalized in several jurisdictions during the first two decades of the century, but outlawed by constitutional amendment in other places. Meanwhile, some countries such as [[Uganda]] and [[Russia]] moved to toughen their laws against any sort of [[homosexuality|homosexual]] behavior or expression. Political battles over pro- or anti-gay legislation provoked much activism in the streets and on the Internet. [[Hate group]]s remain a serious problem, and ethnic minorities have a lower status in many countries, including the United States. Neurological conditions such as [[autism]] are slowly becoming more understood and recognized.\n\n==Astronomical events==\n\n===List of the long central solar eclipses===\n* [[Solar eclipse of July 22, 2009]], total of 6 min 38.8 s, [[saros cycle|saros]] 136.\n* [[Solar eclipse of January 15, 2010]], annular of 11 min 08 s, [[saros (astronomy)|saros]] 141.

Initial operations were from Surabaya on the island of Java to destinations not served by Garuda Indonesia's mainline fleet: Yogyakarta (also on Java); Balikpapan on the island of Borneo and [[Tarakan, North Kalimantan]], just off Borneo's coast; and Makassar on the island of Sulawesi. By the end of 2001 Garuda had transferred five F28s to Citilink. In 2004 Citilink was serving ten destinations and Garuda began to replace the F28s with [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300s]].

Initial operations were from Surabaya on the island of Java to destinations not served by Garuda Indonesia's mainline fleet: Yogyakarta (also on Java); Balikpapan on the island of Borneo and [[Tarakan, North Kalimantan]], just off Borneo's coast; and Makassar on the island of Sulawesi. By the end of 2001 Garuda had transferred five F28s to Citilink. In 2004 Citilink was serving ten destinations and Garuda began to replace the F28s with [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300s]]. In 2008 Garuda temporarily suspended operations of Citilink, relaunching the brand in January 2009 after replacing the remaining Fokker F28s with more modern aircraft. In July 2010 Citilink operations were being conducted by two Boeing 737-300s and a [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-400]].\n\n===Spinoff and expansion plans===\nIn May 2011 Garuda announced plans for a spin-off of Citilink. The new business plan was for Citilink to become a separate business entity in the first quarter of 2012 with a full brand overhaul for the airline, including a new livery design; new website; a new cabin interior design and cabin crew uniforms; and new advertising and marketing strategies.<ref name=\"thejakartapost.com\">[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/08/05/garuda-announces-new-plans-citilink-ahead-spin.html Garuda announces new plans for Citilink ahead of spin-off | The Jakarta Post<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\nAn integral part of this plan was for Citilink to secure 25 new [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320s]] and utilising these new and more economical aircraft to expand into a significant regional low-cost carrier with the anticipation that by 2015, Citilink would contribute 30 percent of Garuda Indonesia's revenue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/node/154116|title=25 New Airbus 320s|work=pikiran-rakyat.com|accessdate=4 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/node/154113|title=2015, Citilink Contribute 30% Garuda Indonesia's Revenue|work=pikiran-rakyat.com|accessdate=4 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter obtaining an [[Air Operator's Certificate]] in August 2012, Citilink had carried 8 million passengers by the end of 2013 and was running at a load factor of 85 percent and an On Time Arrival rate of 87 percent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ekbis.rmol.co/read/2014/01/15/140001/Citilink-Terbangkan-8-Juta-Penumpang-Sejak-2012- |title=Citilink Terbangkan 8 Juta Penumpang Sejak 2012 |trans-title=Citilink Flies 8 Million Passengers Since 2012 |author=Widya Victoria |date=January 15, 2014}}</ref> In May 2015 the airline's fleet consisted of four Boeing 737-300s, four [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-500s]] and thirty-four Airbus A320s.\n\nIn late 2019, Citilink took delivery of two [[Airbus A330-900neo]] originally ordered by [[WOW Air]] which are to be used for flights to Germany, Japan,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.routesonline.com/news/38/airlineroute/289792/citilink-files-tokyo-frankfurt-preliminary-schedule-in-2q20/|title=Citilink files Tokyo/Frankfurt preliminary schedule in 2Q20|date=24 February 2020|website=routesonline.com/news/38/airlineroute/}}</ref> and Saudi Arabia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aerotime.aero/rytis.beresnevicius/22794-citilink-frankfurt-jeddah-flights|title=Citilink to fly from Indonesia to Germany and Saudi Arabia|date=2 July 2019|website=aerotime.aero}}</ref>\n\n== Destinations ==\n[[File:Citilink Fokker F-28-4000 Fellowship Sim.jpg|thumb|Citilink [[Fokker F28 Fellowship]] in 2003]]\n[[File:Citilink Boeing 737-300 MRD-3.jpg|thumb|Citilink [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]] at [[Juanda International Airport]] in 2005]]\n[[File:PK-GLY.jpg|thumb|Citilink Airbus A320-200 during final approach to [[Ngurah Rai Airport]] on 26 January 2017.]]\n[[File:Citilink Airbus A320-200 -20171206 12 44 18 Pro.jpg| thumb|Citilink [[Airbus A320neo]] pushing  back at [[Hajj]] terminal [[Jeddah]] [[King Abdulaziz International Airport]] on December 6, 2017.]]\nAs of March 2020, Citilink mostly serves Indonesian domestic destinations; it serves three international destinations:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.citilink.co.id/en/route-map |title=Route Map |website=Citilink |access-date=16 August 2018}}</ref><ref name=Penang>{{cite news|url=https://www.nst.com.my/business/2018/03/349532/citilink-indonesias-new-jakarta-penang-route-sets-asean-expansion |title=Citilink Indonesia's new Jakarta-Penang route sets off for Asean expansion |author=Ayisy Yusof |website=New Straits Times |date=26 March 2018 |access-date=16 August 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Kuala Lumpur\">{{cite news |last1=Nariswari |first1=Rita |title=Citilink Buka Rute Banyuwangi-Kuala Lumpur untuk Tarik Wisman |url=https://travel.tempo.co/read/1157033/citilink-buka-rute-banyuwangi-kuala-lumpur-untuk-tarik-wisman |accessdate=19 December 2018 |work=Tempo |date=19 December 2018 |language=id}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!
