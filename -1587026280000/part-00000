It is one type of [[ruby character|ruby text]]. Furigana is also known as {{nihongo|'''yomigana'''|\u8aad\u307f\u4eee\u540d}} or {{nihongo|'''rubi'''|[[wikt:\u30eb\u30d3|\u30eb\u30d3]]||{{IPA-ja|\u027e\u026f\ua71cbi|}}}} in Japanese. In modern Japanese, it is mostly used to gloss rare kanji, to clarify rare, nonstandard or ambiguous kanji readings, or in children's or learners' materials. Before the post-World War II [[Japanese script reform|script reforms]], it was more widespread.<ref name=\"Sampson1990\">{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Sampson|title=Writing Systems: A Linguistic Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tVcdNRvwoDkC&pg=PA190|date=1990|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-1756-4|page=190}}</ref>\n\nFurigana is most often written in [[hiragana]], though [[katakana]], Roman alphabet letters or other kanji can also be used in certain special cases. In vertical text, ''[[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|tategaki]]'', the furigana is placed to the right of the line of text; in horizontal text, ''[[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|yokogaki]]'', it is placed above the line of text, as illustrated below.\n\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-3}}\n{| \n|-\n| style=\"line-height:1em; font-size:2em\" | {{lang|ja|\u6f22}}|| style=\"line-height:1em; font-size:0.8em\" |{{lang|ja|\u304b<br>\u3093}}\n|-\n| style=\"line-height:1em; font-size:2em\" | {{lang|ja|\u5b57}}|| style=\"line-height:1em; font-size:0.8em\" |{{lang|ja|\u3058}}\n|}\n{{col-3|align=center|valign=middle}}\nor\n{{col-3}}\n{| \n|-\n| style=\"line-height:1em; font-size:0.8em; text-align:center\" | {{lang|ja|\u304b\u3093}}|| style=\"line-height:1em; font-size:0.8em; text-align:center\" |{{lang|ja|\u3058}}\n|-\n| style=\"line-height:1em; font-size:2em\" | {{lang|ja|\u6f22}}|| style=\"line-height:1em; font-size:2em\" |{{lang|ja|\u5b57}}\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\nThese examples spell the word ''kanji'', which is made up of two kanji characters: {{lang|ja|\u6f22}} (''kan'', written in hiragana as {{lang|ja|\u304b\u3093}}) and {{lang|ja|\u5b57}} (''ji'', written in hiragana as {{lang|ja|\u3058}}).\n\n==Appearance==\nFurigana may be added by character, in which case the furigana character(s) that correspond to a kanji are centered over that kanji; or by word or phrase, in which case the entire furigana text is centered over several kanji characters, even if the kanji do not represent equal shares of the kana needed to write them. The latter method is more common, especially since some words in Japanese have unique pronunciations (''[[jukujikun]]'') that are not related to readings of any of the characters the word is written with.\n\nFurigana fonts are generally sized so that two kana characters fit naturally over one kanji; when more kana are required, this is resolved either by adjusting the furigana by using a [[condensed font]] (narrowing the kana), or by adjusting the kanji by [[intercharacter spacing]] (adding spaces around the kanji). In case an isolated kanji character has a long reading\u2014for example {{lang|ja|\u301c\u306b\u643a\u308f\u308b}} (where {{lang|ja|\u643a}} reads {{lang|ja|\u305f\u305a\u3055}}, ''tazusa'')\u2014the furigana may instead spill over into the space next to the neighboring kana characters, without condensing or changing spacing. Three-kana readings are not uncommon, particularly due to ''[[y\u014don]]'' with a long vowel, such as {{Nihongo||\u308a\u3087\u3046|ry\u014d}}; five kana are required for {{Nihongo||\u5fd7\u3001\u3053\u3053\u308d\u3056\u3057|kokorozashi}} and six for {{Nihongo||\u627f\u308b\u3001\u3046\u3051\u305f\u307e\u308f\u308b|uketamawaru}}, the longest of any character in the [[Joyo kanji]]. Very long readings also occur for certain kanji or symbols which have a ''[[gairaigo]]'' reading; the word \"centimeter\" is generally written as \"cm\" (with two half-width characters, so occupying one space) and has the seven-kana reading {{lang|ja|\u30bb\u30f3\u30c1\u30e1\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb}} (''senchim\u0113toru'') (it can also be written as the kanji {{lang|ja|\u7cce}}, though this is very rare); another common example is \"%\" (the percent sign), which has the five kana reading {{lang|ja|\u30d1\u30fc\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8}} (''p\u0101sento''). These cause severe spacing problems due to length and these words being used as units (hence closely associated with the preceding figure).\n\nWhen it is necessary to distinguish between native Japanese ''[[Kanji#Kun'yomi (Japanese reading)|kun'yomi]]'' and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]-derived ''[[Kanji#On'yomi (Chinese reading)|on'yomi]]'' pronunciations, for example in [[Japanese dictionary|kanji dictionaries]], the Japanese pronunciations are written in [[hiragana]], and the Chinese pronunciations are written in [[katakana]]. However, this distinction is really only important in dictionaries and other reference works. In ordinary prose, the script chosen will usually be [[hiragana]]. The one general exception to this is ''modern'' Chinese place names, personal names, and (occasionally) food names\u2014these will often be written with kanji, and katakana used for the furigana; in more casual writing these are simply written in katakana, as borrowed words. Occasionally this style is also used for loanwords from other languages (especially English). For example, the kanji {{lang|ja|\u4e00\u89d2\u7363}} (literally \"one horn beast\") might be glossed with katakana {{lang|ja|\u30e6\u30cb\u30b3\u30fc\u30f3}}, ''yunik\u014dn'', to show the pronunciation of the loanword \"unicorn\", which is unrelated to the normal reading of the kanji. Generally, though, such loanwords are just written in straight katakana.\n\nThe distinction between regular kana and the smaller character forms ([[y\u014don]] and [[sokuon]]), which are used in regular orthography to mark such things as [[gemination]] and [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]], is often not made in furigana: for example, the usual [[hiragana]] spelling of the word {{lang|ja|\u5374\u4e0b}} (''kyakka'') is {{lang|ja|\u304d\u3083\u3063\u304b}}, but in furigana it might be written {{lang|ja|\u304d\u3084\u3064\u304b}}. This was especially common in old-fashioned [[printing press|movable type]] printing when smaller fonts were not available. Nowadays, with computer-based printing systems, this occurs less frequently.\n\n==Alignment rules in word processing or typesetting==\n{{Expand section|date=December 2018}}\nVarious [[Word processor|word processing]] or [[typesetting]] [[software]] programs, such as [[Microsoft Word]], [[Adobe InDesign]], [[Adobe InCopy]], etc. have features for adding [[Ruby character|ruby text]], especially Japanese furigana. Among formatting features are different rules for aligning the kana over or to the right of the base text, usually either when the base text string is longer than the furigana string or vice-versa. Extra spaces may be needed depending on the size of the shorter string (either the ruby string or the base string) relatively to the longer one.\n* [[Typographic alignment|Centered, left/top or right/bottom]]: No spaces are added in between the characters. The shorter string is aligned to the center (\u4e2d\u4ed8\u304d\u30eb\u30d3 ''nakatsuki rubi'')<ref name=align>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/NOTE-jlreq-20120403/#ruby_and_emphasis_dots|title=Requirements for Japanese Text Layout|date=April 2012|website=www.w3.org|publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]}}</ref>, the left/top (\u80a9\u4ed8\u304d\u30eb\u30d3 ''katatsuki rubi'')<ref name=align /> or the right/bottom of the longer string.\n* 1-2-1 ([[Japanese Industrial Standards|JIS]]): Spaces are added at the start of and the end of the shorter string, and in between its component characters, so that the spaces in between are twice as wide or tall as the spaces at the start and at the end. Space width or height is calculated based on the width or height of the square bounding box of a glyph (Japanese [[typeface]]s are generally [[Monospaced font|monospaced]]). The strings are still, in essence, aligned to the center of each other, rather than to the left/top or right/bottom.\n* 0-1-0: Equal spaces are added, similarly to the 1-2-1 rule, in between the component characters of the shorter string, but not its start or end.\n\n==Usage==\n[[File:JR Namba entrance.jpg|thumb|300px|On this sign, furigana indicate the pronunciation of the Latin letters \"[[Japan Railways Group|JR]]\" and the [[kanji]] for \"[[JR Namba Station|Namba]]\", though in this case the kana are not directly above the kanji, or even above at all.]]\nFurigana are most commonly used in works for children, who may not have sufficiently advanced reading skills to recognize the kanji, but can understand the word when written phonetically in [[hiragana]]. Because children learn hiragana before [[katakana]], in books for very young children, there are hiragana furigana next to the katakana characters. It is common to use furigana on all kanji characters in works for young children. This is called {{nihongo|''s\u014drubi''|[[wikt:\u7dcf\u30eb\u30d3|\u7dcf\u30eb\u30d3]]}} in Japanese.\n\nNumeric characters used for counting (e.g. {{lang|ja|\u4e8c{{ruby-ja|\u672c|\u307b\u3093}}/\uff12{{ruby-ja|\u672c|\u307b\u3093}}}} ''ni-hon'' \"two long things\"; {{lang|ja|\uff12\u3064\u3081}} ''futatsume'' \"second\"; {{lang|ja|{{ruby-ja|\u7b2c|\u3060\u3044}}\u4e8c{{ruby-ja|\u5dfb|\u304b\u3093}}/{{ruby-ja|\u7b2c|\u3060\u3044}}\uff12{{ruby-ja|\u5dfb|\u304b\u3093}}}} ''dai-ni kan'' \"book 2\"; {{lang|ja|\uff12\u30da\u30fc\u30b8}} ''ni-p\u0113ji'' \"page 2\"; etc.) are usually not tagged with furigana. Exceptions include a few cases such as \u4e00\u4eba/\uff11\u4eba ''hitori'' \"one person\" and \u4e8c\u4eba/\uff12\u4eba ''futari'' \"two people\", which may be tagged with separate kana for each character ({{lang|ja|{{ruby-ja|\u4e00|\u3072\u3068}}{{ruby-ja|\u4eba|\u308a}}}}/{{lang|ja|{{ruby-ja|\uff11|\u3072\u3068}}{{ruby-ja|\u4eba|\u308a}}}}), or non-separated kana for the whole word ({{lang|ja|{{ruby-ja|\u4e00\u4eba|\u3072\u3068\u308a}}}}/{{lang|ja|{{ruby-ja|\uff11\u4eba|\u3072\u3068\u308a}}}}), depending on the style of the publisher in question. Numeric words in established compounds (e.g. {{lang|ja|{{ruby-ja|\u4e00|\u3044\u3063}}{{ruby-ja|\u6b69|\u307d}}}} ''ippo'' \"step\"; {{lang|ja|{{ruby-ja|\u4e00|\u3072\u3068}}{{ruby-ja|\u76ee|\u3081}}}} ''hitome'' \"sight; attention\"), however, are generally tagged with furigana.\n\nMany [[Children's anime and manga|children's]], [[sh\u014dnen]] and [[sh\u014djo manga]] use furigana (however, rarely on [[Japanese numerals|numerals]]). Sh\u014dnen and sh\u014djo manga tend to have furigana for all non-numeric characters, while children's manga, such as ''[[Doraemon]]'', may also ignore furigana on elementary-grade kanji. [[Seinen]] and [[josei manga]] ignores furigana most of the time, even on the names of the characters if they're common names. There are also books with a phonetic guide (mainly in [[hiragana]] but sometimes in [[r\u014dmaji]]) for Japanese learners, which may be bilingual or Japanese only. These are popular with foreigners wishing to master Japanese faster and enjoy reading Japanese short stories, novels or articles.\n\nDue to the small type used for furigana, for maximum readability, some manga publishers may use regular kana instead of small kana. For example, \u306f\u3063\u3057\u3093 ''hasshin'' may be spelled \u306f\u3064\u3057\u3093 *''hatsushin'' instead.\n\nSome websites and tools exist which provide a phonetic guide for Japanese web pages (in hiragana, r\u014dmaji or [[Cyrillization of Japanese|kiriji]]); these are popular with both Japanese children and foreign Japanese learners.\n\nIn works aimed at adult Japanese speakers, furigana may be used on a word written in uncommon kanji; in the mass media, they are generally used on words containing non-[[J\u014dy\u014d kanji]].\n\nFurigana commonly appear alongside kanji names and their romanizations on signs for railway stations, even if the pronunciation of the kanji is commonly known. Furigana also appear often on maps to show the pronunciation of unusual place names.\n\nBefore the war, youths might arguably have been almost illiterate if not for furigana.<ref>{{cite book|last=Defrancis|first=John|title=The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=Honolulu|page=216|date=1986}}</ref>\n\n===Names===\n[[Japanese name]]s are usually written in [[kanji]]. Because there are many possible readings for kanji names, including special name-only readings called [[nanori]], furigana are often used to give the readings of names. On Japanese official forms, where the name is to be written, there is  always an adjacent column for the name to be written in furigana. Usually katakana is preferred.\n\nFurigana may also be used for foreign names written in kanji. Chinese and Korean names are the most common examples: Chinese names are usually pronounced with Japanese readings and the pronunciation written in hiragana, while Korean names are usually pronounced with Korean readings and the pronunciation written in katakana. Furigana may also be necessary in the rare case where names are transliterated into kanji from other languages (e.g. soccer star [[Ruy Ramos]] and politician [[Marutei Tsurunen]].)\n\n===Language learning===\nKanji and kanji compounds are often presented with furigana in Japanese language textbooks for non-native speakers.\n\nFurigana are also often used in foreign language textbooks for Japanese learners to indicate pronunciation. The words are written in the original foreign script, such as [[hangul]] for [[Korean language|Korean]], and furigana is used to indicate the pronunciation. According to Ministry of Education guidelines, and the opinions of educators, the use of Japanese furigana should be avoided in English teaching due to the differences in pronunciation between English and Japanese. For instance, the word \"birthdate\" might be glossed in furigana as {{lang|ja|\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30c7\u30a4\u30c8}} (''b\u0101sudeito''), which corresponds to an imperfect pronunciation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gifu-net.ed.jp/kyoka/eigo/CommunicativeEnglish/05-11cSpeaking.htm |title=Speaking/Pronunciation |author=Lena Ginsburg |date=July 2005|publisher=Gifu Prefectural Board of Education |accessdate=3 May 2012|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://genkienglish.net/katakana.htm |title=No Katakana!! |author=Richard Graham|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Punning and double meaning===\nSome writers use furigana to represent slang pronunciations, particularly those that would become hard to understand without the kanji to provide their meaning.\n\nAnother use is to write the kanji for something which had been previously referenced, but write furigana for {{transl|ja|''sore''}} ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u305d\u308c|\u305d\u308c]]}}) or {{transl|ja|''are''}} ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u3042\u308c|\u3042\u308c]]}}), meaning \"that\". This means that the actual word used was \"that\", but the kanji clarify for the reader what \"that\" refers to. Another way to use it is to tag {{transl|ja|''koko''}} ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u3053\u3053|\u3053\u3053]]}}) onto words or names for places, to convey something along the line of, for example, \"here (at this hospital)\" ({{ruby-ja|\u75c5\u9662|\u3053\u3053}}) or \"here (in [[Los Angeles|LA]])\" ({{ruby-ja|LA|\u3053\u3053}}).\n\nFurigana unrelated to the kanji they are assigned to are quite often used to convey certain effects, rather than to denote a phonetic guide, especially in manga, anime and games<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.japanesewithanime.com/2016/11/furigana-meaning.html|title=Furigana - What Is It?|work=Japanese with Anime|access-date=2017-08-28|language=en-US}}</ref> (card games, board games and video games all included). This usage is known as ''gikun'' (see also [[Kanji#Special readings]]). The specific types of effects vary: furigana could be used to visually reinforce complex ideas without having to use long expressions; to annotate strange, foreign, rarely seen text; to use more artistic or more explanatory spellings for regular words (see [[Kanji#Gikun]]); or simply for shorthand for base text abbreviation, thanks to the small type of furigana.

The song lyrics are often written in kanji pronounced quite differently from the furigana. The furigana version is used for pronunciation.\n\nAlso, because the kanji represent meaning while the furigana represent sound, one can combine the two to create [[pun]]s or indicate meanings of foreign words. One might write the kanji for \"blue\", but use katakana to write the pronunciation of the English word \"blue\"; this may be done, for example, in Japanese subtitles on foreign films, where it can help associate the written Japanese with the sounds actually being spoken by the actors, or it may be used in a translation of a work of fiction to enable the translator to preserve the original sound of a proper name (such as \"Firebolt\" in the [[Harry Potter]] series) in furigana, while simultaneously indicating its meaning with kanji. A similar practice is used in native fiction to clarify extended meanings. For example, in a work of science fiction, some astronaut could use the word {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u3075\u308b\u3055\u3068|\u3075\u308b\u3055\u3068]]}}, ''furusato'', meaning \"my hometown\", when referring to planet Earth. To clarify that for the reader, the word ''furusato'' (hometown) might be written in hiragana over the kanji for ''chikyuu'' (Earth).\n\n==Other Japanese reading aids==\n===Okurigana===\n{{Main|Okurigana}}\nOkurigana are kana that appear inline at normal size following kanji stems, typically to complete and to inflect adjectives and verbs. In this use they may also help to disambiguate kanji with multiple readings; for example, {{lang|ja|\u4e0a\u304c\u308b}} ({{lang|ja|\u3042\u304c\u308b}}, ''agaru'') vs. {{lang|ja|\u4e0a\u308b}} ({{lang|ja|\u306e\u307c\u308b}}, ''noboru''). Unlike furigana, the use of okurigana is a mandatory part of the written language.\n\n===Kunten===\n\nIn the written style known as ''[[kanbun]]'', which is the Japanese approximation of [[Classical Chinese]], small marks called ''[[kunten]]'' are sometimes added as reading aids. Unlike furigana, which indicate pronunciation, ''kunten'' indicate Japanese grammatical structures absent from the ''kanbun'', as well as showing how words should be reordered to fit Japanese sentence structure.\n\n===Furikanji===\nFurigana are sometimes also used to indicate meaning, rather than pronunciation. Over the foreign text, smaller sized Japanese words, in kana or kanji, corresponding to the ''meaning'' of the foreign words, effectively translate it in place. While rare now, some late 19th\u2013early 20th century authors used kanji as furigana for [[loanword]]s written in katakana. This usage is called {{nihongo|''furikanji''|\u632f\u308a\u6f22\u5b57}} in Japanese, since ''furi'''gana''''' implies the use of '''''[[kana]]'''''. For example, {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u30ea\u30ea\u30c3\u30af|{{ruby-ja|\u30ea\u30ea\u30c3\u30af|\u6b4c\u8a5e}}]]}} ''ririkku'' \"lyric\" may be tagged with {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u6b4c\u8a5e|\u6b4c\u8a5e]]}} ''kashi'' \"lyrics\" for clarification rather than for phonetic guidance.<ref>{{cite book|author=TAGRO|date=July 23, 2008|title=Hen Semi|chapter=#06|volume=1|title-link=Hen Semi}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Okurigana]]\n*[[Ruby character]]\n*[[Zhuyin]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n===Bibliography===\n* ''Mangajin's Basic Japanese Through Comics [Part I]'' New York: Weatherhill, 1998: 48\u201349\n* J Paul Warnick, Review of ''Nihon o Hanasoo'' in ''The Journal of the Association of Teachers of Japanese'', Vol. 32, No. 2 (Oct., 1998), pp.&nbsp;80\u201383\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070704184818/http://yomoyomo.jp/ Add Ruby automatically for Japanese Web site]\u2014Multi-language phonetic reading site that can add phonetic reading to any site or texts in five different alphabets, hiragana, katakana, Roman, hangul, Devanagari, and Cyrillic letters for Japanese.\n* [http://www.furiganizer.com The Furiganizer] is a convenient online reading aid for all kinds of Japanese text.

In modern Japanese, it is mostly used to gloss rare kanji, to clarify rare, nonstandard or ambiguous kanji readings, or in children's or learners' materials. Before the post-World War II [[Japanese script reform|script reforms]], it was more widespread.<ref name=\"Sampson1990\">{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Sampson|title=Writing Systems: A Linguistic Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tVcdNRvwoDkC&pg=PA190|date=1990|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-1756-4|page=190}}</ref>\n\nFurigana is most often written in [[hiragana]], though [[katakana]], Roman alphabet letters or other kanji can also be used in certain special cases. In vertical text, ''[[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|tategaki]]'', the furigana is placed to the right of the line of text; in horizontal text, ''[[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|yokogaki]]'', it is placed above the line of text, as illustrated below.\n\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-3}}\n{| \n|-\n| style=\"line-height:1em; font-size:2em\" | {{lang|ja|\u6f22}}|| style=\"line-height:1em; font-size:0.8em\" |{{lang|ja|\u304b<br>\u3093}}\n|-\n| style=\"line-height:1em; font-size:2em\" | {{lang|ja|\u5b57}}|| style=\"line-height:1em; font-size:0.8em\" |{{lang|ja|\u3058}}\n|}\n{{col-3|align=center|valign=middle}}\nor\n{{col-3}}\n{| \n|-\n| style=\"line-height:1em; font-size:0.8em; text-align:center\" | {{lang|ja|\u304b\u3093}}|| style=\"line-height:1em; font-size:0.8em; text-align:center\" |{{lang|ja|\u3058}}\n|-\n| style=\"line-height:1em; font-size:2em\" | {{lang|ja|\u6f22}}|| style=\"line-height:1em; font-size:2em\" |{{lang|ja|\u5b57}}\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\nThese examples spell the word ''kanji'', which is made up of two kanji characters: {{lang|ja|\u6f22}} (''kan'', written in hiragana as {{lang|ja|\u304b\u3093}}) and {{lang|ja|\u5b57}} (''ji'', written in hiragana as {{lang|ja|\u3058}}).\n\n==Appearance==\nFurigana may be added by character, in which case the furigana character(s) that correspond to a kanji are centered over that kanji; or by word or phrase, in which case the entire furigana text is centered over several kanji characters, even if the kanji do not represent equal shares of the kana needed to write them. The latter method is more common, especially since some words in Japanese have unique pronunciations (''[[jukujikun]]'') that are not related to readings of any of the characters the word is written with.\n\nFurigana fonts are generally sized so that two kana characters fit naturally over one kanji; when more kana are required, this is resolved either by adjusting the furigana by using a [[condensed font]] (narrowing the kana), or by adjusting the kanji by [[intercharacter spacing]] (adding spaces around the kanji). In case an isolated kanji character has a long reading\u2014for example {{lang|ja|\u301c\u306b\u643a\u308f\u308b}} (where {{lang|ja|\u643a}} reads {{lang|ja|\u305f\u305a\u3055}}, ''tazusa'')\u2014the furigana may instead spill over into the space next to the neighboring kana characters, without condensing or changing spacing. Three-kana readings are not uncommon, particularly due to ''[[y\u014don]]'' with a long vowel, such as {{Nihongo||\u308a\u3087\u3046|ry\u014d}}; five kana are required for {{Nihongo||\u5fd7\u3001\u3053\u3053\u308d\u3056\u3057|kokorozashi}} and six for {{Nihongo||\u627f\u308b\u3001\u3046\u3051\u305f\u307e\u308f\u308b|uketamawaru}}, the longest of any character in the [[Joyo kanji]]. Very long readings also occur for certain kanji or symbols which have a ''[[gairaigo]]'' reading; the word \"centimeter\" is generally written as \"cm\" (with two half-width characters, so occupying one space) and has the seven-kana reading {{lang|ja|\u30bb\u30f3\u30c1\u30e1\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb}} (''senchim\u0113toru'') (it can also be written as the kanji {{lang|ja|\u7cce}}, though this is very rare); another common example is \"%\" (the percent sign), which has the five kana reading {{lang|ja|\u30d1\u30fc\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8}} (''p\u0101sento''). These cause severe spacing problems due to length and these words being used as units (hence closely associated with the preceding figure).\n\nWhen it is necessary to distinguish between native Japanese ''[[Kanji#Kun'yomi (Japanese reading)|kun'yomi]]'' and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]-derived ''[[Kanji#On'yomi (Chinese reading)|on'yomi]]'' pronunciations, for example in [[Japanese dictionary|kanji dictionaries]], the Japanese pronunciations are written in [[hiragana]], and the Chinese pronunciations are written in [[katakana]]. However, this distinction is really only important in dictionaries and other reference works. In ordinary prose, the script chosen will usually be [[hiragana]]. The one general exception to this is ''modern'' Chinese place names, personal names, and (occasionally) food names\u2014these will often be written with kanji, and katakana used for the furigana; in more casual writing these are simply written in katakana, as borrowed words. Occasionally this style is also used for loanwords from other languages (especially English). For example, the kanji {{lang|ja|\u4e00\u89d2\u7363}} (literally \"one horn beast\") might be glossed with katakana {{lang|ja|\u30e6\u30cb\u30b3\u30fc\u30f3}}, ''yunik\u014dn'', to show the pronunciation of the loanword \"unicorn\", which is unrelated to the normal reading of the kanji. Generally, though, such loanwords are just written in straight katakana.\n\nThe distinction between regular kana and the smaller character forms ([[y\u014don]] and [[sokuon]]), which are used in regular orthography to mark such things as [[gemination]] and [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]], is often not made in furigana: for example, the usual [[hiragana]] spelling of the word {{lang|ja|\u5374\u4e0b}} (''kyakka'') is {{lang|ja|\u304d\u3083\u3063\u304b}}, but in furigana it might be written {{lang|ja|\u304d\u3084\u3064\u304b}}. This was especially common in old-fashioned [[printing press|movable type]] printing when smaller fonts were not available. Nowadays, with computer-based printing systems, this occurs less frequently.\n\n==Alignment rules in word processing or typesetting==\n{{Expand section|date=December 2018}}\nVarious [[Word processor|word processing]] or [[typesetting]] [[software]] programs, such as [[Microsoft Word]], [[Adobe InDesign]], [[Adobe InCopy]], etc. have features for adding [[Ruby character|ruby text]], especially Japanese furigana. Among formatting features are different rules for aligning the kana over or to the right of the base text, usually either when the base text string is longer than the furigana string or vice-versa. Extra spaces may be needed depending on the size of the shorter string (either the ruby string or the base string) relatively to the longer one.\n* [[Typographic alignment|Centered, left/top or right/bottom]]: No spaces are added in between the characters. The shorter string is aligned to the center (\u4e2d\u4ed8\u304d\u30eb\u30d3 ''nakatsuki rubi'')<ref name=align>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/NOTE-jlreq-20120403/#ruby_and_emphasis_dots|title=Requirements for Japanese Text Layout|date=April 2012|website=www.w3.org|publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]}}</ref>, the left/top (\u80a9\u4ed8\u304d\u30eb\u30d3 ''katatsuki rubi'')<ref name=align /> or the right/bottom of the longer string.\n* 1-2-1 ([[Japanese Industrial Standards|JIS]]): Spaces are added at the start of and the end of the shorter string, and in between its component characters, so that the spaces in between are twice as wide or tall as the spaces at the start and at the end. Space width or height is calculated based on the width or height of the square bounding box of a glyph (Japanese [[typeface]]s are generally [[Monospaced font|monospaced]]). The strings are still, in essence, aligned to the center of each other, rather than to the left/top or right/bottom.\n* 0-1-0: Equal spaces are added, similarly to the 1-2-1 rule, in between the component characters of the shorter string, but not its start or end.\n\n==Usage==\n[[File:JR Namba entrance.jpg|thumb|300px|On this sign, furigana indicate the pronunciation of the Latin letters \"[[Japan Railways Group|JR]]\" and the [[kanji]] for \"[[JR Namba Station|Namba]]\"]]\nFurigana are most commonly used in works for children, who may not have sufficiently advanced reading skills to recognize the kanji, but can understand the word when written phonetically in [[hiragana]]. Because children learn hiragana before [[katakana]], in books for very young children, there are hiragana furigana next to the katakana characters. It is common to use furigana on all kanji characters in works for young children. This is called {{nihongo|''s\u014drubi''|[[wikt:\u7dcf\u30eb\u30d3|\u7dcf\u30eb\u30d3]]}} in Japanese.\n\nNumeric characters used for counting (e.g. {{lang|ja|\u4e8c{{ruby-ja|\u672c|\u307b\u3093}}/\uff12{{ruby-ja|\u672c|\u307b\u3093}}}} ''ni-hon'' \"two long things\"; {{lang|ja|\uff12\u3064\u3081}} ''futatsume'' \"second\"; {{lang|ja|{{ruby-ja|\u7b2c|\u3060\u3044}}\u4e8c{{ruby-ja|\u5dfb|\u304b\u3093}}/{{ruby-ja|\u7b2c|\u3060\u3044}}\uff12{{ruby-ja|\u5dfb|\u304b\u3093}}}} ''dai-ni kan'' \"book 2\"; {{lang|ja|\uff12\u30da\u30fc\u30b8}} ''ni-p\u0113ji'' \"page 2\"; etc.) are usually not tagged with furigana. Exceptions include a few cases such as \u4e00\u4eba/\uff11\u4eba ''hitori'' \"one person\" and \u4e8c\u4eba/\uff12\u4eba ''futari'' \"two people\", which may be tagged with separate kana for each character ({{lang|ja|{{ruby-ja|\u4e00|\u3072\u3068}}{{ruby-ja|\u4eba|\u308a}}}}/{{lang|ja|{{ruby-ja|\uff11|\u3072\u3068}}{{ruby-ja|\u4eba|\u308a}}}}), or non-separated kana for the whole word ({{lang|ja|{{ruby-ja|\u4e00\u4eba|\u3072\u3068\u308a}}}}/{{lang|ja|{{ruby-ja|\uff11\u4eba|\u3072\u3068\u308a}}}}), depending on the style of the publisher in question. Numeric words in established compounds (e.g. {{lang|ja|{{ruby-ja|\u4e00|\u3044\u3063}}{{ruby-ja|\u6b69|\u307d}}}} ''ippo'' \"step\"; {{lang|ja|{{ruby-ja|\u4e00|\u3072\u3068}}{{ruby-ja|\u76ee|\u3081}}}} ''hitome'' \"sight; attention\"), however, are generally tagged with furigana.\n\nMany [[Children's anime and manga|children's]], [[sh\u014dnen]] and [[sh\u014djo manga]] use furigana (however, rarely on [[Japanese numerals|numerals]]). Sh\u014dnen and sh\u014djo manga tend to have furigana for all non-numeric characters, while children's manga, such as ''[[Doraemon]]'', may also ignore furigana on elementary-grade kanji. [[Seinen]] and [[josei manga]] ignores furigana most of the time, even on the names of the characters if they're common names. There are also books with a phonetic guide (mainly in [[hiragana]] but sometimes in [[r\u014dmaji]]) for Japanese learners, which may be bilingual or Japanese only. These are popular with foreigners wishing to master Japanese faster and enjoy reading Japanese short stories, novels or articles.\n\nDue to the small type used for furigana, for maximum readability, some manga publishers may use regular kana instead of small kana. For example, \u306f\u3063\u3057\u3093 ''hasshin'' may be spelled \u306f\u3064\u3057\u3093 *''hatsushin'' instead.\n\nSome websites and tools exist which provide a phonetic guide for Japanese web pages (in hiragana, r\u014dmaji or [[Cyrillization of Japanese|kiriji]]); these are popular with both Japanese children and foreign Japanese learners.\n\nIn works aimed at adult Japanese speakers, furigana may be used on a word written in uncommon kanji; in the mass media, they are generally used on words containing non-[[J\u014dy\u014d kanji]].\n\nFurigana commonly appear alongside kanji names and their romanizations on signs for railway stations, even if the pronunciation of the kanji is commonly known. Furigana also appear often on maps to show the pronunciation of unusual place names.\n\nBefore the war, youths might arguably have been almost illiterate if not for furigana.<ref>{{cite book|last=Defrancis|first=John|title=The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=Honolulu|page=216|date=1986}}</ref>\n\n===Names===\n[[Japanese name]]s are usually written in [[kanji]]. Because there are many possible readings for kanji names, including special name-only readings called [[nanori]], furigana are often used to give the readings of names. On Japanese official forms, where the name is to be written, there is  always an adjacent column for the name to be written in furigana. Usually katakana is preferred.\n\nFurigana may also be used for foreign names written in kanji. Chinese and Korean names are the most common examples: Chinese names are usually pronounced with Japanese readings and the pronunciation written in hiragana, while Korean names are usually pronounced with Korean readings and the pronunciation written in katakana. Furigana may also be necessary in the rare case where names are transliterated into kanji from other languages (e.g. soccer star [[Ruy Ramos]] and politician [[Marutei Tsurunen]].)\n\n===Language learning===\nKanji and kanji compounds are often presented with furigana in Japanese language textbooks for non-native speakers.\n\nFurigana are also often used in foreign language textbooks for Japanese learners to indicate pronunciation. The words are written in the original foreign script, such as [[hangul]] for [[Korean language|Korean]], and furigana is used to indicate the pronunciation. According to Ministry of Education guidelines, and the opinions of educators, the use of Japanese furigana should be avoided in English teaching due to the differences in pronunciation between English and Japanese. For instance, the word \"birthdate\" might be glossed in furigana as {{lang|ja|\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30c7\u30a4\u30c8}} (''b\u0101sudeito''), which corresponds to an imperfect pronunciation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gifu-net.ed.jp/kyoka/eigo/CommunicativeEnglish/05-11cSpeaking.htm |title=Speaking/Pronunciation |author=Lena Ginsburg |date=July 2005|publisher=Gifu Prefectural Board of Education |accessdate=3 May 2012|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://genkienglish.net/katakana.htm |title=No Katakana!! |author=Richard Graham|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Punning and double meaning===\nSome writers use furigana to represent slang pronunciations, particularly those that would become hard to understand without the kanji to provide their meaning.\n\nAnother use is to write the kanji for something which had been previously referenced, but write furigana for {{transl|ja|''sore''}} ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u305d\u308c|\u305d\u308c]]}}) or {{transl|ja|''are''}} ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u3042\u308c|\u3042\u308c]]}}), meaning \"that\". This means that the actual word used was \"that\", but the kanji clarify for the reader what \"that\" refers to. Another way to use it is to tag {{transl|ja|''koko''}} ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u3053\u3053|\u3053\u3053]]}}) onto words or names for places, to convey something along the line of, for example, \"here (at this hospital)\" ({{ruby-ja|\u75c5\u9662|\u3053\u3053}}) or \"here (in [[Los Angeles|LA]])\" ({{ruby-ja|LA|\u3053\u3053}}).\n\nFurigana unrelated to the kanji they are assigned to are quite often used to convey certain effects, rather than to denote a phonetic guide, especially in manga, anime and games<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.japanesewithanime.com/2016/11/furigana-meaning.html|title=Furigana - What Is It?|work=Japanese with Anime|access-date=2017-08-28|language=en-US}}</ref> (card games, board games and video games all included). This usage is known as ''gikun'' (see also [[Kanji#Special readings]]). The specific types of effects vary: furigana could be used to visually reinforce complex ideas without having to use long expressions; to annotate strange, foreign, rarely seen text; to use more artistic or more explanatory spellings for regular words (see [[Kanji#Gikun]]); or simply for shorthand for base text abbreviation, thanks to the small type of furigana. For example, the word {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u60aa\u5922|{{ruby-ja|\u60aa|\u3057\u3093}}{{ruby-ja|\u5922|\u3058\u3064}}]]}} \"nightmare\" may be assigned with {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u771f\u5b9f|\u3057\u3093\u3058\u3064]]}} ''shinjitsu'' \"truth\" rather than its true reading, {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u3042\u304f\u3080|\u3042\u304f\u3080]]}} ''akumu'', to convey the meaning of \"nightmarish truth\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Aoyama|first=Gosho|author-link=Gosho Aoyama|date=March 15, 2007|title=Magic Kaito|chapter=<span lang=\"ja\">\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30fb\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8\u306e{{ruby-ja|\u5dfb|\u307e\u304d}}\u3010{{ruby-ja|\u5f8c|\u3053\u3046}}{{ruby-ja|\u7de8|\u3078\u3093}}\u3011</span>|trans-chapter=Dark Knight [Last Chapter]|volume=4|title-link=Magic Kaito}}</ref> Some authors may even use furigana that means the opposite of what the base text does to reinforce an effect, such as the complicated relationship between characters.

The song lyrics are often written in kanji pronounced quite differently from the furigana. The furigana version is used for pronunciation.\n\nAlso, because the kanji represent meaning while the furigana represent sound, one can combine the two to create [[pun]]s or indicate meanings of foreign words. One might write the kanji for \"blue\", but use katakana to write the pronunciation of the English word \"blue\"; this may be done, for example, in Japanese subtitles on foreign films, where it can help associate the written Japanese with the sounds actually being spoken by the actors, or it may be used in a translation of a work of fiction to enable the translator to preserve the original sound of a proper name (such as \"Firebolt\" in the [[Harry Potter]] series) in furigana, while simultaneously indicating its meaning with kanji. A similar practice is used in native fiction to clarify extended meanings. For example, in a work of science fiction, some astronaut could use the word {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u3075\u308b\u3055\u3068|\u3075\u308b\u3055\u3068]]}}, ''furusato'', meaning \"my hometown\", when referring to planet Earth. To clarify that for the reader, the word ''furusato'' (hometown) might be written in hiragana over the kanji for ''chikyuu'' (Earth).\n\n==Other Japanese reading aids==\n===Okurigana===\n{{Main|Okurigana}}\nOkurigana are kana that appear inline at normal size following kanji stems, typically to complete and to inflect adjectives and verbs. In this use they may also help to disambiguate kanji with multiple readings; for example, {{lang|ja|\u4e0a\u304c\u308b}} ({{lang|ja|\u3042\u304c\u308b}}, ''agaru'') vs. {{lang|ja|\u4e0a\u308b}} ({{lang|ja|\u306e\u307c\u308b}}, ''noboru''). Unlike furigana, the use of okurigana is a mandatory part of the written language.\n\n===Kunten===\n\nIn the written style known as ''[[kanbun]]'', which is the Japanese approximation of [[Classical Chinese]], small marks called ''[[kunten]]'' are sometimes added as reading aids. Unlike furigana, which indicate pronunciation, ''kunten'' indicate Japanese grammatical structures absent from the ''kanbun'', as well as showing how words should be reordered to fit Japanese sentence structure.\n\n===Furikanji===\nFurigana are sometimes also used to indicate meaning, rather than pronunciation. Over the foreign text, smaller sized Japanese words, in kana or kanji, corresponding to the ''meaning'' of the foreign words, effectively translate it in place. While rare now, some late 19th\u2013early 20th century authors used kanji as furigana for [[loanword]]s written in katakana. This usage is called {{nihongo|''furikanji''|\u632f\u308a\u6f22\u5b57}} in Japanese, since ''furi'''gana''''' implies the use of '''''[[kana]]'''''. For example, {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u30ea\u30ea\u30c3\u30af|{{ruby-ja|\u30ea\u30ea\u30c3\u30af|\u6b4c\u8a5e}}]]}} ''ririkku'' \"lyric\" may be tagged with {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u6b4c\u8a5e|\u6b4c\u8a5e]]}} ''kashi'' \"lyrics\" for clarification rather than for phonetic guidance.<ref>{{cite book|author=TAGRO|date=July 23, 2008|title=Hen Semi|chapter=#06|volume=1|title-link=Hen Semi}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Okurigana]]\n*[[Ruby character]]\n*[[Zhuyin]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n===Bibliography===\n* ''Mangajin's Basic Japanese Through Comics [Part I]'' New York: Weatherhill, 1998: 48\u201349\n* J Paul Warnick, Review of ''Nihon o Hanasoo'' in ''The Journal of the Association of Teachers of Japanese'', Vol. 32, No. 2 (Oct., 1998), pp.&nbsp;80\u201383\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070704184818/http://yomoyomo.jp/ Add Ruby automatically for Japanese Web site]\u2014Multi-language phonetic reading site that can add phonetic reading to any site or texts in five different alphabets, hiragana, katakana, Roman, hangul, Devanagari, and Cyrillic letters for Japanese.\n* [http://www.furiganizer.com The Furiganizer] is a convenient online reading aid for all kinds of Japanese text.

Both were raised with a strong affinity to charity and at the time of having their first child and making their own family, wanted to create an organisation through which they could help other families who were a little less fortunate than theirs. Based on an understanding of what a positive impact a strong family unit can have on both individuals and community, The Sebastian Foundation looks to provide a little bit of the warmth and benefit of family where it might be missing through serious illness, underprivilege or domestic violence. Project based, the Foundation seeks to help where the need is \u2013 they have renovated kitchens, gardens, and living areas in women's refuges, provided sleeper beds to hospitals to allow families to stay together through treatment and countless other ways to make a difference in some of Australia's most vulnerable lives.<ref>http://www.thesebastianfoundation.org</ref> The Foundation has been working alongside the NSW Minister for Social Housing on a proposal that will revolutionise the way women fleeing domestic violence seek shelter which has the potential to impact generations to come, and a mentoring program to help young women who have been through the shelter system put their best foot forward. Funds are raised for the Foundation from corporate sponsors and through the annual MYER Carols in the City performance in Sydney.\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Guy Sebastian discography}}\n'''Studio albums'''\n* ''[[Just as I Am (Guy Sebastian album)|Just as I Am]]'' (2003)\n* ''[[Beautiful Life (Guy Sebastian album)|Beautiful Life]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[Closer to the Sun (Guy Sebastian album)|Closer to the Sun]]'' (2006)\n*''[[The Memphis Album]]'' (2007)\n*''[[Like It Like That (album)|Like it Like That]]'' (2009)\n*''[[Armageddon (Guy Sebastian album)|Armageddon]]'' (2012)\n*''[[Madness (Guy Sebastian album)|Madness]]'' (2014)\n*''[[Conscious (Guy Sebastian album)|Conscious]]'' (2017)\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{{Main|List of awards and nominations received by Guy Sebastian}}\n\nSebastian has been nominated for numerous awards during his career, winning many of them.

Project based, the Foundation seeks to help where the need is \u2013 they have renovated kitchens, gardens, and living areas in women's refuges, provided sleeper beds to hospitals to allow families to stay together through treatment and countless other ways to make a difference in some of Australia's most vulnerable lives.<ref>http://www.thesebastianfoundation.org</ref> The Foundation has been working alongside the NSW Minister for Social Housing on a proposal that will revolutionise the way women fleeing domestic violence seek shelter which has the potential to impact generations to come, and a mentoring program to help young women who have been through the shelter system put their best foot forward. Funds are raised for the Foundation from corporate sponsors and through the annual MYER Carols in the City performance in Sydney.\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Guy Sebastian discography}}\n'''Studio albums'''\n* ''[[Just as I Am (Guy Sebastian album)|Just as I Am]]'' (2003)\n* ''[[Beautiful Life (Guy Sebastian album)|Beautiful Life]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[Closer to the Sun (Guy Sebastian album)|Closer to the Sun]]'' (2006)\n*''[[The Memphis Album]]'' (2007)\n*''[[Like It Like That (album)|Like it Like That]]'' (2009)\n*''[[Armageddon (Guy Sebastian album)|Armageddon]]'' (2012)\n*''[[Madness (Guy Sebastian album)|Madness]]'' (2014)\n*''[[Conscious (Guy Sebastian album)|Conscious]]'' (2017)\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{{Main|List of awards and nominations received by Guy Sebastian}}\n\nSebastian has been nominated for numerous awards during his career, winning many of them.

The roots of ''abhinaya'' appear in the ''Natyashastra'' text, which defines drama in verse 6.10 as something that aesthetically arouses joy in the spectator, through the medium of actor's art of communication, that helps connect and transport the individual into a sensual inner state of being.{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|p=3}} A performance art, asserts ''Natyashastra'', connects the artists and the audience through ''abhinaya'' (literally, \"carrying to the spectators\"), that is applying body-speech-mind and scene, wherein the actors communicate to the audience, through song and music.{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|p=3}} Drama in this ancient Sanskrit text, thus is an art that engages every aspect of life to glorify and give a state of joyful consciousness.{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|p=5}}\n\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|total_width=160\n| image1=Hasthamudra8.JPG |width1=3072|height1=2304\n| image2=Hasthamudra18.JPG |width2=3072|height2=2304\n| image3=Hasthamudra11.JPG |width3=3072|height3=2304\n| image4=Hasthamudra7.JPG |width4=3072|height4=2304\n| image5=Hasthamudra19.JPG | width5=3072|height5=2304\n| image6=Hasthamudra17.JPG |width6=3072|height6=2304\n| footer=Example ''[[List of mudras (dance)|mudras]]'' \u2013 gestures as symbols in Bharatanatyam.\n}}\n\nThe communication through symbols is in the form of expressive gestures and pantomime set to music. The gestures and facial expressions convey the ''ras'' (sentiment, emotional taste) and ''bhava'' (mood) of the underlying story.<ref name=\"BajajVohra2015p82\"/> In the Hindu texts on dance, the dancer successfully expresses the spiritual ideas by paying attention to four aspects of a performance: ''Angika'' (gestures and body language), ''Vachika'' (song, recitation, music and rhythm), ''Aharya'' (stage setting, costume, make up, jewelry), and ''Sattvika'' (artist's mental disposition and emotional connection with the story and audience, wherein the artist's inner and outer state resonates).<ref name=\"BajajVohra2015p82\">{{cite book|author1=Tanvi Bajaj |author2=Swasti Shrimali Vohra|title=Performing Arts and Therapeutic Implications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2MRcCgAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-32572-7 |pages=82\u201384}}</ref> ''Abhinaya'' draws out the ''bhava'' (mood, psychological states).<ref name=\"BajajVohra2015p82\"/>\n\nThe gestures used in Bharatanatyam are called ''Hasta'' (or ''[[List of mudras (dance)|mudras]]''). These symbols are of three types: ''asamyuta hastas'' (single hand gestures), ''samyuta hastas'' (two hand gestures) and ''nrtta hastas'' (dance hand gestures).<ref name=\"BajajVohra2015p85\"/> Like words in a glossary, these gestures are presented in the ''nritta'' as a list or embellishment to a prelim performance.

The roots of ''abhinaya'' appear in the ''Natyashastra'' text, which defines drama in verse 6.10 as something that aesthetically arouses joy in the spectator, through the medium of actor's art of communication, that helps connect and transport the individual into a sensual inner state of being.{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|p=3}} A performance art, asserts ''Natyashastra'', connects the artists and the audience through ''abhinaya'' (literally, \"carrying to the spectators\"), that is applying body-speech-mind and scene, wherein the actors communicate to the audience, through song and music.{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|p=3}} Drama in this ancient Sanskrit text, thus is an art that engages every aspect of life to glorify and give a state of joyful consciousness.{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|p=5}}\n\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|total_width=160\n| image1=Hasthamudra8.JPG |width1=3072|height1=2304\n| image2=Hasthamudra18.JPG |width2=3072|height2=2304\n| image3=Hasthamudra11.JPG |width3=3072|height3=2304\n| image4=Hasthamudra7.JPG |width4=3072|height4=2304\n| image5=Hasthamudra19.JPG | width5=3072|height5=2304\n| image6=Hasthamudra17.JPG |width6=3072|height6=2304\n| footer=Example ''[[List of mudras (dance)|mudras]]'' \u2013 gestures as symbols in Bharatanatyam.\n}}\n\nThe communication through symbols is in the form of expressive gestures and pantomime set to music.

(season 1)|first season]] of the American television series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''. Based on the [[Marvel Comics]] organization [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], it follows [[Phil Coulson]] and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they travel to [[Peru]] to investigate an object of unknown origins. It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) and acknowledges [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the franchise's films]]. The episode was written by showrunners [[Maurissa Tancharoen]], [[Jed Whedon]], and [[Jeffrey Bell]], and was directed by [[David Straiton]].\n\n[[Clark Gregg]] reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, starring alongside [[Ming-Na Wen]], [[Brett Dalton]], [[Chloe Bennet]], [[Iain De Caestecker]], and [[Elizabeth Henstridge]]. The episode is set in Peru, featuring guest star [[Leonor Varela]] as a member of the Peruvian military involved with the [[Internal conflict in Peru|ongoing conflict between the Peruvian government and rebel forces]]. Composer [[Bear McCreary]] used ethnic instruments in his score for the episode to support this setting. [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]] technology is carried over from the films to tie-in with the conflict. Special guest star [[Samuel L. Jackson]] also reprises his role of [[Nick Fury]] from the film series in a [[cameo appearance]].\n\n\"0-8-4\" originally aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on October 1, 2013, and was watched by 13.17 million viewers within a week. The episode received a mostly positive critical response, with Jackson's appearance considered a highlight by many, but also seen as unearned.\n\n==Plot==\nBeginning immediately after \"[[Pilot (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Pilot]]\", \"0-8-4\" sees [[Daisy Johnson|Skye]] accept Agent [[Phil Coulson]]'s offer to join his S.H.I.E.L.D. team as a consultant. Though agents Melinda May and Grant Ward oppose this due to her [[hacktivist]] background and lack of S.H.I.E.L.D. training, Coulson believes that Skye can be an asset.\n\nThe team travels to [[Peru]] to investigate a reported 0-8-4 (the S.H.I.E.L.D. designation for \"an object of unknown origin\"). They find the object within an ancient Incan temple, and agents Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons determine that it is [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] made: powered by the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]] and extremely volatile. The national military arrives to claim the weapon for the Peruvian government, led by Camilla Reyes, a former colleague of Coulson's. When they are all attacked by local rebels, the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and soldiers escape with the weapon to the plane that serves as the agents' mobile base.\n\nEn route to a classified S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, tensions among the agents are high due to poor communication during the fight. This concerns Reyes, who decides to double-cross Coulson and secure the 0-8-4 for her government. Together, the agents devise a plan to activate the weapon, blowing a hole in the Bus. The drop in pressure opens the interior doors, allowing the agents to subdue the soldiers. At the facility, Reyes and her men are incarcerated and the 0-8-4 is launched into the sun in a rocket. The team watch the launch together, celebrating their combined efforts, while Ward agrees to supervise Skye's S.H.I.E.L.D. training. Skye secretly confirms her allegiance to the hacktivist group the Rising Tide.\n\nIn an end tag, S.H.I.E.L.D. Director [[Nick Fury]] scolds Coulson for the damage caused to the plane during the fight, and expresses his doubts over Skye's loyalty.\n\n==Production==\n===Development and casting===\n{{further|List of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. characters}}\nIn June 2013, [[Samuel L. Jackson]] expressed interest in appearing in the show as S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury,<ref name=\"Jackson\"/> his role from the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|MCU films]],<ref name=\"JacksonIMIM2\" /><ref name=\"JacksonThorCapTFAAvengers\" /> which led to his cameo appearance at the end of this episode.<ref name=\"zap2it\" /> Executive producer [[Jeph Loeb]] said \"There were obviously a number of places that we thought Nick Fury would have a big impact on the show, but the more we talked about it, [the more we wanted] to get him in very early, so that it would kind of christen the show, legitimize it in its own way.\"<ref name=\"LoebCasting\" /> It was a challenge for the showrunners to keep Jackson's cameo a surprise due to \"this age of tweets and spoilers\".<ref name=\"BellOct2013\" />\n\nIn October, Marvel revealed that the episode would be titled \"0-8-4\", and would be written by the series' showrunners [[Maurissa Tancharoen]], [[Jed Whedon]], and [[Jeffrey Bell]], with [[David Straiton]] directing. The release confirmed that the series' main cast would star in the episode: [[Clark Gregg]] as [[Phil Coulson]], [[Ming-Na Wen]] as Melinda May, [[Brett Dalton]] as Grant Ward, [[Chloe Bennet]] as [[Daisy Johnson|Skye]], [[Iain De Caestecker]] as Leo Fitz, and [[Elizabeth Henstridge]] as Jemma Simmons. The episode's guest cast was revealed to include [[Leonor Varela]] as Camilla Reyes and [[Carlos Leal]] as an archaeologist.<ref name=\"Preview\" />\n\n===Music===\nComposer [[Bear McCreary]] had a larger orchestra to work with on \"0-8-4\" than he did with \"Pilot\", allowing him to compose a much more \"traditional and, at times, grandiose\" score; however he also opted to expand his synthesizer use to be \"beefier and more aggressive\". The South American setting also allowed an ethnic component to enter the score, with frequent McCreary collaborators M.B. Gordy and Chris Bleth playing tribal-sounding drums and ethnic woodwinds, respectively. Guitarist Ed Trybek also recorded for the episode, playing multiple South American guitars, including [[timple]] and [[charango]].<ref name=\"music\" />\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\nThe titular weapon is powered by the Tesseract, the [[macguffin]] of ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' (2011) and ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012), and was made by [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]], a fictional organization that also appeared in ''Captain America: The First Avenger''.<ref name=\"MarvelContinuity\" /> It is stated in the episode that the last object of unknown origin that S.H.I.E.L.D. encountered was \"a hammer\", referring to the weapon [[Mjolnir|Mj\u00f6lnir]], which Coulson discovered during the events of ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011).<ref name=\"MarvelContinuity\" /> Also, Coulson refers to Skye as a consultant, which S.H.I.E.L.D. classified [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] as during ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010), ''The Avengers'', and the [[Marvel One-Shot]] ''[[Marvel One-Shots#The Consultant (2011)|The Consultant]]'' (2011).<ref name=\"zap2it\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Broadcast===\n\"0-8-4\" was first aired in the United States on ABC on October 1, 2013.<ref name=\"ratings\" /> It was aired alongside the US broadcast in Canada on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]],<ref name=\"canada\" /> while it was first aired in the United Kingdom on [[Channel 4]] on October 4, 2013.<ref name=\"uk\" /> It premiered on the [[Seven Network]] in Australia on October 2, 2013.<ref name=\"australia\"/>\n\n===Home media===\nThe episode, along with the rest of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''{{'}}s first season, was released on [[Blu-ray]] and [[DVD]] on September 9, 2014. Bonus features include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel.<ref name=\"HomeMedia\" /> On November 20, 2014, the episode became available for streaming on [[Netflix]].<ref name=\"Netflix\" />\n\n==Reception==\n===Ratings===\nIn the United States the episode received a 3.3/10 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, meaning that it was seen by 3.3 percent of all households, and 10 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast. It was watched by 8.66 million viewers.<ref name=\"ratings\" /> The Canadian broadcast gained 1.83 million viewers, the fourth highest for that day and the twelfth highest for the week.<ref name=\"canada\" /> The [[United Kingdom]] premiere had 3.08 million viewers,<ref name=\"uk\" /> and in [[Australia]], the premiere had 2.8 million viewers, including 1.3 million [[Time shifting|timeshifted]] viewers.<ref name=\"australia\" /> Within a week of its release, the episode was watched by 13.17 million U.S. viewers,<ref name=\"DVR\" /> above the season average of 8.31.<ref name=\"AvgRatings\" />\n\n===Critical response===\n[[MTV.com]] gave a positive review, saying \"If tonight's installment is any indication, the cast will soon be able to support their own weight, make Coulson proud, and audiences sit up and pay attention\", and comparing it positively to ''[[Tarzan: The Epic Adventures|Tarzan]]'', ''[[BeastMaster (TV series)|Beastmaster]]'', and ''[[Mutant X (TV series)|Mutant X]]''.<ref name=\"MTV\" /> Terri Schwartz of [[Zap2it]] also gave a particularly positive review, praising both the connections to the films, including Jackson's cameo, and the internal development of the show, namely that of the character Skye and the team as a whole.<ref name=\"zap2it\" /> Dan Casey of [[Nerdist Industries|Nerdist]] called \"0-8-4\" \"a strong second episode, [which] managed to course-correct from some of the missteps of the pilot\". He praised the \"solid mix of action, character development, and humor\" and concluded that the episode was \"genuinely enjoyable television\".<ref name=\"Nerdist\" /> Eric Goldman of [[IGN]] scored the episode 7.5 out of 10, comparing it positively to ''[[The A-Team]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'', praising its self-awareness, Jackson's cameo, and the development of Coulson's character, but criticizing the lack of development for other characters.<ref name=\"IGN\" />\n\nOliver Sava of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' called the episode \"an adequate hour of action-adventure television, but the first 59 minutes are missing the spark of the final post-credits scene\", seeing room for improvement for all the cast members, and concluding that the show falls \"somewhere between [[Firefly (TV series)|''Firefly'']] and [[Dollhouse (TV series)|''Dollhouse'']] on the spectrum of Whedon TV influences\".<ref name=\"AVClub\" />  Graeme Virtue of ''[[The Guardian]]'' called Gregg \"''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''{{'}}s greatest asset\", finding the Jackson cameo to be a \"thrill\", but that \"plot-wise, things perhaps still feel a little inconsequential\".<ref name=\"Guardian\" /> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Marc Bernardin praised the scale of the episode, describing it as coming \"out of the gate like a blockbuster\", but criticized its ambitions, asking \"Shouldn't this show be, well, nuttier? ... ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' needs to unhinge itself, but good, and not just be a procedural.\" He also singled out Skye and May as being unfocused and underdeveloped, respectively, as characters, and he felt the Jackson cameo \"gave the whole thing a charge that, in truth, it didn't really earn.\"<ref name=\"Hollywood\" /> [[Jim Steranko]], known for his work on ''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', found the episode to be \"smoother [than 'Pilot'], although more formulaic\". He criticized the plot and characters, but praised Jackson's cameo as \"an electrifying reminder of what the series could and should be.\"<ref name=\"Steranko\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<!-- CONTINUITY -->\n\n<ref name=\"JacksonIMIM2\">{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Fleming |date=February 25, 2009 |title=Samuel Jackson joins 'Iron' cast |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118000573.html |accessdate=March 30, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6A5l4hTlW?url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118000573 |archivedate=August 21, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"JacksonThorCapTFAAvengers\">{{cite news |url=http://splashpage.mtv.com/2011/02/03/nick-fury-cameos-thor-captain-america-avengers-actresses/ |last=Marshall |first=Rick |title=Nick Fury's 'Thor' & 'Captain America' Cameos Confirmed, Four Actresses Vying For New 'Avengers' Role |publisher=[[MTV News]] |date=February 3, 2011 |accessdate=March 29, 2013 |archivedate=March 29, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FUHIY2wk?url=http://splashpage.mtv.com/2011/02/03/nick-fury-cameos-thor-captain-america-avengers-actresses/ |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"MarvelContinuity\">{{cite news |url=http://marvel.com/news/tv/2013/10/4/21291/marvels_agents_of_shield_debriefs_0-8-4 |last=Strom |first=Marc |title=Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

The episode received a mostly positive critical response, with Jackson's appearance considered a highlight by many, but also seen as unearned.\n\n==Plot==\nBeginning immediately after \"[[Pilot (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Pilot]]\", \"0-8-4\" sees [[Daisy Johnson|Skye]] accept Agent [[Phil Coulson]]'s offer to join his S.H.I.E.L.D. team as a consultant. Though agents Melinda May and Grant Ward oppose this due to her [[hacktivist]] background and lack of S.H.I.E.L.D. training, Coulson believes that Skye can be an asset.\n\nThe team travels to [[Peru]] to investigate a reported 0-8-4 (the S.H.I.E.L.D. designation for \"an object of unknown origin\"). They find the object within an ancient Incan temple, and agents Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons determine that it is [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] made: powered by the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]] and extremely volatile. The national military arrives to claim the weapon for the Peruvian government, led by Camilla Reyes, a former colleague of Coulson's. When they are all attacked by local rebels, the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and soldiers escape with the weapon to the plane that serves as the agents' mobile base.\n\nEn route to a classified S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, tensions among the agents are high due to poor communication during the fight. This concerns Reyes, who decides to double-cross Coulson and secure the 0-8-4 for her government. Together, the agents devise a plan to activate the weapon, blowing a hole in the Bus. The drop in pressure opens the interior doors, allowing the agents to subdue the soldiers. At the facility, Reyes and her men are incarcerated and the 0-8-4 is launched into the sun in a rocket. The team watch the launch together, celebrating their combined efforts, while Ward agrees to supervise Skye's S.H.I.E.L.D. training. Skye secretly confirms her allegiance to the hacktivist group the Rising Tide.\n\nIn an end tag, S.H.I.E.L.D. Director [[Nick Fury]] scolds Coulson for the damage caused to the plane during the fight, and expresses his doubts over Skye's loyalty.\n\n==Production==\n===Development and casting===\n{{further|List of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. characters}}\nIn June 2013, [[Samuel L. Jackson]] expressed interest in appearing in the show as S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury,<ref name=\"Jackson\"/> his role from the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|MCU films]],<ref name=\"JacksonIMIM2\" /><ref name=\"JacksonThorCapTFAAvengers\" /> which led to his cameo appearance at the end of this episode.<ref name=\"zap2it\" /> Executive producer [[Jeph Loeb]] said \"There were obviously a number of places that we thought Nick Fury would have a big impact on the show, but the more we talked about it, [the more we wanted] to get him in very early, so that it would kind of christen the show, legitimize it in its own way.\"<ref name=\"LoebCasting\" /> It was a challenge for the showrunners to keep Jackson's cameo a surprise due to \"this age of tweets and spoilers\".<ref name=\"BellOct2013\" />\n\nIn October, Marvel revealed that the episode would be titled \"0-8-4\", and would be written by the series' showrunners [[Maurissa Tancharoen]], [[Jed Whedon]], and [[Jeffrey Bell]], with [[David Straiton]] directing. The release confirmed that the series' main cast would star in the episode: [[Clark Gregg]] as [[Phil Coulson]], [[Ming-Na Wen]] as Melinda May, [[Brett Dalton]] as Grant Ward, [[Chloe Bennet]] as [[Daisy Johnson|Skye]], [[Iain De Caestecker]] as Leo Fitz, and [[Elizabeth Henstridge]] as Jemma Simmons. The episode's guest cast was revealed to include [[Leonor Varela]] as Camilla Reyes and [[Carlos Leal]] as an archaeologist.<ref name=\"Preview\" />\n\n===Music===\nComposer [[Bear McCreary]] had a larger orchestra to work with on \"0-8-4\" than he did with \"Pilot\", allowing him to compose a much more \"traditional and, at times, grandiose\" score; however he also opted to expand his synthesizer use to be \"beefier and more aggressive\". The South American setting also allowed an ethnic component to enter the score, with frequent McCreary collaborators M.B. Gordy and Chris Bleth playing tribal-sounding drums and ethnic woodwinds, respectively. Guitarist Ed Trybek also recorded for the episode, playing multiple South American guitars, including [[timple]] and [[charango]].<ref name=\"music\" />\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\nThe titular weapon is powered by the Tesseract, the [[macguffin]] of ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' (2011) and ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012), and was made by [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]], a fictional organization that also appeared in ''Captain America: The First Avenger''.<ref name=\"MarvelContinuity\" /> It is stated in the episode that the last object of unknown origin that S.H.I.E.L.D. encountered was \"a hammer\", referring to the weapon [[Mjolnir|Mj\u00f6lnir]], which Coulson discovered during the events of ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011).<ref name=\"MarvelContinuity\" /> Also, Coulson refers to Skye as a consultant, which S.H.I.E.L.D. classified [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] as during ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010), ''The Avengers'', and the [[Marvel One-Shot]] ''[[Marvel One-Shots#The Consultant (2011)|The Consultant]]'' (2011).<ref name=\"zap2it\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Broadcast===\n\"0-8-4\" was first aired in the United States on ABC on October 1, 2013.<ref name=\"ratings\" /> It was aired alongside the US broadcast in Canada on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]],<ref name=\"canada\" /> while it was first aired in the United Kingdom on [[Channel 4]] on October 4, 2013.<ref name=\"uk\" /> It premiered on the [[Seven Network]] in Australia on October 2, 2013.<ref name=\"australia\"/>\n\n===Home media===\nThe episode, along with the rest of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''{{'}}s first season, was released on [[Blu-ray]] and [[DVD]] on September 9, 2014. Bonus features include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel.<ref name=\"HomeMedia\" /> On November 20, 2014, the episode became available for streaming on [[Netflix]].<ref name=\"Netflix\" />\n\n==Reception==\n===Ratings===\nIn the United States the episode received a 3.3/10 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, meaning that it was seen by 3.3 percent of all households, and 10 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast. It was watched by 8.66 million viewers.<ref name=\"ratings\" /> The Canadian broadcast gained 1.83 million viewers, the fourth highest for that day and the twelfth highest for the week.<ref name=\"canada\" /> The [[United Kingdom]] premiere had 3.08 million viewers,<ref name=\"uk\" /> and in [[Australia]], the premiere had 2.8 million viewers, including 1.3 million [[Time shifting|timeshifted]] viewers.<ref name=\"australia\" /> Within a week of its release, the episode was watched by 13.17 million U.S. viewers,<ref name=\"DVR\" /> above the season average of 8.31.<ref name=\"AvgRatings\" />\n\n===Critical response===\n[[MTV.com]] gave a positive review, saying \"If tonight's installment is any indication, the cast will soon be able to support their own weight, make Coulson proud, and audiences sit up and pay attention\", and comparing it positively to ''[[Tarzan: The Epic Adventures|Tarzan]]'', ''[[BeastMaster (TV series)|Beastmaster]]'', and ''[[Mutant X (TV series)|Mutant X]]''.<ref name=\"MTV\" /> Terri Schwartz of [[Zap2it]] also gave a particularly positive review, praising both the connections to the films, including Jackson's cameo, and the internal development of the show, namely that of the character Skye and the team as a whole.<ref name=\"zap2it\" /> Dan Casey of [[Nerdist Industries|Nerdist]] called \"0-8-4\" \"a strong second episode, [which] managed to course-correct from some of the missteps of the pilot\". He praised the \"solid mix of action, character development, and humor\" and concluded that the episode was \"genuinely enjoyable television\".<ref name=\"Nerdist\" /> Eric Goldman of [[IGN]] scored the episode 7.5 out of 10, comparing it positively to ''[[The A-Team]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'', praising its self-awareness, Jackson's cameo, and the development of Coulson's character, but criticizing the lack of development for other characters.<ref name=\"IGN\" />\n\nOliver Sava of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' called the episode \"an adequate hour of action-adventure television, but the first 59 minutes are missing the spark of the final post-credits scene\", seeing room for improvement for all the cast members, and concluding that the show falls \"somewhere between [[Firefly (TV series)|''Firefly'']] and [[Dollhouse (TV series)|''Dollhouse'']] on the spectrum of Whedon TV influences\".<ref name=\"AVClub\" />  Graeme Virtue of ''[[The Guardian]]'' called Gregg \"''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''{{'}}s greatest asset\", finding the Jackson cameo to be a \"thrill\", but that \"plot-wise, things perhaps still feel a little inconsequential\".<ref name=\"Guardian\" /> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Marc Bernardin praised the scale of the episode, describing it as coming \"out of the gate like a blockbuster\", but criticized its ambitions, asking \"Shouldn't this show be, well, nuttier? ... ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' needs to unhinge itself, but good, and not just be a procedural.\" He also singled out Skye and May as being unfocused and underdeveloped, respectively, as characters, and he felt the Jackson cameo \"gave the whole thing a charge that, in truth, it didn't really earn.\"<ref name=\"Hollywood\" /> [[Jim Steranko]], known for his work on ''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', found the episode to be \"smoother [than 'Pilot'], although more formulaic\". He criticized the plot and characters, but praised Jackson's cameo as \"an electrifying reminder of what the series could and should be.\"<ref name=\"Steranko\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<!-- CONTINUITY -->\n\n<ref name=\"JacksonIMIM2\">{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Fleming |date=February 25, 2009 |title=Samuel Jackson joins 'Iron' cast |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118000573.html |accessdate=March 30, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6A5l4hTlW?url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118000573 |archivedate=August 21, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"JacksonThorCapTFAAvengers\">{{cite news |url=http://splashpage.mtv.com/2011/02/03/nick-fury-cameos-thor-captain-america-avengers-actresses/ |last=Marshall |first=Rick |title=Nick Fury's 'Thor' & 'Captain America' Cameos Confirmed, Four Actresses Vying For New 'Avengers' Role |publisher=[[MTV News]] |date=February 3, 2011 |accessdate=March 29, 2013 |archivedate=March 29, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FUHIY2wk?url=http://splashpage.mtv.com/2011/02/03/nick-fury-cameos-thor-captain-america-avengers-actresses/ |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"MarvelContinuity\">{{cite news |url=http://marvel.com/news/tv/2013/10/4/21291/marvels_agents_of_shield_debriefs_0-8-4 |last=Strom |first=Marc |title=Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

In this environment, security was not nearly as much a concern as it became after the bandwidth explosion of the 1990s. The rise in the number of people with access to the Internet, and by extension the number of people attempting to [[Hacker (computer security)|hack]] other people's [[Server (computing)|server]]s, made encrypted alternatives necessary.\n\nExperts in [[computer security]], such as [[SANS Institute]], recommend that the use of Telnet for remote logins should be discontinued under all normal circumstances, for the following reasons:\n\n* Telnet, by default, does not [[encryption|encrypt]] any data sent over the connection (including passwords), and so it is often feasible to eavesdrop on the communications and use the password later for malicious purposes; anybody who has access to a [[Router (computing)|router]], [[network switch|switch]], [[network hub|hub]] or [[Gateway (computer networking)|gateway]] located on the network between the two hosts where Telnet is being used can intercept the packets passing by and obtain login, password and whatever else is typed with a [[packet analyzer]].\n* Most implementations of Telnet have no authentication that would ensure communication is carried out between the two desired [[server (computing)|host]]s and not [[Man-in-the-middle attack|intercepted in the middle]].\n* Several [[vulnerability (computer science)|vulnerabilities]] have been discovered over the years in commonly used Telnet [[daemon (computer software)|daemon]]s.\n\nThese security-related shortcomings have seen the usage of the Telnet protocol drop rapidly,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Poulsen|first1=Kevin|title=Telnet, dead at 35...RIP|journal=Wired|date=2 April 2007|volume=April 2007|issue=2007-04|page=24|url=https://www.wired.com/2007/04/telnet_dead_at_/|accessdate=14 June 2017}}</ref> especially on the public [[Internet]], in favor of the [[Secure Shell]] (SSH) protocol, first released in 1995.

As has happened with other early Internet protocols, extensions to the Telnet protocol provide [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS) security and [[Simple Authentication and Security Layer]] (SASL) authentication that address the above concerns.  However, most Telnet implementations do not support these extensions; and there has been relatively little interest in implementing these as SSH is adequate for most purposes.\n\nIt is of note that there are a large number of industrial and scientific devices which have only Telnet available as a communication option.  Some are built with only a standard RS-232 port and use a serial server hardware appliance to provide the translation between the TCP/Telnet data and the RS-232 serial data.  In such cases, SSH is not an option unless the interface appliance can be configured for SSH.\n\nTelnet is still used by hobbyists, especially among [[Amateur radio]] operators.

The command to insert 0xff into the stream is 0xff, so 0xff must be escaped by doubling it when sending data over the telnet protocol.)\n\nSome use Telnet client applications to establish an interactive TCP session to a port other than the Telnet server port. Connections to such ports do not use IAC and all octets are sent to the server without interpretation. For example, a user could make an HTTP request by hand by using a [[Command-line_interface|command line]] version of the telnet client to a web server on TCP port 80 as follows:\n\n<source lang=\"console\">\n$ telnet www.example.com 80\nGET /path/to/file.html HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example.com\nConnection: close\n</source>\n\nHowever such services are implemented through ''network virtual terminal'' (NVT) rules and Telnet does not handle some of the other NVT requirements, such as the requirement for a bare carriage return character (CR, [[ASCII]] 13) to be followed by a NUL (ASCII 0) character.\n\nThere are other TCP terminal clients, such as [[netcat]] or [[socat]] on UNIX and [[PuTTY]] on Windows, which handle such requirements. Nevertheless, Telnet may still be used in [[debug]]ging network services such as [[SMTP]], [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], [[HTTP]], [[FTP]] or [[POP3]], to issue commands to a server and examine the responses.\n\n{{anchor|8-bit data}}Another difference between Telnet and other TCP terminal clients is that Telnet is not [[8-bit clean]] by default. 8-bit mode may be negotiated, but octets with the high bit set may be garbled until this mode is requested, as 7 bit is the default mode.

After they perform a cover of a famous song, the audience votes for their favorite performances and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The first version of the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, the series premiered on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and is hosted by [[Nick Cannon]]. \n\nThe show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to make guesses as to who the celebrities could be after each performance, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. They have received mixed reviews from critics, as have the series' format and production value. However, the costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team of two dozen people who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions into each costume that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\nExtensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from leaking before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349. It has been considered at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States due to its breakout success and has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] and [[Wayne Brady]], respectively. The series is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered as the [[Super Bowl LIV]] [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|lead-out program]] on February 2, 2020. During an interview prior to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Rob Wade, President of Alternative Entertainment and Specials at Fox, confirmed that future seasons of the show are planned.<ref name=\"TBI Apr 6\">{{cite web|last=Daswani|first=Mansha|title=Fox Entertainment's Rob Wade|url=https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|website=TV Formats|date=April 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200416012653/https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|archive-date=April 15, 2020|url-status=live|quote=And then ''The Masked Dancer'' is coming up soon.

The specific format of the competition varies by season and episode, depending on how many celebrities remain, but generally, each episode features four to six celebrities performing a cover of a famous song, with the audience voting for their favorite.

Television producer [[Craig Plestis]] explained that he first discovered the format during a visit to a small [[Los Angeles]] Thai restaurant in October 2017. While waiting for dinner, he observed the other patrons staring at a television while an episode of the [[The Mask Singer (season 3)|third season]] of the [[The Mask Singer (Thai TV series)|Thai version]] of the show was playing. Intrigued, Plestis began to research the series and secured the rights to produce an American adaptation within one week in a deal brokered by Steve Wohl of [[Paradigm Talent Agency]]. Plestis then called Fox executive Rob Wade on a Friday night telling him he needed to come in the following Monday and worked to create a showcase during the weekend.

Doyle cited the series as an example of a cultural shift in the United States away from the competitive and often exploitative nature of shows such as ''[[American Idol]]'' towards a higher level of positivity among reality television series.<ref>{{cite web|last=Doyle|first=John|author-link=John Doyle (critic)|title=Dumb simplicity: Why The Masked Singer is a massive TV hit|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/article-dumb-simplicity-why-the-masked-singer-is-a-massive-tv-hit/|website=[[The Globe and Mail]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191218163655/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/article-dumb-simplicity-why-the-masked-singer-is-a-massive-tv-hit/|archive-date=December 18, 2019|date=November 4, 2019|url-status=live|url-access=subscription}}</ref> Likewise, Daniel D'Addario of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described the show as relaxing and refreshing, calling it a return to form for television as the series possesses the now-rare ability to uplift and unite people.

The revivals of ''[[Paradise Hotel]]'' and ''[[Temptation Island (TV series)|Temptation Island]]'' by Fox and [[USA Network]], respectively, have been credited to the show's success, as have the American adaptations of ''[[Love Island (American TV series)|Love Island]]'' and ''[[I Can See Your Voice (American game show)|I Can See Your Voice]]''.<ref name=\"VAR Feb 19\"/> The show has also been credited with reinvigorating the costume genre of television.

After they perform a cover of a famous song, the audience votes for their favorite performances and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The first version of the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, the series premiered on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and is hosted by [[Nick Cannon]]. \n\nThe show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to make guesses as to who the celebrities could be after each performance, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. They have received mixed reviews from critics, as have the series' format and production value. However, the costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team of two dozen people who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions into each costume that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\nExtensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from leaking before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349. It has been considered at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States due to its breakout success and has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] and [[Wayne Brady]], respectively. The series is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered as the [[Super Bowl LIV]] [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|lead-out program]] on February 2, 2020. During an interview prior to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Rob Wade, President of Alternative Entertainment and Specials at Fox, confirmed that future seasons of the show are planned.<ref name=\"TBI Apr 6\">{{cite web|last=Daswani|first=Mansha|title=Fox Entertainment's Rob Wade|url=https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|website=TV Formats|date=April 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200416012653/https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|archive-date=April 15, 2020|url-status=live|quote=And then ''The Masked Dancer'' is coming up soon.

The specific format of the competition varies by season and episode, depending on how many celebrities remain, but generally, each episode features four to six celebrities performing a cover of a famous song, with the audience voting for their favorite.

Television producer [[Craig Plestis]] explained that he first discovered the format during a visit to a small [[Los Angeles]] Thai restaurant in October 2017. While waiting for dinner, he observed the other patrons staring at a television while an episode of the [[The Mask Singer (season 3)|third season]] of the [[The Mask Singer (Thai TV series)|Thai version]] of the show was playing. Intrigued, Plestis began to research the series and secured the rights to produce an American adaptation within one week in a deal brokered by Steve Wohl of [[Paradigm Talent Agency]]. Plestis then called Fox executive Rob Wade on a Friday night telling him he needed to come in the following Monday and worked to create a showcase during the weekend. After successfully pitching the show to Wade, the series began development in November,<ref name=\"TVF Apr 2019\"/><ref name=\"THR Jan 2\">{{cite web|last=Bentley|first=Jean|title=''The Masked Singer'': How the Fox Reality Show Scored Top Talent (and Kept It Secret)|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/masked-singer-ep-explains-how-his-insane-reality-competition-made-it-air-1171775|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=January 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190713155810/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/masked-singer-ep-explains-how-his-insane-reality-competition-made-it-air-1171775|archive-date=July 13, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=White|first=Peter|url=https://deadline.com/2017/11/fox-remaking-asian-singing-contest-the-masked-singer-1202206986/|title=Fox Developing Remake of Asian Talent Competition ''The Masked Singer''|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=November 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190521062138/https://deadline.com/2017/11/fox-remaking-asian-singing-contest-the-masked-singer-1202206986/|archive-date=May 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"TBI Apr 5\">{{cite web|last=Ravindran|first=Manori|title=How ''Masked Singer'' is reviving costume-led formats|url=https://tbivision.com/2019/04/05/costume-drama/|website=Television Business International|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190407120916/https://tbivision.com/2019/04/05/costume-drama/|archive-date=April 7, 2019|date=April 5, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> and was officially ordered by Fox in August 2018.<ref name=\"VAR Aug 2\"/>\n\n[[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation]], the rightsholder of the ''Masked Singer'' format, lacked the ability to produce the series.

Regarding the panelists, she said the production team was less concerned with selecting those with an ability to critique participants' singing abilities than being able to create a comedic tone for the show as one of their goals was to reassure celebrities they would not be ridiculed for choosing to appear. Jeong was the first panelist to be signed on to the series due to his humour and pre-existing knowledge of the South Korean version, followed by McCarthy Wahlberg, Thicke, and Scherzinger.<ref name=\"E!

By 1858 the site was located between two warfs (Rees & Tinnings Warf). As land was expanded southward, it remained under Government control as possible locations of various Union Station expansions.  The majority of the land was still part of the lake up until the early 1900's. By 1925 The northern parcel of the property was turned into of Bayside Park, which had been part of an early proposal that was to have seen the lands south of the rail corridor transformed into an extensive lakeside park that followed today's Esplande. The remaining land was most likely under the control of Central Harbor Terminals<ref>https://maps.library.utoronto.ca/dvhmp/maps.html</ref>.\n\nIn the 1930s the property became the proposed home to [[Canada Post]]'s Toronto Postal Delivery Building.  In the 1920's a postal handling facility already existed in the east wing of the city's then New Union Station (Downtown Toronto's 3rd major train station)<ref>{{cite book |last=Filey |first=Mike |author-link= |date=1992 |title=A Toronto Album 2: More Glimpses of the City That Was|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=K0tIsZ_TAIoC&pg=PA43 |location=Toronto |publisher=Dundurn Press |page=43 |isbn=}}</ref>.

Modifications were made to the building to be more adequately equipped for postal delivery, after it was altered by the Department of National Defence.  After the refurbishment work was completed in 1948, the building now possessed the capability and equipment for proper mail sorting and other mailing functions. Though it was designed as a mail sorting warehouse it was also the home of Postal Station \"A\" which served mostly institutional & commercial clients.  The Ground floor was where the mail was dropped off by both railway carts and postal vans. Unsorted mail was moved by conveyor belts to the top floor and via gravity fed mail chutes sorted by size & destination.  Eventually the sorted mail would end up back on the ground floor where it would be sent out for delivery<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://torontoplaques.com/Pages/Toronto_Postal_Delivery_Building.html|title=History|language=en|access-date=April 16, 2020</ref>.

In a cost cutting move (part of larger overall service changes & cuts made to the Crown Corporation under the [[Brian Mulroney]] Conservatives), Canada Post decided to close the facility and move operations to an alternate more modern c.1970s letter processing faculty on nearby Eastern Avenue. A structure with easy access to highways was designed specificity for transport truck delivery of mail. By 1989, all of the old building's work was transferred here.<ref name=\":0\" />. The 1980s real estate boom saw the building site become surrounded by skyscrapers, hotels, convention centres, SkyDome stadium & condo towers.  In the early 1990s, real estate developers [[Bramalea (company)|Bramalea Ltd]] and [[Trizec Properties|Trizec]] arranged to purchase the building from Canada Post, and redevelop the site into a {{convert|230,000|m2|sqft|adj=on}} office, retail and residential space. Financial and development details of the purchase imposed various conditions prior to development, including rezoning by the city, remediation of soil contamination by Canada Post.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bramalea's Moves Shake Taxpayers|first=Stevie|last=Cameron|date=November 15, 1992|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\nDue to financial difficulties, the building's ownership was returned to Canada Post in 1993 and remained abandoned. The Toronto Raptors purchased the unused building from Canada Post the following year.<ref name=\"rapnba\">{{cite web| url=http://www.nba.com/raptors/history/raptors_history.html/| title=Laying the Groundwork for the NBA in Toronto| website=nba.com| accessdate=October 14, 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:Postal terminal now Air Canada Centre.jpg|thumb|left|The arena retains the eastern & southern walls of the original postal structure built, through a process of [[facadism]].]]\nConstruction of the arena was started by the Toronto Raptors, under their initial ownership group headed by Canadian businessman [[John Bitove]]. In 1995, it had been decided that the NBA would expand into Canada. The Toronto Raptors were created and would need an indoor arena to play in. The Canada Post building was chosen to be the new home of the Raptors due to its downtown location and lot size. Other venues such as [[Exhibition Place]], North York Centre, Bay and Wellesley, and Bay and Dundas were also considered.

The building retained the [[Art Deco]] Queenston limestone facade of the Toronto Postal Delivery Building along the east (along [[Bay Street]]) and south ([[Lake Shore Boulevard]]) walls of that structure, but the rest of the building (facing [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]]) was removed to make room for the arena, through the process of [[facadism]]. The original building is protected under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.\n\n====Arena 'Wars'====\nWhen MLGL ([[Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment|Maple Leaf Gardens, Limited]] at the time the controlling company of the Toronto Maple Leafs) lost out on their desire to be the franchise owners of the Raptors, competition between the two organizations heated up centred around venues. MLGL declined to allow Maple Leaf Gardens to be used for the NBA upstart as a result pushing Bitove to secure rights to have the Raptors' opening seasons played at SkyDome until construction of the new stadium to be complete.\n\nThe 1930s-era Maple Leaf Gardens was showing its age; the Maple Leafs in desperate desire for a new facility began developing plans for building an all-new stadium with one of the key criteria for the new location that it must be within close walking proximity to both the subway system and GO Transit. During the early stages of construction, MLGL floated to the media plans for their own plans to build a competing single-use stadium on adjacent property just to the north of the stadium atop the train sheds at Union Station (similar to how [[Madison Square Garden]] was constructed) as the new home for the Toronto Maple Leafs.<ref name=ArenaWars>{{cite news|title=Leafs ready to Move (Page 2)|first=Craig|last=Daniels|date=April 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Toronto Sun]]}}</ref> The reaction from Raptors was nothing but anger. \"This proposed (Maple Leaf) location really disturbs us\" stated team president Richard Peddie, who went on to say that they would fight the Leafs \"every step of the way\" and he didn't understand why the Leafs have refused to join with the Raptors at their site; claiming that the Leafs want to \"build virtually on top of us\".<ref name=\"ArenaWars\" /> The major problem of the Union Station proposal is the land that the stadium would be built on was actually City of Toronto land that was leased out to CN Rail and CP Rail, which were in a major, long-standing dispute over rent payments (dating back to 1969). As a result, MLGL offered the city $156 Million (1997 CAD) in cash & assets to settle any and all outstanding claims and to buy the air rights above the Union Station train platforms.\n\nDuring this period John Bitove who disputed over the future of the arena who as a result of a [[shotgun clause]] was forced to sell his stake to Allan Slaight (who wanted a joint arena deal with MLGL) and now with majority ownership immediately went into talks with MLGL which eventually purchased both the Raptors and their partially completed arena, which subsequently resulted in major modifications to the original design, which was basketball-specific, to make the arena become more suitable for hockey. Originally planned to cost $217&nbsp;million, MLGL increased the budget to $265&nbsp;million after taking control.<ref name=cost>{{cite news|title=Upgrades added to cost|first=David|last=Shoalts|date=February 17, 1999|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> The Raptors were twice fined a million dollars (which were donated to their charitable foundation) by the NBA for missing deadlines to begin construction of their new arena.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors' arena bites dust|last=Christe|first=James|date=May 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\n====Construction==== \nAfter the purchase of the Raptors and the Air Canada Centre the new owners entered into a design-build contract with PCL with the commitment to finish the stadium in 24-months by March 1st 1999<ref>https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/projects/2017/03/pcl-construction-reflects-on-building-the-air-canada-centre-1022273w</ref>.

The Raptors had attempted to play the April 19 match at Maple Leaf Gardens, but were unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors Move Final Game to Hamilton|date=January 7, 1998|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://www.apnews.com/7027ff09054e45b3b7471205f12cb521}}</ref>\n[[File:Air Canada Centre in 1999.jpg|thumb|right|Air Canada Centre in July 1999, five months after the arena opened]]\n\nOn December 30th 1998, the building's construction was completed, 9 days ahead of schedule.

This boosted Toronto's economy and led to further construction in the downtown core. Many projects in the area were completed ahead of schedule as a result of a desire to increase the infrastructure of downtown Toronto, and also from private funding (approximately $13&nbsp;million) that was invested in seeing the economic growth of Toronto.

Infill of the inner harbour began in the 1850's and accelerated with the arrival of the railroad resulting in the current day shape of downtown <ref>https://www.cgenarchive.org/toronto-lakeshores.html</ref>.  By 1858 the site was located between two warfs (Rees & Tinnings Warf). As land was expanded southward, it remained under Government control as possible locations of various Union Station expansions.  The majority of the land was still part of the lake up until the early 1900's. By 1925 The northern parcel of the property was turned into of Bayside Park, which had been part of an early proposal that was to have seen the lands south of the rail corridor transformed into an extensive lakeside park that followed today's Esplande. The remaining land was most likely under the control of Central Harbor Terminals<ref>https://maps.library.utoronto.ca/dvhmp/maps.html</ref>.\n\nIn the 1930s the property became the proposed home to [[Canada Post]]'s Toronto Postal Delivery Building.  In the 1920's a postal handling facility already existed in the east wing of the city's then New Union Station (Downtown Toronto's 3rd major train station)<ref>{{cite book |last=Filey |first=Mike |author-link= |date=1992 |title=A Toronto Album 2: More Glimpses of the City That Was|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=K0tIsZ_TAIoC&pg=PA43 |location=Toronto |publisher=Dundurn Press |page=43 |isbn=}}</ref>.

Modifications were made to the building to be more adequately equipped for postal delivery, after it was altered by the Department of National Defence.  After the refurbishment work was completed in 1948, the building now possessed the capability and equipment for proper mail sorting and other mailing functions. Though it was designed as a mail sorting warehouse it was also the home of Postal Station \"A\" which served mostly institutional & commercial clients.  The Ground floor was where the mail was dropped off by both railway carts and postal vans. Unsorted mail was moved by conveyor belts to the top floor and via gravity fed mail chutes sorted by size & destination.  Eventually the sorted mail would end up back on the ground floor where it would be sent out for delivery<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://torontoplaques.com/Pages/Toronto_Postal_Delivery_Building.html|title=History|language=en|access-date=April 16, 2020</ref>.

The sculptors son Louis Temporale jr. helped with restoration efforts in 1998 and in 2016 was still critical of the lack of protection of the artwork by stadium ownership for over 20 years.

In a cost cutting move (part of larger overall service changes & cuts made to the Crown Corporation under the [[Brian Mulroney]] Conservatives), Canada Post decided to close the facility and move operations to an alternate more modern c.1970s letter processing faculty on nearby Eastern Avenue. A structure with easy access to highways was designed specificity for transport truck delivery of mail. By 1989, all of the old building's work was transferred here.<ref name=\":0\" />. The 1980s real estate boom saw the building site become surrounded by skyscrapers, hotels, convention centres, SkyDome stadium & condo towers.  In the early 1990s, real estate developers [[Bramalea (company)|Bramalea Ltd]] and [[Trizec Properties|Trizec]] arranged to purchase the building from Canada Post, and redevelop the site into a {{convert|230,000|m2|sqft|adj=on}} office, retail and residential space. Financial and development details of the purchase imposed various conditions prior to development, including rezoning by the city, remediation of soil contamination by Canada Post.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bramalea's Moves Shake Taxpayers|first=Stevie|last=Cameron|date=November 15, 1992|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\nDue to financial difficulties, the building's ownership was returned to Canada Post in 1993 and remained abandoned.

In 1995, it had been decided that the NBA would expand into Canada. The Toronto Raptors were created and would need an indoor arena to play in. The Canada Post building was chosen to be the new home of the Raptors due to its downtown location and lot size. Other venues such as [[Exhibition Place]], North York Centre, Bay and Wellesley, and Bay and Dundas were also considered.

The building retained the [[Art Deco]] Queenston limestone facade of the Toronto Postal Delivery Building along the east (along [[Bay Street]]) and south ([[Lake Shore Boulevard]]) walls of that structure, but the rest of the building (facing [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]]) was removed to make room for the arena, through the process of [[facadism]]. The original building is protected under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.\n\n====Arena 'Wars'====\nWhen MLGL ([[Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment|Maple Leaf Gardens, Limited]] at the time the controlling company of the Toronto Maple Leafs) lost out on their desire to be the franchise owners of the Raptors, competition between the two organizations heated up centred around venues. MLGL declined to allow Maple Leaf Gardens to be used for the NBA upstart as a result pushing Bitove to secure rights to have the Raptors' opening seasons played at SkyDome until construction of the new stadium to be complete.\n\nThe 1930s-era Maple Leaf Gardens was showing its age; the Maple Leafs in desperate desire for a new facility began developing plans for building an all-new stadium with one of the key criteria for the new location that it must be within close walking proximity to both the subway system and GO Transit. During the early stages of construction, MLGL floated to the media plans for their own plans to build a competing single-use stadium on adjacent property just to the north of the stadium atop the train sheds at Union Station (similar to how [[Madison Square Garden]] was constructed) as the new home for the Toronto Maple Leafs.<ref name=ArenaWars>{{cite news|title=Leafs ready to Move (Page 2)|first=Craig|last=Daniels|date=April 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Toronto Sun]]}}</ref> The reaction from Raptors was nothing but anger. \"This proposed (Maple Leaf) location really disturbs us\" stated team president Richard Peddie, who went on to say that they would fight the Leafs \"every step of the way\" and he didn't understand why the Leafs have refused to join with the Raptors at their site; claiming that the Leafs want to \"build virtually on top of us\".<ref name=\"ArenaWars\" /> The major problem of the Union Station proposal is the land that the stadium would be built on was actually City of Toronto land that was leased out to CN Rail and CP Rail, which were in a major, long-standing dispute over rent payments (dating back to 1969). As a result, MLGL offered the city $156 Million (1997 CAD) in cash & assets to settle any and all outstanding claims and to buy the air rights above the Union Station train platforms.\n\nDuring this period John Bitove who disputed over the future of the arena who as a result of a [[shotgun clause]] was forced to sell his stake to Allan Slaight (who wanted a joint arena deal with MLGL) and now with majority ownership immediately went into talks with MLGL which eventually purchased both the Raptors and their partially completed arena, which subsequently resulted in major modifications to the original design, which was basketball-specific, to make the arena become more suitable for hockey. Originally planned to cost $217&nbsp;million, MLGL increased the budget to $265&nbsp;million after taking control.<ref name=cost>{{cite news|title=Upgrades added to cost|first=David|last=Shoalts|date=February 17, 1999|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> The Raptors were twice fined a million dollars (which were donated to their charitable foundation) by the NBA for missing deadlines to begin construction of their new arena.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors' arena bites dust|last=Christe|first=James|date=May 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\n====Construction==== \nAfter the purchase of the Raptors and the Air Canada Centre the new owners entered into a design-build contract with PCL with the commitment to finish the stadium in 24-months by March 1st 1999<ref>https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/projects/2017/03/pcl-construction-reflects-on-building-the-air-canada-centre-1022273w</ref>.

The story follows a group of sorority sisters who receive threatening phone calls and are eventually stalked and murdered by a deranged killer during the [[Christmas]] season. It is the first film in the [[Black Christmas (film series)|''Black Christmas'' series]].\n\nInspired by the urban legend \"[[The babysitter and the man upstairs]]\" and a series of murders that took place in the [[Westmount, Quebec|Westmount section]] of [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Moore wrote the screenplay under the title ''Stop Me''. The filmmakers made numerous alterations to the script, primarily the shifting to a university setting with young adult characters. It was shot in Toronto in 1974 on an estimated budget of $620,000, and was distributed by [[Warner Bros.]] in North America.\n\n''Black Christmas'' was released on October 11, 1974, in Canada and December 20 in the United States under the title '''''Silent Night, Evil Night'''''.

One of the girls, Jess, answers an obscene phone call from a mentally unstable man who is implied to call the house regularly. She summons her fellow students into the room, where they listen as the caller screams and curses them on the phone. When one of the girls, foul-mouthed Barb, takes the phone from Jess, she incites the caller, who in turn promises to kill her. Barb argues with a younger student, Clare Harrison, who implies that the caller could be a serial rapist, before Clare returns to her bedroom to finish packing for Christmas break. The disoriented man lures Clare into her closet, where he suffocates her with a plastic dress bag. He moves her body to the attic.\n\nThe following morning, Mr. Harrison arrives at the school to pick up his daughter, but she fails to show up to their agreed meeting place. He quickly makes his way to the sorority house, where the housemother, Mrs. MacHenry, is surprised by Clare's absence. Meanwhile, Jess meets her boyfriend, Peter, a neurotic music student. She explains she is pregnant and planning to get an abortion, angering Peter, who attempts to intimidate her. In town, Mr. Harrison, accompanied by Barb and one of the other girls, Phyllis Carlson, attempt to report Clare as missing, while Jess quickly tells Clare's boyfriend Chris about Clare's sudden disappearance. They learn that another local girl named Janis Quaife has also seemingly vanished while walking home from school.\n\nAfter putting a drunken Barb to bed, Mr. Harrison, Chris, Jess, and Phyllis help search for Janis in a nearby park where she allegedly disappeared, hoping to turn up some sign of Clare. Meanwhile, Mrs. Mac plans to leave for her sister's home, only to be lured up into the attic, where she discovers Clare's body. The killer throws a crane hook into her face, hanging and killing her. In the park, Janis's disfigured body is found by the police and Jess returns home, while the search continues for Clare. Jess answers another obscene phone call and decides to file a report with the police, only for Peter to appear and surprise her. He attempts to persuade her into marriage for the sake of their child, but Jess adamantly refuses. Peter leaves in an emotional state, while Lieutenant Kenneth Fuller arrives to bug the telephone.\n\nA group of choir children arrive on the house's stoop to sing Christmas carols, distracting Jess. The killer enters Barb's room and murders her with a glass figurine; Barb's cries for help are drowned out by the singing children. One of the women in charge of the children ushers them away, having learned of Janis's murder. Jess experiences another unnerving phone call, in which the caller restates part of her argument with Peter. Lieutenant Fuller theorizes that Peter could be responsible, due to the caller's knowledge of the argument and his own mental fragility, but Jess doubts this. Moments later, Phyllis enters Barb's room and is ambushed by the killer, who murders her off-screen.\n\nJess gets another obscene phone call, in which the killer alludes to some sort of transgression between two children named Agnes and Billy. The call is long enough to be traced by Graham, a telephone company employee, and Sergeant Nash instructs Jess to leave the house immediately, as the calls have been traced to be coming from within the house. Concerned for Barb and Phyllis, Jess arms herself with a poker and ventures upstairs, where she discovers Barb and Phyllis's maimed figures. The killer appears and pursues Jess through the house; Jess locks herself in the cellar, only for Peter to appear outside one of the windows. He smashes the window to get to Jess, who proceeds to bludgeon him with the poker, assuming he is the killer.\n\nThe police arrive moments later, alerted by Jess's screams. They discover her barely conscious in the basement, with Peter's bloody remains next to her. They put Jess to bed and discuss the murders, unaware of the bodies of Clare and Mrs. MacHenry still in the attic. Jess is left in the house to rest, with a policeman standing outside. The killer climbs down from the attic as Jess sleeps in a nearby room. The house's telephone begins to ring, leaving Jess's fate unknown as the credits roll.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Olivia Hussey]] as Jess Bradford\n* [[Keir Dullea]] as Peter Smythe\n* [[Margot Kidder]] as Barbara \"Barb\" Coard\n* [[John Saxon]] as Lt.

He accepted, and had to arrive in Toronto from New York City within two days to begin shooting.<ref name=onscreen/> For the role of the film's antagonist, Italian-American actor [[Nick Mancuso]] was cast as one of the main voices in the phone call sequences. When [[audition]]ing for the role, director Clark had Mancuso sit in a chair facing away from him, so as not to see the actor's face. Clark then had Mancuso experiment with different voices in order to come up with one that was right for the character, with Clark later offering him the part.<ref name=\"Power2019\"/>\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Harthouse night.jpg|thumb|upright=1|left|[[Soldiers' Tower]] at the [[University of Toronto]] is featured in the film]]\n''Black Christmas'' was shot on location in [[Toronto]] in the winter of 1973\u201374.

According to Griffin, her character's surprise as the killer lunges from the closet was genuine as the actress later recalled: \"it was a total shock because I didn't really know when to expect him to jump out!\" Shots of Clare's corpse in the rocking chair required the actress to wear an actual plastic bag over her head for extended periods of time. Griffin would also state that these scenes came relatively easy for her, \"I was actually, and still am, a fairly good swimmer so I could hold my breath for a long time.

However, Clark insisted on keeping the ending ambiguous.

Roy Moore. It stars [[Olivia Hussey]], [[Keir Dullea]], [[Margot Kidder]], [[Andrea Martin]], Marian Waldman, [[Lynne Griffin]] and [[John Saxon]]. The story follows a group of sorority sisters who receive threatening phone calls and are eventually stalked and murdered by a deranged killer during the [[Christmas]] season. It is the first film in the [[Black Christmas (film series)|''Black Christmas'' series]].\n\nInspired by the urban legend \"[[The babysitter and the man upstairs]]\" and a series of murders that took place in the [[Westmount, Quebec|Westmount section]] of [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Moore wrote the screenplay under the title ''Stop Me''. The filmmakers made numerous alterations to the script, primarily the shifting to a university setting with young adult characters. It was shot in Toronto in 1974 on an estimated budget of $620,000, and was distributed by [[Warner Bros.]] in North America.\n\n''Black Christmas'' was released on October 11, 1974, in Canada and December 20 in the United States under the title '''''Silent Night, Evil Night'''''. Upon its release, the film received mixed reviews, but it has since received critical re-appraisal, with film historians noting it for being one of the earliest slasher films.<ref>{{Cite book |author= Paszylx, Bart\u0142omiej |title=The Pleasure and Pain of Cult Horror Films: An Historical Survey |year=2009 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-786-43695-8 |pages=135\u20136}}</ref> It is also praised for concluding without revealing the identity of its villain, as well as serving as an influence on [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978).

One of the girls, Jess, answers an obscene phone call from a mentally unstable man who is implied to call the house regularly. She summons her fellow students into the room, where they listen as the caller screams and curses them on the phone. When one of the girls, foul-mouthed Barb, takes the phone from Jess, she incites the caller, who in turn promises to kill her. Barb argues with a younger student, Clare Harrison, who implies that the caller could be a serial rapist, before Clare returns to her bedroom to finish packing for Christmas break. The disoriented man lures Clare into her closet, where he suffocates her with a plastic dress bag. He moves her body to the attic.\n\nThe following morning, Mr. Harrison arrives at the school to pick up his daughter, but she fails to show up to their agreed meeting place. He quickly makes his way to the sorority house, where the housemother, Mrs. MacHenry, is surprised by Clare's absence. Meanwhile, Jess meets her boyfriend, Peter, a neurotic music student. She explains she is pregnant and planning to get an abortion, angering Peter, who attempts to intimidate her. In town, Mr. Harrison, accompanied by Barb and one of the other girls, Phyllis Carlson, attempt to report Clare as missing, while Jess quickly tells Clare's boyfriend Chris about Clare's sudden disappearance. They learn that another local girl named Janis Quaife has also seemingly vanished while walking home from school.\n\nAfter putting a drunken Barb to bed, Mr. Harrison, Chris, Jess, and Phyllis help search for Janis in a nearby park where she allegedly disappeared, hoping to turn up some sign of Clare. Meanwhile, Mrs. Mac plans to leave for her sister's home, only to be lured up into the attic, where she discovers Clare's body. The killer throws a crane hook into her face, hanging and killing her. In the park, Janis's disfigured body is found by the police and Jess returns home, while the search continues for Clare. Jess answers another obscene phone call and decides to file a report with the police, only for Peter to appear and surprise her. He attempts to persuade her into marriage for the sake of their child, but Jess adamantly refuses. Peter leaves in an emotional state, while Lieutenant Kenneth Fuller arrives to bug the telephone.\n\nA group of choir children arrive on the house's stoop to sing Christmas carols, distracting Jess. The killer enters Barb's room and murders her with a glass figurine; Barb's cries for help are drowned out by the singing children. One of the women in charge of the children ushers them away, having learned of Janis's murder. Jess experiences another unnerving phone call, in which the caller restates part of her argument with Peter. Lieutenant Fuller theorizes that Peter could be responsible, due to the caller's knowledge of the argument and his own mental fragility, but Jess doubts this. Moments later, Phyllis enters Barb's room and is ambushed by the killer, who murders her off-screen.\n\nJess gets another obscene phone call, in which the killer alludes to some sort of transgression between two children named Agnes and Billy. The call is long enough to be traced by Graham, a telephone company employee, and Sergeant Nash instructs Jess to leave the house immediately, as the calls have been traced to be coming from within the house. Concerned for Barb and Phyllis, Jess arms herself with a poker and ventures upstairs, where she discovers Barb and Phyllis's maimed figures. The killer appears and pursues Jess through the house; Jess locks herself in the cellar, only for Peter to appear outside one of the windows. He smashes the window to get to Jess, who proceeds to bludgeon him with the poker, assuming he is the killer.\n\nThe police arrive moments later, alerted by Jess's screams. They discover her barely conscious in the basement, with Peter's bloody remains next to her. They put Jess to bed and discuss the murders, unaware of the bodies of Clare and Mrs. MacHenry still in the attic. Jess is left in the house to rest, with a policeman standing outside. The killer climbs down from the attic as Jess sleeps in a nearby room.

When [[audition]]ing for the role, director Clark had Mancuso sit in a chair facing away from him, so as not to see the actor's face.

According to Griffin, her character's surprise as the killer lunges from the closet was genuine as the actress later recalled: \"it was a total shock because I didn't really know when to expect him to jump out!\" Shots of Clare's corpse in the rocking chair required the actress to wear an actual plastic bag over her head for extended periods of time. Griffin would also state that these scenes came relatively easy for her, \"I was actually, and still am, a fairly good swimmer so I could hold my breath for a long time.
