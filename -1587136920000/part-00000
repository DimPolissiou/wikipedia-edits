He listed the requirements on a sheet of paper. Wahlforss called the Hietalahti shipyard manager Eric Holmstr\u00f6m and the company's icebreaker specialist Ernst B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m to a meeting asking: \"Are we able to construct such a ship?\" B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m answered directly: \"Yes, we are.\" Subsequently, B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m made a 1:500-scaled sketch of the new 22,000-hp icebreaker in relation to Kapitan-class. Wahlforss took the drawing with him in 1954 to a meeting in Moscow where he had dinner with Mikoyan. When Mikoyan opened the discussion about the new icebreaker concept, Wahlforss took the drawing from his suitcase asking \"Is this what you need?\". Mikoyan became very delighted and said: \"For three years I have asked from our own shipyards for possibility to construct such a icebreaker, but I have only got headshaking!\"<ref name=\"Zilliacus: s.283-295\">{{cite book |last=Zilliacus |first=Benedict |year=1984 |chapter= \u00bbSeitsem\u00e4ntoista sanaa\u00bb |title=Wilhelm Wahlforss |language=Finnish |others=Translated from Swedish by Riitta Valaj\u00e4rvi |location=Porvoo |publisher=Oy W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Ab |pages=283\u2013295 |isbn=951-99541-8-X }}</ref>\n\nOn 24 May 1956, W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 and [[Sudoimport]], the Soviet foreign trade organization with a monopoly for the foreign trade of ships, signed a shipbuilding contract for the construction of two polar icebreakers. While only half as powerful as the 44,000{{nbsp}}hp ''Lenin'', the new icebreakers featured the most powerful diesel-electric power plant ever installed on a ship at the time.<ref name=\"wartsila\"/> The Soviet negotiators had additional requirements for deep draught and fuel consumption, which Wahlforss promised W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 to reach. In practice, the demands put the company's engineering expertise to a tough test. At the end, however, W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 could deliver what Wahlforss had promised. Few years later, W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 received a follow-up order for three more icebreakers of the same design.<ref name=\"Zilliacus: s.283-295\"/>\n\nThe hull of the icebreaker was assembled on a [[slipway]] and launched on 10 January 1959. Prior to this, the harbor basin and the entrance channel had to be [[dredging|dredged]]. In addition, a special steel pontoon had to be constructed and welded to the stern of the icebreaker in order to reduce stresses and allow safe launching of the heavy ice-strengthened hull.<ref name=\"wartsila\" /> In the [[Ceremonial ship launching|launching ceremony]], the new icebreaker was given the name ''Moskva'' after [[Moscow|the capital city]]. The later icebreakers of the series were also named after the largest cities of the Soviet Union. The construction of the vessel continued in the outfitting quay and ''Moskva'' was delivered during the summer of 1960.<ref name=\"wartsila\" />\n\n== Service history ==\n\nIn October 1961, after assisting more than a hundred cargo ships in the Russian Arctic during the autumn navigating season, ''Moskva'' completed an eastbound transit of the Northern Sea Route from [[Murmansk]] to [[Vladivostok]] in only 10 days. This was both a record time as well as the latest time a successful transit had been completed before the winter, and demonstrated how the shipping season could be extended with modern icebreakers.<ref name=\"polarpost\" /> Afterwards, ''Moskva'' was stationed in [[Vladivostok]] and used to escort in the eastern part of the Northern Sea Route.<ref name=\"thesovietarctic\" />\n\nOn 20 October 1965, ''Moskva'' and her sister ship [[Leningrad (icebreaker)|''Leningrad'']] came to assist ''Vitimles'', a merchant ship that had been waiting for icebreaker assistance for 30 days in the [[East Siberian Sea]].<ref name=\"marchenko\">{{cite book |last=Marchenko |first=Nataliya |year=2012 |title=Russian Arctic Seas |url= |location= |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-642-22124-8 |accessdate= }}</ref> However, by the time the icebreakers arrived, the pack ice had begun to drift at a considerable speed and a dangerous phenomenon known as \"ice jet\" appeared,<ref>Weintrit, A. and Neumann, T.

At the widest point of the hull, the vessel had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|24.50|m|ft|0}}, but due to the sloping sides the maximum beam at waterline was slightly less, {{convert|23.50|m|ft|0}}. At design waterline, the icebreaker drew {{convert|9.5|m|ft|0}} of water and had a displacement of 13,290 tonnes. However, the maximum draught of the vessel was {{convert|10.5|m|ft|0}}, corresponding to a maximum displacement of 15,360 tonnes. ''Moskva'' was the largest non-nuclear icebreaker in the world at the time of the delivery,<ref name=\"wartsila\" /> having almost twice the displacement of the largest western icebreakers.\n\nDesigned to withstand the compression of the polar pack ice, the fully welded steel hull of ''Moskva'' was very strong. The {{convert|6|m|ft|adj=on}} wide ice belt, where the hull plating was over {{convert|50|mm|in}} thick in the bow, was designed to withstand ice pressures of up to 1,000 tonnes per square meter (about {{convert|9.81|MPa|psi|-2|abbr=on|disp=out}}), more than 30 to 60 times as much as normal merchant ships at the time. In bow and stern, the web frames were aligned perpendicularly to the shell plating. Longitudinally, the hull was divided into nine watertight compartments and the vessel had a full-length double hull below tweendeck.<ref name=\"wartsila\" />\n\n''Moskva'' had single and double cabins for 109 persons. In addition to vessel crew and aviation detachment, accommodation and laboratories were reserved for scientists when the icebreaker carried out research expeditions in the polar waters. Special attention had been paid to the furnishing and decoration of the public spaces, which included a game room and a music room with a piano for the officers. The icebreaker was delivered from the shipyard with a total of three television sets.<ref name=\"wartsila\" />\n\nDesigned to escort merchant ships through ice-covered waters, ''Moskva'' had a towing winch and a notch in the stern where the bow of the towed ship would be pulled. For ice reconnaissance, the icebreaker had a helicopter hangar and a landing platform in the stern. The vessel had two motor lifeboats for 60 persons and two 70-person lifeboats with manually operated propeller. In addition, the icebreaker carried a {{convert|11.5|m|ft|0|adj=on}} motor [[launch (boat)|launch]] with a steel hull, a {{convert|9|m|ft|adj=on}} aluminum boat, two fiberglass ice sledge-boats, a {{convert|4.5|m|ft|0|adj=on}} rowing boat and a light aluminum dinghy. The boats were launched using the icebreakers' two 10-ton deck cranes.<ref name=\"wartsila\" />\n\n=== Power and propulsion ===\n\n''Moskva'' was a diesel-electric icebreaker with a power plant consisting of eight [[straight-nine engine|9-cylinder]] W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4-Sulzer 9MH51 single-acting [[two-stroke]] [[diesel engines]], each of which was rated at 3,250{{nbsp}}hp in continuous operation but capable of 10% overload for one hour at a time. The main engines were directly coupled to [[Siemens]] [[direct current|direct current (DC)]] generators that supplied electricity to propulsion motors through an applied [[Ward Leonard control|Ward Leonard drive system]]. Normally, four generators were connected to the tandem electric motor driving the centerline propeller shaft and two generators to the propulsion motors driving the wing shafts, but the system allowed connecting two generators from the center circuit to either port or starboard circuit and vice versa in case of engine failure.<ref name=\"wartsila\" />\n\nThe electric power produced by the main engines and generators was transformed into propeller thrust by three large DC motors coupled to the propeller shafts. The centerline propulsion motor, located in a separate compartment, was a tandem unit consisting of two 5,500{{nbsp}}hp motors while the port and starboard propulsion motors, located side by side in the same compartment, were rated at 5,500{{nbsp}}hp each. While the nominal speed of the propulsion motors was 115 rpm, full power was available at all revolution speeds between 110 and 150 rpm. The four-blade propellers were of fixed pitch type with the centerline propeller, which had twice the propulsion power of the wing shafts, having greater diameter than the port and starboard propellers. The icebreaker had a single centerline rudder.<ref name=\"wartsila\" />\n\nWith an overall propulsion power of 22,000{{nbsp}}hp, ''Moskva'' was at the time the most powerful diesel-electric icebreaker in the world. She was second only to the nuclear-powered ''Lenin'' which, at 44,000{{nbsp}}hp, had twice the power of the ''Moskva''-class icebreakers.<ref name=\"wartsila\" /> While the most powerful western icebreaker at the time, the 1955-built [[USS Glacier (AGB-4)|USS ''Glacier'']], had two propulsion motors rated at 10,500{{nbsp}}hp each and was thus nearly as powerful as ''Moskva'', the American icebreaker could maintain this power level only for a period of four hours at a time and the total continuous rating was only 16,900{{nbsp}}hp.<ref>[http://www.mxak.org/community/icepick/icepick5.pdf The Icebreaker USS/USCGC Glacier]. {{retrieved|accessdate=2015-12-28}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{commons category|IMO 5242495|''Moskva''}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:1959 ships]]\n[[Category:Icebreakers of the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Ships built in Helsinki]]\n[[Category:Merchant ships of the Soviet Union]]\n", "text_old": "{|{{Infobox ship begin \n|infobox caption=\n|display title=\n}}\n{{Infobox ship image\n|Ship image=[[File:Icebreaker Moskva (1959) under construction 2.jpg|300px|''Moskva'' under construction at W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Hietalahti shipyard]]\n|Ship caption=''Moskva'' under construction at [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]] [[Hietalahti shipyard]]\n}}\n{{Infobox ship career\n|Hide header=\n|Ship country=[[Soviet Union]]\n|Ship flag={{shipboxflag|Soviet Union|naval}}\n|Ship name=''Moskva'' (''\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430'')\n|Ship namesake=[[Moscow]]\n|Ship owner=\n|Ship registry=[[Vladivostok]], [[Russia]]\n|Ship ordered=24 May 1956\n|Ship builder=[[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]] [[Hietalahti shipyard]], [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]]\n|Ship original cost=\n|Ship yard number=365\n|Ship laid down=\n|Ship launched=10 January 1959\n|Ship sponsor=\n|Ship completed=1960\n|Ship in service=1960\u20131992\n|Ship identification={{IMO number|5242495}}\n|Ship fate=Broken up in 1992\n|Ship notes=\n}}\n{{Infobox ship characteristics\n|Hide header=\n|Header caption=\n|Ship class=[[Moskva-class icebreaker|''Moskva''-class]] [[icebreaker]]\n|Ship tonnage=\n|Ship displacement=13,290 tonnes (design){{br}}15,360 tonnes (maximum)\n|Ship length={{convert|122.10|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n|Ship beam={{convert|24.50|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n|Ship height=\n|Ship draught={{convert|9.50|m|ft|abbr=on}} (design){{br}}{{convert|10.50|m|ft|abbr=on}} (maximum)\n|Ship depth=\n|Ship ice class=\n|Ship power=8{{nbsp}}&times;{{nbsp}}W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4-Sulzer 9MH51 (8{{nbsp}}&times;{{nbsp}}3,250{{nbsp}}hp)\n|Ship propulsion=[[Diesel-electric]]; three shafts{{br}}{{convert|22000|hp|kW|abbr=on|-2}}\n|Ship speed={{convert|18|kn}}\n|Ship range=\n|Ship endurance=\n|Ship boats=\n|Ship capacity=\n|Ship crew=109\n|Ship aircraft facilities=Helideck and hangar\n|Ship notes=\n}}\n|}\n\n'''''Moskva''''' ({{lang-rus|\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430}}; literally: [[Moscow]]) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] polar [[icebreaker]] and the [[lead ship]] of a series of five [[diesel-electric]] icebreakers named after major Soviet cities.

He listed the requirements on a sheet of paper. Wahlforss called the Hietalahti shipyard manager Eric Holmstr\u00f6m and the company's icebreaker specialist Ernst B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m to a meeting asking: \"Are we able to construct such a ship?\" B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m answered directly: \"Yes, we are.\" Subsequently, B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m made a 1:500-scaled sketch of the new 22,000-hp icebreaker in relation to Kapitan-class. Wahlforss took the drawing with him in 1954 to a meeting in Moscow where he had dinner with Mikoyan. When Mikoyan opened the discussion about the new icebreaker concept, Wahlforss took the drawing from his suitcase asking \"Is this what you need?\". Mikoyan became very delighted and said: \"For three years I have asked from our own shipyards for possibility to construct such a icebreaker, but I have only got headshaking!\"<ref name=\"Zilliacus: s.283-295\">{{cite book |last=Zilliacus |first=Benedict |year=1984 |chapter= \u00bbSeitsem\u00e4ntoista sanaa\u00bb |title=Wilhelm Wahlforss |language=Finnish |others=Translated from Swedish by Riitta Valaj\u00e4rvi |location=Porvoo |publisher=Oy W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Ab |pages=283\u2013295 |isbn=951-99541-8-X }}</ref>\n\nOn 24 May 1956, W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 and [[Sudoimport]], the Soviet foreign trade organization with a monopoly for the foreign trade of ships, signed a shipbuilding contract for the construction of two polar icebreakers. While only half as powerful as the 44,000{{nbsp}}hp ''Lenin'', the new icebreakers featured the most powerful diesel-electric power plant ever installed on a ship at the time.<ref name=\"wartsila\"/> The Soviet negotiators had additional requirements for deep draught and fuel consumption, which Wahlforss promised W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 to reach. In practice, the demands put the company's engineering expertise to a tough test. At the end, however, W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 could deliver what Wahlforss had promised. Few years later, W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 received a follow-up order for three more icebreakers of the same design.<ref name=\"Zilliacus: s.283-295\"/>\n\nThe hull of the icebreaker was assembled on a [[slipway]] and launched on 10 January 1959. Prior to this, the harbor basin and the entrance channel had to be [[dredging|dredged]]. In addition, a special steel pontoon had to be constructed and welded to the stern of the icebreaker in order to reduce stresses and allow safe launching of the heavy ice-strengthened hull.<ref name=\"wartsila\" /> In the [[Ceremonial ship launching|launching ceremony]], the new icebreaker was given the name ''Moskva'' after [[Moscow|the capital city]]. The later icebreakers of the series were also named after the largest cities of the Soviet Union. The construction of the vessel continued in the outfitting quay and ''Moskva'' was delivered during the summer of 1960.<ref name=\"wartsila\" />\n\n== Service history ==\n\nIn October 1961, after assisting more than a hundred cargo ships in the Russian Arctic during the autumn navigating season, ''Moskva'' completed an eastbound transit of the Northern Sea Route from [[Murmansk]] to [[Vladivostok]] in only 10 days. This was both a record time as well as the latest time a successful transit had been completed before the winter, and demonstrated how the shipping season could be extended with modern icebreakers.<ref name=\"polarpost\" /> Afterwards, ''Moskva'' was stationed in [[Vladivostok]] and used to escort in the eastern part of the Northern Sea Route.<ref name=\"thesovietarctic\" />\n\nOn 20 October 1965, ''Moskva'' and her sister ship [[Leningrad (icebreaker)|''Leningrad'']] came to assist ''Vitimles'', a merchant ship that had been waiting for icebreaker assistance for 30 days in the [[East Siberian Sea]].<ref name=\"marchenko\">{{cite book |last=Marchenko |first=Nataliya |year=2012 |title=Russian Arctic Seas |url= |location= |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-642-22124-8 |accessdate= }}</ref> However, by the time the icebreakers arrived, the pack ice had begun to drift at a considerable speed and a dangerous phenomenon known as \"ice jet\" appeared,<ref>Weintrit, A. and Neumann, T.

At the widest point of the hull, the vessel had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|24.50|m|ft|0}}, but due to the sloping sides the maximum beam at waterline was slightly less, {{convert|23.50|m|ft|0}}. At design waterline, the icebreaker drew {{convert|9.5|m|ft|0}} of water and had a displacement of 13,290 tonnes. However, the maximum draught of the vessel was {{convert|10.5|m|ft|0}}, corresponding to a maximum displacement of 15,360 tonnes. ''Moskva'' was the largest non-nuclear icebreaker in the world at the time of the delivery,<ref name=\"wartsila\" /> having almost twice the displacement of the largest western icebreakers.\n\nDesigned to withstand the compression of the polar pack ice, the fully welded steel hull of ''Moskva'' was very strong. The {{convert|6|m|ft|adj=on}} wide ice belt, where the hull plating was over {{convert|50|mm|in}} thick in the bow, was designed to withstand ice pressures of up to 1,000 tonnes per square meter (about {{convert|9.81|MPa|psi|-2|abbr=on|disp=out}}), more than 30 to 60 times as much as normal merchant ships at the time. In bow and stern, the web frames were aligned perpendicularly to the shell plating. Longitudinally, the hull was divided into nine watertight compartments and the vessel had a full-length double hull below tweendeck.<ref name=\"wartsila\" />\n\n''Moskva'' had single and double cabins for 109 persons. In addition to vessel crew and aviation detachment, accommodation and laboratories were reserved for scientists when the icebreaker carried out research expeditions in the polar waters. Special attention had been paid to the furnishing and decoration of the public spaces, which included a game room and a music room with a piano for the officers. The icebreaker was delivered from the shipyard with a total of three television sets.<ref name=\"wartsila\" />\n\nDesigned to escort merchant ships through ice-covered waters, ''Moskva'' had a towing winch and a notch in the stern where the bow of the towed ship would be pulled. For ice reconnaissance, the icebreaker had a helicopter hangar and a landing platform in the stern. The vessel had two motor lifeboats for 60 persons and two 70-person lifeboats with manually operated propeller. In addition, the icebreaker carried a {{convert|11.5|m|ft|0|adj=on}} motor [[launch (boat)|launch]] with a steel hull, a {{convert|9|m|ft|adj=on}} aluminum boat, two fiberglass ice sledge-boats, a {{convert|4.5|m|ft|0|adj=on}} rowing boat and a light aluminum dinghy. The boats were launched using the icebreakers' two 10-ton deck cranes.<ref name=\"wartsila\" />\n\n=== Power and propulsion ===\n\n''Moskva'' was a diesel-electric icebreaker with a power plant consisting of eight [[straight-nine engine|9-cylinder]] W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4-Sulzer 9MH51 single-acting [[two-stroke]] [[diesel engines]], each of which was rated at 3,250{{nbsp}}hp in continuous operation but capable of 10% overload for one hour at a time. The main engines were directly coupled to [[Siemens]] [[direct current|direct current (DC)]] generators that supplied electricity to propulsion motors through an applied [[Ward Leonard control|Ward Leonard drive system]]. Normally, four generators were connected to the tandem electric motor driving the centerline propeller shaft and two generators to the propulsion motors driving the wing shafts, but the system allowed connecting two generators from the center circuit to either port or starboard circuit and vice versa in case of engine failure.<ref name=\"wartsila\" />\n\nThe electric power produced by the main engines and generators was transformed into propeller thrust by three large DC motors coupled to the propeller shafts. The centerline propulsion motor, located in a separate compartment, was a tandem unit consisting of two 5,500{{nbsp}}hp motors while the port and starboard propulsion motors, located side-by-side in the same compartment, were rated at 5,500{{nbsp}}hp each. While the nominal speed of the propulsion motors was 115 rpm, full power was available at all revolution speeds between 110 and 150 rpm. The four-blade propellers were of fixed pitch type with the centerline propeller, which had twice the propulsion power of the wing shafts, having greater diameter than the port and starboard propellers. The icebreaker had a single centerline rudder.<ref name=\"wartsila\" />\n\nWith an overall propulsion power of 22,000{{nbsp}}hp, ''Moskva'' was at the time the most powerful diesel-electric icebreaker in the world. She was second only to the nuclear-powered ''Lenin'' which, at 44,000{{nbsp}}hp, had twice the power of the ''Moskva''-class icebreakers.<ref name=\"wartsila\" /> While the most powerful western icebreaker at the time, the 1955-built [[USS Glacier (AGB-4)|USS ''Glacier'']], had two propulsion motors rated at 10,500{{nbsp}}hp each and was thus nearly as powerful as ''Moskva'', the American icebreaker could maintain this power level only for a period of four hours at a time and the total continuous rating was only 16,900{{nbsp}}hp.<ref>[http://www.mxak.org/community/icepick/icepick5.pdf The Icebreaker USS/USCGC Glacier]. {{retrieved|accessdate=2015-12-28}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{commonscat|IMO 5242495|''Moskva''}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:1959 ships]]\n[[Category:Icebreakers of the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Ships built in Helsinki]]\n[[Category:Merchant ships of the Soviet Union]]\n", "name_user": "Majavah", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: side-by-side \u2192 side by side", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moskva_(1959_icebreaker)"}

After only eighteen months of service, she was lost in a hurricane on the North Atlantic, with most of her crew rescued through a daring maneuver carried out by the ship ''Excelsior''.\n\nBuilt for South American service, ''Tejuca'' spent most of her brief career in the coffee trade between Brazil and the United States, making four round trips between the two countries, including a passage between [[Bahia]] and [[New Orleans]] in early 1855 that at the time was reportedly one of the fastest on record. \n\nIn late December 1855, ''Tejuca'' embarked on her first [[transatlantic crossing]], and a few days later ran into a severe hurricane. With the ship badly damaged and in a sinking condition, all but one of her crew were rescued by the ship ''Excelsior'', whose captain risked his own vessel by bringing it alongside ''Tejuca'' while the storm still raged.

After only eighteen months of service, she was lost in a hurricane on the North Atlantic, with most of her crew rescued through a daring maneuver carried out by the ship ''Excelsior''.\n\nBuilt for South American service, ''Tejuca'' spent most of her brief career in the coffee trade between Brazil and the United States, making four round trips between the two countries, including a passage between [[Bahia]] and [[New Orleans]] in early 1855 that at the time was reportedly one of the fastest on record. \n\nIn late December 1855, ''Tejuca'' embarked on her first [[transatlantic crossing]], and a few days later ran into a severe hurricane. With the ship badly damaged and in a sinking condition, all but one of her crew were rescued by the ship ''Excelsior'', whose captain risked his own vessel by bringing it alongside ''Tejuca'' while the storm still raged.

Goddess Sheetala is worshipped on the eighth day after festival of colors ([[Holi]]), on the occasion of [[Sheetala Asthami]].\n\n==Legend==\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2019}}\nOne story says [[Goddess]] [[Durga]] has incarnated as little [[K\u0101ty\u0101yan\u012b]] \u2014 daughter of sage Katyayan \u2014 to destroy all arrogant evil demonic forces of the world, in her real form as Durga, she killed many demons that were sent by [[Kalakeyas|Kaalkeya]].\n\nA demon named Jwarasur, the demon of [[fever]], started spreading incurable diseases to Katyayani's childhood friends, such as [[cholera]], [[dysentery]], measles, and smallpox. Katyayani cured the diseases of some of her friends. To relieve the world from all fevers and diseases, Katyayani assumed the form of Shitala Devi. Each of her four hands held a short broom, winnowing fan, jar of cooling water and a drinking cup. With her power, she cured all the children's diseases. Katyayani then requests her friend, Batuk to go out and confront the demon Jwarasur. A battle ensued between the young Batuk and demon Jwarasur. Jwarasur succeeds in defeating Batuk. Then, Batuk, lying dead, magically faded into dust. Jwarasur was shocked that Batuk had disappeared and wondered where he had gone, not realising that Batuk had, in fact, assumed the form of an awful male figure with three eyes and four arms holding a battle-axe, sword, trident and demon head. This figure was pitch-black in colour with flowing locks and eyes ablaze with fury and wore a tiger-skin and a [[Mundamala|garland of skulls]] - for Batuk had assumed the appearance of Lord [[Shiva]]'s ferocious form, the terrible [[Bhairava|Bhairav]]. Bhairav reprimands Jwarasur and tells him that he is the servant of Goddess Durga (incarnate as Katyayani). A long discussion ensued but then converted into battle. Jwarasur created many demons from his powers but Bhairav managed to destroy all of them. Finally, Bhairav wrestled with Jwarasur and killed him with his trident.\n\nThere once was a demon named Jwarasur. He was named Jwarasur because he is the demon of fever. He went around and spread incurable fever to all the children of their parents wherever he went. His terrifying presence alarmed those who were around him and none of the children ever got relieved because of him. Mothers were crying and they wailed, and doctors couldn't find a cure for the children's incurable fever. Knowing that Jwarasur's reign of terror will keep spreading, Mahadev and Parvati decided to take action against him to stop him. Parvati decides that the power of her coolness will bring relief to all the children and their parents. Mahadev transformed himself into Bhairav and reaches the battlefield where he confronted Jwarasur to prevent him from going around and doing any more harm to children. Both of them indulged themselves in a great and huge wrestling match.\n\nMeanwhile, Parvati on the other hand, transformed herself into Sheetala Devi. Sheetala Devi resembles a maiden, she was fair in complexion, wearing light and dark blue robes, wearing a minimal amount of ornaments on her limbs, three-eyed and is looking very youthful in appearance while representing an omnipotent Goddess, as being one among the incarnations of Durga. In her four hands, she held a bowl, a fan, a small broom, or a winnowing fan of some sort and she carries a pot of cold water, in which she uses to cure the diseased. She was mounted on the back of a donkey as her vehicle. Goddess Sheetala started her mission on providing relief to the children. Wherever Goddess Sheetala went around and over the world, with her most effective tool, her cold and cooling water brought relief to all children, of all shapes, sizes, colors, and ages. They were all completely restored to their good health, which brought instant relief to them and to joy to all the parents. Seeing Goddess Sheetala, everybody paid their homage to her and all the children thanked her for curing their incurable fever and purifying them.\n\nThen, Goddess Sheetala makes an appearance in the battlefield where Bhairav and Jwarasur were fighting against each other. Sheetala Devi berates Jwarasur for his misdeeds towards young children as he spread fever to them. Bhairav also lets Jwarasur know that not only can Goddess Sheetala cure poxes, sores, ghouls, pustules and diseases, she is a goddess of sores, ghouls, and diseases and she can give them too. She is the cause as well as the cure. Finally, Sheetala Devi severely infected Jwarasur with an intense case of smallpox, thus putting an end to his reign of terror for once and for all. Mahadev liberates himself from Bhairav and Parvati frees herself from Goddess Sheetala Devi. They both returned home to Kailash.<ref>{{cite news |title=\u0936\u0940\u0924\u0932\u093e \u092e\u093e\u0924\u093e \u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0940 \u0925\u0940 \u0905\u0917\u094d\u0928\u093f \u0938\u0947 \u0907\u0938\u0915\u0940 \u0930\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e, \u092a\u0922\u093c\u093f\u090f \u092a\u0942\u0930\u0940 \u0915\u0925\u093e |url=https://www.patrika.com/astrology-and-spirituality/know-story-of-sheetala-mata-965551/ |accessdate=2 October 2019 |work=patrika.com |language=hindi}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=\u092e\u093e\u0924\u093e \u0936\u0940\u0924\u0932\u093e \u091c\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0915\u0925\u093e |url=https://www.punjabkesari.in/dharm/news/story-of-mata-sheetla-ji-594572 |accessdate=2 October 2019 |work=punjabkesari |date=20 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=\u0905\u0928\u094b\u0916\u0947 \u091a\u092e\u0924\u094d\u200d\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0927 \u0939\u0948 \u0936\u0940\u0924\u0932\u093e \u092e\u093e\u0924\u093e \u0915\u093e \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930 |url=https://aajtak.intoday.in/story/the-amazing-temple-of-sheetla-mata-rajasthan-1-862001.html |accessdate=2 October 2019 |work=aajtak.intoday.in |language=hi}}</ref>\n\n==Name and variants==\nShitala literally means \"one who cools\" in [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]. Shitala is worshiped under different names in various parts of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Shitala is more often called ''Ma'' and ''Mata'' (\u2018mother\u2019) and is worshiped by Hindus, [[Buddhists]] and tribal communities. She is mentioned in Tantric and Puranic literature and her later appearance in vernacular texts (such as the Bengali 17th century ''Shitala-mangal-kabyas'', \u2018auspicious poetry\u2019 written by Manikram Gangopadhyay ) has contributed to strengthen her status.<ref>{{Cite bookk | url=https://books.google.com/?id=YCJrUfVtZxoC&pg=PA224&lpg=PA224&dq=Shitala+Mangal+kabya+writer#v=onepage&q=Shitala%20Mangal%20kabya%20writer&f=false | title=A Dictionary of Indian Literature: Beginnings-1850| isbn=9788125014539| last1=Mukherjee| first1=Sujit| year=1998}}</ref>\n\nShitala is primarily popular in regions of [[North India]]. In some traditions she is identified with an aspect of [[Parvati]], the consort of [[Shiva]]. Shitala is addressed as Mother, as a seasonal goddess (Vasant, i.e. Spring) and with honorific titles such as '''Thakurani''', '''Jagrani''' ('Queen of the World'), '''Karunamayi''' ('She who is full of mercy'), '''Mangala''' ('The Auspicious One'), '''Bhagavati''' ('The Goddess'), '''Dayamayi''' ('She who is Full of Grace and Kindness').<ref>Ferrari (2009: 146-147)</ref> The role of Shitala in [[South India]] is taken by the Goddess incarnate [[Mariamman]], who is worshiped by [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]]-speaking people.\n\nIn [[Gurgaon]] of [[Haryana]] state, Shitala is considered to be [[Drona#Kripi - wife of Dronacharya|Kripi]] (wife of [[Drona|Guru Dronacharya]]) and worshiped there in [[Sheetla Mata Mandir Gurgaon]].<ref name=BBE1>{{Cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/beyond-business/the-guru-in-gurugram-116042201271_1.html|title=Finding Guru Dronacharya in 'Gurugram'|first=Manavi|last=Kapur|date=23 April 2016|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2018|via=Business Standard|newspaper=Business Standard India}}</ref>\n\n==Shitala puja==\nThe worship of Shitala is conducted by both [[Brahmin]]s and [[pujari]]s. She is primarily worshiped in the dry seasons of winter and spring on the day which is known as [[Sheetala Asthami]]. There are many [[arti sangrah]] and [[stuti]]es for the puja of Maa Shitala. Some of them are Shri Shitla Mata Chalisa, [[Shitala Maa ki Arti]], and Shri Shitala Mata Ashtak.\n\n==Iconography and symbolism==\n[[File:Shitala 25 Palli Arnab Dutta 2010.JPG|thumb|Image of Shitala]]\nShitala is represented as a young maiden crowned with a winnowing-fan, riding a donkey, holding a short broom (either to spread or dust off germs) and a pot full of pulses (the viruses) or cold water (a healing tool). Among low-caste Hindus and tribal communities, she is represented with slab-stones or carved heads. Sometimes, she is said to be carrying a bunch of [[neem]] (''Azadirachta indica'') leaves, a [[medicinal herb]] used throughout India since ancient times that is believed by some to be an effective remedy to most skin diseases to this day.\n\nShitala is the form of folk demi-goddess Katyayani. She gives coolness to the patients of fever. According to Devi Mahatyam, when a demon named Jvarasura gave bacterial fever to all the children, goddess Katyayani came in the form of Shitala to purify children's blood and to destroy the bacteria of fever in blood. In Sanskrit 'jvara' means \"fever\" and 'sh\u012btala' means \"coolness\".

Goddess Sheetala is worshipped on the eighth day after festival of colors ([[Holi]]), on the occasion of [[Sheetala Asthami]].\n\n==Legend==\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2019}}\nOne story says [[Goddess]] [[Durga]] has incarnated as little [[K\u0101ty\u0101yan\u012b]] \u2014 daughter of sage Katyayan \u2014 to destroy all arrogant evil demonic forces of the world, in her real form as Durga, she killed many demons that were sent by [[Kalakeyas|Kaalkeya]].\n\nA demon named Jwarasur, the demon of [[fever]], started spreading incurable diseases to Katyayani's childhood friends, such as [[cholera]], [[dysentery]], measles, and smallpox. Katyayani cured the diseases of some of her friends. To relieve the world from all fevers and diseases, Katyayani assumed the form of Shitala Devi. Each of her four hands held a short broom, winnowing fan, jar of cooling water and a drinking cup. With her power, she cured all the children's diseases. Katyayani then requests her friend, Batuk to go out and confront the demon Jwarasur. A battle ensued between the young Batuk and demon Jwarasur. Jwarasur succeeds in defeating Batuk. Then, Batuk, lying dead, magically faded into dust. Jwarasur was shocked that Batuk had disappeared and wondered where he had gone, not realising that Batuk had, in fact, assumed the form of an awful male figure with three eyes and four arms holding a battle-axe, sword, trident and demon head. This figure was pitch-black in colour with flowing locks and eyes ablaze with fury and wore a tiger-skin and a [[Mundamala|garland of skulls]] - for Batuk had assumed the appearance of Lord [[Shiva]]'s ferocious form, the terrible [[Bhairava|Bhairav]]. Bhairav reprimands Jwarasur and tells him that he is the servant of Goddess Durga (incarnate as Katyayani). A long discussion ensued but then converted into battle. Jwarasur created many demons from his powers but Bhairav managed to destroy all of them. Finally, Bhairav wrestled with Jwarasur and killed him with his trident.\n\nThere once was a demon named Jwarasur. He was named Jwarasur because he is the demon of fever. He went around and spread incurable fever to all the children of their parents wherever he went. His terrifying presence alarmed those who were around him and none of the children ever got relieved because of him. Mothers were crying and they wailed, and doctors couldn't find a cure for the children's incurable fever. Knowing that Jwarasur's reign of terror will keep spreading, Mahadev and Parvati decided to take action against him to stop him. Parvati decides that the power of her coolness will bring relief to all the children and their parents. Mahadev transformed himself into Bhairav and reaches the battlefield where he confronted Jwarasur to prevent him from going around and doing any more harm to children. Both of them indulged themselves in a great and huge wrestling match.\n\nMeanwhile, Parvati on the other hand, transformed herself into Sheetala Devi. Sheetala Devi resembles a maiden, she was fair in complexion, wearing light and dark blue robes, wearing a minimal amount of ornaments on her limbs, three-eyed and is looking very youthful in appearance while representing an omnipotent Goddess, as being one among the incarnations of Durga. In her four hands, she held a bowl, a fan, a small broom, or a winnowing fan of some sort and she carries a pot of cold water, in which she uses to cure the diseased. She was mounted on the back of a donkey as her vehicle. Goddess Sheetala started her mission on providing relief to the children. Wherever Goddess Sheetala went around and over the world, with her most effective tool, her cold and cooling water brought relief to all children, of all shapes, sizes, colors, and ages. They were all completely restored to their good health, which brought instant relief to them and to joy to all the parents. Seeing Goddess Sheetala, everybody paid their homage to her and all the children thanked her for curing their incurable fever and purifying them.\n\nThen, Goddess Sheetala makes an appearance in the battlefield where Bhairav and Jwarasur were fighting against each other. Sheetala Devi berates Jwarasur for his misdeeds towards young children as he spread fever to them. Bhairav also lets Jwarasur know that not only can Goddess Sheetala cure poxes, sores, ghouls, pustules and diseases, she is a goddess of sores, ghouls, and diseases and she can give them too. She is the cause as well as the cure. Finally, Sheetala Devi severely infected Jwarasur with an intense case of smallpox, thus putting an end to his reign of terror for once and for all. Mahadev liberates himself from Bhairav and Parvati frees herself from Goddess Sheetala Devi. They both returned home to Kailash.<ref>{{cite news |title=\u0936\u0940\u0924\u0932\u093e \u092e\u093e\u0924\u093e \u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0940 \u0925\u0940 \u0905\u0917\u094d\u0928\u093f \u0938\u0947 \u0907\u0938\u0915\u0940 \u0930\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e, \u092a\u0922\u093c\u093f\u090f \u092a\u0942\u0930\u0940 \u0915\u0925\u093e |url=https://www.patrika.com/astrology-and-spirituality/know-story-of-sheetala-mata-965551/ |accessdate=2 October 2019 |work=patrika.com |language=hindi}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=\u092e\u093e\u0924\u093e \u0936\u0940\u0924\u0932\u093e \u091c\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0915\u0925\u093e |url=https://www.punjabkesari.in/dharm/news/story-of-mata-sheetla-ji-594572 |accessdate=2 October 2019 |work=punjabkesari |date=20 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=\u0905\u0928\u094b\u0916\u0947 \u091a\u092e\u0924\u094d\u200d\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0927 \u0939\u0948 \u0936\u0940\u0924\u0932\u093e \u092e\u093e\u0924\u093e \u0915\u093e \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930 |url=https://aajtak.intoday.in/story/the-amazing-temple-of-sheetla-mata-rajasthan-1-862001.html |accessdate=2 October 2019 |work=aajtak.intoday.in |language=hi}}</ref>\n\n==Name and variants==\nShitala literally means \"one who cools\" in [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]. Shitala is worshiped under different names in various parts of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Shitala is more often called ''Ma'' and ''Mata'' (\u2018mother\u2019) and is worshiped by Hindus, [[Buddhists]] and tribal communities. She is mentioned in Tantric and Puranic literature and her later appearance in vernacular texts (such as the Bengali 17th century ''Shitala-mangal-kabyas'', \u2018auspicious poetry\u2019 written by Manikram Gangopadhyay ) has contributed to strengthen her status.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=YCJrUfVtZxoC&pg=PA224&lpg=PA224&dq=Shitala+Mangal+kabya+writer#v=onepage&q=Shitala%20Mangal%20kabya%20writer&f=false | title=A Dictionary of Indian Literature: Beginnings-1850| isbn=9788125014539| last1=Mukherjee| first1=Sujit| year=1998}}</ref>\n\nShitala is primarily popular in regions of [[North India]]. In some traditions she is identified with an aspect of [[Parvati]], the consort of [[Shiva]]. Shitala is addressed as Mother, as a seasonal goddess (Vasant, i.e. Spring) and with honorific titles such as '''Thakurani''', '''Jagrani''' ('Queen of the World'), '''Karunamayi''' ('She who is full of mercy'), '''Mangala''' ('The Auspicious One'), '''Bhagavati''' ('The Goddess'), '''Dayamayi''' ('She who is Full of Grace and Kindness').<ref>Ferrari (2009: 146-147)</ref> The role of Shitala in [[South India]] is taken by the Goddess incarnate [[Mariamman]], who is worshiped by [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]]-speaking people.\n\nIn [[Gurgaon]] of [[Haryana]] state, Shitala is considered to be [[Drona#Kripi - wife of Dronacharya|Kripi]] (wife of [[Drona|Guru Dronacharya]]) and worshiped there in [[Sheetla Mata Mandir Gurgaon]].<ref name=BBE1>{{Cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/beyond-business/the-guru-in-gurugram-116042201271_1.html|title=Finding Guru Dronacharya in 'Gurugram'|first=Manavi|last=Kapur|date=23 April 2016|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2018|via=Business Standard|newspaper=Business Standard India}}</ref>\n\n==Shitala puja==\nThe worship of Shitala is conducted by both [[Brahmin]]s and [[pujari]]s. She is primarily worshiped in the dry seasons of winter and spring on the day which is known as [[Sheetala Asthami]]. There are many [[arti sangrah]] and [[stuti]]es for the puja of Maa Shitala. Some of them are Shri Shitla Mata Chalisa, [[Shitala Maa ki Arti]], and Shri Shitala Mata Ashtak.\n\n==Iconography and symbolism==\n[[File:Shitala 25 Palli Arnab Dutta 2010.JPG|thumb|Image of Shitala]]\nShitala is represented as a young maiden crowned with a winnowing-fan, riding a donkey, holding a short broom (either to spread or dust off germs) and a pot full of pulses (the viruses) or cold water (a healing tool). Among low-caste Hindus and tribal communities, she is represented with slab-stones or carved heads. Sometimes, she is said to be carrying a bunch of [[neem]] (''Azadirachta indica'') leaves, a [[medicinal herb]] used throughout India since ancient times that is believed by some to be an effective remedy to most skin diseases to this day.\n\nShitala is the form of folk demi-goddess Katyayani. She gives coolness to the patients of fever. According to Devi Mahatyam, when a demon named Jvarasura gave bacterial fever to all the children, goddess Katyayani came in the form of Shitala to purify children's blood and to destroy the bacteria of fever in blood. In Sanskrit 'jvara' means \"fever\" and 'sh\u012btala' means \"coolness\". Shitala is sometimes also depicted with Jvarasura, the fever demon; Ghentu-debata, the god of skin diseases; Raktabati, the goddess of blood infections and the sixty-four epidemics; and is often worshiped with [[Oladevi]], another disease goddess (some say of cholera).<ref>{{cite book|title=Fruits of worship: practical religion in Bengal By Ralph W.

A versatile performer, he became a celebrated character actor later in his career. [[Laurence Olivier]] once said he considered Rooney \"the best there has ever been\".<ref name=\"THR\" /> [[Clarence Brown]], who directed him in two of his earliest dramatic roles, ''[[National Velvet (film)|National Velvet]]'' and ''[[The Human Comedy (film)|The Human Comedy]]'', said he was \"the closest thing to a genius I ever worked with\".<ref>{{cite web | title=Iconic Actor Mickey Rooney Dies At 93 | website=Dallas News | date=April 7, 2014 | url=https://dfw.cbslocal.com/2014/04/07/iconic-actor-mickey-rooney-dies-at-93/ | access-date=September 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\nRooney first performed in [[vaudeville]] as a child and made his film debut at the age of six.

Critic [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] hailed his performance as \"one of the cinema's most arresting pieces of magic\". In 1938, he co-starred in [[Boys Town (film)|''Boys Town'']].

[[Conscription|Drafted]] into the Army during [[World War II]], he served nearly two years entertaining over two million troops on stage and radio and was awarded a [[Bronze Star]] for performing in combat zones. Returning from the war in 1945, he was too old for juvenile roles but too short to be an adult movie star, and was unable to get as many starring roles. Nevertheless, Rooney's popularity was renewed with well-received supporting roles in films such as ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' (1961), ''[[Requiem for a Heavyweight]]'' (1962), ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), and ''[[The Black Stallion (film)|The Black Stallion]]'' (1979). In the early 1980s, he returned to Broadway in [[Sugar Babies (musical)|''Sugar Babies'']] and again became a celebrated star. Rooney made hundreds of appearances on TV, including dramas, variety programs, and talk shows, and won an [[Emmy Awards|Emmy]] in 1982 plus a Golden Globe for his role in ''[[Bill (1981 film)|Bill]]'' (1981).\n\n== Early life ==\nRooney was born Ninnian Joseph Yule Jr. on September 23, 1920 in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], the only child of [[vaudeville|vaudevillians]] Nellie W.

Hardy, portrayed by [[Lionel Barrymore]] (although [[Lewis Stone]] played the role of Judge Hardy in subsequent films). The film was an unexpected success, and led to 13 more ''[[Andy Hardy]]'' films between 1937 and 1946, and a final film in 1958.\n\nAccording to author Barry Monush, MGM wanted the Andy Hardy films to appeal to all family members. Rooney's character portrayed a typical \"anxious, hyperactive, girl-crazy teenager\", and he soon became the unintended main star of the films. Although some critics describe the series of films as \"sweet, overly idealized, and pretty much interchangeable,\" their ultimate success was because they gave viewers a \"comforting portrait of small-town America that seemed suited for the times\", with Rooney instilling \"a lasting image of what every parent wished their teen could be like\".<ref name=Monush />\n\nBehind the scenes, however, Rooney was like the \"hyperactive girl-crazy teenager\" he portrayed on the screen. [[Wallace Beery]], his co-star in ''[[Stablemates]]'', described him as a \"brat\", but a \"fine actor\".{{sfn | Marx | 1986 | p=68}} MGM head [[Louis B.

Thomson also explains that Rooney's characters were able to cover a wide range of emotional types, and gives three examples where \"Rooney is not just an actor of genius, but an artist able to maintain a stylized commentary on the demon impulse of the small, belligerent man:\"<ref name=Thomson />\n\n{{quote|Rooney's Puck in [[A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935 film)|''A Midsummer Night's Dream'']] (1935) is truly inhuman, one of cinema's most arresting pieces of magic.&nbsp;...

In the early 1980s, he returned to Broadway in [[Sugar Babies (musical)|''Sugar Babies'']], and \"found himself once more back on top\".<ref name=Unterburger />\n\nBasinger tries to encapsulate Rooney's career:\n\n{{quote|Rooney's abundant talent, like his film image, might seem like a metaphor for America: a seemingly endless supply of natural resources that could never dry up, but which, it turned out, could be ruined by excessive use and abuse, by arrogance or power, and which had to be carefully tended to be returned to full capacity. From child star to character actor, from movie shorts to television specials, and from films to Broadway, Rooney ultimately did prove he could do it all, do it well, and keep on doing it.

In a career spanning nine decades and continuing until shortly before his death, he appeared in more than 300 films and was among the last surviving stars of the silent-film era.<ref name=\"Mickey Rooney, an enduring star\">{{cite web | title=Mickey Rooney, an enduring star | website=BostonGlobe.com | date=April 7, 2014 | url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/2014/04/07/rooney/coAEzsSNMsl3jNIE2EzqNP/story.html | access-date=September 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAt the height of a career that was marked by declines and comebacks, Rooney performed the role of [[Andy Hardy]] in a series of 16 films in the 1930's and 1940's that epitomized American family values. A versatile performer, he became a celebrated character actor later in his career. [[Laurence Olivier]] once said he considered Rooney \"the best there has ever been\".<ref name=\"THR\" /> [[Clarence Brown]], who directed him in two of his earliest dramatic roles, ''[[National Velvet (film)|National Velvet]]'' and ''[[The Human Comedy (film)|The Human Comedy]]'', said he was \"the closest thing to a genius I ever worked with\".<ref>{{cite web | title=Iconic Actor Mickey Rooney Dies At 93 | website=Dallas News | date=April 7, 2014 | url=https://dfw.cbslocal.com/2014/04/07/iconic-actor-mickey-rooney-dies-at-93/ | access-date=September 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\nRooney first performed in [[vaudeville]] as a child and made his film debut at the age of six. At 14, he played [[Puck (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Puck]] in the play and later the 1935 film adaptation of [[A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935 film)|''A Midsummer Night's Dream'']]. Critic [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] hailed his performance as \"one of the cinema's most arresting pieces of magic\". In 1938, he co-starred in [[Boys Town (film)|''Boys Town'']]. At 18, he was the first teenager to be nominated for an Oscar for his leading role in ''[[Babes in Arms (film)|Babes in Arms]]'', and he was awarded a special [[Academy Juvenile Award]] in 1939.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-mickey-rooney-career-20140407,0,3547872,full.story#axzz2yVrN04QO|title=Mickey Rooney: A long and remarkable career in film, TV|author=Los Angeles Times|work=latimes.com|date=April 7, 2014|accessdate=November 16, 2015}}</ref> At the peak of his career between the ages of 15 and 25, he made 43 films, which made him one of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'s most consistently successful actors and a favorite of MGM studio head [[Louis B. Mayer]].\n\nRooney was the top box-office attraction from 1939 to 1941<ref name=\"Vanity Fair \u2013 April 7, 2014\" /> and one of the best-paid actors of that era,<ref name=\"THR\" /> but his career would never again rise to such heights. [[Conscription|Drafted]] into the Army during [[World War II]], he served nearly two years entertaining over two million troops on stage and radio and was awarded a [[Bronze Star]] for performing in combat zones. Returning from the war in 1945, he was too old for juvenile roles but too short to be an adult movie star, and was unable to get as many starring roles. Nevertheless, Rooney's popularity was renewed with well-received supporting roles in films such as ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' (1961), ''[[Requiem for a Heavyweight]]'' (1962), ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), and ''[[The Black Stallion (film)|The Black Stallion]]'' (1979). In the early 1980s, he returned to Broadway in [[Sugar Babies (musical)|''Sugar Babies'']] and again became a celebrated star. Rooney made hundreds of appearances on TV, including dramas, variety programs, and talk shows, and won an [[Emmy Awards|Emmy]] in 1982 plus a Golden Globe for his role in ''[[Bill (1981 film)|Bill]]'' (1981).\n\n== Early life ==\nRooney was born Ninnian Joseph Yule Jr. on September 23, 1920 in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], the only child of [[vaudeville|vaudevillians]] Nellie W.

Hardy, portrayed by [[Lionel Barrymore]] (although [[Lewis Stone]] played the role of Judge Hardy in subsequent films). The film was an unexpected success, and led to 13 more ''[[Andy Hardy]]'' films between 1937 and 1946, and a final film in 1958.\n\nAccording to author Barry Monush, MGM wanted the Andy Hardy films to appeal to all family members. Rooney's character portrayed a typical \"anxious, hyperactive, girl-crazy teenager\", and he soon became the unintended main star of the films.

Thomson also explains that Rooney's characters were able to cover a wide range of emotional types, and gives three examples where \"Rooney is not just an actor of genius, but an artist able to maintain a stylized commentary on the demon impulse of the small, belligerent man:\"<ref name=Thomson />\n\n{{quote|Rooney's Puck in [[A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935 film)|''A Midsummer Night's Dream'']] (1935) is truly inhuman, one of cinema's most arresting pieces of magic.&nbsp;... His toughie in [[Boys Town (1938 film)|''Boys Town'']] (1938) struts and bullies like something out of a nightmare and then comes clean in a grotesque but utterly frank outburst of sentimentality in which he aspires to the boy community&nbsp;... His role as [[Baby Face Nelson (film)|''Baby Face Nelson'']] (1957), the manic, destructive response of the runt against a pig society.<ref name=Thomson />}}\n\nBy the end of the 1940s, Rooney's movie characters were no longer in demand and his career went downhill. \"In 1938,\" he said, \"I starred in eight pictures. In 1948 and 1949 together, I starred in only three.\"<ref name=Unterburger /> However, film historian [[Jeanine Basinger]] notes that although his career \"reached the heights and plunged to the depths, Rooney kept on working and growing, the mark of a professional.\" Some of the films which reinvigorated his popularity, were ''[[Requiem for a Heavyweight]]'' (1962), ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963) and ''[[The Black Stallion (film)|The Black Stallion]]'' (1979). In the early 1980s, he returned to Broadway in [[Sugar Babies (musical)|''Sugar Babies'']], and \"found himself once more back on top\".<ref name=Unterburger />\n\nBasinger tries to encapsulate Rooney's career:\n\n{{quote|Rooney's abundant talent, like his film image, might seem like a metaphor for America: a seemingly endless supply of natural resources that could never dry up, but which, it turned out, could be ruined by excessive use and abuse, by arrogance or power, and which had to be carefully tended to be returned to full capacity. From child star to character actor, from movie shorts to television specials, and from films to Broadway, Rooney ultimately did prove he could do it all, do it well, and keep on doing it. His is a unique career, both for its versatility and its longevity.<ref name=Unterburger>{{cite book|last1=Unterburger|first1=Amy L.|last2=Lofting |first2=Claire |title=Actors and actresses|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=odIa2vtGhHAC|series=International dictionary of films and filmmakers|volume=3|year=1997|publisher=St. James Press|isbn=978-1-55862-300-2|pages=1053\u20131056|oclc=264881830}}</ref>}}\n\n== Filmography ==\n{{Main|Mickey Rooney filmography}}\nOne of the most enduring performers in show business history, Rooney appeared in over 300 films in 88 years.

Until 1965, all the regular daily transmissions were operated by the All India Radio. ''Krishi Darshan'', ''Chaupaal'', ''Samachar'', and ''Kalyani'' were the first programs on the channel.\n\n=== 1982 to 1992: Golden Years ===\nOn 15 August 1982, Doordarshan introduced a national telecast service from its own TV studio in [[Mandi House]], New Delhi. This telecaster was named 'DD1' and started regular transmission. In 1984, DD1 started telecast of sponsored TV serials, which were produced by veteran filmmakers. ''[[Hum Log (TV series)|Hum Log]]'' was the first sponsored TV serial of Indian television and started airing on 7 July 1984. After the success of ''Hum Log'', many other TV producers and filmmakers created many popular shows. Some of them are mentioned below. \n\n''[[The Sword of Tipu Sultan]]'', ''[[Mirza Ghalib (TV series)|Mirza Ghalib]]'', ''Akbar Birbal'', ''Bahadur Shah Zafar'', ''[[Bharat Ek Khoj]]'', ''Mahabharat'', ''[[Ramayan]]'', ''Vishwamitra'', ''Luv Kush Uttar Ramayan'', ''Buddha'', ''[[Malgudi Days (TV series)|Malgudi Days]]'', ''Surabhi'', ''[[Hum Log (TV series)|Hum Log]]'', ''[[Hum Paanch (TV series)|Hum Paanch]]'', ''Tiltliyan'', ''Taaraa'', ''[[Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi|Yeh Jo Hai Jindagi]]'', ''Star Trek'', ''[[Khandaan (TV series)|Khaandaan]]'', ''13 Panne'', ''Air Hostess'', ''[[Wah Janaab|Waah Janaab]]'', ''Tamas'', ''[[Vikram Aur Betaal|Vikram Aur Betal]]'', ''Tenali Rama'', ''[[Kirdaar]]'', ''Singhasan Battisi'', ''Guldasta'', ''Mrignayani'', ''Shrikant'', ''Sadgati'', ''Nukkad'', ''Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi'', ''Lot Pot'', ''Mungerilal Ke Haseen Sapne'', ''Bhim Bhawani'', ''Kakkaji Kahin'', ''Paying Guest'', ''Ados Pados'', ''Upannyas'', ''Fauji'', ''Karamchand'', ''Vyomkesh Bakshi'', ''Samandar'', ''Param Veer Chakra'', ''Wagle Ki Duniya'', ''Buniyaad'', ''Kachchi Dhoop'', ''Chunauti'', ''Mahanagar'', ''Talash'', ''Umeed'', ''Subah'', ''Mr. Yogi'', ''Circus'', ''Ek Bhool'', ''Chote Babu'', ''Yugantar'', ''Kehkashan'', ''Yatra'', ''Rajni'', ''Street Hawk'', ''Udaan'', ''Gaata Jaaye Banjara'', ''Phool Khile Hain Gulsan Gulsan'', ''Pingu'', ''Circus'', ''Taaj Mahel'', ''Khubsuraat'', and ''Dada Dadi Ki Kahaniya'' were the most popular serials of those days.\n\n=== 1992 to 2010: Competition ===\nAfter the entry of private channels in India, Doordarshan started facing strong competition from [[Zee TV]] in 1992. Even though in those days, cable and satellite channels were not easily available, DD1 was still ruling the chart, as it was the only channel available terrestrially. In 1993, Doordarshan launched its second channel for the metro/urban audience, [[DD Metro]], then popularly known as DD-2\n\nWith the telecast of popular TV shows like ''[[Chandrakanta (TV series)|Chandrakanta]]'', ''[[Alif Laila]]'', ''[[Tehkikaat]]'', ''[[Chitrahaar]]'', ''Reporter'', ''[[Udaan (TV series)|Udaan]]'', ''[[Byomkesh Bakshi (TV series)|Byomkesh Bakshi]]'', ''[[Farmaan]]'', ''[[Katha Sagar]]'', ''[[Neem Ka Ped]]'' and ''[[Chanakya (TV series)|Chanakya]]'', DD National retained viewers, but Doordarshan Board focused more on its DD Metro Channel, which was aimed to compete with Zee TV. In the meantime, DD Metro became one of the popular destinations of TV viewers with its shows like ''[[Junoon (1994 TV series)|Junoon]]'', ''Superhit Muquabala'', and ''Azanabi''. Some of the popular shows were also aired on DD National.\n\nIn 1995, when most of the channels like DD Metro, Zee TV, Home TV, [[STAR Plus]] and [[Sony TV]] started focusing on their prime time slots, DD National was still stacked with its role and responsibilities, as at the time it was the only source of news on TV. To provide more entertainment, DD National opened an afternoon slot for housewives, with the telecast of ''Shanti''. To support the success of ''Shanti'', many other shows like ''[[Swabhimaan]]'', ''Farz'', and ''Yug'' were introduced and all of them were praised.\n\nIn 1997, [[Prasar Bharati]], the parent body of Doordarshan, was formed. While private channels like Zee TV, STAR Plus and Sony TV started airing high budget TV serials from top production houses, DD National was still doing the best in afternoon slots with ''Kasam'', ''Itihaas'', ''Agni'', ''Aprajita'', ''Aurat'', ''Ardhangini'', ''Sanjog, Deewar'', ''Aane Wala Pal'', ''Waqt Ki Raftaar'' and other programs. There were a few notable programs like ''India's Most Wanted'', ''[[Gul Sanobar]]'', ''Surabhi'', ''Noorjahan'', ''Om namah Shivay'', ''Jai Ganga Maiya'', and ''Suraag'' in prime time, but those were not enough to give competition to private channels.\n\nIn the late 1997, DD National started airing Mukesh Khanna's ''Shaktimaan'', which was the blockbuster TV serial in Indian history. In 2000, after tasting success with ''India's Most Wanted'', ''Jasoos Vijay'' and ''Suraag'' in prime time, Prasar Bharati decided to revamp both channels, and many new serials were introduced on DD National, but very few of them were successful because of a limited prime time slots of 9 to 10:30, compared to 8 to 11 for other channels.

In 2005, ''Hawayein'' starring [[Ravi Kishan]] and Malini Kapoor became one of the most popular shows and also won a title of Best TV Serial of the Year at the ITA Awards.\n\nIn this period, DD introduced many popular serials like ''Air Hostess'', ''Wo Huye Na hamare'', ''Kyunki Jeena Isi Ka Naam Hai'', ''Tum Dena Sath Mera'', ''Hari Mirchi lal Mirchi'', ''Soni Mahiwaal'', ''Wheel Smart Shrimati'', ''Krazzy Kiya Re'', ''Chandramukhi'', ''Jo Kahunga Sach Kahunga'', ''Tahreer Munshi Premchand Ki'', and ''Kashmkash Zindagi Ki''.\n\n=== 2010 to present ===\nAt prime time, DD was still not able to compete with private channels, and it also started losing its peak position in afternoon slots to re-runs on other channels.

Until 1965, all the regular daily transmissions were operated by the All India Radio. ''Krishi Darshan'', ''Chaupaal'', ''Samachar'', and ''Kalyani'' were the first programs on the channel.\n\n=== 1982 to 1992: Golden Years ===\nOn 15 August 1982, Doordarshan introduced a national telecast service from its own TV studio in [[Mandi House]], New Delhi. This telecaster was named 'DD1' and started regular transmission. In 1984, DD1 started telecast of sponsored TV serials, which were produced by veteran filmmakers. ''[[Hum Log (TV series)|Hum Log]]'' was the first sponsored TV serial of Indian television and started airing on 7 July 1984. After the success of ''Hum Log'', many other TV producers and filmmakers created many popular shows. Some of them are mentioned below. \n\n''[[The Sword of Tipu Sultan]]'', ''[[Mirza Ghalib (TV series)|Mirza Ghalib]]'', ''Akbar Birbal'', ''Bahadur Shah Zafar'', ''[[Bharat Ek Khoj]]'', ''Mahabharat'', ''[[Ramayan]]'', ''Vishwamitra'', ''Luv Kush Uttar Ramayan'', ''Buddha'', ''[[Malgudi Days (TV series)|Malgudi Days]]'', ''Surabhi'', ''[[Hum Log (TV series)|Hum Log]]'', ''[[Hum Paanch (TV series)|Hum Paanch]]'' ''Tiltliyan'', ''Taaraa'', ''[[Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi|Yeh Jo Hai Jindagi]]'', ''Star Trek'', ''[[Khandaan (TV series)|Khaandaan]]'', ''13 Panne'', ''Air Hostess'', ''[[Wah Janaab|Waah Janaab]]'', ''Tamas'', ''[[Vikram Aur Betaal|Vikram Aur Betal]]'', ''Tenali Rama'', ''[[Kirdaar]]'', ''Singhasan Battisi'', ''Guldasta'', ''Mrignayani'', ''Shrikant'', ''Sadgati'', ''Nukkad'', ''Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi'', ''Lot Pot'', ''Mungerilal Ke Haseen Sapne'', ''Bhim Bhawani'', ''Kakkaji Kahin'', ''Paying Guest'', ''Ados Pados'', ''Upannyas'', ''Fauji'', ''Karamchand'', ''Vyomkesh Bakshi'', ''Samandar'', ''Param Veer Chakra'', ''Wagle Ki Duniya'', ''Buniyaad'', ''Kachchi Dhoop'', ''Chunauti'', ''Mahanagar'', ''Talash'', ''Umeed'', ''Subah'', ''Mr. Yogi'', ''Circus'', ''Ek Bhool'', ''Chote Babu'', ''Yugantar'', ''Kehkashan'', ''Yatra'', ''Rajni'', ''Street Hawk'', ''Udaan'', ''Gaata Jaaye Banjara'', ''Phool Khile Hain Gulsan Gulsan'', ''Pingu'', ''Circus'', ''Taaj Mahel'', ''Khubsuraat'', and ''Dada Dadi Ki Kahaniya'' were the most popular serials of those days.\n\n=== 1992 to 2010: Competition ===\nAfter the entry of private channels in India, Doordarshan started facing strong competition from [[Zee TV]] in 1992. Even though in those days, cable and satellite channels were not easily available, DD1 was still ruling the chart, as it was the only channel available terrestrially. In 1993, Doordarshan launched its second channel for the metro/urban audience, [[DD Metro]], then popularly known as DD-2\n\nWith the telecast of popular TV shows like ''[[Chandrakanta (TV series)|Chandrakanta]]'', ''[[Alif Laila]]'', ''[[Tehkikaat]]'', ''[[Chitrahaar]]'', ''Reporter'', ''[[Udaan (TV series)|Udaan]]'', ''[[Byomkesh Bakshi (TV series)|Byomkesh Bakshi]]'', ''[[Farmaan]]'', ''[[Katha Sagar]]'', ''[[Neem Ka Ped]]'' and ''[[Chanakya (TV series)|Chanakya]]'', DD National retained viewers, but Doordarshan Board focused more on its DD Metro Channel, which was aimed to compete with Zee TV. In the meantime, DD Metro became one of the popular destinations of TV viewers with its shows like ''[[Junoon (1994 TV series)|Junoon]]'', ''Superhit Muquabala'', and ''Azanabi''. Some of the popular shows were also aired on DD National.\n\nIn 1995, when most of the channels like DD Metro, Zee TV, Home TV, [[STAR Plus]] and [[Sony TV]] started focusing on their prime time slots, DD National was still stacked with its role and responsibilities, as at the time it was the only source of news on TV. To provide more entertainment, DD National opened an afternoon slot for housewives, with the telecast of ''Shanti''. To support the success of ''Shanti'', many other shows like ''[[Swabhimaan]]'', ''Farz'', and ''Yug'' were introduced and all of them were praised.\n\nIn 1997, [[Prasar Bharati]], the parent body of Doordarshan, was formed. While private channels like Zee TV, STAR Plus and Sony TV started airing high budget TV serials from top production houses, DD National was still doing the best in afternoon slots with ''Kasam'', ''Itihaas'', ''Agni'', ''Aprajita'', ''Aurat'', ''Ardhangini'', ''Sanjog, Deewar'', ''Aane Wala Pal'', ''Waqt Ki Raftaar'' and other programs. There were a few notable programs like ''India's Most Wanted'', ''[[Gul Sanobar]]'', ''Surabhi'', ''Noorjahan'', ''Om namah Shivay'', ''Jai Ganga Maiya'', and ''Suraag'' in prime time, but those were not enough to give competition to private channels.\n\nIn the late 1997, DD National started airing Mukesh Khanna's ''Shaktimaan'', which was the blockbuster TV serial in Indian history. In 2000, after tasting success with ''India's Most Wanted'', ''Jasoos Vijay'' and ''Suraag'' in prime time, Prasar Bharati decided to revamp both channels, and many new serials were introduced on DD National, but very few of them were successful because of a limited prime time slots of 9 to 10:30, compared to 8 to 11 for other channels. New channels like [[Sahara TV]] and [[SAB TV]] were also performing better than DD channels in prime time.\n\nIn 2002, DD offered its time slots to popular filmmakers and got some popular shows of the time. Ramanand Sagar's ''Aankhen'', BR Chopra's ''Aap Beeti'', Adhikaari Brothers ''CID Officer'', Kiran Bedi's ''Galti Kiski'', and Time's ''Dishayen'' were telecast on the channels and prized by viewers. In 2003, when DD Metro Channel was converted into DD News, Prasar Bharati focused on its DD national channels, and shows like ''Meher'', ''[[Miss India (TV series)|Miss India]]'', ''Kayamat'', ''Kaanch'', and ''[[Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani (TV Series)|Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani]]'' were introduced. ''Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani'' achieved unprecedented ratings and became DD National's biggest blockbuster during this period. In 2005, ''Hawayein'' starring [[Ravi Kishan]] and Malini Kapoor became one of the most popular shows and also won a title of Best TV Serial of the Year at the ITA Awards.\n\nIn this period, DD introduced many popular serials like ''Air Hostess'', ''Wo Huye Na hamare'', ''Kyunki Jeena Isi Ka Naam Hai'', ''Tum Dena Sath Mera'', ''Hari Mirchi lal Mirchi'', ''Soni Mahiwaal'', ''Wheel Smart Shrimati'', ''Krazzy Kiya Re'', ''Chandramukhi'', ''Jo Kahunga Sach Kahunga'', ''Tahreer Munshi Premchand Ki'', and ''Kashmkash Zindagi Ki''.\n\n=== 2010 to present ===\nAt prime time, DD was still not able to compete with private channels, and it also started losing its peak position in afternoon slots to re-runs on other channels. In 2012, DD started airing Ekta Kapoor's ''Pavitra Bandhan'', Sanjay Leela Bhansali's ''Saraswatichandra'' and a few other serials. In 2013, it reduced its window for regional telecasts to 4 PM-7 PM, and stopped airing news at night, which added one and a half hour to its prime time. To enrich the new four-hour long prime time, DD brought TV serials like ''Gora'', ''Bharat Ki Shaan'', Baba Aazmi's ''Yeh Kaha Aa Gaye Hum'', ''Dil Jo Kah Na Saka'', and Sanjeev Kapoor's ''Chef Ki Rasoi''. It also launched a campaign for its afternoon slots, DD Dophar Aapke Ghar, by airing serials like ''Amrita'', ''Anudamini'', ''Aisa Prem Kahan'', and ''Chupau Kaise Laaga Chunari Me Daag''.\n\nIn November 2014, Prasar Bharati relaunched DD National as 'Desh Ka Apna Channel' with a new theme and serials like ''Happy Homes'', ''Khwabon Ke Darmiyaan'', ''Khamosh Sa Afsaana'', ''Dard Ka Rishta'', ''Paltan'', ''Stree Shakti'', ''Zindagi Ek Bhanwar'', and ''Janmon Ka Bandhan''. Initially, these shows did better, but later, as TRP fell in 2016, Prasar Bharati decided to go for a slot sale policy and invited bids from makers for its 7 PM to 11 PM slot. Afternoon slots in 2016 aired serials like ''[[Krantijyoti Savitribai Phule]]'', ''U-turn'', and ''Munidhar''. However, the strategy was not enough for its revival. \n\nIn late 2016, the slot sale policy of DD was put on hold by the government. Although many production houses like Balaji Telefilms and SaaiBaba Telefilms had won slots for airing their programs, it could not be commenced as the policy was reported for review.

{"title_page": "History of slavery in Texas", "text_new": "{{For|modern-day trafficking|Human trafficking in Texas}}\n{{Texas History}}\n\nThe '''history of slavery in Texas''', as a colonial territory, then part of Mexico, later [[Republic of Texas|Republic]] in 1836, and [[U.S. state]] in 1845, had begun slowly, as the Spanish did not rely on it for labor during their years in [[Spanish Texas]].  The use of [[slavery]] expanded in the mid-nineteenth century as [[White American]] settlers, primarily from the [[Southeastern United States]], crossed the [[Mississippi River]] and brought slaves with them. [[Slavery in the Spanish New World colonies|Slavery]] was present in [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish America]] and [[Mexico]] prior to the arrival of American settlers, but it was not highly developed.\n\nThe issue of slavery became a source of contention between the Anglo-American (called that because they spoke English) settlers and Spanish governors.  The governors feared the growth in the Anglo-American population in Texas, and for various reasons, by the early 19th century, they and their superiors in Mexico City disapproved of expanding slavery.  In 1829 the [[Vicente Guerrero|Guerrero]] decree conditionally abolished slavery throughout Mexican territories.  It was a decision that increased tensions with slave-holders among the Anglo-Americans.\n\nAfter the [[Texas Revolution]] ended in 1836, the [[Constitution of the Republic of Texas]] made slavery legal. The [[Constitution of the Republic of Texas#General Provisions|General Provisions]] of the Constitution forbade any slave owner from freeing his slaves without the consent of Congress and forbade Congress from making any law that restricted the slave trade or emancipated slaves.\n\nAmericans of European extraction and slaves contributed greatly to the population growth in the [[Republic of Texas|Republic]] and [[State of Texas]]. Settlements grew and developed more land under cultivation in [[cotton]] and other commodities.  The cotton industry flourished in [[East Texas]], where enslaved labor became most widely used.  The central part of the state was dominated by [[subsistence economy|subsistence]] farmers.  Free and runaway blacks had great difficulty finding jobs in Texas.  Many worked in other parts of the state as [[cattle herding|cowboys herding cattle]] or [[animal migration|migrated]] for better opportunities in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], [[California]], or southward to Mexico.\n\n==Early slavery==\nThe first non-Native slave in Texas was [[Estevanico]], a [[Moors|Moor]] from North Africa who had been captured and enslaved by the Spanish when he was a child.<ref>Williams (1997), p. 1.</ref>  Estevanico accompanied his master Captain [[Andr\u00e9s Dorantes de Carranza]] on the [[Narv\u00e1ez expedition]], which landed at present-day Tampa.  Trying to get around the Gulf Coast, they built five barges, but in November 1528 these went aground off the coast of Texas.<ref>Barr (1996), p. 1.</ref>  Estevanico, Dorantes, and [[Alonso Castillo Maldonado]], the only survivors, spent several months living on a barrier island (now believed to be Galveston Island) before making their way in April 1529 to the mainland.<ref name=\"Donald E. Chipman, Estevanico\">[https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fes08 Donald E. Chipman, \"Estevanico\"], ''Handbook of Texas Online'', accessed 13 Aug 2009</ref> [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] captured and enslaved the party, putting them to work as laborers.  They survived with the help of Castillo's faith healing among the Indians.  Later they were joined by [[\u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca]].<ref name=\"Donald E. Chipman, Estevanico\"/>  Five years later, in September 1534, they escaped to the interior.  Although Estevanico was still enslaved, after these events the Spaniards treated him more as an equal. Later he was given leadership of a Spanish expedition.<ref>Barr (1996), p. 2.</ref>  His account, along with those of the others, led to more extensive Spanish exploration of the new territory.<ref>Williams (1997), p. 2.</ref>\n\n==Slavery in colonial times==\n{{main|Slavery in the Spanish New World colonies|Slavery in New France}}\n\nBoth the civil and religious authorities in [[Spanish Texas]] officially encouraged freeing slaves, but the laws were often ignored.<ref>Barr (1996), p. 5.</ref>  Beginning in the 1740s in the Southwest, when Spanish settlers [[Gen\u00edzaro|captured American Indian children]], they often had them baptized and \"adopted\" into the homes of townspeople.  There they were raised to be servants.  At first the practice involved primarily [[Apache]]s; eventually [[Comanche]] children were likewise adopted as servants.<ref name=delateja123/>\n\nImportation of enslaved Africans was not widespread in Spanish Texas.  In 1751, after three Frenchmen were found to have settled along the [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]] to trade with the American Indians, the Spanish arrested and expelled them from the colony.<ref name=barr13>Barr (1996), p. 13.</ref>  A 1777 census of [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] showed a total of 2,060&nbsp;people, with 151 of African descent.<ref name=williams4>Williams (1997), p. 4.</ref>  Of these, only 15 were slaves, 4&nbsp;male and 11&nbsp;females.<ref name=delateja123>de la Teja (1956), p. 123.</ref>  The 1783 census for all of Texas listed a total of 36&nbsp;slaves.<ref name=barr13/>  There was intermarriage among blacks, Indians and Europeans.  In 1792 there were 34 blacks and 414 [[mulatto]]s in Spanish Texas, some of whom were free men and women.

For a time, many slaves ran away to Texas.  Free blacks also emigrated to Texas.  Most escaped slaves joined friendly American Indian tribes, but others settled in the [[East Texas]] forests.<ref name=williams4/> When some French and Spanish slaveholders moved to Texas, they were allowed to retain their slaves.<ref name=barr14>Barr (1996), p. 14.</ref>  In 1809, the Commandant General of the Interior Provinces, [[Nemesio Salcedo]], ordered the Texas-Louisiana border to be closed to everyone, regardless of ethnic background.<ref>Almar\u00e1z, p. 35.</ref>  His nephew, governor of Texas [[Manuel Mar\u00eda de Salcedo]], interpreted the order as allowing slaveholders from the United States to enter Texas to reclaim runaway slaves.<ref>Almar\u00e1z, p. 29.</ref>\n\nThe United States [[Slavery in the United States|outlawed the importation of slaves]] in 1808, but domestic trade flourished, especially in [[New Orleans]] during the [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] decades.  In part due to the slave trade, New Orleans was the fourth largest city in the US in 1840 and one of the wealthiest. Between 1816 and 1821, [[Louis-Michel Aury]] and [[Jean Lafitte]] smuggled slaves into the United States through [[Galveston Island]].<ref name=barr14>Barr (1996), p. 14.</ref>  To encourage citizens to report unlawful activity, most southern states allowed anyone who informed on a slave trader to receive half of what the imported slaves would earn at auction.  The men sold slaves to [[James Bowie]] and others, who brought the slaves directly to a customhouse and informed on themselves.  The customs officers offered the slaves for auction, and Bowie would buy them back.  Due to the state laws, he would receive half of the price he had paid.  After that, he could legally transport the slaves and sell them in New Orleans or areas further up the [[Mississippi River]].<ref>Hopewell (1994), p. 19.</ref><ref name=edmondson91>Edmondson (2000), p. 91.</ref>\n\n==Mexican Texas==\n\nIn 1821 at the conclusion of the [[Mexican War of Independence]], Texas was included in the new nation.<ref>Chipman (1992), p. 239</ref>  That year, the American [[Stephen F. Austin]] was granted permission to bring Anglo settlers into Texas.<ref name=williams6>Williams (1997), p. 6.</ref>  Most of the settlers Austin recruited came from the southern slave-owning portions of the United States.<ref name=barr14/>  Under Austin's development scheme, each settler was allowed to purchase an additional {{convert|50|acres|ha|0}} of land for each slave he brought to the territory.<ref name=williams6/>  At the same time, however, Mexico offered full citizenship to free blacks, including land ownership and other privileges.  The province continued to attract free blacks and escaped slaves from the [[Southern United States]].  Favorable conditions for free blacks continued into the 1830s.<ref name=\"Douglas Hales, Free Blacks\"/>\n\nIn 1823, Mexico forbade the sale or purchase of slaves, and required that the children of slaves be freed when they reached age fourteen.<ref name=barr14/>  By 1825, however, a census of Austin's Colony showed 1,347 Anglo-Americans and 443&nbsp;people of African descent, including a small number of free Negroes.<ref name=williams6/>  In 1827, the legislature of [[Coahuila y Tejas]] outlawed the introduction of additional slaves and granted freedom at birth to all children born to a slave.<ref name=barr14/>\n\nIn 1829 Mexico abolished slavery, but it granted an exception until 1830 to Texas.  That year Mexico made the importation of slaves illegal.<ref name=barr14/> Anglo-American immigration to the province slowed at this point, with settlers angry about the changing rules.  To circumvent the law, numerous Anglo-American colonists converted their slaves to indentured servants, but with life terms.  Others simply called their slaves indentured servants without legally changing their status.<ref name=barr15>Barr (1996), p. 15.</ref>  Slaveholders trying to enter Mexico would force their slaves to sign contracts claiming that the slaves owed money and would work to pay the debt.  The low wages the slave would receive made repayment impossible, and the debt would be inherited, even though no slave would receive wages until age eighteen.<ref name=vazquez57>Vazquez (1997), p. 57.</ref>  In 1832 the state passed legislation prohibiting worker contracts from lasting more than ten&nbsp;years.<ref name=vazquez63>Vazquez (1997), p. 63.</ref>\n\nMany slaves who escaped from masters in Texas or in the United States joined various East Texas Indian tribes.  Although not considered equals in the tribes, they were generally treated well.  Many former slaves fought with the [[Cherokee]] against the Texan army that drove the tribe from East Texas in 1838.<ref name=barr28>Barr (1996), p. 28.</ref>  Slaves often fought against the [[Comanche]] tribe, however.  The Comanche indiscriminately killed slaves and their white masters  during raids.  The Comanche sold any captured slaves to the Cherokee and Creek in [[Indian Territory]], as they were both slave-holding tribes.<ref name=barr29>Barr (1996), p. 29.</ref>\n\nBy the 1800s, most slaves in Texas had been brought by slaveholders from the United States.<ref name=\"barr15\"/>  A small number of slaves were imported illegally from the [[West Indies]] or Africa.  In the 1830s, the British consul estimated that approximately 500&nbsp;slaves had been illegally imported into Texas.<ref>Barr (1996), p. 16.</ref>  By 1836, there were approximately 5,000 slaves in Texas.<ref name=barr17>Barr (1996), p. 17.</ref>\n\nExportation in the slave-owning areas of the state surpassed that of the non-slave-owning areas. A survey of Texas in 1834 found that the department of Bexar, which was mostly made up of Tejanos, had exported no goods. The Brazos department, including Austin's colonies and those of Green DeWitt, had exported 600,000 pesos worth of goods, including 5,000 bales of cotton.<ref name=delateja91>de la Teja (1997), p. 91.</ref>  The department of Texas, which included the eastern settlements, expected to export 2,000 bales of cotton and 5,000 head of cattle.<ref name=delateja92>de la Teja (1997), p. 92.</ref>\n\nThe abolition of slavery created tensions between the Mexican government and slave-holding settlers from the United States.  These tensions came to a head in the [[Anahuac Disturbances]].  In August 1831, [[Juan Davis Bradburn]], the military commander of the custom station on [[Galveston Bay|Upper Galveston Bay]], gave asylum to two men who had escaped from slavery in [[Louisiana]].  The slave owner hired [[William Barret Travis]], a local lawyer, in an attempt to retrieve the men.  When Bradburn arrested Travis on suspicion of plotting an insurrection, settlers rebelled.  The disturbances were resolved through a combination of arms and political maneuvering.  One result was the [[Turtle Bayou Resolutions]], which were an explanation of the grievances that had led to the disturbances.  One of the resolutions challenged Bradburn for \"advising and procuring servants to quit the service of their masters, and offering them protection; causing them to labor for his benefits, and refusing to compensate them for the same.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n==Republic==\nAs the [[Texas Revolution]] began in 1835, some slaves sided with Mexico, which provided for freedom.  In the fall of 1835, a group of almost 100&nbsp;slaves staged an uprising along the [[Brazos River]] after they heard rumors of approaching Mexican troops.  Whites in the area defeated and severely punished them.  Several slaves ran away to serve with Mexican forces.  Texan forces executed one runaway slave taken prisoner and resold another into slavery.<ref name=barr32>Barr (1996), p. 32.</ref>  Other slaves joined the Texan forces, with some killed while fighting Mexican soldiers.  Three slaves were known to be at the [[Battle of the Alamo]]; a boy named John was killed, while [[William B. Travis|William B. Travis's]] slave Joe and James Bowie's slave Sam survived to be freed by the Mexican Army.<ref name=barr6>Barr (1996), p. 6.</ref>\n\nThe Section 9 of the [[Constitution of the Republic of Texas#General Provisions|General Provisions]] of the Constitution of the Republic of Texas, ratified in 1836, made slavery legal again in Texas and defined the status of slaves and people of color in the Republic of Texas.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Laws of Texas, 1822-1897 Volume 1|last = Gammel|first = Hans Peter Mareus Neilsen|publisher = |year = 1898|isbn = |location = |pages = 1087}}</ref> \n* People of color who had been servants for life under Mexican law would become property.\n* [[Texas Congress|Congress]] should pass no law restricting emigrants from bring their slaves into Texas.\n* Congress shall not have the power to emancipate slaves.\n* Slaveowners may not free their slaves without Congressional approval unless the freed slaves leave Texas.\n* Free persons of African descent were required to petition the [[Texas Congress]] for permission to continue living in the country.  \n* Africans and the descendants of Africans and Indians were excluded from the class of 'persons' having rights.\nThe following year all those who had been living in Texas at the time of independence were allowed to remain.  On the other hand, the legislature created political [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]]; it classified free residents with at least 1/8 African heritage (the equivalent to one great-grandparent) as a separate category, and abrogated their citizens' rights, prohibiting them from voting, owning property, testifying against whites in court, or intermarrying with whites.<ref name=\"barr8\">Barr (1996), p. 8.</ref>  As planters increased cotton production, they rapidly increased the purchase and transport of slaves.  By 1840 there were 11,323 slaves in Texas.<ref name=\"barr17\" />\n\n==Statehood==\n\nIn 1845 the state legislature passed legislation further restricting the rights of free blacks.  For example, it subjected them to punishments, such as working on road gangs if convicted of crimes, similar to those of slaves rather than free men.<ref name=barr9>Barr (1996), p. 9.</ref>\n\nBy 1850, the slave population in Texas had increased to 58,161; in 1860 there were 182,566 slaves, 30 percent of the total population.  In 1860 almost 25 percent of all white families in Texas owned at least one slave.  Texas ranked 10th in total slave population and 9th in percentage of slave population (30 percent of all residents).<ref name=barr17/>\n\nForty percent of Texas slaves lived on plantations along the [[Gulf Coast]] and in the East Texas river valleys, where they cultivated cotton, corn, and some sugar.<ref name=barr17/>  Fifty percent of the slaves worked either alone or in groups of fewer than 20 on small farms ranging from the [[Nueces River]] to the [[Red River of the South|Red River]], and from the Louisiana border to the edge of the western settlements of San Antonio, [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], and [[Fort Worth]].<ref name=barr19>Barr (1996), p. 19.</ref>  Some slaves lived among the cattlemen along the southern Gulf Coast and helped herd sheep and cattle.  Rarely, a slave also broke horses, but generally only white men were used for that dangerous task.  If they died, the boss did not suffer a monetary loss.<ref name=barr20>Barr (1996), p. 20.</ref>  Slaves were not held between the Nueces River and the [[Rio Grande]].  A large supply of cheap Mexican labor in the area made the purchase and care of a slave too expensive.<ref name=barr20/>\n\nAlthough most slaves lived in rural areas, more than 1000 resided in both Galveston and [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] by 1860, with several hundred in other large towns.<ref name=barr24>Barr (1996), p. 24.</ref>  Unlike in most southern cities, the number of urban slaves in Texas grew throughout the 1850s.  Most worked as house servants or on farms on the edges of towns, but others served as cooks and waiters in hotels, as [[teamster]]s or boatmen, or as coachmen and skilled artisans, such as [[blacksmith]]s, carpenters, and barbers.<ref name=barr24>Barr (1996), p. 24.</ref>\n\nPlantation slaves generally lived in one or two-room log cabins.  Most field hands received two sets of clothing twice each year, with a hat and coat for winter.  Meals often consisted of bread, molasses, sweet potatoes, hominy, and beef, chicken, and pork.<ref name=barr18>Barr (1996), p. 18.</ref>  Slaves often lived similarly to the whites in Texas, especially those new to the territory and just getting started.  The whites, however, could hope to improve their lives with their own hard work, while the slaves could have no such hope or expectation as, of course, their work belonged by law to their owners and not to them.<ref name=barr20/>\n\nMany churches in Texas accepted slaves as members.  Both the [[Baptist]] and [[United Methodist|Methodist]] churches appointed missionaries to the slaves and allowed active participation by them.  In 1860, the Methodists claimed 7,541&nbsp;slaves among their members in Texas.  Some slaves became ministers, but their masters often tried to instruct them in what they were supposed to preach.  As in other southern states, however, the slaves made Christianity their own and they developed strong religious faith.<ref name=barr22>Barr (1996), p. 22.</ref>\n\nMany local communities adopted laws forbidding slaves from having liquor or weapons, from selling agricultural products, hiring their own time, or being hired by free blacks.  In rural areas, counties often set up patrols to enforce restrictions on slaves' traveling without passes from planter owners.<ref name=barr21>Barr (1996), p. 21.</ref>  Urban slaves often had greater freedoms and opportunity.<ref name=barr25>Barr (1996), p. 25.</ref> Unlike most southern states, Texas did not explicitly ban education of slaves, but most slave owners did not allow the practice.  In 1865, 95% of the slaves were illiterate.<ref name=barr23>Barr (1996), p. 23.</ref>\n\nMany slaves ran away.  Some hid in the bayous for a time, while others lived among the Indians, and a few managed to board ships bound for northern or foreign ports.  Most runaway slaves attempted to go to Mexico.<ref name=barr28>Barr (1996), p. 28.</ref>  By 1850, an estimated 3,000&nbsp;slaves had successfully escaped to Mexico, and an additional 1,000 crossed into Mexico between 1851 and 1855.  Ninety percent of the runaways were men, most between ages 20 and 40, because they were best equipped to deal with the long, difficult journey.  All ages were represented, however, from 5&nbsp;months to 60&nbsp;years.<ref name=barr30>Barr (1996), p. 30.</ref>  As early as 1836, Texas slaveholders sent representatives to [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]] to try to reclaim their runaway slaves, but Mexico refused.<ref name=barr31/>\n\nA group of slaves killed the sheriff of [[Gonzales, Texas|Gonzales]] when he attempted to stop their going to Matamoros.  Over 30 of the fugitives made it safely to freedom in Mexico.<ref name=barr29>Barr (1996), p. 29.</ref>  From 1849 until 1860, Texas tried to convince the United States government to negotiate a treaty with Mexico to permit extradition of runaway slaves, but it did not succeed.  Some slave hunters illegally traveled to Mexico and captured runaways.  After [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Carvajal]] promised to return all escaped slaves, more than 400&nbsp;Texans joined his revolt of 1851.  He tried to create a Republic of Sierra Madre in Northern Mexico but was defeated by the Mexican Army.<ref name=barr31>Barr (1996), p. 31.</ref>\n\nWhite Texans were fearful about slave revolts, and as in other southern states, rumors of uprisings took hold rapidly, often in times of economic and social tension.  In 1854, citizens in Austin and other towns drove many poor Mexicans from the area in fear that they might assist in slave revolts.<ref name=barr26>Barr (1996), p. 26.</ref>  Two years later, [[Colorado County, Texas|Colorado County]] hanged several slaves and drove one white man and several Mexicans from the area after uncovering a plot to equip 200&nbsp;slaves with pistols and knives to escape into Mexico.\n\nIn 1860, mass hysteria ensued after a series of fires erupted throughout the state.  Planters had hundreds of slaves arrested and questioned forcefully.  Several confessed to a plot by white [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] to avenge [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown's]] execution by burning food supplies and poisoning slaveowners.  Up to 80&nbsp;slaves and 37&nbsp;whites may have been executed as a result of the supposed plot.<ref name=barr33>Barr (1996), p. 33.</ref>  Later newspaper accounts revealed that most of what was confessed under torture appeared to be false.  Many of the fires had coincided with a summer drought, and new matches were susceptible to spontaneous combustion. The supposed \"poison\" found in slave quarters was [[baby powder]].<ref name=barr34>Barr (1996), p. 34.</ref>\nThere was a slave auction block next to the Menger Hotel and near the Alamo.<ref>Express Newspaper, 1939, [[University of Texas at San Antonio]] archives</ref>{{Verify source|date=November 2013}}\n\n==Confederacy==\nTexas seceded from the United States in 1861, and joined the [[Confederate States of America]] during the [[American Civil War]].  It replaced the pro-Union [[Governor of Texas|governor]], [[Sam Houston]], in the process.  During the war, slavery in Texas was little affected, and prices for slaves remained high until the last few months of the war.  The number of slaves in the state increased dramatically as the [[Union Army]] occupied parts of [[Arkansas]] and Louisiana.  Slaveholders in those areas often moved their slaves to Texas to avoid having them emancipated.  By 1865 there were an estimated 250,000&nbsp;slaves in Texas.  Many planters, however, lost part of their workforce temporarily to the [[Confederate Army]], which impressed one-quarter of the slaves on each plantation to construct defensive earthworks for the Texas coast and to drive military supply wagons.<ref name=barr36>Barr (1996), p. 36.</ref>  Anyone convicted of providing arms to slaves during the war was sentenced to between two and five years of hard labor.<ref name=barr36/>\n\nUnlike in other Southern states, only a small number of Texas slaves, estimated at 47, joined the Union Army.  Few battles took place in Texas, which acted as a supply state to the Confederacy.  As Texas was much more distant from the Union Army lines for much of the war, slaves were unable to reach them.<ref name=barr37>Barr (1996), p. 37.</ref>  The last battle of the war was fought at [[Battle of Palmito Ranch|Palmito Ranch]] (near Brownsville, TX) in 1865.\n\n==Emancipation==\nOn June 19, 1865, Union General [[Gordon Granger]] and over 2,000 federal troops arrived at [[Galveston Island]] to take possession of the state and enforce the two-year-old [[Emancipation Proclamation]].  There, he proclaimed his \"General Order No. 3\" on the balcony of [[Ashton Villa]]:\n\n<blockquote>The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor. The freedmen are advised to remain quietly at their present homes and work for wages. They are informed that they will not be allowed to collect at military posts and that they will not be supported in idleness either there or elsewhere.<ref name=\"TXJ19\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/ref/abouttx/juneteenth.html |title=Juneteenth |work=State of Texas website |accessdate=2006-07-06}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn some plantations, many slaves left immediately after hearing of the emancipation, even if their former owners offered to pay them wages.<ref name=barr40>Barr (1996), p. 40.</ref>  Throughout the summer, many East Texas newspapers continued to recommend that slaveholders oppose ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], which abolished slavery, in the hopes that emancipation could be gradually implemented.  Some slaveowners did not free their slaves until late in 1865.<ref name=barr39>Barr (1996), p. 39.</ref>\n\nSlavery was officially abolished by the Thirteenth Amendment which took effect on December 18, 1865.  Slavery had been theoretically abolished by President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[Emancipation Proclamation]] which proclaimed, in 1863, that only slaves located in territories that were in rebellion from the United States were free. Since the U.S. government was not in effective control of many of these territories until later in the war, many of these slaves proclaimed to be free by the Emancipation Proclamation were still held in servitude until those areas came back under Union control.\n\n==Legacy==\n{{further|History of African Americans in Texas}}\n\nJune 19, the day of the Emancipation announcement, has been celebrated annually in Texas and other states as [[Juneteenth]].\n\nThe long-term effects of slavery can be seen to this day in the state's demographics.  The eastern quarter of the state, where cotton production depended on thousands of slaves, is considered the westernmost extension of the [[Deep South]].  It contains a very significant number of Texas' African-American population.  On the other hand, western parts of Texas were still a frontier during the [[American Civil War]].  While settled chiefly by [[English American|Anglo]]-Southerners after the war; with the history of ranching, some of these parts have been more associated with the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] than the [[Southern United States|South]].\n\nAfter whites regained power in Texas and other southern states in the 1870s, they imposed a system of legalized [[racial segregation]] and [[white supremacy]].  In 1876 Texas adopted a new constitution requiring segregated schools and imposing a poll tax, which decreased the number of poor voters both black and white.<ref>[http://tshaonline.com \"1876 Constitution\"], ''Handbook of Texas Online'', accessed 12 Apr 2008</ref>  By the late 19th century, Texas passed other [[Jim Crow laws]].  The system of school support was inadequate, and schools for racial minorities were seriously underfunded. Texas did not, however, employ techniques common in other Southern states such as complex voter registration rules and literacy tests; even the \"white primary\" was not implemented statewide until 1923.<ref>Donald S. Strong, \"The Rise of Negro Voting in Texas,\" American Political Science Review Vol. 42 (June, 1948): 510, 511-12.</ref>\n\nIn 1900 African Americans comprised 30% of the state's population of 3,084,710.<ref>[http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php Historical Census Browser, 1900 US Census, University of Virginia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823030234/http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php |date=2007-08-23 }}, accessed 15 Mar 2008</ref>  The drop in proportion of population reflected greatly-increased European immigration to the state in the 19th century, as well as population growth.\n\nLike [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], the Texas Democratic Party adopted a [[white primaries|whites-only primary]].  Since they politically dominated the state for decades after 1900, the only contest for office was at the primary level.  The white primary was another way to exclude African Americans from making electoral decisions, and it was not overturned by the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] until 1944 in ''[[Smith v. Allwright]]''.  States that had used it adopted other means to keep most African Americans from voting.\n\nAfrican Americans immediately started raising legal challenges to disfranchisement, but early Supreme Court cases, such as ''[[Giles v. Harris]]'' (1903), upheld the states.  Through organizations such as the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] ([[NAACP]]), African Americans continued to work to regain their ability to exercise their civil and voting rights as citizens. The [[civil rights movement]] led to the U.S. Congress and President [[Lyndon Johnson]] passing the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965, which protected the rights of all citizens to integrated public facilities and enforcement of voting rights.\n\nOn June 25, 2013, the U.S. [[Shelby County v.

The use of [[slavery]] expanded in the mid-nineteenth century as [[British-American]] settlers, primarily from the [[Southeastern United States]], crossed the [[Mississippi River]] and brought slaves with them. [[Slavery in the Spanish New World colonies|Slavery]] was present in [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish America]] and [[Mexico]] prior to the arrival of American settlers, but it was not highly developed.\n\nThe issue of slavery became a source of contention between the Anglo-American (called that because they spoke English) settlers and Spanish governors.  The governors feared the growth in the Anglo-American population in Texas, and for various reasons, by the early 19th century, they and their superiors in Mexico City disapproved of expanding slavery.  In 1829 the [[Vicente Guerrero|Guerrero]] decree conditionally abolished slavery throughout Mexican territories.  It was a decision that increased tensions with slave-holders among the Anglo-Americans.\n\nAfter the [[Texas Revolution]] ended in 1836, the [[Constitution of the Republic of Texas]] made slavery legal. The [[Constitution of the Republic of Texas#General Provisions|General Provisions]] of the Constitution forbade any slave owner from freeing his slaves without the consent of Congress and forbade Congress from making any law that restricted the slave trade or emancipated slaves.\n\nAmericans of European extraction and slaves contributed greatly to the population growth in the [[Republic of Texas|Republic]] and [[State of Texas]]. Settlements grew and developed more land under cultivation in [[cotton]] and other commodities.  The cotton industry flourished in [[East Texas]], where enslaved labor became most widely used.  The central part of the state was dominated by [[subsistence economy|subsistence]] farmers.  Free and runaway blacks had great difficulty finding jobs in Texas.  Many worked in other parts of the state as [[cattle herding|cowboys herding cattle]] or [[animal migration|migrated]] for better opportunities in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], [[California]], or southward to Mexico.\n\n==Early slavery==\nThe first non-Native slave in Texas was [[Estevanico]], a [[Moors|Moor]] from North Africa who had been captured and enslaved by the Spanish when he was a child.<ref>Williams (1997), p. 1.</ref>  Estevanico accompanied his master Captain [[Andr\u00e9s Dorantes de Carranza]] on the [[Narv\u00e1ez expedition]], which landed at present-day Tampa.  Trying to get around the Gulf Coast, they built five barges, but in November 1528 these went aground off the coast of Texas.<ref>Barr (1996), p. 1.</ref>  Estevanico, Dorantes, and [[Alonso Castillo Maldonado]], the only survivors, spent several months living on a barrier island (now believed to be Galveston Island) before making their way in April 1529 to the mainland.<ref name=\"Donald E. Chipman, Estevanico\">[https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fes08 Donald E. Chipman, \"Estevanico\"], ''Handbook of Texas Online'', accessed 13 Aug 2009</ref> [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] captured and enslaved the party, putting them to work as laborers.  They survived with the help of Castillo's faith healing among the Indians.  Later they were joined by [[\u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca]].<ref name=\"Donald E. Chipman, Estevanico\"/>  Five years later, in September 1534, they escaped to the interior.  Although Estevanico was still enslaved, after these events the Spaniards treated him more as an equal. Later he was given leadership of a Spanish expedition.<ref>Barr (1996), p. 2.</ref>  His account, along with those of the others, led to more extensive Spanish exploration of the new territory.<ref>Williams (1997), p. 2.</ref>\n\n==Slavery in colonial times==\n{{main|Slavery in the Spanish New World colonies|Slavery in New France}}\n\nBoth the civil and religious authorities in [[Spanish Texas]] officially encouraged freeing slaves, but the laws were often ignored.<ref>Barr (1996), p. 5.</ref>  Beginning in the 1740s in the Southwest, when Spanish settlers [[Gen\u00edzaro|captured American Indian children]], they often had them baptized and \"adopted\" into the homes of townspeople.  There they were raised to be servants.  At first the practice involved primarily [[Apache]]s; eventually [[Comanche]] children were likewise adopted as servants.<ref name=delateja123/>\n\nImportation of enslaved Africans was not widespread in Spanish Texas.  In 1751, after three Frenchmen were found to have settled along the [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]] to trade with the American Indians, the Spanish arrested and expelled them from the colony.<ref name=barr13>Barr (1996), p. 13.</ref>  A 1777 census of [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] showed a total of 2,060&nbsp;people, with 151 of African descent.<ref name=williams4>Williams (1997), p. 4.</ref>  Of these, only 15 were slaves, 4&nbsp;male and 11&nbsp;females.<ref name=delateja123>de la Teja (1956), p. 123.</ref>  The 1783 census for all of Texas listed a total of 36&nbsp;slaves.<ref name=barr13/>  There was intermarriage among blacks, Indians and Europeans.  In 1792 there were 34 blacks and 414 [[mulatto]]s in Spanish Texas, some of whom were free men and women.  This was 15 percent of the total 2,992 people living in Spanish Texas.<ref name=\"Douglas Hales, Free Blacks\">[https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/pkfbs Douglas Hales, \"Free Blacks\"], ''Handbook of Texas Online'', accessed 12 Aug 2009</ref>\n\nWhen the United States [[Louisiana Purchase|purchased Louisiana]] in 1803, Spain declared that any slave who crossed the [[Sabine River (Texas\u2013Louisiana)|Sabine River]] into Texas would be automatically freed.  For a time, many slaves ran away to Texas.  Free blacks also emigrated to Texas.  Most escaped slaves joined friendly American Indian tribes, but others settled in the [[East Texas]] forests.<ref name=williams4/> When some French and Spanish slaveholders moved to Texas, they were allowed to retain their slaves.<ref name=barr14>Barr (1996), p. 14.</ref>  In 1809, the Commandant General of the Interior Provinces, [[Nemesio Salcedo]], ordered the Texas-Louisiana border to be closed to everyone, regardless of ethnic background.<ref>Almar\u00e1z, p. 35.</ref>  His nephew, governor of Texas [[Manuel Mar\u00eda de Salcedo]], interpreted the order as allowing slaveholders from the United States to enter Texas to reclaim runaway slaves.<ref>Almar\u00e1z, p. 29.</ref>\n\nThe United States [[Slavery in the United States|outlawed the importation of slaves]] in 1808, but domestic trade flourished, especially in [[New Orleans]] during the [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] decades.  In part due to the slave trade, New Orleans was the fourth largest city in the US in 1840 and one of the wealthiest. Between 1816 and 1821, [[Louis-Michel Aury]] and [[Jean Lafitte]] smuggled slaves into the United States through [[Galveston Island]].<ref name=barr14>Barr (1996), p. 14.</ref>  To encourage citizens to report unlawful activity, most southern states allowed anyone who informed on a slave trader to receive half of what the imported slaves would earn at auction.  The men sold slaves to [[James Bowie]] and others, who brought the slaves directly to a customhouse and informed on themselves.  The customs officers offered the slaves for auction, and Bowie would buy them back.  Due to the state laws, he would receive half of the price he had paid.  After that, he could legally transport the slaves and sell them in New Orleans or areas further up the [[Mississippi River]].<ref>Hopewell (1994), p. 19.</ref><ref name=edmondson91>Edmondson (2000), p. 91.</ref>\n\n==Mexican Texas==\n\nIn 1821 at the conclusion of the [[Mexican War of Independence]], Texas was included in the new nation.<ref>Chipman (1992), p. 239</ref>  That year, the American [[Stephen F. Austin]] was granted permission to bring Anglo settlers into Texas.<ref name=williams6>Williams (1997), p. 6.</ref>  Most of the settlers Austin recruited came from the southern slave-owning portions of the United States.<ref name=barr14/>  Under Austin's development scheme, each settler was allowed to purchase an additional {{convert|50|acres|ha|0}} of land for each slave he brought to the territory.<ref name=williams6/>  At the same time, however, Mexico offered full citizenship to free blacks, including land ownership and other privileges.  The province continued to attract free blacks and escaped slaves from the [[Southern United States]].  Favorable conditions for free blacks continued into the 1830s.<ref name=\"Douglas Hales, Free Blacks\"/>\n\nIn 1823, Mexico forbade the sale or purchase of slaves, and required that the children of slaves be freed when they reached age fourteen.<ref name=barr14/>  By 1825, however, a census of Austin's Colony showed 1,347 Anglo-Americans and 443&nbsp;people of African descent, including a small number of free Negroes.<ref name=williams6/>  In 1827, the legislature of [[Coahuila y Tejas]] outlawed the introduction of additional slaves and granted freedom at birth to all children born to a slave.<ref name=barr14/>\n\nIn 1829 Mexico abolished slavery, but it granted an exception until 1830 to Texas.  That year Mexico made the importation of slaves illegal.<ref name=barr14/> Anglo-American immigration to the province slowed at this point, with settlers angry about the changing rules.  To circumvent the law, numerous Anglo-American colonists converted their slaves to indentured servants, but with life terms.  Others simply called their slaves indentured servants without legally changing their status.<ref name=barr15>Barr (1996), p. 15.</ref>  Slaveholders trying to enter Mexico would force their slaves to sign contracts claiming that the slaves owed money and would work to pay the debt.  The low wages the slave would receive made repayment impossible, and the debt would be inherited, even though no slave would receive wages until age eighteen.<ref name=vazquez57>Vazquez (1997), p. 57.</ref>  In 1832 the state passed legislation prohibiting worker contracts from lasting more than ten&nbsp;years.<ref name=vazquez63>Vazquez (1997), p. 63.</ref>\n\nMany slaves who escaped from masters in Texas or in the United States joined various East Texas Indian tribes.  Although not considered equals in the tribes, they were generally treated well.  Many former slaves fought with the [[Cherokee]] against the Texan army that drove the tribe from East Texas in 1838.<ref name=barr28>Barr (1996), p. 28.</ref>  Slaves often fought against the [[Comanche]] tribe, however.  The Comanche indiscriminately killed slaves and their white masters  during raids.  The Comanche sold any captured slaves to the Cherokee and Creek in [[Indian Territory]], as they were both slave-holding tribes.<ref name=barr29>Barr (1996), p. 29.</ref>\n\nBy the 1800s, most slaves in Texas had been brought by slaveholders from the United States.<ref name=\"barr15\"/>  A small number of slaves were imported illegally from the [[West Indies]] or Africa.  In the 1830s, the British consul estimated that approximately 500&nbsp;slaves had been illegally imported into Texas.<ref>Barr (1996), p. 16.</ref>  By 1836, there were approximately 5,000 slaves in Texas.<ref name=barr17>Barr (1996), p. 17.</ref>\n\nExportation in the slave-owning areas of the state surpassed that of the non-slave-owning areas. A survey of Texas in 1834 found that the department of Bexar, which was mostly made up of Tejanos, had exported no goods. The Brazos department, including Austin's colonies and those of Green DeWitt, had exported 600,000 pesos worth of goods, including 5,000 bales of cotton.<ref name=delateja91>de la Teja (1997), p. 91.</ref>  The department of Texas, which included the eastern settlements, expected to export 2,000 bales of cotton and 5,000 head of cattle.<ref name=delateja92>de la Teja (1997), p. 92.</ref>\n\nThe abolition of slavery created tensions between the Mexican government and slave-holding settlers from the United States.  These tensions came to a head in the [[Anahuac Disturbances]].  In August 1831, [[Juan Davis Bradburn]], the military commander of the custom station on [[Galveston Bay|Upper Galveston Bay]], gave asylum to two men who had escaped from slavery in [[Louisiana]].  The slave owner hired [[William Barret Travis]], a local lawyer, in an attempt to retrieve the men.  When Bradburn arrested Travis on suspicion of plotting an insurrection, settlers rebelled.  The disturbances were resolved through a combination of arms and political maneuvering.  One result was the [[Turtle Bayou Resolutions]], which were an explanation of the grievances that had led to the disturbances.  One of the resolutions challenged Bradburn for \"advising and procuring servants to quit the service of their masters, and offering them protection; causing them to labor for his benefits, and refusing to compensate them for the same.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n==Republic==\nAs the [[Texas Revolution]] began in 1835, some slaves sided with Mexico, which provided for freedom.  In the fall of 1835, a group of almost 100&nbsp;slaves staged an uprising along the [[Brazos River]] after they heard rumors of approaching Mexican troops.  Whites in the area defeated and severely punished them.  Several slaves ran away to serve with Mexican forces.  Texan forces executed one runaway slave taken prisoner and resold another into slavery.<ref name=barr32>Barr (1996), p. 32.</ref>  Other slaves joined the Texan forces, with some killed while fighting Mexican soldiers.  Three slaves were known to be at the [[Battle of the Alamo]]; a boy named John was killed, while [[William B. Travis|William B. Travis's]] slave Joe and James Bowie's slave Sam survived to be freed by the Mexican Army.<ref name=barr6>Barr (1996), p. 6.</ref>\n\nThe Section 9 of the [[Constitution of the Republic of Texas#General Provisions|General Provisions]] of the Constitution of the Republic of Texas, ratified in 1836, made slavery legal again in Texas and defined the status of slaves and people of color in the Republic of Texas.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Laws of Texas, 1822-1897 Volume 1|last = Gammel|first = Hans Peter Mareus Neilsen|publisher = |year = 1898|isbn = |location = |pages = 1087}}</ref> \n* People of color who had been servants for life under Mexican law would become property.\n* [[Texas Congress|Congress]] should pass no law restricting emigrants from bring their slaves into Texas.\n* Congress shall not have the power to emancipate slaves.\n* Slaveowners may not free their slaves without Congressional approval unless the freed slaves leave Texas.\n* Free persons of African descent were required to petition the [[Texas Congress]] for permission to continue living in the country.  \n* Africans and the descendants of Africans and Indians were excluded from the class of 'persons' having rights.\nThe following year all those who had been living in Texas at the time of independence were allowed to remain.  On the other hand, the legislature created political [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]]; it classified free residents with at least 1/8 African heritage (the equivalent to one great-grandparent) as a separate category, and abrogated their citizens' rights, prohibiting them from voting, owning property, testifying against whites in court, or intermarrying with whites.<ref name=\"barr8\">Barr (1996), p. 8.</ref>  As planters increased cotton production, they rapidly increased the purchase and transport of slaves.  By 1840 there were 11,323 slaves in Texas.<ref name=\"barr17\" />\n\n==Statehood==\n\nIn 1845 the state legislature passed legislation further restricting the rights of free blacks.  For example, it subjected them to punishments, such as working on road gangs if convicted of crimes, similar to those of slaves rather than free men.<ref name=barr9>Barr (1996), p. 9.</ref>\n\nBy 1850, the slave population in Texas had increased to 58,161; in 1860 there were 182,566 slaves, 30 percent of the total population.  In 1860 almost 25 percent of all white families in Texas owned at least one slave.  Texas ranked 10th in total slave population and 9th in percentage of slave population (30 percent of all residents).<ref name=barr17/>\n\nForty percent of Texas slaves lived on plantations along the [[Gulf Coast]] and in the East Texas river valleys, where they cultivated cotton, corn, and some sugar.<ref name=barr17/>  Fifty percent of the slaves worked either alone or in groups of fewer than 20 on small farms ranging from the [[Nueces River]] to the [[Red River of the South|Red River]], and from the Louisiana border to the edge of the western settlements of San Antonio, [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], and [[Fort Worth]].<ref name=barr19>Barr (1996), p. 19.</ref>  Some slaves lived among the cattlemen along the southern Gulf Coast and helped herd sheep and cattle.  Rarely, a slave also broke horses, but generally only white men were used for that dangerous task.  If they died, the boss did not suffer a monetary loss.<ref name=barr20>Barr (1996), p. 20.</ref>  Slaves were not held between the Nueces River and the [[Rio Grande]].  A large supply of cheap Mexican labor in the area made the purchase and care of a slave too expensive.<ref name=barr20/>\n\nAlthough most slaves lived in rural areas, more than 1000 resided in both Galveston and [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] by 1860, with several hundred in other large towns.<ref name=barr24>Barr (1996), p. 24.</ref>  Unlike in most southern cities, the number of urban slaves in Texas grew throughout the 1850s.  Most worked as house servants or on farms on the edges of towns, but others served as cooks and waiters in hotels, as [[teamster]]s or boatmen, or as coachmen and skilled artisans, such as [[blacksmith]]s, carpenters, and barbers.<ref name=barr24>Barr (1996), p. 24.</ref>\n\nPlantation slaves generally lived in one or two-room log cabins.  Most field hands received two sets of clothing twice each year, with a hat and coat for winter.  Meals often consisted of bread, molasses, sweet potatoes, hominy, and beef, chicken, and pork.<ref name=barr18>Barr (1996), p. 18.</ref>  Slaves often lived similarly to the whites in Texas, especially those new to the territory and just getting started.  The whites, however, could hope to improve their lives with their own hard work, while the slaves could have no such hope or expectation as, of course, their work belonged by law to their owners and not to them.<ref name=barr20/>\n\nMany churches in Texas accepted slaves as members.  Both the [[Baptist]] and [[United Methodist|Methodist]] churches appointed missionaries to the slaves and allowed active participation by them.  In 1860, the Methodists claimed 7,541&nbsp;slaves among their members in Texas.  Some slaves became ministers, but their masters often tried to instruct them in what they were supposed to preach.  As in other southern states, however, the slaves made Christianity their own and they developed strong religious faith.<ref name=barr22>Barr (1996), p. 22.</ref>\n\nMany local communities adopted laws forbidding slaves from having liquor or weapons, from selling agricultural products, hiring their own time, or being hired by free blacks.  In rural areas, counties often set up patrols to enforce restrictions on slaves' traveling without passes from planter owners.<ref name=barr21>Barr (1996), p. 21.</ref>  Urban slaves often had greater freedoms and opportunity.<ref name=barr25>Barr (1996), p. 25.</ref> Unlike most southern states, Texas did not explicitly ban education of slaves, but most slave owners did not allow the practice.  In 1865, 95% of the slaves were illiterate.<ref name=barr23>Barr (1996), p. 23.</ref>\n\nMany slaves ran away.  Some hid in the bayous for a time, while others lived among the Indians, and a few managed to board ships bound for northern or foreign ports.  Most runaway slaves attempted to go to Mexico.<ref name=barr28>Barr (1996), p. 28.</ref>  By 1850, an estimated 3,000&nbsp;slaves had successfully escaped to Mexico, and an additional 1,000 crossed into Mexico between 1851 and 1855.  Ninety percent of the runaways were men, most between ages 20 and 40, because they were best equipped to deal with the long, difficult journey.  All ages were represented, however, from 5&nbsp;months to 60&nbsp;years.<ref name=barr30>Barr (1996), p. 30.</ref>  As early as 1836, Texas slaveholders sent representatives to [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]] to try to reclaim their runaway slaves, but Mexico refused.<ref name=barr31/>\n\nA group of slaves killed the sheriff of [[Gonzales, Texas|Gonzales]] when he attempted to stop their going to Matamoros.  Over 30 of the fugitives made it safely to freedom in Mexico.<ref name=barr29>Barr (1996), p. 29.</ref>  From 1849 until 1860, Texas tried to convince the United States government to negotiate a treaty with Mexico to permit extradition of runaway slaves, but it did not succeed.  Some slave hunters illegally traveled to Mexico and captured runaways.  After [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Carvajal]] promised to return all escaped slaves, more than 400&nbsp;Texans joined his revolt of 1851.  He tried to create a Republic of Sierra Madre in Northern Mexico but was defeated by the Mexican Army.<ref name=barr31>Barr (1996), p. 31.</ref>\n\nWhite Texans were fearful about slave revolts, and as in other southern states, rumors of uprisings took hold rapidly, often in times of economic and social tension.  In 1854, citizens in Austin and other towns drove many poor Mexicans from the area in fear that they might assist in slave revolts.<ref name=barr26>Barr (1996), p. 26.</ref>  Two years later, [[Colorado County, Texas|Colorado County]] hanged several slaves and drove one white man and several Mexicans from the area after uncovering a plot to equip 200&nbsp;slaves with pistols and knives to escape into Mexico.\n\nIn 1860, mass hysteria ensued after a series of fires erupted throughout the state.  Planters had hundreds of slaves arrested and questioned forcefully.  Several confessed to a plot by white [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] to avenge [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown's]] execution by burning food supplies and poisoning slaveowners.  Up to 80&nbsp;slaves and 37&nbsp;whites may have been executed as a result of the supposed plot.<ref name=barr33>Barr (1996), p. 33.</ref>  Later newspaper accounts revealed that most of what was confessed under torture appeared to be false.  Many of the fires had coincided with a summer drought, and new matches were susceptible to spontaneous combustion. The supposed \"poison\" found in slave quarters was [[baby powder]].<ref name=barr34>Barr (1996), p. 34.</ref>\nThere was a slave auction block next to the Menger Hotel and near the Alamo.<ref>Express Newspaper, 1939, [[University of Texas at San Antonio]] archives</ref>{{Verify source|date=November 2013}}\n\n==Confederacy==\nTexas seceded from the United States in 1861, and joined the [[Confederate States of America]] during the [[American Civil War]].  It replaced the pro-Union [[Governor of Texas|governor]], [[Sam Houston]], in the process.  During the war, slavery in Texas was little affected, and prices for slaves remained high until the last few months of the war.  The number of slaves in the state increased dramatically as the [[Union Army]] occupied parts of [[Arkansas]] and Louisiana.  Slaveholders in those areas often moved their slaves to Texas to avoid having them emancipated.  By 1865 there were an estimated 250,000&nbsp;slaves in Texas.  Many planters, however, lost part of their workforce temporarily to the [[Confederate Army]], which impressed one-quarter of the slaves on each plantation to construct defensive earthworks for the Texas coast and to drive military supply wagons.<ref name=barr36>Barr (1996), p. 36.</ref>  Anyone convicted of providing arms to slaves during the war was sentenced to between two and five years of hard labor.<ref name=barr36/>\n\nUnlike in other Southern states, only a small number of Texas slaves, estimated at 47, joined the Union Army.  Few battles took place in Texas, which acted as a supply state to the Confederacy.  As Texas was much more distant from the Union Army lines for much of the war, slaves were unable to reach them.<ref name=barr37>Barr (1996), p. 37.</ref>  The last battle of the war was fought at [[Battle of Palmito Ranch|Palmito Ranch]] (near Brownsville, TX) in 1865.\n\n==Emancipation==\nOn June 19, 1865, Union General [[Gordon Granger]] and over 2,000 federal troops arrived at [[Galveston Island]] to take possession of the state and enforce the two-year-old [[Emancipation Proclamation]].  There, he proclaimed his \"General Order No. 3\" on the balcony of [[Ashton Villa]]:\n\n<blockquote>The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor. The freedmen are advised to remain quietly at their present homes and work for wages. They are informed that they will not be allowed to collect at military posts and that they will not be supported in idleness either there or elsewhere.<ref name=\"TXJ19\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/ref/abouttx/juneteenth.html |title=Juneteenth |work=State of Texas website |accessdate=2006-07-06}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn some plantations, many slaves left immediately after hearing of the emancipation, even if their former owners offered to pay them wages.<ref name=barr40>Barr (1996), p. 40.</ref>  Throughout the summer, many East Texas newspapers continued to recommend that slaveholders oppose ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], which abolished slavery, in the hopes that emancipation could be gradually implemented.  Some slaveowners did not free their slaves until late in 1865.<ref name=barr39>Barr (1996), p. 39.</ref>\n\nSlavery was officially abolished by the Thirteenth Amendment which took effect on December 18, 1865.  Slavery had been theoretically abolished by President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[Emancipation Proclamation]] which proclaimed, in 1863, that only slaves located in territories that were in rebellion from the United States were free. Since the U.S. government was not in effective control of many of these territories until later in the war, many of these slaves proclaimed to be free by the Emancipation Proclamation were still held in servitude until those areas came back under Union control.\n\n==Legacy==\n{{further|History of African Americans in Texas}}\n\nJune 19, the day of the Emancipation announcement, has been celebrated annually in Texas and other states as [[Juneteenth]].\n\nThe long-term effects of slavery can be seen to this day in the state's demographics.  The eastern quarter of the state, where cotton production depended on thousands of slaves, is considered the westernmost extension of the [[Deep South]].  It contains a very significant number of Texas' African-American population.  On the other hand, western parts of Texas were still a frontier during the [[American Civil War]].  While settled chiefly by [[English American|Anglo]]-Southerners after the war; with the history of ranching, some of these parts have been more associated with the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] than the [[Southern United States|South]].\n\nAfter whites regained power in Texas and other southern states in the 1870s, they imposed a system of legalized [[racial segregation]] and [[white supremacy]].  In 1876 Texas adopted a new constitution requiring segregated schools and imposing a poll tax, which decreased the number of poor voters both black and white.<ref>[http://tshaonline.com \"1876 Constitution\"], ''Handbook of Texas Online'', accessed 12 Apr 2008</ref>  By the late 19th century, Texas passed other [[Jim Crow laws]].  The system of school support was inadequate, and schools for racial minorities were seriously underfunded. Texas did not, however, employ techniques common in other Southern states such as complex voter registration rules and literacy tests; even the \"white primary\" was not implemented statewide until 1923.<ref>Donald S. Strong, \"The Rise of Negro Voting in Texas,\" American Political Science Review Vol. 42 (June, 1948): 510, 511-12.</ref>\n\nIn 1900 African Americans comprised 30% of the state's population of 3,084,710.<ref>[http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php Historical Census Browser, 1900 US Census, University of Virginia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823030234/http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php |date=2007-08-23 }}, accessed 15 Mar 2008</ref>  The drop in proportion of population reflected greatly-increased European immigration to the state in the 19th century, as well as population growth.\n\nLike [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], the Texas Democratic Party adopted a [[white primaries|whites-only primary]].  Since they politically dominated the state for decades after 1900, the only contest for office was at the primary level.  The white primary was another way to exclude African Americans from making electoral decisions, and it was not overturned by the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] until 1944 in ''[[Smith v. Allwright]]''.  States that had used it adopted other means to keep most African Americans from voting.\n\nAfrican Americans immediately started raising legal challenges to disfranchisement, but early Supreme Court cases, such as ''[[Giles v. Harris]]'' (1903), upheld the states.  Through organizations such as the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] ([[NAACP]]), African Americans continued to work to regain their ability to exercise their civil and voting rights as citizens. The [[civil rights movement]] led to the U.S. Congress and President [[Lyndon Johnson]] passing the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965, which protected the rights of all citizens to integrated public facilities and enforcement of voting rights.\n\nOn June 25, 2013, the U.S. [[Shelby County v.

His father, Mario, also a footballer, inspired him to play from a young age. At the age of seven he began playing with a junior team and at fourteen, he joined the Talleres reserves. A prolific goalscorer, at club level he is best known for playing for [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], finishing as [[La Liga]]'s [[Pichichi Trophy|top goalscorer]] twice, and amassing 116 goals in 184 league games for the club.\n\nAt international level, Kempes was the focal point of Argentina's [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]] win where he scored twice in the [[1978 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], and received the [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Boot|Golden Boot]] as top goalscorer. He also won the [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Ball|Golden Ball]] for the player of the tournament, making him one of only three players to have won all three awards at a single World Cup, along with [[Garrincha]] in 1962, and [[Paolo Rossi]] in 1982.\n\nKempes won [[South American Footballer of the Year]], [[Onze d'Or|Onze d'Or European footballer of the Year]], and [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Ball|World Cup Golden Ball]] in 1978. In 2004, he was named as one of the [[FIFA 100|Top 125 greatest living footballers]] as part of [[FIFA]]'s 100th anniversary celebration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/3533891.stm |title=Pele's list of the greatest |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 March 2004 |accessdate=15 June 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Club career==\n[[File:Mario Kempes River Plate.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Mario Kempes during his period in [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]], 1981]]\nKempes was nicknamed ''El Toro'' and ''El Matador''. He was born in [[Bell Ville]], [[C\u00f3rdoba Province, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]]. His career started at local club [[Instituto Atl\u00e9tico Central C\u00f3rdoba|Instituto]], where he played alongside [[Osvaldo Ardiles]] before quickly moving on to [[Rosario Central]], where he scored 85 goals in 105 matches and established himself as a remarkable goalscorer, which prompted a move to [[Valencia CF]]. At [[Mestalla]] he would go on to win the [[Copa del Rey]], the [[European Cup Winners' Cup]] and the [[UEFA Super Cup]] as well as two consecutive [[Pichichi Trophy|Pichichi]]s, scoring 24 and 28 goals in 1976\u201377 and 1977\u201378 seasons. Famous as a hard-working forward, he used to strike from outside the [[penalty area]] with his surging runs towards goal and was not the traditional center-forward operating solely inside the box. Many [[Defender (association football)|defenders]] found difficulty handling his attacking style.\n\nBefore the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]], Kempes was the only foreign based player on the list of coach [[C\u00e9sar Luis Menotti]]'s national team in [[Argentina]], he was at the time playing for Spanish giants [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] while the other squad members all played in Argentina. The coach described him when announcing the squad he had selected for the 1978 tournament, \"He's strong, he's got skill, he creates spaces and he shoots hard. He's a player who can make a difference, and he can play in a centre-forward position.\"\n\nKempes had been the top scorer in [[La Liga]] the previous two seasons and was determined to show on home soil that he could deliver against the best on the sport's greatest stage. However, in 1974, at the age of 20, he failed to get on the score-sheet in [[West Germany]] and after the first round group stage in 1978, his name was still missing among goal scorers in the [[tournament]].\n\n==International career==\n[[File:Mario Kempes Argentina vs. Holanda.JPG|thumb|right|180px|Kempes celebrating one of his 2 goals at the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]] final match v. Netherlands in Buenos Aires]]\nDuring his club career he won 43 caps for [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and scored 20 times. He represented his country in three [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]] in [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]], [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]] and [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]], winning the competition in 1978. He was the [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Boot|leading goalscorer]] in the 1978 tournament, scoring six goals in three braces: The first two in Argentina's first semifinal group stage match against Poland, another two against Peru, and the last two of these goals in the final against the Netherlands, which Argentina won 3\u20131. His second goal, in the 105th minute, was the game winner in extra time. However, in the same tournament, he notoriously stopped a goal with his hand in a second round match against Poland.<ref>Argentina vs Poland \u2013 World Cup 1978 \u2013 full match \u2013 part 4/8 @YouTube</ref> This resulted in a penalty kick that was promptly saved by [[Ubaldo Fillol]].<ref>[https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=50/results/matches/match=2202/report.html FIFA.com 1978 World Cup Match Report \u2013 Argentina \u2013 Poland]</ref>\n\nIn 1978, he was named ''South American Football Player of the Year'' (\"El Mundo,\" Caracas, Venezuela). He was named by [[Pel\u00e9]] as one of the [[FIFA 100|top 125 greatest living footballers]] in March 2004.\n\n==Managerial career==\nKempes made his full-time managing debut in Albania. His brief spell with [[KS Lushnja|Lushnja]] was groundbreaking, as he became the first foreign manager who signed a foreign player for the first time in Albanian football history. His career in Albania came to a quick end in 1997. The following year, he landed a job with Venezuelan side [[Mineros de Guayana]]. In 1999, Kempes moved to Bolivia and managed [[The Strongest]], before taking charge of [[Club Blooming|Blooming]] in 2000. Previously, he worked as assistant coach for Uruguayan manager [[H\u00e9ctor N\u00fa\u00f1ez]] in [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], and as a player-manager of [[Liga Indonesia|Indonesian League]] champions [[Pelita Bandung Raya|Pelita Jaya]].\n\n==Commentary career==\nHe currently works as a football analyst and commentator in Spanish for [[ESPN Deportes]] ([[ESPN]]'s Spanish-language version). Moreover, he as well as Fernando Palomo and Ciro Procuna provide the commentary in the Latin American version of the videogames [[FIFA 13]], [[FIFA 14]], [[FIFA 15]], [[FIFA 16]], [[FIFA 17]], [[FIFA 18]], [[FIFA 19]] and [[FIFA 20]].\n\n==Career statistics==\n===Club===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=3 | Club performance\n! colspan=2 | League\n! colspan=2 | Cup\n! colspan=2 | League Cup\n! colspan=2 | Continental\n! colspan=2 | Total\n|-\n!

A prolific goalscorer, at club level he is best known for playing for [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], finishing as [[La Liga]]'s [[Pichichi Trophy|top goalscorer]] twice, and amassing 116 goals in 184 league games for the club.\n\nAt international level, Kempes was the focal point of Argentina's [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]] win where he scored twice in the [[1978 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], and received the [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Boot|Golden Boot]] as top goalscorer. He also won the [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Ball|Golden Ball]] for the player of the tournament, making him one of only three players to have won all three awards at a single World Cup, along with [[Garrincha]] in 1962, and [[Paolo Rossi]] in 1982.\n\nKempes won [[South American Footballer of the Year]], [[Onze d'Or|Onze d'Or European footballer of the Year]], and [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Ball|World Cup Golden Ball]] in 1978. In 2004, he was named as one of the [[FIFA 100|Top 125 greatest living footballers]] as part of [[FIFA]]'s 100th anniversary celebration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/3533891.stm |title=Pele's list of the greatest |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 March 2004 |accessdate=15 June 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Club career==\n[[File:Mario Kempes River Plate.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Mario Kempes during his period in [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]], 1981]]\nKempes was nicknamed ''El Toro'' and ''El Matador''. His career started at local club [[Instituto Atl\u00e9tico Central C\u00f3rdoba|Instituto]], where he played alongside [[Osvaldo Ardiles]] before quickly moving on to [[Rosario Central]], where he scored 85 goals in 105 matches and established himself as a remarkable goalscorer, which prompted a move to [[Valencia CF]]. At [[Mestalla]] he would go on to win the [[Copa del Rey]], the [[European Cup Winners' Cup]] and the [[UEFA Super Cup]] as well as two consecutive [[Pichichi Trophy|Pichichi]]s, scoring 24 and 28 goals in 1976\u201377 and 1977\u201378 seasons. Famous as a hard-working forward, he used to strike from outside the [[penalty area]] with his surging runs towards goal and was not the traditional center-forward operating solely inside the box. Many [[Defender (association football)|defenders]] found difficulty handling his attacking style.\n\nBefore the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]], Kempes was the only foreign based player on the list of coach [[C\u00e9sar Luis Menotti]]'s national team in [[Argentina]], he was at the time playing for Spanish giants [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] while the other squad members all played in Argentina. The coach described him when announcing the squad he had selected for the 1978 tournament, \"He's strong, he's got skill, he creates spaces and he shoots hard. He's a player who can make a difference, and he can play in a centre-forward position.\"\n\nKempes had been the top scorer in [[La Liga]] the previous two seasons and was determined to show on home soil that he could deliver against the best on the sport's greatest stage. However, in 1974, at the age of 20, he failed to get on the score-sheet in [[West Germany]] and after the first round group stage in 1978, his name was still missing among goal scorers in the [[tournament]].\n\n==International career==\n[[File:Mario Kempes Argentina vs. Holanda.JPG|thumb|right|180px|Kempes celebrating one of his 2 goals at the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]] final match v. Netherlands in Buenos Aires]]\nDuring his club career he won 43 caps for [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and scored 20 times. He represented his country in three [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]] in [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]], [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]] and [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]], winning the competition in 1978. He was the [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Boot|leading goalscorer]] in the 1978 tournament, scoring six goals in three braces: The first two in Argentina's first semifinal group stage match against Poland, another two against Peru, and the last two of these goals in the final against the Netherlands, which Argentina won 3\u20131. His second goal, in the 105th minute, was the game winner in extra time. However, in the same tournament, he notoriously stopped a goal with his hand in a second round match against Poland.<ref>Argentina vs Poland \u2013 World Cup 1978 \u2013 full match \u2013 part 4/8 @YouTube</ref> This resulted in a penalty kick that was promptly saved by [[Ubaldo Fillol]].<ref>[https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=50/results/matches/match=2202/report.html FIFA.com 1978 World Cup Match Report \u2013 Argentina \u2013 Poland]</ref>\n\nIn 1978, he was named ''South American Football Player of the Year'' (\"El Mundo,\" Caracas, Venezuela). He was named by [[Pel\u00e9]] as one of the [[FIFA 100|top 125 greatest living footballers]] in March 2004.\n\n==Managerial career==\nKempes made his full-time managing debut in [[Albania]]. His brief spell with [[KS Lushnja|Lushnja]] was groundbreaking, as he became the first foreign manager who signed a foreign player for the first time in Albanian football history. His career in Albania came to a quick end in 1997. The following year, he landed a job with Venezuelan side [[Mineros de Guayana]]. In 1999, Kempes moved to Bolivia and managed [[The Strongest]], before taking charge of [[Club Blooming|Blooming]] in 2000. Previously, he worked as assistant coach for Uruguayan manager [[H\u00e9ctor N\u00fa\u00f1ez]] in [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], and as a player-manager of [[Liga Indonesia|Indonesian League]] champions [[Pelita Bandung Raya|Pelita Jaya]].\n\n==Commentary career==\nHe currently works as a football analyst and commentator in Spanish for [[ESPN Deportes]] ([[ESPN]]'s Spanish-language version). Moreover, he as well as Fernando Palomo and Ciro Procuna provide the commentary in the Latin American version of the videogames [[FIFA 13]], [[FIFA 14]], [[FIFA 15]], [[FIFA 16]], [[FIFA 17]], [[FIFA 18]], [[FIFA 19]] and [[FIFA 20]].\n\n==Career statistics==\n===Club===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=3 | Club performance\n! colspan=2 | League\n! colspan=2 | Cup\n! colspan=2 | League Cup\n! colspan=2 | Continental\n! colspan=2 | Total\n|-\n!

He may also be counted as \"Louis II.\"</ref> was the second eldest of the three sons of [[Louis the German]] and [[Hemma|Emma]].{{sfn|McKitterick|1999|p=354}} He succeeded his father as the [[King of Saxony]] on 28 August 876 and his elder brother [[Carloman of Bavaria|Carloman]] as [[King of Bavaria]] from 880 to 882. He died in 882 and was succeeded in all his territories, which encompassed most of [[East Francia]], by his younger brother, [[Charles the Fat]], already [[king of Italy]] and [[Carolingian emperor|emperor]].\n\n==Military youth==\nAs a young man, Louis was deployed in military operations against the [[Abodrites]] to the east in 858 and 862.<ref>Reuter, 72.</ref> In 854, at the invitation of the nobles of [[Aquitaine]] opposed to [[Charles the Bald]] and [[Pepin II of Aquitaine|Pepin II]], and coaxed by his father and his cousin [[Charles, Archbishop of Mainz]], he crossed into Gaul at the head of an army, intent on receiving the Aquitainian crown. He marched as far as [[Limoges]] before turning back.\n\nBack home, Louis forged close ties with the nobles of East Francia and became increasingly independent from his father. He engaged himself to the daughter of Count Adalard and, in 865, he and his brother Charles joined in rebellion against their father. This flirtation with revolt was brief, however, and Louis, Charles, and their father were reconciled later that year, though the elder Louis was forced to make a division of the remainder of his territories between his two sons. Carloman had already been given the ''[[Subkingdom (Monarchy)|subregulus]]'' of [[Bavaria]] in 864, now Louis received [[Saxony]], [[Thuringia]], and [[Franconia]] and Charles [[Alemannia]] and [[Rhaetia]].\n\nIn 869, Louis married [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 885)|Liutgard of Saxony]], daughter of [[Liudolf, Duke of Saxony]], at [[Aschaffenburg]]. Liutgard was a strong-willed and politically ambitious woman and later on spurred her husband to pursue ambitious goals. This match increased tensions between father and son and in 871 and in 873, Louis rebelled, but, on each occasion, he later reconciled with his father.\n\n==Rule in Saxony==\nUpon his father's death in 876, Louis fully inherited his subkingdoms, bearing the title ''rex Francorum'' (\"king of the Franks\"). Louis the Younger considered himself the true heir of Louis the German and as his father died in 876, Louis buried him in the abbey of [[Lorsch]], in his own territories, in order to emphasise his primacy to his brothers. Louis also retained his father's chief advisor, [[Liutbert, Archbishop of Mainz|Liutbert]], [[Archbishop of Mainz]]. He and his brother ruled their kingdoms independently but cooperatively and never at war.\n\n===Acquisition of Lotharingia and Bavaria===\nLouis's rule was immediately threatened by Charles the Bald, who tried to annex the eastern parts of [[Lotharingia]] and maybe even to achieve supremacy over his nephew. Louis brought war on Charles and, on 8 October 876 at [[Andernach]], he defeated the much-larger host of West Francia. The East Frankish army displayed superiority in both unity and tactics, and the young king had even dressed his soldiers in white garments so that they appeared as an army of spirits.\n\nAfter this victory, Louis the German's three sons met in November at [[N\u00f6rdlingen]] to discuss the division of their father's kingdom and to have their hosts swear allegiance. According to the plan drawn up in 865, which their father, despite all his sons' rebellions, had confirmed in 872, Carloman received Bavaria, Charles Swabia, and Louis Saxony, Franconia, and Thuringia. Throughout his reign, though he is always called \"King of Saxony\" by historians, he never visited Saxony proper, though it formed the bulk of his territory. At the end of 877, the brothers assembled again to discuss the administration of their half of Lotharingia. After Carloman relinquished his claim, the realm was divided between Louis and Charles, who again met in September 878 in [[Alsace|Alsatia]]. In 879, Carloman was incapacitated by a stroke and named Louis as his successor (and erstwhile regent) in Bavaria. Louis received it outright a year later when Carloman expired.\n\nIn November 878 after the death of Charles the Bald, his heir, [[Louis the Stammerer]], and the latter's cousin Louis the Younger promised each other to respect the succession of their respective sons and to issue no claims contrary to that, at [[Voeren]] (''Fourons'' in [[French language|French]]). This Treaty of Fouron was soon put to the test, when Louis the Stammerer died in April 879. A party of western nobles led by [[Abbot Joscelin]] invited Louis the Younger to succeed to the rule of the western kingdom. Since his wife Liutgard also advocated heeding this call, Louis invaded West Francia. He marched as far as [[Verdun]], but after the new kings [[Louis III of France|Louis III]] and [[Carloman of France|Carloman]] ceded their part of [[Lotharingia]] to the invader, Louis retreated. In February 880, this gain was confirmed by the [[Treaty of Ribemont]], signed near [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne|Saint Quentin]]. This treaty determined the border of the two kingdoms, which was to remain unchanged until the fourteenth century.\n\n===Relationship with the nobility===\nIn contrast to his father, Louis the Younger preferred reconciling royal interests with those of the nobility and avoided confrontation. He managed to bind powerful families to the king, including the [[Ottonian|Liudovingian]] relatives of his wife, that later themselves became kings and emperors. Louis mostly stayed in the [[Rhineland]], avoiding Saxony or his eastern borders. Louis did visit Bavaria on two occasions, but mostly left it to the government of his illegitimate nephew, Carloman's son, [[Arnulf of Carinthia|Arnulf]], [[Duke of Carinthia]].<ref>As \"prefect of the marches.\" Bowlus, 569.</ref>\n\n===Viking incursions===\nSince the summer of 879, [[Vikings]] had been increasing their attacks on the Frankish kingdom and occasionally penetrated deeply into the interior of the land. Louis's kingdom was the most hard-hit after that of West Francia. In February 880, Louis confronted and defeated a [[Norsemen|Norse]] host at the [[Battle of Thimeon]] (near modern [[Charleroi]]).{{sfn|McKitterick|1995|p=234-235}} His son Hugh, however, was killed in this battle.{{sfn|McKitterick|1995|p=234-235}} The next year, Louis defeated the [[Norsemen|Norse]] again at the [[Battle of Saucourt-en-Vimeu|battle of Saucourt]].{{sfn|McKitterick|1999|p=235}} Louis also drove the Norse out of the royal palace of [[Nijmegen]], which they had occupied. In the same month, a Saxon host commanded by [[Brun, Duke of Saxony|Duke Bruno]], the king's brother-in-law, suffered a heavy defeat near [[Hamburg]] and Bruno and many other Saxon nobles fell.\n\n==Death and succession==\nLouis fell sick in 881 and died in [[Frankfurt]] on 20 January 882. He was buried beside his father in the abbey of Lorsch. By his wife Liutgard of Saxony, he had had a son called Louis (877&ndash;879), who died in a fall from a palace window, and a daughter called Hildegard (878&ndash;895). Louis had also fathered an illegitimate son, Hugh (855/60 \u2013 February 880), either with the daughter of Adalard or with an earlier concubine. Since he left no heir, all his territories fell to his brother Charles, who thus could reunite the entire East Frankish kingdom. Hildegard later joined with the Bavarian magnate [[Engeldeo]] in conspiring against [[Arnulf of Carinthia|King Arnulf]] and was deprived of her \"public honours\" in 895, according to the ''[[Annals of Fulda]]''.\n\n== Family ==\nLouis the Younger married Liutgard, a daughter of Duke [[Liudolf, Duke of Saxony|Liudolf of Saxony]], who was grandfather of King [[Henry I of Germany]].\n\n* [[Louis of Saxony|Louis]] (876 - November 879)\n* Hildegard (875/878 or 881 - after ca.900)\n* Bernhart\n\nHis illegitimate children were:\n* [[Hugo (Son of Louis the Younger)|Hugo]] (ca. 855/860 - February 880), illegitimate son{{sfn|McKitterick|1995|p=234-235}}\n* Adalhard, illegitimate son\n\n==See also==\n*[[Kings of Germany family tree]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*[[Charles Oman|Oman, Charles]].
