Hoping to gain both plunder and a powerful [[vassal state]], Mongol leader [[Genghis Khan]] commanded some initial raids against Western Xia before launching a full-scale invasion in 1209. This marked both the first major invasion conducted by Genghis and the beginning of the [[Mongol invasion of China]]. Despite a major set-back during a nearly year-long siege of the capital, [[Yinchuan]], when the diverted river accidentally flooded their camp, the Mongols convinced Emperor [[Li Anquan]] to surrender in January 1210. For nearly a decade the Western Xia served the Mongols as vassals and aided them in the [[Mongol\u2013Jin War]], but when Genghis [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia and Eastern Iran|invaded]] the Islamic [[Khwarazmian dynasty]] in 1219, Western Xia attempted to break away from the Empire and ally with the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin]] and [[Song dynasty|Song dynasties]]. Angered by this betrayal, in 1225 Genghis Khan sent a second, [[punitive expedition]] into Western Xia. Genghis intended to annihilate the entire Western Xia culture, and his campaign systematically destroyed Western Xia cities and the countryside, culminating in the siege of the capital in 1227 along with forays into Jin territory. Near the end of the siege, in August 1227, Genghis Khan died from an uncertain cause, though some accounts say he was killed in action against Western Xia. After his death, Yinchuan fell to the Mongols and most of its population was massacred. The destruction of Western Xia during the second campaign was near total. According to [[John Man (author)|John Man]], Western Xia is little known to anyone other than experts in the field precisely because of Genghis Khan's policy calling for their complete eradication. He states that \"There is a case to be made that this was the first ever recorded example of attempted [[genocide]].

Cromwell invaded Ireland with his [[New Model Army]] on behalf of [[England]]'s [[Rump Parliament]] in August 1649. Following the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]], most of Ireland came under the control of the [[Confederate Ireland|Irish Catholic Confederation]]. In early 1649, the Confederates allied with the English [[Cavalier|Royalists]], who had been defeated by the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] in the [[English Civil War]]. By May 1652, Cromwell's Parliamentarian army had defeated the Confederate and Royalist coalition in Ireland and occupied the country\u2014bringing to an end the [[Irish Confederate Wars]] (or Eleven Years' War). However, [[guerrilla warfare]] continued for a further year. Cromwell passed a series of [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]] against [[Roman Catholics]] (the vast majority of the population) and [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652|confiscated large amounts of their land]]. During the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] (1651\u20131660), this policy was enhanced with the passing of the [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652|Act of Settlement of Ireland]] in 1652. Its goal was a further transfer of land from Irish to English hands.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} The immediate war aims and the longer term policies of the English Parliamentarians resulted in an attempt by the English to transfer the native population to the western fringes to make way for Protestant settlers.

He discovered that a number of Gaulish tribes had attempted to pay these Germani generously to leave, but the Tencteri and Usipetes had ranged further, coming to the frontiers of the [[Condrusi]] and [[Eburones]], who were both under the protection of the [[Treveri]] to their south. Caesar convened a meeting of the Gaulish chiefs, and, pretending he did not know of their attempts at bribery, demanded cavalry and provisions for war against the Tencteri and Usipetes. The Germanic cavalry, although outnumbered by Caesar's Gallic horsemen, made the first attack, forcing the Romans to retreat. Caesar describes a characteristic battle-tactic they used, where a horsemen would leap down to their feet and stab enemy horses in the belly. Accusing them of violating the truce, Caesar refused to accept any more ambassadors, arresting some who came requesting a further truce, and led his full force against the Germanic camp. The Usipetes and Tencteri were thrown into disarray and forced to flee, pursued by Caesar's cavalry, to the confluence of the Rhine and Meuse. Many were killed attempting to cross the rivers.<ref>[[Julius Caesar]], ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'' [[s:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 4#1|4.1-15]]</ref><ref>Lee, K.H. \"Caesar's Encounter with the Usipetes and the Tencteri.\" ''Greece & Rome'' 2nd vol. 2 (1969): 100-103.</ref> They found refuge on the other side of the Rhine amongst the [[Sicambri]].

It was carried out by Lavrentiy Beria, head of the Soviet state security and secret police, acting on behalf of Joseph Stalin. Within three days, Beria's NKVD used cattle trains to deport women, children, the elderly, even Communists and members of the Red Army, to the Soviet Republic of Uzbekistan, several thousand kilometres away.

The genocide seldom entered Western discourse, both due to ignorance and to the Cold-War politics which made West Germany a new ally of the United States.The first significant work on the subject published in English was [[Gerald Reitlinger]]'s ''Final Solution'' (1953), which, relying almost exclusively on German documentation, estimated 4.9 million dead. This figure is now considered extremely conservative. [[Raul Hilberg]]'s 1961 ''[[The Destruction of the European Jews]]'' became a classic in the field of Holocaust literature and made the genocide of the Jews known to the wider public, Hilberg estimated its victims to be 5.1 million lives, or 4.9 - 5.4 million broadly construed. The [[Adolf Eichmann#Trial|trial of Adolph Eichmann]] further raised awareness of the genocide, Eichmann also provided documentation and testimony which revised the number of the dead.The first work to arrive at a figure comparable to modern estimates was [[Lucy Dawidowicz]]'s ''[[The War Against the Jews]]'', published in 1975, the book provided detailed listings by country of the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust which are still used as a reference in modern Holocaust studies. Dawidowicz researched birth and death records in many cities of prewar Europe to come up with a death toll of 5,933,900 Jews. After the opening of Soviet records, scholarship arrived at a death toll of about 6 million Jews. Gutman and Rozett's [[Encyclopedia of the Holocaust]] was published in 1990 and estimated slightly over 5.9 million Jews were murdered.[[Wolfgang Benz]]'s ''The Holocaust: A German Historian Examines the Genocide'', published 1995, gave a toll of 6.2 million.</ref>-->\n<!--<ref name=Benz>{{cite book|author=Benz, Wolfgang|title=The Holocaust: A German Historian Examines the Genocide|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|year=1999|isbn=0-231-11214-9|pp=152\u201353}}</ref>-->\n\n<ref name=Wheatcroft2001>{{cite book|last=Wheatcroft|first=Stephen G.|year=2001|chapter=Current knowledge of the level and nature of mortality in the Ukrainian famine of 1931\u20133|chapterurl=http://www.melgrosh.unimelb.edu.au/documents/SGW-UkranianFamine_mortality.pdf |editor=V.

Hoping to gain both plunder and a powerful [[vassal state]], Mongol leader [[Genghis Khan]] commanded some initial raids against Western Xia before launching a full-scale invasion in 1209. This marked both the first major invasion conducted by Genghis and the beginning of the [[Mongol invasion of China]]. Despite a major set-back during a nearly year-long siege of the capital, [[Yinchuan]], when the diverted river accidentally flooded their camp, the Mongols convinced Emperor [[Li Anquan]] to surrender in January 1210. For nearly a decade the Western Xia served the Mongols as vassals and aided them in the [[Mongol\u2013Jin War]], but when Genghis [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia and Eastern Iran|invaded]] the Islamic [[Khwarazmian dynasty]] in 1219, Western Xia attempted to break away from the Empire and ally with the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin]] and [[Song dynasty|Song dynasties]]. Angered by this betrayal, in 1225 Genghis Khan sent a second, [[punitive expedition]] into Western Xia. Genghis intended to annihilate the entire Western Xia culture, and his campaign systematically destroyed Western Xia cities and the countryside, culminating in the siege of the capital in 1227 along with forays into Jin territory. Near the end of the siege, in August 1227, Genghis Khan died from an uncertain cause, though some accounts say he was killed in action against Western Xia. After his death, Yinchuan fell to the Mongols and most of its population was massacred. The destruction of Western Xia during the second campaign was near total. According to [[John Man (author)|John Man]], Western Xia is little known to anyone other than experts in the field precisely because of Genghis Khan's policy calling for their complete eradication. He states that \"There is a case to be made that this was the first ever recorded example of attempted [[genocide]]. It was certainly very successful ''[[ethnocide]]''.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Man|first=John|authorlink=John Man (author)|title=Genghis Khan: Life, Death, and Resurrection|year=2004|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|location=New York City|isbn=9780312366247|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXTv9a0HZakC|pages=116\u2013117}}</ref> However, some members of the Western Xia royal clan emigrated to western [[Sichuan]], northern [[Tibet]], even possibly [[Northeast India]], in some instances becoming local rulers.<ref>[[Herbert Franke (sinologist)|Franke, Herbert]] and [[Denis C.

Cromwell invaded Ireland with his [[New Model Army]] on behalf of [[England]]'s [[Rump Parliament]] in August 1649. Following the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]], most of Ireland came under the control of the [[Confederate Ireland|Irish Catholic Confederation]]. In early 1649, the Confederates allied with the English [[Cavalier|Royalists]], who had been defeated by the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] in the [[English Civil War]]. By May 1652, Cromwell's Parliamentarian army had defeated the Confederate and Royalist coalition in Ireland and occupied the country\u2014bringing to an end the [[Irish Confederate Wars]] (or Eleven Years' War). However, [[guerrilla warfare]] continued for a further year. Cromwell passed a series of [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]] against [[Roman Catholics]] (the vast majority of the population) and [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652|confiscated large amounts of their land]]. During the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] (1651\u20131660), this policy was enhanced with the passing of the [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652|Act of Settlement of Ireland]] in 1652. Its goal was a further transfer of land from Irish to English hands.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} The immediate war aims and the longer term policies of the English Parliamentarians resulted in an attempt by the English to transfer the native population to the western fringes to make way for Protestant settlers.

He discovered that a number of Gaulish tribes had attempted to pay these Germani generously to leave, but the Tencteri and Usipetes had ranged further, coming to the frontiers of the [[Condrusi]] and [[Eburones]], who were both under the protection of the [[Treveri]] to their south. Caesar convened a meeting of the Gaulish chiefs, and, pretending he did not know of their attempts at bribery, demanded cavalry and provisions for war against the Tencteri and Usipetes. The Germanic cavalry, although outnumbered by Caesar's Gallic horsemen, made the first attack, forcing the Romans to retreat. Caesar describes a characteristic battle-tactic they used, where a horsemen would leap down to their feet and stab enemy horses in the belly. Accusing them of violating the truce, Caesar refused to accept any more ambassadors, arresting some who came requesting a further truce, and led his full force against the Germanic camp.

It was carried out by Lavrentiy Beria, head of the Soviet state security and secret police, acting on behalf of Joseph Stalin. Within three days, Beria's NKVD used cattle trains to deport women, children, the elderly, even Communists and members of the Red Army, to the Soviet Republic of Uzbekistan, several thousand kilometres away.

The genocide seldom entered Western discourse, both due to ignorance and to the Cold-War politics which made West Germany a new ally of the United States.The first significant work on the subject published in English was [[Gerald Reitlinger]]'s ''Final Solution'' (1953), which, relying almost exclusively on German documentation, estimated 4.9 million dead. This figure is now considered extremely conservative. [[Raul Hilberg]]'s 1961 ''[[The Destruction of the European Jews]]'' became a classic in the field of Holocaust literature and made the genocide of the Jews known to the wider public, Hilberg estimated its victims to be 5.1 million lives, or 4.9 - 5.4 million broadly construed. The [[Adolf Eichmann#Trial|trial of Adolph Eichmann]] further raised awareness of the genocide, Eichmann also provided documentation and testimony which revised the number of the dead.The first work to arrive at a figure comparable to modern estimates was [[Lucy Dawidowicz]]'s ''[[The War Against the Jews]]'', published in 1975, the book provided detailed listings by country of the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust which are still used as a reference in modern Holocaust studies. Dawidowicz researched birth and death records in many cities of prewar Europe to come up with a death toll of 5,933,900 Jews. After the opening of Soviet records, scholarship arrived at a death toll of about 6 million Jews. Gutman and Rozett's [[Encyclopedia of the Holocaust]] was published in 1990 and estimated slightly over 5.9 million Jews were murdered.[[Wolfgang Benz]]'s ''The Holocaust: A German Historian Examines the Genocide'', published 1995, gave a toll of 6.2 million.</ref>-->\n<!--<ref name=Benz>{{cite book|author=Benz, Wolfgang|title=The Holocaust: A German Historian Examines the Genocide|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|year=1999|isbn=0-231-11214-9|pp=152\u201353}}</ref>-->\n\n<ref name=Wheatcroft2001>{{cite book|last=Wheatcroft|first=Stephen G.|year=2001|chapter=Current knowledge of the level and nature of mortality in the Ukrainian famine of 1931\u20133|chapterurl=http://www.melgrosh.unimelb.edu.au/documents/SGW-UkranianFamine_mortality.pdf |editor=V.

He is best remembered as the writer of ''[[It's That Man Again]]'' (ITMA), a radio comedy series which ran for a decade from 1939 and was immensely successful. It was intentionally devised by Kavanagh, producer [[Francis Worsley]] and the Liverpudian comedian [[Tommy Handley]] as Handley's specific vehicle; Kavanagh had been writing for him since 1924, and went on to co-write two feature films for Handley, ''It's That Man Again'' and science fiction/ comedy ''Time Flies''.\n\nKavanagh's biography of Handley was published in 1949, the year of the comedian's death and the end of their radio show. A prolific writer, ITMA and his work for Handley constituted only a small proportion of his total oeuvre.\n\nIn 1948, Kavanagh set up an agency for writers, Ted Kavanagh Associated (Entertainments) Ltd. The company was dissolved in 1963.<ref>[https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C5033881 \"Company No: 450075\"] Reference: BT 31/39733/450075, The National Archives, Kew, retrieved 23 March 2019.</ref>\n\nHe's credited as bringing solo comedy writers [[Frank Muir]] and [[Denis Norden]] together, resulting in a successful 30-year partnership that produced ''[[Take It From Here]]'' and other series.<ref>[http://www.thekeep.info/collections/getrecord/GB181_SxMs72 ''Frank Muir & Denis Norden Archive''] The Keep / University of Sussex Special Collections, retrieved 2 April 2019.</ref> Both writers worked for his agency.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/sep/19/denis-norden-obituary Denis Norden Obituary] The Guardian, Stephen Dixon, 18 September 2018.

He is best remembered as the writer of ''[[It's That Man Again]]'' (ITMA), a radio comedy series which ran for a decade from 1939 and was immensely successful. It was intentionally devised by Kavanagh, producer [[Francis Worsley]] and the Liverpudian comedian [[Tommy Handley]] as Handley's specific vehicle; Kavanagh had been writing for him since 1924, and went on to co-write two feature films for Handley, ''It's That Man Again'' and science fiction/ comedy ''Time Flies''.\n\nKavanagh's biography of Handley was published in 1949, the year of the comedian's death and the end of their radio show. A prolific writer, ITMA and his work for Handley constituted only a small proportion of his total oeuvre.\n\nIn 1948, Kavanagh set up an agency for writers, Ted Kavanagh Associated (Entertainments) Ltd.

It can also be located in the Southern Hemisphere, just on mountain tops. Permafrost frequently occurs in ground ice, but it also can be presented in non-porous bedrock.

Frozen ground is that which is below the freezing point of water, whether or not water is present in the substrate. Ground ice is not always present, as may be the case with nonporous bedrock, but it frequently occurs and may be present in amounts exceeding the potential [[Phreatic zone|hydraulic saturation]] of the thawed substrate.\n\nBy definition, permafrost is ground that remains frozen for two or more years. Since frozen soil, including permafrost, comprises a large percentage of substrate materials other than ice, it thaws rather than melts even as any ice content melts. During thaw, the ice content melts and, as the water drains or evaporates, causes the soil structure to weaken and sometimes become viscous until it regains strength with decreasing moisture content. One visible sign of permafrost degradation is the [[Drunken trees|random displacement of trees from their vertical orientation]] in permafrost areas.\n\nAs a consequence, precipitation has increased, which in turn results in the weakening and eventual collapse of buildings in areas such as Norilsk in northern Russia, which lies upon the permafrost.<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180\" style=\"font-size:100%; line-height:130%\">\nFile:Permafrost in Herschel Island 009.jpg|Thawing permafrost in [[Herschel Island]], Canada, 2013\nFile:Permafrost in Herschel Island 010.jpg|Thawing permafrost in [[Herschel Island]], Canada, 2013\nFile:Permafrost in Herschel Island 001.jpg|Thawing permafrost in [[Herschel Island]], Canada, 2013\nFile:Permafrost in Herschel Island 015.jpg|Permafrost and ice in [[Herschel Island]], Canada, 2012\nFile:Permafrost thaw ponds in Hudson Bay Canada near Greenland.jpg|Permafrost thaw ponds on peatland in [[Hudson Bay]], Canada in 2008.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Permafrost and Peatland Evolution in the Northern Hudson Bay Lowland, Manitoba|url=http://arctic.journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/arctic/index.php/arctic/article/view/3332|authors=Larry D.

Permafrost does not have to be the first layer that is on the ground. It can be an inch to over miles deep into the Earth\u2019s surface. Some of the most common permafrost locations are located in the Northern Hemisphere. 85% of Alaska, Greenland Canada and Siberia is sitting on top of a layer of permafrost, that is almost a quarter of the Northern Hemisphere. It can also be located in the Southern Hemisphere, just on mountain tops. Permafrost frequently occurs in ground ice, but it also can be presented in non-porous bedrock.

Frozen ground is that which is below the freezing point of water, whether or not water is present in the substrate. Ground ice is not always present, as may be the case with nonporous bedrock, but it frequently occurs and may be present in amounts exceeding the potential [[Phreatic zone|hydraulic saturation]] of the thawed substrate.\n\nBy definition, permafrost is ground that remains frozen for two or more years. Since frozen soil, including permafrost, comprises a large percentage of substrate materials other than ice, it thaws rather than melts even as any ice content melts. During thaw, the ice content melts and, as the water drains or evaporates, causes the soil structure to weaken and sometimes become viscous until it regains strength with decreasing moisture content. One visible sign of permafrost degradation is the [[Drunken trees|random displacement of trees from their vertical orientation]] in permafrost areas.\n\nAs a consequence, precipitation has increased, which in turn results in the weakening and eventual collapse of buildings in areas such as Norilsk in northern Russia, which lies upon the permafrost.<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180\" style=\"font-size:100%; line-height:130%\">\nFile:Permafrost in Herschel Island 009.jpg|Thawing permafrost in [[Herschel Island]], Canada, 2013\nFile:Permafrost in Herschel Island 010.jpg|Thawing permafrost in [[Herschel Island]], Canada, 2013\nFile:Permafrost in Herschel Island 001.jpg|Thawing permafrost in [[Herschel Island]], Canada, 2013\nFile:Permafrost in Herschel Island 015.jpg|Permafrost and ice in [[Herschel Island]], Canada, 2012\nFile:Permafrost thaw ponds in Hudson Bay Canada near Greenland.jpg|Permafrost thaw ponds on peatland in [[Hudson Bay]], Canada in 2008.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Permafrost and Peatland Evolution in the Northern Hudson Bay Lowland, Manitoba|url=http://arctic.journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/arctic/index.php/arctic/article/view/3332|authors=Larry D.

Therefore, subsea permafrost exists in conditions that lead to its diminishment.

However the Australasian Cricket Council was disbanded in 1898, and what is now known as Cricket Australia was established in 1905 as the \"Australian Board of Control for International Cricket\".<ref name=\"page57\">Pollard, p. 57.</ref> Before its establishment, tours by Australian teams to England were organised and funded by private groups or by the players themselves. Similarly, invitations to English teams were made by private promoters or by individual clubs, such as the [[Melbourne Cricket Club]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}  The predecessor organisation, the Australasian Cricket Council, had existed from 1892 to 1898 but was ineffective due to a lack of funding. Its one lasting action was to establish the [[Sheffield Shield]], the first-class cricket competition between the Australian colonies.<ref>Pollard, pp. 49\u201350.</ref>\n\nThese early tours were lucrative for the players and promoters and cricket administrators looked to find ways to channel some of this money to the destitute clubs, through the state associations. Formal discussions began in January 1905 in Sydney for the formation of a body to take control of tours from the players. A draft constitution was discussed by members of the New South Wales, Victoria, South Australian and Queensland associations.<ref>Pollard, p. 56.</ref> The first meeting of the new board was held at [[Wesley College, Melbourne|Wesley College]] in [[Melbourne]] on 6 May 1905.\n\nThe foundation members were the [[New South Wales Cricket Association]] and the [[Victorian Cricket Association]]. South Australia's delegates refused to join the Board because the Board structure denied the players any representation. The [[Queensland Cricket Association]] was represented as an observer only.<ref name=\"page57\"/>\n\nQueensland did decide to formally join the association with one delegate member the following year, and the constitution was amended in 1906, so that New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria would each have three permanent representatives, and Queensland one representative.

However the Australasian Cricket Council was disbanded in 1898, and what is now known as Cricket Australia was established in 1905 as the \"Australian Board of Control for International Cricket\".<ref name=\"page57\">Pollard, p. 57.</ref> Before its establishment, tours by Australian teams to England were organised and funded by private groups or by the players themselves. Similarly, invitations to English teams were made by private promoters or by individual clubs, such as the [[Melbourne Cricket Club]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}  The predecessor organisation, the Australasian Cricket Council, had existed from 1892 to 1898 but was ineffective due to a lack of funding. Its one lasting action was to establish the [[Sheffield Shield]], the first-class cricket competition between the Australian colonies.<ref>Pollard, pp. 49\u201350.</ref>\n\nThese early tours were lucrative for the players and promoters and cricket administrators looked to find ways to channel some of this money to the destitute clubs, through the state associations. Formal discussions began in January 1905 in Sydney for the formation of a body to take control of tours from the players. A draft constitution was discussed by members of the New South Wales, Victoria, South Australian and Queensland associations.<ref>Pollard, p. 56.</ref> The first meeting of the new board was held at [[Wesley College, Melbourne|Wesley College]] in [[Melbourne]] on 6 May 1905.\n\nThe foundation members were the [[New South Wales Cricket Association]] and the [[Victorian Cricket Association]]. South Australia's delegates refused to join the Board because the Board structure denied the players any representation. The [[Queensland Cricket Association]] was represented as an observer only.<ref name=\"page57\"/>\n\nQueensland did decide to formally join the association with one delegate member the following year, and the constitution was amended in 1906, so that New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria would each have three permanent representatives, and Queensland one representative. In 1907 Tasmania was also permitted to send a single representative, and Western Australia did likewise in 1913. Changes to this structure were made in 1914 and 1974 respectively when Queensland and Western Australia formally increased their representation to two each.\n\n===Name changes===\nCricket Australia has had three different names since its foundation.
