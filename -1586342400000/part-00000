There are also varieties of different rice dishes with vegetables and herbs which are very popular among Iranians.\n\nThere are four primary methods of cooking rice in Iran:\n* ''Chelow'': rice that is carefully prepared through soaking and [[parboiling]], at which point the water is drained and the rice is steamed. This method results in an exceptionally fluffy rice with the grains separated and not sticky; it also results in a golden rice crust at the bottom of the pot called ''[[tahdig]]'' (literally \"bottom of the pot\").\n* ''Polow'': rice that is cooked exactly the same as ''chelo'', with the exception that after draining the rice, other ingredients are layered with the rice, and they are then steamed together.\n* ''Kateh'': rice that is boiled until the water is absorbed. This is the traditional dish of Northern Iran.\n* ''Damy'': cooked almost the same as ''kateh'', except that the heat is reduced just before boiling and a towel is placed between the lid and the pot to prevent steam from escaping. ''Damy'' literally means \"simmered\".\n\n=== Pakistan ===\n[[File:Cholistani Camel Meat Pulao.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Camel meat pulao, Pakistan]]\nIn [[Pakistan]], ''Pulao'' ({{lang|ur|{{Nastaliq|\u067e\u0644\u0627\u0624}}}}) is a popular dish cooked with [[Basmati]] rice and [[meat]], usually either [[mutton]] or [[beef]].

Some of these variations are pirinc (''[[rice]]'') pilaf, ''[[bulgur]]'' pilaf, and arpa \u015fehriye (''[[orzo]]'') pilaf. Using mainly these three types, Turkish people make many dishes such as ''[[perdeli pilav]]'', and ''etli pilav'' (rice cooked with cubed beef). Unlike Chinese rice, if Turkish rice is sticky, it is considered unsuccessful. To make the best rice according to Turkish people, one must rinse the rice, cook in butter, then add the water and let it sit until it soaks all the water. This results in a pilaf that is not sticky and every single rice grain falls off of the spoon separately.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Food}}\n* ''[[Nasi kebuli]]'', a similar dish from [[Indonesia]].\n* [[List of rice dishes]]\n* [[Fried rice]]\n* ''[[Nasi lemak]]''\n* ''[[Nasi goreng]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{Citation|title=Indian Food Tradition A Historical Companion|last=Achaya|first=K.T.|publisher=Oxford University Press India|year=1994|isbn=978-0195628456|location=|page=45}}\n*{{citation|author=American Institute for Cancer Research|title=The New American Plate Cookbook: Recipes for a Healthy Weight and a Healthy Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zaU4m46CHL4C&pg=RA1-PA58|year=2005|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24234-0|pages=158\u2013}} \n*{{citation|last=Boardman|first=John|title=Alexander the Great: From His Death to the Present Day|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qkZxDwAAQBAJ|year=2019|authorlink=John Boardman (art historian)|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-18175-2}}\n*{{citation|last=Collingham|first=Elizabeth M.|title=Curry: A Tale of Cooks and Conquerors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pH88DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA25|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-532001-5}} \n* {{citation|last=Davidson|first=Alan|title=The Oxford Companion to Food|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RL6LAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA624|year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967733-7|pages=624\u2013625}}\n*{{citation|last=Kraig|first=Bruce|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DOJMAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA140|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press USA|isbn=978-0-19-973496-2|page=140}}\n*  {{citation|last=Marton|first=Renee|title=Rice: A Global History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CDwpCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT34|year=2014|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=978-1-78023-412-0|pages=34\u2013}}\n*{{citation|last=Nabhan|first=Gary Paul|title=Cumin, Camels, and Caravans: A Spice Odyssey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e-glDQAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Univ of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-26720-6}}\n* {{citation|last1=Nandy|first1=Ashis|authorlink=Ashis Nandy|title=The Changing Popular Culture of Indian Food: Preliminary Notes|journal=South Asia Research|volume=24|issue=1|year=2004|pages=9\u201319|issn=0262-7280|doi=10.1177/0262728004042760|citeseerx=10.1.1.830.7136}}\n*{{citation|author=Oxford English Dictionary|title=pilaf (n)|publisher=Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd edition, online (subscription required)| year = 2006a|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/265992?redirectedFrom=pilaf#eid}}\n*{{citation|author=Oxford English Dictionary|title=pilau (n)|publisher=Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd edition, online (subscription required)| year = 2006b|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/143814}}\n*{{citation|last=Perry |first=Charles|authorlink=Charles Perry (food writer) |editor=Jaine, Tom |title=The Oxford Companion to Food by Alan Davidson, 3rd Edition|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RL6LAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA624|year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967733-7|pages=624\u2013625|chapter=Pilaf}}\n*{{citation|last=Perry|first=Charles|authorlink=Charles Perry (food writer)|title=Annual Cookbook Issue : BOOK REVIEW : An Armchair Guide to the Indian Table : INDIAN FOOD: A Historical Companion By K.

Many dishes of that period are still prepared today with ingredients available to the common people. Some of these are vinegar preserves, roasted meat, and cooked livers, which could be bought in the streets, eaten in the shops, or taken home.

This method results in an exceptionally fluffy rice with the grains separated and not sticky; it also results in a golden rice crust at the bottom of the pot called ''[[tahdig]]'' (literally \"bottom of the pot\").\n* ''Polow'': rice that is cooked exactly the same as ''chelo'', with the exception that after draining the rice, other ingredients are layered with the rice, and they are then steamed together.\n* ''Kateh'': rice that is boiled until the water is absorbed. This is the traditional dish of Northern Iran.\n* ''Damy'': cooked almost the same as ''kateh'', except that the heat is reduced just before boiling and a towel is placed between the lid and the pot to prevent steam from escaping. ''Damy'' literally means \"simmered\".\n\n=== Pakistan ===\n[[File:Cholistani Camel Meat Pulao.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Camel meat pulao, Pakistan]]\nIn [[Pakistan]], ''Pulao'' ({{lang|ur|{{Nastaliq|\u067e\u0644\u0627\u0624}}}}) is a popular dish cooked with [[Basmati]] rice and [[meat]], usually either [[mutton]] or [[beef]]. In home cooking mutton and beef are sometimes substituted with chicken, due to higher prices of mutton.<ref>[https://images.dawn.com/news/1177603 How mutton pulao survived the chicken takeover in Pakistan]</ref>\nPulao is a rice dish, cooked in seasoned broth with rice, meat, and an array of spices including: coriander seeds, cumin, cardamom, cloves and others. As with Afghan cuisine, ''[[Kabuli palaw]]'' is a staple dish in the western part of the Pakistan, and this style of Pulao is often embellished with sliced carrots, almonds and raisins, fried in a sweet syrup.\nPulao is famous in all parts of Pakistan, but the cooking style can vary slightly in other parts of the country. It is prepared by [[Sindhi people]] of Pakistan in their marriage ceremonies, condolence meetings, and other occasions.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Reejhsinghani|first1=Aroona|title=Essential Sindhi Cookbook|date=2004|publisher=Penguin Books India|isbn=9780143032014|page=237|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ym9IWIZELc8C&pg=PA237&dq=Sindhi+Pulao#v=onepage&q=Sindhi%20Pulao&f=false|accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Reejhsinghani|first1=Aroona|title=The Sindhi Kitchen|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1HAYAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT175&dq=Sindhi+Pulao#v=onepage&q=Sindhi%20Pulao&f=false|accessdate=22 August 2015|isbn=9789383260171|date=2013-07-25}}</ref>\n\n===Palestine and Syria===\nTraditional Levantine cooking includes a variety of Pilaf known as \"Maqlubeh\", known across the countries of the Eastern Mediterranean. The rice pilaf which is traditionally cooked with meats, eggplants, tomatoes, potatoes, and cauliflower also has a fish variety known as \"Sayyadiyeh\", or the Fishermen's Dish.\n\n===Turkey===\n[[File:Pilav.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Typical Turkish pilav. Rice with [[orzo (pasta)|orzo]].]]\nHistorically, mutton stock was the most common cooking liquid for Turkish pilafs, which according to 19th century American sources was called ''pirin\u00e7''.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Good Housekeeping |date=1894 |volume=18 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2p40D6JfZr8C&pg=PA52}}</ref>\n\nTurkish cuisine contains many different pilaf types. Some of these variations are pirinc (''[[rice]]'') pilaf, ''[[bulgur]]'' pilaf, and arpa \u015fehriye (''[[orzo]]'') pilaf. Using mainly these three types, Turkish people make many dishes such as ''[[perdeli pilav]]'', and ''etli pilav'' (rice cooked with cubed beef). Unlike Chinese rice, if Turkish rice is sticky, it is considered unsuccessful. To make the best rice according to Turkish people, one must rinse the rice, cook in butter, then add the water and let it sit until it soaks all the water. This results in a pilaf that is not sticky and every single rice grain falls off of the spoon separately.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Food}}\n* ''[[Nasi kebuli]]'', a similar dish from [[Indonesia]].\n* [[List of rice dishes]]\n* [[Fried rice]]\n* ''[[Nasi lemak]]''\n* ''[[Nasi goreng]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{Citation|title=Indian Food Tradition A Historical Companion|last=Achaya|first=K.T.|publisher=Oxford University Press India|year=1994|isbn=978-0195628456|location=|page=45}}\n*{{citation|author=American Institute for Cancer Research|title=The New American Plate Cookbook: Recipes for a Healthy Weight and a Healthy Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zaU4m46CHL4C&pg=RA1-PA58|year=2005|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24234-0|pages=158\u2013}} \n*{{citation|last=Boardman|first=John|title=Alexander the Great: From His Death to the Present Day|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qkZxDwAAQBAJ|year=2019|authorlink=John Boardman (art historian)|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-18175-2}}\n*{{citation|last=Collingham|first=Elizabeth M.|title=Curry: A Tale of Cooks and Conquerors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pH88DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA25|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-532001-5}} \n* {{citation|last=Davidson|first=Alan|title=The Oxford Companion to Food|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RL6LAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA624|year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967733-7|pages=624\u2013625}}\n*{{citation|last=Kraig|first=Bruce|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DOJMAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA140|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press USA|isbn=978-0-19-973496-2|page=140}}\n*  {{citation|last=Marton|first=Renee|title=Rice: A Global History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CDwpCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT34|year=2014|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=978-1-78023-412-0|pages=34\u2013}}\n*{{citation|last=Nabhan|first=Gary Paul|title=Cumin, Camels, and Caravans: A Spice Odyssey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e-glDQAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Univ of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-26720-6}}\n* {{citation|last1=Nandy|first1=Ashis|authorlink=Ashis Nandy|title=The Changing Popular Culture of Indian Food: Preliminary Notes|journal=South Asia Research|volume=24|issue=1|year=2004|pages=9\u201319|issn=0262-7280|doi=10.1177/0262728004042760|citeseerx=10.1.1.830.7136}}\n*{{citation|author=Oxford English Dictionary|title=pilaf (n)|publisher=Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd edition, online (subscription required)| year = 2006a|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/265992?redirectedFrom=pilaf#eid}}\n*{{citation|author=Oxford English Dictionary|title=pilau (n)|publisher=Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd edition, online (subscription required)| year = 2006b|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/143814}}\n*{{citation|last=Perry |first=Charles|authorlink=Charles Perry (food writer) |editor=Jaine, Tom |title=The Oxford Companion to Food by Alan Davidson, 3rd Edition|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RL6LAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA624|year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967733-7|pages=624\u2013625|chapter=Pilaf}}\n*{{citation|last=Perry|first=Charles|authorlink=Charles Perry (food writer)|title=Annual Cookbook Issue : BOOK REVIEW : An Armchair Guide to the Indian Table : INDIAN FOOD: A Historical Companion By K.

Their opponents in the [[1878\u201379 FA Cup#Fourth round|1879 FA Cup Quarter finals]] is [[Darwen F.C.|Darwen FC]], a working class factory team. James Walsh, the owner of Darwen FC and the associated mill decides to secretly pay two Scottish players, [[Fergus Suter|Fergus \"Fergie\" Suter]] and James \"Jimmy\" Love to join his team in a bid to secure the FA Cup (which at the time is exclusively for amateurs). At halftime the Old Etonians lead 5-1, however Darwen recovers with a progressive adjustment (spreading out their formation and focusing on passing) to draw 5 all. The Old Etonians, who also happen to be FA Board members, decide that since [[Overtime (sports)#Association football|extra time]] was not previously agreed to then the Quarterfinal will be replayed instead. The mill has financial issues and townsfolk pitch in to help pay for the trip. The replay is handily won by Old Etonians who focus more on shutting down Suter and Love rather than playing their own game. Darwen FC is greeted positively for their efforts by the town.\n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = Episode 2\n |DirectedBy      = Birgitte St\u00e6rmose\n |WrittenBy       = Julian Fellowes & Ben Vanstone\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary    = Suter meets with Walsh and convinces him to change some football strategies. Stokes, a team member, goes to Kinnaird\u2019s bank to ask for a loan. Some Darwen mill workers talk about strike as a result of a prior 5% wage cut. The Cotton Guild imposes another 10% wage cut. Darwen workers walk out. The team refuses to train or play in matches while on strike. Suter fails to convince Walsh to go against the guild. Workers go to the guild to demand a 5% wage cut and fewer hours to help fight the oversupply that has caused the price of goods to fall. The guild refuses. Workers riot. Kinnaird is saved from the riot by Stokes. Against Kinnaird\u2019s wishes, Stokes goes in his place to warn Col. Jackson (the guild leader) that the mob is coming for him. Police show up and arrest Stokes and kill his dog. Stokes is put on trial and sentenced to 15 years in prison. Kinnaird testifies on behalf of Stokes and saves him from prison and gives him his loan. Walsh agrees to the 5% wage cut and to work 5 days a week if the team plays their upcoming match. While waiting on the team at the match, Suter is approached by the manager of Blackburn FC and is offered \u00a3100 upfront and a \u00a36 weekly wage increase. Suter turns him down as the team arrives to play. \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |Title           = Episode 3\n |DirectedBy      = Birgitte St\u00e6rmose\n |WrittenBy       = Julian Fellowes & Gabbie Asher\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary    = Suter goes home to Glasgow to visit his poor family and drunken, abusive father who tries to shame Suter for being paid to play. Kinnaird and his wife continue to mourn the loss of her pregnancy 6 months earlier. Once back in Lancashire, Suter meets with Cartwright, the Blackburn FC manager and accepts his offer but needs a few days to make it right with Jimmy, Walsh and the Darwen team. After practice with the Etonians, teammates talk about the \u201cepidemic\u201d of working class teams joining the Football Association. While the gentleman scoff at the conditions of the working poor, Kinnaird comes to their defense. The Darwen team are out celebrating Jimmy\u2019s stag party. Mr. Walsh tells Suter that he\u2019s proud of his decision to bring Suter on to the team. Suter thanks him but doesn\u2019t mention the deal with Blackburn. Clearly drunk, Suter gets in a fight with another Blackburn player recently hired from Partick when he compares Suter to his drunken father. The following day, at the match between Darwen and St. Luke\u2019s, Suter arrives late and plays terribly. Darwen lose 3-0 and are out of the FA Cup. Suter storms off the pitch. At home, Suter tells Doris about the deal with Blackburn and says that he\u2019ll tell Jimmy after the wedding. Jimmy practices his vows and Doris overhears. At the wedding, Jimmy tells all that he finally feels like he has a home in Darwen. As Suter begins his best man\u2019s speech, he is interrupted by a teammate who reads a Blackburn ad about Suter joining the team shocking everyone. \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 4\n |Title           = Episode 4\n |DirectedBy      = [[Tim Fywell]]\n |WrittenBy       = Julian Fellowes & Sam Hoare\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary    = At the Darwen mill, Walsh shames Suter for his choice to leave. Suter tries to convince Jimmy to come with him. Jimmy refuses saying Darwen is his team and his family now. Cartwright shows Suter the new facilities and stands. He shows off new teammates, including Jack Hunter from Sheffield, and tells Suter he\u2019s assembling a team of the best players north of Eton. Cartwright asks Walsh for his discretion regarding Suter\u2019s professionalism and offers him \u00a3100 for Blackburn to play Darwen the next week in an exhibition match. After being seen talking familiarly with Mr. Cartwright (with whom she previously had a child), Martha is fired from her job at the Cotton Master\u2019s club. Mr. Cartwright offers her money to help but Martha refuses saying she needs to find her own way. At the Blackburn v. Druids match, Suter struggles to mesh with his new teammates. Hunter is hailed the hero. Suter talks with Jimmy who calls him a Judas. Suter tells Jimmy he\u2019s trying to get his family away from his father. Suter again asks Jimmy to join Blackburn. Later, Jimmy stands up for Suter against the Darwen team and tells them he\u2019s joining Blackburn. On the way to the match between the Old Etonians and Preston, the Etonians discuss how football is becoming a booming business and is no longer just a game. The FA President complains that if it continues, only the richest teams will win and is planning to watch the exhibition match between Darwen and Blackburn to find evidence to expel them from the FA cup. The match between Darwen and Blackburn is rough and Jimmy\u2019s leg is badly broken by a tackle and the blood loss threatens both his life and his leg. |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |Title           = Episode 5\n |DirectedBy      = Tim Fywell\n |WrittenBy       = Julian Fellowes & Geoff Bussetil\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary    = Jimmy is told he\u2019ll never play football again.

After being seen talking familiarly with Mr. Cartwright (with whom she previously had a child), Martha is fired from her job at the Cotton Master\u2019s club. Mr. Cartwright offers her money to help but Martha refuses saying she needs to find her own way. At the Blackburn v. Druids match, Suter struggles to mesh with his new teammates.

After pillaging the suburbs of the Byzantine capital, the Rus' retreated, although the nature of this withdrawal, and indeed which side was victorious, is subject to debate. The event gave rise to a later [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] tradition, which ascribed the deliverance of Constantinople to a miraculous intervention by the [[Theotokos]].\n\n==Background==\nThe first mention of the Rus' near the Byzantine Empire comes from ''Life of St. George of Amastris'', a [[hagiographic]] work whose dating is [[Paphlagonian expedition of the Rus'#Date of the Expedition|debated]].

As the pressure builds, the heart's right ventricle works harder to pump blood, eventually causing the heart muscle to weaken and fail.

Once symptoms appear, the result is nearly always death. The time period between contracting the disease and the start of symptoms is usually one to three months; however, the time is dependent on the distance the virus must travel along nerves to reach the central nervous system. In people who have been exposed to rabies, the rabies vaccine and sometimes rabies immunoglobulin are effective in preventing the disease if the person receives the treatment before the start of rabies symptoms.

In one form of pulmonary hypertension, tiny arteries called pulmonary arterioles and capillaries become narrowed, blocked or destroyed, making it harder for blood to flow through the lungs, and raises pressure within the lungs' arteries. As the pressure builds, the heart's right ventricle works harder to pump blood, eventually causing the heart muscle to weaken and fail. Some forms of pulmonary hypertension are serious conditions that become progressively worse and are sometimes fatal. Although some forms of pulmonary hypertension aren't curable, treatment can help lessen symptoms and improve quality of life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pulmonary-hypertension/symptoms-causes/syc-20350697|title=Mayo Clinic Pulmonary Hypertension}}</ref>\n* [[Pulmonary fibrosis]],  fatal respiratory disease in which scars are formed in the lung tissues, leading to serious breathing problems.

Early symptoms can include fever and tingling at the site of exposure, followed by one or more of the following symptoms: violent movements, uncontrolled excitement, fear of water, an inability to move parts of the body, confusion, and loss of consciousness. Once symptoms appear, the result is nearly always death. The time period between contracting the disease and the start of symptoms is usually one to three months; however, the time is dependent on the distance the virus must travel along nerves to reach the central nervous system. In people who have been exposed to rabies, the rabies vaccine and sometimes rabies immunoglobulin are effective in preventing the disease if the person receives the treatment before the start of rabies symptoms. Once the patient becomes symptomatic, treatment is almost never effective and mortality is over 99%.

The route runs [[concurrency (road)|concurrent]] with [[Maryland Route 4|MD 4]] through much of Calvert County along a four-lane [[divided highway]] known as Solomons Island Road, passing through rural areas as well as the communities of [[Lusby, Maryland|Lusby]], [[Port Republic, Maryland|Port Republic]], [[Prince Frederick, Maryland|Prince Frederick]], and [[Huntingtown, Maryland|Huntingtown]]. In [[Sunderland, Maryland|Sunderland]], MD 2 splits from MD 4 and continues north as two-lane undivided Solomons Island Road into [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland|Anne Arundel County]], still passing through rural areas. Upon reaching [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], the route runs concurrent with [[U.S. Route 50 in Maryland|US 50]] and [[U.S. Route 301 in Maryland|US 301]] around the city. Between Annapolis and Baltimore, MD 2 runs along the '''Governor Ritchie Highway''' (also known as the Ritchie Highway), a multilane divided highway that heads through suburban areas, passing through [[Arnold, Maryland|Arnold]], [[Severna Park, Maryland|Severna Park]], [[Pasadena, Maryland|Pasadena]], [[Glen Burnie, Maryland|Glen Burnie]], and [[Brooklyn Park, Maryland|Brooklyn Park]]. In Baltimore, the route heads north on city streets and passes through the [[downtown Baltimore|downtown]] area of the city.\n\nWhat would become part of MD 2 was originally planned as two different state roads in 1909. The portion between Solomons and Annapolis was built as a gravel road called Solomons Island Road between 1910 and 1915. The portion of road between Annapolis and Glen Burnie was built as part of the Baltimore&ndash;Annapolis Boulevard, a road authorized in 1910 to connect Baltimore and Annapolis and was completed in 1924 with the construction of a bridge over the [[Severn River (Maryland)|Severn River]] leading to Annapolis. A state road between Glen Burnie and Baltimore was completed in 1911. MD 2 was designated in 1927 between Solomons and Baltimore, using Solomons Island Road, streets through Annapolis, the Baltimore&ndash;Annapolis Boulevard, and the state road between Glen Burnie and Baltimore. MD 2 was marked up to US 1 in Baltimore in 1939. In the 1930s, MD 2 was realigned onto the four-lane Governor Ritchie Highway between Annapolis and Baltimore; the former routing along Baltimore&ndash;Annapolis Boulevard became [[Maryland Route 648|MD 648]]. Ritchie Highway became a divided highway in 1950. Between the 1930s and the 1950s, several upgrades and realignments occurred to the portion of MD 2 between Solomons and Annapolis. MD 2 was realigned to bypass Annapolis on the US 50 freeway in 1955, with [[Maryland Route 450|MD 450]] replacing the route through Annapolis. The route between Solomons and Sunderland became concurrent with [[Maryland Route 416|MD 416]] in 1960, which was renumbered to MD 4 in 1965. Between the 1960s and the 1980s, MD 2/MD 4 between Solomons and Sunderland was widened into a divided highway, with the bypassed former alignments becoming multiple sections of [[Maryland Route 765|MD 765]]. The Ritchie Highway portion of the route was originally the main route between Annapolis and Baltimore until [[Interstate 97]] (I-97) was completed in the 1990s.\n\n==Route description==\nMD 2 serves as a north\u2013south route located a short distance to the west of the [[Chesapeake Bay]] in [[Calvert County, Maryland|Calvert]] and [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland|Anne Arundel]] counties and in the city of [[Baltimore]] in Maryland. In Calvert County, the route runs through mostly rural areas, passing through the communities of [[Solomons, Maryland|Solomons Island]], [[Lusby, Maryland|Lusby]], [[Port Republic, Maryland|Port Republic]], [[Prince Frederick, Maryland|Prince Frederick]], [[Huntingtown, Maryland|Huntingtown]], [[Sunderland, Maryland|Sunderland]], and [[Owings, Maryland|Owings]]. Between Solomons Island and Sunderland, the route runs [[concurrency (road)|concurrent]] with [[Maryland Route 4|MD 4]]. In Anne Arundel County, MD 2 runs through rural areas of the southern part of the county before reaching the [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]] area, where it shares a concurrency with the [[John Hanson Highway]]. From Annapolis, the route heads through suburban areas in the northern part of Anne Arundel County as the Ritchie Highway, passing through [[Arnold, Maryland|Arnold]], [[Severna Park, Maryland|Severna Park]], [[Pasadena, Maryland|Pasadena]], [[Glen Burnie, Maryland|Glen Burnie]], and [[Brooklyn Park, Maryland|Brooklyn Park]].

The route runs [[concurrency (road)|concurrent]] with [[Maryland Route 4|MD 4]] through much of Calvert County along a four-lane [[divided highway]] known as Solomons Island Road, passing through rural areas as well as the communities of [[Lusby, Maryland|Lusby]], [[Port Republic, Maryland|Port Republic]], [[Prince Frederick, Maryland|Prince Frederick]], and [[Huntingtown, Maryland|Huntingtown]]. In [[Sunderland, Maryland|Sunderland]], MD 2 splits from MD 4 and continues north as two-lane undivided Solomons Island Road into [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland|Anne Arundel County]], still passing through rural areas. Upon reaching [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], the route runs concurrent with [[U.S. Route 50 in Maryland|US 50]] and [[U.S. Route 301 in Maryland|US 301]] around the city. Between Annapolis and Baltimore, MD 2 runs along the '''Governor Ritchie Highway''' (also known as the Ritchie Highway), a multilane divided highway that heads through suburban areas, passing through [[Arnold, Maryland|Arnold]], [[Severna Park, Maryland|Severna Park]], [[Pasadena, Maryland|Pasadena]], [[Glen Burnie, Maryland|Glen Burnie]], and [[Brooklyn Park, Maryland|Brooklyn Park]]. In Baltimore, the route heads north on city streets and passes through the [[downtown Baltimore|downtown]] area of the city.\n\nWhat would become part of MD 2 was originally planned as two different state roads in 1909. The portion between Solomons and Annapolis was built as a gravel road called Solomons Island Road between 1910 and 1915. The portion of road between Annapolis and Glen Burnie was built as part of the Baltimore&ndash;Annapolis Boulevard, a road authorized in 1910 to connect Baltimore and Annapolis and was completed in 1924 with the construction of a bridge over the [[Severn River (Maryland)|Severn River]] leading to Annapolis. A state road between Glen Burnie and Baltimore was completed in 1911. MD 2 was designated in 1927 between Solomons and Baltimore, using Solomons Island Road, streets through Annapolis, the Baltimore&ndash;Annapolis Boulevard, and the state road between Glen Burnie and Baltimore. MD 2 was marked up to US 1 in Baltimore in 1939. In the 1930s, MD 2 was realigned onto the four-lane Governor Ritchie Highway between Annapolis and Baltimore; the former routing along Baltimore&ndash;Annapolis Boulevard became [[Maryland Route 648|MD 648]]. Ritchie Highway became a divided highway in 1950. Between the 1930s and the 1950s, several upgrades and realignments occurred to the portion of MD 2 between Solomons and Annapolis. MD 2 was realigned to bypass Annapolis on the US 50 freeway in 1955, with [[Maryland Route 450|MD 450]] replacing the route through Annapolis. The route between Solomons and Sunderland became concurrent with [[Maryland Route 416|MD 416]] in 1960, which was renumbered to MD 4 in 1965. Between the 1960s and the 1980s, MD 2/MD 4 between Solomons and Sunderland was widened into a divided highway, with the bypassed former alignments becoming multiple sections of [[Maryland Route 765|MD 765]]. The Ritchie Highway portion of the route was originally the main route between Annapolis and Baltimore until [[Interstate 97]] (I-97) was completed in the 1990s.\n\n==Route description==\nMD 2 serves as a north\u2013south route located a short distance to the west of the [[Chesapeake Bay]] in [[Calvert County, Maryland|Calvert]] and [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland|Anne Arundel]] counties and in the city of [[Baltimore]] in Maryland. In Calvert County, the route runs through mostly rural areas, passing through the communities of [[Solomons, Maryland|Solomons Island]], [[Lusby, Maryland|Lusby]], [[Port Republic, Maryland|Port Republic]], [[Prince Frederick, Maryland|Prince Frederick]], [[Huntingtown, Maryland|Huntingtown]], [[Sunderland, Maryland|Sunderland]], and [[Owings, Maryland|Owings]]. Between Solomons Island and Sunderland, the route runs [[concurrency (road)|concurrent]] with [[Maryland Route 4|MD 4]]. In Anne Arundel County, MD 2 runs through rural areas of the southern part of the county before reaching the [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]] area, where it shares a concurrency with the [[John Hanson Highway]]. From Annapolis, the route heads through suburban areas in the northern part of Anne Arundel County as the Ritchie Highway, passing through [[Arnold, Maryland|Arnold]], [[Severna Park, Maryland|Severna Park]], [[Pasadena, Maryland|Pasadena]], [[Glen Burnie, Maryland|Glen Burnie]], and [[Brooklyn Park, Maryland|Brooklyn Park]].

It was not until 1222 that the little settlement of Neuilly, established on the banks of the [[Seine]], was mentioned for the first time in a [[charter]] of the [[Saint-Denis Basilica|Abbey of Saint-Denis]]: the name was recorded in [[Medieval Latin]] as ''Portus de Lulliaco'', meaning \"Port of Lulliacum.\" In 1224 another charter of Saint-Denis recorded the name as ''Lugniacum.'' In a sales contract dated 1266, the name was also recorded as ''Luingni.''\n\nIn 1316, however, in a ruling of the ''[[parlement]]'' of Paris, the name was recorded as ''Nully'', a different name from those recorded before. In a document dated 1376 the name was again recorded as ''Nulliacum'' (the Medieval Latin version of ''Nully''). Then in the following centuries the name recorded alternated between ''Luny'' and ''Nully'', and it is only after 1648 that the name was definitely set as ''Nully''. The name spelt ''Neuilly'' after the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise|French Academy]] standard of pronunciation of the ''ill'' as a ''y'' (see IPA at the top).\n\nVarious explanations and etymologies have been proposed to explain these discrepancies in the names of Neuilly recorded over the centuries. The original name of Neuilly may have been ''Lulliacum'' or ''Lugniacum'', and that it was only later corrupted into ''Nulliacum'' / ''Nully''. Some interpret ''Lulliacum'' or ''Lugniacum'' as meaning \"estate of Lullius (or Lunius)\", probably a [[Gallo-Roman]] landowner. This interpretation is based on the many placenames of France made up of the names of Gallo-Roman landowners and suffixed with the traditional placename suffix \"-acum.\" Other researchers, however, object that it is unlikely that Neuilly owes its name to a Gallo-Roman [[patronym]], because during the Roman occupation of [[Gaul]] the area of Neuilly was inside the large [[Forest of Rouvray]], of which the [[Bois de Boulogne]] is all that remains today, and was probably not a settlement.\n\nThese researchers contend that it is only after the fall of the Roman Empire and the Germanic invasions that the area of Neuilly was deforested and settled. Thus, they think that the name ''Lulliacum'' or ''Lugniacum'' comes from the ancient Germanic word ''lund'' meaning \"forest\", akin to [[Old Norse]] ''lundr'' meaning \"grove\", to which the placename suffix \"-acum\" was added. The Old Norse word ''lundr'' has indeed left many placenames across Europe, such as the city of [[Lund]] in Sweden, the Forest of the Londe in [[Normandy]], or the many English placenames containing \"lound\", \"lownde\", or \"lund\" in their name, or ending in \"-land.\" This interesting theory, however, fails to explain why the \"d\" of ''lund'' is missing in ''Lulliacum'' or ''Lugniacum''.\n\nConcerning the discrepancy in names over the centuries, the most probable explanation is that the original name ''Lulliacum'' or ''Lugniacum'' was later corrupted into ''Nulliacum'' / ''Nully'' by inversion of the consonants, perhaps under the influence of an old Celtic word meaning \"swampy land, boggy land\" (as was the land around Neuilly-sur-Seine in ancient times) which is found in the name of many French places anciently covered with water, such as Noue, No\u00eb, Nouan, Nohant, etc. Or perhaps the consonants were simply inverted under the influence of the many settlements of France called Neuilly (a frequent place name whose etymology is completely different from the special case of Neuilly-sur-Seine).\n\nUntil the [[French Revolution]], the settlement was often referred to as ''Port-Neuilly'', but at the creation of [[commune in France|French communes]] in 1790 the \"Port\" was dropped and the newly born commune was named simply '''Neuilly'''.\n\nOn 1 January 1860, the city of Paris was enlarged by annexing neighbouring communes. On that occasion, a part of the territory of Neuilly-sur-Seine was annexed by the city of Paris, and forms now the neighbourhood of [[Ternes]], in the [[XVIIe arrondissement|17th arrondissement]] of Paris.\n\nOn 11 January 1867, part of the territory of Neuilly-sur-Seine was detached and merged with a part of the territory of [[Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine|Clichy]] to create the commune of [[Levallois-Perret]].\n\nOn 4 June 1878, a [[:fr:Synagogue de Neuilly|Synagogue]]  was founded on Rue Ancelle, which is the oldest synagogue of Paris' suburbs.\n\nOn 2 May 1897, the commune name officially became Neuilly-sur-Seine (meaning \"Neuilly upon [[Seine]]\"), in order to distinguish it from the [[Neuilly|many communes of France also called Neuilly]]. Most people, however, continue to refer to Neuilly-sur-Seine as simply \"Neuilly.\" During the [[1900 Summer Olympics]], it hosted the [[Basque pelota at the 1900 Summer Olympics|basque pelota]] events.<ref>[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1900/PEL/mens-two-man-teams-with-cesta.html Sports-reference.com Summer Olympics Paris 14 June 1900 men's basque pelota two-teams results.], Sports-reference.com, Accessed 14 November 2010.</ref>\n\nThe [[American Hospital of Paris]] was founded in 1906.\n\nIn 1919, the [[Treaty of Neuilly]] was signed with [[Bulgaria]] in Neuilly-sur-Seine to conclude its role in World War I.\n\nIn 1929, the [[Bois de Boulogne]], which was hitherto divided between the communes of Neuilly-sur-Seine and [[Boulogne-Billancourt]], was annexed in its entirety by the city of Paris.\n\n==Main sites==\nIt was the site of the [[Ch\u00e2teau-de-Neuilly]], an important royal residence during the [[July Monarchy]].\n\n==Transport==\nNeuilly-sur-Seine is served by three stations on [[Paris M\u00e9tro Line 1]]: [[Porte Maillot (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Porte Maillot]] (with a direct access to RER line C), [[Les Sablons (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Les Sablons]] and [[Pont de Neuilly (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Pont de Neuilly]].\n\nRATP Bus service includes the lines 43, 73, 82, 93, 157, 158, 163, 164, 174 [http://www.ville-neuillysurseine.fr/files/neuilly/decouvrir/acces/plan-secteur-6-ratp.pdf]\n\nNight Bus lines include N11 and N24.\n\n==Economy==\nLocated near France's main business district [[La D\u00e9fense]], Neuilly-sur-Seine also hosts several corporate headquarters:\n[[Bureau Veritas]], [[Chanel]], [[Marathon Media]], [[JCDecaux]],<ref>\"[http://www.jcdecaux.com/en/layout/set/print/content/view/full/114 Legal disclaimer]\n{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316183931/http://www.jcdecaux.com/en/layout/set/print/content/view/full/114 |date=2014-03-16 }}.\"{{sic}} [[JCDecaux]].

Most people, however, continue to refer to Neuilly-sur-Seine as simply \"Neuilly.\" During the [[1900 Summer Olympics]], it hosted the [[Basque pelota at the 1900 Summer Olympics|basque pelota]] events.<ref>[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1900/PEL/mens-two-man-teams-with-cesta.html Sports-reference.com Summer Olympics Paris 14 June 1900 men's basque pelota two-teams results.], Sports-reference.com, Accessed 14 November 2010.</ref>\n\nThe [[American Hospital of Paris]] was founded in 1906.\n\nIn 1919, the [[Treaty of Neuilly]] was signed with [[Bulgaria]] in Neuilly-sur-Seine to conclude its role in World War I.\n\nIn 1929, the [[Bois de Boulogne]], which was hitherto divided between the communes of Neuilly-sur-Seine and [[Boulogne-Billancourt]], was annexed in its entirety by the city of Paris.\n\n==Main sites==\nIt was the site of the [[Ch\u00e2teau-de-Neuilly]], an important royal residence during the [[July Monarchy]].\n\n==Transport==\nNeuilly-sur-Seine is served by three stations on [[Paris M\u00e9tro Line 1]]: [[Porte Maillot (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Porte Maillot]] (with a direct access to RER line C), [[Les Sablons (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Les Sablons]] and [[Pont de Neuilly (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Pont de Neuilly]].\n\nRATP Bus service includes the lines 43, 73, 82, 93, 157, 158, 163, 164, 174 [http://www.ville-neuillysurseine.fr/files/neuilly/decouvrir/acces/plan-secteur-6-ratp.pdf]\n\nNight Bus lines include N11 and N24.\n\n==Economy==\nLocated near France's main business district [[La D\u00e9fense]], Neuilly-sur-Seine also hosts several corporate headquarters:\n[[Bureau Veritas]], [[Chanel]], [[Marathon Media]], [[JCDecaux]],<ref>\"[http://www.jcdecaux.com/en/layout/set/print/content/view/full/114 Legal disclaimer]\n{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316183931/http://www.jcdecaux.com/en/layout/set/print/content/view/full/114 |date=2014-03-16 }}.\"{{sic}} [[JCDecaux]].
