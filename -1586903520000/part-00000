The CP was the only political party allowed to participate in the elections. A small minority of candidates did not belong formally to the CP but were chosen through the same government-controlled selection process. The government saturated the media and used government ministries, CP entities, and mass organizations to urge voters to cast a \u201cunified vote\u201d where marking one box automatically selected all candidates on the ballot form.\n\nDuring the year there were elections for nearly 15 thousand local representatives to the municipal assemblies. After the first run-off election, the government reported that 96.6 percent of the electorate had voted. While the law allows citizens not to vote, CDRs often pressured neighborhood residents to cast ballots.

The E.U. describes the Cuban decision-making process thus: \"Elections for the National Assembly, where only candidates approved by the local authorities can partake, take place every five years. When the National Assembly, which meets twice-yearly, is not in session the 31-member Council of State wields legislative power. The Council of Ministers, through its 9-member executive committee, exercises executive and administrative power. Although the Constitution provides for independent judiciary, it explicitly subordinates it to the National Assembly and to the Council of State.

Fidel Castro dominates the political system, having transformed the country into a one-party state with the Cuban Communist Party (PCC) controlling all governmental entities from the national to the local level. Castro is responsible for every appointment and controls every lever of power in Cuba in his various roles as president of the Council of Ministers, chairman of the Council of State, commander in chief of the Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR), and first secretary of the PCC. In October 2002, some eight million Cubans voted in tightly controlled municipal elections. On January 19, 2003, an election was held for the Cuban National Assembly, with just 609 candidates - all supported by the regime - vying for 609 seats.

It is based on some simple premises: all citizens are born with the right to choose their own leaders, to define their own destiny, to speak freely, to organize political parties, trade unions and non-governmental groups, and to have fair and open trials.\u201d\n\nThe 2006 report from [[Human Rights Watch]] states: \u201cCuba remains a Latin American anomaly: an undemocratic government that represses nearly all forms of political dissent. President Fidel Castro, now in his forty-seventh year in power, shows no willingness to consider even minor reforms. Instead, his government continues to enforce political conformity using criminal prosecutions, long- and short-term detentions, mob harassment, police warnings, surveillance, house arrests, travel restrictions, and {{Sic|hide=y|politically|-}}motivated dismissals from employment.

Roman also writes that the historical origins of contemporary Cuban democracy are the ideas of the centrality of unity and consensus, and the rejection of a distinction between political and civil society.

The CP was the only political party allowed to participate in the elections. A small minority of candidates did not belong formally to the CP but were chosen through the same government-controlled selection process. The government saturated the media and used government ministries, CP entities, and mass organizations to urge voters to cast a \u201cunified vote\u201d where marking one box automatically selected all candidates on the ballot form.\n\nDuring the year there were elections for nearly 15 thousand local representatives to the municipal assemblies. After the first run-off election, the government reported that 96.6 percent of the electorate had voted. While the law allows citizens not to vote, CDRs often pressured neighborhood residents to cast ballots.

The E.U. describes the Cuban decision-making process thus: \"Elections for the National Assembly, where only candidates approved by the local authorities can partake, take place every five years. When the National Assembly, which meets twice-yearly, is not in session the 31-member Council of State wields legislative power. The Council of Ministers, through its 9-member executive committee, exercises executive and administrative power. Although the Constitution provides for independent judiciary, it explicitly subordinates it to the National Assembly and to the Council of State.

Fidel Castro dominates the political system, having transformed the country into a one-party state with the Cuban Communist Party (PCC) controlling all governmental entities from the national to the local level. Castro is responsible for every appointment and controls every lever of power in Cuba in his various roles as president of the Council of Ministers, chairman of the Council of State, commander in chief of the Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR), and first secretary of the PCC. In October 2002, some eight million Cubans voted in tightly controlled municipal elections. On January 19, 2003, an election was held for the Cuban National Assembly, with just 609 candidates - all supported by the regime - vying for 609 seats.

Whilst calling for democratic change, Carter also stressed that he was not using a U.S. definition of \u201cdemocracy.\u201d he explained that \u201cthe term is embedded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which Cuba signed in 1948. It is based on some simple premises: all citizens are born with the right to choose their own leaders, to define their own destiny, to speak freely, to organize political parties, trade unions and non-governmental groups, and to have fair and open trials.\u201d\n\nThe 2006 report from [[Human Rights Watch]] states: \u201cCuba remains a Latin American anomaly: an undemocratic government that represses nearly all forms of political dissent. President Fidel Castro, now in his forty-seventh year in power, shows no willingness to consider even minor reforms. Instead, his government continues to enforce political conformity using criminal prosecutions, long- and short-term detentions, mob harassment, police warnings, surveillance, house arrests, travel restrictions, and {{Sic|hide=y|politically|-}}motivated dismissals from employment.

He argues that at the \u201cpeople level\u201d democracy exists in Cuba today and that this democracy has been strengthened during the 1990s by conscious decisions made at the top. Roman also writes that the historical origins of contemporary Cuban democracy are the ideas of the centrality of unity and consensus, and the rejection of a distinction between political and civil society. Thus, unanimous votes in representative bodies do not represent, as critics charge, imposition by the PCC, but rather legitimate consensus worked out in lengthy discussion at several levels.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Representative Government in Socialist Cuba|jstor=2633828|pages=7\u201327|last1=Roman|first1=P.|volume=20|issue=1|journal=Latin American Perspectives|year=1993|doi=10.1177/0094582X9302000102}}</ref> British political professor Steve Ludlum wrote in his paper \u201cParticipation is key to Cuba\u2019s democracy\u201d that \u201cTwo models of democracy competed for support in nineteenth century Europe.

LeoGrande]], in a paper written for the Cuba Transition Project at the [[Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies]] at the [[University of Miami]], wrote of the 1992 election law: \"unprecedented openness in debate, not just among party members, but also among the entire populace, so as to foster greater participation and build 'the necessary consensus' for the government's policy response...Eventually, some three million people participated in the pre-Congress discussions\", but \"When the new electoral law was finalized\u2026 it dashed any hopes for a significant opening to alternative voices. The ban on campaigning was retained, and the nomination of provincial and national assembly candidates was entrusted to Candidacy Commissions. Through an elaborate process of consultation\u2026 the Candidacy Commissions\u2026 produced slates of nominees with just one candidate per seat. Voters only had the choice of voting yes or no. Thus, the election process at the provincial and national levels avoided the possibility of even implicit policy differences among candidates.\u201d<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040328120710/http://ctp.iccas.miami.edu/Research_Studies/WLeoGrande.pdf William M.

{"title_page": "Personal property", "text_new": "{{Other uses}}\n{{redirect|Personal effects}}\n{{Property law}}\n\n'''Personal property''' is [[property]] that is movable.<ref>\"Personal property\". Sir Robert Harry Inglis Palgrave. Dictionary of political economy, Volume 3. 1908. p. 96</ref> In [[common law]] systems, personal property may also be called '''chattels''' or '''personalty'''. In [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems, personal property is often called '''movable property''' or '''movables''' \u2013 any property that can be moved from one location to another.\n\nPersonal property can be understood in comparison to  [[real estate]], [[immovable property]] or [[real property]] (such as land and buildings). \n\nMovable property on land (larger [[livestock]], for example) was not automatically sold with the land, it was \"personal\" to the owner and moved with the owner. \n\nThe word ''cattle'' is the Old [[Norman language|Norman]] variant of [[Old French]] ''chatel'', chattel (derived from Latin ''capitalis'', \u201cof the head\u201d), which was once synonymous with general movable personal property. <ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/chattel Origin of chattel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814050019/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/chattel |date=2009-08-14 }}, accessed August 15, 2009</ref>\n\n==Classifications==\nPersonal property may be classified in a variety of ways.\n\n===Intangible===\nIntangible personal property or \"intangibles\" refers to personal property that cannot actually be moved, touched or felt, but instead represents something of value such as [[negotiable instrument]]s, [[security (finance)|securities]], [[service (economics)]], and [[intangible asset]]s including [[Chose (English law)|chose in action]].\n\n===Tangible===\nTangible personal property refers to any type of property that can generally be moved (i.e., it is not attached to real property or land), touched or felt. These generally include items such as furniture, clothing, jewelry, art, writings, or household goods. In some cases, there can be formal title documents that show the ownership and transfer rights of that property after a person's death (for example, motor vehicles, boats, etcetera) In many cases, however, tangible personal property will not be \"titled\" in an owner's name and is presumed to be whatever property he or she was in possession of at the time of his or her death.\n\n===Other distinctions===\nAccountants also distinguish personal property from real property because personal property can be [[depreciate]]d faster than improvements (while land is not depreciable at all). It is an owner's right to get tax benefits for chattel, and there are businesses that specialize in appraising personal property, or chattel.\n\nThe distinction between these types of property is significant for a variety of reasons. Usually one's rights on movables are more attenuated than one's rights on immovables (or real property). The [[statute of limitations|statutes of limitations]] or [[prescriptive period]]s are usually shorter when dealing with personal or movable property. Real property rights are usually enforceable for a much longer period of time and in most jurisdictions real estate and immovables are registered in government-sanctioned land registers. In some jurisdictions, rights (such as a [[lien]] or other security interest) can be registered against personal or movable property.\n\nIn the common law it is possible to place a [[mortgage law|mortgage]] upon real property. Such mortgage requires payment or the owner of the mortgage can seek [[foreclosure]]. Personal property can often be secured with similar kind of device, variously called a [[chattel mortgage]], trust receipt, or [[security interest]]. In the United States, Article 9 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] governs the creation and enforcement of security interests in most (but not all) types of personal property.\n\nThere is no similar institution to the mortgage in the civil law, however a [[hypothec]] is a device to secure [[real right]]s against property. These real rights follow the property along with the ownership. In the common law a lien also remains on the property and it is not extinguished by alienation of the property; liens may be real or [[Equity (law)|equitable]].\n\nMany jurisdictions levy a personal [[property tax]], an annual tax on the privilege of owning or possessing personal property within the boundaries of the jurisdiction. Automobile and boat registration fees are a subset of this tax. Most household goods are exempt as long as they are kept or used within the household; the tax usually becomes a problem when the taxing authority discovers that expensive personal property like art is being regularly stored outside of the household.\n\nThe distinction between tangible and intangible personal property is also significant in some of the jurisdictions which impose sales taxes. In Canada, for example, provincial and federal sales taxes were imposed primarily on sales of tangible personal property whereas sales of intangibles tended to be exempt. The move to value added taxes, under which almost all transactions are taxable, has diminished the significance of the distinction.\n\n==Personal versus private property==\nIn political/economic theory, notably [[socialist]], [[Marxist]], and most [[anarchist]] philosophies, the distinction between private and personal property is extremely important. Which items of property constitute which is open to debate. In some economic systems, such as [[capitalism]], private and personal property are considered to be exactly equivalent.\n\n* Personal property or [[Possession (law)|possession]]s includes \"items intended for personal use\" (e.g., one's [[toothbrush]], clothes, homes, and vehicles, and sometimes money).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Friedland |first1=William H. |author1-link=William H.
