Hero Angeles bested four other contestants in the Grand Finals for the title \"Grand Teen Questor\" in the first season of [[ABS-CBN]]'s popular [[reality television|reality]] star search in the [[Philippines]], ''[[Star Circle Quest]]''.\n\n== Career==\nAfter winning the title of the first \"Grand Teen Questor\" of [[ABS-CBN]]'s ''[[Star Circle Quest]]'', Hero appeared in several TV shows on the network, like the youth oriented program ''[[SCQ Reload]]'' and the fantasy series ''[[Krystala]]'', led by [[Judy Ann Santos]]. He was one of the hottest young stars in 2004, and his Love team with [[Sandara Park]] was popular, making box-office hits like ''[[Bcuz Of U]]'' and ''[[Can This Be Love]]''.\n\nIn 2005, Hero controversially ended his contract with [[ABS-CBN]] [[Star Magic]], and later appeared in various TV shows on [[ABS-CBN]]'s rival network, [[GMA Network|GMA-7]].  As of March 2008, Angeles is under the network contract of [[GMA Network]] with the management of [[German Moreno]] and brother Henry Angeles. His first break was playing the role of Mark in ''[[Dyesebel (TV series)|Dyesebel]]'' which stars [[Marian Rivera]] and [[Dingdong Dantes]]. After Dyesebel, he played one of the main villains in ''[[Luna Mystika]]'', which starred his fellow former Kapamilya star [[Heart Evangelista]] and [[Mark Anthony Fernandez]].\n\nAngeles also made his directorial debut in 2007 entitled ''Stockroom'', blending modern scares with social issues on employment of language teachers in the Philippines. It was sold-out at the Cinemalaya Philippine Independent Film Festival. The film also had its World Premiere at the prestigious St. James Cavalier Theatre in Valletta, Malta in Europe on November 2007. After joining ''[[Luna Mystika]]'' Angeles will join the first ''[[Sine Novela]]'' of [[Jennylyn Mercado]] and [[Mark Herras]] that entitled ''[[Sine Novela]]'': ''[[Paano Ba Ang Mangarap?]]''.\n\nSince 2006, Angeles has been a regular co-host of German 'Kuya Germs' Moreno in the Saturday late night show ''[[Walang Tulugan with the Master Showman]]''. shown through GMA and GMA Pinoy TV. Hero was also a student of University of the Philippines Diliman, College of Fine Arts. When ''[[Endless Love (2010 TV series)|Endless Love]]'' Philippine TV remake was in production, rumor had it that he was considered for the role of Andrew, which was eventually portrayed by Dennis Trillo in the series. It was also rumored in June 2011 that he would be part of ''[[Captain Barbell (2011 TV series)|Captain Barbell]]''.\n\nHero is now endorsing the Philippine Tourism shirts, [[Favola Shirts]] - a project of the Pag-asa Social Center Foundation, Inc. located in Tagaytay City. The shirts are produced by the out-of-school youth of Tagaytay. Hero had donated some of his designs to this project.\n\nDecember 1, 2014. Hero launched his first Online Art Gallery called ARTCETERO. Artcetero is a venue of expression of thoughts and ideas. He creates artwork of different kinds.

Hero Angeles bested four other contestants in the Grand Finals for the title \"Grand Teen Questor\" in the first season of [[ABS-CBN]]'s popular [[reality television|reality]] star search in the [[Philippines]], ''[[Star Circle Quest]]''.\n\n== Career==\nAfter winning the title of the first \"Grand Teen Questor\" of [[ABS-CBN]]'s ''[[Star Circle Quest]]'', Hero appeared in several TV shows on the network, like the youth oriented program ''[[SCQ Reload]]'' and the fantasy series ''[[Krystala]]'', led by [[Judy Ann Santos]]. He was one of the hottest young stars in 2004, and his Love team with [[Sandara Park]] was popular, making box-office hits like ''[[Bcuz Of U]]'' and ''[[Can This Be Love]]''.\n\nIn 2005, Hero controversially ended his contract with [[ABS-CBN]] [[Star Magic]], and later appeared in various TV shows on [[ABS-CBN]]'s rival network, [[GMA Network|GMA-7]].  As of March 2008, Angeles is under the network contract of [[GMA Network]] with the management of [[German Moreno]] and brother Henry Angeles. His first break was playing the role of Mark in ''[[Dyesebel (TV series)|Dyesebel]]'' which stars [[Marian Rivera]] and [[Dingdong Dantes]]. After Dyesebel, he played one of the main villains in ''[[Luna Mystika]]'', which starred his fellow former Kapamilya star [[Heart Evangelista]] and [[Mark Anthony Fernandez]].\n\nAngeles also made his directorial debut in 2007 entitled ''Stockroom'', blending modern scares with social issues on employment of language teachers in the Philippines. It was sold-out at the Cinemalaya Philippine Independent Film Festival. The film also had its World Premiere at the prestigious St. James Cavalier Theatre in Valletta, Malta in Europe on November 2007. After joining ''[[Luna Mystika]]'' Angeles will join the first ''[[Sine Novela]]'' of [[Jennylyn Mercado]] and [[Mark Herras]] that entitled ''[[Sine Novela]]'': ''[[Paano Ba Ang Mangarap?]]''.\n\nSince 2006, Angeles has been a regular co-host of German 'Kuya Germs' Moreno in the Saturday late night show ''[[Walang Tulugan with the Master Showman]]''. shown through GMA and GMA Pinoy TV. Hero was also a student of University of the Philippines Diliman, College of Fine Arts. When ''[[Endless Love (2010 TV series)|Endless Love]]'' Philippine TV remake was in production, rumor had it that he was considered for the role of Andrew, which was eventually portrayed by Dennis Trillo in the series. It was also rumored in June 2011 that he would be part of ''[[Captain Barbell (2011 TV series)|Captain Barbell]]''.\n\nHero is now endorsing the Philippine Tourism shirts, [[Favola Shirts]] - a project of the Pag-asa Social Center Foundation, Inc. located in Tagaytay City. The shirts are produced by the out-of-school youth of Tagaytay. Hero had donated some of his designs to this project.\n\nDecember 1, 2014. Hero launched his first Online Art Gallery called ARTCETERO. Artcetero is a venue of expression of thoughts and ideas. He creates artwork of different kinds. He aims to share his talent through the page in hopes of helping and inspiring others. 50% of the profit generated by his artwork is used to fund causes like iCancerVive and 'From the bottom of My heART'.\n\nIn 2018, Hero Angeles returns in a new ABS-CBN drama series \"Halik\" portraying a unique gay role as Atty.

A total of 22 women competed in this event, limited to [[j\u016bd\u014dka]] with a body weight of less than 70 kilograms. Preliminary rounds started at 12:00 Noon [[China Standard Time|CST]]. [[Repechage]] finals, semifinals, bouts for bronze medals and the final were held at 18:00pm CST.\n\nThis event was the third-heaviest of the women's judo weight classes, limiting competitors to a maximum of 70 kilograms of body mass. Like all other judo events, bouts lasted five minutes. If the bout was still tied at the end, it was extended for another five-minute, sudden-death period; if neither judoka scored during that period, the match is decided by the judges. The tournament bracket consisted of a single-elimination contest culminating in a gold medal match. There was also a repechage to determine the winners of the two bronze medals. Each judoka who had lost to a semifinalist competed in the repechage. The two judokas who lost in the semifinals faced the winner of the opposite half of the bracket's repechage in bronze medal bouts.\n\n==Qualifying athletes==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Olympics}}\nThe '''women's 70&nbsp;kg''' (also known as ''middleweight'') tournament in the '''[[judo at the 2008 Summer Olympics]]''' was held on August 13 at the [[Beijing Science and Technology University Gymnasium]]. A total of 22 women competed in this event, limited to [[j\u016bd\u014dka]] with a body weight of less than 70 kilograms. Preliminary rounds started at 12:00 Noon [[China Standard Time|CST]]. [[Repechage]] finals, semifinals, bouts for bronze medals and the final were held at 18:00pm CST.\n\nThis event was the third-heaviest of the women's judo weight classes, limiting competitors to a maximum of 70 kilograms of body mass. Like all other judo events, bouts lasted five minutes. If the bout was still tied at the end, it was extended for another five-minute, sudden-death period; if neither judoka scored during that period, the match is decided by the judges. The tournament bracket consisted of a single-elimination contest culminating in a gold medal match. There was also a repechage to determine the winners of the two bronze medals. Each judoka who had lost to a semifinalist competed in the repechage. The two judokas who lost in the semifinals faced the winner of the opposite half of the bracket's repechage in bronze medal bouts.\n\n==Qualifying athletes==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

The film opens with Shankar escaping from jail while being chased by the police. He beats up the police and escapes in a truck where he recollects the past.\n\nWhile extorting money from an apartment builder, he encounters Chandni, who is a fearless girl and even goes to the extent of slapping Shankar. He gets impressed by this and falls for her. After a few altercations, she reciprocates. Once Shankar murders Kasi Vishwanath on Kaka's orders, he escapes to Goa with Chandni.\n\nHowever, the police find out his location and track him down. While escaping, Chandni is shot and killed. Shankar is beside himself with grief and swears to kill the person who killed her.\n\nIn a parallel storyline, Sara is a neuroscientist who is working on memory transfer and has achieved successful results with rats. Her boyfriend, Arun is a CBI officer who is trying to crack the case of the murder of Kasi Vishwanath. He believes there is a higher force that planned and killed him.\n\nShankar finds out that Kaka was ordered to kill him as well and murders Kaka when he plans to escape in Sarah's car. He flees while Sarah calls Arun. Arun catches a guy running but the guy is killed when a car hits him. Arun's higher-ups are after him to find the killer and while Arun is about to crack the case, he is shot and killed by goons. The CBI is desperate to know who the murderer is, so with Sarah's help, they transfer Arun's memory to Shankar, knowing full well doing so will remove his past.\n\nShankar wakes up and experiences shocks and memories that aren't his own. He gets enraged when Sarah reveals the truth to him and realizes that he will not remember Chandni in a few days. He experiences brief flashes where he becomes Arun but reverts to being Shankar.\n\nHe finds Arun's house and discovers a bag that has all the proof who the murderer is, who turns out to be Ramamoorthy and Devendra. He pursues them under the guise of Shankar and in the end, Devendra is killed at the hands of Shankar.
