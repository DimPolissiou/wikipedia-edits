The station is located on the [[Arnhem-Oberhausen railway]] and the [[Bocholt-Wesel railway]]. The train services are operated by [[Deutsche Bahn]] and [[Abellio Deutschland]].\n\n== History==\nAs early as 1832, the Dutch Lieutenant Brade proposed the construction of a railway on the west bank of the Rhine from [[Amsterdam]] to [[Cologne]]. After preparatory work in the [[Netherlands]] had been largely completed, Brade began the first surveys in [[Prussia]]. He sought support from the Mayor of Wesel, who initially opposed the project. The town was more interested in expanding traffic on the [[Rhine]] and the [[Lippe (river)|Lippe]]. The town's view only changed after the opening of the first railway lines in Germany.{{sfn|Kocks|2005|pp=321\u2013325}}\n \nA railway committee was founded in Wesel under the leadership of Ludwig Bischoff, the headmaster of the Wesel high school, on 2&nbsp;March 1841. During the preliminary considerations for the construction of the [[Cologne-Minden trunk line|Cologne\u2013Minden railway]], the committee proposed a line through Wesel, [[M\u00fcnster]] and [[Bielefeld]] to [[Minden]]. Bischoff referred in a memorandum to the advantages of this route, which could in the long term link the fortress city of Wesel with the [[Province of Westphalia|Westphalian]] provincial capital of M\u00fcnster and the Prussian capital of Berlin, and suggested that it would support the movement towards [[German Question|German national unity]]. In addition, the northern route was the shortest connection from Berlin to the Rhine and was favourable for railway building. The head of the Cologne-Minden Railway Committee, [[David Hansemann]], rejected the initiative on the grounds that the line chosen should be the shortest route, especially since the connection between Berlin and the fortified city of Cologne was more important{{sfn|Kocks|2005|pp=321\u2013325}}{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=20\u201322}}\n \nAfter Hansemann's rejection, the Wesel Committee concentrated increasingly on a link between Cologne and Amsterdam, which would connect the [[Ruhr]] with the [[North Sea]]. The town of [[Emmerich am Rhein|Emmerich]], which was also seeking a connection at the time, received approval by cabinet order on 15&nbsp;September 1845 for preparatory work for the construction of a branch line from [[Oberhausen]] on the Cologne-Minden Railway via Wesel and Emmerich with a connection to the [[Amsterdam\u2013Arnhem railway]], which was opened between 1843 and 1845. The Wesel and Emmerich Committee merged into a joint committee based in Wesel on 22&nbsp;January 1846. After the [[German revolutions of 1848\u20131849#Prussia|March Revolution]] in 1848, Ludwig Bischoff had to resign from the school and leave the town of Wesel and the committee due to his liberal views.{{sfn|Kocks|2005|pp=321\u2013325}}{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=20\u201322}}\n \nIn 1850, the town again contacted the Prussian Ministry of Commerce to promote the construction of the line. The town emphasised its loyalty to the king and the [[House of Hohenzollern]] and referred to its importance as the most northwestern bulwark in Prussia. To compensate for the obstacles associated with the law governing its fortress status, the town sought financial support for the line\u2019s construction and equal treatment with other unprofitable lines. As an alternative to the state assuming all construction costs, Wesel proposed state participation in the capital raising for the construction and a declaration that it would guarantee interest at the rate of three and a half percent. The town continued to seek support from some senior military personnel; as early as 1843, the Prussian Ministry of War had endorsed a rail connection to Wesel. In November 1850, the Prussian Minister of Commerce [[August von der Heydt]] instructed Wesel to stop promoting the scheme and indicated that the current situation made it impossible to issue an interest guarantee. This reflected ongoing negotiations between Prussia and the Netherlands.{{sfn|Kocks|2005|pp=321\u2013325}}{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=20\u201322}}\n \nAfter the Netherlands agreed to change the line from Amsterdam to Arnhem from ({{Track gauge|1945 mm|allk=on}}) to ({{Track gauge|sg|allk=on}}), nothing stood in the way of the project. On 1&nbsp;October 1853, the [[Cologne-Minden Railway Company]] (''C\u00f6ln-Mindener Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft'', CME) received the concession for the Oberhausen\u2013Arnhem route. Planning in the Wesel area had begun on the basis of various preliminary contracts as early as 1852.{{sfn|Kocks|2005|pp=321\u2013325}}{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=20\u201322}}\n \n=== Construction and commissioning of the Oberhausen\u2013Arnhem railway ===\n \nThe construction of Wesel station was subjected to special conditions due to its proximity to the fortress. The Ministry of War initially wanted a station on the western side. This would have required the building of a 200&nbsp;[[Rod (unit)#In continental Europe|Prussian rod]] (\u2248&nbsp;753&nbsp;metre)-long embankment to protect against flooding and ice on the Lippe. In addition, the ''Rheintor'' (Rhine Gate), which formed the entrance to the pontoon bridge over the Rhine, would no longer have been usable by horse-riders and wagons. In this case, the railway would have built a opening bridge for the railway. In addition, the station could have been fired on from the other bank of the Rhine. A station on the eastern side, on the other hand, satisfied the town and the CME and was ultimately built due to the problems with the western option.{{sfn|Kocks|2005|pp=325\u2013327}} The CME intended to build the railway embankment to be flood-proof at 35&nbsp;[[Foot (unit)#Other obsolete feet|Prussian feet]] (\u2248&nbsp;11.0&nbsp;metres) above the level of Wesel. The military administration required a reduction in the overall height to 30&nbsp;feet (\u2248&nbsp;9.4&nbsp;m), and later to 28.5&nbsp;feet (\u2248&nbsp;8.9&nbsp;m).{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=22\u201327}}\n \nThe Ministry of War permitted the station to be built within the fortress area so that it would not be too far away from the town. Since buildings this close to the walls could have offered protection for attackers, the station buildings had to be single-storey and made of wood. In addition, they had to be able to be dismantled within a day. The construction also resulted in demands from the military to expand the fortifications substantially. To protect the existing fortress, the Ministry of War called for the construction of Fort Fusternberg on the land between the station and the Lippe (at a cost of 185,000&nbsp;[[Vereinsthaler|thalers]]). The ministry also required the construction of a tower fort with extended walls on the town side of Fort Fusternberg (135,000&nbsp;thalers) that would defend the Lippe crossing if Fort Fusternberg fell. [[Lunette (fortification)|Lunette]]&nbsp;23 would have to be raised because of the railway embankment (1500&nbsp;thalers). In addition, the construction of a horse-hauled railway including protective works from the station to the port was required in order to bring operating materials to safety in the fortress in the event of war (28,500&nbsp;thalers). The CME rejected the additional costs of 350,000&nbsp;thalers and declared itself ready to build a bulwark on the strong point of Flamer Schanze on the other side of the Lippe. The CME was ready to build the military railway, but was against the construction of the defensive structures. The company pointed out that the railway embankment would be demolished without compensation in the event of war and therefore could not bear the additional costs. In addition, the advantages of railway construction would be greater than the disadvantages for the fortress system. Since the Prussian Minister of War, [[Friedrich Graf von Waldersee]], was not ready to agree, but the commitments made to the Netherlands in relation to the construction of the railway could not be postponed, the matter was referred to the Prussian King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV]]. On 10&nbsp;April 1856 the CME agreed to pay half of the cost of 174,250&nbsp;thalers, while the other half was to be paid from the railway fund. The king approved the project on 14&nbsp;April 1856.{{sfn|Kocks|2005|pp=325\u2013327}}{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=22\u201327}}\n \nThe whole line became useable with the commissioning of the [[Dinslaken station|Dinslaken]]\u2013Wesel\u2013Emmerich section on 20&nbsp;October 1856.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=20\u201322}} The CME had held opening ceremonies over several days from 17&nbsp;October 1856, including, among other things, a special trip from [[Deutz, Cologne|Deutz]] to Amsterdam and back. While the outward journey between [[Ruhrort]] and Emmerich used water transport on the Rhine with a stop in Wesel, a train was taken for the return journey. No fixed program was originally planned in Wesel. Because the steam locomotive had to replenish its water supplies in Wesel, the people of Wesel decided to take advantage of this ten-minute break; the festival committee was informed of the project and made no objection. The mayor asked all the town councilors to gather on the platform in festive clothes when the train arrived at 12:30 p.m. and a music corps would also line up. In addition, the project was promoted in the town, so that the citizens would be present in large numbers. The project was implemented as planned.{{sfn|Kocks|2005|pp=325\u2013327}}\n \nIn the beginning, the station had a separate office building for the stationmaster in addition to the entrance building. An open loading ramp and loading road bordered the large goods shed. A two-track engine shed was available for the locomotives of the trains terminating in Wesel. Next to it was the water station; two [[water cranes]] were installed over a 1120&nbsp;cubic Prussian feet (\u2248&nbsp;34.6&nbsp;cubic metre) storage container. An average of 19&nbsp;officials and workers were employed at the station in 1858. The station precincts contained track with a length of 650&nbsp;rods (\u2248&nbsp;2.27&nbsp;km) and 16&nbsp;sets of points. There were already 22&nbsp;sets of points and 715&nbsp;rods (\u2248&nbsp;2,69&nbsp;km) of track in 1862. 25&nbsp;sets of points were installed in 1868 and 26&nbsp;sets of points in 1870. The number of employees temporarily dropped to 13, after the completion of the remaining work, then rose continuously to 28 in 1870. The CME established a tree nursery on some land that could not be sold in order to demarcate the railway area.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=22\u201327}}\n \nWesel station's freight traffic fell short of expectations in the early days, despite good traffic on the line. 101,375 outgoing passengers were counted at the station in 1858, which was similar to traffic at [[Essen-Altenessen station|Essen]] and [[Hamm (Westf) station|Hamm]]. Military tickets accounted for almost ten percent of passengers. The volume of freight traffic was significantly lower, with around 50 incoming and outgoing freight wagons per day. Due to the fortress ring, the establishment of factories within the town was technically impossible. Buildings outside the city walls were prohibited. The situation only changed gradually after the town was demilitarised in the early 1890s. Another disadvantage, which resulted from the fortress, was the route between town and the station. The entrance from Berliner Tor was angled and covered with [[gravel]] and coarse [[sand]]. Despite regular cleaning, the street was covered with horse manure and furrowed by [[wagon]] wheels. There was no paved sidewalk or railings to fence off the [[moat]]s. Since the street was not illuminated until the beginning of the 1860s, serious injuries and fatalities occurred after falls, especially at night or in thick fog. The military railway to the port went into operation on 3&nbsp;July 1865. The CME had delayed its construction because it feared that it would lose goods traffic to the shipping industry.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=22\u201327}}{{sfn|Kocks|2005|pp=328\u2013331}}\n \nThe first major renovation took place in 1870. The freight shed was expanded from 1059&nbsp;square feet (\u2248&nbsp;104.3&nbsp;square metres) to 5666&nbsp;square feet (\u2248&nbsp;558.1&nbsp;square metres) and the loading ramps for military traffic were extended. With the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] on 24&nbsp;July 1870, freight traffic was discontinued and passenger traffic was reduced from 18 trains to one pair per day. The [[mobilisation]] lasted until 14&nbsp;August 1870 and the peacetime timetable was restored from 21&nbsp;September 1870.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=22\u201327}}\n\n=== Construction of the Haltern\u2013Venlo railway and expansion of the railway facilities ===\n \nThe first proposals for the construction of a Paris-Hamburg Railway were put forward by the French company, ''Etudes et Travaux de Chemins de Fer'', which was backed by the [[Rothschild banking family of France|French Rothschild Bank]]. In 1862, the company received permission to carry out preparatory work in Prussia. The [[Kingdom of Prussia]], however, did not want a foreign railway company to operate the railway and transferred the project to the CME. The condition for the granting of an overall license was the construction of a fixed crossing of the Rhine near Wesel, since the fortress would be able to prevent its use in the event of war. The increasing tensions between Prussia and the [[Second French Empire|French Empire]], culminating in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870, led to the withdrawal of the Rothschild banking house from the project.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=33\u201334}} For the CME, the eastern section of the railway, which would connect [[Hamburg]] with the [[Ruhr]], was of greater importance. The company therefore always tried to delay the construction of the Haltern\u2013Venlo line, which was not expected to be profitable, or to alter it to pass over a Rhine bridge near Ruhrort, which was rejected.{{sfn|Frericks|2005|pp=136\u2013138}} Only when the ''Noord-Brabantsch-Duitsche Spoorweg-Maatschappij'' (North Brabantsch-German Railway Company; NBDS) agreed to run its trains to Wesel, was the CME ready to carry out its construction.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=36\u201342}} The bridge was eventually built downstream from the town.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=42\u201346}}\n \nWesel station was adapted for the integration of the Haltern\u2013Venlo line and the sidings were lengthened. At the same time, it was decided to ensure that the radius of the two curves, which the Haltern\u2013Venlo railway would follow in front of and behind Wesel station, would not to be too tight. Otherwise, two more bridges over the Lippe would have had to be built for a wider southern curve. A two-level interchange station was also categorically rejected by the fortress command because of its elevated location. This resulted in two tight curves with a radius of 200&nbsp;Prussian rods (\u2248&nbsp;753&nbsp;metres) towards Haltern and 120&nbsp;rods (\u2248&nbsp;452&nbsp;m) towards Venlo. The line ended in platform track&nbsp;3, which was equipped with an island platform. The reconstruction dragged on until 1875. After the work was completed, the number of tracks had risen to 24. The track length increased by 7550&nbsp;metres and 35 single sets of points, two three-way sets of points and four double crossing sets of points were installed. The CME had two sets of sidings facing the north and the south for shunting movements.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=57\u201360}} The Haltern\u2013Wesel section was opened on 1&nbsp;March 1874 and the Wesel\u2013Venlo section was put into operation on New Year's Eve 1874.{{sfn|Frericks|2005|pp=141\u2013143}}\n \nThe CME had contractually guaranteed the NBDS, which shared the section over the Rhine bridge with the CME, the construction of a platform, a bypass track and a siding to the north of the existing entrance building. As the CME had also received the concession for the [[Bocholt\u2013Wesel railway]], it built another platform track. The two platform tracks and the bypass track built in between ended at a turntable near the entrance building. The sidings were further north. The track length was increased by a further 550&nbsp;metres and two sets of points were also installed. In preparation for the construction of the tracks, the CME had previously moved all storage areas and two military ramps to the east side, where a goods shed was later built. The siding from the port railway remained on the west side as the only freight track. The (Wesel&nbsp;\u2013) Gest ([[B\u00fcderich station|B\u00fcderich]])&nbsp;\u2013 [[Goch station|Goch]] line of the NBDS and the Wesel\u2013Bocholt line were opened on 1&nbsp;July 1878. After the commissioning the [[Winterswijk\u2013Bocholt railway]] by the ''Nederlandsch-Westfaalsche Spoorweg-Maatschappij'' (Dutch-Westphalian Railway Company) in 1880, Wesel had direct connections from the Netherlands in four directions.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=57\u201360}}\n<!--[[File:Bahnhof Wesel 1900 02.jpg|thumb|Wesel station building, about 1900]]-->\n \nIt quickly became apparent that the station was not able to cope with the increased traffic despite the expansion. It turned out to be a problem that trains of the Venlo Railway in each direction could not be processed at the same time, and that the two main tracks to/from  Oberhausen had to be blocked so that passengers could cross the tracks to the platforms. The curve towards Haltern was only useable at low speed. The entrance building no longer coped with traffic after the extra lines were commissioned. Immediately after the nationalisation of the CME in 1880, the newly founded ''K\u00f6nigliche Eisenbahn-Direktion'' (Royal [[Railway divisions in Germany|Railway Directorate]], KED) of Cologne of the [[Prussian state railways]] (''Preu\u00dfische Staatseisenbahnen''), which was responsible for railway facilities on the east (right) bank of the Rhine, started to renovate them. In order to separate the traffic of the two main lines, it moved the Venlo Railway facilities to the west side of the entrance building, which used up the last remaining space between the station and the fortifications. The Haltern curve was slightly reduced by widening of the platform. However, the Venlo Railway and the Oberhausen line intersected with different curve radii, each lying in the inner curve, which meant that the points could only be used at reduced speed. The entrance building was replaced by a larger building in the same place and as a result of the renovation it was now on an island between tracks and was accessible via a level crossing.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=99\u2013105}} The other high-rise structures such as the [[water tower]], storerooms and workshops were also renovated during the renovation in the early 1880s. The first signal boxes were put into operation from 1881.{{sfn|Kocks|2005|pp=335\u2013341}} The section between [[Oberhausen-Sterkrade station|Sterkrade]] and Wesel was duplicated by 1886.<ref name=\"Archiv 2270\">{{cite web| url = http://nrwbahnarchiv.bplaced.net/strecken/2270.htm| title = Line 2270: Oberhausen \u2013 Emmerich (Grenze)| first = Andr\u00e9 |last=Joost| work = NRWbahnarchiv| accessdate= 17 April 2020|language=de}}</ref> The Venlo Railway between Wesel and B\u00fcderich was duplicated by 1899.{{sfn|Swoboda|2010|pp=78\u201379}} The State railways replaced the old engine shed by a permanent eight-track [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] from 1895 to 1898.<ref name=\"Statistik\" >{{cite journal| title= Statistische Nachweisungen \u00fcber die in den Jahren 1897\u20131900 vollendeten Hochbauten der preu\u00dfischen Staats-Eisenbahnverwaltung| journal= Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Bauwesen| volume= Supplement| date= 1905| url= https://digital.zlb.de/viewer/content/?action=pdf&metsFile=15239363_1905_08.xml&targetFileName=15239363_1905_08.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919161518/https://digital.zlb.de/viewer/content/?action=pdf&metsFile=15239363_1905_08.xml&targetFileName=15239363_1905_08.pdf |archivedate=19 September 2017 | accessdate = 18 April 2020 |language=de}}</ref>\n \nBy the turn of the century, the station building had an overall roof. The additional platform tracks on the Oberhausen and Venlo lines were equipped with platform canopies around 1904. A separate station section had to be built south of the level crossing for the [[Oberhausen\u2013Wesel railway|Oberhausen\u2013Walsum\u2013Wesel line]] (''Walsumbahn'') which opened on 15 October 1912, since there was no space in the station itself to accommodate additional passenger trains. The part of the station called ''Hamborner Bahnhof'' (referring to [[Hamborn]] on the Oberhausen\u2013Walsum\u2013Wesel line) had a platform track with a platform and a bypass track. It also had a small entrance building. Direct operations were also possible for freight trains using a set of points.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=99\u2013105}}{{sfn|Wuwer|2013|pp=75\u201377}}\n\n=== Second World War and loss of significance===\n \nA direct connecting curve was opened from Haltern towards Oberhausen bypassing Wesel station in about 1943.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=187\u2013194}} In the [[Bombing of Wesel in World War II|Allied bombing of Wesel]] during the final phase of the Second World War the station was hardly affected in contrast to the town.

It was reopened in November 1945.{{sfn|Kocks|2005|pp=344\u2013345}}\n \nTemporary bridges were used on the line to Oberhausen until 1946 and the trains to the north terminated in Emmerich until 1949, when the section to the border near [[Elten]] was restored to operation. The first civilian passenger trains started running towards Haltern in May or June 1945.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=209\u2013212}} American [[Pioneer (military)|pioneers]] built a makeshift bridge between [[B\u00fcderich station|B\u00fcderich]] and Wesel to transport supplies in spring 1945. The rail bridge was south of the old Rhine bridge and crossed the Rhine near the site of the Rheinbaben bridge (1917\u20131945). It met the Venlo Railway near Fort Fusternberg.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=194\u2013199}} The bridge  and the curve built during the war were dismantled in the autumn of 1946.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=209\u2013212}} Nevertheless, the connections over the old Rhine bridge to B\u00fcderich and towards [[Walsum station|Walsum]] were not restored after the end of the war.{{sfn|Wuwer|2013|pp=15\u201321}}\n \n[[File:Bahnhof Wesel 10 \u00dcberblick.JPG|thumb|Wesel station in 2015]]\n \nAbout 500 railway workers were employed at Wesel station in 1950. These were spread across the various departments of the station, including passenger and freight operations, infrastructure maintenance and rolling stock maintenance. At that time, the station was still classified as class&nbsp;I.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=2016\u2013217}} Already in 1948 the former ''Reichsbahndirektion'' ([[Railway divisions in Germany|railway directorate]]) of Essen had the second track on the Venlo Railway towards Haltern converted into a siding to Obrighoven. Five years later, sidings to businesses were connected directly to the main track and the connecting siding was dismantled. At the same time, the line was downgraded to a branch line.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|p=238}} [[Deutsche Bundesbahn]] abandoned passenger services to Haltern on 30&nbsp;September 1962 and freight traffic was abandoned on 26&nbsp;May 1974. The track was retained as a siding to serve the Obrighoven substation.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=239\u2013241}} To speed up the traffic on the line to the Netherlands, Deutsche Bundesbahn had the through main tracks on this line relocated in the early 1960s. They now ran through the middle of the old island platform, so that after the reconstruction, there were two island platforms with four platform edges (tracks&nbsp;2\u20135). The platforms were connected to the entrance building via a pedestrian tunnel. The speed for through trains increased to 110&nbsp;km/h. The junction with the Venlo Railway was finally abolished in the absence of a bridge over the Rhine since 1945. The line towards Haltern was connected to the freight tracks on the east side, the number of which was reduced during the reconstruction. As a result of the reconstruction, the bay platform tracks and the turntable north of the island platform were also eliminated; the remaining trains to and from Bocholt subsequently reversed at platform&nbsp;5. The level crossing at the entrance to the station building surrounded by tracks was replaced in 1961 by an overpass further north. In 1966, the mechanical and electromechanical signal boxes were replaced by signal box&nbsp;\"Wf\", which contained a track plan push button control panel for a [[relay interlocking]].{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=254\u2013258}}\n \nThe ''Bundesbahndirektion'' (Deutsche Bundesbahn Railway Directorate, BD) of Essen dissolved the Wesel operations office on 1&nbsp;April 1954 and its tasks were taken over by the Oberhausen&nbsp;2 operations office. The rolling stock depot closed with the electrification of the line to the Netherlands on 22&nbsp;May 1966. In its last years, it had only served local passenger and freight traffic, while international trains were covered from Oberhausen or Emmerich. The infrastructure maintenance office (''Bahnmeisterei'', \"Bm\") took over the tasks of the similar offices in [[Bocholt station|Bocholt]], [[Emmerich station|Emmerich]] and [[Dinslaken station|Dinslaken]] in the 1960s and 1970s and was absorbed by ''Bm&nbsp;Oberhausen'' in the 1980s. The Wesel freight handling office (''G\u00fcterabfertigung'', Ga), took over the tasks of the freight offices at [[Friedrichsfeld (Niederrhein) station|Friedrichsfeld]], [[Hamminkeln station|Hamminkeln]], Empel-Rees and Bocholt between 1961 and 1979, after BD Essen dissolved them as independent offices. In 1990, BD&nbsp;Essen combined the station and goods handling into one office.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=216\u2013217}} In the same year, Deutsche Bundesbahn abandoned the carriage of express parcels, which since the dismantling of the railway tracks to the west had to be handled on the passenger platforms. One year after the German railway reform (''Bahnreform''), goods handling closed on 31&nbsp;December 1994. Deutsche Bundesbahn subsequently dismantled the sidings east of platform&nbsp;9; this site has since been redeveloped.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=254\u2013258}}\n\n=== Wesel station since the German rail reform ===\n \nAfter the railway reform, the railway closed various facilities in the entrance building, which was exposed to vandalism. By the early 21st century the situation had so escalated that Deutsche Bahn launched its ''Sauberkeitskampagne&nbsp;NRW'' (NRW cleanliness campaign) in Wesel and the outsides of the building were cleaned up at a cost of [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] 20,000. One year after this campaign, the lessee of the restaurant and the hotel surrendered his lease. After negotiations between the city of Wesel and Deutsche Bahn, further construction work was carried out in 2007. The pedestrian tunnel was extended to the east and a commuter parking area was established. The existing commuter parking lot on the west side was enlarged. At the same time, the town received barrier-free access to the platforms with the installation of ramps and lifts. In the middle of the construction work, Deutsche Bahn issued its preliminary plans for the expansion of the Oberhausen\u2013Emmerich line as part of the [[Trans-European Networks]] Rotterdam\u2013[[Genoa]] corridor. Initially, the construction of a third track between Wesel and Oberhausen on the east side was planned, but a short time later it became known that this would go all the way to [[Zevenaar railway station|Zevenaar]] in the Netherlands. The construction of a fourth track between Wesel and Oberhausen was also considered. This was to go into operation on the west side and thus occupy the space of a previously built pedestrian ramp.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=254\u2013258}} After another change of plan, the construction of the fourth track was reduced to the Oberhausen\u2013Dinslaken section, but the track layout was changed so that the construction of a through track between the platforms and the entrance building was still planned. The construction of a new pedestrian ramp is therefore still necessary.

It was therefore very different from the other stations on the route. The building included a [[Vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]], a [[waiting room]] for 1st and 2nd class passengers and another for 3rd and 4th class passengers. In the middle there was a ticket office and a baggage check-in counter, with service rooms behind.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=22\u201327}} The telegraph office was expanded for the construction of Haltern\u2013Venlo railway. A station restaurant was established in the waiting rooms, probably at the beginning of the 1870s.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=57\u201360}}\n \nThe second entrance building was built at the location of the first building, but as a two-storey building. As a result of the reconstruction of the station, it was now on an \"island\" surrounded by tracks.  Since the ''Rayonbestimmungen'' (\"radius regulations\", which limited the type of buildings that could be built outside fortresses to avoid them providing cover for attackers) continued to apply, this building was also made of timber. The inside and outside layers of the walls consisted of planks that were sealed with [[earthen plaster]]. The cavity between the two layers were not filled in, which would have slowed the building's possible demolition during a war. The building was connected to the sewage system from the start. The external appearance of the building was enhanced by extensive woodwork. In the following years, a surrounding platform canopy was attached to the building.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=99\u2013105}}{{sfn|Kocks|2005|pp=335\u2013341}} After the abolition of the remaining radius regulations after the First World War, a basement was built under part of the building.{{sfn|Kocks|2005|pp=341\u2013342}}\n \nThe \"Hamborn\" platform of the Oberhausen\u2013Walsum\u2013Wesel line (''Walsumbahn'') built to the south of the south end of the main station was given a separate entrance building with an attached porch. It was built on a brick foundation in timber construction and, like the main entrance building, had double-layered walls. Inside, the surfaces were nailed with tubular fabric to which [[plaster]] and [[lime mortar]] were applied. The lower wall surfaces in the waiting and service rooms, up to 1.5 metres above the floor, were given a coating of planed board instead of plaster. The unobstructed height of the service rooms and the 3rd/4th&nbsp;class waiting room was four metres and that of the 1st/2nd&nbsp;class waiting room and the lobby was 2.65&nbsp;metres. The wooden beams in the vestibule were given a horizontal ceiling made of planed boards. The interior was warmed by heaters. The roof was made of boards covered with [[bituminous waterproofing]]. As the wooden structures did not provide the minimum clearances as a result of the limits set by the regulations, a special permit was required. It was issued on the basis that the station would soon be upgraded; the entrance building was in use until the Second World War.{{sfn|Kocks|2005|pp=342\u2013343}}\n\nDespite the heavy [[Bombing of Wesel in World War II|Allied air raids on Wesel]], the main entrance building survived the Second World War almost unscathed. The building burned down on 25&nbsp;November 1945, shortly before the renovation of the station master's apartment was completed.{{sfn|Kocks|2005|pp=344\u2013345}} A temporary structure was quickly built on the station forecourt as a replacement. This contained a ticket office and a station restaurant. After the new entrance building was put into operation, the temporary building served as an apprentice workshop for Deutsche Bundesbahn and was demolished in 1963.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=254\u2013258}}\n \nThe plans for a new building were drawn up in 1953. The current entrance building was opened on 8&nbsp;July 1955. It was built to plans by Erich Eickemeyer. Its design is based on the entrance buildings of [[Borken (Westf) station|Borken&nbsp;(Westf)]] and [[Emmerich station|Emmerich]], but it was larger with an 80&nbsp;metre-wide front. The town initially wanted a tower-like roof structure that was not realised. However, the size of the structure was increased by building a small hotel with ten beds. On the ground floor, next to the ticket office, there was a bookshop, a 3rd class waiting room and a station restaurant with a dining room, which also functions as a 1st/2nd class waiting room. The 3rd class waiting room was turned into a pub in 1972 and the station bookshop was enlarged in 1982.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=254\u2013258}} In the basement of the restaurant there was also a [[nine-pin bowling]] alley. Part of the premises was disused by 2002.{{sfn|Schack|2004|p=140}}\n\n==Transport services==\n\nAll long-distance services currently pass Wesel without stopping.

The station is located on the [[Arnhem-Oberhausen railway]] and the [[Bocholt-Wesel railway]]. The train services are operated by [[Deutsche Bahn]] and [[Abellio Deutschland]].\n\n== History==\nAs early as 1832, the Dutch Lieutenant Brade proposed the construction of a railway on the west bank of the Rhine from [[Amsterdam]] to [[Cologne]]. After preparatory work in the [[Netherlands]] had been largely completed, Brade began the first surveys in [[Prussia]]. He sought support from the Mayor of Wesel, who initially opposed the project. The town was more interested in expanding traffic on the [[Rhine]] and the [[Lippe (river)|Lippe]]. The town's view only changed after the opening of the first railway lines in Germany.{{sfn|Kocks|2005|pp=321\u2013325}}\n \nA railway committee was founded in Wesel under the leadership of Ludwig Bischoff, the headmaster of the Wesel high school, on 2&nbsp;March 1841. During the preliminary considerations for the construction of the [[Cologne-Minden trunk line|Cologne\u2013Minden railway]], the committee proposed a line through Wesel, [[M\u00fcnster]] and [[Bielefeld]] to [[Minden]]. Bischoff referred in a memorandum to the advantages of this route, which could in the long term link the fortress city of Wesel with the [[Province of Westphalia|Westphalian]] provincial capital of M\u00fcnster and the Prussian capital of Berlin, and suggested that it would support the movement towards [[German Question|German national unity]]. In addition, the northern route was the shortest connection from Berlin to the Rhine and was favourable for railway building. The head of the Cologne-Minden Railway Committee, [[David Hansemann]], rejected the initiative on the grounds that the line chosen should be the shortest route, especially since the connection between Berlin and the fortified city of Cologne was more important{{sfn|Kocks|2005|pp=321\u2013325}}{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=20\u201322}}\n \nAfter Hansemann's rejection, the Wesel Committee concentrated increasingly on a link between Cologne and Amsterdam, which would connect the [[Ruhr]] with the [[North Sea]]. The town of [[Emmerich am Rhein|Emmerich]], which was also seeking a connection at the time, received approval by cabinet order on 15&nbsp;September 1845 for preparatory work for the construction of a branch line from [[Oberhausen]] on the Cologne-Minden Railway via Wesel and Emmerich with a connection to the [[Amsterdam\u2013Arnhem railway]], which was opened between 1843 and 1845. The Wesel and Emmerich Committee merged into a joint committee based in Wesel on 22&nbsp;January 1846. After the [[German revolutions of 1848\u20131849#Prussia|March Revolution]] in 1848, Ludwig Bischoff had to resign from the school and leave the town of Wesel and the committee due to his liberal views.{{sfn|Kocks|2005|pp=321\u2013325}}{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=20\u201322}}\n \nIn 1850, the town again contacted the Prussian Ministry of Commerce to promote the construction of the line. The town emphasised its loyalty to the king and the [[House of Hohenzollern]] and referred to its importance as the most northwestern bulwark in Prussia. To compensate for the obstacles associated with the law governing its fortress status, the town sought financial support for the line\u2019s construction and equal treatment with other unprofitable lines. As an alternative to the state assuming all construction costs, Wesel proposed state participation in the capital raising for the construction and a declaration that it would guarantee interest at the rate of three and a half percent. The town continued to seek support from some senior military personnel; as early as 1843, the Prussian Ministry of War had endorsed a rail connection to Wesel. In November 1850, the Prussian Minister of Commerce [[August von der Heydt]] instructed Wesel to stop promoting the scheme and indicated that the current situation made it impossible to issue an interest guarantee. This reflected ongoing negotiations between Prussia and the Netherlands.{{sfn|Kocks|2005|pp=321\u2013325}}{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=20\u201322}}\n \nAfter the Netherlands agreed to change the line from Amsterdam to Arnhem from ({{Track gauge|1945 mm|allk=on}}) to ({{Track gauge|sg|allk=on}}), nothing stood in the way of the project. On 1&nbsp;October 1853, the [[Cologne-Minden Railway Company]] (''C\u00f6ln-Mindener Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft'', CME) received the concession for the Oberhausen\u2013Arnhem route. Planning in the Wesel area had begun on the basis of various preliminary contracts as early as 1852.{{sfn|Kocks|2005|pp=321\u2013325}}{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=20\u201322}}\n \n=== Construction and commissioning of the Oberhausen\u2013Arnhem railway ===\n \nThe construction of Wesel station was subjected to special conditions due to its proximity to the fortress. The Ministry of War initially wanted a station on the western side. This would have required the building of a 200&nbsp;[[Rod (unit)#In continental Europe|Prussian rod]] (\u2248&nbsp;753&nbsp;metre)-long embankment to protect against flooding and ice on the Lippe. In addition, the ''Rheintor'' (Rhine Gate), which formed the entrance to the pontoon bridge over the Rhine, would no longer have been usable by horse-riders and wagons. In this case, the railway would have built a opening bridge for the railway. In addition, the station could have been fired on from the other bank of the Rhine. A station on the eastern side, on the other hand, satisfied the town and the CME and was ultimately built due to the problems with the western option.{{sfn|Kocks|2005|pp=325\u2013327}} The CME intended to build the railway embankment to be flood-proof at 35&nbsp;[[Foot (unit)#Other obsolete feet|Prussian feet]] (\u2248&nbsp;11.0&nbsp;metres) above the level of Wesel. The military administration required a reduction in the overall height to 30&nbsp;feet (\u2248&nbsp;9.4&nbsp;m), and later to 28.5&nbsp;feet (\u2248&nbsp;8.9&nbsp;m).{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=22\u201327}}\n \nThe Ministry of War permitted the station to be built within the fortress area so that it would not be too far away from the town. Since buildings this close to the walls could have offered protection for attackers, the station buildings had to be single-storey and made of wood. In addition, they had to be able to be dismantled within a day. The construction also resulted in demands from the military to expand the fortifications substantially. To protect the existing fortress, the Ministry of War called for the construction of Fort Fusternberg on the land between the station and the Lippe (at a cost of 185,000&nbsp;[[Vereinsthaler|thalers]]). The ministry also required the construction of a tower fort with extended walls on the town side of Fort Fusternberg (135,000&nbsp;thalers) that would defend the Lippe crossing if Fort Fusternberg fell. [[Lunette (fortification)|Lunette]]&nbsp;23 would have to be raised because of the railway embankment (1500&nbsp;thalers). In addition, the construction of a horse-hauled railway including protective works from the station to the port was required in order to bring operating materials to safety in the fortress in the event of war (28,500&nbsp;thalers). The CME rejected the additional costs of 350,000&nbsp;thalers and declared itself ready to build a bulwark on the strong point of Flamer Schanze on the other side of the Lippe. The CME was ready to build the military railway, but was against the construction of the defensive structures. The company pointed out that the railway embankment would be demolished without compensation in the event of war and therefore could not bear the additional costs. In addition, the advantages of railway construction would be greater than the disadvantages for the fortress system. Since the Prussian Minister of War, [[Friedrich Graf von Waldersee]], was not ready to agree, but the commitments made to the Netherlands in relation to the construction of the railway could not be postponed, the matter was referred to the Prussian King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV]]. On 10&nbsp;April 1856 the CME agreed to pay half of the cost of 174,250&nbsp;thalers, while the other half was to be paid from the railway fund. The king approved the project on 14&nbsp;April 1856.{{sfn|Kocks|2005|pp=325\u2013327}}{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=22\u201327}}\n \nThe whole line became useable with the commissioning of the [[Dinslaken station|Dinslaken]]\u2013Wesel\u2013Emmerich section on 20&nbsp;October 1856.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=20\u201322}} The CME had held opening ceremonies over several days from 17&nbsp;October 1856, including, among other things, a special trip from [[Deutz, Cologne|Deutz]] to Amsterdam and back. While the outward journey between [[Ruhrort]] and Emmerich used water transport on the Rhine with a stop in Wesel, a train was taken for the return journey. No fixed program was originally planned in Wesel. Because the steam locomotive had to replenish its water supplies in Wesel, the people of Wesel decided to take advantage of this ten-minute break; the festival committee was informed of the project and made no objection. The mayor asked all the town councilors to gather on the platform in festive clothes when the train arrived at 12:30 p.m. and a music corps would also line up. In addition, the project was promoted in the town, so that the citizens would be present in large numbers. The project was implemented as planned.{{sfn|Kocks|2005|pp=325\u2013327}}\n \nIn the beginning, the station had a separate office building for the stationmaster in addition to the entrance building. An open loading ramp and loading road bordered the large goods shed. A two-track engine shed was available for the locomotives of the trains terminating in Wesel. Next to it was the water station; two [[water cranes]] were installed over a 1120&nbsp;cubic Prussian feet (\u2248&nbsp;34.6&nbsp;cubic metre) storage container. An average of 19&nbsp;officials and workers were employed at the station in 1858. The station precincts contained track with a lenght of 650&nbsp;rods (\u2248&nbsp;2.27&nbsp;km) and 16&nbsp;sets of points. There were already 22&nbsp;sets of points and 715&nbsp;rods (\u2248&nbsp;2,69&nbsp;km) of track in 1862. 25&nbsp;sets of points were installed in 1868 and 26&nbsp;sets of points in 1870. The number of employees temporarily dropped to 13, after the completion of the remaining work, then rose continuously to 28 in 1870. The CME established a tree nursery on some land that could not be sold in order to demarcate the railway area.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=22\u201327}}\n \nWesel station's freight traffic fell short of expectations in the early days, despite good traffic on the line. 101,375 outgoing passengers were counted at the station in 1858, which was similar to traffic at [[Essen-Altenessen station|Essen]] and [[Hamm (Westf) station|Hamm]]. Military tickets accounted for almost ten percent of passengers. The volume of freight traffic was significantly lower, with around 50 incoming and outgoing freight wagons per day. Due to the fortress ring, the establishment of factories within the town was technically impossible. Buildings outside the city walls were prohibited. The situation only changed gradually after the town was demilitarised in the early 1890s. Another disadvantage, which resulted from the fortress, was the route between town and the station. The entrance from Berliner Tor was angled and covered with [[gravel]] and coarse [[sand]]. Despite regular cleaning, the street was covered with horse manure and furrowed by [[wagon]] wheels. There was no paved sidewalk or railings to fence off the [[moat]]s. Since the street was not illuminated until the beginning of the 1860s, serious injuries and fatalities occurred after falls, especially at night or in thick fog. The military railway to the port went into operation on 3&nbsp;July 1865. The CME had delayed its construction because it feared that it would lose goods traffic to the shipping industry.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=22\u201327}}{{sfn|Kocks|2005|pp=328\u2013331}}\n \nThe first major renovation took place in 1870. The freight shed was expanded from 1059&nbsp;square feet (\u2248&nbsp;104.3&nbsp;square metres) to 5666&nbsp;square feet (\u2248&nbsp;558.1&nbsp;square metres) and the loading ramps for military traffic were extended. With the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] on 24&nbsp;July 1870, freight traffic was discontinued and passenger traffic was reduced from 18 trains to one pair per day. The [[mobilisation]] lasted until 14&nbsp;August 1870 and the peacetime timetable was restored from 21&nbsp;September 1870.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=22\u201327}}\n\n=== Construction of the Haltern\u2013Venlo railway and expansion of the railway facilities ===\n \nThe first proposals for the construction of a Paris-Hamburg Railway were put forward by the French company, ''Etudes et Travaux de Chemins de Fer'', which was backed by the [[Rothschild banking family of France|French Rothschild Bank]]. In 1862, the company received permission to carry out preparatory work in Prussia. The [[Kingdom of Prussia]], however, did not want a foreign railway company to operate the railway and transferred the project to the CME. The condition for the granting of an overall license was the construction of a fixed crossing of the Rhine near Wesel, since the fortress would be able to prevent its use in the event of war. The increasing tensions between Prussia and the [[Second French Empire|French Empire]], culminating in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870, led to the withdrawal of the Rothschild banking house from the project.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=33\u201334}} For the CME, the eastern section of the railway, which would connect [[Hamburg]] with the [[Ruhr]], was of greater importance. The company therefore always tried to delay the construction of the Haltern\u2013Venlo line, which was not expected to be profitable, or to alter it to pass over a Rhine bridge near Ruhrort, which was rejected.{{sfn|Frericks|2005|pp=136\u2013138}} Only when the ''Noord-Brabantsch-Duitsche Spoorweg-Maatschappij'' (North Brabantsch-German Railway Company; NBDS) agreed to run its trains to Wesel, was the CME ready to carry out its construction.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=36\u201342}} The bridge was eventually built downstream from the town.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=42\u201346}}\n \nWesel station was adapted for the integration of the Haltern\u2013Venlo line and the sidings were lengthened. At the same time, it was decided to ensure that the radius of the two curves, which the Haltern\u2013Venlo railway would follow in front of and behind Wesel station, would not to be too tight. Otherwise, two more bridges over the Lippe would have had to be built for a wider southern curve. A two-level interchange station was also categorically rejected by the fortress command because of its elevated location. This resulted in two tight curves with a radius of 200&nbsp;Prussian rods (\u2248&nbsp;753&nbsp;metres) towards Haltern and 120&nbsp;rods (\u2248&nbsp;452&nbsp;m) towards Venlo. The line ended in platform track&nbsp;3, which was equipped with an island platform. The reconstruction dragged on until 1875. After the work was completed, the number of tracks had risen to 24. The track length increased by 7550&nbsp;metres and 35 single sets of points, two three-way sets of points and four double crossing sets of points were installed. The CME had two sets of sidings facing the north and the south for shunting movements.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=57\u201360}} The Haltern\u2013Wesel section was opened on 1&nbsp;March 1874 and the Wesel\u2013Venlo section was put into operation on New Year's Eve 1874.{{sfn|Frericks|2005|pp=141\u2013143}}\n \nThe CME had contractually guaranteed the NBDS, which shared the section over the Rhine bridge with the CME, the construction of a platform, a bypass track and a siding to the north of the existing entrance building. As the CME had also received the concession for the [[Bocholt\u2013Wesel railway]], it built another platform track. The two platform tracks and the bypass track built in between ended at a turntable near the entrance building. The sidings were further north. The track length was increased by a further 550&nbsp;metres and two sets of points were also installed. In preparation for the construction of the tracks, the CME had previously moved all storage areas and two military ramps to the east side, where a goods shed was later built. The siding from the port railway remained on the west side as the only freight track. The (Wesel&nbsp;\u2013) Gest ([[B\u00fcderich station|B\u00fcderich]])&nbsp;\u2013 [[Goch station|Goch]] line of the NBDS and the Wesel\u2013Bocholt line were opened on 1&nbsp;July 1878. After the commissioning the [[Winterswijk\u2013Bocholt railway]] by the ''Nederlandsch-Westfaalsche Spoorweg-Maatschappij'' (Dutch-Westphalian Railway Company) in 1880, Wesel had direct connections from the Netherlands in four directions.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=57\u201360}}\n<!--[[File:Bahnhof Wesel 1900 02.jpg|thumb|Wesel station building, about 1900]]-->\n \nIt quickly became apparent that the station was not able to cope with the increased traffic despite the expansion. It turned out to be a problem that trains of the Venlo Railway in each direction could not be processed at the same time, and that the two main tracks to/from  Oberhausen had to be blocked so that passengers could cross the tracks to the platforms. The curve towards Haltern was only useable at low speed. The entrance building no longer coped with traffic after the extra lines were commissioned. Immediately after the nationalisation of the CME in 1880, the newly founded ''K\u00f6nigliche Eisenbahn-Direktion'' (Royal [[Railway divisions in Germany|Railway Directorate]], KED) of Cologne of the [[Prussian state railways]] (''Preu\u00dfische Staatseisenbahnen''), which was responsible for railway facilities on the east (right) bank of the Rhine, started to renovate them. In order to separate the traffic of the two main lines, it moved the Venlo Railway facilities to the west side of the entrance building, which used up the last remaining space between the station and the fortifications. The Haltern curve was slightly reduced by widening of the platform. However, the Venlo Railway and the Oberhausen line intersected with different curve radii, each lying in the inner curve, which meant that the points could only be used at reduced speed. The entrance building was replaced by a larger building in the same place and as a result of the renovation it was now on an island between tracks and was accessible via a level crossing.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=99\u2013105}} The other high-rise structures such as the [[water tower]], storerooms and workshops were also renovated during the renovation in the early 1880s. The first signal boxes were put into operation from 1881.{{sfn|Kocks|2005|pp=335\u2013341}} The section between [[Oberhausen-Sterkrade station|Sterkrade]] and Wesel was duplicated by 1886.<ref name=\"Archiv 2270\">{{cite web| url = http://nrwbahnarchiv.bplaced.net/strecken/2270.htm| title = Line 2270: Oberhausen \u2013 Emmerich (Grenze)| first = Andr\u00e9 |last=Joost| work = NRWbahnarchiv| accessdate= 17 April 2020|language=de}}</ref> The Venlo Railway between Wesel and B\u00fcderich was duplicated by 1899.{{sfn|Swoboda|2010|pp=78\u201379}} The State railways replaced the old engine shed by a permanent eight-track [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] from 1895 to 1898.<ref name=\"Statistik\" >{{cite journal| title= Statistische Nachweisungen \u00fcber die in den Jahren 1897\u20131900 vollendeten Hochbauten der preu\u00dfischen Staats-Eisenbahnverwaltung| journal= Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Bauwesen| volume= Supplement| date= 1905| url= https://digital.zlb.de/viewer/content/?action=pdf&metsFile=15239363_1905_08.xml&targetFileName=15239363_1905_08.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919161518/https://digital.zlb.de/viewer/content/?action=pdf&metsFile=15239363_1905_08.xml&targetFileName=15239363_1905_08.pdf |archivedate=19 September 2017 | accessdate = 18 April 2020 |language=de}}</ref>\n \nBy the turn of the century, the station building had an overall roof. The additional platform tracks on the Oberhausen and Venlo lines were equipped with platform canopies around 1904. A separate station section had to be built south of the level crossing for the [[Oberhausen\u2013Wesel railway|Oberhausen\u2013Walsum\u2013Wesel line]] (''Walsumbahn'') which opened on 15 October 1912, since there was no space in the station itself to accommodate additional passenger trains. The part of the station called ''Hamborner Bahnhof'' (referring to [[Hamborn]] on the Oberhausen\u2013Walsum\u2013Wesel line) had a platform track with a platform and a bypass track. It also had a small entrance building. Direct operations were also possible for freight trains using a set of points.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=99\u2013105}}{{sfn|Wuwer|2013|pp=75\u201377}}\n\n=== Second World War and loss of significance===\n \nA direct connecting curve was opened from Haltern towards Oberhausen bypassing Wesel station in about 1943.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=187\u2013194}} In the [[Bombing of Wesel in World War II|Allied bombing of Wesel]] during the final phase of the Second World War the station was hardly affected in contrast to the town. On the morning of 10&nbsp;March 1945, [[Wehrmacht]] forces blew up the Rhine bridge when retreating to the eastern side of the Rhine.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=194\u2013199}} The bridges over the [[Wesel\u2013Datteln Canal]] and the [[Lippe (river)|Lippe]] were also blown up in the same month.{{sfn|Wuwer|2013|pp=15\u201321}} The station building survived the war virtually unscathed, although it burned briefly. It was reopened in November 1945.{{sfn|Kocks|2005|pp=344\u2013345}}\n \nTemporary bridges were used on the line to Oberhausen until 1946 and the trains to the north terminated in Emmerich until 1949, when the section to the border near [[Elten]] was restored to operation. The first civilian passenger trains started running towards Haltern in May or June 1945.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=209\u2013212}} American [[Pioneer (military)|pioneers]] built a makeshift bridge between [[B\u00fcderich station|B\u00fcderich]] and Wesel to transport supplies in spring 1945. The rail bridge was south of the old Rhine bridge and crossed the Rhine near the site of the Rheinbaben bridge (1917\u20131945). It met the Venlo Railway near Fort Fusternberg.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=194\u2013199}} The bridge  and the curve built during the war were dismantled in the autumn of 1946.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=209\u2013212}} Nevertheless, the connections over the old Rhine bridge to B\u00fcderich and towards [[Walsum station|Walsum]] were not restored after the end of the war.{{sfn|Wuwer|2013|pp=15\u201321}}\n \n[[File:Bahnhof Wesel 10 \u00dcberblick.JPG|thumb|Wesel station in 2015]]\n \nAbout 500 railway workers were employed at Wesel station in 1950. These were spread across the various departments of the station, including passenger and freight operations, infrastructure maintenance and rolling stock maintenance. At that time, the station was still classified as class&nbsp;I.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=2016\u2013217}} Already in 1948 the former ''Reichsbahndirektion'' ([[Railway divisions in Germany|railway directorate]]) of Essen had the second track on the Venlo Railway towards Haltern converted into a siding to Obrighoven. Five years later, sidings to businesses were connected directly to the main track and the connecting siding was dismantled. At the same time, the line was downgraded to a branch line.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|p=238}} [[Deutsche Bundesbahn]] abandoned passenger services to Haltern on 30&nbsp;September 1962 and freight traffic was abandoned on 26&nbsp;May 1974. The track was retained as a siding to serve the Obrighoven substation.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=239\u2013241}} To speed up the traffic on the line to the Netherlands, Deutsche Bundesbahn had the through main tracks on this line relocated in the early 1960s. They now ran through the middle of the old island platform, so that after the reconstruction, there were two island platforms with four platform edges (tracks&nbsp;2\u20135). The platforms were connected to the entrance building via a pedestrian tunnel. The speed for through trains increased to 110&nbsp;km/h. The junction with the Venlo Railway was finally abolished in the absence of a bridge over the Rhine since 1945. The line towards Haltern was connected to the freight tracks on the east side, the number of which was reduced during the reconstruction. As a result of the reconstruction, the bay platform tracks and the turntable north of the island platform were also eliminated; the remaining trains to and from Bocholt subsequently reversed at platform&nbsp;5. The level crossing at the entrance to the station building surrounded by tracks was replaced in 1961 by an overpass further north. In 1966, the mechanical and electromechanical signal boxes were replaced by signal box&nbsp;\"Wf\", which contained a track plan push button control panel for a [[relay interlocking]].{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=254\u2013258}}\n \nThe ''Bundesbahndirektion'' (Deutsche Bundesbahn Railway Directorate, BD) of Essen dissolved the Wesel operations office on 1&nbsp;April 1954 and its tasks were taken over by the Oberhausen&nbsp;2 operations office. The rolling stock depot closed with the electrification of the line to the Netherlands on 22&nbsp;May 1966. In its last years, it had only served local passenger and freight traffic, while international trains were covered from Oberhausen or Emmerich. The infrastructure maintenance office (''Bahnmeisterei'', \"Bm\") took over the tasks of the similar offices in [[Bocholt station|Bocholt]], [[Emmerich station|Emmerich]] and [[Dinslaken station|Dinslaken]] in the 1960s and 1970s and was absorbed by ''Bm&nbsp;Oberhausen'' in the 1980s. The Wesel freight handling office (''G\u00fcterabfertigung'', Ga), took over the tasks of the freight offices at [[Friedrichsfeld (Niederrhein) station|Friedrichsfeld]], [[Hamminkeln station|Hamminkeln]], Empel-Rees and Bocholt between 1961 and 1979, after BD Essen dissolved them as independent offices. In 1990, BD&nbsp;Essen combined the station and goods handling into one office.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=216\u2013217}} In the same year, Deutsche Bundesbahn abandoned the carriage of express parcels, which since the dismantling of the railway tracks to the west had to be handled on the passenger platforms. One year after the German railway reform (''Bahnreform''), goods handling closed on 31&nbsp;December 1994. Deutsche Bundesbahn subsequently dismantled the sidings east of platform&nbsp;9; this site has since been redeveloped.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=254\u2013258}}\n\n=== Wesel station since the German rail reform ===\n \nAfter the railway reform, the railway closed various facilities in the entrance building, which was exposed to vandalism. By the early 21st century the situation had so escalated that Deutsche Bahn launched its ''Sauberkeitskampagne&nbsp;NRW'' (NRW cleanliness campaign) in Wesel and the outsides of the building were cleaned up at a cost of [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] 20,000. One year after this campaign, the lessee of the restaurant and the hotel surrendered his lease. After negotiations between the city of Wesel and Deutsche Bahn, further construction work was carried out in 2007. The pedestrian tunnel was extended to the east and a commuter parking area was established. The existing commuter parking lot on the west side was enlarged. At the same time, the town received barrier-free access to the platforms with the installation of ramps and lifts. In the middle of the construction work, Deutsche Bahn issued its preliminary plans for the expansion of the Oberhausen\u2013Emmerich line as part of the [[Trans-European Networks]] Rotterdam\u2013[[Genoa]] corridor. Initially, the construction of a third track between Wesel and Oberhausen on the east side was planned, but a short time later it became known that this would go all the way to [[Zevenaar railway station|Zevenaar]] in the Netherlands. The construction of a fourth track between Wesel and Oberhausen was also considered. This was to go into operation on the west side and thus occupy the space of a previously built pedestrian ramp.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=254\u2013258}} After another change of plan, the construction of the fourth track was reduced to the Oberhausen\u2013Dinslaken section, but the track layout was changed so that the construction of a through track between the platforms and the entrance building was still planned. The construction of a new pedestrian ramp is therefore still necessary. The construction of [[noise barrier]]s is also planned.<ref name=\"PFA 2.2\">{{cite web| url = https://www.emmerich-oberhausen.de/files/pdf/grafiken/PPT_Lage_drittes_Gleis_PFA2.2.pdf| title = Ausbaustrecke Emmerich\u2013Oberhausen.

It was therefore very different from the other stations on the route. The building included a [[Vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]], a [[waiting room]] for 1st and 2nd class passengers and another for 3rd and 4th class passengers. In the middle there was a ticket office and a baggage check-in counter, with service rooms behind.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=22\u201327}} The telegraph office was expanded for the construction of Haltern\u2013Venlo railway. A station restaurant was established in the waiting rooms, probably at the beginning of the 1870s.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=57\u201360}}\n \nThe second entrance building was built at the location of the first building, but as a two-storey building. As a result of the reconstruction of the station, it was now on an \"island\" surrounded by tracks.  Since the ''Rayonbestimmungen'' (\"radius regulations\", which limited the type of buildings that could be built outside fortresses to avoid them providing cover for attackers) continued to apply, this building was also made of timber. The inside and outside layers of the walls consisted of planks that were sealed with [[earthen plaster]]. The cavity between the two layers were not filled in, which would have slowed the building's possible demolition during a war. The building was connected to the sewage system from the start. The external appearance of the building was enhanced by extensive woodwork. In the following years, a surrounding platform canopy was attached to the building.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=99\u2013105}}{{sfn|Kocks|2005|pp=335\u2013341}} After the abolition of the remaining radius regulations after the First World War, a basement was built under part of the building.{{sfn|Kocks|2005|pp=341\u2013342}}\n \nThe \"Hamborn\" platform of the Oberhausen\u2013Walsum\u2013Wesel line (''Walsumbahn'') built to the south of the south end of the main station was given a separate entrance building with an attached porch. It was built on a brick foundation in timber construction and, like the main entrance building, had double-layered walls. Inside, the surfaces were nailed with tubular fabric to which [[plaster]] and [[lime mortar]] were applied. The lower wall surfaces in the waiting and service rooms, up to 1.5 metres above the floor, were given a coating of planed board instead of plaster. The unobstructed height of the service rooms and the 3rd/4th&nbsp;class waiting room was four metres and that of the 1st/2nd&nbsp;class waiting room and the lobby was 2.65&nbsp;metres. The wooden beams in the vestibule were given a horizontal ceiling made of planed boards. The interior was warmed by heaters. The roof was made of boards covered with [[bituminous waterproofing]]. As the wooden structures did not provide the minimum clearances as a result of the limits set by the regulations, a special permit was required. It was issued on the basis that the station would soon be upgraded; the entrance building was in use until the Second World War.{{sfn|Kocks|2005|pp=342\u2013343}}\n\nDespite the heavy [[Bombing of Wesel in World War II|Allied air raids on Wesel]], the main entrance building survived the Second World War almost unscathed. The building burned down on 25&nbsp;November 1945, shortly before the renovation of the station master's apartment was completed.{{sfn|Kocks|2005|pp=344\u2013345}} A temporary structure was quickly built on the station forecourt as a replacement. This contained a ticket office and a station restaurant. After the new entrance building was put into operation, the temporary building served as an apprentice workshop for Deutsche Bundesbahn and was demolished in 1963.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=254\u2013258}}\n \nThe plans for a new building were drawn up in 1953. The current entrance building was opened on 8&nbsp;July 1955. It was built to plans by Erich Eickemeyer. Its design is based on the entrance buildings of [[Borken (Westf) station|Borken&nbsp;(Westf)]] and [[Emmerich station|Emmerich]], but it was larger with an 80&nbsp;metre-wide front. The town initially wanted a tower-like roof structure that was not realised. However, the size of the structure was increased by building a small hotel with ten beds. On the ground floor, next to the ticket office, there was a bookshop, a 3rd class waiting room and a station restaurant with a dining room, which also functions as a 1st/2nd class waiting room. The 3rd class waiting room was turned into a pub in 1972 and the station bookshop was enlarged in 1982.{{sfn|Swoboda |2010|pp=254\u2013258}} In the basement of the restaurant there was also a [[nine-pin bowling]] alley.

The constitutional capital is [[Sucre]], while the [[seat of government]] and executive capital is [[La Paz]]. The largest city and principal industrial center is [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], located on the [[Geography of Bolivia|Llanos Orientales]] (tropical lowlands), a mostly flat region in the east of the country.\n\nThe [[sovereign state]] of Bolivia is a [[constitution of Bolivia|constitutionally]] [[unitary state]], divided into [[Departments of Bolivia|nine departments]]. Its geography varies from the peaks of the [[Andes]] in the West, to the Eastern Lowlands, situated within the [[Amazon Basin]]. It is bordered to the north and east by [[Brazil]], to the southeast by [[Paraguay]], to the south by [[Argentina]], to the southwest by [[Chile]], and to the northwest by [[Peru]]. One-third of the country is within the [[Andes|Andean]] mountain range. With {{convert|1,098,581|km2|abbr=on}} of area, Bolivia is the fifth largest country in [[South America]], after [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], [[Peru]] and [[Colombia]] (and alongside [[Paraguay]], one of the only two landlocked countries in the [[Americas]]), the [[List of countries by area|27th largest in the world]], the largest [[landlocked country]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] and the world's [[Landlocked country|seventh largest landlocked country]], after [[Kazakhstan]], [[Mongolia]], [[Chad]], [[Niger]], [[Mali]] and [[Ethiopia]].\n\nThe country's population, estimated at 11&nbsp;million, is [[multiethnic]], including [[Amerindians]], [[Mestizo]]s, [[Europeans]], [[Asian people|Asian]]s and [[Africans]]. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the official and predominant language, although 36 [[Languages of Bolivia|indigenous language]]s also have official status, of which the most commonly spoken are [[Guarani dialects|Guarani]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Quechuan languages|Quechua languages]].\n\nBefore Spanish colonization, the Andean region of Bolivia was part of the [[Inca Empire]], while the northern and eastern lowlands were inhabited by independent tribes. Spanish ''[[conquistadors]]'' arriving from [[Cuzco]] and [[Asunci\u00f3n]] took control of the region in the 16th century. During the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial period]] Bolivia was administered by the [[Royal Audiencia of Charcas]]. Spain built its empire in large part upon the silver that was extracted from [[Mining in Bolivia|Bolivia's mines]].\nAfter the first call for independence in 1809, 16 years of war followed before the establishment of the Republic, named for [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]. Over the course of the 19th and early 20th century Bolivia lost control of several peripheral territories to neighboring countries including the [[War of the Pacific|seizure]] of its coastline by Chile in 1879. Bolivia remained relatively politically stable until 1971, when [[Hugo Banzer]] led a [[History of Bolivia (1964\u201382)#The Banzer regime|coup d'\u00e9tat]] which replaced the socialist government of [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Torres]] with a [[military dictatorship]] headed by Banzer; Torres was murdered in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] by a right-wing death squad in 1976. Banzer's regime cracked down on [[left-wing politics|leftist and socialist]] opposition and other forms of dissent, resulting in the torture and deaths of a number of Bolivian citizens. Banzer was ousted in 1978 and later returned as the democratically elected president of Bolivia from 1997 to 2001.\n\nModern Bolivia is a charter member of the [[United Nations|UN]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[Non-Aligned Movement|NAM]], [[Organization of American States|OAS]], [[Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization|ACTO]], [[Bank of the South]], [[ALBA]] and [[Union of South American Nations|USAN]].

In order to expand its reach, Tiwanaku exercised great political astuteness, creating colonies, fostering trade agreements (which made the other cultures rather dependent), and instituting state cults.<ref name=\"McAndrews, Timothy L. 1997\">{{cite journal|last=McAndrews|first=Timothy L.|author2=Albarracin-Jordan, Juan |author3=Bermann, Marc |title=Regional Settlement Patterns in the Tiwanaku Valley of Bolivia|journal=Journal of Field Archaeology|year=1997|volume=24|issue=1|pages=67\u201383|doi=10.2307/530562|jstor=530562}}</ref>\n\nThe empire continued to grow with no end in sight.

Further, this elite's control of [[llama]] herds became a powerful control mechanism as llamas were essential for carrying goods between the civic centre and the periphery. These herds also came to symbolize class distinctions between the commoners and the elites.

As the surplus of food decreased, and thus the amount available to underpin their power, the control of the elites began to falter. The capital city became the last place viable for food production due to the resiliency of the raised field method of agriculture. Tiwanaku disappeared around AD 1000 because food production, the main source of the elites' power, dried up.

That revolution was followed by the [[La Paz revolution]] on 16 July 1809. The La Paz revolution marked a complete split with the Spanish government, while the Chuquisaca Revolution established a local independent junta in the name of the Spanish King deposed by Napoleon Bonaparte. Both revolutions were short-lived and defeated by the Spanish authorities in the Viceroyalty of the Rio de La Plata, but the following year the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] raged across the continent.\n\nBolivia was captured and recaptured many times during the war by the [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalists]] and patriots. Buenos Aires sent three military campaigns, all of which were defeated, and eventually limited itself to protecting the national borders at Salta. Bolivia was finally freed of Royalist dominion by Marshal [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]], with a military campaign coming from the North in support of the campaign of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]].

Peru and Bolivia formed the [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]], with de Santa Cruz as the ''Supreme Protector''. Following tension between the Confederation and Chile, Chile declared war on 28 December 1836. Argentina separately declared war on the Confederation on 9 May 1837. The Peruvian-Bolivian forces achieved several major victories during the [[War of the Confederation]]: the defeat of the Argentine expedition and the defeat of the first Chilean expedition on the fields of [[Paucarpata District|Paucarpata]] near the city of [[Arequipa]]. The Chilean army and its Peruvian rebel allies surrendered unconditionally and signed the [[Paucarpata Treaty]]. The treaty stipulated that Chile would withdraw from Peru-Bolivia, Chile would return captured Confederate ships, economic relations would be normalized, and the Confederation would pay Peruvian debt to Chile. However, the Chilean government and public rejected the peace treaty. Chile organized a second attack on the Confederation and defeated it in the [[Battle of Yungay]]. After this defeat, Santa Cruz resigned and went to exile in [[Ecuador]] and then Paris, and the Peruvian-Bolivian Confederation was dissolved.\n\nFollowing the renewed independence of Peru, Peruvian president General [[Agust\u00edn Gamarra]] invaded Bolivia. On 18 November 1841, the battle de Ingavi took place, in which the Bolivian Army defeated the Peruvian troops of Gamarra (killed in the battle). After the victory, Bolivia invaded Per\u00fa on several fronts.  The eviction of the Bolivian troops from the south of Peru would be achieved by the greater availability of material and human resources of Peru; the Bolivian Army did not have enough troops to maintain an occupation. In the district of Locumba \u2013 Tacna, a column of Peruvian soldiers and peasants defeated a Bolivian regiment in the so-called Battle of Los Altos de Chipe (Locumba). In the district of Sama and in Arica, the Peruvian colonel Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Lavay\u00e9n organized a troop that managed to defeat the Bolivian forces of Colonel Rodr\u00edguez Magari\u00f1os and threaten the port of Arica.

The relatively robust economic growth of the mid-1990s continued until about the third year of its term in office. After that, regional, global and domestic factors contributed to a decline in economic growth. Financial crises in Argentina and Brazil, lower world prices for export commodities, and reduced employment in the coca sector depressed the Bolivian economy. The public also perceived a significant amount of public sector corruption. These factors contributed to increasing social protests during the second half of Banzer's term.\n\nBetween January 1999 and April 2000, large-scale [[2000 Cochabamba protests|protests]] erupted in [[Cochabamba]], Bolivia's third largest city, in response to the [[Water privatization|privatisation of water]] resources by foreign companies and a subsequent doubling of water prices.

A July agreement between the MNR and the fourth-place MIR, which had again been led in the election by former President Jaime Paz Zamora, virtually ensured the election of S\u00e1nchez de Lozada in the congressional run-off, and on 6 August he was sworn in for the second time.

On 12 October 2003 the government imposed martial law in El Alto after 16 people were shot by the police and several dozen wounded in violent clashes. Faced with the option of resigning or more bloodshed, S\u00e1nchez de Lozada offered his resignation in a letter to an emergency session of Congress. After his resignation was accepted and his vice president, [[Carlos Mesa]], invested, he left on a commercially scheduled flight for the United States.\n\nThe country's internal situation became unfavorable for such political action on the international stage. After a resurgence of gas protests in 2005, Carlos Mesa attempted to resign in January 2005, but his offer was refused by Congress. On 22 March 2005, after weeks of new street protests from organizations accusing Mesa of bowing to U.S. corporate interests, Mesa again offered his resignation to Congress, which was accepted on 10 June.

The Beni River, along with the [[Madeira River]], forms the main tributary of the [[Amazon River]]. From east to west, the basin is formed by other important rivers, such as the [[Madre de Dios River]], the [[Orthon River]], the [[Abuna River]], the [[Yata River]], and the [[Guapor\u00e9 River]]. The most important lakes are [[Rogaguado Lake]], [[Rogagua Lake]], and [[Jara Lake]].\n*The second is the [[R\u00edo de la Plata Basin]], also called the South Basin ({{convert|229500|km\u00b2|sqmi|abbr=on}}/21% of the territory). The tributaries in this basin are in general less abundant than the ones forming the Amazon Basin. The Rio de la Plata Basin is mainly formed by the [[Paraguay River]], [[Pilcomayo River]], and [[Bermejo River]]. The most important lakes are [[Uberaba Lake]] and [[Mandior\u00e9 Lake]], both located in the Bolivian marshland.\n*The third basin is the '''Central Basin''', which is an [[endorheic basin]] ({{convert|145081|km\u00b2|sqmi}}/13% of the territory). The ''[[Altiplano]]'' has large numbers of lakes and rivers that do not run into any ocean because they are enclosed by the Andean mountains.

Presidents [[Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo]] (1982\u201385) and [[V\u00edctor Paz Estenssoro]] (1985\u201389) began a tradition of ceding power peacefully which has continued, although two presidents have stepped down in the face of popular protests: [[Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada]] in 2003 and [[Carlos Mesa]] in 2005.\n\nBolivia's multiparty democracy has seen a wide variety of parties in the presidency and parliament, although the [[Revolutionary Nationalist Movement]], [[Nationalist Democratic Action]], and the [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Bolivia)|Revolutionary Left Movement]] predominated from 1985 to 2005. On 11 November 2019, all senior governmental positions were vacated following a coup that forced [[Evo Morales' resignation|the resignation of Evo Morales and his government]].

The traditionally strong executive branch tends to overshadow the [[National Congress of Bolivia|Congress]], whose role is generally limited to debating and approving legislation initiated by the executive. The judiciary, consisting of the [[Supreme Court of Bolivia|Supreme Court]] and departmental and lower courts, has long been riddled with corruption and inefficiency. Through revisions to the constitution in 1994, and subsequent laws, the government has initiated potentially far-reaching reforms in the judicial system as well as increasing decentralizing powers to departments, municipalities, and indigenous territories.\n\nThe executive branch is headed by a president and vice president, and consists of a variable number (currently, 20) of government [[Ministry (government department)|ministries]]. The president is elected to a five-year term by [[Direct election|popular vote]], and governs from the Presidential Palace (popularly called the Burnt Palace, ''Palacio Quemado'') in La Paz. In the case that no candidate receives an [[absolute majority]] of the popular vote or more than 40% of the vote with an advantage of more than 10% over the second-place finisher, a run-off is to be held among the two candidates most voted.<ref name=\"presidencia.gob.bo\"/>\n\nThe ''Asamblea Legislativa Plurinacional'' ([[Plurinational Legislative Assembly]] or National Congress) has [[Bicameralism|two chambers]].

The constitutional capital is [[Sucre]], while the [[seat of government]] and executive capital is [[La Paz]]. The largest city and principal industrial center is [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], located on the [[Geography of Bolivia|Llanos Orientales]] (tropical lowlands), a mostly flat region in the east of the country.\n\nThe [[sovereign state]] of Bolivia is a [[constitution of Bolivia|constitutionally]] [[unitary state]], divided into [[Departments of Bolivia|nine departments]]. Its geography varies from the peaks of the [[Andes]] in the West, to the Eastern Lowlands, situated within the [[Amazon Basin]]. It is bordered to the north and east by [[Brazil]], to the southeast by [[Paraguay]], to the south by [[Argentina]], to the southwest by [[Chile]], and to the northwest by [[Peru]]. One-third of the country is within the [[Andes|Andean]] mountain range. With {{convert|1,098,581|km2|abbr=on}} of area, Bolivia is the fifth largest country in [[South America]], after [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], [[Peru]] and [[Colombia]] (and alongside [[Paraguay]], one of the only two landlocked countries in the [[Americas]]), the [[List of countries by area|27th largest in the world]], the largest [[landlocked country]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] and the world's [[Landlocked country|seventh largest landlocked country]], after [[Kazakhstan]], [[Mongolia]], [[Chad]], [[Niger]], [[Mali]] and [[Ethiopia]].\n\nThe country's population, estimated at 11&nbsp;million, is [[multiethnic]], including [[Amerindians]], [[Mestizo]]s, [[Europeans]], [[Asian people|Asian]]s and [[Africans]]. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the official and predominant language, although 36 [[Languages of Bolivia|indigenous language]]s also have official status, of which the most commonly spoken are [[Guarani dialects|Guarani]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Quechuan languages|Quechua languages]].\n\nBefore Spanish colonization, the Andean region of Bolivia was part of the [[Inca Empire]], while the northern and eastern lowlands were inhabited by independent tribes. Spanish ''[[conquistadors]]'' arriving from [[Cuzco]] and [[Asunci\u00f3n]] took control of the region in the 16th century. During the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial period]] Bolivia was administered by the [[Royal Audiencia of Charcas]]. Spain built its empire in large part upon the silver that was extracted from [[Mining in Bolivia|Bolivia's mines]].\nAfter the first call for independence in 1809, 16 years of war followed before the establishment of the Republic, named for [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]. Over the course of the 19th and early 20th century Bolivia lost control of several peripheral territories to neighboring countries including the [[War of the Pacific|seizure]] of its coastline by Chile in 1879. Bolivia remained relatively politically stable until 1971, when [[Hugo Banzer]] led a [[History of Bolivia (1964\u201382)#The Banzer regime|coup d'\u00e9tat]] which replaced the socialist government of [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Torres]] with a [[military dictatorship]] headed by Banzer; Torres was murdered in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] by a right-wing death squad in 1976. Banzer's regime cracked down on [[left-wing politics|leftist and socialist]] opposition and other forms of dissent, resulting in the torture and deaths of a number of Bolivian citizens. Banzer was ousted in 1978 and later returned as the democratically elected president of Bolivia from 1997 to 2001.\n\nModern Bolivia is a charter member of the [[United Nations|UN]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[Non-Aligned Movement|NAM]], [[Organization of American States|OAS]], [[Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization|ACTO]], [[Bank of the South]], [[ALBA]] and [[Union of South American Nations|USAN]].

Further, this elite's control of [[llama]] herds became a powerful control mechanism as llamas were essential for carrying goods between the civic centre and the periphery. These herds also came to symbolize class distinctions between the commoners and the elites.

As the surplus of food decreased, and thus the amount available to underpin their power, the control of the elites began to falter. The capital city became the last place viable for food production due to the resiliency of the raised field method of agriculture. Tiwanaku disappeared around AD 1000 because food production, the main source of the elites' power, dried up.

That revolution was followed by the [[La Paz revolution]] on 16 July 1809. The La Paz revolution marked a complete split with the Spanish government, while the Chuquisaca Revolution established a local independent junta in the name of the Spanish King deposed by Napoleon Bonaparte. Both revolutions were short-lived and defeated by the Spanish authorities in the Viceroyalty of the Rio de La Plata, but the following year the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] raged across the continent.\n\nBolivia was captured and recaptured many times during the war by the [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalists]] and patriots. Buenos Aires sent three military campaigns, all of which were defeated, and eventually limited itself to protecting the national borders at Salta. Bolivia was finally freed of Royalist dominion by Marshal [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]], with a military campaign coming from the North in support of the campaign of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]].

Peru and Bolivia formed the [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]], with de Santa Cruz as the ''Supreme Protector''. Following tension between the Confederation and Chile, Chile declared war on 28 December 1836. Argentina separately declared war on the Confederation on 9 May 1837. The Peruvian-Bolivian forces achieved several major victories during the [[War of the Confederation]]: the defeat of the Argentine expedition and the defeat of the first Chilean expedition on the fields of [[Paucarpata District|Paucarpata]] near the city of [[Arequipa]]. The Chilean army and its Peruvian rebel allies surrendered unconditionally and signed the [[Paucarpata Treaty]]. The treaty stipulated that Chile would withdraw from Peru-Bolivia, Chile would return captured Confederate ships, economic relations would be normalized, and the Confederation would pay Peruvian debt to Chile. However, the Chilean government and public rejected the peace treaty. Chile organized a second attack on the Confederation and defeated it in the [[Battle of Yungay]]. After this defeat, Santa Cruz resigned and went to exile in [[Ecuador]] and then Paris, and the Peruvian-Bolivian Confederation was dissolved.\n\nFollowing the renewed independence of Peru, Peruvian president General [[Agust\u00edn Gamarra]] invaded Bolivia. On 18 November 1841, the battle de Ingavi took place, in which the Bolivian Army defeated the Peruvian troops of Gamarra (killed in the battle). After the victory, Bolivia invaded Per\u00fa on several fronts.  The eviction of the Bolivian troops from the south of Peru would be achieved by the greater availability of material and human resources of Peru; the Bolivian Army did not have enough troops to maintain an occupation. In the district of Locumba \u2013 Tacna, a column of Peruvian soldiers and peasants defeated a Bolivian regiment in the so-called Battle of Los Altos de Chipe (Locumba). In the district of Sama and in Arica, the Peruvian colonel Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Lavay\u00e9n organized a troop that managed to defeat the Bolivian forces of Colonel Rodr\u00edguez Magari\u00f1os and threaten the port of Arica.

The relatively robust economic growth of the mid-1990s continued until about the third year of its term in office. After that, regional, global and domestic factors contributed to a decline in economic growth. Financial crises in Argentina and Brazil, lower world prices for export commodities, and reduced employment in the coca sector depressed the Bolivian economy. The public also perceived a significant amount of public sector corruption. These factors contributed to increasing social protests during the second half of Banzer's term.\n\nBetween January 1999 and April 2000, large-scale [[2000 Cochabamba protests|protests]] erupted in [[Cochabamba]], Bolivia's third largest city, in response to the [[Water privatization|privatisation of water]] resources by foreign companies and a subsequent doubling of water prices.

A July agreement between the MNR and the fourth-place MIR, which had again been led in the election by former President Jaime Paz Zamora, virtually ensured the election of S\u00e1nchez de Lozada in the congressional run-off, and on 6 August he was sworn in for the second time.

Faced with the option of resigning or more bloodshed, S\u00e1nchez de Lozada offered his resignation in a letter to an emergency session of Congress. After his resignation was accepted and his vice president, [[Carlos Mesa]], invested, he left on a commercially scheduled flight for the United States.\n\nThe country's internal situation became unfavorable for such political action on the international stage. After a resurgence of gas protests in 2005, Carlos Mesa attempted to resign in January 2005, but his offer was refused by Congress. On 22 March 2005, after weeks of new street protests from organizations accusing Mesa of bowing to U.S. corporate interests, Mesa again offered his resignation to Congress, which was accepted on 10 June.

However, by 2013 the foreign assistance is just a fraction of the government budget thanks to tax collection mainly from the profitable exports to Brazil and Argentina of natural gas.\n\n=== Foreign-exchange reserves ===\nThe amount in reserve currencies and [[gold]] held by Bolivia's Central Bank advanced from 1.085 billion US dollars in 2000, under [[Hugo Banzer Suarez]]'s government, to 15.282 billion US dollars in 2014 under [[Evo Morales]]' government.\n\n{| style=\"margin: 1em auto; padding: 0.5e text-align:left; clear:all; font-size:90%\"\n| style=\"background:#black; color:white; text-align: center; background-color: #9acd32;\" colspan=\"6\" |'''{{big|Foreign-exchange reserves 2000\u20132014 (MM US$)}}''' '''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bcb.gob.bo/webdocs/ReservasInternacionales/graficas/RIN_PAGWEB15ene15.pdf|title=Bolivia: Reservas Internacionales del BCB al 15 de Enero del 2015|author=BCB|date=19 January 2015|access-date=1 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102171343/https://www.bcb.gob.bo/webdocs/ReservasInternacionales/graficas/RIN_PAGWEB15ene15.pdf|archive-date=2 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>'''\n|-\n|\n<timeline>\nColors=\n  id:lightgrey value:rgb(0.85,0.85,0.75)\n  id:darkgrey  value:rgb(0.80,0.70,0.95)\n  id:sfondo value:rgb(0.95,0.95,0.95)\n  id:barra value:rgb(0.30,0.40,0.50)\n\nImageSize  = width:450 height:225\nPlotArea   = left: 60 bottom: 30 top: 20 right: 20\nDateFormat = x.y\nPeriod     = from:0 till:16000\nTimeAxis   = orientation:vertical\nAlignBars  = late\nScaleMajor = gridcolor:darkgrey increment:2000 start:2000\nScaleMinor = gridcolor:lightgrey increment:1000 start:1000\nBackgroundColors = canvas:sfondo\n\nBarData=\n\n  bar: 2000 text: 2000\n  bar: 2001 text: 2001\n  bar: 2002 text: 2002\n  bar: 2003 text: 2003\n  bar: 2004 text: 2004\n  bar: 2005 text: 2005\n  bar: 2006 text: 2006\n  bar: 2007 text: 2007\n  bar: 2008 text: 2008\n  bar: 2009 text: 2009\n  bar: 2010 text: 2010\n  bar: 2011 text: 2011\n  bar: 2012 text: 2012\n  bar: 2013 text: 2013\n  bar: 2014 text: 2014\n\nPlotData=\n  color:barra width:15 align:center\n\n  bar: 2000 from:1085  till: 0\n  bar: 2001 from:1077  till: 0\n  bar: 2002 from:854   till: 0\n  bar: 2003 from:976   till: 0\n  bar: 2004 from:1123  till: 0\n  bar: 2005 from:1714  till: 0\n  bar: 2006 from:3178  till: 0\n  bar: 2007 from:5319  till: 0\n  bar: 2008 from:7715  till: 0\n  bar: 2009 from:8580  till: 0\n  bar: 2010 from:9730  till: 0\n  bar: 2011 from:12091 till: 0\n  bar: 2012 from:14064 till: 0\n  bar: 2013 from:14430 till: 0\n  bar: 2014 from:15282 till: 0\n\nPlotData=\n\n  bar: 2000 at: 1085  fontsize:S text: 1.085 shift:(0,5)\n  bar: 2001 at: 1077  fontsize:S text: 1.077 shift:(0,5)\n  bar: 2002 at: 854   fontsize:S text: 854 shift:(0,5)\n  bar: 2003 at: 976   fontsize:S text: 976  shift:(0,5)\n  bar: 2004 at: 1123  fontsize:S text: 1'123 shift:(0,5)\n  bar: 2005 at: 1714  fontsize:S text: 1'714  shift:(0,5)\n  bar: 2006 at: 3178  fontsize:S text: 3'178 shift:(0,5)\n  bar: 2007 at: 5319  fontsize:S text: 5'319 shift:(0,5)\n  bar: 2008 at: 7715  fontsize:S text: 7'715 shift:(0,5)\n  bar: 2009 at: 8580  fontsize:S text: 8'580 shift:(0,5)\n  bar: 2010 at: 9730  fontsize:S text: 9'730  shift:(0,5)\n  bar: 2011 at: 12091 fontsize:S text: 12'091 shift:(0,5)\n  bar: 2012 at: 14064 fontsize:S text: 14'064 shift:(0,5)\n  bar: 2013 at: 14430 fontsize:S text: 14'430 shift:(0,5)\n  bar: 2014 at: 15282 fontsize:S text: 15'282 shift:(0,5)\n\n</timeline>\n|-\n|  style=\"background:#f5f5f5; text-align:center;\"| Fuente: [[Banco Central de Bolivia]], Gr\u00e1fica elaborada por: [[Wikipedia]].\n|}\n\n===Tourism===\n{{Main|Tourism in Bolivia}}\n\n{{wide image|Isla_del_Pescado,_Salar_de_Uyuni.jpg|900px|[[Salar de Uyuni]], one of the most visited sites in Bolivia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldlyadventurer.com/salar-de-uyuni-bolivian-salt-flats/|title=Visiting El Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia: A 2019 How-To Guide|date=16 May 2019}}</ref>}}\n\nThe income from tourism has become increasingly important.

The country's second largest city, [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], manages its own water and sanitation system relatively successfully by way of cooperatives. The government of [[Evo Morales]] intends to strengthen citizen participation within the sector. Increasing coverage requires a substantial increase of investment financing.\n\nAccording to the government the main problems in the sector are low access to sanitation throughout the country; low access to water in rural areas; insufficient and ineffective investments; a low visibility of community service providers; a lack of respect of indigenous customs; \"technical and institutional difficulties in the design and implementation of projects\"; a lack of capacity to operate and maintain infrastructure; an institutional framework that is \"not consistent with the political change in the country\"; \"ambiguities in the social participation schemes\"; a reduction in the quantity and \nquality of water due to climate change; pollution and a lack of integrated water resources management; and the lack of policies and programs for the reuse of wastewater.<ref name=\"PNSB\">Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia:[http://www.mmaya.gob.bo/documentos/pnsb_final.pdf Plan Nacional de Saneamiento Basico 2008\u20132015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228092846/http://www.mmaya.gob.bo/documentos/pnsb_final.pdf |date=28 February 2013 }}, retrieved on 30 September 2010</ref>\n\nOnly 27% of the population has access to [[improved sanitation]], 80 to 88% has access to [[improved water source]]s.

This system is the most commonly used time notation in the world today,<ref name=\"cldr\">See the [[Common Locale Data Repository]] for detailed data about the preferred date and time notations used across the world, as well the [[Locale (computer software)|locale]] settings of major computer [[operating system]]s, and the article [[Date and time representation by country]].</ref> and is used by international standard [[ISO 8601]].<ref name=\"iso8601\">International Standard [[ISO 8601]]: Data elements and interchange formats \u2013 Information interchange \u2013 Representation of dates and times. [[International Organization for Standardization]], 3rd ed., 2004.</ref>\n\nA number of countries, particularly English-speaking, use the [[12-hour clock]], or a mixture of the 24- and 12-hour time systems. In countries where the 12-hour clock is dominant, some professions prefer to use the 24-hour clock. For example, in the practice of [[medicine]], the 24-hour clock is generally used in documentation of care as it prevents any ambiguity as to when events occurred in a patient's [[medical history]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Dosage calculations |last=Pickar |first=Gloria D. |last2=Graham |first2=Hope |last3=Swart |first3=Beth |last4=Swedish |first4=Margaret |date=2011 |publisher=Nelson Education |isbn=9780176502591 |edition=2nd Canadian |location=Toronto |page=60}}</ref> In the [[United States]] and some other countries, it is popularly referred to as '''military time'''.<ref name=cldr /><ref>U.S. Government Printing Office, Style Manual.{{Cite web|url=http://www.gpoaccess.gov/stylemanual/2000/chapter_txt-12.html |title=12.

In the case of a [[leap second]], the value of ss may extend to 60. A leading zero is added for numbers under 10, but it is optional for the hours. The leading zero is very commonly used in computer applications, and always used when a specification requires it (for example, [[ISO 8601]]).\n\nWhere subsecond resolution is required, the seconds can be a [[Decimal#Decimal fractions|decimal fraction]]; that is, the fractional part follows a decimal dot or comma, as in 01:23:45.678. The most commonly used separator symbol between hours, minutes and seconds is the [[colon (punctuation)|colon]], which is also the symbol used in ISO 8601. In the past, some European countries used the [[Full stop|dot on the line]] as a separator, but most national standards on time notation have since then been changed to the international standard colon. In some contexts (including the U.S. military and some computer protocols), no separator is used and times are written as, for example, \"2359\".\n\n=== Midnight 00:00 and 24:00 ===\nIn the 24-hour time notation, the day begins at midnight, 00:00, and the last minute of the day begins at 23:59. Where convenient, the notation 24:00 may also be used to refer to midnight at the end of a given date<ref>[[ISO 8601]]:2004 ''Data elements and interchange formats \u2013 Information interchange \u2013 Representation of dates and times'', clause 4.2.3 Midnight</ref>&nbsp;\u2014 that is, 24:00 of one day is the same time as 00:00 of the following day.\n\nThe notation 24:00 mainly serves to refer to the exact end of a day in a time interval. A typical usage is giving opening hours ending at midnight (e.g. \"00:00\u201324:00\", \"07:00\u201324:00\"). Similarly, some bus and train timetables show 00:00 as departure time and 24:00 as arrival time. Legal contracts often run from the start date at 00:00 until the end date at 24:00.\n\nWhile the 24-hour notation unambiguously distinguishes between midnight at the start (00:00) and end (24:00) of any given date, there is no commonly accepted distinction among users of the 12-hour notation. [[Style guide]]s and military communication regulations in some English-speaking countries discourage the use of 24:00 even in the 24-hour notation, and recommend reporting times near midnight as 23:59 or 00:01 instead.<ref name=acp121>\"[http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf Communication instructions \u2013 General] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807210103/http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf |date=2011-08-07}}\", Allied Communications Publication ACP 121(I), page 3\u20136, Combined Communications-Electronics Board, October 2010<!-- IF THIS LINK GOES DEAD, see http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/ for the latest version of ACP 121 --></ref> Sometimes the use of 00:00 is also avoided.<ref name=acp121 /> In variance with this, the correspondence manual for the [[United States Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps]] formerly specified 0001 to 2400.<ref name=\"http://www.marforres.marines.mil/Portals/116/Docs/G-1/AAU/AAUDocuments/CORRESPONDENCE%20MANUAL.pdf\">SECNAV M-5216.5 Department of the Navy Correspondence Manual dated March 2010, Chapter 2, Section 5 Paragraph 15.

However, they have been used occasionally in some special contexts in the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and China where business hours extend beyond midnight, such as broadcast television production and scheduling.\n\n=== Computer support ===\nIn most countries, computers by default show the time in 24-hour notation. For example, [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS]] activate the 12-hour notation by default only if a computer is in a handful of [[12-hour clock#Computer support|specific language and region settings]]. The 24-hour system is commonly used in text-based interfaces. [[POSIX]] programs such as [[ls]] default to displaying timestamps in 24-hour format.\n\n=== Military time ===\nIn [[American English]], the term ''military time'' is a synonym for the 24-hour clock.<ref>{{Cite Oxford Dictionaries|military time}}</ref> In these dialects, the time of day is customarily given almost exclusively using the 12-hour clock notation, which counts the hours of the day as 12, 1, ..., 11 with suffixes ''a.m.'' and ''p.m.'' distinguishing the two [[Day|diurnal]] repetitions of this sequence. The 24-hour clock is commonly used there only in some specialist areas (military, aviation, navigation, tourism, meteorology, astronomy, computing, logistics, emergency services, hospitals), where the [[12-hour clock#Confusion at noon and midnight|ambiguities of the 12-hour notation]] are deemed too inconvenient, cumbersome, or dangerous.\n\nMilitary usage, as agreed between the United States and allied English-speaking military forces,<ref>{{Cite web\n| title=Communication Instructions General ACP 121(I)\n| url=http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf\n| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508202743/http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf\n| archivedate=2016-05-08\n}}</ref> differs in some respects from other twenty-four-hour time systems:\n*No hours/minutes separator is used when writing the time, and a letter designating the time zone is appended (for example \"0340Z\").\n*[[Leading zero]]s are always written out and are required to be spoken, so 5:43&nbsp;a.m. is spoken \"zero five forty-three\" (casually) or \"zero five four three\" (military radio), as opposed to \"five forty-three\" or \"five four three\".\n*[[List of military time zones|Military time zones]] are lettered and given word designations from the [[NATO phonetic alphabet]]. For example, in [[Eastern Time Zone|US Eastern Standard Time]] (UTC\u22125), which is designated time zone R, 6:00&nbsp;a.m. is written \"0600R\" and spoken \"zero six hundred Romeo\".\n*Local time is designated as zone J or \"[[NATO phonetic alphabet|Juliett]]\". \"1200J\" (\"twelve hundred Juliett\") is noon local time.\n*[[Greenwich Mean Time]] (GMT) or [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) is designated time zone Z, and thus called \"Zulu time\". (When used as a modern time zone, in practice, GMT and UTC coincide.

This system is the most commonly used time notation in the world today,<ref name=\"cldr\">See the [[Common Locale Data Repository]] for detailed data about the preferred date and time notations used across the world, as well the [[Locale (computer software)|locale]] settings of major computer [[operating system]]s, and the article [[Date and time representation by country]].</ref> and is used by international standard [[ISO 8601]].<ref name=\"iso8601\">International Standard [[ISO 8601]]: Data elements and interchange formats \u2013 Information interchange \u2013 Representation of dates and times.

In countries where the 12-hour clock is dominant, some professions prefer to use the 24-hour clock. For example, in the practice of [[medicine]], the 24-hour clock is generally used in documentation of care as it prevents any ambiguity as to when events occurred in a patient's [[medical history]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Dosage calculations |last=Pickar |first=Gloria D. |last2=Graham |first2=Hope |last3=Swart |first3=Beth |last4=Swedish |first4=Margaret |date=2011 |publisher=Nelson Education |isbn=9780176502591 |edition=2nd Canadian |location=Toronto |page=60}}</ref> In the [[United States]] and some other countries, it is popularly referred to as '''military time'''.<ref name=cldr /><ref>U.S. Government Printing Office, Style Manual.{{Cite web|url=http://www.gpoaccess.gov/stylemanual/2000/chapter_txt-12.html |title=12.

In the case of a [[leap second]], the value of ss may extend to 60. A leading zero is added for numbers under 10, but it is optional for the hours. The leading zero is very commonly used in computer applications, and always used when a specification requires it (for example, [[ISO 8601]]).\n\nWhere subsecond resolution is required, the seconds can be a [[Decimal#Decimal fractions|decimal fraction]]; that is, the fractional part follows a decimal dot or comma, as in 01:23:45.678. The most commonly used separator symbol between hours, minutes and seconds is the [[colon (punctuation)|colon]], which is also the symbol used in ISO 8601. In the past, some European countries used the [[Full stop|dot on the line]] as a separator, but most national standards on time notation have since then been changed to the international standard colon. In some contexts (including the U.S. military and some computer protocols), no separator is used and times are written as, for example, \"2359\".\n\n=== Midnight 00:00 and 24:00 ===\nIn the 24-hour time notation, the day begins at midnight, 00:00, and the last minute of the day begins at 23:59. Where convenient, the notation 24:00 may also be used to refer to midnight at the end of a given date<ref>[[ISO 8601]]:2004 ''Data elements and interchange formats \u2013 Information interchange \u2013 Representation of dates and times'', clause 4.2.3 Midnight</ref>&nbsp;\u2014 that is, 24:00 of one day is the same time as 00:00 of the following day.\n\nThe notation 24:00 mainly serves to refer to the exact end of a day in a time interval. A typical usage is giving opening hours ending at midnight (e.g. \"00:00\u201324:00\", \"07:00\u201324:00\"). Similarly, some bus and train timetables show 00:00 as departure time and 24:00 as arrival time. Legal contracts often run from the start date at 00:00 until the end date at 24:00.\n\nWhile the 24-hour notation unambiguously distinguishes between midnight at the start (00:00) and end (24:00) of any given date, there is no commonly accepted distinction among users of the 12-hour notation. [[Style guide]]s and military communication regulations in some English-speaking countries discourage the use of 24:00 even in the 24-hour notation, and recommend reporting times near midnight as 23:59 or 00:01 instead.<ref name=acp121>\"[http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf Communication instructions \u2013 General] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807210103/http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf |date=2011-08-07}}\", Allied Communications Publication ACP 121(I), page 3\u20136, Combined Communications-Electronics Board, October 2010<!-- IF THIS LINK GOES DEAD, see http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/ for the latest version of ACP 121 --></ref> Sometimes the use of 00:00 is also avoided.<ref name=acp121 /> In variance with this, the correspondence manual for the [[United States Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps]] formerly specified 0001 to 2400.<ref name=\"http://www.marforres.marines.mil/Portals/116/Docs/G-1/AAU/AAUDocuments/CORRESPONDENCE%20MANUAL.pdf\">SECNAV M-5216.5 Department of the Navy Correspondence Manual dated March 2010, Chapter 2, Section 5 Paragraph 15.

However, they have been used occasionally in some special contexts in the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and China where business hours extend beyond midnight, such as broadcast television production and scheduling.\n\n=== Computer support ===\nIn most countries, computers by default show the time in 24-hour notation. For example, [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS]] activate the 12-hour notation by default only if a computer is in a handful of [[12-hour clock#Computer support|specific language and region settings]]. The 24-hour system is commonly used in text-based interfaces. [[POSIX]] programs such as [[ls]] default to displaying timestamps in 24-hour format.\n\n=== Military time ===\nIn [[American English]], the term ''military time'' is a synonym for the 24-hour clock.<ref>{{Cite Oxford Dictionaries|military time}}</ref> In these dialects, the time of day is customarily given almost exclusively using the 12-hour clock notation, which counts the hours of the day as 12, 1, ..., 11 with suffixes ''a.m.'' and ''p.m.'' distinguishing the two [[Day|diurnal]] repetitions of this sequence. The 24-hour clock is commonly used there only in some specialist areas (military, aviation, navigation, tourism, meteorology, astronomy, computing, logistics, emergency services, hospitals), where the [[12-hour clock#Confusion at noon and midnight|ambiguities of the 12-hour notation]] are deemed too inconvenient, cumbersome, or dangerous.\n\nMilitary usage, as agreed between the United States and allied English-speaking military forces,<ref>{{Cite web\n| title=Communication Instructions General ACP 121(I)\n| url=http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf\n| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508202743/http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf\n| archivedate=2016-05-08\n}}</ref> differs in some respects from other twenty-four-hour time systems:\n*No hours/minutes separator is used when writing the time, and a letter designating the time zone is appended (for example \"0340Z\").\n*[[Leading zero]]s are always written out and are required to be spoken, so 5:43&nbsp;a.m. is spoken \"zero five forty-three\" (casually) or \"zero five four three\" (military radio), as opposed to \"five forty-three\" or \"five four three\".\n*[[List of military time zones|Military time zones]] are lettered and given word designations from the [[NATO phonetic alphabet]]. For example, in [[Eastern Time Zone|US Eastern Standard Time]] (UTC\u22125), which is designated time zone R, 6:00&nbsp;a.m. is written \"0600R\" and spoken \"zero six hundred Romeo\".\n*Local time is designated as zone J or \"[[NATO phonetic alphabet|Juliett]]\". \"1200J\" (\"twelve hundred Juliett\") is noon local time.\n*[[Greenwich Mean Time]] (GMT) or [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) is designated time zone Z, and thus called \"Zulu time\".

East Bengal later became the independent country of Bangladesh after the 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Lord Mountbatten meets Nehru, Jinnah and other Leaders to plan Partition of India.jpg|thumb|[[Louis Mountbatten]] discusses the partition plan with [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah]]]]\n[[File:West Bengal Legislative Assembly Entrance - Kolkata 2011-12-18 0339.JPG|thumb|Entrance to the Legislative Assembly in Kolkata (Calcutta)]]\nIn 1905, the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|first partition in Bengal]] was implemented as an administrative preference, making governing the two provinces, West and East Bengal, easier.<ref>{{cite web|title=India's History : Modern India : The First Partition of Bengal : 1905|url=http://www.indhistory.com/first-partition-bengal.html}}</ref> While the partition split the province between West Bengal, in which the majority was Hindu, and the East, where the majority was Muslim, the 1905 partition left considerable minorities of Hindus in East Bengal and Muslims in West Bengal. While the Muslims were in favour of the partition, as they would have their own province, Hindus were not. This controversy led to increased violence and protest and finally, in 1911, the two provinces were once again united.{{sfn|Baxter|1997|pp=39\u201340|ps=: \"The new province had a Muslim majority of about three to two ... The partition was widely welcomed by Muslims and sharply condemned by Hindus. Hindu opposition was expressed in many forms, ranging from boycott of British goods to revolutionary activities ... protests eventually bore fruit, and the partition was annulled in 1911.\"}}\n\nHowever, the disagreements between Hindus and Muslims in Bengal which had sparked the Partition of Bengal in 1905 still remained and laws, including the Partition of Bengal in 1947, were implemented to fulfil the political needs of the parties involved.\n\nAs per the plan, on 20 June 1947, The members of the Bengal Legislative Assembly cast three separate votes on the proposal to partition Bengal:\n* In the joint session of the house, composed of all the members of the Assembly, the division of the joint session of the House stood at 126 votes against and 90 votes for joining the existing Constituent Assembly (i.e., India)\n* Then the members of the Muslim-majority areas of Bengal in a separate session passed a motion by 106\u201335 votes against partitioning Bengal and instead joining a new Constituent Assembly (i.e., Pakistan) as a whole.\n* This was followed by the separate meeting of the members of the non-Muslim-majority areas of Bengal who by a division of 58\u201321 voted for partition of the province.\n\nUnder the Mountbatten Plan, a single majority vote in favour of partition by either notionally divided half of the Assembly would have decided the division of the province, and hence the house proceedings on 20 June resulted in the decision to partition Bengal. This set the stage for the creation of West Bengal as a province of [[Dominion of India|India]] and East Bengal as a province of the [[Dominion of Pakistan]].\n\nAlso in accordance with the Mountbatten Plan, in a referendum held on 7 July, the electorate of Sylhet voted to join East Bengal. Further, the Boundary Commission headed by Sir Cyril Radcliffe decided on the territorial demarcation between the two newly created provinces. Power was transferred to Pakistan and India on 14 and 15 August, respectively, under the [[Indian Independence Act 1947]].\n\n=== The United Bengal plan ===\n[[File:Suhrawardy of Bengal.jpg|thumb|upright|[[H. S. Suhrawardy]], the last [[Prime Minister of Bengal]], urged a separate independent status for the whole province]]\n[[File:Sarat Chandra Bose.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sarat Chandra Bose]] supported the United Bengal plan]]\nAfter it became apparent that the division of India on the basis of the [[Two-nation theory]] would almost certainly result in the partition of the Bengal province along religious lines, Bengal provincial Muslim League leader [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy|Suhrawardy]] came up with a new plan to create an independent Bengal state that would join neither Pakistan nor India and remain unpartitioned. Suhrawardy realised that if Bengal was partitioned, it would be economically disastrous for East Bengal{{sfn|Tripathi|1998|p=87}} as all coal mines, all [[jute mill]]s but two and other industrial plants would certainly go to the western part since these were in an overwhelmingly Hindu majority area.{{sfn|Chakrabarty|2004|p=138}} Most important of all, [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], then the largest city in India, an industrial and commercial hub and the largest port, would also go to the western part. Suhrawardy floated his idea on 24 April 1947 at a press conference in Delhi.{{sfn|Chakrabarty|2004|p=132}}\n\nHowever, the plan directly ran counter to that of the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League's]], which demanded the creation of a separate Muslim homeland on the basis of the two-nation theory. Bengal provincial Muslim League leadership opinion was divided. [[Barddhaman]]'s League leader [[Abul Hashim]] supported it.{{sfn|Chakrabarty|2004|p=135}} On the other hand, [[Nurul Amin]] and [[Mohammad Akram Khan]] opposed it.{{sfn|Chakrabarty|2004|p=135}}{{sfn|Jalal|1994|p=266|ps=: \"The president of the Bengal League, Maulana Akram Khan, publicly rejected any notion of a Bengali nation in which Muslims and Hindus would share power ... The speaker of the Bengal assembly, Noorul Amin, was confident that he could become the chief minister of east Bengal and so wanted partition.\"}} But [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] realised the validity of Suhrawardy's argument and gave his tacit support to the plan.{{sfn|Jalal|1994|p=265|ps=: \"An undivided Bengal was vital for Jinnah's strategy ... Jinnah told Mountbatten ... 'What is the use of Bengal without Calcutta; they had better remain united and independent.'\"}}{{sfn|Chakrabarty|2004|p=137}}{{sfn|Bandopadhyay|p=266}} After Jinnah's approval, Suhrawardy started gathering support for his plan.\n\nOn the Congress side, only a handful of leaders agreed to the plan. Among them was the influential Bengal provincial congress leader [[Sarat Chandra Bose]], the elder brother of [[Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose|Netaji]] and Kiran Shankar Roy. However most other BPCC leaders and Congress leadership including [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] and [[Vallabhbhai Patel|Patel]] rejected the plan. The Hindu nationalist party [[Hindu Mahasabha]] under the leadership of [[Shyama Prasad Mukherjee]] vehemently opposed it.{{sfn|Chakrabarty|2004|pp=140\u2013147}} Their opinion was that the plan is nothing but a ploy by Suhrawardy to stop the partition of the state so that the industrially developed western part including the city of Kolkata remains under League control. They also opined that even though the plan asked for a sovereign Bengal state, in practice it will be a virtual Pakistan and the Hindu minority will be at the mercy of the Muslim majority forever.{{sfn|Chakrabarty|2004|pp=140\u2013147}}{{sfn|Tripathi|1998|p=86}}\n\nAlthough the chances of the proposal seeing daylight without Congress central committee's approval was slim, Bose and Suhrawardy continued talks to reach an agreement on the political structure of the proposed state. Like Suhrawardy, Bose also felt that the partition would severely hamper Bengal's economy and almost half of the Hindu population would be left stranded on the [[East Pakistan|Pakistani side]].{{sfn|Chakrabarty|2004|p=142}} The agreement was published on 24 May 1947.{{sfn|Chakrabarty|2004|p=141}} However, this was largely a political agreement. The proposal had hardly any support at grassroots level, particularly among the Hindus.{{sfn|Chakrabarty|2004|p=149}} Muslim League's continuous propaganda on the two-nation theory for the previous six years combined with the marginalisation of Hindus in the Suhrawardy ministry and the [[Direct Action Day|vicious riots]] of 1946, which many Hindus believed was state sponsored, left little room for trust in Muslim League among Bengali Hindus.{{sfn|Tripathi|1998|pp=86, 186}} Soon afterwards, division arose among Bose and Suhrawardy on the question of the nature of the electorate; separate or joint. Suhrawardy insisted upon maintaining the separate electorate for Muslims and Non-Muslims. Bose was opposed to this. He withdrew and due to lack of any other significant support from the Congress's side, the United Bengal plan was discarded.{{sfn|Chakrabarty|2004|p=143}} Still, this relatively unknown episode marked the last attempt among Bengali Muslim and Hindu leadership to avoid the partition and live together.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nBefore the official Radcliffe line was drawn these were the religious demographics:\n*Muslims majority districts: Dinajpur, Rangpur, Malda, Murshidabad, Rajshahi, Bogra, Pabna, Mymensingh, Jessore, Nadia, Faridpur, Dhaka, Tippera, Bakerganj, Noakhali and Chittagong.\n*Non-Muslim majority Districts: Calcutta, Howrah, Hooghly, Birbhum, Burdwan, Bankura, Midnapore, Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling, 24 Pargana, Khulna and Chittagong Track hills.\nFinal division:\n*Pakistan: East Dinajpur, Rangpur, Rajshahi, Bogra, Pabna, Mymensingh, Sylhet (except Barak valley), Khulna, Bakerganj, Tippera, Noakhali, Chittagong, Jessore, East Nadia, Chittagong Track Hills.\n*India: West Dinajpur, Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling, Malda, Murshidabad, West Nadia, Calcutta, 24 Pargana, Burdwan, Birbhum, Midnapore,  Howrah, Hooghly and [[Barak Valley]] in [[Assam]].\nThe second partition of Bengal left behind a legacy of violence which continues to this day. As Bashabi Fraser put it, \"There is the reality of the continuous flow of 'economic migrants' / 'refugees' / 'infiltrators' / 'illegal immigrants' who cross over the border and pan out across the sub-continent, looking for work and a new home, setting in metropolitan centres as far off as Delhi and Mumbai, keeping the question of the Partition alive today. \"{{sfn|Fraser|2008|p=40}}\n\n=== Refugee crisis ===\n[[File:Gandhi in Noakhali 1946.jpg|thumb|[[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] in Noakhali, 1946]]\nA massive [[population transfer]] began immediately after partition. Millions of [[Hindus]] [[Human migration|migrated]] to India from East Bengal. The majority of them settled in West Bengal. A smaller number went to [[Assam]], Tripura and other states. However the refugee crisis was markedly different from [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]] at India's western border. Punjab witnessed widespread [[communal riots]] immediately before partition. As a result, population transfer in Punjab happened almost immediately after the partition as terrified people left their homes from both sides. Within a year the population exchange was largely complete between [[East Punjab|East]] and [[West Punjab]]. But in Bengal, violence was limited only to [[Direct Action Day|Kolkata]] and [[Noakhali genocide|Noakhali]]. And hence in Bengal migration occurred in a much more gradual fashion and continued over the next three decades following partition.{{sfn|Chatterji|2007|p=111}}<ref name=\"Hindu\" /> Although riots were limited in [[Bengal Presidency|pre-independence Bengal]], the environment was nonetheless communally charged. Both Hindus in East Bengal and Muslims in West Bengal felt unsafe and had to take a crucial decision that is whether to leave for an uncertain future in another country or to stay in subjugation under the other community.{{sfn|Chatterji|2007}} Among Hindus in East Bengal those who were economically better placed, particularly [[Caste system in India|higher caste Hindus]], left first. [[Government employee]]s were given a chance to swap their posts between India and Pakistan. The educated urban upper and middle class, the rural gentry, traders, businessmen and artisans left for India soon after partition. They often had relatives and other connections in West Bengal and were able to settle with less difficulty. Muslims followed a similar pattern. The urban and educated [[Upper class|upper]] and middle class left for East Bengal first.{{sfn|Chatterji|2007}}\n\nHowever poorer Hindus in East Bengal, most of whom belonged to lower castes like the ''Namashudras'' found it much more difficult to migrate. Their only property was immovable land holdings. Many [[Sharecropping|sharecropped]]. They didn't have any skills other than farming. As a result, most of them decided to stay in East Bengal. However the political climate in Pakistan deteriorated soon after partition and communal violence started to rise. In 1950 [[1950 East Pakistan genocide|severe riots]] occurred in [[Barisal]] and other places in East Pakistan, causing a further exodus of Hindus. The situation was vividly described by [[Jogendra Nath Mandal|Jogendranath Mandal's]] [[s:Resignation letter of Jogendra Nath Mandal|resignation letter]] to the then [[prime minister of Pakistan]] [[Liaquat Ali Khan]]. Mandal was a ''Namashudra'' leader and despite being a [[Scheduled castes and scheduled tribes|lower caste Hindu]], he supported Muslim League as a protest to the subjugation of lower caste Hindus by their higher caste co-religionists.{{sfn|Chakrabarty|2004|p=113}} He fled to India and resigned from his cabinet minister's post. Throughout the next two decades Hindus left East Bengal whenever communal tensions flared up or relationship between India and Pakistan deteriorated, as in [[1964 East Pakistan genocide|1964]]. The situation of the Hindu minority in East Bengal reached its worst in the months preceding and during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] of 1971, when the Pakistani army systematically targeted ethnic Bengalis regardless of religious background as part of [[Operation Searchlight]].\n\nIn independent Bangladesh, state sponsored discrimination of Hindus largely stopped. But like India, the two communities relationship remains tense and occasional communal violence occurred, such as in the aftermath of [[Babri Mosque]] [[Demolition of Babri Masjid|demolition]]. [[Illegal immigration in India|Migration to India]] continues to present day although now it is mostly due to economic reasons and is not limited to Hindus alone.\n\nThough Muslims in post-independence West Bengal faced some discrimination{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}, it was unlike the [[State sponsored racism|state sponsored discrimination]] faced by the Hindus in East Bengal. While Hindus had to flee from East Bengal, Muslims were able to stay in West Bengal. Over the years, however, the community became ghettoised and was socially and economically segregated from the majority community.{{sfn|Chatterji|2007|p=181}} Muslims lag well behind other minorities like [[Sikhs]] and Christians in almost all social indicators like [[literacy]] and per capita income.<ref>{{cite report|url=http://iamc.com/reports/2006/pmhlc.muslims.pdf |author=Rajinder Sachar |title=  Sachar Committee Report |date=2006}}</ref>\n\nApart from West Bengal, thousands of [[Bihari Muslims]] also settled in East Bengal. They had suffered terribly in [[Direct Action Day#Bihar and rest of India|severe riots]] before partition. But they supported [[West Pakistan]] during Bangladesh's liberation war and were subsequently denied citizenship by Bengalis in independent Bangladesh. Most of these Bihari refugees [[Stranded Pakistanis|still remain stateless]].\n\n==== Statistics ====\nThe 1951 census in India recorded 2.523 million refugees from East Bengal. Among them 2.061 million settled in West Bengal. The rest went to Assam, Tripura and other states.{{sfn|Hill|Seltzer|Leaning|Malik|2005|p=13}} By 1973 their number reached over 6 million. The following table shows the major waves of refugee influx and the incident that caused it.{{sfn|Luthra|1972|pp=18\u201319}}{{refn|group=note|During [[Bangladesh liberation war]] 11 million people from both communities took shelter in India.

Rest were from [[Bihar]].{{sfn|Hill|Seltzer|Leaning|Malik|2005|p=13}} By 1961 the numbers reached 850,000. Crude estimates suggest that about 1.5 million Muslims migrated from West Bengal and Bihar to East Bengal in two decades after partition.{{sfn|Chatterji|2007|p=166}}\n\n==== Government response ====\nIn Punjab, Indian Government anticipated a population transfer and was ready to take proactive measures. Land plots which were evacuated by Muslims were allotted to incoming Hindu and Sikh refugees.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Government allocated substantial resources for rehabilitation of refugees in Punjab. In contrast there was no such planning in the eastern part of the country. Neither Central nor West Bengal state Government anticipated any large-scale population exchange and no coordinated policy was in place to rehabilitate millions of homeless people. The newly independent country had few resource and the Central Government was exhausted in resettling 7 million refugees in Punjab. Instead of providing rehabilitation, the Indian Government tried to stop and even reverse the refugee influx from East Bengal. India and Pakistan signed the [[Liaquat\u2013Nehru Pact|Nehru-Liaqut pact]] in 1950 to stop any further population exchange between West and East Bengal. Both countries agreed to take the refugees back and return them their property which they evacuated in their respective countries. But in practice both countries failed to uphold it. Even after it became clear that refugees were determined not to be sent back, the governments of both countries failed to provide any significant assistance. The Government policy of East Bengal refugee rehabilitation mostly consisted of sending them to 'empty areas', mostly outside of West Bengal. One of the most controversial of such schemes was the Government's decision to settle the refugees by force in [[Dandakaranya]], a barren plot of land in [[Chhattisgarh|central India]].<ref name=\"Hindu\"/>{{sfn|Chatterji|2007}}\n\n==== Social impact ====\nWithout Government's assistance the refugees often settled themselves. Some found jobs in factories. Many took small businesses and [[Hawker (trade)|hawking]]. Numerous refugee colonies sprang up in [[Nadia district|Nadia]], [[North 24 Parganas district|24 Paraganas]] and [[Kolkata]]'s suburbs.\n\n==== Tripura's tribal insurgency ====\n{{Main|Insurgency in Northeast India#Tripura}}\nThe [[Twipra Kingdom#British Era|princely state of Tripura]] had a predominantly tribal population. But educated Bengalis were welcomed by the King and they were prominent in the state's administration in pre-independence India. But after partition thousands of Bengali Hindus migrated to Tripura. This changed the state's [[demography]] completely. Tripura's tribes became a minority in their own [[homeland]] and also lost their land holdings. As a result, tribal [[insurgency]] began which led violent riots among tribes and Bengalis in 1980. Low scale insurgency continues to this day.<ref>Manorama Yearbook 1998</ref>\n\n=== Economic impact ===\n\n==== West Bengal ====\n[[Radcliffe Line|Radcliffe's line]] split Bengal, which [[History of Bengal|historically]] was always a [[Bengal|single economic zone]], single cultural and ethnic (Bengali-Hindu or Bengali-Muslim) zone, into two-halves. The two-halves were intricately connected with each other. The [[Ganges Delta|fertile East]] produced food and raw materials which the West consumed and the industrialised West produced manufactured goods which were consumed by the East. This mutually beneficial trade and exchange was severely disrupted by the partition. Rail, road and water communication routes were severed between the two. After partition West Bengal suffered from a substantial food shortage as the fertile [[Rice paddy|rice]] producing districts of Bengal went to the eastern half. The shortage continued throughout the 1950s and 1960s. By 1959, West Bengal faced an annual food shortage of 950,000 tones. Hunger marches became a common sight in Kolkata.{{Chatterji|2007|pp=244\u2013245}}\n[[File:Prafullachandra Ghosh & Msd Ali at Writers' Building in 1947.jpg|thumb|[[Prafulla Chandra Ghosh]] (left), the first chief minister of West Bengal, with [[Mohammad Ali of Bogra]]]]\n[[Jute]] was the largest industry in Bengal at the time of partition. Radcliffe's line left every single jute mill in West Bengal but four fifth of the jute producing land in East Bengal. The [[Jute#Tossa jute (Corchorus olitorius)|best quality fibre yielding breeds]] of jute were [[Jute cultivation|cultivated]] mostly in East Bengal. India and Pakistan initially went into a [[trade agreement]] to import raw jute from East Bengal for West Bengal's mills. However, Pakistan had plans to set up its own mills and put restrictions on raw jute export to India. West Bengal's mills faced acute shortage. The industry faced a crisis.{{sfn|Chatterji|2007|p=240}} On the other hand, jute farmers in East Bengal were now without a market to sell their produce. Jute export to West Bengal suddenly became an anti-national act for Pakistan. Smuggling of raw jute shot up across the border.{{sfn|Schendel|2005|pp=158\u2013159}} However West Bengal rapidly increased jute production and by mid-to-late 1950s became largely self-sufficient in jute.<ref name=\"faostat.fao.org\">[http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=567#ancor FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS]</ref> West Bengal's mills became less dependent on East Bengal for raw material. Pakistan also set up new [[Adamjee Jute Mills|factories]] to process its local produce instead of exporting to India.{{sfn|Schendel|2005|p=159}} The following table shows jute production details in two countries in 1961.<ref name=\"faostat.fao.org\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The paper mills used East Bengal's [[Bamboo]] and the tanneries consumed leather, also mainly produced in East Bengal. Like jute, lack of raw material pushed these two industries into decline.{{sfn|Chatterji|2007|pp=241\u2013242}}\n\nDespite [[Government of India|center]] and [[Government of West Bengal|state governments']] best efforts, the pressure of millions of refugees, food shortages and [[deindustrialization|industrial decline]] put post-independence West Bengal in a severe crisis. [[Bidhan Chandra Roy|Dr. B. C. Roy]]'s government tried to cope up with the situation by initiating several projects. The government built [[Irrigation|irrigation networks]] like [[Damodar Valley Corporation|DVC]] and [[Mayurakshi River|Mayurakshi]] project, the [[Durgapur Steel Plant|Durgapur industrial zone]] and the [[Bidhannagar, Kolkata|Salt Lake City]]. But these failed to arrest West Bengal's decline. Poverty rose. West Bengal lost its top place and lagged well behind other Indian states in industrial development. Massive political unrest, strikes and violence crippled the state throughout the next three decade after partition.{{sfn|Chatterji|2007}}\n\n==== North East India ====\nRail and road links connecting [[North East India]] to the rest of the country passed through East Bengal territory. The lines connecting [[Siliguri]] in [[North Bengal]] to Kolkata and Assam to [[Chittagong]] were severed. The whole [[Bengal Assam Railway|Assam Railway]] was cut off from the rest of the [[Indian Railways|Indian system]].<ref name=\"History of Indian railways\">[http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-history4.html History of Indian railways]</ref> These lines carried almost all [[freight]] traffic from these regions. The most important commodities were tea and timber. The [[Assam tea|tea industry in Assam]] depended on the [[Chittagong port]] to export its produce and import raw materials for the industry such as coal which was used as the fuel to [[Tea processing|dry]] the [[tea leaves]]. The industry was severely hit as Chittagong port went to Pakistan. Initially India and Pakistan reached an agreement to allow cross border transit traffic but now India had to pay a [[tariff]]. By 1950, India reconnected Assam to the rest of the country's rail network by building a 229&nbsp;km [[meter gauge]] rail link through the [[Siliguri Corridor]].<ref name=\"History of Indian railways\"/> But now the Tea chests from Assam's [[Tea garden (cultivation)|gardens]] would have to be carried over a much longer distance to reach the [[Port of Kolkata|Kolkata port]]. Exporting tea via the nearby Chittagong port was still an option but after [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965's war]] all transit traffic was switched off by Pakistan.{{sfn|Schendel|2005|p=150}}\n\nEast Pakistan became independent Bangladesh in 1971 but cross border railway traffic did not resume until 2003. By the 1990s, India upgraded the Assam rail link to [[Indian gauge|broad gauge]] right up to [[Dibrugarh]] thereby easing the traffic problem in [[Brahmaputra]] [[Brahmaputra Valley|valley]] region, but the southern section of this area which comprises Tripura, [[Mizoram]], Manipur and [[Barak valley]] of Assam still faces serious [[Transport|connectivity]] problem. Talks between the two countries are currently underway to allow transit traffic between this area and mainland India through Bangladesh.\n\n==== East Bengal ====\n[[File:Khawaja Nazimuddin of Pakistan.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Sir Khawaja Nazimuddin]], the first chief minister of East Bengal]]\nAt the time of partition, East Bengal had no large industry. There were few mineral resources in this region. Its economy was completely agrarian. The main produce was food grains and other crops, jute, [[bamboo]], leather and [[Fishery|fish]]. These raw materials were consumed by factories in and around Kolkata. Kolkata was the center of Bengal's economic and social development for both Hindus and Muslims. All large industries, military bases, government offices and most of the institutions of higher education were situated in Kolkata.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Without Kolkata, East Bengal was decapitated.{{sfn|Jalal|1994|p=3|ps=: \"Stripped of Calcutta and western Bengal, eastern Bengal was reduced to the status of an over-populated rural slum.\"}} It lost its traditional market for agricultural products. It also lost the Kolkata port, the premium port of the whole country at that time. East Bengal had to begin from nothing. [[Dhaka]] at that time was only a district headquarters. Government offices had to be placed inside makeshift buildings. Dhaka also faced a severe human resource crisis. The majority of high-ranking officers in British Indian administration were Hindu and they migrated to West Bengal. Often these posts had to be filled up by West Pakistani officers.

Predominantly Hindu [[West Bengal]] became a state  of [[Dominion of India|India]], and predominantly  Muslim [[East Bengal]] (now [[Bangladesh]]) became a province of [[Pakistan]].\n\nOn 20 June 1947, the [[Bengal Legislative Assembly]] meet to decide the future of the [[Bengal Presidency]], on whether it would be a [[United Bengal]] within India or Pakistan; or be divided into East and West Bengal. At the preliminary joint session, the assembly decided by 120 votes to 90 that it should remain united if it joined the new [[Constituent Assembly of Pakistan]]. Later, a separate meeting of legislators from West Bengal decided by 58 votes to 21 that the province should be partitioned and that West Bengal should join the existing [[Constituent Assembly of India]]. In another separate meeting of legislators from East Bengal, it was decided by 106 votes to 35 that the province should not be partitioned and 107 votes to 34 that East Bengal should join Pakistan in the event of partition.{{sfn|Mukherjee|1987|p=230}}\n\nOn 6 July 1947, the [[1947 Sylhet referendum|Sylhet referendum]] decided to sever Sylhet from [[Assam Province|Assam]] and merge it into East Bengal.\n\nThe partition, with the power transferred to Pakistan and India on 14\u201315 August 1947, was done according to what has come to be known as the \"3 June Plan\" or \"[[Mountbatten Plan]]\". India's independence on 15 August 1947 ended over 150 years of British influence in the Indian subcontinent. East Bengal later became the independent country of Bangladesh after the 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Lord Mountbatten meets Nehru, Jinnah and other Leaders to plan Partition of India.jpg|thumb|[[Louis Mountbatten]] discusses the partition plan with [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah]]]]\n[[File:West Bengal Legislative Assembly Entrance - Kolkata 2011-12-18 0339.JPG|thumb|Entrance to the Legislative Assembly in Kolkata (Calcutta)]]\nIn 1905, the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|first partition in Bengal]] was implemented as an administrative preference, making governing the two provinces, West and East Bengal, easier.<ref>{{cite web|title=India's History : Modern India : The First Partition of Bengal : 1905|url=http://www.indhistory.com/first-partition-bengal.html}}</ref> While the partition split the province between West Bengal, in which the majority was Hindu, and the East, where the majority was Muslim, the 1905 partition left considerable minorities of Hindus in East Bengal and Muslims in West Bengal. While the Muslims were in favour of the partition, as they would have their own province, Hindus were not. This controversy led to increased violence and protest and finally, in 1911, the two provinces were once again united.{{sfn|Baxter|1997|pp=39\u201340|ps=: \"The new province had a Muslim majority of about three to two ... The partition was widely welcomed by Muslims and sharply condemned by Hindus. Hindu opposition was expressed in many forms, ranging from boycott of British goods to revolutionary activities ... protests eventually bore fruit, and the partition was annulled in 1911.\"}}\n\nHowever, the disagreements between Hindus and Muslims in Bengal which had sparked the Partition of Bengal in 1905 still remained and laws, including the Partition of Bengal in 1947, were implemented to fulfill the political needs of the parties involved.\n\nAs per the plan, on 20 June 1947, The members of the Bengal Legislative Assembly cast three separate votes on the proposal to partition Bengal:\n* In the joint session of the house, composed of all the members of the Assembly, the division of the joint session of the House stood at 126 votes against and 90 votes for joining the existing Constituent Assembly (i.e., India)\n* Then the members of the Muslim-majority areas of Bengal in a separate session passed a motion by 106\u201335 votes against partitioning Bengal and instead joining a new Constituent Assembly (i.e., Pakistan) as a whole.\n* This was followed by the separate meeting of the members of the non-Muslim-majority areas of Bengal who by a division of 58\u201321 voted for partition of the province.\n\nUnder the Mountbatten Plan, a single majority vote in favour of partition by either notionally divided half of the Assembly would have decided the division of the province, and hence the house proceedings on 20 June resulted in the decision to partition Bengal. This set the stage for the creation of West Bengal as a province of the [[Union of India]] and East Bengal as a province of the [[Dominion of Pakistan]].\n\nAlso in accordance with the Mountbatten Plan, in a referendum held on 7 July, the electorate of Sylhet voted to join East Bengal. Further, the Boundary Commission headed by Sir Cyril Radcliffe decided on the territorial demarcation between the two newly created provinces. Power was transferred to Pakistan and India on 14 and 15 August, respectively, under the [[Indian Independence Act 1947]].\n\n=== The United Bengal plan ===\n[[File:Suhrawardy of Bengal.jpg|thumb|upright|[[H. S. Suhrawardy]], the last [[Prime Minister of Bengal]], urged a separate independent status for the whole province]]\n[[File:Sarat Chandra Bose.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sarat Chandra Bose]] supported the United Bengal plan]]\nAfter it became apparent that the division of India on the basis of the [[Two-nation theory]] would almost certainly result in the partition of the Bengal province along religious lines, Bengal provincial Muslim League leader [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy|Suhrawardy]] came up with a new plan to create an independent Bengal state that would join neither Pakistan nor India and remain unpartitioned. Suhrawardy realised that if Bengal was partitioned, it would be economically disastrous for East Bengal{{sfn|Tripathi|1998|p=87}} as all coal mines, all [[jute mill]]s but two and other industrial plants would certainly go to the western part since these were in an overwhelmingly Hindu majority area.{{sfn|Chakrabarty|2004|p=138}} Most important of all, [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], then the largest city in India, an industrial and commercial hub and the largest port, would also go to the western part. Suhrawardy floated his idea on 24 April 1947 at a press conference in Delhi.{{sfn|Chakrabarty|2004|p=132}}\n\nHowever, the plan directly ran counter to that of the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League's]], which demanded the creation of a separate Muslim homeland on the basis of the two-nation theory. Bengal provincial Muslim League leadership opinion was divided. [[Barddhaman]]'s League leader [[Abul Hashim]] supported it.{{sfn|Chakrabarty|2004|p=135}} On the other hand, [[Nurul Amin]] and [[Mohammad Akram Khan]] opposed it.{{sfn|Chakrabarty|2004|p=135}}{{sfn|Jalal|1994|p=266|ps=: \"The president of the Bengal League, Maulana Akram Khan, publicly rejected any notion of a Bengali nation in which Muslims and Hindus would share power ... The speaker of the Bengal assembly, Noorul Amin, was confident that he could become the chief minister of east Bengal and so wanted partition.\"}} But [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] realised the validity of Suhrawardy's argument and gave his tacit support to the plan.{{sfn|Jalal|1994|p=265|ps=: \"An undivided Bengal was vital for Jinnah's strategy ... Jinnah told Mountbatten ... 'What is the use of Bengal without Calcutta; they had better remain united and independent.'\"}}{{sfn|Chakrabarty|2004|p=137}}{{sfn|Bandopadhyay|p=266}} After Jinnah's approval, Suhrawardy started gathering support for his plan.\n\nOn the Congress side, only a handful of leaders agreed to the plan. Among them was the influential Bengal provincial congress leader [[Sarat Chandra Bose]], the elder brother of [[Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose|Netaji]] and Kiran Shankar Roy. However most other BPCC leaders and Congress leadership including [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] and [[Vallabhbhai Patel|Patel]] rejected the plan. The Hindu nationalist party [[Hindu Mahasabha]] under the leadership of [[Shyama Prasad Mukherjee]] vehemently opposed it.{{sfn|Chakrabarty|2004|pp=140-147}} Their opinion was that the plan is nothing but a ploy by Suhrawardy to stop the partition of the state so that the industrially developed western part including the city of Kolkata remains under League control. They also opined that even though the plan asked for a sovereign Bengal state, in practice it will be a virtual Pakistan and the Hindu minority will be at the mercy of the Muslim majority forever.{{sfn|Chakrabarty|2004|pp=140-147}}{{sfn|Tripathi|1998|p=86}}\n\nAlthough the chances of the proposal seeing daylight without Congress central committee's approval was slim, Bose and Suhrawardy continued talks to reach an agreement on the political structure of the proposed state. Like Suhrawardy, Bose also felt that the partition would severely hamper Bengal's economy and almost half of the Hindu population would be left stranded on the [[East Pakistan|Pakistani side]].{{sfn|Chakrabarty|2004|p=142}} The agreement was published on 24 May 1947.{{sfn|Chakrabarty|2004|p=141}} However, this was largely a political agreement. The proposal had hardly any support at grassroots level, particularly among the Hindus.{{sfn|Chakrabarty|2004|p=149}} Muslim League's continuous propaganda on the two-nation theory for the previous six years combined with the marginalisation of Hindus in the Suhrawardy ministry and the [[Direct Action Day|vicious riots]] of 1946, which many Hindus believed was state sponsored, left little room for trust in Muslim League among Bengali Hindus.{{sfn|Tripathi|1998|pp=86, 186}} Soon afterwards, division arose among Bose and Suhrawardy on the question of the nature of the electorate; separate or joint. Suhrawardy insisted upon maintaining the separate electorate for Muslims and Non-Muslims. Bose was opposed to this. He withdrew and due to lack of any other significant support from the Congress's side, the United Bengal plan was discarded.{{sfn|Chakrabarty|2004|p=143}} Still, this relatively unknown episode marked the last attempt among Bengali Muslim and Hindu leadership to avoid the partition and live together.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nBefore the official Radcliffe line was drawn these were the religious demographics:\n*Muslims majority districts: Dinajpur, Rangpur, Malda, Murshidabad, Rajshahi, Bogra, Pabna, Mymensingh, Jessore, Nadia, Faridpur, Dhaka, Tippera, Bakerganj, Noakhali and Chittagong.\n*Non-Muslim majority Districts: Calcutta, Howrah, Hooghly, Birbhum, Burdwan, Bankura, Midnapore, Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling, 24 Pargana, Khulna and Chittagong Track hills.\nFinal division:\n*Pakistan: East Dinajpur, Rangpur, Rajshahi, Bogra, Pabna, Mymensingh, Sylhet (except Barak valley), Khulna, Bakerganj, Tippera, Noakhali, Chittagong, Jessore, East Nadia, Chittagong Track Hills.\n*India: West Dinajpur, Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling, Malda, Murshidabad, West Nadia, Calcutta, 24 Pargana, Burdwan, Birbhum, Midnapore,  Howrah, Hooghly and [[Barak Valley]] in [[Assam]].\nThe second partition of Bengal left behind a legacy of violence which continues to this day. As Bashabi Fraser put it, \"There is the reality of the continuous flow of 'economic migrants' / 'refugees' / 'infiltrators' / 'illegal immigrants' who cross over the border and pan out across the sub-continent, looking for work and a new home, setting in metropolitan centres as far off as Delhi and Mumbai, keeping the question of the Partition alive today. \"{{sfn|Fraser|2008|p=40}}\n\n=== Refugee crisis ===\n[[File:Gandhi in Noakhali 1946.jpg|thumb|[[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] in Noakhali, 1946]]\nA massive [[population transfer]] began immediately after partition. Millions of [[Hindus]] [[Human migration|migrated]] to India from East Bengal. The majority of them settled in West Bengal. A smaller number went to [[Assam]], Tripura and other states. However the refugee crisis was markedly different from [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]] at India's western border. Punjab witnessed widespread [[communal riots]] immediately before partition. As a result, population transfer in Punjab happened almost immediately after the partition as terrified people left their homes from both sides. Within a year the population exchange was largely complete between [[East Punjab|East]] and [[West Punjab]]. But in Bengal, violence was limited only to [[Direct Action Day|Kolkata]] and [[Noakhali genocide|Noakhali]]. And hence in Bengal migration occurred in a much more gradual fashion and continued over the next three decades following partition.{{sfn|Chatterji|2007|p=111}}<ref name=\"Hindu\" /> Although riots were limited in [[Bengal Presidency|pre-independence Bengal]], the environment was nonetheless communally charged. Both Hindus in East Bengal and Muslims in West Bengal felt unsafe and had to take a crucial decision that is whether to leave for an uncertain future in another country or to stay in subjugation under the other community.{{sfn|Chatterji|2007}} Among Hindus in East Bengal those who were economically better placed, particularly [[Caste system in India|higher caste Hindus]], left first. [[Government employee]]s were given a chance to swap their posts between India and Pakistan. The educated urban upper and middle class, the rural gentry, traders, businessmen and artisans left for India soon after partition. They often had relatives and other connections in West Bengal and were able to settle with less difficulty. Muslims followed a similar pattern. The urban and educated [[Upper class|upper]] and middle class left for East Bengal first.{{sfn|Chatterji|2007}}\n\nHowever poorer Hindus in East Bengal, most of whom belonged to lower castes like the ''Namashudras'' found it much more difficult to migrate. Their only property was immovable land holdings. Many [[Sharecropping|sharecropped]]. They didn't have any skills other than farming. As a result, most of them decided to stay in East Bengal. However the political climate in Pakistan deteriorated soon after partition and communal violence started to rise. In 1950 [[1950 East Pakistan genocide|severe riots]] occurred in [[Barisal]] and other places in East Pakistan, causing a further exodus of Hindus. The situation was vividly described by [[Jogendra Nath Mandal|Jogendranath Mandal's]] [[s:Resignation letter of Jogendra Nath Mandal|resignation letter]] to the then [[prime minister of Pakistan]] [[Liaquat Ali Khan]]. Mandal was a ''Namashudra'' leader and despite being a [[Scheduled castes and scheduled tribes|lower caste Hindu]], he supported Muslim League as a protest to the subjugation of lower caste Hindus by their higher caste co-religionists.{{sfn|Chakrabarty|2004|p=113}} He fled to India and resigned from his cabinet minister's post. Throughout the next two decades Hindus left East Bengal whenever communal tensions flared up or relationship between India and Pakistan deteriorated, as in [[1964 East Pakistan genocide|1964]]. The situation of the Hindu minority in East Bengal reached its worst in the months preceding and during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] of 1971, when the Pakistani army systematically targeted ethnic Bengalis regardless of religious background as part of [[Operation Searchlight]].\n\nIn independent Bangladesh, state sponsored discrimination of Hindus largely stopped. But like India, the two communities relationship remains tense and occasional communal violence occurred, such as in the aftermath of [[Babri Mosque]] [[Demolition of Babri Masjid|demolition]]. [[Illegal immigration in India|Migration to India]] continues to present day although now it is mostly due to economic reasons and is not limited to Hindus alone.\n\nThough Muslims in post-independence West Bengal faced some discrimination{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}, it was unlike the [[State sponsored racism|state sponsored discrimination]] faced by the Hindus in East Bengal. While Hindus had to flee from East Bengal, Muslims were able to stay in West Bengal. Over the years, however, the community became ghettoised and was socially and economically segregated from the majority community.{{sfn|Chatterji|2007|p=181}} Muslims lag well behind other minorities like [[Sikhs]] and Christians in almost all social indicators like [[literacy]] and per capita income.<ref>{{cite report|url=http://iamc.com/reports/2006/pmhlc.muslims.pdf |author=Rajinder Sachar |title=  Sachar Committee Report |date=2006}}</ref>\n\nApart from West Bengal, thousands of [[Bihari Muslims]] also settled in East Bengal. They had suffered terribly in [[Direct Action Day#Bihar and rest of India|severe riots]] before partition. But they supported [[West Pakistan]] during Bangladesh's liberation war and were subsequently denied citizenship by Bengalis in independent Bangladesh. Most of these Bihari refugees [[Stranded Pakistanis|still remain stateless]].\n\n==== Statistics ====\nThe 1951 census in India recorded 2.523 million refugees from East Bengal. Among them 2.061 million settled in West Bengal. The rest went to Assam, Tripura and other states.{{sfn|Hill|Seltzer|Leaning|Malik|2005|p=13}} By 1973 their number reached over 6 million. The following table shows the major waves of refugee influx and the incident that caused it.{{sfn|Luthra|1972|pp=18-19}}{{refn|group=note|During [[Bangladesh liberation war]] 11 million people from both communities took shelter in India.

Rest were from [[Bihar]].{{sfn|Hill|Seltzer|Leaning|Malik|2005|p=13}} By 1961 the numbers reached 850,000. Crude estimates suggest that about 1.5 million Muslims migrated from West Bengal and Bihar to East Bengal in two decades after partition.{{sfn|Chatterji|2007|p=166}}\n\n==== Government response ====\nIn Punjab, Indian Government anticipated a population transfer and was ready to take proactive measures. Land plots which were evacuated by Muslims were allotted to incoming Hindu and Sikh refugees.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Government allocated substantial resources for rehabilitation of refugees in Punjab. In contrast there was no such planning in the eastern part of the country. Neither Central nor West Bengal state Government anticipated any large-scale population exchange and no coordinated policy was in place to rehabilitate millions of homeless people. The newly independent country had few resource and the Central Government was exhausted in resettling 7 million refugees in Punjab. Instead of providing rehabilitation, the Indian Government tried to stop and even reverse the refugee influx from East Bengal. India and Pakistan signed the [[Liaquat\u2013Nehru Pact|Nehru-Liaqut pact]] in 1950 to stop any further population exchange between West and East Bengal. Both countries agreed to take the refugees back and return them their property which they evacuated in their respective countries. But in practice both countries failed to uphold it. Even after it became clear that refugees were determined not to be sent back, the governments of both countries failed to provide any significant assistance. The Government policy of East Bengal refugee rehabilitation mostly consisted of sending them to 'empty areas', mostly outside of West Bengal. One of the most controversial of such schemes was the Government's decision to settle the refugees by force in [[Dandakaranya]], a barren plot of land in [[Chhattisgarh|central India]].<ref name=\"Hindu\"/>{{sfn|Chatterji|2007}}\n\n==== Social impact ====\nWithout Government's assistance the refugees often settled themselves. Some found jobs in factories. Many took small businesses and [[Hawker (trade)|hawking]]. Numerous refugee colonies sprang up in [[Nadia district|Nadia]], [[North 24 Parganas district|24 Paraganas]] and [[Kolkata]]'s suburbs.\n\n==== Tripura's tribal insurgency ====\n{{Main|Insurgency in Northeast India#Tripura}}\nThe [[Twipra Kingdom#British Era|princely state of Tripura]] had a predominantly tribal population. But educated Bengalis were welcomed by the King and they were prominent in the state's administration in pre-independence India. But after partition thousands of Bengali Hindus migrated to Tripura. This changed the state's [[demography]] completely. Tripura's tribes became a minority in their own [[homeland]] and also lost their land holdings. As a result, tribal [[insurgency]] began which led violent riots among tribes and Bengalis in 1980. Low scale insurgency continues to this day.<ref>Manorama Yearbook 1998</ref>\n\n=== Economic impact ===\n\n==== West Bengal ====\n[[Radcliffe Line|Radcliffe's line]] split Bengal, which [[History of Bengal|historically]] was always a [[Bengal|single economic zone]], single cultural and ethnic (Bengali-Hindu or Bengali-Muslim) zone, into two-halves. The two-halves were intricately connected with each other. The [[Ganges Delta|fertile East]] produced food and raw materials which the West consumed and the industrialised West produced manufactured goods which were consumed by the East. This mutually beneficial trade and exchange was severely disrupted by the partition. Rail, road and water communication routes were severed between the two. After partition West Bengal suffered from a substantial food shortage as the fertile [[Rice paddy|rice]] producing districts of Bengal went to the eastern half. The shortage continued throughout the 1950s and 1960s. By 1959, West Bengal faced an annual food shortage of 950,000 tones. Hunger marches became a common sight in Kolkata.{{Chatterji|2007|pp=244\u2013245}}\n[[File:Prafullachandra Ghosh & Msd Ali at Writers' Building in 1947.jpg|thumb|[[Prafulla Chandra Ghosh]] (left), the first chief minister of West Bengal, with [[Mohammad Ali of Bogra]]]]\n[[Jute]] was the largest industry in Bengal at the time of partition. Radcliffe's line left every single jute mill in West Bengal but four fifth of the jute producing land in East Bengal. The [[Jute#Tossa jute (Corchorus olitorius)|best quality fibre yielding breeds]] of jute were [[Jute cultivation|cultivated]] mostly in East Bengal. India and Pakistan initially went into a [[trade agreement]] to import raw jute from East Bengal for West Bengal's mills. However, Pakistan had plans to set up its own mills and put restrictions on raw jute export to India. West Bengal's mills faced acute shortage. The industry faced a crisis.{{sfn|Chatterji|2007|p=240}} On the other hand, jute farmers in East Bengal were now without a market to sell their produce. Jute export to West Bengal suddenly became an anti-national act for Pakistan. Smuggling of raw jute shot up across the border.{{sfn|Schendel|2005|pp=158-159}} However West Bengal rapidly increased jute production and by mid-to-late 1950s became largely self-sufficient in jute.<ref name=\"faostat.fao.org\">[http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=567#ancor FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS]</ref> West Bengal's mills became less dependent on East Bengal for raw material. Pakistan also set up new [[Adamjee Jute Mills|factories]] to process its local produce instead of exporting to India.{{sfn|Schendel|2005|p=159}} The following table shows jute production details in two countries in 1961.<ref name=\"faostat.fao.org\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The paper mills used East Bengal's [[Bamboo]] and the tanneries consumed leather, also mainly produced in East Bengal. Like jute, lack of raw material pushed these two industries into decline.{{sfn|Chatterji|2007|pp=241-242}}\n\nDespite [[Government of India|center]] and [[Government of West Bengal|state governments']] best efforts, the pressure of millions of refugees, food shortages and [[deindustrialization|industrial decline]] put post-independence West Bengal in a severe crisis. [[Bidhan Chandra Roy|Dr. B. C. Roy]]'s government tried to cope up with the situation by initiating several projects. The government built [[Irrigation|irrigation networks]] like [[Damodar Valley Corporation|DVC]] and [[Mayurakshi River|Mayurakshi]] project, the [[Durgapur Steel Plant|Durgapur industrial zone]] and the [[Bidhannagar, Kolkata|Salt Lake City]]. But these failed to arrest West Bengal's decline. Poverty rose. West Bengal lost its top place and lagged well behind other Indian states in industrial development. Massive political unrest, strikes and violence crippled the state throughout the next three decade after partition.{{sfn|Chatterji|2007}}\n\n==== North East India ====\nRail and road links connecting [[North East India]] to the rest of the country passed through East Bengal territory. The lines connecting [[Siliguri]] in [[North Bengal]] to Kolkata and Assam to [[Chittagong]] were severed. The whole [[Bengal Assam Railway|Assam Railway]] was cut off from the rest of the [[Indian Railways|Indian system]].<ref name=\"History of Indian railways\">[http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-history4.html History of Indian railways]</ref> These lines carried almost all [[freight]] traffic from these regions. The most important commodities were tea and timber. The [[Assam tea|tea industry in Assam]] depended on the [[Chittagong port]] to export its produce and import raw materials for the industry such as coal which was used as the fuel to [[Tea processing|dry]] the [[tea leaves]]. The industry was severely hit as Chittagong port went to Pakistan. Initially India and Pakistan reached an agreement to allow cross border transit traffic but now India had to pay a [[tariff]]. By 1950, India reconnected Assam to the rest of the country's rail network by building a 229&nbsp;km [[meter gauge]] rail link through the [[Siliguri Corridor]].<ref name=\"History of Indian railways\"/> But now the Tea chests from Assam's [[Tea garden (cultivation)|gardens]] would have to be carried over a much longer distance to reach the [[Port of Kolkata|Kolkata port]]. Exporting tea via the nearby Chittagong port was still an option but after [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965's war]] all transit traffic was switched off by Pakistan.{{sfn|Schendel|2005|p=150}}\n\nEast Pakistan became independent Bangladesh in 1971 but cross border railway traffic did not resume until 2003. By the 1990s, India upgraded the Assam rail link to [[Indian gauge|broad gauge]] right up to [[Dibrugarh]] thereby easing the traffic problem in [[Brahmaputra]] [[Brahmaputra Valley|valley]] region, but the southern section of this area which comprises Tripura, [[Mizoram]], Manipur and [[Barak valley]] of Assam still faces serious [[Transport|connectivity]] problem. Talks between the two countries are currently underway to allow transit traffic between this area and mainland India through Bangladesh.\n\n==== East Bengal ====\n[[File:Khawaja Nazimuddin of Pakistan.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Sir Khawaja Nazimuddin]], the first chief minister of East Bengal]]\nAt the time of partition, East Bengal had no large industry. There were few mineral resources in this region. Its economy was completely agrarian. The main produce was food grains and other crops, jute, [[bamboo]], leather and [[Fishery|fish]]. These raw materials were consumed by factories in and around Kolkata. Kolkata was the center of Bengal's economic and social development for both Hindus and Muslims. All large industries, military bases, government offices and most of the institutions of higher education were situated in Kolkata.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Without Kolkata, East Bengal was decapitated.{{sfn|Jalal|1994|p=3|ps=: \"Stripped of Calcutta and western Bengal, eastern Bengal was reduced to the status of an over-populated rural slum.\"}} It lost its traditional market for agricultural products. It also lost the Kolkata port, the premium port of the whole country at that time. East Bengal had to begin from nothing. [[Dhaka]] at that time was only a district headquarters. Government offices had to be placed inside makeshift buildings. Dhaka also faced a severe human resource crisis. The majority of high-ranking officers in British Indian administration were Hindu and they migrated to West Bengal. Often these posts had to be filled up by West Pakistani officers. Desperately poor, East Bengal soon became politically dominated by West Pakistan. [[Urdu]] was [[Bengali Language Movement|imposed]] upon the whole country. Economic disparities and subjugation of Bengalis by the [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] elite eventually led to struggle for separation.\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n''[[Chinnamul]]'' (The Uprooted) a 1950 [[Bengali language|Bengali]] film directed by   [[Nemai Ghosh (director)|Nemai Ghosh]], first dealt with the theme of partition of Bengal.

The new route also takes advantage of the faster speed of signal travel that is possible through air (compared to signal travel speed through glass fibers, which slows light down).

Ferguson was in charge of Manchester United from November 1986 until his retirement at the end of the 2012\u201313 season, meaning he was manager for the last five years of the old Football League First Division and all of the first 21 seasons of the Premier League.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/managers/longest-current.html |title=Longest serving managers |publisher=League Managers Association |accessdate=14 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207195645/http://www.leaguemanagers.com/managers/longest-current.html |archivedate=7 February 2015 |df=}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2019\u201320 season, 6 managers have been sacked as of 28 December: [[Javi Gracia]] and [[Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores]] of [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], [[Mauricio Pochettino]] of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], [[Unai Emery]] of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Marco Silva]] of [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[Manuel Pellegrini]] of [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].\n\nThere have been several studies into the reasoning behind, and effects of, managerial sackings. Most famously, Professor Sue Bridgewater of the [[University of Liverpool]] and Dr. Bas ter Weel of the [[University of Amsterdam]], performed two separate studies which helped to explain the statistics behind managerial sackings. Bridgewater's study found clubs generally sack their managers upon dropping below an average of one point per match.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/us/features/soccernomics-does-sacking-manager-actually-make-difference |title=Soccernomics: Does sacking the manager actually make a difference? |date=13 March 2016 |work=FourFourTwo|access-date=14 December 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alex Ferguson.jpg|thumb|upright|Former Manchester United manager [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] was the longest serving and most successful manager in Premier League history.|alt=The torso and head of a grey-haired white man in a football stadium.

Ferguson was in charge of Manchester United from November 1986 until his retirement at the end of the 2012\u201313 season, meaning he was manager for the last five years of the old Football League First Division and all of the first 21 seasons of the Premier League.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/managers/longest-current.html |title=Longest serving managers |publisher=League Managers Association |accessdate=14 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207195645/http://www.leaguemanagers.com/managers/longest-current.html |archivedate=7 February 2015 |df=}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2019\u201320 season, 6 managers have been sacked as of 28 December: [[Javi Gracia]] and [[Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores]] of [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], [[Mauricio Pochettino]] of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], [[Unai Emery]] of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Marco Silva]] of [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[Manuel Pellegrini]] of [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].\n\nThere have been several studies into the reasoning behind, and effects of, managerial sackings. Most famously, Professor Sue Bridgewater of the [[University of Liverpool]] and Dr. Bas ter Weel of the [[University of Amsterdam]], performed two separate studies which helped to explain the statistics behind managerial sackings. Bridgewater's study found clubs generally sack their managers upon dropping below an average of one point per match.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/us/features/soccernomics-does-sacking-manager-actually-make-difference |title=Soccernomics: Does sacking the manager actually make a difference? |date=13 March 2016 |work=FourFourTwo|access-date=14 December 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alex Ferguson.jpg|thumb|upright|Former Manchester United manager [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] was the longest serving and most successful manager in Premier League history.|alt=The torso and head of a grey-haired white man in a football stadium.

The United States' support for the SANG has been delivered both through private contractors and the [[U.S. army]]'s [[Office of the Program Manager, Saudi Arabian National Guard Modernization Program]].\n\n==History==\n[[File: A member of the 1st Battalion, 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment, explains the M252 81mm mortar to Saudi Arabian national guardsmen.JPEG|thumb|Saudi Arabian National Guard training during the [[First Gulf War]].]]\n[[File:Saudi soldiers, Mecca, 1979.JPG|thumb|SANG and Saudi soldiers during the Grand mosque seizure, 1979]]\n\nThe SANG was founded as the successor to the [[Ikhwan]], the tribal army of [[Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud|King Abdulaziz]]. The Ikhwan had helped King Abdulaziz conquer the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and take it from the [[Hashimites]] in [[World War&nbsp;I]]. However, the Ikhwan committed many excesses and atrocities not just on The [[Kingdom of Hejaz|Hejazi army]] but on other Arabs as well. The various tribal groups of the Ikhwan also had a tendency to go off and do their own things and thus needed to be brought under a more centralised control. The SANG acquired its moniker of the \"White Army\" during this period due to its wearing of traditional Arab dress instead of Western-style military uniforms. In 1954, the office of Jihad and Mujahidin was transformed into the modern National Guard.<ref name=ash11sep>{{cite news|title=History of the Saudi National Guard|url=http://www.aawsat.net/2006/09/article55265322|access-date=5 April 2013|newspaper=[[Asharq Alawsat]]|date=11 September 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201195800/http://www.aawsat.net/2006/09/article55265322|archive-date=1 February 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nTraining of the National Guard became the responsibility of the US [[Vinnell]] corporation in 1975. About 1,000 United States Vietnam veterans were initially recruited to serve in the long-term training program designed to convert the guard into a mobile and hard-hitting counterinsurgency force that could also reinforce the regular army if necessary. These contractors were supervised by a United States military group with the designation Office of the Program Manager\u2014Saudi Arabian National Guard (OPM-SANG).\n\nExtensive military infrastructure facilities have been built to ensure the comfort and well-being of national guard units. Their major cantonments were in [[Al-Ahsa Oasis]] near [[Al-Hufuf]] and the major oil installations of the [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|Eastern Province]] and at [[Al-Qasim]] in the [[Nejd]], in an area where many of the tribal elements were recruited and most training was conducted. A large new housing project for guard personnel, with associated schools, shops, and mosques, has been constructed near [[Riyadh]], also the site of the guard's military academy, the [[King Khalid Military City|King Khalid Military College]]. Other National Guard military cities were located at [[At-Ta'if]], [[Dammam]], and [[Jeddah]], while a new headquarters complex was built in Riyadh in the early 1980s.\n\nDuring the 1950s and early 1960s, the regular army and the national guard were both small and of roughly equal strength. The guard suffered when the army's expansion was given priority, but in the 1970s the decline was reversed when the guard was converted to a light mechanized force with the help of United States advisers. Initially consisting of four combined arms battalions, the active-duty component had by 1992 been enlarged to two mechanized brigades, each with four infantry battalions, an artillery battalion, and engineering and signals companies. The guard's mobility over desert terrain was assured by 1,100 [[Cadillac Gage Commando|Commando V-150]] armoured cars. Firepower came from 105&nbsp;mm and 155&nbsp;mm towed howitzers, 106&nbsp;mm recoilless rifles, 90mm guns and [[BGM-71 TOW]] platforms.\n\nThe second component of the national guard, made up of tribal battalions under the command of local sheikhs, was organised into four infantry brigades (called the Fowj). These men, often the sons of local chiefs or of veterans of the original Ikhwan forces, reported for duty about once a month for the purpose of receiving stipends. They were provided with [[Heckler & Koch G3]] rifles, although many had individually acquired [[AK-47]]s and other automatic weapons. They also have radios and are equipped with Toyota pickup trucks or Land Rovers. Many units are stationed along the borders of the Kingdom and have the mission to patrol the border areas. Although neither particularly well trained nor well equipped, they could be counted on to be loyal to the House of Saud if called for service. Their enrollment in the guard was largely a means to bolster the subsidies paid to local shaykhs and to retain the support of their tribes.\n\nThe national guard's King Abdulaziz Mechanized Brigade was swiftly deployed to the border area after [[First Gulf War|Iraq's invasion of Kuwait]] in 1990 and was actively engaged in the war, notably in the fighting to retake the town of [[Ra's al Khafji]]. After the war ended, it was reported that an enlargement of the national guard to eleven or twelve active brigades was contemplated. In addition, the ageing Commandos were to be replaced by more than 1,000 eight-wheeled [[LAV-25]]s and  LAV variants manufactured by [[General Motors]] in Canada. The LAVs were to be mounted with a variety of armaments, such as 25&nbsp;mm autocannon, larger-calibre 90&nbsp;mm guns, 120mm mortars and TOW missile launchers.\n\n==Command==\nThe Saudi Arabian National Guard's communications and chain of command maintained a separate network from regular Saudi Arabian military channels with a senior member of the royal family as its head. [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah]] commanded SANG for three decades, from 1962 until 17 November 2010, when he appointed his son, [[Mutaib bin Abdullah|Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah]], as the new commander.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/17/AR2010111704919.html Saudi king transfers National Guard duties to son, 2010/11/17]</ref> In addition, three of his sons hold high positions within the organization. SANG's Deputy Commander was [[Badr bin Abdul Aziz|Prince Badr]] until 2010, who was a senior member of the [[Al&nbsp;Saud]]. Its general headquarters, located in [[Riyadh]], directly controlled the three regional sectors and the training facilities and the King Abdulaziz Independent Mechanized Brigade of four battalions.\n\nThe three regional (eastern, central, and western) sectors each command one or more mechanized or motorized brigades, several independent Security and [[Military Police]] and logistical battalions, but also the irregular ''[[fowj]]'' battalions.\n\n==Structure==\nThe SANG was restructured with the help of the [[Vinnell Corporation]] into a light mechanized force equipped with over a thousand [[Cadillac Gage Commando]] [[armored fighting vehicle]]s (being replaced with [[LAV-25|LAV&#8209;25]]s).

Its duties include protecting the [[House of Saud]], guarding against military coups, guarding strategic facilities and resources, and providing security for the cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]].\n\nIt reports directly to the king through the Minister of the National Guard and, unlike the army, navy and air force, is not under the control of the [[Ministry of Defense (Saudi Arabia)|Ministry of Defense]]. The Guard's command structure and communication network are entirely separate from those of the Ministries of Defense and the Interior.\n\nIts personnel are drawn from tribes loyal to the king and the [[House of Saud|royal family]], whose high-ranking members are always appointed its commander. It has been described as an institution that \"ties the tribes to the House of Saud\" (by [[Sandra Mackey]]).<ref>[[Sandra Mackey|Mackey]], ''The Saudis: Inside the Desert Kingdom'', p. 207.</ref> It also draws recruits from official Wahhabi religious establishment.\n<ref name=bradley-expo-69>{{cite book|last=Bradley|first=John R.|title=Saudi Arabia Exposed : Inside a Kingdom in Crisis|url=https://archive.org/details/saudiarabiaexpos00brad|url-access=registration|date=2005|publisher=Palgrave\n|page=[https://archive.org/details/saudiarabiaexpos00brad/page/69 69]\n|quote=The National Guard, in contrast to the army, has institutionalized and cemented tribal, social, and religious ties in the kingdom because it is made up of young men drawn from the various ranks of the Bedu, tribes, and official Wahhabi religious establishment.

The United States' support for the SANG has been delivered both through private contractors and the [[U.S. army]]'s [[Office of the Program Manager, Saudi Arabian National Guard Modernization Program]].\n\n==History==\n[[File: A member of the 1st Battalion, 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment, explains the M252 81mm mortar to Saudi Arabian national guardsmen.JPEG|thumb|Saudi Arabian National Guard training during the [[First Gulf War]].]]\n[[File:Saudi soldiers, Mecca, 1979.JPG|thumb|SANG and Saudi soldiers during the Grand mosque seizure, 1979]]\n\nThe SANG was founded as the successor to the [[Ikhwan]], the tribal army of [[Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud|King Abdulaziz]]. The Ikhwan had helped King Abdulaziz conquer the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and take it from the [[Hashimites]] in [[World War&nbsp;I]]. However, the Ikhwan committed many excesses and atrocities not just on The [[Kingdom of Hejaz|Hejazi army]] but on other Arabs as well. The various tribal groups of the Ikhwan also had a tendency to go off and do their own things and thus needed to be brought under a more centralised control. The SANG acquired its moniker of the \"White Army\" during this period due to its wearing of traditional Arab dress instead of Western-style military uniforms. In 1954, the office of Jihad and Mujahidin was transformed into the modern National Guard.<ref name=ash11sep>{{cite news|title=History of the Saudi National Guard|url=http://www.aawsat.net/2006/09/article55265322|access-date=5 April 2013|newspaper=[[Asharq Alawsat]]|date=11 September 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201195800/http://www.aawsat.net/2006/09/article55265322|archive-date=1 February 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nTraining of the National Guard became the responsibility of the US [[Vinnell]] corporation in 1975. About 1,000 United States Vietnam veterans were initially recruited to serve in the long-term training program designed to convert the guard into a mobile and hard-hitting counterinsurgency force that could also reinforce the regular army if necessary. These contractors were supervised by a United States military group with the designation Office of the Program Manager\u2014Saudi Arabian National Guard (OPM-SANG).\n\nExtensive military infrastructure facilities have been built to ensure the comfort and well-being of national guard units. Their major cantonments were in [[Al-Ahsa Oasis]] near [[Al-Hufuf]] and the major oil installations of the [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|Eastern Province]] and at [[Al-Qasim]] in the [[Nejd]], in an area where many of the tribal elements were recruited and most training was conducted. A large new housing project for guard personnel, with associated schools, shops, and mosques, has been constructed near [[Riyadh]], also the site of the guard's military academy, the [[King Khalid Military City|King Khalid Military College]]. Other National Guard military cities were located at [[At-Ta'if]], [[Dammam]], and [[Jeddah]], while a new headquarters complex was built in Riyadh in the early 1980s.\n\nDuring the 1950s and early 1960s, the regular army and the national guard were both small and of roughly equal strength. The guard suffered when the army's expansion was given priority, but in the 1970s the decline was reversed when the guard was converted to a light mechanized force with the help of United States advisers. Initially consisting of four combined arms battalions, the active-duty component had by 1992 been enlarged to two mechanized brigades, each with four infantry battalions, an artillery battalion, and engineering and signals companies. The guard's mobility over desert terrain was assured by 1,100 [[Cadillac Gage Commando|Commando V-150]] armoured cars. Firepower came from 105&nbsp;mm and 155&nbsp;mm towed howitzers, 106&nbsp;mm recoilless rifles, 90mm guns and [[BGM-71 TOW]] platforms.\n\nThe second component of the national guard, made up of tribal battalions under the command of local sheikhs, was organised into four infantry brigades (called the Fowj). These men, often the sons of local chiefs or of veterans of the original Ikhwan forces, reported for duty about once a month for the purpose of receiving stipends. They were provided with [[Heckler & Koch G3]] rifles, although many had individually acquired [[AK-47]]s and other automatic weapons. They also have radios and are equipped with Toyota pickup trucks or Land Rovers. Many units are stationed along the borders of the Kingdom and have the mission to patrol the border areas. Although neither particularly well trained nor well equipped, they could be counted on to be loyal to the House of Saud if called for service. Their enrollment in the guard was largely a means to bolster the subsidies paid to local shaykhs and to retain the support of their tribes.\n\nThe national guard's King Abdulaziz Mechanized Brigade was swiftly deployed to the border area after [[First Gulf War|Iraq's invasion of Kuwait]] in 1990 and was actively engaged in the war, notably in the fighting to retake the town of [[Ra's al Khafji]]. After the war ended, it was reported that an enlargement of the national guard to eleven or twelve active brigades was contemplated. In addition, the ageing Commandos were to be replaced by more than 1,000 eight-wheeled [[LAV-25]]s and  LAV variants manufactured by [[General Motors]] in Canada. The LAVs were to be mounted with a variety of armaments, such as 25&nbsp;mm autocannon, larger-calibre 90&nbsp;mm guns, 120mm mortars and TOW missile launchers.\n\n==Command==\nThe Saudi Arabian National Guard's communications and chain of command maintained a separate network from regular Saudi Arabian military channels with a senior member of the royal family as its head. [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah]] commanded SANG for three decades, from 1962 until 17 November 2010, when he appointed his son, [[Mutaib bin Abdullah|Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah]], as the new commander.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/17/AR2010111704919.html Saudi king transfers National Guard duties to son, 2010/11/17]</ref> In addition, three of his sons hold high positions within the organization. SANG's Deputy Commander was [[Badr bin Abdul Aziz|Prince Badr]] until 2010, who was a senior member of the [[Al&nbsp;Saud]]. Its general headquarters, located in [[Riyadh]], directly controlled the three regional sectors and the training facilities and the King Abdulaziz Independent Mechanized Brigade of four battalions.\n\nThe three regional (eastern, central, and western) sectors each command one or more mechanized or motorized brigades, several independent Security and [[Military Police]] and logistical battalions, but also the irregular ''[[fowj]]'' battalions.\n\n==Structure==\nThe SANG was restructured with the help of the [[Vinnell Corporation]] into a light mechanized force equipped with over a thousand [[Cadillac Gage Commando]] [[armored fighting vehicle]]s (being replaced with [[LAV-25|LAV&#8209;25]]s). Its mobile force consisted of three mechanized brigades and five motorized infantry brigades. The [[militia]] portion consists of around 24&nbsp;battalions of ''[[fowj]]'', tribal warriors on \"retainer\".\n\n==Brigades==\nThe eight SANG brigades include:\n* Imam Muhammad bin Saud Mechanized Brigade (IMBSMB) the first of two mechanized brigades created in the late 1970s with Cadillac-Gage V-150 vehicles. These were replaced in the 1990s by the more-capable LAV series of tactical vehicles. \n* Prince Saad Abdulrahman Mechanized Brigade (PSARMB)was formed in the late 1990s and equipped with LAV series of tactical vehicles\n* Prince Turki bin Abdulaziz Mechanized Brigade (PTAMB) was formed by 2006 and equipped with LAV series of tactical vehicles\n* King Khalid Light Infantry Brigade\u2019s strength is unknown\n* King Abdulaziz Mechanized Brigade (KAAMB), the second of the original mechanized brigades formed in the late 1970s with Cadillac-Gage V-150 vehicles.

Both are private, Catholic academic institutions within the Metropolitan Manila area. The Ateneo men's varsity team is known as the [[Ateneo Blue Eagles]], women's varsity team as the [[Ateneo Lady Eagles volleyball team|Ateneo Lady Eagles]], and high school team as the Ateneo Blue Eaglets. The De La Salle men's varsity team is known as the [[De La Salle Green Archers]], women's varsity team as the [[DLSU Lady Spikers|DLSU Lady Archers/Spikers]], and high school team as the [[DLSZ Junior Archers]].\n\n==History==\nDe La Salle and Ateneo were both co-founders of the pre-war NCAA but actively compete in the UAAP. The historied rivalry began when Ateneo lost to De La Salle in a hotly contested championship basketball game during the 16th NCAA Season (1939\u201340). Basketball games between Ateneo and La Salle in the NCAA were always hard fought but was not yet tagged by the local sportswriters as the recognized rivalry. The more popular collegiate sports rivalries was between Ateneo versus San Beda, and De La Salle versus Letran. The rivalry between De La Salle vs Ateneo then was mostly based on their academic performance, debate, social status, prestige and school pride. When Ateneo and De La Salle transferred to the UAAP in 1978 and 1986 respectively, they continued their fierce battles and innate animosity against each other on and off court. The sports press showed interest and wrote about the school rivalry that always caught the attention of sports loving fans. The basketball games between De La Salle and Ateneo are the most anticipated battles in every UAAP season year after year. A Green Archer versus Blue Eagle fray would always draw huge, loyal crowds of fanatical students, school faculty and officials, notable and influential alumni, actors and actresses, musicians, business tycoons, high government officials such as cabinet members, senators, congressmen, justices of the Supreme Court, former Presidents of the Philippines, and several notable people of great influence in Philippine society. Several Ambassadors of the United States of America would gamely attend and watch a De La Salle vs Ateneo basketball game year after year.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://humblebola.com/the-rewind-the-past-present-and-future-of-ateneo-la-salle/|title=THE REWIND: THE PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE OF ATENEO-LA SALLE|work=Humblebola|access-date=January 6, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.esquiremag.ph/culture/a-brief-history-of-the-ateneo-la-salle-rivalry-a1993-20170911-lfrm2|title=A Brief History of the Ateneo vs De La Salle rivalry|work=Esquire|access-date=January 25, 2020}}</ref> The rivalry started out with the men's basketball games and has since expanded to other sports, particularly in women's volleyball where both teams fought head-to-head in the UAAP Finals for six consecutive times from 2012 to 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.foxsports.ph/volleyball/uaap-volleyball/1057045/defining-the-2010s-lady-spikers-dynastic-rule-in-the-uaap/|title=Defining the 2010s: Lady Spikers\u2019 dynastic rule in the UAAP|work=Fox Sports|access-date=January 6, 2020}}</ref> Both universities have also extended their rivalry beyond sports and have gone into their various fields of academic achievements, accomplishments, expertise and contributions to the upliftment of the Philippines.\n\nFrom 1924 to 1925, basketball games between Ateneo and De La Salle were played at an open basketball court at the Padre Faura, Ermita campus of UP and in 1926 at the Nozaleda Park (now called Agrifina Circle which is part of Luneta Park). The venue later moved to the covered courts of the US Army's 31st Infantry Gym and UST Gym.<ref>Suva GT: NCAA 25th Anniversary Souvenir Program, San Juan, Rizal: JCP Publishing, 1949</ref> The games then moved to the pre-war Rizal Memorial Coliseum to accommodate bigger crowds, and at one point, the venues included the Ateneo Loyola Center, the Cuneta Astrodome, the PhilSports Arena. Currently, the Smart Araneta Coliseum and the SM Mall of Asia Arena are the present main venues for their sold out games. Both the De La Salle and Ateneo games have an ever increasing loyal fan base that provides very high TV ratings that increases the commercial value of the UAAP brand year after year.\n\n==Head-to-head records by sport==\n\n===Seniors' division===\nPresently, the [[De La Salle Green Archers]] have more collegiate championships compared to the [[Ateneo Blue Eagles]] in the NCAA<ref name=\"Championships\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.org.ph/|title=\u2013 Championships|access-date=August 24, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605063046/http://www.ncaa.org.ph/|archive-date=June 5, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and UAAP combined in both men's and women's divisions.

The [[Collegiate Champions League]] (CCL), was then reformatted and became the [[Philippine Collegiate Championship League]] (PCCL). It is currently the national collegiate basketball championship tournament, sanctioned by the [[Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas]], the country's official basketball federation. College teams from all over the country participate in the tournament. The tournament also has a Sweet 16 similar to the United States' NCAA Basketball Tournament during \"March Madness.\"\n\nThe Green Archers won the 2008 PCCL title. La Salle defeated the second-seeded NCAA champion [[San Beda Red Lions]] and arranged a finals meeting with the top-seeded UAAP champion Ateneo Blue Eagles, who defeated the [[Letran Knights]] in the Final Four. In the championship match, the [[De La Salle Green Archers]] prevailed over the [[Ateneo Blue Eagles]], 71\u201362.\n\nIn the 2009 season of the Philippine Collegiate Championship League, the Blue Eagles defeated the FEU Tamaraws in three games to clinch their second national title, whereas the Green Archers were eliminated by the Letran Knights in their first game in the round of 16. In the 2010 season, the Blue Eagles defeated the Adamson Falcons in three games to clinch their third and back-to-back national titles, while the Green Archers settled for 3rd-place beating the UC Webmasters despite having 4 players injured and only 10 players intact in the line-up.\n\nIn the 2013 season of the Philippine Collegiate Championship League, the Green Archers defeated the South Western University Cobras, via sweep to reclaim the national championship for the first time since 2008 and winning their second title in the tournament.\n\nIn the 2018 season of the Philippine Collegiate Championship League, the Blue Eagles defeated the University of Visayas Green Lancers, 95\u201371 to reclaim the national championship for the first time since 2010 and winning their fourth title in the tournament.

They currently hold the distinction of having the longest UAAP basketball title streak in the Final Four era after winning five straight times from 2008 to 2012. In 2019, Ateneo achieved another 3-peat and became the first team in the UAAP Final Four era to finish an entire season (including the finals) without a single loss (16\u20130) in the [[UAAP Season 82]] men's basketball tournament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/11/20/19/sweep-16-ateneo-wins-uaap-82-title-in-historic-fashion|title=Sweep 16!

The Ateneo Blue Eagles still have the most number of double titles in NCAA history, with four double championships, including the NCAA's second back-to-back double championships in 1975 and 1976 (the first was accomplished by the University of the Philippines in 1925 and 1926).\n\nAteneo holds the distinction of being the only double 3-peat champion in the senior and junior levels whether in the NCAA or UAAP, from 2008 to 2010, and has posted two 4-peats and three back-to-back title streaks in the UAAP juniors' division.\n\nLa Salle does not have any such streaks in the NCAA, but won back-to-back titles once in 1989 and 1990, and also posted a rare 4-peat in UAAP men's basketball from [[UAAP Season 61|1998]] to [[UAAP Season 64|2001]]. La Salle accomplished the double championship once during its stint in the NCAA (1939) and UAAP (2007).\n\nThe Lady Archers also achieved a 4-peat of their own from 1999 to 2002 which was the longest UAAP women's basketball championship streak in the Final Four era, until the NU Lady Bulldogs achieved their fifth consecutive championship in 2018.\n\nLa Salle holds the distinction of being the first and only school to be 3-peat UAAP basketball champions in both men's and women's divisions in the same period, from 1999 to 2001. In 2013, La Salle were champions in both divisions again in the [[UAAP Season 76 basketball tournaments]].\n\n===NCAA===\nIn 1939, La Salle defeated Ateneo in both the Seniors and Juniors NCAA Championship.

Another finals meeting of both schools took place in 1974 with La Salle prevailing over Ateneo in the championship.

La Salle won back-to-back titles in 1989 and 1990, and won four straight titles from 1998 to 2001, with La Salle beating Ateneo in the 2001 Finals, capping its 4-peat title run. Ateneo subsequently defeated La Salle in the 2002 championship to end its 14-year title drought. In 2003, Ateneo eliminated La Salle in the semifinals, breaking a streak of La Salle appearances in the UAAP Finals. La Salle won the 2004 title after eliminating Ateneo in the semifinals, but was stripped of the title when they were suspended for fielding two ineligible players. La Salle swept the UE Red Warriors to win the 2007 title after the suspension, a season that saw them meet the Blue Eagles five times, lose thrice, but win two crucial games including the one that paved the way for a Finals appearance. Ateneo defeated La Salle in all four encounters in 2008, including the Finals, thereby dethroning DLSU. Ateneo then went on to win all matches against La Salle on the way to winning a running total of five consecutive UAAP titles, except for a lone La Salle victory in the first round of eliminations in 2010. In 2012, the two teams met in a Final Four encounter, where the Blue Eagles defeated the Green Archers, eliminating La Salle from contention. With its 2012 title victory, Ateneo broke its deadlock of UAAP titles with La Salle and exceeded La Salle's championship streak with the longest in the Final Four era, and now has the longest held by only one UAAP school. Ateneo failed to enter the Final Four in 2013 while La Salle won the title for the first time since 2007. Both teams failed to enter the Finals in 2014. In 2015, both teams failed once again to enter the Finals with La Salle missing the Final Four for the first time since 2011, while Ateneo made it to the semifinals but lost to the eventual champions FEU Tamaraws, who also ousted La Salle in their last game (a game in which La Salle needed to win to stay in contention and force a knockout match) for the last Final Four slot in which enabled the erstwhile defending champions NU Bulldogs to grab the #4 position in the playoffs. In 2016 both teams met in the Finals for the first time since 2008 with both schools taking the Top 2 spots at the end of the elimination rounds and having the twice to beat advantage, with La Salle outlasting Adamson in one game, while Ateneo used their twice to beat advantage to take out the defending champions FEU Tamaraws in a hard-fought series with Ateneo winning the second game in an overtime thriller in which both teams did not score more than five points in the extra period. In the Finals the Green Archers swept the Blue Eagles to win their 9th title and break the tie among them for the number of UAAP titles. In 2017, both Ateneo and La Salle met once again in the Finals and the first back-to-back Ateneo\u2013La Salle Finals series since 2002 with Ateneo winning this time in 3 full games that ended their 5-year title drought and dethroning La Salle in the process.\n\n'''2001 Finals: La Salle 4-peat'''<br />\n{|class=wikitable align=right\n|-\n!Game !!

With these conditions, the first Ateneo\u2013La Salle game came at the heels of former [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Corazon Aquino]]'s death, and as a result, spectators wore yellow as a sign for respect for Aquino. Ateneo outlasted La Salle in overtime to end the first round with a solitary loss. The two teams met a week later, but this time Ateneo had a big enough lead to prevent La Salle from catching up. Ateneo qualified for the semifinals as the No. 1 seed, eventually winning the championship; La Salle missed out on the Final Four on the final day after being defeated by NU. The 2009 season would be the first time Ateneo and La Salle would not meet in the playoffs since 2001, not including their Finals encounter in 2008 and the DLSU suspension in 2006.\n\nIn 2010, parading some new players and an improved set of veterans, the Green Archers defeated the Blue Eagles, 66\u201363, with the Blue Eagles still feeling the loss of three of the previous season's starters and sophomore guard Sam Marata shooting hot in the end game. This was the first official win of the Green Archers against the Blue Eagles in UAAP action since 2007.  In the second round encounter, the Ateneo Blue Eagles were threatened with falling into a tie in the standings had they lost to DLSU. After falling behind 4\u20139, the Blue Eagles went on a 10\u20130 scoring run to take a double digit lead, and went on to defeat the Archers decisively, 74\u201357.\n\n2010 was the second straight year that Ateneo and DLSU would not meet in a post eliminations series. DLSU managed to reach the Final Four after missing it in the previous season, but fell to the top-seeded FEU Tamaraws in overtime. The Blue Eagles defeated the Adamson Falcons in the Final Four, and went on to sweep the Tamaraws for their third consecutive title despite not having any player in the Mythical Team.\n\nIn 2011, the Ateneo Blue Eagles team headlined by two rookies defeated DLSU again in both of their elimination matches. It is also the third straight year that Ateneo and DLSU would not meet in a post elimination series, since the DLSU Green Archers failed to qualify once again for the Final Four. The Ateneo Blue Eagles were the top-seeded team in the semifinals and defeated the UST Growling Tigers in one game. The Blue Eagles then proceeded to sweep the Finals series against the FEU Tamaraws, thus achieving its own four-peat.\n\nPrior to the start of the 2012 season, Norman Black announced that this would be his last season as head coach of the Ateneo. La Salle, on the other hand, had a rookie coach in Gee Abanilla. The two schools met thrice that season- twice in the elimination and once in the semi-finals with Ateneo winning all of the games. A few days prior to the Final 4 match between Ateneo and La Salle, the Blue Eagle's patron, Manny Pangilinan, announced that he would be pulling out his support from the school. Despite the controversy, Ateneo eventually won its fifth consecutive title, sweeping UST in the Finals.\n\n'''2013: The End of an Era for Ateneo'''\n\nUpon the departure of Norman Black, [[Bo Perasol|Dolreich \"Bo\" Perasol]], a former member of the [[UP Fighting Maroons|University of the Philippines men's basketball team]] and a seasoned [[Philippine Basketball Association]] head coach, was tapped by Ateneo as head coach of the Blue Eagles. The entry of Perasol, who was rumored to be tapped as team consultant of the UP Fighting Maroons prior to his appointment as Ateneo head coach, also heralded the return of Manny Pangilinan as the Blue Eagles' main patron. Joining Ateneo men's basketball team was Filipino-American forward Chris Newsome.\n\nOver at La Salle, a series of reshuffles within and outside of the team resulted to the appointment of then assistant coach Juno Sauler as the head coach of the Green Archers. Joining the De La Salle Green Archers coaching staff prior to the start of the 2013\u20132014 UAAP season was Allan Caidic, who took on the chores of shooting coach. Filipino-American forwards Jason Perkins and Matthew Salem became a part of team roster, which had to adjust to the loss of resident players Yutien Andrada, Mac Tallo, Fonzo Gotladera and Papot Paredes.\n\nFor the first time since 2005, La Salle was able to sweep Ateneo during the elimination round. During their first round meeting at the Mall of Asia Arena last July 7, 2013, the Green Archers, banking on the heroics of combo guard Almond Vosotros and center Arnold Van Opstal, defeated the Blue Eagles, 82\u201373, resulting to Ateneo's third straight loss to start the season. The second round meeting, which was held at the Araneta Coliseum last September 1, 2013, was tightly contested by Ateneo and La Salle, with the Green Archers winning over the Blue Eagles, 66\u201364, after sophomore forward Jeron Teng sank a floater with only two seconds left in the shot clock.\n\nToward the end of the second round Ateneo-La Salle game, Perasol was involved in a scuffle with JJ Atayde, an alumnus of La Salle, after the former got irked with the latter's heckling. The incident caused the UAAP Board to penalize Perasol with a one-game suspension and Atayde with a season-wide ban from watching games. Controversy further ensued after Perasol violated his one-game suspension by watching from inside the Ateneo dugout during the Blue Eagles' September 8, 2013 game against the UE Red Warriors, forcing UE team officials to file an inquiry before the UAAP Board. The UAAP Board acted on UE's request for an inquiry, ordering Perasol to serve his one-game suspension during Ateneo's September 18, 2013 game against the [[UST Growling Tigers]].\n\nAteneo, with Perasol serving his one-game suspension, was eventually defeated by UST, 74\u201382, causing the Blue Eagles to not only be dethroned as UAAP Men's Basketball Champions after five straight seasons but to also miss Final Four contention for the first time since 1998.\n\nLa Salle, after a disastrous 3\u20134 finish during the first round of elimination games, swept the second round and ended the elimination round at 10\u20134, forcing a three-way tie for the top spot alongside the [[NU Bulldogs]] and the [[FEU Tamaraws]]. Due to having the highest quotient, NU took the Number One spot with twice-to-beat advantage and faced the UST in the Final Four, with the Growling Tigers defeating the Bulldogs in two games. On the other hand, La Salle and FEU faced each other twice, the first meeting being a rubber match game for the Number Two spot and the twice-to-beat advantage and the second being the formal Final Four game, with the Green Archers winning on both occasions and entering the Finals for the first time since [[UAAP Season 71]]. During the finals series, La Salle defeated UST in three games to win the [[UAAP Season 76]] men's basketball championship title.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://sports.inquirer.net/124063/la-salle-beats-ust-in-overtime-for-uaap-title|title= La Salle rallies past UST in OT to win UAAP title|work=Inquirer|access-date=January 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n'''2016 Finals: Mayhem'''\n{|class=wikitable align=right\n|-\n!Game !!

And a similar rivalry, although on much lesser scale, currently exists. When [[La Salle Green Hills]] used to be the juniors' team of the Green Archers in the NCAA though, the rivalry between the Ateneo and La Salle in the high school level was much stronger, considering that both the [[Ateneo de Manila University#High School|Ateneo High School]] and the [[La Salle Green Hills#High School|LSGH High School]] are all-male schools, igniting a huge rumble in 1978. But this rivalry has since faded, with AHS being in the UAAP and LSGH staying in the NCAA. Still, the remnants of this rivalry live on in the UAAP with LSGH's sister school [[De La Salle-Santiago Zobel School]], the juniors representative of De La Salle University in the UAAP, taking its place.\n\nIn juniors' basketball, Ateneo has 11 NCAA titles and 19 UAAP titles, for a total of 30, whereas La Salle has 6 NCAA titles and 2 UAAP titles, for 8 in total.\n\nLa Salle Greenies defeated the Ateneo Blue Eaglets in the 1939 NCAA Junior Championship.

The Blue Eaglet Spikers won championship titles in NCAA Seasons 43, 45, and 48, and were 3-peat champions from Seasons 50 to 52. The De La Salle Junior Spikers won 7 championship titles under their membership stint in the NCAA which included a 4-peat championship streak along with the Green Spikers from Seasons 53 to 56. In the UAAP, they were 6-peat champions in the boys' division from Seasons 57 to 62, and have also won the title in Season 66. The Junior Lady Spikers were 5-peat champions from UAAP Seasons 57 to 61, and were 3-peat champions from Seasons 73 to 75.

On the other hand, the Ateneo Lady Eagles, consistently ranked second throughout much of the elimination round, defeated the third-seeded (and [[UAAP Season 73 volleyball tournaments|previous season's]] runner-up) [[UST Growling Tigers|UST Tigresses]] in the semifinals, and entered the finals for the first time since Ateneo De Manila University's 1978 admission into the UAAP.\n\nThe De La Salle Lady Spikers defeated the Ateneo Lady Eagles in three games to win their 7th UAAP women's volleyball championship title. Game One of the Finals was won by Ateneo in four sets but Games Two and Three of the series were won by La Salle, with the DLSU Lady Spikers beating the Ateneo Lady Spikers in four sets during Game Two and in three sets during Game Three.

The Lady Spikers posed a comeback win over the Lady Eagles in five sets, 20\u201325, 17\u201325, 25\u201322, 25\u201322, 15\u20136.\n\nPrior to Game Two of the finals, held at the [[Mall of Asia Arena]] on March 6, 2013, team captain [[Aby Mara\u00f1o|Abigail Mara\u00f1o]] and teammate [[Victonara Galang]] were named co-Most Valuable Players (MVPs) of the Season. With the game attended by 18,779 paying patrons, La Salle swept Ateneo in Game Two, 25\u201323, 25\u201320, 25\u201316, to finish the series in two games and win their third consecutive (and 8th overall) UAAP women's volleyball championship title. Then-graduating La Salle player [[Michele Gumabao]] was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals.<ref>http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/298005/sports/campussports/uaap-dlsu-defeats-ateneo-for-the-women-s-volleyball-crown-completes-3-peat</ref><ref>https://www.philstar.com/sports/2013/03/06/916692/la-salle-blazes-way-uaap-womens-volleyball-three-peat</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 76 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the third time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 76 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 76 women's volleyball finals]]. The De La Salle Lady Spikers automatically entered the finals with a thrice-to-beat advantage after sweeping the elimination round. On the other hand, the Ateneo Lady Eagles, under new head coach Anusorn \"Tai\" Bundit, were able to reach the finals after winning knockout matches against fourth-seeded Adamson Lady Falcons and then second-seeded, twice-to-beat NU Lady Bulldogs under the stepladder format.\n\nGame One of the Finals, which was held on March 5, 2014, was won by Ateneo in four sets, 17\u201325, 25\u201323, 25\u201313, 25\u201320. Three days later, on March 8, 2014, La Salle bounced back in Game Two and defeated Ateneo in four sets, 25\u201314, 25\u201320, 19\u201325, 26\u201324. The first two games of the Finals were held at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]].\n\nThe venue of the remaining games of the Finals shifted from the Smart Araneta Coliseum to the [[Mall of Asia Arena]]. In Game Three, which was held on March 12, 2014, Ateneo defeated La Salle in five sets in front of the 18,095-strong crowd, 25\u201321, 25\u201323, 18\u201325, 16\u201325, 17\u201315, to force a winner-take-all title match on March 15, 2014. As a result, the UAAP Season 76 women's volleyball finals series became the league's longest championship series in any sport, and the first to last up to four games (in a best-of-five finals series format with a 1\u20130 advantage for any team). In Game Four, the Ateneo Lady Eagles swept the De La Salle Lady Spikers, 25\u201323, 26\u201324, 25\u201321, to deny La Salle's second overall four-peat championship bid and win their first UAAP women's volleyball championship title at the Mall of Asia Arena after a 21,314-strong audience.\n\nAteneo's team captain [[Alyssa Valdez]] was named as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season and of the Finals, and became the first UAAP athlete to win at least 4 awards in a single season (including awards for the Season's Best Scorer and Best Server categories).<ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/53094-ateneo-upsets-de-la-salle-wins-first-uaap-volleyball-crown</ref><ref>https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/content/353812/united-they-fly-how-the-admu-lady-eagles-became-uaap-vball-champs/story/</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 77 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the fourth time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 77 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 77 women's volleyball finals]]. For the first time in UAAP history, the Ateneo Lady Eagles defeated the De La Salle Lady Spikers twice during the elimination rounds, and entered the finals with the thrice-to-beat advantage after amassing a 14\u20130 eliminations sweeps record. On the other hand, the second-seeded De La Salle Lady Spikers suffered their first defeat from a non-Ateneo team in the tournament (since UST Tigresses' shocking five-set season-opening win against DLSU in Season 75) during Game One against the third-seeded NU Lady Bulldogs in the semifinals (in straight sets), but recovered in Game Two in four sets at the expense of then La Salle's Team Captain Victonara Galang's post-season injury (which sidelined her from playing for Season 77 Finals).\n\nGame One of the Finals, which was held on March 11, 2015 at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]] in front of 18,363 fans, was won by Ateneo in straight sets, 25\u201318, 25\u201319, 25\u201319. Three days later, on March 14, 2015, watched by 20,705 fans at the [[Mall of Asia Arena]], Ateneo swept La Salle again in straight sets, 25\u201322, 25\u201317, 25\u201323, becoming the league's first ever overall volleyball varsity team to achieve a 16\u20130 perfect season (eliminations round up to the championship series) record and defeated La Salle for the second consecutive season to win the UAAP Season 77 volleyball championship title. Ateneo team captain [[Alyssa Valdez]] was named back-to-back Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season, while [[Amy Ahomiro]] won the award as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals.<ref>http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/content/452461/uaap-ateneo-shuts-out-la-salle-for-perfect-season-wins-second-straight-women-s-volleyball-title/story/?ref=related_stories</ref><ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/admu/86845-ateneo-sweeps-season-repeat-uaap-volleyball-champion</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 78 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the fifth time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 78 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 78 women's volleyball finals]]. During the first round of the eliminations, the eventually second-seeded DLSU Lady Spikers swept the season's top-seeded ADMU Lady Eagles in three straight sets to deny them a sweep of the elimination round and revert the tournament to a [[UAAP Final Four|Regular Final Four]] format for the first time since Season 75. In the second round, however, Ateneo recovered in a five-set comeback win to seal their top-seed position. After the eliminations, the Ateneo Lady Eagles swept the [[UP Fighting Maroons|UP Lady Maroons]] during their comeback Final Four appearance after 13 years in three straight sets (the first non-DLSU team to defeat them as UAAP women's volleyball champions) in the semifinals in a return trip to the finals for fifth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance, while the De La Salle Lady Spikers recovered from a shocking five-set loss in Game 1 of their Final Four match-up against the third-seeded [[FEU Tamaraws|FEU Lady Tamaraws]] to sweep their opponents in do-or-die Game 2 and book their eighth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance.\n\nThe UAAP Season 78 women's volleyball finals became the first championship series since the DLSU\u2013FEU match-up in [[UAAP Season 71 volleyball tournaments|Season 71]] to last up to three games under such tournament division (in a best-of-three finals series format). Game One of the Finals, which was held on April 23, 2016 and watched by 19,921 fans at the Smart Araneta Coliseum, was won by La Salle in straight sets, 25\u201322, 25\u201322, 25\u201321. Four days later, on April 27, 2016, Ateneo posed a come-from-behind win against La Salle in Game Two in five sets, 18\u201325, 26\u201328, 25\u201317, 25\u201316, 15\u201311, in front of the 20,541-strong crowd at the Mall of Asia Arena to force a winner-take-all match on April 30, 2016. La Salle, however, recovered in four sets, 19\u201325, 25\u201321, 25\u201316, 25\u201316 in Game Three to deny Ateneo's three-peat championship bid and win their ninth overall UAAP women's volleyball championship title (and first since Season 75) in front of a record 22,858-strong crowd at the Smart Araneta Coliseum.\n\nGraduating Ateneo Lady Eagles' team captain [[Alyssa Valdez]] earned her third straight Season Most Valuable Player (MVP) award, becoming the first UAAP women's volleyball athlete to earn three consecutive MVP awards since Monica Aleta from FEU from Seasons 63 to 65. Meanwhile, [[Kim Kianna Dy]] of the De La Salle Lady Spikers was hailed as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals.<ref>http://cnnphilippines.com/sports/2016/04/30/la-salle-ateneo-uaap-volleyball-championship.html</ref><ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/131321-ateneo-la-salle-volleyball-game-3-finals-recap-2016-season-78</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 79 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the sixth time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 79 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 79 women's volleyball finals]]. During the first round of eliminations, the defending champions (and eventually second-seeded) De La Salle Lady Spikers suffered a shock straight sets loss to the UP Lady Maroons but recovered in the second round of eliminations against the same team with another straight sets victory. Meanwhile, the Ateneo Lady Eagles suffered losses only to the NU Lady Bulldogs twice in the elimination rounds but swept the De La Salle Lady Spikers in the elimination rounds to secure the top seed for this season (marking the most recent time that Ateneo won against La Salle in any of their match-ups in UAAP women's volleyball as of the [[UAAP Season 82 volleyball tournaments|current season]]). In the semifinal round, the De La Salle Lady Spikers won over the third-seeded UST Tigresses during the latter's comeback Final Four appearance after 5 years in four sets to book their (Final Four era) league-record ninth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance, while the Ateneo Lady Eagles also won against the fourth-seeded FEU Lady Tamaraws in four sets to book their sixth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance.\n\nGame One of the Finals was held at the Smart Araneta Coliseum on May 2, 2017 in front of 13,468 fans. The De La Salle Lady Spikers recorded their first victory against Ateneo Lady Eagles during this game for this season in four sets, 21\u201325, 29\u201327, 25\u201322 and 25\u201320. Game Two of the Finals was held again at the Smart Araneta Coliseum on May 6, 2017 in front of 20,860 fans. The De La Salle Lady Spikers won against Ateneo Lady Eagles in five sets, 19\u201325, 25\u201314, 18\u201325, 25\u201318 and 15\u201310, to finish the series in two games and earn their second consecutive (and tenth overall) UAAP women's volleyball title. La Salle's [[Mary Joy Baron]] and [[Desiree Cheng]] were named as Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season and of the Finals, respectively.<ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/169078-lady-spikers-win-back-to-back-titles-sweep-ateneo</ref><ref>https://tiebreakertimes.com.ph/tbt/uaap-season-79-womens-volleyball-la-salle-reigns-for-10th-time-vanquishes-ateneo/84567</ref>\n\nSeason 79 would eventually be the last of the string of six consecutive Ateneo\u2013La Salle match-ups in the UAAP women's volleyball finals since Season 74, after the Lady Eagles were booted out from finals contention in [[UAAP Season 80 volleyball tournaments|Season 80]] as the third-seeded team by that season's hosting school and second-seeded team FEU Lady Tamaraws to face the top-seeded De La Salle Lady Spikers in the latter's tenth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance in 2018, and the first all-green (DLSU\u2013FEU) UAAP women's volleyball finals match-up since Season 71.\n\nLa Salle went on to sweep FEU in the finals to win their 11th UAAP women's volleyball title (and their third three-peat championship streak) in 2018,<ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/201607-dlsu-lady-spikers-winner-feu-tamaraws-season-80-finals-game-2</ref> but was dethroned by UST in their Final Four match-up [[UAAP Season 81 volleyball tournaments|the following year]], ending their third overall bid for four straight championships and 10 consecutive years of appearance in the UAAP Finals, while the Ateneo Lady Eagles won the same year's Final Four match-up against FEU to pose their return to the finals after missing the cut in the previous year. The Lady Eagles went on to win the finals series against UST, 2\u20131, in the first ever Ateneo\u2013UST UAAP women's volleyball finals showdown to claim their third women's volleyball title.<ref>https://sports.abs-cbn.com/uaap/news/2019/05/18/uaap-season-81-finals-lady-eagles-reclaim-throne-56887</ref>\n\n==Women's volleyball tournament results==\n\nThe rivalry began in [[UAAP Season 74]] when both teams met in the Finals for the first time. Head-to-head championships between the teams have La Salle leading 4 championships to 2. The Ateneo Lady Eagles and the De La Salle Lady Spikers have fought in the UAAP women's volleyball finals for six (6) consecutive times from Seasons 74 to 79 (2012\u20132017), where the Lady Eagles won in 2014 and 2015 while the Lady Spikers won in 2012, 2013, 2016, and 2017.\n\n===UAAP women's volleyball results===\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!width=120px|Season !!width=75px| Ateneo !!width=75px| La Salle !!width=210px|Venue !!Note/s !!Series\n|-\n|Season 60 || Ateneo 0 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || UP Human Kinetics Gym, [[Quezon City]] || ||\n|-\n|Season 60 || Ateneo 0 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || UP Human Kinetics Gym, [[Quezon City]] || [[DLSU Lady Spikers]] first [[UAAP Final Four]] appearance since their admission in 1986. ||\n|-\n|Season 61 || Ateneo 1 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || UP Human Kinetics Gym, [[Quezon City]] || ||\n|-\n|Season 61 || Ateneo 2 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || [[Blue Eagle Gym]], [[Quezon City]] || [[DLSU Lady Spikers]] first [[UAAP Volleyball Championship|UAAP women's volleyball finals]] appearance since their admission in 1986. ||\n|-\n|Season 62 || Ateneo 2 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || [[Blue Eagle Gym]], [[Quezon City]] || || \n|-\n|Season 62 || Ateneo 0 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || [[Blue Eagle Gym]], [[Quezon City]] || [[DLSU Lady Spikers]] went on to bag their first [[UAAP Volleyball Championship|UAAP women's volleyball championship]] title. || \n|-\n|Season 63 || Ateneo 2 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || UP Human Kinetics Gym, [[Quezon City]] || || \n|-\n|Season 63 || Ateneo 2 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || UP Human Kinetics Gym, [[Quezon City]] || || \n|-\n|Season 64 || Ateneo 2 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || [[Blue Eagle Gym]], [[Quezon City]] || || \n|-\n|Season 64 || Ateneo 1 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || [[Blue Eagle Gym]], [[Quezon City]] || || \n|-\n|Season 65 || Ateneo 2 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || UP Human Kinetics Gym, [[Quezon City]] || || \n|-\n|Season 65 || Ateneo 2 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || [[Blue Eagle Gym]], [[Quezon City]] || || \n|-\n|Season 66 || Ateneo 2 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || UP Human Kinetics Gym, [[Quezon City]] || || \n|-\n|Season 66 || Ateneo 0 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || UP Human Kinetics Gym, [[Quezon City]] || [[DLSU Lady Spikers]] were automatically declared as champions after sweeping the double elimination round and went on to bag their second [[UAAP Volleyball Championship|UAAP women's volleyball championship]] title. || \n|-\n|Season 67 || Ateneo 2 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || UP Human Kinetics Gym, [[Quezon City]] || || \n|-\n|Season 67 || Ateneo 2 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || [[Blue Eagle Gym]], [[Quezon City]] || [[DLSU Lady Spikers]] went on to bag their second straight and third [[UAAP Volleyball Championship|UAAP women's volleyball championship]] title. || \n|-\n|Season 68 || Ateneo 1 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || [[Cuneta Astrodome]], [[Pasay]] || || \n|-\n|Season 68 || Ateneo 1 ||bgcolor=#026f27| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> La Salle 3 </span>''' || [[Cuneta Astrodome]], [[Pasay]] || [[DLSU Lady Spikers]] went on to bag their third straight and fourth [[UAAP Volleyball Championship|UAAP women's volleyball championship]] title. || \n|-\n|Season 69 || colspan=\"4\" {{N/A|All [[De La Salle University]] varsity teams were suspended on this UAAP season.}} ||\n|-\n|Season 70 ||bgcolor=blue| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> Ateneo 3 </span> ''' || La Salle 1 || [[Filoil Flying V Centre]], [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan City]] || [[Ateneo Lady Eagles volleyball team|Ateneo Lady Eagles]] and [[DLSU Lady Spikers]] first meeting since La Salle's suspension. || \n|-\n|Season 70 ||bgcolor=blue| '''<span style=\"color:white;\"> <s> Ateneo 3 </s> </span> ''' || <s> La Salle 1 </s> || [[Filoil Flying V Centre]], [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan City]] || All games of La Salle in the second elimination round were nullified due to La Salle's Jacqueline Alarca's ineligibility.

The historied rivalry began when Ateneo lost to De La Salle in a hotly contested championship basketball game during the 16th NCAA Season (1939\u201340). Basketball games between Ateneo and La Salle in the NCAA were always hard fought but was not yet tagged by the local sportswriters as the recognized rivalry. The more popular collegiate sports rivalries was between Ateneo versus San Beda, and De La Salle versus Letran. The rivalry between De La Salle vs Ateneo then was mostly based on their academic performance, debate, social status, prestige and school pride. When Ateneo and De La Salle transferred to the UAAP in 1978 and 1986 respectively, they continued their fierce battles and innate animosity against each other on and off court. The sports press showed interest and wrote about the school rivalry that always caught the attention of sports loving fans. The basketball games between De La Salle and Ateneo are the most anticipated battles in every UAAP season year after year. A Green Archer versus Blue Eagle fray would always draw huge, loyal crowds of fanatical students, school faculty and officials, notable and influential alumni, actors and actresses, musicians, business tycoons, high government officials such as cabinet members, senators, congressmen, justices of the Supreme Court, former Presidents of the Philippines, and several notable people of great influence in Philippine society.

The [[Collegiate Champions League]] (CCL), was then reformatted and became the [[Philippine Collegiate Championship League]] (PCCL). It is currently the national collegiate basketball championship tournament, sanctioned by the [[Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas]], the country's official basketball federation. College teams from all over the country participate in the tournament. The tournament also has a Sweet 16 similar to the United States' NCAA Basketball Tournament during \"March Madness.\"\n\nThe Green Archers won the 2008 PCCL title. La Salle defeated the second-seeded NCAA champion [[San Beda Red Lions]] and arranged a finals meeting with the top-seeded UAAP champion Ateneo Blue Eagles, who defeated the [[Letran Knights]] in the Final Four. In the championship match, the [[De La Salle Green Archers]] prevailed over the [[Ateneo Blue Eagles]], 71\u201362.\n\nIn the 2009 season of the Philippine Collegiate Championship League, the Blue Eagles defeated the FEU Tamaraws in three games to clinch their second national title, whereas the Green Archers were eliminated by the Letran Knights in their first game in the round of 16. In the 2010 season, the Blue Eagles defeated the Adamson Falcons in three games to clinch their third and back-to-back national titles, while the Green Archers settled for 3rd-place beating the UC Webmasters despite having 4 players injured and only 10 players intact in the line-up.\n\nIn the 2013 season of the Philippine Collegiate Championship League, the Green Archers defeated the South Western University Cobras, via sweep to reclaim the national championship for the first time since 2008 and winning their second title in the tournament.\n\nIn the 2018 season of the Philippine Collegiate Championship League, the Blue Eagles defeated the University of Visayas Green Lancers, 95\u201371 to reclaim the national championship for the first time since 2010 and winning their fourth title in the tournament.

They currently hold the distinction of having the longest UAAP basketball title streak in the Final Four era after winning five straight times from 2008 to 2012. In 2019, Ateneo achieved another 3-peat and became the first team in the UAAP Final Four era to finish an entire season (including the finals) without a single loss (16\u20130) in the [[UAAP Season 82]] men's basketball tournament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/11/20/19/sweep-16-ateneo-wins-uaap-82-title-in-historic-fashion|title=Sweep 16!

The Ateneo Blue Eagles still have the most number of double titles in NCAA history, with four double championships, including the NCAA's second back-to-back double championships in 1975 and 1976 (the first was accomplished by the University of the Philippines in 1925 and 1926).\n\nAteneo holds the distinction of being the only double 3-peat champion in the senior and junior levels whether in the NCAA or UAAP, from 2008 to 2010, and has posted two 4-peats and three back-to-back title streaks in the UAAP juniors' division.\n\nLa Salle does not have any such streaks in the NCAA, but won back-to-back titles once in 1989 and 1990, and also posted a rare 4-peat in UAAP men's basketball from [[UAAP Season 61|1998]] to [[UAAP Season 64|2001]]. La Salle accomplished the double championship once during its stint in the NCAA (1939) and UAAP (2007).\n\nThe Lady Archers also achieved a 4-peat of their own from 1999 to 2002 which was the longest UAAP women's basketball championship streak in the Final Four era, until the NU Lady Bulldogs achieved their fifth consecutive championship in 2018.\n\nLa Salle holds the distinction of being the first and only school to be 3-peat UAAP basketball champions in both men's and women's divisions in the same period, from 1999 to 2001. In 2013, La Salle were champions in both divisions again in the [[UAAP Season 76 basketball tournaments]].\n\n===NCAA===\nIn 1939, La Salle defeated Ateneo in both the Seniors and Juniors NCAA Championship.

Another finals meeting of both schools took place in 1974 with La Salle prevailing over Ateneo in the championship.

La Salle won back-to-back titles in 1989 and 1990, and won four straight titles from 1998 to 2001, with La Salle beating Ateneo in the 2001 Finals, capping its 4-peat title run. Ateneo subsequently defeated La Salle in the 2002 championship to end its 14-year title drought. In 2003, Ateneo eliminated La Salle in the semifinals, breaking a streak of La Salle appearances in the UAAP Finals. La Salle won the 2004 title after eliminating Ateneo in the semifinals, but was stripped of the title when they were suspended for fielding two ineligible players. La Salle swept the UE Red Warriors to win the 2007 title after the suspension, a season that saw them meet the Blue Eagles five times, lose thrice, but win two crucial games including the one that paved the way for a Finals appearance. Ateneo defeated La Salle in all four encounters in 2008, including the Finals, thereby dethroning DLSU. Ateneo then went on to win all matches against La Salle on the way to winning a running total of five consecutive UAAP titles, except for a lone La Salle victory in the first round of eliminations in 2010. In 2012, the two teams met in a Final Four encounter, where the Blue Eagles defeated the Green Archers, eliminating La Salle from contention. With its 2012 title victory, Ateneo broke its deadlock of UAAP titles with La Salle and exceeded La Salle's championship streak with the longest in the Final Four era, and now has the longest held by only one UAAP school. Ateneo failed to enter the Final Four in 2013 while La Salle won the title for the first time since 2007. Both teams failed to enter the Finals in 2014. In 2015, both teams failed once again to enter the Finals with La Salle missing the Final Four for the first time since 2011, while Ateneo made it to the semifinals but lost to the eventual champions FEU Tamaraws, who also ousted La Salle in their last game (a game in which La Salle needed to win to stay in contention and force a knockout match) for the last Final Four slot in which enabled the erstwhile defending champions NU Bulldogs to grab the #4 position in the playoffs. In 2016 both teams met in the Finals for the first time since 2008 with both schools taking the Top 2 spots at the end of the elimination rounds and having the twice to beat advantage, with La Salle outlasting Adamson in one game, while Ateneo used their twice to beat advantage to take out the defending champions FEU Tamaraws in a hard-fought series with Ateneo winning the second game in an overtime thriller in which both teams did not score more than five points in the extra period. In the Finals the Green Archers swept the Blue Eagles to win their 9th title and break the tie among them for the number of UAAP titles. In 2017, both Ateneo and La Salle met once again in the Finals and the first back-to-back Ateneo\u2013La Salle Finals series since 2002 with Ateneo winning this time in 3 full games that ended their 5-year title drought and dethroning La Salle in the process.\n\n'''2001 Finals: La Salle 4-peat'''<br />\n{|class=wikitable align=right\n|-\n!Game !!

With these conditions, the first Ateneo\u2013La Salle game came at the heels of former [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Corazon Aquino]]'s death, and as a result, spectators wore yellow as a sign for respect for Aquino. Ateneo outlasted La Salle in overtime to end the first round with a solitary loss. The two teams met a week later, but this time Ateneo had a big enough lead to prevent La Salle from catching up. Ateneo qualified for the semifinals as the No. 1 seed, eventually winning the championship; La Salle missed out on the Final Four on the final day after being defeated by NU. The 2009 season would be the first time Ateneo and La Salle would not meet in the playoffs since 2001, not including their Finals encounter in 2008 and the DLSU suspension in 2006.\n\nIn 2010, parading some new players and an improved set of veterans, the Green Archers defeated the Blue Eagles, 66\u201363, with the Blue Eagles still feeling the loss of three of the previous season's starters and sophomore guard Sam Marata shooting hot in the end game. This was the first official win of the Green Archers against the Blue Eagles in UAAP action since 2007.  In the second round encounter, the Ateneo Blue Eagles were threatened with falling into a tie in the standings had they lost to DLSU. After falling behind 4\u20139, the Blue Eagles went on a 10\u20130 scoring run to take a double digit lead, and went on to defeat the Archers decisively, 74\u201357.\n\n2010 was the second straight year that Ateneo and DLSU would not meet in a post eliminations series. DLSU managed to reach the Final Four after missing it in the previous season, but fell to the top-seeded FEU Tamaraws in overtime. The Blue Eagles defeated the Adamson Falcons in the Final Four, and went on to sweep the Tamaraws for their third consecutive title despite not having any player in the Mythical Team.\n\nIn 2011, the Ateneo Blue Eagles team headlined by two rookies defeated DLSU again in both of their elimination matches. It is also the third straight year that Ateneo and DLSU would not meet in a post elimination series, since the DLSU Green Archers failed to qualify once again for the Final Four. The Ateneo Blue Eagles were the top-seeded team in the semifinals and defeated the UST Growling Tigers in one game. The Blue Eagles then proceeded to sweep the Finals series against the FEU Tamaraws, thus achieving its own four-peat.\n\nPrior to the start of the 2012 season, Norman Black announced that this would be his last season as head coach of the Ateneo. La Salle, on the other hand, had a rookie coach in Gee Abanilla. The two schools met thrice that season- twice in the elimination and once in the semi-finals with Ateneo winning all of the games. A few days prior to the Final 4 match between Ateneo and La Salle, the Blue Eagle's patron, Manny Pangilinan, announced that he would be pulling out his support from the school. Despite the controversy, Ateneo eventually won its fifth consecutive title, sweeping UST in the Finals.\n\n'''2013: The End of an Era for Ateneo'''\n\nUpon the departure of Norman Black, [[Bo Perasol|Dolreich \"Bo\" Perasol]], a former member of the [[UP Fighting Maroons|University of the Philippines men's basketball team]] and a seasoned [[Philippine Basketball Association]] head coach, was tapped by Ateneo as head coach of the Blue Eagles. The entry of Perasol, who was rumored to be tapped as team consultant of the UP Fighting Maroons prior to his appointment as Ateneo head coach, also heralded the return of Manny Pangilinan as the Blue Eagles' main patron. Joining Ateneo men's basketball team was Filipino-American forward Chris Newsome.\n\nOver at La Salle, a series of reshuffles within and outside of the team resulted to the appointment of then assistant coach Juno Sauler as the head coach of the Green Archers. Joining the De La Salle Green Archers coaching staff prior to the start of the 2013\u20132014 UAAP season was Allan Caidic, who took on the chores of shooting coach. Filipino-American forwards Jason Perkins and Matthew Salem became a part of team roster, which had to adjust to the loss of resident players Yutien Andrada, Mac Tallo, Fonzo Gotladera and Papot Paredes.\n\nFor the first time since 2005, La Salle was able to sweep Ateneo during the elimination round. During their first round meeting at the Mall of Asia Arena last July 7, 2013, the Green Archers, banking on the heroics of combo guard Almond Vosotros and center Arnold Van Opstal, defeated the Blue Eagles, 82\u201373, resulting to Ateneo's third straight loss to start the season. The second round meeting, which was held at the Araneta Coliseum last September 1, 2013, was tightly contested by Ateneo and La Salle, with the Green Archers winning over the Blue Eagles, 66\u201364, after sophomore forward Jeron Teng sank a floater with only two seconds left in the shot clock.\n\nToward the end of the second round Ateneo-La Salle game, Perasol was involved in a scuffle with JJ Atayde, an alumnus of La Salle, after the former got irked with the latter's heckling. The incident caused the UAAP Board to penalize Perasol with a one-game suspension and Atayde with a season-wide ban from watching games. Controversy further ensued after Perasol violated his one-game suspension by watching from inside the Ateneo dugout during the Blue Eagles' September 8, 2013 game against the UE Red Warriors, forcing UE team officials to file an inquiry before the UAAP Board. The UAAP Board acted on UE's request for an inquiry, ordering Perasol to serve his one-game suspension during Ateneo's September 18, 2013 game against the [[UST Growling Tigers]].\n\nAteneo, with Perasol serving his one-game suspension, was eventually defeated by UST, 74\u201382, causing the Blue Eagles to not only be dethroned as UAAP Men's Basketball Champions after five straight seasons but to also miss Final Four contention for the first time since 1998.\n\nLa Salle, after a disastrous 3\u20134 finish during the first round of elimination games, swept the second round and ended the elimination round at 10\u20134, forcing a three-way tie for the top spot alongside the [[NU Bulldogs]] and the [[FEU Tamaraws]]. Due to having the highest quotient, NU took the Number One spot with twice-to-beat advantage and faced the UST in the Final Four, with the Growling Tigers defeating the Bulldogs in two games. On the other hand, La Salle and FEU faced each other twice, the first meeting being a rubber match game for the Number Two spot and the twice-to-beat advantage and the second being the formal Final Four game, with the Green Archers winning on both occasions and entering the Finals for the first time since [[UAAP Season 71]]. During the finals series, La Salle defeated UST in three games to win the [[UAAP Season 76]] men's basketball championship title.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://sports.inquirer.net/124063/la-salle-beats-ust-in-overtime-for-uaap-title|title= La Salle rallies past UST in OT to win UAAP title|work=Inquirer|access-date=January 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n'''2016 Finals: Mayhem'''\n{|class=wikitable align=right\n|-\n!Game !!

And a similar rivalry, although on much lesser scale, currently exists. When [[La Salle Green Hills]] used to be the juniors' team of the Green Archers in the NCAA though, the rivalry between the Ateneo and La Salle in the high school level was much stronger, considering that both the [[Ateneo de Manila University#High School|Ateneo High School]] and the [[La Salle Green Hills#High School|LSGH High School]] are all-male schools, igniting a huge rumble in 1978. But this rivalry has since faded, with AHS being in the UAAP and LSGH staying in the NCAA. Still, the remnants of this rivalry live on in the UAAP with LSGH's sister school [[De La Salle-Santiago Zobel School]], the juniors representative of De La Salle University in the UAAP, taking its place.\n\nIn juniors' basketball, Ateneo has 11 NCAA titles and 19 UAAP titles, for a total of 30, whereas La Salle has 6 NCAA titles and 2 UAAP titles, for 8 in total.\n\nLa Salle Greenies defeated the Ateneo Blue Eaglets in the 1939 NCAA Junior Championship.

The Blue Eaglet Spikers won championship titles in NCAA Seasons 43, 45, and 48, and were 3-peat champions from Seasons 50 to 52. The De La Salle Junior Spikers won 7 championship titles under their membership stint in the NCAA which included a 4-peat championship streak along with the Green Spikers from Seasons 53 to 56. In the UAAP, they were 6-peat champions in the boys' division from Seasons 57 to 62, and have also won the title in Season 66. The Junior Lady Spikers were 5-peat champions from UAAP Seasons 57 to 61, and were 3-peat champions from Seasons 73 to 75.

On the other hand, the Ateneo Lady Eagles, consistently ranked second throughout much of the elimination round, defeated the third-seeded (and [[UAAP Season 73 volleyball tournaments|previous season's]] runner-up) [[UST Growling Tigers|UST Tigresses]] in the semifinals, and entered the finals for the first time since Ateneo De Manila University's 1978 admission into the UAAP.\n\nThe De La Salle Lady Spikers defeated the Ateneo Lady Eagles in three games to win their 7th UAAP women's volleyball championship title. Game One of the Finals was won by Ateneo in four sets but Games Two and Three of the series were won by La Salle, with the DLSU Lady Spikers beating the Ateneo Lady Spikers in four sets during Game Two and in three sets during Game Three.

The Lady Spikers posed a comeback win over the Lady Eagles in five sets, 20\u201325, 17\u201325, 25\u201322, 25\u201322, 15\u20136.\n\nPrior to Game Two of the finals, held at the [[Mall of Asia Arena]] on March 6, 2013, team captain [[Aby Mara\u00f1o|Abigail Mara\u00f1o]] and teammate [[Victonara Galang]] were named co-Most Valuable Players (MVPs) of the Season. With the game attended by 18,779 paying patrons, La Salle swept Ateneo in Game Two, 25\u201323, 25\u201320, 25\u201316, to finish the series in two games and win their third consecutive (and 8th overall) UAAP women's volleyball championship title. Then-graduating La Salle player [[Michele Gumabao]] was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals.<ref>http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/298005/sports/campussports/uaap-dlsu-defeats-ateneo-for-the-women-s-volleyball-crown-completes-3-peat</ref><ref>https://www.philstar.com/sports/2013/03/06/916692/la-salle-blazes-way-uaap-womens-volleyball-three-peat</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 76 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the third time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 76 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 76 women's volleyball finals]]. The De La Salle Lady Spikers automatically entered the finals with a thrice-to-beat advantage after sweeping the elimination round. On the other hand, the Ateneo Lady Eagles, under new head coach Anusorn \"Tai\" Bundit, were able to reach the finals after winning knockout matches against fourth-seeded Adamson Lady Falcons and then second-seeded, twice-to-beat NU Lady Bulldogs under the stepladder format.\n\nGame One of the Finals, which was held on March 5, 2014, was won by Ateneo in four sets, 17\u201325, 25\u201323, 25\u201313, 25\u201320. Three days later, on March 8, 2014, La Salle bounced back in Game Two and defeated Ateneo in four sets, 25\u201314, 25\u201320, 19\u201325, 26\u201324. The first two games of the Finals were held at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]].\n\nThe venue of the remaining games of the Finals shifted from the Smart Araneta Coliseum to the [[Mall of Asia Arena]]. In Game Three, which was held on March 12, 2014, Ateneo defeated La Salle in five sets in front of the 18,095-strong crowd, 25\u201321, 25\u201323, 18\u201325, 16\u201325, 17\u201315, to force a winner-take-all title match on March 15, 2014. As a result, the UAAP Season 76 women's volleyball finals series became the league's longest championship series in any sport, and the first to last up to four games (in a best-of-five finals series format with a 1\u20130 advantage for any team). In Game Four, the Ateneo Lady Eagles swept the De La Salle Lady Spikers, 25\u201323, 26\u201324, 25\u201321, to deny La Salle's second overall four-peat championship bid and win their first UAAP women's volleyball championship title at the Mall of Asia Arena after a 21,314-strong audience.\n\nAteneo's team captain [[Alyssa Valdez]] was named as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season and of the Finals, and became the first UAAP athlete to win at least 4 awards in a single season (including awards for the Season's Best Scorer and Best Server categories).<ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/53094-ateneo-upsets-de-la-salle-wins-first-uaap-volleyball-crown</ref><ref>https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/content/353812/united-they-fly-how-the-admu-lady-eagles-became-uaap-vball-champs/story/</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 77 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the fourth time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 77 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 77 women's volleyball finals]]. For the first time in UAAP history, the Ateneo Lady Eagles defeated the De La Salle Lady Spikers twice during the elimination rounds, and entered the finals with the thrice-to-beat advantage after amassing a 14\u20130 eliminations sweeps record. On the other hand, the second-seeded De La Salle Lady Spikers suffered their first defeat from a non-Ateneo team in the tournament (since UST Tigresses' shocking five-set season-opening win against DLSU in Season 75) during Game One against the third-seeded NU Lady Bulldogs in the semifinals (in straight sets), but recovered in Game Two in four sets at the expense of then La Salle's Team Captain Victonara Galang's post-season injury (which sidelined her from playing for Season 77 Finals).\n\nGame One of the Finals, which was held on March 11, 2015 at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]] in front of 18,363 fans, was won by Ateneo in straight sets, 25\u201318, 25\u201319, 25\u201319. Three days later, on March 14, 2015, watched by 20,705 fans at the [[Mall of Asia Arena]], Ateneo swept La Salle again in straight sets, 25\u201322, 25\u201317, 25\u201323, becoming the league's first ever overall volleyball varsity team to achieve a 16\u20130 perfect season (eliminations round up to the championship series) record and defeated La Salle for the second consecutive season to win the UAAP Season 77 volleyball championship title. Ateneo team captain [[Alyssa Valdez]] was named back-to-back Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season, while [[Amy Ahomiro]] won the award as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals.<ref>http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/content/452461/uaap-ateneo-shuts-out-la-salle-for-perfect-season-wins-second-straight-women-s-volleyball-title/story/?ref=related_stories</ref><ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/admu/86845-ateneo-sweeps-season-repeat-uaap-volleyball-champion</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 78 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the fifth time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 78 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 78 women's volleyball finals]]. During the first round of the eliminations, the eventually second-seeded DLSU Lady Spikers swept the season's top-seeded ADMU Lady Eagles in three straight sets to deny them a sweep of the elimination round and revert the tournament to a [[UAAP Final Four|Regular Final Four]] format for the first time since Season 75. In the second round, however, Ateneo recovered in a five-set comeback win to seal their top-seed position. After the eliminations, the Ateneo Lady Eagles swept the [[UP Fighting Maroons|UP Lady Maroons]] during their comeback Final Four appearance after 13 years in three straight sets (the first non-DLSU team to defeat them as UAAP women's volleyball champions) in the semifinals in a return trip to the finals for fifth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance, while the De La Salle Lady Spikers recovered from a shocking five-set loss in Game 1 of their Final Four match-up against the third-seeded [[FEU Tamaraws|FEU Lady Tamaraws]] to sweep their opponents in do-or-die Game 2 and book their eighth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance.\n\nThe UAAP Season 78 women's volleyball finals became the first championship series since the DLSU\u2013FEU match-up in [[UAAP Season 71 volleyball tournaments|Season 71]] to last up to three games under such tournament division (in a best-of-three finals series format). Game One of the Finals, which was held on April 23, 2016 and watched by 19,921 fans at the Smart Araneta Coliseum, was won by La Salle in straight sets, 25\u201322, 25\u201322, 25\u201321. Four days later, on April 27, 2016, Ateneo posed a come-from-behind win against La Salle in Game Two in five sets, 18\u201325, 26\u201328, 25\u201317, 25\u201316, 15\u201311, in front of the 20,541-strong crowd at the Mall of Asia Arena to force a winner-take-all match on April 30, 2016. La Salle, however, recovered in four sets, 19\u201325, 25\u201321, 25\u201316, 25\u201316 in Game Three to deny Ateneo's three-peat championship bid and win their ninth overall UAAP women's volleyball championship title (and first since Season 75) in front of a record 22,858-strong crowd at the Smart Araneta Coliseum.\n\nGraduating Ateneo Lady Eagles' team captain [[Alyssa Valdez]] earned her third straight Season Most Valuable Player (MVP) award, becoming the first UAAP women's volleyball athlete to earn three consecutive MVP awards since Monica Aleta from FEU from Seasons 63 to 65. Meanwhile, [[Kim Kianna Dy]] of the De La Salle Lady Spikers was hailed as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals.<ref>http://cnnphilippines.com/sports/2016/04/30/la-salle-ateneo-uaap-volleyball-championship.html</ref><ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/131321-ateneo-la-salle-volleyball-game-3-finals-recap-2016-season-78</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 79 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the sixth time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 79 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 79 women's volleyball finals]]. During the first round of eliminations, the defending champions (and eventually second-seeded) De La Salle Lady Spikers suffered a shock straight sets loss to the UP Lady Maroons but recovered in the second round of eliminations against the same team with another straight sets victory. Meanwhile, the Ateneo Lady Eagles suffered losses only to the NU Lady Bulldogs twice in the elimination rounds but swept the De La Salle Lady Spikers in the elimination rounds to secure the top seed for this season (marking the most recent time that Ateneo won against La Salle in any of their match-ups in UAAP women's volleyball as of the [[UAAP Season 82 volleyball tournaments|current season]]). In the semifinal round, the De La Salle Lady Spikers won over the third-seeded UST Tigresses during the latter's comeback Final Four appearance after 5 years in four sets to book their (Final Four era) league-record ninth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance, while the Ateneo Lady Eagles also won against the fourth-seeded FEU Lady Tamaraws in four sets to book their sixth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance.\n\nGame One of the Finals was held at the Smart Araneta Coliseum on May 2, 2017 in front of 13,468 fans. The De La Salle Lady Spikers recorded their first victory against Ateneo Lady Eagles during this game for this season in four sets, 21\u201325, 29\u201327, 25\u201322 and 25\u201320. Game Two of the Finals was held again at the Smart Araneta Coliseum on May 6, 2017 in front of 20,860 fans. The De La Salle Lady Spikers won against Ateneo Lady Eagles in five sets, 19\u201325, 25\u201314, 18\u201325, 25\u201318 and 15\u201310, to finish the series in two games and earn their second consecutive (and tenth overall) UAAP women's volleyball title. La Salle's [[Mary Joy Baron]] and [[Desiree Cheng]] were named as Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season and of the Finals, respectively.<ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/169078-lady-spikers-win-back-to-back-titles-sweep-ateneo</ref><ref>https://tiebreakertimes.com.ph/tbt/uaap-season-79-womens-volleyball-la-salle-reigns-for-10th-time-vanquishes-ateneo/84567</ref>\n\nSeason 79 would eventually be the last of the string of six consecutive Ateneo\u2013La Salle match-ups in the UAAP women's volleyball finals since Season 74, after the Lady Eagles were booted out from finals contention in [[UAAP Season 80 volleyball tournaments|Season 80]] as the third-seeded team by that season's hosting school and second-seeded team FEU Lady Tamaraws to face the top-seeded De La Salle Lady Spikers in the latter's tenth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance in 2018, and the first all-green (DLSU\u2013FEU) UAAP women's volleyball finals match-up since Season 71.\n\nLa Salle went on to sweep FEU in the finals to win their 11th UAAP women's volleyball title (and their third three-peat championship streak) in 2018,<ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/201607-dlsu-lady-spikers-winner-feu-tamaraws-season-80-finals-game-2</ref> but was dethroned by UST in their Final Four match-up [[UAAP Season 81 volleyball tournaments|the following year]], ending their third overall bid for four straight championships and 10 consecutive years of appearance in the UAAP Finals, while the Ateneo Lady Eagles won the same year's Final Four match-up against FEU to pose their return to the finals after missing the cut in the previous year. The Lady Eagles went on to win the finals series against UST, 2\u20131, in the first ever Ateneo\u2013UST UAAP women's volleyball finals showdown to claim their third women's volleyball title.<ref>https://sports.abs-cbn.com/uaap/news/2019/05/18/uaap-season-81-finals-lady-eagles-reclaim-throne-56887</ref>\n\n==Women's volleyball tournament results==\n\nHead-to-head championships between the teams have La Salle leading 4 championships to 2.

[[Joel Banal]], Ateneo's head coach from 2002 to [[UAAP Season 66|2003]], used to have nightmares about La Salle's dreaded [[Full-court press|press]], and considers the 2002 championship as his greatest accomplishment, after which Ateneo alums would pay for his restaurant bills. Moreover, Ateneo alumni installed the playing floor on the [[2000 NBA All-Star Game]] to the [[Moro Lorenzo Sports Center]], while [[ICTSI]] shipping magnate Billionaire [[Enrique K. Razon|Enrique Razon, Jr.]] donated US$1 million to refurbish La Salle's sporting facilities at the [[Enrique M.
