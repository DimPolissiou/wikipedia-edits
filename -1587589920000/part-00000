Polygamy is mostly seen in populations that lack [[genetic diversity]]. Polygamy in less genetically diverse populations is a means of avoiding fertilization between beetles that are closely related since they may be genetically incompatible.<ref>Welsh Jennifer. (2011).\"Inbreeding makes female beetles frisky.\" Live Science.</ref> The more partners that a male or female has, the higher the chances that at least one of the matings is with an unrelated partner and the greater the genetic diversity in the offspring. In this way, genetic incompatibility is reduced and diversity is increased in a population. For this reason, females copulate with more males when genetic diversity is low in order to attain fertilization success and also increase fitness in their subsequent offspring.\n\nIn some studies, however, it has been noted that fertilization can still occur when related beetles mate. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that there is a significantly lower number of offspring produced when inbred beetles mate than when the matings are between out-bred partners. Successful fertilization observed in a small portion of research in related beetles has led some biologists to claim that there may be no [[inbreeding depression]] in red flour beetles.<ref name=\":0\" /> Even though there is successful fertilization, it is observed that a lower number of total offspring is produced, which can be argued to be a type of inbreeding depression since it lowers reproduction fitness.\n\nDuring mating, red flour beetles are known to engage in polygamous behavior. Male flour beetles have been known to recognize their relatives while the females do not have this capability. Lack of the ability to recognize their relatives has led females to mate with any male within the population.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | last1 = Tyler | first1 = F | last2 = Tregenza | first2 = T | year = 2012 | title = Why do so many flour beetle copulations fail? | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/36fce78f6852dd0e7d8665c599a7bdc3ce049eb0| journal = Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata | volume = 146 | issue = | pages = 199\u2013206 | doi=10.1111/j.1570-7458.2012.01292.x}}</ref> Female red flour beetles are also known to store sperm after mating.

Within a single copulation period, a single female will mate with multiple different males. Female red flour beetles engage in polyandrous mating behavior in order to increase their fertility assurance. By mating with an increased number of males, female beetles obtain a greater amount of sperm. Obtaining a greater amount of sperm is especially important since many sexually active male red flour beetles are non-virgins and may be sperm-depleted.

He was replaced as [[CBS/Fox Video]] president in January 1983 by a former [[Columbia Pictures]] executive, Larry Hilford. Hilford was verbal critic of the video rental business, but with the studio looking at a likely loss, he attempted to make the out of the results. CBS/Fox and other home video units increased prices of the cassettes by around 67% to maximize income. They also move to encourage customer purchasing instead of renting. As a part of that CBS/Fox looked to existing retail chains for direct sales. [[Toys R Us]] and [[Child World]] signed the first direct deals in July 1985 with CBS/Fox. Walt Disney Home Video soon followed with a direct deal with Toys R Us.<ref name=\"mpn\" />\n\nby 1991, 20th Century Fox had put the CBS-Fox joint venture on the back burner and began releasing videocassette under the Fox Video.

Divx was DVD variant that had limited viewing time launched by Circuit City consumer electronics chain in June 1998. With DVD's low cost at $20 and Divx at $4.50, the DVD format won quickly out over Divx. News Corp chief Rupert Murdoch wanted a deal with Time Warner cable for the soon to launch [[Fox News]] and a lower dial position for [[Fox Family Channel]], Mechanic adopted the DVD format to smooth the deal.<ref name=\"mpn\" />\n\nBy 1998, Wyatt became permanent president of Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment. Wyatt then became head of Fox Consumer Product, which put together the video and licensing unit. Wyatt had to drop the licensing half as the home video unit boomed. DVD sales were so strong that they factored into green-lighting theatrical films.<ref name=\"mpn\" />\n\nWyatt reorganized the Fox Home Entertainment through a partnership with replicator Cinram and lead the way in using data mining to increase its retail business partner's margins. Being ahead of the other studios, TCFHE began picking up additional outside labels as distribution clients with their fees covering the company's overhead. Fox Home Entertainment won multiple Vendor of the Year awards. Wyatt's system was a great edge for years.<ref name=\"mpn\" />\n\nTV-on-DVD business was intiated by Wyatt through the release of whole season of ''[[The X-Files]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', which started the binge-watching concept. However, the videocassette rental business was declining such that video rental chains signed revenue-sharing deals with the studios, so additional copies of hits could be brought in a lower price and share sales for more customer satisfaction.<ref name=\"mpn\" />\n\nWith the DVD boom, the company was able to have various promotional stunts for their video releases from ''The Simpsons'' and ''[[Cast Away]]''. For the Simpsons release, there was ''The Simpsons on Ice'' in Bryant Park, turned the Empire State Building yellow and handed out yellow Santa hats that were all over town. ''Cast Away'' had a US Coast Guard rescue co-star \u2018Wilson,\u2019 the volleyball, at sea during their water safety awareness campaign.<ref name=\"mpn\" />\n\nMechanic left Fox in June 2000 while Wyatt resigned in December 2002.

''Passion'' sold 15 million DVDs. TCFHE continued obtaining additional Christian films' domestic home video rights for movie like \"[[Mother Teresa of Calcutta (film)|Mother Teresa]]\" and the \"[[Beyond the Gates of Splendor]]\" documentary.

With DVD's low cost at $20 and Divx at $4.50, the DVD format won quickly out over Divx. News Corp chief Rupert Murdoch wanted a deal with Time Warner cable for the soon to launch [[Fox News]] and a lower dial position for [[Fox Family Channel]], Mechanic adopted the DVD format to smooth the deal.<ref name=\"mpn\" />\n\nBy 1998, Wyatt became permanent president of Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment. Wyatt then became head of Fox Consumer Product, which put together the video and licensing unit. Wyatt had to drop the licensing half as the home video unit boomed. DVD sales were so strong that they factored into green-lighting theatrical films.<ref name=\"mpn\" />\n\nWyatt reorganized the Fox Home Entertainment through a partnership with replicator Cinram and lead the way in using data mining to increase its retail business partner's margins. Being ahead of the other studios, TCFHE began picking up additional outside labels as distribution clients with their fees covering the company's overhead. Fox Home Entertainment won multiple Vendor of the Year awards. Wyatt's system was a great edge for years.<ref name=\"mpn\" />\n\nTV-on-DVD business was intiated by Wyatt through the release of whole season of ''[[The X-Files]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', which started the binge-watching concept. However, the videocassette rental business was declining such that video rental chains signed revenue-sharing deals with the studios, so additional copies of hits could be brought in a lower price and share sales for more customer satisfaction.<ref name=\"mpn\" />\n\nWith the DVD boom, the company was able to have various promotional stunts for their video releases from ''The Simpsons'' and ''[[Cast Away]]''. For the Simpsons release, there was ''The Simpsons on Ice'' in Bryant Park, turned the Empire State Building yellow and handed out yellow Santa hats that were all over town. ''Cast Away'' had a US Coast Guard rescue co-star \u2018Wilson,\u2019 the volleyball, at sea during their water safety awareness campaign.<ref name=\"mpn\" />\n\nMechanic left Fox in June 2000 while Wyatt resigned in December 2002. [[Jim Gianopulos]] replaced Mechanic while executive vice president of domestic marketing and sales, Mike Dunn, took over from Wyatt. Wyatt left to start a direct-to-video film production and financing company for Japanese-style animated programming.<ref name=\"mpn\" />\n\nIn 2004, 20th Century Fox passed on theatrical distribution, while picking up domestic home video rights on ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]''. ''Passion'' sold 15 million DVDs. TCFHE continued obtaining additional Christian films' domestic home video rights for movie like \"[[Mother Teresa of Calcutta (film)|Mother Teresa]]\" and the \"[[Beyond the Gates of Splendor]]\" documentary. After a 2005 test with a [[Fox Faith]] website, in 2006, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment launched its own film production banner for religious films using the same name.<ref>{{cite news |last=Munoz |first=Lorenza |title=Fox Puts Faith in Christian Films |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-sep-19-fi-faith19-story.html |accessdate=June 18, 2019 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=September 19, 2006}}</ref>\n\nEffective October 1, 2005, 20th Century Fox Scandinavia was split into two, 20th Century Fox Theatrical Sweden and 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment Scandinavia. For the Home Entertainment Scandinavia, Peter Paumgardhen was appointed managing director and would report to senior vice president of 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment Europe Gary Ferguson.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2005/scene/markets-festivals/20th-century-fox-does-the-scandi-splits-1117928855/|title=20th Century Fox does the Scandi splits|last=Lundberg|first=Pia|date=September 11, 2005|work=Variety|accessdate=June 18, 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n\nDVD was declining in 2005 and high-definition TVs almost required a new disc format, Fox and half the studios back [[Blu-ray]] while the other half backed [[HD DVD]] and a couple planned to issue in both formats. Blu-ray won the format war in 2008, but with digital distribution starting, i.e. Netflix launching its streaming service, and the Great Recession, there was not the rebound that was expected.<ref name=\"mpn\" />\n\nWith [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] moving its home video distribution to TCFHE in 2006, the company move into second place behind Warner Bros. and ahead of Walt Disney and had its best year yet. In October, Fox Home Entertainment issued the first to include a digital copy along on a disc with the special-edition DVD of ''[[Live Free or Die Hard]]''.<ref name=\"mpn\" />\n\n2010 Blu-ray release of ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' was the year's top-selling title and the top Blu-ray Disc seller with 5 million units sold. In 2011, Fox released on Blu-ray Disc the full ''[[Star Wars]]'' double trilogy on 9 discs premium set selling 1 million units its first week in stores generating $84 million in gross sales.<ref name=\"mpn\" />\n\nIn response to Warner Brothers, Sony and MGM/UA issuing manufactured-on-demand lines of no-frills DVD-R editions of older films in May 2012, TCFHE began releasing its Cinema Archives series. By November 2012, the archive series had released 100 movies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/movies/homevideo/the-cinema-archives-series-from-20th-century-fox.html|title=The Cinema Archives Series from 20th Century Fox|last=Kehr|first=Dave|date=2012-11-30|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-06-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nFox Home Entertainment started the early window policy, where the digital version is release through digital retailers two or three weeks before the discs, and was launched with ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'' in September 2012. This also started Fox's [[Digital HD]] program where customers could download or stream 600 Fox films on connected devices at less than $15/film through multiple major platforms. However, Digital HD was soon dropped as 4K, or [[Ultra HD]], was introduced in 2012. In 2014, a high-tech think tank, [[Fox Innovation Lab]], was formed under 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment.<ref name=\"mpn\" />\n\nIn September 2015, the first Ultra HD Blu-ray player was introduced leading TCFE to have future movies released same day in Ultra HD Blu-ray as regular Blu-ray and DVD. The first Ultra HD Blu-ray films were released in March 2016 with Fox being one of four studios involved and had the most titles with 10.<ref name=\"mpn\" />\n\nDunn added another title in December 2016: president of product strategy and consumer business development. Dunn turned over TCFHE in March 2017 to Keith Feldman taking over his older title, president of worldwide home entertainment.

H. Lawrence]]; Lawrence conceived the idea for the novel while visiting [[Mexico]] in 1923, and its themes reflect his experiences there. The novel was first published by [[Martin Secker]]'s firm in the United Kingdom and [[Alfred A. Knopf]] in the United States; an early draft was published as '''''Quetzalcoatl''''' by Black Swan Books in 1995. The novel's plot concerns Kate Leslie, an Irish tourist who visits Mexico after the [[Mexican Revolution]]. She encounters Don Cipriano, a Mexican general who supports a religious movement, the Men of Quetzalcoatl, founded by his friend Don Ram\u00f3n Carrasco. Within this movement, Cipriano is identified with [[Hu\u012btzil\u014dp\u014dchtli|Huitzilopochtli]] and Ram\u00f3n with [[Quetzalcoatl]]. Kate eventually agrees to marry Cipriano, while the Men of Quetzalcoatl, with the help of a new President, bring about an end to [[Christianity]] in Mexico, replacing it with Quetzalcoatl worship.\n\nThe novel received negative reviews. Commentators have characterised it as fascist and an attack on Christianity, and seen it as expressing Lawrence's fears about the decline of the [[white race]] and belief in women's submission to men. It has also been interpreted as an expression of his personal political ambition and as having [[Homoeroticism|homoerotic]] aspects. Critics have disagreed about its literary merit. Some have found it inferior to his other work, but others have considered it his greatest accomplishment as a novelist, an assessment shared by Lawrence himself. The novel received attention in Mexico, where its early reception was positive, and it was praised by the poet [[Octavio Paz]]. However, this response was later displaced by Mexican post-revolutionary nationalism and [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial studies]]. ''The Plumed Serpent'' has been compared to works of Lawrence such as the novels ''[[Kangaroo (novel)|Kangaroo]]'' (1923) and ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' (1928) and the essays ''[[Sketches of Etruscan Places and other Italian essays]]'' (1932), as well as to the work of the poet [[T. S. Eliot]].\n\n==Plot==\n''Note: this description of the plot is based on the version of the book published as The Plumed Serpent, not the version published as Quetzalcoatl.''\n\nShortly after [[Easter]], a group of tourists visiting Mexico, including Kate Leslie, an Irishwoman, and her cousin, Owen Rhys, an American, attend a bullfight in Mexico City. Leslie is thrilled at the prospect of witnessing the fight, but later leaves in disgust, after witnessing the violence suffered by a horse and a bull. As she leaves, she encounters Don Cipriano, a Mexican general, and invites him to meet her.{{sfn|Lawrence|1974|pages=11\u201329}} Later, at a party in Tlacolula which she attends with Rhys, Leslie listens to discussions of changes brought about by the [[Mexican Revolution]], and encounters a Major Law, who states that there is a rumour that the recently elected Mexican President, Socrates Tom\u00e1s Montes of the Labour Party, will be prevented from taking office by the military. She also meets Cipriano's friend Don Ram\u00f3n Carrasco. Soon afterwards, she reads a newspaper report, \"The Gods of Antiquity Return to Mexico\", describing an incident in the village of Sayula, in which a man arose from a lake, then announced to a group of women that the Aztec gods [[Quetzalcoatl]] and [[Tl\u0101loc|Tlaloc]] are ready to return to Mexico. Rhys returns to the United States, but Leslie decides to stay in Mexico. Wanting to leave Mexico City because of rising social tensions, she travels to Sayula, with the encouragement of Cipriano. She learns of a religious movement, the Men of Quetzalcoatl, and, upon making inquiries about it, is told that it was founded by Ram\u00f3n, who is suspected of having political ambitions. Leslie begins to sympathise with Ram\u00f3n, believing him to be a \"great man\". Receiving an invitation from Ram\u00f3n, she meets him and his wife Do\u00f1a Carlota, who tells her that he wants to be worshipped as a god and to destroy the belief of Mexicans in both [[Jesus]] and the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], objectives she deplores.{{sfn|Lawrence|1974|pages=29\u2013180}}\n\nCipriano tells Leslie that he wants to marry her and make her a goddess in a pantheon of deities alongside himself and Ram\u00f3n, explaining that this will help Ram\u00f3n. Leslie at first rejects these proposals and considers leaving Mexico. Meanwhile, the unpopular actions of the new President provoke a rebellion, and the Church moves against Ram\u00f3n, denouncing him as an \"Anti-Christ\". Cipriano continues to support Ram\u00f3n, despite being obliged to defend the Mexican government. Ram\u00f3n tries to remain politically neutral. Cipriano arranges a meeting between Ram\u00f3n and a bishop. Ram\u00f3n tells Cipriano that every people in the world needs its own \"Saviour\", and that the \"Teutonic world\" should return to the worship of [[Thor]] and [[Odin|Wotan]], just as other nations should return to the worship of their ancient gods. When Ram\u00f3n and Cipriano meet the bishop, Ram\u00f3n suggests to him that the [[Catholic Church]] should embrace all gods, including Quetzalcoatl; the bishop rejects this. Ram\u00f3n tells the bishop that he intends to remove images from a church in Sayula, burn them, and replace them with images of Quetzalcoatl; the bishop warns him against this, but Ram\u00f3n remains firm in his plans, and tells the bishop to advise his superiors of them.{{sfn|Lawrence|1974|pages=180\u2013280}}\n\nRam\u00f3n tries to encourage Kate to marry Cipriano, but she still has doubts. He tells her of the dissatisfying nature of his relationship with Carlota, saying that the two of them never \"met in our souls\", and that her faith in Jesus and his role in the Men of Quetzalcoatl now makes this impossible. He explains to Kate that, for him, Quetzalcoatl is a \"symbol of the best a man may be\". Soon afterwards, a priest is attacked after preaching a sermon against Ram\u00f3n and Quetzalcoatl, and later threatened with death. Priests denounce the Men of Quetzalcoatl. The church in Sayula is closed, and later entered by Ram\u00f3n and a group of his followers, who remove images of Jesus, Mary, and several saints. The images are taken away and burned. These events are followed by further incidents of violence and unrest. Kate travels to Jamiltepec, where she meets Ram\u00f3n and tells him that she approves of the removal of images from the church in Sayula. He encourages her to support his movement. When an attempt is made to assassinate Ram\u00f3n, Kate becomes involved in the conflict, and he afterwards credits her intervention with saving his life. One of Ram\u00f3n's followers tells Kate that priests and the Knights of Cort\u00e9s are to blame for the attack.{{sfn|Lawrence|1974|pages=280\u2013319}}\n\nKate meets Ram\u00f3n and Cipriano. Ram\u00f3n tells her that just as he will be identified with Quetzalcoatl, Cipriano will be identified with [[Hu\u012btzil\u014dp\u014dchtli|Huitzilopochtli]]. Kate accepts Cipriano as Huitzilopochtli and they are married by Ram\u00f3n. Afterwards, Kate returns to Sayula, where she learns that the church has been turned into a temple of Quetzalcoatl. A religious meeting presided over by Ram\u00f3n and Cipriano is interrupted by Carlota, who calls on [[God]] to take Ram\u00f3n's life. Carlota collapses and is taken to bed; she subsequently dies. Worship of Quetzalcoatl continues to spread through Mexico; Cipriano wants the President to declare it the official religion of Mexico, but Ram\u00f3n disagrees, believing that it should be allowed to spread of its own accord. Cipriano gives Kate the name \"Malintzi\". Ram\u00f3n later marries a young woman named Teresa. Kate tells first Teresa, then Cipriano, that she wants to leave Mexico. Later, an attempt is made to assassinate the President, and Mexico is taken to the point of religious war. In Mexico City, the Men of Quetzalcoatl turn a church into a Quetzalcoatl temple; the Archbishop of Mexico is arrested before he and his followers can attempt to retake the building for the Catholic Church. Eventually, the President has the Catholic Church made illegal and orders Quetzalcoatl worship made the official religion of Mexico; all churches are closed, and the Archbishop is deported. Kate and Cipriano are legally married. Ram\u00f3n tells Kate to tell the Irish that they should follow their traditional gods and heroes. Kate is left conflicted about whether to leave Mexico or not.{{sfn|Lawrence|1974|pages=319\u2013462}}\n\n==Background and publication history==\n[[File:D H Lawrence passport photograph.jpg|thumb|upright|D. H. Lawrence]]\nIn March 1923, Lawrence, accompanied by the poet [[Witter Bynner]] and Willard Johnson, visited Mexico. There, according to the biographer [[Brenda Maddox]], the \"sight of [[Aztecs|Aztec]] ruins and the lush countryside outside [[Mexico City]]\" gave him the idea for a book. Lawrence began writing ''The Plumed Serpent'' in May 1923. Maddox states that writing the novel was exhausting for Lawrence, and that it \"nearly killed him\", owing to the illness he contracted upon finishing it, which he did not expect to survive. She notes that the character of Owen Rhys was based on Bynner, and that the [[bullfight]] that occurs early in ''The Plumed Serpent'' was based on an actual bullfight Lawrence attended with Bynner and Johnson. She maintains that the bullfight scene reflects the disturbing effect on Lawrence of travelling with Bynner and Johnson, a homosexual couple.{{sfn|Maddox|1994|pages=328\u2013333, 369}}\n\n''The Plumed Serpent'' was first published in 1926 by [[Martin Secker]]'s firm in the United Kingdom and [[Alfred A. Knopf]] in the United States. The novel has also been published by [[Heinemann (publisher)|Heinemann]], [[Penguin Books]], and [[Vintage Books]].{{sfnm|1a1=Moore|1y=1974|1pp=419\u2013420|2a1=Aldington|2y=1974|2p=4|3a1=Tindall|3y=1992|3p=iv}} Lawrence wanted to call the book \"Quetzalcoatl\", after the [[Quetzalcoatl|Aztec god of that name]], but Knopf insisted on \"The Plumed Serpent\", a title Lawrence disliked. An early draft of the book, different enough to be considered a distinct work, was published as ''Quetzalcoatl'' by Black Swan Books in 1995.{{sfn|Martz|1998|pages=iv, ix}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Overview===\nCritics have disagreed about the novel's literary merit, some praising it as Lawrence's best work and others dismissing it. According to John B. Vickery, while most critics admired \"Lawrence's masterful descriptions, his evocation of place and his handling of individual scenes\", many also criticised his \"humorless obsession\" with saving Mexico and the world.{{sfn|Vickery|1963|page=119}} In 1926, Donald Douglas wrote in ''[[The Nation]]'' that Lawrence \"writes and talks like a god.\" He believed that ''The Plumed Serpent'' contained \"passages of miraculous wonder and words like arrows tipped with light borrowed from the sun\" and that \"Lawrence has all his old infallible and inexhaustible knowledge of woman's nature and his Indians bear all the fascination of an alien life perfectly understood.\"{{sfn|Douglas|1926|page=291}} According to F. B. Pinion, the novelist [[E. M. Forster]] regarded ''The Plumed Serpent'' as Lawrence's finest novel. Pinion himself considered it the most ambitious and successful of Lawrence's novels written after ''[[Women in Love]]'' (1920).{{sfn|Pinion|1980|pages=196, 205}} Brett Neilson compared ''The Plumed Serpent'' to ''Women in Love'', arguing that they imagined \"the primitive\" in similar ways and that both involved the theme of an \"eternal conjunction between two men\". He compared Ram\u00f3n to Rupert Birkin, a character of ''Women in Love'', maintaining that they had similar \"sexual philosophies\".{{sfn|Neilson|1997|pages=310\u2013325}} The critics [[F. R. Leavis]] and [[Harold Bloom]] have seen ''The Plumed Serpent'' as inferior to ''Women in Love'', as well as to Lawrence's ''[[The Rainbow]]'' (1915).{{sfn|Leavis|1955|pages=29\u201330, 54, 66\u201367}}{{sfn|Bloom|1995|page=408}} Bloom compared ''The Plumed Serpent'' to the novelist [[Norman Mailer]]'s ''[[Ancient Evenings]]'' (1983), suggesting that it had a similar underlying motive.{{sfn|Bloom|1983|page=3}} He has argued that Lawrence was writing as a political theorist in ''The Plumed Serpent'', which he described as a \"Fascist fiction\".{{sfn|Bloom|1995|page=408}}\n\nThe poet [[Richard Aldington]] described ''The Plumed Serpent'' as \"curious and original\". He compared it to [[Frederick Rolfe]]'s novel ''[[Hadrian the Seventh]]'' (1904), arguing that \"in both books the author imagines himself raised to a position of power which he never had the faintest chance of attaining in fact on this earth.\" He suggested that the novel shows Lawrence's \"dissenting horror from the very things he is supposed to be preaching.\" He interpreted Cipriano and Ram\u00f3n as projections of D. H. Lawrence.{{sfn|Aldington|1974|pages=7\u20139}} The writer [[Anthony Burgess]] maintained that ''The Plumed Serpent'' is the least liked of Lawrence's novels due to its lack of humour and its exploration of a theme of little interest to readers \"with no knowledge of the ancient Aztec gods and what they could mean to a revitalized or Laurentianised Mexico.\" He called its ending unconvincing.{{sfn|Burgess|1985|pages=152\u2013157}} Leavis and Burgess have compared ''The Plumed Serpent'' to ''Kangaroo'',{{sfn|Leavis|1955|pages=29\u201330, 54, 66\u201367}}{{sfn|Burgess|1985|pages=152\u2013157}} Burgess finding the similarity to be their shared emphasis on bloodshed.{{sfn|Burgess|1985|pages=152\u2013157}} Leavis maintained that unlike ''The Rainbow'' and ''Women in Love'', but like ''[[Aaron's Rod (novel)|Aaron's Rod]]'' (1922) and ''Kangaroo'', ''The Plumed Serpent'' was \"exploratory and experimental.\" Though appreciating features such as its bullfight scene, he dismissed it as a bad book and the least complex of Lawrence's novels, arguing that it suffered from his single-minded concern with imagining a \"revival of the ancient Mexican religion.\"{{sfn|Leavis|1955|pages=29\u201330, 54, 66\u201367}} Critics have offered differing interpretations of Kate Leslie.{{sfn|Aldington|1974|pages=7\u20139}}{{sfn|Leavis|1955|pages=29\u201330, 54, 66\u201367}} Aldington and Burgess saw the character as a representation of Frieda Lawrence,{{sfn|Aldington|1974|pages=7\u20139}}{{sfn|Burgess|1985|pages=152\u2013157}} but Leavis maintained that Leslie was not a representation of Frieda Lawrence.{{sfn|Leavis|1955|pages=29\u201330, 54, 66\u201367}} The critic [[Frederick Crews]] argued that the character was simply an opportunity for Lawrence to present \"Lawrentian doctrine.\"{{sfn|Crews|1967|pages=176\u2013177}}\n\n''The Plumed Serpent'' has been criticised by feminist authors such as the philosopher [[Simone de Beauvoir]] and the activist [[Kate Millett]].{{sfn|de Beauvoir|2011|pages=51, 243}}{{sfn|Millett|1990|pages=238, 241, 281\u2013284}} De Beauvoir compared Lawrence's view of [[Human female sexuality|female sexuality]] to that of the physician [[Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n]]. She argued that ''The Plumed Serpent'' was the novel that most fully expressed Lawrence's ideal of female behavior, according to which the \"woman must renounce personal love\" and abdicate all pride and will.{{sfn|de Beauvoir|2011|pages=51, 243}} Millett described the novel as homoerotic. She considered its \"consecration scene\" an example of the \"symbolically surrogate\" scenes of  [[pederasty]] in Lawrence's novels. She suggested that the novel was deservedly neglected, criticising Lawrence's \"protofascist tone\", \"fondness of force\", \"arrogance\", and \"racial, class, and religious bigotries.\" She maintained that the novel showed his search for triumph in politics and other areas of life, and that it records his invention of a religion of \"male supremacy\", with its prose celebrating \"phallic supremacy\". She described Leslie as a \"female impersonator\".{{sfn|Millett|1990|pages=238, 241, 281\u2013284}}\n\nThe English professor Marianna Torgovnick suggested that the novel \"advocates women\u2019s slavelike submission to men and surrender of the drive toward [[orgasm]]\" and suffered from \"overblown prose\". She considered it, like ''Lady Chatterley's Lover'', vulnerable to Millett's criticism.{{sfn|Torgovnick|2015}} Torgovnick saw ''The Plumed Serpent'' and Lawrence's story \"[[The Woman who Rode Away]]\" (1925) as sharing an interest in \"extremes of experience\", and found both similar to the work of writers such as Bataille, and the dramatist [[Antonin Artaud]], in their emphasis on [[human sacrifice]]. She wrote that ''The Plumed Serpent'' \"has been charged with protofascism\", adding that it \"states its racialised theses quite clearly at times. It posts Lawrence's views, derived from theories circulating within his culture, of the fall and rise of races based upon energy and power. Lawrence's fear is specifically the fear that the white race will be supplanted\". She characterised it as being, like ''Aaron's Rod'', part of a phase of Lawrence's career during which he was suspicious of and hostile towards women.{{sfn|Torgovnick|1997|pages=50\u201352, 227}}{{sfn|Torgovnick|2001|pages=37, 46}}\n\nL. D. Clark described ''The Plumed Serpent'' as \"perplexing\". He suggested that the work was both open to misinterpretation, and \"a flagrant piece of propaganda\", intended by Lawrence as a \"new gospel to mankind.\" He believed that it suffered from faults such as \"careless language\", \"wearisome repetitions\", and the \"confusion of practical with artistic ends\"; he considered its \"prophetic aspirations\" a fault as well. However, he considered the novel redeemed by, \"Lawrence's profound sympathy with the land he was writing about, and his uncanny skill at synthesizing form and setting and symbol.\" He argued that Lawrence was influenced by Blavatsky, and that his use of \"bone symbolism\" resembled Blavatsky's in ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' (1888). He suggested that Lawrence's interest in the symbol of the circle resulted in part from his reading of occult writers such as Blavatsky. He concluded that the novel's symbolism endowed it with \"peculiar brilliance.\" He noted that one scene, involving Ram\u00f3n and Cipriano, had been interpreted as evidence of Lawrence's \"[[latent homosexuality]]\", but rejected the interpretation.{{sfn|Clark|1964|pages=v, 4, 13, 96\u201397, 107, 119, 129, 142}}\n\nThe cultural critic [[Philip Rieff]] described the work as \"a novel of pagan religiosity\". Rieff stated that in his \"imaginative rehabilitation\" of Aztec ritual, Lawrence \"rightly understands sun dancing as an imitation \u2014 or a dramatic representation \u2014 performed in substantiation of the divine concern with the human being.\" However, he saw the work as an embarrassment even to Lawrence's admirers.{{sfn|Rieff|1968|pages=213\u2013214}} The critic [[Frank Kermode]] wrote that in 1928 Lawrence accepted Bynner's criticism of the \"leadership mystique\" advocated in the novel.{{sfn|Kermode|1973|page=116}}\n\nLawrence's biographer [[Harry T. Moore]] maintained that the novel could be considered a \"magnificent failure\" and was \"a greater achievement than the smoother work of the lesser authors celebrated at that time.\" He considered its first six chapters to be the best part of the book, writing that they contained \"wonderful prose\". He also noted that the novel sold well.{{sfn|Moore|1974|pages=419\u2013420}} The philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] considered ''The Plumed Serpent'' an example of how the modern \"deployment of sexuality\" has encouraged \"the desire for sex\u2014the desire to have it, to have access to it, to discover it, to liberate it, to articulate it in discourse, to formulate it in truth\".{{sfn|Foucault|1990|pages=152\u2013157}}\n\nThe writer [[Henry Miller]] maintained that Lawrence showed \"great creativity\" in ''The Plumed Serpent'', finding it apparent in the way Lawrence dealt with \"the eternal duality in man's nature\" by deifying it in the form of Quetzalcoatl. He compared its themes to those of Lawrence's ''[[The Escaped Cock|The Man Who Died]]'' (1929), and praised the way in which Lawrence employed \"the old myth of the dragon.\" Miller also stated that the writer [[John Middleton Murry]] considered ''The Plumed Serpent'' Lawrence's greatest work of art.{{sfn|Miller|1985|pages=126\u2013127, 178, 193, 227}} The novelist [[William S. Burroughs]] was influenced by ''The Plumed Serpent''.{{sfn|Morgan|1988|page=561}}\n\nThe Mexican intellectual [[Enrique Krauze]] described ''The Plumed Serpent'' as \"the most fascist\" of Lawrence's writings, citing its \"deification of violence and masculine power\".{{sfn|Krauze|2015}}\n\nThe critic [[William York Tindall]] compared ''The Plumed Serpent'' to the poet [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s ''[[Kubla Khan]]'', [[Gustave Flaubert]]'s ''[[Salammb\u00f4]]'', and the paintings of [[Paul Gauguin]]. He called it a \"great novel\" and \"metaphor for a feeling about reality\".{{sfn|Tindall|1992|pages=v, viii, xiv}} Maddox compared ''The Plumed Serpent'' to ''Kangaroo'', describing both novels as successors to ''Aaron's Rod''. She also compared it to ''Lady Chatterley's Lover'', which likewise features a man who \"condescendingly instructs a woman in how to be a woman.\" She stated that Frieda Lawrence, like D. H. Lawrence, considered it his greatest novel, and shared its message, which Maddox summarized as being that, \"Christianity was outmoded and destructive and that the white races must find new modes of leadership to prevent the dark races from dragging them into anarchy.\" She observed that one scene featuring Ram\u00f3n appearing before a rally evoked the [[Third Reich]] to later readers and encouraged the view that Lawrence was a fascist. She also stated that the work influenced [[Rolf Gardiner]].{{sfn|Maddox|1994|pages=277, 333\u2013334, 365\u2013366, 397, 425}}\n\nThe cultural critic [[William Irwin Thompson]] that the novel shows that Lawrence misunderstood the religion of ancient Mexico.{{sfn|Thompson|1996|page=52}} The English professor [[Louis L. Martz]] stated that ''The Plumed Serpent'' resembles the [[Bible]] in its \"combination of prose and poetry, its mingling of narrative and description with songs and hymns, lyrical sermons and eloquent authorial ruminations, along with its frequent use of [[occult symbols]]\". He found the work a success so long as it is \"read as a novel of prophecy\". However, he found the published version of ''The Plumed Serpent'' in some ways inferior to the early version titled \"Quetzalcoatl\", noting that the early version gave Leslie a more significant role.{{sfn|Martz|1998|pages=ix\u2013xxxi}}\n\nAnne Fernihough described ''The Plumed Serpent'' as \"stridently ideological\",{{sfn|Fernihough|2001|page=9}} while Mark Kinkead-Weekes described it as more \"ideologically elaborated\" and assertive than its early version ''Quetzalcoatl'', adding that Lawrence made a \"deliberate and intransigent\" attack on Christianity. He wrote that most reactions to it were either strongly positive or strongly negative, and stated that Lawrence later rejected \"both the political and the sexual ideology\" of the novel.{{sfn|Kinkead-Weekes|2001|pages=71, 82\u201383}} Helen Sword compared ''The Plumed Serpent'' to ''Lady Chatterley's Lover'', describing them both as novels in which, \"Lawrence uses a woman's voice and consciousness to convey the message that women should submit physically and emotionally to men\",{{sfn|Sword|2001|page=123}} while Paul Eggert described Lawrence's attempt to portray a \"society renovated by a new religion\" as pretentious and strained,{{sfn|Eggert|2001|page=173}} Michael Bell called ''The Plumed Serpent'' strident and desperate in its rhetoric and maintained that, like ''Kangaroo'', it showed sympathy for political authoritarianism,{{sfn|Bell|2001|pages=183, 191}} and Chris Baldick wrote that Leavis's dismissal of ''The Plumed Serpent'' has been accepted by most subsequent critics, including the philosopher [[Eliseo Vivas]] and Julian Moynahan, and become part of a consensus.{{sfn|Baldick|2001|page=261}}\n\nVickery considered it unfair to reduce the novel to a political plan, arguing that Lawrence's central concern was that people were being led \"further and further away from the realization of their own essential nature\", and that Lawrence's own views were different from those of Ram\u00f3n. He considered Lawrence's approach to primitive myth and ritual in ''The Plumed Serpent'' consistent with that he later took in ''Sketches of Etruscan Places and other Italian essays'', maintaining that Lawrence used the character Ram\u00f3n to depict \"the attainment of an integrated personality\". He compared the novel to the poet [[T. S. Eliot]]'s poem ''[[The Waste Land]]'' (1922), observing that both works juxtaposed \"past and present\".{{sfn|Vickery|1963|pages=119\u2013134}}\n\nDonna Przybylowicz maintained that the novel revealed a conflict between contradictory fascist and liberal humanist tendencies within Lawrence's work. She compared Lawrence to Leavis and Eliot, suggesting that like Eliot, Lawrence believed that \"all crises of a capitalistic post-war society of class-conflict could be transcended by ignoring history and replacing it with myth\", although with the difference that Eliot's views were Christian and Lawrence's \"paganistic\". She argued that ''The Plumed Serpent'', by depicting the proletariat and Indian peasants as needing to be controlled by a dictatorial leader, revealed Lawrence as \"basically anti-democratic and anti-socialist\", and that it also presented a \"Western stereotyped notion\" of \"the dark races\" as \"lazy, dirty, resentful, covetous, irresponsible, and aimless\". She believed that Lawrence \"correctly portrays the crisis of Mexican society as resulting from reification and social fragmentation\", but criticised him for repudiating \"revolutionary political change\" and wanting to maintain class divisions.{{sfn|Przybylowicz|1985|pages=289\u2013318}}\n\nLydia Blanchard described the novel as \"puzzling\", and wrote that it was \"infrequently admired even by Lawrence admirers\", with most readers finding it flawed, due to its \"turgid\" language, \"wooden\" characters, and \"improbable\" plot. She observed that it had been seen as a \"prelude to fascism\".{{sfn|Blanchard|1989|pages=518\u2013520}} Karen McLeod Hewitt described the novel as \"unpleasant nonsense\", writing that most of it celebrated \"a disgust for people which is also pretentious.\" However, she praised the \"brief passages\" in which Leslie's reactions to the cruelties of Mexico were \"dramatized with passion\" and showed respect for the character.{{sfn|Hewitt|1989|pages=588\u2013590}}\n\nDavid Carroll maintained that compared to its early version ''Quetzalcoatl'', the novel's published version showed \"more intimate knowledge of Mexican culture\" and explored \"the confrontation of white and red consciousness\" with greater complexity.{{sfn|Carroll|1990|pages=164\u2013166}} Jad Smith wrote that ''The Plumed Serpent'' is often regarded as \"the height of Lawrence\u2019s interest in authoritarian politics\" and was a \"notorious instance of Lawrence\u2019s proto-fascist leanings\". However, he noted that Lawrence subsequently wrote letters, including one to Bynner, \"that appear to repudiate his leadership vision\". He argued that they did not represent a change in Lawrence's views, and stressed that Lawrence did not necessarily endorse fascist politics, despite the presence of \"proto-fascist ideologies\" in the novel and its racism. He also argued that it reflected \"Lawrence\u2019s familiarity with German thought and culture\".{{sfn|Smith|2002|pages=7\u201324}}\n\nDuane Edwards described the novel as Lawrence's \"most profound expression of what the human psyche is\", and suggested that it prepared the way for Lawrence's later novel ''Lady Chatterley's Lover''. He maintained that it was disturbing because it \"makes readers aware of their primitive, pre-conscious self, which connects them with their most ancient ancestors\". He observed that the novel had received a more negative response than any other work by Lawrence, finding it surprising that it had \"so many detractors.\" He disputed the characterisation of the work as racist and fascist, maintaining that Lawrence's views should not be confused with those of his characters Cipriano and Ram\u00f3n.{{sfn|Edwards|2010|pages=183\u2013199}} Julianne Newmark compared the novel to [[Willa Cather]]'s ''[[The Professor's House]]'' (1925), arguing that both were inspired by \"engagement with evocative American places\u2014specifically the high deserts and rugged expanses of the American southwest\" and are concerned with \"the ways place constitutes new identities.\" She questioned the charge that ''The Plumed Serpent'' is racist and that Lawrence's views resembled those of \"white supremacists\".{{sfn|Newmark|2010|pages=89\u2013120}} Damien Barlow wrote that \"a queer approach to reading Lawrence's modernist fiction\" has been proposed.{{sfn|Barlow|2012|pages=18\u201332}}\n\nArmando Pereira maintained that the novel reflected Lawrence's desire to \"live in a creative way and free of the oppressive rationality, anxiety of technique and obsession of progress that had swallowed Europe up.\"{{sfn|Pereira|2013|pages=65\u201390}} Nora Marisa Le\u00f3n-Real M\u00e9ndez argued that Lawrence \"confers significant meaning to the landmarks, constructing a narrative space that is particular as well as linked to the Mexico outside the text.\"{{sfn|Le\u00f3n-Real M\u00e9ndez|2014|pages=545\u2013562}} Camelia Raghinaru argued that there was a connection between Lawrence's interest in the [[Kabbalah]], which may have developed from his reading, early in the 20th century, of the occultist, and founder of the [[Theosophical Society]], [[Helena Blavatsky]], and his development of a \"messianic utopia\" in ''The Plumed Serpent''. She saw the novel as dealing with \"magical and mystical secrets whose purpose is to enact a messianic eschatology\" and believed that it revealed Lawrence's preoccupation with \"femininity and its mystical significance.\" She wrote that Lawrence saw ''The Plumed Serpent'' as \"a magical incantation\" intended to \"change the world\". She interpreted the novel in terms of the philosopher [[Julia Kristeva]]'s emphasis on [[abjection]] in ''[[Powers of Horror]]'' (1980), and maintained that it emphasised \"male sexuality and female submission\".{{sfn|Raghinaru|2014|pages=20\u201343}}\n\nLuis G\u00f3mez Romero compared the novel to ''Kangaroo'', writing that in both works Lawrence, \"exposes the advent of discrete crises resulting from the failure of human ideals and institutions to prevent and tame violence.\" He noted that critics had often regarded the work as a \"direct expression of Lawrence\u2019s proto-fascist propensities.\" He questioned the view that its plot had little to do with actual Mexican politics, arguing that it should be viewed \"in a specifically Mexican context.\" He also observed that the early reception of ''The Plumed Serpent'' in Mexico was positive, citing the views of the newspaper ''[[Exc\u00e9lsior]]'' and the poet [[Bernardo Ortiz de Montellano]], who both credited Lawrence with understanding Mexico and the Mexicans. He also noted the similar appreciative views of the intellectual [[Antonio Castro Leal]] and the poet [[Octavio Paz]]. However, he stated that \"Mexican post-revolutionary nationalism and the rise of post-colonial studies\" later displaced such positive views of the novel in Mexico. He noted the poet [[Jos\u00e9 Juan Tablada]]'s accusation of plagiarism against Lawrence, but discounted it, writing that ''The Plumed Serpent'' had little in common with Tablada's ''La Resurrecci\u00f3n de los \u00cddolos'' (1924).{{sfn|Romero|2014|pages=232\u2013260}} Vladimiro Rivas Iturralde  maintained that Lawrence wrote about \"the transformation of man in myth\" in an \"improbable way\" and that ''The Plumed Serpent'' was an \"artistic failure.\"{{sfn|Rivas Iturralde|2017|pages=17\u201328}}\n\nDebra A. Castillo compared the novel to the anthropologist [[Tobias Schneebaum]]'s ''Keep the River on Your Right'' (1969) and the work of the intellectual [[Georges Bataille]]. She maintained that it \"stands out among the hundreds of novels and stories written by Anglo-Americans and set in Mexico for the particular forcefulness of Lawrence's obsession with, and equally forceful rejection of, that country and its people.\" She considered the work racist, and deemed it unsurprising that Lawrence considered it his best novel, arguing that he did so because he found Mexico, as a foreign society, an ideal subject on which to project his personal \"obsessions\". Nevertheless, she believed that the novel contained valuable insights into the state of Mexico after the Mexican Revolution. She noted that of those Mexican writers who had discussed the novel, the poet [[Jos\u00e9 Emilio Pacheco]] warned against its \"proto-fascism\", while Paz praised its \"depiction of landscape\".{{sfn|Castillo|1995|pages=35\u201373}} David Barnes noted that while Lawrence regarded the novel as his most important, he made little reference to it after its publication, and that it is usually held that he later rejected its themes for new concerns in the late 1920s, expressed in works such as ''Lady Chatterley's Lover''. He criticised the novel's \"misogyny\", \"authoritarian politics\", and \"racial essentialism\", but nevertheless saw it as part of an important \"political debate about what forms of nationhood might emerge in the 1920s\" and showed awareness of \"the possibilities of nation as utopian community.\" He maintained that while Bynner's negative judgment of the novel, expressed in his memoir ''Journeys with Genius'', had affected its reputation, Lawrence was more interested in \"Mexican revolutionary culture\" than Bynner's comments suggested. He argued that the novel's themes were to some extent similar to those of ''Lady Chatterley's Lover''. He also compared the novel to ''Kangaroo'' and ''Sketches of Etruscan Places and other Italian essays''.{{sfn|Barnes|2017|pages=674\u2013693}}\n\nShirley Bricourt argued that episodes in the novel such as the bullfight scene depict rites that both \"act as catalysers of emotions\" and \"travesty these emotions as a submissive but passionate response.\" She compared the novel to ''Kangaroo''.{{sfn|Bricourt|2011|pages=239\u2013254}} Juliette Feyel compared ''The Plumed Serpent'' to ''Kangaroo'', describing them as Lawrence's \"most explicitly political novels\". She compared both work's to ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'' (1930), by [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of [[psychoanalysis]], maintaining that Lawrence and Freud both \"correlate individual neurosis with civilization.\"{{sfn|Feyel|2014|pages=107\u2013124}}\n\n===Reviews===\nAccording to Moore, ''The Plumed Serpent'' received negative reviews from P. C. Kennedy in the ''[[New Statesman]]'', the journalist [[Katherine Anne Porter]] in the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', and the novelist [[L. P. Hartley]] in the ''[[Saturday Review (London newspaper)|Saturday Review]]'', with additional negative reviews appearing in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', which described the novel as \"feeble\", and ''[[The Spectator]]'', which described it as \"verbose\". However, Moore writes that it received a more mixed assessment, discussing both its good and bad aspects, from the poet [[Edwin Muir]] in ''[[The Nation and Athenaeum]]''.{{sfn|Moore|1974|page=419}} Maddox writes that the novel received a negative review from Charles Marriott in ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'', who deplored its failure to produce convincing characterizations, a response similar to that of Hartley in the ''Saturday Review''. According to Maddox, Porter considered the novel inferior to Lawrence's earlier work ''[[Sons and Lovers]]'' (1913), and believed that the difference in quality between the two works showed \"the catastrophe that has overtaken Lawrence.\"{{sfn|Maddox|1994|page=387}}\n\n''The Plumed Serpent'' received a mixed review from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', which described it as \"a strange, compelling state of affairs rather than a story\", and wrote that it reflected the \"physico-mysticism\", and preoccupation with sexual psychology, of its author. ''Time'' wrote that Lawrence's work \"moves many profoundly, puzzles others, and revolts the squeamish.\"{{sfn|''Time''|1926|page=40}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aztec mythology in popular culture]]\n* [[Fascism]]\n* ''[[Mornings in Mexico]]''\n* [[Polytheistic reconstructionism]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n;Books\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Aldington|first1=Richard |chapter=Introduction |title=The Plumed Serpent |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |location=Harmondsworth |year=1974 |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Baldick|first1=Chris |chapter=Post-mortem: Lawrence's critical and cultural legacy |editor-last1=Fernihough|editor-first1=Anne  |title=The Cambridge Companion to D.

H. Lawrence]]; Lawrence conceived the idea for the novel while visiting [[Mexico]] in 1923, and its themes reflect his experiences there. The novel was first published by [[Martin Secker]]'s firm in the United Kingdom and [[Alfred A. Knopf]] in the United States; an early draft was published as '''''Quetzalcoatl''''' by Black Swan Books in 1995. The novel's plot concerns Kate Leslie, an Irish tourist who visits Mexico after the [[Mexican Revolution]]. She encounters Don Cipriano, a Mexican general who supports a religious movement, the Men of Quetzalcoatl, founded by his friend Don Ram\u00f3n Carrasco. Within this movement, Cipriano is identified with [[Hu\u012btzil\u014dp\u014dchtli|Huitzilopochtli]] and Ram\u00f3n with [[Quetzalcoatl]]. Kate eventually agrees to marry Cipriano, while the Men of Quetzalcoatl, with the help of a new President, bring about an end to [[Christianity]] in Mexico, replacing it with Quetzalcoatl worship.\n\nThe novel received negative reviews. Commentators have characterised it as fascist and an attack on Christianity, and seen it as expressing Lawrence's fears about the decline of the [[white race]] and belief in women's submission to men. It has also been interpreted as an expression of his personal political ambition and as having [[Homoeroticism|homoerotic]] aspects. Critics have disagreed about its literary merit. Some have found it inferior to his other work, but others have considered it his greatest accomplishment as a novelist, an assessment shared by Lawrence himself. The novel received attention in Mexico, where its early reception was positive, and it was praised by the poet [[Octavio Paz]]. However, this response was later displaced by Mexican post-revolutionary nationalism and [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial studies]]. ''The Plumed Serpent'' has been compared to works of Lawrence such as the novels ''[[Kangaroo (novel)|Kangaroo]]'' (1923) and ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' (1928) and the essays ''[[Sketches of Etruscan Places and other Italian essays]]'' (1932), as well as to the work of the poet [[T. S. Eliot]].\n\n==Plot==\n''Note: this description of the plot is based on the version of the book published as The Plumed Serpent, not the version published as Quetzalcoatl.''\n\nShortly after [[Easter]], a group of tourists visiting Mexico, including Kate Leslie, an Irishwoman, and her cousin, Owen Rhys, an American, attend a bullfight in Mexico City. Leslie is thrilled at the prospect of witnessing the fight, but later leaves in disgust, after witnessing the violence suffered by a horse and a bull. As she leaves, she encounters Don Cipriano, a Mexican general, and invites him to meet her.{{sfn|Lawrence|1974|pages=11\u201329}} Later, at a party in Tlacolula which she attends with Rhys, Leslie listens to discussions of changes brought about by the [[Mexican Revolution]], and encounters a Major Law, who states that there is a rumour that the recently elected Mexican President, Socrates Tom\u00e1s Montes of the Labour Party, will be prevented from taking office by the military. She also meets Cipriano's friend Don Ram\u00f3n Carrasco. Soon afterwards, she reads a newspaper report, \"The Gods of Antiquity Return to Mexico\", describing an incident in the village of Sayula, in which a man arose from a lake, then announced to a group of women that the Aztec gods [[Quetzalcoatl]] and [[Tl\u0101loc|Tlaloc]] are ready to return to Mexico. Rhys returns to the United States, but Leslie decides to stay in Mexico. Wanting to leave Mexico City because of rising social tensions, she travels to Sayula, with the encouragement of Cipriano. She learns of a religious movement, the Men of Quetzalcoatl, and, upon making inquiries about it, is told that it was founded by Ram\u00f3n, who is suspected of having political ambitions. Leslie begins to sympathise with Ram\u00f3n, believing him to be a \"great man\". Receiving an invitation from Ram\u00f3n, she meets him and his wife Do\u00f1a Carlota, who tells her that he wants to be worshipped as a god and to destroy the belief of Mexicans in both [[Jesus]] and the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], objectives she deplores.{{sfn|Lawrence|1974|pages=29\u2013180}}\n\nCipriano tells Leslie that he wants to marry her and make her a goddess in a pantheon of deities alongside himself and Ram\u00f3n, explaining that this will help Ram\u00f3n. Leslie at first rejects these proposals and considers leaving Mexico. Meanwhile, the unpopular actions of the new President provoke a rebellion, and the Church moves against Ram\u00f3n, denouncing him as an \"Anti-Christ\". Cipriano continues to support Ram\u00f3n, despite being obliged to defend the Mexican government. Ram\u00f3n tries to remain politically neutral. Cipriano arranges a meeting between Ram\u00f3n and a bishop. Ram\u00f3n tells Cipriano that every people in the world needs its own \"Saviour\", and that the \"Teutonic world\" should return to the worship of [[Thor]] and [[Odin|Wotan]], just as other nations should return to the worship of their ancient gods. When Ram\u00f3n and Cipriano meet the bishop, Ram\u00f3n suggests to him that the [[Catholic Church]] should embrace all gods, including Quetzalcoatl; the bishop rejects this. Ram\u00f3n tells the bishop that he intends to remove images from a church in Sayula, burn them, and replace them with images of Quetzalcoatl; the bishop warns him against this, but Ram\u00f3n remains firm in his plans, and tells the bishop to advise his superiors of them.{{sfn|Lawrence|1974|pages=180\u2013280}}\n\nRam\u00f3n tries to encourage Kate to marry Cipriano, but she still has doubts. He tells her of the dissatisfying nature of his relationship with Carlota, saying that the two of them never \"met in our souls\", and that her faith in Jesus and his role in the Men of Quetzalcoatl now makes this impossible. He explains to Kate that, for him, Quetzalcoatl is a \"symbol of the best a man may be\". Soon afterwards, a priest is attacked after preaching a sermon against Ram\u00f3n and Quetzalcoatl, and later threatened with death. Priests denounce the Men of Quetzalcoatl. The church in Sayula is closed, and later entered by Ram\u00f3n and a group of his followers, who remove images of Jesus, Mary, and several saints. The images are taken away and burned. These events are followed by further incidents of violence and unrest. Kate travels to Jamiltepec, where she meets Ram\u00f3n and tells him that she approves of the removal of images from the church in Sayula. He encourages her to support his movement. When an attempt is made to assassinate Ram\u00f3n, Kate becomes involved in the conflict, and he afterwards credits her intervention with saving his life. One of Ram\u00f3n's followers tells Kate that priests and the Knights of Cort\u00e9s are to blame for the attack.{{sfn|Lawrence|1974|pages=280\u2013319}}\n\nKate meets Ram\u00f3n and Cipriano. Ram\u00f3n tells her that just as he will be identified with Quetzalcoatl, Cipriano will be identified with [[Hu\u012btzil\u014dp\u014dchtli|Huitzilopochtli]]. Kate accepts Cipriano as Huitzilopochtli and they are married by Ram\u00f3n. Afterwards, Kate returns to Sayula, where she learns that the church has been turned into a temple of Quetzalcoatl. A religious meeting presided over by Ram\u00f3n and Cipriano is interrupted by Carlota, who calls on [[God]] to take Ram\u00f3n's life. Carlota collapses and is taken to bed; she subsequently dies. Worship of Quetzalcoatl continues to spread through Mexico; Cipriano wants the President to declare it the official religion of Mexico, but Ram\u00f3n disagrees, believing that it should be allowed to spread of its own accord. Cipriano gives Kate the name \"Malintzi\". Ram\u00f3n later marries a young woman named Teresa. Kate tells first Teresa, then Cipriano, that she wants to leave Mexico. Later, an attempt is made to assassinate the President, and Mexico is taken to the point of religious war. In Mexico City, the Men of Quetzalcoatl turn a church into a Quetzalcoatl temple; the Archbishop of Mexico is arrested before he and his followers can attempt to retake the building for the Catholic Church. Eventually, the President has the Catholic Church made illegal and orders Quetzalcoatl worship made the official religion of Mexico; all churches are closed, and the Archbishop is deported. Kate and Cipriano are legally married. Ram\u00f3n tells Kate to tell the Irish that they should follow their traditional gods and heroes. Kate is left conflicted about whether to leave Mexico or not.{{sfn|Lawrence|1974|pages=319\u2013462}}\n\n==Background and publication history==\n[[File:D H Lawrence passport photograph.jpg|thumb|upright|D. H. Lawrence]]\nIn March 1923, Lawrence, accompanied by the poet [[Witter Bynner]] and Willard Johnson, visited Mexico. There, according to the biographer [[Brenda Maddox]], the \"sight of [[Aztecs|Aztec]] ruins and the lush countryside outside [[Mexico City]]\" gave him the idea for a book. Lawrence began writing ''The Plumed Serpent'' in May 1923. Maddox states that writing the novel was exhausting for Lawrence, and that it \"nearly killed him\", owing to the illness he contracted upon finishing it, which he did not expect to survive. She notes that the character of Owen Rhys was based on Bynner, and that the [[bullfight]] that occurs early in ''The Plumed Serpent'' was based on an actual bullfight Lawrence attended with Bynner and Johnson. She maintains that the bullfight scene reflects the disturbing effect on Lawrence of travelling with Bynner and Johnson, a homosexual couple.{{sfn|Maddox|1994|pages=328\u2013333, 369}}\n\n''The Plumed Serpent'' was first published in 1926 by [[Martin Secker]]'s firm in the United Kingdom and [[Alfred A. Knopf]] in the United States. The novel has also been published by [[Heinemann (publisher)|Heinemann]], [[Penguin Books]], and [[Vintage Books]].{{sfnm|1a1=Moore|1y=1974|1pp=419\u2013420|2a1=Aldington|2y=1974|2p=4|3a1=Tindall|3y=1992|3p=iv}} Lawrence wanted to call the book \"Quetzalcoatl\", after the [[Quetzalcoatl|Aztec god of that name]], but Knopf insisted on \"The Plumed Serpent\", a title Lawrence disliked. An early draft of the book, different enough to be considered a distinct work, was published as ''Quetzalcoatl'' by Black Swan Books in 1995.{{sfn|Martz|1998|pages=iv, ix}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Overview===\nCritics have disagreed about the novel's literary merit, some praising it as Lawrence's best work and others dismissing it. According to John B. Vickery, while most critics admired \"Lawrence's masterful descriptions, his evocation of place and his handling of individual scenes\", many also criticised his \"humorless obsession\" with saving Mexico and the world.{{sfn|Vickery|1963|page=119}} In 1926, Donald Douglas wrote in ''[[The Nation]]'' that Lawrence \"writes and talks like a god.\" He believed that ''The Plumed Serpent'' contained \"passages of miraculous wonder and words like arrows tipped with light borrowed from the sun\" and that \"Lawrence has all his old infallible and inexhaustible knowledge of woman's nature and his Indians bear all the fascination of an alien life perfectly understood.\"{{sfn|Douglas|1926|page=291}} According to F. B. Pinion, the novelist [[E. M. Forster]] regarded ''The Plumed Serpent'' as Lawrence's finest novel. Pinion himself considered it the most ambitious and successful of Lawrence's novels written after ''[[Women in Love]]'' (1920).{{sfn|Pinion|1980|pages=196, 205}} Brett Neilson compared ''The Plumed Serpent'' to ''Women in Love'', arguing that they imagined \"the primitive\" in similar ways and that both involved the theme of an \"eternal conjunction between two men\". He compared Ram\u00f3n to Rupert Birkin, a character of ''Women in Love'', maintaining that they had similar \"sexual philosophies\".{{sfn|Neilson|1997|pages=310\u2013325}} The critics [[F. R. Leavis]] and [[Harold Bloom]] have seen ''The Plumed Serpent'' as inferior to ''Women in Love'', as well as to Lawrence's ''[[The Rainbow]]'' (1915).{{sfn|Leavis|1955|pages=29\u201330, 54, 66\u201367}}{{sfn|Bloom|1995|page=408}} Bloom compared ''The Plumed Serpent'' to the novelist [[Norman Mailer]]'s ''[[Ancient Evenings]]'' (1983), suggesting that it had a similar underlying motive.{{sfn|Bloom|1983|page=3}} He has argued that Lawrence was writing as a political theorist in ''The Plumed Serpent'', which he described as a \"Fascist fiction\".{{sfn|Bloom|1995|page=408}}\n\nThe poet [[Richard Aldington]] described ''The Plumed Serpent'' as \"curious and original\". He compared it to [[Frederick Rolfe]]'s novel ''[[Hadrian the Seventh]]'' (1904), arguing that \"in both books the author imagines himself raised to a position of power which he never had the faintest chance of attaining in fact on this earth.\" He suggested that the novel shows Lawrence's \"dissenting horror from the very things he is supposed to be preaching.\" He interpreted Cipriano and Ram\u00f3n as projections of D. H. Lawrence.{{sfn|Aldington|1974|pages=7\u20139}} The writer [[Anthony Burgess]] maintained that ''The Plumed Serpent'' is the least liked of Lawrence's novels due to its lack of humour and its exploration of a theme of little interest to readers \"with no knowledge of the ancient Aztec gods and what they could mean to a revitalized or Laurentianised Mexico.\" He called its ending unconvincing.{{sfn|Burgess|1985|pages=152\u2013157}} Leavis and Burgess have compared ''The Plumed Serpent'' to ''Kangaroo'',{{sfn|Leavis|1955|pages=29\u201330, 54, 66\u201367}}{{sfn|Burgess|1985|pages=152\u2013157}} Burgess finding the similarity to be their shared emphasis on bloodshed.{{sfn|Burgess|1985|pages=152\u2013157}} Leavis maintained that unlike ''The Rainbow'' and ''Women in Love'', but like ''[[Aaron's Rod (novel)|Aaron's Rod]]'' (1922) and ''Kangaroo'', ''The Plumed Serpent'' was \"exploratory and experimental.\" Though appreciating features such as its bullfight scene, he dismissed it as a bad book and the least complex of Lawrence's novels, arguing that it suffered from his single-minded concern with imagining a \"revival of the ancient Mexican religion.\"{{sfn|Leavis|1955|pages=29\u201330, 54, 66\u201367}} Critics have offered differing interpretations of Kate Leslie.{{sfn|Aldington|1974|pages=7\u20139}}{{sfn|Leavis|1955|pages=29\u201330, 54, 66\u201367}} Aldington and Burgess saw the character as a representation of Frieda Lawrence,{{sfn|Aldington|1974|pages=7\u20139}}{{sfn|Burgess|1985|pages=152\u2013157}} but Leavis maintained that Leslie was not a representation of Frieda Lawrence.{{sfn|Leavis|1955|pages=29\u201330, 54, 66\u201367}} The critic [[Frederick Crews]] argued that the character was simply an opportunity for Lawrence to present \"Lawrentian doctrine.\"{{sfn|Crews|1967|pages=176\u2013177}}\n\n''The Plumed Serpent'' has been criticised by feminist authors such as the philospher [[Simone de Beauvoir]] and the activist [[Kate Millett]].{{sfn|de Beauvoir|2011|pages=51, 243}}{{sfn|Millett|1990|pages=238, 241, 281\u2013284}} De Beauvoir compared Lawrence's view of [[Human female sexuality|female sexuality]] to that of the physician [[Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n]]. She argued that ''The Plumed Serpent'' was the novel that most fully expressed Lawrence's ideal of female behavior, according to which the \"woman must renounce personal love\" and abdicate all pride and will.{{sfn|de Beauvoir|2011|pages=51, 243}} Millett described the novel as homoerotic. She considered its \"consecration scene\" an example of the \"symbolically surrogate\" scenes of  [[pederasty]] in Lawrence's novels. She suggested that the novel was deservedly neglected, criticising Lawrence's \"protofascist tone\", \"fondness of force\", \"arrogance\", and \"racial, class, and religious bigotries.\" She maintained that the novel showed his search for triumph in politics and other areas of life, and that it records his invention of a religion of \"male supremacy\", with its prose celebrating \"phallic supremacy\". She described Leslie as a \"female impersonator\".{{sfn|Millett|1990|pages=238, 241, 281\u2013284}}\n\nThe English professor Marianna Torgovnick suggested that the novel \"advocates women\u2019s slavelike submission to men and surrender of the drive toward [[orgasm]]\" and suffered from \"overblown prose\". She considered it, like ''Lady Chatterley's Lover'', vulnerable to Millett's criticism.{{sfn|Torgovnick|2015}} Torgovnick saw ''The Plumed Serpent'' and Lawrence's story \"[[The Woman who Rode Away]]\" (1925) as sharing an interest in \"extremes of experience\", and found both similar to the work of writers such as Bataille, and the dramatist [[Antonin Artaud]], in their emphasis on [[human sacrifice]]. She wrote that ''The Plumed Serpent'' \"has been charged with protofascism\", adding that it \"states its racialised theses quite clearly at times. It posts Lawrence's views, derived from theories circulating within his culture, of the fall and rise of races based upon energy and power. Lawrence's fear is specifically the fear that the white race will be supplanted\". She characterised it as being, like ''Aaron's Rod'', part of a phase of Lawrence's career during which he was suspicious of and hostile towards women.{{sfn|Torgovnick|1997|pages=50\u201352, 227}}{{sfn|Torgovnick|2001|pages=37, 46}}\n\nL. D. Clark described ''The Plumed Serpent'' as \"perplexing\". He suggested that the work was both open to misinterpretation, and \"a flagrant piece of propaganda\", intended by Lawrence as a \"new gospel to mankind.\" He believed that it suffered from faults such as \"careless language\", \"wearisome repetitions\", and the \"confusion of practical with artistic ends\"; he considered its \"prophetic aspirations\" a fault as well. However, he considered the novel redeemed by, \"Lawrence's profound sympathy with the land he was writing about, and his uncanny skill at synthesizing form and setting and symbol.\" He argued that Lawrence was influenced by Blavatsky, and that his use of \"bone symbolism\" resembled Blavatsky's in ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' (1888). He suggested that Lawrence's interest in the symbol of the circle resulted in part from his reading of occult writers such as Blavatsky. He concluded that the novel's symbolism endowed it with \"peculiar brilliance.\" He noted that one scene, involving Ram\u00f3n and Cipriano, had been interpreted as evidence of Lawrence's \"[[latent homosexuality]]\", but rejected the interpretation.{{sfn|Clark|1964|pages=v, 4, 13, 96\u201397, 107, 119, 129, 142}}\n\nThe cultural critic [[Philip Rieff]] described the work as \"a novel of pagan religiosity\". Rieff stated that in his \"imaginative rehabilitation\" of Aztec ritual, Lawrence \"rightly understands sun dancing as an imitation \u2014 or a dramatic representation \u2014 performed in substantiation of the divine concern with the human being.\" However, he saw the work as an embarrassment even to Lawrence's admirers.{{sfn|Rieff|1968|pages=213\u2013214}} The critic [[Frank Kermode]] wrote that in 1928 Lawrence accepted Bynner's criticism of the \"leadership mystique\" advocated in the novel.{{sfn|Kermode|1973|page=116}}\n\nLawrence's biographer [[Harry T. Moore]] maintained that the novel could be considered a \"magnificent failure\" and was \"a greater achievement than the smoother work of the lesser authors celebrated at that time.\" He considered its first six chapters to be the best part of the book, writing that they contained \"wonderful prose\". He also noted that the novel sold well.{{sfn|Moore|1974|pages=419\u2013420}} The philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] considered ''The Plumed Serpent'' an example of how the modern \"deployment of sexuality\" has encouraged \"the desire for sex\u2014the desire to have it, to have access to it, to discover it, to liberate it, to articulate it in discourse, to formulate it in truth\".{{sfn|Foucault|1990|pages=152\u2013157}}\n\nThe writer [[Henry Miller]] maintained that Lawrence showed \"great creativity\" in ''The Plumed Serpent'', finding it apparent in the way Lawrence dealt with \"the eternal duality in man's nature\" by deifying it in the form of Quetzalcoatl. He compared its themes to those of Lawrence's ''[[The Escaped Cock|The Man Who Died]]'' (1929), and praised the way in which Lawrence employed \"the old myth of the dragon.\" Miller also stated that the writer [[John Middleton Murry]] considered ''The Plumed Serpent'' Lawrence's greatest work of art.{{sfn|Miller|1985|pages=126\u2013127, 178, 193, 227}} The novelist [[William S. Burroughs]] was influenced by ''The Plumed Serpent''.{{sfn|Morgan|1988|page=561}}\n\nThe Mexican intellectual [[Enrique Krauze]] described ''The Plumed Serpent'' as \"the most fascist\" of Lawrence's writings, citing its \"deification of violence and masculine power\".{{sfn|Krauze|2015}}\n\nThe critic [[William York Tindall]] compared ''The Plumed Serpent'' to the poet [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s ''[[Kubla Khan]]'', [[Gustave Flaubert]]'s ''[[Salammb\u00f4]]'', and the paintings of [[Paul Gauguin]]. He called it a \"great novel\" and \"metaphor for a feeling about reality\".{{sfn|Tindall|1992|pages=v, viii, xiv}} Maddox compared ''The Plumed Serpent'' to ''Kangaroo'', describing both novels as successors to ''Aaron's Rod''. She also compared it to ''Lady Chatterley's Lover'', which likewise features a man who \"condescendingly instructs a woman in how to be a woman.\" She stated that Frieda Lawrence, like D. H. Lawrence, considered it his greatest novel, and shared its message, which Maddox summarized as being that, \"Christianity was outmoded and destructive and that the white races must find new modes of leadership to prevent the dark races from dragging them into anarchy.\" She observed that one scene featuring Ram\u00f3n appearing before a rally evoked the [[Third Reich]] to later readers and encouraged the view that Lawrence was a fascist. She also stated that the work influenced [[Rolf Gardiner]].{{sfn|Maddox|1994|pages=277, 333\u2013334, 365\u2013366, 397, 425}}\n\nThe cultural critic [[William Irwin Thompson]] that the novel shows that Lawrence misunderstood the religion of ancient Mexico.{{sfn|Thompson|1996|page=52}} The English professor [[Louis L. Martz]] stated that ''The Plumed Serpent'' resembles the [[Bible]] in its \"combination of prose and poetry, its mingling of narrative and description with songs and hymns, lyrical sermons and eloquent authorial ruminations, along with its frequent use of [[occult symbols]]\". He found the work a success so long as it is \"read as a novel of prophecy\". However, he found the published version of ''The Plumed Serpent'' in some ways inferior to the early version titled \"Quetzalcoatl\", noting that the early version gave Leslie a more significant role.{{sfn|Martz|1998|pages=ix\u2013xxxi}}\n\nAnne Fernihough described ''The Plumed Serpent'' as \"stridently ideological\",{{sfn|Fernihough|2001|page=9}} while Mark Kinkead-Weekes described it as more \"ideologically elaborated\" and assertive than its early version ''Quetzalcoatl'', adding that Lawrence made a \"deliberate and intransigent\" attack on Christianity. He wrote that most reactions to it were either strongly positive or strongly negative, and stated that Lawrence later rejected \"both the political and the sexual ideology\" of the novel.{{sfn|Kinkead-Weekes|2001|pages=71, 82\u201383}} Helen Sword compared ''The Plumed Serpent'' to ''Lady Chatterley's Lover'', describing them both as novels in which, \"Lawrence uses a woman's voice and consciousness to convey the message that women should submit physically and emotionally to men\",{{sfn|Sword|2001|page=123}} while Paul Eggert described Lawrence's attempt to portray a \"society renovated by a new religion\" as pretentious and strained,{{sfn|Eggert|2001|page=173}} Michael Bell called ''The Plumed Serpent'' strident and desperate in its rhetoric and maintained that, like ''Kangaroo'', it showed sympathy for political authoritarianism,{{sfn|Bell|2001|pages=183, 191}} and Chris Baldick wrote that Leavis's dismissal of ''The Plumed Serpent'' has been accepted by most subsequent critics, including the philosopher [[Eliseo Vivas]] and Julian Moynahan, and become part of a consensus.{{sfn|Baldick|2001|page=261}}\n\nVickery considered it unfair to reduce the novel to a political plan, arguing that Lawrence's central concern was that people were being led \"further and further away from the realization of their own essential nature\", and that Lawrence's own views were different from those of Ram\u00f3n. He considered Lawrence's approach to primitive myth and ritual in ''The Plumed Serpent'' consistent with that he later took in ''Sketches of Etruscan Places and other Italian essays'', maintaining that Lawrence used the character Ram\u00f3n to depict \"the attainment of an integrated personality\". He compared the novel to the poet [[T. S. Eliot]]'s poem ''[[The Waste Land]]'' (1922), observing that both works juxtaposed \"past and present\".{{sfn|Vickery|1963|pages=119\u2013134}}\n\nDonna Przybylowicz maintained that the novel revealed a conflict between contradictory fascist and liberal humanist tendencies within Lawrence's work. She compared Lawrence to Leavis and Eliot, suggesting that like Eliot, Lawrence believed that \"all crises of a capitalistic post-war society of class-conflict could be transcended by ignoring history and replacing it with myth\", although with the difference that Eliot's views were Christian and Lawrence's \"paganistic\". She argued that ''The Plumed Serpent'', by depicting the proletariat and Indian peasants as needing to be controlled by a dictatorial leader, revealed Lawrence as \"basically anti-democratic and anti-socialist\", and that it also presented a \"Western stereotyped notion\" of \"the dark races\" as \"lazy, dirty, resentful, covetous, irresponsible, and aimless\". She believed that Lawrence \"correctly portrays the crisis of Mexican society as resulting from reification and social fragmentation\", but criticised him for repudiating \"revolutionary political change\" and wanting to maintain class divisions.{{sfn|Przybylowicz|1985|pages=289\u2013318}}\n\nLydia Blanchard described the novel as \"puzzling\", and wrote that it was \"infrequently admired even by Lawrence admirers\", with most readers finding it flawed, due to its \"turgid\" language, \"wooden\" characters, and \"improbable\" plot. She observed that it had been seen as a \"prelude to fascism\".{{sfn|Blanchard|1989|pages=518\u2013520}} Karen McLeod Hewitt described the novel as \"unpleasant nonsense\", writing that most of it celebrated \"a disgust for people which is also pretentious.\" However, she praised the \"brief passages\" in which Leslie's reactions to the cruelties of Mexico were \"dramatized with passion\" and showed respect for the character.{{sfn|Hewitt|1989|pages=588\u2013590}}\n\nDavid Carroll maintained that compared to its early version ''Quetzalcoatl'', the novel's published version showed \"more intimate knowledge of Mexican culture\" and explored \"the confrontation of white and red consciousness\" with greater complexity.{{sfn|Carroll|1990|pages=164\u2013166}} Jad Smith wrote that ''The Plumed Serpent'' is often regarded as \"the height of Lawrence\u2019s interest in authoritarian politics\" and was a \"notorious instance of Lawrence\u2019s proto-fascist leanings\". However, he noted that Lawrence subsequently wrote letters, including one to Bynner, \"that appear to repudiate his leadership vision\". He argued that they did not represent a change in Lawrence's views, and stressed that Lawrence did not necessarily endorse fascist politics, despite the presence of \"proto-fascist ideologies\" in the novel and its racism. He also argued that it reflected \"Lawrence\u2019s familiarity with German thought and culture\".{{sfn|Smith|2002|pages=7\u201324}}\n\nDuane Edwards described the novel as Lawrence's \"most profound expression of what the human psyche is\", and suggested that it prepared the way for Lawrence's later novel ''Lady Chatterley's Lover''. He maintained that it was disturbing because it \"makes readers aware of their primitive, pre-conscious self, which connects them with their most ancient ancestors\". He observed that the novel had received a more negative response than any other work by Lawrence, finding it surprising that it had \"so many detractors.\" He disputed the characterisation of the work as racist and fascist, maintaining that Lawrence's views should not be confused with those of his characters Cipriano and Ram\u00f3n.{{sfn|Edwards|2010|pages=183\u2013199}} Julianne Newmark compared the novel to [[Willa Cather]]'s ''[[The Professor's House]]'' (1925), arguing that both were inspired by \"engagement with evocative American places\u2014specifically the high deserts and rugged expanses of the American southwest\" and are concerned with \"the ways place constitutes new identities.\" She questioned the charge that ''The Plumed Serpent'' is racist and that Lawrence's views resembled those of \"white supremacists\".{{sfn|Newmark|2010|pages=89\u2013120}} Damien Barlow wrote that \"a queer approach to reading Lawrence's modernist fiction\" has been proposed.{{sfn|Barlow|2012|pages=18\u201332}}\n\nArmando Pereira maintained that the novel reflected Lawrence's desire to \"live in a creative way and free of the oppressive rationality, anxiety of technique and obsession of progress that had swallowed Europe up.\"{{sfn|Pereira|2013|pages=65\u201390}} Nora Marisa Le\u00f3n-Real M\u00e9ndez argued that Lawrence \"confers significant meaning to the landmarks, constructing a narrative space that is particular as well as linked to the Mexico outside the text.\"{{sfn|Le\u00f3n-Real M\u00e9ndez|2014|pages=545\u2013562}} Camelia Raghinaru argued that there was a connection between Lawrence's interest in the [[Kabbalah]], which may have developed from his reading, early in the 20th century, of the occultist, and founder of the [[Theosophical Society]], [[Helena Blavatsky]], and his development of a \"messianic utopia\" in ''The Plumed Serpent''. She saw the novel as dealing with \"magical and mystical secrets whose purpose is to enact a messianic eschatology\" and believed that it revealed Lawrence's preoccupation with \"femininity and its mystical significance.\" She wrote that Lawrence saw ''The Plumed Serpent'' as \"a magical incantation\" intended to \"change the world\". She interpreted the novel in terms of the philosopher [[Julia Kristeva]]'s emphasis on [[abjection]] in ''[[Powers of Horror]]'' (1980), and maintained that it emphasised \"male sexuality and female submission\".{{sfn|Raghinaru|2014|pages=20\u201343}}\n\nLuis G\u00f3mez Romero compared the novel to ''Kangaroo'', writing that in both works Lawrence, \"exposes the advent of discrete crises resulting from the failure of human ideals and institutions to prevent and tame violence.\" He noted that critics had often regarded the work as a \"direct expression of Lawrence\u2019s proto-fascist propensities.\" He questioned the view that its plot had little to do with actual Mexican politics, arguing that it should be viewed \"in a specifically Mexican context.\" He also observed that the early reception of ''The Plumed Serpent'' in Mexico was positive, citing the views of the newspaper ''[[Exc\u00e9lsior]]'' and the poet [[Bernardo Ortiz de Montellano]], who both credited Lawrence with understanding Mexico and the Mexicans. He also noted the similar appreciative views of the intellectual [[Antonio Castro Leal]] and the poet [[Octavio Paz]]. However, he stated that \"Mexican post-revolutionary nationalism and the rise of post-colonial studies\" later displaced such positive views of the novel in Mexico. He noted the poet [[Jos\u00e9 Juan Tablada]]'s accusation of plagiarism against Lawrence, but discounted it, writing that ''The Plumed Serpent'' had little in common with Tablada's ''La Resurrecci\u00f3n de los \u00cddolos'' (1924).{{sfn|Romero|2014|pages=232\u2013260}} Vladimiro Rivas Iturralde  maintained that Lawrence wrote about \"the transformation of man in myth\" in an \"improbable way\" and that ''The Plumed Serpent'' was an \"artistic failure.\"{{sfn|Rivas Iturralde|2017|pages=17\u201328}}\n\nDebra A. Castillo compared the novel to the anthropologist [[Tobias Schneebaum]]'s ''Keep the River on Your Right'' (1969) and the work of the intellectual [[Georges Bataille]]. She maintained that it \"stands out among the hundreds of novels and stories written by Anglo-Americans and set in Mexico for the particular forcefulness of Lawrence's obsession with, and equally forceful rejection of, that country and its people.\" She considered the work racist, and deemed it unsurprising that Lawrence considered it his best novel, arguing that he did so because he found Mexico, as a foreign society, an ideal subject on which to project his personal \"obsessions\". Nevertheless, she believed that the novel contained valuable insights into the state of Mexico after the Mexican Revolution. She noted that of those Mexican writers who had discussed the novel, the poet [[Jos\u00e9 Emilio Pacheco]] warned against its \"proto-fascism\", while Paz praised its \"depiction of landscape\".{{sfn|Castillo|1995|pages=35\u201373}} David Barnes noted that while Lawrence regarded the novel as his most important, he made little reference to it after its publication, and that it is usually held that he later rejected its themes for new concerns in the late 1920s, expressed in works such as ''Lady Chatterley's Lover''. He criticised the novel's \"misogyny\", \"authoritarian politics\", and \"racial essentialism\", but nevertheless saw it as part of an important \"political debate about what forms of nationhood might emerge in the 1920s\" and showed awareness of \"the possibilities of nation as utopian community.\" He maintained that while Bynner's negative judgment of the novel, expressed in his memoir ''Journeys with Genius'', had affected its reputation, Lawrence was more interested in \"Mexican revolutionary culture\" than Bynner's comments suggested. He argued that the novel's themes were to some extent similar to those of ''Lady Chatterley's Lover''. He also compared the novel to ''Kangaroo'' and ''Sketches of Etruscan Places and other Italian essays''.{{sfn|Barnes|2017|pages=674\u2013693}}\n\nShirley Bricourt argued that episodes in the novel such as the bullfight scene depict rites that both \"act as catalysers of emotions\" and \"travesty these emotions as a submissive but passionate response.\" She compared the novel to ''Kangaroo''.{{sfn|Bricourt|2011|pages=239\u2013254}} Juliette Feyel compared ''The Plumed Serpent'' to ''Kangaroo'', describing them as Lawrence's \"most explicitly political novels\". She compared both work's to ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'' (1930), by [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of [[psychoanalysis]], maintaining that Lawrence and Freud both \"correlate individual neurosis with civilization.\"{{sfn|Feyel|2014|pages=107\u2013124}}\n\n===Reviews===\nAccording to Moore, ''The Plumed Serpent'' received negative reviews from P. C. Kennedy in the ''[[New Statesman]]'', the journalist [[Katherine Anne Porter]] in the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', and the novelist [[L. P. Hartley]] in the ''[[Saturday Review (London newspaper)|Saturday Review]]'', with additional negative reviews appearing in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', which described the novel as \"feeble\", and ''[[The Spectator]]'', which described it as \"verbose\". However, Moore writes that it received a more mixed assessment, discussing both its good and bad aspects, from the poet [[Edwin Muir]] in ''[[The Nation and Athenaeum]]''.{{sfn|Moore|1974|page=419}} Maddox writes that the novel received a negative review from Charles Marriott in ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'', who deplored its failure to produce convincing characterizations, a response similar to that of Hartley in the ''Saturday Review''. According to Maddox, Porter considered the novel inferior to Lawrence's earlier work ''[[Sons and Lovers]]'' (1913), and believed that the difference in quality between the two works showed \"the catastrophe that has overtaken Lawrence.\"{{sfn|Maddox|1994|page=387}}\n\n''The Plumed Serpent'' received a mixed review from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', which described it as \"a strange, compelling state of affairs rather than a story\", and wrote that it reflected the \"physico-mysticism\", and preoccupation with sexual psychology, of its author. ''Time'' wrote that Lawrence's work \"moves many profoundly, puzzles others, and revolts the squeamish.\"{{sfn|''Time''|1926|page=40}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aztec mythology in popular culture]]\n* [[Fascism]]\n* ''[[Mornings in Mexico]]''\n* [[Polytheistic reconstructionism]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n;Books\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Aldington|first1=Richard |chapter=Introduction |title=The Plumed Serpent |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |location=Harmondsworth |year=1974 |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Baldick|first1=Chris |chapter=Post-mortem: Lawrence's critical and cultural legacy |editor-last1=Fernihough|editor-first1=Anne  |title=The Cambridge Companion to D.

The ruling [[Nova Scotia Progressive Conservative Party|Progressive Conservative Party]], led by Premier [[John Hamm]], was reduced to a [[minority government]].\n\n==Campaign==\nThe election was called by Progressive Conservatives, who decided to hold a rare summer election in the hope of strengthening their hold on the legislature.  Running against them were the [[Nova Scotia New Democratic Party|New Democratic Party]] (NDP), led by [[Darrell Dexter]], and the [[Liberal Party of Nova Scotia|Liberal Party]], led by [[Danny Graham (Halifax MLA)|Danny Graham]].\n\nHamm's party ran on a policy of fiscal management, [[tax cut]]s, and on their record of fulfilling most of their promises. While the NDP agreed in principle to tax cuts, their main cause was the creation of a public [[auto insurance]] company. The Liberals were the only party to criticize the tax cuts.\n\nFor the most part, the campaign was quiet and uneventful.  Hamm received criticism for a great number of spending programs, including a $150 tax rebate cheque sent to Nova Scotians right before the election.  The party was also criticized for holding an election in the summer when most people have other concerns.  Darrell Dexter's friendly, non-confrontational style, was popular with many voters, and was a marked change from his party's usually strident socialism.  Danny Graham, a young leader, was popular, but failed to make much of a mark.\n\nThe election was considered a mild failure for the Liberals and Progressive \nConservatives, and something of a success for the NDP.\n\nThis election is also notable for being one of the last Canadian provincial elections in which [[British subject]]s could vote (a tiny number can still vote provincially in [[Saskatchewan]] if they were qualified in 1971).<ref>[https://novascotia.ca/news/release/?id=20030707003 Voters' List Being Prepared In New Way] Nova Scotia Government</ref>\n\n==General results==\n\n===Results by party===\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; border-color: #444444\"\n|- bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\"\n!rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Party leader\n!rowspan=\"2\"|# of<br />candidates\n!colspan=\"4\"|Seats\n!colspan=\"3\"|Popular vote\n|- bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\"\n|align=\"center\"|[[1999 Nova Scotia general election|1999]]\n|align=\"center\"|<span style=\"font-size: 75%;\">[[Dissolution of parliament|Dissolution]]</span>\n|align=\"center\"|'''Elected'''\n|align=\"center\"|% Change\n|align=\"center\"|#\n|align=\"center\"|%\n|align=\"center\"|Change\n{{Canadian party colour|NS|PC|row}}\n|[[Progressive Conservative Party of Nova Scotia|Progressive Conservative]]\n|[[John Hamm]]\n|align=\"right\"|52\n|align=\"right\"|30\n|align=\"right\"|31\n!align=\"right\"|25\n|align=\"right\"|-16.7%\n|align=\"right\"|148,182\n|align=\"right\"|36.32%\n|align=\"right\"|-2.88%\n{{Canadian party colour|NS|NDP|row}}\n|[[New Democratic Party of Nova Scotia|New Democratic]]\n|[[Darrell Dexter]]\n|align=\"right\"|52\n|align=\"right\"|11\n|align=\"right\"|11\n!align=\"right\"|15\n|align=\"right\"|+36.4%\n|align=\"right\"|126,479\n|align=\"right\"|31.00%\n|align=\"right\"|+1.03%\n{{Canadian party colour|NS|Liberal|row}}\n|[[Liberal Party of Nova Scotia|Liberal]]\n|[[Danny Graham (Halifax MLA)|Danny Graham]]\n|align=\"right\"|52\n|align=\"right\"|11\n|align=\"right\"|7\n!align=\"right\"|12\n|align=\"right\"|+9.1%\n|align=\"right\"|128,417\n|align=\"right\"|31.47%\n|align=\"right\"|+1.66%\n{{Canadian party colour|NS|Independent|row}}\n| colspan=2|Independents\n|align=\"right\"|6\n|align=\"right\"|0\n|align=\"right\"|1\n!align=\"right\"|0\n|align=\"right\"| -100%\n|align=\"right\"|1,694\n|align=\"right\"|0.42%\n|align=\"right\"|+0.13%\n{{Canadian party colour|NS|Nova Scotia|row-name}}\n|Gerry Rodgers\n|align=\"right\"|16\n|align=\"right\"|0\n|align=\"right\"|0\n!align=\"right\"|0\n|align=\"right\"|0%\n|align=\"right\"|1,637\n|align=\"right\"|0.40%\n|align=\"right\"|-0.33%\n{{Canadian party colour|CA|Marijuana|row-name}}\n|Michael Patriquen\n|align=\"right\"|11\n|align=\"right\"|*\n|align=\"right\"|0\n!align=\"right\"|0\n|align=\"right\"|0%\n|align=\"right\"|1,608\n|align=\"right\"|0.39%\n|align=\"right\"|*\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|colspan=4|Vacant\n|align=\"right\"|2\n|colspan=5|&nbsp;\n|-\n!align=\"left\" colspan=3|Total\n!align=\"right\"|189\n!align=\"right\"|52\n!align=\"right\"|52\n!align=\"right\"|52\n!align=\"right\"| &nbsp;\n!align=\"right\"|408,017\n!align=\"right\"|100%\n!align=\"right\"| &nbsp;\n|}\n\n* The Marijuana Party did not contest the [[1999 Nova Scotia general election|1999 general election]].\n{{Bar box|title=Popular vote|titlebar=#ddd|width=600px|barwidth=410px|bars={{Bar percent|PC|{{Canadian party colour|NS|PC}}|36.32}}\n{{Bar percent|Liberal|{{Canadian party colour|NS|Liberal}}|31.47}}\n{{Bar percent|New Democratic|{{Canadian party colour|NS|NDP}}|31.00}}\n{{Bar percent|Others|{{Canadian party colour|NS|Independent}}|1.11}}}}{{Bar box|title=Seats summary|titlebar=#ddd|width=600px|barwidth=410px|bars={{Bar percent|PC|{{Canadian party colour|NS|PC}}|48.08}}\n{{Bar percent|New Democratic|{{Canadian party colour|NS|NDP}}|28.85}}\n{{Bar percent|Liberal|{{Canadian party colour|NS|Liberal}}|23.08}}\n{{Bar percent|Others|{{Canadian party colour|NS|Independent}}|1.11}}}}\n\n===Results by region===\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse\"\n|- bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\"\n! align=\"center\" colspan=\"3\"|Party name\n! align=\"center\" width=\"45\"|[[Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|HRM]]\n! align=\"center\" width=\"45\"|[[Cape Breton Island|C.B.]]\n! align=\"center\" width=\"45\"|[[Annapolis Valley|Valley]]\n! align=\"center\" width=\"48\"|[[South Shore (Nova Scotia)|S.

The ruling [[Nova Scotia Progressive Conservative Party|Progressive Conservative Party]], led by Premier [[John Hamm]], was reduced to a [[minority government]].\n\n==Campaign==\nThe election was called by Progressive Conservatives, who decided to hold a rare summer election in the hope of strengthening their hold on the legislature.  Running against them were the [[Nova Scotia New Democratic Party|New Democratic Party]] (NDP), led by [[Darrell Dexter]], and the [[Liberal Party of Nova Scotia|Liberal Party]], led by [[Danny Graham (Halifax MLA)|Danny Graham]].\n\nHamm's party ran on a policy of fiscal management, [[tax cut]]s, and on their record of fulfilling most of their promises. While the NDP agreed in principle to tax cuts, their main cause was the creation of a public [[auto insurance]] company. The Liberals were the only party to criticize the tax cuts.\n\nFor the most part, the campaign was quiet and uneventful.  Hamm received criticism for a great number of spending programs, including a $150 tax rebate cheque sent to Nova Scotians right before the election.  The party was also criticized for holding an election in the summer when most people have other concerns.  Darrell Dexter's friendly, non-confrontational style, was popular with many voters, and was a marked change from his party's usually strident socialism.  Danny Graham, a young leader, was popular, but failed to make much of a mark.\n\nThe election was considered a mild failure for the Liberals and Progressive \nConservatives, and something of a success for the NDP.\n\nThis election is also notable for being one of the last Canadian provincial elections in which [[British subject]]s could vote (a tiny number can still vote provincially in [[Saskatchewan]] if they were qualified in 1971).<ref>[https://novascotia.ca/news/release/?id=20030707003 Voters' List Being Prepared In New Way] Nova Scotia Government</ref>\n\n==General results==\n\n===Results by party===\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; border-color: #444444\"\n|- bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\"\n!rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Party leader\n!rowspan=\"2\"|# of<br />candidates\n!colspan=\"4\"|Seats\n!colspan=\"3\"|Popular vote\n|- bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\"\n|align=\"center\"|[[1999 Nova Scotia general election|1999]]\n|align=\"center\"|<span style=\"font-size: 75%;\">[[Dissolution of parliament|Dissolution]]</span>\n|align=\"center\"|'''Elected'''\n|align=\"center\"|% Change\n|align=\"center\"|#\n|align=\"center\"|%\n|align=\"center\"|Change\n{{Canadian party colour|NS|PC|row}}\n|[[Progressive Conservative Party of Nova Scotia|Progressive Conservative]]\n|[[John Hamm]]\n|align=\"right\"|52\n|align=\"right\"|30\n|align=\"right\"|31\n!align=\"right\"|25\n|align=\"right\"|-16.7%\n|align=\"right\"|148,182\n|align=\"right\"|36.32%\n|align=\"right\"|-2.88%\n{{Canadian party colour|NS|NDP|row}}\n|[[New Democratic Party of Nova Scotia|New Democratic]]\n|[[Darrell Dexter]]\n|align=\"right\"|52\n|align=\"right\"|11\n|align=\"right\"|11\n!align=\"right\"|15\n|align=\"right\"|+36.4%\n|align=\"right\"|126,479\n|align=\"right\"|31.00%\n|align=\"right\"|+1.03%\n{{Canadian party colour|NS|Liberal|row}}\n|[[Liberal Party of Nova Scotia|Liberal]]\n|[[Danny Graham (Halifax MLA)|Danny Graham]]\n|align=\"right\"|52\n|align=\"right\"|11\n|align=\"right\"|7\n!align=\"right\"|12\n|align=\"right\"|+9.1%\n|align=\"right\"|128,417\n|align=\"right\"|31.47%\n|align=\"right\"|+1.66%\n{{Canadian party colour|NS|Independent|row}}\n| colspan=2|Independents\n|align=\"right\"|6\n|align=\"right\"|0\n|align=\"right\"|1\n!align=\"right\"|0\n|align=\"right\"| -100%\n|align=\"right\"|1,694\n|align=\"right\"|0.42%\n|align=\"right\"|+0.13%\n{{Canadian party colour|NS|Nova Scotia|row-name}}\n|Gerry Rodgers\n|align=\"right\"|16\n|align=\"right\"|0\n|align=\"right\"|0\n!align=\"right\"|0\n|align=\"right\"|0%\n|align=\"right\"|1,637\n|align=\"right\"|0.40%\n|align=\"right\"|-0.33%\n{{Canadian party colour|CA|Marijuana|row-name}}\n|Michael Patriquen\n|align=\"right\"|11\n|align=\"right\"|*\n|align=\"right\"|0\n!align=\"right\"|0\n|align=\"right\"|0%\n|align=\"right\"|1,608\n|align=\"right\"|0.39%\n|align=\"right\"|*\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|colspan=4|Vacant\n|align=\"right\"|2\n|colspan=5|&nbsp;\n|-\n!align=\"left\" colspan=3|Total\n!align=\"right\"|189\n!align=\"right\"|52\n!align=\"right\"|52\n!align=\"right\"|52\n!align=\"right\"| &nbsp;\n!align=\"right\"|408,017\n!align=\"right\"|100%\n!align=\"right\"| &nbsp;\n|}\n\n* The Marijuana Party did not contest the [[1999 Nova Scotia general election|1999 general election]].\n{{Bar box|title=Popular vote|titlebar=#ddd|width=600px|barwidth=410px|bars={{Bar percent|PC|{{Canadian party colour|NS|PC}}|36.32}}\n{{Bar percent|Liberal|{{Canadian party colour|NS|Liberal}}|31.47}}\n{{Bar percent|New Democratic|{{Canadian party colour|NS|NDP}}|31.00}}\n{{Bar percent|Others|{{Canadian party colour|NS|Independent}}|1.11}}}}{{Bar box|title=Seats summary|titlebar=#ddd|width=600px|barwidth=410px|bars={{Bar percent|PC|{{Canadian party colour|NS|PC}}|48.08}}\n{{Bar percent|New Democratic|{{Canadian party colour|NS|NDP}}|28.85}}\n{{Bar percent|Liberal|{{Canadian party colour|NS|Liberal}}|23.08}}\n{{Bar percent|Others|{{Canadian party colour|NS|Independent}}|1.11}}}}\n\n===Results by region===\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse\"\n|- bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\"\n! align=\"center\" colspan=\"3\"|Party name\n! align=\"center\" width=\"45\"|[[Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|HRM]]\n! align=\"center\" width=\"45\"|[[Cape Breton Island|C.B.]]\n! align=\"center\" width=\"45\"|[[Annapolis Valley|Valley]]\n! align=\"center\" width=\"48\"|[[South Shore (Nova Scotia)|S.
