The barmaid says that the killer was Jimmy Kray and that he lives down the road with his mother, Angie Brooks. Chandler and Miles interview Angie, who reveals she visited Ronnie Kray in [[Broadmoor Hospital|Broadmoor]] and he provided her with a sperm sample with which she became pregnant with identical twins, Jimmy and Johnny Kray. Dr Llewellyn explains forensics will not show which twin is the killer, so they need to investigate the Krays the old-fashioned way. Chandler's investigations rattle the twins and he's bundled into a car for a meeting, learning that Jimmy is clearly insane and Johnny is finding it hard to control him when he turned down their offer of backing off. The team's perseverance leads them into personal danger; Miles' son is threatened and Kent is terrorized by uniformed officers on the twins' payroll. Mansell receives a wreath delivered at his home, McCormack has a gun pointed at his head and Chandler is beaten before being dumped in [[Epping Forest]]. At rock bottom, Chandler asks for Buchan's help and takes his advice to use Jimmy's insanity to separate the twins. However, learning that Fitzgerald is on the twins' payroll, the meeting with Johnny goes awry while he and his brother rake the pub with automatic fire.  Inside, Chandler spots a gun and fires back. When their ammunition is spent, the twins leave.

While Anderson and Chandler talk, Miles becomes worried when the only person he can't reach is McCormack. Racing to his house, they find him hanging in his garden shed. Llewellyn rules that the death is a suicide. McCormack's death appears to mark the end of the inquiry, but it's all for show. The investigation moves to a secret location, Buchan's house, which will be the new incident room. Anderson can only hold the Krays off for three days and they are only too aware that they have no witnesses, no evidence and no leads. They link Ronnie Kray's liking for young boys with Jimmy Kray's \"Blond Boy\". When the \"Blond Boy\" reveals himself as a girl, the team wonder what else is fake about these twins. Managing to obtain [[DNA]] of Ronnie and Jimmy, Chandler's group manages to confirm that their Kray twins are not related to the originals. Using this information to coax Dukes' support in exposing their organization, the Krays are arrested while it is revealed that only their mother Angie knew the truth and lied to them about Ronnie being their father. However, the Krays are assassinated while in custody with Anderson taking advantage of the resulting power vacuum within the police department.

The murder, they discover, is a 16th-century torture, the ''[[peine forte et dure]]'', and after a second body is found \u2013 an elderly woman burnt at the stake \u2013 they realise that someone has started a witch hunt and is now killing suspected witches in Whitechapel.\n\n'''Part Two''': As the witch-hunt continues, the team discover that a third victim has disappeared and could be hours from death. They discover that a common link to known witch hunts is [[ergotism|ergot poisoning]], where the victim has to appease all of those he believes to be responsible for cursing him. Kent and Mansell come to blows during the investigation. Chandler is dissatisfied at the thought he may once again catch the killer on their deathbed.

The first victim, a Russian gangster, was in the midst of attacking a young girl when he was murdered, but the girl describes the killer as having an elderly female appearance. Could the killer really be an old lady? Or is the killer disguising himself with masks of his previous victims, or possibly even something more sinister?\n\n'''Part Two''': The team discover that the motives behind the killings lie in criminal cases where the accused have escaped justice. When a fourth victim is discovered barely alive, the team are led to a young boy whose mother was killed in a hit-and-run incident by the victim. Convinced that he is the killer, both Chandler and Miles are shocked when they discover that the only crime he is responsible for is that of a tirade of abuse against the victim.

When a second victim is pulled into the dreary depths on the way home from work, the team realise that the killer is targeting local 'heroes', all of whom have been interviewed for the local paper. However, they find the journalist's choice of dinner holds a clue to the investigation.\n\n'''Part Two''': As further victims emerge, Chandler is forced to take desperate measures when Buchan suggests that the lack of discovery of the victims' missing organs could suggest that cannibals are operating in Whitechapel. When a priest is brutally murdered, a link to a doomsday cult is uncovered, where members of the group believe that eating the organs of innocent souls will save them from an oncoming apocalypse.

The barmaid says that the killer was Jimmy Kray and that he lives down the road with his mother, Angie Brooks. Chandler and Miles interview Angie, who reveals she visited Ronnie Kray in [[Broadmoor Hospital|Broadmoor]] and he provided her with a sperm sample with which she became pregnant with identical twins, Jimmy and Johnny Kray. Dr Llewellyn explains forensics will not show which twin is the killer, so they need to investigate the Krays the old-fashioned way. Chandler's investigations rattle the twins and he's bundled into a car for a meeting, learning that Jimmy is clearly insane and Johnny is finding it hard to control him when he turned down their offer of backing off. The team's perseverance leads them into personal danger; Miles' son is threatened and Kent is terrorized by uniformed officers on the twins' payroll. Mansell receives a wreath delivered at his home, McCormack has a gun pointed at his head and Chandler is beaten before being dumped in [[Epping Forest]]. At rock bottom, Chandler asks for Buchan's help and takes his advice to use Jimmy's insanity to separate the twins. However, learning that Fitzgerald is on the twins' payroll, the meeting with Johnny goes awry while he and his brother rake the pub with automatic fire.  Inside, Chandler spots a gun and fires back.

The investigation moves to a secret location, Buchan's house, which will be the new incident room. Anderson can only hold the Krays off for three days and they are only too aware that they have no witnesses, no evidence and no leads. They link Ronnie Kray's liking for young boys with Jimmy Kray's \"Blond Boy\". When the \"Blond Boy\" reveals himself as a girl, the team wonder what else is fake about these twins. Managing to obtain [[DNA]] of Ronnie and Jimmy, Chandler's group manages to confirm that their Kray twins are not related to the originals. Using this information to coax Dukes' support in exposing their organization, the Krays are arrested while it is revealed that only their mother Angie knew the truth and lied to them about Ronnie being their father. However, the Krays are assassinated while in custody with Anderson taking advantage of the resulting power vacuum within the police department. Soon after, Anderson accepts Chandler's request to set up a special team.\n|LineColor=ACE5EE\n}}\n|}\n\n===Series 3 (2012)===\n''Whitechapel'' was commissioned for a third series in March 2011, but unlike the previous two series, which were each based on a single event, the new series was split into three separate two-part stories, which each focused on a different case. For the [[BBC America]] DVD releases, the three stories were given individual titles: ''The Murder in Darkness'', ''The Hunger for Mercy'' and ''The Sins of Betrayal'' respectively.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|- style=\"color:black\"\n! style=\"background: #ACE5EE;\"|Episode\n! style=\"background: #ACE5EE;\"|Title\n! style=\"background: #ACE5EE;\"|Directed by\n! style=\"background: #ACE5EE;\"|Written by\n! style=\"background: #ACE5EE;\"|Original&nbsp;airdate\n!  style=\"background:#ace5ee; width:25%;\"| Viewing Figures (millions)<br /> <small> Sourced by [[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board|BARB]]; includes [[ITV HD|ITV1 HD]] and ITV1 +1</small>\n|-\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 1-2\n |Title = Case One (Parts 1 & 2)\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|1|30|df=y}}<br>6 February 2012\n |DirectedBy = John Strickland\n |WrittenBy = Ben Court & Caroline Ip\n |Aux4 = 7.35<br>6.88\n |ShortSummary = \n'''Part One''': Chandler and Miles investigate the slaughter of four people at a tailor's fortified workshop. Buchan, retained by Chandler as the team's historical adviser, believes that the huge archive at Whitechapel station will provide the necessary insight into the baffling crime, that appears to echo the [[Ratcliff Highway murders]] two-hundred years earlier. However, with no obvious point of access, both Chandler and Miles are puzzled as to how the killer would have committed the crimes without being seen.\n\n'''Part Two''': When a second mass murder occurs, the M.O. matches the first case - again there was no obvious break-in and no forensic evidence to identify the killer. Chandler and Miles then discover that in both cases, food and drink was known to have been disappearing from the fridge days before the murders, and work out that the killer must have been hiding in the underbelly of the murder scenes, ready to pick the perfect moment to commit the crime. But can they identify the location of his next spree in time?\n\n''Guest starring: [[Christina Chong]] as Lizzie Pepper; [[David Schneider (actor)|David Schneider]] as Marcus Salter''\n |LineColor = ACE5EE\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 3-4\n |Title = Case Two (Parts 1 & 2)\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|2|13|df=y}}<br>20 February 2012\n |DirectedBy = Richard Clark\n |WrittenBy = Ben Court & Caroline Ip\n |Aux4 = 7.12<br>6.95\n |ShortSummary = \n'''Part One''': As Chandler and Miles attend the christening of Miles's daughter, a fox runs through the streets of Whitechapel with a human arm in its mouth. Soon, more body parts from the same victim are washed up by the river, all containing evidence of a fatal poisoning. When limbs of a second victim are uncovered, Buchan believes the crimes echo the [[Pinchin Street Murder|Thames torso murders]] of the 1880s - can the team, with the help of a female DI from South of the river, attractively like Chandler in her habits, crack the gruesome case?\n\n'''Part Two''': When traces of the aphrodisiac [[Spanish fly#Cantharidin|Spanish fly]] are found in the bodies of the two murder victims, Chandler and Miles question what kind of killer they could be up against. As further victims come to light, the team are taken to the heart of a dark obsession where they discover that romance and love haven taken a sinister turn, and that the killer is picking his victims based on the appearance of his 'lost love', the driving force behind the murders.

Shortly afterwards, a second victim is discovered, having had his blood used to cover a wall which he was graffiting on. Chandler, Miles and the team suspect a dangerous patient and former Whitechapel resident, who has recently escaped from a psychiatric unit, and is obsessed with Lon Chaney and the film ''[[London After Midnight (film)#Background|London After Midnight]]'', where the sins of the victims are used against them during their murder.\n\n'''Part Two''':  With the body count rising following the murder of a young boy in a police firefight, Miles and Chandler clash over the direction of the investigation. Having already survived the killer's wrath once, Morgan Lamb is of particular interest to the team - especially Chandler. When she is attacked again, miraculously surviving the killer's advances a second time, Miles is certain of her involvement.

The murder, they discover, is a 16th-century torture, the ''[[peine forte et dure]]'', and after a second body is found \u2013 an elderly woman burnt at the stake \u2013 they realise that someone has started a witch hunt and is now killing suspected witches in Whitechapel.\n\n'''Part Two''': As the witch-hunt continues, the team discover that a third victim has disappeared and could be hours from death.

The first victim, a Russian gangster, was in the midst of attacking a young girl when he was murdered, but the girl describes the killer as having an elderly female appearance. Could the killer really be an old lady? Or is the killer disguising himself with masks of his previous victims, or possibly even something more sinister?\n\n'''Part Two''': The team discover that the motives behind the killings lie in criminal cases where the accused have escaped justice. When a fourth victim is discovered barely alive, the team are led to a young boy whose mother was killed in a hit-and-run incident by the victim. Convinced that he is the killer, both Chandler and Miles are shocked when they discover that the only crime he is responsible for is that of a tirade of abuse against the victim.

However, they find the journalist's choice of dinner holds a clue to the investigation.\n\n'''Part Two''': As further victims emerge, Chandler is forced to take desperate measures when Buchan suggests that the lack of discovery of the victims' missing organs could suggest that cannibals are operating in Whitechapel. When a priest is brutally murdered, a link to a doomsday cult is uncovered, where members of the group believe that eating the organs of innocent souls will save them from an oncoming apocalypse.

Four additional slave states then seceded after Lincoln requested arms from them to make a retaliatory strike. Due to Union measures such as the [[Confiscation Acts]] and the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in 1863, the war effectively ended slavery even before the institution was banned by constitutional amendment. Following the Union victory in the Civil War, slavery was made illegal in the United States upon the ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] in December 1865.

As English custom then considered baptized Christians exempt from slavery, colonists treated these Africans as indentured servants, and they joined about 1,000 English indentured servants already in the colony. The Africans were freed after a prescribed period and given the use of land and supplies by their former masters. The historian [[Ira Berlin]] noted that what he called the \"charter generation\" in the colonies was sometimes made up of mixed-race men (Atlantic Creoles) who were indentured servants, and whose ancestry was African and Iberian. They were descendants of African women and Portuguese or Spanish men who worked in African ports as traders or facilitators in the trade of enslaved people. For example, [[Anthony Johnson (colonist)|Anthony Johnson]] arrived in Virginia in 1621 from Angola as an indentured servant; he became free and a property owner, eventually buying and enslaving people himself.

England had no system of naturalizing immigrants to its island or its colonies. Since persons of African origins were not English subjects by birth, they were among those peoples considered foreigners and generally outside [[English common law]]. The colonies struggled with how to classify people born to foreigners and subjects. In 1656 Virginia, [[Elizabeth Key Grinstead]], a [[mixed-race]] woman, successfully gained her freedom and that of her son in a challenge to her status by making her case as the baptized Christian daughter of the free Englishman Thomas Key. Her attorney was an English subject, which may have helped her case.

A child of an enslaved mother would be born into slavery, regardless if the father were a freeborn Englishman or Christian. This was a reversal of [[common law]] practice in England, which ruled that children of English subjects took the status of the father.

People enslaved in [[Northern United States|the North]] typically worked as house servants, artisans, laborers and craftsmen, with the greater number in cities. Many men worked on the docks and in shipping. In 1703, more than 42 percent of New York City households enslaved people, the second-highest proportion of any city in the colonies after [[Charleston, South Carolina]].<ref name=\"Nation\">[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20051107/slavery_in_new_york \"Slavery in New York\"], ''The Nation'', November 7, 2005</ref> But enslaved people were also used as agricultural workers in farm communities, including in areas of upstate New York and Long Island, Connecticut, and New Jersey.

There were 14,867 in New England where they were 2.7% of the population; 34,679 in the mid-Atlantic colonies where they were 6% of the population (19,000 were in New York or 11%); and 347,378 in the five southern Colonies were they were 31% of the population<ref>Ira Berlin, Generations of Captivity: A History of African-American Slaves, 2003</ref>\n\nThe South developed an agricultural economy dependent on commodity crops.

They also worked in the artisanal trades on large plantations and in many southern port cities. Backwoods subsistence farmers, the later wave of settlers in the 18th century who settled along the Appalachian Mountains and backcountry, seldom held enslaved people.\n\nSome of the British colonies attempted to abolish the [[Atlantic slave trade|international slave trade]], fearing that the importation of new Africans would be disruptive. Virginia bills to that effect were vetoed by the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|British Privy Council]]. [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] forbade the import of enslaved people in 1774.

The great majority of enslaved Africans were transported to sugar colonies in the Caribbean and to Brazil. As life expectancy was short, their numbers had to be continually replenished. Life expectancy was much higher in the U.S., and the enslaved population was successful in reproduction. The number of enslaved people in the U.S. grew rapidly, reaching {{nowrap|4 million}} by the 1860 Census.

Colonial officials in 1724 implemented [[Louis XIV of France]]'s ''[[Code Noir]]'', which regulated the slave trade and the institution of [[slavery in New France]] and French Caribbean colonies.

Most of Louisiana's \"third class\" of free people of color, situated between the native-born French and mass of African slaves, lived in New Orleans.<ref name=\"Rodney Stark p.322\" /> The Louisiana free people of color were often literate and educated, with a significant number owning businesses, properties, and even slaves.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /><ref name=\"FL6oMC p.115\" /> Although ''Code Noir'' forbade interracial marriages, [[Pla\u00e7age|interracial unions were widespread]] under the system known as ''[[pla\u00e7age]]''.

But many free people of African descent were mixed race.<ref name=\"books.google.fr\" /><ref name=\"FL6oMC p.115\" />\n\nWhen the U.S. took over Louisiana, Americans from the Protestant South entered the territory and began to impose their norms. They officially discouraged interracial relationships (although white men continued to have unions with black women, both enslaved and free.) The ''Americanization'' of Louisiana gradually resulted in a binary system of race, causing free people of color to lose status as they were grouped with the slaves.

He wrote:\n\n{{quote|The work of various historians, among them [[David Waldstreicher]] and [[Alfred W. Blumrosen|Alfred W.]] and [[Ruth G.

[T]he {{bracket|[[Somerset v Stewart|Somerset]]}} ruling caused a sensation.... Numerous colonial newspapers covered it and warned of the tyranny it represented. Multiple historians have pointed out that in part because of the Somerset case, slavery joined other issues in helping to gradually drive apart the patriots and their colonial governments. ...[L]arge numbers of the enslaved came to see the struggle as one between freedom [under the British] and continued subjugation. As Waldstreicher writes, \u201cThe black-British alliance decisively pushed planters in these [Southern] states toward independence.\u201d\n\nThe culmination of this was the [[Dunmore Proclamation]].... A member of [[Colonial period of South Carolina|South Carolina]]\u2019s delegation to the Continental Congress wrote that this act did more to sever the ties between Britain and its colonies \"than any other expedient which could possibly have been thought of.\" The historian [[Jill Lepore]] writes in her recent book, ''These Truths: A History of the United States,'' \"Not the taxes and the tea, not the shots at Lexington and Concord, not the siege of Boston; rather, it was this act, Dunmore's offer of freedom to slaves, that tipped the scales in favor of American independence.\"<ref>{{cite news\n|newspaper=[[New York Times]]\n|date=December 20, 2019\n|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/20/magazine/letter-to-the-editor-historians-critique-the-1619-project-and-we-respond.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share\n|title=Editor's response\n|first=Jake\n|last=Silverstein\n|authorlink=Jake Silverstein}}</ref>}}\n\nWilentz later argued there were many more anti-slavery activists in the colonies at the time of the Revolution than in Britain, and Hannah-Jones, while she stood by her piece, conceded she phrased the contention too strongly in a way that might mislead about all the colonies and people involved.  She said subsequent materials based on the series would later be better contextualized.<ref name=Serwer/>\n\n===Constitution of the United States===\nSlavery was a contentious issue in the writing and approval of the [[Constitution of the United States]].<ref>Keith L.

As the historian James Oliver Horton noted, prominent slaveholder politicians and the commodity crops of the South had a strong influence on United States politics and economy. Horton said,\n\n<blockquote>in the 72 years between the election of George Washington and the election of Abraham Lincoln, 50 of those years [had] a slaveholder as president of the United States, and, for that whole period of time, there was never a person elected to a second term who was not a slaveholder.<ref name=\"pbs.org\" /></blockquote>\n\nThe power of Southern states in Congress lasted until the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], affecting national policies, legislation, and appointments.<ref name=\"pbs.org\">[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/social_issues/jan-june07/divided_01-25.html \"Interview: James Oliver Horton: Exhibit Reveals History of Slavery in New York City\"], PBS ''Newshour'', January 25, 2007.

He felt that a multiracial society without slavery was untenable, as he believed that prejudice against blacks increased as they were granted more rights (for example, in northern states). He believed that the attitudes of white Southerners, and the concentration of the black population in the South, were bringing the white and black populations to a state of equilibrium, and were a danger to both races. Because of the racial differences between master and slave, he believed that the latter could not be emancipated.<ref name=\"Alexis de Tocqueville\">{{cite book|title=Democracy in America (Volume 1)|last=de Tocqueville |first=Alexise|chapter=Chapter XVIII: Future Condition Of Three Races In The United States|isbn=978-1-4209-2910-2}}</ref>\n\n[[Robert E.

Leaders then described slavery as a beneficial scheme of labor management. [[John C. Calhoun]], in a famous speech in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] in 1837, declared that slavery was \"instead of an evil, a good\u2014a positive good\". Calhoun supported his view with the following reasoning: in every civilized society one portion of the community must live on the labor of another; learning, science, and the arts are built upon leisure; the African slave, kindly treated by his master and mistress and looked after in his old age, is better off than the free laborers of Europe; and under the slave system conflicts between capital and labor are avoided. The advantages of slavery in this respect, he concluded, \"will become more and more manifest, if left undisturbed by interference from without, as the country advances in wealth and numbers\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Beard |first1=Charles A. |authorlink1=Charles A.

In a speech to the Senate on March 4, 1858, Hammond developed his \"Mudsill Theory,\" defending his view on slavery stating: \"Such a class you must have, or you would not have that other class which leads progress, civilization, and refinement. It constitutes the very mud-sill of society and of political government; and you might as well attempt to build a house in the air, as to build either the one or the other, except on this mud-sill.\" Hammond believed that in every class one group must accomplish all the menial duties, because without them the leaders in society could not progress.<ref name=\"Mudsill Theory\"/> He argued that the hired laborers of the North were slaves too: \"The difference\u2026 is, that our slaves are hired for life and well compensated; there is no starvation, no begging, no want of employment,\" while those in the North had to search for employment.<ref name=\"Mudsill Theory\"/>\n\nGeorge Fitzhugh used assumptions about white superiority to justify slavery, writing that, \"the Negro is but a grown up child, and must be governed as a child.\" In ''The Universal Law of Slavery'', Fitzhugh argues that slavery provides everything necessary for life and that the slave is unable to survive in a free world because he is lazy, and cannot compete with the intelligent European white race. He states that \"The negro slaves of the South are the happiest, and in some sense, the freest people in the world.\"<ref name=\"Universal Law\">{{cite web|last=Fitzhugh|first=George|authorlink=George Fitzhugh|title=The Universal Law of Slavery|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4h3141t.html|accessdate=December 10, 2017}}</ref> Without the South, \"He (slave) would become an insufferable burden to society\" and \"Society has the right to prevent this, and can only do so by subjecting him to domestic slavery.\"<ref name=\"Universal Law\"/>\n\nOn March 21, 1861, [[Alexander Stephens]], Vice President of the Confederacy, delivered his [[Cornerstone Speech]].

What developed was a Northern block of free states united into one contiguous geographic area that generally shared an anti-slavery culture. The exceptions were the areas along the Ohio River settled by Southerners: the southern portions of Indiana, Ohio, and Illinois. Residents of those areas generally shared in Southern culture and attitudes. In addition, these areas were devoted to agriculture longer than the industrializing northern parts of these states, and some farmers used slave labor. In Illinois, for example, while the trade in slaves was prohibited, it was legal to bring slaves from Kentucky into Illinois and use them there, as long as the slaves left Illinois one day per year (they were \"visiting\"). The emancipation of slaves in the North led to the growth in the population of Northern free blacks, from several hundred in the 1770s to nearly 50,000 by 1810.<ref>Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity'', p. 104.</ref>\n\n==Agitation against slavery==\n{{main|Abolitionism in the United States}}\n[[File:Benjamin Kent, Old Burying Ground, Halifax, Nova Scotia.jpg|thumb|[[Benjamin Kent]], [[Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia)|Old Burying Ground]], Halifax, Nova Scotia]]\n\nThere was legal agitation against slavery in the 13 colonies starting in 1752 by lawyer [[Benjamin Kent]], whose cases were recorded by one of his understudies, the future president [[John Adams]].

They worked to raise awareness about the evils of slavery, and to build support for abolition.\n\nThis struggle took place amid strong support for slavery among white Southerners, who profited greatly from the system of enslaved labor. But slavery was entwined with the national economy; for instance, the banking, shipping, and manufacturing industries of New York City all had strong economic interests in slavery, as did similar industries in other major port cities in the North.

Cuffe believed that African Americans could more easily \"rise to be a people\" in Africa than in the U.S. because of the latter's slavery, racial discrimination, and limits on black rights. Although Cuffee died in 1817, his early efforts encouraged the ACS to promote further settlements. The [[Quakers]] opposed slavery but believed blacks would face better chances for freedom in Africa than in the U.S. Slaveholders opposed abolition, but wanted to get rid off [[freedmen]], which they saw as potential leaders of rebellions and people who encouraged slaves to run away.</ref> The ACS was made up mostly of [[Quakers]] and slaveholders, who found uneasy common ground in support of what was incorrectly called \"repatriation\". But by this time most black Americans were native-born and did not want to emigrate, saying they were no more African than the Americans were British. Rather, they wanted full rights in the United States, where their families had lived and worked for generations.\n\nIn 1822 the ACS and affiliated state societies established what would become the colony of [[Liberia]], in West Africa.<ref name=\"WDLMap\">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/446/ |title = Map of Liberia, West Africa |work = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1830 |accessdate = June 3, 2013}}</ref> The ACS assisted thousands of freedmen and free blacks (with legislated limits) to emigrate there from the United States.

After 1830, abolitionist and newspaper publisher [[William Lloyd Garrison]] promoted emancipation, characterizing slaveholding as a personal sin. He demanded that slaveowners repent and start the process of emancipation. His position increased defensiveness on the part of some Southerners, who noted the long history of slavery among many cultures. A few abolitionists, such as [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]], favored the use of armed force to foment uprisings among the slaves, as he attempted to do at [[Harper's Ferry]]. Most abolitionists tried to raise public support to change laws and to challenge slave laws. Abolitionists were active on the lecture circuit in the North, and often featured escaped slaves in their presentations. The eloquent [[Frederick Douglass]] became an important abolitionist leader after escaping from slavery. [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852) was an international bestseller and aroused popular sentiment against slavery. It also provoked the publication of numerous [[anti-Tom novels]] by Southerners in the years before the American Civil War.\n\n===Prohibiting the international trade===\nWhile under the Constitution, Congress could not prohibit the import slave trade until 1808, the third Congress regulated it in the [[Slave Trade Act of 1794]], which prohibited shipbuilding and outfitting for the trade.

From 1819, they were assisted by forces from the United States Navy. With the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] of 1842, the relationship with Britain was formalized, and the two countries jointly ran the [[Blockade of Africa]] with their navies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.potomacbooksinc.com/Books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=63330|title=Potomac Books \u2013 University of Nebraska Press \u2013 University of Nebraska Press|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015130620/http://www.potomacbooksinc.com/Books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=63330|archivedate=October 15, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Post-revolution Southern manumissions===\nAlthough Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware were slave states, the latter two already had a high proportion of free blacks by the outbreak of war. Following the Revolution, the three legislatures made [[manumission]] easier, allowed by deed or will. Quaker and Methodist ministers particularly urged slaveholders to free their slaves. The number and proportion of freed slaves in these states rose dramatically until 1810. More than half of the number of free blacks in the United States were concentrated in the Upper South. The proportion of free blacks among the black population in the Upper South rose from less than 1% in 1792 to more than 10% by 1810.<ref name=\"Peter Kolchin 1993 pp. 77-78\" /> In Delaware, nearly 75% of blacks were free by 1810.<ref>Kolchin (1993), ''American Slavery'', p. 78.</ref>\n\nIn the US as a whole, by 1810 the number of free blacks reached 186,446, or 13.5% of all blacks.<ref name=\"PeterKolchin\">Peter Kolchin (1993), ''American Slavery'', p. 81.</ref> After that period few slaves were freed, as the development of [[Plantations in the American South|cotton plantations]] featuring short-staple cotton in the Deep South drove up the internal demand for slaves in the domestic slave trade and high prices were paid.<ref>Kolchin (1993), ''American Slavery'', p. 87.</ref>\n\nSouth Carolina made manumission more difficult, requiring legislative approval of every instance of manumission. Several Southern states required manumitted slaves to leave the state within 30 days.\n\n===Domestic slave trade and forced migration===\n[[File:Slavery map.jpg|thumb|right|Movement of slaves between 1790 and 1860]]\n\nThe growing international demand for cotton led many plantation owners further west in search of suitable land. In addition, the invention of the [[cotton gin]] in 1793 enabled profitable processing of short-staple cotton, which could readily be grown in the uplands. The invention revolutionized the cotton industry by increasing fifty-fold the quantity of cotton that could be processed in a day. At the end of the [[War of 1812]], fewer than 300,000 bales of cotton were produced nationally. By 1820 the amount of cotton produced had increased to 600,000 bales, and by 1850 it had reached 4,000,000. There was an explosive growth of cotton cultivation throughout the [[Deep South]] and greatly increased demand for slave labor to support it.<ref>''The People's Chronology'', 1994, by James Trager.</ref> As a result, manumissions decreased dramatically in the South.<ref>Kolchin p. 96.\n\nThrough the domestic slave trade, about one million enslaved African Americans were forcibly removed from the Upper South to the Deep South, with some transported by ship in the coastwise trade. In 1834, [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Louisiana]] grew half the nation's cotton; by 1859, along with [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], they grew 78%. By 1859 cotton growth in the [[Carolinas]] had fallen to just 10% of the national total.

These sales of slaves broke up many families and caused much hardship. Characterizing it as the \"central event\" in the life of a slave between the [[American Revolution]] and the Civil War, Berlin wrote that whether slaves were directly uprooted or lived in fear that they or their families would be involuntarily moved, \"the massive deportation traumatized black people, both slave and free.\"<ref>Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity'', pp. 161\u201362.</ref> Individuals lost their connection to families and clans.

During each decade between 1810 and 1860, at least 100,000 slaves were moved from their state of origin. In the final decade before the Civil War, 250,000 were moved. Michael Tadman wrote in ''Speculators and Slaves: Masters, Traders, and Slaves in the Old South'' (1989) that 60\u201370% of inter-regional migrations were the result of the sale of slaves. In 1820 a child in the Upper South had a 30% chance of being sold south by 1860.<ref>Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity'', pp. 168\u201369. Kolchin p. 96. Kolchin notes that Fogel and Engerman maintained that 84% of slaves moved with their families but \"most other scholars assign far greater weight \u2026 to slave sales.\" Ransome (p. 582) notes that Fogel and Engermann based their conclusions on the study of some counties in Maryland in the 1830s and attempted to extrapolate that analysis as reflective of the entire South over the entire period.</ref> The death rate for the slaves on their way to their new destination across the American South was less than that suffered by captives shipped across the Atlantic Ocean, but mortality was higher than the normal death rate.\n[[File:Slave Market-Atlanta Georgia 1864.jpg|Slave trader's business in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], 1864|thumb]]\n[[Interregional slave trade|Slave traders]] transported two-thirds of the slaves who moved west.<ref>{{cite book |first=Allan |last=Kulikoff |title=The Agrarian Origins of American Capitalism |location=Charlottesville |publisher=University of Virginia Press |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-8139-1388-9 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/agrarianoriginso00kuli/page/226 226]\u201369 |url=https://archive.org/details/agrarianoriginso00kuli |url-access=registration }}</ref> Only a minority moved with their families and existing master. Slave traders had little interest in purchasing or transporting intact slave families; in the early years, planters demanded only the young male slaves needed for heavy labor. Later, in the interest of creating a \"self-reproducing labor force\", planters purchased nearly equal numbers of men and women. Berlin wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The internal slave trade became the largest enterprise in the South outside the plantation itself, and probably the most advanced in its employment of modern transportation, finance, and publicity. The slave trade industry developed its own unique language, with terms such as \"prime hands, bucks, breeding wenches, and \"fancy girls\" coming into common use.<ref>Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity'', pp. 166\u201369.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe expansion of the interstate slave trade contributed to the \"economic revival of once depressed seaboard states\" as demand accelerated the value of slaves who were subject to sale.<ref>Kolchin, p. 98.</ref>\n\nSome traders moved their \"chattels\" by sea, with [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] being the most common route, but most slaves were forced to walk overland. Others were shipped downriver from such markets as [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] on the Ohio River, and [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]] on the Mississippi. Traders created regular migration routes served by a network of slave pens, yards, and warehouses needed as temporary housing for the slaves. In addition, other vendors provided clothes, food, and supplies for slaves. As the trek advanced, some slaves were sold and new ones purchased. Berlin concluded, \"In all, the slave trade, with its hubs and regional centers, its spurs and circuits, reached into every cranny of southern society. Few southerners, black or white, were untouched.\"<ref>Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity'', pp. 168\u201371.</ref>\n\nOnce the trip ended, slaves faced a life on the frontier significantly different from most labor in the Upper South. Clearing trees and starting crops on virgin fields was harsh and backbreaking work. A combination of inadequate nutrition, bad water, and exhaustion from both the journey and the work weakened the newly arrived slaves and produced casualties. New plantations were located at rivers' edges for ease of transportation and travel. [[Mosquito]]es and other environmental challenges spread disease, which took the lives of many slaves. They had acquired only limited immunities to lowland diseases in their previous homes. The death rate was so high that, in the first few years of hewing a plantation out of the wilderness, some planters preferred whenever possible to use rented slaves rather than their own.<ref>Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity'', p. 174.</ref>\n\nThe harsh conditions on the frontier increased slave resistance and led owners and overseers to rely on violence for control. Many of the slaves were new to cotton fields and unaccustomed to the \"sunrise-to-sunset gang labor\" required by their new life. Slaves were driven much harder than when they had been in growing tobacco or [[wheat]] back east. Slaves had less time and opportunity to improve the quality of their lives by raising their own [[livestock]] or tending vegetable gardens, for either their own consumption or trade, as they could in the east.<ref>Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity'', pp. 175\u201377.</ref>\n\nIn [[French Louisiana|Louisiana]], French colonists had established [[sugar cane]] plantations and exported sugar as the chief commodity crop. After the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803, Americans entered the state and joined the sugar cultivation. Between 1810 and 1830, planters bought slaves from the North and the number of slaves increased from less than 10,000 to more than 42,000. Planters preferred young males, who represented two-thirds of the slave purchases. Dealing with sugar cane was even more physically demanding than growing cotton. The largely young, unmarried male slave force made the reliance on violence by the owners \"especially savage\".<ref>Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity'', pp. 179\u201380.</ref>\n\n[[New Orleans]] became nationally important as a slave market and port, as slaves were shipped from there upriver by [[steamboat]] to plantations on the Mississippi River; it also sold slaves who had been shipped downriver from markets such as Louisville. By 1840, it had the largest slave market in North America. It became the wealthiest and the fourth-largest city in the nation, based chiefly on the slave trade and associated businesses.<ref>Walter Johnson, ''Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave Market'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1999.</ref> The trading season was from September to May, after the harvest.<ref>Johnson (1999), ''Soul by Soul'', p. 2.</ref>\n\nSlave traders were men of low reputation, even in the South.

The power relationships of slavery corrupted many whites who had authority over slaves, with children showing their own cruelty. Masters and overseers resorted to physical punishments to impose their wills. Slaves were punished by whipping, shackling, hanging, beating, burning, mutilation, branding and imprisonment. Punishment was most often meted out in response to disobedience or perceived infractions, but sometimes abuse was carried out to re-assert the dominance of the master or overseer of the slave.<ref>Moore, p. 114.</ref> Treatment was usually harsher on large plantations, which were often managed by overseers and owned by absentee slaveholders, conditions permitting abuses.\n\n[[William Wells Brown]], who escaped to freedom, reported that on one plantation, slave men were required to pick 80 pounds per day of cotton, while women were required to pick 70 pounds; if any slave failed in his or her quota, they were subject to whip lashes for each pound they were short. The whipping post stood next to the cotton scales.<ref>Clinton, Catherine, ''Scholastic Encyclopedia of the Civil War'', New York: Scholastic Inc., 1999, p. 8.</ref> A New York man who attended a slave auction in the mid-19th century reported that at least three-quarters of the male slaves he saw at sale had scars on their backs from whipping.<ref name=\"McInnis2011\">{{cite book|author=Maurie D.

Slaveholders published articles in southern agricultural journals to share best practices in treatment and management of slaves; they intended to show that their system was better than the living conditions of northern industrial workers.\n\nMedical care for slaves was limited in terms of the medical knowledge available to anyone. It was generally provided by other slaves or by slaveholders' family members, although sometimes \"plantation physicians\", like [[J. Marion Sims]], were called by the owners to protect their investment by treating sick slaves. Many slaves possessed medical skills needed to tend to each other, and used folk remedies brought from Africa.

This was a common requirement in other states as well, and locally run patrols (known to slaves as ''pater rollers'') often checked the passes of slaves who appeared to be away from their plantations. In Alabama slaves were prohibited from trading goods among themselves. In Virginia, a slave was not permitted to drink in public within one mile of his master or during public gatherings. Slaves were not permitted to carry firearms in any of the slave states.\n\nSlaves were generally prohibited by law from associating in groups, with the exception of worship services (a reason why the [[Black church]] is such a notable institution in black communities today). Following [[Nat Turner]]'s rebellion in 1831, which raised white fears throughout the South, some states also prohibited or restricted religious gatherings of slaves, or required that they be officiated by white men.

In ''Time on the Cross'', Fogel and Engerman equate efficiency to [[total factor productivity]] (TFP)\u2014the output per average unit of input on a farm. Using this measurement, Southern farms that enslaved black people using the [[gang system]] were 35% more efficient than Northern farms which used free labor. Under the gang system, groups of slaves perform synchronized tasks under the constant vigilance of an overseer. Each group was like a part of a machine. If perceived to be working below his capacity, a slave could be punished.

Although the prices of slaves relative to indentured servants declined, both got more expensive. Cotton production was rising and relied on the use of slaves to yield high profits.

Over the life-cycle, the price of enslaved women was higher than their male counterparts up to puberty age, as they would likely bear children and produce more slaves, in addition to serving as laborers. Men around the age of 25 were the most valued, as they were at the highest level of productivity and still had a considerable life-span. If slaves had a history of fights or escapes, their price was lowered reflecting what planters believed was risk of repeating such behavior. Slave traders and buyers would examine a slave's back for whipping scars\u2014a large number of injuries would be seen as evidence of laziness or rebelliousness, rather than the previous master's brutality, and would lower the slave's price.<ref name=\"McInnis2011\" /> Taller male slaves were priced at a higher level, as height was viewed as a proxy for fitness and productivity.<ref name=\"Fogel and Engeman\" />\n\nThe conditions of the market led to shocks in the supply and demand of slaves, which in turn changed prices. For example, slaves became more expensive after 1808, when no more could be imported. The market for the products of their work also affected slaves' economic value: demand for slaves fell with the price of cotton in 1840. Anticipation of changes also had a huge influence on prices. As the Civil War progressed, there was great doubt that slavery would continue to be legal, and prime males in New Orleans were sold at $1,116 by 1862 as opposed to $1,381 in 1861.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kotlikoff|first=L.

Davis writes that black women were needed for their \u201csexual and reproductive labor to satisfy the economic, political, and personal interest of white men of the elite class\u201d <ref>{{Cite book|title=Sister Circle: Black Women and Work|last=Davis|first=Adrienne|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0813530611|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sistercircle00rutg/page/107 107]|chapter=\"Don't Let Nobody Bother Yo' Prinicple\" The Sexual Economy of American Slavery|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/sistercircle00rutg/page/107}}</ref> articulating that black women's reproductive capacity was important in the maintenance of the system of slavery due to its ability to perpetuate an enslaved workforce. She is also drawing attention to black women's labor being needed to maintain the aristocracy of a white ruling class, due to the intimate nature of reproduction and its potential for producing more enslaved peoples.\n\nDue to the institution of ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]'', black women's wombs became the site where slavery was developed and transferred,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sister Circle: Black Women and Work|last=Davis|first=Adrienne|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0813530611|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sistercircle00rutg/page/108 108]|chapter=\"Don't Let Nobody Bother Yo' Principle\" Sexual Economy of American Slavery|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/sistercircle00rutg/page/108}}</ref> meaning that black women were not only used for their physical labor, but for their sexual and reproductive labor as well.\n\n<blockquote>\"The rule that the children\u2019s status follows their mothers\u2019 was a foundational one for our economy.

Davis writes how black women performed labor under slavery, writing: \u201c[black women were] male when convenient and horrifically female when needed\u201d<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|title=Sister Circle: Black Women and Work|last=Davis|first=Adrienne|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0813530611|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sistercircle00rutg/page/119 119]|chapter=\"Don't Let Nobody Bother Yo' Principle\" The Sexual Economy of American Slavery|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/sistercircle00rutg/page/119}}</ref> The fluctuating expectations of black women's gendered labor under slavery disrupted the white normative roles that were assigned to white men and white women. This ungendering black women received under slavery contributed to the systemic dehumanization experienced by enslaved black women, as they were unable to receive the expectations or experiences of either gender within the white binary.\n\nDavis\u2019 arguments addresses the fact that under slavery, black women's sexuality became linked to the economic and public sphere, making their intimate lives into public institutions. Black women's physical labor was gendered as masculine under slavery when they were needed to yield more profit, but their reproductive capacities and sexual labor was equally as important in maintaining white power over black communities and perpetuating an enslaved workforce.<ref name=\":02\" /> This blurring of the line between the private and public sphere is another way Davis articulates how black women's sexuality and reproduction was commodified and exploited for capitalist gain, as their private and intimate lives became disrupted by the violence at the hands of white men, and their sexual capacities became an important part of the public marketplace and United States economy.\n\n==1850s==\n\n[[File:Eastman Johnson - A Ride for Liberty -- The Fugitive Slaves - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eastman Johnson]] (American, 1824\u20131906).

This met with considerable overt and covert resistance in free states and cities such as Philadelphia, New York, and Boston. Refugees from slavery continued to flee the South across the [[Ohio River]] and other parts of the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]] dividing North from South, to the North and Canada via the [[Underground Railroad]]. Some white northerners helped hide former slaves from their former owners or helped them reach freedom in Canada.<ref>Larry Gara, '' The Liberty Line: The Legend of the Underground Railroad'' (University Press of Kentucky, 2013).</ref>\n\nAs part of the [[Compromise of 1850]], Congress abolished the slave trade (though not the ownership of slaves) in the [[District of Columbia]]; fearing this would happen, [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], regional slave trading center and port, successfully sought [[District of Columbia retrocession|its removal from the District of Columbia and devolution to Virginia]].  After 1854, [[History of the United States  Republican Party|Republicans]] argued that the \"[[Slave Power]]\", especially the pro-slavery [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party in the South]], controlled two of the three branches of the Federal government.<ref>Leonard L.  Richards, ''The Slave Power: The Free North and Southern Domination, 1780\u20141860'' (LSU Press, 2000).</ref>\n\nThe abolitionists, realizing that the total elimination of slavery was as an immediate goal unrealistic, worked to prevent expansion of slavery into the western territories which eventually would be new states. The [[Missouri Compromise]], the [[Compromise of 1850]], and the [[Bleeding Kansas]] crisis dealt with whether new states would be slave or free, or how that was to be decided. Both sides were anxious about effects of these decisions on the balance of power in the [[U.S. Senate|Senate]].\n\n{{Main|Bleeding Kansas}}\nAfter the passage of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] in 1854, border fighting broke out in [[Kansas Territory]], where the question of whether it would be admitted to the Union as a [[slave state|slave]] or [[free state (USA)|free state]] was [[Popular Sovereignty|left to the inhabitants]]. Migrants from free and slave states moved into the territory to prepare for the vote on slavery. Abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] was active in the fighting in \"Bleeding Kansas,\" but so too were many white Southerners who opposed abolition.\n\nAbraham Lincoln's and the Republicans' political platform in 1860 was to stop slavery's expansion. Historian James McPherson says that in a famous speech in 1858, Lincoln said American republicanism can be purified by restricting the further expansion of slavery as the first step to putting it on the road to 'ultimate extinction.' Southerners took Lincoln at his word. When he won the presidency they left the Union to escape the 'ultimate extinction' of slavery.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=James M.

Sandford|Freedom suits}}\nWith the development of slave and free states after the American Revolution, and far-flung commercial and military activities, new situations arose in which slaves might be taken by masters into free states. Most free states not only prohibited slavery, but ruled that slaves brought and kept there illegally could be freed. Such cases were sometimes known as transit cases.<ref>Paul Finkelman, '' Dred Scott v. Sandford: a brief history with documents'' (Bedford Books, 1997). </ref>  [[Dred Scott]] and his wife Harriet Scott each [[freedom suit|sued for freedom]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] after the death of their master, based on their having been held in a free territory (the northern part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]] from which slavery was excluded under the terms of the [[Missouri Compromise]]). (Later the two cases were combined under Dred Scott's name.) Scott filed suit for freedom in 1846 and went through two state trials, the first denying and the second granting freedom to the couple (and, by extension, their two daughters, who had also been held illegally in free territories). For 28 years, Missouri state precedent had generally respected laws of neighboring free states and territories, ruling for freedom in such transit cases where slaves had been held illegally in free territory. But in the Dred Scott case, the State Supreme Court ruled against the slaves.<ref>{{cite book |first=Don E. |last=Fehrenbacher |authorlink=Don E. Fehrenbacher |title=The Dred Scott Case: Its Significance in American Law and Politics |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1978 |isbn=978-0-19-502403-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=btkgAQAAIAAJ }}</ref>\n\nAfter Scott and his team appealed the case to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], Chief Justice [[Roger B. Taney]], in a sweeping decision, denied Scott his freedom. The 1857 [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|decision]], decided 7\u20132, held that a slave did not become free when taken into a free state; Congress could not bar slavery from a territory; and people of African descent imported into the United States and held as slaves, or their descendants, could never be citizens and thus had no status to bring suit in a U.S. court. A state could not bar slaveowners from bringing slaves into that state. Many Republicans, including [[Abraham Lincoln]], considered the decision unjust and evidence that the [[Slave Power]] had seized control of the Supreme Court. Anti-slavery groups were enraged and slave owners encouraged, escalating the tensions that led to civil war.<ref>Fehrenbacher, ''The Dred Scott case: Its significance in American law and politics'' (2001).</ref>\n\n==Civil War and emancipation==\n{{Events leading to US Civil War}}\n\n===1860 presidential election===\n\nThe divisions became fully exposed with the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]]. The electorate split four ways. The Southern Democrats endorsed slavery, while the Republicans denounced it. The Northern Democrats said democracy required the people to decide on slavery locally, state by state and territory by territory. The [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]] said the survival of the Union was at stake and everything else should be compromised.<ref>David M. Potter, ''The Impending Crisis: America Before the Civil War, 1848\u20131861'' (Harper & Row\n, 1976).</ref>\n\nLincoln, the Republican, won with a plurality of popular votes and a majority of [[United States Electoral College|electoral votes]]. Lincoln, however, did not appear on the ballots of ten southern slave states. Many slave owners in the South feared that the real intent of the Republicans was the abolition of slavery in states where it already existed, and that the sudden emancipation of four million slaves would be disastrous for the slave owners and for the economy that drew its greatest profits from the labor of people who were not paid. The slave owners feared that ending the balance could lead to the domination of the federal government by the northern free states. This led seven southern states to [[Ordinance of Secession|secede from the Union]]. When the southern forces attacked a US Army installation at Fort Sumter, the [[American Civil War]] began and four additional slave states seceded. Northern leaders had viewed the slavery interests as a threat politically, but with secession, they viewed the prospect of a new Southern nation, the [[Confederate States of America]], with control over the [[Mississippi River]] and parts of the [[Western United States|West]], as politically unacceptable.  Most of all they could not accept this repudiation of American nationalism.<ref>Potter, pp 448\u2013554. </ref>\n\n===Civil War===\nThe consequent [[American Civil War]], beginning in 1861, led to the end of chattel slavery in America. Not long after the war broke out, through a legal maneuver credited to Union General [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin F. Butler]], a lawyer by profession, slaves who came into Union \"possession\" were considered [[contraband (American Civil War)|\"contraband of war\"]]. General Butler ruled that they were not subject to return to Confederate owners as they had been before the war. Soon word spread, and many slaves sought refuge in Union territory, desiring to be declared \"contraband\". Many of the \"contrabands\" joined the [[Union Army]] as workers or troops, forming entire regiments of the [[United States Colored Troops|U.S. Colored Troops]]. Others went to refugee camps such as the [[Grand Contraband Camp]] near [[Fort Monroe]] or fled to northern cities. General Butler's interpretation was reinforced when Congress passed the [[Confiscation Act of 1861]], which declared that any property used by the Confederate military, including slaves, could be confiscated by Union forces.\n\n[[File:Timothy H. O'Sullivan (American - Slaves, J. J. Smith's Plantation, South Carolina - Google Art Project.jpg|left|thumb|Slaves on J. J. Smith's cotton plantation near [[Beaufort, South Carolina]], photographed by [[Timothy H. O'Sullivan|Timothy O'Sullivan]] standing before their quarters in 1862]]\nAt the beginning of the war, some Union commanders thought they were supposed to return escaped slaves to their masters. By 1862, when it became clear that this would be a long war, the question of what to do about slavery became more general. The Southern economy and military effort depended on slave labor. It began to seem unreasonable to protect slavery while blockading Southern commerce and destroying Southern production. As Congressman [[George Washington Julian|George W. Julian]] of Indiana put it in an 1862 speech in Congress, the slaves \"cannot be neutral. As laborers, if not as soldiers, they will be allies of the rebels, or of the Union.\"<ref>[[James M. McPherson|McPherson]], ''[[Battle Cry of Freedom (book)|Battle Cry of Freedom]]'', p. 495.</ref> Julian and his fellow Radical Republicans put pressure on Lincoln to rapidly emancipate the slaves, whereas moderate Republicans came to accept gradual, compensated emancipation and colonization.<ref>McPherson, ''Battle Cry'', pp. 355, 494\u20136, quote from [[George Washington Julian|George Julian]] on 495.</ref> [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]], the [[Border states (Civil War)|border states]] and [[War Democrats]] opposed emancipation, although the border states and War Democrats eventually accepted it as part of [[total war]] needed to save the Union.\n\n===Emancipation Proclamation===\n{{Main|Emancipation Proclamation}}\n\nThe Emancipation Proclamation was an executive order issued by President Lincoln on January 1, 1863. In a single stroke it changed the legal status, as recognized by the U.S. government, of 3 million slaves in designated areas of the Confederacy from \"slave\" to \"free\". It had the practical effect that as soon as a slave escaped the control of the Confederate government, by running away or through advances of federal troops, the slave became legally and actually free. Plantation owners, realizing that emancipation would destroy their economic system, sometimes moved their slaves as far as possible out of reach of the Union army.

G. Hodges, April 4, 1864.</ref>}}\n\nLincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863 was a powerful action that promised freedom for slaves in the Confederacy as soon as the Union armies reached them, and authorized the enlistment of African Americans in the Union Army. The Emancipation Proclamation did not free slaves in the Union-allied slave-holding states that bordered the Confederacy. Since the Confederate States did not recognize the authority of President Lincoln, and the proclamation did not apply in the [[border states (Civil War)|border states]], at first the proclamation freed only those slaves who had escaped behind Union lines. The proclamation made the abolition of slavery an official war goal that was implemented as the Union took territory from the Confederacy. According to the Census of 1860, this policy would free nearly four million slaves, or over 12% of the total population of the United States.\n\nBased on the President's war powers, the Emancipation Proclamation applied to territory held by Confederates at the time. However, the Proclamation became a symbol of the Union's growing commitment to add emancipation to the Union's definition of liberty.<ref>James McPherson, ''The War that Never Goes Away''.</ref> Lincoln played a leading role in getting the constitutionally-required two-thirds majority of both houses of Congress to vote for the Thirteenth Amendment,<ref name=\"Who Freed\">James McPherson, \"Drawn With the Sword\", from the article \"Who Freed the Slaves?\"</ref> which made emancipation universal and permanent.\n[[File:Family of African American slaves on Smith's Plantation Beaufort South Carolina.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.95|Four [[generation]]s of a [[slave]] family, Smith's Plantation, [[Beaufort, South Carolina]], 1862]]\nEnslaved African Americans had not waited for Lincoln before escaping and seeking freedom behind Union lines. From early years of the war, hundreds of thousands of African Americans escaped to Union lines, especially in Union-controlled areas such as [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] and the [[Hampton Roads]] region in 1862 Virginia, Tennessee from 1862 on, the line of Sherman's march, etc. So many African Americans fled to Union lines that commanders created camps and schools for them, where both adults and children learned to read and write. The [[American Missionary Association]] entered the war effort by sending teachers south to such contraband camps, for instance, establishing schools in Norfolk and on nearby plantations.\n\nIn addition, nearly 200,000 African-American men served with distinction in the Union forces as soldiers and sailors. Most were escaped slaves. The Confederacy was outraged by armed black soldiers and refused to treat them as [[prisoners of war]]. They murdered many, as at the [[Fort Pillow Massacre]], and re-enslaved others.<ref>{{cite book|last=Doyle |first=Robert C.

Thousands of slaves were freed by the operation of the Emancipation Proclamation as Union armies marched across the South. Emancipation came to the remaining southern slaves after the surrender of all Confederate troops in spring 1865.\n\nIn spite of the South's shortage of manpower, until 1865, most Southern leaders opposed arming slaves as soldiers. However, a few Confederates discussed arming slaves. Finally in early 1865 General Robert E. Lee said black soldiers were essential, and legislation was passed.

Blackmon]] reported in his [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning book ''[[Slavery By Another Name]]'' that many blacks were virtually enslaved under [[convict leasing]] programs, which started after the Civil War. Most Southern states had no prisons; they leased convicts to businesses and farms for their labor, and the lessee paid for food and board. The incentives for abuse were satisfied.\n\nThe continued involuntary servitude took various forms, but the primary forms included [[Convict lease|convict leasing]], [[peon]]age, and [[sharecropping]], with the latter eventually encompassing poor whites as well. By the 1930s, whites constituted most of the sharecroppers in the South. Mechanization of agriculture had reduced the need for farm labor, and many blacks left the South in the Great Migration. Jurisdictions and states created fines and sentences for a wide variety of minor crimes, and used these as an excuse to arrest and sentence blacks. Under convict leasing programs, African American men, often guilty of no crime at all, were arrested, compelled to work without pay, repeatedly bought and sold, and coerced to do the bidding of the leaseholder. Sharecropping, as it was practiced during this period, often involved severe restrictions on the freedom of movement of sharecroppers, who could be whipped for leaving the plantation. Both sharecropping and convict leasing were legal and tolerated by both the north and south. However, peonage was an illicit form of forced labor. Its existence was ignored by authorities while thousands of African Americans and poor Anglo Americans were subjugated and held in bondage until the mid 1960s to the late 1970s. With the exception of cases of peonage, beyond the period of Reconstruction, the federal government took almost no action to enforce the 13th Amendment until December 1941 when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt summoned his attorney general. Five days after Pearl Harbor, at the request of the president Attorney General Francis Biddle issued [[s:Circular No. 3591|Circular No. 3591]] to all federal prosecutors, instructing them to actively investigate and try any case of involuntary servitude or slavery. Several months later, convict leasing was officially abolished. But aspects have persisted in other forms, while historians argue that other systems of penal labor, were all created in 1865 and convict leasing was simply the most oppressive form.  Over time a large [[Civil rights movement (1896\u20131954)|civil rights movement]] arose to bring full civil rights and equality under the law to all Americans.\n<ref>Thomas C. Holt, ed. ''Major Problems in African-American History: From Freedom to \"Freedom Now,\" 1865\u20131990s'' (2000),</ref>\n\n[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9MIn_9rKQzM Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome](PTSS) is the theory behind the adaptive and survival behavior reflected in African American communities, as a result from chattel slavery and multigenerational trauma from slaves to their decedents. PTSS is an intercultural phenomenon that shows up across those communities due to the social construction of race and the \u201cother\u201d in conjunction to the creation of racial hierarchy. Quite often these behaviors are seen as \u201ccultural\u201d, because they have been socialized as \u201cnormal\u201d within the groups. On a social scale, African American communities can reflect interdependent orientation: where identity is relational to the white majority group,and conflict has to be managed in relationship to that majority. On an inter-cultural/personal scale, African American communities can reflect independent orientation: where individual initiation and socialization are used to assert personal opinions and hold individuals accountable for their mistakes.

Intercultural Communication and Social Justice(2nd ed.)] Dissociation with race and community happens and can have varying extremes. \n\n===Convict leasing===\n{{Main|Convict lease}}\n\nWith emancipation a legal reality, white Southerners were concerned with both controlling the newly freed slaves and keeping them in the labor force at the lowest level. The system of [[convict lease|convict leasing]] began during Reconstruction and was fully implemented in the 1880s and officially ending in the last state, Alabama, in 1928. It persisted in various forms until it was abolished in 1942 by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] during [[World War II]], several months after the attack on [[Pearl Harbor]] involved the U.S. in the conflict. This system allowed private contractors to purchase the services of convicts from the state or local governments for a specific time period. African Americans, due to \"vigorous and selective enforcement of laws and discriminatory sentencing,\" made up the vast majority of the convicts leased.<ref>Litwack (1998), p. 271.</ref> Writer Douglas A. Blackmon writes of the system:\n\n{{quote|It was a form of bondage distinctly different from that of the antebellum South in that for most men, and the relatively few women drawn in, this slavery did not last a lifetime and did not automatically extend from one generation to the next. But it was nonetheless slavery \u2013 a system in which armies of free men, guilty of no crimes and entitled by law to freedom, were compelled to labor without compensation, were repeatedly bought and sold, and were forced to do the bidding of white masters through the regular application of extraordinary physical coercion.<ref>Blackmon (2008), p. 4.</ref>}}\n\nThe constitutional basis for convict leasing is that the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], while abolishing slavery and involuntary servitude generally, expressly [[Penal labor in the United States|permits it as a punishment for crime]].\n\n===Educational issues===\n{{Main|Education during the Slave Period|Education of freed people during the Civil War}}\n[[File:Freedmen richmond sewing women.jpg|thumb|An industrial school set up for ex-slaves in Richmond during Reconstruction]]\nThe [[anti-literacy law]]s after 1832 contributed greatly to the problem of widespread illiteracy facing the [[freedmen]] and other African Americans after Emancipation and the Civil War 35 years later. The problem of illiteracy and need for education was seen as one of the greatest challenges confronting these people as they sought to join the [[free enterprise system]] and support themselves during Reconstruction and thereafter.\n\nConsequently, many black and white religious organizations, former Union Army officers and soldiers, and wealthy philanthropists were inspired to create and fund educational efforts specifically for the betterment of African Americans; some African Americans had started their own schools before the end of the war. Northerners helped create numerous [[normal school]]s, such as those that became [[Hampton University]] and [[Tuskegee University]], to generate teachers, as well as other [[Historically black colleges and universities|colleges for former slaves]]. Blacks held teaching as a high calling, with education the first priority for children and adults. Many of the most talented went into the field. Some of the schools took years to reach a high standard, but they managed to get thousands of teachers started. As [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] noted, the black colleges were not perfect, but \"in a single generation they put thirty thousand black teachers in the South\" and \"wiped out the illiteracy of the majority of black people in the land\".<ref>{{cite book |first=James D. |last=Anderson |title=The Education of Blacks in the South, 1860\u20131935 |location=Chapel Hill, NC |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |year=1988 |pages=244\u201345 |isbn=978-0-8078-1793-3 |title-link=The Education of Blacks in the South, 1860\u20131935 }}</ref>\n\nNorthern philanthropists continued to support black education in the 20th century, even as tensions rose within the black community, exemplified by [[Booker T.

By counting only named slaveholders, this approach does not acknowledge people who benefited from slavery by being in a slaveowning household, e.g. the wife and children of an owner; in 1850, there was an average of 5.55 people per household,<ref>[https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/10/01/the-number-of-people-in-the-average-u-s-household-is-going-up-for-the-first-time-in-over-160-years/ Pew Research Center: The number of people in the average U.S. household is going up for the first time in over 160 years]</ref> so on average, around 8.05% of free persons lived in a slaveowning household.

This was in part due to the circumstance that most slaveholders were literate and left behind written records, whereas slaves were largely illiterate and not in a position to leave written records. Scholars differed as to whether slavery should be considered a benign or a \"harshly exploitive\" institution.<ref name=\"Kolchin p. 134\">Kolchin p. 134.</ref>\n\nMuch of the history written prior to the 1950s had a distinctive racist slant to it.<ref name=\"Kolchin p. 134\" /> By the 1970s and 1980s, historians were using [[archaeological]] records, black [[folklore]], and statistical data to develop a much more detailed and nuanced picture of slave life. Individuals were shown to have been resilient and somewhat autonomous in many of their activities, within the limits of their situation and despite its precariousness.

Slavery had been practiced in [[British America]] from early [[Slavery in the colonial United States|colonial days]], and was legal in all [[thirteen colonies]] at the time of the Declaration of Independence in 1776. Under the law, an enslaved person was treated as property and could be bought, sold, or given away. Slavery lasted in about half of U.S. [[US state|states]] until 1865. As an economic system, slavery was largely replaced by [[sharecropping]] and [[convict leasing]].\n\nBy the time of the [[American Revolution]] (1775\u20131783), the status of enslaved people had been institutionalized as a racial [[caste]] associated with African ancestry.<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://www.slate.com/articles/life/the_history_of_american_slavery/2015/05/why_america_adopted_race_based_slavery.html |title= The Birth of Race-Based Slavery |last=Wood |first=Peter |date=2003 |journal=Slate |id= (May 19, 2015): Reprinted from \"Strange New Land: Africans in Colonial America\" by Peter H.

Some slaveowners\u2014primarily in the Upper South\u2014[[manumission|freed]] the people they had enslaved, and philanthropists and charitable groups bought and freed other enslaved people.

The United States became ever more polarized over the issue of slavery, split into [[slave and free states]].

The new [[Territories of the United States|territories]] acquired via the [[Louisiana purchase]] and the [[Mexican cession]] were the subject of major political crises and compromises. By 1850, the newly-rich, cotton-growing South was threatening to secede from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], and tensions continued to rise. [[Slavery as a positive good in the United States|Slavery was defended in the South as a \"positive good\"]], and large Protestant denominations split over the slavery issue into regional organizations of the North and South. \n\nWhen [[Abraham Lincoln]] won the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 election]] on a platform of halting the expansion of slavery, seven states broke away to form the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. Shortly afterward, the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] began when Confederate forces attacked the US Army's [[Fort Sumter]]. Four additional slave states then seceded after Lincoln requested arms from them to make a retaliatory strike. Due to Union measures such as the [[Confiscation Acts]] and the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in 1863, the war effectively ended slavery even before the institution was banned by constitutional amendment. Following the Union victory in the Civil War, slavery was made illegal in the United States upon the ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] in December 1865. Slavery briefly returned to US territory when the US federal government allowed the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] in the [[Philippines]] (a US possession during the first half of the twentieth century) to continue to practice slavery.<ref name=\"Immerwahr2020\">{{cite book |last=Daniel Immerwahr |title=How to Hide an Empire: A History of the Greater United States |year=2020 |publisher=MacMillan |location=New York |isbn=9781250251091 |chapter=Chapter Six: Shouting the Battle Cry of Freedom |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GYtbDwAAQBAJ&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&lpg=PP1&dq=how%20to%20hide%20an%20empire%20immerwahr&pg=PT73#v=onepage&q=thirteenth%20amendment&f=false }}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n{{Main|Slavery in the colonial United States}}\n{{further|Indian slave trade|Slavery in New France}}\n\n===First Indigenous enslavements===\nAfricans first came to the New World with Christopher Columbus in 1492.

The historian [[Ira Berlin]] noted that what he called the \"charter generation\" in the colonies was sometimes made up of mixed-race men (Atlantic Creoles) who were indentured servants, and whose ancestry was African and Iberian. They were descendants of African women and Portuguese or Spanish men who worked in African ports as traders or facilitators in the trade of enslaved people. For example, [[Anthony Johnson (colonist)|Anthony Johnson]] arrived in Virginia in 1621 from Angola as an indentured servant; he became free and a property owner, eventually buying and enslaving people himself. The transformation of the social status of Africans, from indentured servitude to slaves in a racial caste which they could not leave or escape, happened gradually.\n\n===First slave laws===\nThere were no laws regarding slavery early in Virginia's history.

A neighbor, Robert Parker, told Johnson that if he did not release Casor, he would testify in court to this fact. Under local laws, Johnson was at risk for losing some of his [[headright]] lands for violating the terms of indenture. Under duress, Johnson freed Casor. Casor entered into a seven years' indenture with Parker. Feeling cheated, Johnson sued Parker to repossess Casor. A [[Northampton County, Virginia]] court ruled for Johnson, declaring that Parker illegally was detaining Casor from his rightful master who legally held him \"for the duration of his life\".<ref>William J.

England had no system of naturalizing immigrants to its island or its colonies. Since persons of African origins were not English subjects by birth, they were among those peoples considered foreigners and generally outside [[English common law]]. The colonies struggled with how to classify people born to foreigners and subjects. In 1656 Virginia, [[Elizabeth Key Grinstead]], a [[mixed-race]] woman, successfully gained her freedom and that of her son in a challenge to her status by making her case as the baptized Christian daughter of the free Englishman Thomas Key. Her attorney was an English subject, which may have helped her case. (He was also the father of her mixed-race son, and the couple married after Key was freed.)<ref name=\"Banks\">[http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/fac_pubs/52/ Taunya Lovell Banks, \"Dangerous Woman: Elizabeth Key's Freedom Suit \u2013 Subjecthood and Racialized Identity in Seventeenth Century Colonial Virginia\"], Digital Commons Law, University of Maryland Law School.

A child of an enslaved mother would be born into slavery, regardless if the father were a freeborn Englishman or Christian. This was a reversal of [[common law]] practice in England, which ruled that children of English subjects took the status of the father. The change institutionalized the skewed power relationships between those who enslaved people and enslaved women, freed white men from the legal responsibility to acknowledge or financially support their [[mixed-race]] children, and somewhat confined the open scandal of mixed-race children and [[miscegenation]] to within the slave quarters.\n\n===Increasing slave trade===\nIn 1672, King Charles II rechartered the [[Royal African Company]] (it had initially been set up in 1660), as an English monopoly for the African slave and commodities trade\u2014thereafter in 1698, by statute, the English parliament opened the trade to all English subjects.<ref name=\"pbs.org1\">https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part1/1narr3.html</ref>  The trade of enslaved people to the mid-Atlantic colonies increased substantially in the 1680s, and by 1710 the African population in Virginia had increased to 23,100 (42% of total); Maryland contained 8,000 Africans (14.5% of total).<ref>Wood, ''Origins of American Slavery'' (1997), p. 88.</ref>  In the early 18th century, England passed Spain and Portugal to become the world's leading trader of enslaved people.<ref name=\"pbs.org\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/ism/slavery/europe/index.aspx|title=European traders|last=|first=|date=|website=International Slavery Museum|publisher=National Museums Liverpool|access-date=2019-11-15}}</ref> From the early 18th century American merchants, especially in [[Charleston, S.C.]], challenged the monopoly of the Royal African Company, and [[Joseph Wragg]] and Benjamin Savage became the first independent traders of enslaved people to break through the monopoly by the 1730s.<ref>Pamela Chase Hain, A Confederate Chronicle: The Life of a Civil War Survivor, p. 2, 2005</ref>\n\n===First religious status laws===\nThe Virginia [[Slave codes]] of 1705 further defined as slaves those people imported from nations that were not [[Christians|Christian]].

Slavery was then legal in the other twelve English colonies. Neighboring South Carolina had an economy based on the use of enslaved labor. The Georgia Trustees wanted to eliminate the risk of [[slave rebellions]] and make Georgia better able to defend against attacks from the Spanish to the south, who offered freedom to escaped enslaved people. [[James Edward Oglethorpe]] was the driving force behind the colony, and the only trustee to reside in Georgia. He opposed slavery on moral grounds as well as for pragmatic reasons, and vigorously defended the ban on slavery against fierce opposition from Carolina merchants of enslaved people and land speculators.<ref>Wilson, Thomas D., ''The Oglethorpe Plan: Enlightenment Design in Savannah and Beyond'', Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 2012, chapter 3</ref><ref name=\"cornerstones\">{{Cite book | publisher = University of Georgia Press | isbn = 978-0-8203-1743-4 | last = Scott | first = Thomas Allan | title = Cornerstones of Georgia history| date = July 1995 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=0qdkKS2F42MC&pg=PA26 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = Thurmond: Why Georgia's founder fought slavery| accessdate = October 4, 2009| url = http://savannahnow.com/node/448938| url-status=dead| archiveurl = https://archive.today/20120715041234/http://savannahnow.com/node/448938| archivedate = July 15, 2012| df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Protestant]] [[Scottish people|Scottish]] highlanders who settled what is now [[Darien, Georgia]], added a moral anti-slavery argument, which became increasingly rare in the South, in their 1739 \"Petition of the Inhabitants of New Inverness\".<ref>\"It is shocking to human Nature, that any Race of Mankind and their Posterity should be sentanc'd to perpetual Slavery; nor in Justice can we think otherwise of it, that they are thrown amongst us to be our Scourge one Day or other for our Sins: And as Freedom must be as dear to them as it is to us, what a Scene of Horror must it bring about!

People enslaved in [[Northern United States|the North]] typically worked as house servants, artisans, laborers and craftsmen, with the greater number in cities. Many men worked on the docks and in shipping. In 1703, more than 42 percent of New York City households enslaved people, the second-highest proportion of any city in the colonies after [[Charleston, South Carolina]].<ref name=\"Nation\">[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20051107/slavery_in_new_york \"Slavery in New York\"], ''The Nation'', November 7, 2005</ref> But enslaved people were also used as agricultural workers in farm communities, including in areas of upstate New York and Long Island, Connecticut, and New Jersey.

Virginia bills to that effect were vetoed by the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|British Privy Council]]. [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] forbade the import of enslaved people in 1774.

They transported others to the Caribbean islands, and some to England.\n\nAt the same time, the British were transporting Loyalists and their slaves, primarily to the Caribbean, but some to Nova Scotia. For example, over 5,000 enslaved Africans owned by Loyalists were transported in 1782 with their owners from Savannah to [[Jamaica]] and [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]], Florida (then controlled by Britain). Similarly, over half of the black people evacuated in 1782 from Charleston by the British to the West Indies and Florida were slaves owned by white Loyalists.\n\nSlaves and free blacks also fought on the side of rebels during the Revolutionary War. Washington authorized slaves to be freed who fought with the American Continental Army.

[T]he {{bracket|[[Somerset v Stewart|Somerset]]}} ruling caused a sensation.... Numerous colonial newspapers covered it and warned of the tyranny it represented. Multiple historians have pointed out that in part because of the Somerset case, slavery joined other issues in helping to gradually drive apart the patriots and their colonial governments. ...[L]arge numbers of the enslaved came to see the struggle as one between freedom [under the British] and continued subjugation. As Waldstreicher writes, \u201cThe black-British alliance decisively pushed planters in these [Southern] states toward independence.\u201d\n\nThe culmination of this was the [[Dunmore Proclamation]].... A member of [[Colonial period of South Carolina|South Carolina]]\u2019s delegation to the Continental Congress wrote that this act did more to sever the ties between Britain and its colonies \"than any other expedient which could possibly have been thought of.\" The historian [[Jill Lepore]] writes in her recent book, ''These Truths: A History of the United States,'' \"Not the taxes and the tea, not the shots at Lexington and Concord, not the siege of Boston; rather, it was this act, Dunmore's offer of freedom to slaves, that tipped the scales in favor of American independence.\"<ref>{{cite news\n|newspaper=[[New York Times]]\n|date=December 20, 2019\n|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/20/magazine/letter-to-the-editor-historians-critique-the-1619-project-and-we-respond.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share\n|title=Editor's response\n|first=Jake\n|last=Silverstein\n|authorlink=Jake Silverstein}}</ref>}}\n\nWilentz later argued there were many more anti-slavery activists in the colonies at the time of the Revolution than in Britain, and Hannah-Jones, while she stood by her piece, conceded she phrased the contention too strongly in a way that might mislead about all the colonies and people involved.  She said subsequent materials based on the series would later be better contextualized.<ref name=Serwer/>\n\n===Constitution of the United States===\nSlavery was a contentious issue in the writing and approval of the [[Constitution of the United States]].<ref>Keith L.

As the historian James Oliver Horton noted, prominent slaveholder politicians and the commodity crops of the South had a strong influence on United States politics and economy. Horton said,\n\n<blockquote>in the 72 years between the election of George Washington and the election of Abraham Lincoln, 50 of those years [had] a slaveholder as president of the United States, and, for that whole period of time, there was never a person elected to a second term who was not a slaveholder.<ref name=\"pbs.org\" /></blockquote>\n\nThe power of Southern states in Congress lasted until the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], affecting national policies, legislation, and appointments.<ref name=\"pbs.org\">[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/social_issues/jan-june07/divided_01-25.html \"Interview: James Oliver Horton: Exhibit Reveals History of Slavery in New York City\"], PBS ''Newshour'', January 25, 2007.

This was expansion of the white, monied population: younger men seeking their fortune.\n\nThe most valuable crop that could be grown on a plantation in that climate was cotton. That crop was labor-intensive, and the least-costly laborers were slaves.

He felt that a multiracial society without slavery was untenable, as he believed that prejudice against blacks increased as they were granted more rights (for example, in northern states). He believed that the attitudes of white Southerners, and the concentration of the black population in the South, were bringing the white and black populations to a state of equilibrium, and were a danger to both races. Because of the racial differences between master and slave, he believed that the latter could not be emancipated.<ref name=\"Alexis de Tocqueville\">{{cite book|title=Democracy in America (Volume 1)|last=de Tocqueville |first=Alexise|chapter=Chapter XVIII: Future Condition Of Three Races In The United States|isbn=978-1-4209-2910-2}}</ref>\n\n[[Robert E. Lee]] wrote in 1856:\n\n{{quote|There are few, I believe, in this enlightened age, who will not acknowledge that slavery as an institution is a moral and political evil.

Leaders then described slavery as a beneficial scheme of labor management. [[John C. Calhoun]], in a famous speech in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] in 1837, declared that slavery was \"instead of an evil, a good\u2014a positive good\". Calhoun supported his view with the following reasoning: in every civilized society one portion of the community must live on the labor of another; learning, science, and the arts are built upon leisure; the African slave, kindly treated by his master and mistress and looked after in his old age, is better off than the free laborers of Europe; and under the slave system conflicts between capital and labor are avoided. The advantages of slavery in this respect, he concluded, \"will become more and more manifest, if left undisturbed by interference from without, as the country advances in wealth and numbers\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Beard |first1=Charles A. |authorlink1=Charles A.

In a speech to the Senate on March 4, 1858, Hammond developed his \"Mudsill Theory,\" defending his view on slavery stating: \"Such a class you must have, or you would not have that other class which leads progress, civilization, and refinement. It constitutes the very mud-sill of society and of political government; and you might as well attempt to build a house in the air, as to build either the one or the other, except on this mud-sill.\" Hammond believed that in every class one group must accomplish all the menial duties, because without them the leaders in society could not progress.<ref name=\"Mudsill Theory\"/> He argued that the hired laborers of the North were slaves too: \"The difference\u2026 is, that our slaves are hired for life and well compensated; there is no starvation, no begging, no want of employment,\" while those in the North had to search for employment.<ref name=\"Mudsill Theory\"/>\n\nGeorge Fitzhugh used assumptions about white superiority to justify slavery, writing that, \"the Negro is but a grown up child, and must be governed as a child.\" In ''The Universal Law of Slavery'', Fitzhugh argues that slavery provides everything necessary for life and that the slave is unable to survive in a free world because he is lazy, and cannot compete with the intelligent European white race. He states that \"The negro slaves of the South are the happiest, and in some sense, the freest people in the world.\"<ref name=\"Universal Law\">{{cite web|last=Fitzhugh|first=George|authorlink=George Fitzhugh|title=The Universal Law of Slavery|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4h3141t.html|accessdate=December 10, 2017}}</ref> Without the South, \"He (slave) would become an insufferable burden to society\" and \"Society has the right to prevent this, and can only do so by subjecting him to domestic slavery.\"<ref name=\"Universal Law\"/>\n\nOn March 21, 1861, [[Alexander Stephens]], Vice President of the Confederacy, delivered his [[Cornerstone Speech]].

What was conjecture with him, is now a realized fact. But whether he fully comprehended the great truth upon which that rock stood and stands, may be doubted.

What developed was a Northern block of free states united into one contiguous geographic area that generally shared an anti-slavery culture. The exceptions were the areas along the Ohio River settled by Southerners: the southern portions of Indiana, Ohio, and Illinois. Residents of those areas generally shared in Southern culture and attitudes. In addition, these areas were devoted to agriculture longer than the industrializing northern parts of these states, and some farmers used slave labor. In Illinois, for example, while the trade in slaves was prohibited, it was legal to bring slaves from Kentucky into Illinois and use them there, as long as the slaves left Illinois one day per year (they were \"visiting\").

They worked to raise awareness about the evils of slavery, and to build support for abolition.\n\nThis struggle took place amid strong support for slavery among white Southerners, who profited greatly from the system of enslaved labor. But slavery was entwined with the national economy; for instance, the banking, shipping, and manufacturing industries of New York City all had strong economic interests in slavery, as did similar industries in other major port cities in the North. The northern textile mills in New York and New England processed Southern cotton and manufactured clothes to outfit slaves. By 1822 half of New York City's exports were related to cotton.<ref name=\"divided\">[http://nydivided.org/VirtualExhibit/T1/G1/G1ReadMore.php \"King Cotton: Dramatic Growth of the Cotton Trade\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330070752/http://nydivided.org/VirtualExhibit/T1/G1/G1ReadMore.php |date=March 30, 2013 }}, ''New York Divided: Slavery and the Civil War'', New-York Historical Society, accessed May 12, 2012</ref>\n\nSlaveholders began to refer to slavery as the \"[[peculiar institution]]\" to differentiate it from other examples of [[forced labor]].

Cuffe believed that African Americans could more easily \"rise to be a people\" in Africa than in the U.S. because of the latter's slavery, racial discrimination, and limits on black rights. Although Cuffee died in 1817, his early efforts encouraged the ACS to promote further settlements. The [[Quakers]] opposed slavery but believed blacks would face better chances for freedom in Africa than in the U.S. Slaveholders opposed abolition, but wanted to get rid off [[freedmen]], which they saw as potential leaders of rebellions and people who encouraged slaves to run away.</ref> The ACS was made up mostly of [[Quakers]] and slaveholders, who found uneasy common ground in support of what was incorrectly called \"repatriation\". But by this time most black Americans were native-born and did not want to emigrate, saying they were no more African than the Americans were British. Rather, they wanted full rights in the United States, where their families had lived and worked for generations.\n\nIn 1822 the ACS and affiliated state societies established what would become the colony of [[Liberia]], in West Africa.<ref name=\"WDLMap\">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/446/ |title = Map of Liberia, West Africa |work = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1830 |accessdate = June 3, 2013}}</ref> The ACS assisted thousands of freedmen and free blacks (with legislated limits) to emigrate there from the United States. Many white people considered this preferable to [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]] in the United States. [[Henry Clay]], one of the founders and a prominent slaveholder politician from Kentucky, said that blacks faced\n\n<blockquote>unconquerable prejudice resulting from their color, they never could amalgamate with the free whites of this country.

After 1830, abolitionist and newspaper publisher [[William Lloyd Garrison]] promoted emancipation, characterizing slaveholding as a personal sin. He demanded that slaveowners repent and start the process of emancipation. His position increased defensiveness on the part of some Southerners, who noted the long history of slavery among many cultures. A few abolitionists, such as [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]], favored the use of armed force to foment uprisings among the slaves, as he attempted to do at [[Harper's Ferry]]. Most abolitionists tried to raise public support to change laws and to challenge slave laws. Abolitionists were active on the lecture circuit in the North, and often featured escaped slaves in their presentations. The eloquent [[Frederick Douglass]] became an important abolitionist leader after escaping from slavery. [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852) was an international bestseller and aroused popular sentiment against slavery. It also provoked the publication of numerous [[anti-Tom novels]] by Southerners in the years before the American Civil War.\n\n===Prohibiting the international trade===\nWhile under the Constitution, Congress could not prohibit the import slave trade until 1808, the third Congress regulated it in the [[Slave Trade Act of 1794]], which prohibited shipbuilding and outfitting for the trade. Subsequent acts [[Slave Trade Act of 1800|in 1800]] and 1803 sought to discourage the trade by limiting investment in import trading and prohibiting importation into states that had abolished slavery, which most in the North had by that time.<ref name=\"Regulation of the Trade\">{{cite web | url=http://abolition.nypl.org/essays/us_constitution/4/ | title=Regulation of the Trade | publisher=[[New York Public Library]] | accessdate=June 23, 2014}}</ref> The final [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves]] was adopted in 1807, effective in 1808.

From 1819, they were assisted by forces from the United States Navy. With the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] of 1842, the relationship with Britain was formalized, and the two countries jointly ran the [[Blockade of Africa]] with their navies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.potomacbooksinc.com/Books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=63330|title=Potomac Books \u2013 University of Nebraska Press \u2013 University of Nebraska Press|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015130620/http://www.potomacbooksinc.com/Books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=63330|archivedate=October 15, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Post-revolution Southern manumissions===\nAlthough Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware were slave states, the latter two already had a high proportion of free blacks by the outbreak of war. Following the Revolution, the three legislatures made [[manumission]] easier, allowed by deed or will. Quaker and Methodist ministers particularly urged slaveholders to free their slaves. The number and proportion of freed slaves in these states rose dramatically until 1810. More than half of the number of free blacks in the United States were concentrated in the Upper South. The proportion of free blacks among the black population in the Upper South rose from less than 1% in 1792 to more than 10% by 1810.<ref name=\"Peter Kolchin 1993 pp. 77-78\" /> In Delaware, nearly 75% of blacks were free by 1810.<ref>Kolchin (1993), ''American Slavery'', p. 78.</ref>\n\nIn the US as a whole, by 1810 the number of free blacks reached 186,446, or 13.5% of all blacks.<ref name=\"PeterKolchin\">Peter Kolchin (1993), ''American Slavery'', p. 81.</ref> After that period few slaves were freed, as the development of [[Plantations in the American South|cotton plantations]] featuring short-staple cotton in the Deep South drove up the internal demand for slaves in the domestic slave trade and high prices were paid.<ref>Kolchin (1993), ''American Slavery'', p. 87.</ref>\n\nSouth Carolina made manumission more difficult, requiring legislative approval of every instance of manumission. Several Southern states required manumitted slaves to leave the state within 30 days.\n\n===Domestic slave trade and forced migration===\n[[File:Slavery map.jpg|thumb|right|Movement of slaves between 1790 and 1860]]\n\nThe growing international demand for cotton led many plantation owners further west in search of suitable land. In addition, the invention of the [[cotton gin]] in 1793 enabled profitable processing of short-staple cotton, which could readily be grown in the uplands. The invention revolutionized the cotton industry by increasing fifty-fold the quantity of cotton that could be processed in a day. At the end of the [[War of 1812]], fewer than 300,000 bales of cotton were produced nationally. By 1820 the amount of cotton produced had increased to 600,000 bales, and by 1850 it had reached 4,000,000. There was an explosive growth of cotton cultivation throughout the [[Deep South]] and greatly increased demand for slave labor to support it.<ref>''The People's Chronology'', 1994, by James Trager.</ref> As a result, manumissions decreased dramatically in the South.<ref>Kolchin p. 96.\n\nThrough the domestic slave trade, about one million enslaved African Americans were forcibly removed from the Upper South to the Deep South, with some transported by ship in the coastwise trade. In 1834, [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Louisiana]] grew half the nation's cotton; by 1859, along with [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], they grew 78%. By 1859 cotton growth in the [[Carolinas]] had fallen to just 10% of the national total.

These sales of slaves broke up many families and caused much hardship. Characterizing it as the \"central event\" in the life of a slave between the [[American Revolution]] and the Civil War, Berlin wrote that whether slaves were directly uprooted or lived in fear that they or their families would be involuntarily moved, \"the massive deportation traumatized black people, both slave and free.\"<ref>Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity'', pp. 161\u201362.</ref> Individuals lost their connection to families and clans. Added to the earlier colonists combining slaves from different tribes, many ethnic Africans lost their knowledge of varying tribal origins in Africa. Most were descended from families who had been in the United States for many generations.<ref name=\"CUP\" />\n\nIn the 1840s, almost 300,000 slaves were transported, with Alabama and Mississippi receiving 100,000 each. During each decade between 1810 and 1860, at least 100,000 slaves were moved from their state of origin. In the final decade before the Civil War, 250,000 were moved. Michael Tadman wrote in ''Speculators and Slaves: Masters, Traders, and Slaves in the Old South'' (1989) that 60\u201370% of inter-regional migrations were the result of the sale of slaves. In 1820 a child in the Upper South had a 30% chance of being sold south by 1860.<ref>Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity'', pp. 168\u201369. Kolchin p. 96. Kolchin notes that Fogel and Engerman maintained that 84% of slaves moved with their families but \"most other scholars assign far greater weight \u2026 to slave sales.\" Ransome (p. 582) notes that Fogel and Engermann based their conclusions on the study of some counties in Maryland in the 1830s and attempted to extrapolate that analysis as reflective of the entire South over the entire period.</ref> The death rate for the slaves on their way to their new destination across the American South was less than that suffered by captives shipped across the Atlantic Ocean, but mortality was higher than the normal death rate.\n[[File:Slave Market-Atlanta Georgia 1864.jpg|Slave trader's business in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], 1864|thumb]]\n[[Interregional slave trade|Slave traders]] transported two-thirds of the slaves who moved west.<ref>{{cite book |first=Allan |last=Kulikoff |title=The Agrarian Origins of American Capitalism |location=Charlottesville |publisher=University of Virginia Press |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-8139-1388-9 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/agrarianoriginso00kuli/page/226 226]\u201369 |url=https://archive.org/details/agrarianoriginso00kuli |url-access=registration }}</ref> Only a minority moved with their families and existing master. Slave traders had little interest in purchasing or transporting intact slave families; in the early years, planters demanded only the young male slaves needed for heavy labor. Later, in the interest of creating a \"self-reproducing labor force\", planters purchased nearly equal numbers of men and women. Berlin wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The internal slave trade became the largest enterprise in the South outside the plantation itself, and probably the most advanced in its employment of modern transportation, finance, and publicity. The slave trade industry developed its own unique language, with terms such as \"prime hands, bucks, breeding wenches, and \"fancy girls\" coming into common use.<ref>Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity'', pp. 166\u201369.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe expansion of the interstate slave trade contributed to the \"economic revival of once depressed seaboard states\" as demand accelerated the value of slaves who were subject to sale.<ref>Kolchin, p. 98.</ref>\n\nSome traders moved their \"chattels\" by sea, with [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] being the most common route, but most slaves were forced to walk overland. Others were shipped downriver from such markets as [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] on the Ohio River, and [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]] on the Mississippi. Traders created regular migration routes served by a network of slave pens, yards, and warehouses needed as temporary housing for the slaves. In addition, other vendors provided clothes, food, and supplies for slaves. As the trek advanced, some slaves were sold and new ones purchased. Berlin concluded, \"In all, the slave trade, with its hubs and regional centers, its spurs and circuits, reached into every cranny of southern society. Few southerners, black or white, were untouched.\"<ref>Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity'', pp. 168\u201371.</ref>\n\nOnce the trip ended, slaves faced a life on the frontier significantly different from most labor in the Upper South. Clearing trees and starting crops on virgin fields was harsh and backbreaking work. A combination of inadequate nutrition, bad water, and exhaustion from both the journey and the work weakened the newly arrived slaves and produced casualties. New plantations were located at rivers' edges for ease of transportation and travel. [[Mosquito]]es and other environmental challenges spread disease, which took the lives of many slaves. They had acquired only limited immunities to lowland diseases in their previous homes. The death rate was so high that, in the first few years of hewing a plantation out of the wilderness, some planters preferred whenever possible to use rented slaves rather than their own.<ref>Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity'', p. 174.</ref>\n\nThe harsh conditions on the frontier increased slave resistance and led owners and overseers to rely on violence for control. Many of the slaves were new to cotton fields and unaccustomed to the \"sunrise-to-sunset gang labor\" required by their new life. Slaves were driven much harder than when they had been in growing tobacco or [[wheat]] back east. Slaves had less time and opportunity to improve the quality of their lives by raising their own [[livestock]] or tending vegetable gardens, for either their own consumption or trade, as they could in the east.<ref>Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity'', pp. 175\u201377.</ref>\n\nIn [[French Louisiana|Louisiana]], French colonists had established [[sugar cane]] plantations and exported sugar as the chief commodity crop. After the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803, Americans entered the state and joined the sugar cultivation. Between 1810 and 1830, planters bought slaves from the North and the number of slaves increased from less than 10,000 to more than 42,000. Planters preferred young males, who represented two-thirds of the slave purchases. Dealing with sugar cane was even more physically demanding than growing cotton. The largely young, unmarried male slave force made the reliance on violence by the owners \"especially savage\".<ref>Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity'', pp. 179\u201380.</ref>\n\n[[New Orleans]] became nationally important as a slave market and port, as slaves were shipped from there upriver by [[steamboat]] to plantations on the Mississippi River; it also sold slaves who had been shipped downriver from markets such as Louisville. By 1840, it had the largest slave market in North America. It became the wealthiest and the fourth-largest city in the nation, based chiefly on the slave trade and associated businesses.<ref>Walter Johnson, ''Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave Market'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1999.</ref> The trading season was from September to May, after the harvest.<ref>Johnson (1999), ''Soul by Soul'', p. 2.</ref>\n\nSlave traders were men of low reputation, even in the South.

The power relationships of slavery corrupted many whites who had authority over slaves, with children showing their own cruelty. Masters and overseers resorted to physical punishments to impose their wills. Slaves were punished by whipping, shackling, hanging, beating, burning, mutilation, branding and imprisonment. Punishment was most often meted out in response to disobedience or perceived infractions, but sometimes abuse was carried out to re-assert the dominance of the master or overseer of the slave.<ref>Moore, p. 114.</ref> Treatment was usually harsher on large plantations, which were often managed by overseers and owned by absentee slaveholders, conditions permitting abuses.\n\n[[William Wells Brown]], who escaped to freedom, reported that on one plantation, slave men were required to pick 80 pounds per day of cotton, while women were required to pick 70 pounds; if any slave failed in his or her quota, they were subject to whip lashes for each pound they were short. The whipping post stood next to the cotton scales.<ref>Clinton, Catherine, ''Scholastic Encyclopedia of the Civil War'', New York: Scholastic Inc., 1999, p. 8.</ref> A New York man who attended a slave auction in the mid-19th century reported that at least three-quarters of the male slaves he saw at sale had scars on their backs from whipping.<ref name=\"McInnis2011\">{{cite book|author=Maurie D.

Slaveholders published articles in southern agricultural journals to share best practices in treatment and management of slaves; they intended to show that their system was better than the living conditions of northern industrial workers.\n\nMedical care for slaves was limited in terms of the medical knowledge available to anyone. It was generally provided by other slaves or by slaveholders' family members, although sometimes \"plantation physicians\", like [[J. Marion Sims]], were called by the owners to protect their investment by treating sick slaves.

This was a common requirement in other states as well, and locally run patrols (known to slaves as ''pater rollers'') often checked the passes of slaves who appeared to be away from their plantations. In Alabama slaves were prohibited from trading goods among themselves. In Virginia, a slave was not permitted to drink in public within one mile of his master or during public gatherings.

Following [[Nat Turner]]'s rebellion in 1831, which raised white fears throughout the South, some states also prohibited or restricted religious gatherings of slaves, or required that they be officiated by white men.

They listened to white preachers, who emphasized the obligation of slaves to keep in their place, and acknowledged the slave's identity as both person and property.<ref name=\"J.

Fogel's 1989 work, ''Without Consent or Contract: The Rise and Fall of American Slavery'', elaborated on the moral indictment of slavery which ultimately led to its abolition.\n\n===Efficiency of slaves===\n[[File:RebeccaAugustRosaSlaveChildren.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Mixed-race slave girls of predominant European ancestry, New Orleans, 1863. (See also [[white slave propaganda]]).]]\nScholars disagree on how to quantify efficiency of slavery. In ''Time on the Cross'', Fogel and Engerman equate efficiency to [[total factor productivity]] (TFP)\u2014the output per average unit of input on a farm. Using this measurement, Southern farms that enslaved black people using the [[gang system]] were 35% more efficient than Northern farms which used free labor. Under the gang system, groups of slaves perform synchronized tasks under the constant vigilance of an overseer. Each group was like a part of a machine. If perceived to be working below his capacity, a slave could be punished. Fogel argues that this kind of negative enforcement was not frequent and that slaves and free laborers had similar quality of life; however, there is controversy on this last point.<ref name=\"Fogel and Engeman\">{{cite book|last=Fogel & Engerman|title=Time on the Cross: The Economics of American Negro Slavery|year=1974|publisher=W.W.

Economies of scale, effective management, and intensive utilization of labor and capital made southern slave agriculture considerably more efficient than nonslave southern farming.\" 48 percent of the economists agreed without provisos, while 24 percent agreed when provisos were included in the statement. On the other hand, 58 percent of economic historians and 42 percent of economists disagreed with Fogel and Engerman's \"proposition that the material (not psychological) conditions of the lives of slaves compared favorably with those of free industrial workers in the decades before the Civil War\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Whaples|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Whaples|journal=[[The Journal of Economic History]]|volume=55|issue=1|pages=141, 146\u2013147|jstor=2123771|title=Where Is There Consensus Among American Economic Historians?

Although the prices of slaves relative to indentured servants declined, both got more expensive. Cotton production was rising and relied on the use of slaves to yield high profits. Fogel and Engeman initially argued that if the Civil War had not happened, the slave prices would have increased even more, an average of more than 50 percent by 1890.<ref name=\"Fogel and Engeman\" />{{rp|96}}\n[[File:Slavery19.jpg|thumb|left|A slave auction, 1853]]\nPrices reflected the characteristics of the slave\u2014such factors as sex, age, nature, and height were all taken into account to determine the price of a slave. Over the life-cycle, the price of enslaved women was higher than their male counterparts up to puberty age, as they would likely bear children and produce more slaves, in addition to serving as laborers. Men around the age of 25 were the most valued, as they were at the highest level of productivity and still had a considerable life-span. If slaves had a history of fights or escapes, their price was lowered reflecting what planters believed was risk of repeating such behavior. Slave traders and buyers would examine a slave's back for whipping scars\u2014a large number of injuries would be seen as evidence of laziness or rebelliousness, rather than the previous master's brutality, and would lower the slave's price.<ref name=\"McInnis2011\" /> Taller male slaves were priced at a higher level, as height was viewed as a proxy for fitness and productivity.<ref name=\"Fogel and Engeman\" />\n\nThe conditions of the market led to shocks in the supply and demand of slaves, which in turn changed prices. For example, slaves became more expensive after 1808, when no more could be imported. The market for the products of their work also affected slaves' economic value: demand for slaves fell with the price of cotton in 1840. Anticipation of changes also had a huge influence on prices. As the Civil War progressed, there was great doubt that slavery would continue to be legal, and prime males in New Orleans were sold at $1,116 by 1862 as opposed to $1,381 in 1861.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kotlikoff|first=L.

She is also drawing attention to black women's labor being needed to maintain the aristocracy of a white ruling class, due to the intimate nature of reproduction and its potential for producing more enslaved peoples.\n\nDue to the institution of ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]'', black women's wombs became the site where slavery was developed and transferred,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sister Circle: Black Women and Work|last=Davis|first=Adrienne|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0813530611|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sistercircle00rutg/page/108 108]|chapter=\"Don't Let Nobody Bother Yo' Principle\" Sexual Economy of American Slavery|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/sistercircle00rutg/page/108}}</ref> meaning that black women were not only used for their physical labor, but for their sexual and reproductive labor as well.\n\n<blockquote>\"The rule that the children\u2019s status follows their mothers\u2019 was a foundational one for our economy.

Davis writes how black women performed labor under slavery, writing: \u201c[black women were] male when convenient and horrifically female when needed\u201d<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|title=Sister Circle: Black Women and Work|last=Davis|first=Adrienne|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0813530611|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sistercircle00rutg/page/119 119]|chapter=\"Don't Let Nobody Bother Yo' Principle\" The Sexual Economy of American Slavery|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/sistercircle00rutg/page/119}}</ref> The fluctuating expectations of black women's gendered labor under slavery disrupted the white normative roles that were assigned to white men and white women. This ungendering black women received under slavery contributed to the systemic dehumanization experienced by enslaved black women, as they were unable to receive the expectations or experiences of either gender within the white binary.\n\nDavis\u2019 arguments addresses the fact that under slavery, black women's sexuality became linked to the economic and public sphere, making their intimate lives into public institutions. Black women's physical labor was gendered as masculine under slavery when they were needed to yield more profit, but their reproductive capacities and sexual labor was equally as important in maintaining white power over black communities and perpetuating an enslaved workforce.<ref name=\":02\" /> This blurring of the line between the private and public sphere is another way Davis articulates how black women's sexuality and reproduction was commodified and exploited for capitalist gain, as their private and intimate lives became disrupted by the violence at the hands of white men, and their sexual capacities became an important part of the public marketplace and United States economy.\n\n==1850s==\n\n[[File:Eastman Johnson - A Ride for Liberty -- The Fugitive Slaves - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eastman Johnson]] (American, 1824\u20131906).

[[Daguerreotype]] of elderly [[North Carolina]] [[slave]], circa 1850.]]\nIn 1850, Congress passed the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]], which required law enforcement and citizens of free states to cooperate in the capture and return of slaves. This met with considerable overt and covert resistance in free states and cities such as Philadelphia, New York, and Boston. Refugees from slavery continued to flee the South across the [[Ohio River]] and other parts of the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]] dividing North from South, to the North and Canada via the [[Underground Railroad]]. Some white northerners helped hide former slaves from their former owners or helped them reach freedom in Canada.<ref>Larry Gara, '' The Liberty Line: The Legend of the Underground Railroad'' (University Press of Kentucky, 2013).</ref>\n\nAs part of the [[Compromise of 1850]], Congress abolished the slave trade (though not the ownership of slaves) in the [[District of Columbia]]; fearing this would happen, [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], regional slave trading center and port, successfully sought [[District of Columbia retrocession|its removal from the District of Columbia and devolution to Virginia]].  After 1854, [[History of the United States  Republican Party|Republicans]] argued that the \"[[Slave Power]]\", especially the pro-slavery [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party in the South]], controlled two of the three branches of the Federal government.<ref>Leonard L.  Richards, ''The Slave Power: The Free North and Southern Domination, 1780\u20141860'' (LSU Press, 2000).</ref>\n\nThe abolitionists, realizing that the total elimination of slavery was as an immediate goal unrealistic, worked to prevent expansion of slavery into the western territories which eventually would be new states. The [[Missouri Compromise]], the [[Compromise of 1850]], and the [[Bleeding Kansas]] crisis dealt with whether new states would be slave or free, or how that was to be decided. Both sides were anxious about effects of these decisions on the balance of power in the [[U.S. Senate|Senate]].\n\n{{Main|Bleeding Kansas}}\nAfter the passage of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] in 1854, border fighting broke out in [[Kansas Territory]], where the question of whether it would be admitted to the Union as a [[slave state|slave]] or [[free state (USA)|free state]] was [[Popular Sovereignty|left to the inhabitants]]. Migrants from free and slave states moved into the territory to prepare for the vote on slavery. Abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] was active in the fighting in \"Bleeding Kansas,\" but so too were many white Southerners who opposed abolition.\n\nAbraham Lincoln's and the Republicans' political platform in 1860 was to stop slavery's expansion. Historian James McPherson says that in a famous speech in 1858, Lincoln said American republicanism can be purified by restricting the further expansion of slavery as the first step to putting it on the road to 'ultimate extinction.' Southerners took Lincoln at his word. When he won the presidency they left the Union to escape the 'ultimate extinction' of slavery.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=James M.

Sandford|Freedom suits}}\nWith the development of slave and free states after the American Revolution, and far-flung commercial and military activities, new situations arose in which slaves might be taken by masters into free states. Most free states not only prohibited slavery, but ruled that slaves brought and kept there illegally could be freed. Such cases were sometimes known as transit cases.<ref>Paul Finkelman, '' Dred Scott v. Sandford: a brief history with documents'' (Bedford Books, 1997). </ref>  [[Dred Scott]] and his wife Harriet Scott each [[freedom suit|sued for freedom]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] after the death of their master, based on their having been held in a free territory (the northern part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]] from which slavery was excluded under the terms of the [[Missouri Compromise]]). (Later the two cases were combined under Dred Scott's name.) Scott filed suit for freedom in 1846 and went through two state trials, the first denying and the second granting freedom to the couple (and, by extension, their two daughters, who had also been held illegally in free territories). For 28 years, Missouri state precedent had generally respected laws of neighboring free states and territories, ruling for freedom in such transit cases where slaves had been held illegally in free territory. But in the Dred Scott case, the State Supreme Court ruled against the slaves.<ref>{{cite book |first=Don E. |last=Fehrenbacher |authorlink=Don E.

Taney]], in a sweeping decision, denied Scott his freedom. The 1857 [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|decision]], decided 7\u20132, held that a slave did not become free when taken into a free state; Congress could not bar slavery from a territory; and people of African descent imported into the United States and held as slaves, or their descendants, could never be citizens and thus had no status to bring suit in a U.S. court. A state could not bar slaveowners from bringing slaves into that state. Many Republicans, including [[Abraham Lincoln]], considered the decision unjust and evidence that the [[Slave Power]] had seized control of the Supreme Court. Anti-slavery groups were enraged and slave owners encouraged, escalating the tensions that led to civil war.<ref>Fehrenbacher, ''The Dred Scott case: Its significance in American law and politics'' (2001).</ref>\n\n==Civil War and emancipation==\n{{Events leading to US Civil War}}\n\n===1860 presidential election===\n\nThe divisions became fully exposed with the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]]. The electorate split four ways. The Southern Democrats endorsed slavery, while the Republicans denounced it. The Northern Democrats said democracy required the people to decide on slavery locally, state by state and territory by territory. The [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]] said the survival of the Union was at stake and everything else should be compromised.<ref>David M. Potter, ''The Impending Crisis: America Before the Civil War, 1848\u20131861'' (Harper & Row\n, 1976).</ref>\n\nLincoln, the Republican, won with a plurality of popular votes and a majority of [[United States Electoral College|electoral votes]]. Lincoln, however, did not appear on the ballots of ten southern slave states. Many slave owners in the South feared that the real intent of the Republicans was the abolition of slavery in states where it already existed, and that the sudden emancipation of four million slaves would be disastrous for the slave owners and for the economy that drew its greatest profits from the labor of people who were not paid. The slave owners feared that ending the balance could lead to the domination of the federal government by the northern free states. This led seven southern states to [[Ordinance of Secession|secede from the Union]]. When the southern forces attacked a US Army installation at Fort Sumter, the [[American Civil War]] began and four additional slave states seceded. Northern leaders had viewed the slavery interests as a threat politically, but with secession, they viewed the prospect of a new Southern nation, the [[Confederate States of America]], with control over the [[Mississippi River]] and parts of the [[Western United States|West]], as politically unacceptable.  Most of all they could not accept this repudiation of American nationalism.<ref>Potter, pp 448\u2013554. </ref>\n\n===Civil War===\nThe consequent [[American Civil War]], beginning in 1861, led to the end of chattel slavery in America. Not long after the war broke out, through a legal maneuver credited to Union General [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin F. Butler]], a lawyer by profession, slaves who came into Union \"possession\" were considered [[contraband (American Civil War)|\"contraband of war\"]]. General Butler ruled that they were not subject to return to Confederate owners as they had been before the war. Soon word spread, and many slaves sought refuge in Union territory, desiring to be declared \"contraband\". Many of the \"contrabands\" joined the [[Union Army]] as workers or troops, forming entire regiments of the [[United States Colored Troops|U.S. Colored Troops]]. Others went to refugee camps such as the [[Grand Contraband Camp]] near [[Fort Monroe]] or fled to northern cities. General Butler's interpretation was reinforced when Congress passed the [[Confiscation Act of 1861]], which declared that any property used by the Confederate military, including slaves, could be confiscated by Union forces.\n\n[[File:Timothy H. O'Sullivan (American - Slaves, J. J. Smith's Plantation, South Carolina - Google Art Project.jpg|left|thumb|Slaves on J. J. Smith's cotton plantation near [[Beaufort, South Carolina]], photographed by [[Timothy H. O'Sullivan|Timothy O'Sullivan]] standing before their quarters in 1862]]\nAt the beginning of the war, some Union commanders thought they were supposed to return escaped slaves to their masters. By 1862, when it became clear that this would be a long war, the question of what to do about slavery became more general. The Southern economy and military effort depended on slave labor. It began to seem unreasonable to protect slavery while blockading Southern commerce and destroying Southern production. As Congressman [[George Washington Julian|George W. Julian]] of Indiana put it in an 1862 speech in Congress, the slaves \"cannot be neutral. As laborers, if not as soldiers, they will be allies of the rebels, or of the Union.\"<ref>[[James M. McPherson|McPherson]], ''[[Battle Cry of Freedom (book)|Battle Cry of Freedom]]'', p. 495.</ref> Julian and his fellow Radical Republicans put pressure on Lincoln to rapidly emancipate the slaves, whereas moderate Republicans came to accept gradual, compensated emancipation and colonization.<ref>McPherson, ''Battle Cry'', pp. 355, 494\u20136, quote from [[George Washington Julian|George Julian]] on 495.</ref> [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]], the [[Border states (Civil War)|border states]] and [[War Democrats]] opposed emancipation, although the border states and War Democrats eventually accepted it as part of [[total war]] needed to save the Union.\n\n===Emancipation Proclamation===\n{{Main|Emancipation Proclamation}}\n\nThe Emancipation Proclamation was an executive order issued by President Lincoln on January 1, 1863. In a single stroke it changed the legal status, as recognized by the U.S. government, of 3 million slaves in designated areas of the Confederacy from \"slave\" to \"free\". It had the practical effect that as soon as a slave escaped the control of the Confederate government, by running away or through advances of federal troops, the slave became legally and actually free. Plantation owners, realizing that emancipation would destroy their economic system, sometimes moved their slaves as far as possible out of reach of the Union army. By June 1865, the Union Army controlled all of the Confederacy and had liberated all of the designated slaves.<ref>{{cite book |first=Leon F. |last=Litwack |authorlink=Leon Litwack |title=Been in the Storm So Long: The Aftermath of Slavery |location=New York |publisher=Knopf |year=1979 |isbn=978-0-394-50099-7 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bi2aAAAAIAAJ }}</ref>\n\nIn 1861, Lincoln expressed the fear that premature attempts at emancipation would mean the loss of the border states. He believed that \"to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game.\"<ref>Lincoln's letter to O. H. Browning, September 22, 1861.</ref> At first, Lincoln reversed attempts at emancipation by Secretary of War [[Simon Cameron]] and Generals [[John C.

Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] told Lincoln to wait for a victory before issuing the proclamation, as to do otherwise would seem like \"our last shriek on the retreat\".<ref>[[Stephen B. Oates]], ''Abraham Lincoln: The Man Behind the Myths'', page 106.</ref> In September 1862 the [[Battle of Antietam]] provided this opportunity, and the subsequent [[War Governors' Conference]] added support for the proclamation.<ref>''Images of America: Altoona'', by Sr. Anne Francis Pulling, 2001, 10.</ref> Lincoln had already published a letter<ref>Letter to Greeley, August 22, 1862.</ref> encouraging the border states especially to accept emancipation as necessary to save the Union. Lincoln later said that slavery was \"somehow the cause of the war\".<ref name=\"Second Inaugural\">Abraham Lincoln, Second Inaugural Address, March 4, 1865.</ref>\n\nLincoln issued his preliminary [[Emancipation Proclamation]] on September 22, 1862, and said that a final proclamation would be issued if his gradual plan, based on compensated emancipation and voluntary colonization, was rejected.<!-- by whom? Negotiations with the South?--> Only the District of Columbia accepted Lincoln's gradual plan, and Lincoln issued his final Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. In his letter to Hodges, Lincoln explained his belief that\n\n{{quote|If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong \u2026 And yet I have never understood that the Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling \u2026 I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me.<ref>Lincoln's Letter to A. G. Hodges, April 4, 1864.</ref>}}\n\nLincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863 was a powerful action that promised freedom for slaves in the Confederacy as soon as the Union armies reached them, and authorized the enlistment of African Americans in the Union Army. The Emancipation Proclamation did not free slaves in the Union-allied slave-holding states that bordered the Confederacy. Since the Confederate States did not recognize the authority of President Lincoln, and the proclamation did not apply in the [[border states (Civil War)|border states]], at first the proclamation freed only those slaves who had escaped behind Union lines. The proclamation made the abolition of slavery an official war goal that was implemented as the Union took territory from the Confederacy. According to the Census of 1860, this policy would free nearly four million slaves, or over 12% of the total population of the United States.\n\nBased on the President's war powers, the Emancipation Proclamation applied to territory held by Confederates at the time. However, the Proclamation became a symbol of the Union's growing commitment to add emancipation to the Union's definition of liberty.<ref>James McPherson, ''The War that Never Goes Away''.</ref> Lincoln played a leading role in getting the constitutionally-required two-thirds majority of both houses of Congress to vote for the Thirteenth Amendment,<ref name=\"Who Freed\">James McPherson, \"Drawn With the Sword\", from the article \"Who Freed the Slaves?\"</ref> which made emancipation universal and permanent.\n[[File:Family of African American slaves on Smith's Plantation Beaufort South Carolina.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.95|Four [[generation]]s of a [[slave]] family, Smith's Plantation, [[Beaufort, South Carolina]], 1862]]\nEnslaved African Americans had not waited for Lincoln before escaping and seeking freedom behind Union lines. From early years of the war, hundreds of thousands of African Americans escaped to Union lines, especially in Union-controlled areas such as [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] and the [[Hampton Roads]] region in 1862 Virginia, Tennessee from 1862 on, the line of Sherman's march, etc. So many African Americans fled to Union lines that commanders created camps and schools for them, where both adults and children learned to read and write. The [[American Missionary Association]] entered the war effort by sending teachers south to such contraband camps, for instance, establishing schools in Norfolk and on nearby plantations.\n\nIn addition, nearly 200,000 African-American men served with distinction in the Union forces as soldiers and sailors. Most were escaped slaves. The Confederacy was outraged by armed black soldiers and refused to treat them as [[prisoners of war]]. They murdered many, as at the [[Fort Pillow Massacre]], and re-enslaved others.<ref>{{cite book|last=Doyle |first=Robert C.

Thousands of slaves were freed by the operation of the Emancipation Proclamation as Union armies marched across the South. Emancipation came to the remaining southern slaves after the surrender of all Confederate troops in spring 1865.\n\nIn spite of the South's shortage of manpower, until 1865, most Southern leaders opposed arming slaves as soldiers. However, a few Confederates discussed arming slaves. Finally in early 1865 General Robert E. Lee said black soldiers were essential, and legislation was passed.

Blackmon]] reported in his [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning book ''[[Slavery By Another Name]]'' that many blacks were virtually enslaved under [[convict leasing]] programs, which started after the Civil War. Most Southern states had no prisons; they leased convicts to businesses and farms for their labor, and the lessee paid for food and board. The incentives for abuse were satisfied.\n\nThe continued involuntary servitude took various forms, but the primary forms included [[Convict lease|convict leasing]], [[peon]]age, and [[sharecropping]], with the latter eventually encompassing poor whites as well. By the 1930s, whites constituted most of the sharecroppers in the South. Mechanization of agriculture had reduced the need for farm labor, and many blacks left the South in the Great Migration. Jurisdictions and states created fines and sentences for a wide variety of minor crimes, and used these as an excuse to arrest and sentence blacks. Under convict leasing programs, African American men, often guilty of no crime at all, were arrested, compelled to work without pay, repeatedly bought and sold, and coerced to do the bidding of the leaseholder. Sharecropping, as it was practiced during this period, often involved severe restrictions on the freedom of movement of sharecroppers, who could be whipped for leaving the plantation. Both sharecropping and convict leasing were legal and tolerated by both the north and south. However, peonage was an illicit form of forced labor. Its existence was ignored by authorities while thousands of African Americans and poor Anglo Americans were subjugated and held in bondage until the mid 1960s to the late 1970s. With the exception of cases of peonage, beyond the period of Reconstruction, the federal government took almost no action to enforce the 13th Amendment until December 1941 when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt summoned his attorney general. Five days after Pearl Harbor, at the request of the president Attorney General Francis Biddle issued [[s:Circular No. 3591|Circular No. 3591]] to all federal prosecutors, instructing them to actively investigate and try any case of involuntary servitude or slavery. Several months later, convict leasing was officially abolished. But aspects have persisted in other forms, while historians argue that other systems of penal labor, were all created in 1865 and convict leasing was simply the most oppressive form.  Over time a large [[Civil rights movement (1896\u20131954)|civil rights movement]] arose to bring full civil rights and equality under the law to all Americans.\n<ref>Thomas C. Holt, ed.

PTSS is an intercultural phenomenon that shows up across those communities due to the social construction of race and the \u201cother\u201d in conjunction to the creation of racial hierarchy. Quite often these behaviors are seen as \u201ccultural\u201d, because they have been socialized as \u201cnormal\u201d within the groups. On a social scale, African American communities can reflect interdependent orientation: where identity is relational to the white majority group,and conflict has to be managed in relationship to that majority. On an inter-cultural/personal scale, African American communities can reflect independent orientation: where individual initiation and socialization are used to assert personal opinions and hold individuals accountable for their mistakes.

The system of [[convict lease|convict leasing]] began during Reconstruction and was fully implemented in the 1880s and officially ending in the last state, Alabama, in 1928. It persisted in various forms until it was abolished in 1942 by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] during [[World War II]], several months after the attack on [[Pearl Harbor]] involved the U.S. in the conflict. This system allowed private contractors to purchase the services of convicts from the state or local governments for a specific time period.

The problem of illiteracy and need for education was seen as one of the greatest challenges confronting these people as they sought to join the [[free enterprise system]] and support themselves during Reconstruction and thereafter.\n\nConsequently, many black and white religious organizations, former Union Army officers and soldiers, and wealthy philanthropists were inspired to create and fund educational efforts specifically for the betterment of African Americans; some African Americans had started their own schools before the end of the war. Northerners helped create numerous [[normal school]]s, such as those that became [[Hampton University]] and [[Tuskegee University]], to generate teachers, as well as other [[Historically black colleges and universities|colleges for former slaves]]. Blacks held teaching as a high calling, with education the first priority for children and adults. Many of the most talented went into the field. Some of the schools took years to reach a high standard, but they managed to get thousands of teachers started. As [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] noted, the black colleges were not perfect, but \"in a single generation they put thirty thousand black teachers in the South\" and \"wiped out the illiteracy of the majority of black people in the land\".<ref>{{cite book |first=James D. |last=Anderson |title=The Education of Blacks in the South, 1860\u20131935 |location=Chapel Hill, NC |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |year=1988 |pages=244\u201345 |isbn=978-0-8078-1793-3 |title-link=The Education of Blacks in the South, 1860\u20131935 }}</ref>\n\nNorthern philanthropists continued to support black education in the 20th century, even as tensions rose within the black community, exemplified by [[Booker T.

He insisted on white and black cooperation in the effort, wanting to ensure that white-controlled school boards made a commitment to maintain the schools. By the 1930s local parents had helped raise funds (sometimes donating labor and land) to create over 5,000 rural schools in the South. Other philanthropists, such as [[Henry H.

By counting only named slaveholders, this approach does not acknowledge people who benefited from slavery by being in a slaveowning household, e.g. the wife and children of an owner; in 1850, there was an average of 5.55 people per household,<ref>[https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/10/01/the-number-of-people-in-the-average-u-s-household-is-going-up-for-the-first-time-in-over-160-years/ Pew Research Center: The number of people in the average U.S. household is going up for the first time in over 160 years]</ref> so on average, around 8.05% of free persons lived in a slaveowning household.

This was in part due to the circumstance that most slaveholders were literate and left behind written records, whereas slaves were largely illiterate and not in a position to leave written records. Scholars differed as to whether slavery should be considered a benign or a \"harshly exploitive\" institution.<ref name=\"Kolchin p. 134\">Kolchin p. 134.</ref>\n\nMuch of the history written prior to the 1950s had a distinctive racist slant to it.<ref name=\"Kolchin p. 134\" /> By the 1970s and 1980s, historians were using [[archaeological]] records, black [[folklore]], and statistical data to develop a much more detailed and nuanced picture of slave life. Individuals were shown to have been resilient and somewhat autonomous in many of their activities, within the limits of their situation and despite its precariousness. Historians who wrote in this era include [[John Blassingame]] (''[[Slave Community]]''), [[Eugene Genovese]] (''Roll, Jordan, Roll''), Leslie Howard Owens (''This Species of Property''), and [[Herbert Gutman]] (''The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom'').<ref>Kolchin pp. 137\u201343.
