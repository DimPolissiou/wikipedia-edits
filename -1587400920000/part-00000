Both events last for 7 days. In addition to these events, GDQ hosts several other broadcasts throughout the year including smaller marathons supporting different charities, one-off events for special occasions, and regular GDQ Hotfix programming throughout the year.\n\nThe events are broadcast live on [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]]. Viewers are encouraged to donate for incentives during the stream such as selecting the file name or main character's name in a run, having the runners attempt more difficult challenges, and entering raffles for the chance of winning prizes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://associationsnow.com/2015/01/gaming-gurus-reinvented-telethons-web/|publisher=Association Now|title=How Gaming Gurus Reinvented Telethons for the Web|last=Smith|first=Ernie|date=January 13, 2015}}</ref> Over $25.7 million has been raised across 25 marathons.<ref name=\"Total\">{{cite web|url=https://gamesdonequick.com/tracker/|title=All Events \u2013 Donation total: $25,742,182.26|last=|first=|date=30 June 2020|website=|publisher=Games Done Quick, LLC|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=27 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\nSpeedrunners take turns demonstrating their prowess at beating various video games in the quickest possible time, done in front of an audience as well as a [[Live streaming|livestream]] through [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://kotaku.com/watch-the-first-day-of-the-weeklong-awesome-games-done-1790948260|title=Watch The Final Days Of The Weeklong Awesome Games Done Quick Charity Marathon|last=Gach|first=Ethan|newspaper=Kotaku|language=en-US|access-date=January 14, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/01/prepare-your-switch-tab-shortcut-at-work-awesome-games-done-quick-is-back/|title=Awesome Games Done Quick is indeed awesome, will ruin productivity all week|newspaper=Ars Technica|access-date=January 14, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/01/09/awesome-games-done-quick-2017-started/|title=Awesome Games Done Quick speedruns another week|last=O'Connor|first=Alice|date=January 9, 2017|website=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|language=en-US|access-date=January 14, 2017}}</ref> Sometimes these runs may be executed in an unusual or specific way, such as fully completing every level, completing a game blindfolded,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/7/5/12098530/speedrunner-castlevania-symphony-of-the-night-romscout-blindfolded-games-done-quick|title=Watch a speedrunner complete Castlevania: Symphony of the Night blindfolded|last=Biery|first=Thomas|date=July 5, 2016|website=Polygon|access-date=January 14, 2017}}</ref> or featuring multiple runners racing against one another to complete a game first.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/13/11-amazing-speedruns-from-awesome-games-done-quick-2016|title=11 Amazing Speedruns from Awesome Games Done Quick 2016|last=Otero|first=Jose|date=January 12, 2016|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=January 14, 2017}}</ref> Video games run in Games Done Quick events include both [[retrogaming|retro]] and modern titles.

Both events last for 7 days. In addition to these events, GDQ hosts several other broadcasts throughout the year including smaller marathons supporting different charities, one-off events for special occasions, and regular GDQ Hotfix programming throughout the year.\n\nThe events are broadcast live on [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]].

However, when these had done so and returned to Israel the king had already died. As such, the Djinn settled in the mountains, married the women themselves, and their offspring came to be known as the Kurds.<ref>Kahn, M. (1980).

Unknowingly to Zahak, the cooks of the palace saved one of the men, and mixed the brains of the other with those of a sheep. The men that were saved were told to flee to the mountains. Hereafter, [[Kaveh the Blacksmith]], who had already lost several of his children to Zahak, trained the men in the mountains, and stormed Zahak's palace, severing the heads of the snakes and killing the tyrannical king. Kaveh was instilled as the new king, and his followers formed the beginning of the Kurdish people.<ref>Masudi. ''Les Prairies d\u2019Or''. Trans. Barbier de Meynard and Pavet de Courteille, 9 vols.

He states to have learned of this legend from a certain ''Mighdis\u00ee'', an Armenian historian:\n\n{{quote|According to the chronicler Mighdis\u00ee, the first town to be built after Noah's Flood was the town of Judi, followed by the fortresses of Sinjar and Mifariqin. The town of Judi was ruled by Melik K\u00fcrdim of the Prophet Noah's community, a man who lived no less than 600 years and who travelled the length and width of Kurdistan. Coming to Mifariqin he liked its climate and settled there, begetting many children and descendants. He invented a language of his own, independent of Hebrew. It is neither Hebrew nor Arabic, [[Persian language|Persian]], Dari or Pahlavi; they still call it the language of K\u00fcrdim. So the Kurdish language, which was invented in Mifariqin and is now used throughout Kurdistan, owes its name to Melik K\u00fcrdim of the community of the Prophet Noah. Because Kurdistan is an endless stony stretch of mountains, there are no less than twelve varieties of Kurdish, differing from one another in pronunciation and vocabulary, so that they often have to use interpreters to understand one another's words.<ref>Van Bruinessen, M.

He states to have learned of this legend from a certain ''Mighdis\u00ee'', an Armenian historian:\n\n{{quote|According to the chronicler Mighdis\u00ee, the first town to be built after Noah's Flood was the town of Judi, followed by the fortresses of Sinjar and Mifariqin. The town of Judi was ruled by Melik K\u00fcrdim of the Prophet Noah's community, a man who lived no less than 600 years and who travelled the length and width of Kurdistan. Coming to Mifariqin he liked its climate and settled there, begetting many children and descendants. He invented a language of his own, independent of Hebrew. It is neither Hebrew nor Arabic, [[Persian language|Persian]], Dari or Pahlavi; they still call it the language of K\u00fcrdim. So the Kurdish language, which was invented in Mifariqin and is now used throughout Kurdistan, owes its name to Melik K\u00fcrdim of the community of the Prophet Noah. Because Kurdistan is an endless stony stretch of mountains, there are no less than twelve varieties of Kurdish, differing from one another in pronunciation and vocabulary, so that they often have to use interpreters to understand one another's words.<ref>Van Bruinessen, M.

It ranged from [[Maine]] and [[southern Ontario]] to [[Mississippi]], and from the [[Atlantic]] coast to the [[Appalachian Mountains]] and the [[Ohio Valley]]. ''C. dentata'' was once one of the most common trees in the [[Northeastern United States]]. In [[Pennsylvania]] alone, it is estimated to have comprised 25\u201330% of all hardwoods. The tree's huge population was due to a combination of rapid growth and a large annual seed crop in comparison to oaks which do not reliably produce sizable numbers of acorns every year. Nut production begins when ''C. dentata'' is 7\u20138 years old.\n\nThere are several similar [[chestnut]] species, such as the European [[sweet chestnut]], [[Castanea mollissima|Chinese chestnut]], and [[Japanese chestnut]]. The American species can be distinguished by a few morphological traits, such as [[Glossary of leaf morphology|leaf shape]], [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] length and nut size. For example, it has larger and more widely spaced saw-teeth on the edges of its leaves, as indicated by the scientific name ''dentata'', Latin for \"toothed\". According to a 1999 study by American Society for Horticultural Science, the [[Castanea ozarkensis|Ozark chinkapin]], which is typically considered either a distinct species (''C. ozarkensis'') or a subspecies of the [[Castanea pumila|Allegheny chinkapin]] (''C. pumila ozarkensis'') may be ancestral to both the American chestnut and the Allegheny chinkapin.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Hongwen|last2=Hawkins|first2=Leigh K.|last3=Dane|first3=Fenny|date=1999-11-01|title=Genetic Variation and Population Structure of Castanea pumila var. ozarkensis|journal=Journal of the American Society for Horticultural Science|language=en-US|volume=124|issue=6|pages=666\u2013670|doi=10.21273/JASHS.124.6.666|issn=2327-9788|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/06/saving-chestnut-trees-ozarks/|title=A legendary Ozark chestnut tree, thought extinct, is rediscovered|date=2019-06-24|website=Environment|access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref>\n\nThe [[leaf|leaves]], which are {{convert|14|\u2013|20|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|7|\u2013|10|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} broad, also tend to average slightly shorter and broader than those of the sweet chestnut. The [[Plant disease resistance|blight-resistant]] Chinese chestnut is now the most commonly planted chestnut species in the US, while the European chestnut is the source of commercial nuts in recent decades. It can be distinguished from the American chestnut by its hairy twig tips which are in contrast to the hairless twigs of the American chestnut. The chestnuts are in the beech family along with [[beech]] and [[oak]], but are not closely related to the horse-chestnut, which is in the family [[Sapindaceae]].\n\nThe chestnut is [[Plant reproductive morphology#Variations|monoecious]], producing many small, pale green (nearly white) male flowers found tightly occurring along 6 to 8 inch long [[catkin]]s. The female parts are found near base of the catkins (near twig) and appear in late spring to early summer. Like all members of the family [[Fagaceae]], American chestnut is self-incompatible and requires two trees for pollination, which can be any member of the Castanea genus.\n\nThe American chestnut is a prolific bearer of [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], usually with three nuts enclosed in each spiny, green burr, and lined in tan velvet. The nuts develop through late summer, with the burrs opening and falling to the ground near the first fall frost.\n\nThe American chestnut was a very important tree for wildlife, providing much of the fall [[mast (botany)|mast]] for species such as [[white-tailed deer]] and [[wild turkey]] and, formerly, the [[passenger pigeon]]. [[American black bear|Black bears]] were also known to eat the nuts to fatten up for the winter. The American chestnut also contains more [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[potassium]] and [[magnesium]] in its leaves when compared to other trees that share its habitat. This means they return more nutrients to the soil which helps with the growth of other plants, animals, and [[microorganism]]s.<ref name=blight>Jabr, Ferris.

This disease was accidentally introduced into North America on imported Asiatic chestnut trees. [[Chestnut blight]] was first noticed on American chestnut trees in what was then the New York Zoological Park, now known as the [[Bronx Zoo]], in the borough of [[The Bronx]], [[New York City]], in 1904, by chief forester [[Hermann Merkel]].

A technique called [[backcrossing]] is being used by [[The American Chestnut Foundation]] in an attempt to restore the American chestnut to its original habitat.\n\n===Intercrossing surviving American chestnuts===\n[[File:Floyda.jpg|thumb|upright|Large surviving blight-resistant American chestnut in its natural range.

John Rush Elkins, a research chemist and [[professor emeritus]] of chemistry at [[Concord University]], and Gary Griffin, professor of plant pathology at [[Virginia Tech]], think there may be several different characteristics which favor blight resistance. Both Elkins and Griffin have written extensively about the American chestnut.<ref name=griffin>[http://www.accf-online.org/biblio.html \"Bibliography.\"] ''www.accf-online.org.'' Retrieved January 11, 2016.</ref>  They believe that by making intercrosses among resistant American chestnuts from many locations, they will continue to improve upon the levels of blight resistance to make an American chestnut that can compete in the forest. Griffin, who has been involved with American chestnut restoration for many years,<ref name=griffin/> developed a scale for assessing levels of blight resistance, which made it possible to make selections scientifically. He inoculated five-year-old chestnuts with a standard lethal strain of the blight fungus and measured growth of the cankers. Chestnuts with no resistance to blight make rapid-growing, sunken cankers that are deep and kill tissue right to the wood. Resistant chestnuts make slow-growing, swollen cankers that are superficial: live tissue can be recovered under these cankers. The level of blight resistance is judged by periodic measurement of cankers. Grafts from large survivors of the blight epidemic were evaluated following inoculations, and controlled crosses among resistant American chestnut trees were made beginning in 1980. The first \"All-American intercrosses\" were planted in Virginia Tech's Martin American Chestnut Planting in [[Giles County, Virginia]], and in [[Beckley, West Virginia]]. They were inoculated in 1990 and evaluated in 1991 and 1992. Nine of the trees showed resistance equal to their parents, and four of these had resistance comparable to hybrids in the same test.<ref name=griffin/><ref name=elkins>Griffin, G.J., J.R. Elkins, D.

It ranged from [[Maine]] and [[southern Ontario]] to [[Mississippi]], and from the [[Atlantic]] coast to the [[Appalachian Mountains]] and the [[Ohio Valley]]. ''C. dentata'' was once one of the most common trees in the [[Northeastern United States]]. In [[Pennsylvania]] alone, it is estimated to have comprised 25\u201330% of all hardwoods. The tree's huge population was due to a combination of rapid growth and a large annual seed crop in comparison to oaks which do not reliably produce sizable numbers of acorns every year. Nut production begins when ''C. dentata'' is 7\u20138 years old.\n\nThere are several similar [[chestnut]] species, such as the European [[sweet chestnut]], [[Castanea mollissima|Chinese chestnut]], and [[Japanese chestnut]]. The American species can be distinguished by a few morphological traits, such as [[Glossary of leaf morphology|leaf shape]], [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] length and nut size. For example, it has larger and more widely spaced saw-teeth on the edges of its leaves, as indicated by the scientific name ''dentata'', Latin for \"toothed\". According to a 1999 study by American Society for Horticultural Science, the [[Castanea ozarkensis|Ozark chinkapin]], which is typically considered either a distinct species (''C. ozarkensis'') or a subspecies of the [[Castanea pumila|Allegheny chinkapin]] (''C. pumila ozarkensis'') may be ancestral to both the American chestnut and the Allegheny chinkapin.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Hongwen|last2=Hawkins|first2=Leigh K.|last3=Dane|first3=Fenny|date=1999-11-01|title=Genetic Variation and Population Structure of Castanea pumila var. ozarkensis|journal=Journal of the American Society for Horticultural Science|language=en-US|volume=124|issue=6|pages=666\u2013670|doi=10.21273/JASHS.124.6.666|issn=2327-9788|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/06/saving-chestnut-trees-ozarks/|title=A legendary Ozark chestnut tree, thought extinct, is rediscovered|date=2019-06-24|website=Environment|access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref>\n\nThe [[leaf|leaves]], which are {{convert|14|\u2013|20|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|7|\u2013|10|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} broad, also tend to average slightly shorter and broader than those of the sweet chestnut. The [[Plant disease resistance|blight-resistant]] Chinese chestnut is now the most commonly planted chestnut species in the US, while the European chestnut is the source of commercial nuts in recent decades. It can be distinguished from the American chestnut by its hairy twig tips which are in contrast to the hairless twigs of the American chestnut. The chestnuts are in the beech family along with [[beech]] and [[oak]], but are not closely related to the horse-chestnut, which is in the family [[Sapindaceae]].\n\nThe chestnut is [[Plant reproductive morphology#Variations|monoecious]], producing many small, pale green (nearly white) male flowers found tightly occurring along 6 to 8 inch long [[catkin]]s. The female parts are found near base of the catkins (near twig) and appear in late spring to early summer. Like all members of the family [[Fagaceae]], American chestnut is self-incompatible and requires two trees for pollination, which can be any member of the Castanea genus.\n\nThe American chestnut is a prolific bearer of [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], usually with three nuts enclosed in each spiny, green burr, and lined in tan velvet. The nuts develop through late summer, with the burrs opening and falling to the ground near the first fall frost.\n\nThe American chestnut was a very important tree for wildlife, providing much of the fall [[mast (botany)|mast]] for species such as [[white-tailed deer]] and [[wild turkey]] and, formerly, the [[passenger pigeon]]. [[American black bear|Black bears]] were also known to eat the nuts to fatten up for the winter. The American chestnut also contains more [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[potassium]] and [[magnesium]] in its leaves when compared to other trees that share its habitat. This means they return more nutrients to the soil which helps with the growth of other plants, animals, and [[microorganism]]s.<ref name=blight>Jabr, Ferris.

John Rush Elkins, a research chemist and [[professor emeritus]] of chemistry at [[Concord University]], and Gary Griffin, professor of plant pathology at [[Virginia Tech]], think there may be several different characteristics which favor blight resistance. Both Elkins and Griffin have written extensively about the American chestnut.<ref name=griffin>[http://www.accf-online.org/biblio.html \"Bibliography.\"] ''www.accf-online.org.'' Retrieved January 11, 2016.</ref>  They believe that by making intercrosses among resistant American chestnuts from many locations, they will continue to improve upon the levels of blight resistance to make an American chestnut that can compete in the forest. Griffin, who has been involved with American chestnut restoration for many years,<ref name=griffin/> developed a scale for assessing levels of blight resistance, which made it possible to make selections scientifically. He inoculated five-year-old chestnuts with a standard lethal strain of the blight fungus and measured growth of the cankers. Chestnuts with no resistance to blight make rapid-growing, sunken cankers that are deep and kill tissue right to the wood. Resistant chestnuts make slow-growing, swollen cankers that are superficial: live tissue can be recovered under these cankers. The level of blight resistance is judged by periodic measurement of cankers. Grafts from large survivors of the blight epidemic were evaluated following inoculations, and controlled crosses among resistant American chestnut trees were made beginning in 1980. The first \"All-American intercrosses\" were planted in Virginia Tech's Martin American Chestnut Planting in [[Giles County, Virginia]], and in [[Beckley, West Virginia]]. They were inoculated in 1990 and evaluated in 1991 and 1992. Nine of the trees showed resistance equal to their parents, and four of these had resistance comparable to hybrids in the same test.<ref name=griffin/><ref name=elkins>Griffin, G.J., J.R. Elkins, D.
