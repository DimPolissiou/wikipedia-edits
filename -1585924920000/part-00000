{"title_page": "155 mm", "text_new": "{{onesource|date=February 2019}}\n'''155&nbsp;mm''' (6.1\u2033) is a common, [[NATO]]-standard, [[artillery]] [[calibre]].\n\n==Land warfare==\nSince the late 20th century, most NATO armies have adopted 155&nbsp;mm weapons as an all-purpose standard. They are seen as striking a good compromise between range and destructive power, while using only a single calibre simplifies logistics. This has led to the obsolescence of larger calibre weapons such as 175 mm (6.9\") and 203&nbsp;mm (8\"), although some militaries retain [[105 mm|105&nbsp;mm]] weapons for their portability. Russian guns and those of former [[Soviet]] bloc countries tend to use 152&nbsp;mm weapons in similar roles.\n\n==Naval warfare==\nSince the end of [[WWII]], 155 mm has not found any use among [[naval]] forces despite its ubiquity on land, with most NATO and aligned navies using 76&nbsp;mm (3\"), 100&nbsp;mm (3.9\"), 114&nbsp;mm (4.5\"), or 127&nbsp;mm (5\") guns on modern warships. At one point the British [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] [[CORDA (UK)#Fitting 155&nbsp;mm guns to warships|studied \"up-gunning\"]] the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[4.5 inch Mark 8 naval gun]]s to give increased firepower and a common calibre between the Royal Navy and the [[British Army]]. However, despite superficially appearing to be superior due to a comparison of round diameters, when firing conventional ammunition the smaller, 4.5\", naval gun is comparable to the standard 155&nbsp;mm gun-howitzer of the British Army. The standard shell from a 4.5\" naval gun has the same, if not better, range and carries twice the HE payload of a standard 155&nbsp;mm round{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}; only by using [[rocket-assisted projectile]]s (RAP) can most 155&nbsp;mm guns better the range of the 4.5\", doing so by sacrificing payload. This is because naval guns can be built much more strongly than land-based self-propelled gun-howitzers, and have much longer barrels in relation to calibre (for example the Mark 8 has a barrel length of 55 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibres]], while the standard [[AS-90]] self-propelled gun has a barrel length of 39 calibres). This allows naval guns to fire heavier shells in comparison to shell diameter and to use larger propellant charges in relation to shell weight leading to greater projectile velocities. In addition, even without active cooling, the heavier naval gun barrels allow for a superior sustained rate of fire compared to field guns, and this is exploited with an autoloading system with a capacity of several hundred rounds. The 155&nbsp;mm is superior to the 4.5\" in relation to [[cannon-launched guided projectile]]s (CLGP); because the 155&nbsp;mm round is fired at a lower velocity it is much easier for their internal electronic guidance systems to survive being fired.\n\nThe [[US Navy]]'s [[Advanced Gun System]] also uses a 155&nbsp;mm calibre, although it is not compatible with NATO-standard 155&nbsp;mm ammunition. However, since 2016 no ammunition is to be developed and thus the AGS is unusable.<ref name=LaGrone>{{cite web|url=https://news.usni.org/2018/01/11/no-new-round-planned-zumwalt-destroyer-gun-system-navy-monitoring-industry|title=No New Round Planned For Zumwalt Destroyer Gun System;

The game was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS X]] and [[Linux]] on October 1, 2015. The game is Wreden's follow-up to the critically praised ''[[The Stanley Parable]]'', his previous interactive storytelling title that was initially released in 2013.\n\nThe game is narrated by Wreden and takes the user through a number of incomplete and abstract game creations made by a developer named Coda. Wreden challenges the player to try to come to understand the type of person Coda is from exploring these spaces in a [[first-person perspective]]. Within the narrative, the player discovers that Wreden had tried to force meaning onto Coda's games, causing them to end their relationship. Wreden has stated the game is open to interpretation: some have seen the game as general commentary on the nature of the relationship between game developers and players, while others have taken it as an allegory to Wreden's own personal struggles with success resulting from ''The Stanley Parable''.\n\nThe game received polarized reviews. Many reviewers readily took to the narrative and the questions and ideas it raised on game development, while others felt the game forced some of Wreden's thoughts too hard and in a pretentious manner.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe gameplay in ''The Beginner's Guide'' is presented in a [[first-person perspective]] allowing the player to move about and explore the environment and interact with some elements of it as they progress along the work's [[interactive storytelling]]. The player hears details of the various scenes they explore via the game's narrator, Wreden himself, to describe what they see and make conclusions on the nature of the games' developer. Some areas include puzzle solving and [[conversation tree]]s, but there is no way for the player-character to die, or the player to make a mistake or lose the game.<ref name=\"gamespot review\"/> The narration helps the player get past certain parts of the game-spaces that were otherwise difficult or insuperable as designed, such as by providing a bridge to cross an invisible maze after the player discovers the difficulty. Once the player has completed a chapter, they can then return to any of them within the game, as well as disable the narration (and the help it provides) to explore the spaces on their own. The game has [[metafiction]]al elements.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/2016/01/metafiction-games/ | title = The Best New Videogames Are All About \u2026 Videogames | first = Jake | last = Muncy | date = January 18, 2016 | website = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | publisher = [[Cond\u00e9 Nast]] | accessdate = January 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:The beginners guide screenshot.png|thumb|In one of Coda's games, Wreden as the narrator, by removing the visibility of some walls, shows to the user the numerous inaccessible corridors that were programmed into this game.|alt=Various corridors, seen through a no-clip perspective, with blue fog flooding the scene.]]\n\nThe concept of the game is based on trying to understand the nature of a person based on exploring files and documents on their computer without any other notes or documentation or knowing this person in the first place. In the game, the player, aided by Wreden's narration, looks to understand that of a game developer named Coda whom Wreden had met at a [[game jam]] in 2009. Coda is considered enigmatic, having created numerous strange game ideas which he has subsequently deleted or stored away and forgotten. The player explores these games, most being [[exploration game]]s developed from 2008 to 2011<ref name=\"paste review\"/> that were only half-created, and is encouraged by Wreden's narration to try to imagine what Coda's personality would be like based on the abstract and unconventional game spaces and ideas.<ref name=\"eurogamer review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-10-01-the-beginners-guide-review|title=The Beginner's Guide review|work=[[Eurogamer]]|first=Jeffrey|last=Matulef|date=October 1, 2015|accessdate=October 1, 2015}}</ref> ''The Beginner's Guide'' is presented in generally chronological order of Coda's prototypes, showing the progression of Coda's work as the developer learned more.<ref name=\"gamespot review\"/>\n\nWreden's narration explains that he was inspired by many of Coda's game concepts, providing his own analysis on many of the themes he perceived to appear in Coda's games. However, Wreden had seen that many of the games are based on themes of prisons, isolation, and difficulty in communicating with others, and that eventually Coda's games took a darker tone and took much longer to produce, focusing even more strongly on dialogue that implied that game development was no longer a positive activity for Coda. Wreden felt concerned that Coda was feeling depressed and weighed down by game development, and took it upon himself to show some of Coda's game concepts to others to get feedback to help encourage Coda to develop more. However, this in turn led to Coda to draw into seclusion. At some point in 2011, Wreden believed Coda had stopped making games, until he was sent an email with a private link to a final game by Coda.\n\nThis game, its design in stark contrast to the others Coda had made, included puzzles that were nearly unsolvable and a door that could not be opened from within the game. Wreden found that when he was able to use various programming tools to bypass these, he ended up in a gallery with a message from Coda directed at him, asking him not to talk to him any more nor to showcase his games to others. The messages implied Coda felt that Wreden mistook the tone of his games as a sign of an emotional struggle and was missing the point of why he had engaged in game design, as well as accusing Wreden with modifying Coda's games to add more symbolism, and that Wreden's actions had betrayed Coda. As a result, Wreden felt terrible about what he had done, and thus reveals that the purpose of ''The Beginner's Guide'' was to try to reconnect to Coda by sharing his games with the public at large and to hope to apologize for his actions.<ref name=\"boing boing\">{{Cite web|url=https://boingboing.net/2015/10/02/the-beginners-guide-is-a-gam.html|title=The Beginner's Guide is a game that doesn't want to be written about|first=Laura|last=Hudson|date=October 2, 2015|accessdate=October 2, 2015|work=[[Boing Boing]]}}</ref>\n\nThe game concludes with an [[epilogue]] level with Wreden sparsely narrating about his dependence on [[social validation]], something he saw as the cause for showing Coda's games to other people.\n\n===Interpretations===\nWithin the game, Wreden states that ''The Beginner's Guide'' is open to interpretation and invites players to share their own theories with him, providing his email address near the start of the game.<ref name=\"kotaku review\">{{Cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/the-beginners-guide-tackles-the-fears-we-dont-talk-abou-1734268227|title=The Beginner's Guide Tackles The Fears We Don't Talk About|first=Patrick|last=Klepick|date=October 2, 2015|accessdate=October 2, 2015|work=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]}}</ref>\n\nOne common interpretation is that the game is a metaphor for Wreden's own success and attempts to move past his struggles, with Coda being a fictional developer created for the game. ''[[Destructoid]]'' writer Darren Nakamura points out that for Wreden to publish a game at cost that is claimed to be the work of someone else, released without their permission, would be illegal, and thus providing evidence that Coda must be part of the game's fiction.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.destructoid.com/the-paradox-of-selling-the-beginner-s-guide-313521.phtml | title = The paradox of selling The Beginner's Guide | first = Darren | last = Nakamura | date = October 3, 2015 | accessdate = October 3, 2015 | work = [[Destructoid]] }}</ref> Emanuel Maiberg of ''Motherboard'' theorizes that Coda is in fact Wreden himself, with Coda representing Wreden's own psyche up to and including the release of ''[[The Stanley Parable]]''. Among other hints in the game, Maiberg explains that the name \"Coda\" can be taken as its definition, meaning \"a concluding part of a literary or dramatic work\", and the theme of closing one door and moving on repeats frequently in the game. Maiberg also points to one of the game concepts where the player in Coda's game is inundated with abstract figures from the press, and considers how much attention Wreden had received following ''The Stanley Parable''{{'}}s re-release.<ref name=\"motherboard\">{{cite web | url = http://motherboard.vice.com/read/step-inside-the-labyrinthine-mind-of-a-game-developer-in-the-beginners-guide | title = Step Inside the Labyrinthine Mind of a Game Developer in 'The Beginner's Guide' | first = Emanuel | last = Maiberg | work = Motherboard | publisher = [[Vice Media]] | date = October 1, 2015 | accessdate = October 2, 2015 }}</ref> Christopher Byrd, writing for the ''[[Washington Post]]'', points to blog posts made by Wreden after he had received a great deal of attention following the re-release of ''The Stanley Parable'', and that the game's version of Wreden is really a fictionalized version of himself acting as an [[unreliable narrator]], building upon his own personal experiences from the sudden media spotlight in the relationship between the fictional Wreden and Coda.<ref name=\"wapost\">{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2015/10/08/the-beginners-guide-to-blurring-the-lines-between-video-games-and-interactive-art/ | title = \u2018The Beginners Guide\u2019 to blurring the lines between video games and interactive art | first = Christopher | last = Byrd | date = October 8, 2015 | accessdate = October 8, 2015 | work = [[Washington Post]] }}</ref> Interactive fiction writer [[Emily Short]] believes that neither Wreden-as-narrator nor Coda are to be taken as Wreden's own self, but instead two representative characters of the game player and game developer, respectively, that Wreden attempts to show sympathy for in modern game development.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://boingboing.net/2015/10/12/lets-talk-more-about-the-beg.html | title = Let's talk more about The Beginner's Guide, a game about games | work = [[Boing Boing]] | date = October 12, 2015 | accessdate = October 13, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nAnother interpretative theme taken by some is that the game is presented as commentary on the role between the video game developer and their audience. ''[[PC World]]''{{'}}s Hayden Dingman believed the game was designed to demonstrate the fallacy of the ''[[Death of the Author]]'' essay applied to video game development, in which commentators attempt to attribute aspects of a game to how the game developer approached it, as opposed to considering how the game affected themselves.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/2989032/software-games/the-beginners-guide-review-a-weird-fiercely-personal-game.html | title = The Beginner's Guide review: A weird, fiercely personal game | first = Hayden | last = Dingman | date = October 3, 2015 | accessdate = October 3, 2015 | work = [[PC World]] }}</ref>  [[Gamasutra]]'s editor-in-chief Kris Graft notes that, as the game attempts to deconstruct the way players will interpret narrative video games, any attempt to interpret the deeper meaning behind ''The Beginner's Guide'' is paradoxically \"committing all of the sins\" that the game presents as problems with player interpretations of games.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/KrisGraft/20151012/255997/Creativity_as_an_open_question_Random_thoughts_on_The_Beginners_Guide.php | title = Creativity as an open question: Random thoughts on The Beginner's Guide | first = Kris | last = Graft | date = October 12, 2015 | accessdate = October 12, 2015 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref> Laura Mandanas, writing for Autostraddle, described the game as \"a man (poorly) coming to terms with his hugely overinflated sense of entitlement\", interpreting the game's themes as not only applicable to game development, but also to inter-personal relationships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autostraddle.com/the-beginners-guide-is-brilliant-horrifying-secretly-feminist-310119/|title=\"The Beginner\u2019s Guide\" Is Brilliant, Horrifying, Secretly Feminist|date=October 7, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=November 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\nSome have taken the game to be a work of non-fiction, in that the games presented are works of a real developer other than Wreden, and that the game itself could be seen as an unethical use of someone else's work and potentially copyright-violating.

the studio name Everything Unlimited Ltd. The game was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS X]] and [[Linux]] on October 1, 2015. The game is Wreden's follow-up to the critically praised ''[[The Stanley Parable]]'', his previous interactive storytelling title that was initially released in 2013.\n\nThe game is narrated by Wreden and takes the user through a number of incomplete and abstract game creations made by a developer named Coda. Wreden challenges the player to try to come to understand the type of person Coda is from exploring these spaces in a [[first-person perspective]]. Within the narrative, the player discovers that Wreden had tried to force meaning onto Coda's games, causing them to end their relationship. Wreden has stated the game is open to interpretation: some have seen the game as general commentary on the nature of the relationship between game developers and players, while others have taken it as an allegory to Wreden's own personal struggles with success resulting from ''The Stanley Parable''.\n\nThe game received polarized reviews. Many reviewers readily took to the narrative and the questions and ideas it raised on game development, while others felt the game forced some of Wreden's thoughts too hard and in a pretentious manner.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe gameplay in ''The Beginner's Guide'' is presented in a [[first-person perspective]] allowing the player to move about and explore the environment and interact with some elements of it as they progress along the work's [[interactive storytelling]]. The player hears details of the various scenes they explore via the game's narrator, Wreden himself, to describe what they see and make conclusions on the nature of the games' developer. Some areas include puzzle solving and [[conversation tree]]s, but there is no way for the player-character to die, or the player to make a mistake or lose the game.<ref name=\"gamespot review\"/> The narration helps the player get past certain parts of the game-spaces that were otherwise difficult or insuperable as designed, such as by providing a bridge to cross an invisible maze after the player discovers the difficulty.

In the game, the player, aided by Wreden's narration, looks to understand that of a game developer named Coda whom Wreden had met at a [[game jam]] in 2009. Coda is considered enigmatic, having created numerous strange game ideas which he has subsequently deleted or stored away and forgotten. The player explores these games, most being [[exploration game]]s developed from 2008 to 2011<ref name=\"paste review\"/> that were only half-created, and is encouraged by Wreden's narration to try to imagine what Coda's personality would be like based on the abstract and unconventional game spaces and ideas.<ref name=\"eurogamer review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-10-01-the-beginners-guide-review|title=The Beginner's Guide review|work=[[Eurogamer]]|first=Jeffrey|last=Matulef|date=October 1, 2015|accessdate=October 1, 2015}}</ref> ''The Beginner's Guide'' is presented in generally chronological order of Coda's prototypes, showing the progression of Coda's work as the developer learned more.<ref name=\"gamespot review\"/>\n\nWreden's narration explains that he was inspired by many of Coda's game concepts, providing his own analysis on many of the themes he perceived to appear in Coda's games. However, Wreden had seen that many of the games are based on themes of prisons, isolation, and difficulty in communicating with others, and that eventually Coda's games took a darker tone and took much longer to produce, focusing even more strongly on dialogue that implied that game development was no longer a positive activity for Coda. Wreden felt concerned that Coda was feeling depressed and weighed down by game development, and took it upon himself to show some of Coda's game concepts to others to get feedback to help encourage Coda to develop more. However, this in turn led to Coda to draw into seclusion. At some point in 2011, Wreden believed Coda had stopped making games, until he was sent an email with a private link to a final game by Coda.\n\nThis game, its design in stark contrast to the others Coda had made, included puzzles that were nearly unsolvable and a door that could not be opened from within the game. Wreden found that when he was able to use various programming tools to bypass these, he ended up in a gallery with a message from Coda directed at him, asking him not to talk to him any more nor to showcase his games to others. The messages implied Coda felt that Wreden mistook the tone of his games as a sign of an emotional struggle and was missing the point of why he had engaged in game design, as well as accusing Wreden with modifying Coda's games to add more symbolism, and that Wreden's actions had betrayed Coda. As a result, Wreden felt terrible about what he had done, and thus reveals that the purpose of ''The Beginner's Guide'' was to try to reconnect to Coda by sharing his games with the public at large and to hope to apologize for his actions.<ref name=\"boing boing\">{{Cite web|url=https://boingboing.net/2015/10/02/the-beginners-guide-is-a-gam.html|title=The Beginner's Guide is a game that doesn't want to be written about|first=Laura|last=Hudson|date=October 2, 2015|accessdate=October 2, 2015|work=[[Boing Boing]]}}</ref>\n\nThe game concludes with an [[epilogue]] level with Wreden sparsely narrating about his dependence on [[social validation]], something he saw as the cause for showing Coda's games to other people.\n\n===Interpretations===\nWithin the game, Wreden states that ''The Beginner's Guide'' is open to interpretation and invites players to share their own theories with him, providing his email address near the start of the game.<ref name=\"kotaku review\">{{Cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/the-beginners-guide-tackles-the-fears-we-dont-talk-abou-1734268227|title=The Beginner's Guide Tackles The Fears We Don't Talk About|first=Patrick|last=Klepick|date=October 2, 2015|accessdate=October 2, 2015|work=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]}}</ref>\n\nOne common interpretation is that the game is a metaphor for Wreden's own success and attempts to move past his struggles, with Coda being a fictional developer created for the game. ''[[Destructoid]]'' writer Darren Nakamura points out that for Wreden to publish a game at cost that is claimed to be the work of someone else, released without their permission, would be illegal, and thus providing evidence that Coda must be part of the game's fiction.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.destructoid.com/the-paradox-of-selling-the-beginner-s-guide-313521.phtml | title = The paradox of selling The Beginner's Guide | first = Darren | last = Nakamura | date = October 3, 2015 | accessdate = October 3, 2015 | work = [[Destructoid]] }}</ref> Emanuel Maiberg of ''Motherboard'' theorizes that Coda is in fact Wreden himself, with Coda representing Wreden's own psyche up to and including the release of ''[[The Stanley Parable]]''. Among other hints in the game, Maiberg explains that the name \"Coda\" can be taken as its definition, meaning \"a concluding part of a literary or dramatic work\", and the theme of closing one door and moving on repeats frequently in the game. Maiberg also points to one of the game concepts where the player in Coda's game is inundated with abstract figures from the press, and considers how much attention Wreden had received following ''The Stanley Parable''{{'}}s re-release.<ref name=\"motherboard\">{{cite web | url = http://motherboard.vice.com/read/step-inside-the-labyrinthine-mind-of-a-game-developer-in-the-beginners-guide | title = Step Inside the Labyrinthine Mind of a Game Developer in 'The Beginner's Guide' | first = Emanuel | last = Maiberg | work = Motherboard | publisher = [[Vice Media]] | date = October 1, 2015 | accessdate = October 2, 2015 }}</ref> Christopher Byrd, writing for the ''[[Washington Post]]'', points to blog posts made by Wreden after he had received a great deal of attention following the re-release of ''The Stanley Parable'', and that the game's version of Wreden is really a fictionalized version of himself acting as an [[unreliable narrator]], building upon his own personal experiences from the sudden media spotlight in the relationship between the fictional Wreden and Coda.<ref name=\"wapost\">{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2015/10/08/the-beginners-guide-to-blurring-the-lines-between-video-games-and-interactive-art/ | title = \u2018The Beginners Guide\u2019 to blurring the lines between video games and interactive art | first = Christopher | last = Byrd | date = October 8, 2015 | accessdate = October 8, 2015 | work = [[Washington Post]] }}</ref> Interactive fiction writer [[Emily Short]] believes that neither Wreden-as-narrator nor Coda are to be taken as Wreden's own self, but instead two representative characters of the game player and game developer, respectively, that Wreden attempts to show sympathy for in modern game development.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://boingboing.net/2015/10/12/lets-talk-more-about-the-beg.html | title = Let's talk more about The Beginner's Guide, a game about games | work = [[Boing Boing]] | date = October 12, 2015 | accessdate = October 13, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nAnother interpretative theme taken by some is that the game is presented as commentary on the role between the video game developer and their audience. ''[[PC World]]''{{'}}s Hayden Dingman believed the game was designed to demonstrate the fallacy of the ''[[Death of the Author]]'' essay applied to video game development, in which commentators attempt to attribute aspects of a game to how the game developer approached it, as opposed to considering how the game affected themselves.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/2989032/software-games/the-beginners-guide-review-a-weird-fiercely-personal-game.html | title = The Beginner's Guide review: A weird, fiercely personal game | first = Hayden | last = Dingman | date = October 3, 2015 | accessdate = October 3, 2015 | work = [[PC World]] }}</ref>  [[Gamasutra]]'s editor-in-chief Kris Graft notes that, as the game attempts to deconstruct the way players will interpret narrative video games, any attempt to interpret the deeper meaning behind ''The Beginner's Guide'' is paradoxically \"committing all of the sins\" that the game presents as problems with player interpretations of games.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/KrisGraft/20151012/255997/Creativity_as_an_open_question_Random_thoughts_on_The_Beginners_Guide.php | title = Creativity as an open question: Random thoughts on The Beginner's Guide | first = Kris | last = Graft | date = October 12, 2015 | accessdate = October 12, 2015 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref> Laura Mandanas, writing for Autostraddle, described the game as \"a man (poorly) coming to terms with his hugely overinflated sense of entitlement\", interpreting the game's themes as not only applicable to game development, but also to inter-personal relationships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autostraddle.com/the-beginners-guide-is-brilliant-horrifying-secretly-feminist-310119/|title=\"The Beginner\u2019s Guide\" Is Brilliant, Horrifying, Secretly Feminist|date=October 7, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=November 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\nSome have taken the game to be a work of non-fiction, in that the games presented are works of a real developer other than Wreden, and that the game itself could be seen as an unethical use of someone else's work and potentially copyright-violating. In considering this aspect, ''[[Destructoid]]''{{'}}s [[Laura Kate Dale]] commented with later clarification that the game was short enough to fall within the Steam [[Money back guarantee|refund]] window for those who believed the game was non-fiction and thus contain stolen works to return the game.<ref name=\"dtoid best new ip\">{{Cite web | url = http://www.destructoid.com/the-best-new-ips-of-2015-327259.phtml | title = The best new IPs of 2015 | first = Laura Kate | last = Dale | date = December 18, 2015 | accessdate = December 23, 2015 | work = [[Destructoid]] }}</ref> Dale's statement, prior to clarification, led to some controversy in that Dale was suggesting misuse of the Steam refund system, though her clarification made it clear she was addressing those believing it to be non-fiction.

He is known as a corrupt man who will pull every trick in the book to make money and he is not well liked by the community. He is also a notorious womaniser who has various brief flings. He briefly dates market trader [[Rachel Kominski]] ([[Jacquetta May]]) in 1992, but antagonises her later when he decides to give her permanent market pitch to his newly arrived friend, [[Sanjay Kapoor (EastEnders)|Sanjay Kapoor]] ([[Deepak Verma]]). In 1993 he has sex with 17-year-old [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]), and when he dumps her shortly after, she and her friend [[Natalie Evans|Natalie]] ([[Lucy Speed]]) vandalise his flat. Later he has a longer-lasting romance with [[Kathy Beale]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]), which sours when she discovers that he is taking a cash bribe and allowing a mobile hot dog van to trade in direct competition to her caf\u00e9.\n\nRichard makes various enemies, including [[Alan Jackson (EastEnders)|Alan Jackson]] ([[Howard Antony]]) who he reports for benefit fraud, [[Arthur Fowler]] ([[Bill Treacher]]) whom he causes to lose his job as market sweeper, and the lovers [[Mandy Salter]] and [[Aidan Brosnan]] ([[Nicola Stapleton]] and [[Sean Maguire]]). Richard buys a property to let out for rent; Mandy and Aidan are squatting in one of the bedsits at the time and Richard evicts them, leaving Aidan homeless and suicidal over Christmas 1993. However, Richard's main rival is Kathy's son [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]). Richard relishes winding up Ian by flirting with Ian's wife [[Cindy Beale|Cindy]] ([[Michelle Collins]]). Richard spreads rumours about having an affair with Cindy, implying that he is the father of Cindy's unborn twins, which causes various problems in the Beale marriage for a while. Later, Richard orchestrates the closure of Ian's catering business the \"Meal Machine\" by reporting him to environmental health.\n\nIn revenge for this in 1994, Ian forces Richard to flee Walford when he finds out some unsavoury things about his past. Richard had been a former planning officer for the council in [[Doncaster]]; he and a colleague, Neil Bradley (Martyn Whitby), had taken monetary bribes, but when they were caught, Richard framed his colleague, leading to the colleague's imprisonment.

He is known as a corrupt man who will pull every trick in the book to make money and he is not well liked by the community. He is also a notorious womaniser who has various brief flings. He briefly dates market trader [[Rachel Kominski]] ([[Jacquetta May]]) in 1992, but antagonises her later when he decides to give her permanent market pitch to his newly arrived friend, [[Sanjay Kapoor (EastEnders)|Sanjay Kapoor]] ([[Deepak Verma]]). In 1993 he has sex with 17-year-old [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]), and when he dumps her shortly after, she and her friend [[Natalie Evans|Natalie]] ([[Lucy Speed]]) vandalise his flat. Later he has a longer-lasting romance with [[Kathy Beale]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]), which sours when she discovers that he is taking a cash bribe and allowing a mobile hot dog van to trade in direct competition to her caf\u00e9.\n\nRichard makes various enemies, including [[Alan Jackson (EastEnders)|Alan Jackson]] ([[Howard Antony]]) who he reports for benefit fraud, [[Arthur Fowler]] ([[Bill Treacher]]) whom he causes to lose his job as market sweeper, and the lovers [[Mandy Salter]] and [[Aidan Brosnan]] ([[Nicola Stapleton]] and [[Sean Maguire]]). Richard buys a property to let out for rent; Mandy and Aidan are squatting in one of the bedsits at the time and Richard evicts them, leaving Aidan homeless and suicidal over Christmas 1993. However, Richard's main rival is Kathy's son [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]). Richard relishes winding up Ian by flirting with Ian's wife [[Cindy Beale|Cindy]] ([[Michelle Collins]]). Richard spreads rumours about having an affair with Cindy, implying that he is the father of Cindy's unborn twins, which causes various problems in the Beale marriage for a while. Later, Richard orchestrates the closure of Ian's catering business the \"Meal Machine\" by reporting him to environmental health.\n\nIn revenge for this in 1994, Ian forces Richard to flee Walford when he finds out some unsavoury things about his past. Richard had been a former planning officer for the council in [[Doncaster]]; he and a colleague, Neil Bradley, had taken monetary bribes, but when they were caught, Richard framed his colleague, leading to the colleague's imprisonment. After Ian takes photographic evidence of Richard and threatens to inform Bradley where Richard is, Richard disappears, leaving his belongings/property in Sanjay's possession.

The recruited peer educators are trained in relevant health information and communication skills. Armed with these skills, the peer educators then engage their peers in conversations about the issue of concern, seeking to promote health-enhancing knowledge and skills. The intention is that familiar people, giving locally-relevant and meaningful suggestions, in appropriate local language and taking account of the local context, will be most likely to be able to promote health-enhancing behaviour change.\n\nThere is a great variety in the support provided to peer educators. Sometimes they are unpaid volunteers, sometimes they are given a small honorarium, sometimes they receive a reasonable salary. The peer educators may be supported by regular meetings and training, or expected to continue their work without formal supports.\n\n==Theories==\nA variety of theories are offered regarding the question of how peer education is supposed to achieve positive results.\n\n===Kelly's popular opinion leader theory===\nThe popular opinion leader theory<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kelly | first1 = J.A. | year = 2004 | title = Popular opinion leaders and HIV prevention peer education: resolving discrepant findings, and implications for the development of effective community programmes | url = http://www.effectiveinterventions.org/files/POL_files1%20Folder/POL_Kelly_Article04.pdf | journal = AIDS Care | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 139\u2013150 | doi = 10.1080/09540120410001640986 | pmid = 14676020 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> suggests a parallel between peer education and the marketing of commercial products. Peer educators are seen as ''opinion leaders''\u2014respected and admired by other members of the community. These opinion leaders espouse a certain lifestyle (such as safer sex, or not smoking, etc.)\u2014and their peers wish to emulate them.\n\n===Critical consciousness===\nCampbell argues that what peer education ought to do is to promote the kind of [[critical consciousness]] theorised by [[Paulo Freire]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = Catherine | last2 = MacPhail | first2 = Catherine | year = 2002 | title = Peer education, gender and the development of critical consciousness: participatory HIV prevention by South African youth | url = http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/385/ | journal = Social Science and Medicine | volume = 55 | issue = 2| pages = 331\u2013345 | doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(01)00289-1| pmid = 12144146 }}</ref> This means that peers use the peer education process to critically discuss their circumstances, especially the social factors impacting upon their health. Becoming critically aware of these forces is the first step to tackling them. So, for instance, if local norms regarding sexuality and gender put people's health at risk, this approach argues that peers should critically discuss those norms, so that they can then collectively seek to establish new more health-enhancing norms.\n\n===Social learning theory===\nBased on the work of [[Albert Bandura|Bandura]] and colleagues, [[social learning theory]] claims that modelling is an important component of the learning process. In the most basic sense, people observe behaviour taking place and then go on to adopt similar behaviour. Participants require the opportunity to practice modelled behavior and positive reinforcement if it is to be adopted successfully.<ref>Bandura, A. (1977) Social Learning Theory. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ.</ref>\n\n===Differential association theory===\nBased on the work of Sutherland and Cressy,<ref>Sutherland, E. H. and Cressy, D. R. (1960) Principles of Criminology. Lippincott, Philadelphia.</ref> [[differential association theory]] has been applied to the study of crime. Rather than the result of biological or psychological disorders, crime is a learned behaviour. This learning happens in social situations by associating with those who can teach the necessary skills and techniques needed. Through this theory it can be understood that peers can be very influential for both positive and negative behaviours. Young people can learn both good and bad habits from each other. In differential association theory the mere association with others provides a learning opportunity. If social learning theory is essentially psychological, differential association theory is essentially sociological.\n\n===Role theory===\nSarbin argues that peer educators will adapt to the role expectations of a tutor and behave appropriately. Furthermore, through adopting a role, individuals develop a deeper understanding and commitment to it. The potential is that Peer educators can develop a stronger commitment and a greater appreciation of the relevance of the health topic. [[Role theory]] is also based on the premise that communication can be blocked by differences in [[culture]] between the teacher and learner. Peer educators who have a similar set of experiences and culture are therefore likely to be more effective in promoting learning.<ref>Sarbin, T. R. and Allen, V. L. (1968) Role theory. In Lindzey, G. and Aronson, E. (eds), Handbook of Social Psychology, Vol. 1. Addison-Wesley, Reading, pp. 488\u2013567.</ref>\n\n===Communication of innovations theory===\nDeveloped by [[Everett Rogers|Rogers]] and Shoemaker, the communication of innovations theory explains how innovations come to be adopted by communities and what factors influence the rate of adoption. These factors include the characteristics of those who adopt the innovation, the nature of the social system, the characteristics of the innovation and the characteristics of change agents. Rogers and Shoemaker argue that all innovations follow a similar pattern of adoption, with one group of people\u2014the ''innovators''\u2014taking it up immediately. Then there are ''early adopters'', the ''early majority'', the ''late majority'' and finally the ''laggards'', including some who never adopt the innovation. In this theory key people influence the opinion leaders within a community. Change agents can be viewed as health professionals while opinion leaders correlate with peer educators. Rogers and Shoemaker argue that effective communication occurs when the source and receiver are ''homophilous'', that is, are similar in certain attributes. These include beliefs, values, education and social status. This would suggest that peers communicate better than those who are unequal or different.<ref>Rogers, E. M. and Shoemaker, F. F. (1971) Communication of Innovations. New York, Free Press.</ref>\n\n==Support==\nPeer educators are seen as credible sources of information.<ref name=\"sriranganathan\" /> This has been shown to be particularly effective amongst the youth population.

The recruited peer educators are trained in relevant health information and communication skills. Armed with these skills, the peer educators then engage their peers in conversations about the issue of concern, seeking to promote health-enhancing knowledge and skills. The intention is that familiar people, giving locally-relevant and meaningful suggestions, in appropriate local language and taking account of the local context, will be most likely to be able to promote health-enhancing behaviour change.\n\nThere is a great variety in the support provided to peer educators. Sometimes they are unpaid volunteers, sometimes they are given a small honorarium, sometimes they receive a reasonable salary. The peer educators may be supported by regular meetings and training, or expected to continue their work without formal supports.\n\n==Theories==\nA variety of theories are offered regarding the question of how peer education is supposed to achieve positive results.\n\n===Kelly's popular opinion leader theory===\nThe popular opinion leader theory<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kelly | first1 = J.A. | year = 2004 | title = Popular opinion leaders and HIV prevention peer education: resolving discrepant findings, and implications for the development of effective community programmes | url = http://www.effectiveinterventions.org/files/POL_files1%20Folder/POL_Kelly_Article04.pdf | journal = AIDS Care | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 139\u2013150 | doi = 10.1080/09540120410001640986 | pmid = 14676020 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> suggests a parallel between peer education and the marketing of commercial products. Peer educators are seen as ''opinion leaders''\u2014respected and admired by other members of the community. These opinion leaders espouse a certain lifestyle (such as safer sex, or not smoking, etc.)\u2014and their peers wish to emulate them.\n\n===Critical consciousness===\nCampbell argues that what peer education ought to do is to promote the kind of [[critical consciousness]] theorised by [[Paulo Freire]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = Catherine | last2 = MacPhail | first2 = Catherine | year = 2002 | title = Peer education, gender and the development of critical consciousness: participatory HIV prevention by South African youth | url = http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/385/ | journal = Social Science and Medicine | volume = 55 | issue = 2| pages = 331\u2013345 | doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(01)00289-1| pmid = 12144146 }}</ref> This means that peers use the peer education process to critically discuss their circumstances, especially the social factors impacting upon their health. Becoming critically aware of these forces is the first step to tackling them. So, for instance, if local norms regarding sexuality and gender put people's health at risk, this approach argues that peers should critically discuss those norms, so that they can then collectively seek to establish new more health-enhancing norms.\n\n===Social learning theory===\nBased on the work of [[Albert Bandura|Bandura]] and colleagues, [[social learning theory]] claims that modelling is an important component of the learning process. In the most basic sense, people observe behaviour taking place and then go on to adopt similar behaviour. Participants require the opportunity to practice modelled behavior and positive reinforcement if it is to be adopted successfully.<ref>Bandura, A. (1977) Social Learning Theory. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ.</ref>\n\n===Differential association theory===\nBased on the work of Sutherland and Cressy,<ref>Sutherland, E. H. and Cressy, D. R. (1960) Principles of Criminology. Lippincott, Philadelphia.</ref> [[differential association theory]] has been applied to the study of crime. Rather than the result of biological or psychological disorders, crime is a learned behaviour. This learning happens in social situations by associating with those who can teach the necessary skills and techniques needed. Through this theory it can be understood that peers can be very influential for both positive and negative behaviours. Young people can learn both good and bad habits from each other. In differential association theory the mere association with others provides a learning opportunity. If social learning theory is essentially psychological, differential association theory is essentially sociological.\n\n===Role theory===\nSarbin argues that peer educators will adapt to the role expectations of a tutor and behave appropriately. Furthermore, through adopting a role, individuals develop a deeper understanding and commitment to it. The potential is that Peer educators can develop a stronger commitment and a greater appreciation of the relevance of the health topic. [[Role theory]] is also based on the premise that communication can be blocked by differences in [[culture]] between the teacher and learner. Peer educators who have a similar set of experiences and culture are therefore likely to be more effective in promoting learning.<ref>Sarbin, T. R. and Allen, V. L. (1968) Role theory. In Lindzey, G. and Aronson, E. (eds), Handbook of Social Psychology, Vol. 1. Addison-Wesley, Reading, pp. 488\u2013567.</ref>\n\n===Communication of innovations theory===\nDeveloped by [[Everett Rogers|Rogers]] and Shoemaker, the communication of innovations theory explains how innovations come to be adopted by communities and what factors influence the rate of adoption. These factors include the characteristics of those who adopt the innovation, the nature of the social system, the characteristics of the innovation and the characteristics of change agents. Rogers and Shoemaker argue that all innovations follow a similar pattern of adoption, with one group of people\u2014the ''innovators''\u2014taking it up immediately. Then there are ''early adopters'', the ''early majority'', the ''late majority'' and finally the ''laggards'', including some who never adopt the innovation. In this theory key people influence the opinion leaders within a community. Change agents can be viewed as health professionals while opinion leaders correlate with peer educators. Rogers and Shoemaker argue that effective communication occurs when the source and receiver are ''homophilous'', that is, are similar in certain attributes. These include beliefs, values, education and social status. This would suggest that peers communicate better than those who are unequal or different.<ref>Rogers, E. M. and Shoemaker, F. F. (1971) Communication of Innovations. New York, Free Press.</ref>\n\n==Support==\nPeer educators are seen as credible sources of information.<ref name=\"sriranganathan\" /> This has been shown to be particularly effective amongst the youth population.

Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11.

Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences.

He was unwittingly caught up in the famous player-writer dispute of 1924 (overview in reference<ref>''Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', May 11, 1924 pp. 1-2D. The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28.

This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences.

There was a nostalgic sentiment to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.
