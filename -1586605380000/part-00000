On September 20, these forces were some 40 kilometers north of Tomasz\u00f3w, in the area of [[Sitaniec]]. General D\u0105b-Biernacki, who commanded them, until the final hours had no idea about the ongoing battle and did not help fighting troops. At the same time, general Piskor did not know about D\u0105b-Biernacki's units operating northeast of Tomasz\u00f3w. Altogether, forces of ''Northern Front'' had 39,000 soldiers and 225 cannons.<ref>Czes\u0142aw Grzelak, Henryk Sta\u0144czyk Kampania Polska 1939 roku, page 312.

Polish forces were no match to German [[10th Army (Wehrmacht)|10th Army]] and [[14th Army (Wehrmacht)|14th Army]], guarding the roads to the south, but general D\u0105b-Biernacki, at a meeting of his officers on September 18 in the village of Wereszcze Du\u017ce near [[Che\u0142m]], decided to go along with an attempt to break to Hungary or Romania. D\u0105b-Biernacki already knew that [[Red Army]] had invaded Poland the day before, so time was of crucial importance.\n\n''Northern Front'' forces marched southwards from the area of Che\u0142m in two columns, towards [[Zamo\u015b\u0107]], which D\u0105b-Biernacki decided to attack. On September 18, Poles attacked [[Krasnystaw]], but failed to capture it. On next day, D\u0105b-Biernacki ordered the attack on Zamo\u015b\u0107 to be carried out on Sept. 20, but in the night of Sept 19/20, he found out about the ongoing battle of Tomasz\u00f3w Lubelski and decided to help. ''Northern Front'' units headed towards Tomasz\u00f3w, but on September 20 in the evening, they were attacked by 4th Light Division and [[27th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|27th Infantry Division]] near Cze\u015bniki. Meanwhile, units of Operational Group of general Emil Krukowicz-Przedrzymirski reached the area of Tomasz\u00f3w, and on September 21, a few hours the first phase of the battle had ended, attacked troops under command of general [[Ernst Busch (military)|Ernst Busch]] ([[28th J\u00e4ger Division (Germany)|28th J\u00e4ger Division]] and [[8th J\u00e4ger Division]]). Since Polish forces proved to be stronger than expected, field marshal [[Wilhelm List]] decided to send reinforcements to general Busch - [[68th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|68th Infantry Division]], 27th I.D., and 2nd Panzer Division, which had just mopped Polish forces in the first phase of the battle of Tomasz\u00f3w Lubelski.\n\nIn the evening of September 22, cavalry of general W\u0142adys\u0142aw Anders attacked, capturing [[Krasnystaw]], and then reaching [[Samborzec|Sambor]]. Other Polish units were not successful, and in several skirmishes were surrounded on September 23. General D\u0105b-Biernacki ordered his officers to capitulate, escaped the encirclement, and left Poland, ending up in [[France]]. General Przedrzymirski refused to obey the order, and on September 24 attacked [[Krasnobr\u00f3d]], but then was stopped by 8th Jager Division. Most of the remaining Polish forces capitulated around 26 September.<ref>Seidner,''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the Defense of Poland'', New York,1978 ,277</ref>\n\n==Order of Battle==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Polish First Phase\n|-\n!\n!

Seidner,''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the Defense of Poland'', New York,1978 ,226-28</ref>\n\n== Second phase ==\n\n[[File:Bitwa tomaszow lub 2.png|thumbnail|left|Map of the second phase by [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Lonio17 Lonio17]]]\nThe second phase (also known as the ''Second Battle of Tomasz\u00f3w Lubelski'') involved Polish units from the so-called ''Northern Front'' - remaining elements of Army Lublin, [[Army Modlin]] and [[Operational Group]]s [[Operational Group Wyszk\u00f3w|Wyszk\u00f3w]], [[Operational Group Narew|Narew]] and [[Nowogr\u00f3dzka Cavalry Brigade]] under generals [[Emil Krukowicz-Przedrzymirski]] and [[Stefan D\u0105b-Biernacki]]. On September 20, these forces were some 40 kilometers north of Tomasz\u00f3w, in the area of [[Sitaniec]]. General D\u0105b-Biernacki, who commanded them, until the final hours had no idea about the ongoing battle and did not help fighting troops. At the same time, general Piskor did not know about D\u0105b-Biernacki's units operating northeast of Tomasz\u00f3w. Altogether, forces of ''Northern Front'' had 39,000 soldiers and 225 cannons.<ref>Czes\u0142aw Grzelak, Henryk Sta\u0144czyk Kampania Polska 1939 roku, page 312. Oficyna Wydawnicza RYTM Warszawa, 2005. {{ISBN|83-7399-169-7}}</ref> They were divided into three groups - Cavalry of general [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Anders]], Operational Group of general [[Jan Kruszewski]], and Operational Group of general Emil Krukowicz-Przedrzymirski. Polish forces were no match to German [[10th Army (Wehrmacht)|10th Army]] and [[14th Army (Wehrmacht)|14th Army]], guarding the roads to the south, but general D\u0105b-Biernacki, at a meeting of his officers on September 18 in the village of Wereszcze Du\u017ce near [[Che\u0142m]], decided to go along with an attempt to break to Hungary or Romania. D\u0105b-Biernacki already knew that [[Red Army]] had invaded Poland the day before, so time was of crucial importance.\n\n''Northern Front'' forces marched southwards from the area of Che\u0142m in two columns, towards [[Zamo\u015b\u0107]], which D\u0105b-Biernacki decided to attack. On September 18, Poles attacked [[Krasnystaw]], but failed to capture it. On next day, D\u0105b-Biernacki ordered the attack on Zamo\u015b\u0107 to be carried out on Sept. 20, but in the night of Sept 19/20, he found out about the ongoing battle of Tomasz\u00f3w Lubelski and decided to help. ''Northern Front'' units headed towards Tomasz\u00f3w, but on September 20 in the evening, they were attacked by 4th Light Division and [[27th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|27th Infantry Division]] near Cze\u015bniki. Meanwhile, units of Operational Group of general Emil Krukowicz-Przedrzymirski reached the area of Tomasz\u00f3w, and on September 21, a few hours the first phase of the battle had ended, attacked troops under command of general [[Ernst Busch (military)|Ernst Busch]] ([[28th J\u00e4ger Division (Germany)|28th J\u00e4ger Division]] and [[8th J\u00e4ger Division]]). Since Polish forces proved to be stronger than expected, field marshal [[Wilhelm List]] decided to send reinforcements to general Busch - [[68th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|68th Infantry Division]], 27th I.D., and 2nd Panzer Division, which had just mopped Polish forces in the first phase of the battle of Tomasz\u00f3w Lubelski.\n\nIn the evening of September 22, cavalry of general W\u0142adys\u0142aw Anders attacked, capturing [[Krasnystaw]], and then reaching [[Samborzec|Sambor]]. Other Polish units were not successful, and in several skirmishes were surrounded on September 23. General D\u0105b-Biernacki ordered his officers to capitulate, escaped the encirclement, and left Poland, ending up in [[France]]. General Przedrzymirski refused to obey the order, and on September 24 attacked [[Krasnobr\u00f3d]], but then was stopped by 8th Jager Division. Most of the remaining Polish forces capitulated around 26 September.<ref>Seidner,''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the Defense of Poland'', New York,1978 ,277</ref>\n\n==Order of Battle==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Polish First Phase\n|-\n!\n!

[[Asexuality]] is distinct from sexual abstinence; and [[celibacy]] is sexual abstinence generally motivated by factors such as an individual's personal or religious beliefs.<ref>''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'' (3d ed. 1992), entries for ''celibacy'' and thence ''abstinence''</ref>  Sexual abstinence before [[marriage]] is required in some societies by social norms, or, in some countries, even by laws, and is considered part of [[chastity]].\n\nAbstinence may be voluntary (when an individual chooses not to engage in sexual activity due to moral, religious, philosophical, or other reasons), an involuntary result of social circumstances (when one cannot find any willing [[sexual partner]]s), or legally mandated (e.g. in countries where sexual activity outside marriage is illegal, in prisons etc.).\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe ancient world discouraged [[promiscuity]] for both health and social reasons.<ref name=Uta>{{cite book |title=Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven - the Catholic Church and Sexuality|author=Uta Ranke.Heinman|publisher=Penguin Books USA|year=1988|isbn=0-385-26527-1}}</ref> According to [[Pythagoras]] (6th century BCE) sex should be practiced in the winter, but not the summer, but was harmful to male health in every season because the loss of semen was dangerous, hard to control and both physically and spiritually exhausting, but had no effect on females.<ref name=\"Uta\" /> This idea may have been merged with [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] ideas of [[good and evil]] in a philosophy known as [[Gnosticism]], which influenced [[Gnosticism and the New Testament|Christian]] and [[Mariwan Halabjaee|Islamic]] attitudes to sexual activity.<ref name=\"Uta\" /> But others stated that the Christian religion's hold on to the ideal of sexual abstinence prior to the appearing of gnosticism and Zoroastrianism and its roots are to be found in the Old Testament (which is the base of the New Testament) in which  virginity was required by law and marriage was especially protected (see Deuteronomy chapter 22).\n\nThroughout history, and especially prior to the 20th century, there have been those who have held that sexual abstinence confers numerous health benefits. For males, lack of abstinence was thought to cause a reduction of vitality. In modern times, the argument has been phrased in biological terms, claiming that loss of [[semen]] through ejaculation results in a depletion of vital nutrients such as [[lecithin]] and [[phosphorus]], which are also found at high levels in the [[Human brain|brain]]. Conservation of the semen allegedly allows it to be reabsorbed back into the bloodstream and aid in the healthy development of the body. {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Along these lines, the noted German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] spoke of the positive physiological effects of abstinence: \"The reabsorption of semen by the blood ... perhaps prompts the stimulus of power, the unrest of all forces towards the overcoming of resistances ... The feeling of power has so far mounted highest in abstinent priests and hermits\" (quoted by Walter Kaufman in his classic, ''Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist'', p.&nbsp;222). Before the \"[[sexual revolution]]\" of the 1960s, it was commonly believed by members of the medical profession that numerous mental and physical diseases in men were caused primarily by loss of [[nutrient]]s through seminal discharge, and that the deliberate conservation of this substance would lead to increased health, vitality, and intellectual prowess. This also applied to masturbation, which was also thought to lead to [[bedwetting]] and [[Pseudoscience|hairy palms]].\n\nSome advantages in favor of sexual abstinence were also claimed by Walter Siegmeister, better known as Dr. Raymond W. Bernard A.B., M.A., PhD, an early 20th-century American alternative health, esoteric writer, author and mystic, who formed part of the alternative reality subculture. In his essay entitled \"Science discovers the physiological value of continence\" (1957) he states:<ref>\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20100818043434/http://ktk.ru/~cm/contin.htm Science discovers the physiological value of continence]\"</ref>\n\n: \"[I]t is clear that there is an important internal [[physiology|physiological]] relation between the secretions of the sex [[gland]]s and the [[central nervous system]], that the loss of these secretions, voluntarily or involuntarily, exercises a detrimental effect on the nutrition and vitality of the nerves and brain, while, on the other hand, the conservation of these secretions has a vitalizing effect on the nervous system, a regenerating effect on the [[endocrine glands]][,] and a rejuvenating effect on the organism as a whole.\"\n\nHistorically, there has been a swing from the [[Libertine|sexually liberal]] end of the [[Industrial Revolution]] to the chaste values of the early [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] period.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} This was then followed by a new [[Religious fanaticism|puritanism]] from the late Victorian era to the mid-1900s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} This important transformation often colors discussion of sexual behavior in the later 20th century. [[World War I]] began a return to sexual freedom and indulgence, but more often than not, the appearance of conforming to the earlier moral values of abstinence before marriage was retained.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} With the conclusion of [[World War II]], the societal importance of abstinence declined.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} The advent of the first [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|oral contraceptive pill]] and widely available [[antibiotics]] suppressed many consequences of wide and free sexual behavior,{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} while social morals were also changing. By the 1970s, abandonment of premarital chastity was no longer taboo in the majority of western societies, and the reverse became true.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} Some cultural groups continued to place a value on the moral purity of an abstainer, but abstinence was caught up in a wider reevaluation of [[moral values]].\n\nDuring the early 20th century, prominent [[feminist]] and [[birth control]] advocate [[Margaret Sanger]] argued that abstinence from sexual activity led to greater endurance and strength, and was a sign of the best of the species:\n\n: \"Though sex cells are placed in a part of the anatomy for the essential purpose of easily expelling them into the female for the purpose of reproduction, there are other elements in the sexual fluid which are the essence of blood, nerve, brain, and muscle. When redirected into the building and strengthening of these, we find men or women of the greatest endurance and greatest magnetic power. A girl can waste her creative powers by brooding over a love affair to the extent of exhausting her system, with the results not unlike the effects of masturbation and debauchery.\"<ref name=\"Sanger\">{{Citation | url = http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/webedition/app/documents/show.php?sangerDoc=304923.xml | title = What Every Girl Should Know: Sexual Impulses \u2014 Part II | first = Margaret | last = Sanger | date = 29 December 1912 | accessdate = 6 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[J. D. Unwin]] was a British ethnologist and social anthropologist at [[Oxford University]] and [[Cambridge University]]. Joseph Unwin wrote several books including ''Sex and Culture'',  (1934). In ''Sex and Culture'' Unwin studied 80 primitive tribes and 6 known civilizations through 5,000 years of history and found a positive correlation between the cultural achievement of a people and the amount of sexual restraint which they observed. The author finds that the most culturally successful groups always exhibit lifelong monogamous relationships which include sexual abstinence outside of marriage.<ref>\"Any human society is free to choose either to display great energy or to enjoy sexual freedom; the evidence is that it cannot do both for more than one generation.\" Unwin, J. D. (1934) ''Sex and Culture,'' p. 412.</ref> According to Unwin, after a nation becomes prosperous it becomes increasingly liberal with regard to sexual morality and as a result loses its cohesion, its impetus and its purpose, ultimately having a negative effect on society: \"The whole of human history does not contain a single instance of a group becoming civilized unless it has been absolutely monogamous, nor is there any example of a group retaining its culture after it has adopted less rigorous customs.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Unwin | first1 = J.

Some religious systems prohibit sexual activities between a person and anyone other than a spouse of that person, as have, in the past, legal systems and societal [[Norm (sociology)|norms]]. In such contexts, sexual abstinence was prescribed for unmarried individuals for the purpose of chastity.

Abstinence is often viewed as an act of self-control over the natural desire to have sex. The display of the strength of character allows the abstainer to set an example for those not able to contain their \"base urges\". At other times, abstinence has been seen as a great social skill practiced by those who refuse to engage with the material and physical world. Some groups and teachers that propose sexual abstinence consider it an essential means to reach a particular intellectual or spiritual condition, or that chastity allows one to achieve a required self-control or self-consciousness.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=979394 SSRN-The Hermeneutics of Sexual Order by L.

Although many individuals abstain from sex for reasons such as religion or morality, some individuals may simply have a dislike of sex ([[antisexualism]]), or are simply not interested in it ([[asexuality]]). They may view sexual activity as an unnecessary part of human life. As with other lifestyle choices, this attitude toward sexual activity and relationships can vary.

These groups include [[monk]]s, [[nun]]s, and [[priest]]s in various sects of Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Christianity. Chastity is required of the respective [[clergy|sacerdotal]] orders.

In males, the semen ([[V\u012brya]]) is considered sacred, and its preservation (except when used for procreation) and conversion into higher life-energy (Ojas) is considered essential for the development of enhanced intellectual and [[spirituality|spiritual]] capacities.\n\nThe blending of sexual and spiritual is portrayed in Hindu iconography, as seen in ubiquitous phallic and vaginal iconography in Hindu temples and for instance in the Kharjuraho and Konarak medieval temples, where thousands of couples having sex in endless positions, and with the gods, are carved in deep [[bas-relief]].  However, these depictions of sex are not generally understood to be a license for free sexual practices, but are instead meant to celebrate procreation as an integral part of existence in the universe.  In actual practice, there is a strong societal taboo against pre-marital sex for both males and females, which still exists today in Hindu cultures.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n===Islam===\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2017}}\nIslam forbids [[zina|intercourse outside of marriage]] (''zina''). However, maintaining celibacy as an act of piety is not recognized, while marriage for all who are able is strongly encouraged. Abstinence is practiced during the time of a woman's [[menstruation]].

For those Jains who adopt the path of monks, celibacy in action, words and thoughts is expected. For lay Jains who are married, the virtue of ''brahmacharya'' requires remaining sexually faithful to one's chosen partner ([[fidelity]]). For lay Jains who are unmarried, chaste living requires Jains to avoid sex before marriage.<ref>{{citation |title=Brahmacarya |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/jainism/living/brahmacarya.shtml |publisher=[[BBC]] }}</ref>\n\nIn the Jain monastic tradition, ''brahmacharya'' implies, among other things, the mandatory renunciation of sex and marriage.

[[Asexuality]] is distinct from sexual abstinence; and [[celibacy]] is sexual abstinence generally motivated by factors such as an individual's personal or religious beliefs.<ref>''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'' (3d ed. 1992), entries for ''celibacy'' and thence ''abstinence''</ref>  Sexual abstinence before [[marriage]] is required in some societies by social norms, or, in some countries, even by laws, and is considered part of [[chastity]].\n\nAbstinence may be voluntary (when an individual chooses not to engage in sexual activity due to moral, religious, philosophical, etc. reasons), an involuntary result of social circumstances (when one cannot find any willing [[sexual partner]]s), or legally mandated (e.g. in countries where sexual activity outside marriage is illegal, in prisons etc.).\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe ancient world discouraged [[promiscuity]] for both health and social reasons.<ref name=Uta>{{cite book |title=Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven - the Catholic Church and Sexuality|author=Uta Ranke.Heinman|publisher=Penguin Books USA|year=1988|isbn=0-385-26527-1}}</ref> According to [[Pythagoras]] (6th century BCE) sex should be practiced in the winter, but not the summer, but was harmful to male health in every season because the loss of semen was dangerous, hard to control and both physically and spiritually exhausting, but had no effect on females.<ref name=\"Uta\" /> This idea may have been merged with [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] ideas of [[good and evil]] in a philosophy known as [[Gnosticism]], which influenced [[Gnosticism and the New Testament|Christian]] and [[Mariwan Halabjaee|Islamic]] attitudes to sexual activity.<ref name=\"Uta\" /> But others stated that the Christian religion's hold on to the ideal of sexual abstinence prior to the appearing of gnosticism and Zoroastrianism and its roots are to be found in the Old Testament (which is the base of the New Testament) in which  virginity was required by law and marriage was especially protected (see Deuteronomy chapter 22).\n\nThroughout history, and especially prior to the 20th century, there have been those who have held that sexual abstinence confers numerous health benefits. For males, lack of abstinence was thought to cause a reduction of vitality. In modern times, the argument has been phrased in biological terms, claiming that loss of [[semen]] through ejaculation results in a depletion of vital nutrients such as [[lecithin]] and [[phosphorus]], which are also found at high levels in the [[Human brain|brain]]. Conservation of the semen allegedly allows it to be reabsorbed back into the bloodstream and aid in the healthy development of the body. {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Along these lines, the noted German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] spoke of the positive physiological effects of abstinence: \"The reabsorption of semen by the blood ... perhaps prompts the stimulus of power, the unrest of all forces towards the overcoming of resistances ... The feeling of power has so far mounted highest in abstinent priests and hermits\" (quoted by Walter Kaufman in his classic, ''Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist'', p.&nbsp;222). Before the \"[[sexual revolution]]\" of the 1960s, it was commonly believed by members of the medical profession that numerous mental and physical diseases in men were caused primarily by loss of [[nutrient]]s through seminal discharge, and that the deliberate conservation of this substance would lead to increased health, vitality, and intellectual prowess. This also applied to masturbation, which was also thought to lead to [[bedwetting]] and [[Pseudoscience|hairy palms]].\n\nSome advantages in favor of sexual abstinence were also claimed by Walter Siegmeister, better known as Dr. Raymond W. Bernard A.B., M.A., PhD, an early 20th-century American alternative health, esoteric writer, author and mystic, who formed part of the alternative reality subculture. In his essay entitled \"Science discovers the physiological value of continence\" (1957) he states:<ref>\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20100818043434/http://ktk.ru/~cm/contin.htm Science discovers the physiological value of continence]\"</ref>\n\n: \"[I]t is clear that there is an important internal [[physiology|physiological]] relation between the secretions of the sex [[gland]]s and the [[central nervous system]], that the loss of these secretions, voluntarily or involuntarily, exercises a detrimental effect on the nutrition and vitality of the nerves and brain, while, on the other hand, the conservation of these secretions has a vitalizing effect on the nervous system, a regenerating effect on the [[endocrine glands]][,] and a rejuvenating effect on the organism as a whole.\"\n\nHistorically, there has been a swing from the [[Libertine|sexually liberal]] end of the [[Industrial Revolution]] to the chaste values of the early [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] period.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} This was then followed by a new [[Religious fanaticism|puritanism]] from the late Victorian era to the mid-1900s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} This important transformation often colors discussion of sexual behavior in the later 20th century. [[World War I]] began a return to sexual freedom and indulgence, but more often than not, the appearance of conforming to the earlier moral values of abstinence before marriage was retained.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} With the conclusion of [[World War II]], the societal importance of abstinence declined.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} The advent of the first [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|oral contraceptive pill]] and widely available [[antibiotics]] suppressed many consequences of wide and free sexual behavior,{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} while social morals were also changing. By the 1970s, abandonment of premarital chastity was no longer taboo in the majority of western societies, and the reverse became true.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} Some cultural groups continued to place a value on the moral purity of an abstainer, but abstinence was caught up in a wider reevaluation of [[moral values]].\n\nDuring the early 20th century, prominent [[feminist]] and [[birth control]] advocate [[Margaret Sanger]] argued that abstinence from sexual activity led to greater endurance and strength, and was a sign of the best of the species:\n\n: \"Though sex cells are placed in a part of the anatomy for the essential purpose of easily expelling them into the female for the purpose of reproduction, there are other elements in the sexual fluid which are the essence of blood, nerve, brain, and muscle. When redirected into the building and strengthening of these, we find men or women of the greatest endurance and greatest magnetic power. A girl can waste her creative powers by brooding over a love affair to the extent of exhausting her system, with the results not unlike the effects of masturbation and debauchery.\"<ref name=\"Sanger\">{{Citation | url = http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/webedition/app/documents/show.php?sangerDoc=304923.xml | title = What Every Girl Should Know: Sexual Impulses \u2014 Part II | first = Margaret | last = Sanger | date = 29 December 1912 | accessdate = 6 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[J. D. Unwin]] was a British ethnologist and social anthropologist at [[Oxford University]] and [[Cambridge University]]. Joseph Unwin wrote several books including ''Sex and Culture'',  (1934). In ''Sex and Culture'' Unwin studied 80 primitive tribes and 6 known civilizations through 5,000 years of history and found a positive correlation between the cultural achievement of a people and the amount of sexual restraint which they observed. The author finds that the most culturally successful groups always exhibit lifelong monogamous relationships which include sexual abstinence outside of marriage.<ref>\"Any human society is free to choose either to display great energy or to enjoy sexual freedom; the evidence is that it cannot do both for more than one generation.\" Unwin, J. D. (1934) ''Sex and Culture,'' p. 412.</ref> According to Unwin, after a nation becomes prosperous it becomes increasingly liberal with regard to sexual morality and as a result loses its cohesion, its impetus and its purpose, ultimately having a negative effect on society: \"The whole of human history does not contain a single instance of a group becoming civilized unless it has been absolutely monogamous, nor is there any example of a group retaining its culture after it has adopted less rigorous customs.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Unwin | first1 = J.

Celibacy is required for some religious orders like [[Jainism]].]]\nLifelong (or at least long-term) abstinence, often associated with philosophical or religious [[asceticism]], is distinguished from chastity before marriage. Abstinence is often viewed as an act of self-control over the natural desire to have sex. The display of the strength of character allows the abstainer to set an example for those not able to contain their \"base urges\". At other times, abstinence has been seen as a great social skill practiced by those who refuse to engage with the material and physical world. Some groups and teachers that propose sexual abstinence consider it an essential means to reach a particular intellectual or spiritual condition, or that chastity allows one to achieve a required self-control or self-consciousness.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=979394 SSRN-The Hermeneutics of Sexual Order by L. Khan<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n<!--Sexual abstinence is required for some religious orders, such as [[Catholic]] priests, nuns, monks. Although many individuals abstain from sex for reasons such as religion or morality, some individuals may simply have a dislike of sex ([[antisexualism]]), or are simply not interested in it ([[asexuality]]). They may view sexual activity as an unnecessary part of human life. As with other lifestyle choices, this attitude toward sexual activity and relationships can vary. Some who choose such a [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] still accept sexual activity for [[reproduction]], some engage in romantic [[intimate relationship|relationship]]s, and some engage in [[masturbation]]. This is a long paragraph and needs refs to make it relevant -->\n\n==Abstinence in religions==\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2017}}\nSome religions regard [[chastity]] as a [[virtue]] expected of faithful adherents. This usually includes abstinence from sex for the unmarried, and fidelity to a [[marriage]] partner.\n\nIn some religions, some groups of people are expected to remain unmarried and to abstain from sex completely. These groups include [[monk]]s, [[nun]]s, and [[priest]]s in various sects of Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Christianity. Chastity is required of the respective [[clergy|sacerdotal]] orders. The [[Shakers]], on the other hand, impose chastity in the form of celibacy for all members, even forgoing procreation such as the case with the [[castration cult]].\n\n===Christianity===\n{{quote box\n| width = 31%\n| align = right\n| quote=\"But because of sexual sins, each man is to have his own wife, and each woman is to have her own husband.\"\n| source = \u2014 1 Corinthians 7:2, [[Evangelical Heritage Version|EHV]]<ref>{{cite web |title=1 Corinthians 7:2 Evangelical Heritage Version (EHV) |url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+7%3A2&version=EHV}}</ref>\n}}\n\n{{quote box\n| width = 31%\n| align = right\n| quote=\"Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral.\"\n| source = \u2014 Hebrews 13:4, [[New International Version|NIV]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Hebrews 13:4 New International Version (NIV) |url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+13%3A4&version=NIV}}</ref>\n}}\nMost Christians teach that sexual intercourse should occur exclusively within marriage, and that sexual abstinence is the norm outside of that.

In males, the semen ([[V\u012brya]]) is considered sacred, and its preservation (except when used for procreation) and conversion into higher life-energy (Ojas) is considered essential for the development of enhanced intellectual and [[spirituality|spiritual]] capacities.\n\nThe blending of sexual and spiritual is portrayed in Hindu iconography, as seen in ubiquitous phallic and vaginal iconography in Hindu temples and for instance in the Kharjuraho and Konarak medieval temples, where thousands of couples having sex in endless positions, and with the gods, are carved in deep [[bas-relief]].  However, these depictions of sex are not generally understood to be a license for free sexual practices, but are instead meant to celebrate procreation as an integral part of existence in the universe.  In actual practice, there is a strong societal taboo against pre-marital sex for both males and females, which still exists today in Hindu cultures.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n===Islam===\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2017}}\nIslam forbids [[zina|intercourse outside of marriage]] (''zina''). However, maintaining celibacy as an act of piety is not recognized, while marriage for all who are able is strongly encouraged. Abstinence is practiced during the time of a woman's [[menstruation]]. Abstinence from sexual intercourse is also practiced from dawn to dusk during days where fasting is observed. Also in the time of Hajj people are not allowed to have sexual relationships, because their body has to stay pure while performing pilgrimage.\n\n===Jainism===\n{{Main|Brahmacharya#Brahmacharya in Jainism}}\n[[File:In-jain.svg|alt=Jain Flag Photo|thumb|Green colour in the [[Jain flag]] stands for ''brahmacharya''{{sfn|Vijay K.

For those Jains who adopt the path of monks, celibacy in action, words and thoughts is expected. For lay Jains who are married, the virtue of ''brahmacharya'' requires remaining sexually faithful to one's chosen partner ([[fidelity]]). For lay Jains who are unmarried, chaste living requires Jains to avoid sex before marriage.<ref>{{citation |title=Brahmacarya |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/jainism/living/brahmacarya.shtml |publisher=[[BBC]] }}</ref>\n\nIn the Jain monastic tradition, ''brahmacharya'' implies, among other things, the mandatory renunciation of sex and marriage. For a lay Jain, it represents a virtuous lifestyle devoid of constant sexual urges, that also includes simple living, meditation and other behaviors.\n\n===Judaism===\n{{further|Abstinence in Judaism}}\n[[Judaism]] forbids intercourse outside marriage (which is termed ''znut'' or promiscuity), but has no ideal of chastity. Within marriage abstinence is also required during and following a woman's menstruation. The husband is not allowed to deprive sex from his wife, even if she is not fertile (known as ''mitzvat onah'').\n\n==Associated practices==\n{{Further|Silver Ring Thing}}\nAmong some groups of people, the wearing of a [[purity ring]] is a reminder to oneself and others, that they are practicing sexual abstinence.<ref name=\"O'Brien2009\">{{cite book|last=O'Brien|first=Jodi|title=Encyclopedia of Gender and Society|year=2009|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781412909167|page=155|quote=In this subset of abstinence-only education programs, young people vow chastity until marriage and wear a \"purity ring\" to demonstrate a commitment to sexual abstinence.}}</ref> In order to aid their sobriety, some sexual abstinents partake in the usage of [[anaphrodisiac]]s.<ref>Byers, John Andrew.

At the onset of the Second World War, the Fleet Air Arm consisted of 20 squadrons with only 232 frontline aircraft, and 191 additional trainers. By the end of the war the strength of the Fleet Air Arm was 59 aircraft carriers, 3,700 aircraft, 72,000 officers and men and 56 Naval air stations.\n\nDuring the war, the FAA operated fighters, torpedo bombers and reconnaissance aircraft. Following the [[Dunkirk evacuation]] and the commencement of the [[Battle of Britain]], the [[Royal Air Force]] soon found itself critically short of fighter pilots. In the summer of 1940, the RAF had just over 800 fighter pilots and as personnel shortages worsened; the RAF turned to the Admiralty to ask for help from the Fleet Air Arm. Fleet Air Arm crews under [[RAF Fighter Command]] were either seconded individually to RAF fighter squadrons or entire as with 804 and 808 Naval Air Squadrons. The former provided dockyard defence during the Battle of Britain with [[Gloster Gladiator|Sea Gladiators]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fleetairarmarchive.net/RollofHonour/Battlehonour_crewlists/BattleofBritain_FAAaircrew_1940.html |title=Fleet Air Arm squadrons taking part in the Battle of Britain under RAF Fighter Command |work=Fleet Air Arm Archive 1939-1945 |accessdate=8 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150625093132/http://www.fleetairarmarchive.net/RollofHonour/Battlehonour_crewlists/BattleofBritain_FAAaircrew_1940.html |archive-date=25 June 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn British home waters and out into the [[Atlantic Ocean]], operations against Axis shipping and submarines in support of the RN were mounted by [[RAF Coastal Command]] with large patrol bombers, flying boats and land-based fighter-bombers. The [[aircraft carrier]] had replaced the [[battleship]] as the [[capital ship]] of the RN and its aircraft were now its principal offensive weapons. The top scoring [[Flying ace|fighter ace]] with 17 victories was Commander [[Stanley Orr]], the [[Royal Marines|Royal Marine]] ace was [[Ronald Cuthbert Hay]] with 13 victories. A number of Royal Marines were [[History of the Royal Marines#Second World War|FAA pilots]] during the war.\n\nNotable Fleet Air Arm operations during the war included the [[Battle of Taranto]], the sinking of the [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']], [[Operation Tungsten]] against the [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']] and [[Operation Meridian]] against oil plants in [[Sumatra]].\n\n===Post-war history===\n[[File:SeaFury launch.jpg|thumb|right|Hawker Sea Fury of No. 804 Squadron launched off {{HMS|Glory|R62|6}} during the Korean War, June 1951]]\n[[File:Phantom FG1 892 Sqn on HMS Ark Royal (R09) 1972.jpg|thumb|right|Phantom FG.1 of 892 NAS aboard {{HMS|Ark Royal|R09|6}} in 1972]]\n[[File:DN-SC-87-05770.JPEG|thumb|right|Two [[British Aerospace Sea Harrier|Sea Harriers]] from [[800 Naval Air Squadron]] approach the flight deck of [[U.S. Navy]] aircraft carrier {{USS|Dwight D. Eisenhower||6}} in 1984]]\nAfter the war the FAA needed to fly [[jet aircraft]] from their carriers. The jet aircraft of the era were considerably less effective at low speeds than propeller aircraft, but propeller aircraft could not effectively fight jets at the high speeds flown by jet aircraft. The FAA took on its first jet, the [[De Havilland Vampire|Sea Vampire]], in the late 1940s. The Sea Vampire was the first jet credited with taking off and landing on a carrier. The Air Arm continued with high-powered prop aircraft alongside the new jets resulting in the FAA being woefully outpowered during the [[Korean War]]. Nevertheless, jets were not yet wholly superior to propeller aircraft and a flight of ground attack [[Hawker Sea Fury|Hawker Sea Furies]] downed a [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] and damaged others in an engagement.\n\nAs jets became larger, more powerful and faster they required more space to take off and land. The [[US Navy]] simply built much larger carriers. The Royal Navy had a few large carriers built and completed after the end of the war but another solution was sought. This was partly overcome by the introduction of a Royal Navy idea to [[flight deck#Angled flight deck|angle the flight deck]] away from the centre line so that the aircraft landing had a clear run away from the usual forward deck park. An associated British invention, intended to provide more precise optical guidance to aircraft on final approaching the deck, was the [[Optical Landing System#Fresnel Lens Optical Landing System (FLOLS)|Fresnel lens optical landing aid]]. Another Royal Navy invention was the use of a [[steam catapult|steam-powered catapult]] to cater for the larger and heavier aircraft (both systems were adopted by the US Navy).\n\nDefence cuts across the British armed forces [[1966 Defence White Paper|during the 1960s and 1970s]] led to the withdrawal of existing Royal Navy aircraft carriers, transfer of Fleet Air Arm fixed-wing jet strike aircraft such as the [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4K (FG.1) Phantom II]] and [[Blackburn Buccaneer|Buccaneer S.2]] to the Royal Air Force, and cancellation of large replacement aircraft carriers, including the [[CVA-01]] design. The last conventional carrier to be retired was {{HMS|Ark Royal|R09|6}} in 1978.<ref>Manning, p. 149</ref> Although HMS ''Hermes'' was converted in 1980/81 to a STOVL carrier to operate Sea Harriers, a ramp was fitted to aid take-off. A new series of small carriers, the [[Invincible class aircraft carrier|''Invincible'' class]] anti-submarine warfare ships (known as \"through deck cruisers\") were built and equipped with the [[BAE Sea Harrier|Sea Harrier]] a derivative of the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier]] [[VTOL]] aircraft. These carriers incorporated an upswept forward section of the flight deck that deflected the aircraft upward on launch and permitted heavier loads to be carried by the Harrier, for example in weaponry, and the system was used extensively in the Falklands War, with both ''Hermes'' and ''Invincible'' part of the Task Force.\nAt the end of the [[Cold War]] in 1989 the Fleet Air Arm was under the command of the [[Flag Officer Naval Air Command]], a [[Rear admiral (Royal Navy)|rear admiral]] based at [[RNAS Yeovilton]].\n* '''[[Flag Officer Naval Air Command]]''' (FONAC), at [[RNAS Yeovilton]]\n** '''[[RNAS Prestwick]]''':\n*** [[819 Naval Air Squadron]], ([[Anti-submarine warfare|Anti-submarine]], 12\u00d7 [[Westland Sea King|Sea King HAS.5]])\n*** [[826 Naval Air Squadron]], (Anti-submarine, 12\u00d7 Sea King HAS.6)\n*** [[HMS Gannet SAR Flight]], ([[Search and Rescue|Search & Rescue]], 8\u00d7 [[Westland Sea King|Sea King HU.5]])\n** '''[[RNAS Yeovilton]]''':\n*** [[707 Naval Air Squadron]], ([[Air Assault]], 10\u00d7 [[Westland Sea King|Sea King HC.4]])\n*** [[800 Naval Air Squadron]], (12\u00d7 [[British Aerospace Sea Harrier|Sea Harrier FA.2]])\n*** [[801 Naval Air Squadron]], (12\u00d7 Sea Harrier FA.2)\n*** [[845 Naval Air Squadron]], (Air Assault, 10\u00d7 Sea King HC.4)\n*** [[846 Naval Air Squadron]], (Air Assault, 10\u00d7 Sea King HC.4)\n*** [[899 Naval Air Squadron]], (Training, 24\u00d7 Sea Harrier FA.2)\n*** [[Fleet Requirements and Aircraft Direction Unit]], (Aggressor Squadron, [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra TT.18]], [[Hawker Hunter|Hawker Hunter GA.11]])\n** '''[[RNAS Culdrose (HMS Seahawk)|RNAS Culdrose]]''':\n*** [[705 Naval Air Squadron]], (Basic Helicopter Training, 38\u00d7 [[A\u00e9rospatiale Gazelle|Gazelle HT.2]])\n*** [[706 Naval Air Squadron]], (Sea King Training, 12\u00d7 various types of Sea King)\n*** [[750 Naval Air Squadron]], (Observer Training, [[Handley Page Jetstream|Jetstream T2]])\n*** [[771 Naval Air Squadron]], (Search & Rescue, 12\u00d7 [[Westland Sea King|Sea King HU.5]])\n*** [[814 Naval Air Squadron]], (Anti-submarine, 12\u00d7 Sea King HAS.5)\n*** [[820 Naval Air Squadron]], (Anti-submarine, 12\u00d7 Sea King HAS.6)\n*** [[824 Naval Air Squadron]], (Anti-submarine, 12\u00d7 Sea King HAS.6) (disbanded August 1989)\n*** [[849 Naval Air Squadron]], ([[Airborne early warning and control]], 10\u00d7 Sea King AEW.2A, 4\u00d7 Sea King AEW.5)\n** '''[[RNAS Portland (HMS Osprey)|RNAS Portland]]''':\n*** [[702 Naval Air Squadron]], (Aircrew & Maintenance Training, 24\u00d7 [[Westland Lynx|Lynx HAS.3S]])\n*** [[772 Naval Air Squadron]], (Air Assault, 10\u00d7 Sea King HC.4)\n*** [[810 Naval Air Squadron]], (Anti-submarine, 12\u00d7 Sea King HAS.6)\n*** [[815 Naval Air Squadron]], (Frigate & Destroyer Helicopters, 32\u00d7 Lynx HAS.3S, most deployed on frigates and destroyers at sea)\n*** [[829 Naval Air Squadron]], (Frigate & Destroyer Helicopters, 32\u00d7 Lynx HAS.3S, most deployed on frigates and destroyers at sea)\n\n==== Fleet Air Arm Inventory 1989 ====\nThe inventory of the Fleet Air Arm in 1989 consisted of the following aircraft:<ref name=\"World's Air Forces 1989\">{{cite journal|title=World's Air Forces 1989|journal=Flight International|date=29 November 1989|pages=61\u201362|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1989/1989%20-%203700.html|accessdate=19 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201034011/https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1989/1989%20-%203700.html|archive-date=1 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* '''Combat aircraft''':\n** 42\u00d7 [[British Aerospace Sea Harrier|Sea Harrier FRS.1/F(A).2]]\n** 2x/2\u00d7 [[British Aerospace Sea Harrier|Sea Harrier T.4A/T.4N]]\n* '''Helicopters''':\n** 60+ [[Westland Sea King|Sea King HAS.5]]\n** 31+ [[Westland Sea King|Sea King HAS.6]]\n** 10\u00d7 [[Westland Sea King|Sea King AEW.2A]]\n** 33\u00d7 [[Westland Sea King|Sea King HC.4]]\n** 80+ [[Westland Lynx|Lynx HAS.3S]]\n** 23\u00d7/8\u00d7 [[A\u00e9rospatiale Gazelle|Gazelle HT.2/HT.3]]\n* '''Trainers''':\n** 3\u00d7 [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra TT.18]]\n** 14\u00d7 [[de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk|Chipmunk T.10]]\n** 5\u00d7 [[Hawker Hunter|Hunter T.8M]]\n** 12\u00d7/9\u00d7 [[Hawker Hunter|Hunter GA.11/T8]]\n** 19\u00d7 [[Handley Page Jetstream|Jetstream T.2]]\n* '''Liaison''':\n** 16\u00d7 [[Dassault Falcon 20]] (Civil-registered)\n\n===Post Cold War===\n[[File:Four FA2 Sea Harriers, based at RNAS Yeovilton, flying in formation above the clouds, photographed as part of a Photex.

However, the introduction of the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|F-35B Lightning II]] will see a restoration of fixed wing, front-line operations. An initial order of 48 airframes was made in 2012 to equip the air wings of the planned two [[Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier]]s, with the operation split between the FAA and the [[Royal Air Force]], as was the case with [[Joint Force Harrier]]. [[809 Naval Air Squadron]] was announced as the second UK unit to fly the F-35B, the first being [[No. 617 Squadron RAF|617 Squadron RAF]], and will be the first Fleet Air Arm unit to operate the aircraft. It is understood that at least two further frontline squadrons will stand up in the future alongside 809, 617, [[No. 17 Squadron RAF|17(R) Test and Evaluation Squadron]] and an RAF-numbered Operational Conversion Unit, creating a front-line fleet of four squadrons in addition to the OCU and OEU. Under the Strategic Defence and Security Review of November 2015, the UK Government made a commitment to buying 138 F-35B, with at least 24 available for carrier use by 2023.<ref>{{cite news|title=Osborne: UK to speed up aircraft carrier jet purchase|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34893614|accessdate=22 November 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=22 November 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"SDSR2015\">{{cite web|title=National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/478933/52309_Cm_9161_NSS_SD_Review_web_only.pdf|website=gov.uk|publisher=HM Government|accessdate=26 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124082813/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/478933/52309_Cm_9161_NSS_SD_Review_web_only.pdf|archive-date=24 November 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> \n\nOn 10 January 2019, initial operating capability for the UK's F-35B was announced<ref>{{cite news|title=UK declares IOC Land for F-35 force|url=https://www.janes.com/article/85642/uk-declares-ioc-land-for-f-35-force|accessdate=11 January 2019|publisher=IHS Janes|date=11 January 2019}}</ref> with 18 F-35B\u2019s jointly delivered to the UK<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://airforcesmonthly.keypublishing.com/2019/05/21/lightning-to-cyprus-first-deployment-for-uk-f-35b/|title=https://airforcesmonthly.keypublishing.com/2019/05/21/lightning-to-cyprus-first-deployment-for-uk-f-35b/|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. 15 are currently based in the UK<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2018-08-04/further-five-f-35-fighter-jets-land-at-new-raf-marham-home/|title=https://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2018-08-04/further-five-f-35-fighter-jets-land-at-new-raf-marham-home/|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> with 3 remaining in the US for training purposes.\n\n====Crowsnest====\nThere is a project to replace the Sea King ASaC7 in the [[Airborne early warning and control|Airborne Surveillance and Control]] (ASaC) mission.

Exceptions to the 700\u2013799 include operational conversion squadrons which also hold some form of operational commitment where they are then titled 800\u2013899.

By the end of the war the strength of the Fleet Air Arm was 59 aircraft carriers, 3,700 aircraft, 72,000 officers and men and 56 Naval air stations.\n\nDuring the war, the FAA operated fighters, torpedo bombers and reconnaissance aircraft. Following the [[Dunkirk evacuation]] and the commencement of the [[Battle of Britain]], the [[Royal Air Force]] soon found itself critically short of fighter pilots. In the summer of 1940, the RAF had just over 800 fighter pilots and as personnel shortages worsened; the RAF turned to the Admiralty to ask for help from the Fleet Air Arm. Fleet Air Arm crews under [[RAF Fighter Command]] were either seconded individually to RAF fighter squadrons or entire as with 804 and 808 Naval Air Squadrons. The former provided dockyard defence during the Battle of Britain with [[Gloster Gladiator|Sea Gladiators]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fleetairarmarchive.net/RollofHonour/Battlehonour_crewlists/BattleofBritain_FAAaircrew_1940.html |title=Fleet Air Arm squadrons taking part in the Battle of Britain under RAF Fighter Command |work=Fleet Air Arm Archive 1939-1945 |accessdate=8 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150625093132/http://www.fleetairarmarchive.net/RollofHonour/Battlehonour_crewlists/BattleofBritain_FAAaircrew_1940.html |archive-date=25 June 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn British home waters and out into the [[Atlantic Ocean]], operations against Axis shipping and submarines in support of the RN were mounted by [[RAF Coastal Command]] with large patrol bombers, flying boats and land-based fighter-bombers. The [[aircraft carrier]] had replaced the [[battleship]] as the [[capital ship]] of the RN and its aircraft were now its principal offensive weapons. The top scoring [[Flying ace|fighter ace]] with 17 victories was Commander [[Stanley Orr]], the [[Royal Marines|Royal Marine]] ace was [[Ronald Cuthbert Hay]] with 13 victories. A number of Royal Marines were [[History of the Royal Marines#Second World War|FAA pilots]] during the war.\n\nNotable Fleet Air Arm operations during the war included the [[Battle of Taranto]], the sinking of the [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']], [[Operation Tungsten]] against the [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']] and [[Operation Meridian]] against oil plants in [[Sumatra]].\n\n===Post-war history===\n[[File:SeaFury launch.jpg|thumb|right|Hawker Sea Fury of No. 804 Squadron launched off {{HMS|Glory|R62|6}} during the Korean War, June 1951]]\n[[File:Phantom FG1 892 Sqn on HMS Ark Royal (R09) 1972.jpg|thumb|right|Phantom FG.1 of 892 NAS aboard {{HMS|Ark Royal|R09|6}} in 1972]]\n[[File:DN-SC-87-05770.JPEG|thumb|right|Two [[British Aerospace Sea Harrier|Sea Harriers]] from [[800 Naval Air Squadron]] approach the flight deck of [[U.S. Navy]] aircraft carrier {{USS|Dwight D. Eisenhower||6}} in 1984]]\nAfter the war the FAA needed to fly [[jet aircraft]] from their carriers. The jet aircraft of the era were considerably less effective at low speeds than propeller aircraft, but propeller aircraft could not effectively fight jets at the high speeds flown by jet aircraft. The FAA took on its first jet, the [[De Havilland Vampire|Sea Vampire]], in the late 1940s. The Sea Vampire was the first jet credited with taking off and landing on a carrier. The Air Arm continued with high-powered prop aircraft alongside the new jets resulting in the FAA being woefully outpowered during the [[Korean War]]. Nevertheless, jets were not yet wholly superior to propeller aircraft and a flight of ground attack [[Hawker Sea Fury|Hawker Sea Furies]] downed a [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] and damaged others in an engagement.\n\nAs jets became larger, more powerful and faster they required more space to take off and land. The [[US Navy]] simply built much larger carriers. The Royal Navy had a few large carriers built and completed after the end of the war but another solution was sought. This was partly overcome by the introduction of a Royal Navy idea to [[flight deck#Angled flight deck|angle the flight deck]] away from the centre line so that the aircraft landing had a clear run away from the usual forward deck park. An associated British invention, intended to provide more precise optical guidance to aircraft on final approaching the deck, was the [[Optical Landing System#Fresnel Lens Optical Landing System (FLOLS)|Fresnel lens optical landing aid]]. Another Royal Navy invention was the use of a [[steam catapult|steam-powered catapult]] to cater for the larger and heavier aircraft (both systems were adopted by the US Navy).\n\nDefence cuts across the British armed forces [[1966 Defence White Paper|during the 1960s and 1970s]] led to the withdrawal of existing Royal Navy aircraft carriers, transfer of Fleet Air Arm fixed-wing jet strike aircraft such as the [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4K (FG.1) Phantom II]] and [[Blackburn Buccaneer|Buccaneer S.2]] to the Royal Air Force, and cancellation of large replacement aircraft carriers, including the [[CVA-01]] design. The last conventional carrier to be retired was {{HMS|Ark Royal|R09|6}} in 1978.<ref>Manning, p. 149</ref> Although HMS ''Hermes'' was converted in 1980/81 to a STOVL carrier to operate Sea Harriers, a ramp was fitted to aid take-off. A new series of small carriers, the [[Invincible class aircraft carrier|''Invincible'' class]] anti-submarine warfare ships (known as \"through deck cruisers\") were built and equipped with the [[BAE Sea Harrier|Sea Harrier]] a derivative of the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier]] [[VTOL]] aircraft. These carriers incorporated an upswept forward section of the flight deck that deflected the aircraft upward on launch and permitted heavier loads to be carried by the Harrier, for example in weaponry, and the system was used extensively in the Falklands War, with both ''Hermes'' and ''Invincible'' part of the Task Force.\nAt the end of the [[Cold War]] in 1989 the Fleet Air Arm was under the command of the [[Flag Officer Naval Air Command]], a [[Rear admiral (Royal Navy)|rear admiral]] based at [[RNAS Yeovilton]].\n* '''[[Flag Officer Naval Air Command]]''' (FONAC), at [[RNAS Yeovilton]]\n** '''[[RNAS Prestwick]]''':\n*** [[819 Naval Air Squadron]], ([[Anti-submarine warfare|Anti-submarine]], 12\u00d7 [[Westland Sea King|Sea King HAS.5]])\n*** [[826 Naval Air Squadron]], (Anti-submarine, 12\u00d7 Sea King HAS.6)\n*** [[HMS Gannet SAR Flight]], ([[Search and Rescue|Search & Rescue]], 8\u00d7 [[Westland Sea King|Sea King HU.5]])\n** '''[[RNAS Yeovilton]]''':\n*** [[707 Naval Air Squadron]], ([[Air Assault]], 10\u00d7 [[Westland Sea King|Sea King HC.4]])\n*** [[800 Naval Air Squadron]], (12\u00d7 [[British Aerospace Sea Harrier|Sea Harrier FA.2]])\n*** [[801 Naval Air Squadron]], (12\u00d7 Sea Harrier FA.2)\n*** [[845 Naval Air Squadron]], (Air Assault, 10\u00d7 Sea King HC.4)\n*** [[846 Naval Air Squadron]], (Air Assault, 10\u00d7 Sea King HC.4)\n*** [[899 Naval Air Squadron]], (Training, 24\u00d7 Sea Harrier FA.2)\n*** [[Fleet Requirements and Aircraft Direction Unit]], (Aggressor Squadron, [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra TT.18]], [[Hawker Hunter|Hawker Hunter GA.11]])\n** '''[[RNAS Culdrose (HMS Seahawk)|RNAS Culdrose]]''':\n*** [[705 Naval Air Squadron]], (Basic Helicopter Training, 38\u00d7 [[A\u00e9rospatiale Gazelle|Gazelle HT.2]])\n*** [[706 Naval Air Squadron]], (Sea King Training, 12\u00d7 various types of Sea King)\n*** [[750 Naval Air Squadron]], (Observer Training, [[Handley Page Jetstream|Jetstream T2]])\n*** [[771 Naval Air Squadron]], (Search & Rescue, 12\u00d7 [[Westland Sea King|Sea King HU.5]])\n*** [[814 Naval Air Squadron]], (Anti-submarine, 12\u00d7 Sea King HAS.5)\n*** [[820 Naval Air Squadron]], (Anti-submarine, 12\u00d7 Sea King HAS.6)\n*** [[824 Naval Air Squadron]], (Anti-submarine, 12\u00d7 Sea King HAS.6) (disbanded August 1989)\n*** [[849 Naval Air Squadron]], ([[Airborne early warning and control]], 10\u00d7 Sea King AEW.2A, 4\u00d7 Sea King AEW.5)\n** '''[[RNAS Portland (HMS Osprey)|RNAS Portland]]''':\n*** [[702 Naval Air Squadron]], (Aircrew & Maintenance Training, 24\u00d7 [[Westland Lynx|Lynx HAS.3S]])\n*** [[772 Naval Air Squadron]], (Air Assault, 10\u00d7 Sea King HC.4)\n*** [[810 Naval Air Squadron]], (Anti-submarine, 12\u00d7 Sea King HAS.6)\n*** [[815 Naval Air Squadron]], (Frigate & Destroyer Helicopters, 32\u00d7 Lynx HAS.3S, most deployed on frigates and destroyers at sea)\n*** [[829 Naval Air Squadron]], (Frigate & Destroyer Helicopters, 32\u00d7 Lynx HAS.3S, most deployed on frigates and destroyers at sea)\n\n==== Fleet Air Arm Inventory 1989 ====\nThe inventory of the Fleet Air Arm in 1989 consisted of the following aircraft:<ref name=\"World's Air Forces 1989\">{{cite journal|title=World's Air Forces 1989|journal=Flight International|date=29 November 1989|pages=61\u201362|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1989/1989%20-%203700.html|accessdate=19 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201034011/https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1989/1989%20-%203700.html|archive-date=1 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* '''Combat aircraft''':\n** 42\u00d7 [[British Aerospace Sea Harrier|Sea Harrier FRS.1/F(A).2]]\n** 2x/2\u00d7 [[British Aerospace Sea Harrier|Sea Harrier T.4A/T.4N]]\n* '''Helicopters''':\n** 60+ [[Westland Sea King|Sea King HAS.5]]\n** 31+ [[Westland Sea King|Sea King HAS.6]]\n** 10\u00d7 [[Westland Sea King|Sea King AEW.2A]]\n** 33\u00d7 [[Westland Sea King|Sea King HC.4]]\n** 80+ [[Westland Lynx|Lynx HAS.3S]]\n** 23\u00d7/8\u00d7 [[A\u00e9rospatiale Gazelle|Gazelle HT.2/HT.3]]\n* '''Trainers''':\n** 3\u00d7 [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra TT.18]]\n** 14\u00d7 [[de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk|Chipmunk T.10]]\n** 5\u00d7 [[Hawker Hunter|Hunter T.8M]]\n** 12\u00d7/9\u00d7 [[Hawker Hunter|Hunter GA.11/T8]]\n** 19\u00d7 [[Handley Page Jetstream|Jetstream T.2]]\n* '''Liaison''':\n** 16\u00d7 [[Dassault Falcon 20]] (Civil-registered)\n\n===Post Cold War===\n[[File:Four FA2 Sea Harriers, based at RNAS Yeovilton, flying in formation above the clouds, photographed as part of a Photex.

It is understood that at least two further frontline squadrons will stand up in the future alongside 809, 617, 17(R) Test and Evaluation Squadron and an RAF-numbered Operational Conversion Unit, creating a front-line fleet of four squadrons in addition to the OCU and OEU. Under the Strategic Defence and Security Review of November 2015, the UK Government made a commitment to buying 138 F-35B, with at least 24 available for carrier use by 2023.<ref>{{cite news|title=Osborne: UK to speed up aircraft carrier jet purchase|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34893614|accessdate=22 November 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=22 November 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"SDSR2015\">{{cite web|title=National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/478933/52309_Cm_9161_NSS_SD_Review_web_only.pdf|website=gov.uk|publisher=HM Government|accessdate=26 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124082813/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/478933/52309_Cm_9161_NSS_SD_Review_web_only.pdf|archive-date=24 November 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> On 10 January 2019, initial operating capability for the UK's F-35B was announced.<ref>{{cite news|title=UK declares IOC Land for F-35 force|url=https://www.janes.com/article/85642/uk-declares-ioc-land-for-f-35-force|accessdate=11 January 2019|publisher=IHS Janes|date=11 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Crowsnest====\nThere is a project to replace the Sea King ASaC7 in the [[Airborne early warning and control|Airborne Surveillance and Control]] (ASaC) mission.

Exceptions to the 700\u2013799 include operational conversion squadrons which also hold some form of operational commitment where they are then titled 800\u2013899.

The story also follows fellow gang member [[John Marston (Red Dead)|John Marston]], the protagonist of ''Red Dead Redemption''.\n\nThe game is presented through both [[First-person (gaming)|first]] and [[Third-person view|third-person]] perspectives, and the player may freely roam in its interactive [[open world]]. Gameplay elements include shootouts, heists, [[hunting]], horseback riding, interacting with [[non-player character]]s, and maintaining the character's honor rating through moral choices and deeds. A bounty system similar to the \"wanted\" system from the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' franchise governs the response of law enforcement and bounty hunters to crimes committed by the player. ''Red Dead Redemption 2'' was released for the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] in October 2018, and for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Google Stadia|Stadia]] in November 2019. ''[[Red Dead Online]]'', the [[Multiplayer video game|online multiplayer]] mode of the game, was released as a [[Beta test|beta]] version in November 2018 before a full release in May 2019.\n\n[[Development of Red Dead Redemption 2|The game's development]] began soon after ''Red Dead Redemption''{{'}}s release and was shared between all of Rockstar's studios worldwide. The development team drew influence from real locations as opposed to film or art, focused on creating an accurate reflection of the time with [[List of Red Dead Redemption 2 characters|the game's characters]] and world. The game was Rockstar's first built specifically for [[Eighth generation of video game consoles|eighth generation consoles]], having tested their technical capabilities while porting ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' to the platforms. [[Music of Red Dead Redemption 2|The game's soundtrack]] features an original score composed by [[Woody Jackson (composer)|Woody Jackson]] and several vocal tracks produced by [[Daniel Lanois]].\n\nBroadly anticipated and marketed before release, ''Red Dead Redemption 2'' broke several records and had the second-biggest launch in the history of entertainment, generating $725 million in sales from its opening weekend and exceeding the lifetime sales of ''Red Dead Redemption'' in two weeks. It received widespread critical acclaim, with praise directed at its story, characters, open world, graphics, and considerable level of detail. Minor criticism was given to the game's control scheme and mission structure. Considered as an example of [[video games as an art form]], it [[List of accolades received by Red Dead Redemption 2|won year-end accolades]] including [[Game of the Year]] awards from several [[Video game journalism|gaming publications]]. It is among the [[List of best-selling video games|best-selling video games of all time]] with over 29 million copies shipped.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Red Dead Redemption 2 gameplay.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|left|The player may choose to respond positively or negatively to non-playable characters throughout the game world, which affects their reputation within the game.]]\n\n''Red Dead Redemption 2'' is a [[Western (genre)|Western]]-themed [[action-adventure game]]. Played from a [[First-person (gaming)|first]] or [[Third-person view|third-person]] perspective, the game is set in an [[open-world]] environment featuring a fictionalized version of the [[Western United States|Western]], [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] and [[Southern United States]] in 1899, during the latter half of the [[Wild West]] era and the [[turn of the century|turn]] of the [[twentieth century]].<ref name=\"TechRadar Gameplay\"/> The game features both single-player and online multiplayer components, the latter released under ''[[Red Dead Online]]''. For most of the game, the player controls outlaw [[Arthur Morgan (Red Dead)|Arthur Morgan]], a member of the Van der Linde gang, as he completes numerous missions\u2014linear scenarios with set objectives\u2014to progress through the story; from the game's epilogue, the player controls [[John Marston (Red Dead)|John Marston]]. Outside of missions, the player may [[Nonlinear gameplay|freely roam]] its interactive world. The player may engage in combat with enemies using [[Melee (gaming)|melee]] attacks, firearms, throwables, or explosives. Combat has been refined from the game's predecessor, and notable new mechanics consist of [[dual wield|dual-wielding]] and the ability to use a bow.<ref name=\"USGamer Dual Wield\"/><ref name=\"Polygon Bows\"/> Unlike the previous game, the player is granted the ability to swim.<ref name=\"GameSpot Swim\"/>\n\n''Red Dead Redemption 2''{{'}}s unexploited land makes up the largest portion of the game world and features diverse landscapes with occasional travelers, bandits, and wildlife. There are urban settlements in the game, ranging from farmhouses to towns and cities.<ref name=\"VG247 Walkthroughs\"/><ref name=\"USgamer Map\"/> Horses are the main forms of transportation, of which there are various breeds, each with different attributes. The player must either train or tame a wild horse to use it, except for stolen horses; however, they must saddle a horse to acquire ownership over it. Increased use of a horse will begin a bonding process, which can be increased by cleaning and feeding it, and the player will acquire advantages as they ride their horse.<ref name=\"EGM Review\"/> Stagecoaches and trains can also be used to travel. The player can hijack an incoming train or stagecoach by threatening the driver or passengers and then rob its contents or the passengers.<ref name=\"Game Revolution Rob\"/><ref name=\"DT Fast Travel\"/>\n\nThe player may also witness or take part in random events encountered from exploring the game world. These include ambushes, crimes committed by other people, pleas for assistance, ride-by shootings, public executions, and animal attacks. For example, as the player explores the Wild West, they can find specific people in distress. If the player decides to help them, they will be thankful and may reward the player if they cross them again.<ref name=\"EGM Review\"/><ref name=\"GamesRadar Review\"/> The player may also take part in side-activities, which include small tasks with companions and strangers, dueling, bounty hunting, searching for treasure or other collectibles around the map such as rock carvings, and playing [[poker]], [[blackjack]], [[dominoes]], and [[Knife game|Five Finger Filet]].<ref name=\"Red Bull Minigames\"/> Hunting animals also plays a major role in the game, providing food, income, and materials for crafting items. When hunting, the player needs to take into account several factors, including the choice of weapon and shot placement, which affect the quality of the meat and pelt and subsequently the price traders are willing to pay. The player can either skin the animal immediately or carry the carcass, which will rot over time and decrease its value and attract predators.<ref name=\"IGN Hunting\"/><ref name=\"DT Hunting\"/>\n\nThe game focuses heavily on player choice for the story and missions. Certain moments in the story will give the player the option to accept or decline additional missions and lightly shape the plot around their choices.<ref name=\"IGN First Look\"/> The player can communicate with any [[non-player character]] (NPC) in dynamic ways new to the series. The player can choose different dialogue trees with NPCs, such as having a friendly chat or insulting them. If the player chooses to kill an NPC, they can loot their corpse.<ref name=\"Polygon Money\"/> ''Red Dead Redemption 2'' brings back the Honor system from its predecessor by measuring how the player's actions are perceived in terms of morality. Morally positive choices and deeds like helping strangers, abiding the law, and sparing opponents in a duel will add up to the player's Honor. However, negative deeds such as theft and harming innocents will subtract from the player's Honor. The story is influenced by Honor, as the dialogue and outcomes for the player often differ based on their Honor level. Hitting milestones for the player's Honor level will grant unique benefits, such as rewarding the player with special outfits and large discounts in stores. A low Honor level is also beneficial, as the player will receive a greater number of items from looted corpses.<ref name=\"USGamer Honor\"/>\n\n[[File:Red Dead Redemption 2 Dead Eye gameplay.gif|thumb|upright=1.5|right|''Red Dead Redemption 2''{{'}}s [[Bullet time|Dead Eye]] targeting system allows the player to slow down time and mark targets. Once the targeting sequence ends, the player fires to every marked location in a very short space of time.]]\n\nMaintaining Arthur and John is important, as they can undergo conditions that affect their health and stamina attributes. In addition to a health and stamina bar, the player also has cores, which affect the rate at which their health and stamina regenerate. For example, wearing warmer clothes will mean they avoid freezing in a cold environment, but wearing them in a hot environment will result in perspiration. Freezing or overheating will rapidly drain cores. The player can also gain or lose weight depending on how much he eats; an underweight character will have less health but at an increase of stamina, while an overweight character will be able to better absorb damage but will have less stamina. The player can eat and sleep to replenish their cores. The player can bathe to remain clean, and can visit a barber to change hairstyles; hair also grows realistically over time. The game features weapon degradation, with weapons requiring cleaning to maintain their performance. When the player uses a certain type of gun for a long period of time, they become more experienced with it, which improves weapon handling, reduces recoil, and increases the rate of reloading.<ref name=\"Game Revolution Temperature\"/><ref name=\"Game Revolution Weapon\"/><ref name=\"GameSpot DNA\"/>\n\nGunfights are an essential mechanic in the game. The player can take cover, free aim, and target a person or animal. Individual body parts can also be targeted to take targets down without killing them. When the player shoots an enemy, the game's [[Artificial intelligence in video games|AI]] reactions and movements depend on where they were hit. Weapons consist of pistols, revolvers, repeaters, rifles, shotguns, bows, explosives, lassos, mounted [[Gatling gun]]s, and melee weapons such as knives and [[tomahawk]]s. ''Red Dead Redemption 2'' brings back the trademark mechanic in the franchise: Dead Eye, a targeting system that allows the player to slow down time and mark targets. Once the targeting sequence ends, the player fires to every marked location in a very short space of time. The Dead Eye system upgrades as the player progresses in the game and grants the player more abilities, such as being able to spot the fatal points of their enemies.<ref name=\"VG247 Dead Eye\"/><ref name=\"ShackNews Combat\"/>\n\nThe bounty system also returns from ''Red Dead Redemption'', a crime-governing mechanic inspired by ''Grand Theft Auto''{{'}}s wanted system. When a player commits a crime, witnesses run to the nearest police station to get the law to intervene, and the player needs to stop the witness to avoid repercussions. Once the law is alerted, law enforcers appear and will start investigating. When the player is caught, the Wanted meter appears with a bounty sent on their head. The bounty grows higher as the player commits more crimes, and more lawmen will be sent to hunt them. If the player has committed serious crimes and then manages to escape the law, bounty hunters will be hired to track them down in the wilderness. After committing enough crime, the [[United States Marshals Service|U.S Marshals]] will be sent to the player's location. To escape law enforcement, the player must evade a red circular zone in the map and the wanted meter will slowly deplete. They can alternatively hide from the pursuers or kill them.<ref name=\"USgamer Review\"/> Whether the player escapes or gets captured, the bounty will remain on their head, lawmen and civilians will be more vigilant, and regions where the crimes have been committed will be on lockdown. When caught by lawmen, the player has the opportunity to surrender if they are unarmed and on foot, though bounty hunters will not accept surrender if the player is known to slip out of apprehension attempts. The player can only remove their bounty by paying it off at a post office.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Bounties\"/>\n\n== Synopsis ==\n=== Setting ===\nThe world of ''Red Dead Redemption 2'' spans five [[List of fictional states of the United States|fictitious U.S. state]]s. The states of New Hanover, Ambarino and Lemoyne are new to the series, and are located to the immediate north and east of ''Red Dead Redemption''{{'}}s world, whilst the states of New Austin and West Elizabeth return from ''Red Dead Redemption''.{{efn|The Mexican state of Nuevo Paraiso, which featured in ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'', is not a part of the new game world.<ref name=\"Shacknews Map\"/>}} The states are centered on the San Luis and Lannahechee Rivers and the shores of Flat Iron Lake. Ambarino is a mountain wilderness, with the largest settlement being a Native American reservation; New Hanover is a wide valley that has become a hub of industry and is home to the cattle town of Valentine; and Lemoyne is composed of [[bayou]]s and plantations resembling Louisiana, and is home to the Southern town of Rhodes and the former French colony of Saint Denis, analogous to [[New Orleans]].<ref name=\"Shacknews Map\"/> West Elizabeth consists of wide plains, dense forests, and the modern town of Blackwater.<ref name=\"USgamer Map\"/> This region has been expanded from the original ''Red Dead Redemption'' to include a vast northern portion containing the small town of Strawberry.<ref name=\"Gry Online Map\"/> New Austin is an arid desert region centered on the frontier towns of Armadillo and Tumbleweed, also featured in the original game. Parts of New Austin and West Elizabeth have been redesigned to reflect the earlier time; for example, Blackwater is still under development, while Armadillo has become a ghost town because of a cholera outbreak.<ref name=\"Forbes Map\"/>\n\n=== Characters ===\n{{Main|List of Red Dead Redemption 2 characters}}\nThe player takes on the role of Arthur Morgan ([[Roger Clark (actor, born 1978)|Roger Clark]]), a lieutenant and veteran member of the Van der Linde gang. The gang is led by Dutch van der Linde ([[Benjamin Byron Davis]]), a charismatic man who extols personal freedom and decries the encroaching march of modern civilization. The gang also includes Dutch's best friend and co-leader Hosea Matthews (Curzon Dobell), ''Red Dead Redemption'' protagonist John Marston ([[Rob Wiethoff]]), his partner Abigail Roberts (Cali Elizabeth Moore) and son Jack Marston (Marissa Buccianti and Ted Sutherland), gang members Bill Williamson ([[Steve J. Palmer]]), Javier Escuella (Gabriel Sloyer), and Micah Bell (Peter Blomquist), Native American hunter Charles Smith (Noshir Dalal), and housewife-turned-bounty hunter Sadie Adler ([[Alex McKenna]]).<ref name=\"THR\"/> The gang members' criminal acts bring them into conflict with various opposing forces including the wealthy oil magnate Leviticus Cornwall (John Rue), whose assets become a gang target. In response, he recruits a team of agents from the [[Pinkerton (detective agency)|Pinkerton Detective Agency]], led by Andrew Milton (John Hickok) and his subordinate Edgar Ross (Jim Bentley), to hunt down the gang. The gang also encounters the Saint Denis-based Italian crime lord Angelo Bronte ([[Jim Pirri]]), the controversial Guarman ruler Alberto Fussar ([[Alfredo Narciso]]), and Dutch's nemesis Colm O'Driscoll (Andrew Berg), leader of the rival O'Driscoll gang. Along its travels, the gang becomes entangled with the Gray and Braithwaite families, two warring families who are rumored to be hoarding [[American Civil War|Civil War]] gold; the gang's affiliation with the families primarily take place through Leigh Gray (Tim McGeever), the sheriff of Rhodes, and Catherine Braithwaite (Ellen Harvey), the matriarch of the Braithwaite family. Later in the game, Arthur helps Rains Fall ([[Graham Greene (actor)|Graham Greene]]) and his son Eagle Flies ([[Jeremiah Bitsui]]), both members of the Native American Wapiti tribe whose land is being targeted by the Army.<ref name=\"Credits\"/>\n\n=== Plot ===\nAfter a botched ferry heist in 1899, the Van der Linde gang is forced to leave its substantial money stash and flee Blackwater. The gang realizes that the progress of civilization is ending the time of outlaws, and so decide to gain enough money to escape the law and retire. The gang members rob a train owned by Leviticus Cornwall, who responds by hiring the Pinkertons to apprehend them. Dutch continually promises that the next heist will be their last.\n\nCornwall retaliates for the train heist, culminating in a deadly shootout in Valentine. The gang relocates to Lemoyne, where they meet the Grays and Braithwaites. Dutch tries to pit the families against each other but underestimates them. The gang is ambushed by the Grays and Sean is killed; meanwhile, the Braithwaites kidnap Jack. The gang retaliates and destroys both families, before retrieving Jack from Bronte, who embraces the gang. He offers them leads on work, but double-crosses them. Dutch kidnaps and feeds him to an alligator as revenge, which disturbs Arthur.\n\nThe gang commits a bank robbery in Saint Denis. The Pinkertons intervene, arresting John and killing Hosea and Lenny. Dutch, Arthur, Bill, Javier, and Micah escape the city via a ship heading to [[Cuba]]. A torrential storm sinks the ship, and the men wash ashore on the island of Guarma, where they become embroiled in a war between the tyrannical [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugar plantation]] owners and enslaved local population. The group successfully aids the revolution against the plantation owners and secures transport back to the United States.\n\nThe group reunites with the rest of the gang, and Dutch obsesses over one last heist. Dutch doubts Arthur's loyalty after he disobeys him by liberating John earlier than planned. He takes Micah on as his new lieutenant, replacing Arthur. Arthur becomes concerned that Dutch is no longer the man he knew, as he is becoming insular, abandons their ideals, and murders Cornwall. He is faced with his mortality when he is diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]]. Arthur reflects on his actions and how to protect the gang following his death, telling John to run away with Abigail and Jack and openly defying Dutch by aiding the local Native American people.\n\nWhen the Pinkertons assault the camp, Dutch becomes paranoid that a gang member is working as an informant. Several gang members become disenchanted and leave, while Dutch and Micah arrange one final heist of an Army payroll train. Arthur's faith in Dutch is shattered when he abandons Arthur to the Army, leaves John for dead, and refuses to rescue Abigail when she is taken. Arthur and Sadie rescue Abigail from Milton, who names Micah as the Pinkertons' informer before Abigail kills him.\n\nArthur returns to the camp and openly accuses Micah of betrayal. Dutch, Bill, Javier, and Micah turn on Arthur and the newly returned John, but the standoff is broken when the Pinkertons return. The player can choose to have Arthur aid John's escape by delaying the Pinkertons or return to the camp to recover the gang's money. Micah ambushes Arthur, and Dutch intervenes in their fight. Arthur convinces Dutch to abandon Micah and leave. If the player has high honor, Arthur succumbs to his injuries and disease and dies while watching the sunrise; if the player has low honor, Micah executes him.\n\nEight years later, in 1907, John and his family are trying to lead honest lives. They find work at a ranch where John fights back against outlaws threatening his employer. Abigail believes John is unwilling to give up his old ways and leaves with Jack. John takes out a bank loan and purchases a ranch. He works with Uncle, Sadie, and Charles to build a new home and proposes to Abigail on her return. John, Sadie, and Charles pursue Micah. Dutch has also recently arrived at Micah's camp, but shoots him and leaves in silence, allowing John to finish him off. John finds the Blackwater stash and pays his debt. John marries Abigail and they start their new life on their ranch alongside Jack and Uncle, as Sadie and Charles leave for other pursuits.\n\nThe final scene shows Edgar Ross observing John's ranch, foreshadowing the events of ''Red Dead Redemption''.\n\n== Development ==\n{{Main|Development of Red Dead Redemption 2}}\n[[File:Red Dead 2 billboard.jpg|thumb|upright|A billboard advertising the release of the game in [[Edinburgh]]]]\n\n[[Development of Red Dead Redemption 2|Preliminary work on ''Red Dead Redemption 2'']] began during the [[Development of Red Dead Redemption|development of the original game]], ''Red Dead Redemption'' (2010),<ref name=\"JeuxActu\"/> though the main production did not take place until after the game's release in May 2010.<ref name=\"Variety\"/> [[Rockstar San Diego]], the studio behind the original game, had a rough outline of the game by mid-2011, and by late 2012, rough scripts of the game had been completed.<ref name=\"Vulture\"/> When [[Rockstar Games]] realized that a group of distinct studios would not necessarily work, it co-opted all of its studios into one large team to facilitate development between 1,600 people; a total of around 2,000 people worked on the game.<ref name=\"Variety\"/>\n\nWhile the main theme of the original game was to protect family at all costs, ''Red Dead Redemption 2'' tells the story of the breakdown of a family in the form of the Van der Linde gang.

The team ensured that the characters maintained the same personality and mood from cutscene to gameplay to make the world feel more alive and realistic.<ref name=\"Variety\"/>\n\n[[Woody Jackson]], who worked with Rockstar on the original game and ''Grand Theft Auto V'', returned to compose ''Red Dead Redemption 2''{{'}}s original score.<ref name=\"Vulture\"/> ''Red Dead Redemption 2'' has three different types of score: narrative, which is heard during the missions in the game's story; interactive, when the player is roaming the open world or in multiplayer; and environmental, which includes campfire singing songs or a character playing music in the world.

Matt Bertz of ''[[Game Informer]]'' described the game as \"the biggest and most cohesive adventure Rockstar Games has ever created\",<ref name=\"Game Informer Review\"/> and ''[[GamesRadar]]''{{'}}s

Peter Suderman, writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', considered ''Red Dead Redemption 2'' as an example of [[Video games as an art form|video games as a work of art]], comparing the game's

facial animation, and level of granular detail present in the world.<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/> ''Game Informer''{{'}}s Bertz praised the attention to detail of the historical period, writing that the \"wide expanses of wilderness feel alive thanks to an unrivaled dynamic weather system, ambient sound effects, and the most ambitious ecology of flora and fauna ever seen in games\".<ref name=\"Game

Review\"/> ''USgamer''{{'}}s Williams found the game to be one of the best-looking on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.<ref name=\"USgamer Review\"/>\n\nWoody Jackson's musical score was described as \"top

wrote that the score is \"both electrifying and eclectic\".<ref name=\"GamesRadar Review\"/> Bertz of ''Game Informer'' noted that the soundtrack \"leverages elements from early American folk to bring authenticity to the world\".<ref name=\"Game Informer Review\"/> Dave Thier of ''[[Forbes]]'' described the score as \"soaring, grand, and sometimes tender\", praising the vocal tracks for having as powerful an impact as in the game's predecessor.<ref name=\"Forbes Review\"/>\n\n''Red Dead Redemption 2''{{'}}s gameplay received praise from Giant Bomb's Navarro, who noted that, \"from the biggest missions right down to the smallest interactions, all of this stuff feels like it was constructed individually\".<ref name=\"Giant Bomb Review\"/> ''GamesRadar''{{'}}s Meikleham similarly lauded the amount of detail and worth in the game's secondary mechanics.<ref name=\"GamesRadar Review\"/> Plessas of ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' wrote that the game's subtle details are \"vital for

an improvement over the violence of other action games.<ref name=\"Polygon Review\"/> ''Eurogamer''{{'}}s Robinson voiced frustration at the game's lack of freedom in some story missions.<ref

to more intimate and \"exciting\" encounters.<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/> Chris Carter of ''[[Destructoid]]'' described the gunplay as \"fantastic\" and praised the game's Dead Eye mechanic for allowing the \"further beautification of some of the more hectic confrontations\".<ref name=\"Destructoid Review\"/> ''Electronic Gaming Monthly''{{'}}s Plessas wrote that \"few games attempt to reinvent the point-gun-pull-trigger quintessence of shooters, but ''Red Dead 2'' achieves it with confidence and grace\".<ref name=\"EGM Review\"/> Sam White of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' found that the guns are \"slower, more meaningful tools\", making them feel deadlier in combat.<ref name=\"THR Review\"/> ''USgamer''{{'}}s Williams felt that the game is better than its predecessor, but is \"not the best third-person combat system\".<ref name=\"USgamer Review\"/>\n\nFilm Crit Hulk, writing for ''Polygon'', criticized the game's control system, summarizing the feeling of it as \"not one of difficulty and accomplishment, but constant monotony or frustration\".<ref name=\"Polygon Six Months Later\"/> ''[[Kotaku]]''{{'}}s Kirk Hamilton disparaged that interacting with the world became \"frustrating and inconsistent\" as a result of the game's \"sludgy kinesthetics, jumbled control scheme, and unclear user interface\", describing gameplay as \"more like giving directions to an actor\" due to \"arduous, heavy, and inelegant\" navigation and slow or unsatisfying button inputs.<ref name=\"Kotaku Review\"/> ''Forbes''{{'}} Thier echoed this by criticizing the game for having a noticeable input lag,<ref name=\"Forbes Problems\"/> while ''Forbes'' writer Paul Tassi described the game as \"an absolute slog when it comes to the actual controls, mechanics, and UI\".<ref name=\"Forbes Laborious\"/> Robert Ramsey of ''[[Push Square]]'' called the controls \"serviceable\" but at their worst \"infuriating\", and that the button layouts for various actions were too convoluted.<ref name=\"Push Square Review\"/>\n\nReviewers also critiqued how the focus on authenticity translated to gameplay in terms of player convenience and freedom. Gaming journalist [[Jim Sterling]] felt that the sheer amount of realism in the game limited capabilities and caused various scenarios or animations to be prolonged, such as hunting animals to obtain their pelts.<ref name=\"Jimpressions\"/><ref name=\"Jimquisition\"/> In addition to these complaints, reviewers also found that despite its focus, the level of realism was concurrently lacking, with discrepancies noted between the game's sense of immersion and its presenting of mechanics which defied [[Physical law|the laws of physics]] and animations they considered unrealistic;<ref name=\"Forbes Laborious\"/><ref name=\"Forbes Kain\"/><ref name=\"VentureBeat Disappointment\"/> Film Crit Hulk, writing for ''Polygon'', felt that the ability to interact with numerous items resulted in meaningless interactions, and that striving for realism in a video game did not work in practice.<ref name=\"Polygon Six Months Later\"/> [[VentureBeat]] wrote that, in spite of presenting a range of options for the player, the gameplay was still notably restrictive by preventing other opportunities.<ref name=\"VentureBeat Disappointment\"/> ''USgamer''{{'}}s Williams and ''Forbes''{{'}} Thier felt that the wanted system was unfairly punishing to the player from committing crimes that were difficult to avoid, such as accidentally knocking into NPCs.<ref name=\"USgamer Review\" /><ref name=\"Forbes Problems\" /> ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''{{'}}s Matt Reynolds was mixed on gameplay elements relating to the well-being of the player character and the required dedication, noting that the game \"exchanges immersion for observation\" and that \"at times, the constant character maintenance feels like a chore\".<ref name=\"Wired Review\"/>\n\n''Red Dead Redemption 2''{{'}}s Microsoft Windows release also received \"universal acclaim\", according to Metacritic;<ref name=\"MC PC\"/> it is one of the highest-rated PC games.<ref name=\"MC PC Top\"/> Sam White of ''[[PCGamesN]]'' thought the graphics improvements made the open world \"[look] the best it ever has\".<ref name=\"PCGamesN PC Review\"/> ''Destructoid''{{'}}s Carter praised the addition of the Photo Mode.<ref name=\"Destructoid PC Review\"/> Sam Machkovech of ''[[Ars Technica]]'' felt that the game's animations during cutscenes do not scale well to higher frame rates, but considered the gameplay to be far superior to the console versions.<ref name=\"Ars Technica PC Review\"/> Matthew Castle of ''[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]'' lauded the adapted controls, particularly when painting targets in Dead Eye, though felt they took time to familiarize oneself with.<ref name=\"RPS PC Review\"/> ''[[PC Gamer]]''{{'}}s James Davenport found the first-person perspective to be superior on the Windows version due to the responsiveness of the [[Computer mouse|mouse]].<ref name=\"PC Gamer PC Review\"/> Jean-Kl\u00e9ber Lauret of ''[[Jeuxvideo.com]]'' noted that the graphical and technical enhancements meant that advanced hardware was required, citing several [[Crash (computing)|crashes]].<ref name=\"Jeuxvideo.com PC Review\"/> ''Polygon''{{'}}s Samit Sarkar criticized the port's technical issues, writing that \"the freezing issue is bad enough that I simply can't play the game until Rockstar fixes it\".<ref name=\"Polygon PC Review\"/>\n\n=== Accolades ===\n{{Main|List of accolades received by Red Dead Redemption 2}}\n''Red Dead Redemption 2'' [[List of accolades received by Red Dead Redemption 2|received multiple nominations and awards]] from [[Video game journalism|gaming publications]], winning several [[Game of the Year]] awards.

When discussing the delay until October 2018, Paul Tassi of ''Forbes'' said that a successful launch \"could be a crater that dampens sales of all competitors in that window, so I have to imagine this shockwave is being felt pretty hard right now around the industry\".<ref name=\"Forbes Sales\"/> In July 2018, industry analyst Mat Piscatella predicted that ''Red Dead Redemption 2'' would be the best-selling game of 2018, outselling other blockbuster titles such as ''[[Battlefield V]]'', ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops 4]]'', and ''[[Fallout 76]]''.<ref name=\"NPD Predictions\"/>\n\n''Red Dead Redemption 2'' had the largest opening weekend in the history of entertainment,<ref name=\"BW Sales\"/> making over US$725 million in revenue in three days, and over 17 million copies shipped in total in two weeks,<ref name=\"THR Sales\"/> exceeding the lifetime sales of ''Red Dead Redemption''.<ref name=\"Polygon Sales\"/> Additionally, ''Red Dead Redemption 2'' is the second-highest-grossing entertainment launch (behind ''Grand Theft Auto V'') and set records for largest-ever pre-orders, largest first-day sales, and largest sales for the first three days in market on [[PlayStation Network]].<ref name=\"THR Sales\"/><ref name=\"BW Sales\"/> The game had shipped 23 million copies by December 2018,<ref name=\"Sales 2018\"/> 24 million by May 2019,<ref name=\"Sales May 2019\"/> and 29 million as of February 2020.<ref name=\"Sales February 2020\"/>\n\n''Red Dead Redemption 2'' is the best-selling retail game in its first week of release and the second-fastest-selling game of 2018 in the UK (behind ''[[FIFA 19]]''). The game's opening week UK physical sales were doubled from its predecessor's, with 68% of sales from the PlayStation 4 version. ''Red Dead Redemption 2'' is also the third-fastest-selling non-''[[FIFA (video game series)|FIFA]]'' game released in its generation, behind ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops 3]]'' and ''[[Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare]]''.<ref name=\"Gamesindustry UK Sales\"/> Within its first week on sale in Japan, the PlayStation 4 version of ''Red Dead Redemption 2'' sold 132,984 copies, which placed it at number one on the all-format video game sales chart.<ref name=\"Gematsu Sales\"/>\n\n== ''Red Dead Online'' ==\n{{Main|Red Dead Online}}\n\nThe online multiplayer component to ''Red Dead Redemption 2'', titled ''[[Red Dead Online]]'', was released as a [[public beta]] on November 27, 2018, to players who owned a special edition of the base game, and then progressively opened to all owners.<ref name=\"Polygon RDO\"/> Upon entering the game world, players customize a [[player character|character]] and are [[free roam game|free to explore]] the environment alone or in a \"posse\" group. As players complete activities throughout the game world, they receive [[experience points]] to [[level up (video gaming)|raise their characters in rank]] and receive bonuses, thereby progressing in the game.<ref name=\"Polygon 7\"/> Though ''Red Dead Online'' and ''Red Dead Redemption 2'' share assets and gameplay, Rockstar views them as separate products with independent trajectories, reflected in its decision to launch the multiplayer title separately.<ref name=\"IGN RDO\"/> Player progression in the public beta carried over when the beta ended on May 15, 2019.<ref name=\"USgamer RDO\"/>\n\n== Controversies ==\nPrior to the game's release, Houser stated that the team had been working 100-hour weeks \"several times in 2018\".<ref name=\"Vulture\"/> Many sources interpreted this statement as \"[[Crunch time (video gaming)|crunch time]]\" for the entire development staff of the game, comparable to similar accusations made by wives of Rockstar San Diego employees in regards to the [[Development of Red Dead Redemption|development of the game's predecessor]].<ref name=\"Verge Crunch\"/> The following day, Rockstar clarified in a statement that the work duration mentioned by Houser only affected the senior writing staff for ''Red Dead Redemption 2'', and that the duration had only been the case for three weeks during the entire development.<ref name=\"Eurogamer 100 Hour\"/> Houser also added that the company would never expect or force any employee to work as long as was stated, and those staying late at the development studios were powered by their passion for the project.<ref name=\"Polygon Houser\"/><ref name=\"PCGamesN Houser\"/> However, other Rockstar employees argued that Houser's statements did not give an accurate picture of the \"crunch-time culture\" at the company that many of its employees worked under, which included \"mandatory\" overtime and years-long periods of crunch. Due to the [[salary]]-based nature of employment contracts, many employees were not compensated for their overtime work and instead depended on year-end [[bonus payment]]s that hinged on the sales performance of the game. Nonetheless, a sentiment echoed across many employee statements was the observation that working conditions had somewhat improved since development on the original ''Red Dead Redemption''.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Cost\"/><ref name=\"Kotaku Crunch\"/>\n\nIn November 2018, [[YouTuber]] Shirrako posted several videos of his player character murdering a female [[suffragette]] NPC, including feeding her to an alligator and dropping her down a [[mineshaft]]. In response, YouTube suspended the channel for violation of their community guidelines, citing its graphic nature for [[Shock value|shock]] purposes and for promoting violence.<ref name=\"BBC Suffragette\"/> Audiences, including other channels, protested the decision. Conversely, the channel had also published additional videos of similar actions to other non-playable characters, such as those from the [[Ku Klux Klan]].<ref name=\"Variety Suffragette\"/> YouTube restored the channel and designated an age restriction to the suffragette videos, commenting that \"the reviewer will be educated on this outcome and on how to avoid repeating this mistake\".<ref name=\"Verge Suffragette\"/>\n\nRockstar received a [[cease and desist]] notice from [[Securitas AB]], the parent company of the modern-day [[Pinkerton (detective agency)|Pinkerton National Detective Agency]]. Securitas asserted that ''Red Dead Redemption 2''{{'}}s use of the Pinkerton name and badge imagery was against their trademark of both marks, and demanded royalties for each copy of the game sold or that they would take legal action. Rockstar filed a [[complaint]] against Securitas in January 2019, asserting that the Pinkerton name was strongly associated with the Wild West, and its use of the term did not infringe on the Pinkerton trademark. Rockstar sought a summary judgment to declare the use of Pinkerton in the game as allowed [[fair use]].<ref name=\"Verge Pinkerton\"/> By April 2019, an undisclosed settlement was agreed upon, with Securitas subsequently dismissing the lawsuit.<ref name=\"Gamesindustry Pinkerton\"/>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<!-- Gameplay -->\n\n<ref name=\"DT Fast

[[action-adventure game]] developed and published by [[Rockstar Games]]. The game is the third entry in the ''[[Red Dead]]'' series and is a [[prequel]] to the 2010 game ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]''. The story is set in 1899 in a fictionalized representation of the [[Western United States|Western]], [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] and [[Southern United States]] and follows [[outlaw]] [[Arthur Morgan (Red Dead)|Arthur Morgan]], a member of the Van der Linde gang. Arthur must deal with the decline of the [[Wild West]] whilst attempting to survive against government forces, rival gangs, and other adversaries. The story also follows fellow gang member [[John Marston (Red Dead)|John Marston]], the protagonist of ''Red Dead Redemption''.\n\nThe game is presented through both [[First-person (gaming)|first]] and [[Third-person view|third-person]] perspectives, and the player may freely roam in its interactive [[open world]]. Gameplay elements include shootouts, heists, [[hunting]], horseback riding, interacting with [[non-player character]]s, and maintaining the character's honor rating through moral choices and deeds. A bounty system similar to the \"wanted\" system from the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' franchise governs the response of law enforcement and bounty hunters to crimes committed by the player. ''Red Dead Redemption 2'' was released for the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] in October 2018, and for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Google Stadia|Stadia]] in November 2019. ''[[Red Dead Online]]'', the [[Multiplayer video game|online multiplayer]] mode of the game, was released as a [[Beta test|beta]] version in November 2018 before a full release in May 2019.\n\n[[Development of Red Dead Redemption 2|The game's development]] began soon after ''Red Dead Redemption''{{'}}s release and was shared between all of Rockstar's studios worldwide. The development team drew influence from real locations as opposed to film or art, focused on creating an accurate reflection of the time with [[List of Red Dead Redemption 2 characters|the game's characters]] and world. The game was Rockstar's first built specifically for [[Eighth generation of video game consoles|eighth generation consoles]], having tested their technical capabilities while porting ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' to the platforms. [[Music of Red Dead Redemption 2|The game's soundtrack]] features an original score composed by [[Woody Jackson (composer)|Woody Jackson]] and several vocal tracks produced by [[Daniel Lanois]].\n\nBroadly anticipated and marketed before release, ''Red Dead Redemption 2'' broke several records and had the second-biggest launch in the history of entertainment, generating $725 million in sales from its opening weekend and exceeding the lifetime sales of ''Red Dead Redemption'' in two weeks. It received widespread critical acclaim, with praise directed at its story, characters, open world, graphics, and considerable level of detail. Minor criticism was given to the game's control scheme and mission structure. Considered as an example of [[video games as an art form]], it [[List of accolades received by Red Dead Redemption 2|won year-end accolades]] including [[Game of the Year]] awards from several [[Video game journalism|gaming publications]]. It is among the [[List of best-selling video games|best-selling video games of all time]] with over 29 million copies shipped.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Red Dead Redemption 2 gameplay.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|left|The player may choose to respond positively or negatively to non-playable characters throughout the game world, which affects their reputation within the game.]]\n\n''Red Dead Redemption 2'' is a [[Western (genre)|Western]]-themed [[action-adventure game]]. Played from a [[First-person (gaming)|first]] or [[Third-person view|third-person]] perspective, the game is set in an [[open-world]] environment featuring a fictionalized version of the [[Western United States|Western]], [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] and [[Southern United States]] in 1899, during the latter half of the [[Wild West]] era and the [[turn of the century|turn]] of the [[twentieth century]].<ref name=\"TechRadar Gameplay\"/> The game features both single-player and online multiplayer components, the latter released under ''[[Red Dead Online]]''. For most of the game, the player controls outlaw [[Arthur Morgan (Red Dead)|Arthur Morgan]], a member of the Van der Linde gang, as he completes numerous missions\u2014linear scenarios with set objectives\u2014to progress through the story; from the game's epilogue, the player controls [[John Marston (Red Dead)|John Marston]]. Outside of missions, the player may [[Nonlinear gameplay|freely roam]] its interactive world. The player may engage in combat with enemies using [[Melee (gaming)|melee]] attacks, firearms, throwables, or explosives. Combat has been refined from the game's predecessor, and notable new mechanics consist of [[dual wield|dual-wielding]] and the ability to use a bow.<ref name=\"USGamer Dual Wield\"/><ref name=\"Polygon Bows\"/> Unlike the previous game, the player is granted the ability to swim.<ref name=\"GameSpot Swim\"/>\n\n''Red Dead Redemption 2''{{'}}s unexploited land makes up the largest portion of the game world and features diverse landscapes with occasional travelers, bandits, and wildlife. There are urban settlements in the game, ranging from farmhouses to towns and cities.<ref name=\"VG247 Walkthroughs\"/><ref name=\"USgamer Map\"/> Horses are the main forms of transportation, of which there are various breeds, each with different attributes. The player must either train or tame a wild horse to use it, except for stolen horses; however, they must saddle a horse to acquire ownership over it. Increased use of a horse will begin a bonding process, which can be increased by cleaning and feeding it, and the player will acquire advantages as they ride their horse.<ref name=\"EGM Review\"/> Stagecoaches and trains can also be used to travel. The player can hijack an incoming train or stagecoach by threatening the driver or passengers and then rob its contents or the passengers.<ref name=\"Game Revolution Rob\"/><ref name=\"DT Fast Travel\"/>\n\nThe player may also witness or take part in random events encountered from exploring the game world. These include ambushes, crimes committed by other people, pleas for assistance, ride-by shootings, public executions, and animal attacks. For example, as the player explores the Wild West, they can find specific people in distress. If the player decides to help them, they will be thankful and may reward the player if they cross them again.<ref name=\"EGM Review\"/><ref name=\"GamesRadar Review\"/> The player may also take part in side-activities, which include small tasks with companions and strangers, dueling, bounty hunting, searching for treasure or other collectibles around the map such as rock carvings, and playing [[poker]], [[blackjack]], [[dominoes]], and [[Knife game|Five Finger Filet]].<ref name=\"Red Bull Minigames\"/> Hunting animals also plays a major role in the game, providing food, income, and materials for crafting items. When hunting, the player needs to take into account several factors, including the choice of weapon and shot placement, which affect the quality of the meat and pelt and subsequently the price traders are willing to pay. The player can either skin the animal immediately or carry the carcass, which will rot over time and decrease its value and attract predators.<ref name=\"IGN Hunting\"/><ref name=\"DT Hunting\"/>\n\nThe game focuses heavily on player choice for the story and missions. Certain moments in the story will give the player the option to accept or decline additional missions and lightly shape the plot around their choices.<ref name=\"IGN First Look\"/> The player can communicate with any [[non-player character]] (NPC) in dynamic ways new to the series. The player can choose different dialogue trees with NPCs, such as having a friendly chat or insulting them. If the player chooses to kill an NPC, they can loot their corpse.<ref name=\"Polygon Money\"/> ''Red Dead Redemption 2'' brings back the Honor system from its predecessor by measuring how the player's actions are perceived in terms of morality. Morally positive choices and deeds like helping strangers, abiding the law, and sparing opponents in a duel will add up to the player's Honor. However, negative deeds such as theft and harming innocents will subtract from the player's Honor. The story is influenced by Honor, as the dialogue and outcomes for the player often differ based on their Honor level. Hitting milestones for the player's Honor level will grant unique benefits, such as rewarding the player with special outfits and large discounts in stores. A low Honor level is also beneficial, as the player will receive a greater number of items from looted corpses.<ref name=\"USGamer Honor\"/>\n\n[[File:Red Dead Redemption 2 Dead Eye gameplay.gif|thumb|upright=1.5|right|''Red Dead Redemption 2''{{'}}s [[Bullet time|Dead Eye]] targeting system allows the player to slow down time and mark targets. Once the targeting sequence ends, the player fires to every marked location in a very short space of time.]]\n\nMaintaining Arthur and John is important, as they can undergo conditions that affect their health and stamina attributes. In addition to a health and stamina bar, the player also has cores, which affect the rate at which their health and stamina regenerate. For example, wearing warmer clothes will mean they avoid freezing in a cold environment, but wearing them in a hot environment will result in perspiration. Freezing or overheating will rapidly drain cores. The player can also gain or lose weight depending on how much he eats; an underweight character will have less health but at an increase of stamina, while an overweight character will be able to better absorb damage but will have less stamina. The player can eat and sleep to replenish their cores. The player can bathe to remain clean, and can visit a barber to change hairstyles; hair also grows realistically over time. The game features weapon degradation, with weapons requiring cleaning to maintain their performance. When the player uses a certain type of gun for a long period of time, they become more experienced with it, which improves weapon handling, reduces recoil, and increases the rate of reloading.<ref name=\"Game Revolution Temperature\"/><ref name=\"Game Revolution Weapon\"/><ref name=\"GameSpot DNA\"/>\n\nGunfights are an essential mechanic in the game. The player can take cover, free aim, and target a person or animal. Individual body parts can also be targeted to take targets down without killing them. When the player shoots an enemy, the game's [[Artificial intelligence in video games|AI]] reactions and movements depend on where they were hit. Weapons consist of pistols, revolvers, repeaters, rifles, shotguns, bows, explosives, lassos, mounted [[Gatling gun]]s, and melee weapons such as knives and [[tomahawk]]s. ''Red Dead Redemption 2'' brings back the trademark mechanic in the franchise: Dead Eye, a targeting system that allows the player to slow down time and mark targets. Once the targeting sequence ends, the player fires to every marked location in a very short space of time. The Dead Eye system upgrades as the player progresses in the game and grants the player more abilities, such as being able to spot the fatal points of their enemies.<ref name=\"VG247 Dead Eye\"/><ref name=\"ShackNews Combat\"/>\n\nThe bounty system also returns from ''Red Dead Redemption'', a crime-governing mechanic inspired by ''Grand Theft Auto''{{'}}s wanted system. When a player commits a crime, witnesses run to the nearest police station to get the law to intervene, and the player needs to stop the witness to avoid repercussions. Once the law is alerted, law enforcers appear and will start investigating. When the player is caught, the Wanted meter appears with a bounty sent on their head. The bounty grows higher as the player commits more crimes, and more lawmen will be sent to hunt them. If the player has committed serious crimes and then manages to escape the law, bounty hunters will be hired to track them down in the wilderness. After committing enough crime, the [[United States Marshals Service|U.S Marshals]] will be sent to the player's location. To escape law enforcement, the player must evade a red circular zone in the map and the wanted meter will slowly deplete. They can alternatively hide from the pursuers or kill them.<ref name=\"USgamer Review\"/> Whether the player escapes or gets captured, the bounty will remain on their head, lawmen and civilians will be more vigilant, and regions where the crimes have been committed will be on lockdown. When caught by lawmen, the player has the opportunity to surrender if they are unarmed and on foot, though bounty hunters will not accept surrender if the player is known to slip out of apprehension attempts. The player can only remove their bounty by paying it off at a post office.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Bounties\"/>\n\n== Synopsis ==\n=== Setting ===\nThe world of ''Red Dead Redemption 2'' spans five [[List of fictional states of the United States|fictitious U.S. state]]s. The states of New Hanover, Ambarino and Lemoyne are new to the series, and are located to the immediate north and east of ''Red Dead Redemption''{{'}}s world, whilst the states of New Austin and West Elizabeth return from ''Red Dead Redemption''.{{efn|The Mexican state of Nuevo Paraiso, which featured in ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'', is not a part of the new game world.<ref name=\"Shacknews Map\"/>}} The states are centered on the San Luis and Lannahechee Rivers and the shores of Flat Iron Lake. Ambarino is a mountain wilderness, with the largest settlement being a Native American reservation; New Hanover is a wide valley that has become a hub of industry and is home to the cattle town of Valentine; and Lemoyne is composed of [[bayou]]s and plantations resembling Louisiana, and is home to the Southern town of Rhodes and the former French colony of Saint Denis, analogous to [[New Orleans]].<ref name=\"Shacknews Map\"/> West Elizabeth consists of wide plains, dense forests, and the modern town of Blackwater.<ref name=\"USgamer Map\"/> This region has been expanded from the original ''Red Dead Redemption'' to include a vast northern portion containing the small town of Strawberry.<ref name=\"Gry Online Map\"/> New Austin is an arid desert region centered on the frontier towns of Armadillo and Tumbleweed, also featured in the original game. Parts of New Austin and West Elizabeth have been redesigned to reflect the earlier time; for example, Blackwater is still under development, while Armadillo has become a ghost town because of a cholera outbreak.<ref name=\"Forbes Map\"/>\n\n=== Characters ===\n{{Main|List of Red Dead Redemption 2 characters}}\nThe player takes on the role of Arthur Morgan ([[Roger Clark (actor, born 1978)|Roger Clark]]), a lieutenant and veteran member of the Van der Linde gang. The gang is led by Dutch van der Linde ([[Benjamin Byron Davis]]), a charismatic man who extols personal freedom and decries the encroaching march of modern civilization. The gang also includes Dutch's best friend and co-leader Hosea Matthews (Curzon Dobell), ''Red Dead Redemption'' protagonist John Marston ([[Rob Wiethoff]]), his partner Abigail Roberts (Cali Elizabeth Moore) and son Jack Marston (Marissa Buccianti and Ted Sutherland), gang members Bill Williamson ([[Steve J. Palmer]]), Javier Escuella (Gabriel Sloyer), and Micah Bell (Peter Blomquist), Native American hunter Charles Smith (Noshir Dalal), and housewife-turned-bounty hunter Sadie Adler ([[Alex McKenna]]).<ref name=\"THR\"/> The gang members' criminal acts bring them into conflict with various opposing forces including the wealthy oil magnate Leviticus Cornwall (John Rue), whose assets become a gang target. In response, he recruits a team of agents from the [[Pinkerton (detective agency)|Pinkerton Detective Agency]], led by Andrew Milton (John Hickok) and his subordinate Edgar Ross (Jim Bentley), to hunt down the gang. The gang also encounters the Saint Denis-based Italian crime lord Angelo Bronte ([[Jim Pirri]]), the controversial Guarman ruler Alberto Fussar ([[Alfredo Narciso]]), and Dutch's nemesis Colm O'Driscoll (Andrew Berg), leader of the rival O'Driscoll gang. Along its travels, the gang becomes entangled with the Gray and Braithwaite families, two warring families who are rumored to be hoarding [[American Civil War|Civil War]] gold; the gang's affiliation with the families primarily take place through Leigh Gray (Tim McGeever), the sheriff of Rhodes, and Catherine Braithwaite (Ellen Harvey), the matriarch of the Braithwaite family. Later in the game, Arthur helps Rains Fall ([[Graham Greene (actor)|Graham Greene]]) and his son Eagle Flies ([[Jeremiah Bitsui]]), both members of the Native American Wapiti tribe whose land is being targeted by the Army.<ref name=\"Credits\"/>\n\n=== Plot ===\nAfter a botched ferry heist in 1899, the Van der Linde gang is forced to leave its substantial money stash and flee Blackwater. The gang realizes that the progress of civilization is ending the time of outlaws, and so decide to gain enough money to escape the law and retire. The gang members rob a train owned by Leviticus Cornwall, who responds by hiring the Pinkertons to apprehend them. Dutch continually promises that the next heist will be their last.\n\nCornwall retaliates for the train heist, culminating in a deadly shootout in Valentine. The gang relocates to Lemoyne, where they meet the Grays and Braithwaites. Dutch tries to pit the families against each other but underestimates them. The gang is ambushed by the Grays and Sean is killed; meanwhile, the Braithwaites kidnap Jack. The gang retaliates and destroys both families, before retrieving Jack from Bronte, who embraces the gang. He offers them leads on work, but double-crosses them. Dutch kidnaps and feeds him to an alligator as revenge, which disturbs Arthur.\n\nThe gang commits a bank robbery in Saint Denis. The Pinkertons intervene, arresting John and killing Hosea and Lenny. Dutch, Arthur, Bill, Javier, and Micah escape the city via a ship heading to [[Cuba]]. A torrential storm sinks the ship, and the men wash ashore on the island of Guarma, where they become embroiled in a war between the tyrannical [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugar plantation]] owners and enslaved local population. The group successfully aids the revolution against the plantation owners and secures transport back to the United States.\n\nThe group reunites with the rest of the gang, and Dutch obsesses over one last heist. Dutch doubts Arthur's loyalty after he disobeys him by liberating John earlier than planned. He takes Micah on as his new lieutenant, replacing Arthur. Arthur becomes concerned that Dutch is no longer the man he knew, as he is becoming insular, abandons their ideals, and murders Cornwall. He is faced with his mortality when he is diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]]. Arthur reflects on his actions and how to protect the gang following his death, telling John to run away with Abigail and Jack and openly defying Dutch by aiding the local Native American people.\n\nWhen the Pinkertons assault the camp, Dutch becomes paranoid that a gang member is working as an informant. Several gang members become disenchanted and leave, while Dutch and Micah arrange one final heist of an Army payroll train. Arthur's faith in Dutch is shattered when he abandons Arthur to the Army, leaves John for dead, and refuses to rescue Abigail when she is taken. Arthur and Sadie rescue Abigail from Milton, who names Micah as the Pinkertons' informer before Abigail kills him.\n\nArthur returns to the camp and openly accuses Micah of betrayal. Dutch, Bill, Javier, and Micah turn on Arthur and the newly returned John, but the standoff is broken when the Pinkertons return. The player can choose to have Arthur aid John's escape by delaying the Pinkertons or return to the camp to recover the gang's money. Micah ambushes Arthur, and Dutch intervenes in their fight. Arthur convinces Dutch to abandon Micah and leave. If the player has high honor, Arthur succumbs to his injuries and disease and dies while watching the sunrise; if the player has low honor, Micah executes him.\n\nEight years later, in 1907, John and his family are trying to lead honest lives. They find work at a ranch where John fights back against outlaws threatening his employer. Abigail believes John is unwilling to give up his old ways and leaves with Jack. John takes out a bank loan and purchases a ranch. He works with Uncle, Sadie, and Charles to build a new home and proposes to Abigail on her return. John, Sadie, and Charles pursue Micah. Dutch has also recently arrived at Micah's camp, but shoots him and leaves in silence, allowing John to finish him off. John finds the Blackwater stash and pays his debt. John marries Abigail and they start their new life on their ranch alongside Jack and Uncle, as Sadie and Charles leave for other pursuits.\n\nThe final scene shows Edgar Ross observing John's ranch, foreshadowing the events of ''Red Dead Redemption''.\n\n== Development ==\n{{Main|Development of Red Dead Redemption 2}}\n[[File:Red Dead 2 billboard.jpg|thumb|upright|A billboard advertising the release of the game in [[Edinburgh]]]]\n\n[[Development of Red Dead Redemption 2|Preliminary work on ''Red Dead Redemption 2'']] began during the [[Development of Red Dead Redemption|development of the original game]], ''Red Dead Redemption'' (2010),<ref name=\"JeuxActu\"/> though the main production did not take place until after the game's release in May 2010.<ref name=\"Variety\"/> [[Rockstar San Diego]], the studio behind the original game, had a rough outline of the game by mid-2011, and by late 2012, rough scripts of the game had been completed.<ref name=\"Vulture\"/> When [[Rockstar Games]] realized that a group of distinct studios would not necessarily work, it co-opted all of its studios into one large team to facilitate development between 1,600 people; a total of around 2,000 people worked on the game.<ref name=\"Variety\"/>\n\nWhile the main theme of the original game was to protect family at all costs, ''Red Dead Redemption 2'' tells the story of the breakdown of a family in the form of the Van der Linde gang.

Once the team had defined what limitations were sustainable, they found the areas that required the most focus.<ref name=\"VG247 AI\"/> One of Rockstar's goals with ''Red Dead Redemption 2''{{'}}s gameplay was to make the player feel as though they are living in a world, instead of playing missions and watching cutscenes. A method used to achieve this was through the gang's moving camp, where the player can interact with other characters. The team ensured that the characters maintained the same personality and mood from cutscene to gameplay to make the world feel more alive and realistic.<ref name=\"Variety\"/>\n\n[[Woody Jackson]], who worked with Rockstar on the original game and ''Grand Theft Auto V'', returned to compose ''Red Dead Redemption 2''{{'}}s original score.<ref name=\"Vulture\"/> ''Red Dead Redemption 2'' has three different types of score: narrative, which is heard during the missions in the game's story; interactive, when the player is roaming the open world or in multiplayer; and environmental, which includes campfire singing songs or a character playing music in the world.

Matt Bertz of ''[[Game Informer]]'' described the game as \"the biggest and most cohesive adventure Rockstar Games has ever created\",<ref name=\"Game Informer Review\"/> and ''[[GamesRadar]]''{{'}}s David Meikleham felt that it \"represents the current pinnacle of video game design\".<ref name=\"GamesRadar Review\"/> Keza MacDonald of ''[[The Guardian]]'' declared it \"a landmark game\" and \"a

Peter Suderman, writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', considered ''Red Dead Redemption 2'' as an example of [[Video games as an art form|video games as a work of art]], comparing the game's abilities to \"[tell] individual stories against the backdrop of national and cultural identity, deconstructing their genres while advancing the form\" to the current state of film and television with similar works like ''[[The Godfather]]'' and ''[[The Sopranos]]''.<ref name=\"NYT Art\"/>\n\nMeikleham of ''GamesRadar'' wrote that, \"story-wise, this is perhaps the boldest triple-A game ever made\", praising the unpredictability of the narrative and comparing the game's \"high caliber\" epilogue to the narrative of ''[[The Last of Us]]'' (2013).<ref name=\"GamesRadar Review\"/> ''The

of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' noted that the game's best stories \"are to be found in the margins\", discovered and written by the player.<ref name=\"EGM Review\"/> ''Game Informer''{{'}}s Bertz felt that the game's narrative rarely suffered from repetition, an impressive feat considering the game's scope.<ref name=\"Game Informer Review\"/> Conversely, ''[[GameSpot]]''{{'}}s Kallie

\"frustrating and inconsistent\" as a result of the game's \"sludgy kinesthetics, jumbled control scheme, and unclear user interface\", describing gameplay as \"more like giving directions to an

When discussing the delay until October 2018, Paul Tassi of ''Forbes'' said that a successful launch \"could be a crater that dampens sales of all competitors in that window, so I have to imagine this shockwave is being felt pretty hard right now around the industry\".<ref name=\"Forbes Sales\"/> In July 2018, industry analyst Mat Piscatella predicted that ''Red Dead Redemption 2'' would be the best-selling game of 2018, outselling other blockbuster titles such as ''[[Battlefield V]]'', ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops 4]]'', and ''[[Fallout 76]]''.<ref name=\"NPD Predictions\"/>\n\n''Red Dead Redemption 2'' had the largest opening weekend in the history of entertainment,<ref name=\"BW Sales\"/> making over US$725 million in revenue in three days, and over 17 million copies shipped in total in two weeks,<ref name=\"THR Sales\"/> exceeding the lifetime sales of ''Red Dead Redemption''.<ref name=\"Polygon Sales\"/> Additionally, ''Red Dead Redemption 2'' is the second-highest-grossing entertainment launch (behind ''Grand Theft Auto V'') and set records for largest-ever pre-orders, largest first-day sales, and largest sales for the first three days in market on [[PlayStation Network]].<ref name=\"THR Sales\"/><ref name=\"BW Sales\"/> The game had shipped 23 million copies by December 2018,<ref name=\"Sales 2018\"/> 24 million by May 2019,<ref name=\"Sales May 2019\"/> and 29 million as of February 2020.<ref name=\"Sales February 2020\"/>\n\n''Red Dead Redemption 2'' is the best-selling retail game in its first week of release and the second-fastest-selling game of 2018 in the UK (behind ''[[FIFA 19]]''). The game's opening week UK physical sales were doubled from its predecessor's, with 68% of sales from the PlayStation 4 version. ''Red Dead Redemption 2'' is also the third-fastest-selling non-''[[FIFA (video game series)|FIFA]]'' game released in its generation, behind ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops 3]]'' and ''[[Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare]]''.<ref name=\"Gamesindustry UK Sales\"/> Within its first week on sale in Japan, the PlayStation 4 version of ''Red Dead Redemption 2'' sold 132,984 copies, which placed it at number one on the all-format video game sales chart.<ref name=\"Gematsu Sales\"/>\n\n== ''Red Dead Online'' ==\n{{Main|Red Dead Online}}\n\nThe online multiplayer component to ''Red Dead Redemption 2'', titled ''[[Red Dead Online]]'', was released as a [[public beta]] on November 27, 2018, to players who owned a special edition of the base game, and then progressively opened to all owners.<ref name=\"Polygon RDO\"/> Upon entering the game world, players customize a [[player character|character]] and are [[free roam game|free to explore]] the environment alone or in a \"posse\" group. As players complete activities throughout the game world, they receive [[experience points]] to [[level up (video gaming)|raise their characters in rank]] and receive bonuses, thereby progressing in the game.<ref name=\"Polygon 7\"/> Though ''Red Dead Online'' and ''Red Dead Redemption 2'' share assets and gameplay, Rockstar views them as separate products with independent trajectories, reflected in its decision to launch the multiplayer title separately.<ref name=\"IGN RDO\"/> Player progression in the public beta carried over when the beta ended on May 15, 2019.<ref name=\"USgamer RDO\"/>\n\n== Controversies ==\nPrior to the game's release, Houser stated that the team had been working 100-hour weeks \"several times in 2018\".<ref name=\"Vulture\"/> Many sources interpreted this statement as \"[[Crunch time (video gaming)|crunch time]]\" for the entire development staff of the game, comparable to similar accusations made by wives of Rockstar San Diego employees in regards to the [[Development of Red Dead Redemption|development of the game's predecessor]].<ref name=\"Verge Crunch\"/> The following day, Rockstar clarified in a statement that the work duration mentioned by Houser only affected the senior writing staff for ''Red Dead Redemption 2'', and that the duration had only been the case for three weeks during the entire development.<ref name=\"Eurogamer 100 Hour\"/> Houser also added that the company would never expect or force any employee to work as long as was stated, and those staying late at the development studios were powered by their passion for the project.<ref name=\"Polygon Houser\"/><ref name=\"PCGamesN Houser\"/> However, other Rockstar employees argued that Houser's statements did not give an accurate picture of the \"crunch-time culture\" at the company that many of its employees worked under, which included \"mandatory\" overtime and years-long periods of crunch. Due to the [[salary]]-based nature of employment contracts, many employees were not compensated for their overtime work and instead depended on year-end [[bonus payment]]s that hinged on the sales performance of the game. Nonetheless, a sentiment echoed across many employee statements was the observation that working conditions had somewhat improved since development on the original ''Red Dead Redemption''.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Cost\"/><ref name=\"Kotaku Crunch\"/>\n\nIn November 2018, [[YouTuber]] Shirrako posted several videos of his player character murdering a female [[suffragette]] NPC, including feeding her to an alligator and dropping her down a [[mineshaft]]. In response, YouTube suspended the channel for violation of their community guidelines, citing its graphic nature for [[Shock value|shock]] purposes and for promoting violence.<ref name=\"BBC Suffragette\"/> Audiences, including other channels, protested the decision. Conversely, the channel had also published additional videos of similar actions to other non-playable characters, such as those from the [[Ku Klux Klan]].<ref name=\"Variety Suffragette\"/> YouTube restored the channel and designated an age restriction to the suffragette videos, commenting that \"the reviewer will be educated on this outcome and on how to avoid repeating this mistake\".<ref name=\"Verge Suffragette\"/>\n\nRockstar received a [[cease and desist]] notice from [[Securitas AB]], the parent company of the modern-day [[Pinkerton (detective agency)|Pinkerton National Detective Agency]]. Securitas asserted that ''Red Dead Redemption 2''{{'}}s use of the Pinkerton name and badge imagery was against their trademark of both marks, and demanded royalties for each copy of the game sold or that they would take legal action. Rockstar filed a [[complaint]] against Securitas in January 2019, asserting that the Pinkerton name was strongly associated with the Wild West, and its use of the term did not infringe on the Pinkerton trademark. Rockstar sought a summary judgment to declare the use of Pinkerton in the game as allowed [[fair use]].<ref name=\"Verge Pinkerton\"/> By April 2019, an undisclosed settlement was agreed upon, with Securitas subsequently dismissing the lawsuit.<ref name=\"Gamesindustry Pinkerton\"/>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<!-- Gameplay -->\n\n<ref name=\"DT Fast

{"title_page": "Edmund Kiss", "text_new": "'''Edmund Kiss''' (1886 \u2013 1960) was a [[Germans|Germany]] [[pseudoarchaeology|pseudoarchaeologist]] and author best known for his books about the ancient settlment of [[Tiwanaku]] in the [[Andes]] mountains of [[Bolivia]].\n\n==Early life and writings==\n\nEdmund Kiss was born in Germany in 1886 and later studied [[architecture]]. He claimed to have also studied ]]archaeology]], but there is no evidence that this is true. He was a soldier during the [[First World War]]. After the [[Treaty of Versailles]], he started writing a series of novels of [[adventure fiction]] in the prestigious German collection ''Der Gute Kamerad'' and with other publishing houses. He also wrote non-fiction works that adhered to the tenets of scientist [[Hanns H\u00f6rbiger]]. In the 1920s and early 1930s. he worked as a municipal officer responsible for the construction of public buildings.\n\nIn the 1920s Edmund Kiss started writing his first books on alternative archeology and ancient mysticism. In his book entitled ''The Last Queen of Atlantis'' (Die letzte K\u00f6nigin von Atlantis) he equated the mythical northern land Thule to the origins of humanity. According to Kiss 'The inhabitants of Northern Atlantis were led by their leader Baldur Wieborg, a native of the mythical Thule who migrated all across the world'.<ref>The Last Queen of Atlantis, p31</ref> He later described the return journey of the Nordic Thulians to their mythical homeland in ''The Swans of Thule''.\n\n==Tiwanaku and Welteislehre==\nEdmund Kiss was a follower of the [[pseudoscientific|pseudoscience]] ''Welteislehre'' ([[World Ice Theory]]). ''Welteislehre'' was a pseudoscientific hypothesis created by [[Hanns H\u00f6rbiger]] and [[Philipp Johann Heinrich Fauth]] during the 1890s.<ref>Moore, Patrick.\"Book Review: The Wandering Astronomer.\" Physics Education 35 (2000):371</ref> ''Welteislehre'' suggests that the Earth and all other cosmic planetary bodies were made out of ice. One of the claims made in H\u00f6rbiger's book ''Glacial-Kosmogonie'' was that the Earth once had six satellite moons and that sometime in the ancient past, five of these moons were destroyed.<ref>Pringle, Heather, ''The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust'' (2006), Fourth Estate, London pp.180-184</ref>  According to H\u00f6rbiger, this event would have caused global flooding and the formation of continent-spanning [[glacier]]s. According to H\u00f6rbiger, flora and fauna could only survive at high altitudes such as those found in the [[Himalayas]] and the [[Andes]]. Kiss was attracted by the claim of global ice and wanted to explore the Andes for evidence to prove H\u00f6rbiger's theory. <ref>Pringle, Heather, ''The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust'' (2006), Fourth Estate, London pp.180-184</ref>\n\nIn 1927, Kiss made contact with an Austrian writer and amateur archaeologist  [[Arthur Posnansky]].  Posnansky informed Kiss about the ruins of [[Tiwanaku]]. Posnansky had been undertaking research at Tiwanaku since the early 1900s and suggested that the temples built on the site predated the traditionally accepted date of 200 C.E. and were instead constructed around 17,000 B.C.E. Posnansky used pseudoscientific astronomical calculations on one of the walls at the site to obtain this date.<ref>Pringle, Heather, ''The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust'' (2006), Fourth Estate, London pp.180-184</ref> \n\nIn 1928, Kiss used a 20,000 Mark reward he received in a writing contest to fund an expedition to Tiwanaku. Kiss generally agreed with Posnansky's findings and came to the conclusion that the ruins were not Andean in origin.<ref>Pringle, Heather, ''The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust'' (2006), Fourth Estate, London pp.180-184</ref> These findings were based on Kiss's personal opinion that the ruins were \"European\" in design.<ref>Pringle, Heather, ''The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust'' (2006), Fourth Estate, London pp.180-184</ref> He later stated in a letter translated by [[Heather Pringle]], \"The works of art and the architectural style of the prehistoric city are certainly not of Indian style\u2026Rather they are probably the creations of Nordic men who arrived in the Andean Highlands as representatives of a special civilization.\"<ref>Pringle, Heather, ''The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust'' (2006), Fourth Estate, London pp.180-184</ref> .Kiss theorized that the original builders of Tiwanaku were Nordic peoples who had begun construction of Tiwanaku almost one million years ago. Kiss claimed that the same [[Nordic race]] that he claimed built Tiwanaku had been the inhabitants of the mythical lost continent of [[Atlantis]]. \n\nKiss's research was discussed in several publications that appeared after his 1928 expedition to Tiwanaku, in 1930, published an article for the architecture magazine ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Bauwesen'', titled ''Die Rekonstruktion des Mausoleums Puma Punku und der Sonnenwarte Kalasasaya in Tihuanaku in Bolivien''. From 1930-1933 Kiss, published ''Das Gl\u00e4serne Meer'', ''Die Letzte K\u00f6nigin von Atlantis'', and ''Fr\u00fchling in Atlantis''. These novels were presented as [[historical fiction]] and were based on his archaeological theories. The novels portray the Atlanteans as Nordic [[Aryan]]s with access to advanced technology and the builders of Tiwanaku. Kiss did not publish a comprehensive work detailing his findings at Tiwanaku until 1937, when he published ''Das Sonnentater von Tihuanaku und H\u00f6rbiger's Welteislhere''. The title makes a reference to the [[Gateway of the Sun]], a monolithic carved gateway located at Tiwanaku. The Gateway of the Sun is known for its intricate carvings, with the central figure known as the [[Gateway God]]. One of Kiss's theories for the Gateway of the Sun was that the [[monolith]] was a celestial [[calendar]], according to Heather Pringle. \"He felt certain he could see symbols for twelve months of the year, each possessing either twenty-four or twenty-five days\u2026each of the days had thirty hours.\"<ref>Pringle, Heather, ''The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust'' (2006), Fourth Estate, London pp.180-184</ref>  Another notable artifact from the site that Kiss claimed to have discovered was a sculpted stone head that he claimed resembled a Nordic man. The existence of Kiss's \"Nordic Man's Head\" sculpture has been called into question because the sculpture has not been seen since Kiss's excavations.<ref> Holton, Graham.

Bundoora: The University of La Trobe, n.d. </ref> Its existence is may have been a [[hoax]] perpetrated by Kiss.\n\n==Connections to Nazism==\nKiss, along with other leading Nazis such as [[Heinrich Himmler]], was influenced by [[V\u00f6lkisch]] ideology for most of his writing career. His adherence to the ''Welteislehre'' further strengthens his connection due to its popularity within the [[V\u00f6lkisch movement]]. Canadian author Heather Pringle has noted Kiss' lack of concern for conventional scientific theory and the way in which his ideas 'greatly appealed to [[right-wing|right-wing politics]] extremists who were always looking for ways of Germanizing science and junking anything that smacked of \"[[Jewish|Judaism]]\" science'.<ref>Pringle, Heather, ''The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust'' (2006), Fourth Estate, London p.179</ref> According to Pringle, mainstream scientists in America and Great Britain at the time described Kiss as a 'complete idiot.'<ref>Pringle, Heather, ''The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust'' (2006), Fourth Estate, London p.310</ref>\n\nThe publishing of ''Das Sonnentater von Tihuanaku und H\u00f6rbiger's Welteislehre'' brought Kiss to the attention of [[Heinrich Himmler]].  Himmler was so enthralled with Kiss's theories that he purchased a leather-bound copy of \u2018\u2019Das Sonnentater von Tihuanaku und H\u00f6rbiger's Welteislehre\u2019\u2019 as a Christmas present for [[Adolf Hitler]].<ref>Pringle, Heather, ''The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust'' (2006), Fourth Estate, London pp.180-184</ref>  Kiss's novel also included a large collection of reconstructive illustrations he created of Tiwanaku. These illustrations drew more from Kiss's fantasies than from actual archaeological work. Furthermore, his reconstructions show signs that they were also influenced by Nazi monumental architecture. <ref>Pringle, Heather, ''The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust'' (2006), Fourth Estate, London pp.180-184</ref> \n\nBy 1939, Kiss had requested the SS-[[Ahnenerbe]] to fund another expedition to Tiwanaku. The proposed expedition would've been one of the most technical of the time, including aerial and [[underwater photography]] alongside the excavations.<ref>Pringle, Heather, ''The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust'' (2006), Fourth Estate, London pp.180-184</ref>  The Ahnenerbe's director [[Wolfram Sievers]] concluded the cost for the expedition would've come to around 100,000 Reichsmarks. <ref>Pringle, Heather, ''The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust'' (2006), Fourth Estate, London pp.180-184</ref> The expedition was delayed indefinitely following the German invasion of Poland.

He claimed to have also studied ]]archaeology]], but there is no evidence that this is true. He was a soldier during the [[First World War]]. After the [[Treaty of Versailles]], he started writing a series of novels of [[adventure fiction]] in the prestigious German collection ''Der Gute Kamerad'' and with other publishing houses. He also wrote non-fiction works that adhered to the tenets of scientist [[Hanns H\u00f6rbiger]]. In the 1920s and early 1930s. he worked as a municipal officer responsible for the construction of public buildings.\n\nIn the 1920s Edmund Kiss started writing his first books on alternative archeology and ancient mysticism. In his book entitled ''The Last Queen of Atlantis'' (Die letzte K\u00f6nigin von Atlantis) he equated the mythical northern land Thule to the origins of humanity. According to Kiss 'The inhabitants of Northern Atlantis were led by their leader Baldur Wieborg, a native of the mythical Thule who migrated all across the world'.<ref>The Last Queen of Atlantis, p31</ref> He later described the return journey of the Nordic Thulians to their mythical homeland in ''The Swans of Thule''.\n\n==Tiwanaku and Welteislehre==\nEdmund Kiss was a follower of the [[pseudoscientific|pseudoscience]] ''Welteislehre'' ([[World Ice Theory]]). ''Welteislehre'' was a pseudoscientific hypothesis created by [[Hanns H\u00f6rbiger]] and [[Philipp Johann Heinrich Fauth]] during the 1890s.<ref>Moore, Patrick.\"Book Review: The Wandering Astronomer.\" Physics Education 35 (2000):371</ref> ''Welteislehre'' suggests that the Earth and all other cosmic planetary bodies were made out of ice. One of the claims made in H\u00f6rbiger's book ''Glacial-Kosmogonie'' was that the Earth once had six satellite moons and that sometime in the ancient past, five of these moons were destroyed.<ref>Pringle, Heather, ''The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust'' (2006), Fourth Estate, London pp.180-184</ref>  According to H\u00f6rbiger, this event would have caused global flooding and the formation of continent-spanning [[glacier]]s. According to H\u00f6rbiger, flora and fauna could only survive at high altitudes such as those found in the [[Himalayas]] and the [[Andes]]. Kiss was attracted by the claim of global ice and wanted to explore the Andes for evidence to prove H\u00f6rbiger's theory. <ref>Pringle, Heather, ''The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust'' (2006), Fourth Estate, London pp.180-184</ref>\n\nIn 1927, Kiss made contact with an Austrian writer and amateur archaeologist  [[Arthur Posnansky]].

In an urban environment, the field hospital is often established in an easily accessible and highly visible building (such as a [[manor house]], [[restaurant]], [[school]], and so on). In the case of an airborne structure, the mobile medical kit is often placed in a normalized container; the container itself is then used as shelter.

Two types of mobile medical kits (''poste sanitaire mobile'' or PSM) are used:\n\n* The level one mobile medical kit (PSM1): it can handle 25 heavy casualties on any type of ground; it is made of about 400&nbsp;kg of equipment and drugs placed in 10 tanks, with also logistic equipment (trailer, inflatable tent, lighting, generating unit) ; there are 42 PSM1 in France;\n* The level two mobile medical kit (PSM2): it can handle resuscitation care for 500 patients; it is made of 8 tons of equipment and drugs (200 references) in 150 tanks, it can be divided ( is possible to set up several sub-fracedPSM2); in addition to the usual logistic equipment of the PSM1, the PSM2 has a tactical [[radio]] network and a management computer system. There are 21 PSM2 in France.\n\nThe PSM are stored in the hospitals where there are [[Emergency medical services in France|samu]]s and [[smur]]s.\n\nThe PMA is organized in four zones:\n* a reception and [[triage]] zone, under the responsibility of a sort physician; the casualties  are sorted and dispatched according to the seriousness of their state;\n* two zones for medical care:\n** Absolute emergencies zone (UA: ''urgences absolues''): prehospital resuscitation unit for very serious cases: extreme emergencies (EU: ''extr\u00e8me urgence'') and grave injuries (U1);\n** Relative emergencies zone (UR: ''urgences relatives''): for the serious (U2) and light injured (U3)\n* Mortuary zone (''d\u00e9pot mortuaire'') for the deceased casualties. This zone is under the responsibility of the judicial police.\n\nIn case of really massive disaster, it is possible to have several PMA; the evacuation goes then not directly to a hospital, but to another big field hospital called \"medical evacuation centre\" (''centre m\u00e9dical d'\u00e9vacuation'', CME), to avoid the saturation of the hospitals.\n\nIn case of a [[French red plan|red plan]], the PMA is under the responsibility of a physician chosen by the director of medical rescue (DSM), and he is assisted by a [[firefighter]] officer chosen by the commander of rescue operation (COS). The  firefighter officer has in charge the identification of the living casualties and of the secretaryship. The aim of the PMA is to sort and stabilize the casualties before their evacuation to a hospital.\n\nA similar system can be set up as a preventive measure for some very big events (sport championship, cultural events, concert...), but managed by first aid associations. It is then called an \"associative medical post\" (''poste associatif m\u00e9dicalis\u00e9'', PAM). (For smaller events, is simple [[first aid post]], with only volunteer [[certified first responder]]s and no medical staff, is set up.)\n\nThe Civil defence military units (''Unit\u00e9 d'instruction et d'intervention de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 civile'', [[UIISC]]) have airborne field hospitals. The general system is called [[DICA]] (''d\u00e9tachement d'intervention de catastrophe a\u00e9roport\u00e9'', i.e. airborne disaster unit), and is specialized in [[search-and-rescue]] and in emergency medicine; it can be enhanced by the Fast civil defence medical unit, called ESCRIM (''\u00e9l\u00e9ment de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 civile rapide d'intervention m\u00e9dicale''). The ESCRIM is a surgical unit (''detachement d'appui chirurgical'') assisted by a medical assistance unit (DAMHo, ''d\u00e9tachement d'appui m\u00e9dical et d'hospitalisation''); the later is specialized in pre- and post-operation care, and allows 48h of hospitalization. The UIISC also has a PMA (i.e. sort, stabilization and evacuation structure) when the hospital infrastructure of the country is sufficient.\n\n===Namibia===\nThe [[Namibian Defence Force]] operates a Mobile Field Hospital through its Defence Health Services Directorate. It was donated by the [[Germany|German]] Government to Namibia in march 2013. Initially it was a UN level two hospital but has now been upgraded to Level one. The Field Hospital is Containerized in tents, it has capacity to treat fourty (40) outpatients per day and can admission capacity of twenty (20)patients. It has two [[intensive care]] units, laboratories, an [[X-ray]] unit and a mobile oxygen concentrator <ref>https://www.defenceweb.co.za/land/land-land/namibia-defence-force-gets-german-made-mobile-field-hospital/</ref>. The dental department can treat 20 and four operations can be carried out daily.It has its own mobile logistics support wing consisting of kitchens,  Water purifiers, water tanks, toilet and shower containers, generators and sewage and refuse disposal facilities .\n\nDuring the Corona Virus Pandemic the Hospital was deployed to [[Hosea Kutako International Airport]] to aid the country's response<ref>https://www.namibian.com.na/197902/archive-read/Mobile-field-hospital-set-up-at-airport</ref>.\n\n=== United States ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2019}}\nField hospitals were originally called [[Ambulance#Military use|ambulances]].\n[[File:After Battle of Savage's Station.jpg|thumb| Field hospital after the [[Battle of Savage's Station]] (1862).]]\n[[File:WWI - Italian army field hospital in Casera Pal Piccolo.jpg|thumb|[[Italian Army]] Field hospital on the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]] during [[World War I]]]]\n\nThe surgical, evacuation, or field hospitals would remain many miles in the rear, and the divisional clearing stations were never intended to provide emergency life-saving surgery. With the Army's larger mobile hospitals unable to assume their traditional role in support of the front line combat units, the chain of evacuation was interrupted at a critical point.  Some sort of interim solution had to be found quickly to provide the necessary surgical services and care to the severely wounded directly behind the front lines. Otherwise, many wounded soldiers would die from either the lack of life-saving surgery at the front or from the long and arduous evacuation trek along jungle trails from the frontal clearing stations to the nearest surgical unit.{{context inline|date=March 2014 }} Manned with skilled surgeons and located close to the fighting to render quick, life-saving surgical intervention, the portable hospital could be moved by its own personnel to remain with the infantrymen during fluid operations.\n\n==== 20th century ====\nA team of Medical Corps officers modified the basic War Department for a standard 25-bed station hospital into a new theater and table of basic for a portable hospital of 25-beds.  The new unit was capable of supporting small units in its camp-type version (with 4 female Army nurses and organic vehicles) or battalion and regimental combat teams in its task force version (without the 4 nurses and organic vehicles). Commanded by a Medical Corps captain or major, the new 29-man portable hospital had 4 medical officers, 3 general surgeons, and 25 enlisted men, including 2 surgical and 11 medical technicians.  What really marked a radical departure was that all of the unit's equipment, medical and surgical supplies, and rations could weigh no more than the 29 men could personally transport. Because the surgical demands on the theater's hospitals were then only minimal, a large number of trained surgeons were available in Australia to man the new units.\n\nThe surgeons in many of the initial portable hospitals would set standards of excellence in surgery and care that firmly established the reputation of the portable hospitals throughout the theater.  However, this was not true of all of the units, and in some instances hospital commanders took advantage of this opportunity to unburden themselves of their unproductive and less well qualified surgeons.  Hastily assembled and trained, the portable hospitals suffered from many shortcomings in personnel and equipment, which would soon become obvious in the jungle fighting around Buna.  Probably the single most critical problem was the severe limitation placed on the total weight to assure the unit's portability.  From the start, this meant that to be portable the unit had to give up medical and surgical equipment and supplies that would have been most useful in the field. Another handicap was the lack of a coherent doctrine for the tactical employment of the portable hospitals, along with an explanation of their exact role in the chain of treatment and evacuation within the combat zone.\n\nThe Chief Surgeon's Office promulgated a basic doctrine in September 1942 when the portable hospitals were established, but that doctrine went to the base sections in Australia and the portable hospitals and not to the medical units or surgeons in the Advanced Base in Papua and combat units.   With no actual operational experience as a basis, that doctrine was much more conjectural than concrete. The Surgeon General's Office and the War Department enthusiastically adopted SWPA's new hospital as a regular unit before the first portable hospitals proved their value in the Buna campaign.  The Surgeon General sought and received approval to add 48 of the new portable hospitals to the War Department's troop basis for 1943.  Based on what was learned at Buna. By the end of 1943, the 48 new units were activated, two of which were assigned to SWPA.  Another 15 new units would arrive in the theater during 1944 to support the increasing pace of MacArthur's offensive operations along the northern coast of New Guinea and into the Philippines.  One portable surgical hospital was now allocated per infantry regiment, 3 per division, although additional hospitals were often authorized in larger operations.\n\nDuring the war, a total of 103 portable surgical hospitals were activated and 78 would serve in various theaters around the world through end of the war\u201419 in the China-Burma-India, China, or India-Burma theaters; 12 in the Pacific Ocean Area's South and Central Pacific theaters; and 51 in SWPA (4 moved to SWPA from the South Pacific during 1944). Six PSHs were assigned to the European Theater of Operations, but they arrived only after the end of hostilities.  Thus, Carroll's temporary innovation gained significance far beyond SWPA, and the life-saving surgical work performed in all of these hospitals during the war saved the lives of many thousands of critically wounded soldiers and airmen. While equipment was always a critical concern, it was the skill level of the surgeons that most concerned the surgical consultants of the Sixth and Eighth U.S. Armies in SWPA.  They saw as one of their primary functions the selection of the surgeons for the portable surgical hospitals.  As the war dragged on into 1944, the pool of skilled and experienced surgeons that they could draw on in SWPA shrank as demands rapidly increased for such personnel.  Increasingly, the portable surgical hospitals were manned with younger and less skilled surgeons.\n\n=== Switzerland ===\n[[File:San Hist WELASYS - Schweizer Armee - Steel Parade 2006.jpg|thumb|Transport truck of the [[Swiss Armed Forces|Swiss Army]] with field hospital in [[intermodal container|cargo module]].]]\n\nDuring the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Switzerland|2020 coronavirus pandemic]], the [[Swiss Armed Forces]] were mobilised to support [[List of hospitals in Switzerland|civil hospitals]] in Switzerland.

This zone is under the responsibility of the judicial police.\n\nIn case of really massive disaster, it is possible to have several PMA; the evacuation goes then not directly to a hospital, but to another big field hospital called \"medical evacuation centre\" (''centre m\u00e9dical d'\u00e9vacuation'', CME), to avoid the saturation of the hospitals.\n\nIn case of a [[French red plan|red plan]], the PMA is under the responsibility of a physician chosen by the director of medical rescue (DSM), and he is assisted by a [[firefighter]] officer chosen by the commander of rescue operation (COS). The  firefighter officer has in charge the identification of the living casualties and of the secretaryship. The aim of the PMA is to sort and stabilize the casualties before their evacuation to a hospital.\n\nA similar system can be set up as a preventive measure for some very big events (sport championship, cultural events, concert...), but managed by first aid associations. It is then called an \"associative medical post\" (''poste associatif m\u00e9dicalis\u00e9'', PAM). (For smaller events, is simple [[first aid post]], with only volunteer [[certified first responder]]s and no medical staff, is set up.)\n\nThe Civil defence military units (''Unit\u00e9 d'instruction et d'intervention de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 civile'', [[UIISC]]) have airborne field hospitals. The general system is called [[DICA]] (''d\u00e9tachement d'intervention de catastrophe a\u00e9roport\u00e9'', i.e. airborne disaster unit), and is specialized in [[search-and-rescue]] and in emergency medicine; it can be enhanced by the Fast civil defence medical unit, called ESCRIM (''\u00e9l\u00e9ment de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 civile rapide d'intervention m\u00e9dicale''). The ESCRIM is a surgical unit (''detachement d'appui chirurgical'') assisted by a medical assistance unit (DAMHo, ''d\u00e9tachement d'appui m\u00e9dical et d'hospitalisation''); the later is specialized in pre- and post-operation care, and allows 48h of hospitalization. The UIISC also has a PMA (i.e. sort, stabilization and evacuation structure) when the hospital infrastructure of the country is sufficient.\n\n===Namibia===\nThe [[Namibian Defence Force]] operates a Mobile Field Hospital through its Defence Health Services Directorate. It was donated by the [[German]] Government to Namibia in march 2013. Initially it was a UN level two hospital but has now been upgraded to Level one. The Field Hospital is Containerized in tents, it has capacity to treat fourty (40) outpatients per day and can admission capacity of twenty (20)patients. It has two [[intensive care]] units, laboratories, an [[X-ray]] unit and a mobile oxygen concentrator <ref>https://www.defenceweb.co.za/land/land-land/namibia-defence-force-gets-german-made-mobile-field-hospital/</ref>. The dental department can treat 20 and four operations can be carried out daily.It has its own mobile logistics support wing consisting of kitchens,  Water purifiers, water tanks, toilet and shower containers, generators and sewage and refuse disposal facilities .\n\nDuring the Corona Virus Pandemic the Hospital was deployed to [[Hosea Kutako International Airport]] to aid the country's response<ref>https://www.namibian.com.na/197902/archive-read/Mobile-field-hospital-set-up-at-airport</ref>.\n\n=== United States ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2019}}\nField hospitals were originally called [[Ambulance#Military use|ambulances]].\n[[File:After Battle of Savage's Station.jpg|thumb| Field hospital after the [[Battle of Savage's Station]] (1862).]]\n[[File:WWI - Italian army field hospital in Casera Pal Piccolo.jpg|thumb|[[Italian Army]] Field hospital on the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]] during [[World War I]]]]\n\nThe surgical, evacuation, or field hospitals would remain many miles in the rear, and the divisional clearing stations were never intended to provide emergency life-saving surgery. With the Army's larger mobile hospitals unable to assume their traditional role in support of the front line combat units, the chain of evacuation was interrupted at a critical point.  Some sort of interim solution had to be found quickly to provide the necessary surgical services and care to the severely wounded directly behind the front lines. Otherwise, many wounded soldiers would die from either the lack of life-saving surgery at the front or from the long and arduous evacuation trek along jungle trails from the frontal clearing stations to the nearest surgical unit.{{context inline|date=March 2014 }} Manned with skilled surgeons and located close to the fighting to render quick, life-saving surgical intervention, the portable hospital could be moved by its own personnel to remain with the infantrymen during fluid operations.\n\n==== 20th century ====\nA team of Medical Corps officers modified the basic War Department for a standard 25-bed station hospital into a new theater and table of basic for a portable hospital of 25-beds.  The new unit was capable of supporting small units in its camp-type version (with 4 female Army nurses and organic vehicles) or battalion and regimental combat teams in its task force version (without the 4 nurses and organic vehicles). Commanded by a Medical Corps captain or major, the new 29-man portable hospital had 4 medical officers, 3 general surgeons, and 25 enlisted men, including 2 surgical and 11 medical technicians.  What really marked a radical departure was that all of the unit's equipment, medical and surgical supplies, and rations could weigh no more than the 29 men could personally transport. Because the surgical demands on the theater's hospitals were then only minimal, a large number of trained surgeons were available in Australia to man the new units.\n\nThe surgeons in many of the initial portable hospitals would set standards of excellence in surgery and care that firmly established the reputation of the portable hospitals throughout the theater.  However, this was not true of all of the units, and in some instances hospital commanders took advantage of this opportunity to unburden themselves of their unproductive and less well qualified surgeons.  Hastily assembled and trained, the portable hospitals suffered from many shortcomings in personnel and equipment, which would soon become obvious in the jungle fighting around Buna.  Probably the single most critical problem was the severe limitation placed on the total weight to assure the unit's portability.  From the start, this meant that to be portable the unit had to give up medical and surgical equipment and supplies that would have been most useful in the field. Another handicap was the lack of a coherent doctrine for the tactical employment of the portable hospitals, along with an explanation of their exact role in the chain of treatment and evacuation within the combat zone.\n\nThe Chief Surgeon's Office promulgated a basic doctrine in September 1942 when the portable hospitals were established, but that doctrine went to the base sections in Australia and the portable hospitals and not to the medical units or surgeons in the Advanced Base in Papua and combat units.   With no actual operational experience as a basis, that doctrine was much more conjectural than concrete. The Surgeon General's Office and the War Department enthusiastically adopted SWPA's new hospital as a regular unit before the first portable hospitals proved their value in the Buna campaign.  The Surgeon General sought and received approval to add 48 of the new portable hospitals to the War Department's troop basis for 1943.  Based on what was learned at Buna. By the end of 1943, the 48 new units were activated, two of which were assigned to SWPA.  Another 15 new units would arrive in the theater during 1944 to support the increasing pace of MacArthur's offensive operations along the northern coast of New Guinea and into the Philippines.  One portable surgical hospital was now allocated per infantry regiment, 3 per division, although additional hospitals were often authorized in larger operations.\n\nDuring the war, a total of 103 portable surgical hospitals were activated and 78 would serve in various theaters around the world through end of the war\u201419 in the China-Burma-India, China, or India-Burma theaters; 12 in the Pacific Ocean Area's South and Central Pacific theaters; and 51 in SWPA (4 moved to SWPA from the South Pacific during 1944). Six PSHs were assigned to the European Theater of Operations, but they arrived only after the end of hostilities.  Thus, Carroll's temporary innovation gained significance far beyond SWPA, and the life-saving surgical work performed in all of these hospitals during the war saved the lives of many thousands of critically wounded soldiers and airmen. While equipment was always a critical concern, it was the skill level of the surgeons that most concerned the surgical consultants of the Sixth and Eighth U.S. Armies in SWPA.  They saw as one of their primary functions the selection of the surgeons for the portable surgical hospitals.  As the war dragged on into 1944, the pool of skilled and experienced surgeons that they could draw on in SWPA shrank as demands rapidly increased for such personnel.  Increasingly, the portable surgical hospitals were manned with younger and less skilled surgeons.\n\n=== Switzerland ===\n[[File:San Hist WELASYS - Schweizer Armee - Steel Parade 2006.jpg|thumb|Transport truck of the [[Swiss Armed Forces|Swiss Army]] with field hospital in [[intermodal container|cargo module]].]]\n\nDuring the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Switzerland|2020 coronavirus pandemic]], the [[Swiss Armed Forces]] were mobilised to support [[List of hospitals in Switzerland|civil hospitals]] in Switzerland.
