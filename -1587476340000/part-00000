During the 15th and 16th centuries, clockmaking flourished. The next development in accuracy occurred after 1656 with the invention of the [[pendulum clock]] by [[Christiaan Huygens]]. A major stimulus to improving the accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The [[electric clock]] was patented in 1840. The development of [[electronics]] in the 20th century led to clocks with no clockwork parts at all.\n\nThe timekeeping element in every modern clock is a [[harmonic oscillator]], a physical object ([[resonator]]) that vibrates or [[oscillate]]s at a particular [[frequency]].<ref name=\"Marrison\" />\nThis object can be a [[pendulum]], a [[tuning fork]], a [[crystal oscillator|quartz crystal]], or the vibration of [[electron]]s in [[atom]]s as they emit [[microwave]]s.\n\nClocks have different ways of displaying the time. Analog clocks indicate time with a traditional [[clock face]], with moving hands. Digital clocks display a numeric representation of time. Two numbering systems are in use; [[24-hour time]] notation and 12-hour notation. Most digital clocks use electronic mechanisms and [[LCD]], [[LED]], or [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]] displays. For the blind and use over telephones, [[speaking clock]]s state the time audibly in words.  There are also clocks for the blind that have displays that can be read by touch. The study of timekeeping is known as [[horology]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''clock'' derives from the medieval [[Latin]] word for \"bell\"; ''clogga'', and has [[cognate]]s in many European languages.

Examples of such duration timers are [[candle clock]]s, [[incense clock]]s and the [[hourglass]]. Both the candle clock and the incense clock work on the same principle wherein the consumption of resources is more or less constant allowing reasonably precise and repeatable estimates of time passages. In the hourglass, fine [[sand]] pouring through a tiny hole at a constant rate indicates an arbitrary, predetermined, passage of time. The resource is not consumed but re-used.\n\n===Water clocks===\n{{main|Water clock}}\n[[File:MandalayWaterClock.jpg|thumb|upright|A water clock for [[goldbeating]] [[goldleaf]] in [[Mandalay]] ([[Myanmar]]).]]\n\nWater clocks, also known as clepsydrae (sg: ''clepsydra''), along with the sundials, are possibly the oldest time-measuring instruments, with the only exceptions being the vertical [[gnomon]] and the day counting [[tally stick]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1984|p=1}}</ref> Given their great antiquity, where and when they first existed is not known and perhaps unknowable.

Other regions of the world, including [[India]] and [[China]], also have early evidence of water clocks, but the earliest dates are less certain. Some authors, however, write about water clocks appearing as early as 4000 BC in these regions of the world.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1958|p=58}}</ref>\n\n[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] astronomer [[Andronicus of Cyrrhus]] supervised the construction of the [[Tower of the Winds]] in Athens in the 1st century B.C.<ref>[http://www.sailingissues.com/yachting-guide/tower-of-winds-1.html Tower of the Winds \u2013 Athens]</ref> The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] civilizations advanced water clock design with improved accuracy.

Independently, the Chinese developed their own advanced water clocks\uff08\u6c34\u9418\uff09in 725 AD, passing their ideas on to [[Korea]] and [[Japan]].\n\nSome water clock designs were developed independently and some knowledge was transferred through the spread of trade. [[Pre-modern]] societies do not have the same precise timekeeping requirements that exist in modern [[industrialism|industrial]] societies, where every hour of work or rest is monitored, and work may start or finish at any time regardless of external conditions. Instead, water clocks in ancient societies were used mainly for [[astrology|astrological]] reasons. These early water clocks were calibrated with a [[sundial]]. While never reaching the level of accuracy of a modern timepiece, the water clock was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for millennia, until it was replaced by the more accurate [[pendulum clock]] in 17th-century Europe.\n\nIslamic civilization is credited with further advancing the accuracy of clocks with elaborate engineering.

Existing clock mechanisms that used [[Hydropower|water power]] were being adapted to take their driving power from falling weights. This power was controlled by some form of oscillating mechanism, probably derived from existing bell-ringing or alarm devices. This controlled release of power\u2014the [[escapement]]\u2014marks the beginning of the true mechanical clock, which differed from the previously mentioned cogwheel clocks. [[Verge escapement]] mechanism derived in the surge of true mechanical clocks, which didn't need any kind of fluid power, like water or mercury, to work.\n\nThese mechanical clocks were intended for two main purposes: for signalling and notification (e.g. the timing of services and public events), and for modeling the [[solar system]]. The former purpose is administrative, the latter arises naturally given the scholarly interests in astronomy, science, astrology, and how these subjects integrated with the religious philosophy of the time. The [[astrolabe]] was used both by astronomers and astrologers, and it was natural to apply a clockwork drive to the rotating plate to produce a working model of the solar system.\n\nSimple clocks intended mainly for notification were installed in towers, and did not always require faces or hands. They would have announced the [[canonical hours]] or intervals between set times of prayer. Canonical hours varied in length as the times of sunrise and sunset shifted. The more sophisticated astronomical clocks would have had moving dials or hands, and would have shown the time in various time systems, including [[Hour#Counting from sunset|Italian hours]], canonical hours, and time as measured by astronomers at the time. Both styles of clock started acquiring extravagant features such as [[automata]].\n\nIn 1283, a large clock was installed at [[Dunstable Priory]]; its location above the [[rood screen]] suggests that it was not a water clock.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.crystalinks.com/clocks.html|title=Clocks{{Snd}} Crystalinks|website=www.crystalinks.com|access-date=2019-06-06}}</ref> In 1292, [[Canterbury Cathedral]] installed a 'great horloge'.

[[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] had the idea to use a swinging bob to regulate the motion of a time-telling device earlier in the 17th century. [[Christiaan Huygens]], however, is usually credited as the inventor. He determined the mathematical formula that related pendulum length to time (about 99.4&nbsp;cm or 39.1&nbsp;inches for the one second movement) and had the first pendulum-driven clock made. The first model clock was built in 1657 in [[the Hague]], but it was in [[England]] that the idea was taken up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?groupid=2324&HistoryID=ac08&gtrack=pthc|title=History of Clocks}}</ref> The [[longcase clock]] (also known as the ''grandfather clock'') was created to house the pendulum and works by the English clockmaker William Clement in 1670 or 1671.

The position of a ship at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to a clock that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship.

The electric clock's mainspring is wound either with an [[electric motor]] or with an [[electromagnet]] and armature. In 1841, he first patented the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] pendulum. By the end of the nineteenth century, the advent of the dry cell battery made it feasible to use electric power in clocks. Spring or weight driven clocks that use electricity, either [[alternating current]] (AC) or [[direct current]] (DC), to rewind the spring or raise the weight of a mechanical clock would be classified as an [[electromechanical clock]]. This classification would also apply to clocks that employ an electrical impulse to propel the pendulum. In electromechanical clocks the electricity serves no time keeping function. These types of clocks were made as individual timepieces but more commonly used in synchronized time installations in schools, businesses, factories, railroads and government facilities as a [[master clock]] and [[slave clocks]].\n\nElectric clocks that are powered from the [[Alternating current|AC]] supply often use [[synchronous motor]]s. The supply current alternates with a frequency of 50&nbsp;[[hertz]] in many countries, and 60&nbsp;hertz in others. The [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] of the motor rotates at a speed that is related to the alternation frequency. Appropriate gearing converts this rotation speed to the correct ones for the hands of the analog clock. The development of [[electronics]] in the 20th century led to clocks with no clockwork parts at all. Time in these cases is measured in several ways, such as by the alternation of the AC supply, vibration of a [[tuning fork]], the behaviour of [[quartz]] crystals, or the quantum vibrations of atoms. Electronic circuits divide these high-frequency oscillations to slower ones that drive the time display. Even mechanical clocks have since come to be largely powered by batteries, removing the need for winding.\n\n===Quartz===\n[[File:Inside QuartzCrystal-Tuningfork.jpg|thumb|Picture of a quartz crystal resonator, used as the timekeeping component in quartz watches and clocks, with the case removed.

Attached to the oscillator is a ''controller'' device, which sustains the oscillator's motion by replacing the energy it loses to [[friction]], and converts its oscillations into a series of pulses. The pulses are then counted by some type of ''counter'', and the number of counts is converted into convenient units, usually seconds, minutes, hours, etc. Finally some kind of ''indicator'' displays the result in human readable form.\n\n===Power source===\n\n[[File:Mainspring wind-up keys.jpg|thumb|left|Keys of various sizes for winding up mainsprings on clocks.]]\n* In mechanical clocks, the power source is typically either a weight suspended from a cord or chain wrapped around a [[pulley]], [[sprocket]] or drum; or a spiral [[Spring (device)|spring]] called a [[mainspring]].  Mechanical clocks must be ''wound'' periodically, usually by turning a knob or key or by pulling on the free end of the chain, to store [[energy]] in the weight or spring to keep the clock running.\n* In [[electric clock]]s, the power source is either a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] or the [[Mains power|AC power line]]. In clocks that use AC power, a small [[backup battery]] is often included to keep the clock running if it is unplugged temporarily from the wall or during a power outage.  Battery powered analog wall clocks are available that operate over 15 years between battery changes.\n{{breakafterimages}}\n\n===Oscillator===\n[[File:Split-flap clock.jpg|thumb|This clock used the 60&nbsp;Hz of electrical power, and features a split-flap physical for displaying the time numbers]]\nThe timekeeping element in every modern clock is a [[harmonic oscillator]], a physical object ([[resonator]]) that vibrates or [[oscillate]]s repetitively at a precisely constant [[frequency]].<ref name=\"Marrison\" />\n* In mechanical clocks, this is either a [[pendulum]] or a [[balance wheel]].\n* In some early electronic clocks and watches such as the [[Accutron]], it is a [[tuning fork]].\n* In [[quartz clock]]s and watches, it is a [[crystal oscillator|quartz crystal]].\n* In [[atomic clock]]s, it is the vibration of [[electron]]s in [[atom]]s as they emit [[microwave]]s.\n* In early mechanical clocks before 1657, it was a crude balance wheel or [[Verge escapement|foliot]] which was not a harmonic oscillator because it lacked a [[balance spring]]. As a result, they were very inaccurate, with errors of perhaps an hour a day.<ref>Milham, 1945, p. 85</ref>\nThe advantage of a harmonic oscillator over other forms of oscillator is that it employs [[resonance]] to vibrate at a precise natural [[resonant frequency]] or \"beat\" dependent only on its physical characteristics, and resists vibrating at other rates. The possible precision achievable by a harmonic oscillator is measured by a parameter called its [[Q factor|Q]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Quality factor, Q|work=Glossary|publisher=Time and Frequency Division, NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)|year=2008|url=http://tf.nist.gov/general/enc-q.htm|accessdate=2008-06-04|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504160852/http://tf.nist.gov/general/enc-q.htm|archivedate=May 4, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7chuo4ebUAC&pg=PA44&sig=iBunChocEtJoeKS5p5IgJ1oyl4U Jespersen 1999, pp. 47\u201350]</ref> or quality factor, which increases (other things being equal) with its resonant frequency.<ref>{{cite book|last=Riehle|first=Fritz|title=Frequency Standards: Basics and Applications|journal=Frequency Standards: Basics and Applications|publisher=Wiley VCH Verlag & Co.|year=2004|location=Germany|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WZ34pQV-DXMC&pg=PA9&dq=Q+linewidth+%22split+the+line%22|isbn=978-3-527-40230-4|bibcode=2004fsba.book.....R}}</ref> This is why there has been a long term trend toward higher frequency oscillators in clocks. Balance wheels and pendulums always include a means of adjusting the rate of the timepiece. Quartz timepieces sometimes include a rate screw that adjusts a [[capacitor]] for that purpose. Atomic clocks are [[Standard (technical)|primary standards]], and their rate cannot be adjusted.\n\n====Synchronized or slave clocks====\n[[Image:Greenwich clock 1-manipulated.jpg|thumb|Shepherd Gate Clock received its timing signal from within the observatory]]\nSome clocks rely for their accuracy on an external oscillator; that is, they are automatically [[Synchronization|synchronized]] to a more accurate clock:\n* [[Slave clock]]s, used in large institutions and schools from the 1860s to the 1970s, kept time with a pendulum, but were wired to a [[master clock]] in the building, and periodically received a signal to synchronize them with the master, often on the hour.<ref>Milham, 1945, pp. 325\u2013328</ref> Later versions without pendulums were triggered by a pulse from the master clock and certain sequences used to force rapid synchronization following a power failure.\n* [[Electric clock|Synchronous electric clocks]] do not have an internal oscillator, but count cycles of the 50 or 60 [[Hertz|Hz]] oscillation of the [[Mains power|AC power line]], which is synchronized by the utility to a precision oscillator. The counting may be done electronically, usually in clocks with digital displays, or, in analog clocks, the AC may drive a [[synchronous motor]] which rotates an exact fraction of a revolution for every cycle of the line voltage, and drives the gear train.  Although changes in the [[Electric grid|grid]] line frequency due to load variations may cause the clock to temporarily gain or lose several seconds during the course of a day, the total number of cycles per 24 hours is maintained extremely accurately by the utility company, so that the clock keeps time accurately over long periods.\n* Computer [[real time clock]]s keep time with a quartz crystal, but can be periodically (usually weekly) synchronized over the [[Internet]] to atomic clocks ([[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]), using the [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP). Sometimes computers on a [[local area network]] (LAN) get their time from a single local server which is maintained accurately.\n* [[Radio clock]]s keep time with a quartz crystal, but are periodically synchronized to [[radio time signal|time signals]] transmitted from dedicated [[Radio clock#List of radio time signal stations|standard time radio stations]] or [[satellite navigation]] signals, which are set by [[atomic clock]]s.\n\n===Controller===\nThis has the dual function of keeping the oscillator running by giving it 'pushes' to replace the energy lost to [[friction]], and converting its vibrations into a series of pulses that serve to measure the time.\n* In mechanical clocks, this is the [[escapement]], which gives precise pushes to the swinging pendulum or balance wheel, and releases one gear tooth of the ''escape wheel'' at each swing, allowing all the clock's wheels to move forward a fixed amount with each swing.\n* In electronic clocks this is an [[Electronic oscillator|electronic oscillator circuit]] that gives the vibrating quartz crystal or tuning fork tiny 'pushes', and generates a series of electrical pulses, one for each vibration of the crystal, which is called the [[clock signal]].\n* In [[atomic clock]]s the controller is an evacuated [[microwave]] [[Cavity resonator|cavity]] attached to a microwave [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]] controlled by a [[microprocessor]]. A thin gas of [[caesium]] atoms is released into the cavity where they are exposed to [[microwaves]]. A laser measures how many atoms have absorbed the microwaves, and an electronic [[feedback]] control system called a [[phase-locked loop]] tunes the microwave oscillator until it is at the frequency that causes the atoms to vibrate and absorb the microwaves. Then the microwave signal is divided by [[digital counter]]s to become the [[clock signal]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7chuo4ebUAC&pg=PA61&sig=r7PLMbI4rhAgfGkfBS-MCJEBkVs Jespersen 1999, pp. 52\u201362]</ref>\nIn mechanical clocks, the low [[Q factor|Q]] of the balance wheel or pendulum oscillator made them very sensitive to the disturbing effect of the impulses of the escapement, so the escapement had a great effect on the accuracy of the clock, and many escapement designs were tried. The higher Q of resonators in electronic clocks makes them relatively insensitive to the disturbing effects of the drive power, so the driving oscillator circuit is a much less critical component.<ref name=\"Marrison\" />\n\n===Counter chain===\nThis counts the pulses and adds them up to get traditional time units of [[second]]s, [[minute]]s, [[hour]]s, etc. It usually has a provision for ''setting'' the clock by manually entering the correct time into the counter.\n* In mechanical clocks this is done mechanically by a [[gear train]], known as the [[wheel train (horology)|wheel train]]. The gear train also has a second function; to transmit mechanical power from the power source to run the oscillator. There is a friction coupling called the 'cannon pinion' between the gears driving the hands and the rest of the clock, allowing the hands to be turned to set the time.<ref>Milham, 1945, p. 113</ref>\n* In digital clocks a series of [[integrated circuit]] [[counter (digital)|counters]] or dividers add the pulses up [[Digital data|digitally]], using [[binary numeral system|binary]] logic. Often pushbuttons on the case allow the hour and minute counters to be incremented and decremented to set the time.\n\n===Indicator===\n[[File:Cuckoo strikes the 8th hour.ogv|thumb|right|A [[Cuckoo clock]] with mechanical [[automaton]] and sound producer striking on the 8th hour on the analog dial.]]\nThis displays the count of seconds, minutes, hours, etc. in a human readable form.\n* The earliest mechanical clocks in the 13th century didn't have a visual indicator and signalled the time [[wikt:audible|audibly]] by striking [[bell (instrument)|bells]]. Many clocks to this day are [[striking clock]]s which strike the hour.\n* Analog clocks display time with an analog [[clock face]], which consists of a dial with the numbers 1 through 12 or 24, the hours in the day, around the outside.   The hours are indicated with an [[hour hand]], which makes one or two revolutions in a day, while the minutes are indicated by a [[Clock face|minute hand]], which makes one revolution per hour.  In mechanical clocks a gear train drives the hands; in electronic clocks the circuit produces pulses every second which drive a [[stepper motor]] and gear train, which move the hands.\n* [[Digital clock]]s display the time in periodically changing [[numerical digit|digits]] on a digital [[display device|display]].  A common misconception is that a digital clock is more accurate than an analog wall clock, but the indicator type is separate and apart from the accuracy of the timing source.\n* [[Talking clock]]s and the [[speaking clock]] services provided by telephone companies speak the time audibly, using either recorded or digitally [[Voice synthesis|synthesized voices]].\n\n==Types==\nClocks can be classified by the type of time display, as well as by the method of timekeeping.\n\n===Time display methods===\n\n====Analog====\n{{See also|Clock face}}\n[[File:Rew17h09 1977.jpg|thumb|A modern quartz clock with a 24-hour face]]\n[[File:Picadillycircuslinearclock.jpg|thumb|right|A linear clock at [[London]]'s [[Piccadilly Circus tube station]]. The 24 hour band moves across the static map, keeping pace with the apparent movement of the sun above ground, and a pointer fixed on London points to the current time.]]\n\nAnalog clocks usually use a [[clock face]] which indicates time using rotating pointers called \"hands\" on a fixed numbered dial or dials.  The standard clock face, known universally throughout the world,  has a short \"hour hand\" which indicates the [[hour]] on a circular dial of 12 [[hour]]s, making two revolutions per day, and a longer \"minute hand\" which indicates the minutes in the current hour on the same dial, which is also divided into 60 minutes. It may also have a \"second hand\" which indicates the [[second]]s in the current minute. The only other widely used clock face today is the [[24 hour analog dial]],  because of the use of [[24 hour time]] in [[military]] organizations and timetables.  Before the modern clock face was standardized during the [[Industrial Revolution]], many other face designs were used throughout the years, including dials divided into 6, 8, 10, and 24 hours.  During the [[French Revolution]] the French government tried to introduce a [[10-hour clock]], as part of their decimal-based [[metric system]] of measurement, but it didn't catch on.  An Italian 6 hour clock was developed in the 18th century, presumably to save power (a clock or watch striking 24 times uses more power).\n\nAnother type of analog clock is the [[sundial]], which tracks the sun continuously, registering the time by the shadow position of its [[gnomon]]. Because the sun does not adjust to daylight saving time, users must add an hour during that time. Corrections must also be made for the [[equation of time]], and for the difference between the longitudes of the sundial and of the central meridian of the [[time zone]] that is being used (i.e. 15 degrees east of the [[prime meridian]] for each hour that the time zone is ahead of [[GMT]]). Sundials use some or part of the 24 hour analog dial. There also exist clocks which use a digital display despite having an analog mechanism\u2014these are commonly referred to as [[flip clock]]s. Alternative systems have been proposed. For example, the \"Twelv\" clock <!-- not a typo, see http://www.gizmag.com/go/6312/ -->indicates the current hour using one of twelve colors, and indicates the minute by showing a proportion of a circular disk, similar to a [[Lunar phase|moon phase]].<ref>{{US Patent|7079452}}, {{US Patent|7221624}}</ref>\n\n====Digital====\n{{main|Digital clock}}\nDigital clocks display a numeric representation of time. Two numeric display formats are commonly used on [[Digital data|digital]] clocks:\n* the [[24-hour notation]] with hours ranging 00\u201323;\n* the [[12-hour notation]] with AM/PM indicator, with hours indicated as 12AM, followed by 1AM\u201311AM, followed by 12PM, followed by 1PM\u201311PM (a notation mostly used in domestic environments).\n\nMost digital clocks use electronic mechanisms and [[LCD]], [[LED]], or [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]] displays; many other display technologies are used as well ([[cathode ray tube]]s, [[nixie tube]]s, etc.). After a reset, battery change or power failure, these clocks without a backup [[battery (electricity)|battery]] or [[capacitor]] either start counting from 12:00, or stay at 12:00, often with blinking digits indicating that the time needs to be set. Some newer clocks will reset themselves based on radio or Internet [[time server]]s that are tuned to national [[atomic clock]]s. Since the advent of digital clocks in the 1960s, the use of analog clocks has declined significantly.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nSome clocks, called '[[flip clock]]s', have digital displays that work mechanically. The digits are painted on sheets of material which are mounted like the pages of a book. Once a minute, a page is turned over to reveal the next digit. These displays are usually easier to read in brightly lit conditions than LCDs or LEDs. Also, they do not go back to 12:00 after a power interruption. Flip clocks generally do not have electronic mechanisms. Usually, they are driven by [[Alternating current|AC]]-[[synchronous motor]]s.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\" caption=\"Examples of digital clocks\">\nKanazawa Station Water Clock.jpg|Digital clock outside [[Kanazawa Station]] displaying the time by controlling valves on a fountain\nDigital-clock-radio-basic hf.jpg|Basic digital clock radio\nAnalog clock with digital display.png|Diagram of a mechanical digital display of a [[flip clock]]\n</gallery>\n\n====Hybrid (analog-digital)====\nClocks with analog quadrants, with a digital component, usually minutes and hours displayed analogously and seconds displayed in digital mode.\n\n====Auditory====\n{{Main|Talking clock}}\nFor convenience, distance, telephony or [[blindness]], auditory clocks present the time as sounds. The sound is either spoken [[natural language]], (e.g. \"The time is twelve thirty-five\"), or as auditory codes (e.g. number of sequential bell rings on the hour represents the number of the hour like the bell, [[Big Ben]]). Most telecommunication companies also provide a [[speaking clock]] service as well.\n\n====Word====\n[[File:Word clock wallpaper with comic speech bubble style.png|thumb|Software word clock]]\nWord clocks are clocks that display the time visually using sentences. E.g.: \"It's about three o'clock.\" These clocks can be implemented in hardware or software.\n\n====Projection====\n{{Main|Projection clock}}\nSome clocks, usually digital ones, include an optical [[Image projector|projector]] that shines a magnified image of the time display onto a screen or onto a surface such as an indoor ceiling or wall. The digits are large enough to be easily read, without using glasses, by persons with moderately imperfect vision, so the clocks are convenient for use in their bedrooms. Usually, the timekeeping circuitry has a battery as a backup source for an uninterrupted power supply to keep the clock on time, while the projection light only works when the unit is connected to an A.C. supply. Completely battery-powered portable versions resembling [[flashlight]]s are also available.\n\n====Tactile====\nAuditory and projection clocks can be used by people who are blind or have limited vision. There are also clocks for the blind that have displays that can be read by using the sense of touch. Some of these are similar to normal analog displays, but are constructed so the hands can be felt without damaging them. Another type is essentially digital, and uses devices that use a code such as [[Braille]] to show the digits so that they can be felt with the fingertips.\n\n====Multi-display====\nSome clocks have several displays driven by a single mechanism, and some others have several completely separate mechanisms in a single case. Clocks in public places often have several faces visible from different directions, so that the clock can be read from anywhere in the vicinity; all the faces show the same time. Other clocks show the current time in several time-zones. Watches that are intended to be carried by travellers often have two displays, one for the local time and the other for the time at home, which is useful for making pre-arranged phone calls. Some [[equation clock]]s have two displays, one showing [[Local mean time|mean time]] and the other [[Solar time#Apparent solar time|solar time]], as would be shown by a sundial. Some clocks have both analog and digital displays. Clocks with Braille displays usually also have conventional digits so they can be read by sighted people.\n\n==Purposes==\n[[File:Robbins NC Clock.jpg|thumb|upright|Many cities and towns traditionally have public clocks in a prominent location, such as a [[town square]] or [[city center]].  This one is on display at the center of the town of [[Robbins, North Carolina]].]]\n[[File:Restoran Pozoj, \u010cakovec - stara ura.jpg|thumb|upright|An old clock in a restaurant in [[Croatia]]]]\nClocks are in homes, offices and many other places; smaller ones ([[watch]]es) are carried on the wrist or in a pocket; larger ones are in public places, e.g. a [[railway station]] or [[Church (building)|church]]. A small clock is often shown in a corner of [[computer display]]s, [[mobile phone]]s and many [[MP3 player]]s.\n\nThe primary purpose of a clock is to ''display'' the time. Clocks may also have the facility to make a loud alert signal at a specified time, typically to waken a sleeper at a preset time; they are referred to as ''alarm clocks''. The alarm may start at a low volume and become louder, or have the facility to be switched off for a few minutes then resume. Alarm clocks with visible indicators are sometimes used to indicate to children too young to read the time that the time for sleep has finished; they are sometimes called ''training clocks''.\n\nA clock mechanism may be used to ''control'' a device according to time, e.g. a [[central heating]] system, a [[VCR]], or a [[time bomb]] (see: [[digital counter]]). Such mechanisms are usually called [[timer]]s. Clock mechanisms are also used to drive devices such as [[Solar tracker#Chronological tracker|solar trackers]] and [[Telescope mount#Equatorial mounts|astronomical telescopes]], which have to turn at accurately controlled speeds to counteract the rotation of the Earth.\n\nMost [[digital computer]]s depend on an internal signal at constant frequency to synchronize processing; this is referred to as a [[clock signal]]. (A few research projects are developing CPUs based on [[asynchronous circuit]]s.) Some equipment, including computers, also maintains time and date for use as required; this is referred to as time-of-day clock, and is distinct from the system clock signal, although possibly based on counting its cycles.\n\nIn Chinese culture, [[Homophonic puns in Mandarin Chinese#Gifts|giving a clock]] ({{zh|t=\u9001\u9418|s=\u9001\u949f|first=t|p=s\u00f2ng zh\u014dng}}) is often taboo, especially to the elderly as the term for this act [[Faux pas derived from Chinese pronunciation#Clock|is a homophone]] with the term for the act of attending another's funeral ({{zh|t={{linktext|\u9001\u7d42}}|s={{linktext|\u9001\u7ec8}}|first=t|p={{linktext|s\u00f2ngzh\u014dng}}}}).<ref name=\"Brown(2006)\">{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Ju|title=China, Japan, Korea Culture and Customs|year=2006|pages=57}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Seligman|first=Scott D.|title=Chinese business etiquette:: a guide to protocol, manners, and culture in the People's Republic of China|year=1999|publisher=Hachette Digital, Inc.}}</ref><ref>http://www.sohu.com/a/160882715_578225 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105233649/http://www.sohu.com/a/160882715_578225 |date=January 5, 2018 }} \u522b\u4eba\u8fc7\u8282\u559c\u5e86\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u4e0d\u9001\u949f\u8868\u3002\u9001\u7ec8\u548c\u9001\u949f\u8c10\u97f3\u3002</ref> A UK government official [[Susan Kramer]] gave a watch to [[Taipei]] mayor [[Ko Wen-je]] unaware of such a taboo which resulted in some professional embarrassment and a pursuant apology.<ref>{{cite news|last1=BBC Staff|title=UK minister apologises for Taiwan watch gaffe|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30994307|date=26 January 2015|accessdate=29 January 2018|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nThis homonymic pair works in both Mandarin and Cantonese, although in most parts of China only clocks and large bells, and not watches, are called \"''zhong''\", and watches are commonly given as gifts in China.\n\nHowever, should such a gift be given, the \"unluckiness\" of the gift can be countered by exacting a small monetary payment so the recipient is buying the clock and thereby counteracting the {{lang|zh|'\u9001'}} (\"give\") expression of the phrase.\n\n===Time standards===\n{{Main|Time standard|Atomic clock}}\nFor some scientific work timing of the utmost accuracy is essential. It is also necessary to have a standard of the maximum accuracy against which working clocks can be calibrated. An ideal clock would give the time to unlimited accuracy, but this is not realisable. Many physical processes, in particular including some [[Electronic transition|transitions]] between atomic [[energy level]]s, occur at exceedingly stable frequency; counting cycles of such a process can give a very accurate and consistent time\u2014clocks which work this way are usually called [[atomic clock]]s. Such clocks are typically large, very expensive, require a controlled environment, and are far more accurate than required for most purposes; they are typically used in a [[Metrology#Laboratories|standards laboratory]].\n\n===Navigation===\nUntil advances in the late twentieth century, [[navigation]] depended on the ability to measure [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]. Latitude can be determined through [[celestial navigation]]; the measurement of [[longitude]] requires accurate knowledge of time. This need was a major motivation for the development of accurate mechanical clocks. [[John Harrison]] created the first highly accurate [[marine chronometer]] in the mid-18th century. The [[Noon gun]] in [[Cape Town]] still fires an accurate signal to allow ships to check their [[marine chronometer|chronometers]]. Many buildings near major ports used to have (some still do) a large [[Time ball|ball]] mounted on a tower or mast arranged to drop at a pre-determined time, for the same purpose. While [[satellite navigation]] systems such as the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) require unprecedentedly accurate knowledge of time, this is supplied by equipment on the satellites; vehicles no longer need timekeeping equipment.\n\n==Specific types==\n[[File:Clock sculpture - Drexel University - IMG 7332.JPG|thumb|upright|A monumental conical pendulum clock by [[Eug\u00e8ne Farcot]], 1867.

During the 15th and 16th centuries, clockmaking flourished. The next development in accuracy occurred after 1656 with the invention of the [[pendulum clock]] by [[Christiaan Huygens]]. A major stimulus to improving the accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The [[electric clock]] was patented in 1840. The development of [[electronics]] in the 20th century led to clocks with no clockwork parts at all.\n\nThe timekeeping element in every modern clock is a [[harmonic oscillator]], a physical object ([[resonator]]) that vibrates or [[oscillate]]s at a particular [[frequency]].<ref name=\"Marrison\" />\nThis object can be a [[pendulum]], a [[tuning fork]], a [[crystal oscillator|quartz crystal]], or the vibration of [[electron]]s in [[atom]]s as they emit [[microwave]]s.\n\nClocks have different ways of displaying the time. Analog clocks indicate time with a traditional [[clock face]], with moving hands. Digital clocks display a numeric representation of time. Two numbering systems are in use; [[24-hour time]] notation and 12-hour notation. Most digital clocks use electronic mechanisms and [[LCD]], [[LED]], or [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]] displays. For the blind and use over telephones, [[speaking clock]]s state the time audibly in words.  There are also clocks for the blind that have displays that can be read by touch. The study of timekeeping is known as [[horology]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''clock'' derives from the medieval [[Latin]] word for \"bell\"; ''clogga'', and has [[cognate]]s in many European languages.

Examples of such duration timers are [[candle clock]]s, [[incense clock]]s and the [[hourglass]]. Both the candle clock and the incense clock work on the same principle wherein the consumption of resources is more or less constant allowing reasonably precise and repeatable estimates of time passages. In the hourglass, fine [[sand]] pouring through a tiny hole at a constant rate indicates an arbitrary, predetermined, passage of time. The resource is not consumed but re-used.\n\n===Water clocks===\n{{main|Water clock}}\n[[File:MandalayWaterClock.jpg|thumb|upright|A water clock for [[goldbeating]] [[goldleaf]] in [[Mandalay]] ([[Myanmar]]).]]\n\nWater clocks, also known as clepsydrae (sg: ''clepsydra''), along with the sundials, are possibly the oldest time-measuring instruments, with the only exceptions being the vertical [[gnomon]] and the day counting [[tally stick]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1984|p=1}}</ref> Given their great antiquity, where and when they first existed is not known and perhaps unknowable.

These advances were passed on through [[Byzantium]] and [[Islamic]] times, eventually making their way back to [[Europe]]. Independently, the Chinese developed their own advanced water clocks\uff08\u6c34\u9418\uff09in 725 AD, passing their ideas on to [[Korea]] and [[Japan]].\n\nSome water clock designs were developed independently and some knowledge was transferred through the spread of trade. [[Pre-modern]] societies do not have the same precise timekeeping requirements that exist in modern [[industrialism|industrial]] societies, where every hour of work or rest is monitored, and work may start or finish at any time regardless of external conditions. Instead, water clocks in ancient societies were used mainly for [[astrology|astrological]] reasons. These early water clocks were calibrated with a [[sundial]]. While never reaching the level of accuracy of a modern timepiece, the water clock was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for millennia, until it was replaced by the more accurate [[pendulum clock]] in 17th-century Europe.\n\nIslamic civilization is credited with further advancing the accuracy of clocks with elaborate engineering.

Existing clock mechanisms that used [[Hydropower|water power]] were being adapted to take their driving power from falling weights. This power was controlled by some form of oscillating mechanism, probably derived from existing bell-ringing or alarm devices. This controlled release of power\u2014the [[escapement]]\u2014marks the beginning of the true mechanical clock, which differed from the previously mentioned cogwheel clocks. [[Verge escapement]] mechanism derived in the surge of true mechanical clocks, which didn't need any kind of fluid power, like water or mercury, to work.\n\nThese mechanical clocks were intended for two main purposes: for signalling and notification (e.g. the timing of services and public events), and for modeling the [[solar system]]. The former purpose is administrative, the latter arises naturally given the scholarly interests in astronomy, science, astrology, and how these subjects integrated with the religious philosophy of the time. The [[astrolabe]] was used both by astronomers and astrologers, and it was natural to apply a clockwork drive to the rotating plate to produce a working model of the solar system.\n\nSimple clocks intended mainly for notification were installed in towers, and did not always require faces or hands. They would have announced the [[canonical hours]] or intervals between set times of prayer. Canonical hours varied in length as the times of sunrise and sunset shifted. The more sophisticated astronomical clocks would have had moving dials or hands, and would have shown the time in various time systems, including [[Hour#Counting from sunset|Italian hours]], canonical hours, and time as measured by astronomers at the time. Both styles of clock started acquiring extravagant features such as [[automata]].\n\nIn 1283, a large clock was installed at [[Dunstable Priory]]; its location above the [[rood screen]] suggests that it was not a water clock.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.crystalinks.com/clocks.html|title=Clocks{{Snd}} Crystalinks|website=www.crystalinks.com|access-date=2019-06-06}}</ref> In 1292, [[Canterbury Cathedral]] installed a 'great horloge'.

The electric clock's mainspring is wound either with an [[electric motor]] or with an [[electromagnet]] and armature. In 1841, he first patented the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] pendulum. By the end of the nineteenth century, the advent of the dry cell battery made it feasible to use electric power in clocks. Spring or weight driven clocks that use electricity, either [[alternating current]] (AC) or [[direct current]] (DC), to rewind the spring or raise the weight of a mechanical clock would be classified as an [[electromechanical clock]]. This classification would also apply to clocks that employ an electrical impulse to propel the pendulum. In electromechanical clocks the electricity serves no time keeping function. These types of clocks were made as individual timepieces but more commonly used in synchronized time installations in schools, businesses, factories, railroads and government facilities as a [[master clock]] and [[slave clocks]].\n\nElectric clocks that are powered from the [[Alternating current|AC]] supply often use [[synchronous motor]]s. The supply current alternates with a frequency of 50&nbsp;[[hertz]] in many countries, and 60&nbsp;hertz in others. The [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] of the motor rotates at a speed that is related to the alternation frequency. Appropriate gearing converts this rotation speed to the correct ones for the hands of the analog clock. The development of [[electronics]] in the 20th century led to clocks with no clockwork parts at all. Time in these cases is measured in several ways, such as by the alternation of the AC supply, vibration of a [[tuning fork]], the behaviour of [[quartz]] crystals, or the quantum vibrations of atoms. Electronic circuits divide these high-frequency oscillations to slower ones that drive the time display. Even mechanical clocks have since come to be largely powered by batteries, removing the need for winding.\n\n===Quartz===\n[[File:Inside QuartzCrystal-Tuningfork.jpg|thumb|Picture of a quartz crystal resonator, used as the timekeeping component in quartz watches and clocks, with the case removed.

Attached to the oscillator is a ''controller'' device, which sustains the oscillator's motion by replacing the energy it loses to [[friction]], and converts its oscillations into a series of pulses. The pulses are then counted by some type of ''counter'', and the number of counts is converted into convenient units, usually seconds, minutes, hours, etc. Finally some kind of ''indicator'' displays the result in human readable form.\n\n===Power source===\n\n[[File:Mainspring wind-up keys.jpg|thumb|left|Keys of various sizes for winding up mainsprings on clocks.]]\n* In mechanical clocks, the power source is typically either a weight suspended from a cord or chain wrapped around a [[pulley]], [[sprocket]] or drum; or a spiral [[Spring (device)|spring]] called a [[mainspring]].  Mechanical clocks must be ''wound'' periodically, usually by turning a knob or key or by pulling on the free end of the chain, to store [[energy]] in the weight or spring to keep the clock running.\n* In [[electric clock]]s, the power source is either a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] or the [[Mains power|AC power line]]. In clocks that use AC power, a small [[backup battery]] is often included to keep the clock running if it is unplugged temporarily from the wall or during a power outage.  Battery powered analog wall clocks are available that operate over 15 years between battery changes.\n{{breakafterimages}}\n\n===Oscillator===\n[[File:Split-flap clock.jpg|thumb|This clock used the 60&nbsp;Hz of electrical power, and features a split-flap physical for displaying the time numbers]]\nThe timekeeping element in every modern clock is a [[harmonic oscillator]], a physical object ([[resonator]]) that vibrates or [[oscillate]]s repetitively at a precisely constant [[frequency]].<ref name=\"Marrison\" />\n* In mechanical clocks, this is either a [[pendulum]] or a [[balance wheel]].\n* In some early electronic clocks and watches such as the [[Accutron]], it is a [[tuning fork]].\n* In [[quartz clock]]s and watches, it is a [[crystal oscillator|quartz crystal]].\n* In [[atomic clock]]s, it is the vibration of [[electron]]s in [[atom]]s as they emit [[microwave]]s.\n* In early mechanical clocks before 1657, it was a crude balance wheel or [[Verge escapement|foliot]] which was not a harmonic oscillator because it lacked a [[balance spring]]. As a result, they were very inaccurate, with errors of perhaps an hour a day.<ref>Milham, 1945, p. 85</ref>\nThe advantage of a harmonic oscillator over other forms of oscillator is that it employs [[resonance]] to vibrate at a precise natural [[resonant frequency]] or \"beat\" dependent only on its physical characteristics, and resists vibrating at other rates. The possible precision achievable by a harmonic oscillator is measured by a parameter called its [[Q factor|Q]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Quality factor, Q|work=Glossary|publisher=Time and Frequency Division, NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)|year=2008|url=http://tf.nist.gov/general/enc-q.htm|accessdate=2008-06-04|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504160852/http://tf.nist.gov/general/enc-q.htm|archivedate=May 4, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7chuo4ebUAC&pg=PA44&sig=iBunChocEtJoeKS5p5IgJ1oyl4U Jespersen 1999, pp. 47\u201350]</ref> or quality factor, which increases (other things being equal) with its resonant frequency.<ref>{{cite book|last=Riehle|first=Fritz|title=Frequency Standards: Basics and Applications|journal=Frequency Standards: Basics and Applications|publisher=Wiley VCH Verlag & Co.|year=2004|location=Germany|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WZ34pQV-DXMC&pg=PA9&dq=Q+linewidth+%22split+the+line%22|isbn=978-3-527-40230-4|bibcode=2004fsba.book.....R}}</ref> This is why there has been a long term trend toward higher frequency oscillators in clocks. Balance wheels and pendulums always include a means of adjusting the rate of the timepiece. Quartz timepieces sometimes include a rate screw that adjusts a [[capacitor]] for that purpose. Atomic clocks are [[Standard (technical)|primary standards]], and their rate cannot be adjusted.\n\n====Synchronized or slave clocks====\n[[Image:Greenwich clock 1-manipulated.jpg|thumb|Shepherd Gate Clock received its timing signal from within the observatory]]\nSome clocks rely for their accuracy on an external oscillator; that is, they are automatically [[Synchronization|synchronized]] to a more accurate clock:\n* [[Slave clock]]s, used in large institutions and schools from the 1860s to the 1970s, kept time with a pendulum, but were wired to a [[master clock]] in the building, and periodically received a signal to synchronize them with the master, often on the hour.<ref>Milham, 1945, pp. 325\u2013328</ref> Later versions without pendulums were triggered by a pulse from the master clock and certain sequences used to force rapid synchronization following a power failure.\n* [[Electric clock|Synchronous electric clocks]] do not have an internal oscillator, but count cycles of the 50 or 60 [[Hertz|Hz]] oscillation of the [[Mains power|AC power line]], which is synchronized by the utility to a precision oscillator. The counting may be done electronically, usually in clocks with digital displays, or, in analog clocks, the AC may drive a [[synchronous motor]] which rotates an exact fraction of a revolution for every cycle of the line voltage, and drives the gear train.  Although changes in the [[Electric grid|grid]] line frequency due to load variations may cause the clock to temporarily gain or lose several seconds during the course of a day, the total number of cycles per 24 hours is maintained extremely accurately by the utility company, so that the clock keeps time accurately over long periods.\n* Computer [[real time clock]]s keep time with a quartz crystal, but can be periodically (usually weekly) synchronized over the [[Internet]] to atomic clocks ([[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]), using the [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP). Sometimes computers on a [[local area network]] (LAN) get their time from a single local server which is maintained accurately.\n* [[Radio clock]]s keep time with a quartz crystal, but are periodically synchronized to [[radio time signal|time signals]] transmitted from dedicated [[Radio clock#List of radio time signal stations|standard time radio stations]] or [[satellite navigation]] signals, which are set by [[atomic clock]]s.\n\n===Controller===\nThis has the dual function of keeping the oscillator running by giving it 'pushes' to replace the energy lost to [[friction]], and converting its vibrations into a series of pulses that serve to measure the time.\n* In mechanical clocks, this is the [[escapement]], which gives precise pushes to the swinging pendulum or balance wheel, and releases one gear tooth of the ''escape wheel'' at each swing, allowing all the clock's wheels to move forward a fixed amount with each swing.\n* In electronic clocks this is an [[Electronic oscillator|electronic oscillator circuit]] that gives the vibrating quartz crystal or tuning fork tiny 'pushes', and generates a series of electrical pulses, one for each vibration of the crystal, which is called the [[clock signal]].\n* In [[atomic clock]]s the controller is an evacuated [[microwave]] [[Cavity resonator|cavity]] attached to a microwave [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]] controlled by a [[microprocessor]]. A thin gas of [[caesium]] atoms is released into the cavity where they are exposed to [[microwaves]]. A laser measures how many atoms have absorbed the microwaves, and an electronic [[feedback]] control system called a [[phase-locked loop]] tunes the microwave oscillator until it is at the frequency that causes the atoms to vibrate and absorb the microwaves. Then the microwave signal is divided by [[digital counter]]s to become the [[clock signal]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7chuo4ebUAC&pg=PA61&sig=r7PLMbI4rhAgfGkfBS-MCJEBkVs Jespersen 1999, pp. 52\u201362]</ref>\nIn mechanical clocks, the low [[Q factor|Q]] of the balance wheel or pendulum oscillator made them very sensitive to the disturbing effect of the impulses of the escapement, so the escapement had a great effect on the accuracy of the clock, and many escapement designs were tried. The higher Q of resonators in electronic clocks makes them relatively insensitive to the disturbing effects of the drive power, so the driving oscillator circuit is a much less critical component.<ref name=\"Marrison\" />\n\n===Counter chain===\nThis counts the pulses and adds them up to get traditional time units of [[second]]s, [[minute]]s, [[hour]]s, etc. It usually has a provision for ''setting'' the clock by manually entering the correct time into the counter.\n* In mechanical clocks this is done mechanically by a [[gear train]], known as the [[wheel train (horology)|wheel train]]. The gear train also has a second function; to transmit mechanical power from the power source to run the oscillator. There is a friction coupling called the 'cannon pinion' between the gears driving the hands and the rest of the clock, allowing the hands to be turned to set the time.<ref>Milham, 1945, p. 113</ref>\n* In digital clocks a series of [[integrated circuit]] [[counter (digital)|counters]] or dividers add the pulses up [[Digital data|digitally]], using [[binary numeral system|binary]] logic. Often pushbuttons on the case allow the hour and minute counters to be incremented and decremented to set the time.\n\n===Indicator===\n[[File:Cuckoo strikes the 8th hour.ogv|thumb|right|A [[Cuckoo clock]] with mechanical [[automaton]] and sound producer striking on the 8th hour on the analog dial.]]\nThis displays the count of seconds, minutes, hours, etc. in a human readable form.\n* The earliest mechanical clocks in the 13th century didn't have a visual indicator and signalled the time [[wikt:audible|audibly]] by striking [[bell (instrument)|bells]]. Many clocks to this day are [[striking clock]]s which strike the hour.\n* Analog clocks display time with an analog [[clock face]], which consists of a dial with the numbers 1 through 12 or 24, the hours in the day, around the outside.   The hours are indicated with an [[hour hand]], which makes one or two revolutions in a day, while the minutes are indicated by a [[Clock face|minute hand]], which makes one revolution per hour.  In mechanical clocks a gear train drives the hands; in electronic clocks the circuit produces pulses every second which drive a [[stepper motor]] and gear train, which move the hands.\n* [[Digital clock]]s display the time in periodically changing [[numerical digit|digits]] on a digital [[display device|display]].  A common misconception is that a digital clock is more accurate than an analog wall clock, but the indicator type is separate and apart from the accuracy of the timing source.\n* [[Talking clock]]s and the [[speaking clock]] services provided by telephone companies speak the time audibly, using either recorded or digitally [[Voice synthesis|synthesized voices]].\n\n==Types==\nClocks can be classified by the type of time display, as well as by the method of timekeeping.\n\n===Time display methods===\n\n====Analog====\n{{See also|Clock face}}\n[[File:Rew17h09 1977.jpg|thumb|A modern quartz clock with a 24-hour face]]\n[[File:Picadillycircuslinearclock.jpg|thumb|right|A linear clock at [[London]]'s [[Piccadilly Circus tube station]]. The 24 hour band moves across the static map, keeping pace with the apparent movement of the sun above ground, and a pointer fixed on London points to the current time.]]\n\nAnalog clocks usually use a [[clock face]] which indicates time using rotating pointers called \"hands\" on a fixed numbered dial or dials.  The standard clock face, known universally throughout the world,  has a short \"hour hand\" which indicates the [[hour]] on a circular dial of 12 [[hour]]s, making two revolutions per day, and a longer \"minute hand\" which indicates the minutes in the current hour on the same dial, which is also divided into 60 minutes. It may also have a \"second hand\" which indicates the [[second]]s in the current minute. The only other widely used clock face today is the [[24 hour analog dial]],  because of the use of [[24 hour time]] in [[military]] organizations and timetables.  Before the modern clock face was standardized during the [[Industrial Revolution]], many other face designs were used throughout the years, including dials divided into 6, 8, 10, and 24 hours.  During the [[French Revolution]] the French government tried to introduce a [[10-hour clock]], as part of their decimal-based [[metric system]] of measurement, but it didn't catch on.  An Italian 6 hour clock was developed in the 18th century, presumably to save power (a clock or watch striking 24 times uses more power).\n\nAnother type of analog clock is the [[sundial]], which tracks the sun continuously, registering the time by the shadow position of its [[gnomon]]. Because the sun does not adjust to daylight saving time, users must add an hour during that time. Corrections must also be made for the [[equation of time]], and for the difference between the longitudes of the sundial and of the central meridian of the [[time zone]] that is being used (i.e. 15 degrees east of the [[prime meridian]] for each hour that the time zone is ahead of [[GMT]]). Sundials use some or part of the 24 hour analog dial. There also exist clocks which use a digital display despite having an analog mechanism\u2014these are commonly referred to as [[flip clock]]s. Alternative systems have been proposed. For example, the \"Twelv\" clock <!-- not a typo, see http://www.gizmag.com/go/6312/ -->indicates the current hour using one of twelve colors, and indicates the minute by showing a proportion of a circular disk, similar to a [[Lunar phase|moon phase]].<ref>{{US Patent|7079452}}, {{US Patent|7221624}}</ref>\n\n====Digital====\n{{main|Digital clock}}\nDigital clocks display a numeric representation of time. Two numeric display formats are commonly used on [[Digital data|digital]] clocks:\n* the [[24-hour notation]] with hours ranging 00\u201323;\n* the [[12-hour notation]] with AM/PM indicator, with hours indicated as 12AM, followed by 1AM\u201311AM, followed by 12PM, followed by 1PM\u201311PM (a notation mostly used in domestic environments).\n\nMost digital clocks use electronic mechanisms and [[LCD]], [[LED]], or [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]] displays; many other display technologies are used as well ([[cathode ray tube]]s, [[nixie tube]]s, etc.). After a reset, battery change or power failure, these clocks without a backup [[battery (electricity)|battery]] or [[capacitor]] either start counting from 12:00, or stay at 12:00, often with blinking digits indicating that the time needs to be set. Some newer clocks will reset themselves based on radio or Internet [[time server]]s that are tuned to national [[atomic clock]]s. Since the advent of digital clocks in the 1960s, the use of analog clocks has declined significantly.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nSome clocks, called '[[flip clock]]s', have digital displays that work mechanically. The digits are painted on sheets of material which are mounted like the pages of a book. Once a minute, a page is turned over to reveal the next digit. These displays are usually easier to read in brightly lit conditions than LCDs or LEDs. Also, they do not go back to 12:00 after a power interruption. Flip clocks generally do not have electronic mechanisms. Usually, they are driven by [[Alternating current|AC]]-[[synchronous motor]]s.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\" caption=\"Examples of digital clocks\">\nKanazawa Station Water Clock.jpg|Digital clock outside [[Kanazawa Station]] displaying the time by controlling valves on a fountain\nDigital-clock-radio-basic hf.jpg|Basic digital clock radio\nAnalog clock with digital display.png|Diagram of a mechanical digital display of a [[flip clock]]\n</gallery>\n\n====Hybrid (analog-digital)====\nClocks with analog quadrants, with a digital component, usually minutes and hours displayed analogously and seconds displayed in digital mode.\n\n====Auditory====\n{{Main|Talking clock}}\nFor convenience, distance, telephony or [[blindness]], auditory clocks present the time as sounds. The sound is either spoken [[natural language]], (e.g. \"The time is twelve thirty-five\"), or as auditory codes (e.g. number of sequential bell rings on the hour represents the number of the hour like the bell, [[Big Ben]]). Most telecommunication companies also provide a [[speaking clock]] service as well.\n\n====Word====\n[[File:Word clock wallpaper with comic speech bubble style.png|thumb|Software word clock]]\nWord clocks are clocks that display the time visually using sentences. E.g.: \"It's about three o'clock.\" These clocks can be implemented in hardware or software.\n\n====Projection====\n{{Main|Projection clock}}\nSome clocks, usually digital ones, include an optical [[Image projector|projector]] that shines a magnified image of the time display onto a screen or onto a surface such as an indoor ceiling or wall. The digits are large enough to be easily read, without using glasses, by persons with moderately imperfect vision, so the clocks are convenient for use in their bedrooms. Usually, the timekeeping circuitry has a battery as a backup source for an uninterrupted power supply to keep the clock on time, while the projection light only works when the unit is connected to an A.C. supply. Completely battery-powered portable versions resembling [[flashlight]]s are also available.\n\n====Tactile====\nAuditory and projection clocks can be used by people who are blind or have limited vision. There are also clocks for the blind that have displays that can be read by using the sense of touch. Some of these are similar to normal analog displays, but are constructed so the hands can be felt without damaging them. Another type is essentially digital, and uses devices that use a code such as [[Braille]] to show the digits so that they can be felt with the fingertips.\n\n====Multi-display====\nSome clocks have several displays driven by a single mechanism, and some others have several completely separate mechanisms in a single case. Clocks in public places often have several faces visible from different directions, so that the clock can be read from anywhere in the vicinity; all the faces show the same time. Other clocks show the current time in several time-zones. Watches that are intended to be carried by travellers often have two displays, one for the local time and the other for the time at home, which is useful for making pre-arranged phone calls. Some [[equation clock]]s have two displays, one showing [[Local mean time|mean time]] and the other [[Solar time#Apparent solar time|solar time]], as would be shown by a sundial. Some clocks have both analog and digital displays. Clocks with Braille displays usually also have conventional digits so they can be read by sighted people.\n\n==Purposes==\n[[File:Robbins NC Clock.jpg|thumb|upright|Many cities and towns traditionally have public clocks in a prominent location, such as a [[town square]] or [[city center]].  This one is on display at the center of the town of [[Robbins, North Carolina]].]]\n[[File:Restoran Pozoj, \u010cakovec - stara ura.jpg|thumb|upright|An old clock in a restaurant in [[Croatia]]]]\nClocks are in homes, offices and many other places; smaller ones ([[watch]]es) are carried on the wrist or in a pocket; larger ones are in public places, e.g. a [[railway station]] or [[Church (building)|church]]. A small clock is often shown in a corner of [[computer display]]s, [[mobile phone]]s and many [[MP3 player]]s.\n\nThe primary purpose of a clock is to ''display'' the time. Clocks may also have the facility to make a loud alert signal at a specified time, typically to waken a sleeper at a preset time; they are referred to as ''alarm clocks''. The alarm may start at a low volume and become louder, or have the facility to be switched off for a few minutes then resume. Alarm clocks with visible indicators are sometimes used to indicate to children too young to read the time that the time for sleep has finished; they are sometimes called ''training clocks''.\n\nA clock mechanism may be used to ''control'' a device according to time, e.g. a [[central heating]] system, a [[VCR]], or a [[time bomb]] (see: [[digital counter]]). Such mechanisms are usually called [[timer]]s. Clock mechanisms are also used to drive devices such as [[Solar tracker#Chronological tracker|solar trackers]] and [[Telescope mount#Equatorial mounts|astronomical telescopes]], which have to turn at accurately controlled speeds to counteract the rotation of the Earth.\n\nMost [[digital computer]]s depend on an internal signal at constant frequency to synchronize processing; this is referred to as a [[clock signal]]. (A few research projects are developing CPUs based on [[asynchronous circuit]]s.) Some equipment, including computers, also maintains time and date for use as required; this is referred to as time-of-day clock, and is distinct from the system clock signal, although possibly based on counting its cycles.\n\nIn Chinese culture, [[Homophonic puns in Mandarin Chinese#Gifts|giving a clock]] ({{zh|t=\u9001\u9418|s=\u9001\u949f|first=t|p=s\u00f2ng zh\u014dng}}) is often taboo, especially to the elderly as the term for this act [[Faux pas derived from Chinese pronunciation#Clock|is a homophone]] with the term for the act of attending another's funeral ({{zh|t={{linktext|\u9001\u7d42}}|s={{linktext|\u9001\u7ec8}}|first=t|p={{linktext|s\u00f2ngzh\u014dng}}}}).<ref name=\"Brown(2006)\">{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Ju|title=China, Japan, Korea Culture and Customs|year=2006|pages=57}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Seligman|first=Scott D.|title=Chinese business etiquette:: a guide to protocol, manners, and culture in the People's Republic of China|year=1999|publisher=Hachette Digital, Inc.}}</ref><ref>http://www.sohu.com/a/160882715_578225 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105233649/http://www.sohu.com/a/160882715_578225 |date=January 5, 2018 }} \u522b\u4eba\u8fc7\u8282\u559c\u5e86\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u4e0d\u9001\u949f\u8868\u3002\u9001\u7ec8\u548c\u9001\u949f\u8c10\u97f3\u3002</ref> A UK government official [[Susan Kramer]] gave a watch to [[Taipei]] mayor [[Ko Wen-je]] unaware of such a taboo which resulted in some professional embarrassment and a pursuant apology.<ref>{{cite news|last1=BBC Staff|title=UK minister apologises for Taiwan watch gaffe|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30994307|date=26 January 2015|accessdate=29 January 2018|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nThis homonymic pair works in both Mandarin and Cantonese, although in most parts of China only clocks and large bells, and not watches, are called \"''zhong''\", and watches are commonly given as gifts in China.\n\nHowever, should such a gift be given, the \"unluckiness\" of the gift can be countered by exacting a small monetary payment so the recipient is buying the clock and thereby counteracting the {{lang|zh|'\u9001'}} (\"give\") expression of the phrase.\n\n===Time standards===\n{{Main|Time standard|Atomic clock}}\nFor some scientific work timing of the utmost accuracy is essential. It is also necessary to have a standard of the maximum accuracy against which working clocks can be calibrated. An ideal clock would give the time to unlimited accuracy, but this is not realisable. Many physical processes, in particular including some [[Electronic transition|transitions]] between atomic [[energy level]]s, occur at exceedingly stable frequency; counting cycles of such a process can give a very accurate and consistent time\u2014clocks which work this way are usually called [[atomic clock]]s. Such clocks are typically large, very expensive, require a controlled environment, and are far more accurate than required for most purposes; they are typically used in a [[Metrology#Laboratories|standards laboratory]].\n\n===Navigation===\nUntil advances in the late twentieth century, [[navigation]] depended on the ability to measure [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]. Latitude can be determined through [[celestial navigation]]; the measurement of [[longitude]] requires accurate knowledge of time. This need was a major motivation for the development of accurate mechanical clocks. [[John Harrison]] created the first highly accurate [[marine chronometer]] in the mid-18th century. The [[Noon gun]] in [[Cape Town]] still fires an accurate signal to allow ships to check their [[marine chronometer|chronometers]]. Many buildings near major ports used to have (some still do) a large [[Time ball|ball]] mounted on a tower or mast arranged to drop at a pre-determined time, for the same purpose. While [[satellite navigation]] systems such as the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) require unprecedentedly accurate knowledge of time, this is supplied by equipment on the satellites; vehicles no longer need timekeeping equipment.\n\n==Specific types==\n[[File:Clock sculpture - Drexel University - IMG 7332.JPG|thumb|upright|A monumental conical pendulum clock by [[Eug\u00e8ne Farcot]], 1867.

It is also currently one of the few [[Sauropoda|sauropods]] described from the [[Toarcian]] of the modern northern hemisphere, along with ''[[Tazoudasaurus]]'' which has been considered a relative. ''Ohmdenosaurus'' lived on an island series in what is now the region of [[Bohemia]]. It was mistaken originally as a plesiosaur remains, until a revision of the holotype in 1978. It is the only dinosaur identified from the [[Posidonia Shale]].<ref name=\"wild1978\"/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Ohmdenosaurus Scale.svg|thumb|300px|left|Scaled type specimen]] \n''Ohmdenosaurus'' is considered a primitive sauropod, although not the most known one. Following the Sauropod morphological trend, it is believed that its appearance would be that of a fully quadrupedal animal, with a long neck and a relatively robust body. It is not really known the range of specialization of primitive sauropods referred to its diet, being herbivorous, but probably with different choices concerning the type of vegetation. ''Ohmdenosaurus'' probably ranged from medium to high vegetation, with plants like tall [[Bennettitales]], [[Araucariaceae]] and [[Podocarpaceae]] trees being among the most probably components of its diet.<ref name=\"wild1978\"/> The type specimen of ''Ohmdenosaurus'' consists on a [[Tibia]] and a [[Talus bone]] (Astragalus). The Tibia possesses a bent and sloping, powerful [[Cnemial Crest]], that is delimited laterally by a sulcus; it has a proximal joint end,  perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the shaft; the lateral part of the tibia has a lateral crista that extends to the middle; The Astragalus is flat in comparison to the Tibia, with a sandal-shaped form, without ascending process; calcaneus has small proportions, and is disc-shaped.<ref name=\"wild1978\"/> The articulation presents a possible joint with bony sesamoids, but that wasn't compared.<ref name=\"wild1978\"/> The size of the Tibia is 405&nbsp;mm long according to Wild<ref name=\"wild1978\"/> and Carrano (1998),<ref>Carrano, M. T. (1998). The evolution of dinosaur locomotion: biomechanics, functional morphology, and modern analogs (Doctoral dissertation, Ph. D. thesis.

Princeton University Press.</ref>\n\n==History of discovery==\nIn the 1970s, German [[palaeontologist]] Rupert Wild, visiting the [[Urwelt-Museum Hauff]] at [[Holzmaden]] in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], noticed a fossil in a display labelled as an [[humerus|upper arm bone]] of a [[plesiosaur]] which he recognized as a misidentified dinosaur fossil.<ref name=\"wild1978\"/> The bone had been collected from one of the early quarries near [[Ohmden]] that was later refilled. Although the exact discovery site is unknown, rock attached to the lower end of the fossil comes from the ''unterer Schiefer'' (\"lower slate\"), the oldest part of the [[Posidonia Shale]].<ref name=\"wild1978\"/> It is therefore Early [[Toarcian]] in age (182.0 to 175.6 mya).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://paleobiodb.org/classic/basicTaxonInfo?taxon_no=65914|publisher=[[Paleobiology Database]]|website=paleobiodb.org|access-date=2019-08-04|title=''Ohmdenosaurus liasicus'' Wild 1978 (sauropod)}}</ref>\nFurther study determined that the fossil belonged to a new genus and species of early sauropod, which Wild named ''Ohmdenosaurus liasicus'' in a 1978 publication. The fossil, which lacks an inventory number, consists of a right [[tibia]] (shinbone) together with the upper bones of the ankle, the [[Talus bone|astragalus]] and the [[calcaneus]]. The bones, disarticulated in the fossil, show signs of weathering, evidence that the animal died on land and that only later were its bones washed into the sea.\n\n== Classification ==\nThe shape of the astragalus - which is not convex on top as it is in derived members of [[Neosauropoda]] - suggests that ''Ohmdenosaurus'' was a very basal sauropod, although with the finds on new groups such as [[Lessemsauridae]] the status of ''Ohmdenosaurus'' has slightly changed, being seen as a less basal taxon, related in most of the contemporaneous works to the [[Gravisauria]]ns. In 1990 John Stanton McIntosh included ''Ohmdenosaurus'' in the [[Vulcanodontidae]]<ref>McIntosh,  J.S.,  1990.  Sauropoda.  In:  Weishampel,  D.B.,  Dodson,  P., Osmo \u0301lska, H.  (Eds.), The Dinosauria, University of California Press, Berkeley, pp. 345\u2013401.</ref> along with the also controversial genus [[Zizhongosaurus]], but that was based more on the geological age of the two sauropods ([[Toarcian]]) than on a comparative study of the morphology between the genera.<ref name=\"Upchurch, P. 1995\"/> The clade Vulcanodontidae later became a waste-basket taxon for many unrelated basal sauropods. ''Ohmdenosaurus'' has not been confirmed by an exact analysis as a \"Vulcanodontid\" in the modern sense, neither a relative of [[Vulcanodon]]. The latest studies had been suggested that ''Ohmdenosaurus'' is a more basal [[gravisauria]]n, closely related to the Australian genus ''[[Rhoetosaurus]]''. The reassignation of ''Ohmdenosaurus'' was proposed due to similarities such as the presence of a proximal and distal surfaces of the astragalus, or the presence of a rounded cnemial crest nearly identical on ''[[Rhoetosaurus]]''. Astragalus morphology is also present on [[Ferganasaurus]], but in overall morphology, ''Ohmdenosaurus'' is considered the closest genera.<ref>Nair, J. P., & Salisbury, S. W. (2012).

It is also currently one of the few [[Sauropoda|sauropods]] described from the [[Toarcian]] of the modern northern hemisphere, along with ''[[Tazoudasaurus]]'' which has been considered a relative. ''Ohmdenosaurus'' lived on an island series in what is now the region of [[Bohemia]]. It was mistaken originally as a plesiosaur remains, until a revision of the holotype in 1978. It is the only dinosaur identified from the [[Posidonia Shale]].<ref name=\"wild1978\"/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Ohmdenosaurus Scale.svg|thumb|300px|left|Scaled type specimen]] \n''Ohmdenosaurus'' is considered a primitive sauropod, although not the most known one. Following the Sauropod morphological trend, it is believed that it's appearance would be that of a fully cuadrupedal animal, with a long neck and a relative robust body. Is not really known the range of specialization of primitive sauropods referred to its diet, being hervivorous, but probably with different choices concerning the type of vegetation. ''Ohmdenosaurus'' probably ranged from medium to high vegetation, with plants like tall [[Bennettitales]], [[Araucariaceae]] and [[Podocarpaceae]] trees being among the most probably components of its diet.<ref name=\"wild1978\"/> The type specimen of ''Ohmdenosaurus'' consists on a [[Tibia]] and a [[Talus bone]] (Astragalus). The Tibia possesses a bent and sloping, powerful [[Cnemial Crest]], that is delimited laterally by a sulcus; it has a  the proximal joint end,  perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the shaft; the lateral part of the tibia has a lateral crista that extends to the middle; The Astragalus is flat in comparison to the Tibia, with a sandal-shaped form, without ascending process; calcaneus has small proportions, and is disc-shaped.<ref name=\"wild1978\"/> The articulation presents a possible joint with bony sesamoids, but that wasn't compared.<ref name=\"wild1978\"/> The size of the Tibia is 405&nbsp;mm long according to Wild<ref name=\"wild1978\"/> and Carrano (1998),<ref>Carrano, M. T. (1998). The evolution of dinosaur locomotion: biomechanics, functional morphology, and modern analogs (Doctoral dissertation, Ph. D. thesis. University of Chicago, Chicago, Ill).</ref> with an estimated femur length of at least 70&nbsp;cm. This yielded traditionally an estimated total body length of {{Convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

(2020). Dinosaur Facts and Figures: The Sauropods and Other Sauropodomorphs. Princeton University Press.</ref>\n\n==History of discovery==\nIn the 1970s, German [[palaeontologist]] Rupert Wild, visiting the [[Urwelt-Museum Hauff]] at [[Holzmaden]] in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], noticed a fossil in a display labelled as an [[humerus|upper arm bone]] of a [[plesiosaur]] which he recognized as a misidentified dinosaur fossil.<ref name=\"wild1978\"/> The bone had been collected from one of the early quarries near [[Ohmden]] that was later refilled. Although the exact discovery site is unknown, rock attached to the lower end of the fossil comes from the ''unterer Schiefer'' (\"lower slate\"), the oldest part of the [[Posidonia Shale]].<ref name=\"wild1978\"/> It is therefore Early [[Toarcian]] in age (182.0 to 175.6 mya).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://paleobiodb.org/classic/basicTaxonInfo?taxon_no=65914|publisher=[[Paleobiology Database]]|website=paleobiodb.org|access-date=2019-08-04|title=''Ohmdenosaurus liasicus'' Wild 1978 (sauropod)}}</ref>\nFurther study determined that the fossil belonged to a new genus and species of early sauropod, which Wild named ''Ohmdenosaurus liasicus'' in a 1978 publication. The fossil, which lacks an inventory number, consists of a right [[tibia]] (shinbone) together with the upper bones of the ankle, the [[Talus bone|astragalus]] and the [[calcaneus]]. The bones, disarticulated in the fossil, show signs of weathering, evidence that the animal died on land and that only later were its bones washed into the sea.\n\n== Classification ==\nThe shape of the astragalus - which is not convex on top as it is in derived members of [[Neosauropoda]] - suggests that ''Ohmdenosaurus'' was a very basal sauropod, altrought with the finds on new groups such as [[Lessemsauridae]] the status of ''Ohmdenosaurus'' has slightly changed, being seen as a less basal taxon, related on mostly of the contemporaneous works to the [[Gravisauria]]ns. In 1990 John Stanton McIntosh included ''Ohmdenosaurus'' in the [[Vulcanodontidae]]<ref>McIntosh,  J.S.,  1990.  Sauropoda.  In:  Weishampel,  D.B.,  Dodson,  P.,Osmo \u0301lska, H.  (Eds.), The Dinosauria, University of California Press,Berkeley, pp. 345 \u2013 401.</ref> along with the also controversial genus [[Zizhongosaurus]], but that was based more on the geological age of the two sauropods ([[Toarcian]]) than on a comparative study of the morphology between the genera.<ref name=\"Upchurch, P. 1995\"/> The clade Vulcanodontidae later became a waste-basket taxon for many unrelated basal sauropods. ''Ohmdenosaurus'' has not been confirmed by an exact analysis as a \"Vulcanodontid\" in the modern sense, neither a relative of [[Vulcanodon]]. The latest studies had been suggested that ''Ohmdenosaurus'' is a more basal [[gravisauria]]n, closely related to the Australian genus ''[[Rhoetosaurus]]''. The reasignation of ''Ohmdenosaurus'' was proposed due to similarities such as the presence of a proximal and distal surfaces of the astragalus, or the presence of a rounded cnemial crest nearly identical on ''[[Rhoetosaurus]]''. Astragalus morphology is also present on [[Ferganasaurus]], but in overall morphology, ''Ohmdenosaurus'' is considered the closest genera.<ref>Nair, J. P., & Salisbury, S. W. (2012).
