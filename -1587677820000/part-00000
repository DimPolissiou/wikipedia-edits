Pereyda believed that entertainment formats like webcomics were largely successful, and that if these intellectual properties become popular through them, it could garner more interest in those series and make Namco Bandai interested in creating new games for them.<ref name=\"CBR Interview\"/> Namco Bandai also believed that ShiftyLook was a venue for content creators to collaborate on projects, and to establish working relations with artists and developers for future projects. In an interview with CRB.com, Pereyda stated: \"Basically, what we're doing is taking a look at stuff that's forgotten IPs, stuff that's sleeping, stuff that -- just to be honest -- some people don't care about and thinking what we can do with it. This is a big system and we know that not everything's going to succeed, but if some of them can make it to the big time, we've done a good job. We're casting a really wide net. We're doing different styles, different artists, different kinds of titles, just filling out a whole matrix of different things we can do and then seeing where that goes.\" If the webcomics were successful, Pereyda hoped that content such as merchandise and print versions would be available as well.<ref name=\"CBR Interview\">{{cite web |last1=Sunu |first1=Steve |title=Namco Bandai Gives a ShiftyLook to Comics |url=https://www.cbr.com/namco-bandai-gives-a-shiftylook-to-comics/ |website=[[CBR.com]] |accessdate=23 April 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200423185552/https://www.cbr.com/namco-bandai-gives-a-shiftylook-to-comics/ |archivedate=23 March 2020 |date=9 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:ShiftyLook old logo.svg|thumb|left|The old ShiftyLook logo]]\nShiftyLook officially launched on March 9, 2012.<ref name=\"CBR Interview\"/> Five webcomics were announced to begin production under the company; ''Bravoman'', ''Xevious'', ''Sky Kid'', ''Rocket Fox'', and ''Alien Confidential: Black and White''.

The game can be played against the computer or in a 2 player versus.\n\nA sequel, ''[[Windjammers 2]]'', is planned for release on Nintendo Switch and PC in 2020.<ref>https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-10-23-two-point-hospital-on-consoles-delayed-to-2020</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:NEOGEO Windjammers (Flying Power Disc).png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot.]]\nPlayers choose from one of six playable characters, each with their own unique speed and power ratings and special throws. The player maneuvers around his/her side of the court in any of the 8 cardinal directions (allowing for almost fluid movement in any direction). They must act as the defense and offense of their side, blocking the disc from entering the goal zone, and throwing the disc back to the opponent's side attempting to score. Players throw the disc back and forth (with the speed of the disc generally increasing with each throw) until one of them scores a point, which causes the disc to be reset by the referee, who throws it to the player that was scored on so that they can serve. There are yellow and pink zones with the former being worth 3 points and the latter being 5, with the zones positioning varying for each court. Also not catching the disc while it is in the air (described below) is considered a \"Miss\" and gives 2 points to the opponent.\n\n===Defensive play===\nWhile the opponent holds the disc the player acts defensively by trying to grab the disc and therefore stopping it from entering their goal zone. In order to stop the disc the player simply needs to make contact with it. They can walk into the disc or dive for it with a button press (which is done at almost all times due to the high speeds of the disc). Sometimes the disc may be launched into the air, due to the opponent, the net, barriers, or sometimes bouncing off the player's back, in which a target will appear on the court showing the landing spot of the disc, which can be caught by standing on said target.\n\n===Offensive play===\nWhile the player holds the disc they act offensively by trying to throw it into the goal zone of the opponent. The player can not move while holding the disc, and can not hold it for more than a few seconds. The player points with the joystick in the direction he/she wishes to throw the disc, and presses the primary button. The player can throw it either directly at the opponents goal zone or attempt to bounce the disc off the walls, or barriers (if in a court that contains them).\n\n===Winning the game===\nWhen playing against the computer the player plays one match against each character (with the next characters difficulty increasing each time) until all are defeated, thus winning the game, and when playing 2 player versus one match is played between the two players. A match consists of 3 sets that last 30 seconds by default and up to 99 seconds on the arcade version. (with the timer not stopping when a point is scored unlike most sports). A set is won by the player who has the most points at the end of 30 seconds, or if a player reaches 12 points. A tie gives a win to both players. A match is won when the player wins two sets, if players tie in both of the first two sets (giving each of them two wins) the game enters a sudden death round where the first player to score (regardless of the zone value) wins.\n\n==Ports==\nOn June 22, 2010, the game was released on the [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] in Japan. Following the bankruptcy of Data East, the intellectual rights for this game were acquired by [[Paon DP]], a mobile company formed by some ex-Data East employees.<ref>[https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us/article/53gwj8/the-story-behind-reviving-obscure-neo-geo-classic-windjammers The Story Behind Reviving Obscure Neo Geo Classic 'Windjammers']</ref><ref>[http://www.vc-neogeo.d4e.co.jp/title_neogeo/flyingpowerdisc/index.html Flying Power Disc Virtual Console information from D4 Enterprise]</ref> It was delisted from the Virtual Console on December 24, 2013, making it the only delisted Neo-Geo game for the Virtual Console.\n\nA port of the game with online multiplayer support was released by [[DotEmu]] for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[PlayStation Vita]] on August 29, 2017, with a [[Nintendo Switch]] version on October 23, 2018.<ref>https://gematsu.com/2018/08/windjammers-coming-to-switch-in-2018</ref><ref>https://twitter.com/Dotemu/status/1031512502708912129</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n|title      = Contemporary reception\n|Allgame    = (Arcade) {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"AGARCw\">{{cite web|last=Weiss|first=Brett Alan|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=11552&tab=review|title=Windjammers (Arcade) - Review|work=[[AllGame]]|publisher=[[All Media Network]]|date=1998|access-date=2020-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115073404/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=11552&tab=review|archive-date=2014-11-15|url-status=live}}</ref><br />(Neo Geo) {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"AGNGw\">{{cite web|last=Knight|first=Kyle|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=17086&tab=review|title=Windjammers (Neo Geo Advanced Entertainment System) - Review|work=[[AllGame]]|publisher=[[All Media Network]]|date=2007|access-date=2020-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115031743/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=17086&tab=review|archive-date=2014-11-15|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|Edge       = (Neo Geo) 5 / 10<ref name=\"EDGENGw\">{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://archive.org/stream/Edge_UK_010#page/n77/mode/1up|title=Testscreen - Windjammers (Neo-Geo)|magazine=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]|issue=10|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=July 1994|page=78}}</ref>\n|Fam        = (Neo Geo) 28 / 40<ref name=\"FamNGw\">{{cite magazine|last=|first=|title=NEO GEO GAMES CROSS REVIEW: \u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b0\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af|magazine=[[Famitsu]]|issue=332|publisher=[[ASCII Corporation|ASCII]]|date=April 28, 1995|page=24|lang=ja}}</ref>\n|JXV        = (Neo Geo) 17 / 20<ref name=\"Jv.comNGw\">{{cite web|author=Rockstar78|url=http://www.jeuxvideo.com/articles/0001/00019209-windjammers-test.htm|title=Test de Windjammers sur NEO par jeuxvideo.com|work=[[Jeuxvideo.com]]|publisher=[[FIMALAC#Divisions|Webedia]]|date=December 10, 2013|access-date=2020-04-23|language=fr}}</ref>\n|rev1       = ''[[:fr:Consoles +|Consoles +]]''\n|rev1Score  = (Neo Geo) 75%<ref name=\"C+NGw\">{{cite magazine|last1=Homsy|first1=Richard|last2=Menier|first2=Marc|url=https://www.abandonware-magazines.org/affiche_mag.php?mag=51&num=7659&album=oui|title=Neo Geo Review - Pulstar|magazine=[[:fr:Consoles +|Consoles +]]|issue=33|publisher=[[:fr:M.E.R.7|M.E.R.7]]|date=June 1994|pages=94-95|lang=fr}}</ref>\n|rev2       = ''[[Hobby Consolas]]''\n|rev2Score  = (Neo Geo CD) 89 / 100<ref name=\"HCNGCDw\">{{cite magazine|last=Herranz|first=Sonia|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3AHobbyConsolas_ES_044.pdf&page=84|title=Lo M\u00e1s Nuevo - Neo Geo: Windjammers \u2013 Una De Platillos Volantes|magazine=[[Hobby Consolas]]|issue=44|publisher=Hobby Press|date=May 1995|pages=84-85|lang=es}}</ref>\n|rev3       = ''[[:fr:Joypad (magazine)|Joypad]]''\n|rev3Score  = (Neo Geo) 74%<ref name=\"JpadNGw\">{{cite magazine|last1=Nini|first1=Nourdine|last2=Morisse|first2=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois|url=https://www.abandonware-magazines.org/affiche_mag.php?mag=84&num=1798&album=oui|title=Neo Geo (Version Fran\u00e7aise): Shut Up And Jam \u2013 Windjammers|magazine=[[:fr:Joypad (magazine)|Joypad]]|issue=32|publisher=[[:fr:Yellow Media|Yellow Media]]|date=June 1994|pages=120-121|lang=fr}}</ref>\n|rev4       = ''[[:de:M!

The game can be played against the computer or in a 2 player versus.\n\nA sequel, ''[[Windjammers 2]]'', is planned for release on Nintendo Switch and PC in 2020.<ref>https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-10-23-two-point-hospital-on-consoles-delayed-to-2020</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:NEOGEO Windjammers (Flying Power Disc).png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot.]]\nPlayers choose from one of six playable characters, each with their own unique speed and power ratings and special throws. The player maneuvers around his/her side of the court in any of the 8 cardinal directions (allowing for almost fluid movement in any direction). They must act as the defense and offense of their side, blocking the disc from entering the goal zone, and throwing the disc back to the opponent's side attempting to score. Players throw the disc back and forth (with the speed of the disc generally increasing with each throw) until one of them scores a point, which causes the disc to be reset by the referee, who throws it to the player that was scored on so that they can serve. There are yellow and pink zones with the former being worth 3 points and the latter being 5, with the zones positioning varying for each court. Also not catching the disc while it is in the air (described below) is considered a \"Miss\" and gives 2 points to the opponent.\n\n===Defensive play===\nWhile the opponent holds the disc the player acts defensively by trying to grab the disc and therefore stopping it from entering their goal zone. In order to stop the disc the player simply needs to make contact with it. They can walk into the disc or dive for it with a button press (which is done at almost all times due to the high speeds of the disc). Sometimes the disc may be launched into the air, due to the opponent, the net, barriers, or sometimes bouncing off the player's back, in which a target will appear on the court showing the landing spot of the disc, which can be caught by standing on said target.\n\n===Offensive play===\nWhile the player holds the disc they act offensively by trying to throw it into the goal zone of the opponent. The player can not move while holding the disc, and can not hold it for more than a few seconds. The player points with the joystick in the direction he/she wishes to throw the disc, and presses the primary button. The player can throw it either directly at the opponents goal zone or attempt to bounce the disc off the walls, or barriers (if in a court that contains them).\n\n===Winning the game===\nWhen playing against the computer the player plays one match against each character (with the next characters difficulty increasing each time) until all are defeated, thus winning the game, and when playing 2 player versus one match is played between the two players. A match consists of 3 sets that last 30 seconds by default and up to 99 seconds on the arcade version. (with the timer not stopping when a point is scored unlike most sports). A set is won by the player who has the most points at the end of 30 seconds, or if a player reaches 12 points. A tie gives a win to both players. A match is won when the player wins two sets, if players tie in both of the first two sets (giving each of them two wins) the game enters a sudden death round where the first player to score (regardless of the zone value) wins.\n\n==Ports==\nOn June 22, 2010, the game was released on the [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] in Japan. Following the bankruptcy of Data East, the intellectual rights for this game were acquired by [[Paon DP]], a mobile company formed by some ex-Data East employees.<ref>[https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us/article/53gwj8/the-story-behind-reviving-obscure-neo-geo-classic-windjammers The Story Behind Reviving Obscure Neo Geo Classic 'Windjammers']</ref><ref>[http://www.vc-neogeo.d4e.co.jp/title_neogeo/flyingpowerdisc/index.html Flying Power Disc Virtual Console information from D4 Enterprise]</ref> It was delisted from the Virtual Console on December 24, 2013, making it the only delisted Neo-Geo game for the Virtual Console.\n\nA port of the game with online multiplayer support was released by [[DotEmu]] for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[PlayStation Vita]] on August 29, 2017, with a [[Nintendo Switch]] version on October 23, 2018.<ref>https://gematsu.com/2018/08/windjammers-coming-to-switch-in-2018</ref><ref>https://twitter.com/Dotemu/status/1031512502708912129</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n|title      = Contemporary reception\n|Allgame    = (Arcade) {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"AGARCw\">{{cite web|last=Weiss|first=Brett Alan|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=11552&tab=review|title=Windjammers (Arcade) - Review|work=[[AllGame]]|publisher=[[All Media Network]]|date=1998|access-date=2020-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115073404/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=11552&tab=review|archive-date=2014-11-15|url-status=live}}</ref><br />(Neo Geo) {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"AGNGw\">{{cite web|last=Knight|first=Kyle|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=17086&tab=review|title=Windjammers (Neo Geo Advanced Entertainment System) - Review|work=[[AllGame]]|publisher=[[All Media Network]]|date=2007|access-date=2020-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115031743/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=17086&tab=review|archive-date=2014-11-15|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|Edge       = (Neo Geo) 5 / 10<ref name=\"EDGENGw\">{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://archive.org/stream/Edge_UK_010#page/n77/mode/1up|title=Testscreen - Windjammers (Neo-Geo)|magazine=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]|issue=10|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=July 1994|page=78}}</ref>\n|Fam        = (Neo Geo) 28 / 40<ref name=\"FamNGw\">{{cite magazine|last=|first=|title=NEO GEO GAMES CROSS REVIEW: \u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b0\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af|magazine=[[Famitsu]]|issue=332|publisher=[[ASCII Corporation|ASCII]]|date=April 28, 1995|page=24|lang=ja}}</ref>\n|JXV        = (Neo Geo) 17 / 20<ref name=\"Jv.comNGw\">{{cite web|author=Rockstar78|url=http://www.jeuxvideo.com/articles/0001/00019209-windjammers-test.htm|title=Test de Windjammers sur NEO par jeuxvideo.com|work=[[Jeuxvideo.com]]|publisher=[[FIMALAC#Divisions|Webedia]]|date=December 10, 2013|access-date=2020-04-23|language=fr}}</ref>\n|rev1       = ''[[:fr:Consoles +|Consoles +]]''\n|rev1Score  = (Neo Geo) 75%<ref name=\"C+NGw\">{{cite magazine|last1=Homsy|first1=Richard|last2=Menier|first2=Marc|url=https://www.abandonware-magazines.org/affiche_mag.php?mag=51&num=7659&album=oui|title=Neo Geo Review - Pulstar|magazine=[[:fr:Consoles +|Consoles +]]|issue=33|publisher=[[:fr:M.E.R.7|M.E.R.7]]|date=June 1994|pages=94-95|lang=fr}}</ref>\n|rev2       = ''[[Hobby Consolas]]''\n|rev2Score  = (Neo Geo CD) 89 / 100<ref name=\"HCNGCDw\">{{cite magazine|last=Herranz|first=Sonia|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3AHobbyConsolas_ES_044.pdf&page=84|title=Lo M\u00e1s Nuevo - Neo Geo: Windjammers \u2013 Una De Platillos Volantes|magazine=[[Hobby Consolas]]|issue=44|publisher=Hobby Press|date=May 1995|pages=84-85|lang=es}}</ref>\n|rev3       = ''[[:fr:Joypad (magazine)|Joypad]]''\n|rev3Score  = (Neo Geo) 74%<ref name=\"JpadNGw\">{{cite magazine|last1=Nini|first1=Nourdine|last2=Morisse|first2=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois|url=https://www.abandonware-magazines.org/affiche_mag.php?mag=84&num=1798&album=oui|title=Neo Geo (Version Fran\u00e7aise): Shut Up And Jam \u2013 Windjammers|magazine=[[:fr:Joypad (magazine)|Joypad]]|issue=32|publisher=[[:fr:Yellow Media|Yellow Media]]|date=June 1994|pages=120-121|lang=fr}}</ref>\n|rev4       = ''[[:de:M!

Abolition became more frequent in the 20th century, with the number of monarchies in [[Europe]] falling from 22 to 12 between 1914 and 2015, and the number of [[republic]]s rising from 4 to 34. Decolonisation and independence have resulted in an abolition of monarchies in a number of former colonies such as those created by the United Kingdom.\n\nMotivations for abolition include [[egalitarianism]] and anti-[[social class|class]] views, opposition to undemocratic and hereditary institutions, perception of monarchy as anachronistic or outdated, and opposition to a particular monarch or [[dynasty]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/royal-family-abolish-wedding-queen-monarchy-sexist-institution-why-meghan-markle-a8357266.html|publisher=The Independent|date=19 May 2018|title=We need to abolish the monarchy \u2013 because it\u2019s not fair on anyone, including the royals|access-date=12 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/08/monarchy-is-corrupt-bring-down-house-of-windsor-royal-wedding|publisher=The Guardian|date=9 May 2018|title=\u2018Essentially, the monarchy is corrupt\u2019 \u2013 will republicanism survive Harry and Meghan?|access-date=12 January 2020}}</ref> In many colonies and former colonies, abolishing the influence of the monarchy of a colonising state is considered part of decolonisation. In many [[Commonwealth realms]], the monarchy may be viewed as a foreign institution running counter to the [[national identity]] or [[Sovereignty#Nation-states|national sovereignty]].\n\nIn the 21st century, some countries that are monarchies have significant [[republicanism|republican]] movements, such as [[Republicanism in Spain|Spain]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1281030/royal-families-the-countries-that-most-want-to-abolish-the-monarchy/|publisher=QZ|date=18 May 2018|title=Royal families: The countries that feel the strongest about abolishing their monarchies|access-date=12 January 2020}}</ref> and [[Republicanism in Australia|Australia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dhakatribune.com/uncategorized/2020/01/11/does-the-monarchy-have-a-future|publisher=Dhaka Tribune|date=11 January 2020|title=Does the monarchy have a future?|access-date=12 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nSince the beginning of the 20th century, restorations of monarchies have been comparatively rare. Examples are the [[monarchy of Spain]], which since 1947 had been a regency with a vacant throne but was restored in 1975; the reinstatement in 1991 of the Emir of [[Kuwait]] following abolition in 1990 and the [[Gulf War]]; and a 1993 transition of [[Cambodia]] from a [[People's Republic of Kampuchea|Marxist-Leninist republic]] to an [[elective monarchy]].\n\n== 17th-century reawakening of classical western anti-monarchy tradition ==\n\nUnder the leadership of [[Oliver Cromwell]], in 1649, [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] was tried for high treason, convicted and executed. This marked the conclusion of the [[English Civil War]] which resulted in the [[Parliament of England]] overthrowing the [[List of English monarchs|English monarchy]], and initiating [[Interregnum (1649\u20131660)|a period of an English republic]] (known as the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]). After eleven years, in 1660, [[English Restoration|a limited monarchy was restored]] but moderated by an independent Parliament.<ref>\"The Restoration of a Limited Monarchy in England: Definition & History, \" Study.com, last accessed Dec 28, 2019. https://study.com/academy/lesson/the-restoration-of-a-limited-monarchy-in-england.html</ref><ref>Haley, K.H.D.

With the [[Declaration of Independence]] in 1776, anti-monarchical propaganda resulted in violent protests that systematically removed symbols of monarchy. For instance, an equestrian statue of [[George III]] in New York City was toppled. Parliamentary [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist]]s were particularly affected by partisan attacks, with tens of thousands leaving for Canada.<ref>{{cite book |author= Maya Jasanoff |title= Liberty's Exiles: American Loyalists in the Revolutionary World |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uGKsn09oVwQC&pg=PA357 |year= 2012|publisher= Random House |page= 357 }}</ref> Property that remained was confiscated by each of thirteen newly created States through newly passed laws.<ref>Mark Boonshoft \"Dispossessing Loyalists and Redistributing Property in Revolutionary New York,\" The New York Public Library, September 19, 2016, Last accessed December 26, 2019. https://www.nypl.org/blog/2016/09/19/loyalist-property-confiscation</ref> Artifacts from the colonial period depicting the British monarchy are seldom found in the United States.

[[Napoleon]], initially a hero of the Republican revolution, crowned himself emperor in 1804, only to be replaced by the [[Bourbon Restoration]] in 1815, which in turn was replaced by the more liberal [[July Monarchy]] in 1830. The [[1848 Revolution]] was a clearer anti-monarchic uprising that replaced the succession of royal leaders with the short-lived [[Second French Republic]]. [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte]] established the [[Second French Empire]] (1852\u20131870), retaining republican aspects while placing himself in the center of the state until the losses in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] led to his fall, resulting in the [[French Third Republic]] and the definitive end of the monarchy in France.\n\n== 19th-century expansion and then collapse of colonial monarchies ==\n=== Africa === \n'''Madagascar'''\nThe monarchy of Madagascar, known as the [[Merina Kingdom]], came to an end in 1897 when France made it a colony and overthrew Queen [[Ranavalona III]].\n\n=== Americas ===\n'''Mexico'''\nThe First Mexican Empire existed from the September 1821 [[Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire|Declaration of Independence]] until [[Agustin I of Mexico|the emperor]]'s abdication in March 1823. The [[Provisional Government of Mexico (1823\u201324)|Provisional Government]] took power and the [[First Mexican Republic]] was proclaimed in 1824. Due to [[Second French intervention in Mexico|French intervention]] under [[Napoleon III]], the [[Second Mexican Empire]] lasted from 1864 to 1867, when it collapsed and its Emperor, [[Maximilian I of Mexico]], was executed. \n\n'''Brazil'''\nIn Brazil, the [[Empire of Brazil|monarchy]] was abolished in 1889, when Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] was overthrown by a [[Proclamation of the Republic (Brazil)|republican military coup]] (the status of the republic was confirmed by [[1993 Brazilian constitutional referendum|a plebiscite in 1993 that resulted in 86% of the votes to the republican government]]). \n\n=== Asia ===\n'''Burma'''\nThe monarchy of Burma was abolished in 1885 when the last king, [[Thibaw Min]], lost his throne and the country was annexed by Britain. \n\n'''South Asia'''\nIn 1858 the [[Mughal Empire]] came to an end after losing a war against Britain, and its Emperor, [[Bahadur Shah II]], lost his throne. \n\n=== Europe ===\n'''Italy'''\nBetween 1859 and 1861, four monarchies in Southern Europe ceased to exist ([[Duchy of Parma|Parma]], [[Duchy of Modena and Reggio|Modena]], [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]] and [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|the Two Sicilies]]) when they all became part of the new [[Kingdom of Italy]]. \n\n'''Spain'''\nIn Spain monarchy was abolished from 1873 to 1874 by the [[First Spanish Republic]], but then restored until 1931. \n\n=== Pacific === \n'''Hawaii'''\nIn 1893 foreign business leaders overthrew Queen [[Lili\u02bbuokalani]] of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]]. They established a [[Republic of Hawaii|republic]], which was annexed by the United States in 1898.\n\n'''Tahiti'''\nThe monarchy of Tahiti came to an end in 1880 when France made it a colony and overthrew King [[P\u014dmare V]].\n\n== 20th-century global end of monarchies ==\n\n=== Nationalism ===\n'''China'''\nThe [[monarchy of China]] ceased to exist in 1912 when the [[Xinhai Revolution]] led by [[Sun Yat-sen]] succeeded in overthrowing the [[Puyi|Xuantong Emperor]]; this marked the end of the [[Qing dynasty]] and the start of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]]. In 1915, [[Yuan Shikai]] proclaimed the [[Empire of China (1915\u20131916)|Empire of China]] with himself as the emperor; the regime failed to gain legitimacy and collapsed three months later. In 1917, the Qing loyalist [[Zhang Xun]] sought to revive the Qing dynasty and briefly reinstalled the Xuantong Emperor to the Chinese throne; this attempt is known as the \"[[Manchu Restoration]]\" in historiography.\n\nDuring the Xinhai Revolution, [[Outer Mongolia]] declared independence from the Qing dynasty of China in the [[Mongolian Revolution of 1911]]. The [[Bogd Khanate of Mongolia]] was subsequently proclaimed, although the Republic of China laid claims to Outer Mongolia and was widely recognized by the international community as having sovereignty over it. In 1924, the [[Mongolian People's Republic]] was established, bringing an end to the monarchy in Mongolia.\n\n'''Greece'''\nThroughout [[Greece]]'s eventful modern history, the monarchy was toppled and restored several times between and after the two World Wars. The last king, [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II]], was forced into exile after a [[1967 Greek coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] in 1967 and the republic was proclaimed in [[1973 Greek republic referendum|1973 by the then-ruling military dictatorship]]. The final abolition of the monarchy was confirmed overwhelmingly after constitutional legality was restored, by free [[1974 Greek republic referendum|referendum in 1974]].\n\n'''Italy, Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia'''\nWorld War II saw another spate of abolition. In 1939 [[Italian invasion of Albania|Italy invaded Albania]] and removed the reigning self-proclaimed [[King Zog]] and instated their own King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]] as its new monarch. [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], along with the eastern European monarchies of [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920-46)|Hungary]] and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] joined with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] in World War II against the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], the [[Western allies]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. As the [[Axis powers]] came to a defeat in the war, communist partisans in [[Yugoslavia#Yugoslavia during World War II|occupied Yugoslavia]] and [[Military history of Albania during World War II|occupied Albania]] seized power and ended the monarchies. Communists in Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania removed their monarchies with strong backing by the Soviet Union, which had many troops and supporters placed there during the course of the war. Through this, [[Peter II of Yugoslavia]], [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Simeon II of Bulgaria]] and [[Michael of Romania|Michael I of Romania]] all lost their thrones. King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]] had switched sides during the war in favor of the western allies, but a [[1946 Italian constitutional referendum|referendum in 1946]] ended the short reign of his son King [[Umberto II of Italy|Umberto II]] and the Italian monarchy ceased to exist.\n\n=== Republicanism ===\nIn a [[1999 Australian republic referendum|1999 referendum]], the voters of Australia rejected a proposal to replace the constitutional monarchy with a republic with a president appointed by Parliament. The proposal was rejected in all states, with only the [[Australian Capital Territory]] voting in favor. Though polling consistently showed a majority in favour of a republic, the result of the referendum was attributed to a split among republicans between those who supported the presented model and those who supported a directly elected president.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turnbull|first=Malcolm|title=Fighting for the Republic|location=South Yarra|publisher=Hardie Grant Books|year=1999|page=250}}</ref><ref name=\"Vizard\">{{Cite book|title=Two Weeks in Lilliput: Bear Baiting and Backbiting at the Constitutional Convention|author=[[Steve Vizard]]|publisher=Penguin|location=Ringwood (Vic)|year=1998|isbn=0-14-027983-0}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Higley|first=John|author2=Case, Rhonda|title=Australia: The Politics of Becoming a Republic|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=11|issue=3|date=July 2000|pages=136\u2013150|issn=1045-5736|doi=10.1353/jod.2000.0058}}</ref><ref name=\"Steketee\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/ten-years-after-the-referendum-we-are-no-closer-to-a-republic/story-e6frg6qo-1225792964973|title=Ten years after the referendum, we are no closer to a republic|last=Steketee|first=Mike|work=[[The Australian]]|date=31 October 2009|accessdate=6 November 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Communism and socialism===\n'''Ethiopia'''\nEmperor [[Haile Selassie I]] was overthrown in 1974 as a result of a [[Ethiopian Revolution|Marxist coup]], ending almost 3000 years of monarchical rule in Ethiopia. \n\n'''Germany, Austria-Hungary, Ottoman Empire, Montenegro'''\nThe defeated [[German Empire|German]], [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empires saw the abolition of their monarchies in the close aftermath of the war, ending the reigns of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], [[Charles I of Austria|Charles I]] and [[Mehmed VI]] respectively. The monarchs of the constituent states within the German Empire, most importantly [[Ludwig III of Bavaria]], [[Frederick Augustus III of Saxony]] and [[William II of W\u00fcrttemberg|Wilhelm II of W\u00fcrttemberg]], soon abdicated. During the war, monarchies were planned for [[Poland]] ([[Kingdom of Poland (1917\u20131918)|Kingdom of Poland]]), the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] (to have a [[Kingdom of Finland (1918)|Finnish King]]), and [[Lithuania]] ([[Mindaugas II of Lithuania]]), with a [[protectorate]]-like dependency of [[Germany]]. Both intended kings renounced their thrones after Germany's defeat in November 1918. King [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]] lost his throne when the country became a part of Yugoslavia in 1918.\n\n'''Indochina'''\nIn 1945, during the [[August Revolution]], [[B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i]] abdicated under the pressure of the [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh]] led by [[Ho Chi Minh]]. This marked the end of the [[Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty]] and the Vietnamese monarchy. From 1949 to 1955, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i served as the ''Qu\u1ed1c Tr\u01b0\u1edfng'' (lit. \"Chief of State\") of the [[State of Vietnam]] and did not receive the title of ''Ho\u00e0ng \u0110\u1ebf'' (lit. \"Emperor\"). \n\nPolitical upheaval and Communist insurrection put an end to the monarchies of [[Indochina]] after World War II: a short-lived attempt to leave a monarchical form of government in post-colonial [[South Vietnam]] came to naught in a [[1955 State of Vietnam referendum|fraudulent 1955 referendum]], a [[1970 Cambodian coup|military coup]] overthrew the kingless monarchy in Cambodia in 1970 and a [[Taking of Vientiane|Communist takeover]] ended the monarchy in Laos in 1975. Cambodia's monarchy later saw an unexpected rebirth under an internationally mediated peace settlement with a former king [[Norodom Sihanouk]] being restored as a figurehead in 1993.\n\n'''Middle East'''\nThat of Iran was abolished by the [[Islamic revolution]] of 1979 overthrowing [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]].\n\n'''Portugal'''\nThe monarchy of Portugal was also overthrown in 1910 (5 October), two years after the assassination of King [[Carlos I of Portugal|Carlos I]], ending the reign of [[Manuel II of Portugal|Manuel II]], who died in exile in England (1932), without issue.\n\n'''Russia'''\nWorld War I led to perhaps the greatest spate of abolitions of monarchies in history. The conditions inside Russia and the poor performance in the war gave rise to a [[February Revolution|revolution]] which toppled the entire institution of the monarchy, followed by a [[October Revolution|second revolution]] against that government in October of the same year that executed Tsar ([[Imperator#Post-Roman use|Imperator]] (\u0418\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044a)) [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] and implemented a [[Marxist-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] government.\n\n'''Sikkim'''\nKing [[Palden Thondup Namgyal]] of Sikkim lost his throne in 1975 when the country became a state of India following a [[1975 Sikkimese monarchy referendum|referendum]].\n\n'''Spain'''\nIn Spain, the monarchy was again abolished in 1931 by the [[Second Spanish Republic]] (1931\u20131939). In 1947, [[Spain under Franco|General Franco]] declared Spain a [[Monarchy|realm]], and appointed [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos of Bourbon]] his successor in 1969. The Prince of Spain became king at Franco's death in 1975, and [[constitutional monarchy]] was restored in 1978 under him.\n\n=== Dictatorship === \n'''Egypt'''\nThe monarchy of Egypt was abolished in 1953, after the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|revolution of 1952]], which caused King [[Farouk of Egypt|Farouk I]] to abdicate in favor of his infant son [[Fuad II of Egypt|Fuad II]]. \n\n'''Tunisia'''\nThe monarchy of Tunisia ended in 1957 when [[Muhammad VIII al-Amin]] lost his throne.\n\n'''Iraq'''\nThe monarchy Iraq ended in 1958 when King [[Faisal II of Iraq|Faisal II]] [[14 July Revolution|was killed and a republic proclaimed]]. \n\n'''Yemen'''\nThe monarchy of Yemen was abolished in 1962 when King [[Muhammad al-Badr]] was overthrown in a coup, although he continued to resist his opponents until 1970. \n\n'''Libya'''\nKing [[Idris of Libya]] was overthrown by a military coup led by [[Muammar Gaddafi]] in 1969. The monarchy of Afghanistan was abolished in 1973 after a coup d'\u00e9tat overthrew King [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]].\n\n===Imperialism expansion and decolonisation ===\n'''Commonwealth of Nations'''\nMany monarchies were abolished in the middle of the 20th century or later as part of the process of decolonization. The monarchies of India, Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Tanganyika, Uganda, Guyana, and Malawi were abolished shortly after they became independent of the United Kingdom, while remaining within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. The monarchy of Ireland was not abolished following the Ireland war of independence in the 1920s. The monarchy was abolished by the [[Republic of Ireland Act]] of 1948, which came into force in 1949. Some [[Commonwealth realm]]s waited a little longer before abolishing their monarchies: Pakistan became a republic in 1956 and South Africa in 1961. Gambia abolished its monarchy in 1970, while Sierra Leone became a republic in 1971, as did Sri Lanka in 1972, Malta in 1974, Trinidad and Tobago in 1976, and Fiji in 1987. The latest country to become a [[Commonwealth republic|republic within the Commonwealth]] was Mauritius in 1992.\n\n'''Japan'''\nA unique result of World War II was that the Emperor [[Hirohito]] of Japan became a figurehead instead of losing the throne altogether. The Japanese Emperor had held a debated but important role in Japan's warfare against an alliance of nations. The reduction in stature from a [[Hirohito#Imperial status|divine being]] to a figurehead was at the direction of the United States.\n\n'''Korea'''\nIn 1910 the last emperor of Korea, [[Emperor Sunjong of the Korean Empire|Sunjong]], lost his throne when the country was annexed by Japan. However, the Korean royal family was [[Mediatisation|mediatized]] as a puppet family within the Japanese imperial family. Many of the Korean royals were forcibly re-educated in Japan and forced to marry Japanese royalty and aristocrats to meld the ruling families of the two empires. With the abolition of the Japanese aristocracy and cadet branches of the imperial family, the Korean royals officially lost their remaining status.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n'''South Asia'''\nThe independence of the Indian subcontinent from direct British rule in 1947 posed a unique problem. From 1858, when the British government had assumed direct rule over the subcontinent, it had been governed as a quasi-federation, with most of the subcontinent (known as British India), under the direct rule of the British sovereign. The remainder of the subcontinent, however, was under a form of indirect rule through its division and subdivision into over 500 [[Constituent monarchies|subnational monarchies]], known as [[princely states]]; each was ruled by a prince in a subsidiary alliance with the British government. The princely states ranged from powerful and largely independent principalities such as Hyderabad or Mysore, with a high level of autonomy, to tiny fiefdoms a few dozen acres (in the low tens of hectares) in size. The resulting imperial structure was broadly similar to that of the German Empire before the First World War.\n\nIn 1947, it was agreed that the Indian subcontinent would be partitioned into the independent British dominions of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], with the princely states acceding to one nation or the other. The accession process proceeded smoothly, with the notable exception of four of the most influential principalities. The Muslim ruler of the Hindu-majority state of Junagadh ruler acceded to Pakistan, but his decision was overruled by the Indian government, while Hyderabad chose to be independent, but was forcibly annexed to India in 1948. The Hindu ruler of Jammu and Kashmir, among the largest and most powerful of the principalities, but with a Muslim-majority population, initially held off on a decision. In the autumn of 1947, an invading force from Pakistan frightened the ruler into acceding to India. The ruler of Kalat, in Baluchistan, declared his independence in 1947, after which the state was forcibly merged with Pakistan, resulting in an insurgency persisting to this day. With the promulgation of the Indian constitution in 1950, India abolished its monarchy under the British crown and became a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations, followed by Pakistan in 1956; as a result of both developments, the majority of the princes formally lost their sovereign rights. A few remaining principalities in Pakistan retained their autonomy until 1969 when they finally acceded to Pakistan. The Indian government formally derecognized its princely families in 1971, followed by Pakistan in 1972.\n\n=== Monarchism ===\nIn a [[1993 Brazilian constitutional referendum|referendum]] in Brazil in 1993, voters rejected an attempt to restore the country's monarchy. Unsuccessful efforts to restore the monarchies of some of the Balkan states in the former Eastern Bloc continue. Former King [[Michael of Romania]] and [[Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia|Prince Alexander]] of Serbia have been allowed to return, gained some popularity, played largely apolitical public roles, but never came close to being restored to their ancestral thrones. However, in Bulgaria, [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]], who was deposed from the Bulgarian throne in 1946, was elected and recently served as the Prime Minister of his country from 2001 to 2005. The only formerly socialist country to have held a referendum on the monarchy was Albania where the claimant to his father's throne, the self-styled [[Leka, Crown Prince of Albania (born 1939)|Leka I]], [[1997 Albanian monarchy referendum|lost by a 2/3 majority]], though it was later revealed upon Leka\u2019s death in 2011 by the Albanian government that the referendum had been rigged in favour of the republic. {{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n=== New monarchies in the 20th century ===\nThe 20th century also saw the formation of a number of new monarchies that still exists to this day such as: [[Bhutan]] (1907), [[Jordan]] (1921), [[Saudi Arabia]] (1932) & [[Malaysia]] (1957).\n\n=== Summary table of the 20th century ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=\"2\"|Country\n!

Abolition became more frequent in the 20th century, with the number of monarchies in [[Europe]] falling from 22 to 12 between 1914 and 2015, and the number of [[republic]]s rising from 4 to 34. Decolonisation and independence have resulted in an abolition of monarchies in a number of former colonies such as those created by the United Kingdom.\n\nMotivations for abolition include [[egalitarianism]] and anti-[[social class|class]] views, opposition to undemocratic and hereditary institutions, perception of monarchy as anachronistic or outdated, and opposition to a particular monarch or [[dynasty]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/royal-family-abolish-wedding-queen-monarchy-sexist-institution-why-meghan-markle-a8357266.html|publisher=The Independent|date=19 May 2018|title=We need to abolish the monarchy \u2013 because it\u2019s not fair on anyone, including the royals|access-date=12 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/08/monarchy-is-corrupt-bring-down-house-of-windsor-royal-wedding|publisher=The Guardian|date=9 May 2018|title=\u2018Essentially, the monarchy is corrupt\u2019 \u2013 will republicanism survive Harry and Meghan?|access-date=12 January 2020}}</ref> In many colonies and former colonies, abolishing the influence of the monarchy of a colonising state is considered part of decolonisation.

Examples are the [[monarchy of Spain]], which since 1947 had been a regency with a vacant throne but was restored in 1975; the reinstatement in 1991 of the Emir of [[Kuwait]] following abolition in 1990 and the [[Gulf War]]; and a 1993 transition of [[Cambodia]] from a [[People's Republic of Kampuchea|Marxist-Leninist republic]] to an [[elective monarchy]].\n\n== 17th-century reawakening of classical western anti-monarchy tradition ==\n\nUnder the leadership of [[Oliver Cromwell]], in 1649, [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] was tried for high treason, convicted and executed. This marked the conclusion of the [[English Civil War]] which resulted in the [[Parliament of England]] overthrowing the [[List of English monarchs|English monarchy]], and initiating [[Interregnum (1649\u20131660)|a period of an English republic]] (known as the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]).

With the [[Declaration of Independence]] in 1776, anti-monarchical propaganda resulted in violent protests that systematically removed symbols of monarchy. For instance, an equestrian statue of [[George III]] in New York City was toppled. Parliamentary [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist]]s were particularly affected by partisan attacks, with tens of thousands leaving for Canada.<ref>{{cite book |author= Maya Jasanoff |title= Liberty's Exiles: American Loyalists in the Revolutionary World |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uGKsn09oVwQC&pg=PA357 |year= 2012|publisher= Random House |page= 357 }}</ref> Property that remained was confiscated by each of thirteen newly created States through newly passed laws.<ref>Mark Boonshoft \"Dispossessing Loyalists and Redistributing Property in Revolutionary New York,\" The New York Public Library, September 19, 2016, Last accessed December 26, 2019. https://www.nypl.org/blog/2016/09/19/loyalist-property-confiscation</ref> Artifacts from the colonial period depicting the British monarchy are seldom found in the United States.

[[Napoleon]], initially a hero of the Republican revolution, crowned himself emperor in 1804, only to be replaced by the [[Bourbon Restoration]] in 1815, which in turn was replaced by the more liberal [[July Monarchy]] in 1830. The [[1848 Revolution]] was a clearer anti-monarchic uprising that replaced the succession of royal leaders with the short-lived [[Second French Republic]]. [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte]] established the [[Second French Empire]] (1852\u20131870), retaining republican aspects while placing himself in the center of the state until the losses in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] led to his fall, resulting in the [[French Third Republic]] and the definitive end of the monarchy in France.\n\n== 19th-century expansion and then collapse of colonial monarchies ==\n=== Africa === \n'''Madagascar'''\nThe monarchy of Madagascar, known as the [[Merina Kingdom]], came to an end in 1897 when France made it a colony and overthrew Queen [[Ranavalona III]].\n\n=== Americas ===\n'''Mexico'''\nThe First Mexican Empire existed from the September 1821 [[Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire|Declaration of Independence]] until [[Agustin I of Mexico|the emperor]]'s abdication in March 1823. The [[Provisional Government of Mexico (1823\u201324)|Provisional Government]] took power and the [[First Mexican Republic]] was proclaimed in 1824. Due to [[Second French intervention in Mexico|French intervention]] under [[Napoleon III]], the [[Second Mexican Empire]] lasted from 1864 to 1867, when it collapsed and its Emperor, [[Maximilian I of Mexico]], was executed. \n\n'''Brazil'''\nIn Brazil, the [[Empire of Brazil|monarchy]] was abolished in 1889, when Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] was overthrown by a [[Proclamation of the Republic (Brazil)|republican military coup]] (the status of the republic was confirmed by [[1993 Brazilian constitutional referendum|a plebiscite in 1993 that resulted in 86% of the votes to the republican government]]). \n\n=== Asia ===\n'''Burma'''\nThe monarchy of Burma was abolished in 1885 when the last king, [[Thibaw Min]], lost his throne and the country was annexed by Britain. \n\n'''South Asia'''\nIn 1858 the [[Mughal Empire]] came to an end after losing a war against Britain, and its Emperor, [[Bahadur Shah II]], lost his throne. \n\n=== Europe ===\n'''Italy'''\nBetween 1859 and 1861, four monarchies in Southern Europe ceased to exist ([[Duchy of Parma|Parma]], [[Duchy of Modena and Reggio|Modena]], [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]] and [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|the Two Sicilies]]) when they all became part of the new [[Kingdom of Italy]]. \n\n'''Spain'''\nIn Spain monarchy was abolished from 1873 to 1874 by the [[First Spanish Republic]], but then restored until 1931. \n\n=== Pacific === \n'''Hawaii'''\nIn 1893 foreign business leaders overthrew Queen [[Lili\u02bbuokalani]] of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]]. They established a [[Republic of Hawaii|republic]], which was annexed by the United States in 1898.\n\n'''Tahiti'''\nThe monarchy of Tahiti came to an end in 1880 when France made it a colony and overthrew King [[P\u014dmare V]].\n\n== 20th-century global end of monarchies ==\n\n=== Nationalism ===\n'''China'''\nThe [[monarchy of China]] ceased to exist in 1912 when the [[Xinhai Revolution]] led by [[Sun Yat-sen]] succeeded in overthrowing the [[Puyi|Xuantong Emperor]]; this marked the end of the [[Qing dynasty]] and the start of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]]. In 1915, [[Yuan Shikai]] proclaimed the [[Empire of China (1915\u20131916)|Empire of China]] with himself as the emperor; the regime failed to gain legitimacy and collapsed three months later. In 1917, the Qing loyalist [[Zhang Xun]] sought to revive the Qing dynasty and briefly reinstalled the Xuantong Emperor to the Chinese throne; this attempt is known as the \"[[Manchu Restoration]]\" in historiography.\n\nDuring the Xinhai Revolution, [[Outer Mongolia]] declared independence from the Qing dynasty of China in the [[Mongolian Revolution of 1911]]. The [[Bogd Khanate of Mongolia]] was subsequently proclaimed, although the Republic of China laid claims to Outer Mongolia and was widely recognized by the international community as having sovereignty over it. In 1924, the [[Mongolian People's Republic]] was established, bringing an end to the monarchy in Mongolia.\n\n'''Greece'''\nThroughout [[Greece]]'s eventful modern history, the monarchy was toppled and restored several times between and after the two World Wars. The last king, [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II]], was forced into exile after a [[1967 Greek coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] in 1967 and the republic was proclaimed in [[1973 Greek republic referendum|1973 by the then-ruling military dictatorship]]. The final abolition of the monarchy was confirmed overwhelmingly after constitutional legality was restored, by free [[1974 Greek republic referendum|referendum in 1974]].\n\n'''Italy, Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia'''\nWorld War II saw another spate of abolition. In 1939 [[Italian invasion of Albania|Italy invaded Albania]] and removed the reigning self-proclaimed [[King Zog]] and instated their own King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]] as its new monarch. [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], along with the eastern European monarchies of [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920-46)|Hungary]] and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] joined with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] in World War II against the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], the [[Western allies]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. As the [[Axis powers]] came to a defeat in the war, communist partisans in [[Yugoslavia#Yugoslavia during World War II|occupied Yugoslavia]] and [[Military history of Albania during World War II|occupied Albania]] seized power and ended the monarchies. Communists in Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania removed their monarchies with strong backing by the Soviet Union, which had many troops and supporters placed there during the course of the war. Through this, [[Peter II of Yugoslavia]], [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Simeon II of Bulgaria]] and [[Michael of Romania|Michael I of Romania]] all lost their thrones. King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]] had switched sides during the war in favor of the western allies, but a [[1946 Italian constitutional referendum|referendum in 1946]] ended the short reign of his son King [[Umberto II of Italy|Umberto II]] and the Italian monarchy ceased to exist.\n\n=== Republicanism ===\nIn a [[1999 Australian republic referendum|1999 referendum]], the voters of Australia rejected a proposal to replace the constitutional monarchy with a republic with a president appointed by Parliament. The proposal was rejected in all states, with only the [[Australian Capital Territory]] voting in favor. Though polling consistently showed a majority in favour of a republic, the result of the referendum was attributed to a split among republicans between those who supported the presented model and those who supported a directly elected president.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turnbull|first=Malcolm|title=Fighting for the Republic|location=South Yarra|publisher=Hardie Grant Books|year=1999|page=250}}</ref><ref name=\"Vizard\">{{Cite book|title=Two Weeks in Lilliput: Bear Baiting and Backbiting at the Constitutional Convention|author=[[Steve Vizard]]|publisher=Penguin|location=Ringwood (Vic)|year=1998|isbn=0-14-027983-0}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Higley|first=John|author2=Case, Rhonda|title=Australia: The Politics of Becoming a Republic|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=11|issue=3|date=July 2000|pages=136\u2013150|issn=1045-5736|doi=10.1353/jod.2000.0058}}</ref><ref name=\"Steketee\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/ten-years-after-the-referendum-we-are-no-closer-to-a-republic/story-e6frg6qo-1225792964973|title=Ten years after the referendum, we are no closer to a republic|last=Steketee|first=Mike|work=[[The Australian]]|date=31 October 2009|accessdate=6 November 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Communism and socialism===\n'''Ethiopia'''\nEmperor [[Haile Selassie I]] was overthrown in 1974 as a result of a [[Ethiopian Revolution|Marxist coup]], ending almost 3000 years of monarchical rule in Ethiopia. \n\n'''Germany, Austria-Hungary, Ottoman Empire, Montenegro'''\nThe defeated [[German Empire|German]], [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empires saw the abolition of their monarchies in the close aftermath of the war, ending the reigns of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], [[Charles I of Austria|Charles I]] and [[Mehmed VI]] respectively. The monarchs of the constituent states within the German Empire, most importantly [[Ludwig III of Bavaria]], [[Frederick Augustus III of Saxony]] and [[William II of W\u00fcrttemberg|Wilhelm II of W\u00fcrttemberg]], soon abdicated. During the war, monarchies were planned for [[Poland]] ([[Kingdom of Poland (1917\u20131918)|Kingdom of Poland]]), the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] (to have a [[Kingdom of Finland (1918)|Finnish King]]), and [[Lithuania]] ([[Mindaugas II of Lithuania]]), with a [[protectorate]]-like dependency of [[Germany]]. Both intended kings renounced their thrones after Germany's defeat in November 1918. King [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]] lost his throne when the country became a part of Yugoslavia in 1918.\n\n'''Indochina'''\nIn 1945, during the [[August Revolution]], [[B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i]] abdicated under the pressure of the [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh]] led by [[Ho Chi Minh]]. This marked the end of the [[Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty]] and the Vietnamese monarchy. From 1949 to 1955, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i served as the ''Qu\u1ed1c Tr\u01b0\u1edfng'' (lit. \"Chief of State\") of the [[State of Vietnam]] and did not receive the title of ''Ho\u00e0ng \u0110\u1ebf'' (lit. \"Emperor\"). \n\nPolitical upheaval and Communist insurrection put an end to the monarchies of [[Indochina]] after World War II: a short-lived attempt to leave a monarchical form of government in post-colonial [[South Vietnam]] came to naught in a [[1955 State of Vietnam referendum|fraudulent 1955 referendum]], a [[1970 Cambodian coup|military coup]] overthrew the kingless monarchy in Cambodia in 1970 and a [[Taking of Vientiane|Communist takeover]] ended the monarchy in Laos in 1975. Cambodia's monarchy later saw an unexpected rebirth under an internationally mediated peace settlement with a former king [[Norodom Sihanouk]] being restored as a figurehead in 1993.\n\n'''Middle East'''\nThat of Iran was abolished by the [[Islamic revolution]] of 1979 overthrowing [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]].\n\n'''Portugal'''\nThe monarchy of Portugal was also overthrown in 1910 (5 October), two years after the assassination of King [[Carlos I of Portugal|Carlos I]], ending the reign of [[Manuel II of Portugal|Manuel II]], who died in exile in England (1932), without issue.\n\n'''Russia'''\nWorld War I led to perhaps the greatest spate of abolitions of monarchies in history. The conditions inside Russia and the poor performance in the war gave rise to a [[February Revolution|revolution]] which toppled the entire institution of the monarchy, followed by a [[October Revolution|second revolution]] against that government in October of the same year that executed Tsar ([[Imperator#Post-Roman use|Imperator]] (\u0418\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044a)) [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] and implemented a [[Marxist-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] government.\n\n'''Sikkim'''\nKing [[Palden Thondup Namgyal]] of Sikkim lost his throne in 1975 when the country became a state of India following a [[1975 Sikkimese monarchy referendum|referendum]].\n\n'''Spain'''\nIn Spain, the monarchy was again abolished in 1931 by the [[Second Spanish Republic]] (1931\u20131939). In 1947, [[Spain under Franco|General Franco]] declared Spain a [[Monarchy|realm]], and appointed [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos of Bourbon]] his successor in 1969. The Prince of Spain became king at Franco's death in 1975, and [[constitutional monarchy]] was restored in 1978 under him.\n\n=== Dictatorship === \n'''Egypt'''\nThe monarchy of Egypt was abolished in 1953, after the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|revolution of 1952]], which caused King [[Farouk of Egypt|Farouk I]] to abdicate in favor of his infant son [[Fuad II of Egypt|Fuad II]]. \n\n'''Tunisia'''\nThe monarchy of Tunisia ended in 1957 when [[Muhammad VIII al-Amin]] lost his throne.\n\n'''Iraq'''\nThe monarchy Iraq ended in 1958 when King [[Faisal II of Iraq|Faisal II]] [[14 July Revolution|was killed and a republic proclaimed]]. \n\n'''Yemen'''\nThe monarchy of Yemen was abolished in 1962 when King [[Muhammad al-Badr]] was overthrown in a coup, although he continued to resist his opponents until 1970. \n\n'''Libya'''\nKing [[Idris of Libya]] was overthrown by a military coup led by [[Muammar Gaddafi]] in 1969. The monarchy of Afghanistan was abolished in 1973 after a coup d'\u00e9tat overthrew King [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]].\n\n===Imperialism expansion and decolonisation ===\n'''Commonwealth of Nations'''\nMany monarchies were abolished in the middle of the 20th century or later as part of the process of decolonization. The monarchies of India, Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Tanganyika, Uganda, Guyana, and Malawi were abolished shortly after they became independent of the United Kingdom, while remaining within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. The monarchy of Ireland was not abolished following the Ireland war of independence in the 1920s. The monarchy was abolished by the [[Republic of Ireland Act]] of 1948, which came into force in 1949. Some [[Commonwealth realm]]s waited a little longer before abolishing their monarchies: Pakistan became a republic in 1956 and South Africa in 1961. Gambia abolished its monarchy in 1970, while Sierra Leone became a republic in 1971, as did Sri Lanka in 1972, Malta in 1974, Trinidad and Tobago in 1976, and Fiji in 1987. The latest country to become a [[Commonwealth republic|republic within the Commonwealth]] was Mauritius in 1992.\n\n'''Japan'''\nA unique result of World War II was that the Emperor [[Hirohito]] of Japan became a figurehead instead of losing the throne altogether. The Japanese Emperor had held a debated but important role in Japan's warfare against an alliance of nations. The reduction in stature from a [[Hirohito#Imperial status|divine being]] to a figurehead was at the direction of the United States.\n\n'''Korea'''\nIn 1910 the last emperor of Korea, [[Emperor Sunjong of the Korean Empire|Sunjong]], lost his throne when the country was annexed by Japan. However, the Korean royal family was [[Mediatisation|mediatized]] as a puppet family within the Japanese imperial family. Many of the Korean royals were forcibly re-educated in Japan and forced to marry Japanese royalty and aristocrats to meld the ruling families of the two empires. With the abolition of the Japanese aristocracy and cadet branches of the imperial family, the Korean royals officially lost their remaining status.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n'''South Asia'''\nThe independence of the Indian subcontinent from direct British rule in 1947 posed a unique problem. From 1858, when the British government had assumed direct rule over the subcontinent, it had been governed as a quasi-federation, with most of the subcontinent (known as British India), under the direct rule of the British sovereign. The remainder of the subcontinent, however, was under a form of indirect rule through its division and subdivision into over 500 [[Constituent monarchies|subnational monarchies]], known as [[princely states]]; each was ruled by a prince in a subsidiary alliance with the British government. The princely states ranged from powerful and largely independent principalities such as Hyderabad or Mysore, with a high level of autonomy, to tiny fiefdoms a few dozen acres (in the low tens of hectares) in size. The resulting imperial structure was broadly similar to that of the German Empire before the First World War.\n\nIn 1947, it was agreed that the Indian subcontinent would be partitioned into the independent British dominions of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], with the princely states acceding to one nation or the other. The accession process proceeded smoothly, with the notable exception of four of the most influential principalities. The Muslim ruler of the Hindu-majority state of Junagadh ruler acceded to Pakistan, but his decision was overruled by the Indian government, while Hyderabad chose to be independent, but was forcibly annexed to India in 1948. The Hindu ruler of Jammu and Kashmir, among the largest and most powerful of the principalities, but with a Muslim-majority population, initially held off on a decision. In the autumn of 1947, an invading force from Pakistan frightened the ruler into acceding to India. The ruler of Kalat, in Baluchistan, declared his independence in 1947, after which the state was forcibly merged with Pakistan, resulting in an insurgency persisting to this day. With the promulgation of the Indian constitution in 1950, India abolished its monarchy under the British crown and became a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations, followed by Pakistan in 1956; as a result of both developments, the majority of the princes formally lost their sovereign rights. A few remaining principalities in Pakistan retained their autonomy until 1969 when they finally acceded to Pakistan. The Indian government formally derecognized its princely families in 1971, followed by Pakistan in 1972.\n\n=== Monarchism ===\nIn a [[1993 Brazilian constitutional referendum|referendum]] in Brazil in 1993, voters rejected an attempt to restore the country's monarchy. Unsuccessful efforts to restore the monarchies of some of the Balkan states in the former Eastern Bloc continue. Former King [[Michael of Romania]] and [[Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia|Prince Alexander]] of Serbia have been allowed to return, gained some popularity, played largely apolitical public roles, but never came close to being restored to their ancestral thrones. However, in Bulgaria, [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]], who was deposed from the Bulgarian throne in 1946, was elected and recently served as the Prime Minister of his country from 2001 to 2005. The only formerly socialist country to have held a referendum on the monarchy was Albania where the claimant to his father's throne, the self-styled [[Leka, Crown Prince of Albania (born 1939)|Leka I]], [[1997 Albanian monarchy referendum|lost by a 2/3 majority]], though it was later revealed upon Leka\u2019s death in 2011 by the Albanian government that the referendum had been rigged in favour of the republic. {{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n=== New monarchies in the 20th century ===\nThe 20th century also saw the formation of a number of new monarchies that still exists to this day such as: [[Bhutan]] (1907), [[Jordan]] (1921), [[Saudi Arabia]] (1932) & [[Malaysia]] (1957).\n\n=== Summary table of the 20th century ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=\"2\"|Country\n!

These land disputes included estates his father held [[Tenant-in-chief|in-chief]] from the crown and others which he had held from the Peverel family as [[Lord|overlords]].\n\nOther lawsuits concerned Whittington Castle held by the Peverels during the reign of King Stephen. Although he won the right to Whittington in or about 1195, he never received formal legal ''[[seisin]]'' and it remained in Welsh hands at the time of his death in 1197.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 35</ref>\n\n[[Whittington Castle]] lies on the English side of [[Offa's Dyke]], which during the Norman era and before was the border between England and [[Wales]]. The site was fortified as a castle by [[William Peverel]] in 1138, in support of Empress Matilda, the daughter of King [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] (1100\u20131135), in her struggle (known as [[The Anarchy]]) for the throne against King Stephen (1135\u20131154), grandson of [[William the Conqueror]]. In the late 1140s the [[Marcher lord|lordship]] of [[Whittington, Shropshire|Whittington]], like [[Oswestry]] and Overton ceased to be part of England and became part of the [[Kingdom of Powys]] and a Welsh [[marcher lord]]ship.<ref>P.

After his father's death in 1197 Fulk III offered [[feudal relief|relief]] of \u00a3100 for the inheritance of Whittington. However Maurice of Powis (d.1200), the son of Roger of Powis, who had offered half that amount, on 11 April 1200 was granted Whittington by [[John, King of England|King John]]. Again, after Maurice's death in August 1200, King John granted it to Maurice's heirs.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 36</ref>\n\nIt is not known why King John refused to recognise Fulk's claim to Whittington as his rightful inheritance but by April 1201 Fulk was in open rebellion against the King. He was accompanied by approximately fifty-two followers including his brothers William, Phillip and John, his cousins, and by the family's many tenants and allies in the Marches.<ref name=\"FFWOCH97\"/><ref name=\"Sidney Painter 1964 p. 52\"/>\n\nFulk's rebellion is not related in detail by chroniclers but was clearly considerable as in the spring of 1201, while King John crossed into [[Normandy]] and [[Poitou]] to suppress a revolt by the [[Lusignan dynasty|Lusignans]],<ref>Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) p. 157</ref> he ordered [[Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent|Hubert de Burgh]], with 100 knights, to counter the rebellion of Fulk and William Marsh, a [[Somerset]]shire knight who was raiding shipping off the coast of [[Devon]].<ref>Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) pp. 48, 84</ref>\n\nIn July 1202 Fulk and his men are reported to have taken refuge in [[Stanley Abbey]] in Wiltshire. Another man, Gilbert de Duure, is mentioned in records as \"...having been an outlaw associated with Fulk Fitz Warin\".  Yet another, Eustace de Kivilly, was pardoned earlier in 1202 by King John for \"being associated with Fulk\".<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 38</ref>\n\nAfter many years of being an outlaw, on 11 November 1203 Fulk was pardoned together with over thirty of his followers, including his brothers William,  Phillip and John and his cousins. In October 1204, on payment of a fine of 200 marks, Fulk at last received \"right and inheritance\" in Whittington.<ref>A. Kemp-Welch (translator), L. Brandin (ed.), ''The History of Fulk Fitz-Warine'' (Alexander Moring Ltd., De La More Press, London 1904), p. xii.</ref> Whittington Castle thereafter descended in the [[Baron FitzWarin|FitzWarin family]], all subsequent holders bearing the first-name Fulk, until the death of [[Fulk XI FitzWarin, 7th Baron FitzWarin]] (1405\u20131420) in 1420.<ref>Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) pps. 51\u201352</ref>\n\nIn 1207 Fulk III was clearly highly regarded by many of the king's barons as evidenced by the identity of men known to have provided surety for Fulk's fine of 1,200 marks to marry the heiress daughter of Robert le Vavasur. The suretors included the Peverels, [[Alan Basset]], [[William de Braose (died 1230)|William de Braose]] (d.1230), a de Lacy, [[William Longesp\u00e9e, 3rd Earl of Salisbury]] and [[Henry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford]].<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 39</ref>\n\nOn 9 February 1214, when King John again set sail for [[Poitou]], Fulk was among the barons who accompanied him. He is believed then to have been  a vassal of [[Geoffrey FitzGeoffrey de Mandeville, 2nd Earl of Essex|Geoffrey de Mandeville]], Earl of Gloucester.<ref>Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) pp. 280, 294.</ref>\n\nIn 1215 Fulk was one of many giving great trouble to the [[Sheriff of Shropshire]]. Before 1216 and the accession of the infant King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] (1216\u20131272), John's son, Fulk's manor of Alveston had been seized by the crown and in the following year 1217 all of his other lands in Gloucestershire were likewise seized. By 1218 however Fulk had made peace and his lands were ordered restored by the regents of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]].<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), pp. 41, 43</ref>\n\nBy 1220 Fulk had regained some favour with the young King Henry III and had been allowed to rebuild and fortify Whittington. In 1223 however it fell to [[Llywelyn the Great]], prince of Wales. Fulk  regained it the following year although his disputes with Llywelyn continued and more of Fulk's lands were seized.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 42</ref>\n\nBy 1228 a truce seems to have been reached between Fulk and Llywelyn following the intervention of the king.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 41</ref>\n\nThroughout these years Fulk's relations with the King were changeable and seemed to be directly dependent on the state of affairs in Wales. As a marcher lord Fulk's role as a protector of the English border against the Welsh was vital to the English King. He arbitrated several border disputes on behalf of the King and although there were more personal disagreements, there were no more rebellions on the part of Fulk III.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), pp. 42, 43, 45</ref>\n\n==Marriages and progeny==\nFulk III FitzWarin married twice:\n*Firstly, in about 1207, to [[Maud le Vavasour, Baroness Butler|Maud le Vavasour]] (d.1226), (''alias'' Matilda), daughter of Robert le Vavasour and widow of the powerful Lancashire baron Theobald Walter.<ref>George Edward Cokayne, The Complete Peerage of England Scotland Ireland Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant Extinct or Dormant, ed.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

These land disputes included estates his father held [[Tenant-in-chief|in-chief]] from the crown and others which he had held from the Peverel family as [[Lord|overlords]].\n\nOther lawsuits concerned Whittington Castle held by the Peverels during the reign of King Stephen.

The site was fortified as a castle by [[William Peverel]] in 1138, in support of Empress Matilda, the daughter of King [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] (1100\u20131135), in her struggle (known as [[The Anarchy]]) for the throne against King Stephen (1135\u20131154), grandson of [[William the Conqueror]].

After his father's death in 1197 Fulk III offered [[feudal relief|relief]] of \u00a3100 for the inheritance of Whittington. However Maurice of Powis (d.1200), the son of Roger of Powis, who had offered half that amount, on 11 April 1200 was granted Whittington by [[John, King of England|King John]]. Again, after Maurice's death in August 1200, King John granted it to Maurice's heirs.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 36</ref>\n\nIt is not known why King John refused to recognise Fulk's claim to Whittington as his rightful inheritance but by April 1201 Fulk was in open rebellion against the King. He was accompanied by approximately fifty-two followers including his brothers William, Phillip and John, his cousins, and by the family's many tenants and allies in the Marches.<ref name=\"FFWOCH97\"/><ref name=\"Sidney Painter 1964 p. 52\"/>\n\nFulk's rebellion is not related in detail by chroniclers but was clearly considerable as in the spring of 1201, while King John crossed into [[Normandy]] and [[Poitou]] to suppress a revolt by the [[Lusignan dynasty|Lusignans]],<ref>Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) p. 157</ref> he ordered [[Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent|Hubert de Burgh]], with 100 knights, to counter the rebellion of Fulk and William Marsh, a [[Somerset]]shire knight who was raiding shipping off the coast of [[Devon]].<ref>Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) pp. 48, 84</ref>\n\nIn July 1202 Fulk and his men are reported to have taken refuge in [[Stanley Abbey]] in Wiltshire. Another man, Gilbert de Duure, is mentioned in records as \"...having been an outlaw associated with Fulk Fitz Warin\".  Yet another, Eustace de Kivilly, was pardoned earlier in 1202 by King John for \"being associated with Fulk\".<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 38</ref>\n\nAfter many years of being an outlaw, on 11 November 1203 Fulk was pardoned together with over thirty of his followers, including his brothers William,  Phillip and John and his cousins. In October 1204, on payment of a fine of 200 marks, Fulk at last received \"right and inheritance\" in Whittington.<ref>A. Kemp-Welch (translator), L. Brandin (ed.), ''The History of Fulk Fitz-Warine'' (Alexander Moring Ltd., De La More Press, London 1904), p. xii.</ref> Whittington Castle thereafter descended in the [[Baron FitzWarin|FitzWarin family]], all subsequent holders bearing the first-name Fulk, until the death of [[Fulk XI FitzWarin, 7th Baron FitzWarin]] (1405\u20131420) in 1420.<ref>Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) pps. 51\u201352</ref>\n\nIn 1207 Fulk III was clearly highly regarded by many of the king's barons as evidenced by the identity of men known to have provided surety for Fulk's fine of 1,200 marks to marry the heiress daughter of Robert le Vavasur. The suretors included the Peverels, [[Alan Basset]], [[William de Braose (died 1230)|William de Braose]] (d.1230), a de Lacy, [[William Longesp\u00e9e, 3rd Earl of Salisbury]] and [[Henry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford]].<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 39</ref>\n\nOn 9 February 1214, when King John again set sail for [[Poitou]], Fulk was among the barons who accompanied him. He is believed then to have been  a vassal of [[Geoffrey FitzGeoffrey de Mandeville, 2nd Earl of Essex|Geoffrey de Mandeville]], Earl of Gloucester.<ref>Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) pp. 280, 294.</ref>\n\nIn 1215 Fulk was one of many giving great trouble to the [[Sheriff of Shropshire]]. Before 1216 and the accession of the infant King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] (1216\u20131272), John's son, Fulk's manor of Alveston had been seized by the crown and in the following year 1217 all of his other lands in Gloucestershire were likewise seized. By 1218 however Fulk had made peace and his lands were ordered restored by the regents of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]].<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), pp. 41, 43</ref>\n\nBy 1220 Fulk had regained some favour with the young King Henry III and had been allowed to rebuild and fortify Whittington. In 1223 however it fell to [[Llywelyn the Great]], prince of Wales. Fulk  regained it the following year although his disputes with Llywelyn continued and more of Fulk's lands were seized.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 42</ref>\n\nBy 1228 a truce seems to have been reached between Fulk and Llywelyn following the intervention of the king.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 41</ref>\n\nThroughout these years Fulk's relations with the King were changeable and seemed to be directly dependent on the state of affairs in Wales. As a marcher lord Fulk's role as a protector of the English border against the Welsh was vital to the English King. He arbitrated several border disputes on behalf of the King and although there were more personal disagreements, there were no more rebellions on the part of Fulk III.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), pp. 42, 43, 45</ref>\n\n==Marriages and progeny==\nFulk III FitzWarin married twice:\n*Firstly, in about 1207, to [[Maud le Vavasour, Baroness Butler|Maud le Vavasour]] (d.1226), (''alias'' Matilda), daughter of Robert le Vavasour and widow of the powerful Lancashire baron Theobald Walter.<ref>George Edward Cokayne, The Complete Peerage of England Scotland Ireland Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant Extinct or Dormant, ed.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.
