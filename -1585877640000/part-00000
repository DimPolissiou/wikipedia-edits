Since 2012 it forms part of the municipality of [[Oron, Vaud|Oron]].\n\n==History==\nPal\u00e9zieux is first mentioned in 1134 as ''de Palaisol''.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nUnder the rule of [[Savoy]], the family ''de Pal\u00e9zieux'' - mentioned in texts from 1154 - had their castle near the village, of which remains can be seen today (mainly a wall). The castle controlled a bridge on the River Broye, which was a source of profit through the various tolls and taxes.\n\nThe bridge over the Broye was washed away in 1700, following a flood. It was rebuilt in 1750, following several petitions. Modernized, it is still in place.\n\nThe creation of the separate settlement at Pal\u00e9zieux-Gare came about with the commissioning of the railway line between Lausanne and Bern in 1862, which was built away from the original village (which became known as Pal\u00e9zieux-Village). In 1876 the line from Payerne was added, which runs adjacent to Pal\u00e9zieux-Village, and in 1903 the metre gauge line leading to the Gruy\u00e8re was constructed, with its terminus at Pal\u00e9zieux-Gare.\n\n==Geography==\nPal\u00e9zieux is located below the [[confluence]]s of the [[Broye (river)|Broye]] and the smaller Mionne and Biorde rivers, and has two main settlements: Pal\u00e9zieux-Village and Pal\u00e9zieux-Gare. The Village is situated at an [[elevation]] of 634m, and is {{convert|1.7|km|mi}} (by road) to the northwest of Pal\u00e9zieux-Gare, which is at 676m. Pal\u00e9zieux-Gare is the smaller settlement but is a notable railway junction, and is named for the railway station there.

The castle controlled a bridge on the River Broye, which was a source of profit through the various tolls and taxes.\n\nThe bridge over the Broye was washed away in 1700, following a flood. It was rebuilt in 1750, following several petitions. Modernized, it is still in place.\n\nThe creation of the separate settlement at Pal\u00e9zieux-Gare came about with the commissioning of the railway line between Lausanne and Bern in 1862, which was built away from the original village (which became known as Pal\u00e9zieux-Village).

The plan called for American helicopters to descend upon the POW camp where he had been sighted, and to flood it with tear gas, then for an ambulance helicopter to land in the camp and rescue any Americans there.  Unfortunately, Rowe had been moved a month earlier, and the rescuers found an empty camp.  Rowe would finally escape his captors on December 31, 1968.<ref>D.
