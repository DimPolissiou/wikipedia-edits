Jewish laborers in the camps had to dig zigzag trenches, supposedly for air defense, in late October. Thousands of SS and police personnel arrived in [[Lublin]] on 2 November. That day, [[SS and Police Leader]] [[Jakob Sporrenberg]], who was in charge of the operation, held a conference to plan it.\n\nThe killings began on the morning of 3 November at Majdanek, where Jewish prisoners were separated from non-Jewish prisoners, and encompassed the [[Lipowa 7]] and [[Lublin airfield camp|Lublin airfield]] camps, which imprisoned Jews in the city. A total of 18,400 people were shot by the early evening. The same day, 6,000 people were murdered at Trawniki, including some from [[Dorohucza]]. After finishing the Majdanek operation, several of the involved units proceeded to Poniatowa, where they murdered the camp's 14,500 prisoners on 4 November. In all three camps, Jews were forced to strip naked and walk into the previously dug trenches, where they were shot. Loud music was played to cover the sound of gunfire.\n\nAfter the operation, about 10,000 Jews were left alive in various labor camps in the Lublin District. The bodies of the victims were burned by other Jews, who had been spared temporarily from death. With around 40,000 victims, Operation Harvest Festival was the largest single massacre of Jews by German forces during [[the Holocaust]].\n\n==Background==\n<!-- [[File:Stroop Report - Warsaw Ghetto Uprising 13.jpg|thumb|link=Captured Hehalutz fighters photograph|upright=0.8|[[Ma\u0142ka Zdrojewicz]] ''(right)'' was captured during the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] and deported to Majdanek.]] -->\n[[File:General Government camps of Lublin Reservation.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Forced-labor camps in the General Governorate; those affected by Operation Harvest Festival  are in the upper right.]]\nIn 1942, 360,000 of the Jews who lived in the [[Lublin District]] of the [[General Governorate]] of [[German-occupied Poland]] were murdered during [[Operation Reinhard]].

Jewish laborers in the camps had to dig zigzag trenches, supposedly for air defense, in late October. Thousands of SS and police personnel arrived in [[Lublin]] on 2 November. That day, [[SS and Police Leader]] [[Jakob Sporrenberg]], who was in charge of the operation, held a conference to plan it.\n\nThe killings began on the morning of 3 November at Majdanek, where Jewish prisoners were separated from non-Jewish prisoners, and encompassed the [[Lipowa 7]] and [[Lublin airfield camp|Lublin airfield]] camps, which imprisoned Jews in the city. A total of 18,400 people were shot by the early evening. The same day, 6,000 people were murdered at Trawniki, including some from [[Dorohucza]]. After finishing the Majdanek operation, several of the involved units proceeded to Poniatowa, where they murdered the camp's 14,500 prisoners on 4 November. In all three camps, Jews were forced to strip naked and walk into the previously dug trenches, where they were shot. Loud music was played to cover the sound of gunfire.\n\nAfter the operation, about 10,000 Jews were left alive in various labor camps in the Lublin District. The bodies of the victims were burned by other Jews, who had been spared temporarily from death. With around 40,000 victims, Operation Harvest Festival was the largest single massacre of Jews by German forces during [[the Holocaust]].\n\n==Background==\n<!-- [[File:Stroop Report - Warsaw Ghetto Uprising 13.jpg|thumb|link=Captured Hehalutz fighters photograph|upright=0.8|[[Ma\u0142ka Zdrojewicz]] ''(right)'' was captured during the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] and deported to Majdanek.]] -->\n[[File:General Government camps of Lublin Reservation.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Forced-labor camps in the General Governorate; those affected by Operation Harvest Festival  are in the upper right.]]\nIn 1942, 360,000 of the Jews who lived in the [[Lublin District]] of the [[General Governorate]] of [[German-occupied Poland]] were murdered during [[Operation Reinhard]].

It was based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of prior album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" received positive reception, called \"impossibly catchy\" and \"classic pop\". It became Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States and stayed atop the chart for three weeks. It was Jackson's twenty-first single to be certified, which ranked her as the second female artist with the most certified singles. The single fared well internationally, reaching number five in the United Kingdom, and peaking within the top-ten in Italy and Denmark. It attained a silver certification in the United Kingdom, and allowed Jam and Lewis to receive a [[Grammy]] nomination for [[Producer of the Year]]. The song was later included in two of Jackson's greatest hits collections, ''[[Number Ones (Janet Jackson album)|Number Ones]]'' and ''[[Icon: Number Ones]]''.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to clips from the movie, it features advanced technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. The video had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, being one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. Its accolades include \"Outstanding Music Video\" and \"Most Stylish Music Video\" at the [[VH1]] Fashion Awards. The song was performed on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]], the latter regarded as one of the leading performances of Jackson's career.\n\nA slightly modified version of the song appeared on Jackson's seventh [[album]] ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" was considered to influence music videos from [[Britney Spears]], [[Jessica Simpson]] and [[Cassie (singer)|Cassie]]. The video was the first by director Joseph Kahn to feature Japanese themes and imagery, which he later used frequently following its popularity. Actress [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her debut appearances in the video, crediting Jackson for the experience and platform to star in the dance film ''[[Step Up (film)|Step Up]]''. [[Rihanna]]'s \"Watch n' Learn\" was likened to the song, and it was also covered by Japanese singer [[Hitomi Shimatani]] as \"Papillon\".\n\n==Background==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Jam & Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]]. She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of Sherman Klump, one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\"/>\n\nJackson stated that \"it really tells you about the movie and how it doesn't matter what is on the exterior, but the interior.

Using a vocal [[falsetto]], Jackson assures \"[It] doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing, 'cause I'm in love with the inner being,\" considered a \"sweet song of unconditional love.\" Its theme also emphasizes self-acceptance and pride, opposing negativity. Jackson said \"It plays a major part in society, it seems today. Their image, what a woman is supposed to look like \u2013 all the things you read in the magazines about either being too thin or too this or too that, but it's really about feeling good yourself and accepting yourself. Self-acceptance, which is another story you see here in this film, is the most important thing as well as being happy with who you are.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.femail.com.au/jacksonii.htm |title=Janet Jackson \u2013 Nutty Professor II Interview |work=Femail.com.au |accessdate=February 2, 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe song is based on Jackson's character Denise's \"unconditional love\" for the obese but gentle Sherman. Jackson said, \"I loved this character so much because she didn't care about all the other things that people may have seen or saw and thought was wrong with Sherman. Those were the things she loved about him, and then on top of that she saw beyond that \u2013 how genuine of a man he is, how kind he is, a very good-hearted person and that's what she loves about him[...] he's someone I could fall in love with because it's about what's inside.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Mrs. Klump, If You're Nasty |work=[[Yahoo!

It was based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of prior album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" received positive reception, called \"impossibly catchy\" and \"classic pop\". It became Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States and stayed atop the chart for three weeks. It was Jackson's twenty-first single to be certified, which ranked her as the second female artist with the most certified singles. The single fared well internationally, reaching number five in the United Kingdom, and peaking within the top-ten in Italy and Denmark. It attained a silver certification in the United Kingdom, and allowed Jam and Lewis to receive a [[Grammy]] nomination for [[Producer of the Year]]. The song was later included in two of Jackson's greatest hits collections, ''[[Number Ones (Janet Jackson album)|Number Ones]]'' and ''[[Icon: Number Ones]]''.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to clips from the movie, it features advanced technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. The video had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, being one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. Its accolades include \"Outstanding Music Video\" and \"Most Stylish Music Video\" at the [[VH1]] Fashion Awards. The song was performed on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]], the latter regarded as one of the leading performances of Jackson's career.\n\nA slightly modified version of the song appeared on Jackson's seventh [[album]] ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" was considered to influence music videos from [[Britney Spears]], [[Jessica Simpson]] and [[Cassie (singer)|Cassie]]. The video was the first by director Joseph Kahn to feature Japanese themes and imagery, which he later used frequently following its popularity. Actress [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her debut appearances in the video, crediting Jackson for the experience and platform to star in the dance film ''[[Step Up (film)|Step Up]]''. [[Rihanna]]'s \"Watch n' Learn\" was likened to the song, and it was also covered by Japanese singer [[Hitomi Shimatani]] as \"Papillon\".\n\n==Background==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Jam & Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]]. She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of Sherman Klump, one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\"/>\n\nJackson stated that \"it really tells you about the movie and how it doesn't matter what is on the exterior, but the interior.

Using a vocal [[falsetto]], Jackson assures \"[It] doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing, 'cause I'm in love with the inner being,\" considered a \"sweet song of unconditional love.\" Its theme also emphasizes self-acceptance and pride, opposing negativity. Jackson said \"It plays a major part in society, it seems today. Their image, what a woman is supposed to look like \u2013 all the things you read in the magazines about either being too thin or too this or too that, but it's really about feeling good yourself and accepting yourself. Self-acceptance, which is another story you see here in this film, is the most important thing as well as being happy with who you are.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.femail.com.au/jacksonii.htm |title=Janet Jackson \u2013 Nutty Professor II Interview |work=Femail.com.au |accessdate=February 2, 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe song is based on Jackson's character Denise's \"unconditional love\" for the obese but gentle Sherman. Jackson said, \"I loved this character so much because she didn't care about all the other things that people may have seen or saw and thought was wrong with Sherman. Those were the things she loved about him, and then on top of that she saw beyond that \u2013 how genuine of a man he is, how kind he is, a very good-hearted person and that's what she loves about him[...] he's someone I could fall in love with because it's about what's inside.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Mrs. Klump, If You're Nasty |work=[[Yahoo!

It is related by an unnamed narrator who endeavors to convince the reader of the narrator\u2019s sanity while simultaneously describing a murder the narrator committed. The victim was an old man with a filmy \"vulture-eye\", as the narrator calls it. The narrator emphasizes the careful calculation of the murder, attempting the perfect crime, complete with dismembering and hiding the body under the floorboards. Ultimately, the narrator's feelings of guilt, or a mental disturbance, result in hearing a thumping sound, which the narrator interprets as the dead man's beating heart.\n\nThe story was first published in [[James Russell Lowell]]'s ''The Pioneer'' in January 1843. \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is often considered a classic of the [[Gothic fiction]] genre and is one of Poe's best known short stories.\n\nThe specific motivation for murder (aside from the narrator's dislike of the old man's eye), the relationship between narrator and old man, the gender of the narrator and other details are left unclear. The narrator denies having any feelings of hatred or resentment for the man who had, as stated, never wronged the narrator. The narrator also denies having killed for greed. \n\nIt has been speculated that the old man is a father figure, the narrator's landlord, or that the narrator works for the old man as a servant, and that perhaps his \"vulture-eye\" represents some sort of veiled secret, or power. The ambiguity and lack of details about the two main characters stand in stark contrast to the specific plot details leading up to the murder.\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:Clarke-TellTaleHeart.jpeg|thumb|left|Illustration by [[Harry Clarke]], 1919]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is told from a [[first-person narrative]] of an unnamed narrator, who insists on being sane, but is suffering from a disease (nervousness) which causes \"[[Hyperesthesia|over-acuteness of the senses]]\". \n\nThe old man with whom the narrator lives has a clouded, pale, blue \"[[vulture]]-like\" eye, which distresses and manipulates the narrator so much that the narrator plots to murder the old man, despite also insisting that the narrator loves the old man. The narrator insists that this careful precision in committing the murder proves that the narrator cannot possibly be insane. For seven nights, the narrator opens the door of the old man's room in order to shine a sliver of light onto the \"evil eye\". However, the old man's vulture-eye is always closed, making it impossible to \"do the work\", thus making the narrator go further into distress.\n\nOn the eighth night, the old man awakens after the narrator's hand slips and makes a noise, interrupting the narrator's nightly ritual. The narrator does not draw back and, after some time, decides to open the lantern. A single thin ray of light shines out and lands precisely on the \"evil eye\", revealing that it is wide open. Hearing the old man's heart beating loudly and dangerously fast from terror, the narrator decides to strike; jumping out with a loud yell and smothering the old man with his own bed. The narrator then dismembers the body and conceals the pieces under the floorboards, and ensures the concealment of all signs of the crime. Even so, the old man's scream during the night causes a neighbor to report to the police, who the narrator invites in to look around. The narrator claims that the scream heard was the narrator's own in a nightmare and that the man is absent in the country. Confident that they will not find any evidence of the murder, the narrator brings chairs for them and they sit in the old man's room. The chairs are placed on the very spot where the body is concealed; the police suspect nothing and the narrator has a pleasant and easy manner.\n\nThe narrator begins to feel uncomfortable and notices a ringing in the narrator's ears. As the ringing grows louder, the narrator comes to the conclusion that it is the heartbeat of the old man coming from under the floorboards. The sound increases steadily to the narrator, though the officers seem to pay no attention to it. Terrified by the violent beating of the heart, and convinced that the officers are aware not only of the heartbeat but also of the narrator's guilt, the narrator breaks down and confesses. The narrator tells them to tear up the floorboards to reveal the remains of the old man's body.\n\n== Publication history ==\n[[File:Tell tale heart in pioneer.jpg|thumb|\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" in ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', page 29]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" was first published in January 1843 in the inaugural issue of ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', a short-lived [[Boston]] magazine edited by [[James Russell Lowell]] and [[Robert Carter (editor)|Robert Carter]] who were listed as the \"proprietors\" on the front cover. The magazine was published in Boston by Leland and Whiting and in Philadelphia by Drew and Scammell.\n\nPoe was likely paid $10 for the story.<ref name=\"Silverman-p201\">Silverman, Kenneth.

The exactness with which the narrator recounts murdering the old man; as if the stealthy way in which they executed the crime were evidence of their sanity, reveals their [[monomania]] and [[paranoia]]. The focus of the story is the perverse scheme to commit the [[perfect crime]].<ref>Kennedy, J. Gerald. ''Poe, Death, and the Life of Writing''. Yale University Press, 1987. p. 132; {{ISBN|0-300-03773-2}}</ref>\n\nThe narrator of \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is generally assumed to be a male. However, some critics have suggested a woman may be narrating; no pronouns are used to clarify one way or the other.<ref name=Sova234>Sova, Dawn B. ''Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z''. New York City: Checkmark Books, 2001: 234. {{ISBN|0-8160-4161-X}}</ref> The story starts ''[[in medias res]]''. The story opens with a conversation already in progress between the narrator and another person who is not identified in any way. It has been speculated that the narrator is confessing to a prison warden, a judge, a reporter, a doctor or ([[Anachronism|anachronistically]]) a psychiatrist.<ref name=\"Benfey-p30\">[[Christopher Benfey|Benfey, Christopher]]. \"Poe and the Unreadable: 'The Black Cat' and 'The Tell-Tale Heart'\", in ''New Essays on Poe's Major Tales'', Kenneth Silverman, ed.

It is related by an unnamed narrator who endeavors to convince the reader of the narrator\u2019s sanity while simultaneously describing a murder the narrator committed. The victim was an old man with a filmy \"vulture-eye\", as the narrator calls it. The narrator emphasizes the careful calculation of the murder, attempting the perfect crime, complete with dismembering and hiding the body under the floorboards. Ultimately, the narrator's feelings of guilt, or a mental disturbance, result in hearing a thumping sound, which the narrator interprets as the dead man's beating heart.\n\nThe story was first published in [[James Russell Lowell]]'s ''The Pioneer'' in January 1843. \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is often considered a classic of the [[Gothic fiction]] genre and is one of Poe's best known short stories.\n\nThe specific motivation for murder (aside from the narrator's dislike of the old man's eye), the relationship between narrator and old man, the gender of the narrator and other details are left unclear. The narrator denies having any feelings of hatred or resentment for the man who had, as stated, never wronged the narrator. The narrator also denies having killed for greed. \n\nIt has been speculated that the old man is a father figure, the narrator's landlord, or that the narrator works for the old man as a servant, and that perhaps his \"vulture-eye\" represents some sort of veiled secret, or power. The ambiguity and lack of details about the two main characters stand in stark contrast to the specific plot details leading up to the murder.\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:Clarke-TellTaleHeart.jpeg|thumb|left|Illustration by [[Harry Clarke]], 1919]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is told from a [[first-person narrative]] of an unnamed narrator, who insists on being sane, but is suffering from a disease (nervousness) which causes \"[[Hyperesthesia|over-acuteness of the senses]]\". \n\nThe old man with whom the narrator lives has a clouded, pale, blue \"[[vulture]]-like\" eye, which distresses and manipulates the narrator so much that the narrator plots to murder the old man, despite also insisting that the narrator loves the old man. The narrator insists that this careful precision in committing the murder proves that the narrator cannot possibly be insane. For seven nights, the narrator opens the door of the old man's room in order to shine a sliver of light onto the \"evil eye\". However, the old man's vulture-eye is always closed, making it impossible to \"do the work\", thus making the narrator go further into distress.\n\nOn the eighth night, the old man awakens after the narrator's hand slips and makes a noise, interrupting the narrator's nightly ritual. Although, the narrator does not draw back and, after some time, decides to open the lantern. A single thin ray of light shines out and lands precisely on the \"evil eye\", revealing that it is wide open. Hearing the old man's heart beating loudly and dangerously fast from terror, the narrator decides to strike; jumping out with a loud yell and smothering the old man with his own bed. The narrator then dismembers the body and conceals the pieces under the floorboards, and ensures the concealment of all signs of the crime. Even so, the old man's scream during the night causes a neighbor to report to the police, who the narrator invites in to look around. The narrator claims that the scream heard was the narrator's own in a nightmare and that the man is absent in the country. Confident that they will not find any evidence of the murder, the narrator brings chairs for them and they sit in the old man's room. The chairs are placed on the very spot where the body is concealed; the police suspect nothing and the narrator has a pleasant and easy manner.\n\nThe narrator begins to feel uncomfortable and notices a ringing in the narrator's ears. As the ringing grows louder, the narrator comes to the conclusion that it is the heartbeat of the old man coming from under the floorboards. The sound increases steadily to the narrator, though the officers seem to pay no attention to it. Terrified by the violent beating of the heart, and convinced that the officers are aware not only of the heartbeat but also of the narrator's guilt, the narrator breaks down and confesses. The narrator tells them to tear up the floorboards to reveal the remains of the old man's body.\n\n== Publication history ==\n[[File:Tell tale heart in pioneer.jpg|thumb|\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" in ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', page 29]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" was first published in January 1843 in the inaugural issue of ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', a short-lived [[Boston]] magazine edited by [[James Russell Lowell]] and [[Robert Carter (editor)|Robert Carter]] who were listed as the \"proprietors\" on the front cover.

This, however, is self-destructive, because in attempting to prove their sanity, they fully admit that they are guilty of murder.<ref name=\"Robinson-p94\">Robinson, E. Arthur. \"Poe's 'The Tell-Tale Heart'\" in ''Twentieth Century Interpretations of Poe's Tales'', edited by William L. Howarth. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall Inc., 1971, p. 94.</ref> Their denial of insanity is based on their systematic actions and their precision, as they provide a rational explanation for irrational behavior.<ref name=\"Cleman-p70\"/> This rationality, however, is undermined by their lack of motive (\"Object there was none. Passion there was none.\"). Despite this, they say, the idea of murder \"haunted me day and night.\"<ref name=\"Robinson-p94\"/>\n\nThe story's final scene shows the result of the narrator's feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]. Like many characters in [[Gothic fiction]], they allow their nerves to dictate their nature. Despite their best efforts at defending themself, their \"over-acuteness of the senses\"; which help them hear the heart beating beneath the floorboards, is evidence that they are truly mad.<ref name=\"Fisher-p87\">Fisher, Benjamin Franklin. \"Poe and the Gothic Tradition\", in ''The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe'', edited by Kevin J. Hayes. Cambridge University Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-521-79727-6}}, p. 87.</ref> Poe's contemporaries may well have been reminded of the controversy over the [[insanity defense]] in the 1840s.<ref name=\"Cleman-p66\">Cleman, ''Bloom's BioCritiques'', p. 66.</ref>\n\nThe narrator claims to have a disease that causes [[Sensitivity (human)|hypersensitivity]]. A similar [[motif (narrative)|motif]] is used for Roderick Usher in \"[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]\" (1839) and in \"The Colloquy of Monos and Una\" (1841).<ref name=\"Reilly\"/> It is unclear, however, if the narrator actually has very [[:wikt:acute|acute]] senses, or if they are merely imagining things. If their condition is believed to be true, what they hear at the end of the story may not be the old man's heart, but [[deathwatch beetle]]s. The narrator first admits to hearing beetles in the wall after startling the old man from his sleep. According to superstition, deathwatch beetles are a sign of impending death. One variety of deathwatch beetle raps its head against surfaces, presumably as part of a mating ritual, while others emit ticking sounds.<ref name=\"Reilly\">Reilly, John E. \"[http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm The Lesser Death-Watch and \"'The Tell-Tale Heart'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218172125/http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm |date=December 18, 2009 }}\", in ''The American Transcendental Quarterly''.

JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/24780617.</ref> This is of course a very modern view of the work; in Poe's era there was no such diagnosis, and Poe would not have been familiar with a set of symptoms as pertaining to any definite mental disease. \n\nThe relationship between the old man and the narrator is ambiguous. Their names, occupations, and places of residence are not given, contrasting with the strict attention to detail in the plot.<ref name=\"Benfey-p32\">Benfey, ''New Essays'', p. 32.</ref> The narrator may be a servant of the old man's or, as is more often assumed, his child. In that case, the \"vulture-eye\" of the old man as a father figure may symbolize parental surveillance, or the paternal principles of right and wrong. The murder of the eye, then, is a removal of conscience.<ref name=\"Hoffman-p223\">Hoffman, Daniel. ''Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe''.

Another important physiological change related to sexuality in humans was the evolution of [[hidden estrus]]. Humans are the only ape in which the female is intermittently fertile year round, and in which no special signals of fertility are produced by the body (such as [[genital swelling]] during estrus). Nonetheless humans retain a degree of sexual dimorphism in the distribution of body hair and subcutaneous fat, and in the overall size, males being around 25% larger than females. These changes taken together have been interpreted as a result of an increased emphasis on [[pair bonding]] as a possible solution to the requirement for increased parental investment due to the prolonged infancy of offspring.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Rise of ''Homo sapiens''===\n[[File:Map-of-human-migrations.jpg|thumb|World map of early human migrations according to [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] [[population genetics]] (numbers are [[millennia]] before present, the North Pole is at the center).]]\n{{main|Homo sapiens}}\n{{see|Archaic human admixture with modern humans|Early human migrations|Multiregional origin of modern humans|Prehistoric autopsy|Recent African origin of modern humans}}\nBy the beginning of the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period (50,000 [[Before Present|BP]]), and likely significantly earlier by 100-70,000 years ago<ref name=\"McBrearty Brooks 2000\" /><ref name=\"Henshilwood Marean 2003\" /><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Henshilwood | first1 = C.

The construction of the [[human pelvis]] differs from other [[primate]]s, as do the toes. A trade-off for these advantages of the modern human pelvis is that childbirth is more difficult and dangerous than in most [[mammal]]s, especially given the larger head size of human [[babies]] compared to other primates. Human babies must turn around as they pass through the birth canal while other primates do not, which makes humans the only species where females usually require help from their [[conspecific]]s (other members of their own species) to reduce the risks of birthing. As a partial [[evolution]]ary solution, human fetuses are born [[Altricial|less developed and more vulnerable]]. Chimpanzee babies are cognitively more developed than human babies until the age of six months, when the rapid development of human brains surpasses chimpanzees. Another difference between women and chimpanzee females is that women go through the [[menopause]] and become [[Infertility|unfertile]] decades before the end of their lives. All species of non-human apes are capable of giving birth until death. Menopause probably developed as it provides an evolutionary advantage of more caring time to relatives' young.<ref name=\"O'Neil\"/>\n\nApart from bipedalism, humans differ from chimpanzees mostly in [[smelling]], [[hearing]], [[digesting]] [[protein]]s, [[brain size]], and the ability of [[language]]. Humans' brains are about three times bigger than in chimpanzees.

Women have [[Human skin color#sexual dimorphism|lighter skin]] than men of the same population; this has been explained by a higher need for vitamin D (which is synthesized by sunlight) in females during pregnancy and [[lactation]].

Most human biological variation is [[Cline (biology)|clinally]] distributed and blends gradually from one area to the next.

Furthermore, different traits are non-concordant and each have different clinal distribution. Adaptability varies both from person to person and from population to population. The most efficient adaptive responses are found in geographical populations where the environmental stimuli are the strongest (e.g. [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] are highly adapted to high altitudes).

Humans are variously said to possess consciousness, [[self-awareness]], and a mind, which correspond roughly to the mental processes of [[thought]]. These are said to possess qualities such as self-awareness, [[sentience]], [[sapience]], and the ability to perceive the relationship between [[Personal identity|oneself]] and one's [[natural environment|environment]]. The extent to which the mind constructs or experiences the outer world is a matter of debate, as are the definitions and validity of many of the terms used above.\n\nThe physical aspects of the mind and brain, and by extension of the nervous system, are studied in the field of [[neurology]], the more behavioral in the field of psychology, and a sometimes loosely defined area between in the field of psychiatry, which treats mental illness and behavioral disorders. Psychology does not necessarily refer to the brain or nervous system, and can be framed purely in terms of [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]] or [[information processing]] theories of the mind. Increasingly, however, an understanding of brain functions is being included in psychological theory and practice, particularly in areas such as [[artificial intelligence]], [[neuropsychology]], and [[cognitive neuroscience]].\n\nThe nature of thought is central to psychology and related fields. [[Cognitive psychology]] studies [[cognition]], the [[mental function|mental processes']] underlying behavior. It uses [[information processing]] as a framework for understanding the mind. Perception, learning, problem solving, memory, attention, language and emotion are all well researched areas as well. Cognitive psychology is associated with a school of thought known as [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]], whose adherents argue for an [[information processing]] model of mental function, informed by [[positivism]] and [[experimental psychology]]. Techniques and models from cognitive psychology are widely applied and form the mainstay of psychological theories in many areas of both research and applied psychology. Largely focusing on the development of the human mind through the life span, [[developmental psychology]] seeks to understand how people come to perceive, understand, and act within the world and how these processes change as they age. This may focus on intellectual, cognitive, neural, social, or [[moral development]]. [[Psychologists]] have developed [[intelligence]] [[Test (assessment)|tests]] and the concept of [[intelligence quotient]] in order to assess the relative intelligence of human beings and study its [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] among population.<ref>{{Britannica|289811|Intelligence test}}</ref>\n\nSome philosophers divide consciousness into phenomenal consciousness, which is experience itself, and access consciousness, which is the processing of the things in experience.<ref name=\"Bl\">Ned Block: ''On a Confusion about a Function of Consciousness'' in: ''The Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 1995.</ref> Phenomenal consciousness is the state of being conscious, such as when they say \"I am conscious.\" Access consciousness is being conscious ''of'' something in relation to abstract concepts, such as when one says \"I am conscious of these words.\" Various forms of access consciousness include awareness, self-awareness, conscience, [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Husserl's phenomenology]], and [[intentionality]]. The concept of phenomenal consciousness, in modern history, according to some, is closely related to the concept of [[qualia]]. [[Social psychology]] links sociology with psychology in their shared study of the nature and causes of human social interaction, with an emphasis on how people think towards each other and how they relate to each other. The behavior and mental processes, both human and non-human, can be described through [[animal cognition]], [[ethology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], and [[comparative psychology]] as well. [[Human ecology]] is an [[List of academic disciplines|academic discipline]] that investigates how humans and human societies interact with both their natural environment and the human [[social environment]].\n\n===Motivation and emotion===\n{{More citations needed|section|date=January 2020}}\n{{Main|Motivation|Emotion}}\n[[File:Plate depicting emotions of grief from Charles Darwin's book The Expression of the Emotions.jpg|right|thumb|Illustration of grief from [[Charles Darwin]]'s book ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]''.]]\n\nHuman motivation is not yet wholly understood. From a psychological perspective, [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]] is a well-established theory which can be defined as the process of satisfying certain needs in ascending order of complexity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html|title=Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs|author=Saul McLeod|date=20 March 2020|website=Simplypsychology.org|publisher=Simply Scholar Limited|access-date=4 April 2020|quote=Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a motivational theory in psychology comprising a five-tier model of human needs, often depicted as hierarchical levels within a pyramid. Needs lower down in the hierarchy must be satisfied before individuals can attend to needs higher up.}}</ref> From a more general, philosophical perspective, human motivation can be defined as a commitment to, or withdrawal from, various goals requiring the application of human ability. Furthermore, [[incentive]] and [[preference]] are both factors, as are any perceived links between incentives and preferences. [[Volition_(psychology)|Volition]] may also be involved, in which case willpower is also a factor. Ideally, both motivation and volition ensure the selection, striving for, and [[Realisation (metrology)|realization]] of goals in an optimal manner, a [[Function_(biology)|function]] beginning in childhood and continuing throughout a lifetime in a process known as [[socialization]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Heckhausen, J.|author2=Heckhausen, H.|author-link= |date=28 March 2018|title=Motivation and Action|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-65094-4_1|location=Introduction and Overview|publisher=Springer, Cham|page=1|isbn=978-3-319-65093-7|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-65094-4_1}}</ref>\n\nHappiness, or the state of being happy, is a human emotional condition. The definition of happiness is a common philosophical topic. Some people might define it as the best condition that a human can have\u2014a condition of [[mental health|mental]] and physical health. Others define it as [[wikt:freedom|freedom]] from want and [[suffering|distress]]; consciousness of the [[goodness and value theory|good]] order of things; assurance of one's place in the [[universe]] or society.\n\nEmotion has a significant influence on, or can even be said to control, human behavior, though historically many cultures and philosophers have for various reasons discouraged allowing this influence to go unchecked. Emotional experiences perceived as [[pleasure|pleasant]], such as love, [[admiration]], or [[joy]], contrast with those perceived as [[suffering|unpleasant]], like [[hate]], [[envy]], or [[sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]]. The [[Stoicism|Stoics]] believed excessive emotion was harmful, while some [[Sufi]] teachers felt certain extreme emotions could yield a conceptual perfection, what is often translated as [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]].\n\nIn modern scientific thought, certain refined emotions are considered a complex neural trait innate in a variety of [[domesticated animal|domesticated]] and non-domesticated [[mammal]]s. These were commonly developed in reaction to superior survival mechanisms and intelligent interaction with each other and the environment; as such, refined emotion is not in all cases as discrete and separate from natural neural function as was once assumed. However, when humans function in civilized tandem, it has been noted that uninhibited acting on extreme emotion can lead to social disorder and crime.\n\n===Sexuality and love===\n{{Main|Love|Human sexuality}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Sweet Baby Kisses Family Love.jpg|thumb|Human parents continue caring for their offspring long after they are born.]]\nFor humans, sexuality has important social functions: it creates physical intimacy, bonds and hierarchies among individuals, besides ensuring biological [[reproduction]]. Sexual desire, or ''[[libido]]'', is experienced as a bodily urge, often accompanied by strong emotions such as love, [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]] and [[jealousy]]. The significance of sexuality in the human species is reflected in a number of physical features, among them hidden [[ovulation]], the evolution of external [[scrotum]] and (among great apes) a relatively large [[human penis|penis]] suggesting [[human sperm competition|sperm competition in humans]], the absence of an [[Baculum|os penis]], permanent [[secondary sexual characteristics]] and the forming of [[pair bond]]s based on sexual attraction as a common social structure. Contrary to other primates that often advertise [[estrus]] through visible signs, human females do not have a distinct or visible signs of ovulation, plus they experience sexual desire outside of their fertile periods.\n\nHuman choices in acting on sexuality are commonly influenced by social norms which vary between cultures. Restrictions are often determined by religious beliefs or social customs. People can fall anywhere along a continuous scale of [[sexual orientation]].<ref name=APASO>{{cite web|title=Sexual orientation, homosexuality and bisexuality|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|accessdate=August 10, 2013|url=http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/sexual-orientation.aspx|archivedate=August 8, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808032050/http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/sexual-orientation.aspx}}</ref> There is considerably more evidence supporting nonsocial, biological causes of sexual orientation than social ones, especially for males.<ref name=\"Bailey\">{{cite journal |author1=Bailey JM |author2=Vasey PL |author3=Diamond LM |author4=Breedlove SM |author5=Vilain E |author6=Epprecht M|title=Sexual Orientation, Controversy, and Science |journal=[[Psychological Science in the Public Interest]]|volume=17|issue=21|date=2016|doi=10.1177/1529100616637616|pmid=27113562|pages=45\u2013101|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/82baedbe57a232a83bea6d88f16d66cf4acdca64}}</ref> Recent research, including [[neurology]] and [[genetics]], suggests that other aspects of human sexuality are biologically influenced as well.<ref name=Buss2003>{{cite book |author=Buss, David M. |year=2003 |title=The Evolution of Desire: Strategies of Human Mating.

family-based social structures.]]\nHumans are highly social beings and tend to live in large complex social groups. More than any other creature, humans are capable of using systems of communication for self-expression, the exchange of ideas, and [[social organization|organization]], and as such have created complex [[social structures]] composed of many cooperating and competing groups. Human groups range from the size of families to nations. Social interactions between humans have established an extremely wide variety{{clarify|date=January 2014}} of values, social norms, and rituals, which together form the basis of human society.\n\nCulture is defined here as patterns of complex symbolic behavior, i.e. all behavior that is not innate but which has to be learned through social interaction with others; such as the use of distinctive [[material culture|material]] and [[symbolic system]]s, including language, ritual, social organization, traditions, beliefs and technology.\n\n===Language===\nWhile many species [[animal communication|communicate]], [[language]] is unique to humans, a defining feature of humanity, and a [[cultural universal]]. Unlike the limited systems of other animals, human language is open\u2014an infinite number of meanings can be produced by combining a limited number of symbols. Human language also has the capacity of [[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]], using words to represent things and happenings that are not presently or locally occurring, but reside in the shared imagination of interlocutors.<ref name=\"Revolution\"/> Language differs from other forms of communication in that it is [[Origin of speech#Modality-independence|modality independent]]; the same meanings can be conveyed through different media, auditively in speech, visually by sign language or writing, and even through tactile media such as [[braille]]. Language is central to the communication between humans, and to the sense of identity that unites nations, cultures and ethnic groups. The invention of writing systems at least five thousand years ago allowed the preservation of language on material objects, and was a major technological advancement. The science of [[linguistics]] describes the structure and function of language and the relationship between languages. There are approximately six thousand different languages currently in use, including [[sign language]]s, and many thousands more that are [[extinct language|extinct]].<ref name=Comrie1996>{{cite book |author1=Comrie, Bernard |author2=Polinsky, Maria |author3=Matthews, Stephen |title=The Atlas of Languages: The Origin and Development of Languages Throughout the World |year=1996 |publisher=Facts on File |location=New York City |pages=13\u201315 |isbn=978-0-8160-3388-1}}</ref>\n\n===Gender roles===\n{{Main|Gender role|Gender}}\nThe sexual division of humans into male, female, and in some societies other genders<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/content/two-spirits_map-html/ |title=A Map of Gender-Diverse Cultures &#124; Independent Lens |publisher=PBS |date=11 August 2015 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref> has been marked culturally by a corresponding division of roles, norms, [[practice (social theory)|practices]], dress, behavior, rights, [[duty|duties]], [[Privilege (social inequality)|privileges]], [[social status|status]], and [[power (philosophy)|power]]. [[Cultural identity|Cultural differences]] by gender have often been believed to have arisen naturally out of a division of reproductive labor; the biological fact that women give birth led to their further cultural responsibility for nurturing and caring for children. Gender roles have varied historically, and challenges to predominant gender norms have recurred in many societies.\n\n===Kinship===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n{{main|Kinship|Marriage}}\n[[File:thedragonpainter.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sessue Hayakawa]] (left) with actress and wife [[Tsuru Aoki]] in a screen shot of the 1919 film ''[[The Dragon Painter]]''.]]\n\nAll human societies organize, recognize and classify types of social relationships based on relations between parents and children ([[consanguinity]]), and relations through marriage ([[Affinity (law)|affinity]]). These kinds of relations are generally called kinship relations. In most societies kinship places mutual responsibilities and expectations of solidarity on the individuals that are so related, and those who recognize each other as kinsmen come to form networks through which other social institutions can be regulated. Among the many functions of kinship is the ability to form [[descent group]]s, groups of people sharing a common line of descent, which can function as political units such as [[clan]]s. Another function is the way in which kinship unites families through marriage, forming [[Alliance theory|kinship alliances]] between groups of wife-takers and wife-givers. Such alliances also often have important political and economical ramifications, and may result in the formation of political organization above the community level. Kinship relations often includes regulations for whom an individual should or shouldn't marry. All societies have rules of [[incest taboo]], according to which marriage between certain kinds of kin relations are prohibited\u2014such rules vary widely between cultures.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Some societies also have rules of preferential marriage with certain kin relations, frequently with either [[Parallel and cross cousins|cross or parallel cousins]]. Rules and norms for marriage and social behavior among kinsfolk is often reflected in the systems of [[kinship terminology]] in the various languages of the world. In many societies kinship relations can also be formed through forms of co-habitation, adoption, fostering, or companionship, which also tends to create relations of enduring solidarity ([[nurture kinship]]).\n\n===Ethnicity===\n{{main|Ethnic group}}\nHumans often form ethnic groups, such groups tend to be larger than kinship networks and be organized around a common identity defined variously in terms of shared ancestry and history, shared cultural norms and language, or shared biological phenotype. Such ideologies of shared characteristics are often perpetuated in the form of powerful, compelling narratives that give legitimacy and continuity to the set of shared values. Ethnic groupings often correspond to some level of political organization such as the [[Band society|band]], [[tribe]], [[city state]] or nation. Although ethnic groups appear and disappear through history, members of ethnic groups often conceptualize their groups as having histories going back into the deep past. Such ideologies give ethnicity a powerful role in defining [[social identity]] and in constructing solidarity between members of an ethno-political unit. This unifying property of ethnicity has been closely tied to the rise of the [[nation state]] as the predominant form of political organization in the 19th and 20th centuries.<ref>J.

Recognition of the state's claim to independence by other states, enabling it to enter into international agreements, is often important to the establishment of its statehood. The \"state\" can also be defined in terms of domestic conditions, specifically, as conceptualized by [[Max Weber]], \"a state is a human community that (successfully) claims the monopoly of the 'legitimate' use of physical force within a given territory.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20020612070242/http://www.mdx.ac.uk/www/study/xWeb.htm Max Weber's definition of the modern state 1918], by [[Max Weber]], 1918. Retrieved 17 March 2006.</ref>\n\nGovernment can be defined as the political means of creating and enforcing laws; typically via a [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] [[hierarchy]]. Politics is the process by which decisions are made within groups; this process often involves conflict as well as compromise. Although the term is generally applied to behavior within governments, politics is also observed in all human group interactions, including corporate, academic, and religious institutions. Many different political systems exist, as do many different ways of understanding them, and many definitions overlap. Examples of governments include monarchy, [[Communist state]], [[military dictatorship]], [[theocracy]], and [[liberal democracy]], the last of which is considered dominant today. All of these issues have a direct relationship with economics.\n\n===Trade and economics===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n{{Main|Trade|Economics}}\n[[File:Tengeru market.jpg|thumb|right|[[Buyer]]s and sellers [[bargaining]] in a market in [[Tengeru]], [[Tanzania]]]]\nTrade is the voluntary exchange of goods and services, and is a form of [[economic activity]]. A mechanism that allows trade is called a [[Market (economics)|market]]. Modern traders instead generally negotiate through a [[medium of exchange]], such as money. As a result, buying can be separated from selling, or [[earnings|earning]]. Because of specialization and [[division of labor]], most people concentrate on a small aspect of manufacturing or service, trading their labor for products. Trade exists between regions because different regions have an [[Absolute advantage|absolute]] or [[comparative advantage]] in the production of some tradable commodity, or because different regions' size allows for the benefits of [[mass production]].\n\nEconomics is a [[social science]] which studies the production, distribution, trade, and consumption of goods and services. Economics focuses on measurable variables, and is broadly divided into two main branches: [[microeconomics]], which deals with individual agents, such as households and businesses, and macroeconomics, which considers the economy as a whole, in which case it considers [[aggregate supply]] and [[aggregate demand|demand]] for money, [[capital (economics)|capital]] and [[commodity|commodities]]. Aspects receiving particular attention in economics are [[resource allocation]], production, distribution, trade, and competition. Economic logic is increasingly applied to any problem that involves choice under scarcity or determining economic [[Value (economics)|value]].\n\n===War===\n[[File:Bataille Waterloo 1815 reconstitution 2011 3.jpg|thumb|Men in period costume portraying soldiers during a 2011 reenactment of the [[Battle of Waterloo]] (1815)]]\n{{Main|War}}\nWar is a state of organized armed conflict between [[State (polity)|states]] or [[non-state actors]]. War is characterized by the use of lethal violence against others\u2014whether between [[combatants]] or upon [[non-combatants]]\u2014to achieve military goals through force. Lesser, often spontaneous conflicts, such as brawls, [[riots]], [[revolts]], and [[melees]], are not considered to be warfare. Revolutions can be [[Nonviolent revolution|nonviolent]] or an organized and armed revolution which denotes a state of war. During the 20th century, it is estimated that between 167 and 188 million people died as a result of war.<ref>Ferguson, Niall. \"The Next War of the World.\" Foreign Affairs, Sep/Oct 2006</ref> A common definition defines war as a series of [[military campaign]]s between at least two opposing sides involving a dispute over [[sovereignty]], territory, [[natural resource|resources]], religion, or other issues. A war between internal elements of a state is a [[civil war]].\n\nThere have been a wide variety of [[Revolution in Military Affairs|rapidly advancing]] [[military tactics|tactics]] throughout the history of war, ranging from [[conventional war]] to [[asymmetric warfare]] to [[total war]] and [[unconventional warfare]]. Techniques include [[hand to hand combat]], the use of [[ranged weapons]], [[naval warfare]], and, more recently, [[air support]]. Military intelligence has often played a key role in determining victory and defeat. Propaganda, which often includes information, slanted opinion and disinformation, plays a key role both in maintaining unity within a warring group and in sowing discord among opponents. In [[modern warfare]], soldiers and [[combat vehicle]]s are used to control the land, [[warships]] the sea, and aircraft the sky. These fields have also overlapped in the forms of [[marines]], [[paratroopers]], [[aircraft carriers]], and [[surface-to-air missiles]], among others.

It is the discipline searching for a general understanding of reality, reasoning and values. Major fields of philosophy include [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[philosophy of mind]], and [[axiology]] (which includes ethics and [[aesthetics]]). Philosophy covers a very wide range of approaches, and is used to refer to a [[worldview]], to a perspective on an issue, or to the positions argued for by a particular philosopher or school of philosophy.\n\n===Religion and spirituality===\n{{Main|Religion|Spirituality}}\n\nReligion is generally defined as a [[belief]] system concerning the [[supernatural]], [[sacred]] or [[divinity|divine]], and practices, [[values]], institutions and [[ritual]]s associated with such belief. Some religions also have a [[moral code]]. The [[Evolutionary psychology of religion|evolution]] and the history of the [[Evolutionary origin of religions|first religions]] have recently become areas of active scientific investigation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://evolution.binghamton.edu/religion/ |title=Evolutionary Religious Studies: A New Field of Scientific Inquiry |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817171221/http://evolution.binghamton.edu/religion/ |archivedate=17 August 2009  }}</ref><ref name=Boyer2008>{{cite journal |author=Boyer, Pascal |title=Being human: Religion: bound to believe? |journal=Nature |volume=455 |issue=7216 |pages=1038\u201339 |year=2008 |pmid=18948934 |doi=10.1038/4551038a|bibcode=2008Natur.455.1038B }}</ref><ref name=Emmons2003>{{Cite journal |author1=Emmons, Robert A. |author2=Paloutzian, Raymond F. |title=The psychology of religion |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |year=2003 |pmid=12171998 |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=377\u2013402 |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145024}}</ref> However, in the course of its [[development of religion|development]], religion has taken on many forms that vary by culture and individual perspective. Some of the chief questions and issues religions are concerned with include life after death (commonly involving belief in an [[afterlife]]), the [[origin of life]], the nature of the [[universe]] ([[religious cosmology]]) and its [[ultimate fate]] ([[eschatology]]), and what is [[morality|moral]] or immoral. A common source for answers to these questions are beliefs in [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] divine beings such as [[deities]] or a singular God, although not all religions are [[theistic]]. Spirituality, belief or involvement in matters of the [[soul]] or [[spirit]], is one of the many different approaches humans take in trying to answer fundamental questions about humankind's place in the universe, the [[meaning of life]], and the ideal way to live one's life. Though these topics have also been addressed by philosophy, and to some extent by science, spirituality is unique in that it focuses on [[mystical]] or supernatural concepts such as [[karma]] and God.\n\nAlthough the exact level of religiosity can be hard to measure,<ref name=Hall2008>{{cite journal |author1=Hall, Daniel E. |author2=Meador, Keith G. |author3=Koenig, Harold G. |title=Measuring religiousness in health research: review and critique |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=134\u201363 |year=2008 |pmid=19105008 |doi=10.1007/s10943-008-9165-2 |type=Submitted manuscript }}</ref> a majority of humans professes some variety of religious or spiritual belief, although many (in some countries a majority) are [[irreligious]]. This includes humans who have no religious beliefs or do not identify with any religion. [[Humanism]] is a philosophy which seeks to include all of humanity and all issues common to humans; it is usually non-religious. Most religions and spiritual beliefs are clearly distinct from science on both a philosophical and methodological level; the two are not generally considered mutually exclusive and a majority of humans hold a mix of both scientific and religious views. The distinction between philosophy and religion, on the other hand, is at times less clear, and the two are linked in such fields as the [[philosophy of religion]] and theology.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Art, music, and literature===\n{{Main|Art|Music|Literature}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2018}}\n[[File:Lorenzo Lippi 001.jpg|thumb|upright|''Allegory of Music'' ({{circa}} 1594), a painting of a woman writing [[sheet music]] by [[Lorenzo Lippi]]]]\n\nHumans have been producing [[art]] works for at least seventy-three thousand years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/12/science/oldest-drawing-ever-found.html|title=Oldest Known Drawing by Human Hands Discovered in South African Cave|last=St. Fleur|first=Nicholas|date=12 September 2018|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=20 September 2018}}</ref> Art may be defined as a form of [[culture|cultural]] expression and the usage of narratives of liberation and exploration (i.e. [[art history]], [[art criticism]], and [[art theory]]) to mediate its boundaries.

In the modern use of the word, art is commonly understood to be the process or result of making material works that, from concept to creation, adhere to the \"creative impulse\" of human beings.\n\nMusic is a natural [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] phenomenon based on the three distinct and interrelated organization structures of rhythm, harmony, and melody. Listening to music is perhaps the most common and universal form of entertainment, while learning and understanding it are popular [[discipline]]s.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} There are a wide variety of [[music genre]]s and [[ethnic music]]s.

The earliest fossils of [[anatomically modern humans]] are from the [[Middle Paleolithic]], about 200,000 years ago such as the [[Omo remains]] of Ethiopia, the fossils of Herto sometimes classified as ''[[Homo sapiens idaltu]]'' also from Ethiopia. Earlier remains, now classified as \"archaic\" or \"early\" ''Homo sapiens'', such as the [[Jebel Irhoud]] remains from Morocco and the [[Florisbad Skull]] from South Africa, had also previously been classified by some researchers as belonging to an earlier subspecies ''H. helmei''\u2019.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=27298468|pmc=4920294|year=2016|last1=Stringer|first1=C.|title=The origin and evolution of Homo sapiens|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Another important physiological change related to sexuality in humans was the evolution of [[hidden estrus]]. Humans are the only ape in which the female is intermittently fertile year round, and in which no special signals of fertility are produced by the body (such as [[genital swelling]] during estrus). Nonetheless humans retain a degree of sexual dimorphism in the distribution of body hair and subcutaneous fat, and in the overall size, males being around 25% larger than females. These changes taken together have been interpreted as a result of an increased emphasis on [[pair bonding]] as a possible solution to the requirement for increased parental investment due to the prolonged infancy of offspring.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Rise of ''Homo sapiens''===\n[[File:Map-of-human-migrations.jpg|thumb|World map of early human migrations according to [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] [[population genetics]] (numbers are [[millennia]] before present, the North Pole is at the center).]]\n{{main|Homo sapiens}}\n{{see|Archaic human admixture with modern humans|Early human migrations|Multiregional origin of modern humans|Prehistoric autopsy|Recent African origin of modern humans}}\nBy the beginning of the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period (50,000 [[Before Present|BP]]), and likely significantly earlier by 100-70,000 years ago<ref name=\"McBrearty Brooks 2000\" /><ref name=\"Henshilwood Marean 2003\" /><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Henshilwood | first1 = C.

The comparatively minor anatomical differences between humans and [[Pan (genus)|chimpanzee]]s are largely a result of human [[bipedalism]] and larger brain size.

The construction of the [[human pelvis]] differs from other [[primate]]s, as do the toes. A trade-off for these advantages of the modern human pelvis is that childbirth is more difficult and dangerous than in most [[mammal]]s, especially given the larger head size of human [[babies]] compared to other primates. Human babies must turn around as they pass through the birth canal while other primates do not, which makes humans the only species where females usually require help from their [[conspecific]]s (other members of their own species) to reduce the risks of birthing. As a partial [[evolution]]ary solution, human fetuses are born [[Altricial|less developed and more vulnerable]]. Chimpanzee babies are cognitively more developed than human babies until the age of six months, when the rapid development of human brains surpasses chimpanzees. Another difference between women and chimpanzee females is that women go through the [[menopause]] and become [[Infertility|unfertile]] decades before the end of their lives. All species of non-human apes are capable of giving birth until death. Menopause probably developed as it provides an evolutionary advantage of more caring time to relatives' young.<ref name=\"O'Neil\"/>\n\nApart from bipedalism, humans differ from chimpanzees mostly in [[smelling]], [[hearing]], [[digesting]] [[protein]]s, [[brain size]], and the ability of [[language]]. Humans' brains are about three times bigger than in chimpanzees. More importantly, the brain to body ratio is much higher in humans than in chimpanzees, and humans have a significantly more developed [[cerebral cortex]], with a larger number of [[neurons]]. The mental abilities of humans are remarkable compared to other apes. Humans' ability of [[speech]] is unique among primates. Humans are able to create new and complex [[idea]]s, and to develop technology, which is unprecedented among other [[organism]]s on [[Earth]].<ref name=\"O'Neil\"/>\n\nIt is estimated that the worldwide average [[Human height|height for an adult human]] male is about {{Height|cm=172}},{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} while the worldwide average height for adult human females is about {{Height|cm=158}}.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Shrinkage of stature may begin in middle age in some individuals, but tends to be typical in the extremely [[Old age|aged]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Senior Citizens Do Shrink \u2013 Just One of the Body Changes of Aging |url=http://seniorjournal.com/NEWS/Aging/5-11-28-SeniorsDoShrink.htm |work=News |publisher=Senior Journal |accessdate=6 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219004303/http://seniorjournal.com/NEWS/Aging/5-11-28-SeniorsDoShrink.htm |archivedate=19 February 2013 |df=}}</ref> Through history human populations have universally become taller, probably as a consequence of better nutrition, healthcare, and living conditions.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Bogin B, Rios L |title=Rapid morphological change in living humans: implications for modern human origins |journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology A |volume=136 |issue=1 |pages=71\u201384 |date=September 2003 |pmid=14527631 |doi=10.1016/S1095-6433(02)00294-5}}</ref> The average [[Body weight|mass]] of an adult human is {{Convert|54|-|64|kg|lb|abbr=on|lk=off|0}} for females and {{Convert|70|-|83|kg|lb|abbr=on|lk=off|0}} for males.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.articleworld.org/index.php/Human_weight |title=Human weight |publisher=Articleworld.org |accessdate=10 December 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208053451/http://articleworld.org/index.php/Human_weight |archivedate=8 December 2011  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/AlexSchlessingerman.shtml |title=Mass Of An Adult |publisher=The Physics Factbook: An Encyclopedia of Scientific Essays |accessdate=31 December 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101030223/https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/AlexSchlessingerman.shtml |archivedate=1 January 2018  }}</ref> Like many other conditions, body weight and body type is influenced by both genetic susceptibility and environment and varies greatly among individuals.

During this process, the male inserts his [[erect penis]] into the female's [[vagina]] and [[ejaculate]]s semen, which contains sperm. The sperm travels through the vagina and cervix into the uterus or Fallopian tubes for [[human fertilization|fertilization]] of the ovum. Upon fertilization and [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]], gestation then occurs within the female's [[uterus]].\n\nThe [[zygote]] divides inside the female's uterus to become an [[embryo]], which over a period of 38 weeks (9 months) of [[gestation]] becomes a [[fetus]]. After this span of time, the fully grown fetus is [[childbirth|birthed]] from the woman's body and breathes independently as an infant for the first time. At this point, most modern cultures recognize the baby as a person entitled to the full protection of the law, though some jurisdictions extend various levels of [[personhood]] earlier to human fetuses while they remain in the uterus.\n\nCompared with other species, human childbirth is dangerous.

The genetic difference between sexes contributes to anatomical, hormonal, neural, and physiological differences between men and women, although the exact degree and nature of social and environmental influences on sexes are not completely understood. Males on average are 15% heavier and {{Convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on|lk=off|0}} taller than females. There is a difference between body types, body organs and systems, hormonal levels, sensory systems, and muscle mass between sexes. On average, men have about 40\u201350% more upper body strength and 20\u201330% more lower body strength than women. Women generally have a higher [[body fat]] percentage than men. Women have [[Human skin color#sexual dimorphism|lighter skin]] than men of the same population; this has been explained by a higher need for vitamin D (which is synthesized by sunlight) in females during pregnancy and [[lactation]]. As there are chromosomal differences between females and males, some X and Y chromosome related conditions and [[Disease|disorders]] only affect either men or women.

Most human biological variation is [[Cline (biology)|clinally]] distributed and blends gradually from one area to the next. Groups of people around the world have different frequencies of [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] genes. Furthermore, different traits are non-concordant and each have different clinal distribution. Adaptability varies both from person to person and from population to population. The most efficient adaptive responses are found in geographical populations where the environmental stimuli are the strongest (e.g. [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] are highly adapted to high altitudes). The clinal geographic genetic variation is further complicated by the migration and mixing between human populations which has been occurring since prehistoric times.<ref name=\"roberts1\"/><ref name=adapt3>{{cite web |last=O'Neil |first=Dennis |title=Adapting to High Altitude |url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/adapt/adapt_3.htm |work=Human Biological Adaptability |publisher=Palomar College |accessdate=6 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106210055/http://anthro.palomar.edu/adapt/adapt_3.htm |archivedate=6 January 2013 |df=}}</ref><ref name=adapt03>{{cite web |last=O'Neil |first=Dennis |title=Overview |url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/adapt/adapt_1.htm |work=Human Biological Adaptability |publisher=Palomar College |accessdate=6 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306124405/http://anthro.palomar.edu/adapt/adapt_1.htm |archivedate=6 March 2013 |df=}}</ref><ref name=\"vary02\">{{cite web |last=O'Neil |first=Dennis |title=Models of Classification |url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/vary/vary_2.htm |work=Modern Human Variation |publisher=Palomar College |accessdate=6 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106212400/http://anthro.palomar.edu/vary/vary_2.htm |archivedate=6 January 2013 |df=}}</ref><ref name=\"pbsmarks1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_04-background-01-08.htm|title=Interview with Jonathan Marks|last=Marks|first=Jonathan|date=|work=Race \u2013 The Power of an Illusion|publisher=PBS|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112143244/http://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_04-background-01-08.htm|archivedate=12 November 2012|accessdate=6 January 2013|layurl=https://www.pbs.org/race/000_General/000_00-Home.htm}}</ref><ref name=\"pbsgoodman1\">{{cite web |last=Goodman |first=Alan |title=Background Readings |url=https://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_04-background-01-10.htm |work=Race \u2013 Power of an Illusion |publisher=PBS |accessdate=6 January 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523034420/http://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_04-background-01-10.htm |archivedate=23 May 2013  }}</ref>\n\nHuman variation is highly non-concordant: most of the genes do not cluster together and are not inherited together. Skin and hair color are not correlated to height, weight, or athletic ability. Human species do not share the same patterns of variation through geography. Skin color varies with latitude and certain people are tall or have brown hair. There is a statistical correlation between particular features in a population, but different features are not expressed or inherited together. Thus, genes which code for superficial physical traits\u2014such as skin color, hair color, or height\u2014represent a minuscule and insignificant portion of the human genome and do not correlate with genetic affinity.

Humans are variously said to possess consciousness, [[self-awareness]], and a mind, which correspond roughly to the mental processes of [[thought]]. These are said to possess qualities such as self-awareness, [[sentience]], [[sapience]], and the ability to perceive the relationship between [[Personal identity|oneself]] and one's [[natural environment|environment]]. The extent to which the mind constructs or experiences the outer world is a matter of debate, as are the definitions and validity of many of the terms used above.\n\nThe physical aspects of the mind and brain, and by extension of the nervous system, are studied in the field of [[neurology]], the more behavioral in the field of psychology, and a sometimes loosely defined area between in the field of psychiatry, which treats mental illness and behavioral disorders. Psychology does not necessarily refer to the brain or nervous system, and can be framed purely in terms of [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]] or [[information processing]] theories of the mind. Increasingly, however, an understanding of brain functions is being included in psychological theory and practice, particularly in areas such as [[artificial intelligence]], [[neuropsychology]], and [[cognitive neuroscience]].\n\nThe nature of thought is central to psychology and related fields. [[Cognitive psychology]] studies [[cognition]], the [[mental function|mental processes']] underlying behavior. It uses [[information processing]] as a framework for understanding the mind. Perception, learning, problem solving, memory, attention, language and emotion are all well researched areas as well. Cognitive psychology is associated with a school of thought known as [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]], whose adherents argue for an [[information processing]] model of mental function, informed by [[positivism]] and [[experimental psychology]]. Techniques and models from cognitive psychology are widely applied and form the mainstay of psychological theories in many areas of both research and applied psychology. Largely focusing on the development of the human mind through the life span, [[developmental psychology]] seeks to understand how people come to perceive, understand, and act within the world and how these processes change as they age. This may focus on intellectual, cognitive, neural, social, or [[moral development]]. [[Psychologists]] have developed [[intelligence]] [[Test (assessment)|tests]] and the concept of [[intelligence quotient]] in order to assess the relative intelligence of human beings and study its [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] among population.<ref>{{Britannica|289811|Intelligence test}}</ref>\n\nSome philosophers divide consciousness into phenomenal consciousness, which is experience itself, and access consciousness, which is the processing of the things in experience.<ref name=\"Bl\">Ned Block: ''On a Confusion about a Function of Consciousness'' in: ''The Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 1995.</ref> Phenomenal consciousness is the state of being conscious, such as when they say \"I am conscious.\" Access consciousness is being conscious ''of'' something in relation to abstract concepts, such as when one says \"I am conscious of these words.\" Various forms of access consciousness include awareness, self-awareness, conscience, [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Husserl's phenomenology]], and [[intentionality]]. The concept of phenomenal consciousness, in modern history, according to some, is closely related to the concept of [[qualia]]. [[Social psychology]] links sociology with psychology in their shared study of the nature and causes of human social interaction, with an emphasis on how people think towards each other and how they relate to each other. The behavior and mental processes, both human and non-human, can be described through [[animal cognition]], [[ethology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], and [[comparative psychology]] as well.

Furthermore, [[incentive]] and [[preference]] are both factors, as are any perceived links between incentives and preferences. [[Volition_(psychology)|Volition]] may also be involved, in which case willpower is also a factor. Ideally, both motivation and volition ensure the selection, striving for, and [[Realisation (metrology)|realization]] of goals in an optimal manner, a [[Function_(biology)|function]] beginning in childhood and continuing throughout a lifetime in a process known as [[socialization]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Heckhausen, J.|author2=Heckhausen, H.|author-link= |date=28 March 2018\n|title=Motivation and Action|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-65094-4_1|location=Introduction and Overview|publisher=Springer, Cham\n|page=1|isbn=978-3-319-65093-7|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-65094-4_1}}</ref>\n\nHappiness, or the state of being happy, is a human emotional condition. The definition of happiness is a common philosophical topic. Some people might define it as the best condition that a human can have\u2014a condition of [[mental health|mental]] and physical health. Others define it as [[wikt:freedom|freedom]] from want and [[suffering|distress]]; consciousness of the [[goodness and value theory|good]] order of things; assurance of one's place in the [[universe]] or society.\n\nEmotion has a significant influence on, or can even be said to control, human behavior, though historically many cultures and philosophers have for various reasons discouraged allowing this influence to go unchecked. Emotional experiences perceived as [[pleasure|pleasant]], such as love, [[admiration]], or [[joy]], contrast with those perceived as [[suffering|unpleasant]], like [[hate]], [[envy]], or [[sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]]. The [[Stoicism|Stoics]] believed excessive emotion was harmful, while some [[Sufi]] teachers felt certain extreme emotions could yield a conceptual perfection, what is often translated as [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]].\n\nIn modern scientific thought, certain refined emotions are considered a complex neural trait innate in a variety of [[domesticated animal|domesticated]] and non-domesticated [[mammal]]s. These were commonly developed in reaction to superior survival mechanisms and intelligent interaction with each other and the environment; as such, refined emotion is not in all cases as discrete and separate from natural neural function as was once assumed. However, when humans function in civilized tandem, it has been noted that uninhibited acting on extreme emotion can lead to social disorder and crime.\n\n===Sexuality and love===\n{{Main|Love|Human sexuality}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Sweet Baby Kisses Family Love.jpg|thumb|Human parents continue caring for their offspring long after they are born.]]\nFor humans, sexuality has important social functions: it creates physical intimacy, bonds and hierarchies among individuals, besides ensuring biological [[reproduction]]. Sexual desire, or ''[[libido]]'', is experienced as a bodily urge, often accompanied by strong emotions such as love, [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]] and [[jealousy]]. The significance of sexuality in the human species is reflected in a number of physical features, among them hidden [[ovulation]], the evolution of external [[scrotum]] and (among great apes) a relatively large [[human penis|penis]] suggesting [[human sperm competition|sperm competition in humans]], the absence of an [[Baculum|os penis]], permanent [[secondary sexual characteristics]] and the forming of [[pair bond]]s based on sexual attraction as a common social structure. Contrary to other primates that often advertise [[estrus]] through visible signs, human females do not have a distinct or visible signs of ovulation, plus they experience sexual desire outside of their fertile periods.\n\nHuman choices in acting on sexuality are commonly influenced by social norms which vary between cultures.

family-based social structures.]]\nHumans are highly social beings and tend to live in large complex social groups. More than any other creature, humans are capable of using systems of communication for self-expression, the exchange of ideas, and [[social organization|organization]], and as such have created complex [[social structures]] composed of many cooperating and competing groups. Human groups range from the size of families to nations. Social interactions between humans have established an extremely wide variety{{clarify|date=January 2014}} of values, social norms, and rituals, which together form the basis of human society.\n\nCulture is defined here as patterns of complex symbolic behavior, i.e. all behavior that is not innate but which has to be learned through social interaction with others; such as the use of distinctive [[material culture|material]] and [[symbolic system]]s, including language, ritual, social organization, traditions, beliefs and technology.\n\n===Language===\nWhile many species [[animal communication|communicate]], [[language]] is unique to humans, a defining feature of humanity, and a [[cultural universal]].

Human language also has the capacity of [[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]], using words to represent things and happenings that are not presently or locally occurring, but reside in the shared imagination of interlocutors.<ref name=\"Revolution\"/> Language differs from other forms of communication in that it is [[Origin of speech#Modality-independence|modality independent]]; the same meanings can be conveyed through different media, auditively in speech, visually by sign language or writing, and even through tactile media such as [[braille]]. Language is central to the communication between humans, and to the sense of identity that unites nations, cultures and ethnic groups. The invention of writing systems at least five thousand years ago allowed the preservation of language on material objects, and was a major technological advancement. The science of [[linguistics]] describes the structure and function of language and the relationship between languages. There are approximately six thousand different languages currently in use, including [[sign language]]s, and many thousands more that are [[extinct language|extinct]].<ref name=Comrie1996>{{cite book |author1=Comrie, Bernard |author2=Polinsky, Maria |author3=Matthews, Stephen |title=The Atlas of Languages: The Origin and Development of Languages Throughout the World |year=1996 |publisher=Facts on File |location=New York City |pages=13\u201315 |isbn=978-0-8160-3388-1}}</ref>\n\n===Gender roles===\n{{Main|Gender role|Gender}}\nThe sexual division of humans into male, female, and in some societies other genders<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/content/two-spirits_map-html/ |title=A Map of Gender-Diverse Cultures &#124; Independent Lens |publisher=PBS |date=11 August 2015 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref> has been marked culturally by a corresponding division of roles, norms, [[practice (social theory)|practices]], dress, behavior, rights, [[duty|duties]], [[Privilege (social inequality)|privileges]], [[social status|status]], and [[power (philosophy)|power]]. [[Cultural identity|Cultural differences]] by gender have often been believed to have arisen naturally out of a division of reproductive labor; the biological fact that women give birth led to their further cultural responsibility for nurturing and caring for children. Gender roles have varied historically, and challenges to predominant gender norms have recurred in many societies.\n\n===Kinship===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n{{main|Kinship|Marriage}}\n[[File:thedragonpainter.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sessue Hayakawa]] (left) with actress and wife [[Tsuru Aoki]] in a screen shot of the 1919 film ''[[The Dragon Painter]]''.]]\n\nAll human societies organize, recognize and classify types of social relationships based on relations between parents and children ([[consanguinity]]), and relations through marriage ([[Affinity (law)|affinity]]). These kinds of relations are generally called kinship relations. In most societies kinship places mutual responsibilities and expectations of solidarity on the individuals that are so related, and those who recognize each other as kinsmen come to form networks through which other social institutions can be regulated. Among the many functions of kinship is the ability to form [[descent group]]s, groups of people sharing a common line of descent, which can function as political units such as [[clan]]s. Another function is the way in which kinship unites families through marriage, forming [[Alliance theory|kinship alliances]] between groups of wife-takers and wife-givers. Such alliances also often have important political and economical ramifications, and may result in the formation of political organization above the community level. Kinship relations often includes regulations for whom an individual should or shouldn't marry. All societies have rules of [[incest taboo]], according to which marriage between certain kinds of kin relations are prohibited\u2014such rules vary widely between cultures.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Some societies also have rules of preferential marriage with certain kin relations, frequently with either [[Parallel and cross cousins|cross or parallel cousins]]. Rules and norms for marriage and social behavior among kinsfolk is often reflected in the systems of [[kinship terminology]] in the various languages of the world. In many societies kinship relations can also be formed through forms of co-habitation, adoption, fostering, or companionship, which also tends to create relations of enduring solidarity ([[nurture kinship]]).\n\n===Ethnicity===\n{{main|Ethnic group}}\nHumans often form ethnic groups, such groups tend to be larger than kinship networks and be organized around a common identity defined variously in terms of shared ancestry and history, shared cultural norms and language, or shared biological phenotype. Such ideologies of shared characteristics are often perpetuated in the form of powerful, compelling narratives that give legitimacy and continuity to the set of shared values. Ethnic groupings often correspond to some level of political organization such as the [[Band society|band]], [[tribe]], [[city state]] or nation. Although ethnic groups appear and disappear through history, members of ethnic groups often conceptualize their groups as having histories going back into the deep past. Such ideologies give ethnicity a powerful role in defining [[social identity]] and in constructing solidarity between members of an ethno-political unit. This unifying property of ethnicity has been closely tied to the rise of the [[nation state]] as the predominant form of political organization in the 19th and 20th centuries.<ref>J.

Within a society people can be divided into different groups according to their income, wealth, [[power (social and political)|power]], [[reputation]], etc., but the structure of [[social stratification]] and the degree of [[social mobility]] differs, especially between modern and traditional societies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.unitn.it/files/download/8481/srs_schizzerotto_social_stratification_2_as.pdf |title=Social Stratification |last=Schizzerotto |first=Antonio |publisher=[[University of Trento]] |access-date=3 July 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320150018/http://web.unitn.it/files/download/8481/srs_schizzerotto_social_stratification_2_as.pdf |archivedate=20 March 2018  }}</ref> A state is an organized political community occupying a definite territory, having an organized government, and possessing internal and external [[sovereignty]]. Recognition of the state's claim to independence by other states, enabling it to enter into international agreements, is often important to the establishment of its statehood. The \"state\" can also be defined in terms of domestic conditions, specifically, as conceptualized by [[Max Weber]], \"a state is a human community that (successfully) claims the monopoly of the 'legitimate' use of physical force within a given territory.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20020612070242/http://www.mdx.ac.uk/www/study/xWeb.htm Max Weber's definition of the modern state 1918], by [[Max Weber]], 1918. Retrieved 17 March 2006.</ref>\n\nGovernment can be defined as the political means of creating and enforcing laws; typically via a [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] [[hierarchy]]. Politics is the process by which decisions are made within groups; this process often involves conflict as well as compromise. Although the term is generally applied to behavior within governments, politics is also observed in all human group interactions, including corporate, academic, and religious institutions. Many different political systems exist, as do many different ways of understanding them, and many definitions overlap. Examples of governments include monarchy, [[Communist state]], [[military dictatorship]], [[theocracy]], and [[liberal democracy]], the last of which is considered dominant today. All of these issues have a direct relationship with economics.\n\n===Trade and economics===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n{{Main|Trade|Economics}}\n[[File:Tengeru market.jpg|thumb|right|[[Buyer]]s and sellers [[bargaining]] in a market in [[Tengeru]], [[Tanzania]]]]\nTrade is the voluntary exchange of goods and services, and is a form of [[economic activity]]. A mechanism that allows trade is called a [[Market (economics)|market]]. Modern traders instead generally negotiate through a [[medium of exchange]], such as money. As a result, buying can be separated from selling, or [[earnings|earning]]. Because of specialization and [[division of labor]], most people concentrate on a small aspect of manufacturing or service, trading their labor for products. Trade exists between regions because different regions have an [[Absolute advantage|absolute]] or [[comparative advantage]] in the production of some tradable commodity, or because different regions' size allows for the benefits of [[mass production]].\n\nEconomics is a [[social science]] which studies the production, distribution, trade, and consumption of goods and services. Economics focuses on measurable variables, and is broadly divided into two main branches: [[microeconomics]], which deals with individual agents, such as households and businesses, and macroeconomics, which considers the economy as a whole, in which case it considers [[aggregate supply]] and [[aggregate demand|demand]] for money, [[capital (economics)|capital]] and [[commodity|commodities]]. Aspects receiving particular attention in economics are [[resource allocation]], production, distribution, trade, and competition. Economic logic is increasingly applied to any problem that involves choice under scarcity or determining economic [[Value (economics)|value]].\n\n===War===\n[[File:Bataille Waterloo 1815 reconstitution 2011 3.jpg|thumb|Men in period costume portraying soldiers during a 2011 reenactment of the [[Battle of Waterloo]] (1815)]]\n{{Main|War}}\nWar is a state of organized armed conflict between [[State (polity)|states]] or [[non-state actors]]. War is characterized by the use of lethal violence against others\u2014whether between [[combatants]] or upon [[non-combatants]]\u2014to achieve military goals through force. Lesser, often spontaneous conflicts, such as brawls, [[riots]], [[revolts]], and [[melees]], are not considered to be warfare. Revolutions can be [[Nonviolent revolution|nonviolent]] or an organized and armed revolution which denotes a state of war. During the 20th century, it is estimated that between 167 and 188 million people died as a result of war.<ref>Ferguson, Niall. \"The Next War of the World.\" Foreign Affairs, Sep/Oct 2006</ref> A common definition defines war as a series of [[military campaign]]s between at least two opposing sides involving a dispute over [[sovereignty]], territory, [[natural resource|resources]], religion, or other issues. A war between internal elements of a state is a [[civil war]].\n\nThere have been a wide variety of [[Revolution in Military Affairs|rapidly advancing]] [[military tactics|tactics]] throughout the history of war, ranging from [[conventional war]] to [[asymmetric warfare]] to [[total war]] and [[unconventional warfare]]. Techniques include [[hand to hand combat]], the use of [[ranged weapons]], [[naval warfare]], and, more recently, [[air support]]. Military intelligence has often played a key role in determining victory and defeat. Propaganda, which often includes information, slanted opinion and disinformation, plays a key role both in maintaining unity within a warring group and in sowing discord among opponents. In [[modern warfare]], soldiers and [[combat vehicle]]s are used to control the land, [[warships]] the sea, and aircraft the sky. These fields have also overlapped in the forms of [[marines]], [[paratroopers]], [[aircraft carriers]], and [[surface-to-air missiles]], among others. [[Satellites]] in [[low Earth orbit]] have made outer space a factor in warfare as well through their use for detailed intelligence gathering; however, no known aggressive actions have been [[space warfare|taken from space]].\n\n===Material culture and technology===\n{{Main|Tool|Technology}}\n[[File:N\u00e9olithique 0001.jpg|thumb|An array of [[Neolithic]] artifacts, including bracelets, axe heads, chisels, and polishing tools.]]\nStone tools were used by proto-humans at least 2.5&nbsp;million years ago.<ref name=Clark1994>{{cite journal |author1=Clark, J.D. |author2=de Heinzelin, J. |author3=Schick, K.D. |title=African ''Homo erectus'': old radiometric ages and young Oldowan assemblages in the Middle Awash Valley, Ethiopia |journal=Science |year=1994 |volume=264 |issue=5167 |pages=1907\u201310 |pmid=8009220 |doi=10.1126/science.8009220|display-authors=etal|bibcode=1994Sci...264.1907C }}</ref> The [[Control of fire by early humans|controlled use of fire]] began around 1.5&nbsp;million years ago.

It is the discipline searching for a general understanding of reality, reasoning and values. Major fields of philosophy include [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[philosophy of mind]], and [[axiology]] (which includes ethics and [[aesthetics]]). Philosophy covers a very wide range of approaches, and is used to refer to a [[worldview]], to a perspective on an issue, or to the positions argued for by a particular philosopher or school of philosophy.\n\n===Religion and spirituality===\n{{Main|Religion|Spirituality}}\n\nReligion is generally defined as a [[belief]] system concerning the [[supernatural]], [[sacred]] or [[divinity|divine]], and practices, [[values]], institutions and [[ritual]]s associated with such belief.

A common source for answers to these questions are beliefs in [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] divine beings such as [[deities]] or a singular God, although not all religions are [[theistic]]. Spirituality, belief or involvement in matters of the [[soul]] or [[spirit]], is one of the many different approaches humans take in trying to answer fundamental questions about humankind's place in the universe, the [[meaning of life]], and the ideal way to live one's life. Though these topics have also been addressed by philosophy, and to some extent by science, spirituality is unique in that it focuses on [[mystical]] or supernatural concepts such as [[karma]] and God.\n\nAlthough the exact level of religiosity can be hard to measure,<ref name=Hall2008>{{cite journal |author1=Hall, Daniel E. |author2=Meador, Keith G. |author3=Koenig, Harold G. |title=Measuring religiousness in health research: review and critique |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=134\u201363 |year=2008 |pmid=19105008 |doi=10.1007/s10943-008-9165-2 |type=Submitted manuscript }}</ref> a majority of humans professes some variety of religious or spiritual belief, although many (in some countries a majority) are [[irreligious]].

Most religions and spiritual beliefs are clearly distinct from science on both a philosophical and methodological level; the two are not generally considered mutually exclusive and a majority of humans hold a mix of both scientific and religious views.

The song is about a midnight watchman confiding in a waitress, while drinking gin, about a woman that he met the night before and had a [[one-night stand]] .\n\nReleased as a single, the song reached No. 18 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles|Bubbling Under]] chart. A live version, from the 1976 album ''[[Greatest Stories Live]]'', reached No. 86 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart.\n\nAccording to Chapin, it was his favorite song that he wrote.\n\n==Story==\nThe song begins with \"a little man\" sitting at a bar, looking glum. The waitress, who is described as a \"big ol' friendly girl\", notices this in him and asks him what his problem is. The little man ignores the waitress at first, but after \"a couple of sips\" of [[gin]], he begins to tell her his story.\n\nThe song then takes the little man's point of view as he states that he is a [[watchman (law enforcement)|midnight watchman]] at a place called Miller's Tool & Die. One week earlier, he goes to a diner and sees a beautiful girl. Though worried that she's too good for him, the little man still attempts to \"give her one good try.\" Stammering, he makes a fool of himself, but the girl takes his offer, saying in the song's refrain:\n: ''If you want me to come with you\n: ''then that's all right with me\n: ''Because I've been goin' nowhere\n: ''And anywhere's a better place to be''\n\nThe little man takes her home and attempts to turn on the lights as he enters his room, but the girl tells him to leave the lights off because she \"doesn't mind the dark\".  The little man cannot believe his good luck, and tries again to speak to the girl, who says only:\n: ''If you want to come here with me\n: ''then that's all right with me\n: ''because I've been oh so lonely\n: ''Loving someone is a better way to be.''\n\nThe next day, the little man watches her sleep and leaves early so he can return and surprise her with breakfast. When he returns, he finds she has gone, leaving behind a \"six word letter, saying 'It's time that I moved on.'\"\n\nAfter the little man's story, the tearful waitress tells him she wishes that she too were beautiful so she could go home with the little man. He responds to the waitress a \"crooked grin\", finishes his drink, and acknowledges their shared loneliness by repeating the song's first refrain. He says if she wants him to go home with her \"that's alright with [him]\" implying he will go home with her.\n\nAlthough Harry often wrote songs about his own life experiences, it is not known if the \"early morning bar room\" or factory in Watertown actually existed or does today.\n\n==Chart Performance==\n===Weekly Charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1972\u201373)\n!align=\"left\"|Peak<br />position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|U.S. ''[[Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles]]''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|118\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Canadian Adult Contemporary''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|51\n|}\n\n==Live Version==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = A Better Place to Be (Live)\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Harry Chapin]]\n| album      = [[Greatest Stories Live]]\n| released   = April 1976\n| format     =\n| recorded   = 1976\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = [[Folk rock]]\n| length     = 9:59\n| label      = [[Elektra Records]]\n| writer     = [[Harry Chapin]]\n| producer   = [[Steve Chapin|Stephen Chapin]], [[Fred Kewley]], [[Paul Leka]]\n| prev_title = [[Dreams Go By]]\n| prev_year  = 1975\n| next_title = [[Dance Band on the Titanic (song)|Dance Band on the Titanic]]\n| next_year  = 1977\n}}\nThe song was released as a single on the live album, [[Greatest Stories Live]].

Uruartri itself was in the region around [[Lake Van]]. The Nairi states were repeatedly subjected to further attacks and invasions by the [[Middle Assyrian Empire|Middle]] and [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]]s, which lay to the south in [[Upper Mesopotamia]] (\"the Jazirah\") and northern [[Syria (region)|Syria]], especially under [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] (c. 1240&nbsp;BCE), [[Tiglath-Pileser I]] (c. 1100&nbsp;BCE), [[Ashur-bel-kala]] (c. 1070&nbsp;BCE), [[Adad-nirari II]] (c. 900 BCE), [[Tukulti-Ninurta II]] (c. 890 BCE), and [[Ashurnasirpal II]] (883\u2013859&nbsp;BC).\n\nUrartu reemerged in Assyrian language inscriptions in the ninth century BCE as a powerful northern rival to the Neo-Assyrian Empire. The Nairi states and tribes became unified kingdom under King [[Arame of Urartu]] (c. 860\u2013843&nbsp;BCE), whose capitals, first at Sugunia and then at [[Arzashkun]], were captured by the Assyrians under the Neo-Assyrian emperor [[Shalmaneser III]]. \n\nUrartologist Paul Zimansky speculated that the Urartians, or at least their ruling family after Arame, may have emigrated northwest into the Lake Van region from their religious capital of [[Musasir]].<ref name=\"Urartian_and_the_Urartians Zimansky pp. 557\">[https://www.academia.edu/10023756/Urartian_and_the_Urartians Zimansky, Paul ''Urartu and the Urartians'', pp. 557]</ref> According to Zimansky, the Urartian ruling class were few in number and governed over an ethnically, culturally, and linguistically diverse population.

Within a short time it became one of the largest and most powerful states in the [[Near East]]<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n[[Sarduri I]] (c. 832\u2013820&nbsp;BCE), the son of Lutipri, established a new dynasty and successfully resisted Assyrian attacks from the south led by Shalmaneser III, consolidated the military power of the state, and moved the capital to [[Tushpa]] (modern [[Van, Turkey]] on the shore of Lake Van). His son, Ispuini (c. 820\u2013800&nbsp;BCE) annexed the neighbouring state of Musasir, which became an important religious center of the Urartian Kingdom, and introduced the cult of [[\u1e2aaldi]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIspuini was also the first Urartian king to write in the Urartian language (previous kings left records written in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> He made his son [[Sarduri II]] viceroy. After conquering Musasir, Ispuini was in turn attacked by [[Shamshi-Adad V]]. His co-regent and subsequent successor, [[Menua]] (c. 800\u2013785&nbsp;BCE) also enlarged the kingdom greatly and left inscriptions over a wide area. During Ispuini's and Menua's joint rule, they shifted from referring to their territory as Nairi, instead opting for ''Bianili''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nUrartu reached the highest point of its military might under Menua's son [[Argishti I of Urartu|Argishti I]] (c. 785\u2013760&nbsp;BCE), becoming one of the most powerful kingdoms of ancient Near East. Argishti I added more territories along the [[Aras (river)|Aras]] and [[Lake Sevan]], and frustrated [[Shalmaneser IV]]'s campaigns against him. Argishti also founded several new cities, most notably Erebuni Fortress in 782&nbsp;BCE. 6600 captured slaves worked on the construction of the new city.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n[[File:Niche and base for a destroyed Urartian statue.

This in turn helped Urartu enter a long period of development and prosperity, which continued through the reign of Argishti's son [[Rusa II]] (685\u2013645&nbsp;BC).\n\nAfter Rusa II, however, Urartu grew weaker under constant attacks from Cimmerian and [[Scythian]] invaders.

Late during the 7th century&nbsp;BC (during or after Sarduri III's reign), Urartu was invaded by [[Scythians]] and their allies\u2014the [[Medes]]. In 612&nbsp;BC, the Median king [[Cyaxares the Great]] together with [[Nabopolassar]] of [[Babylon]] and the Scythians conquered Assyria after it had been  irreversibly weakened by civil war.

F. B. Lynch|Lynch, H.F.B.]] ''Armenia, Travels and Studies, Volume 2''. London: Longmans, 1901, p. 54.</ref> Schulz discovered and copied numerous [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] inscriptions, partly in Assyrian and partly in a hitherto unknown language. Schulz also discovered the ''[[Kelishin stele]]'', bearing an Assyrian-Urartian bilingual inscription, located on the [[Kelishin]] pass on the current Iraqi-Iranian border. A summary account of his initial discoveries was published in 1828. Schulz and four of his servants were murdered by [[Kurdish people|Kurd]]s in 1829 near {{lang|tr|Ba\u015fkale}}. His notes were later recovered and published in Paris in 1840. In 1828, the British Assyriologist [[Henry Creswicke Rawlinson]] had attempted to copy the inscription on the Kelishin stele, but failed because of the ice on the stele's front side. The German scholar R. Rosch made a similar attempt a few years later, but he and his party were attacked and killed.\n\nIn the late 1840s Sir [[Austen Henry Layard]] examined and described the Urartian rock-cut tombs of [[Van Castle]], including the [[Argishtis I of Urartu|Argishti]] chamber. From the 1870s, local residents began to plunder the Toprakkale ruins, selling its artefacts to European collections. In the 1880s this site underwent a poorly executed excavation organised by [[Hormuzd Rassam]] on behalf of the [[British Museum]]. Almost nothing was properly documented.\n\nThe first systematic collection of Urartian inscriptions, and thus the beginning of Urartology as a specialized field dates to the 1870s, with the campaign of Sir [[Archibald Henry Sayce]]. The German engineer Karl Sester, discoverer of [[Mount Nemrut]], collected more inscriptions in 1890/1.\n[[Waldemar Belck]] visited the area in 1891, discovering the Rusa stele. A further expedition planned for 1893 was prevented by Turkish-Armenian hostilities. Belck together with Lehmann-Haupt visited the area again in 1898/9, excavating Toprakkale. On this expedition, Belck reached the Kelishin stele, but he was attacked by Kurds and barely escaped with his life. Belck and Lehmann-Haupt reached the stele again in a second attempt, but were again prevented from copying the inscription by weather conditions. After another assault on Belck provoked the diplomatic intervention of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] agreed to pay Belck a sum of 80,000 gold marks in reparation. During [[World War I]], the Lake Van region briefly fell under Russian control. In 1916, the Russian scholars [[Nikolay Yakovlevich Marr]] and [[Iosif Abgarovich Orbeli]], excavating at the Van fortress, uncovered a four-faced stele carrying the annals of Sarduri II. In 1939 [[Boris Borisovich Piotrovsky]] excavated [[Karmir-Blur]], discovering [[Teishebai|Tei\u0161ebai]], the city of the god of war, [[Theispas|Tei\u0161eba]]. Excavations by the American scholars [[Kirsopp Lake|Kirsopp]] and Silva Lake during 1938-40 were cut short by [[World War II]], and most of their finds and field records were lost when a German submarine torpedoed their ship, the {{SS|Athenia|1922|6}}. Their surviving documents were published by [[Manfred Korfmann]] in 1977.\n\nA new phase of excavations began after the war. Excavations were at first restricted to [[Soviet Armenia]]. The fortress of Karmir Blur, dating from the reign of Rusa II, was excavated by a team headed by Boris Piotrovsky, and for the first time the excavators of a Urartian site published their findings systematically. Beginning in 1956 [[Charles A. Burney]] identified and sketch-surveyed many Urartian sites in the Lake Van area and, from 1959, a Turkish expedition under [[Tahsin \u00d6zg\u00fc\u00e7]] excavated Altintepe and Arif Erzen.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Urartian sites in northwest Iran were excavated. In 1976, an Italian team led by Mirjo Salvini finally reached the Kelishin stele, accompanied by a heavy military escort. The [[Gulf War]] then closed these sites to archaeological research. Oktay Belli resumed excavation of Urartian sites on Turkish territory: in 1989 Ayanis, a 7th-century BC fortress built by [[Rusas II of Urartu]], was discovered 35&nbsp;km north of Van. In spite of excavations, only a third to a half of the 300 known Urartian sites in Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Armenia have been examined by archaeologists (Wartke 1993). Without protection, many sites have been plundered by local residents searching for treasure and other saleable antiquities.\n\nOn 12 November 2017, it was announced that archaeologists in Turkey's eastern [[Van Province]] had discovered the ruins of a 3,000-year-old Urartu castle during underwater excavations around Lake Van led by [[Van Y\u00fcz\u00fcnc\u00fc Y\u0131l University]] and the Governorship of Turkey's eastern [[Bitlis Province]], and that revealed these underwater ruins are from the [[Iron Age]] Urartu civilization and are thought to date back to the eighth to seventh centuries BC.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Underwater ruins of 3,000-year-old castle discovered in Turkey |url=https://www.dailysabah.com/history/2017/11/12/underwater-ruins-of-3000-year-old-castle-discovered-in-turkey |work=[[Daily Sabah]] |location=[[Turkey]] |date=12 November 2017|access-date=21 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe discovery of Urartu has also come to play a significant role in 19th to 21st-century [[Armenian nationalism]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Redgate|first=Anne Elizabeth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e3nef10a3UcC|title=The Armenians|publisher=Wiley|year=2000|isbn=978-0-631-22037-4|ref=harv|authorlink=Elizabeth Redgate}}, p. 276.</ref>\n\n==Economy and politics==\n{{main|Economy of Urartu}}\n\nThe economic structure of Urartu was similar to other states of the ancient world, especially Assyria. The state was heavily dependent on [[agriculture]], which required centralized [[irrigation]]. These works were managed by kings, but implemented by free inhabitants and possibly slave labour provided by prisoners. Royal governors, influential people and, perhaps, free peoples had their own allotments. Individual territories within the state had to pay taxes the central government: grain, horses, bulls, etc. In peacetime, Urartu probably led an active trade with Assyria, providing cattle, horses, iron and [[wine]].\n{|class=\"graytable\"\n |+ '''Agriculture in Urartu'''\n |align=\"center\" width=\"20%\"|[[File:Urartu Fork.jpg|center|122px]]\n|width=\"2%\"|&nbsp;\n |align=\"center\" width=\"20%\"|[[File:Urartu Spades.jpg|center|122px]]\n|width=\"2%\"|&nbsp;\n |align=\"center\"|[[File:Urartian grain bruiser01.jpg|center|330px]]\n |-\n |colspan=4 align=\"center\"|'''Part of iron pitchfork''', found near [[Lake Van]]  and '''Iron plowshare''', found during excavations in [[Rusahinili]] (Toprakkale).\n|align=\"center\"|Urartian saddle [[quern-stone|quern]]\n|}\n\nAccording to archaeological data, farming on the territory of Urartu developed from the [[Neolithic]], even in the 3rd millennium BC. In the Urartian age, agriculture was well developed and closely related to Assyrian methods on the selection of cultures and methods of processing.<ref>Piotrovskii, Boris, B.

Many regions of the Urartu state required artificial irrigation, which has successfully been organized by the rulers of Urartu in the heyday of the state. In several regions remain ancient irrigation canals, constructed by Urartu, mainly during the Argishti I and Menua period, some of which are still used for irrigation.\n\n==Art and architecture==\n{{main|Art of Urartu}}\n[[File:Tushpuea01.jpg|thumb|Bronze figurine of the winged goddess [[Tushpuea]], with suspension hook]]\n\nThere is a number of remains of sturdy stone architecture, as well as some [[mud brick]], especially when it has been burnt, which helps survival.  Stone remains are mainly fortresses and walls, with temples and mausolea, and many [[rock-cut architecture|rock-cut]] tombs. The style, which developed regional variations, shows a distinct character, partly because of the greater use of stone compared to neighbouring cultures. The typical temple was square, with stones walls as thick as the open internal area but using mud brick for the higher part. These were placed at the highest point of a citadel and from surviving depictions were high, perhaps with [[gable]]d roofs; their emphasis on verticality has been claimed as an influence of later Christian [[Armenian architecture]].<ref name=\"online, subscription required\">C.

There are also remains of ivory and bone carvings, [[fresco]]s, [[cylinder seal]]s and of course pottery.

Although many Urartian kings made conquests in the North, such as the Lake Sevan region, many of those peoples' gods remain excluded. This was most likely the case because Urartians considered the people in the north to be barbaric, and disliked their deities as much as they did them. Good examples of incorporated deities however are the goddesses [[Bagvarti]] (Bagmashtu) and [[Selardi]], both potentially of Armenian origins. On Mheri-Dur (Meher-Tur) (the \"Gate of Mehr\"), overlooking modern Van, an inscription lists a total of 79 deities, and what type of sacrificial offerings should be made to each; goats, sheep, cattle, and other animals served as the sacrificial offerings. Urartians did not practice human sacrifice.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Kingdom of Armenia|last=Chahin |first=Mark|year=1987 |publisher=Dorset Press|isbn=978-0-88029-609-0}}</ref>\n\nThe pantheon was headed by a triad made up of \u1e2aaldi (the supreme god), Theispas (Teisheba, god of thunder and storms, as well as sometimes war), and Shivini (a solar god). Their king was also the chief-priest or envoy of \u1e2aaldi. Some temples to \u1e2aaldi were part of the royal palace complex, while others were independent structures.\n\n\u1e2aaldi was not a native Urartian god but apparently an obscure [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] deity (which explains the location of the main temple of worship for \u1e2aaldi in [[Musasir]], believed to be near modern [[Rawandiz|Rawandiz, Iraq]]).<ref name=Zimansky2012>{{cite book |author=Zimansky, Paul |title=Imagining Haldi |year=2012 |page=714 |url=https://www.academia.edu/9973747}}</ref> \u1e2aaldi was not initially worshipped by Urartians, at least as their chief god, as his cult does not appear to have been introduced until the reign of [[Ishpuini of Urartu|Ishpuini]].<ref name=Zimansky2012/>\n\nTheispas was a version of the Hurrian god, [[Teshub]].<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Teshub] (''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'')</ref>\n\nAccording to Diakonoff and [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]], Shivini (likely pronounced ''Shiwini'' or ''Siwini'') was likely borrowed from the Hittites.\n\n== Population ==\nUrartologist Paul Zimansky speculated that the Urartians (or at least the ruling family) may have emigrated northwest into the Lake Van region from their religious capital [[Musasir|Musasir (Ardini)]].<ref name=\"Urartian_and_the_Urartians Zimansky pp. 557\"/> According to Zimansky, the Urartian ruling class were few in number and governed over an ethnically, culturally, and linguistically diverse population.

Although, the bulk of the cuneiform inscriptions within Urartu were written in the Urartian language, a minority of them were also written in Akkadian (the official language of Assyria).\n\nThere are also claims of autochthonous [[Urartian language#Hieroglyphs|Urartian hieroglyphs]], but this remains uncertain.<ref>[[Archibald Sayce|Sayce, Archibald H]]. \"The Kingdom of Van (Urartu)\" in ''Cambridge Ancient History''.

Diakonoff, [[Giorgi Melikishvili]], Mikhail Nikolsky, and Ivan Mestchaninov, suggests that Urartian was solely the formal written language of the state, while its inhabitants, including the royal family, spoke Proto-Armenian. This theory primarily hinges on the fact that the Urartian language used in the cuneiform inscriptions were very repetitive and scant in vocabulary (having as little as 350\u2013400 roots). Furthermore, over 250 years of usage, it shows no development, which is taken to indicate that the language had ceased to be spoken before the time of the inscriptions or was used only for official purposes.{{better source|date=November 2018}}\n\nA complementary theory, suggested by Tamaz V.

Uruartri itself was in the region around [[Lake Van]]. The Nairi states were repeatedly subjected to further attacks and invasions by the [[Middle Assyrian Empire|Middle]] and [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]]s, which lay to the south in [[Upper Mesopotamia]] (\"the Jazirah\") and northern [[Syria (region)|Syria]], especially under [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] (c. 1240&nbsp;BCE), [[Tiglath-Pileser I]] (c. 1100&nbsp;BCE), [[Ashur-bel-kala]] (c. 1070&nbsp;BCE), [[Adad-nirari II]] (c. 900 BCE), [[Tukulti-Ninurta II]] (c. 890 BCE), and [[Ashurnasirpal II]] (883\u2013859&nbsp;BC).\n\nUrartu reemerged in Assyrian language inscriptions in the ninth century BCE as a powerful northern rival to the Neo-Assyrian Empire. The Nairi states and tribes became unified kingdom under King [[Arame of Urartu]] (c. 860\u2013843&nbsp;BCE), whose capitals, first at Sugunia and then at [[Arzashkun]], were captured by the Assyrians under the Neo-Assyrian emperor [[Shalmaneser III]]. \n\nUrartologist Paul Zimansky speculated that the Urartians, or at least their ruling family after Arame, may have emigrated northwest into the Lake Van region from their religious capital of [[Musasir]].<ref name=\"Urartian_and_the_Urartians Zimansky pp. 557\">[https://www.academia.edu/10023756/Urartian_and_the_Urartians Zimansky, Paul ''Urartu and the Urartians'', pp. 557]</ref> According to Zimansky, the Urartian ruling class were few in number and governed over an ethnically, culturally, and linguistically diverse population.

His son, Ispuini (c. 820\u2013800&nbsp;BCE) annexed the neighbouring state of Musasir, which became an important religious center of the Urartian Kingdom, and introduced the cult of [[\u1e2aaldi]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIspuini was also the first Urartian king to write in the Urartian language (previous kings left records written in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> He made his son [[Sarduri II]] viceroy. After conquering Musasir, Ispuini was in turn attacked by [[Shamshi-Adad V]]. His co-regent and subsequent successor, [[Menua]] (c. 800\u2013785&nbsp;BCE) also enlarged the kingdom greatly and left inscriptions over a wide area. During Ispuini's and Menua's joint rule, they shifted from referring to their territory as Nairi, instead opting for ''Bianili''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nUrartu reached the highest point of its military might under Menua's son [[Argishti I of Urartu|Argishti I]] (c. 785\u2013760&nbsp;BCE), becoming one of the most powerful kingdoms of ancient Near East. Argishti I added more territories along the [[Aras (river)|Aras]] and [[Lake Sevan]], and frustrated [[Shalmaneser IV]]'s campaigns against him. Argishti also founded several new cities, most notably Erebuni Fortress in 782&nbsp;BCE. 6600 captured slaves worked on the construction of the new city.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n[[File:Niche and base for a destroyed Urartian statue.

F. B. Lynch|Lynch, H.F.B.]] ''Armenia, Travels and Studies, Volume 2''. London: Longmans, 1901, p. 54.</ref> Schulz discovered and copied numerous [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] inscriptions, partly in Assyrian and partly in a hitherto unknown language. Schulz also discovered the ''[[Kelishin stele]]'', bearing an Assyrian-Urartian bilingual inscription, located on the [[Kelishin]] pass on the current Iraqi-Iranian border. A summary account of his initial discoveries was published in 1828. Schulz and four of his servants were murdered by [[Kurdish people|Kurd]]s in 1829 near {{lang|tr|Ba\u015fkale}}. His notes were later recovered and published in Paris in 1840. In 1828, the British Assyriologist [[Henry Creswicke Rawlinson]] had attempted to copy the inscription on the Kelishin stele, but failed because of the ice on the stele's front side. The German scholar R. Rosch made a similar attempt a few years later, but he and his party were attacked and killed.\n\nIn the late 1840s Sir [[Austen Henry Layard]] examined and described the Urartian rock-cut tombs of [[Van Castle]], including the [[Argishtis I of Urartu|Argishti]] chamber. From the 1870s, local residents began to plunder the Toprakkale ruins, selling its artefacts to European collections. In the 1880s this site underwent a poorly executed excavation organised by [[Hormuzd Rassam]] on behalf of the [[British Museum]]. Almost nothing was properly documented.\n\nThe first systematic collection of Urartian inscriptions, and thus the beginning of Urartology as a specialized field dates to the 1870s, with the campaign of Sir [[Archibald Henry Sayce]]. The German engineer Karl Sester, discoverer of [[Mount Nemrut]], collected more inscriptions in 1890/1.\n[[Waldemar Belck]] visited the area in 1891, discovering the Rusa stele. A further expedition planned for 1893 was prevented by Turkish-Armenian hostilities. Belck together with Lehmann-Haupt visited the area again in 1898/9, excavating Toprakkale. On this expedition, Belck reached the Kelishin stele, but he was attacked by Kurds and barely escaped with his life. Belck and Lehmann-Haupt reached the stele again in a second attempt, but were again prevented from copying the inscription by weather conditions. After another assault on Belck provoked the diplomatic intervention of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] agreed to pay Belck a sum of 80,000 gold marks in reparation. During [[World War I]], the Lake Van region briefly fell under Russian control. In 1916, the Russian scholars [[Nikolay Yakovlevich Marr]] and [[Iosif Abgarovich Orbeli]], excavating at the Van fortress, uncovered a four-faced stele carrying the annals of Sarduri II. In 1939 [[Boris Borisovich Piotrovsky]] excavated [[Karmir-Blur]], discovering [[Teishebai|Tei\u0161ebai]], the city of the god of war, [[Theispas|Tei\u0161eba]]. Excavations by the American scholars [[Kirsopp Lake|Kirsopp]] and Silva Lake during 1938-40 were cut short by [[World War II]], and most of their finds and field records were lost when a German submarine torpedoed their ship, the {{SS|Athenia|1922|6}}. Their surviving documents were published by [[Manfred Korfmann]] in 1977.\n\nA new phase of excavations began after the war. Excavations were at first restricted to [[Soviet Armenia]]. The fortress of Karmir Blur, dating from the reign of Rusa II, was excavated by a team headed by Boris Piotrovsky, and for the first time the excavators of a Urartian site published their findings systematically. Beginning in 1956 [[Charles A. Burney]] identified and sketch-surveyed many Urartian sites in the Lake Van area and, from 1959, a Turkish expedition under [[Tahsin \u00d6zg\u00fc\u00e7]] excavated Altintepe and Arif Erzen.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Urartian sites in northwest Iran were excavated. In 1976, an Italian team led by Mirjo Salvini finally reached the Kelishin stele, accompanied by a heavy military escort. The [[Gulf War]] then closed these sites to archaeological research. Oktay Belli resumed excavation of Urartian sites on Turkish territory: in 1989 Ayanis, a 7th-century BC fortress built by [[Rusas II of Urartu]], was discovered 35&nbsp;km north of Van. In spite of excavations, only a third to a half of the 300 known Urartian sites in Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Armenia have been examined by archaeologists (Wartke 1993). Without protection, many sites have been plundered by local residents searching for treasure and other saleable antiquities.\n\nOn 12 November 2017, it was announced that archaeologists in Turkey's eastern [[Van Province]] had discovered the ruins of a 3,000-year-old Urartu castle during underwater excavations around Lake Van led by [[Van Y\u00fcz\u00fcnc\u00fc Y\u0131l University]] and the Governorship of Turkey's eastern [[Bitlis Province]], and that revealed these underwater ruins are from the [[Iron Age]] Urartu civilization and are thought to date back to the eighth to seventh centuries BC.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Underwater ruins of 3,000-year-old castle discovered in Turkey |url=https://www.dailysabah.com/history/2017/11/12/underwater-ruins-of-3000-year-old-castle-discovered-in-turkey |work=[[Daily Sabah]] |location=[[Turkey]] |date=12 November 2017|access-date=21 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe discovery of Urartu has also come to play a significant role in 19th to 21st-century [[Armenian nationalism]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Redgate|first=Anne Elizabeth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e3nef10a3UcC|title=The Armenians|publisher=Wiley|year=2000|isbn=978-0-631-22037-4|ref=harv|authorlink=Elizabeth Redgate}}, p. 276.</ref>\n\n==Economy and politics==\n{{main|Economy of Urartu}}\n\nThe economic structure of Urartu was similar to other states of the ancient world, especially Assyria. The state was heavily dependent on [[agriculture]], which required centralized [[irrigation]]. These works were managed by kings, but implemented by free inhabitants and possibly slave labour provided by prisoners. Royal governors, influential people and, perhaps, free peoples had their own allotments. Individual territories within the state had to pay taxes the central government: grain, horses, bulls, etc. In peacetime, Urartu probably led an active trade with Assyria, providing cattle, horses, iron and [[wine]].\n{|class=\"graytable\"\n |+ '''Agriculture in Urartu'''\n |align=\"center\" width=\"20%\"|[[File:Urartu Fork.jpg|center|122px]]\n|width=\"2%\"|&nbsp;\n |align=\"center\" width=\"20%\"|[[File:Urartu Spades.jpg|center|122px]]\n|width=\"2%\"|&nbsp;\n |align=\"center\"|[[File:Urartian grain bruiser01.jpg|center|330px]]\n |-\n |colspan=4 align=\"center\"|'''Part of iron pitchfork''', found near [[Lake Van]]  and '''Iron plowshare''', found during excavations in [[Rusahinili]] (Toprakkale).\n|align=\"center\"|Urartian saddle [[quern-stone|quern]]\n|}\n\nAccording to archaeological data, farming on the territory of Urartu developed from the [[Neolithic]], even in the 3rd millennium BC. In the Urartian age, agriculture was well developed and closely related to Assyrian methods on the selection of cultures and methods of processing.<ref>Piotrovskii, Boris, B.

Many regions of the Urartu state required artificial irrigation, which has successfully been organized by the rulers of Urartu in the heyday of the state. In several regions remain ancient irrigation canals, constructed by Urartu, mainly during the Argishti I and Menua period, some of which are still used for irrigation.\n\n==Art and architecture==\n{{main|Art of Urartu}}\n[[File:Tushpuea01.jpg|thumb|Bronze figurine of the winged goddess [[Tushpuea]], with suspension hook]]\n\nThere is a number of remains of sturdy stone architecture, as well as some [[mud brick]], especially when it has been burnt, which helps survival.  Stone remains are mainly fortresses and walls, with temples and mausolea, and many [[rock-cut architecture|rock-cut]] tombs. The style, which developed regional variations, shows a distinct character, partly because of the greater use of stone compared to neighbouring cultures. The typical temple was square, with stones walls as thick as the open internal area but using mud brick for the higher part. These were placed at the highest point of a citadel and from surviving depictions were high, perhaps with [[gable]]d roofs; their emphasis on verticality has been claimed as an influence of later Christian [[Armenian architecture]].<ref name=\"online, subscription required\">C.

Although many Urartian kings made conquests in the North, such as the Lake Sevan region, many of those peoples' gods remain excluded. This was most likely the case because Urartians considered the people in the north to be barbaric, and disliked their deities as much as they did them. Good examples of incorporated deities however are the goddesses [[Bagvarti]] (Bagmashtu) and [[Selardi]], both potentially of Armenian origins. On Mheri-Dur (Meher-Tur) (the \"Gate of Mehr\"), overlooking modern Van, an inscription lists a total of 79 deities, and what type of sacrificial offerings should be made to each; goats, sheep, cattle, and other animals served as the sacrificial offerings. Urartians did not practice human sacrifice.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Kingdom of Armenia|last=Chahin |first=Mark|year=1987 |publisher=Dorset Press|isbn=978-0-88029-609-0}}</ref>\n\nThe pantheon was headed by a triad made up of \u1e2aaldi (the supreme god), Theispas (Teisheba, god of thunder and storms, as well as sometimes war), and Shivini (a solar god). Their king was also the chief-priest or envoy of \u1e2aaldi. Some temples to \u1e2aaldi were part of the royal palace complex, while others were independent structures.\n\n\u1e2aaldi was not a native Urartian god but apparently an obscure [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] deity (which explains the location of the main temple of worship for \u1e2aaldi in [[Musasir]], believed to be near modern [[Rawandiz|Rawandiz, Iraq]]).<ref name=Zimansky2012>{{cite book |author=Zimansky, Paul |title=Imagining Haldi |year=2012 |page=714 |url=https://www.academia.edu/9973747}}</ref> \u1e2aaldi was not initially worshipped by Urartians, at least as their chief god, as his cult does not appear to have been introduced until the reign of [[Ishpuini of Urartu|Ishpuini]].<ref name=Zimansky2012/>\n\nTheispas was a version of the Hurrian god, [[Teshub]].<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Teshub] (''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'')</ref>\n\nAccording to Diakonoff and [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]], Shivini (likely pronounced ''Shiwini'' or ''Siwini'') was likely borrowed from the Hittites.\n\n== Population ==\nUrartologist Paul Zimansky speculated that the Urartians (or at least the ruling family) may have emigrated northwest into the Lake Van region from their religious capital [[Musasir|Musasir (Ardini)]].<ref name=\"Urartian_and_the_Urartians Zimansky pp. 557\"/> According to Zimansky, the Urartian ruling class were few in number and governed over an ethnically, culturally, and linguistically diverse population.

An opinion survey was conducted by the firm GfK Knowledge Networks to differentiate between the different attitudes towards gun control. There was a gun policy survey and a mental illness survey. Studies showed that over 85% of those questioned supported national background checks into the mental health records of citizens attempting to purchase a gun. More than 50% of people felt that those with mental health issues were more deviant and threatening than those who had good mental health.

An opinion survey was conducted by the firm GfK Knowledge Networks to differentiate between the different attitudes towards gun control. There was a gun policy survey and a mental illness survey. Studies showed that over 85% of those questioned supported national background checks into the mental health records of citizens attempting to purchase a gun. More than 50% of people felt that those with mental health issues were more deviant and threatening than those who had good mental health. The study also found that there is large interest in contributing to mental health awareness as well as simply prohibiting those with mental illness from purchasing guns. Nearly two thirds of respondents supported greater government spending on mental health, with more than 60% of people believing this would reduce gun violence in the USA. (Colleen L.
