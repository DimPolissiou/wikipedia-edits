By the year 1734, Kolis of Gujarat were well engaged in piracy. They were well known for their infamous activities at sea. The [[Royal Indian Navy|British Navy]] under Radford Nunn attacked Koli pirates and burnt nineteen armed vessels and fifty smalls of Koli pirates after six months, and ten more vessels were fired by British. Nevertheless, Koli pirates were notorious and a challenge for maritime powers. On the 21st January 1739, Koli pirates with some [[Siddi]]s of [[Murud-Janjira|Janjira]] captured several British vessels, among one of which was the '<nowiki/>''Tiger Gallivat''<nowiki/>'. After a few years in 1749, Koli pirates captured the '''Bengal Ship''<nowiki/>', carrying sixty thousand pounds cash and [[cargo]] worth of equal amount. It was a big shock for the British government, and after that the ''British Navy'' and ''[[Dutch India|Dutch Navy]]'' joined hand together to fight against Koli pirates. In 1750, there was a battle at ''Kurla River'' which resulted in defeat for the Kolis and the capture of 23 armed vessels. After this fight, Koli piracy was silenced for long time. It seems that ''Koli Piracy'' was a headache for all naval powers of India.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Saletore|first=Rajaram Narayan|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=1PVMMoChwY4C&dq=Koli+Pirate&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Indian Pirates|date=1978|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|language=en}}</ref>\n\nPrincely states of [[Junagadh State|Junagadh]] and [[Bhavnagar State|Bhavnagar]] also suffered Koli piracy.

It was a big turning point in the history of kolis because after this Rebellion, kolis were highly reputed in the [[Maratha Navy]], [[Maratha Army]] and [[Maratha Empire]]. This Rebellion was a good and big chance for [[Maratha emperors|Maratha Emporer]] the [[Shivaji]] to shake the aurangzeb. In 1650, kolis revolted under their koli chief ''Khemi Sarnaik'' with the supportive words of shivaji maharaj. firstly Sarnaik assembled the other koli [[Nayak (title)|Naiks]] to end the mughal rule and promised them to end the rule in only first rebellion. In the starting of revolt, kolis under Sarnaik shaked the sultan Aurangzeb but latter they were hunted by lacks of mughal soldiers. Sarnaik sought the help from shivaji maharaj but kolis were not helped by maratha emporer. The ''Khemi Sarnaik'' was killed by mughal commander thereafter the family members also were killed by the order of aurangzeb and then the kolis of same clan as Sarnaik were searched and killed. The end of koli rebellion was very haunted, thousands of the kolis were captured and taken to [[Junnar]] to the mughal [[Faujdar]] where their heads were cutoff at a one place. But latter sultan Aurangzeb erected an monument at the heads of kolis named ''<nowiki/>'Koli Chabutra''' and Jiziya tax was stopped. After this, kolis were received high positions in maratha empire such as ''Kanhoji Angre'' who was admiral of maratha navy, ''Tanaji Malusare'', a commander in maratha army and ''Suryaji Malusare, Kondaji Ramji Shelar and Lai Patil'' were notable personalities from martha army and navy.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nin the later part of [[18th century]], the ''Khant Kolis'' rebelled against [[Muslims|Muslim]] rule in [[Junagadh State]] whose ruler was faujdar of mughals. The kolis of [[Junagadh]] revolted under a khant koli named ''Mansa Khant'' who shaked the junagadh government and muslim ruler. The [[Nawab]] of junagadh was unable to prevent the khant kolis. Mansa khant captured the [[Uparkot Fort]] from nawab. After this occurance, nawab sought the help from [[Rajput]] ruler of [[Gondal State]] and the British government to put down the kolis thereafter combined forces of the british, junagadh and gondal attacked the uparkot fort and burnt the koli rebellion.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" />\n\nThe kolis continued to their fight, a similar rebellion also mentioned in the pages of history of maharashtra. In 1761, kolis of [[Sahyadri]] revolted against [[Nizam of Hyderabad]]. A storming party of kolis under their chiefs ''Gamaji Bhangre and Kheroji Pattikar'' captured the [[Trimbak|Trimbak Fort]] from [[Hyderabad State]] and annexed the fort in maratha Empire. It shows the contributions of kolis in the standing of maratha empire thereafter both of the koli chiefs were rewarded with the grants of a large sum of money and many villages with the titles of [[Deshmukh]] and [[Patil (title)|Patil]] by [[Peshwa]].<ref name=\":11\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=The Executive Editor And Secretary|first=Gazetteers Department|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.7537|title=Maharastra State Gazetteers Ahmednagar District|date=1976}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/Ahmadnagar/people_castes.html|title=Maharashtra government|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of [[19th century]] in 1803, there was a koli rebellion against [[East India Company]] in [[Kheda district]]. The british officials declared the dharala kolis most turbulent and predatory tribe of india. They kolis of kheda didn't obey the rules of British government and plundered the villages and towns in British territory and claimed a costmary right to plunder the villages like their forfathers. The district magistrate informed the officials that plundering right in not new to kolis it is a traditional way of collecting the tax from villages from ancient time of kolis. In 1808, koli chiefs such as ''Koli Thakors and Koli Patels'' started the invading the villages and stealing the crops and other possessions mostly in the [[Dholka Taluka]] and neighboring villages of british Territory with the groups of the hundreds of the armed kolis without any difficulties. On February 1808, one of the koli named ''Bachur Khokani'' was captured and imprisoned but on 20 February, fifty kolis attacked the jail and released the rebel Khokani by killing the police officers in the battle. Thereafter, british official ''R. Holford'' made a plane to raised a army of non-koli locals for [[East India Company|EIC]] to prevent the koli rebels. In 1810, a large number of koli rebels were captured and convicted to the crim against company. The kolis were taken to the [[Prince of Wales Islands]] ([[Penang]]) in the recommendation of judge ''H. W. Riggle'' of british cutchery but some rebels were imprisoned in local jails. A group of koli rebels numbering five hundred under ''Koli Bachur Khokani'' attacked the jails and released the rebels it was most daring event in the [[History of Gujarat]]. Again kolis ravaged the dholka and british stationed the more army but no control on kolis. The company sought the help from [[Baroda State]] of [[Gaekwad dynasty|Gaekwads]] but not able to prevent the rebels so company forced the non-koli local chiefs but there was no goid result. In 1824, the [[Ahmedabad]] magistrate ''A. Crawford'' suggested the company to take the possessions of koli chiefs ([[Thakur (title)|Thakors]]) because of involving or supporting the/in koli rebellion. But nobody of the koli chiefs were feared thereafter company used the military against koli chieftains and burnt down their villages and this strategy became more useful for company. The idea of destroying the villages of ''A. Crawford'' didn't prevent the kolis from challenging the company rule but kolis became more turbulent and continued to the rebellion. In 1830, ''Crawford'' made policies for kolis but koli chieftains not seems to be improved but always ready to plunder but in 1840 kolis involved in agriculture.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nAfter the muslim rule, kolis ravaged the [[British Raj]] in [[British India]]. Here is a historical rebellion of kolis which was led by a koli [[Bhagat]] named [[Govindas Ramdas]] who was a worshiper of lord [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]]. He led his followers (most of them were kolis) against british government. He declared the end of british rule in india and declined to obey the orders. On 17 march 1826, Bhagat marched to the [[Thasra]] near [[Dakor]]e with armed kolis. There were no difficulties for rebels and ''Govindas Ramdas'' proclaimed himself as ruler (''Koli Thakor)'' of Thasra. <ref name=\":17\">{{Cite book|last=Chaturvedi|first=Vinayak|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MzPlZSOjCpsC&pg=PA90&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Peasant Pasts: History and Memory in Western India|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25076-5|language=en}}</ref> he led the kolis 1826 to 1830 as a ruler.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDuring the ''Great [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]],'' the kolis of [[Nashik district]] in [[Maharashtra]] rebelled in the ''Petty Princely State Of [[Peint]]'' also spelled ''Penth and Peth .'' peint was a [[Jagir]]'' '' of twenty four vilages and ruled by koli king ''Bhagvant Rao'' also knowns as ''Bhargav Rav .''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Deshpande|first=Arvind M.|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=79sS_w_bOQYC&pg=PA154&lpg=PA154&dq=Koli+Raja+Peint&source=bl&ots=Vf7J9ivfZy&sig=ACfU3U3qQfAfE5epilPBBXeDIE0DOCmSvQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwit3crjnt_oAhU9H7cAHd_1AcYQ6AEwDnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Koli%20Raja%20Peint&f=false|title=John Briggs in Maharashtra: A Study of District Administration Under Early British Rule|date=1987|publisher=Mittal Publications|language=en}}</ref> the rebellion was raised by it's koli chief, queen and her [[Dewan|Diwan]]'' '' in the lead of ''Bhagojee Naik and Bhow Patel Malekar'' (both koli) to collapse the british rule.

Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times. In spite of such close blood-ties, there would be occasional rifts between the two royal families, which sometimes turned into open hostility.\n\n=== Early ===\nRecords of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and [[dacoit]]s.

Until tye 1940, kolis were considered as criminal stocks and mostly used for police and military by rulers and authorities.

By the year 1734, Kolis of Gujarat were well engaged in piracy. They were well known for their infamous activities at sea. The [[Royal Indian Navy|British Navy]] under Radford Nunn attacked Koli pirates and burnt nineteen armed vessels and fifty smalls of Koli pirates after six months, and ten more vessels were fired by British. Nevertheless, Koli pirates were notorious and a challenge for maritime powers. On the 21st January 1739, Koli pirates with some [[Siddi]]s of [[Murud-Janjira|Janjira]] captured several British vessels, among one of which was the '<nowiki/>''Tiger Gallivat''<nowiki/>'. After a few years in 1749, Koli pirates captured the '''Bengal Ship''<nowiki/>', carrying sixty thousand pounds cash and [[cargo]] worth of equal amount. It was a big shock for the British government, and after that the ''British Navy'' and ''[[Dutch India|Dutch Navy]]'' joined hand together to fight against Koli pirates. In 1750, there was a battle at ''Kurla River'' which resulted in defeat for the Kolis and the capture of 23 armed vessels. After this fight, Koli piracy was silenced for long time.

In 1650, kolis revolted against sultan [[Aurangzeb]] because of [[Jizya]] taxes on [[Zamindar]]s. It was a big turning point in the history of kolis because after this Rebellion, kolis were highly reputed in the [[Maratha Navy]], [[Maratha Army]] and [[Maratha Empire]]. This Rebellion was a good and big chance for [[Maratha emperors|Maratha Emporer]] the [[Shivaji]] to shake the aurangzeb. In 1650, kolis revolted under their koli chief ''Khemi Sarnaik'' with the supportive words of shivaji maharaj. firstly Sarnaik assembled the other koli [[Nayak (title)|Naiks]] to end the mughal rule and promised them to end the rule in only first rebellion. In the starting of revolt, kolis under Sarnaik shaked the sultan Aurangzeb but latter they were hunted by lacks of mughal soldiers. Sarnaik sought the help from shivaji maharaj but kolis were not helped by maratha emporer. The ''Khemi Sarnaik'' was killed by mughal commander thereafter the family members also were killed by the order of aurangzeb and then the kolis of same clan as Sarnaik were searched and killed. The end of koli rebellion was very haunted, thousands of the kolis were captured and taken to [[Junnar]] to the mughal [[Faujdar]] where their heads were cutoff at a one place. But latter sultan Aurangzeb erected an monument at the heads of kolis named ''<nowiki/>'Koli Chabutra''' and Jiziya tax was stopped. After this, kolis were received high positions in maratha empire such as ''Kanhoji Angre'' who was admiral of maratha navy, ''Tanaji Malusare'', a commander in maratha army and ''Suryaji Malusare, Kondaji Ramji Shelar and Lai Patil'' were notable personalities from martha army and navy.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nin the later part of [[18th century]], the ''Khant Kolis'' rebelled against [[Muslims|Muslim]] rule in [[Junagadh State]] whose ruler was faujdar of mughals. The kolis of [[Junagadh]] revolted under a khant koli named ''Mansa Khant'' who shaked the junagadh government and muslim ruler. The [[Nawab]] of junagadh was unable to prevent the khant kolis. Mansa khant captured the [[Uparkot Fort]] from nawab. After this occurance, nawab sought the help from [[Rajput]] ruler of [[Gondal State]] and the British government to put down the kolis thereafter combined forces of the british, junagadh and gondal attacked the uparkot fort and burnt the koli rebellion.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" />\n\nThe kolis continued to their fight, a similar rebellion also mentioned in the pages of history of maharashtra. In 1761, kolis of [[Sahyadri]] revolted against [[Nizam of Hyderabad]]. A storming party of kolis under their chiefs ''Gamaji Bhangre and Kheroji Pattikar'' captured the [[Trimbak|Trimbak Fort]] from [[Hyderabad State]] and annexed the fort in maratha Empire. It shows the contributions of kolis in the standing of maratha empire thereafter both of the koli chiefs were rewarded with the grants of a large sum of money and many villages with the titles of [[Deshmukh]] and [[Patil (title)|Patil]] by [[Peshwa]].<ref name=\":11\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=The Executive Editor And Secretary|first=Gazetteers Department|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.7537|title=Maharastra State Gazetteers Ahmednagar District|date=1976}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/Ahmadnagar/people_castes.html|title=Maharashtra government|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of [[19th century]] in 1803, there was a koli rebellion against [[East India Company]] in [[Kheda district]]. The british officials declared the dharala kolis most turbulent and predatory tribe of india. They kolis of kheda didn't obey the rules of British government and plundered the villages and towns in British territory and claimed a costmary right to plunder the villages like their forfathers. The district magistrate informed the officials that plundering right in not new to kolis it is a traditional way of collecting the tax from villages from ancient time of kolis. In 1808, koli chiefs such as ''Koli Thakors and Koli Patels'' started the invading the villages and stealing the crops and other possessions mostly in the [[Dholka Taluka]] and neighboring villages of british Territory with the groups of the hundreds of the armed kolis without any difficulties. On February 1808, one of the koli named ''Bachur Khokani'' was captured and imprisoned but on 20 February, fifty kolis attacked the jail and released the rebel Khokani by killing the police officers in the battle. Thereafter, british official ''R. Holford'' made a plane to raised a army of non-koli locals for [[East India Company|EIC]] to prevent the koli rebels. In 1810, a large number of koli rebels were captured and convicted to the crim against company. The kolis were taken to the [[Prince of Wales Islands]] ([[Penang]]) in the recommendation of judge ''H. W. Riggle'' of british cutchery but some rebels were imprisoned in local jails. A group of koli rebels numbering five hundred under ''Koli Bachur Khokani'' attacked the jails and released the rebels it was most daring event in the [[History of Gujarat]]. Again kolis ravaged the dholka and british stationed the more army but no control on kolis. The company sought the help from [[Baroda State]] of [[Gaekwad dynasty|Gaekwads]] but not able to prevent the rebels so company forced the non-koli local chiefs but there was no goid result. In 1824, the [[Ahmedabad]] magistrate ''A. Crawford'' suggested the company to take the possessions of koli chiefs ([[Thakur (title)|Thakors]]) because of involving or supporting the/in koli rebellion. But nobody of the koli chiefs were feared thereafter company used the military against koli chieftains and burnt down their villages and this strategy became more useful for company. The idea of destroying the villages of ''A. Crawford'' didn't prevent the kolis from challenging the company rule but kolis became more turbulent and continued to the rebellion. In 1830, ''Crawford'' made policies for kolis but koli chieftains not seems to be improved but always ready to plunder but in 1840 kolis involved in agriculture.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nAfter the muslim rule, kolis ravaged the [[British Raj]] in [[British India]]. Here is a historical rebellion of kolis which was led by a koli [[Bhagat]] named [[Govindas Ramdas]] who was a worshiper of lord [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]]. He led his followers (most of them were kolis) against british government. He declared the end of british rule in india and declined to obey the orders. On 17 march 1826, Bhagat marched to the [[Thasra]] near [[Dakor]]e with armed kolis. There were no difficulties for rebels and ''Govindas Ramdas'' proclaimed himself as ruler (''Koli Thakor)'' of Thasra. <ref name=\":17\">{{Cite book|last=Chaturvedi|first=Vinayak|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MzPlZSOjCpsC&pg=PA90&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Peasant Pasts: History and Memory in Western India|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25076-5|language=en}}</ref> he led the kolis 1826 to 1830 as a ruler.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDuring the ''Great [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]],'' the kolis of [[Nashik district]] in [[Maharashtra]] rebelled in the ''Petty Princely State Of [[Peint]]'' also spelled ''Penth and Peth .'' peint was a [[Jagir]]'' '' of twenty four vilages and ruled by koli king ''Bhagvant Rao'' also knowns as ''Bhargav Rav .''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Deshpande|first=Arvind M.|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=79sS_w_bOQYC&pg=PA154&lpg=PA154&dq=Koli+Raja+Peint&source=bl&ots=Vf7J9ivfZy&sig=ACfU3U3qQfAfE5epilPBBXeDIE0DOCmSvQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwit3crjnt_oAhU9H7cAHd_1AcYQ6AEwDnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Koli%20Raja%20Peint&f=false|title=John Briggs in Maharashtra: A Study of District Administration Under Early British Rule|date=1987|publisher=Mittal Publications|language=en}}</ref> the rebellion was raised by it's koli chief, queen and her [[Dewan|Diwan]]'' '' in the lead of ''Bhagojee Naik and Bhow Patel Malekar'' (both koli) to collapse the british rule.

In general, lianas are detrimental to the trees that support them. Growth rates are lower for trees with lianas; they directly damage hosts by mechanical abrasion and strangulation, render hosts more susceptible to ice and wind damage, and increase the probability that the host tree falls. Lianas also make the canopy of trees more accessible to animals which eat leaves.

In general, lianas are detrimental to the trees that support them.

(The term \"necropsy\" is generally reserved for non-human animals; see below). Autopsies are usually performed by a specialized medical doctor called a [[pathology|pathologist]].  In most cases, a [[medical examiner]] or [[coroner]] can determine cause of death and only a small portion of deaths require an autopsy.\n\n==Purposes ==\nAutopsies are performed for either legal or medical purposes. Autopsies can be performed when any of the following information is desired:\n* Determine if death was natural or unnatural\n* Injury source and extent on the corpse\n* Manner of death must be determined\n* Time since death.\n* Establish identity of deceased\n* Retain relevant organs\n* If infant, determine live birth and viability\n\nFor example, a forensic autopsy is carried out when the [[cause of death]] may be a criminal matter, while a clinical or academic autopsy is performed to find the medical cause of death and is used in cases of unknown or uncertain death, or for research purposes. Autopsies can be further classified into cases where external examination suffices, and those where the body is dissected and internal examination is conducted. Permission from [[next of kin]] may be required for internal autopsy in some cases. Once an internal autopsy is complete the body is reconstituted by sewing it back together.\n\n==Etymology of the word 'Autopsy'==\nThe term \"autopsy\" derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u03c8\u03af\u03b1 ''autopsia'', \"to see for oneself\", derived from \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 (''autos'', \"oneself\") and \u1f44\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2 (''opsis'', \"sight, view\").<ref name=\"Rothenberg\">{{cite book|last=Rothenberg|first=Kelly|title=Forensic Science|chapter=The Autopsy Through History|editor=Ayn Embar-seddon, Allan D.

Critics, including pathologist and former ''[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]]'' [[editing|editor]] [[George D. Lundberg]], have charged that the reduction in autopsies is negatively affecting the care delivered in hospitals, because when mistakes result in death, they are often not investigated and lessons therefore remain unlearned.\n\nWhen a person has given permission in advance of their death, autopsies may also be carried out for the purposes of teaching or medical research.\n\nAn autopsy is frequently performed in cases of sudden death, where a doctor is not able to write a death certificate, or when death is believed to result from an [[unnatural death|unnatural cause]]. These examinations are performed under a legal authority ([[Medical examiner|Medical Examiner]] or [[Coroner]] or [[Procurator fiscal|Procurator Fiscal]]) and do not require the consent of relatives of the deceased. The most extreme example is the examination of [[murder]] victims, especially when medical examiners are looking for signs of death or the murder method, such as [[bullet]] wounds and exit points, signs of [[Strangling|strangulation]], or traces of [[poison]].\nSome religions including [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]] usually discourage the performing of autopsies on their adherents.<ref>Elizabeth C Burton, Kim A Collins.

A new body bag is used for each body to ensure that only [[evidence]] from that body is contained within the bag. Evidence sheets are an alternative way to transport the body. An evidence sheet is a [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]] sheet that covers the body when it is moved. If it is believed there may be any significant evidence on the hands, for example, [[gunshot residue]] or skin under the [[Nail (anatomy)|fingernails]], a separate paper sack is put around each hand and taped shut around the wrist.\n\nThere are two parts to the physical examination of the body: the external and internal examination. [[Toxicology]], [[Medical test|biochemical tests]] or [[genetic testing]]/[[molecular autopsy]] often supplement these and frequently assist the [[Pathology|pathologist]] in assigning the cause or causes of death.\n\n=== External examination ===\nAt many institutions the person responsible for handling, cleaning, and moving the body is called a [[diener]], the [[German language|German]] word for ''servant''. In the UK this role is performed by an Anatomical Pathology Technician (APT), who will also assist the pathologist in eviscerating the body and reconstruction after the autopsy. After the body is received, it is first [[Photography|photographed]]. The examiner then notes the kind of clothes and their position on the body before they are removed. Next, any evidence such as residue, flakes of paint or other material is collected from the external surfaces of the body. [[Ultraviolet]] light may also be used to search body surfaces for any evidence not easily visible to the naked eye. Samples of [[hair]], [[Nail (anatomy)|nails]] and the like are taken, and the body may also be [[X-ray|radiographically imaged]]. Once the external evidence is collected, the body is removed from the bag, undressed, and any [[wound]]s present are examined. The body is then cleaned, weighed, and measured in preparation for the internal examination.\n\nA general description of the body as regards [[ethnic group]], [[sex]], age, [[Human hair colour|hair colour]] and length, [[eye colour]] and other distinguishing features ([[birthmark]]s, old [[scar]] [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]], [[Nevus|moles]], [[tattoo]]s, etc.) is then made. A [[Dictation machine|voice recorder]] or a standard examination form is normally used to record this information.\n\nIn some countries {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}, ''e.g.'', Scotland, France, Germany, and Canada, an autopsy may comprise an external examination only. This concept is sometimes termed a \"view and grant\". The principle behind this is that the medical records, history of the deceased and circumstances of death have all indicated as to the cause and manner of death without the need for an internal examination.<ref>{{cite web|last1=St Andrew's House|title=Inspectorate of Prosecution in Scotland - Death Cases: A Thematic Report on Liaison in Death Cases with Particular Reference to Organ Retention|url=http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2007/07/16093109/7|website=Scottish Government|language=English|date=18 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Internal examination ===\nIf not already in place, a plastic or rubber brick called a \"head block\" is placed under the shoulders of the deceased, hyperflexing the neck making the spine arch backward while stretching and pushing the [[Thorax|chest]] upward to make it easier to incise. This gives the APT, or pathologist, maximum exposure to the [[Torso|trunk]]. After this is done, the internal examination begins. The internal examination consists of inspecting the [[Organ (anatomy)|internal organs]] of the body by [[dissection]] for evidence of [[Major trauma|trauma]] or other indications of the cause of death. For the internal examination there are a number of different approaches available:\n\n* a large and deep Y-shaped incision can be made starting at the top of each shoulder and running down the front of the chest, meeting at the lower point of the [[sternum]] (breastbone). \n* a curved incision made from the tips of each shoulder, in a semi-circular line across the chest/decolletage, to approximately the level of the second rib, curving back up to the opposite shoulder. \n* a single vertical incision is made from the sternal notch at the base of the neck. \n*a U-shaped incision is made at the tip of both shoulders, down along the side of the chest to the bottom of the rib cage, following along it. This is typically used on women and during chest-only autopsies.\nThere is no need for any incision to be made, which will be visible after completion of the examination when the deceased is dressed in a shroud.\nIn all of the above cases the incision then extends all the way down to the [[Pubis (bone)|pubic bone]] (making a deviation to either side of the navel) and avoiding, where possible; transecting any scars which may be present.\n\n[[Bleeding]] from the cuts is minimal, or non-existent, because the pull of [[gravity]] is producing the only [[blood pressure]] at this point, related directly to the complete lack of cardiac functionality. However, in certain cases there is anecdotal evidence that bleeding can be quite profuse, especially in cases of [[drowning]].\n\nAt this point, shears are used to open the chest cavity. The prosector uses the tool to cut through the ribs on the costal cartilage, to allow the sternum to be removed; this is done so that the heart and lungs can be seen [[in situ]] and that the heart, in particular the [[Pericardium|pericardial sac]] is not damaged or disturbed from opening. A PM 40 knife is used to remove the sternum from the soft tissue which attaches it to the mediastinum. Now the [[lung]]s and the heart are exposed. The sternum is set aside and will be eventually replaced at the end of the autopsy.\n\nAt this stage the [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] are exposed. Usually, the organs are removed in a systematic fashion.  Making a decision as to what order the organs are to be removed will depend highly on the case in question. Organs can be removed in several ways: The first is the ''[[List of French expressions in English#En masse|en masse]]'' technique of Letulle whereby all the organs are removed as one large mass. The second is the en bloc method of Ghon. The most popular in the UK is a modified version of this method, which is divided into four groups of organs. Although these are the two predominant evisceration techniques, in the UK variations on these are widespread.\n\nOne method is described here: The pericardial sac is opened to view the heart.  Blood for chemical analysis may be removed from the [[inferior vena cava]] or the pulmonary veins.  Before removing the heart, the [[pulmonary artery]] is opened in order to search for a blood clot.  The heart can then be removed by cutting the inferior vena cava, the pulmonary veins, the [[aorta]] and pulmonary artery, and the [[superior vena cava]].  This method leaves the aortic arch intact, which will make things easier for the embalmer.  The left lung is then easily accessible and can be removed by cutting the [[bronchus]], artery, and vein at the [[Root of the lung|hilum]].  The right lung can then be similarly removed.  The abdominal organs can be removed one by one after first examining their relationships and vessels.\n\nMost pathologists, however, prefer the organs to be removed all in one \"block\".  Using dissection of the fascia, blunt dissection; using the fingers or hands and traction; the organs are dissected out in one piece for further inspection and sampling. During autopsies of infants, this method is used almost all of the time. The various organs are examined, weighed and tissue samples in the form of slices are taken. Even major [[blood vessel]]s are cut open and inspected at this stage. Next the [[stomach]] and intestinal contents are examined and weighed. This could be useful to find the cause and time of death, due to the natural passage of food through the bowel during digestion. The more area empty, the longer the deceased had gone without a meal before death.\n\n[[File:Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis, gross pathology 33 lores.jpg|right|175px|thumb|A brain autopsy demonstrating signs of [[meningitis]]. The [[forceps]] (center) are retracting the [[dura mater]] (white).  Underneath the dura mater are the [[Meninges#Leptomeninges|leptomeninges]], which appear to be [[edema]]tous and have multiple small hemorrhagic foci.]]\nThe body block that was used earlier to elevate the chest cavity is now used to elevate the head. To examine the [[brain]], an incision is made from behind one ear, over the crown of the head, to a point behind the other ear. When the autopsy is completed, the incision can be neatly sewn up and is not noticed when the head is resting on a pillow in an open casket [[funeral]]. The [[scalp]] is pulled away from the [[skull]] in two flaps with the front flap going over the face and the rear flap over the back of the neck. The skull is then cut with a circular (or semicircular) bladed reciprocating saw to create a \"cap\" that can be pulled off, exposing the brain. The brain is then observed in situ. Then the brain's connection to the cranial nerves and [[spinal cord]] are severed, and the brain is lifted out of the skull for further examination. If the brain needs to be preserved before being inspected, it is contained in a large container of formalin (15 percent solution of [[formaldehyde]] gas in buffered [[water]]) for at least two, but preferably four weeks. This not only preserves the brain, but also makes it firmer, allowing easier handling without corrupting the tissue.\n\n=== Reconstitution of the body ===\nAn important component of the autopsy is the reconstitution of the body such that it can be viewed, if desired, by relatives of the deceased following the procedure. After the examination, the body has an open and empty [[thoracic cavity]] with chest flaps open on both sides, the top of the skull is missing, and the skull flaps are pulled over the face and neck. It is unusual to examine the face, arms, hands or legs internally.\n\nIn the UK, following the [[Human Tissue Act 2004]] all organs and tissue must be returned to the body unless permission is given by the family to retain any tissue for further investigation. Normally the internal body cavity is lined with cotton, wool, or a similar material, and the organs are then placed into a plastic bag to prevent leakage and are returned to the body cavity. The chest flaps are then closed and sewn back together and the skull cap is sewed back in place. Then the body may be wrapped in a [[shroud]], and it is common for relatives to not be able to tell the procedure has been done when the body is viewed in a [[funeral home|funeral parlor]] after [[embalming]].\n\n== History ==\n{{see also|Dissection#History|l1=History of dissection}}\n[[File:3492769920 f48c41bdc8 bDissection19.jpg|thumb|Dissection, 19th century US.]]\n\nAround 3000 BCE, [[ancient Egypt]]ians were one of the first civilizations to practice the removal and examination of the internal organs of humans in the religious practice of [[Mummy|mummification]].<ref name=\"Rothenberg\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/prehistory/egypt/dailylife/medicine.html|title=Medicine|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309103323/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/prehistory/egypt/dailylife/medicine.html|archivedate=9 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nAutopsies that opened the body to determine the cause of death were attested at least in the early third millennium BC, although they were opposed in many ancient societies where it was believed that the outward disfigurement of dead persons prevented them from entering the [[afterlife]]<ref name=\"Schafer 43\">{{cite book|last=Schafer|first=Elizabeth D.|title=Forensic Science|chapter=Ancient science and forensics|editor=Ayn Embar-seddon, Allan D.

(The term \"necropsy\" is generally reserved for non-human animals; see below). Autopsies are usually performed by a specialized medical doctor called a [[pathology|pathologist]].  In most cases, a [[medical examiner]] or [[coroner]] can determine cause of death and only a small portion of deaths require an autopsy.\n\n==Purposes ==\nAutopsies are performed for either legal or medical purposes. Autopsies can be performed when any of the following information is desired:\n* Determine if death was natural or unnatural\n* Injury source and extent on the corpse\n* Manner of death must be determined\n* Time since death.\n* Establish identity of deceased\n* Retain relevant organs\n* If infant, determine live birth and viability\n\nFor example, a forensic autopsy is carried out when the [[cause of death]] may be a criminal matter, while a clinical or academic autopsy is performed to find the medical cause of death and is used in cases of unknown or uncertain death, or for research purposes. Autopsies can be further classified into cases where external examination suffices, and those where the body is dissected and internal examination is conducted. Permission from [[next of kin]] may be required for internal autopsy in some cases. Once an internal autopsy is complete the body is reconstituted by sewing it back together.\n\n==Etymology of the word 'Autopsy'==\nThe term \"autopsy\" derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u03c8\u03af\u03b1 ''autopsia'', \"to see for oneself\", derived from \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 (''autos'', \"oneself\") and \u1f44\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2 (''opsis'', \"sight, view\").<ref name=\"Rothenberg\">{{cite book|last=Rothenberg|first=Kelly|title=Forensic Science|chapter=The Autopsy Through History|editor=Ayn Embar-seddon, Allan D.

Critics, including pathologist and former ''[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]]'' [[editing|editor]] [[George D. Lundberg]], have charged that the reduction in autopsies is negatively affecting the care delivered in hospitals, because when mistakes result in death, they are often not investigated and lessons therefore remain unlearned.\n\nWhen a person has given permission in advance of their death, autopsies may also be carried out for the purposes of teaching or medical research.\n\nAn autopsy is frequently performed in cases of sudden death, where a doctor is not able to write a death certificate, or when death is believed to result from an [[unnatural death|unnatural cause]]. These examinations are performed under a legal authority ([[Medical examiner|Medical Examiner]] or [[Coroner]] or [[Procurator fiscal|Procurator Fiscal]]) and do not require the consent of relatives of the deceased. The most extreme example is the examination of [[murder]] victims, especially when medical examiners are looking for signs of death or the murder method, such as [[bullet]] wounds and exit points, signs of [[Strangling|strangulation]], or traces of [[poison]].\nSome religions including [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]] usually discourage the performing of autopsies on their adherents.<ref>Elizabeth C Burton, Kim A Collins.

A new body bag is used for each body to ensure that only [[evidence]] from that body is contained within the bag. Evidence sheets are an alternative way to transport the body. An evidence sheet is a [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]] sheet that covers the body when it is moved. If it is believed there may be any significant evidence on the hands, for example, [[gunshot residue]] or skin under the [[Nail (anatomy)|fingernails]], a separate paper sack is put around each hand and taped shut around the wrist.\n\nThere are two parts to the physical examination of the body: the external and internal examination. [[Toxicology]], [[Medical test|biochemical tests]] or [[genetic testing]]/[[molecular autopsy]] often supplement these and frequently assist the [[Pathology|pathologist]] in assigning the cause or causes of death.\n\n=== External examination ===\nAt many institutions the person responsible for handling, cleaning, and moving the body is called a [[diener]], the [[German language|German]] word for ''servant''. In the UK this role is performed by an Anatomical Pathology Technician (APT), who will also assist the pathologist in eviscerating the body and reconstruction after the autopsy. After the body is received, it is first [[Photography|photographed]]. The examiner then notes the kind of clothes and their position on the body before they are removed. Next, any evidence such as residue, flakes of paint or other material is collected from the external surfaces of the body. [[Ultraviolet]] light may also be used to search body surfaces for any evidence not easily visible to the naked eye. Samples of [[hair]], [[Nail (anatomy)|nails]] and the like are taken, and the body may also be [[X-ray|radiographically imaged]]. Once the external evidence is collected, the body is removed from the bag, undressed, and any [[wound]]s present are examined. The body is then cleaned, weighed, and measured in preparation for the internal examination.\n\nA general description of the body as regards [[ethnic group]], [[sex]], age, [[Human hair colour|hair colour]] and length, [[eye colour]] and other distinguishing features ([[birthmark]]s, old [[scar]] [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]], [[Nevus|moles]], [[tattoo]]s, etc.) is then made. A [[Dictation machine|voice recorder]] or a standard examination form is normally used to record this information.\n\nIn some countries {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}, ''e.g.'', Scotland, France, Germany, and Canada, an autopsy may comprise an external examination only. This concept is sometimes termed a \"view and grant\". The principle behind this is that the medical records, history of the deceased and circumstances of death have all indicated as to the cause and manner of death without the need for an internal examination.<ref>{{cite web|last1=St Andrew's House|title=Inspectorate of Prosecution in Scotland - Death Cases: A Thematic Report on Liaison in Death Cases with Particular Reference to Organ Retention|url=http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2007/07/16093109/7|website=Scottish Government|language=English|date=18 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Internal examination ===\nIf not already in place, a plastic or rubber brick called a \"head block\" is placed under the shoulders of the deceased, hyperflexing the neck making the spine arch backward while stretching and pushing the [[Thorax|chest]] upward to make it easier to incise. This gives the APT, or pathologist, maximum exposure to the [[Torso|trunk]]. After this is done, the internal examination begins. The internal examination consists of inspecting the [[Organ (anatomy)|internal organs]] of the body by [[dissection]] for evidence of [[Major trauma|trauma]] or other indications of the cause of death. For the internal examination there are a number of different approaches available:\n\n* a large and deep Y-shaped incision can be made starting at the top of each shoulder and running down the front of the chest, meeting at the lower point of the [[sternum]] (breastbone). \n* a curved incision made from the tips of each shoulder, in a semi-circular line across the chest/decolletage, to approximately the level of the second rib, curving back up to the opposite shoulder. \n* a single vertical incision is made from the sternal notch at the base of the neck. \n*a U-shaped incision is made at the tip of both shoulders, down along the side of the chest to the bottom of the rib cage, following along it. This is typically used on women and during chest-only autopsies.\nThere is no need for any incision to be made, which will be visible after completion of the examination when the deceased is dressed in a shroud.\nIn all of the above cases the incision then extends all the way down to the [[Pubis (bone)|pubic bone]] (making a deviation to either side of the navel) and avoiding, where possible; transecting any scars which may be present.\n\n[[Bleeding]] from the cuts is minimal, or non-existent, because the pull of [[gravity]] is producing the only [[blood pressure]] at this point, related directly to the complete lack of cardiac functionality. However, in certain cases there is anecdotal evidence that bleeding can be quite profuse, especially in cases of [[drowning]].\n\nAt this point, shears are used to open the chest cavity. The prosector uses the tool to cut through the ribs on the costal cartilage, to allow the sternum to be removed; this is done so that the heart and lungs can be seen [[in situ]] and that the heart, in particular the [[Pericardium|pericardial sac]] is not damaged or disturbed from opening. A PM 40 knife is used to remove the sternum from the soft tissue which attaches it to the mediastinum. Now the [[lung]]s and the heart are exposed. The sternum is set aside and will be eventually replaced at the end of the autopsy.\n\nAt this stage the [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] are exposed. Usually, the organs are removed in a systematic fashion.  Making a decision as to what order the organs are to be removed will depend highly on the case in question. Organs can be removed in several ways: The first is the ''[[List of French expressions in English#En masse|en masse]]'' technique of Letulle whereby all the organs are removed as one large mass. The second is the en bloc method of Ghon. The most popular in the UK is a modified version of this method, which is divided into four groups of organs. Although these are the two predominant evisceration techniques, in the UK variations on these are widespread.\n\nOne method is described here: The pericardial sac is opened to view the heart.  Blood for chemical analysis may be removed from the [[inferior vena cava]] or the pulmonary veins.  Before removing the heart, the [[pulmonary artery]] is opened in order to search for a blood clot.  The heart can then be removed by cutting the inferior vena cava, the pulmonary veins, the [[aorta]] and pulmonary artery, and the [[superior vena cava]].  This method leaves the aortic arch intact, which will make things easier for the embalmer.  The left lung is then easily accessible and can be removed by cutting the [[bronchus]], artery, and vein at the [[Root of the lung|hilum]].  The right lung can then be similarly removed.  The abdominal organs can be removed one by one after first examining their relationships and vessels.\n\nMost pathologists, however, prefer the organs to be removed all in one \"block\".  Using dissection of the fascia, blunt dissection; using the fingers or hands and traction; the organs are dissected out in one piece for further inspection and sampling. During autopsies of infants, this method is used almost all of the time. The various organs are examined, weighed and tissue samples in the form of slices are taken. Even major [[blood vessel]]s are cut open and inspected at this stage. Next the [[stomach]] and intestinal contents are examined and weighed. This could be useful to find the cause and time of death, due to the natural passage of food through the bowel during digestion. The more area empty, the longer the deceased had gone without a meal before death.\n\n[[File:Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis, gross pathology 33 lores.jpg|right|175px|thumb|A brain autopsy demonstrating signs of [[meningitis]]. The [[forceps]] (center) are retracting the [[dura mater]] (white).  Underneath the dura mater are the [[Meninges#Leptomeninges|leptomeninges]], which appear to be [[edema]]tous and have multiple small hemorrhagic foci.]]\nThe body block that was used earlier to elevate the chest cavity is now used to elevate the head. To examine the [[brain]], an incision is made from behind one ear, over the crown of the head, to a point behind the other ear. When the autopsy is completed, the incision can be neatly sewn up and is not noticed when the head is resting on a pillow in an open casket [[funeral]]. The [[scalp]] is pulled away from the [[skull]] in two flaps with the front flap going over the face and the rear flap over the back of the neck. The skull is then cut with a circular (or semicircular) bladed reciprocating saw to create a \"cap\" that can be pulled off, exposing the brain. The brain is then observed in situ. Then the brain's connection to the cranial nerves and [[spinal cord]] are severed, and the brain is lifted out of the skull for further examination. If the brain needs to be preserved before being inspected, it is contained in a large container of formalin (15 percent solution of [[formaldehyde]] gas in buffered [[water]]) for at least two, but preferably four weeks. This not only preserves the brain, but also makes it firmer, allowing easier handling without corrupting the tissue.\n\n=== Reconstitution of the body ===\nAn important component of the autopsy is the reconstitution of the body such that it can be viewed, if desired, by relatives of the deceased following the procedure. After the examination, the body has an open and empty [[thoracic cavity]] with chest flaps open on both sides, the top of the skull is missing, and the skull flaps are pulled over the face and neck. It is unusual to examine the face, arms, hands or legs internally.\n\nIn the UK, following the [[Human Tissue Act 2004]] all organs and tissue must be returned to the body unless permission is given by the family to retain any tissue for further investigation. Normally the internal body cavity is lined with cotton, wool, or a similar material, and the organs are then placed into a plastic bag to prevent leakage and are returned to the body cavity. The chest flaps are then closed and sewn back together and the skull cap is sewed back in place. Then the body may be wrapped in a [[shroud]], and it is common for relatives to not be able to tell the procedure has been done when the body is viewed in a [[funeral home|funeral parlor]] after [[embalming]].\n\n== History ==\n{{see also|Dissection#History|l1=History of dissection}}\n[[File:3492769920 f48c41bdc8 bDissection19.jpg|thumb|Dissection, 19th century US.]]\n\nAround 3000 BCE, [[ancient Egypt]]ians were one of the first civilizations to practice the removal and examination of the internal organs of humans in the religious practice of [[Mummy|mummification]].<ref name=\"Rothenberg\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/prehistory/egypt/dailylife/medicine.html|title=Medicine|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309103323/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/prehistory/egypt/dailylife/medicine.html|archivedate=9 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nAutopsies that opened the body to determine the cause of death were attested at least in the early third millennium BC, although they were opposed in many ancient societies where it was believed that the outward disfigurement of dead persons prevented them from entering the [[afterlife]]<ref name=\"Schafer 43\">{{cite book|last=Schafer|first=Elizabeth D.|title=Forensic Science|chapter=Ancient science and forensics|editor=Ayn Embar-seddon, Allan D.

He also developed the concept of pathological processes.\n\nDuring the turn of the 20th century, the [[Scotland Yard]] created the Office of the Forensic Pathologist, a medical examiner trained in medicine, charged with investigating the cause of all unnatural deaths, including accidents, homicides, suicides, etc.\n===Historical findings===\n{{Main|List of autopsical findings}}\n\n==Other animals (necropsy)==\n[[File:Enzootic pneumonia ewe.jpg|thumb|A field post-mortem exam of a [[Sheep|ewe]].]]\n\nPost-mortem examination, or '''necropsy''', is far more common in [[veterinary medicine]] than in [[Medicine|human medicine]].
