His wife, who was a favourite lady-in-waiting to the ex-Queen, was killed in a motor accident in 1929 when on an official visit to Indo-China.''</ref> He received his primary education at [[Suankularb Wittayalai School]] in Bangkok.  He pursued his law education at [[Assumption College (Thailand)|Assumption College]] and at the Law School of the [[Ministry of Justice]]. He then continued his studies abroad; at the [[Middle Temple]],  in [[London]],  [[England]]. After he had finished his education, he began to work for the Ministry of Justice and climbed the traditional career ladder and was eventually granted the title '''[[Thai royal and noble titles#Phraya|Phraya]]''' and received his honorary name: \"Manopakorn Nititada\". In 1918, he gained a seat in the [[Privy Council]] of King [[Vajiravudh]] (or Rama VI).\n\n==Revolution and premiership==\n[[File:Siam-tries-a-peoples-party.jpg|thumb|250px|Phraya Manopakorn Nititada addressing the crowd at Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall after the [[Siamese revolution of 1932|1932 revolution]]|left]]\nFollowing the [[Siamese revolution of 1932|Revolution of 1932]], King [[Prajadhipok]] (or Rama VII) consented to a [[Constitution of Thailand#1932 Temporary Charter|Provisional Constitution]] on 27 June 1932. The first [[National Assembly of Thailand|People's Assembly of Siam]], composed entirely of appointed members, met for the first time on 28 June. The revolutionary Khana Ratsadon Party, not wanting to appear as if it had instigated the revolution for self-aggrandizement, chose Phraya Manopakorn as President of the Committee. He was considered a largely neutral and clean figure, but at the same time respected enough to take the position.\n\nAs a result, the Assembly with the advice of [[Pridi Panomyong]], one of the leaders of the [[Khana Ratsadon]] offered Manopakorn the post of \"President of the [[People\u2019s Committee of Siam|People's Committee]]\", an early version of the post of [[Prime Minister]].\n\nThe first mission of Phraya Manopakorn's Cabinet was to draft a permanent constitution. King Prajadhipok made an observation that the term \"President of the People's Committee\" sounded like a [[communist]] or republican post. After a debate, the office was eventually changed to \"prime minister\". The [[Constitution of Thailand#1932 Constitution|first constitution of Siam]] was promulgated under Phraya Manopakorn's watch on 10 December 1932, now celebrated as the [[Public holidays in Thailand|Thai Constitution Day]].\n\nSoon after, Phraya Manopakorn became the head of the first constitutional [[Government of Thailand|government of Siam]]. The Manopakorn [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]], or People's Committee, composed of members, half from the People's Party and half from senior [[civil servant]]s and military officers, was appointed under the guidance of the party. Phraya Manopakorn in essence became the Khana Ratsadon's puppet, and the country a single-party state.\n\n==Yellow Cover Dossier incident and Coup==\nIn 1933, [[Pridi Panomyong]], by then a [[Minister of State]], presented his Draft Economic Plan or '''Yellow Cover Dossier''' to King Prajadhipok. The dossier was an economic plan, which advocated [[socialist]] solutions to the country's many financial and economic problems. Prajadhipok even branded the dossier \"communist\" and attacked Pridi publicly about it. When Pridi's dossier was rejected, his status fell and caused a major disruption among the members of People's Party and the People's Committee itself.\n\nPhraya Mano rallied those who opposed the socialist plan of Pridi including [[Songsuradet Rebellion|Phraya Songsuradet]] and dissolved his own cabinet to oust Pridi, who had great support within the People's Party. To regain some stability and silence domestic critics, Phraya Manopakorn had some articles in the constitution suspended. Manopakorn barred the People's Assembly from any further meetings and the [[judiciary]] was shut down. Pridi was forced to flee to [[France]]. It was said that Manopakorn \"led the coup with his pen\", this event is known in Thailand as the \"April 1933 Coup\" (or the \"Silent Coup\") ([[Thai language|Thai:]] \u0e23\u0e31\u0e10\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23\u0e43\u0e19\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22 \u0e40\u0e21\u0e29\u0e32\u0e22\u0e19 \u0e1e.\u0e28. 2476). Phraya Manopakorn then approved the Anti-Communist Act, which empowered him to arrest those suspected of having communist sentiments: the entire Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of Siam]] was arrested and imprisoned.\n\nAfter the Yellow Dossier Incident, the degree of political freedom was greatly reduced by Phraya Manopakorn's policies. He censored many leftist activities including shutting down [[newspapers]] and [[publications]]. However the People's Party, which gave him the premiership, would eventually be his downfall. On 16 June, [[Phraya Pahol Polpayuhasena]], the country's most powerful military leader and member of the People's Party, together with three other senior officers retired from the People's Committee, for \"health reasons\".\n\n==Death and legacy==\n[[File:Phraya Manopakon Nitithada Memoriam Stone at Wat Pathumwanaram 2019 01.jpg|thumb|Phraya Manopakorn Nititada's memorial in [[Wat Pathum Wanaram]], [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]]]\nThe [[1933 Siamese coup d'\u00e9tat]] happened on 20 June, led by Phraya Pahol and other military leaders. Phraya Manopakorn was immediately removed as prime minister. Phraya Phahol appointed himself the country's second prime minister and took over the government. King Pradhipok duly accepted his appointment. Manopakorn was then exiled to [[Penang]], [[British Malaya]], and lived there until his death in 1948, aged 64.\n\nPhraya Manopakorn was Siam's first prime minister and the first to be ousted by a coup. He would not be the last civilian prime minister to be ousted by a military coup. His legacy is mixed: on the one hand he took over the reins of government at a difficult time ([[Wall Street Crash of 1929]]), but on the other he exceeded his powers and was not able to counter the powers of the [[Khana Ratsadon]] which became increasingly dictatorial.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Prime Ministers of Thailand]]\n* [[1932 Siamese coup d'\u00e9tat]]\n* [[Siamese coup d'\u00e9tat of 1933]]\n* [[People's Committee of Siam]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Paul Preston, Michael Partridge, Antony Best, ''British Documents on Foreign Affairs--Reports and Papers from the Foreign Office Confidential Print, Volume 6'', University Publications of America, 1997, {{ISBN|1-55655-674-8}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{s-new|creation}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Prime Minister of Thailand]]|years=1932-1933}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Phraya Phahol Pholphayuhasena]]}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n{{Prime Ministers of Thailand}}\n{{History of Thailand 1932 - 1973}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Manopakorn Nititada, Phraya}}\n[[Category:Prime Ministers of Thailand]]\n[[Category:Ministers of Finance of Thailand]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Dushdi Mala Medal, Pin of Arts and Science]]\n[[Category:Members of the Middle Temple]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Assumption College (Thailand)]]\n[[Category:Thai people of Chinese descent]]\n[[Category:Phraya]]\n[[Category:People from Bangkok]]\n[[Category:1884 births]]\n[[Category:1948 deaths]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=November 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2016}}\n{{More citations needed|date=December 2009}}\n{{Infobox Prime Minister\n|honorific-prefix = [[Thai royal and noble titles#Gentlemen|Phraya]]\n|name        = Manopakorn Nititada\n|native_name   = \u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e22\u0e32\u0e21\u0e42\u0e19\u0e1b\u0e01\u0e23\u0e13\u0e4c\u0e19\u0e34\u0e15\u0e34\u0e18\u0e32\u0e14\u0e32\n|nationality   = [[Thailand|Thai]]\n|image         = Phraya Manopakorn Nititada.jpg\n|caption       =\n|order         = [[Prime Minister of Thailand|Prime Minister of Siam]]\n|monarch       = [[Prajadhipok]]\n|term_start    = 28 June 1932\n|term_end      = 20 June 1933\n|successor     = [[Phraya Phahonphonphayuhasena]]\n|predecessor = Position established\n| office2       = [[Ministry of Finance (Thailand)|Finance Minister of Thailand]]\n| primeminister2  = Himself\n| term_start2     = 10 December 1932\n| term_end2       = 24 June 1933\n| predecessor2    = Phraya Manopakorn Nititada <small>(as Minister of Treasury)</small>\n| successor2      = [[Chao Phraya Srithammatibet]]\n| office3       = [[Ministry of Finance (Thailand)|Minister of Treasury]]\n| term_start3     = 29 June 1932\n| term_end3       = 10 December 1932\n| predecessor3    = [[Suphayok Kasem]]\n| successor3      = Phraya Manopakorn Nititada <small>(as Finance Minister of Thailand)</small>\n|birth_date    = {{Birth date|df=yes|1884|7|15}}\n|birth_place   = [[Bangkok]], [[Siam]]\n|death_date    = {{Death date and age|df=yes|1948|10|1|1884|7|15}}\n|death_place   = [[Penang]], [[British Malaya]]\n|party = [[Khana Ratsadon]]\n|spouse = Nit Sanasen <small>(Deceased)</small><br />Choei Hutasingha\n|children    = Tum Hutasingha\n}}\n\n'''[[Thai royal and noble titles#Phraya|Phraya]] Manopakorn Nititada''' ({{lang-th|\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e22\u0e32\u0e21\u0e42\u0e19\u0e1b\u0e01\u0e23\u0e13\u0e4c\u0e19\u0e34\u0e15\u0e34\u0e18\u0e32\u0e14\u0e32}}; {{IPA-th|p\u02b0r\u00e1.ja\u02d0 m\u00e1.no\u02d0.p\u00e0.k\u0254\u02d0n n\u00ed.t\u00ec.t\u02b0a\u02d0.da\u02d0|IPA}}; born '''Kon Hutasingha''' ({{lang-th|\u0e01\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e19 \u0e2b\u0e38\u0e15\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e4c}}; {{IPA-th|k\u0254\u0302\u02d0n h\u00f9.t\u00e0.s\u01d0\u014b|IPA}}); 15 July 1884 \u2013 1 October 1948) was the first [[Prime Minister of Siam]] after the [[Siamese Revolution of 1932]] as he was selected by the leader of the [[Khana Ratsadon|People's Party]] \u2013 the party that instigated the revolution.

It was said that Manopakorn \"led the coup with his pen\", this event is known in Thailand as the \"April 1933 Coup\" (or the \"Silent Coup\") ([[Thai language|Thai:]] \u0e23\u0e31\u0e10\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23\u0e43\u0e19\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22 \u0e40\u0e21\u0e29\u0e32\u0e22\u0e19 \u0e1e.\u0e28. 2476). Phraya Manopakorn then approved the Anti-Communist Act, which empowered him to arrest those suspected of having communist sentiments: the entire Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of Siam]] was arrested and imprisoned.\n\nAfter the Yellow Dossier Incident, the degree of political freedom was greatly reduced by Phraya Manopakorn's policies. He censored many leftist activities including shutting down [[newspapers]] and [[publications]]. However the People's Party, which gave him the premiership, would eventually be his downfall. On 16 June, [[Phraya Pahol Polpayuhasena]], the country's most powerful military leader and member of the People's Party, together with three other senior officers retired from the People's Committee, for \"health reasons\".\n\n==Death and legacy==\n[[File:Phraya Manopakon Nitithada Memoriam Stone at Wat Pathumwanaram 2019 01.jpg|thumb|Phraya Manopakorn Nititada's memorial in [[Wat Pathum Wanaram]], [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]]]\nThe [[1933 Siamese coup d'\u00e9tat]] happened on 20 June, led by Phraya Pahol and other military leaders. Phraya Manopakorn was immediately removed as prime minister. Phraya Phahol appointed himself the country's second prime minister and took over the government. King Pradhipok duly accepted his appointment. Manopakorn was then exiled to [[Penang]], [[British Malaya]], and lived there until his death in 1948, aged 64.\n\nPhraya Manopakorn was Siam's first prime minister and the first to be ousted by a coup. He would not be the last civilian prime minister to be ousted by a military coup. His legacy is mixed: on the one hand he took over the reins of government at a difficult time ([[Wall Street Crash of 1929]]), but on the other he exceeded his powers and was not able to counter the powers of the [[Khana Ratsadon]] which became increasingly dictatorial.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Prime Ministers of Thailand]]\n* [[1932 Siamese coup d'\u00e9tat]]\n* [[Siamese coup d'\u00e9tat of 1933]]\n* [[People's Committee of Siam]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Paul Preston, Michael Partridge, Antony Best, ''British Documents on Foreign Affairs--Reports and Papers from the Foreign Office Confidential Print, Volume 6'', University Publications of America, 1997, {{ISBN|1-55655-674-8}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{s-new|creation}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Prime Minister of Thailand]]|years=1932-1933}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Phraya Phahol Pholphayuhasena]]}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n{{Prime Ministers of Thailand}}\n{{History of Thailand 1932 - 1973}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Manopakorn Nititada, Phraya}}\n[[Category:Prime Ministers of Thailand]]\n[[Category:Ministers of Finance of Thailand]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Dushdi Mala Medal, Pin of Arts and Science]]\n[[Category:Members of the Middle Temple]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Assumption College (Thailand)]]\n[[Category:Thai people of Chinese descent]]\n[[Category:Phraya]]\n[[Category:People from Bangkok]]\n[[Category:1884 births]]\n[[Category:1948 deaths]]\n", "name_user": "171.97.223.56", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phraya_Manopakorn_Nititada"}

The genus includes three species, whose diagnostic key characters often overlap.<ref>Mabberley 1997</ref> Under favorable conditions it is an impressive tree of 3 to 20 m. tall. It is native of rich soils in the cloud zone of always moist spots in subtropical climate with a high air-humidity, on the Canary and [[Madeira]] islands.\n\n==Overview==\nThe laurel is [[plant sexuality#Individual plant sexuality|dioecious]] ([[unisexual]]), with male and female [[flower]]s on separate plants. Each flower is fragrant creamy white flower, about 1&nbsp;cm diameter, and they are born in pairs beside a leaf. The canary laurel is a vigorous, conical tree.\n\nLaurus novocanariensis is a species characteristic of [[laurel forest]] named [[laurisilva]] in Canary islands. Until 2004 it was considered the same species as [[Laurus azorica]], which is in danger of extinction.\nWe found many differences in genetic, morphological and physiological between them.

He was criticized for his subsequent denial of [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|widespread famine (1932\u20131933) in the USSR]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Choma|first1=Lidia|title=Holodomor Facts and History|url=http://www.holodomorct.org/history.html|ref=Uncovering the Truth}}</ref> most particularly the [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. Years later, there were calls to revoke his Pulitzer. In 1990, ''The New York Times'', which submitted his works for the prize in 1932, wrote that his later articles denying the famine constituted \"some of the worst reporting to appear in this newspaper.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Meyer |first=Karl E. |authorlink=Karl E.

His grandparents had moved to Birkenhead on the Wirral from the West Indies in 1842 and established a successful merchant business there in which his father worked. He studied at [[Harrow School|Harrow]], one of Britain's most prestigious public schools, but a sudden collapse in the family business led to a transfer to [[Bedford College, London|Bedford College]]. Nevertheless, he then gained a scholarship to study at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]], where he graduated with a first-class degree.<ref>Elizabeth A. Brennan and Elizabeth C.

Duranty's biographer, Sally J. Taylor, said that Duranty met [[Aleister Crowley]] and participated in magic rituals with him during this period. According to Taylor, Duranty became involved in a relationship with Crowley's mistress Jane Cheron, and eventually married her.<ref>{{cite book | last=Taylor | first=Sally J. | author-link = <!--Sally J.

He then moved to [[Riga]], the capital of [[Latvia]], to cover events in the newly independent [[Baltic States]].\n\n==Career in Moscow, 1922\u20131934==\nDuranty moved to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1921.\n\nOn holiday in France in 1924, Duranty's left leg was injured in a train wreck. After an operation, the surgeon discovered [[gangrene]]; and the leg was amputated. Once he had recovered, Duranty resumed his career as a [[journalist]] in the Soviet Union. During the [[New Economic Policy]] with its mixed economy, Duranty's articles from Moscow did not draw wide attention. It was after the advent of the [[first five-year plan]] (1928\u20131933), which aimed to transform Soviet industry and agriculture, that Duranty made his mark.\n\nIn 1929, he was granted an exclusive interview with [[Joseph Stalin]] that greatly enhanced his reputation as a journalist. Duranty was to remain in Moscow for twelve years, settling in the United States in 1934. Thereafter, he remained on [[Retainer agreement|retainer]] for ''[[The New York Times]]'', which required him to spend several months a year in [[Moscow]]. It was in this capacity that Duranty reported on the [[Moscow Trials|show trials]] of Stalin's political opponents in 1936\u20131938.\n\n===Views on the Soviet Union, 1931 and after===\nIn the 1931 series of reports for which he received the 1932 [[Pulitzer Prize for Correspondence]], Duranty argued that the Russian people were \"[[Culture of Asia|Asiatic]]\" in thought: they valued communal effort and required [[Autocracy|autocratic government]]. [[Individualism|Individuality]] and [[Privately held company#Privately owned enterprise|private enterprise]] were alien concepts to the Russian people, which only led to social disruption and were unacceptable to them just as [[Tyrant|tyranny]] and [[Communism]] were unacceptable to the [[Western world]].\n\nFailed attempts, since the time of [[Peter the Great]], to apply Western ideals in [[Russia]] were a form of European [[colonialism]], he wrote, that had been finally swept away by the [[Russian Revolution|1917 Revolution]]. [[Vladimir Lenin]] and his [[New Economic Policy]] were both failures tainted by Western thought. Duranty felt that Stalin scrapped the [[New Economic Policy]] because he had no political competition. The famine in [[Ukraine]] demonstrated the lack of organized opposition to Stalin, because his position was never truly threatened by the catastrophe; Stalin's purges surely contributed to this political vacuum. Stalin succeeded in doing what Lenin could only attempt to do, i.e., he \"re-established a dictator of the [[Imperialism|imperial]] idea and put himself in charge\" by means of intimidation. \"Stalin didn't look upon himself as a dictator, but as a 'guardian of a sacred flame' that he called [[Stalinism]] for lack of a better name.\"<ref>Walter Duranty, ''Duranty Reports Russia'' (New York: [[Viking Press]], 1934)</ref> [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|Stalin's five-year plan]] was an attempt to effect a new way of life for the Russian people.\n\nDuranty argued that the Soviet Union's mentality in 1931 greatly differed from the perception created by [[Karl Marx]]'s ideas. Duranty claimed: \"It would be more proper to refer to the principle present during the period of Stalin's reign as 'Stalinism'\",<ref>Walter Duranty, ''Duranty Reports Russia'' (New York: Viking Press, 1934), 238.</ref> which Duranty viewed as a progression and integration of [[Marxism]] combined with [[Leninism]]. In one of the articles submitted for the Pulitzer Prize (\"Stalinism smashes foes in Marx's name\", 24 June 1931) Duranty gives his views of the Soviet actions in the countryside that eventually led to the famine.<ref>{{cite web|last=Duranty |first=Walter |url=http://www.garethjones.org/soviet_articles/duranty_1931_8.htm |title=Stalinism Smashes Foes in Marx's Name |publisher=The New York Times |website=Garethjones.org |date=June 24, 1931 |access-date=September 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>what is happening now to the Kulaks is leading to the same result\u2014the kulaks who, under Leninism were an almost privileged class, encouraged to work and prosper (did not Bukharin then Leninism's chief spokesman, ... once say to the peasants, \"Enrich yourselves,\" that is, become kulaks better than\u2014or a different class from\u2014your fellows by individual, self\u2014helping effort?) \"The liquidation of the kulak as a class\" runs the present slogan whose meaning in terms of reality is that 5,000,000 human beings, 1,000,000 families of the best and most energetic farmers are to be dispossessed, dispersed, demolished, to be literally melted or \"liquidated\" into the rising flood of classless proletarians.\n\nHere, when you get right down to it, is the supreme justification from the Bolshevik angle of the cruel and often bloody pressure upon \"the former People\" or class enemies from Czar to kulak. Where Marxism theorized Stalin acts. Marxism says, \"Eliminate class distinctions\" and Stalinism does so by the simple and effective process of destructions, as Tamerlane destroyed his enemies or the Hebrew prophet [Samuel] slew for the glory of Jehovah.</blockquote>\n\nDuranty sometimes claimed that individuals being sent to the [[labor camp]]s in the Russian North, Siberia or Kazakhstan were given a choice between rejoining [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] society or becoming underprivileged outsiders. However, he also said that, for those who could not accept the system, \"the final fate of such enemies is death\". Though describing the system as cruel, he said he has \"no brief for or against it, nor any purpose save to try to tell the truth\". He ends the article with the claim that the brutal collectivization campaign was motivated by the \"hope or promise of a subsequent raising up\" of Asian-minded masses in the Soviet Union which only history could judge.\n\nRather than just repeating the Stalinist viewpoint, Duranty often admitted the brutality of the Stalinist system then proceeded to both explain and defend why dictatorship or brutality were necessary. In addition, he repeated Soviet views as his own opinion, as if his 'observations' from Moscow had given him deeper insights into the country as a whole.\n\nDuranty's motivations have been hotly debated and his reporting is faulted for being too uncritical of the USSR, presenting Soviet propaganda as legitimate reporting.<ref>{{cite news|last=Steinberg|first=Jacques|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/23/us/times-should-lose-pulitzer-from-30-s-consultant-says.html|title=Times Should Lose Pulitzer From 30's, Consultant Says|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 23, 2003|access-date=September 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn his praise of Joseph Stalin as an imperial, national, \"authentically Russian\" dictator to be compared to [[Ivan the Terrible]], Duranty was expressing views similar to those of some [[White \u00e9migr\u00e9|White (Russian) \u00e9migr\u00e9s]] during the same period,<ref>[https://www.mit.edu/people/fjk/Rogovin/volume6/xiii.html \u0420\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d, \u0412.\u0417. \u00ab\u0411\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u043b\u0438 \u0430\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0430\u00bb. \u0422\u043e\u043c 6.

(Jones' release was itself immediately preceded by three unsigned articles describing the famine in the ''[[The Guardian|Manchester Guardian]]''.)<ref>Malcolm Muggeridge, ''Chronicles of Wasted Time. Vol 1, The Green Stick'', London: Fontana (pbk), p. 286. The articles appeared on 25, 27 and 28 March 1933.</ref>\n\nUnder the title \"Russians Hungry, But Not Starving\" Duranty's article described the situation as follows:\n\n<blockquote>In the middle of the diplomatic duel between Great Britain and the Soviet Union over the accused British engineers, there appears from a British source a big scare story in the American press about famine in the Soviet Union, with \"thousands already dead and millions menaced by death from starvation\".</blockquote>\n\nThe \"diplomatic duel\" was a reference to the [[Metro-Vickers Affair|arrest of engineers]] from the [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] company who were working in the USSR. Accused with Soviet citizens of \"wrecking\" (sabotaging) the plant they were building, they were the subjects of one in a series of show trials presided over by [[Andrey Vyshinsky]]<ref>Gordon W. Morrell, ''Britain confronts the Stalin Revolution: the Metro-Vickers crisis'', Ontario: Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1995.</ref> during the First Five Year Plan.\n\nFive months later (23 August 1933), in another ''New York Times'' article, Duranty wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Any report of a famine in Russia is today an exaggeration or malignant propaganda.

''Reflections on a Ravaged Century'', Oxford University Press, New York. 1986, p. 320.</ref>\n\nFollowing sensitive negotiations in November 1933 that resulted in the establishment of relations between the U.S. and the [[Soviet Union|U.S.S.R.]], a dinner was given for Soviet Foreign Minister [[Maxim Litvinov]] in New York City's [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]]. Each of the attendees' names was read in turn, politely applauded by the guests, until Duranty's. Whereupon, [[Alexander Woollcott]] wrote, \"the one really prolonged pandemonium was evoked ... Indeed, one quite got the impression that America, in a spasm of discernment, was recognizing both Russia and Walter Duranty.\"<ref name=\"ConqRav\" />\n\nSally J. Taylor, author of the critical Duranty biography ''Stalin's Apologist'', argues that his reporting from the USSR was a key factor in U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s 1933 decision to grant official recognition to the Soviet Union.<ref name=Taylor />\n\n==Later career==\nIn 1934, Duranty left Moscow and visited the [[White House]] in the company of Soviet officials, including Litvinov. He continued as a Special Correspondent for ''The New York Times'' until 1940.\n\nHe wrote several books on the Soviet Union after 1940. His name was on a [[Orwell's list|list maintained by writer George Orwell]] of those Orwell considered to be unsuitable as possible writers for the British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]]'s [[Information Research Department]] owing to the possibility of them being too sympathetic to communism or possibly paid communist agents.<ref>John Ezard [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jun/21/books.artsandhumanities ''Blair's babe: Did love turn Orwell into a government stooge?''] ''The Guardian'', June 21, 2003]</ref>\n\n==Death==\nDuranty died in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], Florida in 1957 and is interred at Greenwood Cemetery.\n\n==Scholarship on Duranty's work==\nDuranty was reporting at a time when opinions were strongly divided on the Soviet Union and its leadership.\n\nThe admission of the USSR to the [[League of Nations]] in 1934 was viewed optimistically by some. Others saw an inevitable confrontation between [[fascism]] and [[communism]] as requiring individuals to take one side or the other. After [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the USSR]], [[Joseph E. Davies]], former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union (1936\u20131938), wrote positively about \"Russia and its people in their gallant struggle to preserve the peace until ruthless aggression made war inevitable\". In the same book he referred to Stalin as a \"decent and clean-living\" man and \"a great leader.\"<ref>Davies, Joseph E. ''Mission to Moscow''. Garden City Publishing, Garden City, NY, 1941</ref>\n\nMany reporters of Duranty's time slanted their coverage in favour of the Soviet Union. Some drew a contrast with the capitalist world, sinking under the weight of the [[Great Depression]]; others wrote out of a true belief in Communism; some acted out of fear of being expelled from [[Moscow]], which would result in a loss of livelihood. At home many of their editors found it hard to believe a state would deliberately starve millions of its own people. Duranty's reports for ''The New York Times'' were a source of much frustration for the paper's readers in 1932, because they directly contradicted the line taken on the paper's own [[editorial]] page.<ref name=\"TimesEditorial\" />\n\n===The Holodomor (1932-1933) and the 1938 Moscow Show Trials===\nDuranty has been criticized for deferring to [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and the [[Soviet Union]]'s official [[propaganda]] rather than reporting news, both when he was living in Moscow and later. For example, he later defended Stalin's [[Moscow Trials|Moscow Trials of 1938]], which were staged to eliminate potential challengers to Stalin's authority.<ref>Robert Conquest, ''The Great Terror'', 1968, p. //.</ref>\n\nThe major controversy regarding his work remains his reporting on the great famine of 1932\u201333 that struck certain parts of the USSR after agriculture was forcibly and rapidly \"collectivised\".

[[Robert Conquest]] was critical of Duranty's reporting in ''The Great Terror'' (1968), ''[[The Harvest of Sorrow]]'' (1986) and, most recently, in ''Reflections on a Ravaged Century'' (1990).

Taylor,<ref name=Taylor /> ''The New York Times'' assigned a member of its editorial board, Karl Meyer, to write a signed editorial about Duranty's work for the ''Times''. In a scathing piece, Meyer said (24 June 1990) that Duranty's articles were \"some of the worst reporting to appear in this newspaper.\" Duranty, Meyer said, had bet his career on Stalin's rise and \"strove to preserve it by ignoring or excusing Stalin's crimes.\"<ref name=\"TimesEditorial\" /> The Pulitzer Board in 1990 reconsidered the prize but decided to preserve it as awarded.<ref>anon, ''[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-10-22-ny-times-pulitzer_x.htm N.Y.

Von Hagen found Duranty's reports to be unbalanced and uncritical, and that they far too often gave voice to [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] [[propaganda]]. In comments to the press he stated, \"For the sake of ''The New York Times''{{'}} honor, they should take the prize away.\"<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-10-22-ny-times-pulitzer_x.htm \"N.Y.

In a press release of November 21, 2003, he stated that with regard to the 13 articles by Duranty from 1931 submitted for the award \"there was not clear and convincing evidence of deliberate deception, the relevant standard in this case.\"<ref>[http://www.pulitzer.org/news/statement-walter-duranty \"Statement on Walter Duranty's 1932 Prize\"]</ref>\n\n==Literary awards==\n(''other than Pulitzer'')\n* O.

His grandparents had moved to Birkenhead on the Wirral from the West Indies in 1842 and established a successful merchant business there in which his father worked. He studied at [[Harrow School|Harrow]], one of Britain's most prestigious public schools, but a sudden collapse in the family business led to a transfer to [[Bedford College, London|Bedford College]]. Nevertheless, he then gained a scholarship to study at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]], where he graduated with a first-class degree.<ref>Elizabeth A. Brennan and Elizabeth C.

He then moved to [[Riga]], the capital of [[Latvia]], to cover events in the newly independent [[Baltic States]].\n\n==Career in Moscow, 1922\u20131934==\nDuranty moved to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1921.\n\nOn holiday in France in 1924, Duranty's left leg was injured in a train wreck. After an operation, the surgeon discovered [[gangrene]]; and the leg was amputated. Once he had recovered, Duranty resumed his career as a [[journalist]] in the Soviet Union. During the [[New Economic Policy]] with its mixed economy, Duranty's articles from Moscow did not draw wide attention. It was after the advent of the [[first five-year plan]] (1928\u20131933), which aimed to transform Soviet industry and agriculture, that Duranty made his mark.\n\nIn 1929, he was granted an exclusive interview with [[Joseph Stalin]] that greatly enhanced his reputation as a journalist. Duranty was to remain in Moscow for twelve years, settling in the United States in 1934. Thereafter, he remained on [[Retainer agreement|retainer]] for ''[[The New York Times]]'', which required him to spend several months a year in [[Moscow]]. It was in this capacity that Duranty reported on the [[Moscow Trials|show trials]] of Stalin's political opponents in 1936\u20131938.\n\n===Views on the Soviet Union, 1931 and after===\nIn the 1931 series of reports for which he received the 1932 [[Pulitzer Prize for Correspondence]], Duranty argued that the Russian people were \"[[Culture of Asia|Asiatic]]\" in thought: they valued communal effort and required [[Autocracy|autocratic government]]. [[Individualism|Individuality]] and [[Privately held company#Privately owned enterprise|private enterprise]] were alien concepts to the Russian people, which only led to social disruption and were unacceptable to them just as [[Tyrant|tyranny]] and [[Communism]] were unacceptable to the [[Western world]].\n\nFailed attempts, since the time of [[Peter the Great]], to apply Western ideals in [[Russia]] were a form of European [[colonialism]], he wrote, that had been finally swept away by the [[Russian Revolution|1917 Revolution]]. [[Vladimir Lenin]] and his [[New Economic Policy]] were both failures tainted by Western thought. Duranty felt that Stalin scrapped the [[New Economic Policy]] because he had no political competition. The famine in [[Ukraine]] demonstrated the lack of organized opposition to Stalin, because his position was never truly threatened by the catastrophe; Stalin's purges surely contributed to this political vacuum. Stalin succeeded in doing what Lenin could only attempt to do, i.e., he \"re-established a dictator of the [[Imperialism|imperial]] idea and put himself in charge\" by means of intimidation. \"Stalin didn't look upon himself as a dictator, but as a 'guardian of a sacred flame' that he called [[Stalinism]] for lack of a better name.\"<ref>Walter Duranty, ''Duranty Reports Russia'' (New York: [[Viking Press]], 1934)</ref> [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|Stalin's five-year plan]] was an attempt to effect a new way of life for the Russian people.\n\nDuranty argued that the Soviet Union's mentality in 1931 greatly differed from the perception created by [[Karl Marx]]'s ideas. Duranty claimed: \"It would be more proper to refer to the principle present during the period of Stalin's reign as 'Stalinism'\",<ref>Walter Duranty, ''Duranty Reports Russia'' (New York: Viking Press, 1934), 238.</ref> which Duranty viewed as a progression and integration of [[Marxism]] combined with [[Leninism]]. In one of the articles submitted for the Pulitzer Prize (\"Stalinism smashes foes in Marx's name\", 24 June 1931) Duranty gives his views of the Soviet actions in the countryside that eventually led to the famine.<ref>{{cite web|last=Duranty |first=Walter |url=http://www.garethjones.org/soviet_articles/duranty_1931_8.htm |title=Stalinism Smashes Foes in Marx's Name |publisher=The New York Times |website=Garethjones.org |date=June 24, 1931 |access-date=September 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>what is happening now to the Kulaks is leading to the same result\u2014the kulaks who, under Leninism were an almost privileged class, encouraged to work and prosper (did not Bukharin then Leninism's chief spokesman, ... once say to the peasants, \"Enrich yourselves,\" that is, become kulaks better than\u2014or a different class from\u2014your fellows by individual, self\u2014helping effort?) \"The liquidation of the kulak as a class\" runs the present slogan whose meaning in terms of reality is that 5,000,000 human beings, 1,000,000 families of the best and most energetic farmers are to be dispossessed, dispersed, demolished, to be literally melted or \"liquidated\" into the rising flood of classless proletarians.\n\nHere, when you get right down to it, is the supreme justification from the Bolshevik angle of the cruel and often bloody pressure upon \"the former People\" or class enemies from Czar to kulak. Where Marxism theorized Stalin acts. Marxism says, \"Eliminate class distinctions\" and Stalinism does so by the simple and effective process of destructions, as Tamerlane destroyed his enemies or the Hebrew prophet [Samuel] slew for the glory of Jehovah.</blockquote>\n\nDuranty sometimes claimed that individuals being sent to the [[labor camp]]s in the Russian North, Siberia or Kazakhstan were given a choice between rejoining [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] society or becoming underprivileged outsiders. However, he also said that, for those who could not accept the system, \"the final fate of such enemies is death\". Though describing the system as cruel, he said he has \"no brief for or against it, nor any purpose save to try to tell the truth\". He ends the article with the claim that the brutal collectivization campaign was motivated by the \"hope or promise of a subsequent raising up\" of Asian-minded masses in the Soviet Union which only history could judge.\n\nRather than just repeating the Stalinist viewpoint, Duranty often admitted the brutality of the Stalinist system then proceeded to both explain and defend why dictatorship or brutality were necessary. In addition, he repeated Soviet views as his own opinion, as if his 'observations' from Moscow had given him deeper insights into the country as a whole.\n\nDuranty's motivations have been hotly debated and his reporting is faulted for being too uncritical of the USSR, presenting Soviet propaganda as legitimate reporting.<ref>{{cite news|last=Steinberg|first=Jacques|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/23/us/times-should-lose-pulitzer-from-30-s-consultant-says.html|title=Times Should Lose Pulitzer From 30's, Consultant Says|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 23, 2003|access-date=September 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn his praise of Joseph Stalin as an imperial, national, \"authentically Russian\" dictator to be compared to [[Ivan the Terrible]], Duranty was expressing views similar to those of some [[White \u00e9migr\u00e9|White (Russian) \u00e9migr\u00e9s]] during the same period,<ref>[https://www.mit.edu/people/fjk/Rogovin/volume6/xiii.html \u0420\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d, \u0412.\u0417. \u00ab\u0411\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u043b\u0438 \u0430\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0430\u00bb. \u0422\u043e\u043c 6.

''[[The New York Times]]'' editorial on Walter Duranty, 1990-06-24</ref>\n\n===Reporting the 1932\u20131933 famine===\nIn ''The New York Times'' on 31 March 1933, Walter Duranty denounced reports of a famine and, in particular, he attacked [[Gareth Jones (journalist)|Gareth Jones]], a British journalist who had witnessed the starving in Ukraine and issued a widely published press release about their plight two days earlier in Berlin. (Jones' release was itself immediately preceded by three unsigned articles describing the famine in the ''[[The Guardian|Manchester Guardian]]''.)<ref>Malcolm Muggeridge, ''Chronicles of Wasted Time. Vol 1, The Green Stick'', London: Fontana (pbk), p. 286. The articles appeared on 25, 27 and 28 March 1933.</ref>\n\nUnder the title \"Russians Hungry, But Not Starving\" Duranty's article described the situation as follows:\n\n<blockquote>In the middle of the diplomatic duel between Great Britain and the Soviet Union over the accused British engineers, there appears from a British source a big scare story in the American press about famine in the Soviet Union, with \"thousands already dead and millions menaced by death from starvation\".</blockquote>\n\nThe \"diplomatic duel\" was a reference to the [[Metro-Vickers Affair|arrest of engineers]] from the [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] company who were working in the USSR. Accused with Soviet citizens of \"wrecking\" (sabotaging) the plant they were building, they were the subjects of one in a series of show trials presided over by [[Andrey Vyshinsky]]<ref>Gordon W. Morrell, ''Britain confronts the Stalin Revolution: the Metro-Vickers crisis'', Ontario: Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1995.</ref> during the First Five Year Plan.\n\nFive months later (23 August 1933), in another ''New York Times'' article, Duranty wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Any report of a famine in Russia is today an exaggeration or malignant propaganda. The food shortage, however, which has affected the whole population in the last year and particularly in the grain-producing provinces&nbsp;\u2014 the Ukraine, [[North Caucasus Krai|North Caucasus]] [i.e. Kuban Region], and the [[Volga region|Lower Volga]]&nbsp;\u2014 has, however, caused heavy loss of life.</blockquote>\n\nDuranty concluded \"it is conservative to suppose\" that, in certain provinces with a total population of over 40 million, mortality had \"at least trebled.\" <ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXLhwVJvfXMC&pg=PA573&dq=The+food+shortage+which+has+affected+almost+the+whole+population+in+the+last+year,+and+particularly+in+the+grain-producing+provinces&lr=#v=onepage&q=The%20food%20shortage%20which%20has%20affected%20almost%20the%20whole%20population%20in%20the%20last%20year%2C%20and%20particularly%20in%20the%20grain-producing%20provinces&f=false ''Assignment in Utopia'' By Eugene Lyons].</ref> The duel in the press over the famine stories did not damage esteem for Duranty. ''[[The Nation]]'' then described his reporting as \"the most enlightened, dispassionate dispatches from a great nation in the making which appeared in any newspaper in the world.\"<ref name=ConqRav>Conquest, R. ''Reflections on a Ravaged Century'', Oxford University Press, New York. 1986, p. 320.</ref>\n\nFollowing sensitive negotiations in November 1933 that resulted in the establishment of relations between the U.S. and the [[Soviet Union|U.S.S.R.]], a dinner was given for Soviet Foreign Minister [[Maxim Litvinov]] in New York City's [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]]. Each of the attendees' names was read in turn, politely applauded by the guests, until Duranty's. Whereupon, [[Alexander Woollcott]] wrote, \"the one really prolonged pandemonium was evoked ... Indeed, one quite got the impression that America, in a spasm of discernment, was recognizing both Russia and Walter Duranty.\"<ref name=\"ConqRav\" />\n\nSally J. Taylor, author of the critical Duranty biography ''Stalin's Apologist'', argues that his reporting from the USSR was a key factor in U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s 1933 decision to grant official recognition to the Soviet Union.<ref name=Taylor />\n\n==Later career==\nIn 1934, Duranty left Moscow and visited the [[White House]] in the company of Soviet officials, including Litvinov. He continued as a Special Correspondent for ''The New York Times'' until 1940.\n\nHe wrote several books on the Soviet Union after 1940. His name was on a [[Orwell's list|list maintained by writer George Orwell]] of those Orwell considered to be unsuitable as possible writers for the British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]]'s [[Information Research Department]] owing to the possibility of them being too sympathetic to communism or possibly paid communist agents.<ref>John Ezard [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jun/21/books.artsandhumanities ''Blair's babe: Did love turn Orwell into a government stooge?''] ''The Guardian'', June 21, 2003]</ref>\n\n==Death==\nDuranty died in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], Florida in 1957 and is interred at Greenwood Cemetery.\n\n==Scholarship on Duranty's work==\nDuranty was reporting at a time when opinions were strongly divided on the Soviet Union and its leadership.\n\nThe admission of the USSR to the [[League of Nations]] in 1934 was viewed optimistically by some. Others saw an inevitable confrontation between [[fascism]] and [[communism]] as requiring individuals to take one side or the other. After [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the USSR]], [[Joseph E. Davies]], former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union (1936\u20131938), wrote positively about \"Russia and its people in their gallant struggle to preserve the peace until ruthless aggression made war inevitable\". In the same book he referred to Stalin as a \"decent and clean-living\" man and \"a great leader.\"<ref>Davies, Joseph E. ''Mission to Moscow''. Garden City Publishing, Garden City, NY, 1941</ref>\n\nMany reporters of Duranty's time slanted their coverage in favour of the Soviet Union. Some drew a contrast with the capitalist world, sinking under the weight of the [[Great Depression]]; others wrote out of a true belief in Communism; some acted out of fear of being expelled from [[Moscow]], which would result in a loss of livelihood. At home many of their editors found it hard to believe a state would deliberately starve millions of its own people. Duranty's reports for ''The New York Times'' were a source of much frustration for the paper's readers in 1932, because they directly contradicted the line taken on the paper's own [[editorial]] page.<ref name=\"TimesEditorial\" />\n\n===The Holodomor (1932-1933) and the 1938 Moscow Show Trials===\nDuranty has been criticized for deferring to [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and the [[Soviet Union]]'s official [[propaganda]] rather than reporting news, both when he was living in Moscow and later. For example, he later defended Stalin's [[Moscow Trials|Moscow Trials of 1938]], which were staged to eliminate potential challengers to Stalin's authority.<ref>Robert Conquest, ''The Great Terror'', 1968, p. //.</ref>\n\nThe major controversy regarding his work remains his reporting on the great famine of 1932\u201333 that struck certain parts of the USSR after agriculture was forcibly and rapidly \"collectivised\". He published reports stating \"there is no famine or actual starvation nor is there likely to be\" and \"any report of a famine in Russia is today an exaggeration or malignant propaganda\".<ref>[http://www.weeklystandard.com/pulitzer-winning-lies/article/4040 Pulitzer-Winning Lies] the Weekly Standard</ref> In Ukraine, the region most affected, this man-made disaster is today known as the [[Holodomor]].\n\nSince the late 1960s, Duranty's work has come increasingly under fire for failing to report the famine. [[Robert Conquest]] was critical of Duranty's reporting in ''The Great Terror'' (1968), ''[[The Harvest of Sorrow]]'' (1986) and, most recently, in ''Reflections on a Ravaged Century'' (1990). [[Joseph Alsop]] and Andrew Stuttaford spoke out against Duranty during the Pulitzer Prize controversy.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Andrew|last=Stuttaford|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/stuttaford/stuttaford050703.asp|title=Prize Specimen \u2013 The campaign to revoke Walter Duranty's Pulitzer|magazine=[[National Review]]|date=7 May 2003|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030519230426/http://www.nationalreview.com/stuttaford/stuttaford050703.asp|archivedate=19 May 2003}}</ref> \"Lying was Duranty's stock in trade,\" commented Alsop.

In 1934 he privately reported to the British embassy in Moscow that as many as 10 million people may have died, directly or indirectly, from famine in the Soviet Union in the previous year.<ref>[http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2017/05/fellow-travellers-and-useful-idiots \"Fellow travelers and useful idiots\", ''The New Statesman'', 8 May 2017].</ref>\n\nBoth [[Secret Intelligence Service|British intelligence]]<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=jQcPAQAAMAAJ ''The Foreign Office and the famine: British documents on Ukraine and the Great Famine of 1932\u20131933''] (Studies in East European nationalisms). \"Duranty&nbsp;... manipulated the official palaver so successfully that it was possible to interpret his article in several ways\", p. xxx.</ref> and American engineer Zara Witkin (1900\u20131940),<ref>{{cite web|first=Joyce |last=Ingraham |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/9951419 |title=Zara Witkin |publisher=Findagrave.com |date=November 23, 2004 |access-date=September 1, 2013}}</ref> who worked in the USSR from 1932 to 1934,<ref>''An American Engineer in Stalin's Russia: The Memoirs of Zara Witkin, 1932\u20131934'', University of California Press.</ref> confirmed that Duranty knowingly misrepresented information about the nature and scale of the famine.\n\nThere are some indications that Duranty's deliberate misdirection concerning the famine may have been the result of duress. Conquest believed Duranty was being blackmailed over his sexual proclivities.<ref>P. Murphy, ''The Collective Imagination: The Creative Spirit of Free Societies'', Ashgate Publishing, 2012, p. 25.</ref>\n\nIn his 1944 book, Duranty wrote in a chastened tone about his 1932\u201334 reporting, but he offered only a Stalinist defense of it.<ref name=\"Duranty_1944_pp188-199\">{{Harvnb|Duranty|1944|pp=188\u2013199}}</ref> He admits that people starved, including not just \"class enemies\" but also loyal communists,<ref name=\"Duranty_1944_pp188-199\"/> but he says that Stalin was forced to order the requisitions to equip the Red Army enough to deter an imminent Japanese invasion<ref name=\"Duranty_1944_pp188-199\"/> (a reprise of the [[Siberian Intervention]] of a decade earlier)\u2014in other words, to save the Soviet Union from impending military doom, not because Stalin wanted to collectivize the population at gunpoint, on pain of death.<ref name=\"Duranty_1944_pp188-199\"/> Although it is likely that Stalin ''did'' expect a Japanese invasion (expecting foreign attacks all the time), most historians today do not accept the view that it was his ''sole'' motivation and that Stalin did not intend any cruel and ruthless political dominance of the Soviet population. Of the notion that Stalin did intend the latter, Duranty said, \"What a misconception!\"<ref name=\"Duranty_1944_pp188-199\"/>\n\n==Calls for revocation of Pulitzer Prize, 1990\u20132003==\nThe concern over Duranty's reporting on the famine in Soviet Ukraine led to a move to posthumously and symbolically strip him of the Pulitzer Prize he received in 1932.\n\nIn response to ''Stalin's Apologist'' (1990), the critical biography by Sally J. Taylor,<ref name=Taylor /> ''The New York Times'' assigned a member of its editorial board, Karl Meyer, to write a signed editorial about Duranty's work for the ''Times''. In a scathing piece, Meyer said (24 June 1990) that Duranty's articles were \"some of the worst reporting to appear in this newspaper.\" Duranty, Meyer said, had bet his career on Stalin's rise and \"strove to preserve it by ignoring or excusing Stalin's crimes.\"<ref name=\"TimesEditorial\" /> The Pulitzer Board in 1990 reconsidered the prize but decided to preserve it as awarded.<ref>anon, ''[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-10-22-ny-times-pulitzer_x.htm N.Y.

Von Hagen found Duranty's reports to be unbalanced and uncritical, and that they far too often gave voice to [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] [[propaganda]]. In comments to the press he stated, \"For the sake of ''The New York Times''{{'}} honor, they should take the prize away.\"<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-10-22-ny-times-pulitzer_x.htm \"N.Y.

In a press release of November 21, 2003, he stated that with regard to the 13 articles by Duranty from 1931 submitted for the award \"there was not clear and convincing evidence of deliberate deception, the relevant standard in this case.\"<ref>[http://www.pulitzer.org/news/statement-walter-duranty \"Statement on Walter Duranty's 1932 Prize\"]</ref>\n\n==Literary awards==\n(''other than Pulitzer'')\n* O.

Development in this region is restricted by the [[Metropolitan Green Belt]]. Other large settlements include the county town of [[Aylesbury]], [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]] in the south near the [[River Thames|Thames]] and [[Princes Risborough]] in the west near Oxford. Some areas without direct rail links to London, such as around the old county town of [[Buckingham]] and near [[Olney, Buckinghamshire|Olney]] in the northeast, are much less populous. The largest town is [[Milton Keynes]] in the northeast, which with the surrounding area is administered as a [[Borough of Milton Keynes|unitary authority]] separately to the rest of Buckinghamshire. The remainder of the county is administered by [[Buckinghamshire Council]] as another unitary authority. In national elections, Buckinghamshire is considered a reliable supporter of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].\n\nA large part of the [[Chiltern Hills]], an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]], runs through the south of the county and attracts many walkers and cyclists from London. In this area older buildings are often made from local flint and red brick. Many parts of the county are quite affluent and like many areas around London this has led to high housing costs: several reports have identified the market town of [[Beaconsfield]] as having among the highest property prices outside London.<ref name=\"Beaconsfield cost\">{{cite web|last1=Spence|first1=Graham|title=Beaconsfield is the most expensive market town in England|url=http://www.getbucks.co.uk/news/local-news/beaconsfield-most-expensive-market-town-8257800|website=Get Bucks|accessdate=15 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222103912/http://www.getbucks.co.uk/news/local-news/beaconsfield-most-expensive-market-town-8257800|archive-date=22 December 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How expensive are the houses in your street?

To the north of the county lies rolling countryside in the [[Vale of Aylesbury]] and around the [[River Great Ouse|Great Ouse]]. The [[River Thames|Thames]] forms part of the county's southwestern boundary. Notable service amenities in the county are [[Pinewood Film Studios]], [[Dorney Lake|Dorney rowing lake]] and part of [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone race track]] on the Northamptonshire border. Many national companies have head-offices or major centres in Milton Keynes. Heavy industry and quarrying is limited, with agriculture predominating after service industries.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Buckinghamshire}}\n[[File:Buckingham-215x334.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Bucks (1904)]]\n\nThe name Buckinghamshire is [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] in origin and means ''The district (scire) of Bucca's home''. ''Bucca's home'' refers to [[Buckingham]] in the north of the county, and is named after an Anglo-Saxon landowner. The county has been so named since about the 12th century; however, the county has existed since it was a subdivision of the kingdom of [[Mercia]] (585\u2013919).\n\nThe history of the area predates the Anglo-Saxon period and the county has a rich history starting from the [[Celt]]ic and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] periods, though the Anglo-Saxons perhaps had the greatest impact on Buckinghamshire: the geography of the rural county is largely as it was in the Anglo-Saxon period. Later, Buckinghamshire became an important political arena, with [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] intervening in local politics in the 16th century and just a century later the [[English Civil War]] was reputedly started by [[John Hampden]] in mid-Bucks.<ref name=\"Biography of John Hampden\">{{cite web |url=http://www.johnhampden.org/ |title=Biography of John Hampden |publisher=Johnhampden.org |accessdate=19 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908134006/http://www.johnhampden.org/ |archive-date=8 September 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHistorically, the biggest change to the county came in the 19th century, when a combination of [[cholera]] and [[famine]] hit the rural county, forcing many to migrate to larger towns to find work. Not only did this alter the local economic situation, it meant a lot of land was going cheap at a time when the rich were more mobile and leafy Bucks became a popular rural idyll: an image it still has today. Buckinghamshire is a popular home for London commuters, leading to greater local affluence; however, some pockets of relative deprivation remain.<ref name=\"WLAP\">{{cite web|title=High Wycombe Local Community Area Profile |publisher=[[Buckinghamshire County Council]] |date=October 2008 |url=http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/assets/content/bcc/docs/research/area_profiles/Wycombe2008.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606165628/http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/assets/content/bcc/docs/research/area_profiles/Wycombe2008.pdf |archivedate=6 June 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe expansion of London and coming of the railways promoted the growth of towns in the south of the county such as Aylesbury, Amersham and High Wycombe, leaving the town Buckingham itself to the north in a relative backwater.<ref name=\"About Buckingham UoB\">{{cite web|title=About Buckingham|url=http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/about/history/town|website=University of Buckingham|accessdate=15 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910190131/http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/about/history/town|archive-date=10 September 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> As a result, most county institutions are now based in the south of the county or Milton Keynes, rather than in Buckingham.\n\n==Geography==\nThe county can be split into two sections geographically. The south leads from the [[River Thames]] up the gentle slopes of the [[Chiltern Hills]] to the more abrupt slopes on the northern side leading to the [[Vale of Aylesbury]] and the Borough of Milton Keynes, a large and relatively level expanse of land that is  the southern [[drainage basin|catchment]] of the [[River Great Ouse]].\n\n===Waterways===\n\n====Rivers====\nThe county includes parts of two of the four longest rivers in England. The [[River Thames]] forms the southern boundary with [[Berkshire]], which has crept over the border at [[Eton, Berkshire|Eton]] and [[Slough]] so that the river is no longer the sole boundary between the two counties. The River Great Ouse rises just outside the county in [[Northamptonshire]] and flows east through Buckingham, Milton Keynes and [[Olney, Buckinghamshire|Olney]].\n\n====Canals====\n[[File:Medmenham River Thames geograph-4090549-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|The River Thames at Medmenham]]\nThe main branch of the [[Grand Union Canal]] passes through the county as do its arms to [[Slough Arm|Slough]], [[Aylesbury Canal Society|Aylesbury]], [[Wendover Arm Canal|Wendover]] (disused) and [[Buckingham Arm|Buckingham]] (disused). The canal has been incorporated into the landscaping of Milton Keynes.\n\n===Landscape===\nThe southern part of the county is dominated by the Chiltern Hills. The two highest points in Buckinghamshire are [[Haddington Hill]] in Wendover Woods (a stone marks its summit) at {{convert|267|m|ft}} above sea level, and [[Coombe Hill, Buckinghamshire|Coombe Hill]] near [[Wendover]] at {{convert|260|m|ft}}.\n\n====Mineral extraction====\nQuarrying has taken place for chalk, clay for brickmaking and gravel and sand in the river valleys. Flint, also extracted from quarries, was often used to build older local buildings. Several former quarries, now flooded, have become nature reserves.<ref name=\"College Lake\">{{cite web|title=College Lake|url=http://www.bbowt.org.uk/college-lake/about-college-lake|publisher=BBOWT|accessdate=12 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024012611/http://www.bbowt.org.uk/college-lake/about-college-lake|archive-date=24 October 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Demography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Buckinghamshire districts\n|'''District'''\n|'''Main towns'''\n|'''Population (2011)'''<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-286262|title= 2011 Census: KS101EW Usual resident population, local authorities in England and Wales|access-date= 11 December 2012|archive-url= http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-286262|archive-date= 5 January 2016|url-status= live|df= dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n|'''Area'''\n|'''Population density (2011)'''\n|'''Population projection 2026'''\n|-\n\n|'''[[Buckinghamshire Council|Buckinghamshire]]'''||[[Aylesbury]], [[Buckingham]], [[High Wycombe]], [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]], [[Amersham]], [[Chesham]], [[Beaconsfield]], [[Burnham, Buckinghamshire|Burnham]]||505,283||1565&nbsp;km\u00b2||323/km\u00b2||530,800\n|-\n|'''[[Borough of Milton Keynes]]'''||[[Milton Keynes]], [[Newport Pagnell]]||248,821||308.63&nbsp;km\u00b2||806/km\u00b2||323,146<ref>{{cite web |url= http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk/webview/index.jsp?v=2&mode=cube&cube=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/fCube/PE097_C1&study=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/fStudy/PE097&context=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/cServer/MKi&top=yes |archive-url= https://archive.today/20120701155340/http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk/webview/index.jsp?v=2&mode=cube&cube=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/fCube/PE097_C1&study=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/fStudy/PE097&context=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/cServer/MKi&top=yes |url-status= dead |archive-date= 2012-07-01 |title= Milton Keynes intelligence Observatory }}</ref>\n|-\n|'''TOTAL Ceremonial'''||N/A||'''754,104'''||'''1874&nbsp;km\u00b2'''||'''402/km\u00b2'''||'''853,946'''\n|}\n[[File:CheshamPondParkView.jpg|thumb|Suburban housing, Chesham]]\n\nBuckinghamshire is sub-divided into civil parishes.\n\n<!--The info here can easily be sourced from Census data.

There were four district councils that are subsidiary to the county council: Aylesbury Vale, Chiltern, [[South Bucks]] and Wycombe districts.\n\nThe [[Buckinghamshire County Council|county council]] was founded in 1889 with its base in new municipal buildings in Walton Street, Aylesbury (which are still there). In Buckinghamshire, local administration was run on a two-tier system where public services were split between the county council and a number of district councils.\n\nIn 1966 the council moved into new premises: a 15-storey tower block in the centre of Aylesbury (pictured) designed by county architect [[Fred Pooley]]. It is now a Grade II [[listed building]].\n\nIn 1997 the northernmost<ref>The part of Buckinghamshire north of the [[Varsity Line]] together with [[Bow Brickhill]], [[Woburn Sands]] and parts of [[Bletchley and Fenny Stratford]].</ref> part of Buckinghamshire, then Milton Keynes District, was separated to form a unitary authority, the Borough of Milton Keynes; for ceremonial purposes Milton Keynes remains part of Buckinghamshire.<ref>{{Cite legislation UK \n  | type = act\n  | year = 1997\n  | chapter = 23\n  | act = Lieutenancies Act 1997\n}}</ref>\n\nBuckinghamshire County Council was a large employer in the county and provided a variety of services, including education (schools, adult education and youth services), social services, highways, libraries, County Archives and Record Office, the [[Buckinghamshire County Museum|County Museum]] and the [[Roald Dahl Children's Gallery]] in Aylesbury, consumer services and some aspects of waste disposal and planning.\n\n===Buckinghamshire Council (2020 onwards) ===\n[[Buckinghamshire Council]] is a unitary authority covering most of the ceremonial county of Buckinghamshire.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bucks County Council takes final curtain call after 131 years |url=https://www.bucksherald.co.uk/news/politics/council/bucks-county-council-takes-final-curtain-call-after-131-years-2451714 |website=Bucks Herald |accessdate=28 March 2020 |date=16 March 2020}}</ref> It was created in April 2020 from the areas that were previously administered by [[Buckinghamshire County Council]] and districts of [[South Bucks]], [[Chiltern District|Chiltern]], [[Wycombe District|Wycombe]], [[Aylesbury Vale]]. \n\n===Milton Keynes Council===\n[[Milton Keynes Council]] was formed by the Local Government Act 1972 as the Milton Keynes District Council, subordinate to Buckinghamshire County Council.

That the swan is in chains illustrates that [[Swan upping|the swan is bound to the monarch]], an ancient law that still applies to wild swans in the UK today. The arms were first borne at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] by the [[Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]].\n\nAbove the swan is a gold band, in the centre of which is [[Whiteleaf Cross]], representing the many ancient landmarks of the county. The shield is surmounted by a [[beech]] tree, representing the [[Chiltern Forest]] that once covered almost half the county. Either side of the shield are a [[Deer|buck]], for Buckingham, and a swan, the county symbol.\n\nThe motto of the shield is ''Vestigia Nulla Retrorsum''.

Development in this region is restricted by the [[Metropolitan Green Belt]]. Other large settlements include the county town of [[Aylesbury]], [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]] in the south near the [[River Thames|Thames]] and [[Princes Risborough]] in the west near Oxford. Some areas without direct rail links to London, such as around the old county town of [[Buckingham]] and near [[Olney, Buckinghamshire|Olney]] in the northeast, are much less populous. The largest town is [[Milton Keynes]] in the northeast, which with the surrounding area is administered as a [[Borough of Milton Keynes|unitary authority]] separately to the rest of Buckinghamshire. The remainder of the county is administered by [[Buckinghamshire Council]] as another unitary authority. In national elections, Buckinghamshire is considered a reliable supporter of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].\n\nA large part of the [[Chiltern Hills]], an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]], runs through the south of the county and attracts many walkers and cyclists from London. In this area older buildings are often made from local flint and red brick. Many parts of the county are quite affluent and like many areas around London this has led to high housing costs: several reports have identified the market town of [[Beaconsfield]] as having among the highest property prices outside London.<ref name=\"Beaconsfield cost\">{{cite web|last1=Spence|first1=Graham|title=Beaconsfield is the most expensive market town in England|url=http://www.getbucks.co.uk/news/local-news/beaconsfield-most-expensive-market-town-8257800|website=Get Bucks|accessdate=15 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222103912/http://www.getbucks.co.uk/news/local-news/beaconsfield-most-expensive-market-town-8257800|archive-date=22 December 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How expensive are the houses in your street?

To the north of the county lies rolling countryside in the [[Vale of Aylesbury]] and around the [[River Great Ouse|Great Ouse]]. The [[River Thames|Thames]] forms part of the county's southwestern boundary. Notable service amenities in the county are [[Pinewood Film Studios]], [[Dorney Lake|Dorney rowing lake]] and part of [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone race track]] on the Northamptonshire border. Many national companies have head-offices or major centres in Milton Keynes. Heavy industry and quarrying is limited, with agriculture predominating after service industries.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Buckinghamshire}}\n[[File:Buckingham-215x334.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Bucks (1904)]]\n\nThe name Buckinghamshire is [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] in origin and means ''The district (scire) of Bucca's home''. ''Bucca's home'' refers to [[Buckingham]] in the north of the county, and is named after an Anglo-Saxon landowner. The county has been so named since about the 12th century; however, the county has existed since it was a subdivision of the kingdom of [[Mercia]] (585\u2013919).\n\nThe history of the area predates the Anglo-Saxon period and the county has a rich history starting from the [[Celt]]ic and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] periods, though the Anglo-Saxons perhaps had the greatest impact on Buckinghamshire: the geography of the rural county is largely as it was in the Anglo-Saxon period.

Not only did this alter the local economic situation, it meant a lot of land was going cheap at a time when the rich were more mobile and leafy Bucks became a popular rural idyll: an image it still has today.

The south leads from the [[River Thames]] up the gentle slopes of the [[Chiltern Hills]] to the more abrupt slopes on the northern side leading to the [[Vale of Aylesbury]] and the Borough of Milton Keynes, a large and relatively level expanse of land that is  the southern [[drainage basin|catchment]] of the [[River Great Ouse]].\n\n===Waterways===\n\n====Rivers====\nThe county includes parts of two of the four longest rivers in England. The [[River Thames]] forms the southern boundary with [[Berkshire]], which has crept over the border at [[Eton, Berkshire|Eton]] and [[Slough]] so that the river is no longer the sole boundary between the two counties. The River Great Ouse rises just outside the county in [[Northamptonshire]] and flows east through Buckingham, Milton Keynes and [[Olney, Buckinghamshire|Olney]].\n\n====Canals====\n[[File:Medmenham River Thames geograph-4090549-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|The River Thames at Medmenham]]\nThe main branch of the [[Grand Union Canal]] passes through the county as do its arms to [[Slough Arm|Slough]], [[Aylesbury Canal Society|Aylesbury]], [[Wendover Arm Canal|Wendover]] (disused) and [[Buckingham Arm|Buckingham]] (disused). The canal has been incorporated into the landscaping of Milton Keynes.\n\n===Landscape===\nThe southern part of the county is dominated by the Chiltern Hills. The two highest points in Buckinghamshire are [[Haddington Hill]] in Wendover Woods (a stone marks its summit) at {{convert|267|m|ft}} above sea level, and [[Coombe Hill, Buckinghamshire|Coombe Hill]] near [[Wendover]] at {{convert|260|m|ft}}.\n\n====Mineral extraction====\nQuarrying has taken place for chalk, clay for brickmaking and gravel and sand in the river valleys. Flint, also extracted from quarries, was often used to build older local buildings. Several former quarries, now flooded, have become nature reserves.<ref name=\"College Lake\">{{cite web|title=College Lake|url=http://www.bbowt.org.uk/college-lake/about-college-lake|publisher=BBOWT|accessdate=12 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024012611/http://www.bbowt.org.uk/college-lake/about-college-lake|archive-date=24 October 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Demography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Buckinghamshire districts\n|'''District'''\n|'''Main towns'''\n|'''Population (2011)'''<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-286262|title= 2011 Census: KS101EW Usual resident population, local authorities in England and Wales|access-date= 11 December 2012|archive-url= http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-286262|archive-date= 5 January 2016|url-status= live|df= dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n|'''Area'''\n|'''Population density (2011)'''\n|'''Population projection 2026'''\n|-\n\n|'''[[Buckinghamshire Council|Buckinghamshire]]'''||[[Aylesbury]], [[Buckingham]], [[High Wycombe]], [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]], [[Amersham]], [[Chesham]], [[Beaconsfield]], [[Burnham, Buckinghamshire|Burnham]]||505,283||1565&nbsp;km\u00b2||323/km\u00b2||530,800\n|-\n|'''[[Borough of Milton Keynes]]'''||[[Milton Keynes]], [[Newport Pagnell]]||248,821||308.63&nbsp;km\u00b2||806/km\u00b2||323,146<ref>{{cite web |url= http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk/webview/index.jsp?v=2&mode=cube&cube=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/fCube/PE097_C1&study=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/fStudy/PE097&context=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/cServer/MKi&top=yes |archive-url= https://archive.today/20120701155340/http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk/webview/index.jsp?v=2&mode=cube&cube=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/fCube/PE097_C1&study=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/fStudy/PE097&context=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/cServer/MKi&top=yes |url-status= dead |archive-date= 2012-07-01 |title= Milton Keynes intelligence Observatory }}</ref>\n|-\n|'''TOTAL Ceremonial'''||N/A||'''754,104'''||'''1874&nbsp;km\u00b2'''||'''402/km\u00b2'''||'''853,946'''\n|}\n[[File:CheshamPondParkView.jpg|thumb|Suburban housing, Chesham]]\n\nBuckinghamshire is sub-divided into civil parishes.\n\n<!--The info here can easily be sourced from Census data.

There were four district councils that are subsidiary to the county council: Aylesbury Vale, Chiltern, [[South Bucks]] and Wycombe districts.\n\nThe [[Buckinghamshire County Council|county council]] was founded in 1889 with its base in new municipal buildings in Walton Street, Aylesbury (which are still there). In Buckinghamshire, local administration was run on a two-tier system where public services were split between the county council and a number of district councils.\n\nIn 1966 the council moved into new premises: a 15-storey tower block in the centre of Aylesbury (pictured) designed by county architect [[Fred Pooley]].

That the swan is in chains illustrates that [[Swan upping|the swan is bound to the monarch]], an ancient law that still applies to wild swans in the UK today. The arms were first borne at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] by the [[Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]].\n\nAbove the swan is a gold band, in the centre of which is [[Whiteleaf Cross]], representing the many ancient landmarks of the county. The shield is surmounted by a [[beech]] tree, representing the [[Chiltern Forest]] that once covered almost half the county. Either side of the shield are a [[Deer|buck]], for Buckingham, and a swan, the county symbol.\n\nThe motto of the shield is ''Vestigia Nulla Retrorsum''.

Buckinghamshire Council is one of the few remaining [[Local Education Authority|LEA]]s still using the [[Tripartite system of education in England, Wales and Northern Ireland|tripartite system]], albeit with some revisions such as the abolition of [[secondary technical school]]s. It has a completely selective education system: pupils transfer either to a [[grammar school]] or to a [[secondary modern school]] or [[Free school (England)|free school]] depending on how they perform in the [[Eleven-Plus exam]] and on their preferences. Pupils who do not take the test can only be allocated places at secondary modern schools or free school. There are 9 independent schools and 34 maintained (state) secondary schools, not including [[sixth form college]]s, in the county council area. There is also the [[Buckinghamshire University Technical College]] which offers secondary education from age 14. The unitary authority of Milton Keynes operates a [[comprehensive education]] system: there are 8 maintained (state) secondary schools in the borough council area.\n\nBuckinghamshire is also home to the [[University of Buckingham]], [[Buckinghamshire New University]], the [[National Film and Television School]], the [[Open University]] and the [[University Campus Milton Keynes]].\n\n==Notable people==\n[[File:John Milton's cottage.jpg|thumb|John Milton's cottage, Chalfont]]\n[[File:House from rear (9058754955).jpg|thumb|[[Cliveden]]]]\n[[File:Buckingham Church - geograph.org.uk - 715502.jpg|thumb|Buckingham church seen from across the [[River Great Ouse|Ouse]]]]\nBuckinghamshire is the birthplace and/or final resting place of several notable individuals.
