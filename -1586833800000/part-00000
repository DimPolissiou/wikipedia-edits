Formed and initially commanded by Colonel [[Albert Rust]], and later falling under the command of Colonel [[Van. H. Manning]], the regiment was part of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]], serving under General [[Robert E. Lee]]. The 3rd Arkansas Infantry Regiment served for the duration of the war, from the late months of 1861, through to its surrender at [[Appomattox Campaign|Appomattox Court House]] in 1865. It was the only regiment from the state of [[Arkansas]] to serve the entire war in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]], where most of the major Civil War battles were fought. It was also the only Arkansas regiment to initially sign up for the duration of the Civil War, with all other regiments from the state signing on for a one-year [[Military service|enlistment]].<ref name=\"couchgenweb1\"/>\n\n== Formation ==\n[[File:Colonel Van H. Manning, Commander, 3rd Arkansas Infantry Regiment.jpg|thumb|'''Colonel Van. H. Manning'''<br />photographed in the early 1860s]]\nThe regiment was formed in May and June 1861, initially by Dr. [[William H. Tebbs|W. H. Tebbs]], who would be appointed a [[Captain (United States)|captain]], and Van. H. Manning who would later command the regiment. Early in May, 1861, Dr. W. H. Tebbs, Captain of a volunteer company raised on Bayou Bartholomew, in Ashley county, and Captain Van. H. Manning, the captain of a company organized at Hamburg, in Ashley County, went to Vicksburg, Mississippi, in order to tender the services of their two companies, for service in the Confederate Army. They contacted [[Leroy P. Walker]], Confederate Secretary of War, at Montgomery, by telegraph and received his reply declining the offer of the two companies, separate from a regiment. They then went to Montgomery, and Manning enlisted the help of Arkansas Confederate Senator Albert Rust. Rust help gain the acceptance as a part of the Confederate Army, conditioned on his raising the remaining companies needed to form a regiment. Rust, returned to Arkansas, and organized nine additional companies, and joined Captain Tebbs and Capt Manning in Virginia, where the regiment was mustered into service for the period of the war. The addition of nine companies made eleven when the regiment was organized. Tebbs' Company and Captain Mannings' were perhaps the first and only companies denied admission into the Confederate service, even for a day, and were the first companies enlisted for the war.<ref name=\"archive1\"/> When organized, the regiment was composed of 11 companies:<ref name=\"couchgenweb1\"/>\n\n* Company A \u2014 \"The Arkansas Travelers\", commanded by Captain W.

The fledgling company had only gathered 33 volunteers, only a third of that needed to constitute a full company. Two companies of Arkansas volunteers from Ashley county, passing through Nashville, Tennessee, on their way to Virginia to form the Third Arkansas Infantry, met Samuel V. Reid, of Kentucky, who had brought 30 of his fellow Kentuckians down to Tennessee, looking for a regiment to attach themselves to. It was proposed that the two groups of volunteers join forces to fit out a full company for the Third Arkansas. The commissioned and non-commissioned officer appointments would be equally divided among the two groups, with Reid becoming captain and Gibson becoming First Lieutenant. Accordingly, the Kentuckians enlisted at Nashville on June 10; the Arkansawyers enlisted at Tyro on June 15; and the new company traveled to Lynchburg, Virginia, where it was assigned to the Third Regiment, Arkansas Volunteers, as Company H, July 1861. Colonel Albert Rust, regimental commander, referred to the company as \"my orphans\", a name which the men adopted as \"The Orphan Company\". In keeping with its cosmopolitan nature, Company H also recruited quite a few Virginians during the war. During its four years of service, 116 men served in Company H, only nine of them remained when the company was surrendered at Appomattox Court House.<ref>Howerton, Bryan, \"Third Arkansas Infantry Regiment, CSA, Company A\", Edward G.

On July 18, 1862, thirty members of disbanded Company B, Second Arkansas Infantry Battalion, were assigned to this company. Company I was the only company in the Third Arkansas that made significant use of conscripts to reinforce its ranks. In March 1863, thirty farmers and furloughed soldiers from other regiments were conscripted at Camden, Arkansas, and sent to the company in Virginia. During its four years of service, 150 men served in Company I. Only thirteen of them remained when the company was surrendered at Appomattox Court House.<ref>Howerton, Bryan, \"Third Arkansas Infantry Regiment, CSA, Company I\", Edward G.

Bell organized at Latonia, Ashley county (later consolidated with Company A). On September 25, 1862, the company was disbanded.  Forty-two of its members were transferred to company A\u2014also from Ashley county. A total of seventy-three men were carried on the rolls of Company L during its existence.

While in [[Virginia]], command level officers with formal military training were assigned to the regiment, to include [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] graduate [[Seth Barton|Seth. M. Barton]] who was assigned as [[Lieutenant colonel|Lieutenant-Colonel]], and with [[Virginia Military Institute]] graduate Thomas Middleton Semmes assigned as regimental adjutant.<ref name=\"archive1\"/> The regiment was then attached to General Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, and deployed to the area of what would soon after become [[West Virginia]]. By mid-1862, the regiment was under the command of Van. Manning following Albert Rust's promotion to [[Brigadier general|Brigadier-General]], with [[William H. Tebbs]] being promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel.<ref name=\"couchgenweb1\"/>\n\n== Battle actions ==\nFrom its induction into the Confederate Army, the Third Arkansas would go on to become one of the most distinguished and well respected Confederate regiments of the war. However, prior to their first battle actions, the first impressions of them by their fellow Confederates were, by written accounts since, not good. In several accounts, relayed by [[author]] and [[historian]] Mauriel P. Joslyn, the regiment was first seen as a poorly dressed and poorly equipped lot of ignorant country boys.<ref>Collier, Calvin L. ''They'll Do to Tie To! - The Story of the Third Regiment, Arkansas Infantry, C.S.A.'', Little Rock, AR, CWRT Associates, 1988, reprint of 1959 ed. page 20. E553.5.3rd.C65</ref> Once proven in combat, however, those opinions of them would change dramatically.<ref name=autogenerated2>Howerton Bryan R. \"Third Arkansas Infantry Regiment, CSA, A Brief History \", Edward G. Gerdes Civil War Page, Accessed 21 March 2012, http://www.couchgenweb.com/civilwar/3rd-his.html</ref>\n\nThe regiment was ordered to the mountains of West Virginia, where it performed arduous and discouraging service in the campaign on the Gauley and Cheat rivers.<ref name=\"Arkansas Confederate Regimental Histories\"/> The regiment was engaged in the battles of Greenbrier and Allegheny. This was followed by hard marching under Stonewall Jackson (whom Col Rust later described as \"an impracticable old schoolmaster who said grace before he ate and prayed before going to bed\") in the Valley Campaign. Under General Jackson at Winchester, in January, 1862, the Third Arkansas marched to Bath and Romney, returned to Winchester, and was ordered thence to Fredericksburg and assigned to the brigade of Gen. Theophilus H. Holmes. Colonel Rust was promoted to Brigadier-General about this time, and was transferred to a command in the western armies. Van. Manning was promoted to the Colonel of the regiment succeeding Rust.<ref name=\"Arkansas Confederate Regimental Histories\"/>\n\nThe Third Arkansas was engaged in the battles of White Oak Swamp, June 3, 1862, in J.G. Walker's brigade, on July 1, 1862, participated in the battle of Malvern Hill.<ref name=\"Arkansas Confederate Regimental Histories\"/>\n\nIn July, 1862, the ranks of the Third Arkansas was augmented by the addition of nearly 140 soldiers from the [[2nd Arkansas Infantry Battalion]]. The Second Arkansas Battalion had been organized in October, 1861, from three companies of volunteers from El Dorado, Hot Springs and Pine Bluff. In June, 1862, the 2nd Arkansas Battalion was decimated while leading an assault on the Federal position at [[Battle of Beaver Dam Creek|Beaver Dam Creek]], and its commander, Major William Naylor Bronaugh, mortally wounded.<ref name=autogenerated1>Downey, Brian. \"Confederate Regiment 3rd Arkansas Infantry\", Antietam on the Web, Accessed 21 March 2012, http://antietam.aotw.org/officers.php?unit_id=656</ref> The War Department disbanded the battalion and transferred its survivors to the Third Arkansas.<ref>Howerton, Bryan R., \"Second Arkansas Infantry Battalion, CSA\", Edward G. Gerdes Civil War Page, Accessed 23 November 2011 http://www.couchgenweb.com/civilwar/2ndbnhis.html</ref>\n\nOn September 17, 1862, at the [[Battle of Antietam]], Companies A and L of the Third Arkansas were decimated. On September 25 the few survivors of Company L were transferred into Company A and Company L ceased to exist. Thus the regiment was reduced to ten companies, the normal complement for an infantry regiment.<ref name=autogenerated1/> Col. Manning was seriously wounded during the battle.<ref name=\"Arkansas Confederate Regimental Histories\"/>\n\nIn November, 1862, the Third Arkansas was assigned to the famous [[Texas Brigade]] of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. The Confederate War Department had determined that the troops would benefit from being brigaded with regiments from their home States. At this time, the standard brigade organization consisted of four regiments. There were three Texas regiments in the Army\u2014the 1st, 4th and 5th\u2014and only one Arkansas regiment. It was therefore decided to group these four western regiments together. The Third Arkansas remained an integral part of Hood's Texas Brigade until the end of the war.<ref name=autogenerated2/> The first engagement that the unit participated in as part of the Texas Brigade was the Battle of Fredericksburg in December, 1862.<ref name=\"Arkansas Confederate Regimental Histories\"/> The regiment was not engaged at Chancellorsville, being detached with the rest of Longstreet's Corps at Suffolk.<ref name=\"Arkansas Confederate Regimental Histories\"/>\n\nThe Third Arkansas acquired a reputation as tenacious fighters, often finding themselves in the thickest fighting on the battlefield, such as their presence at the \"sunken road\" during the Battle of Antietam. Their most famous action was while serving as a part of the Texas Brigade during the Battle of Gettysburg, at the [[Devil's Den]], where they took heavy casualties while serving under General [[John Bell Hood]]. Its place in the front of Hood's assault meant it was one of the first units, if not the first, to be heavily engaged during the second day of the battle.

Formed and initially commanded by Colonel [[Albert Rust]], and later falling under the command of Colonel [[Van. H. Manning]], the regiment was part of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]], serving under General [[Robert E. Lee]]. The 3rd Arkansas Infantry Regiment served for the duration of the war, from the late months of 1861, through to its surrender at [[Appomattox Campaign|Appomattox Court House]] in 1865. It was the only regiment from the state of [[Arkansas]] to serve the entire war in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]], where most of the major Civil War battles were fought. It was also the only Arkansas regiment to initially sign up for the duration of the Civil War, with all other regiments from the state signing on for a one-year [[Military service|enlistment]].<ref name=\"couchgenweb1\"/>\n\n== Formation ==\n[[File:Colonel Van H. Manning, Commander, 3rd Arkansas Infantry Regiment.jpg|thumb|'''Colonel Van. H. Manning'''<br />photographed in the early 1860s]]\nThe regiment was formed in May and June 1861, initially by Dr. [[William H. Tebbs|W. H. Tebbs]], who would be appointed a [[Captain (United States)|captain]], and Van. H. Manning who would later command the regiment. Early in May, 1861, Dr. W. H. Tebbs, Captain of a volunteer company raised on Bayou Bartholomew, in Ashley county, and Captain Van. H. Manning, the captain of a company organized at Hamburg, in Ashley County, went to Vicksburg, Mississippi, in order to tender the services of their two companies, for service in the Confederate Army. They contacted [[Leroy P. Walker]], Confederate Secretary of War, at Montgomery, by telegraph and received his reply declining the offer of the two companies, separate from a regiment. They then went to Montgomery, and Manning enlisted the help of Arkansas Confederate Senator Albert Rust. Rust help gain the acceptance as a part of the Confederate Army, conditioned on his raising the remaining companies needed to form a regiment. Rust, returned to Arkansas, and organized nine additional companies, and joined Captain Tebbs and Capt Manning in Virginia, where the regiment was mustered into service for the period of the war. The addition of nine companies made eleven when the regiment was organized. Tebbs' Company and Captain Mannings' were perhaps the first and only companies denied admission into the Confederate service, even for a day, and were the first companies enlisted for the war.<ref name=\"archive1\"/> When organized, the regiment was composed of 11 companies:<ref name=\"couchgenweb1\"/>\n\n* Company A \u2014 \"The Arkansas Travelers\", commanded by Captain W.

The fledgling company had only gathered 33 volunteers, only a third of that needed to constitute a full company. Two companies of Arkansas volunteers from Ashley county, passing through Nashville, Tennessee, on their way to Virginia to form the Third Arkansas Infantry, met Samuel V. Reid, of Kentucky, who had brought 30 of his fellow Kentuckians down to Tennessee, looking for a regiment to attach themselves to. It was proposed that the two groups of volunteers join forces to fit out a full company for the Third Arkansas. The commissioned and non-commissioned officer appointments would be equally divided among the two groups, with Reid becoming captain and Gibson becoming First Lieutenant. Accordingly, the Kentuckians enlisted at Nashville on June 10; the Arkansawyers enlisted at Tyro on June 15; and the new company traveled to Lynchburg, Virginia, where it was assigned to the Third Regiment, Arkansas Volunteers, as Company H, July 1861. Colonel Albert Rust, regimental commander, referred to the company as \"my orphans\", a name which the men adopted as \"The Orphan Company\". In keeping with its cosmopolitan nature, Company H also recruited quite a few Virginians during the war. During its four years of service, 116 men served in Company H, only nine of them remained when the company was surrendered at Appomattox Court House.<ref>Howerton, Bryan, \"Third Arkansas Infantry Regiment, CSA, Company A\", Edward G.

This was followed by hard marching under Stonewall Jackson (whom Col Rust later described as \"an impracticable old schoolmaster who said grace before he ate and prayed before going to bed\") in the Valley Campaign. Under General Jackson at Winchester, in January, 1862, the Third Arkansas marched to Bath and Romney, returned to Winchester, and was ordered thence to Fredericksburg and assigned to the brigade of Gen. Theophilus H. Holmes. Colonel Rust was promoted to Brigadier-General about this time, and was transferred to a command in the western armies. Van. Manning was promoted to the Colonel of the regiment succeeding Rust.<ref name=\"Arkansas Confederate Regimental Histories\"/>\n\nThe Third Arkansas was engaged in the battles of White Oak Swamp, June 3, 1862, in J.G. Walker's brigade, on July 1, 1862, participated in the battle of Malvern Hill.<ref name=\"Arkansas Confederate Regimental Histories\"/>\n\nIn July, 1862, the ranks of the Third Arkansas was augmented by the addition of nearly 140 soldiers from the [[2nd Arkansas Infantry Battalion]]. The Second Arkansas Battalion had been organized in October, 1861, from three companies of volunteers from El Dorado, Hot Springs and Pine Bluff. In June, 1862, the 2nd Arkansas Battalion was decimated while leading an assault on the Federal position at [[Battle of Beaver Dam Creek|Beaver Dam Creek]], and its commander, Major William Naylor Bronaugh, mortally wounded.<ref name=autogenerated1>Downey, Brian. \"Confederate Regiment 3rd Arkansas Infantry\", Antietam on the Web, Accessed 21 March 2012, http://antietam.aotw.org/officers.php?unit_id=656</ref> The War Department disbanded the battalion and transferred its survivors to the Third Arkansas.<ref>Howerton, Bryan R., \"Second Arkansas Infantry Battalion, CSA\", Edward G. Gerdes Civil War Page, Accessed 23 November 2011 http://www.couchgenweb.com/civilwar/2ndbnhis.html</ref>\n\nOn September 17, 1862, at the [[Battle of Antietam]], Companies A and L of the Third Arkansas were decimated. On September 25 the few survivors of Company L were transferred into Company A and Company L ceased to exist. Thus the regiment was reduced to ten companies, the normal complement for an infantry regiment.<ref name=autogenerated1/> Col. Manning was seriously wounded during the battle.<ref name=\"Arkansas Confederate Regimental Histories\"/>\n\nIn November, 1862, the Third Arkansas was assigned to the famous [[Texas Brigade]] of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. The Confederate War Department had determined that the troops would benefit from being brigaded with regiments from their home States. At this time, the standard brigade organization consisted of four regiments. There were three Texas regiments in the Army\u2014the 1st, 4th and 5th\u2014and only one Arkansas regiment. It was therefore decided to group these four western regiments together. The Third Arkansas remained an integral part of Hood's Texas Brigade until the end of the war.<ref name=autogenerated2/> The first engagement that the unit participated in as part of the Texas Brigade was the Battle of Fredericksburg in December, 1862.<ref name=\"Arkansas Confederate Regimental Histories\"/> The regiment was not engaged at Chancellorsville, being detached with the rest of Longstreet's Corps at Suffolk.<ref name=\"Arkansas Confederate Regimental Histories\"/>\n\nThe Third Arkansas acquired a reputation as tenacious fighters, often finding themselves in the thickest fighting on the battlefield, such as their presence at the \"sunken road\" during the Battle of Antietam. Their most famous action was while serving as a part of the Texas Brigade during the Battle of Gettysburg, at the [[Devil's Den]], where they took heavy casualties while serving under General [[John Bell Hood]]. Its place in the front of Hood's assault meant it was one of the first units, if not the first, to be heavily engaged during the second day of the battle. The regiment was commended for gallantry in that action, while under the direct command of Brigadier General [[Jerome B. Robertson]], fighting in and in the vicinity of the \"Devil's Den\".<ref>Joslyn, Mauriel P., For Ninety Nine Years or the War\".</ref>\n\nThe regiment was transferred with Longstreet's Corps to [[Tennessee]] in September, 1863 in time to fight at the Battle of Chickamauga (where Major Reedy was mortally wounded).  The unit went on to participate in the battles of Chattanooga, Wauhatchie, and in the siege of Knoxville, Tennessee, returning to the Army of Northern Virginia in the spring of 1864.<ref name=\"Arkansas Confederate Regimental Histories\"/>\n\nThe regiment suffered heavy casualties later in the Battle of the Wilderness, during which they lost many of their commanding officers in addition to heavy losses in their ranks. In that battle they lost Colonel Van. H. Manning and Lieutenant-Colonel Robert S. Taylor, both of whom were badly wounded and captured, in addition to Major William K. Wilkins who was killed in action.<ref name=\"Arkansas Confederate Regimental Histories\"/>\n\nThe regiment continue the fight at Spotsylvania, and on to Cold Harbor. The regiment was at Deep Run on August 6, 1864; at Petersburg during the siege by Grant, at High Bridge and Farmville during the closing day of the war in 1865.<ref name=\"Arkansas Confederate Regimental Histories\"/>\n\nBy the end of the war, the [[Texas Brigade]] as a whole, which included the 1st, 4th, and 5th Texas, and the Third Arkansas, had only 617 men remaining out of a total of 5,353.

The Old State House Museum, Little Rock, identifies this flag as an artillery guidon. The flag was donated to the Old State House Museum by the family of Private R. Jessie Bailey, 3rd Arkansas Infantry, regimental band. The flag was allegedly made for the unit by the ladies of Fredericksburg, Virginia, while the regiment was stationed there in the winter of 1862. It is likely that regimental color bearer James M. Johnson was killed while carrying this flag at the Battle of Chickamauga, 19 September 1863. The flag, an Army of Northern Virginia Battle Flag, is {{frac|35|1|2}} inches \u00d7 {{frac|35|1|2}} inches square; orange border; 5-inch stripe of the St. Andrew's cross; and thirteen stars made of bunting and cotton with a canvas lead.<ref>Civil War Battle Flags, St. Andrew's Cross, Old State House Museum, Accessed 16 February 2011. http://www.oldstatehouse.com/collections/flags/flagDetail.asp?g=2&img=1{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe third flag carried by the Third Arkansas is an Army of Northern Virginia Battle Flag pattern made of bunting and cotton with canvas lead, 47 inches \u00d7 46 inches.

The flag was issued to the unit on September 20, 1863, on the field of Chickamauga, and was probably carried until approximately 1 January 1865. Private Spencer Young, who was wounded carrying the flag in the Battle of the Wilderness, saved the flag and carried it back to the state. It remained in his custody until donated to the Old State House Museum, Little Rock in the 1920s.<ref>Dedmondt, Glenn \"The Flags Of Civil War Arkansas\", (Pelican Publishing Co., 2009). {{ISBN|978-1-58980-190-5}}, page 73</ref>\n\nThe fourth and final flag of the Third Arkansas was a Richmond Depot 4th Bunting issue flag which is currently in the collections of the [[Museum of the Confederacy]], in [[Richmond, Virginia]].
