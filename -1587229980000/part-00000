Popularly listed as one of the \"[[Four Great Inventions]]\" of [[China]], it was discovered during the late [[Tang dynasty]] (9th century) but [[Wujing Zongyao|the earliest record]] of a written formula appeared in the [[Song dynasty]] (11th century). Knowledge of gunpowder spread rapidly throughout Asia, the Middle East and Europe, possibly as a result of the [[Mongol conquests]] during the 13th century, with written formula for it appearing in the 1267 \n''[[Opus Majus]]'' treatise by [[Roger Bacon]] and a 1280 treatise by [[Hasan al-Rammah]]. It was employed in warfare to some effect from at least the 10th century in weapons such as [[fire arrow]]s, [[bomb]]s, and the [[fire lance]] before the appearance of the [[gun]]. While the fire lance was eventually supplanted by the gun, other gunpowder weapons such as rockets and fire arrows continued to see use in China, Korea, India, and eventually Europe. Bombs too never ceased to develop and continued to progress into the modern day as [[grenades]], [[Land mine|mine]]s, and other explosive implements. Gunpowder has also been used for non-military purposes such as [[firework]]s for entertainment, or in explosives for [[mining]] and [[tunnel]]ing.\n\nThe evolution of [[guns]] led to the development of [[artillery]] during the 15th century, pioneered by states such as the [[Duchy of Burgundy]]. [[Firearms]] came to dominate [[early modern warfare]] in [[Military history of Europe|Europe]] by the 17th century. The gradual improvement of [[cannon]]s firing heavier rounds for a greater impact against fortifications led to the invention of the [[star fort]] and the [[bastion]] in the [[Western world]], where traditional [[city walls]] and [[castle]]s were no longer suitable for defense. The use of gunpowder technology also spread throughout [[Gunpowder Empires|the Islamic world]] and to [[Military history of India|India]], [[Military history of Korea|Korea]], and [[Military history of Japan|Japan]]. The so-called [[Gunpowder Empires]] of the [[early modern period]] consisted of the [[Mughal Empire]], [[Safavid Empire]], and [[Ottoman Empire]].{{Verification needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nThe use of gunpowder in warfare during the course of the 19th century diminished due to the invention of [[smokeless powder]]. Gunpowder is often referred to today as \"[[black powder]]\" to distinguish it from the propellant used in contemporary firearms.{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=18}}\n\n==Chinese beginnings==\n\n[[File:Chinese Bird with Incendiary.JPG|thumb|An expendable bird carrying an incendiary receptacle round its neck.

He described a mixture of three powders that would \"fly and dance\" violently in his ''[[Cantong qi]]'', otherwise known as the ''Book of the Kinship of Three'', a [[Taoist]] text on the subject of alchemy.<ref name=\"WB1\">{{cite web|title=History of Gunpowder|url=https://epicfireworks.com/history-of-gunpowder|accessdate=14 October 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Wei Boyang\">{{cite web|last1=Acosta|first1=Oscar|title=American Firearms Gun History|url=http://www.americanfirearms.org/gun-history/|website=www.americanfirearms.org|publisher=www.americanfirearms.org|accessdate=30 October 2015|ref=AFI}}</ref> Although it is impossible to know if he was actually referring to gunpowder, no other explosive known to scientists is composed of three powders.<ref name =WB1 /> \n\nWhile it was almost certainly not their intention to create a weapon of war, Taoist alchemists continued to play a major role in gunpowder development due to their experiments with [[sulfur]] and [[saltpeter]] involved in searching for eternal life and ways to transmute one material into another.<ref name=WB1 />{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=32}} Historian Peter Lorge notes that despite the early association of gunpowder with Taoism, this may be a quirk of historiography and a result of the better preservation of texts associated with Taoism, rather than being a subject limited to only Taoists.{{sfn|2008|p=32}} The Taoist quest for the elixir of life attracted many powerful patrons, one of whom was [[Emperor Wu of Han]]. One of the resulting alchemical experiments involved heating 10% sulfur and 75% saltpeter to transform them.<ref name=WB1 />\n\nThe next reference to gunpowder occurred in the year 300 during the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)]].<ref name=\"Wei Boyang\"/> A Taoist philosopher by the name of [[Ge Hong]] wrote down the ingredients of gunpowder in his surviving works, collectively known as the ''[[Baopuzi]]'' (\"The Master Who Embraces Simplicity\"). The \"Inner Chapters\" on Taoism contains records of his experiments with heated saltpeter, pine resin, and [[charcoal]] among other carbon materials, resulting in explosion, which most historians acknowledge as an early form of gunpowder.<ref name=\"explosive\">{{cite web|title=The Explosive Quest for Immortality|url=http://scribol.com/anthropology-and-history/history/the-explosive-quest-for-immortality/|accessdate=14 October 2016|date=2010-01-15}}</ref> In 492, Taoist alchemists noted that saltpeter, one of the most important ingredients in gunpowder, burns with a purple flame, allowing for practical efforts at purifying the substance.{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=97}}\n\nThe first confirmed reference to what can be considered gunpowder in China occurred more than three hundred years later during the Tang dynasty, first in a formula contained in the ''Taishang Shengzu Jindan Mijue'' (\u592a\u4e0a\u8056\u7956\u91d1\u4e39\u79d8\u8a23) in 808, and then about 50 years later in a Taoist text known as the ''Zhenyuan miaodao yaol\u00fce'' (\u771f\u5143\u5999\u9053\u8981\u7565).{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=32}} The first formula was a combination of six parts sulfur to six parts saltpeter to one part birthwort herb. The Taoist text warned against an assortment of dangerous formulas, one of which corresponds with gunpowder: \"Some have heated together sulfur, [[realgar]] (arsenic disulfide),\nand saltpeter with honey; smoke [and flames] result, so that their hands and faces have been burnt, and even the whole house burned down.\"{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=32}} Alchemists called this discovery fire medicine (\"huoyao\" \u706b\u85e5), and the term has continued to refer to gunpowder in China into the present day, a reminder of its heritage as a side result in the search for longevity increasing drugs.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=30}}\n\nThe earliest surviving chemical formula of gunpowder dates to 1044 in the form of the military manual ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'', also known in English as the ''Complete Essentials for the Military Classics'', which contains a collection of factoids on Chinese weaponry.{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=118-124}}{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=138}} The ''Wujing Zongyao'' served as a repository of antiquated or fanciful weaponry, and this applied to gunpowder as well, suggesting that it had already been weaponized long before the invention of what would today be considered conventional firearms. These types of gunpowder weapons styles an assortment of odd names such as \"flying incendiary club for subjugating demons\", \"caltrop fire ball\", \"ten-thousand fire flying sand magic bomb\", \"big bees nest\", \"burning heaven fierce fire unstoppable bomb\", \"fire bricks\" which released \"flying swallows\", \"flying rats\", \"fire birds\", and \"fire oxen\". Eventually they gave way and coalesced into a smaller number of dominant weapon types, notably gunpowder arrows, bombs, and guns. This was most likely because some weapons were deemed too onerous or ineffective to deploy.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=16}}\n\n===Fire arrows===\n{{further|Fire arrow}}\nAt this point the formula contained too little saltpeter (about 50%) to be explosive, but the mixture was highly flammable, and contemporary weapons reflected this in their deployment as mainly shock and incendiary weapons. One of the first, if not the first of these weapons was the [[fire arrow]].{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=31}} The first possible reference to the use of fire arrows was by the [[Wu (Ten Kingdoms)|Southern Wu]] in 904 during the siege of [[Nanchang|Yuzhang]]. An officer under [[Yang Xingmi]] by the name of Zheng Fan (\u912d\u74a0) ordered his troops to \"shoot off a machine to let fire and burn the Longsha Gate\", after which he and his troops dashed over the fire into the city and captured it, and he was promoted to Prime Minister Inspectorate for his efforts and the burns his body endured.<ref>\u5929\u4f51\u521d\uff0c\u738b\u8302\u7ae0\u5f81\u5b89\u4ec1\u4e49\u4e8e\u6da6\u5dde\uff0c\u6d0e\u57ce\u9677\uff0c\u4e2d\u5341\u4f59\u521b\uff0c\u4ee5\u529f\u8fc1\u5de6\u5148\u950b\u90fd\u5c09\u3002\u4ece\u653b\u8c6b\u7ae0\uff0c\uff08\u90d1\uff09\u74a0\u4ee5\u6240\u90e8\u53d1\u673a\u300c\u98de\u706b\u300d\uff0c\u70e7\u9f99\u6c99\u95e8\uff0c\u7387\u58ee\u58eb\u7a81\u706b\u5148\u767b\u5165\u57ce\uff0c\u7126\u707c\u88ab\u4f53\uff0c\u4ee5\u529f\u6388\u68c0\u6821\u53f8\u5f92\u3002(Rough Translation: During the beginning of Tianyou Era (904\u2013907), Zheng Fan followed Wang Maozhang under a campaign of Runzhou, which was guarded by rebel An Renyi, he was severely injured by the time it was captured, as the result he was promoted as the Junior General of Left Vanguard. At the campaign of Yuchang, he ordered his troops to propel the \"flying fire\" on the besieged city, after the city-gate of Longsha was burnt, he led his troops dashed over the fire and entered the city, his body was scorched, as the result he was promoted as the Prime Minister of Inspectorate.) Records of Nine Kingdoms ch. 2</ref> A later account of this event corroborated with the report and explained that \"by let fire (\u98db\u706b) is meant things like firebombs and fire arrows.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=31}} Arrows carrying gunpowder were possibly the most applicable form of gunpowder weaponry at the time. Early gunpowder may have only produced an effective flame when exposed to oxygen, thus the rush of air around the arrow in flight would have provided a suitable catalyst for the reaction.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=31}}\n\nThe first fire arrows were arrows strapped with gunpowder incendiaries, but in 969 two Song generals, Yue Yifang and Feng Jisheng (\u99ae\u7e7c\u5347), invented a variant fire arrow which utilized gunpowder tubes as propellants.{{sfn|Liang|2006}} Afterwards fire arrows started transitioning to rocket propelled weapons rather than being fired from a bow.{{sfn|Liang|2006}} These fire arrows were shown to the emperor in 970 when the head of a weapons manufacturing bureau sent Feng Jisheng to demonstrate the gunpowder arrow design, for which he was heavily rewarded. In 975, the state of [[Wuyue]] sent to the Song dynasty a unit of soldiers skilled in the handling of fire arrows and in the same year, the Song used fire arrows to destroy the fleet of [[Southern Tang]]. In 994, the [[Liao dynasty]] attacked the Song and laid siege to Zitong with 100,000 troops. They were repelled with the aid of fire arrows.{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=148}} In 1000 a soldier by the name of Tang Fu (\u5510\u798f) also demonstrated his own designs of gunpowder arrows, gunpowder pots (a proto-bomb which spews fire), and gunpowder caltrops, for which he was richly rewarded as well.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=32}} \n\nThe imperial court took great interest in the progress of gunpowder developments and actively encouraged as well as disseminated military technology. For example, in 1002 a local militia man named Shi Pu (\u77f3\u666e) showed his own versions of fireballs and gunpowder arrows to imperial officials. They were so astounded that the emperor and court decreed that a team would be assembled to print the plans and instructions for the new designs to promulgate throughout the realm.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=32}} The Song court's policy of rewarding military innovators was reported to have \"brought about a great number of cases of people presenting technology and techniques\" (\u5668\u68b0\u6cd5\u5f0f) according to the official ''[[History of Song]]''.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=32}} Production of gunpowder and fire arrows heavily increased in the 11th century as the court centralized the production process, constructing large gunpowder production facilities, hiring artisans, carpenters, and tanners for the military production complex in the capital of [[Kaifeng]]. One surviving source circa 1023 lists all the artisans working in Kaifeng while another notes that in 1083 the imperial court sent 100,000 gunpowder arrows to one garrison and 250,000 to another.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=32}} \n\nEvidence of gunpowder in the [[Liao dynasty]] and [[Western Xia]] is much sparser than in Song, but some evidence such as the Song decree of 1073 that all subjects were henceforth forbidden from trading sulfur and saltpeter across the Liao border, suggests that the Liao were aware of gunpowder developments to the south and coveted gunpowder ingredients of their own.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=32}}\n\n===Explosives===\n[[File:Thunderclap bomb.jpg|thumb|An illustration of a thunderclap bomb as depicted in the 1044 text ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]''. The top item is a through awl and the bottom one is a hook awl, used to ignite the projectile before it was hurled.]]\n[[File:Fire lance.jpg|thumb|Two different types of [[fire lance]]s.

As depicted in the ''[[Huolongjing]]'', a 14th-century military treatise.]]\n\nThe [[Jurchen people]] of [[Manchuria]] united under [[Wanyan Aguda]] and established the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] in 1115. Allying with the Song, they rose rapidly to the forefront of East Asian powers and defeated the Liao dynasty in a shockingly short span of time, destroying the 150 year balance of power between the Song, Liao, and Western Xia. Remnants of the Liao fled to the west and became known as the [[Qara Khitai]], or Western Liao to the Chinese. In the east, the fragile Song-Jin alliance dissolved once the Jin saw how badly the Song army had performed against Liao forces. Realizing the weakness of Song, the Jin grew tired of waiting and captured all five of the Liao capitals themselves. They proceeded to make war on Song, initiating the [[Jin-Song Wars]]. \n\nFor the first time, two major powers would have access to equally formidable gunpowder weapons.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=34}} Initially the Jin expected their campaign in the south to proceed smoothly given how poorly the Song had fared against the Liao. However they were met with stout resistance upon besieging Kaifeng in 1126 and faced the usual array of gunpowder arrows and fire bombs, but also a weapon called the \"thunderclap bomb\" (\u9739\u9742\u70ae), which one witness wrote, \"At night the thunderclap bombs were used, hitting the lines of the enemy well, and throwing them into great confusion. Many fled, screaming in fright.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=34}} The thunderclap bomb was previously mentioned in the ''Wujing Zongyao'', but this was the first recorded instance of its use. Its description in the text reads thus:\n\n{{quotation|The thunderclap bomb contains a length of two or three internodes of dry bamboo with a diameter of 1.5 in. There must be no cracks, and the septa are to be retained to avoid any leakage. Thirty pieces of thin broken porcelain the size of iron coins are mixed with 3 or 4 lb of gunpowder, and packed around the bamboo tube. The tube is wrapped within the ball, but with about an inch or so protruding at each end. A (gun)powder mixture is then applied all over the outer surface of the ball.{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=163}}|''[[Wujing Zongyao]]''}}\n\nJin troops withdrew with a ransom of Song silk and treasure but returned several months later with their own gunpowder bombs manufactured by captured Song artisans.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=34}} According to historian Wang Zhaochun, the account of this battle provided the \"earliest truly detailed descriptions of the use of gunpowder weapons in warfare.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=34}} Records show that the Jin utilized gunpowder arrows and [[Trebuchet|trebuchets]] to hurl gunpowder bombs while the Song responded with gunpowder arrows, fire bombs, thunderclap bombs, and a new addition called the \"molten metal bomb\" (\u91d1\u6c41\u70ae).{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=35}} As the Jin account describes, when they attacked the city's Xuanhua Gate, their \"fire bombs fell like rain, and their arrows were so numerous as to be uncountable.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=35}} The Jin captured Kaifeng despite the appearance of the molten metal bomb and secured another 20,000 fire arrows for their arsenal.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=35}}\n\nThe molten metal bomb appeared again in 1129 when Song general Li Yanxian (\u674e\u5f65\u4ed9) clashed with Jin forces while defending a strategic pass. The Jin assault lasted day and night without respite, using siege carts, fire carts, and sky bridges, but each assault was met with Song soldiers who \"resisted at each occasion, and also used molten metal bombs. Wherever the gunpowder touched, everything would disintegrate without a trace.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50}}\n\n===Naval bombs===\nGunpowder technology also spread to naval warfare and in 1129 Song decreed that all warships were to be fitted with trebuchets for hurling gunpowder bombs.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=38}} Older gunpowder weapons such as fire arrows were also utilized. In 1159 a Song fleet of 120 ships caught a Jin fleet at anchor near Shijiu Island (\u77f3\u81fc\u5cf6) off the shore of [[Shandong]] peninsula. The Song commander \"ordered that gunpowder arrows be shot from all sides, and wherever they struck, flames and smoke rose up in swirls, setting fire to several hundred vessels.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=39}} Song forces took another victory in 1161 when Song paddle boats ambushed a Jin transport fleet, launched thunderclap bombs, and drowned the Jin force in the [[Yangtze]].{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=39}}\n\n{{quotation|The men inside them paddled fast on the treadmills, and the ships glided forwards as though they were flying, yet no one was visible on board. The enemy thought that they were made of paper. Then all of a sudden\na thunderclap bomb was let off: It was made with paper (carton) and filled with lime and sulphur. (Launched from trebuchets) these thunderclap bombs came dropping down from the air, and upon meeting the water exploded with a noise like thunder, the sulphur bursting into flames. The carton case rebounded and broke, scattering the lime to form a smoky fog which blinded the eyes of men and horses so that they could see nothing. Our ships then went forward to attack theirs, and their men and horses were all drowned, so that they were utterly defeated.{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=166}}|''Hai Qiu Fu''}}\n\nAccording to a minor military official by the name of Zhao Wannian (\u8d99\u842c\u5e74), thunderclap bombs were used again to great effect by the Song during the Jin siege of Xiangyang in 1206\u20131207. Both sides had gunpowder weapons, but the Jin troops only used gunpowder arrows for destroying the city's moored vessels. The Song used fire arrows, fire bombs, and thunderclap bombs. Fire arrows and bombs were used to destroy Jin trebuchets. The thunderclap bombs were used on Jin soldiers themselves, causing foot soldiers and horsemen to panic and retreat. \"We beat our drums and yelled from atop the city wall, and simultaneously fired our thunderclap missiles out from the city walls. The enemy cavalry was terrified and ran away.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=40}} The Jin were forced to retreat and make camp by the riverside. In a rare occurrence, the Song made a successful offensive on Jin forces and conducted a night assault using boats. They were loaded with gunpowder arrows, thunderclap bombs, a thousand crossbowmen, five hundred infantry, and a hundred drummers. Jin troops were surprised in their encampment while asleep by loud drumming, followed by an onslaught of crossbow bolts, and then thunderclap bombs, which caused a panic of such magnitude that they were unable to even saddle themselves and trampled over each other trying to get away. Two to three thousand Jin troops were slaughtered along with eight to nine hundred horses.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=40}}\n\n===Hard-shell explosives===\nThen everything changed when the Jin dynasty attacked, with even better bombs: the iron bomb. Traditionally the inspiration for the development of the iron bomb is ascribed to the tale of a fox hunter named Iron Li. According to the story, around the year 1189 Iron Li developed a new method for hunting foxes which used a ceramic explosive to scare foxes into his nets. The explosive consisted of a ceramic bottle with a mouth, stuffed with gunpowder, and attached with a fuse. Explosive and net were placed at strategic points of places such as watering holes frequented by foxes, and when they got near enough, Iron Li would light the fuse, causing the ceramic bottle to explode and scaring the frightened foxes right into his nets. While a fanciful tale, it's not exactly certain why this would cause the development of the iron bomb, given the explosive was made using ceramics, and other materials such as bamboo or even leather would have done the same job, assuming they made a loud enough noise.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=41}} Nonetheless, the iron bomb made its first appearance in 1221 at the siege of [[Qi Prefecture (Hubei)|Qizhou]] (in modern [[Hubei province]]), and this time it would be the Jin who possessed the technological advantage. The Song command Zhao Yurong (\u8d99\u8207\u8923) survived and was able to relay his account for posterity.\n\nQizhou was a major fortress city situated near the Yangtze and a 25 thousand strong Jin army advanced on it in 1221. News of the approaching army reached Zhao Yurong in Qizhou, and despite being outnumbered nearly eight to one, he decided to hold the city. Qizhou's arsenal consisted of some three thousand thunderclap bombs, twenty thousand \"great leather bombs\" (\u76ae\u5927\u70ae), and thousands of gunpowder arrows and gunpowder crossbow bolts. While the formula for gunpowder had become potent enough to consider the Song bombs to be true explosives, they were unable to match the explosive power of the Jin iron bombs. Yurong describes the uneven exchange thus, \"The barbaric enemy attacked the Northwest Tower with an unceasing flow of catapult projectiles from thirteen catapults. Each catapult shot was followed by an iron fire bomb [catapult shot], whose sound was like thunder. That day, the city soldiers in facing the catapult shots showed great courage as they maneuvered [our own] catapults, hindered by injuries from the iron fire bombs. Their heads, their eyes, their cheeks were exploded to bits, and only one half [of the face] was left.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=42}} Jin artillerists were able to successfully target the command center itself: \"The enemy fired off catapult stones ... nonstop day and night, and the magistrate's headquarters [\u5e33] at the eastern gate, as well as my own quarters ..., were hit by the most iron fire bombs, to the point that they struck even on top of [my] sleeping quarters and [I] nearly perished! Some said there was a traitor. If not, how would they have known the way to strike at both of these places?\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=42}} \n\nZhao was able to examine the new iron bombs himself and described thus, \"In shape they are like gourds, but with a small mouth. They are made with pig iron, about two inches thick, and they cause the city's walls to shake.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=42}} Houses were blown apart, towers battered, and defenders blasted from their placements. Within four weeks all four gates were under heavy bombardment. Finally the Jin made a frontal assault on the walls and scaled them, after which followed a merciless hunt for soldiers, officers, and officials of every level. Zhao managed an escape by clambering over the battlement and making a hasty retreat across the river, but his family remained in the city. Upon returning at a later date to search the ruins, he found that the \"bones and skeletons were so mixed up that there was no way to tell who was who.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=42}}\n\n<center>\n<gallery widths=\"180\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:11th century basketry fire arrow rocket launcher.jpg|An illustration of [[fire arrow]] launchers as depicted in the ''[[Wubei Zhi]]'' (1621).

The fighting that ensued would see the first proto-gun, the [[fire lance]], in action - with earliest confirmed employment by Song dynasty forces against the Jin in 1132 during the [[siege of De'an]] (modern [[Anlu]], [[Hubei Province]]),{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=222}}{{sf|Chase|2003|p=31}}{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=33-34}}{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=38}}\n\nThe siege of De'an marks an important transition and landmark in the history of gunpowder weapons as the fire medicine of the fire lances were described using a new word: \"fire bomb medicine\" (\u706b\u70ae\u85e5), rather than simply \"fire medicine.\" This could imply the use of a new more potent formula, or simply an acknowledgement of the specialized military application of gunpowder.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=38}} Peter Lorge suggests that this \"bomb powder\" may have been corned, making it distinct from normal gunpowder.{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=19}} Evidence of gunpowder firecrackers also points to their appearance at roughly around the same time fire medicine was making its transition in the literary imagination.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=39}} \n\nFire lances continued to be used as anti-personnel weapons into the Ming dynasty, and were even attached to battle carts on one situation in 1163. Song commander Wei Sheng constructed several hundred of these carts known as \"at-your-desire-war-carts\" (\u5982\u610f\u6230\u8eca), which contained fire lances protruding from protective covering on the sides.

From there it branched off into several different gunpowder weapons known as \"eruptors\" in the late 12th and early 13th centuries, with different functions such as the \"filling-the-sky erupting tube\" which spewed out poisonous gas and porcelain shards, the \"orifice-penetrating flying sand magic mist tube\" (\u947d\u7a74\u98db\u7802\u795e\u9727\u7b52) which spewed forth sand and poisonous chemicals into orifices, and the more conventional \"phalanx-charging fire gourd\" which shot out lead pellets.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=51}}\n\nArchaeological samples of the gun, specifically the [[hand cannon]] ([[huochong]]), have been dated starting from the 13th century. The oldest extant gun whose dating is unequivocal is the [[Xanadu Gun]] because it contains an inscription describing its date of manufacture corresponding to 1298. It is so called because it was discovered in the ruins of [[Shangdu|Xanadu]], the Mongol summer palace in Inner Mongolia. The Xanadu Gun is 34.7&nbsp;cm in length and weighs 6.2&nbsp;kg. The design of the gun includes axial holes in its rear which some speculate could have been used in a mounting mechanism. Like most early guns it is small, weighing just over six kilograms and thirty-five centimeters in length.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=52-53}} Although the Xanadu Gun is the most precisely dated gun from the 13th century, other extant samples with approximate dating likely predate it.\n\nAnother specimen, the [[Wuwei Bronze Cannon]], was discovered in 1980 and may possibly be the oldest as well as largest cannon of the 13th century: a 100 centimeter 108 kilogram bronze cannon discovered in a cellar in [[Wuwei, Gansu|Wuwei]], [[Gansu Province]] containing no inscription, but has been dated by historians to the late Western Xia period between 1214 and 1227. The gun contained an iron ball about nine centimeters in diameter, which is smaller than the muzzle diameter at twelve centimeters, and 0.1 kilograms of gunpowder in it when discovered, meaning that the projectile might have been another co-viative.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=53-54}} Ben Sinvany and Dang Shoushan believe that the ball used to be much larger prior to its highly corroded state at the time of discovery.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=330}} While large in size, the weapon is noticeably more primitive than later Yuan dynasty guns, and is unevenly cast. A similar weapon was discovered not far from the discovery site in 1997, but much smaller in size at only 1.5&nbsp;kg.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=54}} Chen Bingying disputes this however, and argues there were no guns before 1259, while Dang Shoushan believes the Western Xia guns point to the appearance of guns by 1220, and Stephen Haw goes even further by stating that guns were developed as early as 1200.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=329}} Sinologist [[Joseph Needham]] and renaissance siege expert Thomas Arnold provide a more conservative estimate of around 1280 for the appearance of the \"true\" cannon.{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=10}}{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=18}} \n\nWhether or not any of these are correct, it seems likely that the gun was born sometime during the 13th century.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=54}}\n\n<center>\n<gallery widths=\"180\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Xixia bronze gun.png|Discovered in 1980, [[Gansu]], late [[Western Xia]] (1214-1227).

Unfortunately textual evidence for this is scant as the Mongols left few documents. This lack of primary source documents has caused some historians and scholars such as Kate Raphael to doubt the Mongol's role in disseminating gunpowder throughout Eurasia. On the opposite side stand historians such as Tonio Andrade and Stephen Haw, who believe that the Mongol Empire not only used gunpowder weapons but deserves the moniker \"the first gunpowder empire.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=327}}\n\n====Conquest of the Jin dynasty====\n{{main|Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty}}\nThe first concerted Mongol invasion of Jin occurred in 1211 and total conquest was not accomplished until 1234. In 1232 the Mongols besieged the Jin capital of Kaifeng and deployed gunpowder weapons along with other more conventional siege techniques such as building stockades, watchtowers, trenches, guardhouses, and forcing Chinese captives to haul supplies and fill moats.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=45}} Jin scholar Liu Qi (\u5289\u7948) recounts in his memoir, \"the attack against the city walls grew increasingly intense, and bombs rained down as [the enemy] advanced.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=45}} The Jin defenders also deployed gunpowder bombs as well as fire arrows (''huo jian'' \u706b\u7bad) launched using a type of early solid-propellant rocket.{{sfn|Liang|2006}} Of the bombs, Liu Qi writes, \"From within the walls the defenders responded with a gunpowder bomb called the heaven-shaking-thunder bomb (\u9707\u5929\u96f7). Whenever the [Mongol] troops encountered one, several men at a time would be turned into ashes.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=45}} \n\nA more fact based and clear description of the bomb exists in the ''[[History of Jin]]'': \"The heaven-shaking-thunder bomb is an iron vessel filled with gunpowder. When lighted with fire and shot off, it goes off like a crash of thunder that can be heard for a hundred li [thirty miles], burning an expanse of land more than half a mu [\u6240\u7207\u570d\u534a\u755d\u4e4b\u4e0a, a mu is a sixth of an acre], and the fire can even penetrate iron armor.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=45}} A Ming official named He Mengchuan would encounter an old cache of these bombs three centuries later in the Xi'an area: \"When I went on official business to Shaanxi Province, I saw on top of Xi'an's city walls an old stockpile of iron bombs. They were called 'heaven-shaking-thunder' bombs, and they were like an enclosed rice bowl with a hole at the top, just big enough to put your finger in. The troops said they hadn't been used for a very long time.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=45}} Furthermore, he wrote, \"When the powder goes off, the bomb rips open, and the iron pieces fly in all directions. That is how it is able to kill people and horses from far away.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=46}}\n\nHeaven-shaking-thunder bombs, also known as thunder crash bombs, were utilized prior to the siege in 1231 when a Jin general made use of them in destroying a Mongol warship, but during the siege the Mongols responded by protecting themselves with elaborate screens of thick cowhide. This was effective enough for workers to get right up to the walls to undermine their foundations and excavate protective niches. Jin defenders countered by tying iron cords and attaching them to heaven-shaking-thunder bombs, which were lowered down the walls until they reached the place where the miners worked. The protective leather screens were unable to withstand the explosion, and were penetrated, killing the excavators.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=46}} \n\nAnother weapon the Jin employed was an improved version of the fire lance called the flying fire lance. The ''History of Jin'' provides a detailed description: \"To make the lance, use chi-huang paper, sixteen layers of it for the tube, and make it a bit longer than two feet. Stuff it with willow charcoal, iron fragments, magnet ends, sulfur, white arsenic [probably an error that should mean saltpeter], and other ingredients, and put a fuse to the end. Each troop has hanging on him a little iron pot to keep fire [probably hot coals], and when it's time to do battle, the flames shoot out the front of the lance more than ten feet, and when the gunpowder is depleted, the tube isn't destroyed.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=46}} While Mongol soldiers typically held a view of disdain toward most Jin weapons, apparently they greatly feared the flying fire lance and heaven-shaking-thunder bomb.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=45}} Kaifeng managed to hold out for a year before the Jin emperor fled and the city capitulated. In some cases Jin troops still fought with some success, scoring isolated victories such as when a Jin commander led 450 fire lancers against a Mongol encampment, which was \"completely routed, and three thousand five hundred were drowned.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=46}} Even after the Jin emperor committed suicide in 1234, one loyalist gathered all the metal he could find in the city he was defending, even gold and silver, and made explosives to lob against the Mongols, but the momentum of the Mongol Empire could not be stopped.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p46-47}} By 1234, both the Western Xia and Jin dynasty had been conquered.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=47}}\n\n====Conquest of the Song dynasty====\n{{main|Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty}}\nThe Mongol war machine moved south and in 1237 attacked the Song city of Anfeng (modern [[Shouxian]], [[Anhui Province]]) \"using gunpowder bombs [huo pao] to burn the [defensive] towers.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=47}} These bombs were apparently quite large. \"Several hundred men hurled one bomb, and if it hit the tower it would immediately smash it to pieces.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=47}} The Song defenders under commander Du Gao (\u675c\u6772) rebuilt the towers and retaliated with their own bombs, which they called the \"Elipao,\" after a famous local pear, probably in reference to the shape of the weapon.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=47}} Perhaps as another point of military interest, the account of this battle also mentions that the Anfeng defenders were equipped with a type of small arrow to shoot through eye slits of Mongol armor, as normal arrows were too thick to penetrate.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=47}}\n\nBy the mid 13th century, gunpowder weapons had become central to the Song war effort. In 1257 the Song official Li Zengbo was dispatched to inspect frontier city arsenals. Li considered an ideal city arsenal to include several hundred thousand iron bombshells, and also its own production facility to produce at least a couple thousand a month. The results of his tour of the border were severely disappointing and in one arsenal he found \"no more than 85 iron bomb-shells, large and small, 95 fire-arrows, and 105 fire-lances. This is not sufficient for a mere hundred men, let alone a thousand, to use against an attack by the ... barbarians. The government supposedly wants to make preparations for the defense of its fortified cities, and to furnish them with military supplies against the enemy (yet this is all they give us). What chilling indifference!\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=47-48}} Fortunately for the Song, [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]] died in 1259 and the war would not continue until 1269 under the leadership of [[Kublai Khan]], but when it did the Mongols came in full force.\n\nBlocking the Mongols' passage south of the Yangtze were the twin fortress cities of Xiangyang and Fancheng. What resulted was one of the longest sieges the world had ever known, lasting from 1268 to 1273. In 1273 the Mongols enlisted the expertise of two Muslim engineers, one from Persia and one from Syria, who helped in the construction of counterweight trebuchets. These new siege weapons had the capability of throwing larger missiles further than the previous traction trebuchets. One account records, \"when the machinery went off the noise shook heaven and earth; every thing that [the missile] hit was broken and destroyed.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=49}} The fortress city of Xiangyang fell in 1273.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50}}\n\nThe next major battle to feature gunpowder weapons was during a campaign led by the Mongol general Bayan, who commanded an army of around two hundred thousand, consisting of mostly Chinese soldiers. It was probably the largest army the Mongols had ever utilized. Such an army was still unable to successfully storm Song city walls, as seen in the 1274 Siege of Shayang. Thus Bayan waited for the wind to change to a northerly course before ordering his artillerists to begin bombarding the city with molten metal bombs, which caused such a fire that \"the buildings were burned up and the smoke and flames rose up to heaven.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50}} Shayang was captured and its inhabitants massacred.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50}}\n\nGunpowder bombs were used again in the 1275 Siege of Changzhou in the latter stages of the Mongol-Song Wars. Upon arriving at the city, Bayan gave the inhabitants an ultimatum: \"if you ... resist us ... we shall drain your carcasses of blood and use them for pillows.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50}} This didn't work and the city resisted anyway, so the Mongol army bombarded them with fire bombs before storming the walls, after which followed an immense slaughter claiming the lives of a quarter million.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50}} The war lasted for only another four years during which some remnants of the Song held up last desperate defenses. In 1277, 250 defenders under Lou Qianxia conducted a suicide bombing and set off a huge iron bomb when it became clear defeat was imminent. Of this, the ''History of Song'' writes, \"the noise was like a tremendous thunderclap, shaking the walls and ground, and the smoke filled up the heavens outside. Many of the troops [outside] were startled to death. When the fire was extinguished they went in to see. There were just ashes, not a trace left.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50-51}}{{sfn|Partington|1960|p=250, 244, 149}} So came an end to the Mongol-Song Wars, which saw the deployment of all the gunpowder weapons available to both sides at the time, which for the most part meant gunpowder arrows, bombs, and lances, but in retrospect, another development would overshadow them all, the birth of the gun.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=51}}\n\nIn 1280, a large store of gunpowder at [[Weiyang District, Yangzhou|Weiyang]] in [[Yangzhou]] accidentally caught fire, producing such a massive explosion that a team of inspectors at the site a week later deduced that some 100 guards had been killed instantly, with wooden beams and pillars blown sky high and landing at a distance of over 10 [[li (unit)|li]] (~2&nbsp;mi. or ~3&nbsp;km) away from the explosion, creating a crater more than ten feet deep.<ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 7 209 210\" >[[#Needham, V 7|Needham, V 7]], pp.&nbsp;209\u2013210.</ref>\n\nBy the time of [[Jiao Yu]] and his ''[[Huolongjing]]'' (a book that describes military applications of gunpowder in great detail) in the mid 14th century, the explosive potential of gunpowder was perfected, as the level of nitrate in gunpowder formulas had risen from a range of 12% to 91%,<ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 7 345\">[[#Needham, V 7|Needham, V 7]], pp.&nbsp;345.</ref> with at least 6 different formulas in use that are considered to have maximum explosive potential for gunpowder.<ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 7 345\" /> By that time, the Chinese had discovered how to create explosive [[round shot]] by packing their hollow shells with this nitrate-enhanced gunpowder.<ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 7 264\" >[[#Needham, V 7|Needham, V 7]], pp.&nbsp;264.</ref>\n\n====Invasions of Europe and Japan====\n{{main|Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongol invasions of Japan}}\nGunpowder may have been used during the [[Mongol invasions of Europe]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dfCRAAAAIAAJ |title=Hungary |first=Tibor |last=Mende|accessdate=28 November 2011 |year=1944 |publisher=Macdonald & Co.

Accuracy was low and they were limited to a range of only 50 paces or so.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=59-60}}\n\nDespite the relatively small size of Ming guns, some elements of gunpowder weapon design followed world trends.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=110}} The growing length to muzzle bore ratio matched the rate at which European guns were developing up until the 1450s. The practice of corning gunpowder had been developed by 1370 for the purpose of increasing explosive power in land mines,{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=110}} and was arguably used in guns as well according to one record of a fire-tube shooting a projectile 457 meters, which was probably only possible at the time with the usage of corned powder.{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=16}} Around the same year Ming guns transitioned from using stone shots to iron ammunition, which has greater density and increased firearm power.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=105}}\n\nThe peak of Chinese cannon development is exemplified by the muzzle loading wrought iron \"great general cannon\" (\u5927\u5c07\u8ecd\u70ae) which weighed up to 360 kilograms and could fire a 4.8 kilogram lead ball. Its heavier variant, the \"great divine cannon\" (\u5927\u795e\u9283), could weigh up to 600 kilograms and was capable of firing several iron balls and upward of a hundred iron shots at once. The great general and divine cannons were the last indigenous Chinese cannon designs prior to the incorporation of European models in the 16th century.<ref>{{citation |url=http://greatmingmilitary.blogspot.com/2015/07/da-jiang-jun-pao.html |title=Da Jiang Jun Pao (\u5927\u5c07\u8ecd\u7832) |accessdate=30 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe lack of larger siege weapons in China unlike the rest of the world where cannons grew larger and more potent has been attributed to the immense thickness of traditional Chinese walls,{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=97}} which Tonio Andrade suggests provided no incentive for creating larger cannons, since even industrial artillery had trouble overcoming them.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=66}} Asianist Kenneth also argues that larger guns were not particularly useful against China's traditional enemies: horse nomads.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=111}} \n<center>\n<gallery widths=\"180\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Ming Dynasty field artillery cannon.jpg |An illustration of a bronze \"thousand ball thunder cannon\" from the ''[[Huolongjing]]''.\nFile:Seven barreled organ gun.jpg|A seven barreled organ gun with two auxiliary guns by its side on a two-wheeled carriage.

Originally a minor power, it grew to become one of the most powerful states in 14th-century Europe, and a great innovator in siege warfare. The Duke of Burgundy, [[Philip the Bold]] (1363\u20131404), based his power on the effective use of big guns and promoted research and development in all aspects of gunpowder weaponry technology. Philip established manufacturers and employed more cannon casters than any European power before him.\n\nWhereas most European guns before 1370 weighed about 20 to 40&nbsp;lbs (9\u201314&nbsp;kg), the French siege of [[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte]] in 1375 during the [[Hundred Years War]] saw the use of guns weighing over a [[ton]] (900&nbsp;kg), firing stone balls weighing over 100&nbsp;lbs (45&nbsp;kg).{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=34}} Philip used large guns to help [[Kingdom of France|the French]] capture the fortress of [[Odruik]] in 1377. These guns fired projectiles far larger than any that had been used before, with seven guns that could shoot projectiles as heavy as 90 kilograms. The cannons smashed the city walls, inaugurating a new era of artillery warfare and Burgundy's territories rapidly expanded.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=88-89}}\n\nEurope entered an arms race to build ever larger artillery pieces. By the early 15th century both French and English armies were equipped with larger pieces known as [[bombard (weapon)|bombard]]s, weighing up to 5 tons (4,535&nbsp;kg) and firing balls weighing up to 300&nbsp;lbs (136&nbsp;kg).{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=34}} The artillery trains used by [[Henry V of England]] in the 1415 [[Siege of Harfleur]] and 1419 [[Siege of Rouen]] proved effective in breaching French fortifications, while artillery contributed to the victories of French forces under [[Joan of Arc]] in the [[Loire Campaign (1429)]].{{sfn|Wagner|2006|pp=34\u201335}} \n\nThese weapons were transformational for European warfare. A hundred years earlier the Frenchman Pierre Dubois wrote that a \"castle can hardly be taken within a year, and even if it does fall, it means more expenses for the king's purse and for his subjects than the conquest is worth,\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=90}} but by the 15th century European walls fell with the utmost regularity.\n\nThe [[Ottoman Empire]] was also developing their own artillery pieces. [[Mehmed the Conqueror]] (1432\u20131481) was determined to procure large cannons for the purpose of conquering [[Constantinople]]. Hungarian [[Orban|Urban]] produced for him a six-meter (20 foot) long cannon, which required hundreds of pounds of gunpowder to fire; during the actual [[Siege of Constantinople (1453)|siege of Constantinople]] the gun proved to be somewhat underwhelming.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=94}} However, dozens of other large cannons bombarded [[Walls of Constantinople|Constantinople's walls]] in their weakest sections for 55 days,{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=94}} and despite a fierce defense, the city's fortifications were overwhelmed.\n\n<center>\n<gallery widths=\"180\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Nicopol final battle 1398.jpg|Battle of Nicopolis 1398\nFile:Braunschweig Brunswick Faule Mette.jpg|[[Faule Metze]] ( Metze, old term for a whore)(\"Lazy Mette\"), a medieval supergun from 1411 from [[Braunschweig]], Germany\nImage:Si\u00e8ge d'Orl\u00e9ans (1428).jpg|[[Thomas Montagu, 4th Earl of Salisbury]] is fatally injured at the [[siege of Orl\u00e9ans]] in 1428 (illustration from ''[[Charles VII of France|Vigiles de Charles VII]]'').\nFile:Artillery in the MMB.jpg|[[Faule Magd]] (\"Lazy Maid\"), a medieval cannon from ca. 1410\u20131430.\nFile:Edinburgh Castle, Mons Meg.jpg|[[Mons Meg]], a medieval [[Bombard (weapon)]] built in 1449.\nImage:Dardanelles Gun Turkish Bronze 15c.png|The bronze [[Great Turkish Bombard]], used by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the [[Fall of Constantinople|siege of Constantinople]] in 1453.\n</gallery>\n</center>\n====Changes to fortifications====\n[[File:Palmanova1600.jpg|right|thumb|17th-century map of the city of [[Palmanova]], [[Italy]], an example of a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] star fort]]\n[[File:Shouyuquanshu 1638.jpg|thumb|Chinese angled bastion fort, 1638]]\n{{further|Star fort|Bastion}}\n\nAs a response to gunpowder artillery, European fortifications began displaying architectural principles such as lower and thicker walls in the mid-1400s.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=211}} Cannon towers were built with artillery rooms where cannons could discharge fire from slits in the walls. However this proved problematic as the slow rate of fire, reverberating concussions, and noxious fumes produced greatly hindered defenders. Gun towers also limited the size and number of cannon placements because the rooms could only be built so big. Notable surviving artillery towers include a seven layer defensive structure built in 1480 at [[Foug\u00e8res]] in [[Brittany]], and a four layer tower built in 1479 at Querfurth in Saxony.{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=37}} \n\nThe star fort, also known as the bastion fort, ''trace italienne'', or renaissance fortress, was a style of fortification that became popular in Europe during the 16th century. The bastion and star fort was developed in Italy, where the Florentine engineer [[Giuliano da Sangallo]] (1445\u20131516) compiled a comprehensive defensive plan using the geometric [[bastion]] and full ''trace italienne'' that became widespread in Europe.{{sfn|Nolan|2006|p=67}} \n\nThe main distinguishing features of the star fort were its angle bastions, each placed to support their neighbor with lethal crossfire, covering all angles, making them extremely difficult to engage with and attack. Angle bastions consisted of two faces and two flanks. Artillery positions positioned at the flanks could fire parallel into the opposite bastion's line of fire, thus providing two lines of cover fire against an armed assault on the wall, and preventing mining parties from finding refuge. Meanwhile, artillery positioned on the bastion platform could fire frontally from the two faces, also providing overlapping fire with the opposite bastion.{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=40}} Overlapping mutually supporting defensive fire was the greatest advantage enjoyed by the star fort. As a result, sieges lasted longer and became more difficult affairs. By the 1530s the bastion fort had become the dominant defensive structure in Italy.{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=45}} \n\nOutside Europe, the star fort became an \"engine of European expansion,\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=211}} and acted as a force multiplier so that small European garrisons could hold out against numerically superior forces. Wherever star forts were erected the natives experienced great difficulty in uprooting European invaders.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=211}}\n\nIn China, [[Sun Yuanhua]] advocated for the construction of angled [[bastion forts]] in his ''Xifashenji'' so that their cannons could better support each other. The officials Han Yun and Han Lin noted that cannons on square forts could not support each side as well as bastion forts. Their efforts to construct bastion forts and their results were inconclusive. Ma Weicheng built two bastion forts in his home county, which helped fend off a [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] incursion in 1638. By 1641, there were ten bastion forts in the county. Before bastion forts could be spread any further, the Ming dynasty fell in 1644, and they were largely forgotten as the Qing dynasty was on the offensive most of the time and had no use for them.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=214}}\n\n===Perfection of the cannon===\n\nGun development and design in Europe reached its \"classic\" form in the 1480s - longer, lighter, more efficient, and more accurate compared to its predecessors only three decades prior. The design persisted, and cannons of the 1480s show little difference and surprising similarity with cannons three centuries later in the 1750s. This 300-year period during which the classic cannon dominated gives it its moniker.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=103-104}} \n                                                       \nThe early classical European guns are exemplified by two cannons from 1488 now preserved in a plaza in Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland. The Neuch\u00e2tel guns are 224 centimeters long, with a bore of 6.2 centimeters and the other is slightly longer, 252 centimeters, with the same bore size. They are differentiated from older firearms by an assortment of improvements. Their longer length-to-bore ratio imparts more energy into the shot, enabling the projectile to shoot further. Not only longer, they were also lighter as the barrel walls were made thinner to allow for faster dissipation of heat. They also no longer needed the help of a wooden plug to load since they offered a tighter fit between projectile and barrel, further increasing the accuracy of gunpowder warfare{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=104-106}} - and were deadlier due to developments such as gunpowder corning and iron shot. When these guns reached China in the 1510s, the Chinese were highly impressed by them, primarily for their longer and thinner barrels.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=107}}\n\nThe two primary theories for the appearance of the classic gun involve the development of gunpowder corning and a new method for casting guns. \n\nThe corning hypothesis stipulates that the longer barrels came about as a reaction to the development of corned gunpowder. Not only did \"corned\" powder keep better, because of its reduced surface area, but gunners also found that it was more powerful and easier to load into guns. Prior to corning, gunpowder would also frequently demix into its constitutive components and was therefore unreliable.<ref>Molerus, Otto. \"History of Civilization in the Western Hemisphere from the Point of View of Particulate Technology, Part 2,\" Advanced Powder Technology 7 (1996): 161\u201366.</ref> The faster gunpowder reaction was suitable for smaller guns, since large ones had a tendency to crack, and the more controlled reaction allowed large guns to have longer, thinner walls.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=109}} However, the corning hypothesis has been argued against on two grounds: One, the powder makers were probably more worried about spoilage than the effect of corned gunpowder on guns; and Two, corning as a practice had existed in China since the 1370s.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=110}} \n\nThe second theory is that the key to developing the classic gun may have been a new method of gun casting, muzzle side up.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=111}} Smith observes: \"The surviving pieces of ordnance from earlier in the 15th century are big pieces with large bore sizes. They do not look like the long thin gun.\u2026 Essentially they are parallel-sided tubes with flat ends. The explanation is, probably, that they were cast muzzle down in the traditional bell-founding method whereas the long thin guns were cast muzzle up.\u2026 Perhaps this marks the real 'revolution' in artillery. Once the technique of casting muzzle up with the attendant advantages, and it is not clear what those are at present, had been mastered by cannon founders, the way was open for the development of the 'classic' form of artillery.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=111}} However, Smith himself states that it is not clear what advantages this technique would have conferred, despite its widespread adoption.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=111}}\n\n<center>\n<gallery widths=\"180\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:16th Century Artillerie.jpg|16th-century Artillerie\nFile:French bastard culverin 1548 with arms of Henri II and Catherine de Medicis and crescent of Diane 85mm 300cm 1076kg.jpg|French bastard culverin dated to 1548, 85mm 300cm 1076kg.\nFile:Coulevrine Etudes-3 P.172 2-3.png|Two 15th-century culverins, one of forged iron, the other of cast bronze.\nFile:Canon Gribeauval 1780 front.jpg|18th-century [[Military history of France|French cannon]]\nFile:Gunpowder1.png|Different shapes of corned gunpowder, each with its own function\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n====Iron ''vs'' bronze====\n[[File:Ding liao da jiang jun.png|thumb|Ding Liao Da Jiangjun, a composite cast iron/cast bronze cannon.

The wrought iron cannon and the cast-bronze cannon. Wrought iron guns were structurally composed of two layers: an inner tube of iron staves held together in a tight fit by an outer case of iron hoops. Bronze cannons on the other hand were cast in one piece similar to bells. The technique used in casting bronze cannons was so similar to the bell that the two were often looked upon as a connected enterprise. \n\nBoth iron and bronze cannons had their advantages and disadvantages. Forged iron cannons were up to ten times cheaper, but more unstable due to their piece built nature. Even without use, iron cannons were liable to rust away, while bronze cannons did not. Another reason for the dominance of bronze cannons was their aesthetic appeal. Because cannons were so important as displays of power and prestige, rulers liked to commission bronze cannons, which could be sculpted into fanciful designs containing artistic motifs or symbols. It was for all these reasons that the cast-bronze cannon became the preferred type by the late 1400s.{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=27}}\n\nComposite iron/bronze cannons were far less common, but were produced in the Ming and Qing dynasties and were considered \"among the best in the world\" during the 17th century.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=202}} The Gujarats experimented with the same concept in 1545, the English at least by 1580, and Hollanders in 1629. However the effort required to produce these weapons prevented them from mass production.The Europeans essentially treated them as experimental products, resulting in very few surviving pieces today.<ref>http://nautarch.tamu.edu/Theses/pdf-files/Hoskins-MA2004.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Rise and Fall of Distinctive Composite-Metal Cannons Cast During the Ming-Qing Period|url=http://thjcs.web.nthu.edu.tw/files/14-1662-63632,r3836-1.php?Lang=zh-tw|accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref> Of the currently known extant composite metal cannons, there are 2 English, 2 Dutch, 12 Gujarati, and 48 from the Ming-Qing period.<ref name=\"Huang\">{{cite web|title=The Rise and Fall of Distinctive Composite-Metal Cannons Cast During the Ming-Qing Period|url=http://thjcs.web.nthu.edu.tw/files/14-1662-63632,r3836-1.php?Lang=zh-tw|accessdate=19 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Arquebus and musket===\n\n[[File:Weinlese Erlenbach 1444.jpg|thumb|Two soldiers on the left using arquebuses, 1470.]]\n[[File:PS8004046.jpg|thumb|A serpentine matchlock mechanism.]]\n[[File:Jacob de Gheyn - Wapenhandelinge 4.jpg|thumb|Musketeer from Jacob van Gheyn's Wapenhandelingen van Roers, Musquetten ende Spiesen, (1608).]]\n\n{{further|Arquebus|Musket|Matchlock}}\n\nThe arquebus was a firearm that appeared in Europe and the Ottoman Empire in the early 15th century. Its name is derived from the German word ''Hackenb\u00fcchse''. Although the term ''arquebus'' was applied to many different forms of firearms from the 15th to 17th centuries, it was originally used to describe \"a hand-gun with a hook-like projection or lug on its under surface, useful for steadying it against battlements or other objects when firing.\"{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=426}} These \"hook guns\" were in their earliest forms defensive weapons mounted on German city walls in the early 1400s, but by the late 1400s had transitioned into handheld firearms, with heavier variants known as \"muskets\" that were fired from resting Y-shaped supports appearing by the early 1500s. \n\nThe musket was able to penetrate all forms of armor available at the time, making armor obsolete, and as a consequence the heavy musket as well. Although there is relatively little to no difference in design between arquebus and musket except in size and strength, it was the term ''musket'' which remained in use up into the 1800s.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=61}} It may not be completely inaccurate to suggest that the musket was in its fabrication simply a larger arquebus. At least on one occasion the musket and arquebus have been used interchangeably to refer to the same weapon,{{sfn|Adle|2003|p=475}} and even referred to as an \"arquebus musket.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=165}} A Habsburg commander in the mid-1560s once referred to muskets as \"double arquebuses.\"{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=92}} The definition of arquebus and similar firearms is therefore quite convoluted as the term has been applied to different sorts of firearms as well as acquiring several names like ''hackbut,''{{sfn|Purton|2010|p=422}} ''harquebus'', ''schiopo,''{{sfn|Purton|2010|p=427}} ''sclopus,''{{sfn|Purton|2010|p=117}} ''t\u00fcfenk'',{{sfn|\u00c1goston|2005|p=19}} ''tofak'',{{sfn|\u00c1goston|2005|p=58}} ''matchlock'', and ''firelock''.{{sfn|Lidin|2002|p=3}} Some say that the hackbut was a forerunner of the arquebus.{{sfn|Purton|2010|p=425}}\n\nThe dating of the ''matchlock'' firing mechanism's first appearance is disputed. The first references to the use of what may have been arquebuses (''t\u00fcfek'') by the [[Janissary]] corps of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Ottoman army|army]] date them from 1394 to 1465.{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=443}}  However it's unclear whether these were arquebuses or small cannons as late as 1444, but the fact that they were listed separate from cannons in mid-15th century inventories suggest they were handheld firearms.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=\u00c1goston |first1=G\u00e1bor |title=Military Transformation in the Ottoman Empire and Russia, 1500\u20131800 |journal=Kritika: Explorations in Russian and Eurasian History |date=2011 |volume=12 |issue=2 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254954728_Military_Transformation_in_the_Ottoman_Empire_and_Russia_1500-1800 |pages=281\u2013319 [294] |doi=10.1353/kri.2011.0018|quote=Initially the  Janissaries were equipped with bows, crossbows, and javelins.

The matchlock arquebus was the first firearm equipped with a trigger mechanism..{{sfn|Phillips|2016}}{{sfn|Petzal|2014|p=5}} It is also considered to be the first portable shoulder-arms firearm.{{sfn|Partington|1999|p=xxvii}}\n\nMatchlock became a common term for the arquebus after it was added to the firearm. Prior to the appearance of the matchlock, handguns were fired from the chest, tucked under one arm, while the other arm maneuvered a hot pricker to the touch hole to ignite the gunpowder.{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=75}} The matchlock changed this by adding a firing mechanism consisting of two parts, the match, and the lock. The lock mechanism held within a clamp a two to three feet long length of smoldering rope soaked in saltpeter, which was the match.{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=75}} Connected to the lock lever was a trigger, which lowered the match into a priming pan when pulled, igniting the priming powder, causing a flash to travel through the touch hole, also igniting the gunpowder within the barrel, and propelling the bullet out the muzzle.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=24}} \n\nWhile matchlocks provided a crucial advantage by allowing the user to aim the firearm using both hands, it was also awkward to utilize.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=25}} To avoid accidentally igniting the gunpowder the match had to be detached while loading the gun. In some instances the match would also go out, so both ends of the match were kept lit. This proved cumbersome to maneuver as both hands were required to hold the match during removal, one end in each hand. The procedure was so complex that a 1607 drill manual published by Jacob de Gheyn in the Netherlands listed 28 steps just to fire and load the gun.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=25}} In 1584 the Ming general [[Qi Jiguang]] composed an 11 step song to practice the procedure in rhythm: \"One, clean the gun. Two pour the powder. Three tamp the powder down. Four drop the pellet. Five drive the pellet down. Six put in paper (stopper). Seven drive the paper down. Eight open the flashpan cover. Nine pour in the flash powder. Ten close the flashpan, and clamp the fuse. Eleven, listen for the signal, then open the flashpan cover. Aiming at the enemy, raise your gun and fire.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=176-175}} Reloading a gun during the 16th century took anywhere from between 20 seconds to a minute under the most ideal conditions.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=144}}\n\nThe arquebus is considered to be the first portable \"shoulder\" arms firearm.{{sfn|Partington|1999|p=xxvii}} Arquebuses were used as early as 1472 by the Spanish and Portuguese at Zamora. Likewise, the Castilians used arquebuses as well in 1476.{{sfn|Partington|1999|p=123}} In 1496 Philip Monch of the Palatinate composed an illustrated ''Buch der Strynt un(d) Buchsse(n)'' on guns and \"harquebuses.\"{{sfn|Partington|1999|p=160}} The Mamluks in particular were conservatively against the incorporation of gunpowder weapons. When faced with cannons and arquebuses wielded by the Ottomans they criticized them thus, \"God curse the man who invented them, and God curse the man who fires on Muslims with them.\"{{sfn|Partington|1999|p=208}} Insults were also levied against the Ottomans for having \"brought with you this contrivance artfully devised by the Christians of Europe when they were incapable of meeting the Muslim armies on the battlefield.\"{{sfn|Partington|1999|p=208}} Similarly, [[musketeer]]s and musket-wielding infantrymen were despised in society by the [[feudal]] [[knight]]s, even until the time of [[Cervantes]] (1547\u20131616 AD).<ref name=\"khan 6\">{{Harvcolnb|Khan|2004|p=6}}</ref> Eventually the Mamluks under [[Qaitbay]] were ordered in 1489 to train in the use of al-bunduq al-rasas (arquebuses). However, in 1514 an Ottoman army of 12,000 soldiers wielding arquebuses still managed to rout a much larger Mamluk force.{{sfn|Partington|1999|p=208}} The arquebus had become a common infantry weapon by the 16th century due to its relative cheapness \u2013 a helmet, breastplate and pike cost about three and a quarter ducats while an arquebus only a little over one ducat.{{sfn|Purton|2010|p=422}}{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=44}} Another advantage of arquebuses over other equipment and weapons was its short training period. While a bow potentially took years to master, an effective arquebusier could be trained in just two weeks.{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=74}} According to a 1571 report by Vincentio d'Alessandri, Persian arms including arquebuses \"were superior and better tempered than those of any other nation.\"{{sfn|Adle|2003|p=475}}\n\nIn the early 1500s a larger arquebus known as the musket appeared. The heavy musket, while being rather awkward to handle, requiring a fork rest to fire properly, had the advantage of being able to penetrate the best armor within a range of 180 meters, regular armor at 365 meters, and an unarmed man at 548 meters. However, both the musket and arquebus were effectively limited to a range of only 90 to 185 meters regardless of armor since they were incredibly inaccurate.{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=75-78}} According to some sources, a smoothbore musket was completely incapable of hitting a man sized target past the 73 meter mark.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=74}} While rifled guns did exist at this time in the form of grooves cut into the interior of a barrel, these were considered specialist weapons and limited in number.{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=75-78}} In some aspects this made the smoothbore musket an inferior weapon compared to the bow. The average Mamluk archer for example was capable of hitting targets only 68 meters far away but could keep up a pace of six to eight shots per minute. In comparison, sixteenth-century matchlocks fired off one shot every several minutes, and much less when taking into consideration misfires and malfunctions which occurred up to half the time. This is not to say that firearms of the 16th century were inferior to the bow and arrow, for it could better penetrate armor and required less training, but the disadvantages of the musket were very real, and it would not be until the 1590s that archers were for the most part phased out of ''European'' warfare.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=74}} This was possibly a consequence of the increased effectiveness of musket warfare due to the rise of volley fire in Europe as first applied by the Dutch.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=75}} At this time gunners in European armies reached as high as 40 percent of infantry forces.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=167}}\n\nAs the virtues of the musket became apparent it was quickly adopted throughout Eurasia so that by 1560 even in China generals were giving praise to the new weapon. Qi Jiguang, a noted partisan of the musket, gave a eulogy on the effectiveness of the gun in 1560:\n\n{{quotation|It is unlike any other of the many types of fire weapons. In strength it can pierce armor. In accuracy it can strike the center of targets, even to the point of hitting the eye of a coin [i.e., shooting right through a coin], and not just for exceptional shooters.\u2026 The arquebus [\u9ce5\u9283] is such a powerful weapon and is so accurate that even bow and arrow cannot match it, and \u2026 nothing is so strong as to be able to defend against it.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=172}}|''Jixiao Xinshu''}}\n\nOther [[East Asian]] powers such as [[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t]] also adopted the matchlock musket in quick order. \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t in particular was considered by the Ming to have produced the most advanced matchlocks in the world during the 17th century, surpassing even Ottoman, Japanese, and European firearms. European observers of the [[Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n War]] also corroborated with the Ming in the proficiency of matchlock making by the Vietnamese. The Vietnamese matchlock was said to have been able to pierce several layers of iron armour, kill two to five men in one shot, yet also fire quietly for a weapon of its caliber.<ref>{{citation |url=http://greatmingmilitary.blogspot.com/2014/11/matchlock-of-ming-dynasty.html |title=Matchlock firearms of the Ming Dynasty |accessdate=25 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Gunpowder Empires==\n\n[[File:The Adventures of Akbar artillery.jpg|thumb|An illustration by Byam Shaw from the book The Adventures of Akbar by Flora Annie Steel.

S. Hodgson, ''The Venture of Islam: Conscience and History in a World Civilization'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1974) (\"Hodgson\").</ref> \n\nHogdson applied the term \"gunpowder empire\" to three Islamic political entities he identified as separate from the unstable, geographically limited confederations of Turkic clans that prevailed in post-Mongol times. He called them \"military patronage states of the Later Middle Period,\" which possessed three defining characteristics: first, a legitimization of independent dynastic law; second, the conception of the whole state as a single military force; third, the attempt to explain all economic and high cultural resources as appanages of the chief military families.<ref>Hodgson, 2:405-06.</ref> Connecting these empires were their traditions which grew \"out of Mongol notions of greatness,\" but \"[s]uch notions could fully mature and create stable bureaucratic empires only after gunpowder weapons and their specialized technology attained a primary place in military life.\"<ref>Hodgson, 3:16.</ref>\n\n[[William H. McNeill (historian)|William H. McNeill]] further expanded on the concept of gunpowder empires by arguing that such states \"were able to monopolize the new artillery, central authorities were able to unite larger territories into new, or newly consolidated, empires.\" <ref>William H. McNeill, \u201cThe Age of Gunpowder Empires, 1450\u20131800\u201d in ''Islamic & European Expansion: The Forging of a Global Order'' edited by Michael Adas (pp. 103\u2013139) (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1993) (\u201cMcNeill\u201d), p. 103.</ref> \n\nIn 2011 Douglas E. Streusand criticized the Hodgson-McNeill Gunpowder-Empire hypothesis, calling it into disfavor as a neither \"adequate [n]or accurate\" explanation, although the term remains in use.<ref>Douglas E. Streusand, ''Islamic Gunpowder Empires: Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals'' (Philadelphia: Westview Press, c. 2011) (\"Streusand\"), p. 3.</ref> The main problem he saw with the Hodgson-McNeill theory is that the acquisition of firearms does not seem to have preceded the initial acquisition of territory constituting the imperial critical mass of any of the three early modern Islamic empires, except in the case of the Mughals. Moreover, it seems that the commitment to military autocratic rule pre-dated the acquisition of gunpowder weapons in all three cases. \n\nWhether or not gunpowder was inherently linked to the existence of any of these three empires, it cannot be questioned that each of the three acquired artillery and firearms early in their history and made such weapons an integral part of their military tactics.\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\nIt's not certain when the [[Ottomans]] started using firearms, however it's argued that they had been using cannons since the Battles of Kosovo (1389) and Nukap (1396) and most certainly by the 1420s.{{sfn|Nicolle|1983|p=18}} Some argue that field guns only entered service shortly after the Battle of Varna (1444) and more certainly used in the Second Battle of Kosovo (1448).<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=epaMx7jSZjIC&pg=PA41&dq=ottoman+weapons&hl=en&ei=vgS7TeeJA4mr8APanrjUBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CEUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=ottoman%20artillery&f=false Firearms of the Islamic world in the Tareq Rajab Museum, Kuwait By Robert Elgood]</ref> The arquebus reached them around 1425.{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=443}}\n\n===India and the Mughal Empire===\n\n[[File:Court of Akbar from Akbarnama.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration from the ''[[Akbarnama]]'' written by [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak]] (1551\u20131602) depicts a gun in Akbar's court (bottom center).]]\n\nIn India, guns made of bronze were recovered from [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (1504) and [[Diu, India|Diu]] (1533).{{sfn|Partington|1999|p=226}} By the 17th century, Indians were manufacturing a diverse variety of firearms; large guns in particular, became visible in [[Tanjore]], [[Dacca]], [[Bijapur, Karnataka|Bijapur]] and [[Murshidabad]].{{sfn|Partington|1999|p=225}} [[Gujar\u0101t]] supplied Europe saltpeter for use in gunpowder warfare during the 17th century.<ref name=IndiaBritannica>\"India.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.

Gunpowder blasting followed by dredging of the detritus was a technique which Chen Mu employed to improve the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] at the waterway where it crossed the [[Yellow River]].{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=543}} In Europe gunpowder was utilized in the construction of the [[Canal du Midi]] in Southern France.<ref name = brown-6>Brown (1998), Chapter 6: ''Mining and Civil Engineering''.</ref> It was completed in 1681 and linked the [[Mediterranean]] sea with the [[Atlantic]] with 240&nbsp;km of [[canal]] and 100 locks. Another noteworthy consumer of black powder was the [[Erie canal]] in New York, which was 585&nbsp;km long and took eight years to complete, starting in 1817.<ref name =brown-6/>\n\n===Mining===\nBefore gunpowder was applied to civil engineering, there were two ways to break up large rocks, by hard labor or by heating with large fires followed by rapid quenching. The earliest record for the use of gunpowder in mines comes from Hungary in 1627.<ref name = urbanski>Urbanski (1967). Chapter III: ''Blackpowder''.</ref> It was introduced to Britain in 1638 by German miners, after which records are numerous.<ref name=earl-2>{{Harvcolnb|Earl|1978|loc=Chapter 2: The Development of Gunpowder}}</ref> Until the invention of the [[safety fuse]] by [[William Bickford (1774\u20131834)|William Bickford]] in 1831, the practice was extremely dangerous.<ref name = earl-1>Earl, (1978). Chapter 1: Introduction.</ref><ref name =brown-6/> Another reason for danger were the dense fumes given off and the risk of igniting flammable gas when used in coal mines.\n\n===Tunnel construction===\nBlack powder was also extensively used in railway construction. At first railways followed the contours of the land, or crossed low ground by means of bridges and [[viaduct]]s, but later railways made extensive use of cuttings and tunnels. One 2400-ft stretch of the 5.4&nbsp;mi [[Box Tunnel]] on the [[Great Western Railway]] line between London and [[Bristol]] consumed a [[ton]] of gunpowder per week for over two years.<ref name = brown-6/> The 12.9&nbsp;km long [[Mont Cenis Tunnel]] was completed in 13 years starting in 1857 but, even with black powder, progress was only 25&nbsp;cm a day until the invention of [[Jackhammer|pneumatic drills]] sped up the work.\n\n==United States of America==\n\n===Revolutionary War===\n\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, a number of caves were mined for saltpeter to make gunpowder when supplies from Europe were embargoed.

Published by order of the Committee of Safety of the Colony of New York.</ref>\n\n===Civil War===\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], [[British India]] was the main source for saltpeter for the manufacture of gunpowder for the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union armies]]. This supply was threatened by the British government during the [[Trent Affair]], when Union naval forces stopped a British ship, the RMS Trent, and removed two Confederate diplomats. The British government responded in part by halting all exports of saltpeter to the United States, threatening their gunpowder manufacturing resources. Shortly thereafter, the situation was resolved and the Confederate diplomats were released.\n\nThe Union Navy blockaded the southern [[Confederate States]], which reduced the amount of gunpowder that could be imported from overseas. The Confederate [[Nitre and Mining Bureau]] was formed to produce gunpowder for the army and the navy from domestic resources. Nitre<ref>Wiktionary spells the word \"niter\"</ref> is the English spelling of \"[[Niter]]\". While carbon and sulfur were readily available throughout the south, [[potassium nitrate]] was often produced from the [[Calcium nitrate]] found in cave dirt, tobacco barn floors and barn stalls other places. A number of caves were mined, and the men and boys who worked in the caves were called \"[[peter monkey]]\", \n\n==Decline==\nThe latter half of the 19th century saw the invention of [[nitroglycerin]], [[nitrocellulose]] and [[smokeless powder]]s which soon replaced traditional gunpowder in most civil and military applications.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\n==See also==\n{{refbegin|3}}\n*[[Black powder substitute]]\n*[[Early thermal weapons]]\n*[[Hand cannon]]\n*[[Green mix]]\n*[[Gunpowder warfare]]\n*[[Huolongjing]]\n*[[Jiao Yu]]\n*[[Jixiao Xinshu]]\n*[[Meal powder]]\n*[[Technology of Song Dynasty]]\n*[[Wubei Zhi]]\n*[[Wujing Zongyao]]\n{{refend}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation |last=Adle |first=Chahryar |title=History of Civilizations of Central Asia: Development in Contrast: from the Sixteenth to the Mid-Nineteenth Century |year=2003}}\n* {{Citation |last=\u00c1goston |first=G\u00e1bor |year=2005 |title=Guns for the Sultan: Military Power and the Weapons Industry in the Ottoman Empire |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-60391-1}}\n* {{Citation |last=Agrawal |first=Jai Prakash |title=High Energy Materials: Propellants, Explosives and Pyrotechnics |year=2010 |publisher=Wiley-VCH}}\n* {{Citation |last=Andrade |first=Tonio |year=2016 |title=The Gunpowder Age: China, Military Innovation, and the Rise of the West in World History |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-13597-7}}.\n* {{Citation |last=Arnold |first=Thomas |year=2001 |title=The Renaissance at War |publisher=Cassell & Co |isbn=978-0-304-35270-8}}\n* {{cite book| last = Benton | first = Captain James G. | year = 1862 | title = A Course of Instruction in Ordnance and Gunnery | place = West Point, New York | publisher = Thomas Publications | isbn = 978-1-57747-079-3 | edition = 2|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/BentonJames-1862}}\n* {{Citation |last=Brown |first=G.

Popularly listed as one of the \"[[Four Great Inventions]]\" of [[China]], it was discovered during the late [[Tang dynasty]] (9th century) but [[Wujing Zongyao|the earliest record]] of a written formula appeared in the [[Song dynasty]] (11th century). Knowledge of gunpowder spread rapidly throughout Asia, the Middle East and Europe, possibly as a result of the [[Mongol conquests]] during the 13th century, with written formula for it appearing in the 1267 \n''[[Opus Majus]]'' treatise by [[Roger Bacon]] and a 1280 treatise by [[Hasan al-Rammah]]. It was employed in warfare to some effect from at least the 10th century in weapons such as [[fire arrow]]s, [[bomb]]s, and the [[fire lance]] before the appearance of the [[gun]]. While the fire lance was eventually supplanted by the gun, other gunpowder weapons such as rockets and fire arrows continued to see use in China, Korea, India, and eventually Europe. Bombs too never ceased to develop and continued to progress into the modern day as [[grenades]], [[Land mine|mine]]s, and other explosive implements. Gunpowder has also been used for non-military purposes such as [[firework]]s for entertainment, or in explosives for [[mining]] and [[tunnel]]ing.\n\nThe evolution of [[guns]] led to the development of [[artillery]] during the 15th century, pioneered by states such as the [[Duchy of Burgundy]]. [[Firearms]] came to dominate [[early modern warfare]] in [[Military history of Europe|Europe]] by the 17th century. The gradual improvement of [[cannon]]s firing heavier rounds for a greater impact against fortifications led to the invention of the [[star fort]] and the [[bastion]] in the [[Western world]], where traditional [[city walls]] and [[castle]]s were no longer suitable for defense. The use of gunpowder technology also spread throughout [[Gunpowder Empires|the Islamic world]] and to [[Military history of India|India]], [[Military history of Korea|Korea]], and [[Military history of Japan|Japan]]. The so-called [[Gunpowder Empires]] of the [[early modern period]] consisted of the [[Mughal Empire]], [[Safavid Empire]], and [[Ottoman Empire]].{{Verification needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nThe use of gunpowder in warfare during the course of the 19th century diminished due to the invention of [[smokeless powder]]. Gunpowder is often referred to today as \"[[black powder]]\" to distinguish it from the propellant used in contemporary firearms.{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=18}}\n\n==Chinese beginnings==\n\n[[File:Chinese Bird with Incendiary.JPG|thumb|An expendable bird carrying an incendiary receptacle round its neck.

He described a mixture of three powders that would \"fly and dance\" violently in his ''[[Cantong qi]]'', otherwise known as the ''Book of the Kinship of Three'', a [[Taoist]] text on the subject of alchemy.<ref name=\"WB1\">{{cite web|title=History of Gunpowder|url=https://epicfireworks.com/history-of-gunpowder|accessdate=14 October 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Wei Boyang\">{{cite web|last1=Acosta|first1=Oscar|title=American Firearms Gun History|url=http://www.americanfirearms.org/gun-history/|website=www.americanfirearms.org|publisher=www.americanfirearms.org|accessdate=30 October 2015|ref=AFI}}</ref> Although it is impossible to know if he was actually referring to gunpowder, no other explosive known to scientists is composed of three powders.<ref name =WB1 /> \n\nWhile it was almost certainly not their intention to create a weapon of war, Taoist alchemists continued to play a major role in gunpowder development due to their experiments with [[sulfur]] and [[saltpeter]] involved in searching for eternal life and ways to transmute one material into another.<ref name=WB1 />{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=32}} Historian Peter Lorge notes that despite the early association of gunpowder with Taoism, this may be a quirk of historiography and a result of the better preservation of texts associated with Taoism, rather than being a subject limited to only Taoists.{{sfn|2008|p=32}} The Taoist quest for the elixir of life attracted many powerful patrons, one of whom was [[Emperor Wu of Han]]. One of the resulting alchemical experiments involved heating 10% sulfur and 75% saltpeter to transform them.<ref name=WB1 />\n\nThe next reference to gunpowder occurred in the year 300 during the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)]].<ref name=\"Wei Boyang\"/> A Taoist philosopher by the name of [[Ge Hong]] wrote down the ingredients of gunpowder in his surviving works, collectively known as the ''[[Baopuzi]]'' (\"The Master Who Embraces Simplicity\"). The \"Inner Chapters\" on Taoism contains records of his experiments with heated saltpeter, pine resin, and [[charcoal]] among other carbon materials, resulting in explosion, which most historians acknowledge as an early form of gunpowder.<ref name=\"explosive\">{{cite web|title=The Explosive Quest for Immortality|url=http://scribol.com/anthropology-and-history/history/the-explosive-quest-for-immortality/|accessdate=14 October 2016|date=2010-01-15}}</ref> In 492, Taoist alchemists noted that saltpeter, one of the most important ingredients in gunpowder, burns with a purple flame, allowing for practical efforts at purifying the substance.{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=97}}\n\nThe first confirmed reference to what can be considered gunpowder in China occurred more than three hundred years later during the Tang dynasty, first in a formula contained in the ''Taishang Shengzu Jindan Mijue'' (\u592a\u4e0a\u8056\u7956\u91d1\u4e39\u79d8\u8a23) in 808, and then about 50 years later in a Taoist text known as the ''Zhenyuan miaodao yaol\u00fce'' (\u771f\u5143\u5999\u9053\u8981\u7565).{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=32}} The first formula was a combination of six parts sulfur to six parts saltpeter to one part birthwort herb. The Taoist text warned against an assortment of dangerous formulas, one of which corresponds with gunpowder: \"Some have heated together sulfur, [[realgar]] (arsenic disulfide),\nand saltpeter with honey; smoke [and flames] result, so that their hands and faces have been burnt, and even the whole house burned down.\"{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=32}} Alchemists called this discovery fire medicine (\"huoyao\" \u706b\u85e5), and the term has continued to refer to gunpowder in China into the present day, a reminder of its heritage as a side result in the search for longevity increasing drugs.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=30}}\n\nThe earliest surviving chemical formula of gunpowder dates to 1044 in the form of the military manual ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'', also known in English as the ''Complete Essentials for the Military Classics'', which contains a collection of factoids on Chinese weaponry.{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=118-124}}{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=138}} The ''Wujing Zongyao'' served as a repository of antiquated or fanciful weaponry, and this applied to gunpowder as well, suggesting that it had already been weaponized long before the invention of what would today be considered conventional firearms. These types of gunpowder weapons styles an assortment of odd names such as \"flying incendiary club for subjugating demons\", \"caltrop fire ball\", \"ten-thousand fire flying sand magic bomb\", \"big bees nest\", \"burning heaven fierce fire unstoppable bomb\", \"fire bricks\" which released \"flying swallows\", \"flying rats\", \"fire birds\", and \"fire oxen\". Eventually they gave way and coalesced into a smaller number of dominant weapon types, notably gunpowder arrows, bombs, and guns. This was most likely because some weapons were deemed too onerous or ineffective to deploy.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=16}}\n\n===Fire arrows===\n{{further|Fire arrow}}\nAt this point the formula contained too little saltpeter (about 50%) to be explosive, but the mixture was highly flammable, and contemporary weapons reflected this in their deployment as mainly shock and incendiary weapons. One of the first, if not the first of these weapons was the [[fire arrow]].{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=31}} The first possible reference to the use of fire arrows was by the [[Wu (Ten Kingdoms)|Southern Wu]] in 904 during the siege of [[Nanchang|Yuzhang]]. An officer under [[Yang Xingmi]] by the name of Zheng Fan (\u912d\u74a0) ordered his troops to \"shoot off a machine to let fire and burn the Longsha Gate\", after which he and his troops dashed over the fire into the city and captured it, and he was promoted to Prime Minister Inspectorate for his efforts and the burns his body endured.<ref>\u5929\u4f51\u521d\uff0c\u738b\u8302\u7ae0\u5f81\u5b89\u4ec1\u4e49\u4e8e\u6da6\u5dde\uff0c\u6d0e\u57ce\u9677\uff0c\u4e2d\u5341\u4f59\u521b\uff0c\u4ee5\u529f\u8fc1\u5de6\u5148\u950b\u90fd\u5c09\u3002\u4ece\u653b\u8c6b\u7ae0\uff0c\uff08\u90d1\uff09\u74a0\u4ee5\u6240\u90e8\u53d1\u673a\u300c\u98de\u706b\u300d\uff0c\u70e7\u9f99\u6c99\u95e8\uff0c\u7387\u58ee\u58eb\u7a81\u706b\u5148\u767b\u5165\u57ce\uff0c\u7126\u707c\u88ab\u4f53\uff0c\u4ee5\u529f\u6388\u68c0\u6821\u53f8\u5f92\u3002(Rough Translation: During the beginning of Tianyou Era (904\u2013907), Zheng Fan followed Wang Maozhang under a campaign of Runzhou, which was guarded by rebel An Renyi, he was severely injured by the time it was captured, as the result he was promoted as the Junior General of Left Vanguard. At the campaign of Yuchang, he ordered his troops to propel the \"flying fire\" on the besieged city, after the city-gate of Longsha was burnt, he led his troops dashed over the fire and entered the city, his body was scorched, as the result he was promoted as the Prime Minister of Inspectorate.) Records of Nine Kingdoms ch. 2</ref> A later account of this event corroborated with the report and explained that \"by let fire (\u98db\u706b) is meant things like firebombs and fire arrows.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=31}} Arrows carrying gunpowder were possibly the most applicable form of gunpowder weaponry at the time. Early gunpowder may have only produced an effective flame when exposed to oxygen, thus the rush of air around the arrow in flight would have provided a suitable catalyst for the reaction.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=31}}\n\nThe first fire arrows were arrows strapped with gunpowder incendiaries, but in 969 two Song generals, Yue Yifang and Feng Jisheng (\u99ae\u7e7c\u5347), invented a variant fire arrow which utilized gunpowder tubes as propellants.{{sfn|Liang|2006}} Afterwards fire arrows started transitioning to rocket propelled weapons rather than being fired from a bow.{{sfn|Liang|2006}} These fire arrows were shown to the emperor in 970 when the head of a weapons manufacturing bureau sent Feng Jisheng to demonstrate the gunpowder arrow design, for which he was heavily rewarded. In 975, the state of [[Wuyue]] sent to the Song dynasty a unit of soldiers skilled in the handling of fire arrows and in the same year, the Song used fire arrows to destroy the fleet of [[Southern Tang]]. In 994, the [[Liao dynasty]] attacked the Song and laid siege to Zitong with 100,000 troops. They were repelled with the aid of fire arrows.{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=148}} In 1000 a soldier by the name of Tang Fu (\u5510\u798f) also demonstrated his own designs of gunpowder arrows, gunpowder pots (a proto-bomb which spews fire), and gunpowder caltrops, for which he was richly rewarded as well.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=32}} \n\nThe imperial court took great interest in the progress of gunpowder developments and actively encouraged as well as disseminated military technology. For example, in 1002 a local militia man named Shi Pu (\u77f3\u666e) showed his own versions of fireballs and gunpowder arrows to imperial officials. They were so astounded that the emperor and court decreed that a team would be assembled to print the plans and instructions for the new designs to promulgate throughout the realm.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=32}} The Song court's policy of rewarding military innovators was reported to have \"brought about a great number of cases of people presenting technology and techniques\" (\u5668\u68b0\u6cd5\u5f0f) according to the official ''[[History of Song]]''.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=32}} Production of gunpowder and fire arrows heavily increased in the 11th century as the court centralized the production process, constructing large gunpowder production facilities, hiring artisans, carpenters, and tanners for the military production complex in the capital of [[Kaifeng]]. One surviving source circa 1023 lists all the artisans working in Kaifeng while another notes that in 1083 the imperial court sent 100,000 gunpowder arrows to one garrison and 250,000 to another.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=32}} \n\nEvidence of gunpowder in the [[Liao dynasty]] and [[Western Xia]] is much sparser than in Song, but some evidence such as the Song decree of 1073 that all subjects were henceforth forbidden from trading sulfur and saltpeter across the Liao border, suggests that the Liao were aware of gunpowder developments to the south and coveted gunpowder ingredients of their own.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=32}}\n\n===Explosives===\n[[File:Thunderclap bomb.jpg|thumb|An illustration of a thunderclap bomb as depicted in the 1044 text ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]''.

As depicted in the ''[[Huolongjing]]'', a 14th-century military treatise.]]\n\nThe [[Jurchen people]] of [[Manchuria]] united under [[Wanyan Aguda]] and established the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] in 1115. Allying with the Song, they rose rapidly to the forefront of East Asian powers and defeated the Liao dynasty in a shockingly short span of time, destroying the 150 year balance of power between the Song, Liao, and Western Xia. Remnants of the Liao fled to the west and became known as the [[Qara Khitai]], or Western Liao to the Chinese. In the east, the fragile Song-Jin alliance dissolved once the Jin saw how badly the Song army had performed against Liao forces. Realizing the weakness of Song, the Jin grew tired of waiting and captured all five of the Liao capitals themselves. They proceeded to make war on Song, initiating the [[Jin-Song Wars]]. \n\nFor the first time, two major powers would have access to equally formidable gunpowder weapons.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=34}} Initially the Jin expected their campaign in the south to proceed smoothly given how poorly the Song had fared against the Liao. However they were met with stout resistance upon besieging Kaifeng in 1126 and faced the usual array of gunpowder arrows and fire bombs, but also a weapon called the \"thunderclap bomb\" (\u9739\u9742\u70ae), which one witness wrote, \"At night the thunderclap bombs were used, hitting the lines of the enemy well, and throwing them into great confusion. Many fled, screaming in fright.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=34}} The thunderclap bomb was previously mentioned in the ''Wujing Zongyao'', but this was the first recorded instance of its use. Its description in the text reads thus:\n\n{{quotation|The thunderclap bomb contains a length of two or three internodes of dry bamboo with a diameter of 1.5 in. There must be no cracks, and the septa are to be retained to avoid any leakage. Thirty pieces of thin broken porcelain the size of iron coins are mixed with 3 or 4 lb of gunpowder, and packed around the bamboo tube. The tube is wrapped within the ball, but with about an inch or so protruding at each end. A (gun)powder mixture is then applied all over the outer surface of the ball.{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=163}}|''[[Wujing Zongyao]]''}}\n\nJin troops withdrew with a ransom of Song silk and treasure but returned several months later with their own gunpowder bombs manufactured by captured Song artisans.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=34}} According to historian Wang Zhaochun, the account of this battle provided the \"earliest truly detailed descriptions of the use of gunpowder weapons in warfare.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=34}} Records show that the Jin utilized gunpowder arrows and [[Trebuchet|trebuchets]] to hurl gunpowder bombs while the Song responded with gunpowder arrows, fire bombs, thunderclap bombs, and a new addition called the \"molten metal bomb\" (\u91d1\u6c41\u70ae).{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=35}} As the Jin account describes, when they attacked the city's Xuanhua Gate, their \"fire bombs fell like rain, and their arrows were so numerous as to be uncountable.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=35}} The Jin captured Kaifeng despite the appearance of the molten metal bomb and secured another 20,000 fire arrows for their arsenal.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=35}}\n\nThe molten metal bomb appeared again in 1129 when Song general Li Yanxian (\u674e\u5f65\u4ed9) clashed with Jin forces while defending a strategic pass. The Jin assault lasted day and night without respite, using siege carts, fire carts, and sky bridges, but each assault was met with Song soldiers who \"resisted at each occasion, and also used molten metal bombs. Wherever the gunpowder touched, everything would disintegrate without a trace.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50}}\n\n===Naval bombs===\nGunpowder technology also spread to naval warfare and in 1129 Song decreed that all warships were to be fitted with trebuchets for hurling gunpowder bombs.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=38}} Older gunpowder weapons such as fire arrows were also utilized. In 1159 a Song fleet of 120 ships caught a Jin fleet at anchor near Shijiu Island (\u77f3\u81fc\u5cf6) off the shore of [[Shandong]] peninsula. The Song commander \"ordered that gunpowder arrows be shot from all sides, and wherever they struck, flames and smoke rose up in swirls, setting fire to several hundred vessels.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=39}} Song forces took another victory in 1161 when Song paddle boats ambushed a Jin transport fleet, launched thunderclap bombs, and drowned the Jin force in the [[Yangtze]].{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=39}}\n\n{{quotation|The men inside them paddled fast on the treadmills, and the ships glided forwards as though they were flying, yet no one was visible on board. The enemy thought that they were made of paper. Then all of a sudden\na thunderclap bomb was let off: It was made with paper (carton) and filled with lime and sulphur. (Launched from trebuchets) these thunderclap bombs came dropping down from the air, and upon meeting the water exploded with a noise like thunder, the sulphur bursting into flames. The carton case rebounded and broke, scattering the lime to form a smoky fog which blinded the eyes of men and horses so that they could see nothing. Our ships then went forward to attack theirs, and their men and horses were all drowned, so that they were utterly defeated.{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=166}}|''Hai Qiu Fu''}}\n\nAccording to a minor military official by the name of Zhao Wannian (\u8d99\u842c\u5e74), thunderclap bombs were used again to great effect by the Song during the Jin siege of Xiangyang in 1206\u20131207. Both sides had gunpowder weapons, but the Jin troops only used gunpowder arrows for destroying the city's moored vessels. The Song used fire arrows, fire bombs, and thunderclap bombs. Fire arrows and bombs were used to destroy Jin trebuchets. The thunderclap bombs were used on Jin soldiers themselves, causing foot soldiers and horsemen to panic and retreat. \"We beat our drums and yelled from atop the city wall, and simultaneously fired our thunderclap missiles out from the city walls. The enemy cavalry was terrified and ran away.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=40}} The Jin were forced to retreat and make camp by the riverside. In a rare occurrence, the Song made a successful offensive on Jin forces and conducted a night assault using boats. They were loaded with gunpowder arrows, thunderclap bombs, a thousand crossbowmen, five hundred infantry, and a hundred drummers. Jin troops were surprised in their encampment while asleep by loud drumming, followed by an onslaught of crossbow bolts, and then thunderclap bombs, which caused a panic of such magnitude that they were unable to even saddle themselves and trampled over each other trying to get away. Two to three thousand Jin troops were slaughtered along with eight to nine hundred horses.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=40}}\n\n===Hard-shell explosives===\nThen everything changed when the Jin dynasty attacked, with even better bombs: the iron bomb. Traditionally the inspiration for the development of the iron bomb is ascribed to the tale of a fox hunter named Iron Li. According to the story, around the year 1189 Iron Li developed a new method for hunting foxes which used a ceramic explosive to scare foxes into his nets. The explosive consisted of a ceramic bottle with a mouth, stuffed with gunpowder, and attached with a fuse. Explosive and net were placed at strategic points of places such as watering holes frequented by foxes, and when they got near enough, Iron Li would light the fuse, causing the ceramic bottle to explode and scaring the frightened foxes right into his nets. While a fanciful tale, it's not exactly certain why this would cause the development of the iron bomb, given the explosive was made using ceramics, and other materials such as bamboo or even leather would have done the same job, assuming they made a loud enough noise.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=41}} Nonetheless, the iron bomb made its first appearance in 1221 at the siege of [[Qi Prefecture (Hubei)|Qizhou]] (in modern [[Hubei province]]), and this time it would be the Jin who possessed the technological advantage. The Song command Zhao Yurong (\u8d99\u8207\u8923) survived and was able to relay his account for posterity.\n\nQizhou was a major fortress city situated near the Yangtze and a 25 thousand strong Jin army advanced on it in 1221. News of the approaching army reached Zhao Yurong in Qizhou, and despite being outnumbered nearly eight to one, he decided to hold the city. Qizhou's arsenal consisted of some three thousand thunderclap bombs, twenty thousand \"great leather bombs\" (\u76ae\u5927\u70ae), and thousands of gunpowder arrows and gunpowder crossbow bolts. While the formula for gunpowder had become potent enough to consider the Song bombs to be true explosives, they were unable to match the explosive power of the Jin iron bombs. Yurong describes the uneven exchange thus, \"The barbaric enemy attacked the Northwest Tower with an unceasing flow of catapult projectiles from thirteen catapults. Each catapult shot was followed by an iron fire bomb [catapult shot], whose sound was like thunder. That day, the city soldiers in facing the catapult shots showed great courage as they maneuvered [our own] catapults, hindered by injuries from the iron fire bombs. Their heads, their eyes, their cheeks were exploded to bits, and only one half [of the face] was left.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=42}} Jin artillerists were able to successfully target the command center itself: \"The enemy fired off catapult stones ... nonstop day and night, and the magistrate's headquarters [\u5e33] at the eastern gate, as well as my own quarters ..., were hit by the most iron fire bombs, to the point that they struck even on top of [my] sleeping quarters and [I] nearly perished!

The fighting that ensued would see the first proto-gun, the [[fire lance]], in action - with earliest confirmed employment by Song dynasty forces against the Jin in 1132 during the [[siege of De'an]] (modern [[Anlu]], [[Hubei Province]]),{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=222}}{{sf|Chase|2003|p=31}}{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=33-34}}{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=38}}\n\nThe siege of De'an marks an important transition and landmark in the history of gunpowder weapons as the fire medicine of the fire lances were described using a new word: \"fire bomb medicine\" (\u706b\u70ae\u85e5), rather than simply \"fire medicine.\" This could imply the use of a new more potent formula, or simply an acknowledgement of the specialized military application of gunpowder.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=38}} Peter Lorge suggests that this \"bomb powder\" may have been corned, making it distinct from normal gunpowder.{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=19}} Evidence of gunpowder firecrackers also points to their appearance at roughly around the same time fire medicine was making its transition in the literary imagination.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=39}} \n\nFire lances continued to be used as anti-personnel weapons into the Ming dynasty, and were even attached to battle carts on one situation in 1163. Song commander Wei Sheng constructed several hundred of these carts known as \"at-your-desire-war-carts\" (\u5982\u610f\u6230\u8eca), which contained fire lances protruding from protective covering on the sides. They were used to defend mobile trebuchets that hurled fire bombs.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=38}}\n\n===Hand cannon===\n{{main|Hand cannon}}\nThe early fire lance, considered to be the ancestor of firearms, is not considered a true gun because it did not include projectiles, whereas a gun by definition uses \"the explosive force of the gunpowder to propel a projectile from a tube: cannons, muskets, and pistols are typical examples.\"{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=1}}. Even later on when shrapnel such as ceramics and bits of iron were added to the fire lance, these didn't occlude the barrel, and were only swept along with the discharge rather than making use of [[windage]], and so are referred to as \"co-viatives.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50}} \n\nIn 1259 a type of \"fire-emitting lance\" (\u7a81\u706b\u69cd) made an appearance and according to the ''History of Song'': \"It is made from a large bamboo tube, and inside is stuffed a pellet wad (\u5b50\u7aa0). Once the fire goes off it completely spews the rear pellet wad forth, and the sound is like a bomb that can be heard for five hundred or more paces.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=51}}{{sfn|Partington|1960|p=246}}<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aPQuETESw84C&pg=PA304 |title=Chinese ideas about nature and society: studies in honour of Derk Bodde |first=Derk |last=Bodde |editor=Charles Le Blanc, Susan Blader|accessdate=28 November 2011 |year=1987 |publisher=Hong Kong University Press |isbn=978-962-209-188-7 |page=304 |quote=The other was the 'flame-spouting lance' (t'u huo ch'iang).

From there it branched off into several different gunpowder weapons known as \"eruptors\" in the late 12th and early 13th centuries, with different functions such as the \"filling-the-sky erupting tube\" which spewed out poisonous gas and porcelain shards, the \"orifice-penetrating flying sand magic mist tube\" (\u947d\u7a74\u98db\u7802\u795e\u9727\u7b52) which spewed forth sand and poisonous chemicals into orifices, and the more conventional \"phalanx-charging fire gourd\" which shot out lead pellets.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=51}}\n\nArchaeological samples of the gun, specifically the [[hand cannon]] ([[huochong]]), have been dated starting from the 13th century. The oldest extant gun whose dating is unequivocal is the [[Xanadu Gun]] because it contains an inscription describing its date of manufacture corresponding to 1298. It is so called because it was discovered in the ruins of [[Shangdu|Xanadu]], the Mongol summer palace in Inner Mongolia. The Xanadu Gun is 34.7&nbsp;cm in length and weighs 6.2&nbsp;kg. The design of the gun includes axial holes in its rear which some speculate could have been used in a mounting mechanism. Like most early guns it is small, weighing just over six kilograms and thirty-five centimeters in length.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=52-53}} Although the Xanadu Gun is the most precisely dated gun from the 13th century, other extant samples with approximate dating likely predate it.\n\nAnother specimen, the [[Wuwei Bronze Cannon]], was discovered in 1980 and may possibly be the oldest as well as largest cannon of the 13th century: a 100 centimeter 108 kilogram bronze cannon discovered in a cellar in [[Wuwei, Gansu|Wuwei]], [[Gansu Province]] containing no inscription, but has been dated by historians to the late Western Xia period between 1214 and 1227. The gun contained an iron ball about nine centimeters in diameter, which is smaller than the muzzle diameter at twelve centimeters, and 0.1 kilograms of gunpowder in it when discovered, meaning that the projectile might have been another co-viative.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=53-54}} Ben Sinvany and Dang Shoushan believe that the ball used to be much larger prior to its highly corroded state at the time of discovery.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=330}} While large in size, the weapon is noticeably more primitive than later Yuan dynasty guns, and is unevenly cast. A similar weapon was discovered not far from the discovery site in 1997, but much smaller in size at only 1.5&nbsp;kg.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=54}} Chen Bingying disputes this however, and argues there were no guns before 1259, while Dang Shoushan believes the Western Xia guns point to the appearance of guns by 1220, and Stephen Haw goes even further by stating that guns were developed as early as 1200.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=329}} Sinologist [[Joseph Needham]] and renaissance siege expert Thomas Arnold provide a more conservative estimate of around 1280 for the appearance of the \"true\" cannon.{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=10}}{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=18}} \n\nWhether or not any of these are correct, it seems likely that the gun was born sometime during the 13th century.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=54}}\n\n<center>\n<gallery widths=\"180\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Xixia bronze gun.png|Discovered in 1980, [[Gansu]], late [[Western Xia]] (1214-1227).

Unfortunately textual evidence for this is scant as the Mongols left few documents. This lack of primary source documents has caused some historians and scholars such as Kate Raphael to doubt the Mongol's role in disseminating gunpowder throughout Eurasia. On the opposite side stand historians such as Tonio Andrade and Stephen Haw, who believe that the Mongol Empire not only used gunpowder weapons but deserves the moniker \"the first gunpowder empire.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=327}}\n\n====Conquest of the Jin dynasty====\n{{main|Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty}}\nThe first concerted Mongol invasion of Jin occurred in 1211 and total conquest was not accomplished until 1234. In 1232 the Mongols besieged the Jin capital of Kaifeng and deployed gunpowder weapons along with other more conventional siege techniques such as building stockades, watchtowers, trenches, guardhouses, and forcing Chinese captives to haul supplies and fill moats.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=45}} Jin scholar Liu Qi (\u5289\u7948) recounts in his memoir, \"the attack against the city walls grew increasingly intense, and bombs rained down as [the enemy] advanced.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=45}} The Jin defenders also deployed gunpowder bombs as well as fire arrows (''huo jian'' \u706b\u7bad) launched using a type of early solid-propellant rocket.{{sfn|Liang|2006}} Of the bombs, Liu Qi writes, \"From within the walls the defenders responded with a gunpowder bomb called the heaven-shaking-thunder bomb (\u9707\u5929\u96f7). Whenever the [Mongol] troops encountered one, several men at a time would be turned into ashes.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=45}} \n\nA more fact based and clear description of the bomb exists in the ''[[History of Jin]]'': \"The heaven-shaking-thunder bomb is an iron vessel filled with gunpowder. When lighted with fire and shot off, it goes off like a crash of thunder that can be heard for a hundred li [thirty miles], burning an expanse of land more than half a mu [\u6240\u7207\u570d\u534a\u755d\u4e4b\u4e0a, a mu is a sixth of an acre], and the fire can even penetrate iron armor.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=45}} A Ming official named He Mengchuan would encounter an old cache of these bombs three centuries later in the Xi'an area: \"When I went on official business to Shaanxi Province, I saw on top of Xi'an's city walls an old stockpile of iron bombs. They were called 'heaven-shaking-thunder' bombs, and they were like an enclosed rice bowl with a hole at the top, just big enough to put your finger in. The troops said they hadn't been used for a very long time.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=45}} Furthermore, he wrote, \"When the powder goes off, the bomb rips open, and the iron pieces fly in all directions. That is how it is able to kill people and horses from far away.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=46}}\n\nHeaven-shaking-thunder bombs, also known as thunder crash bombs, were utilized prior to the siege in 1231 when a Jin general made use of them in destroying a Mongol warship, but during the siege the Mongols responded by protecting themselves with elaborate screens of thick cowhide. This was effective enough for workers to get right up to the walls to undermine their foundations and excavate protective niches. Jin defenders countered by tying iron cords and attaching them to heaven-shaking-thunder bombs, which were lowered down the walls until they reached the place where the miners worked. The protective leather screens were unable to withstand the explosion, and were penetrated, killing the excavators.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=46}} \n\nAnother weapon the Jin employed was an improved version of the fire lance called the flying fire lance. The ''History of Jin'' provides a detailed description: \"To make the lance, use chi-huang paper, sixteen layers of it for the tube, and make it a bit longer than two feet. Stuff it with willow charcoal, iron fragments, magnet ends, sulfur, white arsenic [probably an error that should mean saltpeter], and other ingredients, and put a fuse to the end. Each troop has hanging on him a little iron pot to keep fire [probably hot coals], and when it's time to do battle, the flames shoot out the front of the lance more than ten feet, and when the gunpowder is depleted, the tube isn't destroyed.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=46}} While Mongol soldiers typically held a view of disdain toward most Jin weapons, apparently they greatly feared the flying fire lance and heaven-shaking-thunder bomb.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=45}} Kaifeng managed to hold out for a year before the Jin emperor fled and the city capitulated. In some cases Jin troops still fought with some success, scoring isolated victories such as when a Jin commander led 450 fire lancers against a Mongol encampment, which was \"completely routed, and three thousand five hundred were drowned.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=46}} Even after the Jin emperor committed suicide in 1234, one loyalist gathered all the metal he could find in the city he was defending, even gold and silver, and made explosives to lob against the Mongols, but the momentum of the Mongol Empire could not be stopped.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p46-47}} By 1234, both the Western Xia and Jin dynasty had been conquered.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=47}}\n\n====Conquest of the Song dynasty====\n{{main|Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty}}\nThe Mongol war machine moved south and in 1237 attacked the Song city of Anfeng (modern [[Shouxian]], [[Anhui Province]]) \"using gunpowder bombs [huo pao] to burn the [defensive] towers.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=47}} These bombs were apparently quite large. \"Several hundred men hurled one bomb, and if it hit the tower it would immediately smash it to pieces.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=47}} The Song defenders under commander Du Gao (\u675c\u6772) rebuilt the towers and retaliated with their own bombs, which they called the \"Elipao,\" after a famous local pear, probably in reference to the shape of the weapon.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=47}} Perhaps as another point of military interest, the account of this battle also mentions that the Anfeng defenders were equipped with a type of small arrow to shoot through eye slits of Mongol armor, as normal arrows were too thick to penetrate.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=47}}\n\nBy the mid 13th century, gunpowder weapons had become central to the Song war effort. In 1257 the Song official Li Zengbo was dispatched to inspect frontier city arsenals. Li considered an ideal city arsenal to include several hundred thousand iron bombshells, and also its own production facility to produce at least a couple thousand a month. The results of his tour of the border were severely disappointing and in one arsenal he found \"no more than 85 iron bomb-shells, large and small, 95 fire-arrows, and 105 fire-lances. This is not sufficient for a mere hundred men, let alone a thousand, to use against an attack by the ... barbarians. The government supposedly wants to make preparations for the defense of its fortified cities, and to furnish them with military supplies against the enemy (yet this is all they give us). What chilling indifference!\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=47-48}} Fortunately for the Song, [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]] died in 1259 and the war would not continue until 1269 under the leadership of [[Kublai Khan]], but when it did the Mongols came in full force.\n\nBlocking the Mongols' passage south of the Yangtze were the twin fortress cities of Xiangyang and Fancheng. What resulted was one of the longest sieges the world had ever known, lasting from 1268 to 1273. In 1273 the Mongols enlisted the expertise of two Muslim engineers, one from Persia and one from Syria, who helped in the construction of counterweight trebuchets. These new siege weapons had the capability of throwing larger missiles further than the previous traction trebuchets. One account records, \"when the machinery went off the noise shook heaven and earth; every thing that [the missile] hit was broken and destroyed.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=49}} The fortress city of Xiangyang fell in 1273.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50}}\n\nThe next major battle to feature gunpowder weapons was during a campaign led by the Mongol general Bayan, who commanded an army of around two hundred thousand, consisting of mostly Chinese soldiers. It was probably the largest army the Mongols had ever utilized. Such an army was still unable to successfully storm Song city walls, as seen in the 1274 Siege of Shayang. Thus Bayan waited for the wind to change to a northerly course before ordering his artillerists to begin bombarding the city with molten metal bombs, which caused such a fire that \"the buildings were burned up and the smoke and flames rose up to heaven.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50}} Shayang was captured and its inhabitants massacred.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50}}\n\nGunpowder bombs were used again in the 1275 Siege of Changzhou in the latter stages of the Mongol-Song Wars. Upon arriving at the city, Bayan gave the inhabitants an ultimatum: \"if you ... resist us ... we shall drain your carcasses of blood and use them for pillows.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50}} This didn't work and the city resisted anyway, so the Mongol army bombarded them with fire bombs before storming the walls, after which followed an immense slaughter claiming the lives of a quarter million.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50}} The war lasted for only another four years during which some remnants of the Song held up last desperate defenses. In 1277, 250 defenders under Lou Qianxia conducted a suicide bombing and set off a huge iron bomb when it became clear defeat was imminent. Of this, the ''History of Song'' writes, \"the noise was like a tremendous thunderclap, shaking the walls and ground, and the smoke filled up the heavens outside. Many of the troops [outside] were startled to death. When the fire was extinguished they went in to see. There were just ashes, not a trace left.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=50-51}}{{sfn|Partington|1960|p=250, 244, 149}} So came an end to the Mongol-Song Wars, which saw the deployment of all the gunpowder weapons available to both sides at the time, which for the most part meant gunpowder arrows, bombs, and lances, but in retrospect, another development would overshadow them all, the birth of the gun.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=51}}\n\nIn 1280, a large store of gunpowder at [[Weiyang District, Yangzhou|Weiyang]] in [[Yangzhou]] accidentally caught fire, producing such a massive explosion that a team of inspectors at the site a week later deduced that some 100 guards had been killed instantly, with wooden beams and pillars blown sky high and landing at a distance of over 10 [[li (unit)|li]] (~2&nbsp;mi. or ~3&nbsp;km) away from the explosion, creating a crater more than ten feet deep.<ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 7 209 210\" >[[#Needham, V 7|Needham, V 7]], pp.&nbsp;209\u2013210.</ref>\n\nBy the time of [[Jiao Yu]] and his ''[[Huolongjing]]'' (a book that describes military applications of gunpowder in great detail) in the mid 14th century, the explosive potential of gunpowder was perfected, as the level of nitrate in gunpowder formulas had risen from a range of 12% to 91%,<ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 7 345\">[[#Needham, V 7|Needham, V 7]], pp.&nbsp;345.</ref> with at least 6 different formulas in use that are considered to have maximum explosive potential for gunpowder.<ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 7 345\" /> By that time, the Chinese had discovered how to create explosive [[round shot]] by packing their hollow shells with this nitrate-enhanced gunpowder.<ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 7 264\" >[[#Needham, V 7|Needham, V 7]], pp.&nbsp;264.</ref>\n\n====Invasions of Europe and Japan====\n{{main|Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongol invasions of Japan}}\nGunpowder may have been used during the [[Mongol invasions of Europe]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dfCRAAAAIAAJ |title=Hungary |first=Tibor |last=Mende|accessdate=28 November 2011 |year=1944 |publisher=Macdonald & Co.

By 1410, 160 Korean ships were reported to have equipped artillery of some sort. Mortars firing thunder-crash bombs are known to have been used, and four types of cannons are mentioned: chonja (heaven), chija (earth), hyonja (black), and hwangja (yellow), but their specifications are unknown. These cannons typically shot wooden arrows tipped with iron, the longest of which were nine feet long, but stone and iron balls were sometimes used as well.{{sfn|Turnbull|2003|p=20-21}}\n\n===Japan===\n{{see also|Timeline of the gunpowder age in Japan}}\n{{further|Tanegashima (Japanese matchlock)}}\nFirearms seem to have been known in Japan around 1270 as proto-cannons invented in China, which the Japanese called tepp\u014d (\u9244\u7832 lit. \"iron cannon\").{{sfn|Perrin|1979|p=93}} Gunpowder weaponry exchange between China and Japan was slow and only a small number of hand guns ever reached Japan.

Military developments in Europe and the aggressive application of technological advances in this period is usually referred to as [[early modern warfare]], when Europe gained a global advantage in deep-water warfare and fortress architecture.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=5}} Eventually military science in Europe led to a marked technological departure from the rest of the world known as the [[Great Divergence]], a term coined by [[Samuel P. Huntington]]. Gunpowder remained of central importance until it was replaced by more advanced explosives beginning in the 1860s.\n\n===Early Ming firearms===\n{{main|Gunpowder weapons in the Ming dynasty}}\n{{see|Huolongjing|Wubei Zhi}}\nGun development and proliferation in China continued under the Ming dynasty. The success of its founder [[Zhu Yuanzhang]], who declared his reign to be the era of Hongwu, or \"Great Martiality,\" has often been attributed to his effective use of guns. \n\nHowever most early Ming guns weighed only two to three kilograms while guns considered \"large\" at the time weighed around only seventy-five kilograms. Ming sources suggest guns such as these shot stones and iron balls, but were primarily used against men rather than for causing structural damage to ships or walls. Accuracy was low and they were limited to a range of only 50 paces or so.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=59-60}}\n\nDespite the relatively small size of Ming guns, some elements of gunpowder weapon design followed world trends.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=110}} The growing length to muzzle bore ratio matched the rate at which European guns were developing up until the 1450s. The practice of corning gunpowder had been developed by 1370 for the purpose of increasing explosive power in land mines,{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=110}} and was arguably used in guns as well according to one record of a fire-tube shooting a projectile 457 meters, which was probably only possible at the time with the usage of corned powder.{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=16}} Around the same year Ming guns transitioned from using stone shots to iron ammunition, which has greater density and increased firearm power.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=105}}\n\nThe peak of Chinese cannon development is exemplified by the muzzle loading wrought iron \"great general cannon\" (\u5927\u5c07\u8ecd\u70ae) which weighed up to 360 kilograms and could fire a 4.8 kilogram lead ball. Its heavier variant, the \"great divine cannon\" (\u5927\u795e\u9283), could weigh up to 600 kilograms and was capable of firing several iron balls and upward of a hundred iron shots at once. The great general and divine cannons were the last indigenous Chinese cannon designs prior to the incorporation of European models in the 16th century.<ref>{{citation |url=http://greatmingmilitary.blogspot.com/2015/07/da-jiang-jun-pao.html |title=Da Jiang Jun Pao (\u5927\u5c07\u8ecd\u7832) |accessdate=30 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe lack of larger siege weapons in China unlike the rest of the world where cannons grew larger and more potent has been attributed to the immense thickness of traditional Chinese walls,{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=97}} which Tonio Andrade suggests provided no incentive for creating larger cannons, since even industrial artillery had trouble overcoming them.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=66}} Asianist Kenneth also argues that larger guns were not particularly useful against China's traditional enemies: horse nomads.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=111}} \n<center>\n<gallery widths=\"180\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Ming Dynasty field artillery cannon.jpg |An illustration of a bronze \"thousand ball thunder cannon\" from the ''[[Huolongjing]]''.\nFile:Seven barreled organ gun.jpg|A seven barreled organ gun with two auxiliary guns by its side on a two-wheeled carriage.

Originally a minor power, it grew to become one of the most powerful states in 14th-century Europe, and a great innovator in siege warfare. The Duke of Burgundy, [[Philip the Bold]] (1363\u20131404), based his power on the effective use of big guns and promoted research and development in all aspects of gunpowder weaponry technology. Philip established manufacturers and employed more cannon casters than any European power before him.\n\nWhereas most European guns before 1370 weighed about 20 to 40&nbsp;lbs (9\u201314&nbsp;kg), the French siege of [[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte]] in 1375 during the [[Hundred Years War]] saw the use of guns weighing over a [[ton]] (900&nbsp;kg), firing stone balls weighing over 100&nbsp;lbs (45&nbsp;kg).{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=34}} Philip used large guns to help [[Kingdom of France|the French]] capture the fortress of [[Odruik]] in 1377. These guns fired projectiles far larger than any that had been used before, with seven guns that could shoot projectiles as heavy as 90 kilograms. The cannons smashed the city walls, inaugurating a new era of artillery warfare and Burgundy's territories rapidly expanded.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=88-89}}\n\nEurope entered an arms race to build ever larger artillery pieces. By the early 15th century both French and English armies were equipped with larger pieces known as [[bombard (weapon)|bombard]]s, weighing up to 5 tons (4,535&nbsp;kg) and firing balls weighing up to 300&nbsp;lbs (136&nbsp;kg).{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=34}} The artillery trains used by [[Henry V of England]] in the 1415 [[Siege of Harfleur]] and 1419 [[Siege of Rouen]] proved effective in breaching French fortifications, while artillery contributed to the victories of French forces under [[Joan of Arc]] in the [[Loire Campaign (1429)]].{{sfn|Wagner|2006|pp=34\u201335}} \n\nThese weapons were transformational for European warfare. A hundred years earlier the Frenchman Pierre Dubois wrote that a \"castle can hardly be taken within a year, and even if it does fall, it means more expenses for the king's purse and for his subjects than the conquest is worth,\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=90}} but by the 15th century European walls fell with the utmost regularity.\n\nThe [[Ottoman Empire]] was also developing their own artillery pieces. [[Mehmed the Conqueror]] (1432\u20131481) was determined to procure large cannons for the purpose of conquering [[Constantinople]]. Hungarian [[Orban|Urban]] produced for him a six-meter (20 foot) long cannon, which required hundreds of pounds of gunpowder to fire; during the actual [[Siege of Constantinople (1453)|siege of Constantinople]] the gun proved to be somewhat underwhelming.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=94}} However, dozens of other large cannons bombarded [[Walls of Constantinople|Constantinople's walls]] in their weakest sections for 55 days,{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=94}} and despite a fierce defense, the city's fortifications were overwhelmed.\n\n<center>\n<gallery widths=\"180\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Nicopol final battle 1398.jpg|Battle of Nicopolis 1398\nFile:Braunschweig Brunswick Faule Mette.jpg|[[Faule Metze]] ( Metze, old term for a whore)(\"Lazy Mette\"), a medieval supergun from 1411 from [[Braunschweig]], Germany\nImage:Si\u00e8ge d'Orl\u00e9ans (1428).jpg|[[Thomas Montagu, 4th Earl of Salisbury]] is fatally injured at the [[siege of Orl\u00e9ans]] in 1428 (illustration from ''[[Charles VII of France|Vigiles de Charles VII]]'').\nFile:Artillery in the MMB.jpg|[[Faule Magd]] (\"Lazy Maid\"), a medieval cannon from ca. 1410\u20131430.\nFile:Edinburgh Castle, Mons Meg.jpg|[[Mons Meg]], a medieval [[Bombard (weapon)]] built in 1449.\nImage:Dardanelles Gun Turkish Bronze 15c.png|The bronze [[Great Turkish Bombard]], used by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the [[Fall of Constantinople|siege of Constantinople]] in 1453.\n</gallery>\n</center>\n====Changes to fortifications====\n[[File:Palmanova1600.jpg|right|thumb|17th-century map of the city of [[Palmanova]], [[Italy]], an example of a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] star fort]]\n[[File:Shouyuquanshu 1638.jpg|thumb|Chinese angled bastion fort, 1638]]\n{{further|Star fort|Bastion}}\n\nAs a response to gunpowder artillery, European fortifications began displaying architectural principles such as lower and thicker walls in the mid-1400s.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=211}} Cannon towers were built with artillery rooms where cannons could discharge fire from slits in the walls. However this proved problematic as the slow rate of fire, reverberating concussions, and noxious fumes produced greatly hindered defenders. Gun towers also limited the size and number of cannon placements because the rooms could only be built so big. Notable surviving artillery towers include a seven layer defensive structure built in 1480 at [[Foug\u00e8res]] in [[Brittany]], and a four layer tower built in 1479 at Querfurth in Saxony.{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=37}} \n\nThe star fort, also known as the bastion fort, ''trace italienne'', or renaissance fortress, was a style of fortification that became popular in Europe during the 16th century. The bastion and star fort was developed in Italy, where the Florentine engineer [[Giuliano da Sangallo]] (1445\u20131516) compiled a comprehensive defensive plan using the geometric [[bastion]] and full ''trace italienne'' that became widespread in Europe.{{sfn|Nolan|2006|p=67}} \n\nThe main distinguishing features of the star fort were its angle bastions, each placed to support their neighbor with lethal crossfire, covering all angles, making them extremely difficult to engage with and attack. Angle bastions consisted of two faces and two flanks. Artillery positions positioned at the flanks could fire parallel into the opposite bastion's line of fire, thus providing two lines of cover fire against an armed assault on the wall, and preventing mining parties from finding refuge. Meanwhile, artillery positioned on the bastion platform could fire frontally from the two faces, also providing overlapping fire with the opposite bastion.{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=40}} Overlapping mutually supporting defensive fire was the greatest advantage enjoyed by the star fort. As a result, sieges lasted longer and became more difficult affairs. By the 1530s the bastion fort had become the dominant defensive structure in Italy.{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=45}} \n\nOutside Europe, the star fort became an \"engine of European expansion,\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=211}} and acted as a force multiplier so that small European garrisons could hold out against numerically superior forces. Wherever star forts were erected the natives experienced great difficulty in uprooting European invaders.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=211}}\n\nIn China, [[Sun Yuanhua]] advocated for the construction of angled [[bastion forts]] in his ''Xifashenji'' so that their cannons could better support each other. The officials Han Yun and Han Lin noted that cannons on square forts could not support each side as well as bastion forts. Their efforts to construct bastion forts and their results were inconclusive. Ma Weicheng built two bastion forts in his home county, which helped fend off a [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] incursion in 1638. By 1641, there were ten bastion forts in the county. Before bastion forts could be spread any further, the Ming dynasty fell in 1644, and they were largely forgotten as the Qing dynasty was on the offensive most of the time and had no use for them.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=214}}\n\n===Perfection of the cannon===\n\nGun development and design in Europe reached its \"classic\" form in the 1480s - longer, lighter, more efficient, and more accurate compared to its predecessors only three decades prior. The design persisted, and cannons of the 1480s show little difference and surprising similarity with cannons three centuries later in the 1750s. This 300-year period during which the classic cannon dominated gives it its moniker.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=103-104}} \n                                                       \nThe early classical European guns are exemplified by two cannons from 1488 now preserved in a plaza in Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland. The Neuch\u00e2tel guns are 224 centimeters long, with a bore of 6.2 centimeters and the other is slightly longer, 252 centimeters, with the same bore size. They are differentiated from older firearms by an assortment of improvements. Their longer length-to-bore ratio imparts more energy into the shot, enabling the projectile to shoot further. Not only longer, they were also lighter as the barrel walls were made thinner to allow for faster dissipation of heat. They also no longer needed the help of a wooden plug to load since they offered a tighter fit between projectile and barrel, further increasing the accuracy of gunpowder warfare{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=104-106}} - and were deadlier due to developments such as gunpowder corning and iron shot. When these guns reached China in the 1510s, the Chinese were highly impressed by them, primarily for their longer and thinner barrels.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=107}}\n\nThe two primary theories for the appearance of the classic gun involve the development of gunpowder corning and a new method for casting guns. \n\nThe corning hypothesis stipulates that the longer barrels came about as a reaction to the development of corned gunpowder. Not only did \"corned\" powder keep better, because of its reduced surface area, but gunners also found that it was more powerful and easier to load into guns. Prior to corning, gunpowder would also frequently demix into its constitutive components and was therefore unreliable.<ref>Molerus, Otto. \"History of Civilization in the Western Hemisphere from the Point of View of Particulate Technology, Part 2,\" Advanced Powder Technology 7 (1996): 161\u201366.</ref> The faster gunpowder reaction was suitable for smaller guns, since large ones had a tendency to crack, and the more controlled reaction allowed large guns to have longer, thinner walls.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=109}} However, the corning hypothesis has been argued against on two grounds: One, the powder makers were probably more worried about spoilage than the effect of corned gunpowder on guns; and Two, corning as a practice had existed in China since the 1370s.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=110}} \n\nThe second theory is that the key to developing the classic gun may have been a new method of gun casting, muzzle side up.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=111}} Smith observes: \"The surviving pieces of ordnance from earlier in the 15th century are big pieces with large bore sizes. They do not look like the long thin gun.\u2026 Essentially they are parallel-sided tubes with flat ends. The explanation is, probably, that they were cast muzzle down in the traditional bell-founding method whereas the long thin guns were cast muzzle up.\u2026 Perhaps this marks the real 'revolution' in artillery. Once the technique of casting muzzle up with the attendant advantages, and it is not clear what those are at present, had been mastered by cannon founders, the way was open for the development of the 'classic' form of artillery.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=111}} However, Smith himself states that it is not clear what advantages this technique would have conferred, despite its widespread adoption.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=111}}\n\n<center>\n<gallery widths=\"180\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:16th Century Artillerie.jpg|16th-century Artillerie\nFile:French bastard culverin 1548 with arms of Henri II and Catherine de Medicis and crescent of Diane 85mm 300cm 1076kg.jpg|French bastard culverin dated to 1548, 85mm 300cm 1076kg.\nFile:Coulevrine Etudes-3 P.172 2-3.png|Two 15th-century culverins, one of forged iron, the other of cast bronze.\nFile:Canon Gribeauval 1780 front.jpg|18th-century [[Military history of France|French cannon]]\nFile:Gunpowder1.png|Different shapes of corned gunpowder, each with its own function\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n====Iron ''vs'' bronze====\n[[File:Ding liao da jiang jun.png|thumb|Ding Liao Da Jiangjun, a composite cast iron/cast bronze cannon.

The wrought iron cannon and the cast-bronze cannon. Wrought iron guns were structurally composed of two layers: an inner tube of iron staves held together in a tight fit by an outer case of iron hoops. Bronze cannons on the other hand were cast in one piece similar to bells. The technique used in casting bronze cannons was so similar to the bell that the two were often looked upon as a connected enterprise. \n\nBoth iron and bronze cannons had their advantages and disadvantages. Forged iron cannons were up to ten times cheaper, but more unstable due to their piece built nature. Even without use, iron cannons were liable to rust away, while bronze cannons did not. Another reason for the dominance of bronze cannons was their aesthetic appeal. Because cannons were so important as displays of power and prestige, rulers liked to commission bronze cannons, which could be sculpted into fanciful designs containing artistic motifs or symbols. It was for all these reasons that the cast-bronze cannon became the preferred type by the late 1400s.{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=27}}\n\nComposite iron/bronze cannons were far less common, but were produced in the Ming and Qing dynasties and were considered \"among the best in the world\" during the 17th century.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=202}} The Gujarats experimented with the same concept in 1545, the English at least by 1580, and Hollanders in 1629.

Its name is derived from the German word ''Hackenb\u00fcchse''. Although the term ''arquebus'' was applied to many different forms of firearms from the 15th to 17th centuries, it was originally used to describe \"a hand-gun with a hook-like projection or lug on its under surface, useful for steadying it against battlements or other objects when firing.\"{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=426}} These \"hook guns\" were in their earliest forms defensive weapons mounted on German city walls in the early 1400s, but by the late 1400s had transitioned into handheld firearms, with heavier variants known as \"muskets\" that were fired from resting Y-shaped supports appearing by the early 1500s. \n\nThe musket was able to penetrate all forms of armor available at the time, making armor obsolete, and as a consequence the heavy musket as well. Although there is relatively little to no difference in design between arquebus and musket except in size and strength, it was the term ''musket'' which remained in use up into the 1800s.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=61}} It may not be completely inaccurate to suggest that the musket was in its fabrication simply a larger arquebus. At least on one occasion the musket and arquebus have been used interchangeably to refer to the same weapon,{{sfn|Adle|2003|p=475}} and even referred to as an \"arquebus musket.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=165}} A Habsburg commander in the mid-1560s once referred to muskets as \"double arquebuses.\"{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=92}} The definition of arquebus and similar firearms is therefore quite convoluted as the term has been applied to different sorts of firearms as well as acquiring several names like ''hackbut,''{{sfn|Purton|2010|p=422}} ''harquebus'', ''schiopo,''{{sfn|Purton|2010|p=427}} ''sclopus,''{{sfn|Purton|2010|p=117}} ''t\u00fcfenk'',{{sfn|\u00c1goston|2005|p=19}} ''tofak'',{{sfn|\u00c1goston|2005|p=58}} ''matchlock'', and ''firelock''.{{sfn|Lidin|2002|p=3}} Some say that the hackbut was a forerunner of the arquebus.{{sfn|Purton|2010|p=425}}\n\nThe dating of the ''matchlock'' firing mechanism's first appearance is disputed. The first references to the use of what may have been arquebuses (''t\u00fcfek'') by the [[Janissary]] corps of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Ottoman army|army]] date them from 1394 to 1465.{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=443}}  However it's unclear whether these were arquebuses or small cannons as late as 1444, but the fact that they were listed separate from cannons in mid-15th century inventories suggest they were handheld firearms.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=\u00c1goston |first1=G\u00e1bor |title=Military Transformation in the Ottoman Empire and Russia, 1500\u20131800 |journal=Kritika: Explorations in Russian and Eurasian History |date=2011 |volume=12 |issue=2 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254954728_Military_Transformation_in_the_Ottoman_Empire_and_Russia_1500-1800 |pages=281\u2013319 [294] |doi=10.1353/kri.2011.0018|quote=Initially the  Janissaries were equipped with bows, crossbows, and javelins.

The matchlock arquebus was the first firearm equipped with a trigger mechanism..{{sfn|Phillips|2016}}{{sfn|Petzal|2014|p=5}} It is also considered to be the first portable shoulder-arms firearm.{{sfn|Partington|1999|p=xxvii}}\n\nMatchlock became a common term for the arquebus after it was added to the firearm. Prior to the appearance of the matchlock, handguns were fired from the chest, tucked under one arm, while the other arm maneuvered a hot pricker to the touch hole to ignite the gunpowder.{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=75}} The matchlock changed this by adding a firing mechanism consisting of two parts, the match, and the lock. The lock mechanism held within a clamp a two to three feet long length of smoldering rope soaked in saltpeter, which was the match.{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=75}} Connected to the lock lever was a trigger, which lowered the match into a priming pan when pulled, igniting the priming powder, causing a flash to travel through the touch hole, also igniting the gunpowder within the barrel, and propelling the bullet out the muzzle.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=24}} \n\nWhile matchlocks provided a crucial advantage by allowing the user to aim the firearm using both hands, it was also awkward to utilize.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=25}} To avoid accidentally igniting the gunpowder the match had to be detached while loading the gun. In some instances the match would also go out, so both ends of the match were kept lit. This proved cumbersome to maneuver as both hands were required to hold the match during removal, one end in each hand. The procedure was so complex that a 1607 drill manual published by Jacob de Gheyn in the Netherlands listed 28 steps just to fire and load the gun.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=25}} In 1584 the Ming general [[Qi Jiguang]] composed an 11 step song to practice the procedure in rhythm: \"One, clean the gun. Two pour the powder. Three tamp the powder down. Four drop the pellet. Five drive the pellet down. Six put in paper (stopper). Seven drive the paper down. Eight open the flashpan cover. Nine pour in the flash powder. Ten close the flashpan, and clamp the fuse. Eleven, listen for the signal, then open the flashpan cover. Aiming at the enemy, raise your gun and fire.\"{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=176-175}} Reloading a gun during the 16th century took anywhere from between 20 seconds to a minute under the most ideal conditions.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=144}}\n\nThe arquebus is considered to be the first portable \"shoulder\" arms firearm.{{sfn|Partington|1999|p=xxvii}} Arquebuses were used as early as 1472 by the Spanish and Portuguese at Zamora. Likewise, the Castilians used arquebuses as well in 1476.{{sfn|Partington|1999|p=123}} In 1496 Philip Monch of the Palatinate composed an illustrated ''Buch der Strynt un(d) Buchsse(n)'' on guns and \"harquebuses.\"{{sfn|Partington|1999|p=160}} The Mamluks in particular were conservatively against the incorporation of gunpowder weapons. When faced with cannons and arquebuses wielded by the Ottomans they criticized them thus, \"God curse the man who invented them, and God curse the man who fires on Muslims with them.\"{{sfn|Partington|1999|p=208}} Insults were also levied against the Ottomans for having \"brought with you this contrivance artfully devised by the Christians of Europe when they were incapable of meeting the Muslim armies on the battlefield.\"{{sfn|Partington|1999|p=208}} Similarly, [[musketeer]]s and musket-wielding infantrymen were despised in society by the [[feudal]] [[knight]]s, even until the time of [[Cervantes]] (1547\u20131616 AD).<ref name=\"khan 6\">{{Harvcolnb|Khan|2004|p=6}}</ref> Eventually the Mamluks under [[Qaitbay]] were ordered in 1489 to train in the use of al-bunduq al-rasas (arquebuses). However, in 1514 an Ottoman army of 12,000 soldiers wielding arquebuses still managed to rout a much larger Mamluk force.{{sfn|Partington|1999|p=208}} The arquebus had become a common infantry weapon by the 16th century due to its relative cheapness \u2013 a helmet, breastplate and pike cost about three and a quarter ducats while an arquebus only a little over one ducat.{{sfn|Purton|2010|p=422}}{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=44}} Another advantage of arquebuses over other equipment and weapons was its short training period. While a bow potentially took years to master, an effective arquebusier could be trained in just two weeks.{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=74}} According to a 1571 report by Vincentio d'Alessandri, Persian arms including arquebuses \"were superior and better tempered than those of any other nation.\"{{sfn|Adle|2003|p=475}}\n\nIn the early 1500s a larger arquebus known as the musket appeared. The heavy musket, while being rather awkward to handle, requiring a fork rest to fire properly, had the advantage of being able to penetrate the best armor within a range of 180 meters, regular armor at 365 meters, and an unarmed man at 548 meters. However, both the musket and arquebus were effectively limited to a range of only 90 to 185 meters regardless of armor since they were incredibly inaccurate.{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=75-78}} According to some sources, a smoothbore musket was completely incapable of hitting a man sized target past the 73 meter mark.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=74}} While rifled guns did exist at this time in the form of grooves cut into the interior of a barrel, these were considered specialist weapons and limited in number.{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=75-78}} In some aspects this made the smoothbore musket an inferior weapon compared to the bow. The average Mamluk archer for example was capable of hitting targets only 68 meters far away but could keep up a pace of six to eight shots per minute. In comparison, sixteenth-century matchlocks fired off one shot every several minutes, and much less when taking into consideration misfires and malfunctions which occurred up to half the time. This is not to say that firearms of the 16th century were inferior to the bow and arrow, for it could better penetrate armor and required less training, but the disadvantages of the musket were very real, and it would not be until the 1590s that archers were for the most part phased out of ''European'' warfare.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=74}} This was possibly a consequence of the increased effectiveness of musket warfare due to the rise of volley fire in Europe as first applied by the Dutch.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=75}} At this time gunners in European armies reached as high as 40 percent of infantry forces.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=167}}\n\nAs the virtues of the musket became apparent it was quickly adopted throughout Eurasia so that by 1560 even in China generals were giving praise to the new weapon. Qi Jiguang, a noted partisan of the musket, gave a eulogy on the effectiveness of the gun in 1560:\n\n{{quotation|It is unlike any other of the many types of fire weapons. In strength it can pierce armor. In accuracy it can strike the center of targets, even to the point of hitting the eye of a coin [i.e., shooting right through a coin], and not just for exceptional shooters.\u2026 The arquebus [\u9ce5\u9283] is such a powerful weapon and is so accurate that even bow and arrow cannot match it, and \u2026 nothing is so strong as to be able to defend against it.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=172}}|''Jixiao Xinshu''}}\n\nOther [[East Asian]] powers such as [[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t]] also adopted the matchlock musket in quick order. \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t in particular was considered by the Ming to have produced the most advanced matchlocks in the world during the 17th century, surpassing even Ottoman, Japanese, and European firearms. European observers of the [[Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n War]] also corroborated with the Ming in the proficiency of matchlock making by the Vietnamese. The Vietnamese matchlock was said to have been able to pierce several layers of iron armour, kill two to five men in one shot, yet also fire quietly for a weapon of its caliber.<ref>{{citation |url=http://greatmingmilitary.blogspot.com/2014/11/matchlock-of-ming-dynasty.html |title=Matchlock firearms of the Ming Dynasty |accessdate=25 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Gunpowder Empires==\n\n[[File:The Adventures of Akbar artillery.jpg|thumb|An illustration by Byam Shaw from the book The Adventures of Akbar by Flora Annie Steel.

S. Hodgson, ''The Venture of Islam: Conscience and History in a World Civilization'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1974) (\"Hodgson\").</ref> \n\nHogdson applied the term \"gunpowder empire\" to three Islamic political entities he identified as separate from the unstable, geographically limited confederations of Turkic clans that prevailed in post-Mongol times. He called them \"military patronage states of the Later Middle Period,\" which possessed three defining characteristics: first, a legitimization of independent dynastic law; second, the conception of the whole state as a single military force; third, the attempt to explain all economic and high cultural resources as appanages of the chief military families.<ref>Hodgson, 2:405-06.</ref> Connecting these empires were their traditions which grew \"out of Mongol notions of greatness,\" but \"[s]uch notions could fully mature and create stable bureaucratic empires only after gunpowder weapons and their specialized technology attained a primary place in military life.\"<ref>Hodgson, 3:16.</ref>\n\n[[William H. McNeill (historian)|William H.

Streusand criticized the Hodgson-McNeill Gunpowder-Empire hypothesis, calling it into disfavor as a neither \"adequate [n]or accurate\" explanation, although the term remains in use.<ref>Douglas E. Streusand, ''Islamic Gunpowder Empires: Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals'' (Philadelphia: Westview Press, c. 2011) (\"Streusand\"), p. 3.</ref> The main problem he saw with the Hodgson-McNeill theory is that the acquisition of firearms does not seem to have preceded the initial acquisition of territory constituting the imperial critical mass of any of the three early modern Islamic empires, except in the case of the Mughals. Moreover, it seems that the commitment to military autocratic rule pre-dated the acquisition of gunpowder weapons in all three cases. \n\nWhether or not gunpowder was inherently linked to the existence of any of these three empires, it cannot be questioned that each of the three acquired artillery and firearms early in their history and made such weapons an integral part of their military tactics.\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\nIt's not certain when the [[Ottomans]] started using firearms, however it's argued that they had been using cannons since the Battles of Kosovo (1389) and Nukap (1396) and most certainly by the 1420s.{{sfn|Nicolle|1983|p=18}} Some argue that field guns only entered service shortly after the Battle of Varna (1444) and more certainly used in the Second Battle of Kosovo (1448).<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=epaMx7jSZjIC&pg=PA41&dq=ottoman+weapons&hl=en&ei=vgS7TeeJA4mr8APanrjUBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CEUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=ottoman%20artillery&f=false Firearms of the Islamic world in the Tareq Rajab Museum, Kuwait By Robert Elgood]</ref> The arquebus reached them around 1425.{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=443}}\n\n===India and the Mughal Empire===\n\n[[File:Court of Akbar from Akbarnama.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration from the ''[[Akbarnama]]'' written by [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak]] (1551\u20131602) depicts a gun in Akbar's court (bottom center).]]\n\nIn India, guns made of bronze were recovered from [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (1504) and [[Diu, India|Diu]] (1533).{{sfn|Partington|1999|p=226}} By the 17th century, Indians were manufacturing a diverse variety of firearms; large guns in particular, became visible in [[Tanjore]], [[Dacca]], [[Bijapur, Karnataka|Bijapur]] and [[Murshidabad]].{{sfn|Partington|1999|p=225}} [[Gujar\u0101t]] supplied Europe saltpeter for use in gunpowder warfare during the 17th century.<ref name=IndiaBritannica>\"India.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.

This supply was threatened by the British government during the [[Trent Affair]], when Union naval forces stopped a British ship, the RMS Trent, and removed two Confederate diplomats. The British government responded in part by halting all exports of saltpeter to the United States, threatening their gunpowder manufacturing resources. Shortly thereafter, the situation was resolved and the Confederate diplomats were released.\n\nThe Union Navy blockaded the southern [[Confederate States]], which reduced the amount of gunpowder that could be imported from overseas. The Confederate [[Nitre and Mining Bureau]] was formed to produce gunpowder for the army and the navy from domestic resources. Nitre<ref>Wiktionary spells the word \"niter\"</ref> is the English spelling of \"[[Niter]]\". While carbon and sulfur were readily available throughout the south, [[potassium nitrate]] was often produced from the [[Calcium nitrate]] found in cave dirt, tobacco barn floors and barn stalls other places. A number of caves were mined, and the men and boys who worked in the caves were called \"[[peter monkey]]\", somewhat in imitation of the naval term \"[[powder monkey]]\" that was used for the boys who brought up charges of gunpowder on gunboats.<ref>Hadden, R.

He was born in 1380, in [[Kashan]], in central Iran. This region was controlled by [[Timur|Tamerlane]], better known as Timur.\n\nThe situation changed for the better when Timur died in 1405, and his son, [[Shah Rukh (Timurid dynasty)|Shah Rokh]], ascended into power. Shah Rokh and his wife, [[Goharshad]], a Turkish princess, were very interested in the [[sciences]], and they encouraged their court to study the various fields in great depth. Consequently, the period of their power became one of many scholarly accomplishments. This was the perfect environment for al-Kashi to begin his career as one of the world's greatest mathematicians.\n\nEight years after he came into power in 1409, their son, [[Ulugh Beg]], founded an institute in [[Samarkand]] which soon became a prominent university. Students from all over the [[Middle East]], and beyond, flocked to this academy in the capital city of Ulugh Beg's empire. Consequently, Ulugh Beg gathered many great mathematicians and scientists of the [[Middle East]]. In 1414, al-Kashi took this opportunity to contribute vast amounts of knowledge to his people. His best work was done in the court of Ulugh Beg.\n\nAl-Kashi was still working on his book, called \u201cRisala al-watar wa\u2019l-jaib\u201d meaning \u201cThe Treatise on the Chord and Sine\u201d, when he died, probably in 1429. Some scholars believe that Ulugh Beg may have ordered his murder, because he went against Islamic theologians.\n\n==Astronomy==\n\n===''Khaqani Zij''===\nAl-Kashi produced a ''[[Zij]]'' entitled the ''Khaqani Zij'', which was based on [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]]'s earlier ''[[Zij-i Ilkhani]]''. In his ''Khaqani Zij'', al-Kashi thanks the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] sultan and mathematician-astronomer [[Ulugh Beg]], who invited al-Kashi to work at his [[observatory]] (see [[Islamic astronomy]]) and his [[university]] (see [[Madrasah]]) which taught [[Kalam|theology]]. Al-Kashi produced [[Trigonometric functions|sine]] tables to four [[sexagesimal]] digits (equivalent to eight [[decimal]] places) of accuracy for each degree and includes differences for each minute. He also produced tables dealing with transformations between [[coordinate system]]s on the [[celestial sphere]], such as the transformation from the [[ecliptic coordinate system]] to the [[equatorial coordinate system]].<ref name=MacTutor/>\n\n===''Astronomical Treatise on the size and distance of heavenly bodies''===\nHe wrote the book [[Sullam al-Sama]] on the resolution of difficulties met by predecessors in the determination of distances and sizes of [[Astronomical object|heavenly bodies]] such as the [[Earth]], the [[Moon]], the [[Sun]] and the [[Stars]].\n\n===''Treatise on Astronomical Observational Instruments''===\nIn 1416, al-Kashi wrote the ''Treatise on Astronomical Observational Instruments'', which described a variety of different instruments, including the [[Triquetrum (astronomy)|triquetrum]] and [[armillary sphere]], the [[Equinox|equinoctial]] armillary and [[Solstice|solsticial]] armillary of [[Mo'ayyeduddin Urdi]], the [[sine]] and [[versine]] instrument of Urdi, the [[Sextant (astronomical)|sextant]] of [[al-Khujandi]], the Fakhri sextant at the [[Samarqand]] observatory, a double quadrant [[Azimuth]]-[[altitude]] instrument he invented, and a small armillary sphere incorporating an [[alhidade]] which he invented.<ref>{{Harv|Kennedy|1951|pp=104\u2013107}}</ref>\n\n====Plate of Conjunctions====\nAl-Kashi invented the Plate of Conjunctions, an [[Analog computer|analog computing]] instrument used to determine the time of day at which [[planetary conjunction]]s will occur,<ref>{{Harv|Kennedy|1947|p=56}}</ref> and for performing [[linear interpolation]].<ref name=Kennedy/>\n\n====Planetary computer====\nAl-Kashi also invented a mechanical planetary [[Analog computer|computer]] which he called the Plate of Zones, which could graphically solve a number of planetary problems, including the prediction of the true positions in [[longitude]] of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]],<ref name=Kennedy>{{Harv|Kennedy|1950}}</ref> and the [[planet]]s in terms of [[elliptical orbit]]s;<ref>{{Harv|Kennedy|1952}}</ref> the [[latitude]]s of the Sun, Moon, and planets; and the [[ecliptic]] of the Sun.

He was born in 1380, in [[Kashan]], in central Iran. This region was controlled by [[Timur|Tamerlane]], better known as Timur.\n\nThe situation changed for the better when Timur died in 1405, and his son, [[Shah Rukh (Timurid dynasty)|Shah Rokh]], ascended into power. Shah Rokh and his wife, [[Goharshad]], a Turkish princess, were very interested in the [[sciences]], and they encouraged their court to study the various fields in great depth. Consequently, the period of their power became one of many scholarly accomplishments. This was the perfect environment for al-Kashi to begin his career as one of the world's greatest mathematicians.\n\nEight years after he came into power in 1409, their son, [[Ulugh Beg]], founded an institute in [[Samarkand]] which soon became a prominent university. Students from all over the [[Middle East]], and beyond, flocked to this academy in the capital city of Ulugh Beg's empire. Consequently, Ulugh Beg gathered many great mathematicians and scientists of the [[Middle East]]. In 1414, al-Kashi took this opportunity to contribute vast amounts of knowledge to his people. His best work was done in the court of Ulugh Beg.\n\nAl-Kashi was still working on his book, called \u201cRisala al-watar wa\u2019l-jaib\u201d meaning \u201cThe Treatise on the Chord and Sine\u201d, when he died, probably in 1429. Some scholars believe that Ulugh Beg may have ordered his murder, because he went against Islamic theologians.\n\n==Astronomy==\n\n===''Khaqani Zij''===\nAl-Kashi produced a ''[[Zij]]'' entitled the ''Khaqani Zij'', which was based on [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]]'s earlier ''[[Zij-i Ilkhani]]''. In his ''Khaqani Zij'', al-Kashi thanks the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] sultan and mathematician-astronomer [[Ulugh Beg]], who invited al-Kashi to work at his [[observatory]] (see [[Islamic astronomy]]) and his [[university]] (see [[Madrasah]]) which taught [[Kalam|theology]]. Al-Kashi produced [[Trigonometric functions|sine]] tables to four [[sexagesimal]] digits (equivalent to eight [[decimal]] places) of accuracy for each degree and includes differences for each minute. He also produced tables dealing with transformations between [[coordinate system]]s on the [[celestial sphere]], such as the transformation from the [[ecliptic coordinate system]] to the [[equatorial coordinate system]].<ref name=MacTutor/>\n\n===''Astronomical Treatise on the size and distance of heavenly bodies''===\nHe wrote the book [[Sullam al-Sama]] on the resolution of difficulties met by predecessors in the determination of distances and sizes of [[Astronomical object|heavenly bodies]] such as the [[Earth]], the [[Moon]], the [[Sun]] and the [[Stars]].\n\n===''Treatise on Astronomical Observational Instruments''===\nIn 1416, al-Kashi wrote the ''Treatise on Astronomical Observational Instruments'', which described a variety of different instruments, including the [[Triquetrum (astronomy)|triquetrum]] and [[armillary sphere]], the [[Equinox|equinoctial]] armillary and [[Solstice|solsticial]] armillary of [[Mo'ayyeduddin Urdi]], the [[sine]] and [[versine]] instrument of Urdi, the [[Sextant (astronomical)|sextant]] of [[al-Khujandi]], the Fakhri sextant at the [[Samarqand]] observatory, a double quadrant [[Azimuth]]-[[altitude]] instrument he invented, and a small armillary sphere incorporating an [[alhidade]] which he invented.<ref>{{Harv|Kennedy|1951|pp=104\u2013107}}</ref>\n\n====Plate of Conjunctions====\nAl-Kashi invented the Plate of Conjunctions, an [[Analog computer|analog computing]] instrument used to determine the time of day at which [[planetary conjunction]]s will occur,<ref>{{Harv|Kennedy|1947|p=56}}</ref> and for performing [[linear interpolation]].<ref name=Kennedy/>\n\n====Planetary computer====\nAl-Kashi also invented a mechanical planetary [[Analog computer|computer]] which he called the Plate of Zones, which could graphically solve a number of planetary problems, including the prediction of the true positions in [[longitude]] of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]],<ref name=Kennedy>{{Harv|Kennedy|1950}}</ref> and the [[planet]]s in terms of [[elliptical orbit]]s;<ref>{{Harv|Kennedy|1952}}</ref> the [[latitude]]s of the Sun, Moon, and planets; and the [[ecliptic]] of the Sun.

In 1914, Southern Nigeria was joined with [[Northern Nigeria Protectorate]] to form the single colony of Nigeria. The unification was done for [[economic]] reasons rather than [[political]]\u2014[[Northern Nigeria Protectorate]] had a [[Government budget deficit|budget deficit]]; and the colonial administration sought to use the budget surpluses in Southern Nigeria to offset this deficit.<ref name=\"WorldBank\">{{cite web |url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/442501468780898611/Nigeria-State-and-local-governance-in-Nigeria |title=State and Local Governance in Nigeria |first3=Mike|last3=Stevens |first1=Joel D.|last1= Barkan |first2=Alex |last2=Gboyega |date=August 2, 2001 |work=Public Sector and Capacity Building Program: Africa Region |publisher=[[The World Bank]] |page=1 |accessdate= |quote=March 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Frederick Lugard|Sir Frederick Lugard]], who took office as governor of both protectorates in 1912, was responsible for overseeing the unification, and he became ouija understood blockage sewer the first governor of the newly united territory. Lugard established several central institutions to anchor the evolving unified structure.  A Central Secretariat was instituted at [[Lagos]], which was the seat of government, and the [[Nigerian Council]] (later the Legislative Council), was founded to provide a forum for representatives drawn from the provinces.  Certain services were integrated across the Northern and Southern Provinces because of their national significance\u2014military, treasury, audit, posts and telegraphs, railways, survey, medical services, judicial and legal departments\u2014and brought under the control of the Central Secretariat in Lagos.<ref name=\"WorldBank\"/>\n\nThe process of unification was undermined by the persistence of different regional perspectives on governance between the Northern and Southern Provinces, and by Nigerian nationalists in Lagos. While southern colonial administrators welcomed amalgamation as an opportunity for imperial expansion, their counterparts in the Northern Province believed that it was injurious to the interests of the areas they administered because of their relative backwardness and that it was their duty to resist the advance of southern influences and culture into the north.  Southerners, on their part, were not eager to embrace the extension of legislation originally meant for the north to the south.<ref name=\"WorldBank\"/>\n\n==Administration==\n\n===Governors===\nFrom its foundation, southern Nigeria was administered by a high commissioner. The first high commissioner was [[Ralph Moor]]. When Lagos was amalgamated with the rest of southern Nigeria in 1906, the then high commissioner Walter Egerton was made into Governor of the territory.\n\nWhen in 1900 the protectorate passed from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office, Ralph Moor became High Commissioner of Southern Nigeria and laid the foundations of the new administration, his health failing, he retired on pension on 1 October 1903.\n\nEgerton became Governor of Lagos Colony, covering most of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] lands in the southwest of what is now Nigeria, in 1903.\nThe colonial office wanted to amalgamate the Lagos Colony with the protectorate of Southern Nigeria, and in August 1904 also appointed Egerton as High Commissioner for the Southern Nigeria Protectorate. He held both offices until 28 February 1906.{{sfn|Carland|1985|pp=82}}\nOn that date, the two territories were formally united and Egerton was appointed Governor of the new [[Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria]], holding office until 1912.{{sfn|Worldstatesmen}}\nIn the new Southern Nigeria, the old Lagos Colony became the Western Province, and the former Southern Nigerian Protectorate was split into a Central Province with capital at [[Warri]] and an Eastern Province with capital at [[Calabar]].{{sfn|Afigbo|Falola|2005|pp=229}}\n\nWhen his predecessor in Southern Nigeria, Sir [[Ralph Denham Rayment Moor]], resigned, a large part of the southeast of Nigeria was still outside British control. On taking office, Egerton began a policy of sending out annual pacification patrols, which generally obtained submission through the threat of force without being required to actually use force.{{sfn|Carland|1985|pp=58}}\n\nWhen Egerton became Governor of Lagos he enthusiastically endorsed the extension of the [[Lagos]] \u2013 [[Ibadan]] railway onward to [[Oshogbo]], and the project was approved in November 1904. Construction began in January 1905 and the line reached Oshogbo in April 1907.{{sfn|Carland|1985|pp=148}}\nHe favored rail over river transport, and pushed to have the railway further extended to [[Kano]] by way of [[Zaria]].{{sfn|Carland|1985|pp=169}}\nHe also sponsored extensive road construction, building on the legislative foundation laid by his predecessor Moor which enabled use of unpaid local labor.{{sfn|Afigbo|Falola|2005|pp=191}}\nEgerton shared Moor's views on the damage that was being done to the [[Cross River (Nigeria)|Cross River]] trade by the combination of indigenous middlemen and traders based in [[Calabar]]. The established traders at first got the Colonial Office to pass rules inhibiting competition from traders willing to set up bases further inland, but with some difficulty, Egerton persuaded the officials to reverse their ruling.{{sfn|Afigbo|Falola|2005|pp=177}}\n\nEgerton was a strong advocate of colonial development. He believed in deficit financing at certain periods of a colony's growth, which was reflected in his budgets from 1906 to 1912. He had a constant struggle to obtain approval for these budgets from the colonial office.{{sfn|Carland|1985|pp=102\u2013104}}\nAs early as 1908, Egerton supported the idea of \"a properly organized Agricultural Department with an energetic and experienced head\", and the Department of Agriculture came into being in 1910.{{sfn|Falola|2003|pp=404}}\nEgerton endorsed the development of rubber plantations, a concept familiar to him from his time in Malaya, and arranged for land to be leased for this purpose. This was the foundation of a highly successful industry.{{sfn|Duignan|Gann|1975|pp=105}}\nHe also thought there could be great potential in the tin fields near [[Bauchi]], and thought that if proven a branch line to the tin fields would be justified.{{sfn|Calvert|1910|pp=37}}\n\nEgerton came into conflict with the administration of Northern Nigeria on a number of issues. There was debate over whether [[Ilorin]] should be incorporated into Southern Nigeria since the people were Yoruba, or remain in Northern Nigeria since the ruler was Muslim and for some time Ilorin had been subject to the Uthmaniyya Caliphate. There was argument about the administration of duties on goods landed on the coast and carried into Northern Nigeria. And there was dispute over whether railway lines from the north should terminate at Lagos or should take alternative routes to the [[Niger River]] and the coast.{{sfn|Afigbo|Falola|2005|pp=368\u2013369}}\nEgerton had reason on his side in objecting to the proposed line terminating at [[Baro (Nigeria)|Baro]] on the Niger, since navigation southward to the coast was restricted to the high water season, and even then was uncertain.{{sfn|Geary|1965|pp=143}}\n\nEgerton's administration imposed policies that tended towards segregation of Europeans and Africans.{{sfn|Okpewho|Davies|1999|pp=414}}\nThese included excluding Africans from the West African Medical Service and saying that no European should take orders from an African, which had the effect of ruling out African doctors from serving with the army. Egerton himself did not always approve of these policies, and they were not strictly upheld.{{sfn|Gann|Duignan|1978|pp=304}}\nThe legal relationship between the Lagos government and the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] states of the Lagos Colony was not clear, and it was not until 1908 that Egerton persuaded the [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]]s to accept the establishment of the Supreme Court in the main towns.{{sfn|Afigbo|Falola|2005|pp=280}} In 1912, Egerton was replaced by [[Frederick Lugard]], who was appointed Governor-General of both Southern and Northern Nigeria with the mandate to unite the two. Egerton was appointed Governor of British Guiana as his next posting, clearly a demotion, which may have been connected to his fights with the Colonial Office officials.{{sfn|Carland|1985|pp=116}}\n\nLugard returned to Nigeria as Governor of the two protectorates. His main mission was to complete the [[Amalgamation (politics)|amalgamation]] into one colony. Although controversial in [[Lagos]], where it was opposed by a large section of the political class and the media, the amalgamation did not arouse passion in the rest of the country. From 1914 to 1919, Lugard was made Governor General of the now combined Colony of Nigeria. Throughout his tenure, Lugard sought strenuously to secure the amelioration of the condition of the native people, among other means by the exclusion, wherever possible, of alcoholic liquors, and by the suppression of slave raiding and slavery.\nLugard ran the country with half of each year spent in England, distant from realities in Africa where subordinates had to delay decisions on many matters until he returned, and based his rule on a military system.<ref>''The Administration of Nigeria 1900 to 1960'', by I.

It was optimistically and simplistically believed that the problem of African economic development was largely the problem of law and order; that once the slave trade was suppressed the chaos and anarchy believed to be the bane of life in Africa would disappear and African endeavour would be channeled to the collection of the national produce of the tropical forest for the satisfaction of European needs. The view came to be held that Africans by themselves were incapable of maintaining law and order to the level needed to bring about the much-desired economic revolution and that only European rule could do it.\n\nIt was not enough for the colonial power to impose and maintain law and order though. It was also necessary to promote and develop free movement and natural growth and trade. Also it was the generally accepted assumption that the economic efforts and products of a colony should supplement, rather than compete with or undermine, the economic efforts and products of the metropolitan country.

In 1914, Southern Nigeria was joined with [[Northern Nigeria Protectorate]] to form the single colony of Nigeria. The unification was done for [[economic]] reasons rather than [[political]]\u2014[[Northern Nigeria Protectorate]] had a [[Government budget deficit|budget deficit]]; and the colonial administration sought to use the budget surpluses in Southern Nigeria to offset this deficit.<ref name=\"WorldBank\">{{cite web |url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/442501468780898611/Nigeria-State-and-local-governance-in-Nigeria |title=State and Local Governance in Nigeria |first3=Mike|last3=Stevens |first1=Joel D.|last1= Barkan |first2=Alex |last2=Gboyega |date=August 2, 2001 |work=Public Sector and Capacity Building Program: Africa Region |publisher=[[The World Bank]] |page=1 |accessdate= |quote=March 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Frederick Lugard|Sir Frederick Lugard]], who took office as governor of both protectorates in 1912, was responsible for overseeing the unification, and he became the first governor of the newly united territory. Lugard established several central institutions to anchor the evolving unified structure.  A Central Secretariat was instituted at [[Lagos]], which was the seat of government, and the [[Nigerian Council]] (later the Legislative Council), was founded to provide a forum for representatives drawn from the provinces.  Certain services were integrated across the Northern and Southern Provinces because of their national significance\u2014military, treasury, audit, posts and telegraphs, railways, survey, medical services, judicial and legal departments\u2014and brought under the control of the Central Secretariat in Lagos.<ref name=\"WorldBank\"/>\n\nThe process of unification was undermined by the persistence of different regional perspectives on governance between the Northern and Southern Provinces, and by Nigerian nationalists in Lagos. While southern colonial administrators welcomed amalgamation as an opportunity for imperial expansion, their counterparts in the Northern Province believed that it was injurious to the interests of the areas they administered because of their relative backwardness and that it was their duty to resist the advance of southern influences and culture into the north.  Southerners, on their part, were not eager to embrace the extension of legislation originally meant for the north to the south.<ref name=\"WorldBank\"/>\n\n==Administration==\n\n===Governors===\nFrom its foundation, southern Nigeria was administered by a high commissioner. The first high commissioner was [[Ralph Moor]]. When Lagos was amalgamated with the rest of southern Nigeria in 1906, the then high commissioner Walter Egerton was made into Governor of the territory.\n\nWhen in 1900 the protectorate passed from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office, Ralph Moor became High Commissioner of Southern Nigeria and laid the foundations of the new administration, his health failing, he retired on pension on 1 October 1903.\n\nEgerton became Governor of Lagos Colony, covering most of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] lands in the southwest of what is now Nigeria, in 1903.\nThe colonial office wanted to amalgamate the Lagos Colony with the protectorate of Southern Nigeria, and in August 1904 also appointed Egerton as High Commissioner for the Southern Nigeria Protectorate. He held both offices until 28 February 1906.{{sfn|Carland|1985|pp=82}}\nOn that date, the two territories were formally united and Egerton was appointed Governor of the new [[Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria]], holding office until 1912.{{sfn|Worldstatesmen}}\nIn the new Southern Nigeria, the old Lagos Colony became the Western Province, and the former Southern Nigerian Protectorate was split into a Central Province with capital at [[Warri]] and an Eastern Province with capital at [[Calabar]].{{sfn|Afigbo|Falola|2005|pp=229}}\n\nWhen his predecessor in Southern Nigeria, Sir [[Ralph Denham Rayment Moor]], resigned, a large part of the southeast of Nigeria was still outside British control. On taking office, Egerton began a policy of sending out annual pacification patrols, which generally obtained submission through the threat of force without being required to actually use force.{{sfn|Carland|1985|pp=58}}\n\nWhen Egerton became Governor of Lagos he enthusiastically endorsed the extension of the [[Lagos]] \u2013 [[Ibadan]] railway onward to [[Oshogbo]], and the project was approved in November 1904. Construction began in January 1905 and the line reached Oshogbo in April 1907.{{sfn|Carland|1985|pp=148}}\nHe favored rail over river transport, and pushed to have the railway further extended to [[Kano]] by way of [[Zaria]].{{sfn|Carland|1985|pp=169}}\nHe also sponsored extensive road construction, building on the legislative foundation laid by his predecessor Moor which enabled use of unpaid local labor.{{sfn|Afigbo|Falola|2005|pp=191}}\nEgerton shared Moor's views on the damage that was being done to the [[Cross River (Nigeria)|Cross River]] trade by the combination of indigenous middlemen and traders based in [[Calabar]]. The established traders at first got the Colonial Office to pass rules inhibiting competition from traders willing to set up bases further inland, but with some difficulty, Egerton persuaded the officials to reverse their ruling.{{sfn|Afigbo|Falola|2005|pp=177}}\n\nEgerton was a strong advocate of colonial development. He believed in deficit financing at certain periods of a colony's growth, which was reflected in his budgets from 1906 to 1912. He had a constant struggle to obtain approval for these budgets from the colonial office.{{sfn|Carland|1985|pp=102\u2013104}}\nAs early as 1908, Egerton supported the idea of \"a properly organized Agricultural Department with an energetic and experienced head\", and the Department of Agriculture came into being in 1910.{{sfn|Falola|2003|pp=404}}\nEgerton endorsed the development of rubber plantations, a concept familiar to him from his time in Malaya, and arranged for land to be leased for this purpose. This was the foundation of a highly successful industry.{{sfn|Duignan|Gann|1975|pp=105}}\nHe also thought there could be great potential in the tin fields near [[Bauchi]], and thought that if proven a branch line to the tin fields would be justified.{{sfn|Calvert|1910|pp=37}}\n\nEgerton came into conflict with the administration of Northern Nigeria on a number of issues. There was debate over whether [[Ilorin]] should be incorporated into Southern Nigeria since the people were Yoruba, or remain in Northern Nigeria since the ruler was Muslim and for some time Ilorin had been subject to the Uthmaniyya Caliphate. There was argument about the administration of duties on goods landed on the coast and carried into Northern Nigeria. And there was dispute over whether railway lines from the north should terminate at Lagos or should take alternative routes to the [[Niger River]] and the coast.{{sfn|Afigbo|Falola|2005|pp=368\u2013369}}\nEgerton had reason on his side in objecting to the proposed line terminating at [[Baro (Nigeria)|Baro]] on the Niger, since navigation southward to the coast was restricted to the high water season, and even then was uncertain.{{sfn|Geary|1965|pp=143}}\n\nEgerton's administration imposed policies that tended towards segregation of Europeans and Africans.{{sfn|Okpewho|Davies|1999|pp=414}}\nThese included excluding Africans from the West African Medical Service and saying that no European should take orders from an African, which had the effect of ruling out African doctors from serving with the army. Egerton himself did not always approve of these policies, and they were not strictly upheld.{{sfn|Gann|Duignan|1978|pp=304}}\nThe legal relationship between the Lagos government and the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] states of the Lagos Colony was not clear, and it was not until 1908 that Egerton persuaded the [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]]s to accept the establishment of the Supreme Court in the main towns.{{sfn|Afigbo|Falola|2005|pp=280}} In 1912, Egerton was replaced by [[Frederick Lugard]], who was appointed Governor-General of both Southern and Northern Nigeria with the mandate to unite the two. Egerton was appointed Governor of British Guiana as his next posting, clearly a demotion, which may have been connected to his fights with the Colonial Office officials.{{sfn|Carland|1985|pp=116}}\n\nLugard returned to Nigeria as Governor of the two protectorates. His main mission was to complete the [[Amalgamation (politics)|amalgamation]] into one colony. Although controversial in [[Lagos]], where it was opposed by a large section of the political class and the media, the amalgamation did not arouse passion in the rest of the country. From 1914 to 1919, Lugard was made Governor General of the now combined Colony of Nigeria. Throughout his tenure, Lugard sought strenuously to secure the amelioration of the condition of the native people, among other means by the exclusion, wherever possible, of alcoholic liquors, and by the suppression of slave raiding and slavery.\nLugard ran the country with half of each year spent in England, distant from realities in Africa where subordinates had to delay decisions on many matters until he returned, and based his rule on a military system.<ref>''The Administration of Nigeria 1900 to 1960'', by I.

It was optimistically and simplistically believed that the problem of African economic development was largely the problem of law and order; that once the slave trade was suppressed the chaos and anarchy believed to be the bane of life in Africa would disappear and African endeavour would be channeled to the collection of the national produce of the tropical forest for the satisfaction of European needs. The view came to be held that Africans by themselves were incapable of maintaining law and order to the level needed to bring about the much-desired economic revolution and that only European rule could do it.\n\nIt was not enough for the colonial power to impose and maintain law and order though. It was also necessary to promote and develop free movement and natural growth and trade. Also it was the generally accepted assumption that the economic efforts and products of a colony should supplement, rather than compete with or undermine, the economic efforts and products of the metropolitan country. This was a survival of the mercantilist system which had come to grief in the last quarter of the eighteenth century.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%; width:36%; float:left; padding:0.2em\" \n|+ '''Revenue and expenditure in \u00a3s'''<ref name=\"Carland1985p104\"/> \n|- align=center\n!  style=\"background:#fabe60;

It is historically known as the '''Bath Road''' with newer sections including the '''Great West Road''' and [[Portway, Bristol|Portway]]. The road was once the main route from London to Bath, Bristol and the west of England and formed, after the [[A40 road|A40]], the second main western artery from London.\n\nAlthough most traffic is carried by the [[M4 motorway]] today, the A4 still acts as the main route from [[Bristol]] to [[London]] for non-motorway traffic.\n\n==History==\n\n===Turnpikes===\nThe A4 has gone through many transformations through the ages from pre-Roman routes, [[Roman roads]] (such as [[Roman road from Silchester to Bath|the one passing Silbury Hill]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/4385933/Silbury-Hill-mystery-soon-to-be-resolved.html|title=Silbury Hill mystery soon to be resolved|first=Jack|last=Watkins|date=22 May 2018|work=The Telegraph}}</ref> and basic wagon tracks.  During the Middle Ages, most byways and tracks served to connect villages with their nearest market town. A survey of Savernake Forest near Hungerford in 1228 mentions \"The King\u2019s Street\" running between the town and [[Marlborough, Wiltshire|Marlborough]]. This street corresponded roughly with the route of the modern A4. In 1632, [[Thomas Witherings]] was appointed Postmaster of Foreign Mails by Charles I. Three years later, the king charged him with building six \"Great Roads\" to aid in the delivery of the post, of which the Great West Road was one.<ref name=\"Hungerford Museum\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hungerfordvirtualmuseum.co.uk/Themes/Transport/Coaching/coaching.html|title=Hungerford Museum|accessdate=20 September 2010|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130420145521/http://www.hungerfordvirtualmuseum.co.uk/Themes/Transport/Coaching/coaching.html|archive-date=20 April 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIt was not until the 17th century that a distinct route between London and Bristol started to resemble today's road.  During the 17th century, the A4 was known as the Great Road to Bristol. When [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] started patronising the spa city of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], the road became more commonly known as Bath Road.  Over the years, the direction of the road has taken many detours depending on such factors as changes in tolls or turnpike patronage. For example, in 1750 the toll road from London was altered to go through [[Melksham]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visit-melksham.com/history.html|title=History of Melksham|accessdate=4 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114131138/http://www.visit-melksham.com/history.html|archive-date=14 November 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and in 1695 the map maker, John Ogilby, produced a map of the Hungerford area of the Great West Road showing two possible routes.<ref name=\"Hungerford Museum\"/>\n\nAs Bath became more popular with the wealthy and famous, it was inevitable that [[turnpike trust]]s would be set up under the terms of the '''Turnpike Acts''' to pay for maintenance and improvements to the road. The first turnpike on this road was between [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] and [[Theale, Berkshire|Theale]] in 1714.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.turnpikes.org.uk/Reading%20turnpike%20roads.htm|title = Turnpikes|accessdate=4 April 2010}}</ref> Due to increasing traffic, sections of the road between [[Kensington]], over Hounslow Hill, to [[Twyford, Berkshire|Twyford]] were turnpike by 1717 with the remaining sections placed under turnpike trusts.\n[[File:1768 genmag lon-malbro.jpg|thumb|left|Strip Map of Bath Road 1786.]]\nAs turnpike trusts were individually run, there was the possibility for greatly differing road conditions, especially over the [[London Clay]] basin of [[Kensington]], [[Brentford]], [[Hounslow]] and [[Slough]], where winter conditions left the way muddy and uneven. This was not always the case with the Bath Road, as many of the wealthy landowners along the route co-operated informally and exercised a large amount of control over feeder roads.  As a result, control of the Bath Road was easy to maintain and many inns and towns became prosperous.\n\nTollhouses were established at [[Colnbrook]], [[Maidenhead]], [[Twyford, Berkshire|Twyford]], Castle Street [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], Thatcham and [[Benham Park|Benham]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.turnpikes.org.uk/Reading%20turnpike%20roads.htm|title = Tollhouses|accessdate=4 April 2010}}</ref> During the 1820s, the employment of good surveyors improved the condition of the road and aided an increased flow of wealthy travellers.  The tolls raised from such clientele ensured that when the turnpike trusts handed over the route to local highway boards, they had no financial liabilities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.turnpikes.org.uk/Reading%20turnpike%20roads.htm|title = Highway Boards|accessdate=4 April 2010}}</ref> Justices of the Peace were empowered by the 1862 Rural Highways Act to combine turnpike trusts into Highways Districts.  This meant that by the late 1860s trusts were either not renewing their powers or were being terminated by General Acts of Parliament.  For example, most turnpikes in Berkshire, including the Bath Road, were officially wound up by 1878 when legislation transferred responsibility for dis-enturnpiked roads to the new county councils.  The tollgate on the Bath Road west of Reading was removed in 1864 as the outward pressure of urban development made rates a more acceptable way of financing the maintenance of what was now a suburban road.\n\n===Postal service and coaching===\nWith the improvement being made to the road systems, the business of moving mail became easier and thus more profitable as volumes were able to increase.  In Bristol, a postal office had been well established by the 1670s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/MainArticle.aspx?m=33747&amid=30295027|title=Bristol Post Office History|accessdate=4 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100323231903/http://www.historytoday.com/MainArticle.aspx?m=33747&amid=30295027| archivedate= 23 March 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> The journey time to London at this period was about 16 and three quarter hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bathpostalmuseum.co.uk/explore/history/history_1700s.html |title=Bath Postal Museum |accessdate=4 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608015136/http://www.bathpostalmuseum.co.uk/explore/history/history_1700s.html |archivedate=8 June 2009 }}</ref> A letter from Bath in 1684 took about 3 days going via a postal office in [[Marshfield, Gloucestershire|Marshfield]] on the Bristol Road.  (The route to Bristol did not yet go through Bath at this time).  Journey times during the Turnpike era fell with the improvements from 2 days in 1752 to 38 hours in 1782 and 18 hours by 1836.  Royal Mail coaches in 1836 were able to do the trip in 12 to 13 hours.<ref name=\"Hungerford Museum\"/>\n\nFurther improvements to regional post services were made between 1719 and 1763 due to contracts with the London Inland Letter Office negotiated by [[Ralph Allen]], the postmaster of Bath.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bathpostalmuseum.co.uk/explore/history/history_1700s.html |title=Ralph Allen |accessdate=4 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608015136/http://www.bathpostalmuseum.co.uk/explore/history/history_1700s.html |archivedate=8 June 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn the early part of the 19th century, coaching was at its height with six [[stagecoaches]] each day carrying passengers to and from London along the Bath Road in 1830,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visit-melksham.com/history.html|title=Stagecoaches|accessdate=4 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114131138/http://www.visit-melksham.com/history.html|archive-date=14 November 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> rising to ten by 1836.<ref name=\"Hungerford Museum\"/> Hungerford is at about the midway point of the journey between London and Bristol and was ideally positioned to take advantage of the increase in coaching.  In 1836, five companies operated a coaching service through Hungerford.<ref name=\"Hungerford Museum\"/> This peak was to be short-lived following the construction of the [[Great Western Railway]].  The decline in coaching traffic in Hungerford coincided with the building of the Great Western Railway from London to Bath and Bristol, and the subsequent [[Berks and Hants Railway]] line from Newbury to Hungerford itself in 1847.<ref name=\"Hungerford Museum\"/> By 1843, it was reported that the stage coaches had ceased running between Bristol and London.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/columnists/brian-viner/brian-viner-country-life-490208.html|title = Death of the coach service|accessdate=4 April 2010 | location=London | work=The Independent | date=11 May 2005}}</ref>\n\n==Route==\n\n===Holborn Circus to Westminster (0.4 miles)===\n[[File:Holborn Circus - geograph.org.uk - 650950.jpg|thumb|right|View down New Fetter Lane from [[Holborn Circus]], with [[J Sainsbury]] head office on the right]]\nThe A4 begins as [[Fetter Lane|New Fetter Lane]] in the [[City of London]] at [[Holborn Circus]] on the [[A40 road|A40]]. It goes in a southerly direction to join [[Fleet Street]] where many British national newspapers at one time had their head offices. The [[Office of Fair Trading]] has its main office here.\n\n===Westminster to Hammersmith via Kensington (4.6 miles)===\nThe road heads west through the City of Westminster via the [[Strand, London|Strand]], passing notable landmarks such as the [[Royal Courts of Justice]], the [[Savoy Theatre|Savoy]] and [[Adelphi Theatre|Adelphi theatres]], and [[Charing Cross railway station]].\n\nFrom Charing Cross station to [[Green Park]], the westbound and eastbound routes of the A4 are considerably different, due to one-way systems. Westbound, the A4 continues along the Strand up to [[Charing Cross]] itself, then along [[Cockspur Street]] and into [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]], the location of many exclusive [[gentlemen's club]]s as well as the [[Institute of Directors]], before turning right along St James's Street to reach [[Piccadilly]].\n\nEastbound from Green Park, the A4 runs along the full length of Piccadilly to [[Piccadilly Circus]], before turning right along [[Haymarket (London)|Haymarket]]. It bears left along Pall Mall East, then right along the west side of [[Trafalgar Square]], past the [[National Gallery]] and [[Canada House]], to Charing Cross. Finally, it bears left along the east side of the Square, past [[High Commission of South Africa, London|South Africa House]], then right along Duncannon Street to reach Charing Cross station.\n\nThe first part of [[Regent Street]], from Waterloo Place to Piccadilly Circus, is also signed as the A4; all traffic here runs in a northbound direction.\n\n[[File:PiccadillyCircusLookingDown2005.JPG|thumb|left|[[Piccadilly Circus]]]]\nFrom Green Park, the A4 enters a short tunnel under [[Hyde Park Corner]], where [[Wellington Arch]] is located. Afterwards, the road continues along the first part of [[Knightsbridge]], before bearing left onto [[Brompton Road]]. This is an affluent area of London, in which the [[Harrods]] and [[Harvey Nichols]] department stores are located as well as numerous [[Diplomatic mission|embassies]]. At this point, the road enters the [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]].\n\nAt the [[Brompton Oratory]], the road bears right along Thurloe Place and Cromwell Gardens, past the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] and the [[Ismaili Centre, London|Ismaili Centre]], and onto [[Cromwell Road]], past the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]]. At [[Earls Court]], the A4 becomes [[dual carriageway]], and continues along West Cromwell Road, over the [[West London Line]] into [[West Kensington]] and the [[London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham|Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham]].\n\nA {{convert|5|mi|km|adj=on}} section of the road from Knightsbridge to the [[Chiswick Flyover]] was the first section of [[Clearway#United Kingdom|Cleaway]] designated in London. It introduced no stopping on the road during rush hours on 21 August 1961.<ref>{{cite newspaper |url=https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS203776278/TTDA?u=kccl&sid=TTDA&xid=ec717a62 |work=[[The Times]] |title=Satisfactory First Day For Clearway |issue=55166 |p=12 |date=22 August 1961 |access-date=1 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Hammersmith to Heathrow Airport (10.7 miles)===\n[[File:Hammersmith flyover 6523r.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hammersmith Flyover]]]]\nThe A4 continues along [[Talgarth Road]] past the [[London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art]]. The road becomes elevated at the [[Hammersmith Flyover]] and heads towards [[Heathrow Airport]] along the Great West Road, passing Hammersmith's two churches of [[St Paul's, Hammersmith|St Paul]] and [[St Peter's Church, Hammersmith|St Peter]]. At this point the road is close to the [[River Thames]].\n\nThe road enters [[Chiswick]] and the [[London Borough of Hounslow|Borough of Hounslow]], passing [[Fuller's Brewery]]. After [[Hogarth Roundabout]], the road passes [[Hogarth's House]] and is called Hogarth Lane, then Ellesmere Road and Cedars Road. It becomes the Great West Road again just a few yards short of the start of [[Chiswick Flyover]], which is junction 1 of the M4. [[Gunnersbury]]'s Russian Orthodox Cathedral is clearly visible on the right.\n\nThe road then passes the Glaxo-Smith Kline premises in [[Brentford]] where it follows underneath its successor the M4 as far as the bridge over the [[River Brent]].  The stretch between Chiswick's western border to Syon Lane (Gillette Corner) is known as the [[Golden Mile (Brentford)|Golden Mile]] with some notable Art Deco factories. The road remains as the Great West Road through [[Osterley]] and [[Hounslow]] where it splits with the [[A30 road|A30]], which is known as the Great South West Road. Between the two world wars, the Great West Road was built as a bypass to relieve traffic congestion in Brentford and Hounslow.\n\nAfter the A30, the A4 changes its name to Bath Road, enters [[Cranford, London|Cranford]], and crosses the [[River Crane, London|River Crane]] into the [[London Borough of Hillingdon|Borough of Hillingdon]]. It then passes along the northern boundary of [[Heathrow Airport]], before leaving the London suburbs over the [[M25 motorway|M25]] towards the west.\n\n===Heathrow Airport to Slough (6.7 miles)===\n[[File:A4 - geograph.org.uk - 726146.jpg|thumb|left|The A4 near [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow Airport]]]]\nAfter leaving Heathrow Airport, still the A4, it becomes the [[Colnbrook Bypass]] and climbs over the M25 motorway. This bypass for the narrow main road of [[Colnbrook]] was built after the Second World War across farmland between [[Harmondsworth]] and the outskirts of [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley]].\n\nThe next major intersection is junction 5 of the M4 (Slough-East) known as the Langley junction. At this point the A4 loses its [[trunk road]] classification.\n\nContinuing towards [[Slough]] town centre, the road, now named London Road, passes Kedermister Park on the right. Changing into Sussex Place, the architecturally impressive St Bernard's former convent is on the right. Becoming the dual carriageway Wellington Street (a late 1960s bypass for the High Street), Tesco's massive 'aircraft hangar' supermarket is on the right and the Queensmere and Observatory Shopping Centres on the left.\n\nThe end of this section of the Great Western Road is in the centre of Slough at the junction of William Street and Wellington Street. This spot was formerly the site of Slough's largest roundabout on the south-east corner of Thames Valley University. Nearby is [[Slough railway station]], served by Great Western Railway.\n\nThe roundabout was removed in 2011 and the university's Slough campus closed in 2011 after planning permission was granted for 1,598 flats.\n\n===Slough to Maidenhead (6.0 miles)===\n[[File:Bath Road Slough.jpg|thumb|right|The A4 in [[Slough]]]]\nContinuing from the William Street / Wellington Street junction, in the centre of [[Slough]], the road heads westwards towards Maidenhead. The short stretch of dual carriageway is Wellington Street, then briefly on the most western end of the High Street, over the railway bridge for the line between Slough and [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] Central Station.\n\nThe Bath Road begins on the west side of the bridge. On the left is Slough's 1936 Town Hall, now abandoned by the local council, and on the right [[Salt Hill]] Park.\n\nThe next major road intersection is by the Three Tuns Pub where the A4 crosses the [[A355 road|A355]]. This road goes north towards Farnham Royal, Farnham Common, Beaconsfield and the [[M40 motorway|M40]] at junction 2. To the south, it goes towards the [[M4 motorway|M4]] (junction 6, Slough Centre) and [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]].\n\nThe route at this point runs parallel to both the [[Great Western Main Line]] and the M4.  The road continues past the southern fringe of [[Slough Trading Estate]].\n\n[[File:Maidenhead Bridge (1).jpg|thumb|left|[[Maidenhead Bridge]] crossing the [[River Thames]]]]\nOn Slough's western boundary is the Huntercombe Spur roundabout linking the A4 to junction 7 of the M4 motorway. Here the dual carriageway ends. The road bends right at [[Taplow]] and passes under a high railway bridge, then over the River Thames flood prevention channel.\n\nThe road then goes over Maidenhead's old bridge [[Maidenhead Bridge]], spanning the [[River Thames]], and into the eastern outskirts of Maidenhead.\n\nAlong Bridge Road, St Cloud Way and Bad Godesberg Way respectively. The centre of Maidenhead is reached at the roundabout that forms the junction with the [[A308 road|A308]].  Turning northwards on the A308 would lead to the [[A404 road|A404]] towards [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]] and [[High Wycombe]]. Southwards, the A308 heads towards Windsor and provides an opportunity to branch off for junction 8/9 of the M4.\n\n===Maidenhead to Reading (12.3 miles)===\nHeading out of Maidenhead town centre, the road follows Castle Hill and then Bath Road. At the outskirts, the road forms part of junction 9b of the A404(M)/A404, which links junction 8/9 of the M4 with junction 4 of the M40 at Handy Cross.  The A4 crosses open countryside before following New Bath Road on the outskirts of [[Twyford, Berkshire|Twyford]].  This is a bypass, built in 1929, that deviates from the old route of the A4, and crosses the [[River Loddon]] on its way into the suburbs of [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] via the village of Charvil.\n\nThe A4 passes the King George's Field in [[Sonning]], which are used as playing fields, and the Reading Cricket and [[Reading Hockey Club|Hockey Club]].  As it enters Reading, along the London Road again, it crosses the junction of the A3290 next to [[Palmer Park, Reading|Palmer Park]], which leads to Junction 10 of the M4.\n\n[[File:East Reading, 1976 (4).jpg|thumb|right|[[Cemetery Junction, Reading|Cemetery Junction]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] in 1976]]\nThe A4 goes over the intersection with the [[A329 road|A329]] [[Cemetery Junction, Reading|Cemetery Junction]] which links [[Wokingham]] with [[Pangbourne]], passing the Royal Berkshire Hospital and the London Road Campus of the [[University of Reading]]. At London Street and again at Southampton Street, the A4 meets the [[A327 road|A327]] twice, since the latter loops round on two branches which meet at Whitley Street. Between the two junctions, the A4 becomes Crown Street for approximately 150&nbsp;metres.\n\n===Reading to Newbury (16.7 miles)===\nOn the other side of the intersection the A4 follows Pell Street and continues westward. Here it crosses the [[River Kennet]], the [[Holy Brook]] and the [[A33 road|A33]] relief road, which goes towards [[Basingstoke]]. In [[West Reading, Berkshire|West Reading]], the A4 becomes Berkeley Avenue, and then continues onto the Bath Road. It passes [[Prospect Park, Reading|Prospect Park]], and the suburbs of [[Southcote, Berkshire|Southcote]], Horncastle and [[Calcot, Berkshire|Calcot]], before reaching Junction 12 of the M4. The A4 heads south westerly through [[Theale, Berkshire|Theale]] and over the roundabout connecting it to the [[A340 road|A340]] which heads towards Pangbourne.\n\nHeading towards [[Thatcham]], the road passes [[Aldermaston Wharf]] next to the [[Kennet and Avon Canal]] and through the villages of [[Woolhampton]] and [[Midgham]]. A large industrial estate is on the left as the road enters Thatcham. At the roundabout after the industrial Estate the route follows London Road and passes Thatcham towards Benham Hill and [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]]. At the Benham Hill roundabout it goes along Bath Road where it deviates from Turnpike Road. Bath Road is the original turnpiked road and the road now confusingly called Turnpike Road was originally called The Shaw Road.<ref>''Thatcham Road Names'', 1991, Roy Tubb</ref> The turnpike then continues along London Road as it enters the outskirts of Newbury.\n\nHeading towards the centre of Newbury, the route passes the [[West Berkshire Community Hospital]] on the right. To the North of the town centre the road becomes part of an unusual junction with the [[A339 road|A339]] that links the new [[A34 road|A34]] by-pass to the north with [[Basingstoke]] to the south.  The junction is a combination of a figure of eight roundabout with an elevated section that used to be the old route of the A34.\n\n===Newbury to Marlborough (18.8 miles)===\n[[File:High Street, Marlborough from St Peter's church roof - geograph.org.uk - 460662.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of High Street, [[Marlborough, Wiltshire|Marlborough]]]]\nAfter the junction, the road heads out of town through [[Speenhamland, Berkshire|Speenhamland]] along Western Avenue and Bath Road to the junction with the A34 [[Newbury bypass]].  The Newbury bypass was opened, after some controversy, on 17 November 1998, at a cost of \u00a3104&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ukrivers.net/newburybypass/newburyopening.html|title=Newbury By-pass Opens|accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref> The route heads over undulating countryside in a fairly straight westward direction towards [[Hungerford]] parallel to the Kennet and Avon Canal and crossing the River Kennet on the outskirts of the town at the same time as intersecting with the [[A338 road|A338]].  The route does not enter the town centre, but continues westward to the northern side of town on its way to Marlborough via the village of Froxfield and the northern edge of [[Savernake Forest]].\n\nOn entering the outskirts of Marlborough the road follows London Road. Crossing the River Kennet again it briefly shares the highway with the [[A346 road|A346]] which connects northwards to [[Swindon]]. It splits again at a roundabout along New Road and Oxford Street into the town centre on the High Street. The High Street is a traditional main thoroughfare for an English market town, in that it is wide, with space for market stalls on either side and in the middle, though these spaces are usually marked for car parking.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getcom2.php?id=155.|title= Marlborough History|accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nUntil the late 1980s most of this section, and some of the following Wiltshire section, was configured as three lanes, with the central lane available for overtaking traffic in either direction.  This is no longer considered safe so the road now has one wider-than-normal lane in each direction, with [[Traffic island|ghost island]]s at junctions to discourage overtaking at these points.\n\n===Marlborough to Chippenham (18.9 miles)===\n[[File:Silbury Hill, Wiltshire. - geograph.org.uk - 364299.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of [[Silbury Hill]]]]\nThe A4 continues along the High Street on its way out of Marlborough via Bridewell Street and Bath Road. The road passes underneath a covered bridge that links Morris House of [[Marlborough College]] to the North Block of the same establishment.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.marlboroughcollege.org/col_morris_house.aspx| title= Marlborough College| accessdate= 5 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100405092134/http://www.marlboroughcollege.org/col_morris_house.aspx| archivedate= 5 April 2010| url-status= dead| df= dmy-all}}</ref> The college is an independent boarding school established in 1843 using some of the buildings that remained after the demise the coaching trade, which saw the original Castle Inn Coaching House close.\n\nThe route continues westward through the village of [[Fyfield, Wiltshire|Fyfield]], across [[Overton Hill]] where there is a parking area at the start of the [[Ridgeway National Trail]] and through the village of [[West Kennet]]. On leaving West Kennet there are some parking lay-bys where visitors can walk a short distance from the road to the Neolithic [[West Kennet Long Barrow]], which forms part of the Avebury World Heritage Site.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.16504| title= West Kennet Long Barrow|accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref> One mile further along the A4 is [[Silbury Hill]], which is also part of the Avebury World Heritage Site.

It is mentioned in ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'' novel by [[Charles Dickens]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.aboutbritain.com/towns/beckhampton.asp | title= Waggon & Horses Inn|accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cherhillwhitehorse.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cherhill White Horse]] as seen from the A4]]\nThe route continues past [[Cherhill]] and the [[Cherhill White Horse]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.wiltshirewhitehorses.org.uk/cherhill.html | title= Cherhill White Horse|accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref> can be seen to the left and nearby the [[Lansdowne Monument]]. The route then descends down the Labour in Vain Hill through the village of [[Quemerford]] and into the market town of [[Calne]].\nHeading towards the town centre, the road crosses a double mini roundabout, one exit forming the junction with the [[A3102 road|A3102]] to Melksham.  It follows New Road and passes by the old [[coaching inn]] of the Lansdowne Strand.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getfaq.php?id=59|title = Lansdowne Strand |accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref> On the way out of Calne, the road goes along Curzon Street, and then to Chilvester Hill at the roundabout where the northern part of the A3102 splits off towards [[Lyneham, Wiltshire|Lyneham]].\n\nThe A4 descends steeply before climbing again up Black Dog Hill past the [[Bowood House]] Estate.  The old road used to pass through [[Derry Hill]], but the New Road, as it is called at this point, indicates that the village was bypassed. There follows a steep descent to the junction with the [[A342 road|A342]] [[Devizes]] road and a sharp right turn past the Lysley Arms towards [[Chippenham]].\n\nOn the outskirts of Chippenham is a large roundabout, where the old A4 used to carry straight on down London Road and The Causeway into the Town Centre, which has since been pedestrianised. Most traffic turns left to go round the Pewsham Estate relief road called Pewsham Way, which is now the classified A4 route. After four roundabouts, the A4 turns left in a southerly direction at a roundabout, past the Chippenham Magistrates Court. The route heads downhill over the [[River Avon (Bristol)|River Avon]] on the Avenue [[La Fleche]], named after one of Chippenham's twin towns, to the Bridge Centre roundabout.\n\n===Chippenham to Bath (12.7 miles)===\n[[File:The Paragon Bath.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Paragon, Bath|The Paragon]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]]]\nThe Bridge Centre roundabout forms a junction of the A4 with the [[A420 road|A420]] Bristol Road. The route heads over Rowden Hill past the Chippenham Community Hospital and down to the spot where musician [[Eddie Cochran]] was killed in a car crash on 17 April 1960. A plaque has been placed there in remembrance.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.halletts.co.uk/history.htm |title=Eddie Cochrane Memorial|accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nFrom there it passes under the railway arch built by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] in the 1830s and on to its junction with the [[A350 road|A350]]. From this point onwards it regains its [[trunk road]] status and heads up Chequers Hill towards [[Corsham]]. The road passes through [[Pickwick, Wiltshire|Pickwick]], which used to be a village in its own right. Charles Dickens stayed at the Hare & Hounds Inn and used the village name for the title of his novel ''The Pickwick Papers''.<ref name = Flavin>{{cite book | last = Flavin | first = Steve | title = Corsham Born and Bred | year = 1991 | publisher = S.B.

From the road the [[Box Tunnel]], built as part of the [[Great Western Railway]], can be seen clearly. The road bears to the right at the junction with the [[A365 road|A365]] to [[Melksham]], and criss-crosses with the main railway line as far as the roundabout at [[Bathford]] which forms a junction with the [[A363 road|A363]] towards [[Bradford-on-Avon]]. The road after this roundabout becomes a dual carriageway until the A4 diverts to the left down a slip road, and the remainder becomes the [[A46 road|A46]]; this section, the  {{convert|3|mi|adj=on}} \u00a345&nbsp;million dual-carriageway [[Batheaston]]/[[Swainswick]] Bypass, opened in summer 1996, was highly controversial both at planning and at construction stages.\n\nThe route enters the outskirts of Bath passing by the training grounds of [[Bath RFC]]. After a series of traffic light controlled junctions, the A4 continues straight ahead where it meets the [[A36 road|A36]]. It passes Hedgemead Park and down [[The Paragon, Bath|The Paragon]] before crossing into George Street and to [[Queen Square (Bath)|Queen Square]].\n\n===Bath to Bristol/Avonmouth (19.6 miles)===\n[[File:Avon gorge and cave arp.jpg|thumb|left|A4 passing under the [[Clifton Suspension Bridge]]]]\nIn the original 1922 road numbering list, the A4 ended at the junction between George Street and [[Milsom Street, Bath|Milsom Street]] in Bath. On 1 April 1935, it was extended over the A431 and B4044 to Newbridge, and the A36 to Avonmouth.<ref>[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] file MT39/241 and MT39/246</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/roadlists/1922.shtml|title=1922 Road Lists - Roader's Digest: The SABRE Wiki|website=www.sabre-roads.org.uk}}</ref>\n\nFrom Queen Square, Bath, the A4 carries on to Queen Square Place and Charlotte Street, before heading along the Upper Bristol Road by [[Royal Victoria Park, Bath|Royal Victoria Park]] to Newbridge Road. The road crosses the River Avon on its way to join the A36 and becomes a dual carriageway again until the roundabout that forms the junction with the [[A39 road|A39]] Wells Road at the Globe Inn and exit for the nearby [[Bath Spa University]]. It continues on through the village of [[Saltford]] towards [[Keynsham]] where a roundabout splits the road and the A4 continues as a dual carriageway by-passing the town, crossing over the [[River Chew]] in the process.\n\nThe end of the by-pass coincides with the junction of the Avon Ring Road, the [[A4174 road|A4174]]. The route goes through the suburb of [[Brislington]], going past Arnos Court Park and [[Arnos Vale Cemetery]]. The road runs over a bridge over the [[New Cut (Bristol)|New Cut]] and into Temple Gate where [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station]] is located. The A4 no longer has a defined route from this point to the start of Anchor Road at [[The Centre, Bristol|The Centre]]; originally it went along Victoria Street and Baldwin Street before turning left onto St Augustine's Parade or, later, Broad Quay, but in more recent times it followed Redcliffe Way, via Redcliffe Roundabout (junction with the [[A38 road|A38]]) across [[Queen Square, Bristol|Queen Square]] to [[The Centre, Bristol|The Centre]].  From there it turns back towards [[Bristol Harbour]] via Anchor Road past the [[We The Curious]] science museum.  After another roundabout the A4 follows along Hotwell Road and around a one-way system that merges the A4 with the [[A3029 road|A3029]].\n\nAt this point the A4 regains trunk road classification and passes under the [[Clifton Suspension Bridge]] along the [[Portway, Bristol|Portway]]. It heads out of the city into the suburbs of [[Sea Mills, Bristol|Sea Mills]] and [[Shirehampton]] before going under the [[M5 motorway|M5]] to end at the roundabout that feeds the motorway, the [[M49 motorway|M49]] and [[A403 road|A403]] in Avonmouth.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|A4 road (England)}}\n{{Attached KML|display=inline,title}}\n*[http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/roadlists/f99/4.shtml A4 road] at the [[Society for All British and Irish Road Enthusiasts]]\n\n{{GB A road zone 4}}\n{{Motorways and Trunk Roads in England|state=collapsed}}\n{{Roads in London}}\n{{Transport in Buckinghamshire}}\n{{Transport in Bristol}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:4-0004a}}\n[[Category:Roads in England]]\n[[Category:Streets in London]]\n[[Category:Roads in Berkshire]]\n[[Category:Roads in Bristol]]\n[[Category:Roads in London]]\n[[Category:Roads in Somerset]]\n[[Category:Roads in Wiltshire]]\n[[Category:Elevated overpasses in London]]\n[[Category:Streets in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham]]\n[[Category:Streets in the London Borough of Hillingdon]]\n[[Category:Transport in the London Borough of Hounslow]]\n[[Category:Transport in Greater Reading]]\n[[Category:Streets in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]]\n[[Category:Streets in the City of Westminster]]\n[[Category:A4 road (England)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use British English|date=February 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n\n{{Infobox road\n|country=GBR\n|type=A\n|route=4\n|alternate_name=Bath Road\n|length_mi=126.64\n|map=[[File:A4 road map.png|200px]]|map_custom=yes\n|direction_a=East\n|direction_b=West\n|terminus_a = [[City of London]]\n| destinations = [[Westminster]]<br>[[Hammersmith]]<br>[[Hounslow]]<br>[[Heathrow Airport]]<br>[[Slough]]<br>[[Maidenhead]]<br>[[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]<br>[[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]]<br>[[Marlborough, Wiltshire|Marlborough]]<br>[[Calne]]<br>[[Chippenham]]<br>[[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]<br>[[Bristol]]\n| terminus_b = [[Avonmouth]]<ref>{{Coord|51.502|-2.686|display=inline|region:GB_scale:10000}}</ref>\n| junction = {{jct|country=GBR|A|40|noshield1=|nolink1= }}<br>{{jct|country=GBR|A|4208|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|301|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|3212|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|400|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|4201|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|4202|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|3216|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|315|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|308|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|3220|name1= }}<br>{{jct|country=GBR|A|219|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|316|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|M|4|dab1=Great Britain}}  Junctions 1 and 2 <br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|205|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|406|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|3002|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|3005|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|30|noshield1=|nolink1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|312|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|408|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|3044|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|M|4|dab1=Great Britain}}  Junction 5 <br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|412|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|355|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|4155|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|308|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|404|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|321|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|329|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|327|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|33|noshield1=|nolink1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|M|4|dab1=Great Britain}}  Junction 12 <br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|340|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|339|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|34|noshield1=|nolink1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|338|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|346|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|345|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|361|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|3102|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|342|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|350|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|365|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|363|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|46|noshield1=|nolink1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|36|noshield1=|nolink1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|39|noshield1=|nolink1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|4174|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|37|noshield1=|nolink1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|4044|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|4162|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|A|403|name1= }}<br/>{{jct|country=GBR|M|5|dab1=Great Britain}}\n}}\n\nThe '''A4''' is a major road in [[England]] from [[Central London]] to [[Avonmouth]] via [[Heathrow Airport]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] and [[Bristol]]. It is historically known as the '''Bath Road''' with newer sections including the '''Great West Road''' and [[Portway, Bristol|Portway]]. The road was once the main route from London to Bath, Bristol and the west of England and formed, after the [[A40 road|A40]], the second main western artery from London.\n\nAlthough most traffic is carried by the [[M4 motorway]] today, the A4 still acts as the main route from [[Bristol]] to [[London]] for non-motorway traffic.\n\n==History==\n\n===Turnpikes===\nThe A4 has gone through many transformations through the ages from pre-Roman routes, [[Roman roads]] (such as [[Roman road from Silchester to Bath|the one passing Silbury Hill]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/4385933/Silbury-Hill-mystery-soon-to-be-resolved.html|title=Silbury Hill mystery soon to be resolved|first=Jack|last=Watkins|date=22 May 2018|work=The Telegraph}}</ref> and basic wagon tracks.  During the Middle Ages, most byways and tracks served to connect villages with their nearest market town. A survey of Savernake Forest near Hungerford in 1228 mentions \"The King\u2019s Street\" running between the town and [[Marlborough, Wiltshire|Marlborough]]. This street corresponded roughly with the route of the modern A4. In 1632, [[Thomas Witherings]] was appointed Postmaster of Foreign Mails by Charles I. Three years later, the king charged him with building six \"Great Roads\" to aid in the delivery of the post, of which the Great West Road was one.<ref name=\"Hungerford Museum\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hungerfordvirtualmuseum.co.uk/Themes/Transport/Coaching/coaching.html|title=Hungerford Museum|accessdate=20 September 2010|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130420145521/http://www.hungerfordvirtualmuseum.co.uk/Themes/Transport/Coaching/coaching.html|archive-date=20 April 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIt was not until the 17th century that a distinct route between London and Bristol started to resemble today's road.  During the 17th century, the A4 was known as the Great Road to Bristol. When [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] started patronising the spa city of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], the road became more commonly known as Bath Road.  Over the years, the direction of the road has taken many detours depending on such factors as changes in tolls or turnpike patronage. For example, in 1750 the toll road from London was altered to go through [[Melksham]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visit-melksham.com/history.html|title=History of Melksham|accessdate=4 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114131138/http://www.visit-melksham.com/history.html|archive-date=14 November 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and in 1695 the map maker, John Ogilby, produced a map of the Hungerford area of the Great West Road showing two possible routes.<ref name=\"Hungerford Museum\"/>\n\nAs Bath became more popular with the wealthy and famous, it was inevitable that [[turnpike trust]]s would be set up under the terms of the '''Turnpike Acts''' to pay for maintenance and improvements to the road. The first turnpike on this road was between [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] and [[Theale, Berkshire|Theale]] in 1714.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.turnpikes.org.uk/Reading%20turnpike%20roads.htm|title = Turnpikes|accessdate=4 April 2010}}</ref> Due to increasing traffic, sections of the road between [[Kensington]], over Hounslow Hill, to [[Twyford, Berkshire|Twyford]] were turnpike by 1717 with the remaining sections placed under turnpike trusts.\n[[File:1768 genmag lon-malbro.jpg|thumb|left|Strip Map of Bath Road 1786.]]\nAs turnpike trusts were individually run, there was the possibility for greatly differing road conditions, especially over the [[London Clay]] basin of [[Kensington]], [[Brentford]], [[Hounslow]] and [[Slough]], where winter conditions left the way muddy and uneven. This was not always the case with the Bath Road, as many of the wealthy landowners along the route co-operated informally and exercised a large amount of control over feeder roads.  As a result, control of the Bath Road was easy to maintain and many inns and towns became prosperous.\n\nTollhouses were established at [[Colnbrook]], [[Maidenhead]], [[Twyford, Berkshire|Twyford]], Castle Street [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], Thatcham and [[Benham Park|Benham]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.turnpikes.org.uk/Reading%20turnpike%20roads.htm|title = Tollhouses|accessdate=4 April 2010}}</ref> During the 1820s, the employment of good surveyors improved the condition of the road and aided an increased flow of wealthy travellers.  The tolls raised from such clientele ensured that when the turnpike trusts handed over the route to local highway boards, they had no financial liabilities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.turnpikes.org.uk/Reading%20turnpike%20roads.htm|title = Highway Boards|accessdate=4 April 2010}}</ref> Justices of the Peace were empowered by the 1862 Rural Highways Act to combine turnpike trusts into Highways Districts.  This meant that by the late 1860s trusts were either not renewing their powers or were being terminated by General Acts of Parliament.  For example, most turnpikes in Berkshire, including the Bath Road, were officially wound up by 1878 when legislation transferred responsibility for dis-enturnpiked roads to the new county councils.  The tollgate on the Bath Road west of Reading was removed in 1864 as the outward pressure of urban development made rates a more acceptable way of financing the maintenance of what was now a suburban road.\n\n===Postal service and coaching===\nWith the improvement being made to the road systems, the business of moving mail became easier and thus more profitable as volumes were able to increase.  In Bristol, a postal office had been well established by the 1670s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/MainArticle.aspx?m=33747&amid=30295027|title=Bristol Post Office History|accessdate=4 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100323231903/http://www.historytoday.com/MainArticle.aspx?m=33747&amid=30295027| archivedate= 23 March 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> The journey time to London at this period was about 16 and three quarter hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bathpostalmuseum.co.uk/explore/history/history_1700s.html |title=Bath Postal Museum |accessdate=4 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608015136/http://www.bathpostalmuseum.co.uk/explore/history/history_1700s.html |archivedate=8 June 2009 }}</ref> A letter from Bath in 1684 took about 3 days going via a postal office in [[Marshfield, Gloucestershire|Marshfield]] on the Bristol Road.

Royal Mail coaches in 1836 were able to do the trip in 12 to 13 hours.<ref name=\"Hungerford Museum\"/>\n\nFurther improvements to regional post services were made between 1719 and 1763 due to contracts with the London Inland Letter Office negotiated by [[Ralph Allen]], the postmaster of Bath.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bathpostalmuseum.co.uk/explore/history/history_1700s.html |title=Ralph Allen |accessdate=4 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608015136/http://www.bathpostalmuseum.co.uk/explore/history/history_1700s.html |archivedate=8 June 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn the early part of the 19th century, coaching was at its height with six [[stagecoaches]] each day carrying passengers to and from London along the Bath Road in 1830,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visit-melksham.com/history.html|title=Stagecoaches|accessdate=4 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114131138/http://www.visit-melksham.com/history.html|archive-date=14 November 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> rising to ten by 1836.<ref name=\"Hungerford Museum\"/> Hungerford is at about the midway point of the journey between London and Bristol and was ideally positioned to take advantage of the increase in coaching.  In 1836, five companies operated a coaching service through Hungerford.<ref name=\"Hungerford Museum\"/> This peak was to be short-lived following the construction of the [[Great Western Railway]].  The decline in coaching traffic in Hungerford coincided with the building of the Great Western Railway from London to Bath and Bristol, and the subsequent [[Berks and Hants Railway]] line from Newbury to Hungerford itself in 1847.<ref name=\"Hungerford Museum\"/> By 1843, it was reported that the stage coaches had ceased running between Bristol and London.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/columnists/brian-viner/brian-viner-country-life-490208.html|title = Death of the coach service|accessdate=4 April 2010 | location=London | work=The Independent | date=11 May 2005}}</ref>\n\n==Route==\n\n===Holborn Circus to Westminster (0.4 miles)===\n[[File:Holborn Circus - geograph.org.uk - 650950.jpg|thumb|right|View down New Fetter Lane from [[Holborn Circus]], with [[J Sainsbury]] head office on the right]]\nThe A4 begins as [[Fetter Lane|New Fetter Lane]] in the [[City of London]] at [[Holborn Circus]] on the [[A40 road|A40]]. It goes in a southerly direction to join [[Fleet Street]] where many British national newspapers at one time had their head offices. The [[Office of Fair Trading]] has its main office here.\n\n===Westminster to Hammersmith via Kensington (4.6 miles)===\nThe road heads west through the City of Westminster via the [[Strand, London|Strand]], passing notable landmarks such as the [[Royal Courts of Justice]], the [[Savoy Theatre|Savoy]] and [[Adelphi Theatre|Adelphi theatres]], and [[Charing Cross railway station]].\n\nFrom Charing Cross station to [[Green Park]], the westbound and eastbound routes of the A4 are considerably different, due to one-way systems. Westbound, the A4 continues along the Strand up to [[Charing Cross]] itself, then along [[Cockspur Street]] and into [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]], the location of many exclusive [[gentlemen's club]]s as well as the [[Institute of Directors]], before turning right along St James's Street to reach [[Piccadilly]].\n\nEastbound from Green Park, the A4 runs along the full length of Piccadilly to [[Piccadilly Circus]], before turning right along [[Haymarket (London)|Haymarket]]. It bears left along Pall Mall East, then right along the west side of [[Trafalgar Square]], past the [[National Gallery]] and [[Canada House]], to Charing Cross. Finally, it bears left along the east side of the Square, past [[High Commission of South Africa, London|South Africa House]], then right along Duncannon Street to reach Charing Cross station.\n\nThe first part of [[Regent Street]], from Waterloo Place to Piccadilly Circus, is also signed as the A4; all traffic here runs in a northbound direction.\n\n[[File:PiccadillyCircusLookingDown2005.JPG|thumb|left|[[Piccadilly Circus]]]]\nFrom Green Park, the A4 enters a short tunnel under [[Hyde Park Corner]], where [[Wellington Arch]] is located. Afterwards, the road continues along the first part of [[Knightsbridge]], before bearing left onto [[Brompton Road]]. This is an affluent area of London, in which the [[Harrods]] and [[Harvey Nichols]] department stores are located as well as numerous [[Diplomatic mission|embassies]]. At this point, the road enters the [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]].\n\nAt the [[Brompton Oratory]], the road bears right along Thurloe Place and Cromwell Gardens, past the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] and the [[Ismaili Centre, London|Ismaili Centre]], and onto [[Cromwell Road]], past the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]]. At [[Earls Court]], the A4 becomes [[dual carriageway]], and continues along West Cromwell Road, over the [[West London Line]] into [[West Kensington]] and the [[London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham|Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham]].\n\nA {{convert|5|mi|km|adj=on}} section of the road from Knightsbridge to the [[Chiswick Flyover]] was the first section of [[Clearway#United Kingdom|Cleaway]] designated in London. It introduced no stopping on the road during rush hours on 21 August 1961.<ref>{{cite newspaper |url=https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS203776278/TTDA?u=kccl&sid=TTDA&xid=ec717a62 |work=[[The Times]] |title=Satisfactory First Day For Clearway |issue=55166 |p=12 |date=22 August 1961 |access-date=1 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Hammersmith to Heathrow Airport (10.7 miles)===\n[[File:Hammersmith flyover 6523r.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hammersmith Flyover]]]]\nThe A4 continues along [[Talgarth Road]] past the [[London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art]]. The road becomes elevated at the [[Hammersmith Flyover]] and heads towards [[Heathrow Airport]] along the Great West Road, passing Hammersmith's two churches of [[St Paul's, Hammersmith|St Paul]] and [[St Peter's Church, Hammersmith|St Peter]]. At this point the road is close to the [[River Thames]].\n\nThe road enters [[Chiswick]] and the [[London Borough of Hounslow|Borough of Hounslow]], passing [[Fuller's Brewery]]. After [[Hogarth Roundabout]], the road passes [[Hogarth's House]] and is called Hogarth Lane, then Ellesmere Road and Cedars Road. It becomes the Great West Road again just a few yards short of the start of [[Chiswick Flyover]], which is junction 1 of the M4. [[Gunnersbury]]'s Russian Orthodox Cathedral is clearly visible on the right.\n\nThe road then passes the Glaxo-Smith Kline premises in [[Brentford]] where it follows underneath its successor the M4 as far as the bridge over the [[River Brent]].  The stretch between Chiswick's western border to Syon Lane (Gillette Corner) is known as the [[Golden Mile (Brentford)|Golden Mile]] with some notable Art Deco factories. The road remains as the Great West Road through [[Osterley]] and [[Hounslow]] where it splits with the [[A30 road|A30]], which is known as the Great South West Road. Between the two world wars, the Great West Road was built as a bypass to relieve traffic congestion in Brentford and Hounslow.\n\nAfter the A30, the A4 changes its name to Bath Road, enters [[Cranford, London|Cranford]], and crosses the [[River Crane, London|River Crane]] into the [[London Borough of Hillingdon|Borough of Hillingdon]]. It then passes along the northern boundary of [[Heathrow Airport]], before leaving the London suburbs over the [[M25 motorway|M25]] towards the west.\n\n===Heathrow Airport to Slough (6.7 miles)===\n[[File:A4 - geograph.org.uk - 726146.jpg|thumb|left|The A4 near [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow Airport]]]]\nAfter leaving Heathrow Airport, still the A4, it becomes the [[Colnbrook Bypass]] and climbs over the M25 motorway. This bypass for the narrow main road of [[Colnbrook]] was built after the Second World War across farmland between [[Harmondsworth]] and the outskirts of [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley]].\n\nThe next major intersection is junction 5 of the M4 (Slough-East) known as the Langley junction. At this point the A4 loses its [[trunk road]] classification.\n\nContinuing towards [[Slough]] town centre, the road, now named London Road, passes Kedermister Park on the right. Changing into Sussex Place, the architecturally impressive St Bernard's former convent is on the right. Becoming the dual carriageway Wellington Street (a late 1960s bypass for the High Street), Tesco's massive 'aircraft hangar' supermarket is on the right and the Queensmere and Observatory Shopping Centres on the left.\n\nThe end of this section of the Great Western Road is in the centre of Slough at the junction of William Street and Wellington Street. This spot was formerly the site of Slough's largest roundabout on the south-east corner of Thames Valley University. Nearby is [[Slough railway station]], served by Great Western Railway.\n\nThe roundabout was removed in 2011 and the university's Slough campus closed in 2011 after planning permission was granted for 1,598 flats.\n\n===Slough to Maidenhead (6.0 miles)===\n[[File:Bath Road Slough.jpg|thumb|right|The A4 in [[Slough]]]]\nContinuing from the William Street / Wellington Street junction, in the centre of [[Slough]], the road heads westwards towards Maidenhead. The short stretch of dual carriageway is Wellington Street, then briefly on the most western end of the High Street, over the railway bridge for the line between Slough and [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] Central Station.\n\nThe Bath Road begins on the west side of the bridge. On the left is Slough's 1936 Town Hall, now abandoned by the local council, and on the right [[Salt Hill]] Park.\n\nThe next major road intersection is by the Three Tuns Pub where the A4 crosses the [[A355 road|A355]]. This road goes north towards Farnham Royal, Farnham Common, Beaconsfield and the [[M40 motorway|M40]] at junction 2. To the south, it goes towards the [[M4 motorway|M4]] (junction 6, Slough Centre) and [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]].\n\nThe route at this point runs parallel to both the [[Great Western Main Line]] and the M4.  The road continues past the southern fringe of [[Slough Trading Estate]].\n\n[[File:Maidenhead Bridge (1).jpg|thumb|left|[[Maidenhead Bridge]] crossing the [[River Thames]]]]\nOn Slough's western boundary is the Huntercombe Spur roundabout linking the A4 to junction 7 of the M4 motorway. Here the dual carriageway ends. The road bends right at [[Taplow]] and passes under a high railway bridge, then over the River Thames flood prevention channel.\n\nThe road then goes over Maidenhead's old bridge [[Maidenhead Bridge]], spanning the [[River Thames]], and into the eastern outskirts of Maidenhead.\n\nAlong Bridge Road, St Cloud Way and Bad Godesberg Way respectively. The centre of Maidenhead is reached at the roundabout that forms the junction with the [[A308 road|A308]].  Turning northwards on the A308 would lead to the [[A404 road|A404]] towards [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]] and [[High Wycombe]]. Southwards, the A308 heads towards Windsor and provides an opportunity to branch off for junction 8/9 of the M4.\n\n===Maidenhead to Reading (12.3 miles)===\nHeading out of Maidenhead town centre, the road follows Castle Hill and then Bath Road. At the outskirts, the road forms part of junction 9b of the A404(M)/A404, which links junction 8/9 of the M4 with junction 4 of the M40 at Handy Cross.  The A4 crosses open countryside before following New Bath Road on the outskirts of [[Twyford, Berkshire|Twyford]].  This is a bypass, built in 1929, that deviates from the old route of the A4, and crosses the [[River Loddon]] on its way into the suburbs of [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] via the village of Charvil.\n\nThe A4 passes the King George's Field in [[Sonning]], which are used as playing fields, and the Reading Cricket and [[Reading Hockey Club|Hockey Club]].  As it enters Reading, along the London Road again, it crosses the junction of the A3290 next to [[Palmer Park, Reading|Palmer Park]], which leads to Junction 10 of the M4.\n\n[[File:East Reading, 1976 (4).jpg|thumb|right|[[Cemetery Junction, Reading|Cemetery Junction]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] in 1976]]\nThe A4 goes over the intersection with the [[A329 road|A329]] [[Cemetery Junction, Reading|Cemetery Junction]] which links [[Wokingham]] with [[Pangbourne]], passing the Royal Berkshire Hospital and the London Road Campus of the [[University of Reading]]. At London Street and again at Southampton Street, the A4 meets the [[A327 road|A327]] twice, since the latter loops round on two branches which meet at Whitley Street. Between the two junctions, the A4 becomes Crown Street for approximately 150&nbsp;metres.\n\n===Reading to Newbury (16.7 miles)===\nOn the other side of the intersection the A4 follows Pell Street and continues westward. Here it crosses the [[River Kennet]], the [[Holy Brook]] and the [[A33 road|A33]] relief road, which goes towards [[Basingstoke]]. In [[West Reading, Berkshire|West Reading]], the A4 becomes Berkeley Avenue, and then continues onto the Bath Road. It passes [[Prospect Park, Reading|Prospect Park]], and the suburbs of [[Southcote, Berkshire|Southcote]], Horncastle and [[Calcot, Berkshire|Calcot]], before reaching Junction 12 of the M4. The A4 heads south westerly through [[Theale, Berkshire|Theale]] and over the roundabout connecting it to the [[A340 road|A340]] which heads towards Pangbourne.\n\nHeading towards [[Thatcham]], the road passes [[Aldermaston Wharf]] next to the [[Kennet and Avon Canal]] and through the villages of [[Woolhampton]] and [[Midgham]]. A large industrial estate is on the left as the road enters Thatcham. At the roundabout after the industrial Eestate the route follows London Road and passes Thatcham towards Benham Hill and [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]]. At the Benham Hill roundabout it goes along Bath Road where it deviates from Turnpike Road. Bath Road is the original turnpiked road and the road now confusingly called Turnpike Road was originally called The Shaw Road.<ref>''Thatcham Road Names'', 1991, Roy Tubb</ref> The turnpike then continues along London Road as it enters the outskirts of Newbury.\n\nHeading towards the centre of Newbury, the route passes the [[West Berkshire Community Hospital]] on the right. To the North of the town centre the road becomes part of an unusual junction with the [[A339 road|A339]] that links the new [[A34 road|A34]] by-pass to the north with [[Basingstoke]] to the south.  The junction is a combination of a figure of eight roundabout with an elevated section that used to be the old route of the A34.\n\n===Newbury to Marlborough (18.8 miles)===\n[[File:High Street, Marlborough from St Peter's church roof - geograph.org.uk - 460662.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of High Street, [[Marlborough, Wiltshire|Marlborough]]]]\nAfter the junction, the road heads out of town through [[Speenhamland, Berkshire|Speenhamland]] along Western Avenue and Bath Road to the junction with the A34 [[Newbury bypass]].  The Newbury bypass was opened, after some controversy, on 17 November 1998, at a cost of \u00a3104&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ukrivers.net/newburybypass/newburyopening.html|title=Newbury By-pass Opens|accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref> The route heads over undulating countryside in a fairly straight westward direction towards [[Hungerford]] parallel to the Kennet and Avon Canal and crossing the River Kennet on the outskirts of the town at the same time as intersecting with the [[A338 road|A338]].  The route does not enter the town centre, but continues westward to the northern side of town on its way to Marlborough via the village of Froxfield and the northern edge of [[Savernake Forest]].\n\nOn entering the outskirts of Marlborough the road follows London Road. Crossing the River Kennet again it briefly shares the highway with the [[A346 road|A346]] which connects northwards to [[Swindon]]. It splits again at a roundabout along New Road and Oxford Street into the town centre on the High Street. The High Street is a traditional main thoroughfare for an English market town, in that it is wide, with space for market stalls on either side and in the middle, though these spaces are usually marked for car parking.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getcom2.php?id=155.|title= Marlborough History|accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nUntil the late 1980s most of this section, and some of the following Wiltshire section, was configured as three lanes, with the central lane available for overtaking traffic in either direction.  This is no longer considered safe so the road now has one wider-than-normal lane in each direction, with [[Traffic island|ghost island]]s at junctions to discourage overtaking at these points.\n\n===Marlborough to Chippenham (18.9 miles)===\n[[File:Silbury Hill, Wiltshire. - geograph.org.uk - 364299.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of [[Silbury Hill]]]]\nThe A4 continues along the High Street on its way out of Marlborough via Bridewell Street and Bath Road. The road passes underneath a covered bridge that links Morris House of [[Marlborough College]] to the North Block of the same establishment.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.marlboroughcollege.org/col_morris_house.aspx| title= Marlborough College| accessdate= 5 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100405092134/http://www.marlboroughcollege.org/col_morris_house.aspx| archivedate= 5 April 2010| url-status= dead| df= dmy-all}}</ref> The college is an independent boarding school established in 1843 using some of the buildings that remained after the demise the coaching trade, which saw the original Castle Inn Coaching House close.\n\nThe route continues westward through the village of [[Fyfield, Wiltshire|Fyfield]], across [[Overton Hill]] where there is a parking area at the start of the [[Ridgeway National Trail]] and through the village of [[West Kennet]]. On leaving West Kennet there are some parking lay-bys where visitors can walk a short distance from the road to the Neolithic [[West Kennet Long Barrow]], which forms part of the Avebury World Heritage Site.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.16504| title= West Kennet Long Barrow|accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref> One mile further along the A4 is [[Silbury Hill]], which is also part of the Avebury World Heritage Site.

It is mentioned in ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'' novel by [[Charles Dickens]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.aboutbritain.com/towns/beckhampton.asp | title= Waggon & Horses Inn|accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cherhillwhitehorse.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cherhill White Horse]] as seen from the A4]]\nThe route continues past [[Cherhill]] and the [[Cherhill White Horse]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.wiltshirewhitehorses.org.uk/cherhill.html | title= Cherhill White Horse|accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref> can be seen to the left and nearby the [[Lansdowne Monument]]. The route then descends down the Labour in Vain Hill through the village of [[Quemerford]] and into the market town of [[Calne]].\nHeading towards the town centre, the road crosses a double mini roundabout, one exit forming the junction with the [[A3102 road|A3102]] to Melksham.  It follows New Road and passes by the old [[coaching inn]] of the Lansdowne Strand.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getfaq.php?id=59|title = Lansdowne Strand |accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref> On the way out of Calne, the road goes along Curzon Street, and then to Chilvester Hill at the roundabout where the northern part of the A3102 splits off towards [[Lyneham, Wiltshire|Lyneham]].\n\nThe A4 descends steeply before climbing again up Black Dog Hill past the [[Bowood House]] Estate.  The old road used to pass through [[Derry Hill]], but the New Road, as it is called at this point, indicates that the village was bypassed. There follows a steep descent to the junction with the [[A342 road|A342]] [[Devizes]] road and a sharp right turn past the Lysley Arms towards [[Chippenham]].\n\nOn the outskirts of Chippenham is a large roundabout, where the old A4 used to carry straight on down London Road and The Causeway into the Town Centre, which has since been pedestrianised. Most traffic turns left to go round the Pewsham Estate relief road called Pewsham Way, which is now the classified A4 route. After four roundabouts, the A4 turns left in a southerly direction at a roundabout, past the Chippenham Magistrates Court. The route heads downhill over the [[River Avon (Bristol)|River Avon]] on the Avenue [[La Fleche]], named after one of Chippenham's twin towns, to the Bridge Centre roundabout.\n\n===Chippenham to Bath (12.7 miles)===\n[[File:The Paragon Bath.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Paragon, Bath|The Paragon]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]]]\nThe Bridge Centre roundabout forms a junction of the A4 with the [[A420 road|A420]] Bristol Road. The route heads over Rowden Hill past the Chippenham Community Hospital and down to the spot where musician [[Eddie Cochran]] was killed in a car crash on 17 April 1960. A plaque has been placed there in remembrance.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.halletts.co.uk/history.htm |title=Eddie Cochrane Memorial|accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nFrom there it passes under the railway arch built by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] in the 1830s and on to its junction with the [[A350 road|A350]]. From this point onwards it regains its [[trunk road]] status and heads up Chequers Hill towards [[Corsham]]. The road passes through [[Pickwick, Wiltshire|Pickwick]], which used to be a village in its own right. Charles Dickens stayed at the Hare & Hounds Inn and used the village name for the title of his novel ''The Pickwick Papers''.<ref name = Flavin>{{cite book | last = Flavin | first = Steve | title = Corsham Born and Bred | year = 1991 | publisher = S.B.

From the road the [[Box Tunnel]], built as part of the [[Great Western Railway]], can be seen clearly. The road bears to the right at the junction with the [[A365 road|A365]] to [[Melksham]], and criss-crosses with the main railway line as far as the roundabout at [[Bathford]] which forms a junction with the [[A363 road|A363]] towards [[Bradford-on-Avon]]. The road after this roundabout becomes a dual carriageway until the A4 diverts to the left down a slip road, and the remainder becomes the [[A46 road|A46]]; this section, the  {{convert|3|mi|adj=on}} \u00a345&nbsp;million dual-carriageway [[Batheaston]]/[[Swainswick]] Bypass, opened in summer 1996, was highly controversial both at planning and at construction stages.\n\nThe route enters the outskirts of Bath passing by the training grounds of [[Bath RFC]]. After a series of traffic light controlled junctions, the A4 continues straight ahead where it meets the [[A36 road|A36]]. It passes Hedgemead Park and down [[The Paragon, Bath|The Paragon]] before crossing into George Street and to [[Queen Square (Bath)|Queen Square]].\n\n===Bath to Bristol/Avonmouth (19.6 miles)===\n[[File:Avon gorge and cave arp.jpg|thumb|left|A4 passing under the [[Clifton Suspension Bridge]]]]\nIn the original 1922 road numbering list, the A4 ended at the junction between George Street and [[Milsom Street, Bath|Milsom Street]] in Bath. On 1 April 1935, it was extended over the A431 and B4044 to Newbridge, and the A36 to Avonmouth.<ref>[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] file MT39/241 and MT39/246</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/roadlists/1922.shtml|title=1922 Road Lists - Roader's Digest: The SABRE Wiki|website=www.sabre-roads.org.uk}}</ref>\n\nFrom Queen Square, Bath, the A4 carries on to Queen Square Place and Charlotte Street, before heading along the Upper Bristol Road by [[Royal Victoria Park, Bath|Royal Victoria Park]] to Newbridge Road. The road crosses the River Avon on its way to join the A36 and becomes a dual carriageway again until the roundabout that forms the junction with the [[A39 road|A39]] Wells Road at the Globe Inn and exit for the nearby [[Bath Spa University]]. It continues on through the village of [[Saltford]] towards [[Keynsham]] where a roundabout splits the road and the A4 continues as a dual carriageway by-passing the town, crossing over the [[River Chew]] in the process.\n\nThe end of the by-pass coincides with the junction of the Avon Ring Road, the [[A4174 road|A4174]]. The route goes through the suburb of [[Brislington]], going past Arnos Court Park and [[Arnos Vale Cemetery]]. The road runs over a bridge over the [[New Cut (Bristol)|New Cut]] and into Temple Gate where [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station]] is located. The A4 no longer has a defined route from this point to the start of Anchor Road at [[The Centre, Bristol|The Centre]]; originally it went along Victoria Street and Baldwin Street before turning left onto St Augustine's Parade or, later, Broad Quay, but in more recent times it followed Redcliffe Way, via Redcliffe Roundabout (junction with the [[A38 road|A38]]) across [[Queen Square, Bristol|Queen Square]] to [[The Centre, Bristol|The Centre]].  From there it turns back towards [[Bristol Harbour]] via Anchor Road past the [[We The Curious]] science museum.  After another roundabout the A4 follows along Hotwell Road and around a one-way system that merges the A4 with the [[A3029 road|A3029]].\n\nAt this point the A4 regains trunk road classification and passes under the [[Clifton Suspension Bridge]] along the [[Portway, Bristol|Portway]]. It heads out of the city into the suburbs of [[Sea Mills, Bristol|Sea Mills]] and [[Shirehampton]] before going under the [[M5 motorway|M5]] to end at the roundabout that feeds the motorway, the [[M49 motorway|M49]] and [[A403 road|A403]] in Avonmouth.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|A4 road (England)}}\n{{Attached KML|display=inline,title}}\n*[http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/roadlists/f99/4.shtml A4 road] at the [[Society for All British and Irish Road Enthusiasts]]\n\n{{GB A road zone 4}}\n{{Motorways and Trunk Roads in England|state=collapsed}}\n{{Roads in London}}\n{{Transport in Buckinghamshire}}\n{{Transport in Bristol}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:4-0004a}}\n[[Category:Roads in England]]\n[[Category:Streets in London]]\n[[Category:Roads in Berkshire]]\n[[Category:Roads in Bristol]]\n[[Category:Roads in London]]\n[[Category:Roads in Somerset]]\n[[Category:Roads in Wiltshire]]\n[[Category:Elevated overpasses in London]]\n[[Category:Streets in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham]]\n[[Category:Streets in the London Borough of Hillingdon]]\n[[Category:Transport in the London Borough of Hounslow]]\n[[Category:Transport in Greater Reading]]\n[[Category:Streets in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]]\n[[Category:Streets in the City of Westminster]]\n[[Category:A4 road (England)]]\n", "name_user": "Bellowhead678", "label": "safe", "comment": "Eestate->Estate -Fix a typo in one click", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A4_road_(England)"}

More than twenty thousand standards have been set, covering everything from manufactured products and technology to food safety, agriculture, and healthcare.<ref name=\"About_ISO\"/>\n\nUse of the standards aids in the creation of products and services that are safe, reliable, and of good quality. The standards help businesses increase productivity while minimizing errors and waste. By enabling products from different markets to be directly compared, they facilitate companies in entering new markets and assist in the development of global trade on a fair basis. The standards also serve to safeguard consumers and the end-users of products and services, ensuring that certified products conform to the minimum standards set internationally.<ref name=\"About_ISO\"/>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Memory plaque of founding ISA in Prague cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Plaque marking the building in [[Prague]] where the ISO predecessor, the ISA, was founded]]\nThe organization today known as ISO, began in the 1920s as the International Federation of the National Standardizing Associations (ISA).

In October 1946, ISA and UNSCC delegates from 25 countries met in London and agreed to join forces to create the new International Organization for Standardization.

''IEC'' for ''[[International Electrotechnical Commission]]'' is included if the standard results from the work of ISO/IEC JTC1 (the ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee). ''ASTM'' (American Society for Testing and Materials) is used for standards developed in cooperation with [[ASTM International]]. ''yyyy'' and ''IS'' are not used for an incomplete or unpublished standard and, under some circumstances, may be left off the title of a published work.\n\n'''Technical reports'''\n: These are issued when a technical committee or subcommittee has collected data of a different kind from that normally published as an International Standard,<ref name=\"ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004\"/> such as references and explanations.

A publicly available specification is usually \"an intermediate specification, published prior to the development of a full International Standard, or, in IEC may be a 'dual logo' publication published in collaboration with an external organization\".<ref name=\"ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004\"/> By convention, both types of specification are named in a manner similar to the organization's technical reports.\n\nFor example:\n* ISO/TS 16952-1:2006 Technical product documentation \u2014 Reference designation system \u2014 Part 1: General application rules\n* ISO/PAS 11154:2006 Road vehicles \u2014 Roof load carriers\n\n'''Technical corrigenda'''\n: ISO also sometimes issues \"technical corrigenda\" (where \"corrigenda\" is the plural of [[Erratum|corrigendum]]). These are amendments made to existing standards due to minor technical flaws, usability improvements, or limited-applicability extensions. They are generally issued with the expectation that the affected standard will be updated or withdrawn at its next scheduled review.<ref name=\"ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004\"/>\n\n'''ISO guides'''\n:These are meta-standards covering \"matters related to international standardization\".<ref name=\"ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004\"/> They are named using the format ''\"ISO[/IEC] Guide N:yyyy: Title\"''.\n\nFor example:\n* ISO/IEC Guide 2:2004 Standardization and related activities \u2014 General vocabulary\n* ISO/IEC Guide 65:1996 General requirements for bodies operating product certification\n\n===Document copyright===\nISO documents are copyrighted and ISO charges for most copies.

ISO/IEC directives also allow the so-called \"Fast-track procedure\". In this procedure a document is submitted directly for approval as a draft International Standard (DIS) to the ISO member bodies or as a final draft International Standard (FDIS), if the document was developed by an international standardizing body recognized by the ISO Council.<ref name=\"iso-stages\"/>\n\nThe first step\u2014a proposal of work (New Proposal) is approved at the relevant subcommittee or technical committee (e.g.,&nbsp;SC29 and JTC1 respectively in the case of [[Moving Picture Experts Group]] \u2013 ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11). A working group (WG) of experts is set up by the TC/SC for the preparation of a working draft. When the scope of a new work is sufficiently clarified, some of the working groups (e.g.,&nbsp;MPEG) usually make open request for proposals\u2014known as a \"call for proposals\". The first document that is produced, for example, for audio and video coding standards is called a verification model&nbsp;(VM) (previously also called a \"simulation and test model\"). When a sufficient confidence in the stability of the standard under development is reached, a working draft&nbsp;(WD) is produced. This is in the form of a standard, but is kept internal to working group for revision. When a working draft is sufficiently solid and the working group is satisfied that it has developed the best technical solution to the problem being addressed, it becomes a committee draft&nbsp;(CD). If it is required, it is then sent to the P-members of the TC/SC (national bodies) for ballot.\n\nThe committee draft becomes final committee draft (FCD) if the number of positive votes exceeds the quorum. Successive committee drafts may be considered until consensus is reached on the technical content. When consensus is reached, the text is finalized for submission as a draft International Standard (DIS). Then the text is submitted to national bodies for voting and comment within a period of five months. It is approved for submission as a final draft International Standard&nbsp;(FDIS) if a two-thirds majority of the P-members of the TC/SC are in favour and if not more than one-quarter of the total number of votes cast are negative. ISO will then hold a ballot with National Bodies where no technical changes are allowed (yes/no ballot), within a period of two months. It is approved as an International Standard&nbsp;(IS) if a two-thirds majority of the P-members of the TC/SC is in favour and not more than one-quarter of the total number of votes cast are negative. After approval, only minor editorial changes are introduced into the final text. The final text is sent to the ISO central secretariat, which publishes it as the International Standard.<ref name=\"about-mpeg\"/><ref name=\"iso-stages\"/>\n\n== Products named after ISO ==\n\nOn occasion, the fact that many of the ISO-created standards are ubiquitous, has led to common use of \"ISO\" to describe the product that conforms to a standard. Some examples of this are:\n* [[Disk images]] end in the [[file extension]] \"[[ISO image|ISO]]\" to signify that they are using the [[ISO&nbsp;9660]] standard file system as opposed to another file system\u2014hence Discs&nbsp;images commonly are referred to as \"ISOs\".\n* The sensitivity of a photographic film to light (its \"[[film speed]]\") is described by [[ISO&nbsp;6]], [[ISO&nbsp;2240]] and [[ISO&nbsp;5800]]. Hence, the speed of the film often is referred to by its ISO&nbsp;number.\n* As it was originally defined in ISO&nbsp;518, the flash [[hot shoe]] found on cameras often is called the \"ISO&nbsp;shoe\".\n* [[ISO 11783]], which is marketed as ISOBUS.\n* [[ISO 13216]], which is marketed as ISOFIX.\n\n== Criticism and laments ==\n\nWith the exception of a small number of isolated standards,<ref name=\"FreelyAvailableStandards\"/> normally ISO standards are not available free of charge, but for a purchase fee,<ref name=\"iso_shopFAQ\">{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/store/shopping_faqs.htm |title=Shopping FAQs |publisher=ISO |url-status=live |archivedate=5 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005054552/http://www.iso.org/iso/store/shopping_faqs.htm}}</ref> which has been seen by some as unaffordable by small [[Open-source model|open source]] projects.<ref name=\"oreilly2007\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2007/08/where_to_get_iso_standards_on.html |title=Where to get ISO Standards on the Internet free |publisher=oreillynet.com |last=Jelliffe |first=Rick |quote=The lack of free online availability has effectively made ISO standard irrelevant to the (home/hacker section of the) Open Source community. |date=1 August 2007 |url-status=live |archivedate=24 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124060422/http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2007/08/where_to_get_iso_standards_on.html}}</ref>\n\nThe [[ISO/IEC JTC1]] fast-track procedures (\"Fast-track\" as used by [[Office Open XML|OOXML]] and \"PAS\" as used by [[OpenDocument]]) have garnered criticism in relation to the [[standardization of Office Open XML]] (ISO/IEC&nbsp;29500). Martin Bryan, outgoing convenor of [[ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34]] WG1, is quoted as saying:<ref name=\"jtc1_sc34_0940\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jtc1sc34.org/repository/0940.htm |title=Report on WG1 activity for December 2007 Meeting of ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34/WG1 in Kyoto |publisher=iso/jtc1 sc34 |url-status=live |archivedate=12 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812081252/http://www.jtc1sc34.org/repository/0940.htm}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\nI would recommend my successor that it is perhaps time to pass WG1\u2019s outstanding standards over to OASIS, where they can get approval in less than a year and then do a PAS submission to ISO, which will get a lot more attention and be approved much faster than standards currently can be within WG1.\n\nThe disparity of rules for PAS, Fast-Track and ISO committee generated standards is fast making ISO a laughing stock in IT circles. The days of open standards development are fast disappearing. Instead we are getting \"standardization by corporation\".\n</blockquote>\n\nThe computer security entrepreneur and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] founder, [[Mark Shuttleworth]], commented on the [[Standardization of Office Open XML]] process by saying: \"I think it de-values the confidence people have in the standards setting process\", and alleged that ISO did not carry out its responsibility. He also noted that [[Microsoft]] had intensely lobbied many countries that traditionally had not participated in ISO and stacked technical committees with Microsoft employees, solution providers, and resellers sympathetic to Office Open XML:<ref name=\"zdnet_2222\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=2222 |title=Ubuntu's Shuttleworth blames ISO for OOXML's win |publisher=ZDNet.com |date=1 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archivedate=4 April 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404052723/http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=2222 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<blockquote>\nWhen you have a process built on trust and when that trust is abused, ISO should halt the process... ISO is an engineering [[Old boy network|old boys club]] and these things are boring so you have to have a lot of passion \u2026 then suddenly you have an investment of a lot of money and lobbying and you get artificial results. The process is not set up to deal with intensive corporate [[lobbying]] and so you end up with something being a standard that is not clear.\n</blockquote>\n\n== See also ==\n{{div

More than twenty thousand standards have been set, covering everything from manufactured products and technology to food safety, agriculture, and healthcare.<ref name=\"About_ISO\"/>\n\nUse of the standards aids in the creation of products and services that are safe, reliable, and of good quality. The standards help businesses increase productivity while minimizing errors and waste. By enabling products from different markets to be directly compared, they facilitate companies in entering new markets and assist in the development of global trade on a fair basis. The standards also serve to safeguard consumers and the end-users of products and services, ensuring that certified products conform to the minimum standards set internationally.<ref name=\"About_ISO\"/>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Memory plaque of founding ISA in Prague cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Plaque marking the building in [[Prague]] where the ISO predecessor, the ISA, was founded]]\nThe organization today known as ISO, began in the 1920s as the International Federation of the National Standardizing Associations (ISA).

''IEC'' for ''[[International Electrotechnical Commission]]'' is included if the standard results from the work of ISO/IEC JTC1 (the ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee). ''ASTM'' (American Society for Testing and Materials) is used for standards developed in cooperation with [[ASTM International]]. ''yyyy'' and ''IS'' are not used for an incomplete or unpublished standard and, under some circumstances, may be left off the title of a published work.\n\n'''Technical reports'''\n: These are issued when a technical committee or subcommittee has collected data of a different kind from that normally published as an International Standard,<ref name=\"ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004\"/> such as references and explanations. The naming conventions for these are the same as for standards, except ''TR'' prepended instead of ''IS'' in the report's name.\n\nFor example:\n* ISO/IEC TR 17799:2000 Code of Practice for Information Security Management\n* ISO/TR 19033:2000 Technical product documentation \u2014 Metadata for construction documentation\n\n'''Technical and publicly available specifications'''\n: Technical specifications may be produced when \"the subject in question is still under development or where for any other reason there is the future but not immediate possibility of an agreement to publish an International Standard\". A publicly available specification is usually \"an intermediate specification, published prior to the development of a full International Standard, or, in IEC may be a 'dual logo' publication published in collaboration with an external organization\".<ref name=\"ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004\"/> By convention, both types of specification are named in a manner similar to the organization's technical reports.\n\nFor example:\n* ISO/TS 16952-1:2006 Technical product documentation \u2014 Reference designation system \u2014 Part 1: General application rules\n* ISO/PAS 11154:2006 Road vehicles \u2014 Roof load carriers\n\n'''Technical corrigenda'''\n: ISO also sometimes issues \"technical corrigenda\" (where \"corrigenda\" is the plural of [[Erratum|corrigendum]]). These are amendments made to existing standards due to minor technical flaws, usability improvements, or limited-applicability extensions. They are generally issued with the expectation that the affected standard will be updated or withdrawn at its next scheduled review.<ref name=\"ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004\"/>\n\n'''ISO guides'''\n:These are meta-standards covering \"matters related to international standardization\".<ref name=\"ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004\"/> They are named using the format ''\"ISO[/IEC] Guide N:yyyy: Title\"''.\n\nFor example:\n* ISO/IEC Guide 2:2004 Standardization and related activities \u2014 General vocabulary\n* ISO/IEC Guide 65:1996 General requirements for bodies operating product certification\n\n===Document copyright===\nISO documents are copyright and ISO charges for most copies. It does not, however, charge for most draft copies of documents in electronic format. Although they are useful, care must be taken using these drafts as there is the possibility of substantial change before they become finalized as standards.

ISO/IEC directives also allow the so-called \"Fast-track procedure\". In this procedure a document is submitted directly for approval as a draft International Standard (DIS) to the ISO member bodies or as a final draft International Standard (FDIS), if the document was developed by an international standardizing body recognized by the ISO Council.<ref name=\"iso-stages\"/>\n\nThe first step\u2014a proposal of work (New Proposal) is approved at the relevant subcommittee or technical committee (e.g.,&nbsp;SC29 and JTC1 respectively in the case of [[Moving Picture Experts Group]] \u2013 ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11). A working group (WG) of experts is set up by the TC/SC for the preparation of a working draft. When the scope of a new work is sufficiently clarified, some of the working groups (e.g.,&nbsp;MPEG) usually make open request for proposals\u2014known as a \"call for proposals\". The first document that is produced, for example, for audio and video coding standards is called a verification model&nbsp;(VM) (previously also called a \"simulation and test model\"). When a sufficient confidence in the stability of the standard under development is reached, a working draft&nbsp;(WD) is produced. This is in the form of a standard, but is kept internal to working group for revision. When a working draft is sufficiently solid and the working group is satisfied that it has developed the best technical solution to the problem being addressed, it becomes a committee draft&nbsp;(CD). If it is required, it is then sent to the P-members of the TC/SC (national bodies) for ballot.\n\nThe committee draft becomes final committee draft (FCD) if the number of positive votes exceeds the quorum. Successive committee drafts may be considered until consensus is reached on the technical content. When consensus is reached, the text is finalized for submission as a draft International Standard (DIS). Then the text is submitted to national bodies for voting and comment within a period of five months. It is approved for submission as a final draft International Standard&nbsp;(FDIS) if a two-thirds majority of the P-members of the TC/SC are in favour and if not more than one-quarter of the total number of votes cast are negative. ISO will then hold a ballot with National Bodies where no technical changes are allowed (yes/no ballot), within a period of two months. It is approved as an International Standard&nbsp;(IS) if a two-thirds majority of the P-members of the TC/SC is in favour and not more than one-quarter of the total number of votes cast are negative. After approval, only minor editorial changes are introduced into the final text. The final text is sent to the ISO central secretariat, which publishes it as the International Standard.<ref name=\"about-mpeg\"/><ref name=\"iso-stages\"/>\n\n== Products named after ISO ==\n\nOn occasion, the fact that many of the ISO-created standards are ubiquitous, has led to common use of \"ISO\" to describe the product that conforms to a standard. Some examples of this are:\n* [[Disk images]] end in the [[file extension]] \"[[ISO image|ISO]]\" to signify that they are using the [[ISO&nbsp;9660]] standard file system as opposed to another file system\u2014hence Discs&nbsp;images commonly are referred to as \"ISOs\".\n* The sensitivity of a photographic film to light (its \"[[film speed]]\") is described by [[ISO&nbsp;6]], [[ISO&nbsp;2240]] and [[ISO&nbsp;5800]]. Hence, the speed of the film often is referred to by its ISO&nbsp;number.\n* As it was originally defined in ISO&nbsp;518, the flash [[hot shoe]] found on cameras often is called the \"ISO&nbsp;shoe\".\n* [[ISO 11783]], which is marketed as ISOBUS.\n* [[ISO 13216]], which is marketed as ISOFIX.\n\n== Criticism and laments ==\n\nWith the exception of a small number of isolated standards,<ref name=\"FreelyAvailableStandards\"/> normally ISO standards are not available free of charge, but for a purchase fee,<ref name=\"iso_shopFAQ\">{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/store/shopping_faqs.htm |title=Shopping FAQs |publisher=ISO |url-status=live |archivedate=5 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005054552/http://www.iso.org/iso/store/shopping_faqs.htm}}</ref> which has been seen by some as unaffordable by small [[Open-source model|open source]] projects.<ref name=\"oreilly2007\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2007/08/where_to_get_iso_standards_on.html |title=Where to get ISO Standards on the Internet free |publisher=oreillynet.com |last=Jelliffe |first=Rick |quote=The lack of free online availability has effectively made ISO standard irrelevant to the (home/hacker section of the) Open Source community. |date=1 August 2007 |url-status=live |archivedate=24 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124060422/http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2007/08/where_to_get_iso_standards_on.html}}</ref>\n\nThe [[ISO/IEC JTC1]] fast-track procedures (\"Fast-track\" as used by [[Office Open XML|OOXML]] and \"PAS\" as used by [[OpenDocument]]) have garnered criticism in relation to the [[standardization of Office Open XML]] (ISO/IEC&nbsp;29500). Martin Bryan, outgoing convenor of [[ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34]] WG1, is quoted as saying:<ref name=\"jtc1_sc34_0940\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jtc1sc34.org/repository/0940.htm |title=Report on WG1 activity for December 2007 Meeting of ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34/WG1 in Kyoto |publisher=iso/jtc1 sc34 |url-status=live |archivedate=12 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812081252/http://www.jtc1sc34.org/repository/0940.htm}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\nI would recommend my successor that it is perhaps time to pass WG1\u2019s outstanding standards over to OASIS, where they can get approval in less than a year and then do a PAS submission to ISO, which will get a lot more attention and be approved much faster than standards currently can be within WG1.\n\nThe disparity of rules for PAS, Fast-Track and ISO committee generated standards is fast making ISO a laughing stock in IT circles. The days of open standards development are fast disappearing. Instead we are getting \"standardization by corporation\".\n</blockquote>\n\nThe computer security entrepreneur and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] founder, [[Mark Shuttleworth]], commented on the [[Standardization of Office Open XML]] process by saying: \"I think it de-values the confidence people have in the standards setting process\", and alleged that ISO did not carry out its responsibility. He also noted that [[Microsoft]] had intensely lobbied many countries that traditionally had not participated in ISO and stacked technical committees with Microsoft employees, solution providers, and resellers sympathetic to Office Open XML:<ref name=\"zdnet_2222\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=2222 |title=Ubuntu's Shuttleworth blames ISO for OOXML's win |publisher=ZDNet.com |date=1 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archivedate=4 April 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404052723/http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=2222 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<blockquote>\nWhen you have a process built on trust and when that trust is abused, ISO should halt the process...
