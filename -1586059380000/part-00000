A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], Sessions previously served as [[United States Senate|United States senator]] from [[Alabama]] from 1997 to 2017 before resigning that position to serve in the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|administration of President Donald Trump]]. In November 2019, Sessions announced that he would run for his previously-held U.S. Senate seat in [[2020 United States Senate election in Alabama|2020]].\n\nFrom 1981 to 1993, Sessions served as the [[United States Attorney|United States attorney]] for the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Alabama|Southern District of Alabama]]. In 1986, President [[Ronald Reagan]] nominated Sessions to a judgeship on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama. After allegations of racism (which Sessions denied) were made against him in testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, the committee voted against advancing his nomination to the Senate floor; the nomination was later withdrawn. Sessions was elected [[Attorney General of Alabama]] in 1994. In [[1996 United States Senate election in Alabama|1996]], he was elected to the U.S. Senate, and was later re-elected in [[2002 United States Senate election in Alabama|2002]], [[2008 United States Senate election in Alabama|2008]], and [[2014 United States Senate election in Alabama|2014]]. During his Senate tenure, Sessions was considered one of the most [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] members of the U.S. Senate. His Senate voting record includes votes against comprehensive immigration reform (2006), the 2008 [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|bank bailout]], the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2009), and criminal justice reform (2015).\n\nSessions was an early supporter of [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign]], and was nominated by Trump for the post of U.S. Attorney General. He was confirmed on February 8, 2017 and was sworn in on February 9, 2017. In his confirmation hearings, Sessions stated under oath that he did not have contact with Russian officials during the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential campaign]] and that he was unaware of any contact between Trump campaign members and Russian officials. However, in March 2017, news reports revealed that Sessions had twice met with Russian ambassador [[Sergey Kislyak]] in 2016. Sessions later recused himself from any investigations into [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]], and some [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] lawmakers called for his resignation.\n\nAs U.S. attorney general, Sessions rescinded a memo issued by one of his predecessors, [[Eric Holder]], that had sought to curb [[mass incarceration]] by avoiding [[mandatory sentencing]] for drug crimes; he ordered federal prosecutors to begin seeking the maximum criminal charges possible. A staunch opponent of [[illegal immigration]], Sessions adopted a hard line on [[sanctuary city|sanctuary cities]] and told reporters that cities failing to comply with federal immigration policy would lose federal funding. Trump issued an [[Executive Order 13768|executive order]] revoking the cities' funding, but that order was temporarily by a federal judge (and later allowed to stand in a 2020 decision). Sessions also supported [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] prosecutions of [[medical marijuana]] providers. On November 7, 2018, Sessions tendered his resignation at Trump's request following months of public and private conflict over his recusal from investigations relating to Russian election interference.\n\n== Early life and early career ==\n\nSessions was born in [[Selma, Alabama]], on December 24, 1946,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sessions.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/biography |title=Biography of U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama |website=senate.gov |publisher=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress |access-date=November 19, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126075602/http://www.sessions.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/biography |archive-date=November 26, 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref> the son of Jefferson Beauregard Sessions, Jr., and the former Abbie Powe.<ref name=genref1>{{cite web |url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/senators/sessions.htm |title=Ancestry of Jefferson Beauregard \"Jeff\" Sessions III |accessdate=August 4, 2009 |first=Robert |last=Battle |publisher=[[Rootsweb]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811002405/http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/senators/sessions.htm |archivedate=August 11, 2011 }}</ref> Sessions, his father, and his grandfather were named after [[Jefferson Davis]], a U.S. senator and president of the [[Confederate States of America]],<ref name=\"nytimesapuzzojeffsessionsalifelong\">{{cite news |last1=Apuzzo |first1=Matt |last2=LaFraniere |first2=Sharon |title=Jeff Sessions, a Lifelong Outsider, Finds the Inside Track |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/08/us/politics/jeff-sessions-attorney-general.html |accessdate=April 26, 2017 |work=The New York Times |date=January 8, 2017 |quote=Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III was named after his father, who was named after his grandfather, who was named after the Confederate president Jefferson Davis, his parents once said. |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512234719/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/08/us/politics/jeff-sessions-attorney-general.html |archivedate=May 12, 2017}}</ref> and [[P.

A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], Sessions previously served as [[United States Senate|United States senator]] from [[Alabama]] from 1997 to 2017 before resigning that position to serve in the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|administration of President Donald Trump]]. In November 2019, Sessions announced that he would run for his previously-held U.S. Senate seat in [[2020 United States Senate election in Alabama|2020]].\n\nFrom 1981 to 1993, Sessions served as the [[United States Attorney|United States attorney]] for the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Alabama|Southern District of Alabama]]. In 1986, President [[Ronald Reagan]] nominated Sessions to a judgeship on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama. After allegations of racism (which Sessions denied) were made against him in testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, the committee voted against advancing his nomination to the Senate floor; the nomination was later withdrawn. Sessions was elected [[Attorney General of Alabama]] in 1994. In [[1996 United States Senate election in Alabama|1996]], he was elected to the U.S. Senate, and was later re-elected in [[2002 United States Senate election in Alabama|2002]], [[2008 United States Senate election in Alabama|2008]], and [[2014 United States Senate election in Alabama|2014]]. During his Senate tenure, Sessions was considered one of the most [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] members of the U.S. Senate. His Senate voting record includes votes against comprehensive immigration reform (2006), the 2008 [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|bank bailout]], the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2009), and criminal justice reform (2015).\n\nSessions was an early supporter of [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign]], and was nominated by Trump for the post of U.S. Attorney General. He was confirmed on February 8, 2017 and was sworn in on February 9, 2017. In his confirmation hearings, Sessions stated under oath that he did not have contact with Russian officials during the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential campaign]] and that he was unaware of any contact between Trump campaign members and Russian officials. However, in March 2017, news reports revealed that Sessions had twice met with Russian ambassador [[Sergey Kislyak]] in 2016. Sessions later recused himself from any investigations into [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]], and some [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] lawmakers called for his resignation.\n\nAs U.S. attorney general, Sessions rescinded a memo issued by one of his predecessors, [[Eric Holder]], that had sought to curb [[mass incarceration]] by avoiding [[mandatory sentencing]] for drug crimes; he ordered federal prosecutors to begin seeking the maximum criminal charges possible. A staunch opponent of [[illegal immigration]], Sessions adopted a hard line on [[sanctuary city|sanctuary cities]] and told reporters that cities failing to comply with federal immigration policy would lose federal funding. Trump issued an [[Executive Order 13768|executive order]] revoking the cities' funding, but that order was temporarily by a federal judge (and later allowed to stand in a 2020 decision). Sessions also supported [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] prosecutions of [[medical marijuana]] providers. On November 7, 2018, Sessions tendered his resignation at Trump's request following months of public and private conflict over his recusal from investigations relating to Russian election interference.\n\n== Early life and early career ==\n\nSessions was born in [[Selma, Alabama]], on December 24, 1946,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sessions.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/biography |title=Biography of U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama |website=senate.gov |publisher=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress |access-date=November 19, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126075602/http://www.sessions.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/biography |archive-date=November 26, 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref> the son of Jefferson Beauregard Sessions, Jr., and the former Abbie Powe.<ref name=genref1>{{cite web |url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/senators/sessions.htm |title=Ancestry of Jefferson Beauregard \"Jeff\" Sessions III |accessdate=August 4, 2009 |first=Robert |last=Battle |publisher=[[Rootsweb]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811002405/http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/senators/sessions.htm |archivedate=August 11, 2011 }}</ref> Sessions, his father, and his grandfather were named after [[Jefferson Davis]], a U.S. senator and president of the [[Confederate States of America]],<ref name=\"nytimesapuzzojeffsessionsalifelong\">{{cite news |last1=Apuzzo |first1=Matt |last2=LaFraniere |first2=Sharon |title=Jeff Sessions, a Lifelong Outsider, Finds the Inside Track |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/08/us/politics/jeff-sessions-attorney-general.html |accessdate=April 26, 2017 |work=The New York Times |date=January 8, 2017 |quote=Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III was named after his father, who was named after his grandfather, who was named after the Confederate president Jefferson Davis, his parents once said. |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512234719/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/08/us/politics/jeff-sessions-attorney-general.html |archivedate=May 12, 2017}}</ref> and [[P.

Inspired by [[Eric Foner]]\u2019s work on pre-Civil War Republican ideology, Richardson analyzed Republican economic policies during the war. She contended that their efforts to create an activist Federal Government during the Civil War marked a continuation of Republican free labor ideology. These policies, such as war bonds and [[greenback (money)|greenback]]s or the [[Land Grant Colleges|Land Grant College Act]] and the [[Homestead Act]], revolutionized the role of the Federal Government in the U.S. economy. At the same time, these actions laid the groundwork for the Republican Party\u2019s shift to Big Business after the Civil War.\n\nFour years later, Richardson extended her study of Republican policy into the postwar period with ''The Death of Reconstruction'' (2001).<ref name=\"HUP18\">{{cite web | title=The Death of Reconstruction - Heather Cox Richardson | website=Harvard University Press | date=2018-11-16 | url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674013667 | access-date=2018-11-17}}</ref> Unlike other historians, her analysis of the period focused on the \u201cNorthern abandonment of Reconstruction.\u201d Building on the earlier work of [[C. Vann Woodward]], she argued that a more complete understanding of the period required appreciation of class, not only race. As [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] continued into the 1870s and especially the 1880s, Republicans began to view African Americans in the South more from a class perspective and less from the perspective of race that had driven their earlier humanitarianism. In the midst of the labor struggles of the [[Gilded Age]], Republicans came to compare \u201cthe demands of the ex-slaves for land, social services, and civil rights\u201d to the demands of white laborers in the North. This ideological shift was the key to Republican abandonment of Reconstruction, as they chose the protection of their economic and business interests over their desire for racial equality.\n\nIn her third book, ''West from Appomattox: The Reconstruction of America after the Civil War'' (2007), Richardson presented Reconstruction as a national event that impacted all Americans, not just those in the South.<ref name=\"BC18\" /> She incorporated the West into the discussion of Reconstruction as no predecessor had. Between 1865 and 1900, Americans re-imagined the role of the federal government, calling upon it to promote the well-being of its citizens. However, racism, sexism, and greed divided Americans, and the same people who increasingly benefited from government intervention\u2014white, middle-class Americans\u2014actively excluded African-Americans, Native Americans, immigrants, and organized laborers from the newfound bounties of their reconstructed nation.<ref name=\"Slap2009\">{{cite journal | last=Slap | first=Andrew L. | title=West from Appomattox: The Reconstruction of America after the Civil War (review) | journal=Civil War History | volume=55 | issue=3 | date=2009-08-22 | issn=1533-6271 | doi=10.1353/cwh.0.0084 | pages=407\u2013409 | url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/315133/pdf | access-date=2018-11-17}}</ref>\n\nHer fourth book, ''Wounded Knee: Party Politics and the Road to an American Massacre'' (2010), focused on the U.S. Army\u2019s slaughter of Native Americans in South Dakota in 1890.<ref name=\"Zasky 2010\">{{cite web | last=Zasky | first=Jason | title=Wounded Knee: Party politics and an American massacre - Heather Cox Richardson interview | website=Failure magazine | date=2010-07-27 | url=http://failuremag.com/article/wounded-knee | access-date=2018-11-17}}</ref> She argued that party politics and opportunism led to [[Wounded Knee Massacre|Wounded Knee]]. After a bruising midterm election, President [[Benjamin Harrison]] needed to shore up his support. To do so, he turned to [[The Dakotas]], where he replaced seasoned Indian agents with unqualified political allies, who incorrectly assumed that the [[Ghost Dance]] Movement presaged war. The Army responded by sending one third of its force in order to avoid spending cuts from Congress. After the event, Republicans tried to paint the massacre as a heroic battle to stifle the resurgent Democrats.\n\nIn her latest book, ''To Make Men Free: A History of the Republican Party'' (2014), Richardson extended her study of the Republican Party into the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.<ref name=\"NYT15\">{{cite web | title=\u2018To Make Men Free,\u2019 by Heather Cox Richardson | website=The New York Times | date=2015-01-04 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/books/review/to-make-men-free-by-heather-cox-richardson.html | access-date=2018-11-17}}</ref> This book studied the entire life of the GOP, from its inception in the 1850s through the presidency of [[George W.

These Republicans articulated a new vision of an America in which all hardworking men could rise. But after the Civil War, Republicans began to emulate what they originally opposed. They tied themselves to powerful bankers and industrialists, sacrificing the well-being of ordinary Americans. A similar process took place after [[World War II]], when Republicans sought to dismantle successful [[New Deal]] policies and prop up the wealthy. However, in both cases, reformers within the party were able to return the GOP to its founding vision of equality of opportunity, first [[Theodore Roosevelt]] during the Progressive Era, and then [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], who enforced integration and maintained the New Deal. The Nixon and Reagan administrations have represented yet another fall from the GOP\u2019s founding purpose. It's ironic, Richardson points out, that Republicans treated [[Barack Obama]] with an unprecedented level of disrespect, as Obama's rise from humble beginnings to the highest office in the nation embodied the vision of the original Republicans.\n\n==== Newsletter ====\nIn late 2019, Richardson began writing a daily synopsis of political events surrounding the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump.

Between 1865 and 1900, Americans re-imagined the role of the federal government, calling upon it to promote the well-being of its citizens. However, racism, sexism, and greed divided Americans, and the same people who increasingly benefited from government intervention\u2014white, middle-class Americans\u2014actively excluded African-Americans, Native Americans, immigrants, and organized laborers from the newfound bounties of their reconstructed nation.<ref name=\"Slap2009\">{{cite journal | last=Slap | first=Andrew L. | title=West from Appomattox: The Reconstruction of America after the Civil War (review) | journal=Civil War History | volume=55 | issue=3 | date=2009-08-22 | issn=1533-6271 | doi=10.1353/cwh.0.0084 | pages=407\u2013409 | url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/315133/pdf | access-date=2018-11-17}}</ref>\n\nHer fourth book, ''Wounded Knee: Party Politics and the Road to an American Massacre'' (2010), focused on the U.S. Army\u2019s slaughter of Native Americans in South Dakota in 1890.<ref name=\"Zasky 2010\">{{cite web | last=Zasky | first=Jason | title=Wounded Knee: Party politics and an American massacre - Heather Cox Richardson interview | website=Failure magazine | date=2010-07-27 | url=http://failuremag.com/article/wounded-knee | access-date=2018-11-17}}</ref> She argued that party politics and opportunism led to [[Wounded Knee Massacre|Wounded Knee]]. After a bruising midterm election, President [[Benjamin Harrison]] needed to shore up his support. To do so, he turned to [[The Dakotas]], where he replaced seasoned Indian agents with unqualified political allies, who incorrectly assumed that the [[Ghost Dance]] Movement presaged war. The Army responded by sending one third of its force in order to avoid spending cuts from Congress. After the event, Republicans tried to paint the massacre as a heroic battle to stifle the resurgent Democrats.\n\nIn her latest book, ''To Make Men Free: A History of the Republican Party'' (2014), Richardson extended her study of the Republican Party into the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.<ref name=\"NYT15\">{{cite web | title=\u2018To Make Men Free,\u2019 by Heather Cox Richardson | website=The New York Times | date=2015-01-04 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/books/review/to-make-men-free-by-heather-cox-richardson.html | access-date=2018-11-17}}</ref> This book studied the entire life of the GOP, from its inception in the 1850s through the presidency of [[George W.

These Republicans articulated a new vision of an America in which all hardworking men could rise. But after the Civil War, Republicans began to emulate what they originally opposed. They tied themselves to powerful bankers and industrialists, sacrificing the well-being of ordinary Americans. A similar process took place after [[World War II]], when Republicans sought to dismantle successful [[New Deal]] policies and prop up the wealthy. However, in both cases, reformers within the party were able to return the GOP to its founding vision of equality of opportunity, first [[Theodore Roosevelt]] during the Progressive Era, and then [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], who enforced integration and maintained the New Deal. The Nixon and Reagan administrations have represented yet another fall from the GOP\u2019s founding purpose. It's ironic, Richardson points out, that Republicans treated [[Barack Obama]] with an unprecedented level of disrespect, as Obama's rise from humble beginnings to the highest office in the nation embodied the vision of the original Republicans.\n\n==== Newsletter ====\nIn late 2019, Richardson began writing a daily synopsis of political events surrounding the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump.

Taxes consist of [[direct tax|direct]] or [[indirect tax]]es and may be paid in money or as its labour equivalent. The first known taxation took place in Ancient Egypt around 3000\u20132800 BC.\n\nMost countries have a tax system in place to pay for public, common or agreed national needs and government functions. Some levy a [[flat tax|flat percentage rate]] of taxation on personal annual income, but most [[progressive tax|scale taxes]] based on annual income amounts. Most countries charge a tax on an individual's [[income tax|income]] as well as on [[corporate tax|corporate income]]. Countries or subunits often also impose [[wealth tax]]es, [[inheritance tax]]es, [[Estate tax in the United States|estate taxes]], [[gift tax]]es, [[property tax]]es, [[sales tax]]es, [[payroll tax]]es or [[tariff]]s.\n\nIn economic terms, taxation transfers wealth from households or businesses to the government. This has effects which can both increase and reduce economic growth and economic welfare. Consequently, taxation is a highly debated topic.\n{{TOC limit}}\n==Overview==\n[[File:Pieter Brueghel the Younger, 'Paying the Tax (The Tax Collector)' oil on panel, 1620-1640. USC Fisher Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]], ''The tax collector's office'', 1640]]\n\nThe legal definition, and the economic definition of taxes differ in some ways such as economists do not regard many transfers to governments as taxes. For example, some transfers to the public sector are comparable to prices. Examples include, tuition at public universities, and fees for utilities provided by local governments. Governments also obtain resources by \"creating\" money and coins (for example, by printing bills and by minting coins), through voluntary gifts (for example, contributions to public universities and museums), by imposing penalties (such as traffic fines), by borrowing, and also by confiscating wealth. From the view of economists, a tax is a non-penal, yet compulsory transfer of resources from the private to the [[public sector]], levied on a basis of predetermined criteria and without reference to specific benefit received.\n\nIn modern taxation systems, governments levy taxes in money; but [[In kind|in-kind]] and ''[[corv\u00e9e]]'' taxation are characteristic of traditional or pre-[[capitalism|capitalist]] states and their functional equivalents. The method of taxation and the government expenditure of taxes raised is often highly debated in [[politics]] and [[economics]]. Tax collection is performed by a government agency such as the [[Ghana Revenue Authority]], [[Canada Revenue Agency]], the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) in the [[United States]], [[Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs]] (HMRC) in the [[United Kingdom]] or [[Federal Tax Service (Russia)|Federal Tax Service]] in Russia. When taxes are not fully paid, the state may impose civil penalties (such as [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] or [[Asset forfeiture|forfeiture]]) or criminal penalties (such as [[incarceration]]) on the non-paying entity or individual.<ref>See for example {{usc|26|7203}} in the case of U.S. Federal taxes.</ref>\n\n==Purposes & effects==\n\nThe levying of taxes aims to raise revenue to fund [[government|governing]] or to alter prices in order to affect demand. States and their functional equivalents throughout history have used money provided by taxation to carry out many functions. Some of these include expenditures on economic infrastructure ([[road]]s, public transportation, sanitation, legal systems, public safety, education, [[health care system|health-care systems]]), military, scientific research, culture and the arts, [[public works]], distribution, data collection and dissemination, public insurance, and the operation of government itself. A government's ability to raise taxes is called its [[fiscal capacity]].\n\nWhen expenditures exceed tax revenue, a government accumulates debt.  A portion of taxes may be used to service past debts. Governments also use taxes to fund [[social welfare|welfare]] and [[public services]]. These services can include [[education system]]s, [[pension]]s for the elderly, [[unemployment benefits]], and [[public transportation]]. [[Electric utility|Energy]], [[water management|water]] and [[waste management]] systems are also common [[Public utility|public utilities]].\n\nAccording to the proponents of the [[Chartalism|chartalist theory]] of money creation, taxes are not needed for government revenue, as long as the government in question is able to issue [[fiat money]]. According to this view, the purpose of taxation is to maintain the stability of the currency, express public policy regarding the distribution of wealth, subsidizing certain industries or population groups or isolating the costs of certain benefits, such as highways or social security.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Beardsley|first1=Ruml|title=Taxes for Revenue are Obsolete |journal=American Affairs|volume = VIII|issue = 1|url=http://www.constitution.org/tax/us-ic/cmt/ruml_obsolete.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314025345/http://www.constitution.org/tax/us-ic/cmt/ruml_obsolete.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nEffects can be divided in two fundamental categories:\n\n* Taxes cause an [[Income Effect|income effect]] because they reduce [[purchasing power]] to taxpayers.\n* Taxes cause a [[substitution effect]] when taxation causes a substitution between taxed goods and untaxed goods.\n\n[[File:Substitution effect.png|thumb|265.99x265.99px|Substitution effect and income effect with a taxation on y good.]]\nIf we consider, for instance, two [[normal good]]s, ''x'' and ''y,'' whose prices are respectively ''p<sub>x</sub>'' and ''p<sub>y</sub>'' and an individual budget constraint given by the equation ''xp<sub>x</sub>'' + ''yp<sub>y</sub>'' = Y, where Y is the income, the slope of the budget constraint, in a graph where is represented good ''x'' on the vertical axis and good ''y'' on the horizontal axes, is equal to -''p<sub>y</sub>''/''p<sub>x</sub>'' . The initial equilibrium is in the point (C), in which [[budget constraint]] and [[indifference curve]] are [[tangent]], introducing an ''[[ad valorem tax]]'' on the ''y'' good (budget constraint: ''p<sub>x</sub>x'' + ''p<sub>y</sub>''(1 + ''\u03c4'')''y ='' Y'')'' , the budget constraint's slope becomes equal to -''p<sub>y</sub>''(1 + \u03c4)/''p<sub>x</sub>''. The new equilibrium is now in the tangent point (A) with a lower indifferent curve.\n\nAs can be noticed the tax's introduction causes two consequences:\n\n# It changes the consumers' real income (less purchasing power)\n# It raises the relative price of ''y'' good.\n\nThe income effect shows the variation of ''y'' good quantity given by the change of real income.The substitution effect shows the variation of ''y'' good determined by relative prices' variation. This kind of taxation (that causes substitution effect) can be considered distortionary.\n[[File:Income effect.PNG|thumb|Budget's constraint shift after an introduction of a lump sum tax or a general tax on consumption or a proportional income tax.]]\nAnother example can be the Introduction of an income [[lump-sum tax]] (''xp<sub>x</sub>'' + ''yp<sub>y</sub>'' = Y - T), with a parallel shift downward of the budget constraint, can be produced a higher revenue with the same loss of consumers' utility compared with the property tax case, from another point of view, the same revenue can be produced with a lower utility sacrifice. The lower utility (with the same revenue) or the lower revenue (with the same utility) given by a distortionary tax are called excess pressure. The same result, reached with an income lump-sum tax, can be obtained with these following types of taxes (all of them cause only a budget constraint's shift without causing a substitution effect), the budget constraint's slope remains the same (-''p<sub>x</sub>''/''p<sub>y</sub>''):\n\n* A general tax on consumption: (Budget constraint: ''p<sub>x</sub>''(1 + \u03c4)''x'' + ''p<sub>y</sub>''(1 + \u03c4)''y ='' Y)\n* A proportional income tax: (Budget constraint: ''xp<sub>x</sub>'' + ''yp<sub>y</sub>'' = Y(1 - ''t''))\n\nWhen the t and \u03c4 rates are chosen respecting this equation (where t is the rate of income tax and tau is the consumption tax's rate):\n\n<math>\\frac{1}{1+\\tau}=1-t\\Rightarrow t=\\frac{\\tau}{1+\\tau}</math>\n\nthe effects of the two taxes are the same.\n\nA tax effectively changes relative prices of products. Therefore, most{{quantify|date=December 2016}} economists, especially [[neo-classical economics|neoclassical economists]], argue that taxation creates [[market distortion]] and results in economic inefficiency unless there are (positive or negative) externalities associated with the activities that are taxed that need to be internalized to reach an efficient market outcome. They have therefore sought to identify the kind of tax system that would minimize this distortion.\nRecent{{when|date=December 2016}} scholarship suggests that in the [[United States|United States of America]], the federal government effectively taxes investments in higher education more heavily than it subsidizes higher education, thereby contributing to a shortage of skilled workers and unusually high differences in pre-tax earnings between highly educated and less-educated workers.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nTaxes can even have effects on labour supply: we can consider a model in which the consumer chooses the number of hours spent working and the amount spent on consumption. Let us suppose that only one good exists and no income is saved.\n\nConsumers have a given number of hours (H) that is divided between work (L) and free time (F = H - L). The hourly wage is called ''w'' and it tells us the free time's [[opportunity cost]], i.e. the income to which the individual renounces consuming an additional hour of free time. Consumption and hours of work have a positive relationship, more hours of work mean more earnings and, assuming that workers don't save money, more earnings imply an increase in consumption (Y = C = ''w''L). Free time and consumption can be considered as two normal goods (workers have to decide between working one hour more, that would mean consuming more, or having one more hour of free time) and the budget constraint is negative inclined (Y = ''w''(H - F)). The [[indifference curve]] related to these two goods has a negative slope and free time becomes more and more important with high levels of consumption. It's because a high level of consumption means that people are already spending many hours working, so, in this situation, they need more free time than consume and it implies that they have to be paid with a higher salary to work an additional hour. A proportional income tax, changing budget constraint's slope (now Y = ''w''(1 - ''t'')(H - F)), implies both substitution and income effects. The problem now is that the two effects go in opposite ways: income effect tells us that, with an income tax, the consumer feels poorer and for this reason he wants to work more, causing an increase in labour offer. On the other hand, substitution effect tells us that free time, being a normal good, is now more convenient compared to consume and it implies a decrease in labour offer. Therefore, the total effect can be both an increase or a decrease of labour offer, depending on indifference curve's shape. \n[[File:LafferCurve.svg|thumb|The Laffer curve. In this case, the critical point is at a tax rate of 70%. Revenue increases<ref>{{Cite book|title=Elementi di scienza delle finanze|last=Artoni|first=Roberto|publisher=il Mulino|year=2015}}</ref> until this peak, then it starts decreasing.]]\nThe [[Laffer curve]] depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue.\n\nGovernments use different kinds of taxes and vary the tax rates. They do this in order to distribute the tax burden among individuals or classes of the population involved in taxable activities, such as the [[business sector]], or to redistribute resources between individuals or classes in the population. Historically,{{when|date=December 2016}} taxes on the poor supported the [[nobility]]; modern [[social security|social-security]] systems aim to support the poor, the disabled, or the retired by taxes on those who are still working. In addition, taxes are applied to fund foreign aid and military ventures, to influence the [[macroeconomic]] performance of the economy (a government's strategy for doing this is called its [[fiscal policy]]; see also [[tax exemption]]), or to modify patterns of consumption or employment within an economy, by making some classes of transaction more or less attractive.\n\nA state's tax system often{{quantify|date=December 2016}} reflects its communal values and the values of those in current political power. To create a system of taxation, a state must make choices regarding the distribution of the tax burden\u2014who will pay taxes and how much they will pay\u2014and how the taxes collected will be spent. In democratic nations where the public elects those in charge of establishing or administering the tax system, these choices reflect the type of community that the public wishes to create. In countries where the public does not have a significant amount of influence over the system of taxation, that system may reflect more closely the values of those in power.\n\nAll large [[business]]es incur administrative costs in the process of delivering revenue collected from customers to the suppliers of the goods or services being purchased. Taxation is no different; the resource collected from the public through taxation is always greater than the amount which can be used by the government.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} The difference is called the [[compliance cost]] and includes (for example) the labour cost and other expenses incurred in complying with tax laws and rules. The collection of a tax in order to spend it on a specified purpose, for example collecting a tax on alcohol to pay directly for alcoholism-rehabilitation centres, is called [[hypothecation (taxation)|hypothecation]]. [[Finance minister]]s often dislike this practice, since it reduces their freedom of action. Some economic theorists regard hypothecation as intellectually dishonest since, in reality, money is [[fungibility|fungible]]. Furthermore, it often happens that taxes or excises initially levied to fund some specific government programs are then later diverted to the government general fund. In some cases, such taxes are collected in fundamentally inefficient ways, for example, though highway tolls.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nSince governments also resolve commercial disputes, especially in countries with [[common law]], similar arguments are sometimes used to justify a [[sales tax]] or [[value added tax]]. Some ([[Libertarianism|libertarians]], for example) portray most or all forms of taxes as [[Taxation as theft|immoral]] due to their involuntary (and therefore eventually [[Harm principle|coercive or violent]]) nature. The most extreme anti-tax view, [[anarcho-capitalism]], holds that all social services should be voluntarily bought by the people using them.\n\n==Types==\nThe [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) publishes an analysis of the tax systems of member countries. As part of such analysis, OECD has developed a definition and system of classification of internal taxes,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.oecd.org/daf/mai/pdf/eg2/eg2963e.pdf |title= Definition of Taxes (Note by the Chairman), 1996 |accessdate= 22 January 2013}}</ref> generally followed below. In addition, many countries impose taxes ([[tariff]]s) on the import of goods.\n\n===Income===\n\n====Income tax====\n{{Main|Income tax}}\nMany jurisdictions tax the income of individuals and [[business entities]], including [[corporation]]s. Generally, the authorities impose tax on net profits from a business, on net gains, and on other income. Computation of income subject to tax may be determined under accounting principles used in the jurisdiction, which may be modified or replaced by [[tax law|tax-law]] principles in the jurisdiction. The [[Tax incidence|incidence of taxation]] varies by system, and some systems may be viewed{{by whom|date=October 2018}} as [[Progressive tax|progressive]] or [[Regressive tax|regressive]]. Rates of tax may vary or be constant (flat) by income level. Many systems allow individuals certain personal allowances and other non-business reductions to taxable income, although business deductions tend to be favored over personal deductions.\n\n[[Personal income tax]] is often collected on a [[PAYE|pay-as-you-earn]] basis, with small corrections made soon after the end of the [[tax year]]. These corrections take one of two forms: payments to the government, for taxpayers who have not paid enough during the tax year; and [[tax refund]]s from the government to those who have overpaid. Income-tax systems will often have deductions available that reduces the total tax liability by reducing total taxable income. They may allow losses from one type of income to count against another. For example, a loss on the stock market may be deducted against taxes paid on wages. Other tax systems may isolate the loss, such that business losses can only be deducted against business tax by carrying forward the loss to later tax years.\n\n====Negative income====\n{{Main|Negative income tax}}\nIn economics, a negative income tax (abbreviated NIT) is a [[progressive income tax]] system where people earning below a certain amount receive supplemental payment from the government instead of paying taxes to the government.\n\n====Capital gains====\n{{Main|Capital gains tax}}\nMost jurisdictions imposing an income tax treat [[capital gain]]s as part of income subject to tax. Capital gain is generally a gain on sale of capital assets\u2014that is, those assets not held for sale in the ordinary course of business. Capital assets include personal assets in many jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions provide preferential rates of tax or only partial taxation for capital gains. Some jurisdictions impose different rates or levels of capital-gains taxation based on the length of time the asset was held. Because tax rates are often much lower for capital gains than for ordinary income, there is widespread controversy and dispute about the proper definition of capital.\n\n====Corporate====\n{{Main|Corporate tax}}\nCorporate tax refers to income tax, capital tax, net-worth tax or other taxes imposed on corporations. Rates of tax and the taxable base for corporations may differ from those for individuals or for other taxable persons.\n\n===Social-security contributions===\n[[File:GDP per capita PPP vs social contributions 2016.svg|thumb|[[Public finance|General government]] revenue, in % of [[GDP]], from social contributions.

Tax rates are generally fixed, but a different rate may be imposed on employers than on employees.<ref>See for example [http://labour.nic.in/ss/overview.html India Social Security overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623221835/http://labour.nic.in/ss/overview.html |date=23 June 2011 }}</ref> Some systems provide an upper limit on earnings subject to the tax. A few systems provide that the tax is payable only on wages above a particular amount. Such upper or lower limits may apply for retirement but not for health-care components of the tax. Some{{who|date=October 2018}} have argued that such taxes on wages are a form of \"forced savings\" and not really a tax, while others point to redistribution through such systems between generations (from newer cohorts to older cohorts) and across income levels (from higher income-levels to lower income-levels) which suggests that such programs are really tax and spending programs.\n\n===Payroll or workforce===\n{{Main|Payroll tax}}Unemployment and similar taxes are often imposed on employers based on total payroll. These taxes may be imposed in both the country and sub-country levels.<ref>See for example the United States [[Federal Unemployment Tax Act]].</ref>\n\n===Wealth===\nA '''wealth tax''' is a levy on the total value of personal assets, including: bank deposits, real estate, assets in insurance and pension plans, ownership of [[unincorporated entity|unincorporated businesses]], [[Security (finance)|financial securities]], and personal trusts.<ref name=\"EWBR\">Edward N.

In addition, recurrent taxes may be imposed on the net wealth of individuals or corporations.<ref>Taxes on the net wealth of corporations are often referred to as [[corporate tax]].</ref> Many jurisdictions impose [[estate tax]], [[gift tax]] or other [[inheritance tax]]es on property at death or at the time of gift transfer. Some jurisdictions impose [[Financial transaction tax|taxes on financial or capital transactions]].\n\n====Property taxes====\n{{Main|Property tax|Land value tax}}\nA property tax (or millage tax) is an [[ad valorem tax|''ad valorem'' tax]] levy on the value of property that the owner of the property is required to pay to a government in which the property is situated. Multiple jurisdictions may tax the same property. There are three general varieties of property: land, improvements to land (immovable man-made things, e.g. buildings) and personal property (movable things). [[Real property|Real estate]] or realty is the combination of land and improvements to land.\n\nProperty taxes are usually charged on a recurrent basis (e.g., yearly). A common type of property tax is an annual charge on the ownership of [[real estate]], where the tax base is the estimated value of the property. For a period of over 150 years from 1695 the government of England levied a [[window tax]], with the result that one can still see [[listed buildings]] with windows bricked up in order to save their owners money. A similar tax on hearths existed in France and elsewhere, with similar results. The two most common types of event-driven property taxes are [[stamp duty]], charged upon change of ownership, and [[inheritance tax]], which many countries impose on the estates of the deceased.\n\nIn contrast with a tax on real estate (land and buildings), a [[land value tax|land-value tax]] (or LVT) is levied only on the unimproved value of the land (\"land\" in this instance may mean either the economic term, i.e., all natural resources, or the natural resources associated with specific areas of the Earth's surface: \"lots\" or \"land parcels\"). Proponents of land-value tax argue that it is economically justified, as it will not deter production, distort market mechanisms or otherwise create [[deadweight loss]]es the way other taxes do.<ref>{{Cite book |last= McCluskey |first= William J. |last2= Franzsen |first2= Ri\u00ebl C. D. |title= Land Value Taxation: An Applied Analysis |page= 4 |publisher= Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |year= 2005 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jkogP2U4k0AC&pg=PA73|isbn= 978-0-7546-1490-6}}</ref>\n\nWhen real estate is held by a higher government unit or some other entity not subject to taxation by the local government, the taxing authority may receive a [[PILOT (finance)|payment in lieu of taxes]] to compensate it for some or all of the foregone tax revenues.\n\nIn many jurisdictions (including many American states), there is a general tax levied periodically on residents who own [[personal property]] (personalty) within the jurisdiction. Vehicle and boat registration fees are subsets of this kind of tax. The tax is often designed with blanket coverage and large exceptions for things like food and clothing. Household goods are often exempt when kept or used within the household.<ref name=\"taxpolicycenter1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxtopics/budget.cfm |title=TPC Tax Topics &#124; Federal Budget |publisher=Taxpolicycenter.org |accessdate=27 March 2009}}</ref> Any otherwise non-exempt object can lose its exemption if regularly kept outside the household.<ref name=\"taxpolicycenter1\" /> Thus, tax collectors often monitor newspaper articles for stories about wealthy people who have lent art to museums for public display, because the artworks have then become subject to personal property tax.<ref name=\"taxpolicycenter1\" /> If an artwork had to be sent to another state for some touch-ups, it may have become subject to personal property tax in ''that'' state as well.<ref name=\"taxpolicycenter1\" />\n\n====Inheritance====\n{{Main|Inheritance tax}}\nInheritance tax, estate tax, and death tax or duty are the names given to various taxes which arise on the death of an individual. In United States [[tax law]], there is a distinction between an estate tax and an inheritance tax: the former taxes the personal representatives of the deceased, while the latter taxes the beneficiaries of the estate. However, this distinction does not apply in other jurisdictions; for example, if using this terminology UK inheritance tax would be an estate tax.\n\n====Expatriation====\n{{Main|Expatriation tax}}\nAn expatriation tax is a tax on individuals who renounce their [[citizenship]] or residence. The tax is often imposed based on a deemed disposition of all the individual's property. One example is the [[United States]] under the ''[[American Jobs Creation Act]]'', where any individual who has a net worth of $2 million or an average income-tax liability of $127,000 who renounces his or her citizenship and leaves the country is automatically assumed to have done so for tax avoidance reasons and is subject to a higher tax rate.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/877- |title=26 USC 877 |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |accessdate=22 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Transfer====\n{{Main|Transfer tax}}\nHistorically, in many countries, a contract needs to have a stamp affixed to make it valid. The charge for the stamp is either a fixed amount or a percentage of the value of the transaction. In most countries, the stamp has been abolished but [[stamp duty]] remains. Stamp duty is levied in the UK on the purchase of shares and securities, the issue of bearer instruments, and certain partnership transactions. Its modern derivatives, [[stamp duty reserve tax]] and [[stamp duty land tax]], are respectively charged on transactions involving securities and land. Stamp duty has the effect of discouraging speculative purchases of assets by decreasing liquidity. In the [[United States]], transfer tax is often charged by the state or local government and (in the case of real property transfers) can be tied to the recording of the deed or other transfer documents.\n\n====Wealth (net worth)====\n{{Main|Wealth tax}}\nSome countries' governments will require declaration of the tax payers' [[balance sheet]] (assets and liabilities), and from that exact a tax on [[net worth]] (assets minus liabilities), as a percentage of the net worth, or a percentage of the net worth exceeding a certain level. The tax may be levied on \"[[natural person|natural]]\" or \"[[juristic person|legal persons.]]\"\n\n===Goods and services===\n====Value added====\n{{Main|Value added tax}}\nA value added tax (VAT), also known as Goods and Services Tax (G.S.T), Single Business Tax, or Turnover Tax in some countries, applies the equivalent of a sales tax to every operation that creates value. To give an example, sheet steel is imported by a machine manufacturer. That manufacturer will pay the VAT on the purchase price, remitting that amount to the government. The manufacturer will then transform the steel into a machine, selling the machine for a higher price to a wholesale distributor. The manufacturer will collect the VAT on the higher price, but will remit to the government only the excess related to the \"value added\" (the price over the cost of the sheet steel). The wholesale distributor will then continue the process, charging the retail distributor the VAT on the entire price to the retailer, but remitting only the amount related to the distribution mark-up to the government. The last VAT amount is paid by the eventual retail customer who cannot recover any of the previously paid VAT. For a VAT and sales tax of identical rates, the total tax paid is the same, but it is paid at differing points in the process.\n\nVAT is usually administrated by requiring the company to complete a VAT return, giving details of VAT it has been charged (referred to as input tax) and VAT it has charged to others (referred to as output tax). The difference between output tax and input tax is payable to the Local Tax Authority.\n\nMany tax authorities have introduced automated VAT which has increased [[accountability]] and [[auditability]], by utilizing computer-systems, thereby also enabling anti-cybercrime offices as well.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n====Sales====\n{{Main|Sales tax}}\nSales taxes are levied when a commodity is sold to its final consumer. Retail organizations contend that such taxes discourage retail sales. The question of whether they are generally progressive or regressive is a subject of much current debate. People with higher incomes spend a lower proportion of them, so a flat-rate sales tax will tend to be regressive. It is therefore common to exempt food, utilities and other necessities from sales taxes, since poor people spend a higher proportion of their incomes on these commodities, so such exemptions make the tax more progressive. This is the classic \"You pay for what you spend\" tax, as only those who spend money on non-exempt (i.e. luxury) items pay the tax.\n\nA small number of U.S. states rely entirely on sales taxes for state revenue, as those states do not levy a state income tax. Such states tend to have a moderate to large amount of tourism or inter-state travel that occurs within their borders, allowing the state to benefit from taxes from people the state would otherwise not tax. In this way, the state is able to reduce the tax burden on its citizens. The U.S. states that do not levy a state income tax are Alaska, Tennessee, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas,<ref>Although Texas has no individual income tax, the state does impose a [[franchise tax]]\u2014soon to be replaced by a margin tax\u2014on business activity that, while not denominated as an income tax, is in substance a kind of income tax.</ref> Washington state, and Wyoming. Additionally, New Hampshire and Tennessee levy state income taxes only on [[Dividend tax|dividends]] and interest income. Of the above states, only Alaska and New Hampshire do not levy a state sales tax. Additional information can be obtained at the [http://www.taxadmin.org/ Federation of Tax Administrators] website.\n\nIn the United States, there is a growing movement<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13110436 |title=Economist.com |work=Economist|date=12 February 2009 |accessdate=27 March 2009}}</ref> for the replacement of all federal payroll and income taxes (both corporate and personal) with a national retail sales tax and monthly tax rebate to households of citizens and legal resident aliens. The tax proposal is named [[FairTax]]. In Canada, the federal sales tax is called the Goods and Services tax (GST) and now stands at 5%. The provinces of British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Prince Edward Island also have a provincial sales tax [PST]. The provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland & Labrador, and Ontario have harmonized their provincial sales taxes with the GST\u2014Harmonized Sales Tax [HST], and thus is a full VAT. The province of Quebec collects the Quebec Sales Tax [QST] which is based on the GST with certain differences. Most businesses can claim back the GST, HST and QST they pay, and so effectively it is the final consumer who pays the tax.\n\n====Excises====\n{{Main|Excise}}\nAn excise duty is an [[indirect tax]] imposed upon goods during the process of their manufacture, production or distribution, and is usually proportionate to their quantity or value. Excise duties were first introduced into England in the year 1643, as part of a scheme of revenue and taxation devised by parliamentarian [[John Pym]] and approved by the [[Long Parliament]]. These duties consisted of charges on beer, ale, cider, cherry wine and tobacco, to which list were afterwards added paper, soap, candles, malt, hops, and sweets. The basic principle of excise duties was that they were taxes on the production, manufacture or distribution of articles which could not be taxed through the [[customs house]], and revenue derived from that source is called excise revenue proper. The fundamental conception of the term is that of a tax on articles produced or manufactured in a country. In the taxation of such articles of luxury as spirits, beer, tobacco, and cigars, it has been the practice to place a certain duty on the importation of these articles (a [[tariff|customs duty]]).<ref name=Quick>{{cite book |last1=Quick |first1=John |last2=Garran |first2=Robert |title=The Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth |date=1 January 1901 |publisher=Angus & Robertson |location=Australia |page=837 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VR-CAAAAIAAJ }}</ref>\n\nExcises (or exemptions from them) are also used to modify consumption patterns of a certain area ([[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]]). For example, a high excise is used to discourage [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] consumption, relative to other goods. This may be combined with [[Hypothecated tax|hypothecation]] if the proceeds are then used to pay for the costs of treating illness caused by alcohol abuse. Similar taxes may exist on [[tobacco]], [[pornography]], etc., and they may be collectively referred to as \"[[sin tax]]es\". A [[carbon tax]] is a tax on the consumption of carbon-based non-renewable fuels, such as petrol, diesel-fuel, jet fuels, and natural gas. The object is to reduce the release of carbon into the atmosphere. In the United Kingdom, [[vehicle excise duty]] is an annual tax on vehicle ownership.\n\n===Tariff===\n{{Main|Tariff}}\nAn import or export tariff (also called customs duty or impost) is a charge for the movement of goods through a political border. Tariffs discourage [[trade]], and they may be used by governments to protect domestic industries. A proportion of tariff revenues is often hypothecated to pay government to maintain a navy or border police. The classic ways of cheating a tariff are [[smuggling]] or declaring a false value of goods. Tax, tariff and trade rules in modern times are usually set together because of their common impact on [[industrial policy]], [[investment policy]], and [[agricultural policy]]. A [[trade bloc]] is a group of allied countries agreeing to minimize or eliminate tariffs against trade with each other, and possibly to impose protective tariffs on imports from outside the bloc. A [[customs union]] has a [[common external tariff]], and the participating countries share the revenues from tariffs on goods entering the customs union.\n\nIn some societies, tariffs also could be imposed by local authorities on the movement of goods between regions (or via specific internal gateways). A notable example is the ''[[likin (taxation)|likin]]'', which became an important revenue source for local governments in the late [[Qing Empire|Qing China]].\n\n===Other===\n\n====License fees====\nOccupational taxes or license fees may be imposed on businesses or individuals engaged in certain businesses. Many jurisdictions impose a tax on vehicles.\n\n====Poll====\n{{Main|Poll tax}}\nA poll tax, also called a ''per capita tax'', or ''capitation tax'', is a tax that levies a set amount per individual. It is an example of the concept of [[fixed tax]]. One of the earliest taxes mentioned in the [[Bible]] of a half-shekel per annum from each adult Jew (Ex. 30:11\u201316) was a form of poll tax. Poll taxes are administratively cheap because they are easy to compute and collect and difficult to cheat. Economists have considered poll taxes economically efficient because people are presumed to be in fixed supply and poll taxes therefore do not lead to economic distortions. However, poll taxes are very unpopular because poorer people pay a higher proportion of their income than richer people. In addition, the supply of people is in fact not fixed over time: on average, couples will choose to have fewer children if a poll tax is imposed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/TaxFacts/listdocs.cfm?topic2id=60 |title=Tax Facts &#124; Tax Facts Listing |publisher=Taxpolicycenter.org |accessdate=27 March 2009}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=June 2011}} The introduction of a poll tax in medieval England was the primary cause of the 1381 [[Peasants' Revolt]]. Scotland was the first to be used to test the new poll tax in 1989 with England and Wales in 1990. The change from a progressive local taxation based on property values to a single-rate form of taxation regardless of ability to pay (the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Community Charge]], but more popularly referred to as the Poll Tax), led to widespread refusal to pay and to incidents of civil unrest, known colloquially as the '[[Poll Tax Riots]]'.\n\n====Other====\nSome types of taxes have been proposed but not actually adopted in any major jurisdiction. These include:\n* [[Bank tax]]\n* [[Financial transaction tax]]es including currency transaction taxes\n\n===Descriptive labels===\n\n====Ad valorem and per unit====\n{{Main|Ad valorem tax|Per unit tax}}\nAn ''ad valorem'' tax is one where the tax base is the value of a good, service, or property. Sales taxes, tariffs, property taxes, inheritance taxes, and value added taxes are different types of ad valorem tax. An ad valorem tax is typically imposed at the time of a transaction (sales tax or value added tax (VAT)) but it may be imposed on an annual basis (property tax) or in connection with another significant event (inheritance tax or tariffs).\n\nIn contrast to ad valorem taxation is a ''per unit'' tax, where the tax base is the quantity of something, regardless of its price. An [[excise tax]] is an example.\n\n====Consumption====\n{{Main|Consumption tax}}\nConsumption tax refers to any tax on non-investment spending, and can be implemented by means of a sales tax, consumer value added tax, or by modifying an income tax to allow for unlimited deductions for investment or savings.\n\n====Environmental====\n{{See also|Ecotax|Gas Guzzler Tax|Polluter pays principle|Pigovian tax}}\nThis includes [[natural resources consumption tax]], greenhouse gas tax ([[Carbon tax]]), \"sulfuric tax\", and others. The stated purpose is to reduce the environmental impact by [[Effect of taxes and subsidies on price|repricing]]. Economists describe environmental impacts as negative [[externalities]]. As early as 1920, [[Pigovian tax|Arthur Pigou]] suggested a tax to deal with externalities (see also the section on [[#Increased economic welfare|Increased economic welfare]] below). The proper implementation of environmental taxes has been the subject of a long lasting debate.\n\n====Proportional, progressive, regressive, and lump-sum====\nAn important feature of tax systems is the percentage of the tax burden as it relates to income or consumption. The terms progressive, regressive, and proportional are used to describe the way the rate progresses from low to high, from high to low, or proportionally. The terms describe a distribution effect, which can be applied to any type of tax system (income or consumption) that meets the definition.\n* A [[progressive tax]] is a tax imposed so that the [[effective tax rate]] increases as the amount to which the rate is applied increases.\n* The opposite of a progressive tax is a [[regressive tax]], where the effective tax rate decreases as the amount to which the rate is applied increases. This effect is commonly produced where means testing is used to withdraw tax allowances or state benefits.\n* In between is a [[proportional tax]], where the effective tax rate is fixed, while the amount to which the rate is applied increases.\n* A lump-sum tax is a tax that is a fixed amount, no matter the change in circumstance of the taxed entity. This in actuality is a regressive tax as those with lower income must use higher percentage of their income than those with higher income and therefore the effect of the tax reduces as a function of income.\n\nThe terms can also be used to apply meaning to the taxation of select consumption, such as a tax on luxury goods and the exemption of basic necessities may be described as having progressive effects as it increases a tax burden on high end consumption and decreases a tax burden on low end consumption.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/app/understandingTaxes/jsp/whys/lp/IWT5L1lp.jsp |title=Internal Revenue Service |publisher=webcache.googleusercontent.com |accessdate=27 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816190910/https://www.irs.gov/app/understandingTaxes/jsp/whys/lp/IWT5L1lp.jsp |archivedate=16 August 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9370763/luxury-tax |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707094214/http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9370763/luxury-tax |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 July 2012 |title=luxury tax&nbsp;\u2014 Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Concise.britannica.com |accessdate=27 March 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |jstor=1813222 |title=Clothing Exemptions and Sales Tax Regressivity |first=Jeffrey M. |last=Schaefer |date=1 January 1969 |journal=The American Economic Review |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=596\u201399}}</ref>\n\n====Direct and indirect====\n{{Main|Direct tax|Indirect tax}}\nTaxes are sometimes referred to as \"direct taxes\" or \"indirect taxes\". The meaning of these terms can vary in different contexts, which can sometimes lead to confusion. An economic definition, by Atkinson, states that \"...direct taxes may be adjusted to the individual characteristics of the taxpayer, whereas indirect taxes are levied on transactions irrespective of the circumstances of buyer or seller.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Atkinson |first1=A. B. |year=1977 |title=Optimal Taxation and the Direct Versus Indirect Tax Controversy |journal=Can. J. Econ. |volume=590 |page=592}}</ref> According to this definition, for example, income tax is \"direct\", and sales tax is \"indirect\". \n \nIn law, the terms may have different meanings. In U.S. constitutional law, for instance, direct taxes refer to [[Tax per head|poll taxes]] and [[property tax]]es, which are based on simple existence or ownership. Indirect taxes are imposed on events, rights, privileges, and activities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.investorguide.com/igu-article-1138-tax-basics-what-is-difference-between-direct-and-indirect-tax.html |title=What is Difference Between Direct and Indirect Tax? |publisher=Investor Guide |accessdate=28 October 2011}}</ref> Thus, a tax on the sale of property would be considered an indirect tax, whereas the tax on simply owning the property itself would be a direct tax.\n\n===Fees and effective===\nGovernments may charge user [[fee]]s, tolls, or other types of assessments in exchange of particular goods, services, or use of property. These are generally not considered taxes, as long as they are levied as payment for a direct benefit to the individual paying.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncsu.edu/project/calscommblogs/economic/archives/2007/05/the_difference.html |title=Taxes versus fees |publisher=Ncsu.edu |date=2 May 2007 |accessdate=22 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008032841/http://www.ncsu.edu/project/calscommblogs/economic/archives/2007/05/the_difference.html |archivedate=8 October 2012  }}</ref> Such fees include:\n* Tolls: a fee charged to travel via a [[Toll road|road]], [[Toll bridge|bridge]], [[Toll tunnel|tunnel]], [[canal]], [[waterway]] or other transportation facilities. Historically tolls have been used to pay for public bridge, road and tunnel projects. They have also been used in privately constructed transport links. The toll is likely to be a fixed charge, possibly graduated for vehicle type, or for distance on long routes.\n* User fees, such as those charged for use of parks or other government owned facilities.\n* Ruling fees charged by governmental agencies to make determinations in particular situations.\n\nSome scholars refer to certain economic effects as taxes, though they are not levies imposed by governments. These include:\n* [[Inflation tax]]: the economic disadvantage suffered by holders of [[cash and cash equivalents]] in one denomination of [[currency]] due to the effects of [[expansionary monetary policy]]<ref>Some economists{{who|date=September 2010}} hold that the inflation tax affects the lower and middle classes more than the rich, as they hold a larger fraction of their income in cash, they are much less likely to receive the newly created monies before the market has adjusted with inflated prices, and more often have fixed incomes, [[wages]] or [[pensions]]. Some argue that inflation is a [[regressive tax|regressive]] [[consumption tax]]. Also see Andr\u00e9s Erosa and Gustavo Ventura, \"[http://www.ssc.uwo.ca/economics/econref/workingpapers/researchreports/wp2000/wp2000_1.pdf On inflation as a regressive consumption tax] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910064531/http://www.ssc.uwo.ca/economics/econref/workingpapers/researchreports/wp2000/wp2000_1.pdf |date=10 September 2008 }}\". Some{{who|date=June 2011}} claim there are systemic effects of an expansionary monetary policy, which are also definitively taxing, imposing a financial charge on some as a result of the policy. Because the effects of monetary expansion or [[counterfeiting]] are never uniform over an entire economy, the policy influences capital transfers in the market, creating [[economic bubbles]] where the new monies are first introduced. Economic bubbles increase market instability, and therefore increase investment risk, creating the conditions common to a [[recession]]. This particular tax can be understood to be levied on future generations that would have benefited from economic growth, and it has a 100% transfer cost (so long as people are not acting against their interests, increased uncertainty benefits no-one). One example of a strong supporter of this tax was the former [[Federal Reserve]] chair [[Beardsley Ruml]].</ref>\n* [[Financial repression]]: Government policies such as interest-rate caps on government debt, financial regulations such as reserve requirements and capital controls, and barriers to entry in markets where the government owns or controls businesses.<ref>\nSee for example Reinhart, Carmen M. and Rogoff, Kenneth S., ''This Time is Different''.

The other four-fifths you may keep as seed for the fields and as food for yourselves and your households and your children\". [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] was telling the people of [[Egypt]] how to divide their crop, providing a portion to the Pharaoh. A share (20%) of the crop was the tax (in this case, a special rather than an ordinary tax, as it was gathered against an expected famine) The stock made by was returned and equally shared with the people of Egypt and traded with the surrounding nations thus saving and elevating Egypt.  .<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+41%3A33-36&version=NIV |title=The Bible}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], a regulated and sustainable tax system was introduced by [[Darius I the Great]] in 500 BC;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.1902encyclopedia.com/D/DAR/darius-i-the-great.html |title=Darius I (Darius the Great), King of Persia (from 521 BC) |publisher=1902encyclopedia.com |accessdate=22 January 2013}}</ref> the [[Persia]]n system of taxation was tailored to each [[Satrapy]] (the area ruled by a Satrap or provincial governor). At differing times, there were between 20 and 30 Satrapies in the Empire and each was assessed according to its supposed productivity. It was the responsibility of the Satrap to collect the due amount and to send it to the treasury, after deducting his expenses (the expenses and the power of deciding precisely how and from whom to raise the money in the province, offer maximum opportunity for rich pickings). The quantities demanded from the various provinces gave a vivid picture of their economic potential. For instance, [[Babylon]] was assessed for the highest amount and for a startling mixture of commodities; 1,000 [[Talent (measurement)|silver talents]] and four months supply of food for the army. [[India]], a province fabled for its gold, was to supply gold dust equal in value to the very large amount of 4,680 silver talents. Egypt was known for the wealth of its crops; it was to be the granary of the Persian Empire (and, later, of the [[Roman Empire]]) and was required to provide 120,000 measures of grain in addition to 700 talents of silver.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=aa65 |title=History of Iran (Persia) |publisher=Historyworld.net |accessdate=22 January 2013}}</ref> This tax was exclusively levied on Satrapies based on their lands, productive capacity and tribute levels.<ref>''The Theocratic Ideology of the Chronicler'' \u2013 by Jonathan E.

Government expenditures and revenue in France during the 17th century went from about 24.30 million ''[[livres]]'' in 1600\u201310 to about 126.86 million ''livres'' in 1650\u201359 to about 117.99 million ''livres'' in 1700\u201310 when [[government debt]] had reached 1.6 billion ''livres''. In 1780\u201389, it reached 421.50 million ''livres''.<ref>''Hoffman, Phillipe and Kathryn Norberg (1994), Fiscal Crises, Liberty, and Representative Government, 1450\u20131789, p. 238.</ref> Taxation as a percentage of production of final goods may have reached 15\u201320% during the 17th century in places such as [[France]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Scandinavia]]. During the war-filled years of the eighteenth and early nineteenth century, tax rates in Europe increased dramatically as war became more expensive and governments became more centralized and adept at gathering taxes. This increase was greatest in England, [[Peter Mathias]] and Patrick O'Brien found that the tax burden increased by 85% over this period. Another study confirmed this number, finding that per capita tax revenues had grown almost sixfold over the eighteenth century, but that steady economic growth had made the real burden on each individual only double over this period before the industrial revolution. [[Effective tax rate]]s were higher in Britain than France the years before the [[French Revolution]], twice in per capita income comparison, but they were mostly placed on international trade. In France, taxes were lower but the burden was mainly on landowners, individuals, and internal trade and thus created far more resentment.<ref>''Hoffman, Phillipe and Kathryn Norberg (1994), Fiscal Crises, Liberty, and Representative Government, 1450\u20131789, p. 300 .</ref>\n\nTaxation as a percentage of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] 2016 was 45.9% in [[Denmark]], 45.3% in France, 33.2% in the [[United Kingdom]], 26% in the [[United States]], and among all [[OECD]] members an average of 34.3%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/tax/revenue-statistics-2522770x.htm |title=OECD Revenue Statistics: 1965-2016 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.forbes.com/global/2004/0524/074chart2.html Tax/Spending Burden], Forbes magazine, ''05-24-04''</ref>\n\n===Forms===\nIn monetary economies prior to fiat banking, a critical form of taxation was [[seigniorage]], the tax on the creation of money.\n\nOther obsolete forms of taxation include:\n* [[Scutage]], which is paid in lieu of military service; strictly speaking, it is a commutation of a non-tax obligation rather than a tax as such but functioning as a tax in practice.\n* [[Tallage]], a tax on feudal dependents.\n* [[Tithe]], a tax-like payment (one tenth of one's earnings or agricultural produce), paid to the Church (and thus too specific to be a tax in strict technical terms).

For this data, the [[variance]] of GDP per capita with purchasing power parity (PPP) is explained in 32% by tax revenue.]]\n\nIn economic terms, taxation transfers [[wealth]] from households or businesses to the government of a nation. Adam Smith writes in ''The Wealth of Nations'' that\n\n:\"\u2026the economic incomes of private people are of three main types: rent, profit and wages. Ordinary taxpayers will ultimately pay their taxes from at least one of these revenue sources. The government may intend that a particular tax should fall exclusively on rent, profit, or wages \u2013 and that another tax should fall on all three private income sources jointly. However, many taxes will inevitably fall on resources and persons very different from those intended \u2026 Good taxes meet four major criteria. They are (1) proportionate to incomes or abilities to pay (2) certain rather than arbitrary (3) payable at times and in ways convenient to the taxpayers and (4) cheap to administer and collect.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Adam|title=The Wealth of Nations: A Translation into Modern English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hj2gCQAAQBAJ|year=2015|publisher=Industrial Systems Research|isbn=978-0-906321-70-6|page=429}}</ref>\n\nThe side-effects of taxation (such as economic distortions) and theories about how best to tax are an important subject in [[microeconomics]]. Taxation is almost never a simple transfer of wealth. Economic theories of taxation approach the question of how to maximize [[Welfare economics|economic welfare]] through taxation.\n\nA 2019 study looking at the impact of tax cuts for different income groups, it was tax cuts for low-income groups that had the greatest positive impact on employment growth.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Zidar|first=Owen|date=30 October 2018|title=Tax Cuts for Whom?

In many countries, taxes are imposed on business (such as [[corporate tax]]es or portions of [[payroll tax]]es). However, who ultimately pays the tax (the tax \"burden\") is determined by the marketplace as taxes become [[Effect of taxes and subsidies on price|embedded]] into production costs. Economic theory suggests that the economic effect of tax does not necessarily fall at the point where it is legally levied. For instance, a tax on employment paid by employers will impact on the employee, at least in the long run. The greatest share of the tax burden tends to fall on the most inelastic factor involved\u2014the part of the transaction which is affected least by a change in price. So, for instance, a tax on wages in a town will (at least in the long run) affect property-owners in that area.\n\nDepending on how quantities supplied and demanded vary with price (the \"elasticities\" of supply and demand), a tax can be absorbed by the seller (in the form of lower pre-tax prices), or by the buyer (in the form of higher post-tax prices). If the elasticity of supply is low, more of the tax will be paid by the supplier. If the elasticity of demand is low, more will be paid by the customer; and, contrariwise for the cases where those elasticities are high. If the seller is a competitive firm, the tax burden is distributed over the [[factors of production]] depending on the elasticities thereof; this includes workers (in the form of lower wages), capital investors (in the form of loss to shareholders), landowners (in the form of lower rents), entrepreneurs (in the form of lower wages of superintendence) and customers (in the form of higher prices).\n\nTo show this relationship, suppose that the market price of a product is $1.00, and that a $0.50 tax is imposed on the product that, by law, is to be collected from the seller. If the product has an elastic demand, a greater portion of the tax will be absorbed by the seller. This is because goods with elastic demand cause a large decline in quantity demanded for a small increase in price. Therefore, in order to stabilize sales, the seller absorbs more of the additional tax burden. For example, the seller might drop the price of the product to $0.70 so that, after adding in the tax, the buyer pays a total of $1.20, or $0.20 more than he did before the $0.50 tax was imposed. In this example, the buyer has paid $0.20 of the $0.50 tax (in the form of a post-tax price) and the seller has paid the remaining $0.30 (in the form of a lower pre-tax price).<ref>''Parkin, Michael (2006), Principles of Microeconomics, p. 134.</ref>\n\n===Increased economic welfare===\n\n====Government spending====\nThe purpose of taxation is to provide for [[government spending]] without [[inflation]]. The provision of public goods such as roads and other infrastructure, schools, a [[social safety net]], health care, national defense, law enforcement, and a courts system increases the economic welfare of society if the benefit outweighs the costs involved.\n\n====Pigovian====\nThe existence of a tax can ''increase'' economic efficiency in some cases. If there is a [[negative externality]] associated with a good, meaning that it has negative effects not felt by the consumer, then a free market will trade too much of that good. By taxing the good, the government can increase overall welfare as well as raising revenue. This type of tax is called a [[Pigovian tax]], after economist [[Arthur Cecil Pigou|Arthur Pigou]].\n\nPossible Pigovian taxes include those on polluting fuels (like [[petrol]]), taxes on goods which incur public healthcare costs (such as [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]] or [[tobacco]]), and charges for existing 'free' public goods (like [[congestion charging]]) are another possibility.\n\n====Reduced inequality====\nProgressive taxation may reduce [[economic inequality]]. This effect occurs even when the tax revenue isn't [[transfer payments|redistributed]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Reduced economic welfare===\nMost taxes (see [[#Deadweight costs of taxation|below]]) have [[side effects]] that reduce [[economic welfare]], either by mandating unproductive labor (compliance costs) or by creating distortions to economic incentives ([[deadweight loss]] and [[perverse incentive]]s).{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n====Cost of compliance====\nAlthough governments must spend money on tax collection activities, some of the costs, particularly for keeping records and filling out forms, are borne by businesses and by private individuals. These are collectively called costs of compliance. More complex tax systems tend to have higher compliance costs. This fact can be used as the basis for practical or moral arguments in favor of tax simplification (such as the [[FairTax]] or [[OneTax]], and some [[flat tax]] proposals).\n\n====Deadweight costs====\n[[File:Tax deadweight.gif|thumb|upright=1.35|Diagram illustrating deadweight costs of taxes]]\n\nIn the absence of negative [[Externality|externalities]], the introduction of taxes into a market reduces [[economic efficiency]] by causing [[deadweight loss]]. In a competitive market the [[price]] of a particular [[Good (economics)|economic good]] adjusts to ensure that all trades which benefit both the buyer and the seller of a good occur. The introduction of a tax causes the price received by the seller to be less than the cost to the buyer by the amount of the tax. This causes fewer transactions to occur, which reduces [[welfare economics|economic welfare]]; the individuals or businesses involved are less well off than before the tax. The [[tax burden]] and the amount of deadweight cost is dependent on the [[elasticity (economics)|elasticity]] of supply and demand for the good taxed.\n\nMost taxes\u2014including [[income tax]] and [[sales tax]]\u2014can have significant deadweight costs. The only way to avoid deadweight costs in an economy that is generally competitive is to refrain from taxes that change [[economic incentive]]s. Such taxes include the [[land value tax]],<ref>{{cite book|author1=William J. McCluskey|author2=Ri\u00ebl C. D. Franzsen|title=Land Value Taxation: An Applied Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jkogP2U4k0AC&pg=PA73|year=2005|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-0-7546-1490-6|page=73}}</ref> where the tax is on a good in completely inelastic supply, a [[lump sum tax]] such as a [[Tax per head|poll tax]] (head tax) which is paid by all adults regardless of their choices. Arguably a [[windfall profits tax]] which is entirely unanticipated can also fall into this category.\n\nDeadweight loss does not account for the effect taxes have in leveling the business playing field. Businesses that have more money are better suited to fend off competition. It is common that an industry with a small amount of very large corporations has a very high barrier of entry for new entrants coming into the marketplace. This is due to the fact that the larger the corporation, the better its position to negotiate with suppliers. Also, larger companies may be able to operate at low or even negative profits for extended periods of time, thus pushing out competition. More progressive taxation of profits, however, would reduce such barriers for new entrants, thereby increasing competition and ultimately benefiting consumers.<ref>{{Cite journal |first=Reuven S. |last=Avi-Yonah |date=April 2002 |title=Why Tax the Rich?

The more details of [[tax policy]] there are, the more opportunities for legal [[tax avoidance]] and illegal [[tax evasion]]. These not only result in lost revenue, but involve additional costs: for instance, payments made for tax advice are essentially deadweight costs because they add no wealth to the economy. [[Perverse incentive]]s also occur because of non-taxable 'hidden' transactions; for instance, a sale from one company to another might be liable for [[sales tax]], but if the same goods were shipped from one branch of a corporation to another, no tax would be payable.\n\nTo address these issues, economists often suggest simple and transparent tax structures which avoid providing loopholes. Sales tax, for instance, can be replaced with a [[value added tax]] which disregards intermediate transactions.\n\n==In developing countries==\nFollowing Nicolas Kaldor's research, public finance in developing countries is strongly tied to state capacity and financial development. As state capacity develops, states not only increase the level of taxation but also the pattern of taxation. With the increase of larger tax bases and the diminish of the importance of trading tax, while income tax gains more importance.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stern |first1=Nicolas |last2=Burgess |first2=Robin |title=Taxation and Development |journal=Journal of Economic Literature}}</ref>\nAccording to Tilly's argument, state capacity evolves as response to the emergence of war. War is an incentive for states to raise tax and strengthen states capacity. Historically, many taxation breakthroughs took place during the wartime. The introduction of income tax in Britain was due to the Napoleonic War in 1798. US first introduce income tax during Civil War.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Besley |first1=Timothy |last2=Persson |first2=Torsten |title=The Origins of State Capacity: Property Rights, Taxation, and Politics}}</ref>\nTaxation is constrained by the fiscal and legal capacities of a country.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Besley |first1=Timothy |last2=Persson |first2=Trosten |title=The Origins of State Capacity: Property Rights, Taxation, and Politics}}</ref> Fiscal and legal capacities also complement each other. A well-designed tax system can minimize efficiency loss and boost economic growth. With better compliance and better support to financial institutions and individual property, the government will be able to collect more tax. Although wealthier countries have higher tax revenue, economic growth does not always translate to higher tax revenue. For example, in India, increases in exemptions leads to the stagnation of income tax revenue at around 0.5% of GDP since 1986.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Piketty |first1=Thomas |last2=Qian |first2=Nancy |title=Income Inequality and Progressive Income Taxation in China and India, 1986\u20132015}}</ref>\n\nResearchers for [[EPS PEAKS]] <ref name=\"Economics Topic Guide Taxation and Revenue\">{{cite web |url=http://partnerplatform.org/?c158bbx3 |title=Economics Topic Guide Taxation and Revenue |author=Hazel Granger |publisher=EPS PEAKS |year=2013}}</ref> stated that the core purpose of taxation is revenue mobilisation, providing resources for National Budgets, and forming an important part of macroeconomic management. They said [[economic theory]] has focused on the need to 'optimise' the system through balancing efficiency and equity, understanding the impacts on production, and consumption as well as distribution, [[Redistribution (economics)|redistribution]], and [[welfare]].\n\nThey state that taxes and tax reliefs have also been used as a tool for behavioural change, to influence [[investment decisions]], [[labour supply]], [[consumption patterns]], and positive and negative economic spill-overs (externalities), and ultimately, the promotion of economic growth and development. The tax system and its administration also play an important role in state-building and governance, as a principal form of 'social contract' between the state and citizens who can, as taxpayers, exert accountability on the state as a consequence.\n\nThe researchers wrote that domestic revenue forms an important part of a developing country's public financing as it is more stable and predictable than [[Overseas Development Assistance]] and necessary for a country to be self-sufficient. They found that domestic revenue flows are, on average, already much larger than ODA, with aid worth less than 10% of collected taxes in Africa as a whole.\n\nHowever, in a quarter of African countries [[Overseas Development Assistance]] does exceed tax collection,<ref>Africa Economic Outlook 2010, Part 2: Public Resource Mobilisation and Aid in Africa, AfDB/OECD (2010)</ref> with these more likely to be non-resource-rich countries. This suggests countries making most progress replacing aid with tax revenue tend to be those benefiting disproportionately from rising prices of energy and commodities.\n\nThe author<ref name=\"Economics Topic Guide Taxation and Revenue\" /> found tax revenue as a percentage of GDP varying greatly around a global average of 19%.<ref>According to IMF data for 2010, from Revenue Data for IMF Member Countries, as of 2011, (unpublished)</ref> This data also indicates countries with higher GDP tend to have higher tax to GDP ratios, demonstrating that higher income is associated with more than proportionately higher tax revenue. On average, high-income countries have tax revenue as a percentage of GDP of around 22%, compared to 18% in middle-income countries and 14% in low-income countries.\n\nIn high-income countries, the highest tax-to-GDP ratio is in [[Denmark]] at 47% and the lowest is in Kuwait at 0.8%, reflecting low taxes from strong oil revenues. Long-term average performance of tax revenue as a share of GDP in low-income countries has been largely stagnant, although most have shown some improvement in more recent years. On average, resource-rich countries have made the most progress, rising from 10% in the mid-1990s to around 17% in 2008. Non resource rich countries made some progress, with average tax revenues increasing from 10% to 15% over the same period.<ref>IMF FAD (2011), Revenue Mobilization in Developing Countries</ref>\n\nMany low-income countries have a tax-to-GDP ratio of less than 15% which could be due to low tax potential, such as a limited taxable economic activity, or low tax effort due to policy choice, non-compliance, or administrative constraints.\n\nSome low-income countries have relatively high tax-to- GDP ratios due to resource tax revenues (e.g. [[Angola]]) or relatively efficient tax administration (e.g. [[Kenya]], [[Brazil]]) whereas some middle-income countries have lower tax-to-GDP ratios (e.g. [[Malaysia]]) which reflect a more tax-friendly policy choice.\n\nWhile overall tax revenues have remained broadly constant, the global trend shows trade taxes have been declining as a proportion of total revenues(IMF, 2011), with the share of revenue shifting away from border trade taxes towards domestically levied [[sales taxes]] on goods and services. Low-income countries tend to have a higher dependence on trade taxes, and a smaller proportion of income and consumption taxes, when compared to high income countries.<ref>IMF WP/05/112, Tax Revenue and (or?)

The 'easiest' countries in which to pay taxes are located in the Middle East with the [[UAE]] ranking first, followed by [[Qatar]] and [[Saudi Arabia]], most likely reflecting low tax regimes in those countries. Countries in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] are among the 'hardest' to pay with the [[Central African Republic]], [[Republic of Congo]], [[Guinea]] and [[Chad]] in the bottom 5, reflecting higher total tax rates and a greater administrative burden to comply.\n\n===Key facts===\nThe below facts were compiled by EPS PEAKS researchers:<ref name=\"Economics Topic Guide Taxation and Revenue\" />\n* [[Trade liberalisation]] has led to a decline in trade taxes as a share of total revenues and GDP.<ref name=\"Economics Topic Guide Taxation and Revenue\" /><ref name=\"Revenue Mobilisation in Sub Saharan Africa Challenges from Globalisation I Trade Reform\">{{cite journal |last1=Keen |last2=Mansour |year=2010 |title=Revenue Mobilisation in Sub-Saharan Africa: Challenges from Globalisation I \u2013 Trade Reform |journal=Development Policy Review |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=553\u201371 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-7679.2010.00498.x}}</ref>\n* Resource-rich countries tend to collect more revenue as a share of GDP, but this is more volatile.

It is used to illustrate the concept of taxable income elasticity (that [[taxable income]] will change in response to changes in the rate of taxation). The curve is constructed by [[thought experiment]]. First, the amount of tax revenue raised at the extreme tax rates of 0% and 100% is considered. It is clear that a 0% tax rate raises no revenue, but the Laffer curve hypothesis is that a 100% tax rate will also generate no revenue because at such a rate there is no longer any incentive for a rational taxpayer to earn any income, thus the revenue raised will be 100% of nothing. If both a 0% rate and 100% rate of taxation generate no revenue, it follows from the [[extreme value theorem]] that there must exist at least one rate in between where tax revenue would be a maximum. The Laffer curve is typically represented as a graph which starts at 0% tax, zero revenue, rises to a maximum rate of revenue raised at an intermediate rate of taxation and then falls again to zero revenue at a 100% tax rate.\n\nOne potential result of the Laffer curve is that increasing tax rates beyond a certain point will become counterproductive for raising further tax revenue. A hypothetical Laffer curve for any given economy can only be estimated and such estimates are sometimes controversial. [[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]] reports that estimates of revenue-maximizing tax rates have varied widely, with a mid-range of around 70%.<ref>{{cite book |title=Laffer curve |first=Don |last=Fullerton |work=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, Second Edition |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2008 |quote=The mid-range for this elasticity is around 0.4, with a revenue peak around 70 per cent. |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_L000015 |accessdate=5 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Optimal===\n{{Main|Optimal tax}}\n\nMost governments take revenue which exceeds that which can be provided by non-distortionary taxes or through taxes which give a double dividend. Optimal taxation theory is the branch of economics that considers how taxes can be structured to give the least deadweight costs, or to give the best outcomes in terms of [[social welfare]]. The [[Ramsey problem]] deals with minimizing deadweight costs. Because deadweight costs are related to the [[elasticity (economics)|elasticity]] of supply and demand for a good, it follows that putting the highest tax rates on the goods for which there is most inelastic supply and demand will result in the least overall deadweight costs. Some economists sought to integrate optimal tax theory with the [[social welfare function]], which is the economic expression of the idea that equality is valuable to a greater or lesser extent. If individuals experience [[diminishing returns]] from income, then the optimum distribution of income for society involves a progressive income tax. [[James Mirrlees|Mirrlees optimal income tax]] is a detailed theoretical model of the optimum progressive income tax along these lines. Over the last years the validity of the theory of optimal taxation was discussed by many political economists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wordsofliberty.net |title=Libertarian & Conservative News |publisher=Words of Liberty |accessdate=22 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122183637/http://wordsofliberty.net/ |archivedate=22 January 2013  }}</ref>\n\n===Rates===\n{{Main|Tax rate}}\nTaxes are most often levied as a percentage, called the ''tax rate''. An important distinction when talking about tax rates is to distinguish between the [[Tax rate#Marginal|marginal rate]] and the [[Tax rate#Effective|effective tax rate]]. The effective rate is the total tax paid divided by the total amount the tax is paid on, while the marginal rate is the rate paid on the next dollar of income earned. For example, if income is taxed on a formula of 5% from $0 up to $50,000, 10% from $50,000 to $100,000, and 15% over $100,000, a [[wikt:taxpayer|taxpayer]] with income of $175,000 would pay a total of $18,750 in taxes.\n\n:Tax calculation\n::(0.05*50,000)&nbsp;+ (0.10*50,000)&nbsp;+ (0.15*75,000) = 18,750\n\n:The \"effective rate\" would be 10.7%:\n::18,750/175,000 = 0.107\n\n:The \"marginal rate\" would be 15%.\n\n==See also==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n* [[Advance tax ruling]]\n* [[Excess burden of taxation]]\n* [[Fiscal capacity]]\n* [[Fiscal incidence]]\n* [[Government budget balance]]\n* [[International taxation]]\n* [[List of taxes]]\n* [[Price ceiling]]\n{{Col-2}}\n* [[Price floor]]\n* [[Revolutionary tax]]\n* [[Tax competition]]\n* [[Tax exporting]]\n* [[Tax haven]]\n* [[Taxpayer receipt]]\n* [[Tax resistance]]\n* [[Tax shelter]]\n{{Col-end}}\n\n===By country or region===\n* [[List of countries by tax rates]]\n* [[List of countries by tax revenue as percentage of GDP]]\n* [[:Category:Taxation by country]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Library resources box\n| by=no\n| onlinebooks=no\n| others=no\n| about=yes\n| label=Tax }}\n* [http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20150216-my-taxes-go-where?ocid=global_bbccom_email_19022015_capital My taxes go where?

Taxes consist of [[direct tax|direct]] or [[indirect tax]]es and may be paid in money or as its labour equivalent. The first known taxation took place in Ancient Egypt around 3000\u20132800 BC.\n\nMost countries have a tax system in place to pay for public, common or agreed national needs and government functions. Some levy a [[flat tax|flat percentage rate]] of taxation on personal annual income, but most [[progressive tax|scale taxes]] based on annual income amounts. Most countries charge a tax on an individual's [[income tax|income]] as well as on [[corporate tax|corporate income]]. Countries or subunits often also impose [[wealth tax]]es, [[inheritance tax]]es, [[Estate tax in the United States|estate taxes]], [[gift tax]]es, [[property tax]]es, [[sales tax]]es, [[payroll tax]]es or [[tariff]]s.\n\nIn economic terms, taxation transfers wealth from households or businesses to the government. This has effects which can both increase and reduce economic growth and economic welfare. Consequently, taxation is a highly debated topic.\n{{TOC limit}}\n==Overview==\n[[File:Pieter Brueghel the Younger, 'Paying the Tax (The Tax Collector)' oil on panel, 1620-1640. USC Fisher Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]], ''The tax collector's office'', 1640]]\n\nThe legal definition, and the economic definition of taxes differ in some ways such as economists do not regard many transfers to governments as taxes. For example, some transfers to the public sector are comparable to prices. Examples include, tuition at public universities, and fees for utilities provided by local governments. Governments also obtain resources by \"creating\" money and coins (for example, by printing bills and by minting coins), through voluntary gifts (for example, contributions to public universities and museums), by imposing penalties (such as traffic fines), by borrowing, and also by confiscating wealth. From the view of economists, a tax is a non-penal, yet compulsory transfer of resources from the private to the [[public sector]], levied on a basis of predetermined criteria and without reference to specific benefit received.\n\nIn modern taxation systems, governments levy taxes in money; but [[In kind|in-kind]] and ''[[corv\u00e9e]]'' taxation are characteristic of traditional or pre-[[capitalism|capitalist]] states and their functional equivalents. The method of taxation and the government expenditure of taxes raised is often highly debated in [[politics]] and [[economics]]. Tax collection is performed by a government agency such as the [[Ghana Revenue Authority]], [[Canada Revenue Agency]], the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) in the [[United States]], [[Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs]] (HMRC) in the [[United Kingdom]] or [[Federal Tax Service (Russia)|Federal Tax Service]] in Russia. When taxes are not fully paid, the state may impose civil penalties (such as [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] or [[Asset forfeiture|forfeiture]]) or criminal penalties (such as [[incarceration]]) on the non-paying entity or individual.<ref>See for example {{usc|26|7203}} in the case of U.S. Federal taxes.</ref>\n\n==Purposes & effects==\n\nThe levying of taxes aims to raise revenue to fund [[government|governing]] or to alter prices in order to affect demand. States and their functional equivalents throughout history have used money provided by taxation to carry out many functions. Some of these include expenditures on economic infrastructure ([[road]]s, public transportation, sanitation, legal systems, public safety, education, [[health care system|health-care systems]]), military, scientific research, culture and the arts, [[public works]], distribution, data collection and dissemination, public insurance, and the operation of government itself. A government's ability to raise taxes is called its [[fiscal capacity]].\n\nWhen expenditures exceed tax revenue, a government accumulates debt.  A portion of taxes may be used to service past debts. Governments also use taxes to fund [[social welfare|welfare]] and [[public services]]. These services can include [[education system]]s, [[pension]]s for the elderly, [[unemployment benefits]], and [[public transportation]]. [[Electric utility|Energy]], [[water management|water]] and [[waste management]] systems are also common [[Public utility|public utilities]].\n\nAccording to the proponents of the [[Chartalism|chartalist theory]] of money creation, taxes are not needed for government revenue, as long as the government in question is able to issue [[fiat money]]. According to this view, the purpose of taxation is to maintain the stability of the currency, express public policy regarding the distribution of wealth, subsidizing certain industries or population groups or isolating the costs of certain benefits, such as highways or social security.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Beardsley|first1=Ruml|title=Taxes for Revenue are Obsolete |journal=American Affairs|volume = VIII|issue = 1|url=http://www.constitution.org/tax/us-ic/cmt/ruml_obsolete.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314025345/http://www.constitution.org/tax/us-ic/cmt/ruml_obsolete.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nEffects can be divided in two fundamental categories:\n\n* Taxes cause an [[Income Effect|income effect]] because they reduce [[purchasing power]] to taxpayers.\n* Taxes cause a [[substitution effect]] when taxation causes a substitution between taxed goods and untaxed goods.\n\n[[File:Substitution effect.png|thumb|265.99x265.99px|Substitution effect and income effect with a taxation on y good.]]\nIf we consider, for instance, two [[normal good]]s, ''x'' and ''y,'' whose prices are respectively ''p<sub>x</sub>'' and ''p<sub>y</sub>'' and an individual budget constraint given by the equation ''xp<sub>x</sub>'' + ''yp<sub>y</sub>'' = Y, where Y is the income, the slope of the budget constraint, in a graph where is represented good ''x'' on the vertical axis and good ''y'' on the horizontal axes, is equal to -''p<sub>y</sub>''/''p<sub>x</sub>'' . The initial equilibrium is in the point (C), in which [[budget constraint]] and [[indifference curve]] are [[tangent]], introducing an ''[[ad valorem tax]]'' on the ''y'' good (budget constraint: ''p<sub>x</sub>x'' + ''p<sub>y</sub>''(1 + ''\u03c4'')''y ='' Y'')'' , the budget constraint's slope becomes equal to -''p<sub>y</sub>''(1 + \u03c4)/''p<sub>x</sub>''. The new equilibrium is now in the tangent point (A) with a lower indifferent curve.\n\nAs can be noticed the tax's introduction causes two consequences:\n\n# It changes the consumers' real income (less purchasing power)\n# It raises the relative price of ''y'' good.\n\nThe income effect shows the variation of ''y'' good quantity given by the change of real income.The substitution effect shows the variation of ''y'' good determined by relative prices' variation. This kind of taxation (that causes substitution effect) can be considered distortionary.\n[[File:Income effect.PNG|thumb|Budget's constraint shift after an introduction of a lump sum tax or a general tax on consumption or a proportional income tax.]]\nAnother example can be the Introduction of an income [[lump-sum tax]] (''xp<sub>x</sub>'' + ''yp<sub>y</sub>'' = Y - T), with a parallel shift downward of the budget constraint, can be produced a higher revenue with the same loss of consumers' utility compared with the property tax case, from another point of view, the same revenue can be produced with a lower utility sacrifice. The lower utility (with the same revenue) or the lower revenue (with the same utility) given by a distortionary tax are called excess pressure. The same result, reached with an income lump-sum tax, can be obtained with these following types of taxes (all of them cause only a budget constraint's shift without causing a substitution effect), the budget constraint's slope remains the same (-''p<sub>x</sub>''/''p<sub>y</sub>''):\n\n* A general tax on consumption: (Budget constraint: ''p<sub>x</sub>''(1 + \u03c4)''x'' + ''p<sub>y</sub>''(1 + \u03c4)''y ='' Y)\n* A proportional income tax: (Budget constraint: ''xp<sub>x</sub>'' + ''yp<sub>y</sub>'' = Y(1 - ''t''))\n\nWhen the t and \u03c4 rates are chosen respecting this equation (where t is the rate of income tax and tau is the consumption tax's rate):\n\n<math>\\frac{1}{1+\\tau}=1-t\\Rightarrow t=\\frac{\\tau}{1+\\tau}</math>\n\nthe effects of the two taxes are the same.\n\nA tax effectively changes relative prices of products. Therefore, most{{quantify|date=December 2016}} economists, especially [[neo-classical economics|neoclassical economists]], argue that taxation creates [[market distortion]] and results in economic inefficiency unless there are (positive or negative) externalities associated with the activities that are taxed that need to be internalized to reach an efficient market outcome. They have therefore sought to identify the kind of tax system that would minimize this distortion.\nRecent{{when|date=December 2016}} scholarship suggests that in the [[United States|United States of America]], the federal government effectively taxes investments in higher education more heavily than it subsidizes higher education, thereby contributing to a shortage of skilled workers and unusually high differences in pre-tax earnings between highly educated and less-educated workers.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nTaxes can even have effects on labour supply: we can consider a model in which the consumer chooses the number of hours spent working and the amount spent on consumption. Let us suppose that only one good exists and no income is saved.\n\nConsumers have a given number of hours (H) that is divided between work (L) and free time (F = H - L). The hourly wage is called ''w'' and it tells us the free time's [[opportunity cost]], i.e. the income to which the individual renounces consuming an additional hour of free time. Consumption and hours of work have a positive relationship, more hours of work mean more earnings and, assuming that workers don't save money, more earnings imply an increase in consumption (Y = C = ''w''L). Free time and consumption can be considered as two normal goods (workers have to decide between working one hour more, that would mean consuming more, or having one more hour of free time) and the budget constraint is negative inclined (Y = ''w''(H - F)). The [[indifference curve]] related to these two goods has a negative slope and free time becomes more and more important with high levels of consumption. It's because a high level of consumption means that people are already spending many hours working, so, in this situation, they need more free time than consume and it implies that they have to be paid with a higher salary to work an additional hour. A proportional income tax, changing budget constraint's slope (now Y = ''w''(1 - ''t'')(H - F)), implies both substitution and income effects. The problem now is that the two effects go in opposite ways: income effect tells us that, with an income tax, the consumer feels poorer and for this reason he wants to work more, causing an increase in labour offer. On the other hand, substitution effect tells us that free time, being a normal good, is now more convenient compared to consume and it implies a decrease in labour offer. Therefore, the total effect can be both an increase or a decrease of labour offer, depending on indifference curve's shape. \n[[File:LafferCurve.svg|thumb|The Laffer curve. In this case, the critical point is at a tax rate of 70%. Revenue increases<ref>{{Cite book|title=Elementi di scienza delle finanze|last=Artoni|first=Roberto|publisher=il Mulino|year=2015}}</ref> until this peak, then it starts decreasing.]]\nThe [[Laffer curve]] depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue.\n\nGovernments use different kinds of taxes and vary the tax rates. They do this in order to distribute the tax burden among individuals or classes of the population involved in taxable activities, such as the [[business sector]], or to redistribute resources between individuals or classes in the population. Historically,{{when|date=December 2016}} taxes on the poor supported the [[nobility]]; modern [[social security|social-security]] systems aim to support the poor, the disabled, or the retired by taxes on those who are still working. In addition, taxes are applied to fund foreign aid and military ventures, to influence the [[macroeconomic]] performance of the economy (a government's strategy for doing this is called its [[fiscal policy]]; see also [[tax exemption]]), or to modify patterns of consumption or employment within an economy, by making some classes of transaction more or less attractive.\n\nA state's tax system often{{quantify|date=December 2016}} reflects its communal values and the values of those in current political power. To create a system of taxation, a state must make choices regarding the distribution of the tax burden\u2014who will pay taxes and how much they will pay\u2014and how the taxes collected will be spent. In democratic nations where the public elects those in charge of establishing or administering the tax system, these choices reflect the type of community that the public wishes to create. In countries where the public does not have a significant amount of influence over the system of taxation, that system may reflect more closely the values of those in power.\n\nAll large [[business]]es incur administrative costs in the process of delivering revenue collected from customers to the suppliers of the goods or services being purchased. Taxation is no different; the resource collected from the public through taxation is always greater than the amount which can be used by the government.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} The difference is called the [[compliance cost]] and includes (for example) the labour cost and other expenses incurred in complying with tax laws and rules. The collection of a tax in order to spend it on a specified purpose, for example collecting a tax on alcohol to pay directly for alcoholism-rehabilitation centres, is called [[hypothecation (taxation)|hypothecation]]. [[Finance minister]]s often dislike this practice, since it reduces their freedom of action. Some economic theorists regard hypothecation as intellectually dishonest since, in reality, money is [[fungibility|fungible]]. Furthermore, it often happens that taxes or excises initially levied to fund some specific government programs are then later diverted to the government general fund. In some cases, such taxes are collected in fundamentally inefficient ways, for example, though highway tolls.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nSince governments also resolve commercial disputes, especially in countries with [[common law]], similar arguments are sometimes used to justify a [[sales tax]] or [[value added tax]]. Some ([[Libertarianism|libertarians]], for example) portray most or all forms of taxes as [[Taxation as theft|immoral]] due to their involuntary (and therefore eventually [[Harm principle|coercive or violent]]) nature. The most extreme anti-tax view, [[anarcho-capitalism]], holds that all social services should be voluntarily bought by the people using them.\n\n==Types==\nThe [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) publishes an analysis of the tax systems of member countries. As part of such analysis, OECD has developed a definition and system of classification of internal taxes,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.oecd.org/daf/mai/pdf/eg2/eg2963e.pdf |title= Definition of Taxes (Note by the Chairman), 1996 |accessdate= 22 January 2013}}</ref> generally followed below. In addition, many countries impose taxes ([[tariff]]s) on the import of goods.\n\n===Income===\n\n====Income tax====\n{{Main|Income tax}}\nMany jurisdictions tax the income of individuals and [[business entities]], including [[corporation]]s. Generally, the authorities impose tax on net profits from a business, on net gains, and on other income. Computation of income subject to tax may be determined under accounting principles used in the jurisdiction, which may be modified or replaced by [[tax law|tax-law]] principles in the jurisdiction. The [[Tax incidence|incidence of taxation]] varies by system, and some systems may be viewed{{by whom|date=October 2018}} as [[Progressive tax|progressive]] or [[Regressive tax|regressive]]. Rates of tax may vary or be constant (flat) by income level. Many systems allow individuals certain personal allowances and other non-business reductions to taxable income, although business deductions tend to be favored over personal deductions.\n\n[[Personal income tax]] is often collected on a [[PAYE|pay-as-you-earn]] basis, with small corrections made soon after the end of the [[tax year]]. These corrections take one of two forms: payments to the government, for taxpayers who have not paid enough during the tax year; and [[tax refund]]s from the government to those who have overpaid. Income-tax systems will often have deductions available that reduces the total tax liability by reducing total taxable income. They may allow losses from one type of income to count against another. For example, a loss on the stock market may be deducted against taxes paid on wages. Other tax systems may isolate the loss, such that business losses can only be deducted against business tax by carrying forward the loss to later tax years.\n\n====Negative income====\n{{Main|Negative income tax}}\nIn economics, a negative income tax (abbreviated NIT) is a [[progressive income tax]] system where people earning below a certain amount receive supplemental payment from the government instead of paying taxes to the government.\n\n====Capital gains====\n{{Main|Capital gains tax}}\nMost jurisdictions imposing an income tax treat [[capital gain]]s as part of income subject to tax. Capital gain is generally a gain on sale of capital assets\u2014that is, those assets not held for sale in the ordinary course of business. Capital assets include personal assets in many jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions provide preferential rates of tax or only partial taxation for capital gains. Some jurisdictions impose different rates or levels of capital-gains taxation based on the length of time the asset was held. Because tax rates are often much lower for capital gains than for ordinary income, there is widespread controversy and dispute about the proper definition of capital.\n\n====Corporate====\n{{Main|Corporate tax}}\nCorporate tax refers to income tax, capital tax, net-worth tax or other taxes imposed on corporations. Rates of tax and the taxable base for corporations may differ from those for individuals or for other taxable persons.\n\n===Social-security contributions===\n[[File:GDP per capita PPP vs social contributions 2016.svg|thumb|[[Public finance|General government]] revenue, in % of [[GDP]], from social contributions. For this data, the [[variance]] of GDP per capita with purchasing power parity (PPP) is explained in 20% by social contributions revenue.]]\n\nMany countries provide publicly funded retirement or health-care systems.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/progdesc/index.html |title= Social Security Programs Throughout the World on the U.S. Social Security website for links to individual country program descriptions |publisher= Ssa.gov |accessdate= 22 January 2013}}</ref> In connection with these systems, the country typically requires employers and/or employees to make compulsory payments.<ref>By contrast, some countries, such as [http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/progdesc/ssptw/2010-2011/asia/newzealand.html New Zealand], finance the programs through other taxes.</ref> These payments are often computed by reference to wages or earnings from self-employment. Tax rates are generally fixed, but a different rate may be imposed on employers than on employees.<ref>See for example [http://labour.nic.in/ss/overview.html India Social Security overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623221835/http://labour.nic.in/ss/overview.html |date=23 June 2011 }}</ref> Some systems provide an upper limit on earnings subject to the tax. A few systems provide that the tax is payable only on wages above a particular amount. Such upper or lower limits may apply for retirement but not for health-care components of the tax. Some{{who|date=October 2018}} have argued that such taxes on wages are a form of \"forced savings\" and not really a tax, while others point to redistribution through such systems between generations (from newer cohorts to older cohorts) and across income levels (from higher income-levels to lower income-levels) which suggests that such programs are really tax and spending programs.\n\n===Payroll or workforce===\n{{Main|Payroll tax}}Unemployment and similar taxes are often imposed on employers based on total payroll. These taxes may be imposed in both the country and sub-country levels.<ref>See for example the United States [[Federal Unemployment Tax Act]].</ref>\n\n===Wealth===\nA '''wealth tax''' is a levy on the total value of personal assets, including: bank deposits, real estate, assets in insurance and pension plans, ownership of [[unincorporated entity|unincorporated businesses]], [[Security (finance)|financial securities]], and personal trusts.<ref name=\"EWBR\">Edward N. Wolff, \"Time for a Wealth Tax?\", [http://bostonreview.net/BR21.1/wolff.html ''Boston Review'', Feb\u2013Mar 1996 (recommending a net wealth tax for the US of 0.05% for the first $100,000 in assets to 0.3% for assets over $1,000,000]</ref> Typically liabilities (primarily mortgages and other loans) are deducted, hence it is sometimes called a '''net wealth tax'''.\n\n===Property===\nRecurrent property taxes may be imposed on immovable property (real property) and on some classes of movable property. In addition, recurrent taxes may be imposed on the net wealth of individuals or corporations.<ref>Taxes on the net wealth of corporations are often referred to as [[corporate tax]].</ref> Many jurisdictions impose [[estate tax]], [[gift tax]] or other [[inheritance tax]]es on property at death or at the time of gift transfer. Some jurisdictions impose [[Financial transaction tax|taxes on financial or capital transactions]].\n\n====Property taxes====\n{{Main|Property tax|Land value tax}}\nA property tax (or millage tax) is an [[ad valorem tax|''ad valorem'' tax]] levy on the value of property that the owner of the property is required to pay to a government in which the property is situated. Multiple jurisdictions may tax the same property. There are three general varieties of property: land, improvements to land (immovable man-made things, e.g. buildings) and personal property (movable things). [[Real property|Real estate]] or realty is the combination of land and improvements to land.\n\nProperty taxes are usually charged on a recurrent basis (e.g., yearly). A common type of property tax is an annual charge on the ownership of [[real estate]], where the tax base is the estimated value of the property. For a period of over 150 years from 1695 the government of England levied a [[window tax]], with the result that one can still see [[listed buildings]] with windows bricked up in order to save their owners money. A similar tax on hearths existed in France and elsewhere, with similar results. The two most common types of event-driven property taxes are [[stamp duty]], charged upon change of ownership, and [[inheritance tax]], which many countries impose on the estates of the deceased.\n\nIn contrast with a tax on real estate (land and buildings), a [[land value tax|land-value tax]] (or LVT) is levied only on the unimproved value of the land (\"land\" in this instance may mean either the economic term, i.e., all natural resources, or the natural resources associated with specific areas of the Earth's surface: \"lots\" or \"land parcels\"). Proponents of land-value tax argue that it is economically justified, as it will not deter production, distort market mechanisms or otherwise create [[deadweight loss]]es the way other taxes do.<ref>{{Cite book |last= McCluskey |first= William J. |last2= Franzsen |first2= Ri\u00ebl C. D. |title= Land Value Taxation: An Applied Analysis |page= 4 |publisher= Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |year= 2005 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jkogP2U4k0AC&pg=PA73|isbn= 978-0-7546-1490-6}}</ref>\n\nWhen real estate is held by a higher government unit or some other entity not subject to taxation by the local government, the taxing authority may receive a [[PILOT (finance)|payment in lieu of taxes]] to compensate it for some or all of the foregone tax revenues.\n\nIn many jurisdictions (including many American states), there is a general tax levied periodically on residents who own [[personal property]] (personalty) within the jurisdiction. Vehicle and boat registration fees are subsets of this kind of tax. The tax is often designed with blanket coverage and large exceptions for things like food and clothing. Household goods are often exempt when kept or used within the household.<ref name=\"taxpolicycenter1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxtopics/budget.cfm |title=TPC Tax Topics &#124; Federal Budget |publisher=Taxpolicycenter.org |accessdate=27 March 2009}}</ref> Any otherwise non-exempt object can lose its exemption if regularly kept outside the household.<ref name=\"taxpolicycenter1\" /> Thus, tax collectors often monitor newspaper articles for stories about wealthy people who have lent art to museums for public display, because the artworks have then become subject to personal property tax.<ref name=\"taxpolicycenter1\" /> If an artwork had to be sent to another state for some touch-ups, it may have become subject to personal property tax in ''that'' state as well.<ref name=\"taxpolicycenter1\" />\n\n====Inheritance====\n{{Main|Inheritance tax}}\nInheritance tax, estate tax, and death tax or duty are the names given to various taxes which arise on the death of an individual. In United States [[tax law]], there is a distinction between an estate tax and an inheritance tax: the former taxes the personal representatives of the deceased, while the latter taxes the beneficiaries of the estate. However, this distinction does not apply in other jurisdictions; for example, if using this terminology UK inheritance tax would be an estate tax.\n\n====Expatriation====\n{{Main|Expatriation tax}}\nAn expatriation tax is a tax on individuals who renounce their [[citizenship]] or residence. The tax is often imposed based on a deemed disposition of all the individual's property. One example is the [[United States]] under the ''[[American Jobs Creation Act]]'', where any individual who has a net worth of $2 million or an average income-tax liability of $127,000 who renounces his or her citizenship and leaves the country is automatically assumed to have done so for tax avoidance reasons and is subject to a higher tax rate.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/877- |title=26 USC 877 |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |accessdate=22 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Transfer====\n{{Main|Transfer tax}}\nHistorically, in many countries, a contract needs to have a stamp affixed to make it valid. The charge for the stamp is either a fixed amount or a percentage of the value of the transaction. In most countries, the stamp has been abolished but [[stamp duty]] remains. Stamp duty is levied in the UK on the purchase of shares and securities, the issue of bearer instruments, and certain partnership transactions. Its modern derivatives, [[stamp duty reserve tax]] and [[stamp duty land tax]], are respectively charged on transactions involving securities and land. Stamp duty has the effect of discouraging speculative purchases of assets by decreasing liquidity. In the [[United States]], transfer tax is often charged by the state or local government and (in the case of real property transfers) can be tied to the recording of the deed or other transfer documents.\n\n====Wealth (net worth)====\n{{Main|Wealth tax}}\nSome countries' governments will require declaration of the tax payers' [[balance sheet]] (assets and liabilities), and from that exact a tax on [[net worth]] (assets minus liabilities), as a percentage of the net worth, or a percentage of the net worth exceeding a certain level. The tax may be levied on \"[[natural person|natural]]\" or \"[[juristic person|legal persons.]]\"\n\n===Goods and services===\n====Value added====\n{{Main|Value added tax}}\nA value added tax (VAT), also known as Goods and Services Tax (G.S.T), Single Business Tax, or Turnover Tax in some countries, applies the equivalent of a sales tax to every operation that creates value. To give an example, sheet steel is imported by a machine manufacturer. That manufacturer will pay the VAT on the purchase price, remitting that amount to the government. The manufacturer will then transform the steel into a machine, selling the machine for a higher price to a wholesale distributor. The manufacturer will collect the VAT on the higher price, but will remit to the government only the excess related to the \"value added\" (the price over the cost of the sheet steel). The wholesale distributor will then continue the process, charging the retail distributor the VAT on the entire price to the retailer, but remitting only the amount related to the distribution mark-up to the government. The last VAT amount is paid by the eventual retail customer who cannot recover any of the previously paid VAT. For a VAT and sales tax of identical rates, the total tax paid is the same, but it is paid at differing points in the process.\n\nVAT is usually administrated by requiring the company to complete a VAT return, giving details of VAT it has been charged (referred to as input tax) and VAT it has charged to others (referred to as output tax). The difference between output tax and input tax is payable to the Local Tax Authority.\n\nMany tax authorities have introduced automated VAT which has increased [[accountability]] and [[auditability]], by utilizing computer-systems, thereby also enabling anti-cybercrime offices as well.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n====Sales====\n{{Main|Sales tax}}\nSales taxes are levied when a commodity is sold to its final consumer. Retail organizations contend that such taxes discourage retail sales. The question of whether they are generally progressive or regressive is a subject of much current debate. People with higher incomes spend a lower proportion of them, so a flat-rate sales tax will tend to be regressive. It is therefore common to exempt food, utilities and other necessities from sales taxes, since poor people spend a higher proportion of their incomes on these commodities, so such exemptions make the tax more progressive. This is the classic \"You pay for what you spend\" tax, as only those who spend money on non-exempt (i.e. luxury) items pay the tax.\n\nA small number of U.S. states rely entirely on sales taxes for state revenue, as those states do not levy a state income tax. Such states tend to have a moderate to large amount of tourism or inter-state travel that occurs within their borders, allowing the state to benefit from taxes from people the state would otherwise not tax. In this way, the state is able to reduce the tax burden on its citizens. The U.S. states that do not levy a state income tax are Alaska, Tennessee, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas,<ref>Although Texas has no individual income tax, the state does impose a [[franchise tax]]\u2014soon to be replaced by a margin tax\u2014on business activity that, while not denominated as an income tax, is in substance a kind of income tax.</ref> Washington state, and Wyoming. Additionally, New Hampshire and Tennessee levy state income taxes only on [[Dividend tax|dividends]] and interest income. Of the above states, only Alaska and New Hampshire do not levy a state sales tax. Additional information can be obtained at the [http://www.taxadmin.org/ Federation of Tax Administrators] website.\n\nIn the United States, there is a growing movement<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13110436 |title=Economist.com |work=Economist|date=12 February 2009 |accessdate=27 March 2009}}</ref> for the replacement of all federal payroll and income taxes (both corporate and personal) with a national retail sales tax and monthly tax rebate to households of citizens and legal resident aliens. The tax proposal is named [[FairTax]]. In Canada, the federal sales tax is called the Goods and Services tax (GST) and now stands at 5%. The provinces of British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Prince Edward Island also have a provincial sales tax [PST]. The provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland & Labrador, and Ontario have harmonized their provincial sales taxes with the GST\u2014Harmonized Sales Tax [HST], and thus is a full VAT. The province of Quebec collects the Quebec Sales Tax [QST] which is based on the GST with certain differences. Most businesses can claim back the GST, HST and QST they pay, and so effectively it is the final consumer who pays the tax.\n\n====Excises====\n{{Main|Excise}}\nAn excise duty is an [[indirect tax]] imposed upon goods during the process of their manufacture, production or distribution, and is usually proportionate to their quantity or value. Excise duties were first introduced into England in the year 1643, as part of a scheme of revenue and taxation devised by parliamentarian [[John Pym]] and approved by the [[Long Parliament]]. These duties consisted of charges on beer, ale, cider, cherry wine and tobacco, to which list were afterwards added paper, soap, candles, malt, hops, and sweets. The basic principle of excise duties was that they were taxes on the production, manufacture or distribution of articles which could not be taxed through the [[customs house]], and revenue derived from that source is called excise revenue proper. The fundamental conception of the term is that of a tax on articles produced or manufactured in a country. In the taxation of such articles of luxury as spirits, beer, tobacco, and cigars, it has been the practice to place a certain duty on the importation of these articles (a [[tariff|customs duty]]).<ref name=Quick>{{cite book |last1=Quick |first1=John |last2=Garran |first2=Robert |title=The Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth |date=1 January 1901 |publisher=Angus & Robertson |location=Australia |page=837 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VR-CAAAAIAAJ }}</ref>\n\nExcises (or exemptions from them) are also used to modify consumption patterns of a certain area ([[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]]). For example, a high excise is used to discourage [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] consumption, relative to other goods. This may be combined with [[Hypothecated tax|hypothecation]] if the proceeds are then used to pay for the costs of treating illness caused by alcohol abuse. Similar taxes may exist on [[tobacco]], [[pornography]], etc., and they may be collectively referred to as \"[[sin tax]]es\". A [[carbon tax]] is a tax on the consumption of carbon-based non-renewable fuels, such as petrol, diesel-fuel, jet fuels, and natural gas. The object is to reduce the release of carbon into the atmosphere. In the United Kingdom, [[vehicle excise duty]] is an annual tax on vehicle ownership.\n\n===Tariff===\n{{Main|Tariff}}\nAn import or export tariff (also called customs duty or impost) is a charge for the movement of goods through a political border. Tariffs discourage [[trade]], and they may be used by governments to protect domestic industries. A proportion of tariff revenues is often hypothecated to pay government to maintain a navy or border police. The classic ways of cheating a tariff are [[smuggling]] or declaring a false value of goods. Tax, tariff and trade rules in modern times are usually set together because of their common impact on [[industrial policy]], [[investment policy]], and [[agricultural policy]]. A [[trade bloc]] is a group of allied countries agreeing to minimize or eliminate tariffs against trade with each other, and possibly to impose protective tariffs on imports from outside the bloc. A [[customs union]] has a [[common external tariff]], and the participating countries share the revenues from tariffs on goods entering the customs union.\n\nIn some societies, tariffs also could be imposed by local authorities on the movement of goods between regions (or via specific internal gateways). A notable example is the ''[[likin (taxation)|likin]]'', which became an important revenue source for local governments in the late [[Qing Empire|Qing China]].\n\n===Other===\n\n====License fees====\nOccupational taxes or license fees may be imposed on businesses or individuals engaged in certain businesses. Many jurisdictions impose a tax on vehicles.\n\n====Poll====\n{{Main|Poll tax}}\nA poll tax, also called a ''per capita tax'', or ''capitation tax'', is a tax that levies a set amount per individual. It is an example of the concept of [[fixed tax]]. One of the earliest taxes mentioned in the [[Bible]] of a half-shekel per annum from each adult Jew (Ex. 30:11\u201316) was a form of poll tax. Poll taxes are administratively cheap because they are easy to compute and collect and difficult to cheat. Economists have considered poll taxes economically efficient because people are presumed to be in fixed supply and poll taxes therefore do not lead to economic distortions. However, poll taxes are very unpopular because poorer people pay a higher proportion of their income than richer people. In addition, the supply of people is in fact not fixed over time: on average, couples will choose to have fewer children if a poll tax is imposed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/TaxFacts/listdocs.cfm?topic2id=60 |title=Tax Facts &#124; Tax Facts Listing |publisher=Taxpolicycenter.org |accessdate=27 March 2009}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=June 2011}} The introduction of a poll tax in medieval England was the primary cause of the 1381 [[Peasants' Revolt]]. Scotland was the first to be used to test the new poll tax in 1989 with England and Wales in 1990. The change from a progressive local taxation based on property values to a single-rate form of taxation regardless of ability to pay (the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Community Charge]], but more popularly referred to as the Poll Tax), led to widespread refusal to pay and to incidents of civil unrest, known colloquially as the '[[Poll Tax Riots]]'.\n\n====Other====\nSome types of taxes have been proposed but not actually adopted in any major jurisdiction. These include:\n* [[Bank tax]]\n* [[Financial transaction tax]]es including currency transaction taxes\n\n===Descriptive labels===\n\n====Ad valorem and per unit====\n{{Main|Ad valorem tax|Per unit tax}}\nAn ''ad valorem'' tax is one where the tax base is the value of a good, service, or property. Sales taxes, tariffs, property taxes, inheritance taxes, and value added taxes are different types of ad valorem tax. An ad valorem tax is typically imposed at the time of a transaction (sales tax or value added tax (VAT)) but it may be imposed on an annual basis (property tax) or in connection with another significant event (inheritance tax or tariffs).\n\nIn contrast to ad valorem taxation is a ''per unit'' tax, where the tax base is the quantity of something, regardless of its price. An [[excise tax]] is an example.\n\n====Consumption====\n{{Main|Consumption tax}}\nConsumption tax refers to any tax on non-investment spending, and can be implemented by means of a sales tax, consumer value added tax, or by modifying an income tax to allow for unlimited deductions for investment or savings.\n\n====Environmental====\n{{See also|Ecotax|Gas Guzzler Tax|Polluter pays principle|Pigovian tax}}\nThis includes [[natural resources consumption tax]], greenhouse gas tax ([[Carbon tax]]), \"sulfuric tax\", and others. The stated purpose is to reduce the environmental impact by [[Effect of taxes and subsidies on price|repricing]]. Economists describe environmental impacts as negative [[externalities]]. As early as 1920, [[Pigovian tax|Arthur Pigou]] suggested a tax to deal with externalities (see also the section on [[#Increased economic welfare|Increased economic welfare]] below). The proper implementation of environmental taxes has been the subject of a long lasting debate.\n\n====Proportional, progressive, regressive, and lump-sum====\nAn important feature of tax systems is the percentage of the tax burden as it relates to income or consumption. The terms progressive, regressive, and proportional are used to describe the way the rate progresses from low to high, from high to low, or proportionally. The terms describe a distribution effect, which can be applied to any type of tax system (income or consumption) that meets the definition.\n* A [[progressive tax]] is a tax imposed so that the [[effective tax rate]] increases as the amount to which the rate is applied increases.\n* The opposite of a progressive tax is a [[regressive tax]], where the effective tax rate decreases as the amount to which the rate is applied increases. This effect is commonly produced where means testing is used to withdraw tax allowances or state benefits.\n* In between is a [[proportional tax]], where the effective tax rate is fixed, while the amount to which the rate is applied increases.\n* A lump-sum tax is a tax that is a fixed amount, no matter the change in circumstance of the taxed entity. This in actuality is a regressive tax as those with lower income must use higher percentage of their income than those with higher income and therefore the effect of the tax reduces as a function of income.\n\nThe terms can also be used to apply meaning to the taxation of select consumption, such as a tax on luxury goods and the exemption of basic necessities may be described as having progressive effects as it increases a tax burden on high end consumption and decreases a tax burden on low end consumption.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/app/understandingTaxes/jsp/whys/lp/IWT5L1lp.jsp |title=Internal Revenue Service |publisher=webcache.googleusercontent.com |accessdate=27 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816190910/https://www.irs.gov/app/understandingTaxes/jsp/whys/lp/IWT5L1lp.jsp |archivedate=16 August 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9370763/luxury-tax |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707094214/http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9370763/luxury-tax |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 July 2012 |title=luxury tax&nbsp;\u2014 Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Concise.britannica.com |accessdate=27 March 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |jstor=1813222 |title=Clothing Exemptions and Sales Tax Regressivity |first=Jeffrey M. |last=Schaefer |date=1 January 1969 |journal=The American Economic Review |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=596\u201399}}</ref>\n\n====Direct and indirect====\n{{Main|Direct tax|Indirect tax}}\nTaxes are sometimes referred to as \"direct taxes\" or \"indirect taxes\". The meaning of these terms can vary in different contexts, which can sometimes lead to confusion. An economic definition, by Atkinson, states that \"...direct taxes may be adjusted to the individual characteristics of the taxpayer, whereas indirect taxes are levied on transactions irrespective of the circumstances of buyer or seller.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Atkinson |first1=A. B. |year=1977 |title=Optimal Taxation and the Direct Versus Indirect Tax Controversy |journal=Can. J. Econ. |volume=590 |page=592}}</ref> According to this definition, for example, income tax is \"direct\", and sales tax is \"indirect\". \n \nIn law, the terms may have different meanings. In U.S. constitutional law, for instance, direct taxes refer to [[Tax per head|poll taxes]] and [[property tax]]es, which are based on simple existence or ownership. Indirect taxes are imposed on events, rights, privileges, and activities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.investorguide.com/igu-article-1138-tax-basics-what-is-difference-between-direct-and-indirect-tax.html |title=What is Difference Between Direct and Indirect Tax? |publisher=Investor Guide |accessdate=28 October 2011}}</ref> Thus, a tax on the sale of property would be considered an indirect tax, whereas the tax on simply owning the property itself would be a direct tax.\n\n===Fees and effective===\nGovernments may charge user [[fee]]s, tolls, or other types of assessments in exchange of particular goods, services, or use of property.

Historically tolls have been used to pay for public bridge, road and tunnel projects. They have also been used in privately constructed transport links. The toll is likely to be a fixed charge, possibly graduated for vehicle type, or for distance on long routes.\n* User fees, such as those charged for use of parks or other government owned facilities.\n* Ruling fees charged by governmental agencies to make determinations in particular situations.\n\nSome scholars refer to certain economic effects as taxes, though they are not levies imposed by governments. These include:\n* [[Inflation tax]]: the economic disadvantage suffered by holders of [[cash and cash equivalents]] in one denomination of [[currency]] due to the effects of [[expansionary monetary policy]]<ref>Some economists{{who|date=September 2010}} hold that the inflation tax affects the lower and middle classes more than the rich, as they hold a larger fraction of their income in cash, they are much less likely to receive the newly created monies before the market has adjusted with inflated prices, and more often have fixed incomes, [[wages]] or [[pensions]]. Some argue that inflation is a [[regressive tax|regressive]] [[consumption tax]]. Also see Andr\u00e9s Erosa and Gustavo Ventura, \"[http://www.ssc.uwo.ca/economics/econref/workingpapers/researchreports/wp2000/wp2000_1.pdf On inflation as a regressive consumption tax] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910064531/http://www.ssc.uwo.ca/economics/econref/workingpapers/researchreports/wp2000/wp2000_1.pdf |date=10 September 2008 }}\". Some{{who|date=June 2011}} claim there are systemic effects of an expansionary monetary policy, which are also definitively taxing, imposing a financial charge on some as a result of the policy. Because the effects of monetary expansion or [[counterfeiting]] are never uniform over an entire economy, the policy influences capital transfers in the market, creating [[economic bubbles]] where the new monies are first introduced. Economic bubbles increase market instability, and therefore increase investment risk, creating the conditions common to a [[recession]]. This particular tax can be understood to be levied on future generations that would have benefited from economic growth, and it has a 100% transfer cost (so long as people are not acting against their interests, increased uncertainty benefits no-one).

The other four-fifths you may keep as seed for the fields and as food for yourselves and your households and your children\". [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] was telling the people of [[Egypt]] how to divide their crop, providing a portion to the Pharaoh. A share (20%) of the crop was the tax (in this case, a special rather than an ordinary tax, as it was gathered against an expected famine) The stock made by was returned and equally shared with the people of Egypt and traded with the surrounding nations thus saving and elevating Egypt.  .<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+41%3A33-36&version=NIV |title=The Bible}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], a regulated and sustainable tax system was introduced by [[Darius I the Great]] in 500 BC;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.1902encyclopedia.com/D/DAR/darius-i-the-great.html |title=Darius I (Darius the Great), King of Persia (from 521 BC) |publisher=1902encyclopedia.com |accessdate=22 January 2013}}</ref> the [[Persia]]n system of taxation was tailored to each [[Satrapy]] (the area ruled by a Satrap or provincial governor). At differing times, there were between 20 and 30 Satrapies in the Empire and each was assessed according to its supposed productivity. It was the responsibility of the Satrap to collect the due amount and to send it to the treasury, after deducting his expenses (the expenses and the power of deciding precisely how and from whom to raise the money in the province, offer maximum opportunity for rich pickings). The quantities demanded from the various provinces gave a vivid picture of their economic potential. For instance, [[Babylon]] was assessed for the highest amount and for a startling mixture of commodities; 1,000 [[Talent (measurement)|silver talents]] and four months supply of food for the army. [[India]], a province fabled for its gold, was to supply gold dust equal in value to the very large amount of 4,680 silver talents. Egypt was known for the wealth of its crops; it was to be the granary of the Persian Empire (and, later, of the [[Roman Empire]]) and was required to provide 120,000 measures of grain in addition to 700 talents of silver.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=aa65 |title=History of Iran (Persia) |publisher=Historyworld.net |accessdate=22 January 2013}}</ref> This tax was exclusively levied on Satrapies based on their lands, productive capacity and tribute levels.<ref>''The Theocratic Ideology of the Chronicler'' \u2013 by Jonathan E.

But taxation levels are hard to compare to the size and flow of the economy since [[gross domestic product|production]] numbers are not as readily available. Government expenditures and revenue in France during the 17th century went from about 24.30 million ''[[livres]]'' in 1600\u201310 to about 126.86 million ''livres'' in 1650\u201359 to about 117.99 million ''livres'' in 1700\u201310 when [[government debt]] had reached 1.6 billion ''livres''.

This increase was greatest in England, [[Peter Mathias]] and Patrick O'Brien found that the tax burden increased by 85% over this period. Another study confirmed this number, finding that per capita tax revenues had grown almost sixfold over the eighteenth century, but that steady economic growth had made the real burden on each individual only double over this period before the industrial revolution. [[Effective tax rate]]s were higher in Britain than France the years before the [[French Revolution]], twice in per capita income comparison, but they were mostly placed on international trade.

In many countries, taxes are imposed on business (such as [[corporate tax]]es or portions of [[payroll tax]]es). However, who ultimately pays the tax (the tax \"burden\") is determined by the marketplace as taxes become [[Effect of taxes and subsidies on price|embedded]] into production costs. Economic theory suggests that the economic effect of tax does not necessarily fall at the point where it is legally levied. For instance, a tax on employment paid by employers will impact on the employee, at least in the long run. The greatest share of the tax burden tends to fall on the most inelastic factor involved\u2014the part of the transaction which is affected least by a change in price. So, for instance, a tax on wages in a town will (at least in the long run) affect property-owners in that area.\n\nDepending on how quantities supplied and demanded vary with price (the \"elasticities\" of supply and demand), a tax can be absorbed by the seller (in the form of lower pre-tax prices), or by the buyer (in the form of higher post-tax prices). If the elasticity of supply is low, more of the tax will be paid by the supplier. If the elasticity of demand is low, more will be paid by the customer; and, contrariwise for the cases where those elasticities are high. If the seller is a competitive firm, the tax burden is distributed over the [[factors of production]] depending on the elasticities thereof; this includes workers (in the form of lower wages), capital investors (in the form of loss to shareholders), landowners (in the form of lower rents), entrepreneurs (in the form of lower wages of superintendence) and customers (in the form of higher prices).\n\nTo show this relationship, suppose that the market price of a product is $1.00, and that a $0.50 tax is imposed on the product that, by law, is to be collected from the seller. If the product has an elastic demand, a greater portion of the tax will be absorbed by the seller. This is because goods with elastic demand cause a large decline in quantity demanded for a small increase in price. Therefore, in order to stabilize sales, the seller absorbs more of the additional tax burden. For example, the seller might drop the price of the product to $0.70 so that, after adding in the tax, the buyer pays a total of $1.20, or $0.20 more than he did before the $0.50 tax was imposed. In this example, the buyer has paid $0.20 of the $0.50 tax (in the form of a post-tax price) and the seller has paid the remaining $0.30 (in the form of a lower pre-tax price).<ref>''Parkin, Michael (2006), Principles of Microeconomics, p. 134.</ref>\n\n===Increased economic welfare===\n\n====Government spending====\nThe purpose of taxation is to provide for [[government spending]] without [[inflation]]. The provision of public goods such as roads and other infrastructure, schools, a [[social safety net]], health care, national defense, law enforcement, and a courts system increases the economic welfare of society if the benefit outweighs the costs involved.\n\n====Pigovian====\nThe existence of a tax can ''increase'' economic efficiency in some cases. If there is a [[negative externality]] associated with a good, meaning that it has negative effects not felt by the consumer, then a free market will trade too much of that good. By taxing the good, the government can increase overall welfare as well as raising revenue. This type of tax is called a [[Pigovian tax]], after economist [[Arthur Cecil Pigou|Arthur Pigou]].\n\nPossible Pigovian taxes include those on polluting fuels (like [[petrol]]), taxes on goods which incur public healthcare costs (such as [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]] or [[tobacco]]), and charges for existing 'free' public goods (like [[congestion charging]]) are another possibility.\n\n====Reduced inequality====\nProgressive taxation may reduce [[economic inequality]]. This effect occurs even when the tax revenue isn't [[transfer payments|redistributed]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Reduced economic welfare===\nMost taxes (see [[#Deadweight costs of taxation|below]]) have [[side effects]] that reduce [[economic welfare]], either by mandating unproductive labor (compliance costs) or by creating distortions to economic incentives ([[deadweight loss]] and [[perverse incentive]]s).{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n====Cost of compliance====\nAlthough governments must spend money on tax collection activities, some of the costs, particularly for keeping records and filling out forms, are borne by businesses and by private individuals. These are collectively called costs of compliance. More complex tax systems tend to have higher compliance costs. This fact can be used as the basis for practical or moral arguments in favor of tax simplification (such as the [[FairTax]] or [[OneTax]], and some [[flat tax]] proposals).\n\n====Deadweight costs====\n[[File:Tax deadweight.gif|thumb|upright=1.35|Diagram illustrating deadweight costs of taxes]]\n\nIn the absence of negative [[Externality|externalities]], the introduction of taxes into a market reduces [[economic efficiency]] by causing [[deadweight loss]]. In a competitive market the [[price]] of a particular [[Good (economics)|economic good]] adjusts to ensure that all trades which benefit both the buyer and the seller of a good occur. The introduction of a tax causes the price received by the seller to be less than the cost to the buyer by the amount of the tax. This causes fewer transactions to occur, which reduces [[welfare economics|economic welfare]]; the individuals or businesses involved are less well off than before the tax. The [[tax burden]] and the amount of deadweight cost is dependent on the [[elasticity (economics)|elasticity]] of supply and demand for the good taxed.\n\nMost taxes\u2014including [[income tax]] and [[sales tax]]\u2014can have significant deadweight costs. The only way to avoid deadweight costs in an economy that is generally competitive is to refrain from taxes that change [[economic incentive]]s. Such taxes include the [[land value tax]],<ref>{{cite book|author1=William J. McCluskey|author2=Ri\u00ebl C. D. Franzsen|title=Land Value Taxation: An Applied Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jkogP2U4k0AC&pg=PA73|year=2005|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-0-7546-1490-6|page=73}}</ref> where the tax is on a good in completely inelastic supply, a [[lump sum tax]] such as a [[Tax per head|poll tax]] (head tax) which is paid by all adults regardless of their choices. Arguably a [[windfall profits tax]] which is entirely unanticipated can also fall into this category.\n\nDeadweight loss does not account for the effect taxes have in leveling the business playing field. Businesses that have more money are better suited to fend off competition. It is common that an industry with a small amount of very large corporations has a very high barrier of entry for new entrants coming into the marketplace. This is due to the fact that the larger the corporation, the better its position to negotiate with suppliers. Also, larger companies may be able to operate at low or even negative profits for extended periods of time, thus pushing out competition. More progressive taxation of profits, however, would reduce such barriers for new entrants, thereby increasing competition and ultimately benefiting consumers.<ref>{{Cite journal |first=Reuven S. |last=Avi-Yonah |date=April 2002 |title=Why Tax the Rich?

The more details of [[tax policy]] there are, the more opportunities for legal [[tax avoidance]] and illegal [[tax evasion]]. These not only result in lost revenue, but involve additional costs: for instance, payments made for tax advice are essentially deadweight costs because they add no wealth to the economy. [[Perverse incentive]]s also occur because of non-taxable 'hidden' transactions; for instance, a sale from one company to another might be liable for [[sales tax]], but if the same goods were shipped from one branch of a corporation to another, no tax would be payable.\n\nTo address these issues, economists often suggest simple and transparent tax structures which avoid providing loopholes. Sales tax, for instance, can be replaced with a [[value added tax]] which disregards intermediate transactions.\n\n==In developing countries==\nFollowing Nicolas Kaldor's research, public finance in developing countries is strongly tied to state capacity and financial development. As state capacity develops, states not only increase the level of taxation but also the pattern of taxation. With the increase of larger tax bases and the diminish of the importance of trading tax, while income tax gains more importance.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stern |first1=Nicolas |last2=Burgess |first2=Robin |title=Taxation and Development |journal=Journal of Economic Literature}}</ref>\nAccording to Tilly's argument, state capacity evolves as response to the emergence of war. War is an incentive for states to raise tax and strengthen states capacity. Historically, many taxation breakthroughs took place during the wartime. The introduction of income tax in Britain was due to the Napoleonic War in 1798. US first introduce income tax during Civil War.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Besley |first1=Timothy |last2=Persson |first2=Torsten |title=The Origins of State Capacity: Property Rights, Taxation, and Politics}}</ref>\nTaxation is constrained by the fiscal and legal capacities of a country.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Besley |first1=Timothy |last2=Persson |first2=Trosten |title=The Origins of State Capacity: Property Rights, Taxation, and Politics}}</ref> Fiscal and legal capacities also complement each other. A well-designed tax system can minimize efficiency loss and boost economic growth. With better compliance and better support to financial institutions and individual property, the government will be able to collect more tax. Although wealthier countries have higher tax revenue, economic growth does not always translate to higher tax revenue. For example, in India, increases in exemptions leads to the stagnation of income tax revenue at around 0.5% of GDP since 1986.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Piketty |first1=Thomas |last2=Qian |first2=Nancy |title=Income Inequality and Progressive Income Taxation in China and India, 1986\u20132015}}</ref>\n\nResearchers for [[EPS PEAKS]] <ref name=\"Economics Topic Guide Taxation and Revenue\">{{cite web |url=http://partnerplatform.org/?c158bbx3 |title=Economics Topic Guide Taxation and Revenue |author=Hazel Granger |publisher=EPS PEAKS |year=2013}}</ref> stated that the core purpose of taxation is revenue mobilisation, providing resources for National Budgets, and forming an important part of macroeconomic management. They said [[economic theory]] has focused on the need to 'optimise' the system through balancing efficiency and equity, understanding the impacts on production, and consumption as well as distribution, [[Redistribution (economics)|redistribution]], and [[welfare]].\n\nThey state that taxes and tax reliefs have also been used as a tool for behavioural change, to influence [[investment decisions]], [[labour supply]], [[consumption patterns]], and positive and negative economic spill-overs (externalities), and ultimately, the promotion of economic growth and development. The tax system and its administration also play an important role in state-building and governance, as a principal form of 'social contract' between the state and citizens who can, as taxpayers, exert accountability on the state as a consequence.\n\nThe researchers wrote that domestic revenue forms an important part of a developing country's public financing as it is more stable and predictable than [[Overseas Development Assistance]] and necessary for a country to be self-sufficient. They found that domestic revenue flows are, on average, already much larger than ODA, with aid worth less than 10% of collected taxes in Africa as a whole.\n\nHowever, in a quarter of African countries [[Overseas Development Assistance]] does exceed tax collection,<ref>Africa Economic Outlook 2010, Part 2: Public Resource Mobilisation and Aid in Africa, AfDB/OECD (2010)</ref> with these more likely to be non-resource-rich countries. This suggests countries making most progress replacing aid with tax revenue tend to be those benefiting disproportionately from rising prices of energy and commodities.\n\nThe author<ref name=\"Economics Topic Guide Taxation and Revenue\" /> found tax revenue as a percentage of GDP varying greatly around a global average of 19%.<ref>According to IMF data for 2010, from Revenue Data for IMF Member Countries, as of 2011, (unpublished)</ref> This data also indicates countries with higher GDP tend to have higher tax to GDP ratios, demonstrating that higher income is associated with more than proportionately higher tax revenue. On average, high-income countries have tax revenue as a percentage of GDP of around 22%, compared to 18% in middle-income countries and 14% in low-income countries.\n\nIn high-income countries, the highest tax-to-GDP ratio is in [[Denmark]] at 47% and the lowest is in Kuwait at 0.8%, reflecting low taxes from strong oil revenues. Long-term average performance of tax revenue as a share of GDP in low-income countries has been largely stagnant, although most have shown some improvement in more recent years. On average, resource-rich countries have made the most progress, rising from 10% in the mid-1990s to around 17% in 2008. Non resource rich countries made some progress, with average tax revenues increasing from 10% to 15% over the same period.<ref>IMF FAD (2011), Revenue Mobilization in Developing Countries</ref>\n\nMany low-income countries have a tax-to-GDP ratio of less than 15% which could be due to low tax potential, such as a limited taxable economic activity, or low tax effort due to policy choice, non-compliance, or administrative constraints.\n\nSome low-income countries have relatively high tax-to- GDP ratios due to resource tax revenues (e.g. [[Angola]]) or relatively efficient tax administration (e.g. [[Kenya]], [[Brazil]]) whereas some middle-income countries have lower tax-to-GDP ratios (e.g. [[Malaysia]]) which reflect a more tax-friendly policy choice.\n\nWhile overall tax revenues have remained broadly constant, the global trend shows trade taxes have been declining as a proportion of total revenues(IMF, 2011), with the share of revenue shifting away from border trade taxes towards domestically levied [[sales taxes]] on goods and services. Low-income countries tend to have a higher dependence on trade taxes, and a smaller proportion of income and consumption taxes, when compared to high income countries.<ref>IMF WP/05/112, Tax Revenue and (or?) Trade Liberalization, Thomas Baunsgaard and Michael Keen</ref>\n\nOne indicator of the taxpaying experience was captured in the 'Doing Business' survey,<ref>'Doing Business 2013', World Bank/IFC (2013)</ref> which compares the total tax rate, time spent complying with tax procedures and the number of payments required through the year, across 176 countries. The 'easiest' countries in which to pay taxes are located in the Middle East with the [[UAE]] ranking first, followed by [[Qatar]] and [[Saudi Arabia]], most likely reflecting low tax regimes in those countries. Countries in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] are among the 'hardest' to pay with the [[Central African Republic]], [[Republic of Congo]], [[Guinea]] and [[Chad]] in the bottom 5, reflecting higher total tax rates and a greater administrative burden to comply.\n\n===Key facts===\nThe below facts were compiled by EPS PEAKS researchers:<ref name=\"Economics Topic Guide Taxation and Revenue\" />\n* [[Trade liberalisation]] has led to a decline in trade taxes as a share of total revenues and GDP.<ref name=\"Economics Topic Guide Taxation and Revenue\" /><ref name=\"Revenue Mobilisation in Sub Saharan Africa Challenges from Globalisation I Trade Reform\">{{cite journal |last1=Keen |last2=Mansour |year=2010 |title=Revenue Mobilisation in Sub-Saharan Africa: Challenges from Globalisation I \u2013 Trade Reform |journal=Development Policy Review |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=553\u201371 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-7679.2010.00498.x}}</ref>\n* Resource-rich countries tend to collect more revenue as a share of GDP, but this is more volatile.

Tax revenue is more stable and sustainable than aid.

For this reason, [[geoists]] generally believe that such payment cannot be regarded as a true 'tax', but rather a compensation or [[fee]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.landvaluetax.org/what-is-lvt/ |title=What is LVT? |work=landvaluetax.org}}</ref> This means that while Geoists also regard [[taxation]] as an instrument of [[social justice]], contrary to [[social democrats]] and [[social liberals]] they do not regard it as an instrument of [[redistribution (economics)|redistribution]] but rather a 'predistribution' or simply a correct distribution of [[the commons]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kerr |first=Gavin |title='Predistribution', property-owning democracy and land value taxation' |date=10 March 2015 |journal=Politics, Philosophy and Economics}}</ref>\n\nModern [[geoists]] note that [[land (economics)|land]] in the [[classical economic]] meaning of the word referred to all [[natural resources]], and thus also includes resources such as [[mineral deposits]], [[water bodies]] and the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], to which privileged access also generates [[economic rent]] that must be compensated.

It is used to illustrate the concept of taxable income elasticity (that [[taxable income]] will change in response to changes in the rate of taxation). The curve is constructed by [[thought experiment]]. First, the amount of tax revenue raised at the extreme tax rates of 0% and 100% is considered. It is clear that a 0% tax rate raises no revenue, but the Laffer curve hypothesis is that a 100% tax rate will also generate no revenue because at such a rate there is no longer any incentive for a rational taxpayer to earn any income, thus the revenue raised will be 100% of nothing. If both a 0% rate and 100% rate of taxation generate no revenue, it follows from the [[extreme value theorem]] that there must exist at least one rate in between where tax revenue would be a maximum. The Laffer curve is typically represented as a graph which starts at 0% tax, zero revenue, rises to a maximum rate of revenue raised at an intermediate rate of taxation and then falls again to zero revenue at a 100% tax rate.\n\nOne potential result of the Laffer curve is that increasing tax rates beyond a certain point will become counterproductive for raising further tax revenue. A hypothetical Laffer curve for any given economy can only be estimated and such estimates are sometimes controversial. [[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]] reports that estimates of revenue-maximizing tax rates have varied widely, with a mid-range of around 70%.<ref>{{cite book |title=Laffer curve |first=Don |last=Fullerton |work=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, Second Edition |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2008 |quote=The mid-range for this elasticity is around 0.4, with a revenue peak around 70 per cent. |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_L000015 |accessdate=5 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Optimal===\n{{Main|Optimal tax}}\n\nMost governments take revenue which exceeds that which can be provided by non-distortionary taxes or through taxes which give a double dividend. Optimal taxation theory is the branch of economics that considers how taxes can be structured to give the least deadweight costs, or to give the best outcomes in terms of [[social welfare]]. The [[Ramsey problem]] deals with minimizing deadweight costs. Because deadweight costs are related to the [[elasticity (economics)|elasticity]] of supply and demand for a good, it follows that putting the highest tax rates on the goods for which there is most inelastic supply and demand will result in the least overall deadweight costs. Some economists sought to integrate optimal tax theory with the [[social welfare function]], which is the economic expression of the idea that equality is valuable to a greater or lesser extent. If individuals experience [[diminishing returns]] from income, then the optimum distribution of income for society involves a progressive income tax. [[James Mirrlees|Mirrlees optimal income tax]] is a detailed theoretical model of the optimum progressive income tax along these lines. Over the last years the validity of the theory of optimal taxation was discussed by many political economists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wordsofliberty.net |title=Libertarian & Conservative News |publisher=Words of Liberty |accessdate=22 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122183637/http://wordsofliberty.net/ |archivedate=22 January 2013  }}</ref>\n\n===Rates===\n{{Main|Tax rate}}\nTaxes are most often levied as a percentage, called the ''tax rate''. An important distinction when talking about tax rates is to distinguish between the [[Tax rate#Marginal|marginal rate]] and the [[Tax rate#Effective|effective tax rate]]. The effective rate is the total tax paid divided by the total amount the tax is paid on, while the marginal rate is the rate paid on the next dollar of income earned. For example, if income is taxed on a formula of 5% from $0 up to $50,000, 10% from $50,000 to $100,000, and 15% over $100,000, a [[wikt:taxpayer|taxpayer]] with income of $175,000 would pay a total of $18,750 in taxes.\n\n:Tax calculation\n::(0.05*50,000)&nbsp;+ (0.10*50,000)&nbsp;+ (0.15*75,000) = 18,750\n\n:The \"effective rate\" would be 10.7%:\n::18,750/175,000 = 0.107\n\n:The \"marginal rate\" would be 15%.\n\n==See also==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n* [[Advance tax ruling]]\n* [[Excess burden of taxation]]\n* [[Fiscal capacity]]\n* [[Fiscal incidence]]\n* [[Government budget balance]]\n* [[International taxation]]\n* [[List of taxes]]\n* [[Price ceiling]]\n{{Col-2}}\n* [[Price floor]]\n* [[Revolutionary tax]]\n* [[Tax competition]]\n* [[Tax exporting]]\n* [[Tax haven]]\n* [[Taxpayer receipt]]\n* [[Tax resistance]]\n* [[Tax shelter]]\n{{Col-end}}\n\n===By country or region===\n* [[List of countries by tax rates]]\n* [[List of countries by tax revenue as percentage of GDP]]\n* [[:Category:Taxation by country]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Library resources box\n| by=no\n| onlinebooks=no\n| others=no\n| about=yes\n| label=Tax }}\n* [http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20150216-my-taxes-go-where?ocid=global_bbccom_email_19022015_capital My taxes go where?

Though the bishop is subject to the [[Pope|Roman Pontiff]], he is not the [[vicar]] of the latter: he governs it in his own name. The [[diocese]] takes its name from the [[Episcopal see|see city]], the [[metropolitan area]] where the bishop resides.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong is a ''de jure'' [[suffragan diocese]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Guangzhou|Archdiocese of Guangzhou]].<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/AAS-38-1946-ocr.pdf Apostolic Constitution of 11 April 1946, A.A.S. 1946, 301-313.]</ref> However, in practice it is an immediate subject of the [[Holy See]].

As for education, in 2017 there are 251 Catholic schools and kindergartens, having a total of over 150,000 pupils.\n\n== History ==\nThe organization of what would become the Diocese of Hong Kong began immediately after the establishment of Hong Kong as a [[British colony]].\n\n=== Prefecture Apostolic ===\nIn 1841 Pope [[Gregory XVI]] created a [[Prefecture Apostolic]] comprising \"Hong Kong with the surrounding six [[League (unit)|leagues]]\" independent from the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Macau|Diocese of Macau]], but under the authority of the Bishop of Macau. The initial need for the establishment of the prefecture was the spiritual care of the British (Irish Catholic) soldiers stationed in the newly established colony.\n\n[[Theodore Joset]], a Swiss diocesan priest, became the first Prefect Apostolic.\n\nThe prefecture functioned much as a mission, but was intended from its inception to become a diocese. In the first ten years, the missionaries built churches, schools, a seminary, and institutions for the sick, elderly, and orphans.\n\nFollowing Joset's death in 1842, [[Anthony Feliciani]] became Prefect Apostolic of Hong Kong.\n\nThe foundation stone of the first church was laid in 1842. It was dedicated to the [[Immaculate Conception]] in 1843, enlarged in 1858\u201359, burnt down on 18 October 1859, rebuilt and blessed on 18 March 1860.\n\nIn 1858, the first missionaries, members of the Seminary of Foreign Missions of Milan (now [[PIME]]) arrived; they were designated to take over the administration of the mission in time.\n\nBy 1860, the physical territory had spread well beyond the initial six leagues surrounding Hong Kong to include the [[Bao'an County|San On District]] ({{zh|t=\u65b0\u5b89\u7e23|labels=no}}), the [[Kowloon Peninsula]], [[Sai Kung Peninsula]], and [[Nantou, Shenzhen (historical)|Nam Tau]].\n\n=== Vicariate Apostolic ===\nIn 1874 the Hong Kong Prefecture was raised to a [[Vicariate Apostolic]] and entrusted to the Seminary of Foreign Missions of Milan (now PIME). While the prefecture had been run by missionary priests, a vicariate was the intermediary step before becoming a diocese, and required a bishop to run it. Since the territory was not yet a diocese, the bishops were called \"titular bishop\" of another place (where they had no ecclesiastical authority). The bishops were under the direct authority of the Pope, exercising their power in his name, rather than being vested with the office belonging to a diocese.\n\nThe first Vicar Apostolic was Bishop Giovanni [[Timoleon Raimondi]] (consecrated 22 November 1874), who died at Mission House, [[Glenealy, Hong Kong|Glenealy]], Hong Kong, on 27 September 1894. He was succeeded by Bishops [[Louis Piazzoli]] (born 1849) and [[Dominic Pozzoni]] (born 1851) elected 26 May 1905.\n\nIn 1880, the vicariate hosted the first [[synod]] of the fifth ecclesiastical region of the Catholic Church in China; it hosted a second synod in 1891, and a third in 1909.\n\nIn 1883, the foundation stone of a new cathedral was laid. This is the present [[Immaculate Conception Cathedral of Hong Kong|Immaculate Conception Cathedral]]. It was inaugurated in 1888.\n\nThe vicariate continued to grow. In 1913 it included 12 European and 10 native priests and 14,195 Christians; there were 26 churches, 5 of them with resident priests; 40 schools for boys and 29 schools for girls; 12 [[Brothers of the Christian Schools]]; 35 [[Canossians|Sisters of Canossa]]; 22 [[Sisters of St. Paul of Chartres]]; and 54 native Sisters.\n\nBesides [[Hong Kong Island]], the vicariate included [[Lantau Island]], its adjacent islands and the three continental districts of [[Bao'an County|San-on]] ({{zh|t=\u65b0\u5b89|labels=no}}), Kwei-shing ({{zh|t=\u6b78\u5584|labels=no}}), and Ha\u00ef-fung ({{zh|t=\u6d77\u8c50|labels=no}}). Churches with resident priests were the cathedral (Glenealy), St. Joseph's (Garden Road), St. Francis (Wan Chai), Church of the Sacred Heart (West Point), Church of St. Anthony (West Point). The [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Missions Etrang\u00e8res de Paris]] had a procurator, a sanitorium  ([[B\u00e9thanie (Hong Kong)|B\u00e9thanie]]) and a printing office ([[University Hall (University of Hong Kong)|Nazareth]]) at Hong Kong; there was also a Dominican procurator.\n\nMore missionaries arrived from many orders throughout the 1920s and 1930s, building more churches, schools, and hospitals.\n\nDuring World War II, the Japanese occupation stopped almost all activities. Missionaries evacuated, and were variously interned, released, and expelled. After the war, reconstruction began immediately.\n\n=== Diocese ===\nOn 11 April 1946 [[Pope Pius XII]] established the episcopal hierarchy in China, raising all the [[apostolic vicariate]]s to dioceses, Hong Kong among them. Since then, the Hong Kong Diocese is directly responsible to the pope. [[Enrico Valtorta]] became the first bishop of Hong Kong.\n\nIn 1949 refugees fleeing the Chinese communist regime began to pour into Hong Kong, including many Catholics and clergymen from all over China; diocesan activities were effectively restricted to the boundaries of the Colony. In 1952, the diocese opened seven new chapels for refugees.\n\nIn 1969 Bishop [[Francis Hsu]] became, after the resignation of [[Lorenzo Bianchi]], the first Chinese bishop of Hong Kong.\n\nOn 29 May 1988 [[John Baptist Wu]], the fifth bishop, was named a member of the [[College of Cardinals]] by [[Pope John Paul II]]. He was the first [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] from the Hong Kong diocese.\n\nOn 18 August 1991, an Open Forum on \"Elections 1991\", jointly organized by the Council of Priests, the Justice and Peace Commission, the Central Council of Catholic Laity and the Catholic Institute for Religion and Society, was held in the nine constituencies of Hong Kong, Kowloon and the New Territories in order to encourage the faithful to take an active part in the direct elections to the Legislative Council on 15 September. Church organizations also made a similar appeal to the faithful and ordinary citizens through publications, questionnaires and advertisements in newspapers.\n\nOn 15 April 1993 the diocese was re-divided into nine [[deaneries]]. The Council of Priests was reorganized with all the deans included as ex officio members.\n\nAfter the death of Cardinal Wu on 23 September 2002, his [[coadjutor bishop|coadjutor]] [[Joseph Zen Ze-kiun]] became the 6th bishop of Hong Kong.\n\nOn 8 July 2004 the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] passed the Education (Amendment) Bill. Under the New Ordinance, which would be effective on 1 January 2005, every aided school would be required before 2010 to form an incorporated management committee (IMC) whose members should include elected representatives of teachers, parents of students and alumni, as well as other independent persons, with a view to promoting a school-based management. It was the concern of the Church that, as a sponsoring body, she would no longer be empowered in the future to supervise the schools under her sponsorship, nor be able to achieve her goals and objectives in Catholic education. On 5 June 2005, Bishop Zen announced that, if the Legislative Council passed the donation to support schools to create incorporated management committees on 8 July 2005, he would appeal against the decision to the court. After the Government decided to give up some main argued points, the Diocese decided to support the motion.\n\nOn 22 February 2006 [[Pope Benedict XVI]] announced that Bishop [[Joseph Zen]] would be raised to the College of Cardinals.<ref>{{cite news|title=Benedict XVI Names 15 New Cardinals|url=https://zenit.org/articles/benedict-xvi-names-15-new-cardinals/ |accessdate=22 August 2017|work=Zenit|date=22 February 2006}}</ref> He was made a cardinal at a consistory held on 24 March.<ref>{{cite press release | language =it | publisher = Holy See Press Office | accessdate = 6 June 2018 |url = https://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/2006/documents/ns_lit_doc_20060324_titoli_it.html | date= 24 March 2006| title = Assegnazione dei Titoli e delle Diaconie ai Nouvi Cardinali }}</ref> \nZen was an outspoken supporter of democracy and a staunch critic of the [[People's Republic of China]].

Though the bishop is subject to the [[Pope|Roman Pontiff]], he is not the [[vicar]] of the latter: he governs it in his own name. The [[diocese]] takes its name from the [[Episcopal see|see city]], the [[metropolitan area]] where the bishop resides.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong is a ''de jure'' [[suffragan diocese]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Guangzhou|Archdiocese of Guangzhou]].<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/AAS-38-1946-ocr.pdf Apostolic Constitution of 11 April 1946, A.A.S. 1946, 301-313.]</ref> However, in practice it is an immediate subject of the [[Holy See]]. Also in theory, not only Hong Kong, but also a small part of Guangdong province belongs to the diocese. In practice, however, the diocese only comprises the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.\n\nThere were about 384,000 local [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] as of August 2015, and 160,000 [[Filipino people|Filipino]] Catholics in Hong Kong.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://catholic.org.hk/v2/b5/cdhk/a08statistics.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120713054427/http://catholic.org.hk/v2/b5/cdhk/a08statistics.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-07-13|title=\u9999\u6e2f\u6559\u5340\u6559\u52d9\u7d71\u8a08 - \u5929\u4e3b\u6559\u9999\u6e2f\u6559\u5340|website=catholic.org.hk|access-date=2017-06-26}}</ref> They are served by 223 [[priest]]s, 26 [[deacon]]s, 68 [[Brother (Christian)|brothers]] and 474 [[Nun|sisters]].<ref name=\":0\" /> There are 51 [[parish]]es, comprising 40 [[Church (building)|church]]es, 31 [[chapel]]s and 26 [[hall]]s for religious service. As for education, in 2017 there are 251 Catholic schools and kindergartens, having a total of over 150,000 pupils.\n\n== History ==\nThe organization of what would become the Diocese of Hong Kong began immediately after the establishment of Hong Kong as a [[British colony]].\n\n=== Prefecture Apostolic ===\nIn 1841 Pope [[Gregory XVI]] created a [[Prefecture Apostolic]] comprising \"Hong Kong with the surrounding six [[League (unit)|leagues]]\" independent from the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Macau|Diocese of Macau]], but under the authority of the Bishop of Macau. The initial need for the establishment of the prefecture was the spiritual care of the British (Irish Catholic) soldiers stationed in the newly established colony.\n\n[[Theodore Joset]], a Swiss diocesan priest, became the first Prefect Apostolic.\n\nThe prefecture functioned much as a mission, but was intended from its inception to become a diocese. In the first ten years, the missionaries built churches, schools, a seminary, and institutions for the sick, elderly, and orphans.\n\nFollowing Joset's death in 1842, [[Anthony Feliciani]] became Prefect Apostolic of Hong Kong.\n\nThe foundation stone of the first church was laid in 1842. It was dedicated to the [[Immaculate Conception]] in 1843, enlarged in 1858\u201359, burnt down on 18 October 1859, rebuilt and blessed on 18 March 1860.\n\nIn 1858, the first missionaries, members of the Seminary of Foreign Missions of Milan (now [[PIME]]) arrived; they were designated to take over the administration of the mission in time.\n\nBy 1860, the physical territory had spread well beyond the initial six leagues surrounding Hong Kong to include the [[Bao'an County|San On District]] ({{zh|t=\u65b0\u5b89\u7e23|labels=no}}), the [[Kowloon Peninsula]], [[Sai Kung Peninsula]], and [[Nantou, Shenzhen (historical)|Nam Tau]].\n\n=== Vicariate Apostolic ===\nIn 1874 the Hong Kong Prefecture was raised to a [[Vicariate Apostolic]], and entrusted to the Seminary of Foreign Missions of Milan (now PIME). While the prefecture had been run by missionary priests, a vicariate was the intermediary step before becoming a diocese, and required a bishop to run it. Since the territory was not yet a diocese, the bishops were called \"titular bishop\" of another place (where they had no ecclesiastical authority). The bishops were under the direct authority of the Pope, exercising their power in his name, rather than being vested with the office belonging to a diocese.\n\nThe first Vicar Apostolic was Bishop Giovanni [[Timoleon Raimondi]] (consecrated 22 November 1874), who died at Mission House, [[Glenealy, Hong Kong|Glenealy]], Hong Kong, on 27 September 1894. He was succeeded by Bishops [[Louis Piazzoli]] (born 1849), and [[Dominic Pozzoni]] (born 1851), elected 26 May 1905.\n\nIn 1880, the vicariate hosted the first [[synod]] of the fifth ecclesiastical region of the Catholic Church in China; it hosted a second synod in 1891, and a third in 1909.\n\nIn 1883, the foundation stone of a new cathedral was laid. This is the present [[Immaculate Conception Cathedral of Hong Kong|Immaculate Conception Cathedral]]. It was inaugurated in 1888.\n\nThe vicariate continued to grow. In 1913 it included 12 European and 10 native priests and 14,195 Christians; there were 26 churches, 5 of them with resident priests; 40 schools for boys and 29 schools for girls; 12 [[Brothers of the Christian Schools]]; 35 [[Canossians|Sisters of Canossa]]; 22 [[Sisters of St. Paul of Chartres]]; and 54 native Sisters.\n\nBesides [[Hong Kong Island]], the vicariate included [[Lantau Island]], its adjacent islands and the three continental districts of [[Bao'an County|San-on]] ({{zh|t=\u65b0\u5b89|labels=no}}), Kwei-shing ({{zh|t=\u6b78\u5584|labels=no}}), and Ha\u00ef-fung ({{zh|t=\u6d77\u8c50|labels=no}}). Churches with resident priests were the cathedral (Glenealy), St. Joseph's (Garden Road), St. Francis (Wan Chai), Church of the Sacred Heart (West Point), Church of St. Anthony (West Point). The [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Missions Etrang\u00e8res de Paris]] had a procurator, a sanitorium  ([[B\u00e9thanie (Hong Kong)|B\u00e9thanie]]) and a printing office ([[University Hall (University of Hong Kong)|Nazareth]]) at Hong Kong; there was also a Dominican procurator.\n\nMore missionaries arrived from many orders throughout the 1920s and 1930s, building more churches, schools, and hospitals.\n\nDuring World War II, the Japanese occupation stopped almost all activities. Missionaries evacuated, and were variously interned, released, and expelled. After the war, reconstruction began immediately.\n\n=== Diocese ===\nOn 11 April 1946 [[Pope Pius XII]] established the episcopal hierarchy in China, raising all the [[apostolic vicariate]]s to dioceses, Hong Kong among them. Since then, the Hong Kong Diocese is directly responsible to the pope. [[Enrico Valtorta]] became the first bishop of Hong Kong.\n\nIn 1949 refugees fleeing the Chinese communist regime began to pour into Hong Kong, including many Catholics and clergymen from all over China; diocesan activities were effectively restricted to the boundaries of the Colony. In 1952, the diocese opened seven new chapels for refugees.\n\nIn 1969 Bishop [[Francis Hsu]] became, after the resignation of [[Lorenzo Bianchi]], the first Chinese bishop of Hong Kong.\n\nOn 29 May 1988 [[John Baptist Wu]], the fifth bishop, was named a member of the [[College of Cardinals]] by [[Pope John Paul II]]. He was the first [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] from the Hong Kong diocese.\n\nOn 18 August 1991, an Open Forum on \"Elections 1991,\" jointly organized by the Council of Priests, the Justice and Peace Commission, the Central Council of Catholic Laity and the Catholic Institute for Religion and Society, was held in the nine constituencies of Hong Kong, Kowloon and the New Territories in order to encourage the faithful to take an active part in the direct elections to the Legislative Council on 15 September. Church organizations also made a similar appeal to the faithful and ordinary citizens through publications, questionnaires and advertisements in newspapers.\n\nOn 15 April 1993 the diocese was re-divided into nine [[deaneries]]. The Council of Priests was reorganized with all the deans included as ex officio members.\n\nAfter the death of Cardinal Wu on 23 September 2002, his [[coadjutor bishop|coadjutor]] [[Joseph Zen Ze-kiun]] became the 6th bishop of Hong Kong.\n\nOn 8 July 2004 the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] passed the Education (Amendment) Bill. Under the New Ordinance, which would be effective on 1 January 2005, every aided school would be required before 2010 to form an incorporated management committee (IMC) whose members should include elected representatives of teachers, parents of students and alumni, as well as other independent persons, with a view to promoting a school-based management. It was the concern of the Church that, as a sponsoring body, she would no longer be empowered in the future to supervise the schools under her sponsorship, nor be able to achieve her goals and objectives in Catholic education. On 5 June 2005, Bishop Zen announced that, if the Legislative Council pass the donation to support schools to create incorporated management committees on 8 July 2005, he would appeal against the decision to the court. After the Government decided to give up some main argued points, the Diocese decided to support the motion.\n\nOn 22 February 2006 [[Pope Benedict XVI]] announced that Bishop [[Joseph Zen]] would be raised to the College of Cardinals.<ref>{{cite news|title=Benedict XVI Names 15 New Cardinals|url=https://zenit.org/articles/benedict-xvi-names-15-new-cardinals/ |accessdate=22 August 2017|work=Zenit|date=22 February 2006}}</ref> He was made a cardinal at a consistory held on 24 March.<ref>{{cite press release | language =it | publisher = Holy See Press Office | accessdate = 6 June 2018 |url = https://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/2006/documents/ns_lit_doc_20060324_titoli_it.html | date= 24 March 2006| title = Assegnazione dei Titoli e delle Diaconie ai Nouvi Cardinali }}</ref> \nZen was an outspoken supporter of democracy and a staunch critic of the [[People's Republic of China]].

A [[North American University]] survey shows that the evolution of the disease in the country is slower than that observed elsewhere. Brazil took longer to go from 100 to 1,000 cases of COVID-19 than countries like Italy and Spain. The data used were compiled by the American university Johns Hopkins. The country passed 100 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus on March 13th. That day, 151 cases were recorded. Eight days later, on March 21, Brazil reached the 1,000th positive test and reached 1,021 people with the disease. In Italy, this movement took place between February 23rd and 29th (six days); in Spain, between March 2 and 9 (seven days). This means, in the assessment of a statistical expert in epidemiology, Antonio Ponce de Leon, that the rate of infections in Brazil is slower. Italy and Spain are the European countries most affected by the virus. The first recorded, March 22nd, more than 59,000 cases and 5,400 deaths. Spain had 28,700 patients with 1,700 deaths.
