The origin of the name comes from Mu'min (\u0645\u0624\u0645\u0646, \"believer\" in Arabic) and later evolved to present name Memon.[3] The Memon community was founded in the 15th century by 700 families comprising 6,178 persons total.[4] According to Anthovan, those Lohanas of Thatta who converted to Islam became Memons and were invited by Rao Khengarji Jadeja, ruler of Bhuj in the 16th century, to settle in Bhuj. It is from there that Kutchi Memons migrated to Kathiawar and mainland Gujarat. Surat in Gujarat was an important trading centre from 1580 to 1680 and Memons made their bounty there.[5] Memons became significantly affluent as a result of trading in Surat.[6]\n\n=== Merchant tradesman ===\n[[File:Mehmans (9727923226).jpg|thumb|upright=1|Memon men, from ''Photographs of Western India Series 1855-1862'']]\nDue to the mercantile nature of the community, Memons began a significant migration beyond the borders of India in the 18th and 19th centuries.

RHDVa (also referred to as RHDV, RHDV1, or as classical RHD) only affects adult European rabbits (''Oryctolagus cuniculus''). This virus was first reported in China in 1984,<ref name=Liu1984>{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=S.J. |last2=Xue |first2=H.P. |last3=Pu |first3=B.Q. |last4=Qian |first4=N.H. |title=A new viral disease in rabbits |journal=Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine (Xumu yu Shouyi) |date=1984 |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=253-255}}</ref> from which it spread to much of Asia, Europe, Australia, and elsewhere. There have been a few isolated outbreaks of RHDVa in the United States and Mexico, but they remained localized and were eradicated.\n\nIn 2010, a new lagovirus with a distinct antigenic profile was identified in France. This virus also caused rabbit hemorrhagic disease but behaved differently from RHDVa in that it affected vaccinated and young European rabbits as well as hares ''(Lepus spp.)''.<ref name=Capucci2017 /> All these features strongly suggested that the virus was not derived from RHDVa but from some other unknown source.<ref name=Capucci2017 />  The new virus was named rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (abbreviated as RHDV-2 or RHDVb). RHDV-2 is distinct enough from RHDVa that the two require different vaccines, which are only partially cross protective. RHDV-2 has since spread to the majority of Europe as well as to Australia, Canada, and the United States.\n\n==Epidemiology & Transmission==\n\nBoth viruses causing RHD are extremely contagious. Transmission occurs by direct contact with infected animals, carcasses, bodily fluids (urine, feces, respiratory secretions), and hair.  Contaminated fomites such as clothing, food, cages, bedding, feeders and water also spread the virus. Flies, fleas, and mosquitoes can carry the virus between rabbits.<ref name=IAS/> Caliciviruses are highly resistant in the environment, and can survive freezing for prolonged periods. Virus can persist in infected meat for months, and for prolonged periods in decomposing carcasses. Importation of rabbit meat may be a major contributor in the spread of the virus to new geographic regions.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> \n\nClimate appears to play a role in the transmission of RHD. Most outbreaks of RHD occur in winter or spring, and higher temperatures in late spring and summer considerably reduce the spread of the virus. RHD is also more prevalent in dry and semi-dry areas than in areas that are relatively cool and humid.<ref name=strive/>\n\nThere is generally high host specificity among lagoviruses.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> Classic RHDVa only affects European rabbits, a species native to Europe and from which the domestic rabbit is descended. The new variant RHDV-2 affects European rabbits as well but also causes fatal RHD in various ''Lepus'' species, including Sardinian Cape hares ''(Lepus capensis mediterraneus)'', Italian hares ''(Lepus corsicanus)'' and mountain hares ''(Lepus timidus)''.\n<ref name=Rocchi2018 /> Reports of RHD in ''Sylvilagus'' species have been coming from the current outbreak in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |title=Southwest US faces lethal rabbit disease outbreak |url=https://news.vin.com/default.aspx?pid=210&Id=9597414 |website=Veterinary Information Network |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nRHD caused by classic RHDVa demonstrates high morbidity (up to 100%) and mortality (70-90%) in adult European rabbits. Young rabbits that are 6-8 weeks old are less likely to be infected, and kits younger than 4 weeks old do not become ill.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> The more recently emerged RHDV-2 causes death and disease in rabbits as young as 15 to 20 days old. Mortality rates from RHDV-2 were initially only 20-30%, but over time the virulence of the strain has been increasing and is now similar to that found with RHDVa. Deaths from RHDV-2 have been confirmed in rabbits previously vaccinated against RHDVa.<ref name=Gleeson2020 />\n\n== Clinical Signs ==\nRHD primarily infects only adult rabbits. In fact, research has shown that rabbits younger than 8 weeks of age are resistant to the virus. The incubation period for the RHD virus is between 1 and 3 days, with death following 1 to 2 days after the infection. There is a wide range of RHD symptoms. Most rabbits will show no signs of external symptoms of RHD.\n\nSymptomatic cases of RHD will display fever, squeals, and often coma leading to death within 12 to 36 hours. In less severe cases, rabbits may display uneasiness, excitement, [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], swollen eyelids, [[paralysis]], ocular [[haemorrhage]]s, and \"paddling\" or loss of skin. Convulsions may be seen as well. A fatal bloody discharge from the nose has been exhibited along with blood-stained cage floors, though these symptoms may have occurred after death. Rabbits who have recovered from the less severe symptoms usually develop severe [[jaundice]] with weight loss and [[lethargy]]. Diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal cramping are then exhibited right before death a few weeks later.<ref>?</ref>\n\nRHD causes rapid development of [[blood clot]] formation in major organs such as the heart, lungs and kidneys. The clots block blood vessels causing heart and respiratory failure. An infected rabbit that has died from RHD will often have its legs straight out and head over its neck.<ref name=strive/>\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nRHD may be indicated when several animals in the herd die after experiencing a fever and lethargy. [[Differential diagnosis]] includes [[pasteurellosis]], [[myxomatosis]], poisoning, heat exhaustion, and ''[[E. coli]]'' or ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'' type E [[enterotoxemia]].\n\nRabbits that die from RHD are usually in good outward state. However, the most frequent post-mortem lesions are [[necrosis]] of the [[liver]], and [[splenomegaly]]. The liver of RHD rabbits may have a fine reticular pattern of necrosis outline each lobule and maybe yellow, gray or pale in colour. The liver is also usually [[friable]] and swollen. The spleen will be black in colour and also swollen with rounded edges, while the kidneys are dark brown in colour. [[Haemorrhages]] will also be seen many other organs and tissues. The trachea may present a foamy, bloody mucous. [[Enteritis]] of the small intestine and swollen [[meninges]] may also occur.\n\nLaboratory tests such as [[reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] (RT-PCR), [[Western blotting]], negative-staining immunoelectron microscopy, and [[ELISA]]s may be performed on samples from the liver, blood, spleen or other organs.\n\n== Morbidity, mortality, and immunity ==\nRHD is extremely hard to locate in the wild since about 75% of rabbits with RHD will die in their burrows underground. Due to this difficulty, the [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] estimates for RHD have a broad range. The morbidity rate ranges from 30% to 100% and the mortality rate from 40% to 100%; however, the typical mortality rate is usually around 90%.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nMaternal antibodies such as [[immunoglobulin G]] (IgG), which are readily transmitted to the young across the placenta, may explain why very young rabbits are resistant to RHD. Some scientists also believe that the immature immune system of a young rabbit cannot produce the number of chemicals needed to initiate clotting in order to kill. Rabbits may develop immunity against other strains of the RHD virus, while others may endure persistent infections. The immunity does not survive through the next generation, leaving open the possibility of further outbreaks in the population.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marques|first1=Raquel M|last2=Teixeira|first2=Luzia|last3=\u00c1guas|first3=Artur P|last4=Ribeiro|first4=Joana C|last5=Costa-e-Silva|first5=Ant\u00f3nio|last6=Ferreira|first6=Paula G|title=Immunosuppression abrogates resistance of young rabbits to Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD)|journal=Veterinary Research|date=4 February 2014|volume=45|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1297-9716-45-14|pmc=3926702|pmid=24490832|pages=14}}</ref>\n\n== Prevention & Control ==\nCountries that are uninfected by RHD may place restrictions on importation from endemic countries. According to the [[Merck & Co.|Merck]]/[[Merial]] Manual For Pet Health, Home Edition, 2007, RHD is a reportable disease in the United States. If a diagnosis is made by a veterinarian, a notification to the \"appropriate government authorities\" must be made.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nBecause of the highly infectious nature of the disease, strict quarantine is necessary when outbreaks occur. Depopulation, disinfection, surveillance and quarantines are the only way to properly and effectively eradicate the disease. Good disinfectants include 10% [[sodium hydroxide]], 1-2% [[formalin]], 2% One-Stroke Environ, and 10% household [[bleach]]. The RHD virus is resistant to [[ethers]] and [[chloroform]]. Deceased rabbits must be removed immediately and discarded in a safe manner. Surviving rabbits are quarantined or humanely euthanized. Test rabbits may be used to monitor the virus on vaccinated farms.<ref name=\"IAS\" />\n\nThere are several vaccines available against VHD in the UK: Cylap, made by Fort Dodge Animal Health; Lapinject, made by CEVA Animal Health; Anivac, made by Animalcare Ltd and FILAVAC, made by Filavie. All last for 12 months and contain inactivated strains of VHD. A live combination vaccine, Nobivac Myxo-RHD, made by MSD Animal Health, has recently become available.

The virus has since appeared in Mexico, [[Cuba]], Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Canada.<ref name=Merck/> In 1992, the United Kingdom reported its first case of RHDVa in domestic show rabbits. By the late 1990s, RHDVa stretched to forty countries and had become [[endemic]] in [[Wild animal|wild]] and [[feral]] rabbit populations in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and [[Cuba]].<ref name=IAS/> In Europe, there was a rapid increase in research into RHD, due to the importance of the commercial breeding of rabbits for meat and fur production.\n\nThe first reported case of RHDVa in the United States was in Iowa on March 9, 2000. The affected breeds included [[List of rabbit breeds|Palominos]] and [[Californian rabbit|California Whites]]. By April 6, 25 of the 27 affected rabbits had died of the infection. In order to contain the disease, the remaining two rabbits were euthanized. No new introductions of rabbits were placed on the farm for two years after the discovery of RHDVa and August 1999 was the last time rabbits left and/or returned to the farm. The United States experienced other outbreaks of RHDVa in 2001 ([[Utah]], [[Illinois]], [[New York (state)|New York]]) and 2005 ([[Indiana]]).<ref name=IAS/>\n\nIn 2010, a new virus variant called rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV-2) emerged in France.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Le Gall-Recul\u00e9|first=Ghislaine|last2=Lavazza|first2=Antonio|last3=Marchandeau|first3=St\u00e9phane|last4=Bertagnoli|first4=St\u00e9phane|last5=Zwingelstein|first5=Fran\u00e7oise|last6=Cavadini|first6=Patrizia|last7=Martinelli|first7=Nicola|last8=Lombardi|first8=Guerino|last9=Gu\u00e9rin|first9=Jean-Luc|date=2013-09-08|title=Emergence of a new lagovirus related to rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus|journal=Veterinary Research|language=En|volume=44|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1297-9716-44-81|pmc=3848706|pmid=24011218|pages=81}}</ref> RHDV-2 has since spread from France to the rest of Europe, Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand.

However, in late August it was confirmed that RHDVa had been deliberately and illegally introduced to the [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]] area of the [[South Island]].

It was, however, being intentionally spread, and several farmers (notably in the [[Mackenzie Basin]] area) admitted to processing rabbits that had died from the disease in kitchen blenders for further spreading.\n\nHad the disease been introduced at a better time, there would have been a more effective control of the population. However, it was released after breeding had commenced for the season, and rabbits under 2 weeks old at the time of the introduction were resistant to the disease.

RHDVa (also referred to as RHDV, RHDV1, or as classical RHD) only affects adult European rabbits (''Oryctolagus cuniculus''). This virus was first reported in China in 1984,<ref name=Liu1984>{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=S.J. |last2=Xue |first2=H.P. |last3=Pu |first3=B.Q. |last4=Qian |first4=N.H. |title=A new viral disease in rabbits |journal=Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine (Xumu yu Shouyi) |date=1984 |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=253-255}}</ref> from which it spread to much of Asia, Europe, Australia, and elsewhere. There have been a few isolated outbreaks of RHDVa in the United States and Mexico, but they remained localized and were eradicated.\n\nIn 2010, a new lagovirus with a distinct antigenic profile was identified in France. This virus also caused rabbit hemorrhagic disease but behaved differently from RHDVa in that it affected vaccinated and young European rabbits as well as hares ''(Lepus spp.)''.<ref name=Capucci2017 /> All these features strongly suggested that the virus was not derived from RHDVa but from some other unknown source.<ref name=Capucci2017 />  The new virus was named rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (abbreviated as RHDV-2 or RHDVb). RHDV-2 is distinct enough from RHDVa that the two require different vaccines, which are only partially cross protective. RHDV-2 has since spread to the majority of Europe as well as to Australia, Canada, and the United States.\n\n==Epidemiology & Transmission==\n\nBoth viruses causing RHD are extremely contagious. Transmission occurs by direct contact with infected animals, carcasses, bodily fluids (urine, feces, respiratory secretions), and hair.  Contaminated fomites such as clothing, food, cages, bedding, feeders and water also spread the virus. Flies, fleas, and mosquitoes can carry the virus between rabbits.<ref name=IAS/> Caliciviruses are highly resistant in the environment, and can survive freezing for prolonged periods. Virus can persist in infected meat for months, and for prolonged periods in decomposing carcasses. Importation of rabbit meat may be a major contributor in the spread of the virus to new geographic regions.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> \n\nClimate appears to play a role in the transmission of RHD. Most outbreaks of RHD occur in winter or spring, and higher temperatures in late spring and summer considerably reduce the spread of the virus. RHD is also more prevalent in dry and semi-dry areas than in areas that are relatively cool and humid.<ref name=strive/>\n\nThere is generally high host specificity among lagoviruses.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> Classic RHDVa only affects European rabbits, a species native to Europe and from which the domestic rabbit is descended. The new variant RHDV-2 affects European rabbits as well but also causes fatal RHD in various ''Lepus'' species, including Sardinian Cape hares ''(Lepus capensis mediterraneus)'', Italian hares ''(Lepus corsicanus)'' and mountain hares ''(Lepus timidus)''.\n<ref name=Rocchi2018 /> Reports of RHD in ''Sylvilagus'' species have been coming from the current outbreak in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |title=Southwest US faces lethal rabbit disease outbreak |url=https://news.vin.com/default.aspx?pid=210&Id=9597414 |website=Veterinary Information Network |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nRHD caused by classic RHDVa demonstrates high morbidity (up to 100%) and mortality (70-90%) in adult European rabbits. Young rabbits that are 6-8 weeks old are less likely to be infected, and kits younger than 4 weeks old do not become ill.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> The more recently emerged RHDV-2 causes death and disease in rabbits as young as 15 to 20 days old. Mortality rates from RHDV-2 were initially only 20-30%, but over time the virulence of the strain has been increasing and is now similar to that found with RHDVa. Deaths from RHDV-2 have been confirmed in rabbits previously vaccinated against RHDVa.<ref name=Gleeson2020 />\n\n== Clinical Signs ==\nRHD primarily infects only adult rabbits. In fact, research has shown that rabbits younger than 8 weeks of age are resistant to the virus. The incubation period for the RHD virus is between 1 and 3 days, with death following 1 to 2 days after the infection. There is a wide range of RHD symptoms. Most rabbits will show no signs of external symptoms of RHD.\n\nSymptomatic cases of RHD will display fever, squeals, and often coma leading to death within 12 to 36 hours. In less severe cases, rabbits may display uneasiness, excitement, [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], swollen eyelids, [[paralysis]], ocular [[haemorrhage]]s, and \"paddling\" or loss of skin. Convulsions may be seen as well. A fatal bloody discharge from the nose has been exhibited along with blood-stained cage floors, though these symptoms may have occurred after death. Rabbits who have recovered from the less severe symptoms usually develop severe [[jaundice]] with weight loss and [[lethargy]]. Diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal cramping are then exhibited right before death a few weeks later.<ref>?</ref>\n\nRHD causes rapid development of [[blood clot]] formation in major organs such as the heart, lungs and kidneys. The clots block blood vessels causing heart and respiratory failure. An infected rabbit that has died from RHD will often have its legs straight out and head over its neck.<ref name=strive/>\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nRHD may be indicated when several animals in the herd die after experiencing a fever and lethargy. [[Differential diagnosis]] includes [[pasteurellosis]], [[myxomatosis]], poisoning, heat exhaustion, and ''[[E. coli]]'' or ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'' type E [[enterotoxemia]].\n\nRabbits that die from RHD are usually in good outward state. However, the most frequent post-mortem lesions are [[necrosis]] of the [[liver]], and [[splenomegaly]]. The liver of RHD rabbits may have a fine reticular pattern of necrosis outline each lobule and maybe yellow, gray or pale in colour. The liver is also usually [[friable]] and swollen. The spleen will be black in colour and also swollen with rounded edges, while the kidneys are dark brown in colour. [[Haemorrhages]] will also be seen many other organs and tissues. The trachea may present a foamy, bloody mucous. [[Enteritis]] of the small intestine and swollen [[meninges]] may also occur.\n\nLaboratory tests such as [[reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] (RT-PCR), [[Western blotting]], negative-staining immunoelectron microscopy, and [[ELISA]]s may be performed on samples from the liver, blood, spleen or other organs.\n\n== Morbidity, mortality, and immunity ==\nRHD is extremely hard to locate in the wild since about 75% of rabbits with RHD will die in their burrows underground. Due to this difficulty, the [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] estimates for RHD have a broad range. The morbidity rate ranges from 30% to 100% and the mortality rate from 40% to 100%; however, the typical mortality rate is usually around 90%.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nMaternal antibodies such as [[immunoglobulin G]] (IgG), which are readily transmitted to the young across the placenta, may explain why very young rabbits are resistant to RHD. Some scientists also believe that the immature immune system of a young rabbit cannot produce the number of chemicals needed to initiate clotting in order to kill. Rabbits may develop immunity against other strains of the RHD virus, while others may endure persistent infections. The immunity does not survive through the next generation, leaving open the possibility of further outbreaks in the population.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marques|first1=Raquel M|last2=Teixeira|first2=Luzia|last3=\u00c1guas|first3=Artur P|last4=Ribeiro|first4=Joana C|last5=Costa-e-Silva|first5=Ant\u00f3nio|last6=Ferreira|first6=Paula G|title=Immunosuppression abrogates resistance of young rabbits to Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD)|journal=Veterinary Research|date=4 February 2014|volume=45|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1297-9716-45-14|pmc=3926702|pmid=24490832|pages=14}}</ref>\n\n== Prevention & Control ==\nCountries that are uninfected by RHD may place restrictions on importation from endemic countries. According to the [[Merck & Co.|Merck]]/[[Merial]] Manual For Pet Health, Home Edition, 2007, RHD is a reportable disease in the United States. If a diagnosis is made by a veterinarian, a notification to the \"appropriate government authorities\" must be made.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nBecause of the highly infectious nature of the disease, strict quarantine is necessary when outbreaks occur. Depopulation, disinfection, surveillance and quarantines are the only way to properly and effectively eradicate the disease. Good disinfectants include 10% [[sodium hydroxide]], 1-2% [[formalin]], 2% One-Stroke Environ, and 10% household [[bleach]]. The RHD virus is resistant to [[ethers]] and [[chloroform]]. Deceased rabbits must be removed immediately and discarded in a safe manner. Surviving rabbits are quarantined or humanely euthanized. Test rabbits may be used to monitor the virus on vaccinated farms.<ref name=\"IAS\" />\n\nThere are several vaccines available against VHD in the UK: Cylap, made by Fort Dodge Animal Health; Lapinject, made by CEVA Animal Health; Anivac, made by Animalcare Ltd and FILAVAC, made by Filavie.

The affected breeds included [[List of rabbit breeds|Palominos]] and [[Californian rabbit|California Whites]]. By April 6, 25 of the 27 affected rabbits had died of the infection. In order to contain the disease, the remaining two rabbits were euthanized. No new introductions of rabbits were placed on the farm for two years after the discovery of RHDVa and August 1999 was the last time rabbits left and/or returned to the farm. The United States experienced other outbreaks of RHDVa in 2001 ([[Utah]], [[Illinois]], [[New York (state)|New York]]) and 2005 ([[Indiana]]).<ref name=IAS/>\n\nIn 2010, a new virus variant called rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV-2) emerged in France.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Le Gall-Recul\u00e9|first=Ghislaine|last2=Lavazza|first2=Antonio|last3=Marchandeau|first3=St\u00e9phane|last4=Bertagnoli|first4=St\u00e9phane|last5=Zwingelstein|first5=Fran\u00e7oise|last6=Cavadini|first6=Patrizia|last7=Martinelli|first7=Nicola|last8=Lombardi|first8=Guerino|last9=Gu\u00e9rin|first9=Jean-Luc|date=2013-09-08|title=Emergence of a new lagovirus related to rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus|journal=Veterinary Research|language=En|volume=44|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1297-9716-44-81|pmc=3848706|pmid=24011218|pages=81}}</ref> RHDV-2 has since spread from France to the rest of Europe, Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand.

This was backed up in an early August review of the decision by the Director-General of Agriculture. However, in late August it was confirmed that RHDVa had been deliberately and illegally introduced to the [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]] area of the [[South Island]]. An unsuccessful attempt was made by New Zealand officials to control the spread of the disease. It was, however, being intentionally spread, and several farmers (notably in the [[Mackenzie Basin]] area) admitted to processing rabbits that had died from the disease in kitchen blenders for further spreading.\n\nHad the disease been introduced at a better time, there would have been a more effective control of the population. However, it was released after breeding had commenced for the season, and rabbits under 2 weeks old at the time of the introduction were resistant to the disease. These young rabbits were therefore able to survive and breed rabbit numbers back up. Ten years on, rabbit populations (in the [[Mackenzie Basin]] in particular) are beginning to reach near pre-plague proportions once again though they have not yet returned to pre RCD levels.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Munro|editor1-first=Robert K. |editor2-last=Williams|editor2-first=Richard T. |title=Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease: Issues in Assessment for biological control |date=1994 |publisher=Bureau of Resource Sciences |location=Canberra |isbn=9780644335126}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Plan for 1080 drops in MacKenzie Basin |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/2441711/Mackenzie-1080-drop-plan |last=Williams |first=David |date=26 May 2009 |newspaper= The Press |accessdate = 2009-06-14}}</ref>\n\nResistance to RHD in New Zealand rabbits has led to the widespread use of [[1080 usage in New Zealand|Compound 1080 (Sodium fluoroacetate)]].

His core research is in the area of crowd psychology. \n[[File:Professor_John_Drury.jpg|thumb|Professor John Drury]]\n\n==Early career==\n\nDrury completed his undergraduate degree in social psychology at the University of Sussex (1992). He went on to complete his MSc (1993) and PhD (1996) in Psychology at the [[University of Exeter]], under the supervision of Professor Steve Reicher. On completing his PhD, Drury worked as a Research Psychologist at the Trust for the Study of Adolescence (later known as ''Young People in Focus'') from 1996 to 1998, providing research-based evidence about communication between young people and adults. He joined the faculty at the University of Sussex in 1998, where he continued his research in crowd behaviour.\n\n==Research in crowd behaviour==\n\nThe core of Drury's research is on the processes of crowd conflict and psychological change in relation to direct action events. This research stems from, and contributed to the development of, the [[social identity]] tradition. His work includes research on the processes of crowd conflict and change in relation to anti-[[poll tax protests]], anti-roads direct actions, anti-capitalist events, and football crowds. Along with his colleagues, Professor [[Steve Reicher]] and Dr Clifford Stott, Drury identified causes of conflict within crowd events, and how these conflicts can escalate into riots. This research expanded on the social identity theory and Reicher's Social Identity Model,<ref>Reicher, S. D. (1984). The St. Pauls riot: An explanation of the limits of crowd action in terms of a social identity model. ''European Journal of Social Psychology'', 14, 1\u201321.</ref> and led to the Elaborated Social Identity Model (ESIM).<ref>Drury, J., Reicher, S. & Stott, C. (2003) Transforming the boundaries of collective identity: From the \u2018local\u2019 anti-road campaign to \u2018global\u2019 resistance? ''Social Movement Studies'', 2, 191\u2013212.</ref> The ESIM challenges the traditional notion of the crowd as being inherently violent and irrational, and suggests that people in a crowd act in relation to their shared social identity.\n\nMore recently, Drury\u2019s research has examined how participants may feel empowered through crowd experiences, and how such positive emotions might affect other areas of their lives. A large-scale interview study led by Drury found that the act of protesting itself can be good for you,<ref>http://www.sussex.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressrelease/media/media270.html</ref> due to the feelings of encouragement and confidence emerging from experiences of collective action. The main factors contributing to the sense of empowerment included the realisation of the collective identity and shared expectations of mutual support.\n\n==From crowd events to mass emergency behaviour==\n\nDrury also has research interests in the psychology of mass emergency behaviour (MEB). Early models of MEB suggested that in situations of collective threat, the generic reaction from people is one of mass panic. However, in the research literature there are many examples of rational behaviour when escaping threatening and dangerous situations, for example co-operation and helping behaviours. Drury\u2019s research study carried out in the aftermath of the London bombings of show of 7 July 2005ed that rather than panicking or acting selfishly, the majority of survivors acted with courtesy and respect towards their fellow survivors,<ref>http://www.sussex.ac.uk/affiliates/panic/IJMED%20Drury%20et%20al.%202009.pdf</ref> and in many cases also acted as the first responders to an emergency.\n\n==Discourses of crowd events==\n\nPathologizing and/or criminalising crowds (particularly working class crowds, protest crowds and mass emergency crowds) are commonplace, and such constructions impact on policy and practice. In his research, Drury has sought to problematise these dominant accounts of the crowd, and suggest a language for the crowd that recognises and celebrates its positive role in the social world. To a certain extent, power is sustained through systems of meaning, and so Drury uses critical discourse analysis to understand, expose and subvert dominant discourses, therefore creating the space for \u2018liberatory\u2019 discourses.\n\n== Key publications ==\n\n'''Journal articles'''\n\n*Barr, D., & Drury, J.

However, in the research literature there are many examples of rational behaviour when escaping threatening and dangerous situations, for example co-operation and helping behaviours. Drury\u2019s research study carried out in the aftermath of the London bombings of show of 7 July 2005ed that rather than panicking or acting selfishly, the majority of survivors acted with courtesy and respect towards their fellow survivors,<ref>http://www.sussex.ac.uk/affiliates/panic/IJMED%20Drury%20et%20al.%202009.pdf</ref> and in many cases also acted as the first responders to an emergency.\n\n==Discourses of crowd events==\n\nPathologizing and/or criminalising crowds (particularly working class crowds, protest crowds and mass emergency crowds) are commonplace, and such constructions impact on policy and practice. In his research, Drury has sought to problematise these dominant accounts of the crowd, and suggest a language for the crowd that recognises and celebrates its positive role in the social world. To a certain extent, power is sustained through systems of meaning, and so Drury uses critical discourse analysis to understand, expose and subvert dominant discourses, therefore creating the space for \u2018liberatory\u2019 discourses.\n\n== Key publications ==\n\n'''Journal articles'''\n\n*Barr, D., & Drury, J.

However, the FM12 was never widely adopted by the military as it was deemed too similar to the S10 to warrant total replacement of all existing S10s.\n\nIt was used, however, when an individual found that the S10 did not fit his face.\n\n==Characteristics==\nTwo filter canisters are issued for the FM12, as with the S10; a light pressed metal type for riot control situations or training (marked with a painted red stripe or red tape), and a heavier plastic-encased type for protection against [[CBRN defense|NBC]] agents. The latter have a maximum shelf-life of 10 years, and the mask itself (the facepiece) of 20 years. The mask was designed around the S10, but has several design differences. The characteristics it shares in common with the S10 are the fail-safe drinking device, an SST (Secondary Speech Transmitter), and the ability to accept corrective lenses on the inside of the eyepiece.\n\nHowever, the voice emitter and exhale valve cover is smaller than that of the S10, as are the lenses. The FM12 has an overall lower profile than the S10 and sits closer to the wearer's face. The FM12's drinking tube is also longer than that of the S10, making drinking easier while wearing the mask. The FM12 also has an inner mask to prevent fogging of the lenses. The 'ridge' present around the edge of the S10 is absent from the FM12.\n\nThe main noticeable difference between the FM12 and the S10 is the ability of some FM12's to mount two filters to the mask simultaneously, as was done by the [[Special Boat Service|SBS]] in the [[Gulf War]]. When only one filter is fitted to a mask that has the ability to accept two, a blanking plug must be used.\n\nThe harness of the FM12 consists of elastic strips, which connect to a mesh fabric piece on the back of the wearer's head. This change from the rubber straps of the S10 was designed to enable the mask to be worn for longer periods of time without discomfort, and also to hold the mask tighter to the face for a better seal.\n\n==Variants==\n\n===CT12===\nRespirator used for counter-terrorism operations. The difference between the FM12 and the CT12 is that the CT12 has had the drinking straw removed and sealed at the factory. This is to reduce the overall weight of the respirator, as the straw is not needed in a counter-terrorist situation. This variant is considerably rarer than the FM12.\n\n==Users==\n\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.

turned to Jewell, who was by now Kamara's assistant, and he won his first game 2\u20131 to [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]]. In his 21 games in charge, Jewell won six games and drew five to guide Bradford to 13th, their highest position since Jewell had joined the club.
