Its natural habitat is pastureland where it forages amongst grazing animals such as cows, hence the name \"cowbird\". Similar to other cowbirds, it forages predominantly on the ground, eating invertebrates that have been disturbed by grazing stock. The distribution of the screaming cowbird has increased significantly in recent decades due to habitat alteration caused by [[deforestation]] and by following its hosts into new areas.<ref name=\"autogenerated684\"/><ref>{{Cite journal|title = Reproductive success of the specialist brood parasite Screaming Cowbird in an alternative host, the Chopi Blackbird|journal = The Auk|date = 2014|issn = 0004-8038|pages = 16\u201324|volume = 132|issue = 1|doi = 10.1642/AUK-13-008.1|first = Alejandro G.|last = Di Giacomo|first2 = Juan C.|last2 = Reboreda|hdl = 11336/19670|hdl-access = free}}</ref> Both female and male screaming cowbirds show high fidelity in roosting locations.<ref>{{cite journal |author1= Scardamaglia, R.C. |author2= Kacelnik, A. | author3= Reboreda, J.C. | year=2018| title= Roosting behaviour is related to reproductive strategy in brood parasitic cowbirds | journal=Ibis| volume=160| pages= 779\u2013789  | doi=10.1111/ibi.12587 | issue=4|hdl= 11336/96594 | hdl-access= free }}</ref>\n\n== Reproduction ==\n\n=== Host species ===\nThe screaming cowbird is a specialist brood parasite, predominantly parasitizing the nests of the [[bay-winged cowbird]] (''Agelaidoides badius'' [formerly ''Molothrus badius'']).<ref name=\"autogenerated186\"/><ref name=\"bioone417\">{{Cite journal|title = Reproductive Success and Nestling Growth of the Baywing Parasitized by Screaming and Shiny Cowbirds|journal = The Wilson Journal of Ornithology|date = 2010-08-24|issn = 1559-4491|pages = 417\u2013431|volume = 122|issue = 3|doi = 10.1676/09-140.1|first = Mar\u00eda C.|last = de M\u00e1rsico|first2 = Bettina|last2 = Mahler|first3 = Juan C.|last3 = Reboreda}}</ref><ref name=\"bioone407\">{{Cite journal|title = Brood Parasitism Increases Mortality of Bay-Winged Cowbird Nests|journal = The Condor|date = 2010-05-01|issn = 0010-5422|pages = 407\u2013417|volume = 112|issue = 2|doi = 10.1525/cond.2010.090118|first = Mar\u00eda C.|last = de M\u00e1rsico|first2 = Juan C.|last2 = Reboreda|url = http://ri.conicet.gov.ar/bitstream/11336/68837/2/CONICET_Digital_Nro.d9cecf9d-96b5-4865-9b26-c4ebdd2a97ca_A.pdf|hdl = 11336/68837}}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1979\">{{cite journal | last1 = Fraga | first1 = R.

Its natural habitat is pastureland where it forages amongst grazing animals such as cows, hence the name \"cowbird\". Similar to other cowbirds, it forages predominantly on the ground, eating invertebrates that have been disturbed by grazing stock. The distribution of the screaming cowbird has increased significantly in recent decades due to habitat alteration caused by [[deforestation]] and by following its hosts into new areas.<ref name=\"autogenerated684\"/><ref>{{Cite journal|title = Reproductive success of the specialist brood parasite Screaming Cowbird in an alternative host, the Chopi Blackbird|journal = The Auk|date = 2014|issn = 0004-8038|pages = 16\u201324|volume = 132|issue = 1|doi = 10.1642/AUK-13-008.1|first = Alejandro G.|last = Di Giacomo|first2 = Juan C.|last2 = Reboreda|hdl = 11336/19670|hdl-access = free}}</ref> Both female and male screaming cowbirds show high fidelity in roosting locations.<ref>{{cite journal |author1= Scardamaglia, R.C. |author2= Kacelnik, A. | author3= Reboreda, J.C. | year=2018| title= Roosting behaviour is related to reproductive strategy in brood parasitic cowbirds | journal=Ibis| volume=160| pages= 779\u2013789  | doi=10.1111/ibi.12587 | issue=4|hdl= 11336/96594 | hdl-access= free }}</ref>  \n\n== Reproduction ==\n\n=== Host species ===\nThe screaming cowbird is a specialist brood parasite, predominantly parasitizing the nests of the [[bay-winged cowbird]] (''Agelaidoides badius'' [formerly ''Molothrus badius'']).<ref name=\"autogenerated186\"/><ref name=\"bioone417\">{{Cite journal|title = Reproductive Success and Nestling Growth of the Baywing Parasitized by Screaming and Shiny Cowbirds|journal = The Wilson Journal of Ornithology|date = 2010-08-24|issn = 1559-4491|pages = 417\u2013431|volume = 122|issue = 3|doi = 10.1676/09-140.1|first = Mar\u00eda C.|last = de M\u00e1rsico|first2 = Bettina|last2 = Mahler|first3 = Juan C.|last3 = Reboreda}}</ref><ref name=\"bioone407\">{{Cite journal|title = Brood Parasitism Increases Mortality of Bay-Winged Cowbird Nests|journal = The Condor|date = 2010-05-01|issn = 0010-5422|pages = 407\u2013417|volume = 112|issue = 2|doi = 10.1525/cond.2010.090118|first = Mar\u00eda C.|last = de M\u00e1rsico|first2 = Juan C.|last2 = Reboreda|url = http://ri.conicet.gov.ar/bitstream/11336/68837/2/CONICET_Digital_Nro.d9cecf9d-96b5-4865-9b26-c4ebdd2a97ca_A.pdf|hdl = 11336/68837}}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1979\">{{cite journal | last1 = Fraga | first1 = R.

Most do not know they have this disorder because most individuals do not show any symptoms. However, the ones that do show symptoms will typically have a curvature of the spine ([[scoliosis]]), and multiple bone fractures. There are two types of adult osteopetrosis based on the basis of radiographic, biochemical, and clinical features. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Characteristic\n!Type I\n!Type II\n|-\n|Skull Sclerosis\n|Marked sclerosis mainly of the vault\n|Sclerosis mainly of the base \n|-\n|Spine\n|Does not show signs of sclerosis\n|Shows the rugger-jersey appearance \n|-\n|Pelvis\n|No endobones\n|Shows endobones in the pelvis \n|-\n|Risk of Fracture\n|Low\n|High\n|-\n|Serum Acid Phosphate\n|Normal \n|Very high\n|}\nMany patients will have bone pains. The defects are very common and include neuropathies due to cranial [[Nerve compression syndrome|nerve entrapment]], [[osteoarthritis]], and carpal tunnel syndrome. About 40% of patients will experience recurrent fractures of their bones. 10% of patients will have [[osteomyelitis]] of the [[mandible]].\n\n== Causes ==\nThe various types of osteopetrosis are caused by genetic changes (mutations) in one of at least ten genes. There is nothing a parent can do before, during or after a pregnancy to cause osteopetrosis in a child.<ref name=\":2\"/>\n\nThe genes associated with osteopetrosis are involved in the development and/or function of osteoclasts, cells that break down bone tissue when old bone is being replaced by new bone (bone remodeling). This process is necessary to keep bones strong and healthy. Mutations in these genes can lead to abnormal [[osteoclast]]s, or having too few [[osteoclast]]s. If this happens, old bone cannot be broken down as new bone is formed, so bones become too dense and prone to breaking.<ref name=\":2\" />\n* Mutations in the [[CLCN7]] gene cause most cases of autosomal dominant osteopetrosis, 10-15% of cases of [[Autosomal Recessive|autosomal recessive]] osteopetrosis (the most severe form), and all known cases of intermediate autosomal osteopetrosis.\n* Mutations in the [[TCIRG1]] gene cause about 50% of cases of [[Autosomal Recessive|autosomal recessive]] osteopetrosis.\n* Mutations in the [[IKBKG]] gene cause [[X-linked]] osteopetrosis.\n* Mutations in other genes are less common causes of osteopetrosis.\n* In about 30% percent of affected people, the cause is unknown.\nNormally, bone growth is a balance between osteoblasts (cells that create bone tissue) and osteoclasts (cells that destroy bone tissue).

''[[TCIRG1]]'' gene mutations cause about 50 percent of cases of autosomal recessive osteopetrosis. Mutations in other genes are less common causes of autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms of the disorder.

Bones are constantly being remodeled, and the process is carefully controlled to ensure that bones stay strong and healthy.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMutations in any of the genes associated with osteopetrosis lead to abnormal or missing [[osteoclast]]s. Without functional osteoclasts, old bone is not broken down as new bone is formed. As a result, bones throughout the skeleton become unusually dense.

There is no cure, although curative therapy with [[bone marrow]] transplantion is being investigated in clinical trials. It is believed the healthy marrow will provide the sufferer with cells from which osteoclasts will develop.<ref name=\":2\" /> If complications occur in children, patients can be treated with [[vitamin D]]. Gamma interferon has also been shown to be effective, and it can be associated to vitamin D. [[Erythropoietin|Erythropoetin]] has been used to treat any associated [[anemia]]. [[Corticosteroid]]s may alleviate both the anemia and stimulate bone resorption. Fractures and [[osteomyelitis]] can be treated as usual.<ref name=\":2\" /> Treatment for osteopetrosis depends on the specific symptoms present and the severity in each person. Therefore, treatment options must be evaluated on an individual basis. Nutritional support is important to improve growth and it also enhances responsiveness to other treatment options.

The severe infantile forms of osteopetrosis are associated with shortened life expectancy, with most untreated children not surviving past their first decade. [[Bone marrow transplantation]] seems to have cured some infants with early-onset disease. However, the long-term prognosis after transplantation is unknown. For those with onset in childhood or adolescence, the effect of the condition depends on the specific symptoms (including how fragile the bones are and how much pain is present).

Br J Haematol 140:597, 208</ref> [[Carbonic anhydrase]] is required by osteoclasts for proton production. Without this enzyme hydrogen ion pumping is inhibited and bone resorption by osteoclasts is defective, as an acidic environment is needed to dissociate [[calcium hydroxyapatite]] from the bone matrix. As bone resorption fails while bone formation continues, excessive bone is formed.<ref>Robbins Basic Pathology by Kumar, Abbas, Fausto, and Mitchell, 8th edition</ref>\n\nMutations in at least nine genes cause the various types of osteopetrosis. Mutations in the ''[[CLCN7]]'' gene are responsible for about 75 percent of cases of [[autosomal dominant]] osteopetrosis, 10 to 15 percent of cases of autosomal recessive osteopetrosis, and all known cases of intermediate autosomal osteopetrosis. ''[[TCIRG1]]'' gene mutations cause about 50 percent of cases of autosomal recessive osteopetrosis. Mutations in other genes are less common causes of autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms of the disorder. The [[X-linked]] type of osteopetrosis, OL-EDA-ID, results from mutations in the ''[[IKBKG]]'' gene. In about 30 percent of all cases of osteopetrosis, the cause of the condition is unknown.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/osteopetrosis#|title=osteopetrosis|last=Reference|first=Genetics Home|website=Genetics Home Reference|language=en|access-date=2017-12-13}}</ref>\n\nThe genes associated with osteopetrosis are involved in the formation, development, and function of specialized cells called [[osteoclast]]s. These cells break down bone tissue during bone remodeling, a normal process in which old bone is removed and new bone is created to replace it. Bones are constantly being remodeled, and the process is carefully controlled to ensure that bones stay strong and healthy.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMutations in any of the genes associated with osteopetrosis lead to abnormal or missing [[osteoclast]]s. Without functional osteoclasts, old bone is not broken down as new bone is formed. As a result, bones throughout the skeleton become unusually dense. The bones are also structurally abnormal, making them prone to fracture. These problems with bone remodeling underlie all of the major features of osteopetrosis.<ref name=\":0\" />[[File:Protein TNFSF11 PDB 1s55.png|thumb|Protein TNFSF 11(RANKL)]]\n\n==Diagnosis==\nThe differential diagnosis of osteopetrosis includes other disorders that produce [[osteosclerosis]].

Among the differential diagnosis are hereditary ostoesclerosing dysplasias such as; neuropathic infantile osteopetrosis, infantile osteopetrosis with renal tubular acidosis, infantile osteopetrosis with immunodeficiency, infantile osteopetrosis with leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome (LAD-III), [[pyknodysostosis]] (osteopetrosis acro-osteolytica), [[osteopoikilosis]] ([[Buschke\u2013Ollendorff syndrome]]), [[osteopathia striata]] with cranial sclerosis, mixed sclerosing [[skeletal dysplasia]]s, progressive diaphyseal dysplasia ([[Camurati\u2013Engelmann disease]]), SOST-related sclerosing [[skeletal dysplasia]]s.<ref name=\"elsobky2016\" /> Besides, the differential diagnosis includes acquired conditions that induce osteosclerosis such as osteosclerotic metastasis notably carcinomas of the prostate gland and breast, [[Paget's disease of bone]], myelofibrosis (primary disorder or secondary to intoxication or malignancy), Erdheim-Chester disease, osteosclerosing types of [[osteomyelitis]], [[sickle cell disease]], hypervitaminosis D, and [[hypoparathyroidism]].<ref name=\"Ihde\">Ihde LL, Forrester DM, Gottsegen CJ, Masih S, Patel DB, Vachon LA, et al.

There is no cure, although curative therapy with [[bone marrow]] transplantion is being investigated in clinical trials. It is believed the healthy marrow will provide the sufferer with cells from which osteoclasts will develop.<ref name=\":2\" /> If complications occur in children, patients can be treated with [[vitamin D]]. Gamma interferon has also been shown to be effective, and it can be associated to vitamin D. [[Erythropoietin|Erythropoetin]] has been used to treat any associated [[anemia]]. [[Corticosteroid]]s may alleviate both the anemia and stimulate bone resorption. Fractures and [[osteomyelitis]] can be treated as usual.<ref name=\":2\" /> Treatment for osteopetrosis depends on the specific symptoms present and the severity in each person. Therefore, treatment options must be evaluated on an individual basis. Nutritional support is important to improve growth and it also enhances responsiveness to other treatment options.

The severe infantile forms of osteopetrosis are associated with shortened life expectancy, with most untreated children not surviving past their first decade. [[Bone marrow transplantation]] seems to have cured some infants with early-onset disease. However, the long-term prognosis after transplantation is unknown. For those with onset in childhood or adolescence, the effect of the condition depends on the specific symptoms (including how fragile the bones are and how much pain is present).

There are several proposed mechanisms for [[neuron]]al [[apoptosis|death]] in PD; however, not all of them are well understood. Five proposed major mechanisms for neuronal death in Parkinson's Disease include protein aggregation in [[Lewy Body|Lewy bodies]], disruption of [[autophagy]], changes in cell metabolism or [[mitochondria]]l function, [[neuroinflammation]], and [[blood-brain barrier]] (BBB) breakdown resulting in vascular leakiness.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tansey MG, Goldberg MS | year = 2010 | title = Neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease: Its role in neuronal death and implications for therapeutic intervention | url = | journal = Neurobiology of Disease | volume = 37 | issue = 3| pages = 510\u2013518 | doi = 10.1016/j.nbd.2009.11.004 }}</ref>\n\n==Protein aggregation==\n[[File:Lewy Body alphaSynuclein.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A brain tissue with Lewy bodies.|A brain tissue with Lewy bodies.]]\nThe first major proposed cause of neuronal death in Parkinson's disease is the bundling, or [[oligomer]]ization, of [[protein]]s.
