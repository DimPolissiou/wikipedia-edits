After some early mechanical problems, only 2,176 were built of the 10,680 planned. It was armed with a 20-mm cannon, which was an unusually powerful weapon for an armoured personnel carrier of the period. \nIts design proved to have many flaws and drawbacks, and the construction was followed by a great political scandal in West Germany in the 1960s. 2,176 SPz HS.30 and variants were built until 1962, for which the German government paid 517 million DM, or about 238,000 DM per vehicle. The HS.30 first entered service with the ''[[Panzergrenadier]]'' battalions in 1960{{sfn|Hammerich|2006|p=319}} and was replaced by the [[Marder (IFV)|Marder]] infantry fighting vehicle from 1971.\n\n==Design and doctrine==\nRejecting American [[doctrine]] that an armored personnel carrier should serve as a \"battlefield taxi\" and not as an assault vehicle, the Germans developed the HS.30 as a vehicle to fight alongside tanks and from which their [[mechanized infantry]] could fight from under cover. The German military came to this decision as a result of its [[World War II]] experience with [[Panzergrenadier|''Panzergrenadiere'']] (armored infantry). German doctrine saw the SPz 12-3 as part of the squad's equipment, and the squad was trained to fight with the vehicle in both offense and defense. Unlike the American [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M113]], the HS.30 could not float, but as German doctrine envisaged the HS.30 as a component in operations combined with [[main battle tank]]s that also lacked such a capability, this was not seen as a grave disadvantage.<ref>Haworth, p. 39.</ref>\n[[File:Sch\u00fctzenpanzer (lang) Hispano-Suiza HS 30.jpg|thumb|left|HS.30 as presented in the [[German Tank Museum]] in 2008]]\n\nThe HS.30 mounted a small turret with a [[Hispano-Suiza HS.820]] 20-mm [[autocannon]] and a 15\u00d715 periscopic sight. The role of the 20-mm autocannon in German doctrine was to engage helicopters, anti-tank weapons, and light armored vehicles, thus freeing tanks to concentrate their fire against other tanks. Even with the turret, the HS.30 was fully two feet (~0.6 m) lower in height than the M113 - no small advantage on an armored battlefield. The vehicle had an onboard supply of 2,000 rounds of 20&nbsp;mm ammunition.<ref>Janes, p. 250.</ref>  Frontal armor provided protection against 20-mm projectiles, which was stronger than comparable vehicles of other nations.  The additional armor made the HS.30 four tons heavier than the M113, even though it could only carry half as many troops.  For the squad members to fire their personal weapons while mounted, roof hatches had to be opened with the soldiers sticking up out of the hatches.  The Germans considered this a significant disadvantage as their likely opponent, the [[Soviet Army]], was expected to use [[chemical agents]] in any war between NATO and the Warsaw Pact.\n\nDespite the German army's insistence on a true infantry fighting vehicle rather than just an armored personnel carrier, the ''[[Panzergrenadier]]'' brigades included an infantry battalion that was carried initially on trucks and later with M113 APCs. This force composition likely resulted as much from cost considerations as it did from doctrine that called for one third of the ''Panzergrenadiere'' to be a motorized force.<ref>Haworth, p. 40.</ref>\n\n==The HS.30 and its contemporaries==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+Comparison of the SPz HS.30 and similar vehicles<ref>Data from ''Janes'' and [http://afvdb.50megs.com/usa/m113.html  M113]</ref>\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top; text-align:center; border:1px solid #996;\"\n!

The military requirements pointed to a vehicle like the French [[AMX-VCI|AMX-13 VTP]], but its cost per unit was too high. The US [[M59 armored personnel carrier]] on the other hand was too heavy and too tall for the envisioned doctrine.<ref name=\"Kollmar\"/> Also problematic was West German industry lack of interest in building weapons - as a result of World War II, Germany was still forbidden to export arms, so the investment for developing an AFV, to pay for tooling, or the training of the workforce would not generate any future revenue from exports. So for political considerations, it seemed reasonable to turn to West Germany's allies to order AFVs and support their struggling economies. The [[Sch\u00fctzenpanzer SPz 11-2 Kurz]] (developed from the Hotchkiss SP1A) was ordered from France and, after a deal to acquire the [[Centurion (tank)|Centurion]] from the United Kingdom became obsolete when the US provided [[M41 Walker Bulldog|M41 Walker Bulldog]] and [[M47 Patton]] tanks as [[military aid]], forming a [[consortium]], to build the new AFV partially in Britain, as offered by [[Hispano-Suiza]] in 1955, seemed appealing.<ref name=\"Kollmar\">\"Milit\u00e4rgeschichte - Zeitschrift f\u00fcr politische Bildung\" Heft 3, 2004, ISSN 0940-4163, Major Dieter H. Kollmar \"Der Sch\u00fctzenpanzer HS 30 - Dichtung und Wahrheit\", pages 12-15</ref> \n\nThe Hispano-Suiza offer matched all the requirements, laid out by the German [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Defence]] and, with an estimated cost of only 170.000 DM, the price  per unit was 30% lower than the AMX VTP. In combination with time pressure, generated by the promise to NATO to form and equip 12 West German [[Division (military)|divisions]] until 1960, the German Ministry of Defence opted for the Hispano-Suiza model and placed orders for 10,680 AFVs.<ref name=\"Kollmar\"/>. Dieter H. Kollmar concludes in his analysis of the acquisition process, that it seems reasonable to assume that the company had learned about the requirements in advance and adjusted their offer accordingly. Hispano-Suiza itself did not have the facilities to build an AFV. It had acquired patents for a 20-mm auto cannon and used them in conjunction with its network of business contacts around Europe to finalize the AFV plans. [[Lobbying|Lobbyists]], often recruited from the ranks of former [[Wehrmacht]] officers, aggressively solicited for Hispano-Suiza with the decision makers in the Ministry of Defence, who often shared the same background.<ref name=\"Kollmar\"/> \n\nWhen the Ministry of Defence, under its new secretary [[Franz Josef Strauss]], learned from the HS.30 evaluation on the proving grounds in 1958 about multiple shortcomings of the vehicle,<ref name=\"GFG181166\">[http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btd/05/011/0501135.pdf German Federal Government:\"V/1135 - R\u00fcstungsgesch\u00e4fte mit Hispano-Suiza\"] 18 November 1966, page 3 ff</ref> it became increasingly impatient with Hispano-Suiza and cut the initial order of 10,680 down to 2800, with 1089 to be build by Leyland in the United Kingdom, the rest by [[Henschel]] and [[Hanomag]] in Germany.<ref name=\"Kollmar\"/> A settlement with Hispano-Suiza was reached in 1960, with the german state paying 40 million DM to compensate for investments and lost revenue.<ref>{{cite |url=http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btd/05/045/0504527.pdf |title=Written report by the 1st committee of inquiry on the request of the FDP parliamentary group to set up a parliamentary inquiry committee in accordance with Article 44 of the Basic Law |publisher=German Federal Government |id=\"V/4527\" |page= 42}}</ref>\n\nLater a series of disclosures by the press, several hearings and an investigation evolved around the acquisition of the HS.30. Witnesses, like the former ambassador of Germany in [[Switzerland]] [[Friedrich Holzapfel]],<ref>[https://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-46415558.html \"HS30 - Kanzler sehr b\u00f6se\"] [[Der Spiegel]] 19 december 1966</ref> were heard and a story about potential payments made to individuals and political parties was spread, based on claims made by the then lobbyist and 1930s [[Weimar Republic]] secretary [[Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus (politician)|Gottfried Treviranus]]<ref name=\"GFG181166\"/> and  businessman [[Werner Plappert]].<ref>German Federal Government:\"V/4527\", pages 79</ref> According to Dieter H. Kollmar, the progress of the official investigation was hampered by witnesses just craving for recognition and charlatans. Accusations, made in that context against Franz Josef Strauss, later proved to be false. Kollmar saw the problems with the HS.30 in the fraudulent practises of Hispano-Suiza and insufficient controlling processes in the Federal Ministry of Defences procurement plans.<ref name=\"Kollmar\"/>\n\n===Reliability problems===\n[[File:HS 30 back (24362220407).jpg|thumb|right|HS.30 rear with the double door on the left and the dome-shaped cover for the engine room ventilation on the right]]\n[[File:German soldier jumping from Schuetzenpanzer Lang 1960.jpg|thumb|right|A German soldier disembarks from a HS.30 by jumping over its side.]]\nAfter a series of substantial upgrades, the HS.30 was stated in the 1960s by the official committee of investigation to fulfill the army's requirements \u2033mostly\u2033 (''bedingt'').

After some early mechanical problems, only 2,176 were built of the 10,680 planned. It was armed with a 20-mm cannon, which was an unusually powerful weapon for an armoured personnel carrier of the period. \nIts design proved to have many flaws and drawbacks, and the construction was followed by a great political scandal in West Germany in the 1960s. 2,176 SPz HS.30 and variants were built until 1962, for which the German government paid 517 million DM, or about 238,000 DM per vehicle. The HS.30 first entered service with the ''[[Panzergrenadier]]'' battalions in 1960{{sfn|Hammerich|2006|p=319}} and was replaced by the [[Marder (IFV)|Marder]] infantry fighting vehicle from 1971.\n\n==Design and doctrine==\nRejecting American [[doctrine]] that an armored personnel carrier should serve as a \"battlefield taxi\" and not as an assault vehicle, the Germans developed the HS.30 as a vehicle to fight alongside tanks and from which their [[mechanized infantry]] could fight from under cover. The German military came to this decision as a result of its [[World War II]] experience with [[Panzergrenadier|''Panzergrenadiere'']] (armored infantry). German doctrine saw the SPz 12-3 as part of the squad's equipment, and the squad was trained to fight with the vehicle in both offense and defense. Unlike the American [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M113]], the HS.30 could not float, but as German doctrine envisaged the HS.30 as a component in operations combined with [[main battle tank]]s that also lacked such a capability, this was not seen as a grave disadvantage.<ref>Haworth, p. 39.</ref>\n[[File:Sch\u00fctzenpanzer (lang) Hispano-Suiza HS 30.jpg|thumb|left|HS.30 as presented in the [[German Tank Museum]] in 2008]]\n\nThe HS.30 mounted a small turret with a [[Hispano-Suiza HS.820]] 20-mm [[autocannon]] and a 15\u00d715 periscopic sight. The role of the 20-mm autocannon in German doctrine was to engage helicopters, anti-tank weapons, and light armored vehicles, thus freeing tanks to concentrate their fire against other tanks. Even with the turret, the HS.30 was fully two feet (~0.6 m) lower in height than the M113 - no small advantage on an armored battlefield. The vehicle had an onboard supply of 2,000 rounds of 20&nbsp;mm ammunition.<ref>Janes, p. 250.</ref>  Frontal armor provided protection against 20-mm projectiles, which was stronger than comparable vehicles of other nations.  The additional armor made the HS.30 four tons heavier than the M113, even though it could only carry half as many troops.  For the squad members to fire their personal weapons while mounted, roof hatches had to be opened with the soldiers sticking up out of the hatches.  The Germans considered this a significant disadvantage as their likely opponent, the [[Soviet Army]], was expected to use [[chemical agents]] in any war between NATO and the Warsaw Pact.\n\nDespite the German army's insistence on a true infantry fighting vehicle rather than just an armored personnel carrier, the ''[[Panzergrenadier]]'' brigades included an infantry battalion that was carried initially on trucks and later with M113 APCs. This force composition likely resulted as much from cost considerations as it did from doctrine that called for one third of the ''Panzergrenadiere'' to be a motorized force.<ref>Haworth, p. 40.</ref>\n\n==The HS.30 and its contemporaries==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+Comparison of the SPz HS.30 and similar vehicles<ref>Data from ''Janes'' and [http://afvdb.50megs.com/usa/m113.html  M113]</ref>\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top; text-align:center; border:1px solid #996;\"\n!

The military requirements pointed to a vehicle like the French [[AMX-VCI|AMX-13 VTP]], but its cost per unit was too high. The US [[M59 armored personnel carrier]] on the other hand was too heavy and too tall for the envisioned doctrine.<ref name=\"Kollmar\"/> Also problematic was West German industry lack of interest in building weapons - as a result of World War II, Germany was still forbidden to export arms, so the investment for developing an AFV, to pay for tooling, or the training of the workforce would not generate any future revenue from exports. So for political considerations, it seemed reasonable to turn to West Germany's allies to order AFVs and support their struggling economies. The [[Sch\u00fctzenpanzer SPz 11-2 Kurz]] (developed from the Hotchkiss SP1A) was ordered from France and, after a deal to acquire the [[Centurion (tank)|Centurion]] from the United Kingdom became obsolete when the US provided [[M41 Walker Bulldog|M41 Walker Bulldog]] and [[M47 Patton]] tanks as [[military aid]], forming a [[consortium]], to build the new AFV partially in Britain, as offered by [[Hispano-Suiza]] in 1955, seemed appealing.<ref name=\"Kollmar\">\"Milit\u00e4rgeschichte - Zeitschrift f\u00fcr politische Bildung\" Heft 3, 2004, ISSN 0940-4163, Major Dieter H. Kollmar \"Der Sch\u00fctzenpanzer HS 30 - Dichtung und Wahrheit\", pages 12-15</ref> \n\nThe Hispano-Suiza offer matched all the requirements, laid out by the German [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Defence]] and, with an estimated cost of only 170.000 DM, the price  per unit was 30% lower than the AMX VTP. In combination with time pressure, generated by the promise to NATO to form and equip 12 West German [[Division (military)|divisions]] until 1960, the German Ministry of Defence opted for the Hispano-Suiza model and placed orders for 10,680 AFVs.<ref name=\"Kollmar\"/>. Dieter H. Kollmar concludes in his analysis of the acquisition process, that it seems reasonable to assume that the company had learned about the requirements in advance and adjusted their offer accordingly. Hispano-Suiza itself did not have the facilities to build an AFV. It had acquired patents for a 20-mm auto cannon and used them in conjunction with its network of business contacts around Europe to finalize the AFV plans. [[Lobbying|Lobbyists]], often recruited from the ranks of former [[Wehrmacht]] officers, aggressively solicited for Hispano-Suiza with the decision makers in the Ministry of Defence, who often shared the same background.<ref name=\"Kollmar\"/> \n\nWhen the Ministry of Defence, under its new secretary [[Franz Josef Strauss]], learned from the HS.30 evaluation on the proving grounds in 1958 about multiple shortcomings of the vehicle,<ref name=\"GFG181166\">[http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btd/05/011/0501135.pdf German Federal Government:\"V/1135 - R\u00fcstungsgesch\u00e4fte mit Hispano-Suiza\"] 18 November 1966, page 3 ff</ref> it became increasingly impatient with Hispano-Suiza and cut the initial order of 10,680 down to 2800, with 1089 to be build by Leyland in the United Kingdom, the rest by [[Henschel]] and [[Hanomag]] in Germany.<ref name=\"Kollmar\"/> A settlement with Hispano-Suiza was reached in 1960, with the german state paying 40 million DM to compensate for investments and lost revenue.<ref>{{cite |url=http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btd/05/045/0504527.pdf |title=Written report by the 1st committee of inquiry on the request of the FDP parliamentary group to set up a parliamentary inquiry committee in accordance with Article 44 of the Basic Law |publisher=German Federal Government |id=\"V/4527\" |page= 42}}</ref>\n\nLater a series of disclosures by the press, several hearings and an investigation evolved around the acquisition of the HS.30. Witnesses, like the former ambassador of Germany in [[Switzerland]] [[Friedrich Holzapfel]],<ref>[https://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-46415558.html \"HS30 - Kanzler sehr b\u00f6se\"] [[Der Spiegel]] 19 december 1966</ref> were heard and a story about potential payments made to individuals and political parties was spread, based on claims made by the then lobbyist and 1930s [[Weimar Republic]] secretary [[Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus (politician)|Gottfried Treviranus]]<ref name=\"GFG181166\"/> and  businessman [[Werner Plappert]].<ref>German Federal Government:\"V/4527\", pages 79</ref> According to Dieter H. Kollmar, the progress of the official investigation was hampered by witnesses just craving for recognition and charlatans. Accusations, made in that context against Franz Josef Strauss, later proved to be false. Kollmar saw the problems with the HS.30 in the fraudulent practises of Hispano-Suiza and insufficient controlling processes in the Federal Ministry of Defences procurement plans.<ref name=\"Kollmar\"/>\n\n===Reliability problems===\n[[File:HS 30 back (24362220407).jpg|thumb|right|HS.30 rear with the double door on the left and the dome-shaped cover for the engine room ventilation on the right]]\n[[File:German soldier jumping from Schuetzenpanzer Lang 1960.jpg|thumb|right|A German soldier disembarks from a HS.30 by jumping over its side.]]\nAfter a series of substantial upgrades, the HS.30 was stated in the 1960s by the official committee of investigation to fulfill the army's requirements \u2033mostly\u2033 (''bedingt'').

Uveitis is driven by the [[Th17]] T cell sub-population that bear [[T-cell receptor]]s specific for proteins found in the eye.<ref name=nian /> These are often not deleted centrally whether due to ocular antigen not being presented in the [[thymus]] (therefore not negatively selected) or a state of anergy is induced to prevent self targeting.<ref name=lamb /><ref name=avi />\n\nAutoreactive T cells must normally be held in check by the suppressive environment produced by [[microglia]] and [[dendritic cells]] in the eye.<ref name=forr /> These cells produce large amounts of [[TGF beta]] and other suppressive [[cytokine]]s, including [[interleukin-10|IL-10]], to prevent damage to the eye by reducing inflammation and causing T cells to differentiate to inducible T reg cells. Innate immune stimulation by bacteria and cellular stress is normally suppressed by myeloid suppression while inducible [[Treg]] cells prevent activation and clonal expansion of the autoreactive [[Th1 cell|Th1]] and [[Th17]] cells that possess potential to cause damage to the eye.\n\nWhether through infection or other causes, this balance can be upset and autoreactive T cells allowed to proliferate and migrate to the eye. Upon entry to the eye, these cells may be returned to an inducible Treg state by the presence of IL-10 and TGF-beta from microglia. Failure of this mechanism leads to [[neutrophil]] and other [[leukocyte]] recruitment from the peripheral blood through [[interleukin 17|IL-17]] secretion.

Innate immune stimulation by bacteria and cellular stress is normally suppressed by myeloid suppression while inducible [[Treg]] cells prevent activation and clonal expansion of the autoreactive [[Th1 cell|Th1]] and [[Th17]] cells that possess potential to cause damage to the eye.\n\nWhether through infection or other causes, this balance can be upset and autoreactive T cells allowed to proliferate and migrate to the eye. Upon entry to the eye, these cells may be returned to an inducible Treg state by the presence of IL-10 and TGF-beta from microglia.

Previously Mansfield had been the largest town in Britain without a rail link.\n* [[Peterborough to Lincoln Line|Lincoln to Peterborough line]]. The section between Peterborough and Spalding closed to passengers on 5 October 1970 and reopened on 7 June 1971.\n* North of [[Sleaford railway station|Sleaford]], [[Ruskington railway station|Ruskington station]] reopened on 5 May 1975 and [[Metheringham railway station|Metheringham Station]] reopened on 6 October 1975.\n* Stations at {{rws|Syston}}, {{rws|Sileby}} and {{rws|Barrow-upon-Soar}} between Leicester and Loughborough closed in 1968 reopened in 1994. \n* The [[Kettering railway station|Kettering]] to Melton Mowbray Line via [[Corby railway station|Corby]] and Oakham closed to passengers on 18 April 1966. A line was reopened in 1987 with a shuttle service between Kettering and Corby, but the service was unreliable and lost funding support from the local council, leading to its closure in 1990. The line was then reopened on 23 February 2009 with [[Corby railway station|Corby]] with direct trains to London and a limited number of trains continuing on towards Oakham and Melton Mowbray.\n* [[Alfreton railway station|Alfreton]], [[Langley Mill railway station|Langley Mill]] and [[Ilkeston railway station|Ilkeston]] stations on the [[Erewash Valley Line]] have since been reopened.\n* {{rws|Narborough}} was closed in 1968 but reopened two years later, {{rws|Willington}} was closed in 1968 and reopened in 1994 and {{rws|Wigston Glen Parva}} was closed in 1968 and replaced with a new station {{rws|South Wigston}} in 1986 on an adjacent site.\n\n===West Midlands===\n* [[Birmingham Snow Hill railway station|Birmingham Snow Hill station]], after closing in 1972, was rebuilt and reopened in 1987 along with [[Snow Hill Tunnel (Birmingham)|Snow Hill tunnel]] underneath [[Birmingham]] city centre to {{stnlnk|Birmingham Moor Street}}.

Despite the successful and potential reopening of many rail routes as light-rail and metro lines, the concept is still under threat due to the varying popularity of these schemes with successive governments.\n* The line from [[Oxford railway station|Oxford]] to [[Bicester Village railway station|Bicester]] reopened in 1987 after closing in 1968\n* The line from [[Coventry to Nuneaton Line|Coventry to Nuneaton]] reopened to passengers in 1988. \n* The line from [[Coventry to Leamington line]] reopened to passengers in 1977 and the station at [[Kenilworth railway station|Kenilworth]] reopened on 30 April 2018.\n* The [[Chase Line|Walsall\u2013Hednesford line]] reopened to passengers in 1989, and was extended to [[Rugeley Town railway station|Rugeley]] in 1997. Passenger services were terminated between {{Stnlnk|Walsall}} and {{Stnlnk|Wolverhampton}} in 2008 on cost and efficiency grounds. Some commentators believe an intermediate station at Willenhall should have been included with the original reopening.\n* The [[Cotswold Line]] has been redoubled in places and [[Honeybourne railway station|Honeybourne]] station reopened.\n \n===North East===\n* On the lines from Leeds/Bradford to Skipton the following stations closed in 1965 have been reopened(or replacement stations on adjacent sites)- {{rws|Apperley Bridge}}, {{rws|Frizinghall}}, {{rws|Saltaire}}, {{rws|Steeton and Silsden}} and {{rws|Cononley}}\n* The line from Wakefield Kirkgate to Pontefract Monkhill closed in 1967 was reopened in 1992 with {{rws|Pontefract Tanshelf}} and two new stations.\n* {{rws|Swinton (South Yorkshire)}}, {{rws|Fitzwilliam}} and {{rws|Adwick}} were originally closed in 1967 but new stations were opened on adjacent sites.\n* Passenger service from Bradford to Huddersfield withdrawn in 1970 was reinstated in 2000 with reopening of {{rws|Brighouse}} station. In 2017 trains also served {{rws|Low Moor}} which was originally closed in 1965.\n\n===North West===\n* The route out of Manchester Central over the [[Cheshire Lines Committee]]'s Manchester South District Line has been reopened by [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]].  The line opened to [[St Werburgh's Road tram stop|St Werburgh's Road]] (via Chorlton) in July 2011 and was extended as far as [[East Didsbury tram stop|East Didsbury]] in May 2013.\n* On the Settle and Carlisle line most of the intermediate stations were closed in 1970 but regular passenger services were restored in 1986 to the following stations-{{rws|Horton-in-Ribblesdale}}, {{rws|Ribblehead}}, {{rws|Dent}}, {{rws|Garsdale}}, {{rws|Kirkby Stephen}}, {{rws|Langwathby}}, {{rws|Lazonby and Kirkoswald}} and {{rws|Armathwaite}}.\n\n===South Wales===\n* 32 new stations and four lines reopened within 20 miles (32&nbsp;km) of each other: [[Merthyr Line|Abercynon\u2013Aberdare]], [[Vale of Glamorgan Line|Barry\u2013Bridgend]] via {{Stnlnk|Llantwit Major}}, [[Maesteg Line|Bridgend\u2013Maesteg]] and the [[Ebbw Valley Railway]] via [[Newbridge railway station (Wales)|Newbridge]].\n* Stopping trains between Cardiff and Swansea re-introduced in 1992 serving reopened stations at Pontclun, Llanharan (opened 2007), Pencoed, Pyle, Baglan, Briton Ferry, Skewen and Llansamlet.\n\n===Scotland===\n* [[Glasgow Central Railway]] between {{Stnlnk|Rutherglen}} and {{Stnlnk|Stobcross}} was reopened in November 1979, establishing the [[Argyle Line]] connecting the Hamilton Circle to the [[North Clyde Line]]. Intermediate stations at {{Stnlnk|Dalmarnock}}, {{Stnlnk|Bridgeton}}, [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central Low Level]] and {{Stnlnk|Anderston}} were reopened, and a new station opened at {{Stnlnk|Argyle Street}}.\n* The [[Maryhill Line]] in [[Glasgow]] re-opened to stopping trains in 1993, which had ceased in the 1960s.  It is a suburban railway line linking central Glasgow ([[Queen Street railway station|Queen Street station]]) and [[Anniesland]] via [[Maryhill]].\n* The Argyle Line was extended in December 2005 when a four-mile (6.4&nbsp;km) section of the Mid Lanark Lines of the [[Caledonian Railway]] reopened, serving {{Stnlnk|Chatelherault}}, {{Stnlnk|Merryton}} and {{Stnlnk|Larkhall}}.<ref>[http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html SPT News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922170017/http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html |date=September 22, 2007 }}</ref>\n* The [[Glasgow and South Western Railway]]'s [[Paisley Canal line]] was closed to passengers in 1983.  The majority of the route reopened in 1990.\n* The [[Caledonian Railway]]'s [[Rutherglen and Coatbridge Railway]] closed to passengers in 1966. The majority of the route was reopened (with a revised terminus station at [[Whifflet railway station|Whifflet]]) in 1993.  \n* [[Croy Line|Stirling to Alloa]] reopened on 19 May 2008, providing a passenger service to Alloa on the route of the former Stirling-Dunfermline main line after a 40-year gap. This line had not been marked for closure by Beeching. The restored line also provides for freight onwards to Kincardine, and ultimately to Dunfermline by the slower, single track coastal route. Coal traffic has subsequently ceased with the closure of Longannet Power station.\n* {{Stnlnk|Laurencekirk}} on the [[Edinburgh to Aberdeen Line|mainline between Arbroath and Aberdeen]] was shut in 1967 but 42 years later in May 2009 it was reopened. This was the 77th new or reopened station in Scotland since 1970. Others include {{Stnlnk|Auchinleck}}, {{Stnlnk|Gretna Green}}, {{Stnlnk|Dyce}} and {{Stnlnk|New Cumnock}}, all of which had been closed in the mid-1960s. {{stnlink|Kintore}} is due to reopen in 2020.\n* The Edinburgh to Bathgate route opened in 1985, as single track. The line was doubled, electrified and extended beyond Bathgate to Airdrie in 2010, creating a fourth route between Edinburgh and Glasgow.\n* A 35-mile (56&nbsp;km) stretch of the former [[Waverley Route]] between [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Edinburgh]] and {{Stnlnk|Tweedbank}} via Galashiels [[Borders Railway|reopened]] on 6 September 2015. The closure of the line in 1969 had left the [[Scottish Borders]] without any rail links.\n*{{Stnlnk|Beauly}} (2006) and {{Stnlnk|Conon Bridge}} (2015) were reopened on the Far North Line between Inverness and Dingwall.\n\n==Heritage railways==\n{{see|List of British heritage and private railways}}\n\n==Further proposals==\n{{As of|2019||df=}}, proposals being pursued include:\n\n* Passenger service on the [[Portishead Railway]] stopped in 1964; plans are to reopen it as far as [[Portishead, Somerset|Portishead]], possibly in 2023.

Some commentators believe an intermediate station at Willenhall should have been included with the original reopening.\n* The [[Cotswold Line]] has been redoubled in places and [[Honeybourne railway station|Honeybourne]] station reopened.\n \n===North East===\n* On the lines from Leeds/Bradford to Skipton the following stations closed in 1965 have been reopened(or replacement stations on adjacent sites)- {{rws|Apperley Bridge}}, {{rws|Frizinghall}}, {{rws|Saltaire}}, {{rws|Steeton and Silsden}} and {{rws|Cononley}}\n* The line from Wakefield Kirkgate to Pontefract Monkhill closed in 1967 was reopened in 1992 with {{rws|Pontefract Tanshelf}} and two new stations.\n* {{rws|Swinton (South Yorkshire)}}, {{rws|Fitzwilliam}} and {{rws|Adwick}} were originally closed in 1967 but new stations were opened on adjacent sites.\n* Passenger service from Bradford to Huddersfield withdrawn in 1970 was reinstated in 2000 with reopening of |rws|Brighouse}}station. In 2017 trains also served {{rws|Low Moor}} which was originally closed in 1965.\n\n===North West===\n* The route out of Manchester Central over the [[Cheshire Lines Committee]]'s Manchester South District Line has been reopened by [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]].  The line opened to [[St Werburgh's Road tram stop|St Werburgh's Road]] (via Chorlton) in July 2011 and was extended as far as [[East Didsbury tram stop|East Didsbury]] in May 2013.\n* On the Settle and Carlisle line most of the intermediate stations were closed in 1970 but regular passenger services were restored in 1986 to the following stations-{{rws|Horton-in-Ribblesdale}}, {{rws|Ribblehead}}, {{rws|Dent}}, {{rws|Garsdale}}, {{rws|Kirkby Stephen}}, {{rws|Langwathby}}, {{rws|Lazonby and Kirkoswald}} and {{rws|Armathwaite}}.\n\n===South Wales===\n* 32 new stations and four lines reopened within 20 miles (32&nbsp;km) of each other: [[Merthyr Line|Abercynon\u2013Aberdare]], [[Vale of Glamorgan Line|Barry\u2013Bridgend]] via {{Stnlnk|Llantwit Major}}, [[Maesteg Line|Bridgend\u2013Maesteg]] and the [[Ebbw Valley Railway]] via [[Newbridge railway station (Wales)|Newbridge]].\n* Stopping trains between Cardiff and Swansea re-introduced in 1992 serving reopened stations at Pontclun, Llanharan (opened 2007), Pencoed, Pyle, Baglan, Briton Ferry, Skewen and Llansamlet.\n\n===Scotland===\n* [[Glasgow Central Railway]] between {{Stnlnk|Rutherglen}} and {{Stnlnk|Stobcross}} was reopened in November 1979, establishing the [[Argyle Line]] connecting the Hamilton Circle to the [[North Clyde Line]]. Intermediate stations at {{Stnlnk|Dalmarnock}}, {{Stnlnk|Bridgeton}}, [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central Low Level]] and {{Stnlnk|Anderston}} were reopened, and a new station opened at {{Stnlnk|Argyle Street}}.\n* The [[Maryhill Line]] in [[Glasgow]] re-opened to stopping trains in 1993, which had ceased in the 1960s.  It is a suburban railway line linking central Glasgow ([[Queen Street railway station|Queen Street station]]) and [[Anniesland]] via [[Maryhill]].\n* The Argyle Line was extended in December 2005 when a four-mile (6.4&nbsp;km) section of the Mid Lanark Lines of the [[Caledonian Railway]] reopened, serving {{Stnlnk|Chatelherault}}, {{Stnlnk|Merryton}} and {{Stnlnk|Larkhall}}.<ref>[http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html SPT News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922170017/http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html |date=September 22, 2007 }}</ref>\n* The [[Glasgow and South Western Railway]]'s [[Paisley Canal line]] was closed to passengers in 1983.  The majority of the route reopened in 1990.\n* The [[Caledonian Railway]]'s [[Rutherglen and Coatbridge Railway]] closed to passengers in 1966. The majority of the route was reopened (with a revised terminus station at [[Whifflet railway station|Whifflet]]) in 1993.  \n* [[Croy Line|Stirling to Alloa]] reopened on 19 May 2008, providing a passenger service to Alloa on the route of the former Stirling-Dunfermline main line after a 40-year gap. This line had not been marked for closure by Beeching. The restored line also provides for freight onwards to Kincardine, and ultimately to Dunfermline by the slower, single track coastal route. Coal traffic has subsequently ceased with the closure of Longannet Power station.\n* {{Stnlnk|Laurencekirk}} on the [[Edinburgh to Aberdeen Line|mainline between Arbroath and Aberdeen]] was shut in 1967 but 42 years later in May 2009 it was reopened. This was the 77th new or reopened station in Scotland since 1970. Others include {{Stnlnk|Auchinleck}}, {{Stnlnk|Gretna Green}}, {{Stnlnk|Dyce}} and {{Stnlnk|New Cumnock}}, all of which had been closed in the mid-1960s. {{stnlink|Kintore}} is due to reopen in 2020.\n* The Edinburgh to Bathgate route opened in 1985, as single track.

The Steering Committee consisted of Peter De Luca, Jamie McCormack, James Nicholls, John Ubaldi, Peter Clyne and Phil Barcellona. The club was founded in tradition of other prominent Old Xaverians sporting clubs, and is a member of the Old Xaverian Association and the Associated Old Boys Soccer Association, along with support of the school's administration and [[Italian community of Melbourne|Melbourne's Italian community]].\n\nThe club's inaugural season was to be ASFV Division 2 in 2002 that saw the club success. Three teams were fielded, with the seniors finishing first on the ladder, the reserve finishing second in the reserve league, and the thirds, then known as 'the Socials' finished fourth in the higher division of ASFV Division 1. The club's first-ever match was played at [[Xavier College]] against Arlaadi United in what would be a dominant 9\u20130 victory with a squad average age of 20.<ref>http://oxsc.com.au/seniors-round-01-2002/</ref> At the season's conclusion, the senior team had finished first on the ladder, with the reserves finishing third, and the thirds finishing fourth, creating a culture of both enjoyment but with success to follow. [[Bundesliga]] and [[Swiss Super League]] veteran [[Peter K\u00f6zle]]<ref name=\"Duisburgo 199495\">http://bundesliga90s.blogspot.com/2014/10/duisburgo-199495.html</ref> assisted in steering the club and its players in development, later earning him a spot in the club's team of the decade in 2012. At the annual general meeting, it was voted on and decided by the members that the club would pursue a license to compete in state league competitive football for 2003, and this was granted by [[Football Victoria]].<ref name=\"About Us\" />\n\n===First stint in State League football (2003\u20132006)===\nThe club's first season of state league would be the eastern conference of the tier seven league, then known as the '[[Victorian State League Division 4|Provisional League 3]]'. Both the senior and reserves teams were to compete in this league whilst thirds and veterans' teams were kept in the amateur leagues. With a mid table finish for 2003, the seniors finished second on the ladder for 2004, an outcome that had depended on the final game of the season against Endeavour Hills. The match finished in a 5-1 emphatic victory with future team of the decade forward Anthony De Luca scoring four to secure promotion.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2004PD3SER.html</ref> It would be the first and last achievement at Myrtle Park in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Balwyn]] before the club would move its home matches and administration to [[Hays Paddock]] in [[Kew East, Victoria|Kew East]], and training at Willsmere Park also in Kew East, which is still effective as of September 2019. The conclusion of the season also saw the introduction of the '[[Paul Trimboli]]' medal to be awarded to the highest goal scorer of the club across all teams, named after the former Xaverian and multiple [[National Soccer League]] championship winner, as well as a winner of multiple awards for the [[Socceroos]].\n\nAlthough setting newer and stronger foundations for the club by moving to Hays Paddock, 2005 saw a tougher year for the club but ended in relief when senior team narrowly avoided relegation in the last of the season. The first match at 'Hays' ended in a 2\u20132 draw with the future league winner Brandon Park on 9 April in round two. The second game would be the week after in round three on 16 April would be the first day of victory against fellow old boys club Old Melburnians, finishing in a 4\u20131 victory.<ref name=\"2005PD2SER\">http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2005PD2SER.html</ref> OXSC, already in the relegation zone of the ladder were to play the third-placed Lyndale United away who needed to win to be promoted. An against all odds 5-2 victory<ref name=\"2005PD2SER\" /> saw the club avoid relegation, and stop Lyndale from being promoted.<ref name=\"2005PD2SET\">http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2005PD2SET.html</ref> However, celebrations that day were kept minimal as two serious injuries had occurred in the reserves game prior. 2006 would be another tough year for the club with decision to withdraw veterans team and have the thirds compete in the state league as well. The senior battled hard during the season but managed to avoid relegation again after a 7\u20130 victory<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2006PD2SER.html</ref> over last place and to be relegated, Noble Park.<ref name=\"2006PD2SET\">http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2006PD2SET.html</ref> At the annual general meeting, despite being competitive enough as a club to remain in sixth tier knowing that there were multiple tiers below, it was decided that the club would make a full return to the amateur leagues with the intentions to return to state football at an unstated later date. This would not occur until late 2010.\n\n===Returning to Amateur football (2007\u20132010)===\nThe 2007 and 2008 seasons would prove to be years of resetting foundations of the club to ensure future success. 2007 saw all three teams, seniors, reserves and thirds all finishing mid table in their respective divisions. 2008 saw the both the seniors and reserves come close to first place with Middle Park being consistent in their dominant season, with thirds finishing mid table in their respective division. Success was finally brought to Hays Paddock in 2009 with both the seniors and reserves finish strongly in both divisions with new nemesis Middle Park coming close in both leagues. Coming off a broken leg in 2008, former [[Bradford City F.C.|Bradford City]] and [[Guiseley A.F.C.|Guiseley]] player Liam Flynn<ref>https://www.11v11.com/players/liam-flynn-39786/</ref> was crucial to the success of the season in scoring fifteen goals and providing thirteen assists in his sixteen appearances for the club, earning him both the Paul Trimboli medal and club best and fairest. The reserves were undefeated for the season with seventeen wins and five draws, with victory of round eighteen proving to be the sealing match of the season, again over nemesis Middle Park. The thirds continued to battle on finishing ninth for the season. 2010 saw the reserves team for the first time in the club's history win back-to-back championships, with the seniors and thirds both finishing mid table respectively. It was decided at the 2010 annual general meeting that the club would reapply for an FFV state league license, and was granted.\n\n===Returning to State League football and new foundations (2011\u20132012)===\nUpon successful application for a state football license, the club fielded three teams in various state league divisions. The club also reincarnated the veterans' team due to an abundance of players but was kept in the amateur league. Positive signs were present at the season's conclusions with the seniors and reserves both finishing third in their respective divisions of 'Men's Thirds 1' (then tier nine) and 'Men's Thirds 3' (then tier eleven) in the south-eastern conference. The thirds finished fourth for the state's fourteenth tier, then known as 'Men's Thirds 6' participating in the south-eastern conference, and the veterans, then nicknamed 'the ducks' finished fifth in the amateur division one afternoon reserves competition. It would be the last time as of 2019 that the club has fielded a team in the amateur divisions, as the club successfully entered the veterans team into the state league system for 2012. The new year would also be of a major step forward for the football club with the decision to establish a females' football department, with both senior & reserves teams having immediate entry into the state league system.\n\n2012 saw success and positive signs for the respective five sides within the club. The senior men's squad celebrated its third championship, being its first in-state league premiership in the Men's Thirds 1 league, following a close third-placed finished in 2011. The reserve men's and senior women's squads would both finish mid table within their respective leagues, while the men's third squad finished second in the Men's Thirds Division 5 North-Western conference. The veterans finished near the bottom but would create strong chemistry between the playing group as a result that would see tremendous success in the years to follow. Both the men's thirds and veterans would be promoted by three tiers following a reshuffle of teams in the state league competition.\n\nMid season, the club celebrated its ten-year anniversary at the prestigious [[Crown Melbourne#The Palladium Ballroom|Crown Palladium Ballroom]]. By this time, the club had achieved two titles and four runners-up achievements across its five teams with the men's' seniors and thirds teams to achieve their awards that year. The club announced its team of the decade featuring La Torre, Marazita, Butler, M Clyne, M Sette, Flynn, Fragale, Vittadello, Bramante, Ubaldi, A De Luca, D Clyne, Prossimo, Robilotta, Stella, and Voss. A second team due to the extensive global network created by the school, thus being named as the 'International team of the decade' for players living overseas or were born overseas. This list consisted of Brown, Hainsworth, Esnault, Ashe, Antoni, Kavanagh, Callahan, Kozle, De La Pava, Perelli, Flynn, Balaton, Ficici, Longo, Melvin, Tamanas, and Toomey. Current (as of 2019) vice-president Damian Cilmi and Luciano Fioravanti were also named as the respective coaches of the two teams.<ref name=\"About Us\" />\n\n===Success and promotions (2013\u20132016)===\nThe four seasons of 2013 through to 2016 would see five championships and four promotions across all five teams respectively. Across the men's reserves, thirds and veterans teams, the club saw championship achievement across all four years. The men's senior squad would start the era slowly by finishing mid table of the [[Victorian State League Division 5|Victorian State League Division 5 (tier seven)]] eastern conference for 2013. After learning from the hardships and disappointments of 2013, the team would finish second in 2014, resulting in promotion from [[Victorian State League Division 5|division five (tier seven)]] to [[Victorian State League Division 4|division four]] in the eastern conference. 2015 and 2016 would see mid table finishes for both seasons but would setup the team for a strong year in 2017.\n\nThe men's reserve squad would enjoy a successful era in this time, finishing in the top three in all four relevant seasons. The squad finished second twice in a row for the 2013 and 2014 seasons in the state league five reserve's division, but would finally win its first state league championship in 2015 by finishing first in the state league four reserve's division by one point ahead of [[University of Melbourne#Melbourne University Sport|University of Melbourne SC]].<ref name=\"ladder\">http://websites.sportstg.com/comp_info.cgi?c=1-8746-125754-340168-0&a=LADDER</ref> In 2016 a handful of player departures would negatively affect the squad which would also affect the thirds. Some unlucky results on the day despite valiant efforts would see the team fall to third for 2016. Despite being on equal points with Ringwood City, the victories of the reserve games would often be won more than two three goals which saw the team have goal difference as an asset as team finished ahead by fifteen goals.\n\nFollowing the first of multiple team and league reshuffles of the metropolitan league system by [[Football Federation Victoria]], the men's thirds squad would start and end the 2013\u20132016 era with difficulty but did win its first championship and achieve promotion in this time. After being promoted three tiers by default following the runners-up achievement for tier thirteen in 2012, the team would finish tier ten in second last of the south-eastern conference for 2013, then known as the 'Metropolitan League Four'. With a major reshuffling of the metro system occurring again in early 2014, the thirds were demoted back to tier thirteen, then renamed to its current name of 'Metropolitan League Six' but this time in the south-eastern conference. With roughly the same team from 2012 enduring hardships of 2013 in a higher division, the team would bond together and win its first and only championship, which is also the club's only championship in thirteenth tier to date. The resulting first-place finish would see the team be promoted to the twelfth tier, 'Metropolitan League Five' and would finish mid table in both the 2015 and 2016 seasons of the south-eastern conference.\n\n2013 would be the beginning of a successful time for the veterans team, seeing promotions & championships twice times after finishing in the top three in all seasons of the 2013\u20132016 era. Following the first of multiple metro reshuffles, early 2013 would see both the thirds & veterans be promoted three tiers by default. The veterans rose from tier fourteen, then known as 'Men's Thirds 6' of the north-western conference, to tier eleven now known as 'Metropolitan League Five', also in the north-western conference. Unlike the thirds that struggled with the promotion by default, the veterans would lead the league for most of the season and winning the championship in the last round. The team would beat second place Heidelberg Stars 3-0 at [[Hays Paddock]]<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=57176390&c=1-8746-125754-252419-0&pool=1</ref> ending the season six points above the stars,<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/comp_info.cgi?a=LADDER&client=1-8746-125754-252419-0&pool=1</ref> in what would be their first of three championships to date. 2014 would see the team physically promoted but technically remaining in the same tier following the introduction of the [[National Premier Leagues]] system. The higher level didn't stop the veterans from being competitive, with heart breaking but valiant efforts resulted in the team finishing second for 2014 by one goal on goal difference ahead of [[Preston Lions FC|Preston Lions]], and third for 2015. It was these results that drove the veterans team to win the eleventh tier championship, known as the Metropolitan League four in the north-western conference after three close attempts. First place was battled until the last round with Old Xaverians finishing on top by one point ahead of Hoppers Crossing. With both teams winning their last two games, the veterans' four-point lead was dealt a blow in round sixteen against [[University of Melbourne#Melbourne University Sport|University of Melbourne SC]] after a 0-1 loss at [[Princes Park, Carlton|Princes Park]].<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=66850640&c=1-8746-125754-392654-0&pool=1</ref> The ultimate final difference that won the title for the veterans came the week before in round fifteen being out of their control, with University drawing 2-2 with Hoppers Crossing at Hoppers' home ground.<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=66859563&c=1-8746-125754-392654-0&pool=1</ref> One on one, Old Xaverians drew<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=66861410&c=1-8746-125754-392654-0&pool=1</ref> and lost<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=66872840&c=1-8746-125754-392654-0&pool=1</ref> to Hoppers during the regular season but with luck on the veteran's side, it was the match drawn thanks to University that made the difference, resulting in promotion for the second time in three years.\n\n===Mixed results and team changes (2017\u20132018)===\nThe 2017-2018 era saw success with another championship, three runners-up awards resulting in two promotions throughout the football club. The era would also saw the establishment of the women's reserve squad, but also the temporary closing of both the men's thirds and veterans squads due to player shortages despite award-winning results between the two. The seniors and reserve teams would competitive in this era but came with no reward. The best result achieved was the seniors finishing third in 2017 of the [[Victorian State League Division 4]]<ref>https://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/east/sport/croydon-city-arrows-mens-and-womens-teams-are-all-pressing-for-the-highest-rungs-of-ladder/news-story/dd5f7b0c903eebca55faaadc373d4ec7</ref> eastern conference but would then finish sixth in 2018, whilst the reserves finished fourth in the reserve division for both relevant seasons. The two teams of the club were both invited to participate in the trial of the new [[Video assistant referee]] for the [[A-League]] at [[Docklands Stadium]] midway through the season.<ref>https://www.a-league.com.au/news/hyundai-a-league-first-use-video-assistant-referees</ref> It was the success of thirds, veterans, senior & reserve women squads that would make the era rather positively memorable.\n\nThe thirds for 2017 were rezoned to the north-western conference from the south-east of the Metropolitan League five following due to location clashes of other promoted and relegated teams. This would prove to a breath of fresh air for the team two mid table finishes in 2015 and 2016 that would result in a close second-place finish behind Hume United. Despite some unlucky results on multiples match days, the thirds made a strong resurgence towards the end of the season but the ultimate factors would consist losing to Hume away 5\u20132 on round fifteen,<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=68972605&c=1-8746-125754-440894-0&pool=1</ref> and a close but unlucky 3-3 draw earlier to Gisborne in round ten.<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=68972981&c=1-8746-125754-440894-0&pool=1</ref> At the season's conclusion, it would be decided to discontinue the thirds team until further notice due to an insufficient number of players throughout the club to field four men's teams, being that there would only be enough players to sufficiently field three. The club logically voted to return the tier twelve license belonging to the thirds as the veterans team license was to be promoted from tier ten to tier nine for 2018.\n\nThe men's veterans squad would continue its successful period following on from 2013 by winning back-to-back championships and promotions for the first time ever in the club's history. Following the 2016 championship of Metropolitan League four north-west, the veterans would finish first again in league three, still within the north-western conference in what would be a close season in which every point would could count. Old Xaverians finished first with forty-six points followed by [[RMIT FC]] on forty-four then Moreland United on forty-two.<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/comp_info.cgi?c=1-8746-125754-441065-0&pool=1&a=LADDER</ref> The veterans would beat RMIT early in the season at [[Hays Paddock]] 2\u20130 in round three, but heavily underestimated Moreland in losing 3\u20130 in round eleven at home<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=68928633&c=1-8746-125754-441065-0&pool=1</ref> with the early loss to Moreland away had clearly not sent the right message. The second loss considerably threatened first place chances as at that point of the season it had become clear that the top three would be battled between Old Xaverians, RMIT and Moreland. Despite both losses of the season being against Moreland, Old Xaverians would recommence their undefeated streak of the season with the three season-defining factors being the round twelve 3\u20133 draw to RMIT away in the week after,<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=68942884&c=1-8746-125754-441065-0&pool=1</ref> Moreland losing 1\u20132 to Coonan Hills at home in round sixteen,<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=68928914&c=1-8746-125754-441065-0&pool=1</ref> and RMIT drawing with fourth-placed Glenroy Lions at home in round fourteen.<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=68940955&c=1-8746-125754-441065-0&pool=1</ref> The top three finishing era would come to an end in 2018 with the veterans being competitive but narrowly finishing fourth after being promoted to League two north-west. At the conclusion of the season, it was decided to temporarily discontinue the veterans team until further notice, following more player departures throughout all three men's teams with the remaining players being promoted to reserve and senior teams respectively.\n\nThe 2017 era started with a sense of optimism for the women's department following the establishment of the reserve team in meeting the demands of multiple player signups. The senior team showed valiance in 2016 after narrowly avoiding relegation in their first season in State League one following their promotion in 2015. Despite strong victories throughout the season, [[Croydon City Arrows SC|Croydon City Arrows]] proved too consistent with the round sixteen 1\u20132 defeat at home<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=68936444&c=1-8746-125754-441026-0&pool=1</ref> ultimately defining the season. However, the valiant efforts were enough for the seniors to be promoted to State League one, the highest level of state league football below the [[National Premier Leagues Victoria Women|National Premier Leagues female system]]. The transition from league two to league one would be smoother to that of the 2016 promotion with team finishing mid table for 2018. The women's reserve squad would commence their inaugural campaign in the eastern conference of State League four, not the league one reserves, and would make an immediate impact.\nA strong campaign would see the reserves be serious championship and promotion contenders, but it would be bad luck loss in round seventeen<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=69143514&c=1-8746-125754-440953-0&pool=1</ref> that would make the team finish second, two points behind Old Trinity Grammarians. It would be the only time to date as of 2019 that the reserves team would play in a separate division all together as the club's request to move the team into the reserves division of State League one was granted. The team would adjust well in 2018 finishing the season in fifth.\n\n===Present day (2019\u2013present)===\nThe year of 2019 would a year of sporadic results but did have its positives. The club again would embark on a new endeavor by establishing its first-ever juniors academy for boys and girls, backed by [[Football Federation Australia|Football Federation Australia's]] junior football incentive, the 'Miniroos'.<ref>http://oxsc.com.au/juniorsprogram/</ref> The club was able to establish two mixed-gender junior teams and be based at [[Hays Paddock]] with backing from the [[City of Boroondara]] council. In senior football, both the men and women's results varied mainly due to unlucky match day outcomes.\n\nAt the conclusion of the 2018 season, the club was informed that the men's senior and reserve teams may be rezoned to the northern conference of [[Victorian State League Division 4|Victorian State League four]] due to the locations of promoted and related clubs from divisions three and five respectively, and this became a reality in 2019. With an unfortunate difficult preseason,<ref>https://baysidenews.com.au/2019/03/18/let-the-state-league-battle-begin/</ref><ref>http://www.mpnews.com.au/2019/02/11/langy-faces-citys-young-stars/</ref> The change from east to north would bring two unexpected culture changes, consisting of fiercer opponents and smaller grounds to play than that of the eastern conference home grounds and player attitudes. The senior men's team would finish eighth out of twelve, which could've so easily been fifth place with unlucky second half losses to [[Brunswick Zebras FC|Brunswick Zebras]],<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=70128881&c=1-8746-0-514506-0&pool=1</ref> Heidelberg Eagles,<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=70128869&c=1-8746-0-514506-0&pool=1</ref> Plenty Valley Lions,<ref>https://www.starweekly.com.au/sports/winning-signs-plenty-valley-lions/</ref><ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=70128921&c=1-8746-0-514506-0&pool=1</ref> and [[Northern Falcons FC|Northern Falcons]].<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=70130804&c=1-8746-0-514506-0&pool=1</ref> The reserves men squad would do it tougher with both injuries and second half losses pulling the team down to tenth out of twelve. The women's senior team would again comfortably<ref>https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/6320370/ballarat-city-girls-to-battle-top-side-melbourne-university/</ref> finish mid-table in fifth position after making a strong start to the season,<ref>https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/6003935/curtains-charges-out-to-start-strong-in-2019/</ref><ref>https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/6095942/old-xaverians-late-flurry-sinks-ballarat-city-women/</ref> while the reserves fought bravely but were affected by unlucky results on the day and finished last.\n\nFollowing a double brutal encounter with unruly players from Brunswick Zebras away in the second last round for both the seniors and more particularly the reserves, the two teams would end their tough seasons with smiles in the last round against [[La Trobe University#Athletics|La Trobe University]] at [[Hays Paddock]]. The reserves match saw the [[Climate of Melbourne]] at its finest with the culturally popular term \"four seasons in one day\" physically becoming reality before and during the game. Whilst both teams were warming up the sun was shining, but eventuated to heavy rain by kick off. By half time the sun was shining again but became overcast and windy by full-time. Whilst the weather was constantly changing, the end-to-end attacking game saw the score be level 3\u20133 at half time. La Trobe had taken the lead within ninety seconds after kick off but within another six minutes, Old Xaverians would draw level from a corner. La Trobe would take the lead another two times in the first half, only for Old Xaverians to equalize both times almost immediately. The start of the second half saw the same attacking tempo from both teams, with the home team breaking the deadlock first ten minutes after the restart making the scores 4\u20133. Like in the first half, it would be La Trobe who would equalize almost immediately with an unmarked long shot from outside the eighteen yard box leveling the scores at 4\u20134. For the next twenty-five minutes, there were extremely close chances at both ends with the respective goal keepers making tremendous saves, including a top right hand corner save from a La Trobe free kick on the edge of the Old Xaverians eighteen yard box. Following two substitutions from Old Xaverians and one from La Trobe towards the last ten minutes, the home side scored the mathematically winning goal that would also be the striker's one hundredth goal in his time with club. The same striker would score in the last minute to end the game 6-4<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=70129464&c=1-8746-125754-514463-0&pool=1</ref> bringing his career total to 101 goals on what would also be his last game for the club. Another reserve player and two more senior players would declare the round as their last games for the club until further notice. The seniors would also take part in a heavily attacking end-to-end contest and would win 2\u20131 to end the weekend with maximum points for the men's department.<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=70128821&c=1-8746-125754-514506-0&pool=1</ref>\n\nThe new decade saw the club change its logo for the first time in history, with its vision of aligning itself with the logos of the athletics club, cricket club, and the [[Old Xaverians Football Club|football club]]. The club also discontinued its usage of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] kits, and reverted to [[Adidas]] for the 2020, 2021 and 2022 seasons. The men's squad commenced their [[2020 Football Victoria season|2020 campaign]] with the senior team losing 1\u20132 in the first round of the [[2020 FFA Cup]] against [[La Trobe University#Athletics|La Trobe University]] at [[FC Bulleen Lions|David Barro Stadium]]. The first round of the league season for both the senior and reserve squads was to be against [[Northern Falcons FC|Northern Falcons]] on 21 March 2020, however [[Football Victoria]] suspended all soccer competitions and related events due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>https://www.footballvictoria.com.au/news/football-victoria-postpones-all-competitions-until-april-14</ref>\n\n==Home venues==\n[[File:oldxaviersc27april2019.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Old Xaverians SC (left) and [[Plenty Valley Lions FC]] (right) observing a minute silence before a [[Victorian State League Division 4]] Reserves match at [[Hays Paddock]], 27 April 2019]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;margin-left:1em;float:right\"\n|-\n!Period\n!Home Ground\n!Suburb\n|-\n|2002\n|[[Xavier College]]\n|[[Kew, Victoria|Kew]]\n|-\n|2002\n|H A Smith Reserve\n|[[Hawthorn, Victoria|Hawthorn]]\n|-\n|2002\u20132004\n|Myrtle Park\n|[[Balwyn North, Victoria|Balwyn North]]\n|-\n|2005\u2013Present\n|[[Hays Paddock]]\n|[[Kew East, Victoria|Kew East]]\n|}\n\nUpon the founding of the club, [[Xavier College|the school]] offered the football club temporary use of its sporting facilities until the club could gain tenancy of a ground of its own. After winning their inaugural game at the school grounds, the club temporarily moved to H A Smith Reserve in [[Hawthorn, Victoria|Hawthorn]], sharing with Old Scotch. After a handful of games at the [[Glenferrie Road]] site, the club would finish the 2002 ASFV 2 season at Mrtyle Park in [[Balwyn North, Victoria|Balwyn North]], where it would stay for another two years as the club's first permanent home ground. Upon leaving the Balwyn North park at the conclusion of the 2004 [[Victorian State League Division 5|Provisional League Three]] season, the site had seen Old Xaverians celebrate two championships and two promotions.\n\nThe start of the 2005 season would see new beginnings for the club in moving to [[Hays Paddock]], with newer facilities and being the only state league club to be based at the ground. Since moving to Hays, the club has won nine championships and achieved multiple promotions across all six football teams. Season 2020 will mark the club's fifteen-year anniversary of being at the Kew East site, where the last nine championships have been achieved at.\n\n==Colours and kit evolution==\nThe colours of the club consist of black, red and white, resembling the logo of [[Xavier College]]. The home kit is primarily unique to that of the school's, with the away kit primarily being a fluorescent yellow short, often with black shorts & socks.

The club fields both senior' and reserves' teams for men & women, and operates a junior academy under license from [[Football Victoria]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://websites.sportstg.com/club_info.cgi?c=1-8746-125754-478181-18543029|title=Old Xaverians SC|website=SportsTG}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:oldxaverianssc.jpeg|right|thumb|400px|Old Xaverians SC inaugural logo (2002\u20132019)]] -->\n===Establishment and debut season (2001\u20132002)===\nThe Old Xaverians Soccer Club was established in early 2002 following a meeting of [[Xavier College]] alumni in November 2001. The Steering Committee consisted of Peter De Luca, Jamie McCormack, James Nicholls, John Ubaldi, Peter Clyne and Phil Barcellona. The club was founded in tradition of other prominent Old Xaverians sporting clubs, and is a member of the Old Xaverian Association and the Associated Old Boys Soccer Association, along with support of the school's administration and [[Italian community of Melbourne|Melbourne's Italian community]].\n\nThe club's inaugural season was to be ASFV Division 2 in 2002 that saw the club success. Three teams were fielded, with the seniors finishing first on the ladder, the reserve finishing second in the reserve league, and the thirds, then known as 'the Socials' finished fourth in the higher division of ASFV Division 1. The club's first-ever match was played at [[Xavier College]] against Arlaadi United in what would be a dominant 9\u20130 victory with a squad average age of 20.<ref>http://oxsc.com.au/seniors-round-01-2002/</ref> At the season's conclusion, the senior team had finished first on the ladder, with the reserves finishing third, and the thirds finishing fourth, creating a culture of both enjoyment but with success to follow. [[Bundesliga]] and [[Swiss Super League]] veteran [[Peter K\u00f6zle]]<ref name=\"Duisburgo 199495\">http://bundesliga90s.blogspot.com/2014/10/duisburgo-199495.html</ref> assisted in steering the club and its players in development, later earning him a spot in the club's team of the decade in 2012. At the annual general meeting, it was voted on and decided by the members that the club would pursue a license to compete in state league competitive football for 2003, and this was granted by [[Football Victoria]].<ref name=\"About Us\" />\n\n===First stint in State League football (2003\u20132006)===\nThe club's first season of state league would be the eastern conference of the tier seven league, then known as the '[[Victorian State League Division 4|Provisional League 3]]'. Both the senior and reserves teams were to compete in this league whilst thirds and veterans' teams were kept in the amateur leagues. With a mid table finish for 2003, the seniors finished second on the ladder for 2004, an outcome that had depended on the final game of the season against Endeavour Hills. The match finished in a 5-1 emphatic victory with future team of the decade forward Anthony De Luca scoring four to secure promotion.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2004PD3SER.html</ref> It would be the first and last achievement at Myrtle Park in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Balwyn]] before the club would move its home matches and administration to [[Hays Paddock]] in [[Kew East, Victoria|Kew East]], and training at Willsmere Park also in Kew East, which is still effective as of September 2019. The conclusion of the season also saw the introduction of the '[[Paul Trimboli]]' medal to be awarded to the highest goal scorer of the club across all teams, named after the former Xaverian and multiple [[National Soccer League]] championship winner, as well as a winner of multiple awards for the [[Socceroos]].\n\nAlthough setting newer and stronger foundations for the club by moving to Hays Paddock, 2005 saw a tougher year for the club but ended in relief when senior team narrowly avoided relegation in the last of the season. The first match at 'Hays' ended in a 2\u20132 draw with the future league winner Brandon Park on 9 April in round two. The second game would be the week after in round three on 16 April would be the first day of victory against fellow old boys club Old Melburnians, finishing in a 4\u20131 victory.<ref name=\"2005PD2SER\">http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2005PD2SER.html</ref> OXSC, already in the relegation zone of the ladder were to play the third-placed Lyndale United away who needed to win to be promoted. An against all odds 5-2 victory<ref name=\"2005PD2SER\" /> saw the club avoid relegation, and stop Lyndale from being promoted.<ref name=\"2005PD2SET\">http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2005PD2SET.html</ref> However, celebrations that day were kept minimal as two serious injuries had occurred in the reserves game prior. 2006 would be another tough year for the club with decision to withdraw veterans team and have the thirds compete in the state league as well. The senior battled hard during the season but managed to avoid relegation again after a 7\u20130 victory<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2006PD2SER.html</ref> over last place and to be relegated, Noble Park.<ref name=\"2006PD2SET\">http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2006PD2SET.html</ref> At the annual general meeting, despite being competitive enough as a club to remain in sixth tier knowing that there were multiple tiers below, it was decided that the club would make a full return to the amateur leagues with the intentions to return to state football at an unstated later date. This would not occur until late 2010.\n\n===Returning to Amateur football (2007\u20132010)===\nThe 2007 and 2008 seasons would prove to be years of resetting foundations of the club to ensure future success. 2007 saw all three teams, seniors, reserves and thirds all finishing mid table in their respective divisions. 2008 saw the both the seniors and reserves come close to first place with Middle Park being consistent in their dominant season, with thirds finishing mid table in their respective division. Success was finally brought to Hays Paddock in 2009 with both the seniors and reserves finish strongly in both divisions with new nemesis Middle Park coming close in both leagues. Coming off a broken leg in 2008, former [[Bradford City F.C.|Bradford City]] and [[Guiseley A.F.C.|Guiseley]] player Liam Flynn<ref>https://www.11v11.com/players/liam-flynn-39786/</ref> was crucial to the success of the season in scoring fifteen goals and providing thirteen assists in his sixteen appearances for the club, earning him both the Paul Trimboli medal and club best and fairest. The reserves were undefeated for the season with seventeen wins and five draws, with victory of round eighteen proving to be the sealing match of the season, again over nemesis Middle Park. The thirds continued to battle on finishing ninth for the season. 2010 saw the reserves team for the first time in the club's history win back-to-back championships, with the seniors and thirds both finishing mid table respectively. It was decided at the 2010 annual general meeting that the club would reapply for an FFV state league license, and was granted.\n\n===Returning to State League football and new foundations (2011\u20132012)===\nUpon successful application for a state football license, the club fielded three teams in various state league divisions. The club also reincarnated the veterans' team due to an abundance of players but was kept in the amateur league. Positive signs were present at the season's conclusions with the seniors and reserves both finishing third in their respective divisions of 'Men's Thirds 1' (then tier nine) and 'Men's Thirds 3' (then tier eleven) in the south-eastern conference. The thirds finished fourth for the state's fourteenth tier, then known as 'Men's Thirds 6' participating in the south-eastern conference, and the veterans, then nicknamed 'the ducks' finished fifth in the amateur division one afternoon reserves competition. It would be the last time as of 2019 that the club has fielded a team in the amateur divisions, as the club successfully entered the veterans team into the state league system for 2012. The new year would also be of a major step forward for the football club with the decision to establish a females' football department, with both senior & reserves teams having immediate entry into the state league system.\n\n2012 saw success and positive signs for the respective five sides within the club. The senior men's squad celebrated its third championship, being its first in-state league premiership in the Men's Thirds 1 league, following a close third-placed finished in 2011. The reserve men's and senior women's squads would both finish mid table within their respective leagues, while the men's third squad finished second in the Men's Thirds Division 5 North-Western conference. The veterans finished near the bottom but would create strong chemistry between the playing group as a result that would see tremendous success in the years to follow. Both the men's thirds and veterans would be promoted by three tiers following a reshuffle of teams in the state league competition.\n\nMid season, the club celebrated its ten-year anniversary at the prestigious [[Crown Melbourne#The Palladium Ballroom|Crown Palladium Ballroom]]. By this time, the club had achieved two titles and four runners-up achievements across its five teams with the men's' seniors and thirds teams to achieve their awards that year. The club announced its team of the decade featuring La Torre, Marazita, Butler, M Clyne, M Sette, Flynn, Fragale, Vittadello, Bramante, Ubaldi, A De Luca, D Clyne, Prossimo, Robilotta, Stella, and Voss. A second team due to the extensive global network created by the school, thus being named as the 'International team of the decade' for players living overseas or were born overseas. This list consisted of Brown, Hainsworth, Esnault, Ashe, Antoni, Kavanagh, Callahan, Kozle, De La Pava, Perelli, Flynn, Balaton, Ficici, Longo, Melvin, Tamanas, and Toomey. Current (as of 2019) vice-president Damian Cilmi and Luciano Fioravanti were also named as the respective coaches of the two teams.<ref name=\"About Us\" />\n\n===Success and promotions (2013\u20132016)===\nThe four seasons of 2013 through to 2016 would see five championships and four promotions across all five teams respectively. Across the men's reserves, thirds and veterans teams, the club saw championship achievement across all four years. The men's senior squad would start the era slowly by finishing mid table of the [[Victorian State League Division 5|Victorian State League Division 5 (tier seven)]] eastern conference for 2013. After learning from the hardships and disappointments of 2013, the team would finish second in 2014, resulting in promotion from [[Victorian State League Division 5|division five (tier seven)]] to [[Victorian State League Division 4|division four]] in the eastern conference. 2015 and 2016 would see mid table finishes for both seasons but would setup the team for a strong year in 2017.\n\nThe men's reserve squad would enjoy a successful era in this time, finishing in the top three in all four relevant seasons. The squad finished second twice in a row for the 2013 and 2014 seasons in the state league five reserve's division, but would finally win its first state league championship in 2015 by finishing first in the state league four reserve's division by one point ahead of [[University of Melbourne#Melbourne University Sport|University of Melbourne SC]].<ref name=\"ladder\">http://websites.sportstg.com/comp_info.cgi?c=1-8746-125754-340168-0&a=LADDER</ref> In 2016 a handful of player departures would negatively affect the squad which would also affect the thirds. Some unlucky results on the day despite valiant efforts would see the team fall to third for 2016. Despite being on equal points with Ringwood City, the victories of the reserve games would often be won more than two three goals which saw the team have goal difference as an asset as team finished ahead by fifteen goals.\n\nFollowing the first of multiple team and league reshuffles of the metropolitan league system by [[Football Federation Victoria]], the men's thirds squad would start and end the 2013\u20132016 era with difficulty but did win its first championship and achieve promotion in this time. After being promoted three tiers by default following the runners-up achievement for tier thirteen in 2012, the team would finish tier ten in second last of the south-eastern conference for 2013, then known as the 'Metropolitan League Four'. With a major reshuffling of the metro system occurring again in early 2014, the thirds were demoted back to tier thirteen, then renamed to its current name of 'Metropolitan League Six' but this time in the south-eastern conference. With roughly the same team from 2012 enduring hardships of 2013 in a higher division, the team would bond together and win its first and only championship, which is also the club's only championship in thirteenth tier to date. The resulting first-place finish would see the team be promoted to the twelfth tier, 'Metropolitan League Five' and would finish mid table in both the 2015 and 2016 seasons of the south-eastern conference.\n\n2013 would be the beginning of a successful time for the veterans team, seeing promotions & championships twice times after finishing in the top three in all seasons of the 2013\u20132016 era. Following the first of multiple metro reshuffles, early 2013 would see both the thirds & veterans be promoted three tiers by default. The veterans rose from tier fourteen, then known as 'Men's Thirds 6' of the north-western conference, to tier eleven now known as 'Metropolitan League Five', also in the north-western conference. Unlike the thirds that struggled with the promotion by default, the veterans would lead the league for most of the season and winning the championship in the last round. The team would beat second place Heidelberg Stars 3-0 at [[Hays Paddock]]<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=57176390&c=1-8746-125754-252419-0&pool=1</ref> ending the season six points above the stars,<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/comp_info.cgi?a=LADDER&client=1-8746-125754-252419-0&pool=1</ref> in what would be their first of three championships to date. 2014 would see the team physically promoted but technically remaining in the same tier following the introduction of the [[National Premier Leagues]] system. The higher level didn't stop the veterans from being competitive, with heart breaking but valiant efforts resulted in the team finishing second for 2014 by one goal on goal difference ahead of [[Preston Lions FC|Preston Lions]], and third for 2015. It was these results that drove the veterans team to win the eleventh tier championship, known as the Metropolitan League four in the north-western conference after three close attempts. First place was battled until the last round with Old Xaverians finishing on top by one point ahead of Hoppers Crossing. With both teams winning their last two games, the veterans' four-point lead was dealt a blow in round sixteen against [[University of Melbourne#Melbourne University Sport|University of Melbourne SC]] after a 0-1 loss at [[Princes Park, Carlton|Princes Park]].<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=66850640&c=1-8746-125754-392654-0&pool=1</ref> The ultimate final difference that won the title for the veterans came the week before in round fifteen being out of their control, with University drawing 2-2 with Hoppers Crossing at Hoppers' home ground.<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=66859563&c=1-8746-125754-392654-0&pool=1</ref> One on one, Old Xaverians drew<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=66861410&c=1-8746-125754-392654-0&pool=1</ref> and lost<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=66872840&c=1-8746-125754-392654-0&pool=1</ref> to Hoppers during the regular season but with luck on the veteran's side, it was the match drawn thanks to University that made the difference, resulting in promotion for the second time in three years.\n\n===Mixed results and team changes (2017\u20132018)===\nThe 2017-2018 era saw success with another championship, three runners-up awards resulting in two promotions throughout the football club. The era would also saw the establishment of the women's reserve squad, but also the temporary closing of both the men's thirds and veterans squads due to player shortages despite award-winning results between the two. The seniors and reserve teams would competitive in this era but came with no reward. The best result achieved was the seniors finishing third in 2017 of the [[Victorian State League Division 4]]<ref>https://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/east/sport/croydon-city-arrows-mens-and-womens-teams-are-all-pressing-for-the-highest-rungs-of-ladder/news-story/dd5f7b0c903eebca55faaadc373d4ec7</ref> eastern conference but would then finish sixth in 2018, whilst the reserves finished fourth in the reserve division for both relevant seasons. The two teams of the club were both invited to participate in the trial of the new [[Video assistant referee]] for the [[A-League]] at [[Docklands Stadium]] midway through the season.<ref>https://www.a-league.com.au/news/hyundai-a-league-first-use-video-assistant-referees</ref> It was the success of thirds, veterans, senior & reserve women squads that would make the era rather positively memorable.\n\nThe thirds for 2017 were rezoned to the north-western conference from the south-east of the Metropolitan League five following due to location clashes of other promoted and relegated teams. This would prove to a breath of fresh air for the team two mid table finishes in 2015 and 2016 that would result in a close second-place finish behind Hume United. Despite some unlucky results on multiples match days, the thirds made a strong resurgence towards the end of the season but the ultimate factors would consist losing to Hume away 5\u20132 on round fifteen,<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=68972605&c=1-8746-125754-440894-0&pool=1</ref> and a close but unlucky 3-3 draw earlier to Gisborne in round ten.<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=68972981&c=1-8746-125754-440894-0&pool=1</ref> At the season's conclusion, it would be decided to discontinue the thirds team until further notice due to an insufficient number of players throughout the club to field four men's teams, being that there would only be enough players to sufficiently field three. The club logically voted to return the tier twelve license belonging to the thirds as the veterans team license was to be promoted from tier ten to tier nine for 2018.\n\nThe men's veterans squad would continue its successful period following on from 2013 by winning back-to-back championships and promotions for the first time ever in the club's history. Following the 2016 championship of Metropolitan League four north-west, the veterans would finish first again in league three, still within the north-western conference in what would be a close season in which every point would could count. Old Xaverians finished first with forty-six points followed by [[RMIT FC]] on forty-four then Moreland United on forty-two.<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/comp_info.cgi?c=1-8746-125754-441065-0&pool=1&a=LADDER</ref> The veterans would beat RMIT early in the season at [[Hays Paddock]] 2\u20130 in round three, but heavily underestimated Moreland in losing 3\u20130 in round eleven at home<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=68928633&c=1-8746-125754-441065-0&pool=1</ref> with the early loss to Moreland away had clearly not sent the right message. The second loss considerably threatened first place chances as at that point of the season it had become clear that the top three would be battled between Old Xaverians, RMIT and Moreland. Despite both losses of the season being against Moreland, Old Xaverians would recommence their undefeated streak of the season with the three season-defining factors being the round twelve 3\u20133 draw to RMIT away in the week after,<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=68942884&c=1-8746-125754-441065-0&pool=1</ref> Moreland losing 1\u20132 to Coonan Hills at home in round sixteen,<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=68928914&c=1-8746-125754-441065-0&pool=1</ref> and RMIT drawing with fourth-placed Glenroy Lions at home in round fourteen.<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=68940955&c=1-8746-125754-441065-0&pool=1</ref> The top three finishing era would come to an end in 2018 with the veterans being competitive but narrowly finishing fourth after being promoted to League two north-west. At the conclusion of the season, it was decided to temporarily discontinue the veterans team until further notice, following more player departures throughout all three men's teams with the remaining players being promoted to reserve and senior teams respectively.\n\nThe 2017 era started with a sense of optimism for the women's department following the establishment of the reserve team in meeting the demands of multiple player signups. The senior team showed valiance in 2016 after narrowly avoiding relegation in their first season in State League one following their promotion in 2015. Despite strong victories throughout the season, [[Croydon City Arrows SC|Croydon City Arrows]] proved too consistent with the round sixteen 1\u20132 defeat at home<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=68936444&c=1-8746-125754-441026-0&pool=1</ref> ultimately defining the season. However, the valiant efforts were enough for the seniors to be promoted to State League one, the highest level of state league football below the [[National Premier Leagues Victoria Women|National Premier Leagues female system]]. The transition from league two to league one would be smoother to that of the 2016 promotion with team finishing mid table for 2018. The women's reserve squad would commence their inaugural campaign in the eastern conference of State League four, not the league one reserves, and would make an immediate impact.\nA strong campaign would see the reserves be serious championship and promotion contenders, but it would be bad luck loss in round seventeen<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=69143514&c=1-8746-125754-440953-0&pool=1</ref> that would make the team finish second, two points behind Old Trinity Grammarians. It would be the only time to date as of 2019 that the reserves team would play in a separate division all together as the club's request to move the team into the reserves division of State League one was granted. The team would adjust well in 2018 finishing the season in fifth.\n\n===Present day (2019\u2013present)===\nThe year of 2019 would a year of sporadic results but did have its positives. The club again would embark on a new endeavor by establishing its first-ever juniors academy for boys and girls, backed by [[Football Federation Australia|Football Federation Australia's]] junior football incentive, the 'Miniroos'.<ref>http://oxsc.com.au/juniorsprogram/</ref> The club was able to establish two mixed-gender junior teams and be based at [[Hays Paddock]] with backing from the [[City of Boroondara]] council. In senior football, both the men and women's results varied mainly due to unlucky match day outcomes.\n\nAt the conclusion of the 2018 season, the club was informed that the men's senior and reserve teams may be rezoned to the northern conference of [[Victorian State League Division 4|Victorian State League four]] due to the locations of promoted and related clubs from divisions three and five respectively, and this became a reality in 2019. With an unfortunate difficult preseason,<ref>https://baysidenews.com.au/2019/03/18/let-the-state-league-battle-begin/</ref><ref>http://www.mpnews.com.au/2019/02/11/langy-faces-citys-young-stars/</ref> The change from east to north would bring two unexpected culture changes, consisting of fiercer opponents and smaller grounds to play than that of the eastern conference home grounds and player attitudes. The senior men's team would finish eighth out of twelve, which could've so easily been fifth place with unlucky second half losses to [[Brunswick Zebras FC|Brunswick Zebras]],<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=70128881&c=1-8746-0-514506-0&pool=1</ref> Heidelberg Eagles,<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=70128869&c=1-8746-0-514506-0&pool=1</ref> Plenty Valley Lions,<ref>https://www.starweekly.com.au/sports/winning-signs-plenty-valley-lions/</ref><ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=70128921&c=1-8746-0-514506-0&pool=1</ref> and [[Northern Falcons FC|Northern Falcons]].<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=70130804&c=1-8746-0-514506-0&pool=1</ref> The reserves men squad would do it tougher with both injuries and second half losses pulling the team down to tenth out of twelve. The women's senior team would again comfortably<ref>https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/6320370/ballarat-city-girls-to-battle-top-side-melbourne-university/</ref> finish mid-table in fifth position after making a strong start to the season,<ref>https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/6003935/curtains-charges-out-to-start-strong-in-2019/</ref><ref>https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/6095942/old-xaverians-late-flurry-sinks-ballarat-city-women/</ref> while the reserves fought bravely but were affected by unlucky results on the day and finished last.\n\nFollowing a double brutal encounter with unruly players from Brunswick Zebras away in the second last round for both the seniors and more particularly the reserves, the two teams would end their tough seasons with smiles in the last round against [[La Trobe University#Athletics|La Trobe University]] at [[Hays Paddock]]. The reserves match saw the [[Climate of Melbourne]] at its finest with the culturally popular term \"four seasons in one day\" physically becoming reality before and during the game. Whilst both teams were warming up the sun was shining, but eventuated to heavy rain by kick off. By half time the sun was shining again but became overcast and windy by full-time. Whilst the weather was constantly changing, the end-to-end attacking game saw the score be level 3\u20133 at half time. La Trobe had taken the lead within ninety seconds after kick off but within another six minutes, Old Xaverians would draw level from a corner. La Trobe would take the lead another two times in the first half, only for Old Xaverians to equalize both times almost immediately. The start of the second half saw the same attacking tempo from both teams, with the home team breaking the deadlock first ten minutes after the restart making the scores 4\u20133. Like in the first half, it would be La Trobe who would equalize almost immediately with an unmarked long shot from outside the eighteen yard box leveling the scores at 4\u20134. For the next twenty-five minutes, there were extremely close chances at both ends with the respective goal keepers making tremendous saves, including a top right hand corner save from a La Trobe free kick on the edge of the Old Xaverians eighteen yard box. Following two substitutions from Old Xaverians and one from La Trobe towards the last ten minutes, the home side scored the mathematically winning goal that would also be the striker's one hundredth goal in his time with club. The same striker would score in the last minute to end the game 6-4<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=70129464&c=1-8746-125754-514463-0&pool=1</ref> bringing his career total to 101 goals on what would also be his last game for the club. Another reserve player and two more senior players would declare the round as their last games for the club until further notice. The seniors would also take part in a heavily attacking end-to-end contest and would win 2\u20131 to end the weekend with maximum points for the men's department.<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?a=MATCH&fixture=70128821&c=1-8746-125754-514506-0&pool=1</ref>\n\nThe new decade saw the club change its logo for the first time in history, with its vision of aligning itself with the logos of the athletics club, cricket club, and the [[Old Xaverians Football Club|football club]]. The club also discontinued its usage of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] kits, and reverted to [[Adidas]] for the 2020, 2021 and 2022 seasons. The men's squad commenced their [[2020 Football Victoria season|2020 campaign]] with the senior team losing 1\u20132 in the first round of the [[2020 FFA Cup]] against [[La Trobe University#Athletics|La Trobe University]] at [[FC Bulleen Lions|David Barro Stadium]]. The first round of the league season for both the senior and reserve squads was to be against [[Northern Falcons FC|Northern Falcons]] on 21 March 2020, however [[Football Victoria]] suspended all soccer competitions and related events due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>https://www.footballvictoria.com.au/news/football-victoria-postpones-all-competitions-until-april-14</ref>\n\n==Home venues==\n[[File:oldxaviersc27april2019.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Old Xaverians SC (left) and [[Plenty Valley Lions FC]] (right) observing a minute silence before a [[Victorian State League Division 4]] Reserves match at [[Hays Paddock]], 27 April 2019]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;margin-left:1em;float:right\"\n|-\n!Period\n!Home Ground\n!Suburb\n|-\n|2002\n|[[Xavier College]]\n|[[Kew, Victoria|Kew]]\n|-\n|2002\n|H A Smith Reserve\n|[[Hawthorn, Victoria|Hawthorn]]\n|-\n|2002\u20132004\n|Myrtle Park\n|[[Balwyn North, Victoria|Balwyn North]]\n|-\n|2005\u2013Present\n|[[Hays Paddock]]\n|[[Kew East, Victoria|Kew East]]\n|}\n\nUpon the founding of the club, [[Xavier College|the school]] offered the football club temporary use of its sporting facilities until the club could gain tenancy of a ground of its own. After winning their inaugural game at the school grounds, the club temporarily moved to H A Smith Reserve in [[Hawthorn, Victoria|Hawthorn]], sharing with Old Scotch. After a handful of games at the [[Glenferrie Road]] site, the club would finish the 2002 ASFV 2 season at Mrtyle Park in [[Balwyn North, Victoria|Balwyn North]], where it would stay for another two years as the club's first permanent home ground. Upon leaving the Balwyn North park at the conclusion of the 2004 [[Victorian State League Division 5|Provisional League Three]] season, the site had seen Old Xaverians celebrate two championships and two promotions.\n\nThe start of the 2005 season would see new beginnings for the club in moving to [[Hays Paddock]], with newer facilities and being the only state league club to be based at the ground. Since moving to Hays, the club has won nine championships and achieved multiple promotions across all six football teams. Season 2020 will mark the club's fifteen-year anniversary of being at the Kew East site, where the last nine championships have been achieved at.\n\n==Colours and kit evolution==\nThe colours of the club consist of black, red and white, resembling the logo of [[Xavier College]]. The home kit is primarily unique to that of the school's, with the away kit primarily being a fluorescent yellow short, often with black shorts & socks.
