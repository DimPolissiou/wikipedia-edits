Phon ([[Natthawut Jenmana]]) and Ter ([[Chanagun Arpornsutinan]]), the two hitmen working for Thana, are tasked to kill Neo and punish Vanika. Upon finding the pair, Ter tries to shoot Neo, but accidentally shoots and kills Vanika instead. Neo runs to the strip club where he works and is followed by Phon; earlier, Shin ([[Tawan Vihokratana]]), Thana's only son who happens to be a reluctant heir of his father's mob empire, comes to the same bar with his friends and meets Miw ([[Lapassalan Jiravechsoontornkul]]), a hostess at the bar. Shin's friends pay Miw to sleep with Shin (unbeknownst to them, Shin is gay, and doesn't actually sleep with Miw). Afterwards, Shin and Miw both return to the bar. In the bathroom, Shin runs into Neo, who is hiding from Phon, and who has apparently met Shin before (this is revealed later in the series). Phon discovers them, but is stopped by Miw, who accidentally shoots and kills Phon.  Neo, Miw, and Shin escape together and begin a harrowing journey that takes them from a seedy [[Bangkok]] motel, to the jungle and to the ocean as they try to evade those who are trying to find them.  \n\nPhon's death devastates not only Ter, but Phon's lover, Mae ([[Watchara Sukchum]]), a transgender female waitress who has long wanted Phon to leave the life of a gangster. Mae and Ter vow to take revenge on Phon's killers and follow the trio to the jungle, where they are hiding out with the assistance of Leo ([[Suphakorn Sriphothong]]), Neo's brother. The trio also seeks refuge in Miw's hometown and receives help from her ex-boyfriend, Luang ([[Pumipat Paiboon]]), while simultaneously dealing with Boss John, a mob leader in direct conflict with Thana, and the brother of Miw's step-father (who had tried to rape her years earlier and was accidentally killed by Miw). As their survival adventure continues, the trio develop strong feelings of friendship and loyalty towards each other with Neo, Miw, and Shin finding themselves in a love triangle. By the end of the series, all three must face the repercussions of their actions and the actions of others.\n\n== Cast and characters ==\nBelow are the cast of the series:<ref>{{cite web |title=3 Will Be Free \u0e2a\u0e32\u0e21\u0e40\u0e23\u0e32\u0e15\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e14 [Official Trailer] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct9fPlMJSDw |website=youtube.com |publisher=[[GMMTV]] |accessdate=7 April 2020 |date=9 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=\"\u0e21\u0e32\u0e22\u0e14\u0e4c-\u0e40\u0e15-\u0e08\u0e2d\u0e2a\" \u0e1f\u0e32\u0e14\u0e1f\u0e31\u0e19\u0e1d\u0e35\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e30\u0e17\u0e36\u0e01\u0e14\u0e38\u0e40\u0e14\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e14!!! |url=https://www.newsplus.co.th/171951 |website=newsplus.co.th |publisher=News Plus |accessdate=7 April 2020 |language=Thai |date=9 August 2019}}</ref>\n=== Main ===\n* [[Lapassalan Jiravechsoontornkul]] (Mild) as Miw\n* [[Way-ar Sangngern]] (Joss) as Neo\n* [[Tawan Vihokratana]] (Tay) as Shin\n\n=== Supporting ===\n* [[Watchara Sukchum]] (Jennie Panhan) as Mae\n* [[Chanagun Arpornsutinan]] (Gunsmile) as Tur\n* [[Natthawut Jenmana]] (Max) as Phon\n* [[Pumipat Paiboon]] (Prame) as Luang\n* [[Suphakorn Sriphothong]] (Podd) as Leo (Neo's brother)\n* [[Jirakit Kuariyakul]] (Toptap) as PP\n* [[Sivakorn Lertchoochot]] (Guy) as Touch\n* [[Harit Cheewagaroon]] (Sing) as James\n* [[Naphon Phromsuwan]] (Stop) as Boss John\n* [[Sarut Vijittranon]] (Big) as Sia Thana\n* [[Inthira Charoenpura]] as Vanika (Thana's Wife)\n* [[Sarocha Watitapun]] (Tao)\n* [[Penpak Sirikul]] as Miw's mother\n* [[Arisara Wongchalee]] (Fresh)\n* [[Krittanai Arsalprakit]] (Nammon) as Ken\n\n=== Guest role ===\n* [[Theepisit Mahaneeranon]] (Frame)\n* [[Pronpiphat Pattanasettanon]] (Plustor) as Nurse/Hitman\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Song Title\n!Romanized Title\n!Artist(s)\n!Ref\n|-\n| ''\u0e1d\u0e32\u0e01\u0e40\u0e27\u0e25\u0e32''\n| ''Fahk Welah''\n| The White Hair Cut\n| <ref>{{cite web |title=\u0e1d\u0e32\u0e01\u0e40\u0e27\u0e25\u0e32 Ost.3 Will Be Free \u0e2a\u0e32\u0e21\u0e40\u0e23\u0e32\u0e15\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e14 -

Phon ([[Natthawut Jenmana]]) and Ter ([[Chanagun Arpornsutinan]]), the two hitmen working for Thana, are tasked to kill Neo and punish Vanika. Upon finding the pair, Ter tries to shoot Neo, but accidentally shoots and kills Vanika instead. Neo runs to the strip club where he works and is followed by Phon; earlier, Shin ([[Tawan Vihokratana]]), Thana's only son who happens to be a reluctant heir of his father's mob empire, comes to the same bar with his friends and meets Miw ([[Lapassalan Jiravechsoontornkul]]), a hostess at the bar. Shin's friends pay Miw to sleep with Shin (unbeknownst to them, Shin is gay, and doesn't actually sleep with Miw). Afterwards, Shin and Miw both return to the bar. In the bathroom, Shin runs into Neo, who is hiding from Phon, and who has apparently met Shin before (this is revealed later in the series). Phon discovers them, but is stopped by Miw, who accidentally shoots and kills Phon.  Neo, Miw, and Shin escape together and begin a harrowing journey that takes them from a seedy [[Bangkok]] motel, to the jungle and to the ocean as they try to evade those who are trying to find them.  \n\nPhon's death devastates not only Ter, but Phon's lover, Mae ([[Watchara Sukchum]]), a transgender female waitress who has long wanted Phon to leave the life of a gangster. Mae and Ter vow to take revenge on Phon's killers and follow the trio to the jungle, where they are hiding out with the assistance of Leo ([[Suphakorn Sriphothong]]), Neo's brother. The trio also seeks refuge in Miw's hometown and receives help from her ex-boyfriend, Luang ([[Pumipat Paiboon]]), while simultaneously dealing with Boss John, a mob leader in direct conflict with Thana, and the brother of Miw's step-father (who had tried to rape her years earlier and was accidentally killed by Miw). As their survival adventure continues, the trio develop strong feelings of friendship and loyalty towards each other with Neo, Miw, and Shin finding themselves in a love triangle.

He has been politely described as \"eclectic\", and has been known to change outfits at the halfway stage of a round of tournament golf. Beginning in 2006, one of his new on-course fashion statements was a necktie worn under a vest. Puma Golf signed Jesper Parnevik in 2014 and he gets credited for his influence on their LUX Golf Appearel Line.

An allegedly thoughtful historian in his free time, and a man with varied tastes, he was recently asked with whom he would like to have dinner. He quickly replied that it would have to be a choice between [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Elvis Presley]]. When told he could only have one, he shot back, \"OK, Elvis Einstein.\"\n\nParnevik is credited with having introduced fellow professional golfer [[Tiger Woods]] to Swedish [[au pair]] [[Elin Nordegren]] (previously employed by Parnevik), whom Woods would eventually marry. Parnevik subsequently stated in 2009 that he regretted his responsibility for this introduction after reports of Woods' infidelity surfaced that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/golf/2009/1203/woodst.html |title=Parnevik regrets Woods introduction |publisher=RT\u00c9.ie |date=3 December 2009 |access-date=19 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413115953/http://www.rte.ie/sport/golf/2009/1203/woodst.html |archive-date=13 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nParnevik and his family starred in a reality TV show, ''[[Parneviks]]'', which aired on [[TV3 (Sweden)|TV3]] in Sweden for two seasons 2015\u20132016, giving insights into his life in Florida.
