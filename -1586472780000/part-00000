Some countries use a quota system, whereby a certain percentage of government jobs, political positions, and school vacancies must be reserved for members of a certain group; an example of this is the [[Reservation in India|reservation system in India]].\n\nIn some other regions where quotas are not used, minority group members are given preference or special consideration in selection processes. In the United States, affirmative action in employment and education has been the subject of legal and political controversy. In 2003, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], in ''[[Grutter v.

Kurtulus (2012) in her review of affirmative action and the occupational advancement of minorities and women during 1973\u20132003 showed that the effect of affirmative action on advancing black, Hispanic, and white women into management, professional, and technical occupations occurred primarily during the 1970s and early 1980s. During this period, contractors grew their shares of these groups more rapidly than noncontractors because of the implementation of affirmative action. But the positive effect of affirmative action vanished entirely in the late 1980s, which Kurtulus says may be due to the slowdown into advanced occupation for women and minorities because of the political shift of affirmative action that started by President Reagan. Becoming a federal contractor increased white women's share of professional occupations by 0.183 percentage points, or 7.3 percent, on average during these three decades, and increased black women's share by 0.052 percentage points (or by 3.9 percent). Becoming a federal contractor also increased Hispanic women's and black men's share of technical occupations on average by 0.058 percent and 0.109 percentage points respectively (or by 7.7 and 4.2 percent). These represent a substantial contribution of affirmative action to overall trends in the occupational advancement of women and minorities over the three decades under the study.<ref>Fidan Ana Kurtulus, \"Affirmative Action and the Occupational Advancement of Minorities and Women During 1973\u20132003,\" ''Industrial Relations: A Journal of Economy and Society'' (2012) 51#2 pp 213\u2013246.

Caste-based quotas are used in India for [[Reservation in India|reservation]]. However, they are illegal in the United States, where no employer, university, or other entity may create a set number required for each race.\n\nIn 2012, the [[European Union]] Commission approved a plan for women to constitute 40% of non-executive board directorships in large listed companies in Europe by 2020.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The EU's Boardroom Quota Battle Is Over, But Women Cannot Yet Rest |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insead/2012/11/19/the-eus-boardroom-quota-battle-is-over-but-women-cannot-yet-rest/ |magazine=Forbes.com}}</ref> In Sweden, the Supreme Court has ruled that \"affirmative action\" ethnic quotas in universities are discrimination and hence unlawful.

This approach of equal treatment is sometimes described as being \"[[Color blindness (race)|color blind]]\", in hopes that it is effective against discrimination without engaging in [[reverse discrimination]].\n\nIn such countries, the focus tends to be on ensuring equal opportunity and, for example, targeted advertising campaigns to encourage ethnic minority candidates to join the police force.

The designated groups who are to be advanced include all people of colour, women (including white women) and [[people with disabilities]] (including white people).

This act was passed to promote the constitutional right of equality and exercise true democracy.

The BEE was not a moral initiative to redress the wrongs of the past but to promote growth and strategies that aim to realize a country's full potential. The idea was targeting the weakest link in economics, which was inequality and which would help develop the economy. This is evident in the statement by the Department of Trade and Industry, \"As such, this strategy stresses a BEE process that is associated with growth, development and enterprise development, and not merely the redistribution of existing wealth\".<ref name=info>{{cite web |title=Black economic empowerment.

Successive governments cultivated a historical myth after the colonial powers had left that the British had practised [[communal]] favouritism towards Christians and the minority [[Tamil people|Tamil community]] for the entire 200 years they had controlled [[Sri Lanka]]. However, the Sinhalese in fact benefitted from trade and plantation cultivations over the rest of the other groups and their language and culture as well as the religion of Buddhism was fostered and made into mediums for schools over the Tamil language, which did not have the same treatment and Tamils learned English instead as there was no medium for Tamil until near independence. Tamils' knowledge of English and education came from the very American missionary activity by overseas Christians that the British were concerned will anger the Sinhalese and destroy their trading relationships, so they sent them to the Tamil areas instead to teach, thinking it would have no consequences and due to their small numbers. The British sending the missionaries to the north and east was for the protection of the Sinhalese and in fact showed favouritism to the majority group instead of the minorities to maintain trading relationships and benefits from them. The Tamils, out of this random benefit from learning English and basic education excelled and flourished and were able to take many civil service jobs to the chagrin of the Sinhalese. The myth of Divide and Rule is untrue. The 'policy of standardisation' was typical of affirmative action policies, in that it required drastically lower standards for Sinhalese students than for the more academic Tamils who had to get about ten more marks to enter into universities. The policy, were it not implemented would have prevented the civil wars ahead as the policies had no basis and in fact is an example of discrimination against the Tamil ethnic group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sangam.org/british-divide-rule-ceylon/ |title=Did the British Divide & Rule Ceylon? &#124; Ilankai Tamil Sangam |publisher=Sangam.org |accessdate=1 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Taiwan====\nA 2004 legislation requires that, for a firm with 100 employees or more wishing to compete for government contracts, at least 1 per cent of its employees must be [[Taiwanese aborigines]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://minorityrights.org/minorities/indigenous-peoples-7/|title=Taiwan: Indigenous peoples |website = Minority Rights Group International}}</ref> Ministry of Education and [[Council of Indigenous Peoples|Council of Aboriginal Affairs]] announced in 2002 that Taiwanese Aboriginal students would have their high-school or undergraduate entrance exams boosted by 33% for demonstrating some knowledge of their tribal language and culture.<ref name=\"HolsingerJacob2009\">{{cite book|author1=Donald B.

diversity, and redressing apparent past wrongs, harms, or hindrances.\n\nThe nature of affirmative action policies varies from region to region and exists on a spectrum from a hard quota to merely targeting encouragement for increased participation. Some countries use a quota system, whereby a certain percentage of government jobs, political positions, and school vacancies must be reserved for members of a certain group; an example of this is the [[Reservation in India|reservation system in India]].\n\nIn some other regions where quotas are not used, minority group members are given preference or special consideration in selection processes. In the United States, affirmative action in employment and education has been the subject of legal and political controversy. In 2003, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], in ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]],'' held that the [[University of Michigan Law School]] could consider race as a plus-factor when evaluating applicants holistically and maintained the prohibition on the use of quotas.<ref name=\"Supct.law.cornell.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/03highlts.html#2 |title=Highlights of the 2002\u20132003 Supreme Court Term |publisher=Supct.law.cornell.edu |accessdate=1 September 2013}}</ref><ref>Melvin  I Urofsky,   ''The Affirmative Action Puzzle: A Living History From Reconstruction to Today'' (2020)</ref>\n\nIn the UK, hiring someone simply because of their protected group status, without regard to their performance, is illegal.<ref name=\"cre\" /><ref name=\"govuk\">{{cite web|title=Types of discrimination'|url=https://www.gov.uk/discrimination-your-rights/types-of-discrimination|work=Discrimination: your rights|publisher=GOV.UK|accessdate=7 April 2013|author=GOV.UK|authorlink=Gov.uk|date=4 April 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"personneltoday.com\">Personneltoday.com [http://www.personneltoday.com/Articles/2006/01/17/33430/is-there-a-case-for-positive-discrimination.html \"Is there a case for positive discrimination?\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105095039/http://www.personneltoday.com/Articles/2006/01/17/33430/is-there-a-case-for-positive-discrimination.html |date=5 January 2008 }}</ref> However, the law in the UK does allow for membership in a protected and disadvantaged group to be considered in hiring and promotion in the event that that group is under-represented in a given area and if the candidates are of equal merit.

Kurtulus (2012) in her review of affirmative action and the occupational advancement of minorities and women during 1973\u20132003 showed that the effect of affirmative action on advancing black, Hispanic, and white women into management, professional, and technical occupations occurred primarily during the 1970s and early 1980s. During this period, contractors grew their shares of these groups more rapidly than noncontractors because of the implementation of affirmative action. But the positive effect of affirmative action vanished entirely in the late 1980s, which Kurtulus says may be due to the slowdown into advanced occupation for women and minorities because of the political shift of affirmative action that started by President Reagan. Becoming a federal contractor increased white women's share of professional occupations by 0.183 percentage points, or 7.3 percent, on average during these three decades, and increased black women's share by 0.052 percentage points (or by 3.9 percent). Becoming a federal contractor also increased Hispanic women's and black men's share of technical occupations on average by 0.058 percent and 0.109 percentage points respectively (or by 7.7 and 4.2 percent). These represent a substantial contribution of affirmative action to overall trends in the occupational advancement of women and minorities over the three decades under the study.<ref>Fidan Ana Kurtulus, \"Affirmative Action and the Occupational Advancement of Minorities and Women During 1973\u20132003,\" ''Industrial Relations: A Journal of Economy and Society'' (2012) 51#2 pp 213\u2013246.

Caste-based quotas are used in India for [[Reservation in India|reservation]]. However, they are illegal in the United States, where no employer, university, or other entity may create a set number required for each race.\n\nIn 2012, the [[European Union]] Commission approved a plan for women to constitute 40% of non-executive board directorships in large listed companies in Europe by 2020.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The EU's Boardroom Quota Battle Is Over, But Women Cannot Yet Rest |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insead/2012/11/19/the-eus-boardroom-quota-battle-is-over-but-women-cannot-yet-rest/ |magazine=Forbes.com}}</ref> In Sweden, the Supreme Court has ruled that \"affirmative action\" ethnic quotas in universities are discrimination and hence unlawful. It said that the requirements for the intake should be the same for all. The justice minister said that the decision left no room for uncertainty.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelocal.se/20061221/5871 |title=Uppsala discriminated against Swedes |website= The Local |date= 21 December 2006}}</ref>\n\n==National approaches==\n{{See also|Reserved political positions}}\n\nIn some countries that have laws on racial equality, affirmative action is rendered illegal because it does not treat all races equally. This approach of equal treatment is sometimes described as being \"[[Color blindness (race)|color blind]]\", in hopes that it is effective against discrimination without engaging in [[reverse discrimination]].\n\nIn such countries, the focus tends to be on ensuring equal opportunity and, for example, targeted advertising campaigns to encourage ethnic minority candidates to join the police force. This is sometimes described as \"positive action\".\n\n=== Africa ===\n\n====South Africa====\n{{see also|Black Economic Empowerment}}\n\n=====Apartheid=====\nThe [[apartheid]] government, as a matter of state policy, favoured white-owned, especially [[Afrikaner]]-owned companies.

A related, but distinct concept is [[Black Economic Empowerment]].<ref>[http://www.ecsecc.org/files/publications/120307130010.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318215653/http://www.ecsecc.org/files/publications/120307130010.pdf|date=18 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Employment Equity Act]] and the [[Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment]] Act aim to promote and achieve equality in the workplace (in South Africa termed \"equity\"), by advancing people from designated groups. The designated groups who are to be advanced include all people of colour, women (including white women) and [[people with disabilities]] (including white people). Employment Equity legislation requires companies employing more than 50 people to design and implement plans to improve the representativity of workforce demographics, and report them to the [[Department of Labour (South Africa)|Department of Labour]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southafrica.info/services/rights/employmentequity.htm |title=Employment Equity FAQ |publisher=Southafrica.info |accessdate=11 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401103321/http://www.southafrica.info/services/rights/employmentequity.htm |archivedate=1 April 2012  }}</ref>\n\nEmployment Equity also forms part of a company's [[Black Economic Empowerment]] scorecard: in a relatively complex scoring system, which allows for some flexibility in the manner in which each company meets its legal commitments, each company is required to meet minimum requirements in terms of representation by previously disadvantaged groups. The matters covered include equity ownership, representation at employee and management level (up to board of director level), procurement from black-owned businesses and social investment programs, amongst others.\n\nThe policies of Employment Equity and, particularly, Black Economic empowerment have been criticised both by those who view them as discriminatory against white people, and by those who view them as ineffectual.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2010-02-03-bees-glass-slipper |title=BEE's Glass Slipper |publisher=Mg.co.za |accessdate=11 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moneyweb.co.za/mw/view/mw/en/page292679?oid=346519&sn=2009+Detail+no+image&pid=295799 |title=BEE: A man made disaster |publisher=Moneyweb.co.za |accessdate=11 April 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"fin24.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fin24.com/articles/default/display_article.aspx?ArticleId=1518-24_2564628 |title='SAB deal to enrich black elite': Fin24: Companies |publisher=Fin24 |accessdate=29 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003093857/http://www.fin24.com/articles/default/display_article.aspx?ArticleId=1518-24_2564628 |archivedate=3 October 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.busrep.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=5340048 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160516113211/http://www.busrep.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=5340048 |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 May 2016 |title=Business Report \u2013 Home \u2013 Motlanthe warns BEE council has failed |publisher=Busrep.co.za |date=9 February 2010 |accessdate=29 July 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2009-11-20-manyi-vows-to-get-tough-over-bee |title=Manyi vows to get tough over BEE \u2013 Mail & Guardian Online: The smart news source |publisher=Mg.co.za |accessdate=29 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nThese laws cause disproportionally high costs for small companies and reduce economic growth and employment.<ref name=africa/> The laws may give the black middle-class some advantage but can make the worse-off blacks even poorer.<ref name=africa/> Moreover, the [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court]] has ruled that in principle blacks may be favored, but in practice this should not lead to unfair discrimination against the others.<ref name=africa/><ref name=africa/>\n\n=====Affirmative Action Purpose=====\nAs mentioned previously affirmative action was introduced through the Employment Equality Act, 55 in 1998, 4 years after the end of apartheid. This act was passed to promote the constitutional right of equality and exercise true democracy. This idea was to eliminate unfair discrimination in employment, to ensure the implementation of employment equity to redress the effects of discrimination, to achieve a diverse workforce broadly representative of our people, to promote economic development and efficiency in the workforce and to give effects to the obligations of the Republic as a member of the International Labour Organisation.<ref name=prob/><ref name=aff>{{cite journal |last=Bergmann |first=B. |year=1999 |title=The continuing need for affirmative action.

The act eliminates unfair discrimination in certain sectors of the national labour market by imposing similar constraints on another.<ref name=prob/>\n\nWith the introduction of Affirmative Action, Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) rose additionally in South Africa. The BEE was not a moral initiative to redress the wrongs of the past but to promote growth and strategies that aim to realize a country's full potential. The idea was targeting the weakest link in economics, which was inequality and which would help develop the economy. This is evident in the statement by the Department of Trade and Industry, \"As such, this strategy stresses a BEE process that is associated with growth, development and enterprise development, and not merely the redistribution of existing wealth\".<ref name=info>{{cite web |title=Black economic empowerment.

This depended on the approach to and the view of The Employment Equality Act and affirmative action.\n\n'''Positive:'''\nPre-Democracy, the apartheid governments discriminated against non-white races, so with affirmative action, the country started to redress past discriminations.

In evaluating the eligibility of applicants, neither their financial status nor their national or ethnic origins are considered.

This policy made the four institutions, especially the echelons at the most selective departments, more diverse than they otherwise would have been.

In the negotiation for status as worthy peers, emphasizing gender signals that a woman is an \"imposter\", someone who does not rightfully belong in the position she is claiming to fill.\" And once affirmative action for women is fulfilled, and then affirmative action shares the element, as Izraeli put it, the \"group equality discourse,\" making it easier for other groups to claim for a fairer distribution of resources.

Successive governments cultivated a historical myth after the colonial powers had left that the British had practised [[communal]] favouritism towards Christians and the minority [[Tamil people|Tamil community]] for the entire 200 years they had controlled [[Sri Lanka]]. However, the Sinhalese in fact benefitted from trade and plantation cultivations over the rest of the other groups and their language and culture as well as the religion of Buddhism was fostered and made into mediums for schools over the Tamil language, which did not have the same treatment and Tamils learned English instead as there was no medium for Tamil until near independence. Tamils' knowledge of English and education came from the very American missionary activity by overseas Christians that the British were concerned will anger the Sinhalese and destroy their trading relationships, so they sent them to the Tamil areas instead to teach, thinking it would have no consequences and due to their small numbers. The British sending the missionaries to the north and east was for the protection of the Sinhalese and in fact showed favouritism to the majority group instead of the minorities to maintain trading relationships and benefits from them. The Tamils, out of this random benefit from learning English and basic education excelled and flourished and were able to take many civil service jobs to the chagrin of the Sinhalese. The myth of Divide and Rule is untrue. The 'policy of standardisation' was typical of affirmative action policies, in that it required drastically lower standards for Sinhalese students than for the more academic Tamils who had to get about ten more marks to enter into universities. The policy, were it not implemented would have prevented the civil wars ahead as the policies had no basis and in fact is an example of discrimination against the Tamil ethnic group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sangam.org/british-divide-rule-ceylon/ |title=Did the British Divide & Rule Ceylon? &#124; Ilankai Tamil Sangam |publisher=Sangam.org |accessdate=1 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Taiwan====\nA 2004 legislation requires that, for a firm with 100 employees or more wishing to compete for government contracts, at least 1 per cent of its employees must be [[Taiwanese aborigines]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://minorityrights.org/minorities/indigenous-peoples-7/|title=Taiwan: Indigenous peoples |website = Minority Rights Group International}}</ref> Ministry of Education and [[Council of Indigenous Peoples|Council of Aboriginal Affairs]] announced in 2002 that Taiwanese Aboriginal students would have their high-school or undergraduate entrance exams boosted by 33% for demonstrating some knowledge of their tribal language and culture.<ref name=\"HolsingerJacob2009\">{{cite book|author1=Donald B.

For example, according to the hypothesis, in the absence of affirmative action, a student will be admitted to a college that matches his or her academic ability and have a good chance of graduating. However, according to the mismatching hypothesis, affirmative action often places a student into a college that is too difficult, and this increases the student's chance of dropping out. Thus, according to the hypothesis, affirmative action hurts its intended beneficiaries, because it increases their dropout rate.<ref name=\"latimes.com\">[https://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-sander26sep26,0,3998908.story?coll=la-opinion-center Does affirmative action hurt minorities?], ''Los Angeles Times'', 26 September 2007</ref><ref name=\"Quotas on trial\">[http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/sowell010803.asp Quotas on trial], by Thomas Sowell, 8 January 2003</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Heriot, Gail L. | authorlink = Gail Heriot | title = Want to Be a Doctor?

There was a heavy fog which Press hoped would lift, but it failed to do so. At 7 a.m. the ship struck a reef just east of [[Point Nepean]], now known as the Petriana Reef (or misspelt as Patriana Reef). The ship's engine room and stokehold were flooded within moments, leaving the ship without power.<ref name=amsa/>\n\n===Recovery attempts===\nFor the rest of the day [[Melbourne Harbour Trust]] tug ''James Paterson'' tried unsuccessfully to push ''Petriana'' off the reef. Two other ships were called to assist on the next day, the tug ''Eagle'' and the salvage schooner ''Enterprise''. However, the pumps on the ''Enterprise'' broke down and ''Petriana'' remained inundated with water. After a final attempt by the ''James Paterson'' on 30 November, the ship was formally abandoned.

This resulted in Australia's first major [[oil spill]]. The surrounding beaches were contaminated for months, although one observer described the spill as \"a film of great beauty, radiating all the colours of the rainbow\".<ref name=amsa/> The ''Petriana'' oil spill had \"catastrophic environmental consequences\",<ref name=heritage/> and remained Australia's largest until that of the ''Princess Anne Marie'' offshore of Western Australia in 1975.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.amsa.gov.au/marine-environment/incidents-and-exercises/major-historical-incidents|title=Major historical incidents: A summary list of major historical oil spill incidents|publisher=Australian Maritime Safety Authority|access-date=15 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Investigation===\nA Court of Marine Inquiry assigned the blame for the wreck to Press, and on 9 December he was convicted of misconduct.

The ship's captain William Kerr and his wife were passed through quarantine and then given accommodation in the town. However, the other officers and crew were required to remain on the tug, initially with the explanation that they would be needed for recovery attempts.{{sfn|Foster|2014|p=71}} Once the ship had been formally abandoned, immigration officials applied the ''[[Immigration Restriction Act 1901]]'', refusing permission for the Asian crew members to land and forcing the tug to anchor off [[Williamstown, Victoria|Williamstown]]. The British officers were also refused permission to land at first, however officials relented after five hours and the government later denied there had been a delay.{{sfn|Foster|2014|p=72}} On the evening of 30 November, the 27 Asian crew members were transferred to the ''Kasuga Maru'', a Japanese mail steamer bound for Hong Kong, from which they were to be returned to their original port of Singapore as required by the ''[[Merchant Shipping Act 1854]]''.{{sfn|Foster|2014|p=72}}\n\nCaptain Kerr released a press statement highly critical of the treatment of his crew, in which he said:<ref name=amsa/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/14585119|title=Statement by the captain|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=8 December 1903}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>I have sailed in many seas the world over, but have never before seen or heard of a country where the shipwrecked mariner was not allowed to set his foot on dry land. [...] If this treatment of my crew is a fair specimen of your humanity it is about equal to the worst barbarity of other nations, and if it is forced on you by your laws, I regret to say they are a disgrace to the British Empire.</blockquote>\n\n===Political consequences===\nThere was an immediate public reaction to the government's handling of the wreck, which occurred in the middle of the [[1903 Australian federal election|1903 federal election]] campaign. ''[[Melbourne Argus|The Argus]]'' published numerous letters accusing the government of cruelty and damaging Australia's international reputation.{{sfn|Foster|2014|p=73}} The federal government's handling of the case was contrasted with that of the Victorian colonial government, which in 1891 had accommodated the Afro-Canadian crew members of the shipwrecked ''[[Joseph H. Scammell (ship)|Joseph H. Scammell]]''. ''[[The Age]]'' was initially equivocal but supported the government once criticism became sustained.{{sfn|Foster|2014|p=74}} In Sydney, ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|Daily Telegraph]]'' adopted the stance of the ''Argus'', whereas ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]'' referred to the crew members using racial slurs and labelled them \"very undesirable immigrants\". It accused the other newspapers of slandering the government by portraying them as heartless.{{sfn|Foster|2014|pp=74\u201376}}\n\nPrime Minister [[Alfred Deakin]] sought to use the incident to promote his zero-tolerance approach to the [[White Australia policy]]. When the press began to question the government's actions, he claimed that the actual responsibility for the situation lay with the ship's owners. Deakin's departmental secretary [[Atlee Hunt]] had in fact informed the [[shipping agency]] that the crew could be landed on [[Coode Island]], but that they would be liable for a \u00a3100 fine for each crew member who escaped. They were unwilling to take the risk and therefore arranged for the crew to be [[Transshipment at sea|transshipped]] rather than landed.{{sfn|Foster|2014|pp=72\u201373}} Deakin publicly defended the actions of both Hunt and the immigration officials who had originally refused the sailors entry,{{sfn|Foster|2014|p=73}} stating the latter had acted in the spirit of \"utmost humanity\".{{sfn|Foster|2014|p=77}}\n\nThe ''Petriana'' incident was \"constantly raised\" at election meetings in Victoria and Tasmania. The [[Attorney-General of Australia|Attorney-General]], [[James Drake]], told a meeting in [[Sydney]]:{{sfn|Foster|2014|p=74}}\n\n<blockquote>It was undesirable that educated gentlemen who had been in gaol, or coloured men who had been shipwrecked, should land in Australia in defiance of the law. They [the government] intended to keep their race pure, and make Australia a place worth living in.</blockquote>\n\nThe issue had no measurable impact on the election results, which saw the parliamentary status quo maintained and only a single seat change hands in Victoria. The government was nonetheless concerned by the possibility of negative coverage overseas. In early 1904 it issued a statement internationally via [[Reuters]] which stated that \"the coloured men had been well cared for\" and quoted Deakin as saying \"any complaints are baseless and are merely being employed for electioneering purposes\".{{sfn|Foster|2014|p=76}} A similar incident occurred in March 1904, when the Japanese crew of the wrecked cargo ship ''Elba'' arrived in Sydney, but controversy was averted when the local customs officials allowed the men onshore.{{sfn|Foster|2014|pp=76\u201377}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of oil spills]]\n*[[Tampa affair|''Tampa'' affair]], similar issue before the 2001 election\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite journal|last=Foster|first=Leonie|title=Shipwrecks and the White Australia policy|journal=The Great Circle|publisher=The Australian Association for Maritime History|year=2014|volume=36|number=2|pages=68\u201384|jstor=24583070|ref=harv}}\n\n{{1903 shipwrecks}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Petriana}}\n[[Category:1879 ships]]\n[[Category:Oil spills in Australia]]\n[[Category:Shipwrecks of Victoria (Australia)]]\n[[Category:Ships built on the River Tyne]]\n[[Category:Oil tankers]]\n[[Category:1903 in Australia]]\n[[Category:1903 in the Dutch East Indies]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in 1903]]\n[[Category:Royal Dutch Shell controversies]]\n[[Category:Victorian Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Political controversies in Australia]]\n", "text_old": "{{coord|-38.31|144.65|scale:100000_type:isle_region:AU|display=title}}\n{|{{Infobox ship begin}} <!-- commercial vessels -->\n|+SS ''Petriana''\n{{Infobox ship image\n|Ship image=\n|Ship image size=\n|Ship caption=\n}}\n{{Infobox ship career\n|Hide header=\n|Ship name=\n|Ship owner=\n*[[Asiatic Petroleum Company]]{{efn|Full list of owners:<ref name=tbs>{{cite news|url=http://www.tynebuiltships.co.uk/P-Ships/petriana1879.html|title=Petriana|publisher=Tyne Built Ships|access-date=15 March 2020}}</ref>\n*[[Shell Transport & Trading|Shell Transport & Trading Co.

The ship's captain William Kerr and his wife were passed through quarantine and then given accommodation in the town. However, the other officers and crew were required to remain on the tug, initially with the explanation that they would be needed for recovery attempts.{{sfn|Foster|2014|p=71}} Once the ship had been formally abandoned, immigration officials applied the ''[[Immigration Restriction Act 1901]]'', refusing permission for the Asian crew members to land and forcing the tug to anchor off [[Williamstown, Victoria|Williamstown]]. The British officers were also refused permission to land at first, however officials relented after five hours and the government later denied there had been a delay.{{sfn|Foster|2014|p=72}} On the evening of 30 November, the 27 Asian crew members were transferred to the ''Kasuga Maru'', a Japanese mail steamer bound for Hong Kong, from which they were to be returned to their original port of Singapore as required by the ''[[Merchant Shipping Act 1854]]''.{{sfn|Foster|2014|p=72}}\n\nCaptain Kerr released a press statement highly critical of the treatment of his crew, in which he said:<ref name=amsa/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/14585119|title=Statement by the captain|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=8 December 1903}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>I have sailed in many seas the world over, but have never before seen or heard of a country where the shipwrecked mariner was not allowed to set his foot on dry land. [...] If this treatment of my crew is a fair specimen of your humanity it is about equal to the worst barbarity of other nations, and if it is forced on you by your laws, I regret to say they are a disgrace to the British Empire.</blockquote>\n\n===Political consequences===\nThere was an immediate public reaction to the government's handling of the wreck, which occurred in the middle of the [[1903 Australian federal election|1903 federal election]] campaign. ''[[Melbourne Argus|The Argus]]'' published numerous letters accusing the government of cruelty and damaging Australia's international reputation.{{sfn|Foster|2014|p=73}} The federal government's handling of the case was contrasted with that of the Victorian colonial government, which in 1891 had accommodated the Afro-Canadian crew members of the shipwrecked ''[[Joseph H.

''[[The Age]]'' was initially equivocal but supported the government once criticism became sustained.{{sfn|Foster|2014|p=74}} In Sydney, ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|Daily Telegraph]]'' adopted the stance of the ''Argus'', whereas ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]'' referred to the crew members using racial slurs and labelled them \"very undesirable immigrants\". It accused the other newspapers of slandering the government by portraying them as heartless.{{sfn|Foster|2014|pp=74\u201376}}\n\nPrime Minister [[Alfred Deakin]] sought to use the incident to promote his zero-tolerance approach to the [[White Australia policy]]. When the press began to question the government's actions, he claimed that the actual responsibility for the situation lay with the ship's owners. Deakin's departmental secretary [[Atlee Hunt]] had in fact informed the [[shipping agency]] that the crew could be landed on [[Coode Island]], but that they would be liable for a \u00a3100 fine for each crew member who escaped. They were unwilling to take the risk and therefore arranged for the crew to be [[Transshipment at sea|transshipped]] rather than landed.{{sfn|Foster|2014|pp=72\u201373}} Deakin publicly defended the actions of both Hunt and the immigration officials who had originally refused the sailors entry,{{sfn|Foster|2014|p=73}} stating the latter had acted in the spirit of \"utmost humanity\".{{sfn|Foster|2014|p=77}}\n\nThe ''Petriana'' incident was \"constantly raised\" at election meetings in Victoria and Tasmania. The [[Attorney-General of Australia|Attorney-General]], [[James Drake]], told a meeting in [[Sydney]]:{{sfn|Foster|2014|p=74}}\n\n<blockquote>It was undesirable that educated gentlemen who had been in gaol, or coloured men who had been shipwrecked, should land in Australia in defiance of the law. They [the government] intended to keep their race pure, and make Australia a place worth living in.</blockquote>\n\nThe issue had no measurable impact on the election results, which saw the parliamentary status quo maintained and only a single seat change hands in Victoria. The government was nonetheless concerned by the possibility of negative coverage overseas. In early 1904 it issued a statement internationally via [[Reuters]] which stated that \"the coloured men had been well cared for\" and quoted Deakin as saying \"any complaints are baseless and are merely being employed for electioneering purposes\".{{sfn|Foster|2014|p=76}} A similar incident occurred in March 1904, when the Japanese crew of the wrecked cargo ship ''Elba'' arrived in Sydney, but controversy was averted when the local customs officials allowed the men onshore.{{sfn|Foster|2014|pp=76\u201377}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of oil spills]]\n*[[Tampa affair|''Tampa'' affair]], similar issue before the 2001 election\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite journal|last=Foster|first=Leonie|title=Shipwrecks and the White Australia policy|journal=The Great Circle|publisher=The Australian Association for Maritime History|year=2014|volume=36|number=2|pages=68\u201384|jstor=24583070|ref=harv}}\n\n{{1903 shipwrecks}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Petriana}}\n[[Category:1879 ships]]\n[[Category:Oil spills in Australia]]\n[[Category:Shipwrecks of Victoria (Australia)]]\n[[Category:Ships built on the River Tyne]]\n[[Category:Oil tankers]]\n[[Category:1903 in Australia]]\n[[Category:1903 in the Dutch East Indies]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in 1903]]\n[[Category:Royal Dutch Shell controversies]]\n[[Category:Victorian Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Political controversies in Australia]]\n", "name_user": "Biscuit-in-Chief", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eWreck:prepositional phrase in two words", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Petriana"}

The total number of nonfatal gunshot woundings, whether medically treated or not, is unknown, and no meaningful estimates can be derived from his survey regarding defensive gun uses linked with specific crime types, or that involved wounding the offender, because the sample sizes are too small. The fact that some crime-specific estimates derived from the Kleck survey are implausibly large is at least partly a reflection of the small samples on which they are based - no more than 196 cases. Kleck states that his estimate of total defensive gun uses was based on nearly 5,000 cases. Thus, he argues, the implausible character of some estimates of small ''subsets'' of defensive gun uses is not a valid criticism of whether estimates of the ''total'' number of defensive gun uses are implausible or too high.<ref name=\"Kleck, G 2001\">Kleck, G. and D.

The total number of nonfatal gunshot woundings, whether medically treated or not, is unknown, and no meaningful estimates can be derived from his survey regarding defensive gun uses linked with specific crime types, or that involved wounding the offender, because the sample sizes are too small. The fact that some crime-specific estimates derived from the Kleck survey are implausibly large is at least partly a reflection of the small samples on which they are based - no more than 196 cases. Kleck states that his estimate of total defensive gun uses was based on nearly 5,000 cases.

In ''More Guns, Less Crime'', Lott writes that \"[s]ince in many defensive cases a handgun is simply brandished, and no one is harmed, many defensive uses are never even reported to the police\".\n\nAttempting to quantify this phenomenon, in the first edition of the book, published in May 1998, Lott wrote that \"national surveys\" suggested that \"98 percent of the time that people use guns defensively, they merely have to brandish a weapon to break off an attack.\" The higher the rate of defensive gun uses that do not end in the attacker being killed or wounded, the easier it is to explain why defensive gun uses are not covered by the media without reference to media bias. Lott cited the figure frequently in the media, including publications like the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''<ref name=\"Lott98WSJ\">{{cite news|first=John R. |last=Lott, Jr. |title=Keep Guns out of Lawyers' Hands |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |page=1 |date=1998-06-23}}</ref> and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.<ref name=\"Lott98LAT\">{{cite news|first=John R. |last=Lott, Jr. |title=Cities Target Gun Makers in Bogus Lawsuits |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |page=7 |date=1998-12-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, he repeated the survey, and reported that brandishing a weapon was sufficient to stop an attack 95% of the time.
