He was the last absolute monarch and the first constitutional monarch of the country. His reign was a turbulent time for Siam due to political and social changes during the [[Siamese revolution of 1932|Revolution of 1932]]. He is to date the only Siamese monarch of the Chakri Dynasty to abdicate.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Prajadhipok's coronation records - 003.jpg|Young Prajadhipok and his mother, [[Saovabha Phongsri]]|left|200px|thumb]]\n\n'''Somdet Chaofa Prajadhipok Sakdidej''' ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e21\u0e40\u0e14\u0e47\u0e08\u0e40\u0e08\u0e49\u0e32\u0e1f\u0e49\u0e32\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e18\u0e34\u0e1b\u0e01\u0e28\u0e31\u0e01\u0e14\u0e34\u0e40\u0e14\u0e0a\u0e19\u0e4c}}) was born on 8 November 1893 in [[Bangkok]], Siam (now Thailand) to King [[Chulalongkorn]] and Queen [[Saovabha Phongsri]]. Prince Prajadhipok was the youngest of nine children born to the couple. Overall he was the king's second-youngest child (of a total of 77), and the 33rd and youngest of Chulalongkorn's sons.<ref name=\"Soravij\">{{cite web |last1=Bhorombhakdi |first1=Soravij |title=HM King Prajadhipok |url=http://www.soravij.com/royalty/rama7/rama7.html |website=The Siamese Royalty A Personal Fascination |accessdate=20 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nUnlikely to succeed to the throne, Prince Prajadhipok chose to pursue a military career. Like many of the king's children, he was sent abroad to study, going to [[Eton College]] in 1906, then to the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich|Woolwich Military Academy]] from which he graduated in 1913. He received a commission in the [[Royal Horse Artillery]] in the [[British Army]] based in [[Aldershot]]. In 1910 Chulalongkorn died and was succeeded by Prajadhipok's older brother (also a son of Queen Saovabha), [[Crown Prince of Thailand|Crown Prince]] [[Vajiravudh]], who became King Rama VI. Prince Prajadhipok was by then commissioned in both the British Army and the Royal Siamese Army. With the outbreak of the [[First World War]] and the declaration of Siamese neutrality, King [[Vajiravudh]] ordered his younger brother to resign his British commission and return to Siam immediately, a great embarrassment to the prince, who wanted to serve with his men on the Western front. Once home, Prajadhipok became a high-ranking military official in Siam. In 1917 he was ordained temporarily as a monk,<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|30}} as was customary for most Buddhist Siamese men.\n\nIn August 1918 Prince Prajadhipok married his childhood friend and cousin [[Rambhai Barni]], a descendant of King Mongkut (Prajadhipok's grandfather) and his Royal Consort [[Piam]]. They were married at [[Sukhothai Palace]] which was a wedding gift to the couple from Queen [[Saovabha]].<ref name=\"Soravij\" />\n\nAfter the war in Europe ended, he attended the [[\u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr|\u00c9cole Superieure de Guerre]] in France, returning to Siam to the Siamese military. During this time, he was granted the additional title ''Krom Luang Sukhothai'' (Prince of [[Sukhothai Province|Sukhothai]]). Prajadhipok lived a generally quiet life with his wife at their residence, [[Sukhothai Palace]], next to the [[Chao Phraya River]]. The couple had no children. Prajadhipok soon found himself rising rapidly in succession to the throne, as his brothers all died within a relatively short period. In 1925, King [[Vajiravudh]] himself died at the age of 44. Prajadhipok became absolute monarch at only thirty-two. He was crowned King of Siam on 25 February 1926.\n\n[[File:Royal portraits - 004 02.jpg|300px|left|Prajadhipok on his coronation day, wearing full traditional attire, sitting on the Phatthrabit Throne, surrounded by the court officers carrying his regalia and supplementary insignia|thumb]]\n\n[[File:King Prajadhipok on the Octagonal Throne.jpeg|thumb|250px|right|Coronation of King Prajadhipok inside the Phaisan Thaksin Hall, [[Grand Palace]] on 25 February 1926.]]\n\n==Last absolute monarch==\nRelatively unprepared for his new responsibilities, Prajadhipok was nevertheless intelligent, diplomatic in his dealings with others, modest, and eager to learn.<ref name=\"Wyatt, David K. 1982\" />{{RP|235}} However, he had inherited serious political and economic problems from his predecessor.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|30}} The budget was heavily in deficit, and the royal financial accounts were in serious disorder. The entire world was in the throes of the [[Great Depression]].\n[[File:King Prajadhipok portrait photograph.jpg|thumb|150px|left|King Prajadhipok]]\n\nIn an institutional innovation intended to restore confidence in the monarchy and government, Prajadhipok, in what was virtually his first act as king, announced the creation of the [[Supreme Council of the State of Siam]]. This council was made up of five experienced members of the royal family, although to emphasise the break with the previous reign the selected five had all fallen out of favour with the previous monarch.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|31}}  The council thus comprised three of the king's uncles, Prince Bhanurangsi, Prince Naris and Prince [[Damrong Rajanubhab]] and two of his half-brothers, Prince Kitiyakon (Prince Chantaburi) and Prince Boriphat.<ref name=\"Terwiel, B.J. 2005\" />{{RP|253}} \n\nMany of the Princes of the Supreme Council felt that it was their duty to make amends for the mistakes of the previous reign, but their acts were not generally appreciated, for the government failed to communicate to the public the purpose of the policies they pursued to rectify Vajiravudh's extreme financial extravagances.<ref name=\"Stowe, Judith A. 1990\">Stowe, Judith A. (1990) ''Siam Becomes Thailand''. Hurst & Company.</ref> Gradually these princes arrogated power to themselves, monopolising all the main ministerial positions and appointing their sons and brothers to both administrative and military posts. By April 1926 almost the entire cabinet of ministry heads had been replaced with newly appointed Princes or nobles, with only three former members being re-appointed.<ref name=\"Terwiel, B.J. 2005\" />{{RP|254}} While the family appointments brought back men of talent and experience, they also signalled a return to royal oligarchy. \n\nThe king clearly wished to demonstrate a clear break with the discredited sixth reign, and his choice of men to fill the top positions appeared to be guided largely by a wish to restore a Chulalongkorn-type government.<ref name=\"Terwiel, B.J. 2005\">Terwiel, B.J. (2005) ''Thailand's Political History: From the Fall of Ayutthaya to Recent Times''. River Books.</ref> Unlike his predecessor, the king read virtually all state papers that came his way, from ministerial submissions to petitions by citizens.<ref name=\"Terwiel, B.J. 2005\" />{{RP|255}} The king was painstaking and conscientious; he would elicit comments and suggestions from a range of experts and study them, noting the good points in each submission, but when various options were available he would seldom be able to select the best one and abandon others. He would often rely upon the Supreme Council to prod him in a particular direction.<ref name=\"Terwiel, B.J. 2005\" />{{RP|254}}\n\n[[File:King Prajadhipok (Rama VII) of Siam.jpg|thumb|180px|right|King Prajadhipok in [[Khrui]], carrying [[Dha (sword)|Krabi]].]]\n\nFrom the beginning of his reign King Prajadhipok was acutely aware that political change was necessary if the monarchy was to be preserved.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|130}} He viewed his newly established Supreme Council as an institutional check upon the powers of an absolute monarch.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|130}} During 1926, Prajadhipok experimented with using the Privy Council, which had over 200 members at that time, as a quasi-legislative body.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|134}} This large of an assembly proved too cumbersome, and in 1927 Prajadhipok created the Committee of the Privy Council consisting of 40 members selected from the royal family or nobility.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|135}} The committee was received positively by the press and was envisaged as a forerunner of a parliament or National Assembly.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|137\u2013139}} In practice however the committee remained relatively unimportant and sadly did not develop into a more powerful or representative body.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|137}}\n\nIn 1926 Prajadhipok wrote a lengthy memorandum to his American adviser [[Francis Bowes Sayre, Sr.|Francis B. Sayre]] titled \"Problems of Siam\" in which he set forth nine questions he felt were the most serious facing the nation. The third question asked whether Siam should have a parliamentary system, which Prajadhipok doubted. The fourth question asked whether Siam was ready for representative government, to which Prajadhipok answered \"my personal opinion is an emphatic NO\".<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|38}} However, the king did see a possibility to introduce reform at the local level as the \"next step in our educational move towards democracy\".<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|140}} In 1926 he began moves to develop the concept of ''prachaphiban'', or \"municipality\", which had emerged late in the fifth reign as a law regarding public health and sanitation.<ref>Sonthi Techanan (1976) ''Plans for Democratic Development in the Seventh Reign''. Kasetsart University.</ref> Information was obtained regarding local self-government in surrounding countries, and proposals to allow certain municipalities to raise local taxes and manage their own budgets were drawn up. The fact that the public was not sufficiently educated to make the scheme work militated against the success of this administrative venture. Nevertheless, the idea of teaching the Siamese the concept of democracy through a measure of decentralisation of power in municipalities had become, in Prajadhipok's mind, fundamental to future policy-making.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\">Batson, Benjamin. (1984) ''The End of the Absolute Monarchy in Siam''. Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\nIn September 1931 Britain abandoned the gold standard and devalued sterling by 30 percent.<ref name=\"Terwiel, B.J. 2005\" />{{RP|259}} This created a crisis for Siam since most of its foreign exchange was held in sterling.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|195}} The Minister of Finance kept Siam on the gold standard by linking the currency to the US dollar, but debate about this policy raged within the government into 1932.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|195\u2013196}} One impact of this policy was that Siam's rice exports became more expensive than competitor exporters, negatively impacting revenue.<ref name=\"Wyatt, David K. 1982\" />{{RP|240}}\n\nIn mid-October 1931 the king returned from a trip to Canada and the US and ordered [[Prince Devawongse Varoprakar]], the Minister of Foreign Affairs to prepare a constitution. The task of drafting this document was given to the American [[Raymond B. Stevens]] and Phaya Sri Wisarn Waja.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|148}} In March the following year they submitted an \"Outline of Changes in the Form of Government\" together with their comments<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|149}}. Prajadhipok originally planned to announce the new constitution to the nation of 6 April at the opening of the [[Memorial Bridge (Thailand)|Memorial Bridge]] to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Chakri dynasty.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|150}} These proposals met strong opposition from Prince Damrong and other royal members of the Supreme Council and despite his own misgivings that to not proceed would result in a coup against his government, the king ultimately did not make the planned announcement.\n\nOn 20 January 1932, with the country deep in depression, the king convened a \"round table\" meeting to discuss the many competing arguments and to agree on how to tackle the crisis.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|204}} From this meeting it was agreed to make large cuts in government spending and implement a retrenchment programme. Two weeks later on 5 February the king addressed a group of military officers and spoke at length about the economic situation. In this speech he remarked \"I myself know nothing at all about managing finances, and all I can do is listen to the opinions of others and choose the best...If I have made a mistake, I believe I really deserve to be excused by the people of Siam.\"<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|204}} No previous monarch had ever spoken so honestly.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|205}} The speech was widely reported and many interpreted his words not as a frank appeal for understanding and cooperation, but as a sign of weakness and proof that the system of rule of fallible autocrats should be abolished.<ref>Vella, Walter (1955) ''The Impact of the West on Government in Thailand''.

Their efforts culminated in an almost [[Siamese coup d'\u00e9tat of 1932|bloodless \"revolution\"]] on the morning of 24 June 1932 by the self-proclaimed [[Khana Ratsadon]] (''People's Party''; \u0e04\u0e13\u0e30\u0e23\u0e32\u0e29\u0e0e\u0e23).<ref name=\"Terwiel, B.J. 2005\" />{{RP|262}} While Prajadhipok was away at [[Klai Kangwon Palace]] in [[Hua Hin]], the plotters took control of the [[Ananda Samakhom Throne Hall]] in Bangkok and arrested key officials (mainly princes and relatives of the king).<ref name=\"Terwiel, B.J. 2005\" />{{RP|262}} The People's Party demanded Prajadhipok become a constitutional monarch and grant Thai people a constitution. In the event of a negative response, they reserved the right to declare Siam a republic. The king immediately accepted the People's Party's request and the first \"permanent\" constitution of Siam was promulgated on 10 December.<ref name=\"Terwiel, B.J. 2005\" />{{RP|263}}\n\nPrajadhipok returned to Bangkok on 26 June and received the coup plotters in a royal audience.

Absolute monarchy was finished.<ref name=\"Stowe, Judith A. 1990\"/>\n\n==First constitutional monarch==\n[[Image:Prajadhipok's coronation records - 001.jpg|thumb|200px|right|King Prajadhipok signs [[Constitution of Thailand#1932 Constitution|The Constitution of the Siam Kingdom 1932]] on 10 December 1932]]\n[[File:Royal portraits - 005 02.jpg|200px|thumb|King Prajadhipok of Siam, wearing the full traditional monarchical attire inside the Amarin Winitchai Throne Hall]]\n[[File:King Prajadhipok-TIME-1931.jpg|thumb|King Prajadhipok on [[Time (magazine)|TIME magazine]] cover in 1931|alt=]]\nThe king's relations with the People's Party deteriorated quickly, particularly after the [[Siamese coup d'\u00e9tat of 1933|ousting]] of [[Phraya Manopakorn Nititada]] as prime minister by the Khana Ratsadon's leader [[Phot Phahonyothin|Phraya Phahol Phonphayuhasena]].\n\nIn October 1933, the maverick Prince [[Boworadej]], a popular former minister of defence who had resigned from Prajadhipok's cabinet in protest over the budget cuts, led an armed revolt against the government. In the [[Boworadet Rebellion]], he mobilised several provincial garrisons and marched on Bangkok, occupying the [[Don Mueang International Airport|Don Muang]] aerodrome. Prince Boworadej accused the government of being disrespectful to the monarch and of promoting communism, and demanded that government leaders resign. Boworadej had hoped that garrisons in the Bangkok would support him, but their commander ensured that they remained loyal to the government. The [[Royal Thai Navy]] declared itself neutral and left for its bases in the south. After heavy fighting near Don Muang, the ammunition-short Boworadej forces were defeated and the prince himself fled to exile in [[French Indochina]].\n\nThere is no evidence that Prajadhipok gave any support to the rebellion.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\"/><ref name=\"Wyatt, David K. 1982\">Wyatt, David K. (1982) ''Thailand: A Short History''. New Haven.</ref> Nevertheless, the insurrection diminished the king's prestige. When the revolt began, Prajadhipok immediately informed the government that he regretted the strife and civil disturbances. The royal couple then took refuge at [[Songkhla]], in the far south. The king's withdrawal from the scene was interpreted by the Khana Ratsadorn as a failure to do his duty. By not throwing his full support behind government forces, he had undermined their trust in him.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\"/>\n\nIn 1934 the Assembly voted to amend civil and military penal codes. One of the proposed changes would allow death sentences to be carried out without the king's approval.<ref>''Bangkok Times Weekly Magazine'' ( 22 August 1934).</ref> The king protested, and in two letters submitted to the Assembly said that ending this time-honoured custom would make the people think that the government desired the right to sign death warrants to eliminate political opponents. As a compromise he proposed holding a national referendum on the issue.<ref>Sivaram, M. (1936) ''The New Siam in the Making''. Bangkok.</ref>\n\nMany in the Assembly were angered. They felt the king was implying that the Assembly did not actually represent the will of the people and voted to re-affirm the penal code changes.<ref>''Bangkok Times Weekly Magazine'' ( 1 October 1934).</ref>\n\nPrajadhipok, whose relations with the Khana Ratsadorn had been deteriorating for some time, went on a tour of Europe before visiting England for medical treatment. He continued to correspond with the government regarding the conditions under which he would continue to serve. As well as retaining some traditional royal prerogatives, such as granting pardons, he was anxious to mitigate the increasingly undemocratic nature of the new regime.<ref name=\"Wyatt, David K. 1982\"/> Agreement was reached on the penal codes, but Prajadhipok indicated he was unwilling to return home until guarantees were made for his safety, and the constitution was amended to make the Assembly an entirely elected body. The government refused to comply, and on 14 October Prajadhipok announced his intention to abdicate unless his requests were met.\n\n=== King Prajadhipok's trip to Europe ===\n{{Expand section|date=August 2019}}<gallery class=\"central\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:Hitler and Rama VII.jpg|King Prajadhipok and [[Adolf Hitler]] at [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport]] in Nazi Germany, 1934\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2005-0524-508, Berlin, Ankunft des siamesischen K\u00f6nigspaares.jpg|King Prajadhipok and Queen [[Rambhai Barni]] with [[Konstantin von Neurath]] in Nazi Germany, 1934\n</gallery>\n\n==Abdication==\n\n[[File:Rama VII Train.jpeg|thumb|275px|Prajadhipok looking outside a train]]\nThe People's Party rejected the ultimatum, and on 2 March 1935, Prajadhipok abdicated, to be replaced by [[Ananda Mahidol]]. Prajadhipok issued a brief statement criticising the regime that included the following phrases, since often quoted by critics of Thailand's slow political development.\n\n{{cquote|''I am willing to surrender the powers I formerly exercised to the people as a whole, but I am not willing to turn them over to any individual or any group to use in an autocratic manner without heeding the voice of the people.'' |cquote}}\n\nAs an idealistic democrat{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}, the former king had good grounds for complaint.<ref name=\"Terwiel, B.J. 2005\"/> The Executive Committee and Cabinet did not seem eager to develop an atmosphere of debate or to be guided by resolutions of the Assembly.\n\nReaction to the abdication was muted. Everybody was afraid of what might happen next. The government refrained from challenging any assertions in the king's abdication statement for fear of arousing further controversy. Opponents of the government kept quiet because they felt intimidated and forsaken by the king whom they regarded as the only person capable of standing up to the regime. In other words, the absolutism of the monarchy had been replaced by that of the People's Party, with the military looming in the wings as the ultimate arbiter of power.<ref name=\"Stowe, Judith A. 1990\"/>\n\n==Life after abdication and death==\n[[File:King Prajadhipok and Queen Rambhai Barni with British Premier Ramsay Macdonald in 1934.jpg|thumb|200px|King Prajadhipok and Queen [[Rambhai Barni]] with British Premier [[Ramsay MacDonald]] at Number [[10 Downing Street]]]]\n\nPrajadhipok spent the rest of his life with Queen [[Rambhai Barni]] in England. At the time of abdication, the couple lived at [[Knowle House]], in [[Surrey]], just outside London. However, this house was not suitable considering his health, so they moved to a smaller house in Virginia Water (still in Surrey), but with more space. The house was named \"Hangmoor\", but wishing to give it a more pleasant name, he called it \"Glen Pammant\", an anagram of an old Thai phrase ''tam pleng nam''.{{CN|date=February 2019}}  They remained there for two years. The couple had no children, but adopted the infant grandson of one of King Chulalongkorn's full brothers.\n\nThe adopted son, Prince Suprabhat Chirasakti (or Jirasakdi), would later serve as a pilot in Britain's [[Air Transport Auxiliary]] during the [[Second World War]], with the rank of Second Officer (S/O). He died on Saturday, 12 September, 1942, while delivering a [[Hawker Hurricane|Hawker Sea Hurricane IIC]] (JS346) from RAF Kirkbride aerodrome near [[Kirkbride, Cumbria|Kirkbride]], [[Cumbria]]. S/O Prince Prince Chirasakti, known as ''Cherry'' by his friends in the ATA, took off along with F/O Forbes (a volunteer from the United States) in very cloudy conditions shortly after 1200 Hrs and flew northward. Forbes returned alone within fifteen minutes. S/O Prince Prince Chirasakti was reported overdue at his destination (Arbroath) at 18:00 Hrs. By midnight it had been learnt that he had crashed into a hill near at Eweslees Farm, [[Langholm]], in Scotland. He had ''entered a blind valley in low cloud, tried to turn, flew into a hill and was killed. He had his flaps down, and was nor flying very fast. \"Just fast enough to kill him,\"'' the investigating officer reported to his colleagues. His friend, Third Officer Roy William Reisert (another American volunteer who had trained for the RAF at the [[Bermuda Flying School]] before joining the ATA) and F/O Davy were given the task of clearing his personal effects from his locker at RAF Kirkbride. Reisert wrote ''I picked up the large brown and white calf-skin purse which he prized and often carried--and dropped it in the box for shipment to his homeland--Siam''. S/O Prince Prince Chirasakti funeral was held at Golder's Green Crematorium in London on Wednesday, 16 September. Reisert flew over his crash site in a [[Fairchild 24|Fairchild Argus]] on the same day.<ref>''Old Pilots Never Die They Just Fly Away'', by Roy William Reisert.

Prince Prajadhipok was the youngest of nine children born to the couple. Overall he was the king's second-youngest child (of a total of 77), and the 33rd and youngest of Chulalongkorn's sons.<ref name=\"Soravij\">{{cite web |last1=Bhorombhakdi |first1=Soravij |title=HM King Prajadhipok |url=http://www.soravij.com/royalty/rama7/rama7.html |website=The Siamese Royalty A Personal Fascination |accessdate=20 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nUnlikely to succeed to the throne, Prince Prajadhipok chose to pursue a military career. Like many of the king's children, he was sent abroad to study, going to [[Eton College]] in 1906, then to the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich|Woolwich Military Academy]] from which he graduated in 1913. He received a commission in the [[Royal Horse Artillery]] in the [[British Army]] based in [[Aldershot]]. In 1910 Chulalongkorn died and was succeeded by Prajadhipok's older brother (also a son of Queen Saovabha), [[Crown Prince of Thailand|Crown Prince]] [[Vajiravudh]], who became King Rama VI. Prince Prajadhipok was by then commissioned in both the British Army and the Royal Siamese Army. With the outbreak of the [[First World War]] and the declaration of Siamese neutrality, King [[Vajiravudh]] ordered his younger brother to resign his British commission and return to Siam immediately, a great embarrassment to the prince, who wanted to serve with his men on the Western front. Once home, Prajadhipok became a high-ranking military official in Siam. In 1917 he was ordained temporarily as a monk,<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|30}} as was customary for most Buddhist Siamese men.\n\nIn August 1918 Prince Prajadhipok married his childhood friend and cousin [[Rambhai Barni]], a descendant of King Mongkut (Prajadhipok's grandfather) and his Royal Consort [[Piam]]. They were married at [[Sukhothai Palace]] which was a wedding gift to the couple from Queen [[Saovabha]].<ref name=\"Soravij\" />\n\nAfter the war in Europe ended, he attended the [[\u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr|\u00c9cole Superieure de Guerre]] in France, returning to Siam to the Siamese military. During this time, he was granted the additional title ''Krom Luang Sukhothai'' (Prince of [[Sukhothai Province|Sukhothai]]). Prajadhipok lived a generally quiet life with his wife at their residence, [[Sukhothai Palace]], next to the [[Chao Phraya River]]. The couple had no children. Prajadhipok soon found himself rising rapidly in succession to the throne, as his brothers all died within a relatively short period. In 1925, King [[Vajiravudh]] himself died at the age of 44. Prajadhipok became absolute monarch at only thirty-two. He was crowned King of Siam on 25 February 1926.\n\n[[File:Royal portraits - 004 02.jpg|300px|left|Prajadhipok on his coronation day, wearing full traditional attire, sitting on the Phatthrabit Throne, surrounded by the court officers carrying his regalia and supplementary insignia|thumb]]\n\n[[File:King Prajadhipok on the Octagonal Throne.jpeg|thumb|250px|right|Coronation of King Prajadhipok inside the Phaisan Thaksin Hall, [[Grand Palace]] on 25 February 1926.]]\n\n==Last absolute monarch==\nRelatively unprepared for his new responsibilities, Prajadhipok was nevertheless intelligent, diplomatic in his dealings with others, modest, and eager to learn.<ref name=\"Wyatt, David K. 1982\" />{{RP|235}} However, he had inherited serious political and economic problems from his predecessor.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|30}} The budget was heavily in deficit, and the royal financial accounts were in serious disorder. The entire world was in the throes of the [[Great Depression]].\n[[File:King Prajadhipok portrait photograph.jpg|thumb|150px|left|King Prajadhipok]]\n\nIn an institutional innovation intended to restore confidence in the monarchy and government, Prajadhipok, in what was virtually his first act as king, announced the creation of the [[Supreme Council of the State of Siam]]. This council was made up of five experienced members of the royal family, although to emphasise the break with the previous reign the selected five had all fallen out of favour with the previous monarch.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|31}}  The council thus comprised three of the king's uncles, Prince Bhanurangsi, Prince Naris and Prince [[Damrong Rajanubhab]] and two of his half-brothers, Prince Kitiyakon (Prince Chantaburi) and Prince Boriphat.<ref name=\"Terwiel, B.J. 2005\" />{{RP|253}} \n\nMany of the Princes of the Supreme Council felt that it was their duty to make amends for the mistakes of the previous reign, but their acts were not generally appreciated, for the government failed to communicate to the public the purpose of the policies they pursued to rectify Vajiravudh's extreme financial extravagances.<ref name=\"Stowe, Judith A. 1990\">Stowe, Judith A. (1990) ''Siam Becomes Thailand''. Hurst & Company.</ref> Gradually these princes arrogated power to themselves, monopolising all the main ministerial positions and appointing their sons and brothers to both administrative and military posts. By April 1926 almost the entire cabinet of ministry heads had been replaced with newly appointed Princes or nobles, with only three former members being re-appointed.<ref name=\"Terwiel, B.J. 2005\" />{{RP|254}} While the family appointments brought back men of talent and experience, they also signalled a return to royal oligarchy. \n\nThe king clearly wished to demonstrate a clear break with the discredited sixth reign, and his choice of men to fill the top positions appeared to be guided largely by a wish to restore a Chulalongkorn-type government.<ref name=\"Terwiel, B.J. 2005\">Terwiel, B.J.

River Books.</ref> Unlike his predecessor, the king read virtually all state papers that came his way, from ministerial submissions to petitions by citizens.<ref name=\"Terwiel, B.J. 2005\" />{{RP|255}} The king was painstaking and conscientious; he would elicit comments and suggestions from a range of experts and study them, noting the good points in each submission, but when various options were available he would seldom be able to select the best one and abandon others. He would often rely upon the Supreme Council to prod him in a particular direction.<ref name=\"Terwiel, B.J. 2005\" />{{RP|254}}\n\n[[File:King Prajadhipok (Rama VII) of Siam.jpg|thumb|180px|right|King Prajadhipok in [[Khrui]], carrying [[Dha (sword)|Krabi]].]]\n\nFrom the beginning of his reign King Prajadhipok was acutely aware that political change was necessary if the monarchy was to be preserved.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|130}} He viewed his newly established Supreme Council as an institutional check upon the powers of an absolute monarch.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|130}} During 1926, Prajadhipok experimented with using the Privy Council, which had over 200 members at that time, as a quasi-legislative body.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|134}} This large of an assembly proved too cumbersome, and in 1927 Prajadhipok created the Committee of the Privy Council consisting of 40 members selected from the royal family or nobility.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|135}} The committee was received positively by the press and was envisaged as a forerunner of a parliament or National Assembly.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|137\u2013139}} In practice however the committee remained relatively unimportant and sadly did not develop into a more powerful or representative body.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|137}}\n\nIn 1926 Prajadhipok wrote a lengthy memorandum to his American adviser [[Francis Bowes Sayre, Sr.|Francis B. Sayre]] titled \"Problems of Siam\" in which he set forth nine questions he felt were the most serious facing the nation. The third question asked whether Siam should have a parliamentary system, which Prajadhipok doubted. The fourth question asked whether Siam was ready for representative government, to which Prajadhipok answered \"my personal opinion is an emphatic NO\".<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|38}} However, the king did see a possibility to introduce reform at the local level as the \"next step in our educational move towards democracy\".<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|140}} In 1926 he began moves to develop the concept of ''prachaphiban'', or \"municipality\", which had emerged late in the fifth reign as a law regarding public health and sanitation.<ref>Sonthi Techanan (1976) ''Plans for Democratic Development in the Seventh Reign''. Kasetsart University.</ref> Information was obtained regarding local self-government in surrounding countries, and proposals to allow certain municipalities to raise local taxes and manage their own budgets were drawn up. The fact that the public was not sufficiently educated to make the scheme work militated against the success of this administrative venture. Nevertheless, the idea of teaching the Siamese the concept of democracy through a measure of decentralisation of power in municipalities had become, in Prajadhipok's mind, fundamental to future policy-making.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\">Batson, Benjamin. (1984) ''The End of the Absolute Monarchy in Siam''. Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\nIn September 1931 Britain abandoned the gold standard and devalued sterling by 30 percent.<ref name=\"Terwiel, B.J. 2005\" />{{RP|259}} This created a crisis for Siam since most of its foreign exchange was held in sterling.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|195}} The Minister of Finance kept Siam on the gold standard by linking the currency to the US dollar, but debate about this policy raged within the government into 1932.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|195\u2013196}} One impact of this policy was that Siam's rice exports became more expensive than competitor exporters, negatively impacting revenue.<ref name=\"Wyatt, David K. 1982\" />{{RP|240}}\n\nIn mid-October 1931 the king returned from a trip to Canada and the US and ordered [[Prince Devawongse Varoprakar]], the Minister of Foreign Affairs to prepare a constitution. The task of drafting this document was given to the American [[Raymond B. Stevens]] and Phaya Sri Wisarn Waja.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|148}} In March the following year they submitted an \"Outline of Changes in the Form of Government\" together with their comments<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|149}}. Prajadhipok originally planned to announce the new constitution to the nation of 6 April at the opening of the [[Memorial Bridge (Thailand)|Memorial Bridge]] to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Chakri dynasty.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|150}} These proposals met strong opposition from Prince Damrong and other royal members of the Supreme Council and despite his own misgivings that to not proceed would result in a coup against his government, the king ultimately did not make the planned announcement.\n\nOn 20 January 1932, with the country deep in depression, the king convened a \"round table\" meeting to discuss the many competing arguments and to agree on how to tackle the crisis.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|204}} From this meeting it was agreed to make large cuts in government spending and implement a retrenchment programme. Two weeks later on 5 February the king addressed a group of military officers and spoke at length about the economic situation. In this speech he remarked \"I myself know nothing at all about managing finances, and all I can do is listen to the opinions of others and choose the best...If I have made a mistake, I believe I really deserve to be excused by the people of Siam.\"<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|204}} No previous monarch had ever spoken so honestly.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\" />{{RP|205}} The speech was widely reported and many interpreted his words not as a frank appeal for understanding and cooperation, but as a sign of weakness and proof that the system of rule of fallible autocrats should be abolished.<ref>Vella, Walter (1955) ''The Impact of the West on Government in Thailand''.

In the [[Boworadet Rebellion]], he mobilised several provincial garrisons and marched on Bangkok, occupying the [[Don Mueang International Airport|Don Muang]] aerodrome. Prince Boworadej accused the government of being disrespectful to the monarch and of promoting communism, and demanded that government leaders resign. Boworadej had hoped that garrisons in the Bangkok would support him, but their commander ensured that they remained loyal to the government. The [[Royal Thai Navy]] declared itself neutral and left for its bases in the south. After heavy fighting near Don Muang, the ammunition-short Boworadej forces were defeated and the prince himself fled to exile in [[French Indochina]].\n\nThere is no evidence that Prajadhipok gave any support to the rebellion.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\"/><ref name=\"Wyatt, David K. 1982\">Wyatt, David K. (1982) ''Thailand: A Short History''. New Haven.</ref> Nevertheless, the insurrection diminished the king's prestige. When the revolt began, Prajadhipok immediately informed the government that he regretted the strife and civil disturbances. The royal couple then took refuge at [[Songkhla]], in the far south. The king's withdrawal from the scene was interpreted by the Khana Ratsadorn as a failure to do his duty. By not throwing his full support behind government forces, he had undermined their trust in him.<ref name=\"Batson, Benjamin 1984\"/>\n\nIn 1934 the Assembly voted to amend civil and military penal codes. One of the proposed changes would allow death sentences to be carried out without the king's approval.<ref>''Bangkok Times Weekly Magazine'' ( 22 August 1934).</ref> The king protested, and in two letters submitted to the Assembly said that ending this time-honoured custom would make the people think that the government desired the right to sign death warrants to eliminate political opponents. As a compromise he proposed holding a national referendum on the issue.<ref>Sivaram, M. (1936) ''The New Siam in the Making''. Bangkok.</ref>\n\nMany in the Assembly were angered. They felt the king was implying that the Assembly did not actually represent the will of the people and voted to re-affirm the penal code changes.<ref>''Bangkok Times Weekly Magazine'' ( 1 October 1934).</ref>\n\nPrajadhipok, whose relations with the Khana Ratsadorn had been deteriorating for some time, went on a tour of Europe before visiting England for medical treatment. He continued to correspond with the government regarding the conditions under which he would continue to serve. As well as retaining some traditional royal prerogatives, such as granting pardons, he was anxious to mitigate the increasingly undemocratic nature of the new regime.<ref name=\"Wyatt, David K. 1982\"/> Agreement was reached on the penal codes, but Prajadhipok indicated he was unwilling to return home until guarantees were made for his safety, and the constitution was amended to make the Assembly an entirely elected body. The government refused to comply, and on 14 October Prajadhipok announced his intention to abdicate unless his requests were met.\n\n=== King Prajadhipok's trip to Europe ===\n{{Expand section|date=August 2019}}<gallery class=\"central\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:Hitler and Rama VII.jpg|King Prajadhipok and [[Adolf Hitler]] at [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport]] in Nazi Germany, 1934\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2005-0524-508, Berlin, Ankunft des siamesischen K\u00f6nigspaares.jpg|King Prajadhipok and Queen [[Rambhai Barni]] with [[Konstantin von Neurath]] in Nazi Germany, 1934\n</gallery>\n\n==Abdication==\n\n[[File:Rama VII Train.jpeg|thumb|275px|Prajadhipok looking outside a train]]\nThe People's Party rejected the ultimatum, and on 2 March 1935, Prajadhipok abdicated, to be replaced by [[Ananda Mahidol]]. Prajadhipok issued a brief statement criticising the regime that included the following phrases, since often quoted by critics of Thailand's slow political development.\n\n{{cquote|''I am willing to surrender the powers I formerly exercised to the people as a whole, but I am not willing to turn them over to any individual or any group to use in an autocratic manner without heeding the voice of the people.'' |cquote}}\n\nAs an idealistic democrat{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}, the former king had good grounds for complaint.<ref name=\"Terwiel, B.J. 2005\"/> The Executive Committee and Cabinet did not seem eager to develop an atmosphere of debate or to be guided by resolutions of the Assembly.\n\nReaction to the abdication was muted. Everybody was afraid of what might happen next. The government refrained from challenging any assertions in the king's abdication statement for fear of arousing further controversy. Opponents of the government kept quiet because they felt intimidated and forsaken by the king whom they regarded as the only person capable of standing up to the regime. In other words, the absolutism of the monarchy had been replaced by that of the People's Party, with the military looming in the wings as the ultimate arbiter of power.<ref name=\"Stowe, Judith A. 1990\"/>\n\n==Life after abdication and death==\n[[File:King Prajadhipok and Queen Rambhai Barni with British Premier Ramsay Macdonald in 1934.jpg|thumb|200px|King Prajadhipok and Queen [[Rambhai Barni]] with British Premier [[Ramsay MacDonald]] at Number [[10 Downing Street]]]]\n\nPrajadhipok spent the rest of his life with Queen [[Rambhai Barni]] in England. At the time of abdication, the couple lived at [[Knowle House]], in [[Surrey]], just outside London. However, this house was not suitable considering his health, so they moved to a smaller house in Virginia Water (still in Surrey), but with more space. The house was named \"Hangmoor\", but wishing to give it a more pleasant name, he called it \"Glen Pammant\", an anagram of an old Thai phrase ''tam pleng nam''.{{CN|date=February 2019}}  They remained there for two years. The couple had no children, but adopted the infant grandson of one of King Chulalongkorn's full brothers. The adopted son, Prince Suprabhat Chirasakti (or Jirasakdi), would later serve as a pilot in Britain's [[Air Transport Auxiliary]] during the [[Second World War]], with the rank of Second Officer (S/O). He died on Saturday, 12 September, 1942, while delivering a [[Hawker Hurricane|Hawker Sea Hurricane IIC]] (JS346) from RAF Kirkbride aerodrome near [[Kirkbride, Cumbria|Kirkbride]], [[Cumbria]]. S/O Prince Prince Chirasakti, known as ''Cherry'' by his friends in the ATA, took off along with F/O Forbes (a volunteer from the United States) in very cloudy conditions shortly after 1200 Hrs and flew northward. Forbes returned alone within fifteen minutes. S/O Prince Prince Chirasakti was reported overdue at his destination (Arbroath) at 18:00 Hrs. By midnight it had been learnt that he had crashed into a hill near at Eweslees Farm, [[Langholm]], in Scotland. He had ''entered a blind valley in low cloud, tried to turn, flew into a hill and was killed. He had his flaps down, and was nor flying very fast. \"Just fast enough to kill him,\"'' the investigating officer reported to his colleagues. His friend, Third Officer Roy William Reisert (another American volunteer who had trained for the RAF at the [[Bermuda Flying School]] before joining the ATA) and F/O Davy were given the task of clearing his personal effects from his locker at RAF Kirkbride. Reisert wrote ''I picked up the large brown and white calf-skin purse which he prized and often carried--and dropped it in the box for shipment to his homeland--Siam''. S/O Prince Prince Chirasakti funeral was held at Golder's Green Crematorium in London on Wednesday, 16 September. Reisert flew over his crash site in a [[Fairchild 24|Fairchild Argus]] on the same day.<ref>''Old Pilots Never Die They Just Fly Away'', by Roy William Reisert.

The funeral was attended by the ex-Queen of Thailand, Prince Abbhas, Prince Birabongse, Mme Nuprabandh, Captain and Mrs JB Wyndham, the Earl of Derby, Captain HJ Stocks (Flying Establishment Officer, ATA, representing the RAF) and Flight Lieutenant J Gallatly (representing the ATA).<ref>''The Times'', London, 17 September, 1942</ref>\n\nThey moved again to Vane Court, the oldest house in the village of [[Biddenden]] in Kent. He led a peaceful life there, gardening in the morning and writing his autobiography in the afternoon.\n\nIn 1938 the royal couple moved to [[Compton House (Surrey)|Compton House]], in the village of [[Wentworth, Surrey|Wentworth]] in [[Virginia Water]], Surrey.\n\nDue to [[Battle of Britain|bombing]] by the German [[Luftwaffe]] in 1940, the couple again moved, first to a small house in [[Devon]], and then to [[Lake Vyrnwy Hotel]] in [[Powys]], [[Wales]], where the former king suffered a heart attack.\n\nThe couple returned to Compton House, as he expressed his preference to die there. King Prajadhipok died from heart failure on 30 May 1941.\n\nHis cremation was held at the [[Golders Green Crematorium]] in north London.<ref>https://www.silpa-mag.com/old-photos-tell-the-historical-story/article_12544</ref> It was a simple affair attended by just Queen Ramphai and a handful of close relatives. Queen Ramphaiphanni stayed at Compton House for a further eight years before she returned to Thailand in 1949, bringing the king's ashes back with her.<ref>https://lifestyle.campus-star.com/knowledge/88087.html</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{Page numbers needed|date=March 2016|section}}\n\nAmong the recent Chakri monarchs, particularly Chulalongkorn and Bhumibol, Prajadhipok emerged with relatively little revisionistic detraction.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} He was a hard-working{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}, effective administrator who was intellectually equal to the demands of his office{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}, and whose main failing was to underestimate the Bangkok elite's growing demand for power.

The team's current head football coach is [[Tyson Helton]]. The Hilltoppers play their home games at [[Houchens Industries\u2013L. T. Smith Stadium]] in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]].<ref>[https://wkusports.com/documents/2019/7/17/2019_WKU_Football_Media_Guide.pdf WKU Football Media Guide retrieved 31 March 2020.]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early history (1908\u20131947) ===\n\n====L.T. Smith and World War I (1908\u20131921)====\nWestern Kentucky first fielded a football team in 1908 but did not start playing sanctioned games until the 1913 season. M.A. Leiper and Roy Manchester are the first noted coaches for WKU. The two men teamed up to coach the Hilltoppers for their inaugural season which solely consisted of a 20\u20130 win over Elizabethtown. J.L. Arthur then took over the program for three years from 1914 to 1916, coaching a total of 14 games, 6 of which were against [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|Eastern Kentucky]]. From 1917 to 1919 the Hilltoppers didn't compete in football from due to World War I. In 1920, L. T. Smith, whose name bears the Hilltoppers' home stadium, took the reins and coached the team for two seasons.\n\n====Edgar Diddle (1922\u20131928)====\nFrom 1922 to 1928, the Hilltoppers saw their first success as Coach [[Edgar Diddle|E.A. Diddle]] took over the football program for seven seasons leading them to four winning seasons while also coaching the [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|WKU Hilltoppers basketball team]]. Diddle, who was a dual-athlete himself, encouraged his players to participate in multiple sports so they could stay in shape. His [[1922 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|first team]] set a school record for wins that would stand for 41 years and his [[1928 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|last team]] claimed to be state champions.<ref name=\"Ruby\">{{cite book| last = Ruby| first = Earl| title = Red Towel Territory : A History of Athletics at Western Kentucky University| publisher = American National Bank and Trust Co.| year = 1979|}}</ref>  When he retired from coaching football in 1928, Diddle posted a record of 38\u201324\u20132. The Hilltoppers outscored opponents 171\u20137 in Diddle's final year of coaching the program.\n\n====Carl Anderson (1929\u20131937)====\nAfter Diddle left the football program to focus on coaching basketball, WKU football went through a series of instability in coaching but also a series of 9 winning seasons. In 1929, [[Carl Anderson (American football)|Carl \"Swede\" Anderson]] took over as head coach leading the Hilltoppers to a 7\u20133 record before leaving to take the head coach job over the [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State]] freshman football team. In [[1930 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1930]], James Elam led the Hilltoppers to a 16\u20135\u20131 record during his two seasons. Ernie Miller then took over in [[1932 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1932]] seasons going 7\u20131 during his lone season before Jesse Thomas took over for the 1933 season going 6\u20132. In 1934, Carl Anderson returned for a second stint with the Hilltoppers where he served as head coach through the [[1937 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1937]] season posting a 24\u20139\u20133 record with wins over EKU in all four seasons. The Hilltoppers were very successful in this era posting an outstanding a 60\u201320\u20134 record.\n\n====Gander Terry and World War II (1938\u20131947)====\nAfter Anderson left the hill once again, this time to be an assistant coach at [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]], the Hilltoppers selected \"[[Gander Terry]] to lead the program. In their four seasons under Terry, the Hilltoppers went 25\u20139\u20133 beating rivals [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|[Middle Tennessee]] and Eastern Kentucky in every game they played. Terry left the program after the 1941 season following a 4\u20135\u20131 record, the Hilltopper's first losing season since 1925. Arnold Winkenhofer took over in 1942 coaching the Toppers for one season before the program was stopped from 1943 to 1945 due to World War II. In 1946, Jesse Thomas returned to the Hill for his second stint as head coach. Thomas only stuck around WKU two more seasons with much less success than his first go around posting a 5\u201310\u20132 record.\n\n=== The Jimmy Feix era (1948\u20131988) ===\n\n====Jack Clayton (1948\u20131956)====\n[[Jack Clayton (American football)|Jack Clayton]] provided some much-needed stability to the WKU football program where he served as head coach for 9 seasons. In 1949, after losing the first two games to start the season, Clayton started a freshman quarterback by the name of [[Jimmy Feix]] winning 5 of the last 7 games that season. By [[1952 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1952]], with Feix now in his senior year, Clayton coached WKU to their first [[Ohio Valley Conference]] championship, tied the [[1922 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|school record]] for wins, and the school's first bowl appearance, winning 34\u201319 over [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] in the [[Refrigerator Bowl]], finishing the season 9\u20131. Feix became the first WKU football athlete ever to earn All-America honors after posting the highest pass completion percentage in the nation (.612). Under Clayton, the Hilltoppers posted a record of 50\u201333\u20132 before he left to coach at [[Northwestern State Demons football|Northwestern Louisiana State College]], his alma mater.\n\n====Nick Denes (1957\u20131967)====\n[[Nick Denes]], who was also a [[WKU Hilltoppers baseball]] head coach and for who, [[Nick Denes Field]] is named, coached WKU football for 11 seasons. In his time on the Hill, Denes compiled a 57\u201339\u20137 record for a .587 winning percentage. In [[1963 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1963]], Denes led the Hilltoppers to their second bowl game victory, defeating Coast Guard 27\u20130 in the [[Tangerine Bowl (1947\u20131982)|Tangerine Bowl]], a season where the Hilltoppers went 10\u20130\u20131 and set a new [[1952 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|school record]] for wins. Denes retired after the [[1967 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1967]] season following a 42\u201319 win over [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]].\n\n====Jimmy Feix and NCAA Division I-AA transition (1968\u20131983)====\nAfter serving under Nick Denes as an assistant coach for all 11 seasons, [[Jimmy Feix]] was promoted to head coach. In his 16 seasons at the helm, Feix compiled an impressive 105\u201356\u20136 record (.6488). His 14 teams that competed in the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] went 67\u201328\u20132 (.701) in conference play. The Hilltoppers won six Ohio Valley Conference championships between 1970 and 1980. Feix became the most successful and longest-tenured coach in Western Kentucky football history while leading the Hilltoppers in a transition from [[NCAA Division II]] to [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|NCAA Division I-AA]] (now FCS).\n\nIn 1973, the Hilltoppers went undefeated in the regular season before competing in the first-year NCAA Division II championship playoffs. They made it to the championship game against [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football|Louisiana Tech]] coming up just short and finishing the season 12\u20131. In 1975, the Hilltoppers made the playoff field again advancing to the title game for the second time, but once again having to settle for runner-up honors finishing their season with an 11\u20132 record.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/26709537/wku-coaching-legend-jimmy-feix-dies|title=WKU coaching legend Jimmy Feix dies|last=Lewis|first=John|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nFeix was named OVC Coach of the Year in 1973, 1978 and 1980 and remains the winningest football coach in WKU history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alumni.wku.edu/s/808/index.aspx?pgid=1777&gid=1|title=WKU Alumni Association \u2013 Mr. Jimmy Feix|website=alumni.wku.edu|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Feix coached 16 athletes who followed him on the list of WKU football All-Americans.\n\n====Dave Roberts (1983\u20131988)====\nFeix retired as head coach moving to work in Alumni Affairs for two years before taking over as Director of Athletics in 1986. In his vacancy, the Hilltoppers hired former [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]] assistant [[Dave Roberts (American football)|Dave Roberts]] to be the head coach with hopes of continuing what Feix started. Roberts struggled through his first three seasons posting a record 10\u201322\u20131 before turning things around. In 1987 and 1988 Roberts took the Hilltoppers to the [[NCAA Division I-AA playoffs]] coming up short to rival EKU both years. After the 1988 season, Roberts left Western Kentucky for the [[Louisiana\u2013Monroe Warhawks football|Northeast Louisiana]] head coaching job. Though going 16\u20138 in his last two season, Roberts left with a 26\u201330\u20131 record becoming the first Hilltopper coach to leave with a losing record in over 60 years.\n\n=== The Jack Harbaugh era and FBS transition (1989\u20132009) ===\n\n==== Jack Harbaugh (1989\u20132002) ====\n[[Jack Harbaugh]] served as the Hilltoppers head football coach for 14 seasons, compiling a 91\u201368 record, three 10+ win seasons, two conference championships (OVC 2000, Gateway 2002) and the 2002 [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA National Championship]]. Harbaugh took the Hilltopper football program from the depths of despair in the early 1990s to its best stretch since the legendary [[Jimmy Feix]] coached on the Hill.\n\nIn 1992, WKU was on the verge of losing its football program after a state-mandated $6.1 million budget cut. Harbaugh was notified of the plans to shut down the program just before spring practice was about to begin. Having already made up his mind that he was not going to quit, he talked with his players left them a choice: accept defeat and leave, or fight to stay. Now known as the 1992 \"Save the Program\" team, every player decided to stay, fight, and work to save WKU football. While Harbaugh and the team did their part, former WKU quarterback, coach and athletics director at the time, Jimmy Feix, started an emergency fundraising campaign writing letters and making calls to former WKU players, urging them to buy season tickets. All the efforts paid off and on April 30, 1992, the WKU Board of Regents voted to allow football to stay but with a reduced budget.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/wku-program-savers-re-unite-on-saturday/article_cb65a9f8-0395-11e2-9bca-001a4bcf6878.html|title=WKU 'Program Savers' re-unite on Saturday|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> The Hilltoppers finished the 1992 season with a losing record of 4\u20136. As the budget remained tight over the next few years WKU managed an 8-3 record in 1993 before having back-to-back losing seasons.\n\nNo one ever doubted Harbaugh's ability to coach but he clearly needed better players. In 1994, with unwavering faith in their father, both of his sons, [[Jim Harbaugh]] and [[John Harbaugh]], decided to help however they could. While still playing in the NFL, Jim joined the WKU football coaching staff as an NCAA-certified unpaid assistant which allowed him to recruit. John, on the other hand, was a coach at [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]] and could rely on his scouting services, deep contacts, and endless high school game footage to help out.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl--harbaugh-sons-used-unconventional-means-to-help-father-build-college-football-powerhouse-053413373.html|title=Harbaugh sons used unconventional means to help father build college football powerhouse|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Jim set out and started contacting recruits, his first being [[Willie Taggart]], an All-American and four-year starter at quarterback for WKU. Jim also recruited future NFL players [[Rod Smart]] and [[Mel Mitchell]] to WKU as well as 17 players on the 2002 national championship team.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/49ers/article/How-Jim-Harbaugh-saved-dad-s-program-4230790.php|title=How Jim Harbaugh saved dad's program|newspaper=SFGate|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nThe Hilltoppers went 7-4 in 1996 behind the arm and legs of quarterback Willie Taggart which started a long series of winning seasons. Jack and his wife Jackie are credited with saving the program which led to being honored in 2012 with naming rights to the stadium club at [[Houchens Industries\u2013L. T. Smith Stadium|L. T. Smith Stadium]]. This was 20 years after the 1992 \"Save the Program\" season and 10 years after the 2002 championship season.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/club-named-for-harbaugh/article_e11bf624-0397-11e2-9665-001a4bcf6878.html|title=Club named for Harbaugh|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\n====David Elson (2003\u20132009)====\nAfter serving on [[Jack Harbaugh|Harbaugh]]'s coaching staff seven seasons, [[David Elson]] was promoted to head coach where he led the Hilltoppers for seven seasons. Elson's first four seasons as head coach were at the [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA]] level (now FCS) where he picked up where Harbaugh left and posted four straight winning seasons, a record of 30\u201317, and two playoff berths. On Nov. 2nd, 2006, prior to the end of the season, WKU's Board of Regents voted in favor of moving from NCAA Division I-AA to [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|NCAA Division I-A]] football (now FBS) and would be joining the [[Sun Belt Conference]] in all sports by 2009. The move allowed WKU to add 22 scholarships by 2009 and increase the overall football budget by an estimated $2.5 million by the time the transition was complete.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wkusports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110206aaa.html|title=Board Of Regents Votes To Elevate Western Kentucky Football To Division I-A Status|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the Hilltoppers began the transition to NCAA Division I FBS as Independents, considered a reclassifying school for both the 2007 and 2008 seasons due to NCAA rules. The Hilltoppers were not eligible to participate in a Sun Belt Conference Championship or a berth in a bowl game until the 2009 season. Knowing it wasn't going to be easy, and without the motivation of being eligible to compete for a championship, Elson and the Hilltoppers set two team goals that season; to win seven games and to go undefeated at home. Both goals required at least one win over an FBS team. If the Hilltoppers won seven games, they got rings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=2647510|title=Moving up?

The 2008 season shed a truer light to the transition as the Hilltoppers went 2\u201310 with no wins over FBS opponents, only beating their two other long-time rivals and FCS-level opponents [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|EKU]] and [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]]. Things only got worse for the Hilltoppers in 2009 after they finally became full members of the Sun Belt Conference. WKU lost every game that season, going 0\u201312, posting their worst record in school history. Elson was hopeful to survive the transition as he asked for patience in building the program, but on Nov. 9th, 2009, prior to the end of the season, athletic director, Wood Selig had enough and fired Elson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=4637342|title=Western Kentucky fires coach amid 0-9 season|date=2009-11-09|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> The Hilltoppers went 39\u201344 under Elson, going 9\u201327 in his final three seasons (1\u201326 against FBS opponents).\n\n=== The FBS era (2010\u2013present) ===\n\n====Willie Taggart (2010\u20132012)====\nWKU Quarterback Legend, [[Willie Taggart]], returned to his alma mater as head football coach in 2010 after leaving his position as [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] running backs coach, where he served under [[Jack Harbaugh]]'s son [[Jim Harbaugh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/sunbelt/2009-11-23-western-kentucky-taggart_N.htm|title=Western Kentucky hires Stanford assistant Willie Taggart as coach \u2013 USATODAY.com|work=usatoday.com}}</ref> In their first year under Taggart, coming off a winless season under Elson, WKU finally broke their 26-game losing streak with a 54\u201321 win at [[Louisiana-Lafayette]]. The Hilltoppers finished 2\u201310 that season. From there, Taggart is credited with getting WKU's football program back on track after posting back to back 7\u20135 regular seasons that included an upset of [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]] in Lexington in 2012. That was Western Kentucky's first win over a [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] opponent in program history. Despite the surprising 7\u20135 record in 2011, a season in which the Hilltoppers went 7\u20131 in their final eight games, they were not invited to a bowl game. It wasn't until the following year, 2012, that the Hilltoppers were invited to their first FBS-level bowl game, the [[Little Caesars Pizza Bowl|Little Caesar's Bowl]].\n\nOn December 7, 2012, prior to their December 26th bowl game, Taggart left WKU to accept the head football coach position at [[South Florida Bulls football|South Florida]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gousfbulls.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=7700&ATCLID=205822229|title=Welcome Home Willie Taggart|work=GoUSFBulls.com}}</ref> [[Lance Guidry]], WKU's defensive coordinator was named interim head coach and led the Hilltoppers to their first bowl appearance as an FBS member.

Smith and World War I (1908\u20131921)====\nWestern Kentucky first fielded a football team in 1908 but did not start playing sanctioned games until the 1913 season. M.A. Leiper and Roy Manchester are the first noted coaches for WKU. The two men teamed up to coach the Hilltoppers for their inaugural season which solely consisted of a 20\u20130 win over Elizabethtown. J.L. Arthur then took over the program for three years from 1914 to 1916, coaching a total of 14 games, 6 of which were against [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|Eastern Kentucky]]. From 1917 to 1919 the Hilltoppers didn't compete in football from due to World War I. In 1920, L. T. Smith, whose name bears the Hilltoppers' home stadium, took the reins and coached the team for two seasons.\n\n====Edgar Diddle (1922\u20131928)====\nFrom 1922 to 1928, the Hilltoppers saw their first success as Coach [[Edgar Diddle|E.A. Diddle]] took over the football program for seven seasons leading them to four winning seasons while also coaching the [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|WKU Hilltoppers basketball team]]. Diddle, who was a dual-athlete himself, encouraged his players to participate in multiple sports so they could stay in shape. His [[1922 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|first team]] set a school record for wins that would stand for 41 years and his [[1928 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|last team]] claimed to be state champions.<ref name=\"Ruby\">{{cite book| last = Ruby| first = Earl| title = Red Towel Territory : A History of Athletics at Western Kentucky University| publisher = American National Bank and Trust Co.| year = 1979|}}</ref>  When he retired from coaching football in 1928, Diddle posted a record of 38\u201324\u20132. The Hilltoppers outscored opponents 171\u20137 in Diddle's final year of coaching the program.\n\n====Carl Anderson (1929\u20131937)====\nAfter Diddle left the football program to focus on coaching basketball, WKU football went through a series of instability in coaching but also a series of 9 winning seasons. In 1929, [[Carl Anderson (American football)|Carl \"Swede\" Anderson]] took over as head coach leading the Hilltoppers to a 7\u20133 record before leaving to take the head coach job over the [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State]] freshman football team. In [[1930 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1930]], James Elam led the Hilltoppers to a 16\u20135\u20131 record during his two seasons. Ernie Miller then took over in [[1932 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1932]] seasons going 7\u20131 during his lone season before Jesse Thomas took over for the 1933 season going 6\u20132. In 1934, Carl Anderson returned for a second stint with the Hilltoppers where he served as head coach through the [[1937 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1937]] season posting a 24\u20139\u20133 record with wins over EKU in all four seasons. The Hilltoppers were very successful in this era posting an outstanding a 60\u201320\u20134 record.\n\n====Gander Terry and World War II (1938\u20131947)====\nAfter Anderson left the hill once again, this time to be an assistant coach at [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]], the Hilltoppers selected \"[[Gander Terry]] to lead the program. In their four seasons under Terry, the Hilltoppers went 25\u20139\u20133 beating rivals [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|[Middle Tennessee]] and Eastern Kentucky in every game they played. Terry left the program after the 1941 season following a 4\u20135\u20131 record, the Hilltopper's first losing season since 1925. Arnold Winkenhofer took over in 1942 coaching the Toppers for one season before the program was stopped from 1943 to 1945 due to World War II. In 1946, Jesse Thomas returned to the Hill for his second stint as head coach. Thomas only stuck around WKU two more seasons with much less success than his first go around posting a 5\u201310\u20132 record.\n\n=== The Jimmy Feix era (1948\u20131988) ===\n\n====Jack Clayton (1948\u20131956)====\n[[Jack Clayton (American football)|Jack Clayton]] provided some much-needed stability to the WKU football program where he served as head coach for 9 seasons. In 1949, after losing the first two games to start the season, Clayton started a freshman quarterback by the name of [[Jimmy Feix]] winning 5 of the last 7 games that season. By [[1952 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1952]], with Feix now in his senior year, Clayton coached WKU to their first [[Ohio Valley Conference]] championship, tied the [[1922 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|school record]] for wins, and the school's first bowl appearance, winning 34\u201319 over [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] in the [[Refrigerator Bowl]], finishing the season 9\u20131. Feix became the first WKU football athlete ever to earn All-America honors after posting the highest pass completion percentage in the nation (.612). Under Clayton, the Hilltoppers posted a record of 50\u201333\u20132 before he left to coach at [[Northwestern State Demons football|Northwestern Louisiana State College]], his alma mater.\n\n====Nick Denes (1957\u20131967)====\n[[Nick Denes]], who was also a [[WKU Hilltoppers baseball]] head coach and for who, [[Nick Denes Field]] is named, coached WKU football for 11 seasons. In his time on the Hill, Denes compiled a 57\u201339\u20137 record for a .587 winning percentage. In 1963, Denes led the Hilltoppers to their second bowl game victory, defeating Coast Guard 27\u20130 in the [[Tangerine Bowl (1947\u20131982)|Tangerine Bowl]], a season where the Hilltoppers went 10\u20130\u20131. Denes retired after the 1967 season following a 42\u201319 win over [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]].\n\n====Jimmy Feix and NCAA Division I-AA transition (1968\u20131983)====\nAfter serving under Nick Denes as an assistant coach for all 11 seasons, [[Jimmy Feix]] was promoted to head coach. In his 16 seasons at the helm, Feix compiled an impressive 105\u201356\u20136 record (.6488). His 14 teams that competed in the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] went 67\u201328\u20132 (.701) in conference play. The Hilltoppers won six Ohio Valley Conference championships between 1970 and 1980. Feix became the most successful and longest-tenured coach in Western Kentucky football history while leading the Hilltoppers in a transition from [[NCAA Division II]] to [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|NCAA Division I-AA]] (now FCS).\n\nIn 1973, the Hilltoppers went undefeated in the regular season before competing in the first-year NCAA Division II championship playoffs. They made it to the championship game against [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football|Louisiana Tech]] coming up just short and finishing the season 12\u20131. In 1975, the Hilltoppers made the playoff field again advancing to the title game for the second time, but once again having to settle for runner-up honors finishing their season with an 11\u20132 record.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/26709537/wku-coaching-legend-jimmy-feix-dies|title=WKU coaching legend Jimmy Feix dies|last=Lewis|first=John|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nFeix was named OVC Coach of the Year in 1973, 1978 and 1980 and remains the winningest football coach in WKU history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alumni.wku.edu/s/808/index.aspx?pgid=1777&gid=1|title=WKU Alumni Association \u2013 Mr. Jimmy Feix|website=alumni.wku.edu|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Feix coached 16 athletes who followed him on the list of WKU football All-Americans.\n\n====Dave Roberts (1983\u20131988)====\nFeix retired as head coach moving to work in Alumni Affairs for two years before taking over as Director of Athletics in 1986. In his vacancy, the Hilltoppers hired former [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]] assistant [[Dave Roberts (American football)|Dave Roberts]] to be the head coach with hopes of continuing what Feix started. Roberts struggled through his first three seasons posting a record 10\u201322\u20131 before turning things around. In 1987 and 1988 Roberts took the Hilltoppers to the [[NCAA Division I-AA playoffs]] coming up short to rival EKU both years. After the 1988 season, Roberts left Western Kentucky for the [[Louisiana\u2013Monroe Warhawks football|Northeast Louisiana]] head coaching job. Though going 16\u20138 in his last two season, Roberts left with a 26\u201330\u20131 record becoming the first Hilltopper coach to leave with a losing record in over 60 years.\n\n=== The Jack Harbaugh era and FBS transition (1989\u20132009) ===\n\n==== Jack Harbaugh (1989\u20132002) ====\n[[Jack Harbaugh]] served as the Hilltoppers head football coach for 14 seasons, compiling a 91\u201368 record, three 10+ win seasons, two conference championships (OVC 2000, Gateway 2002) and the 2002 [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA National Championship]]. Harbaugh took the Hilltopper football program from the depths of despair in the early 1990s to its best stretch since the legendary [[Jimmy Feix]] coached on the Hill.\n\nIn 1992, WKU was on the verge of losing its football program after a state-mandated $6.1 million budget cut. Harbaugh was notified of the plans to shut down the program just before spring practice was about to begin. Having already made up his mind that he was not going to quit, he talked with his players left them a choice: accept defeat and leave, or fight to stay. Now known as the 1992 \"Save the Program\" team, every player decided to stay, fight, and work to save WKU football. While Harbaugh and the team did their part, former WKU quarterback, coach and athletics director at the time, Jimmy Feix, started an emergency fundraising campaign writing letters and making calls to former WKU players, urging them to buy season tickets. All the efforts paid off and on April 30, 1992, the WKU Board of Regents voted to allow football to stay but with a reduced budget.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/wku-program-savers-re-unite-on-saturday/article_cb65a9f8-0395-11e2-9bca-001a4bcf6878.html|title=WKU 'Program Savers' re-unite on Saturday|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> The Hilltoppers finished the 1992 season with a losing record of 4\u20136. As the budget remained tight over the next few years WKU managed an 8-3 record in 1993 before having back-to-back losing seasons.\n\nNo one ever doubted Harbaugh's ability to coach but he clearly needed better players. In 1994, with unwavering faith in their father, both of his sons, [[Jim Harbaugh]] and [[John Harbaugh]], decided to help however they could. While still playing in the NFL, Jim joined the WKU football coaching staff as an NCAA-certified unpaid assistant which allowed him to recruit. John, on the other hand, was a coach at [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]] and could rely on his scouting services, deep contacts, and endless high school game footage to help out.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl--harbaugh-sons-used-unconventional-means-to-help-father-build-college-football-powerhouse-053413373.html|title=Harbaugh sons used unconventional means to help father build college football powerhouse|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Jim set out and started contacting recruits, his first being [[Willie Taggart]], an All-American and four-year starter at quarterback for WKU. Jim also recruited future NFL players [[Rod Smart]] and [[Mel Mitchell]] to WKU as well as 17 players on the 2002 national championship team.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/49ers/article/How-Jim-Harbaugh-saved-dad-s-program-4230790.php|title=How Jim Harbaugh saved dad's program|newspaper=SFGate|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nThe Hilltoppers went 7-4 in 1996 behind the arm and legs of quarterback Willie Taggart which started a long series of winning seasons. Jack and his wife Jackie are credited with saving the program which led to being honored in 2012 with naming rights to the stadium club at [[Houchens Industries\u2013L. T. Smith Stadium|L. T. Smith Stadium]]. This was 20 years after the 1992 \"Save the Program\" season and 10 years after the 2002 championship season.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/club-named-for-harbaugh/article_e11bf624-0397-11e2-9665-001a4bcf6878.html|title=Club named for Harbaugh|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\n====David Elson (2003\u20132009)====\nAfter serving on [[Jack Harbaugh|Harbaugh]]'s coaching staff seven seasons, [[David Elson]] was promoted to head coach where he led the Hilltoppers for seven seasons. Elson's first four seasons as head coach were at the [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA]] level (now FCS) where he picked up where Harbaugh left and posted four straight winning seasons, a record of 30\u201317, and two playoff berths. On Nov. 2nd, 2006, prior to the end of the season, WKU's Board of Regents voted in favor of moving from NCAA Division I-AA to [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|NCAA Division I-A]] football (now FBS) and would be joining the [[Sun Belt Conference]] in all sports by 2009. The move allowed WKU to add 22 scholarships by 2009 and increase the overall football budget by an estimated $2.5 million by the time the transition was complete.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wkusports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110206aaa.html|title=Board Of Regents Votes To Elevate Western Kentucky Football To Division I-A Status|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the Hilltoppers began the transition to NCAA Division I FBS as Independents, considered a reclassifying school for both the 2007 and 2008 seasons due to NCAA rules. The Hilltoppers were not eligible to participate in a Sun Belt Conference Championship or a berth in a bowl game until the 2009 season. Knowing it wasn't going to be easy, and without the motivation of being eligible to compete for a championship, Elson and the Hilltoppers set two team goals that season; to win seven games and to go undefeated at home. Both goals required at least one win over an FBS team. If the Hilltoppers won seven games, they got rings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=2647510|title=Moving up? Western Kentucky approves upgrade to I-A|date=2006-11-03|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> They were able to accomplish the first of those goals, going 7\u20135 that season as they beat long-time rival [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|MTSU]] in Murfreesboro, but were unable to hold off [[Troy Trojans football|Troy]] at home; both of which were FBS schools and members of the Sun Belt Conference.\n\nThat win over MTSU in 2007 would be the last major win for the Hilltoppers under Elson. The 2008 season shed a truer light to the transition as the Hilltoppers went 2\u201310 with no wins over FBS opponents, only beating their two other long-time rivals and FCS-level opponents [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|EKU]] and [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]]. Things only got worse for the Hilltoppers in 2009 after they finally became full members of the Sun Belt Conference. WKU lost every game that season, going 0\u201312, posting their worst record in school history. Elson was hopeful to survive the transition as he asked for patience in building the program, but on Nov. 9th, 2009, prior to the end of the season, athletic director, Wood Selig had enough and fired Elson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=4637342|title=Western Kentucky fires coach amid 0-9 season|date=2009-11-09|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> The Hilltoppers went 39\u201344 under Elson, going 9\u201327 in his final three seasons (1\u201326 against FBS opponents).\n\n=== The FBS era (2010\u2013present) ===\n\n====Willie Taggart (2010\u20132012)====\nWKU Quarterback Legend, [[Willie Taggart]], returned to his alma mater as head football coach in 2010 after leaving his position as [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] running backs coach, where he served under [[Jack Harbaugh]]'s son [[Jim Harbaugh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/sunbelt/2009-11-23-western-kentucky-taggart_N.htm|title=Western Kentucky hires Stanford assistant Willie Taggart as coach \u2013 USATODAY.com|work=usatoday.com}}</ref> In their first year under Taggart, coming off a winless season under Elson, WKU finally broke their 26-game losing streak with a 54\u201321 win at [[Louisiana-Lafayette]]. The Hilltoppers finished 2\u201310 that season. From there, Taggart is credited with getting WKU's football program back on track after posting back to back 7\u20135 regular seasons that included an upset of [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]] in Lexington in 2012. That was Western Kentucky's first win over a [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] opponent in program history. Despite the surprising 7\u20135 record in 2011, a season in which the Hilltoppers went 7\u20131 in their final eight games, they were not invited to a bowl game. It wasn't until the following year, 2012, that the Hilltoppers were invited to their first FBS-level bowl game, the [[Little Caesars Pizza Bowl|Little Caesar's Bowl]].\n\nOn December 7, 2012, prior to their December 26th bowl game, Taggart left WKU to accept the head football coach position at [[South Florida Bulls football|South Florida]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gousfbulls.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=7700&ATCLID=205822229|title=Welcome Home Willie Taggart|work=GoUSFBulls.com}}</ref> [[Lance Guidry]], WKU's defensive coordinator was named interim head coach and led the Hilltoppers to their first bowl appearance as an FBS member.

Any citizen of 21 years is eligible for election (art. 92). The functions of the House are to consider draft laws and the other business of government; it must approve the nomination of a prime minister (art. 97); and it may deliver a [[vote of no confidence]] on the government (art. 97).\n\nThe [[upper house]] is the [[Council of the Republic of Belarus|Council of the Republic]].\n\n==Powers==\nBills adopted by the House of Representatives are sent to the Council of the Republic for consideration within five days, where they are considered within no more than twenty days.\n\nSpecial powers accorded only to the House of Representatives are:\n*consider draft laws put forward by the President or submitted by no less than 150 thousand eligible voters, to make amendments and alterations in the Constitution and give its interpretation;\n*consider draft laws, including the guidelines of the domestic and foreign policy of the Republic of Belarus; the military doctrine; ratification and denunciation of international treaties;\n*call elections for the Presidency;\n*grant consent to the President concerning the appointment of the Prime minister;\n*consider the report of the Prime minister on the policy of the Government and approve or reject it; a second rejection by the House of the policy of the Government is an expression of non-confidence to the Government.\n\nIn practice, the House of Representatives has little real power.

A person may inhale the material, or it may be delivered into the [[tracheobronchial tree]] during [[positive pressure ventilation]]. When pulmonary aspiration occurs during eating and drinking, the aspirated material is often colloquially referred to as \"going down the wrong pipe.\"\n\nConsequences of pulmonary aspiration range from no injury at all, to [[chemical pneumonitis]] or [[pneumonia]], to death within minutes from asphyxiation. These consequences depend on the volume, chemical composition, particle size, and presence of infectious agents in the aspirated material, and on the underlying health status of the person. In healthy people, aspiration of small quantities of material is common and rarely results in disease or injury. People with significant underlying disease or injury are at greater risk for developing respiratory complications following pulmonary aspiration, especially hospitalized patients, because of certain factors such as depressed level of consciousness and impaired airway defenses ([[Pharyngeal reflex|gag reflex]] and [[respiratory tract antimicrobial defense system]]). The [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the [[right main bronchus]] is more vertical and slightly wider than that of the [[Left main bronchus|left]], so aspirated material is more likely to end up in this bronchus or one of its subsequent bifurcations.\n\nAbout 3.6 million cases of pulmonary aspiration or foreign body in the airway occurred in 2013.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(15)60692-4 |pmid=26063472 |pmc=4561509 |title=Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 301 acute and chronic diseases and injuries in 188 countries, 1990\u20132013: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 |journal=The Lancet |volume=386 |issue=9995 |pages=743\u2013800 |year=2015 |last1=Vos |first1=Theo |last2=Barber |first2=Ryan M |last3=Bell |first3=Brad |last4=Bertozzi-Villa |first4=Amelia |last5=Biryukov |first5=Stan |last6=Bolliger |first6=Ian |last7=Charlson |first7=Fiona |last8=Davis |first8=Adrian |last9=Degenhardt |first9=Louisa |last10=Dicker |first10=Daniel |last11=Duan |first11=Leilei |last12=Erskine |first12=Holly |last13=Feigin |first13=Valery L |last14=Ferrari |first14=Alize J |last15=Fitzmaurice |first15=Christina |last16=Fleming |first16=Thomas |last17=Graetz |first17=Nicholas |last18=Guinovart |first18=Caterina |last19=Haagsma |first19=Juanita |last20=Hansen |first20=Gillian M |last21=Hanson |first21=Sarah Wulf |last22=Heuton |first22=Kyle R |last23=Higashi |first23=Hideki |last24=Kassebaum |first24=Nicholas |last25=Kyu |first25=Hmwe |last26=Laurie |first26=Evan |last27=Liang |first27=Xiofeng |last28=Lofgren |first28=Katherine |last29=Lozano |first29=Rafael |last30=MacIntyre |first30=Michael F |display-authors=29 }}</ref>\n\n==Presentation==\n=== Consequences ===\n[[File:Aspiration pneumonia201711-3264.jpg|thumb|Aspiration pneumonia]]\n==== Particle-related ====\nPulmonary aspiration of particulate matter may result in acute airway obstruction which may rapidly lead to death from arterial [[hypoxemia]].<ref name=Engelhart1999>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/bja/83.3.453 |pmid=10655918 |title=Pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents in anaesthesia |journal=British Journal of Anaesthesia |volume=83 |issue=3 |pages=453\u201360 |year=1999 |last1=Engelhardt |first1=T. |last2=Webster |first2=N.

Significant aspiration can only occur if the protective reflexes are absent or severely diminished (in neurological disease, [[coma]], [[drug overdose]], [[sedation]] or [[general anesthesia]]). In [[intensive care]], sitting patients up reduces the risk of pulmonary aspiration and [[ventilator]]-associated [[pneumonia]].\n\nMeasures to prevent aspiration depend on the situation and the patient. In patients at imminent risk of aspiration, [[tracheal intubation]] by a trained [[health professional]] provides the best protection. A simpler intervention that can be implemented is to lay the patient on their side in the [[recovery position]] (as taught in [[first aid]] and [[CPR]] classes), so that any [[vomitus]] produced by the patient will drain out their mouth instead of back down their [[pharynx]]. Some anesthetists will use [[sodium citrate]] to neutralize the stomach's low pH and [[metoclopramide]] or [[domperidone]] (pro-kinetic agents) to empty the stomach.\n\nPeople with chronic [[neurological disorder]]s, for example, after a stroke, are less likely to aspirate [[thickened fluids]] on an instrumental swallowing assessment.  However, this does not necessarily translate into reduced risk of pneumonia in real life eating and drinking.<ref>O'Keeffe ST. (July 2018).

If one is sitting or standing up, the aspirate ends up in the posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe. If one is on one's back, it goes to the superior segment of the right lower lobe.

A person may inhale the material, or it may be delivered into the [[tracheobronchial tree]] during [[positive pressure ventilation]]. When pulmonary aspiration occurs during eating and drinking, the aspirated material is often colloquially referred to as \"going down the wrong pipe.\"\n\nConsequences of pulmonary aspiration range from no injury at all to [[chemical pneumonitis]] or [[pneumonia]] to death within minutes from asphyxiation. These consequences depend on the volume, chemical composition, particle size, and presence of infectious agents in the aspirated material, and on the underlying health status of the person. In healthy people, aspiration of small quantities of material is common and rarely results in disease or injury. People with significant underlying disease or injury are at greater risk for developing respiratory complications following pulmonary aspiration, especially hospitalized patients, because of certain factors such as depressed level of consciousness and impaired airway defenses ([[Pharyngeal reflex|gag reflex]] and [[respiratory tract antimicrobial defense system]]). The [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the [[right main bronchus]] is more vertical and slightly wider than that of the [[Left main bronchus|left]], so aspirated material is more likely to end up in this bronchus or one of its subsequent bifurcations.\n\nAbout 3.6 million cases of pulmonary aspiration or foreign body in the airway occurred in 2013.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(15)60692-4 |pmid=26063472 |pmc=4561509 |title=Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 301 acute and chronic diseases and injuries in 188 countries, 1990\u20132013: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 |journal=The Lancet |volume=386 |issue=9995 |pages=743\u2013800 |year=2015 |last1=Vos |first1=Theo |last2=Barber |first2=Ryan M |last3=Bell |first3=Brad |last4=Bertozzi-Villa |first4=Amelia |last5=Biryukov |first5=Stan |last6=Bolliger |first6=Ian |last7=Charlson |first7=Fiona |last8=Davis |first8=Adrian |last9=Degenhardt |first9=Louisa |last10=Dicker |first10=Daniel |last11=Duan |first11=Leilei |last12=Erskine |first12=Holly |last13=Feigin |first13=Valery L |last14=Ferrari |first14=Alize J |last15=Fitzmaurice |first15=Christina |last16=Fleming |first16=Thomas |last17=Graetz |first17=Nicholas |last18=Guinovart |first18=Caterina |last19=Haagsma |first19=Juanita |last20=Hansen |first20=Gillian M |last21=Hanson |first21=Sarah Wulf |last22=Heuton |first22=Kyle R |last23=Higashi |first23=Hideki |last24=Kassebaum |first24=Nicholas |last25=Kyu |first25=Hmwe |last26=Laurie |first26=Evan |last27=Liang |first27=Xiofeng |last28=Lofgren |first28=Katherine |last29=Lozano |first29=Rafael |last30=MacIntyre |first30=Michael F |display-authors=29 }}</ref>\n\n==Presentation==\n=== Consequences ===\n[[File:Aspiration pneumonia201711-3264.jpg|thumb|Aspiration pneumonia]]\n==== Particle-related ====\nPulmonary aspiration of particulate matter may result in acute airway obstruction which may rapidly lead to death from arterial [[hypoxemia]].<ref name=Engelhart1999>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/bja/83.3.453 |pmid=10655918 |title=Pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents in anaesthesia |journal=British Journal of Anaesthesia |volume=83 |issue=3 |pages=453\u201360 |year=1999 |last1=Engelhardt |first1=T. |last2=Webster |first2=N.

Significant aspiration can only occur if the protective reflexes are absent or severely diminished (in neurological disease, [[coma]], [[drug overdose]], [[sedation]] or [[general anesthesia]]). In [[intensive care]], sitting patients up reduces the risk of pulmonary aspiration and [[ventilator]]-associated [[pneumonia]].\n\nMeasures to prevent aspiration depend on the situation and the patient. In patients at imminent risk of aspiration, [[tracheal intubation]] by a trained [[health professional]] provides the best protection. A simpler intervention that can be implemented is to lay the patient on their side in the [[recovery position]] (as taught in [[first aid]] and [[CPR]] classes), so that any [[vomitus]] produced by the patient will drain out their mouth instead of back down their [[pharynx]]. Some anesthetists will use [[sodium citrate]] to neutralize the stomach's low pH and [[metoclopramide]] or [[domperidone]] (pro-kinetic agents) to empty the stomach.\n\nPeople with chronic [[neurological disorder]]s, for example, after a stroke, are less likely to aspirate [[thickened fluids]] on an instrumental swallowing assessment.  However, this does not necessarily translate into reduced risk of pneumonia in real life eating and drinking.<ref>O'Keeffe ST. (July 2018).

If one is sitting or standing up, the aspirate ends up in the posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe. If one is on one's back, it goes to the superior segment of the right lower lobe. If one is lying on the right side, it goes to the posterior segment of the right upper lobe, or the posterior basal segment of the right upper lobe.
