[[Martial law]] is declared either when there is near-violent civil unrest or in cases of major natural disasters, however most countries use a different legal construct like \"[[state of emergency]]\".\n\nTypically, the imposition of martial law accompanies [[curfew]]s, the suspension of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], [[civil rights]], [[habeas corpus]], and the application or extension of [[military law]] or [[military justice]] to civilians. Civilians defying martial law may be subjected to [[military tribunal]]s ([[court-martial]]).\n\n== Summary ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Enacted By\n!Date commenced\n!Date lifted\n!Territorial Extent\n!Legal Basis\n|-\n| nowrap=\"nowrap\" |<center>[[File:Ram\u00f3n_Blanco.png|70px]]<br />[[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor General]] [[Ram\u00f3n Blanco, 1st Marquess of Pe\u00f1a Plata|Ramon Blanco]]</center>\n| [[Philippine Revolution|August 30, 1896]]\n| [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|December 10, 1898]]\n| Provinces of [[Manila (province)|Manila]], [[Bulacan]], [[Cavite]], [[Pampanga]], [[Tarlac]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], [[Batangas]], and [[Nueva Ecija]]\n| Official Proclamation stating that\n{{quotation| ''The civilian government and civilian judicial authorities shall continue functioning in all matters appropriately belonging to their attributes that do not refer to public order and this last matter to whatever the military allows them to do or delegates to them, requiring each one to give the other any news that will reach their knowledge''}}\n|-\n|nowrap=\"nowrap\" |<center>[[File:Gen_Aguinaldo.jpg|70px]]<br />[[List of unofficial Presidents of the Philippines|President]] [[Emilio Aguinaldo]]</center>\n| May 24, 1898\n| June 23, 1898\n| [[Philippines|nationwide]]\n| Revolutionary Decree instituting a [[Dictatorial Government of the Philippines|Dictatorial Government]] under a Dictatorial leadership \n{{quotation|''I am compelled to establish a Dictatorial Government with full authority, civil and military, in order to determine first the real needs of the country''}}\n|-\n|nowrap=\"nowrap\" |<center>[[File:Jose P.

The song was originally a contender for inclusion on Richards' first solo album, ''[[Talk Is Cheap]]'', but he decided to play it for Jagger and Chris Kimsey the next year during recording sessions in [[Montserrat]] for the ''Steel Wheels'' album. With the exception of some lyrical alteration by Jagger, the composition was left in its original form. The single, which was released in January 1990 and was the third single released from ''Steel Wheels'', the single reached No. 50 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] (US), reaching the slightly higher position of 31 in the UK, and placed No. 1 on the US [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart for one week.

The Smith family hired Boston-based landscape artist [[Robert Morris Copeland]] to prepare the grounds along Catfish Creek before it was occupied by William Wrenshaw Smith and his wife Emma Willard McKennan Smith. Wrenshaw Smith was a cousin to [[Julia Dent]], wife of President [[Ulysses S. Grant]].

At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the Special Education Department.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trinitypride.k12.pa.us/departments.cfm?subpage=42487 |title=Trinity Area School District Special Education Department - Annual Public Notice of Special Education Services |author=Trinity Area School District Administration  |year=2010\u20132011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services.

The Board has applied to raise taxes beyond the Act 1 limit due to special education costs.\n\nThe district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the Special Education Department.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trinitypride.k12.pa.us/departments.cfm?subpage=42487 |title=Trinity Area School District Special Education Department - Annual Public Notice of Special Education Services |author=Trinity Area School District Administration  |year=2010\u20132011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services.

This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding.<ref>Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania Special Education Funding, 2010</ref> The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services.
