He was the son and successor of [[Ordo\u00f1o I of Asturias|Ordo\u00f1o I]]. In later sources he is the earliest to be called \"[[Emperor of Spain]].\" He was also titled \"Prince of all Galicia\" (''Princeps totius Galletiae''<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=cQEyW9sdLZkC&pg=PA392&dq=Princeps+totius+Galletiae&hl=en&ei=jLLeTImKKMnJswa809CPDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Princeps%20totius%20Galletiae&f=false Espa\u00f1a Sagrada. Memorias de los insignes monasterios de San Juli\u00e1n de Samos, y San Vicente de Monforte.]</ref>).\n\n==Life==\nAlfonso's reign was notable for his comparative success in consolidating the kingdom during the weakness of the [[Umayyad]] princes of [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]]. He fought against and gained numerous victories over the [[Moors|Muslims of al-Andalus]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Alphonso|display=Alphonso s.v. Alphonso III.|volume=1|page=734}}</ref>\n\nDuring the first year of his reign, he had to contend with a usurper, Count [[Froila (usurper)|Fruela of Galicia]]. He was forced flee to [[County of Castile|Castile]], but after a few months Fruela was assassinated and Alfonso returned to [[Oviedo]].\n\nHe defeated a [[Basque people|Basque]] rebellion in 867 and, much later, a Galician one as well. He conquered [[Oporto]] and [[Coimbra]] in 868 and 878 respectively. In about 869, he formed an alliance with the [[Kingdom of Pamplona]], and solidified this link by marrying Jimena, who is thought to have been daughter of king [[Garc\u00eda \u00cd\u00f1iguez of Pamplona|Garc\u00eda \u00cd\u00f1iguez]], or less likely, a member of the [[Jim\u00e9nez dynasty]], and also married his sister [[Leodegundia]] to a prince of Pamplona.\n\n===In the Reconquista===\nThe following year, 867, Alfonso had to attend to an uprising in the eastern part of the kingdom, in Alava, according to the Chronicle of Albeda. According to the Chronicle of Sampiro, the revolt was led by Count Eylo. Sampiro describes these events as follows:\n\n{{cita| A messenger arrived from \u00c1lava, announcing that their hearts had inflated against the king: hearing that, the monarch decided to march there.  Driven by the fear of their arrival, they quickly recognized their obligations and supplicants, lowered their heads before him and promised that they would remain faithful to his kingdom and authority, and that they would do what was commanded.  In this way he submitted to his power an Alava lying before him, and Eylo, who presented himself as his count, brought him to Oviedo loaded with iron. {{Harvp|Mart\u00ednez D\u00edez|2005|p=220}}}}\n\nHis father, Ordo\u00f1o, had begun the repopulation of the border territories and Alfonso continued with it.  His first successes were in Portuguese lands, where King Alfonso's troops succeeded in locating the southwestern frontier on the Mondego river.  Count [[Vimara Peres|Vimara Perez]] in 868 conquered Oporto and repopulated the district. In 878, the army of King Alfonso III, with Count Hermenegildo Guti\u00e9rrez in command, faced the Muslim forces led by the emir of Cordoba, Mohammad I, who had started an attack against Oporto. After defeating the emir's forces and expelling the Muslim inhabitants of Coimbra and Oporto, Guti\u00e9rrez' Christian troops occupied and repopulated other cities, such as Braga, Viseo and Lamego, with men taken from Galicia. Coimbra, Lamego and Viseo were conquered again in 987 by Almanzor and it was not until 1064 when they were finally reconquered by King Ferdinand I of Le\u00f3n.\n\nAlfonso III had to face the offensive of the Umayyad prince al-Mundir, son of Mohamed I. Fighting occurred almost constantly between 875 and 883. The first Umayyad raids were aimed at Le\u00f3n and El Bierzo, but failed.  The Christian counteroffensive ended with the taking of Deza and Atienza.\n\nAbd al-Rahman ibn Marwan, the Galician, Lord of M\u00e9rida and rebel against the Emir of C\u00f3rdoba, sent him to ingratiate himself with him to the Minister of this, Hashim ibn Abd al-Aziz.{{clarify|date=March 2020}} Accordingly, in 878, Al-Mundir  directed his armies back to Leon and Astorga, while Salid ben Ganim reached the \u00d3rbigo.  Alfonso, hoping to prevent the union of both armies, went out to meet the second, which he defeated in the battle of Polvoraria, at the confluence of the \u00d3rbigo and Esla rivers.  Al-Mundir then withdrew, but Alfonso III intercepted him in the valley of Valdemora, where he defeated him.  Mohamed was forced to pay ransom and sign a three-year truce, the first time that C\u00f3rdoba had asked for peace.\n\nBoth kings considered the truce as a pause while preparing for the next assault: Mohamed raised a fleet to attack Galicia, but it was destroyed by a storm. Alfonso and Ibn Marwan descended through the Tagus Valley and defeated the Cordovan army on Mount Oxifer, next to the Guadiana River.\n\nAs revenge, Mohamed attacked the kingdom of Zaragoza in 882, where Alfonso had sent his son Ordo\u00f1o to be educated with the Banu Qasi, sons of Musa, advancing through the ancient Roman road to Leon.  There was an exchange of prisoners and the Cordovans withdrew.  They repeated the campaign in 883 with the same result.  In 884 Mohamed I and Alfonso III signed a peace, since both began to have serious internal problems.  The great king was met with a rising led by his brothers Fruela, Odoario and Bermudo, who became strong in Astorga, supported by several counts, but were quickly defeated and executed.  In 901 the Umayyad rebel Ibn al-Qitt proclaimed Mahdi, preached holy war and attacked Zamora - \"rebuilt and repopulated by Mozarabic Toledo [...] the most important advanced square of the Asturian kingdom\" - which he was able to resist.  The messianic leader, abandoned by his own, was defeated and killed in battle on what is known as the Day of Zamora. In those years, the emirate of Cordoba, wracked by civil disorder, stopped disturbing the kingdom of Asturias. Alonso faced off against his former allies in M\u00e9rida and the Ebro valley: allied with the Count of Pallars, he instigated a coup that managed to defeat the Banu Qasi and install a Navarrese, Sancho Garc\u00e9s I, on the throne of Pamplona.\n\nHe ordered the creation of three chronicles which presented the theory that the kingdom of Asturias was the rightful successor of the old [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] kingdom.

Alfonso had Garc\u00eda imprisoned but they were able to eject him and he fled to Boiges.  However, he returned and convinced Garc\u00eda to join him in a campaign against the Moors.  Alfonso died in Zamora of natural causes in 910, having reigned for 44 years.  [[Ibn Hayyan]] likewise tells of an uprising, but says that Alfonso himself had been imprisoned.  Following his death there was a partition of his realm: his eldest son, Garc\u00eda, became king of Le\u00f3n.

He was the son and successor of [[Ordo\u00f1o I of Asturias|Ordo\u00f1o I]].

He fought against and gained numerous victories over the [[Moors|Muslims of al-Andalus]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Alphonso|display=Alphonso s.v. Alphonso III.|volume=1|page=734}}</ref>\n\nDuring the first year of his reign, he had to contend with a usurper, Count [[Froila (usurper)|Fruela of Galicia]]. He was forced flee to [[County of Castile|Castile]], but after a few months Fruela was assassinated and Alfonso returned to [[Oviedo]].\n\nHe defeated a [[Basque people|Basque]] rebellion in 867 and, much later, a Galician one as well. He conquered [[Oporto]] and [[Coimbra]] in 868 and 878 respectively. In about 869, he formed an alliance with the [[Kingdom of Pamplona]], and solidified this link by marrying Jimena, who is thought to have been daughter of king [[Garc\u00eda \u00cd\u00f1iguez of Pamplona|Garc\u00eda \u00cd\u00f1iguez]], or less likely, a member of the [[Jim\u00e9nez dynasty]], and also married his sister [[Leodegundia]] to a prince of Pamplona.\n\n===In the Reconquista===\nThe following year, 867, Alfonso had to attend to an uprising in the eastern part of the kingdom, in Alava, according to the Chronicle of Albeda. According to the Chronicle of Sampiro, the revolt was led by Count Eylo. Sampiro describes these events as follows:\n\n{{cita| A messenger arrived from \u00c1lava, announcing that their hearts had inflated against the king: hearing that, the monarch decided to march there.  Driven by the fear of their arrival, they quickly recognized their obligations and supplicants, lowered their heads before him and promised that they would remain faithful to his kingdom and authority, and that they would do what was commanded.  In this way he submitted to his power an Alava lying before him, and Eylo, who presented himself as his count, brought him to Oviedo loaded with iron. {{Harvp|Mart\u00ednez D\u00edez|2005|p=220}}}}\n\nHis father, Ordo\u00f1o, had begun the repopulation of the border territories and Alfonso continued with it.  His first successes were in Portuguese lands, where King Alfonso's troops succeeded in locating the southwestern frontier on the Mondego river.  Count [[Vimara Peres|Vimara Perez]] in 868 conquered Oporto and repopulated the district. In 878, the army of King Alfonso III, with Count Hermenegildo Guti\u00e9rrez in command, faced the Muslim forces led by the emir of Cordoba, Mohammad I, who had started an attack against Oporto. After defeating the emir's forces and expelling the Muslim inhabitants of Coimbra and Oporto, Guti\u00e9rrez' Christian troops occupied and repopulated other cities, such as Braga, Viseo and Lamego, with men taken from Galicia. Coimbra, Lamego and Viseo were conquered again in 987 by Almanzor and it was not until 1064 when they were finally reconquered by King Ferdinand I of Le\u00f3n.\n\nAlfonso III had to face the offensive of the Umayyad prince al-Mundir, son of Mohamed I. Fighting occurred almost constantly between 875 and 883. The first Umayyad raids were aimed at Le\u00f3n and El Bierzo, but failed.  The Christian counteroffensive ended with the taking of Deza and Atienza.\n\nAbd al-Rahman ibn Marwan, the Galician, Lord of M\u00e9rida and rebel against the Emir of C\u00f3rdoba, sent him to ingratiate himself with him to the Minister of this, Hashim ibn Abd al-Aziz.{{clarify|date=March 2020}} Accordingly, in 878, Al-Mundir  directed his armies back to Leon and Astorga, while Salid ben Ganim reached the \u00d3rbigo.  Alfonso, hoping to prevent the union of both armies, went out to meet the second, which he defeated in the battle of Polvoraria, at the confluence of the \u00d3rbigo and Esla rivers.  Al-Mundir then undertook the withdrawal, but Alfonso III intercepted him in the valley of Valdemora, where he defeated him.  Emir Mohamed was forced to pay ransom and sign a three-year truce.  It was the first time that C\u00f3rdoba asked for peace.\n\nBoth kings considered the truce as a pause while preparing for the next assault: Mohamed raised a fleet to attack Galicia, but it was destroyed by a storm. Alfonso and Ibn Marwan descended through the Tagus Valley and defeated the Cordovan army on Mount Oxifer, next to the Guadiana River.\n\nAs revenge, Mohamed attacked the kingdom of Zaragoza in 882, where Alfonso had sent his son Ordo\u00f1o to be educated with the Banu Qasi, sons of Musa, advancing through the ancient Roman road to Leon.  There was an exchange of prisoners and the Cordovans withdrew.  They repeated the campaign in 883 with the same result.  In 884 Mohamed I and Alfonso III signed a peace, since both began to have serious internal problems.  The great king was met with a rising led by his brothers Fruela, Odoario and Bermudo, who became strong in Astorga, supported by several counts, but were quickly defeated and executed.

{"title_page": "Sense (molecular biology)", "text_new": "{{short description|Property of nucleic acid strands with respect to their translatability into protein}}\nIn [[molecular biology]] and [[genetics]], the '''sense''' of a [[nucleic acid]] molecule, particularly of a strand of [[DNA]] or [[RNA]], refers to the nature of the roles of the strand and its [[complementarity (molecular biology)|complement]] in specifying a sequence of [[amino acid]]s. Depending on the context, sense may have slightly different meanings. For example, DNA is positive-sense if an RNA version of the same sequence is translated or translatable into protein, negative-sense if not.\n\n==DNA sense==\nBecause of the [[complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] nature of [[base-pairing]] between nucleic acid polymers, a double-stranded DNA molecule will be composed of two strands with sequences that are complements of each other. To help molecular biologists specifically identify each strand individually, the two strands are usually differentiated as the \"sense\" strand and the \"antisense\" strand. An individual strand of DNA is referred to as '''positive-sense''' (also '''positive (+)''' or simply '''sense''') if its [[nucleic acid sequence|nucleotide sequence]] corresponds directly to the sequence of an RNA [[transcription (biology)|transcript]] which is [[translation (biology)|translated]] or translatable into a sequence of [[amino acid]]s (provided that any [[thymine]] bases in the DNA sequence are replaced with [[uracil]] bases in the RNA sequence). The other strand of the double-stranded DNA molecule is referred to as '''negative-sense''' (also '''negative (-)''' or '''antisense'''), and is complementary to both the positive-sense strand and the RNA transcript. It is actually the antisense strand that is used as the template from which [[RNA polymerase]]s construct the RNA transcript, but the complementary base-pairing by which nucleic acid polymerization occurs means that the sequence of the RNA transcript will ultimately look more similar to the sequence of the sense strand than that of the antisense template (again, the only exception being the RNA transcript's use of uracil instead of thymine).\n\nSometimes the phrases '''coding strand''' and '''template strand''' are encountered in place of sense and antisense, respectively, and in the context of a double-stranded DNA molecule the usage of these terms is essentially equivalent. However, the coding/sense strand need not always contain a code that is used to make a protein; both protein-coding and [[non-coding RNA]]s may be transcribed.\n\nThe terms \"sense\" and \"antisense\" are relative only to the particular RNA transcript in question, and not to the DNA strand as a whole. In other words, either DNA strand can serve as the sense or antisense strand. Most organisms with sufficiently large genomes make use of both strands, with each strand functioning as the template strand for different RNA transcripts in different places along the same DNA molecule. In some cases, RNA transcripts can be transcribed in both directions (i.e. on either strand) from a common [[promoter (biology)|promoter]] region, or be transcribed from within [[introns]] on either strand (see \"ambisense\" below).<ref>{{cite journal |title=Expression strategies of ambisense viruses |author= Anne-Lise Haenni |journal=Virus Research |volume=93 |issue=2 |year=2003 |pages=141\u2013150 |doi=10.1016/S0168-1702(03)00094-7 |pmid=12782362}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |journal=J Gen Virol |year=1991 |volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=465\u20138 |title=Ambisense segment 3 of rice stripe virus: the first instance of a virus containing two ambisense segments |author1=Kakutani T |author2=Hayano Y |author3=Hayashi T |author4=Minobe Y. |pmid=1993885 |doi=10.1099/0022-1317-72-2-465}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |journal=J Gen Virol |year=1991 |volume=72 |issue=4 |pages=763\u20137 |title=Complete nucleotide sequence of RNA 3 of rice stripe virus: an ambisense coding strategy |author1=Zhu Y |author2=Hayakawa T |author3=Toriyama S |author4=Takahashi M. |pmid=2016591 |doi=10.1099/0022-1317-72-4-763}}</ref>\n\n===Antisense DNA===\nThe DNA sense strand looks like the [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA) transcript, and can therefore be used to read the expected [[codon]] sequence that will ultimately be used during [[translation (biology)|translation]] (protein synthesis) to build an amino acid sequence and then a protein. For example, the sequence \"ATG\" within a DNA sense strand corresponds to an \"AUG\" codon in the mRNA, which [[genetic code|codes]] for the amino acid [[methionine]]. However, the DNA sense strand itself is not used as the template for the mRNA; it is the DNA antisense strand which serves as the source for the protein code, because, with bases complementary to the DNA sense strand, it is used as a template for the mRNA. Since [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] results in an RNA product complementary to the DNA template strand, the mRNA is complementary to the DNA antisense strand.[[Image:Antisense DNA oligonucleotide.png|Schematic showing how antisense DNA strands can interfere with protein translation|thumb|250px|right]]\n\nHence, a base triplet 3'-TAC-5' in the DNA antisense strand (complementary to the 5'-ATG-3' of the DNA sense strand) is used as the template which results in a 5'-AUG-3' base triplet in the mRNA. The DNA sense strand will have the triplet ATG, which looks similar to the mRNA triplet AUG but will not be used to make methionine because it will not be directly used to make mRNA. The DNA sense strand is called a \"sense\" strand not because it will be used to make protein (it won't be), but because it has a sequence that corresponds directly to the RNA codon sequence. By this logic, the RNA transcript itself is sometimes described as \"sense\".\n\n===Example with double-stranded DNA===\n:''DNA strand 1: antisense strand'' (transcribed to) \u2192 ''RNA strand (sense)''\n\n:''DNA strand 2: sense strand''\n\nSome regions within a double-stranded DNA molecule code for [[gene]]s, which are usually instructions specifying the order in which amino acids are assembled to make proteins, as well as regulatory sequences, [[RNA splicing|splicing]] sites, non-coding [[intron]]s, and other [[gene product]]s. For a cell to use this information, one strand of the DNA serves as a template for the synthesis of a complementary strand of [[RNA]]. The transcribed DNA strand is called the template strand, with antisense sequence, and the mRNA transcript produced from it is said to be sense sequence (the complement of antisense). The untranscribed DNA strand, complementary to the transcribed strand, is also said to have sense sequence; it has the same sense sequence as the mRNA transcript (though T bases in DNA are substituted with U bases in RNA).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"3\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n| <span style=\"color: blue;\">'''<tt>3'CGCTATAGCGTTT&nbsp;5'</tt>'''</span> || <span style=\"color: blue;\">DNA antisense strand</span> (template/noncoding) || Used as a template for transcription.\n|-\n| <span style=\"color: red;\">'''<tt>5'GCGATATCGCAAA&nbsp;3'</tt>'''</span> || <span style=\"color: red;\">DNA sense strand</span> (nontemplate/coding)|| Complementary to the template strand.\n|-\n| <span style=\"color: blue;\"><tt>5'GCGAUAUCGCAAA&nbsp;3'</tt></span> || mRNA sense transcript || RNA strand that is transcribed from the noncoding (template/antisense) strand.

The only biological information that is important for labeling strands is the relative locations of the terminal 5' phosphate group and the terminal 3' hydroxyl group (at the ends of the strand or sequence in question), because these ends determine the direction of transcription and translation.

Therefore, in positive-sense RNA viruses, the viral RNA genome can be considered viral mRNA, and can be immediately translated by the host cell. Unlike negative-sense RNA, positive-sense RNA is of the same sense as mRNA. Some viruses (e.g. [[Coronaviridae]]) have positive-sense genomes that can act as mRNA and be used directly to synthesize proteins without the help of a complementary RNA intermediate. Because of this, these viruses do not need to have an [[RNA polymerase]] packaged into the [[virion]]\u2014the RNA polymerase will be one of the first proteins produced by the host cell, since it is needed in order for the virus's genome to be replicated.\n\n===Negative-sense===\n{{main|Negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus}}\nNegative-sense (3\u2032-to-5\u2032) viral RNA is complementary to the viral mRNA, thus a positive-sense RNA must be produced by an [[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase]] from it prior to translation. Like DNA, negative-sense RNA has a nucleotide sequence complementary to the mRNA that it encodes; also like DNA, this RNA cannot be translated into protein directly. Instead, it must first be transcribed into a positive-sense RNA that acts as an mRNA. Some viruses (e.g. [[influenza]] viruses) have negative-sense genomes and so must carry an RNA polymerase inside the virion.\n\n==Antisense oligonucleotides==\n[[Gene silencing]] can be achieved by introducing into cells a short \"antisense oligonucleotide\" that is complementary to an RNA target.

This makes the mechanism of gene silencing catalytic. Double-stranded RNA can also act as a catalytic, enzyme-dependent antisense agent through the [[RNAi]]/[[siRNA]] pathway, involving target mRNA recognition through sense-antisense strand pairing followed by target mRNA degradation by the [[RNA-induced silencing complex]] (RISC). The R1 plasmid [[hok/sok system]] provides yet another example of an enzyme-dependent antisense regulation process through enzymatic degradation of the resulting RNA duplex.\n\nOther antisense mechanisms are not enzyme-dependent, but involve steric blocking of their target RNA (e.g. to prevent translation or to induce alternative splicing). Steric blocking antisense mechanisms often use oligonucleotides that are heavily modified. Since there is no need for RNase H recognition, this can include chemistries such as 2'-O-alkyl, [[peptide nucleic acid]] (PNA), [[locked nucleic acid]] (LNA), and [[Morpholino]] oligomers.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Antisense therapy]]\n*[[Directionality (molecular biology)]]\n*[[DNA codon table]]\n*[[RNA virus]]\n*[[Transcription (genetics)|Transcription]]\n*[[Translation (genetics)|Translation]]\n*[[Virus#Replication|Viral replication]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sense (Molecular Biology)}}\n[[Category:DNA]]\n[[Category:RNA]]\n[[Category:Molecular biology]]\n[[Category:Virology]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Property of nucleic acid strands with respect to their translatability into protein}}\nIn [[molecular biology]] and [[genetics]], the '''sense''' of a [[nucleic acid]] molecule, particularly of a strand of [[DNA]] or [[RNA]], refers to the nature of the roles of the strand and its [[complementarity (molecular biology)|complement]] in specifying a sequence of [[amino acid]]s. Depending on the context, sense may have slightly different meanings. For example, DNA is positive-sense if an RNA version of the same sequence is translated or translatable into protein, negative-sense if not.\n\n==DNA sense==\nBecause of the [[complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] nature of [[base-pairing]] between nucleic acid polymers, a double-stranded DNA molecule will be composed of two strands with sequences that are complements of each other. To help molecular biologists specifically identify each strand individually, the two strands are usually differentiated as the \"sense\" strand and the \"antisense\" strand. An individual strand of DNA is referred to as '''positive-sense''' (also '''positive (+)''' or simply '''sense''') if its [[nucleic acid sequence|nucleotide sequence]] corresponds directly to the sequence of an RNA [[transcription (biology)|transcript]] which is [[translation (biology)|translated]] or translatable into a sequence of [[amino acid]]s (provided that any [[thymine]] bases in the DNA sequence are replaced with [[uracil]] bases in the RNA sequence). The other strand of the double-stranded DNA molecule is referred to as '''negative-sense''' (also '''negative (-)''' or '''antisense'''), and is complementary to both the positive-sense strand and the RNA transcript. It is actually the antisense strand that is used as the template from which [[RNA polymerase]]s construct the RNA transcript, but the complementary base-pairing by which nucleic acid polymerization occurs means that the sequence of the RNA transcript will ultimately look more similar to the sequence of the sense strand than that of the antisense template (again, the only exception being the RNA transcript's use of uracil instead of thymine).\n\nSometimes the phrases '''coding strand''' and '''template strand''' are encountered in place of sense and antisense, respectively, and in the context of a double-stranded DNA molecule the usage of these terms is essentially equivalent. However, the coding/sense strand need not always contain a code that is used to make a protein; both protein-coding and [[non-coding RNA]]s may be transcribed.\n\nThe terms \"sense\" and \"antisense\" are relative only to the particular RNA transcript in question, and not to the DNA strand as a whole. In other words, either DNA strand can serve as the sense or antisense strand. Most organisms with sufficiently large genomes make use of both strands, with each strand functioning as the template strand for different RNA transcripts in different places along the same DNA molecule. In some cases, RNA transcripts can be transcribed in both directions (i.e. on either strand) from a common [[promoter (biology)|promoter]] region, or be transcribed from within [[introns]] on either strand (see \"ambisense\" below).<ref>{{cite journal |title=Expression strategies of ambisense viruses |author= Anne-Lise Haenni |journal=Virus Research |volume=93 |issue=2 |year=2003 |pages=141\u2013150 |doi=10.1016/S0168-1702(03)00094-7 |pmid=12782362}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |journal=J Gen Virol |year=1991 |volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=465\u20138 |title=Ambisense segment 3 of rice stripe virus: the first instance of a virus containing two ambisense segments |author1=Kakutani T |author2=Hayano Y |author3=Hayashi T |author4=Minobe Y. |pmid=1993885 |doi=10.1099/0022-1317-72-2-465}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |journal=J Gen Virol |year=1991 |volume=72 |issue=4 |pages=763\u20137 |title=Complete nucleotide sequence of RNA 3 of rice stripe virus: an ambisense coding strategy |author1=Zhu Y |author2=Hayakawa T |author3=Toriyama S |author4=Takahashi M. |pmid=2016591 |doi=10.1099/0022-1317-72-4-763}}</ref>\n\n===Antisense DNA===\nThe DNA sense strand looks like the [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA) transcript, and can therefore be used to read the expected [[codon]] sequence that will ultimately be used during [[translation (biology)|translation]] (protein synthesis) to build an amino acid sequence and then a protein. For example, the sequence \"ATG\" within a DNA sense strand corresponds to an \"AUG\" codon in the mRNA, which [[genetic code|codes]] for the amino acid [[methionine]]. However, the DNA sense strand itself is not used as the template for the mRNA; it is the DNA antisense strand which serves as the source for the protein code, because, with bases complementary to the DNA sense strand, it is used as a template for the mRNA. Since [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] results in an RNA product complementary to the DNA template strand, the mRNA is complementary to the DNA antisense strand.[[Image:Antisense DNA oligonucleotide.png|Schematic showing how antisense DNA strands can interfere with protein translation|thumb|250px|right]]\n\nHence, a base triplet 3'-TAC-5' in the DNA antisense strand (complementary to the 5'-ATG-3' of the DNA sense strand) is used as the template which results in a 5'-AUG-3' base triplet in the mRNA. The DNA sense strand will have the triplet ATG, which looks similar to the mRNA triplet AUG but will not be used to make methionine because it will not be directly used to make mRNA. The DNA sense strand is called a \"sense\" strand not because it will be used to make protein (it won't be), but because it has a sequence that corresponds directly to the RNA codon sequence. By this logic, the RNA transcript itself is sometimes described as \"sense\".\n\n===Example with double-stranded DNA===\n:''DNA strand 1: antisense strand'' (transcribed to) \u2192 ''RNA strand (sense)''\n\n:''DNA strand 2: sense strand''\n\nSome regions within a double-stranded DNA molecule code for [[gene]]s, which are usually instructions specifying the order in which amino acids are assembled to make proteins, as well as regulatory sequences, [[RNA splicing|splicing]] sites, non-coding [[intron]]s, and other [[gene product]]s. For a cell to use this information, one strand of the DNA serves as a template for the synthesis of a complementary strand of [[RNA]]. The transcribed DNA strand is called the template strand, with antisense sequence, and the mRNA transcript produced from it is said to be sense sequence (the complement of antisense). The untranscribed DNA strand, complementary to the transcribed strand, is also said to have sense sequence; it has the same sense sequence as the mRNA transcript (though T bases in DNA are substituted with U bases in RNA).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"3\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n| <span style=\"color: blue;\">'''<tt>3'CGCTATAGCGTTT&nbsp;5'</tt>'''</span> || <span style=\"color: blue;\">DNA antisense strand</span> (template/noncoding) || Used as a template for transcription.\n|-\n| <span style=\"color: red;\">'''<tt>5'GCGATATCGCAAA&nbsp;3'</tt>'''</span> || <span style=\"color: red;\">DNA sense strand</span> (nontemplate/coding)|| Complementary to the template strand.\n|-\n| <span style=\"color: blue;\"><tt>5'GCGAUAUCGCAAA&nbsp;3'</tt></span> || mRNA sense transcript || RNA strand that is transcribed from the noncoding (template/antisense) strand.

This makes the mechanism of gene silencing catalytic. Double-stranded RNA can also act as a catalytic, enzyme-dependent antisense agent through the [[RNAi]]/[[siRNA]] pathway, involving target mRNA recognition through sense-antisense strand pairing followed by target mRNA degradation by the [[RNA-induced silencing complex]] (RISC). The R1 plasmid [[hok/sok system]] provides yet another example of an enzyme-dependent antisense regulation process through enzymatic degradation of the resulting RNA duplex.\n\nOther antisense mechanisms are not enzyme-dependent, but involve steric blocking of their target RNA (e.g. to prevent translation or to induce alternative splicing). Steric blocking antisense mechanisms often use oligonucleotides that are heavily modified. Since there is no need for RNase H recognition, this can include chemistries such as 2'-O-alkyl, [[peptide nucleic acid]] (PNA), [[locked nucleic acid]] (LNA), and [[Morpholino]] oligomers.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Antisense therapy]]\n*[[Directionality (molecular biology)]]\n*[[DNA codon table]]\n*[[RNA virus]]\n*[[Transcription (genetics)|Transcription]]\n*[[Translation (genetics)|Translation]]\n*[[Virus#Replication|Viral replication]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sense (Molecular Biology)}}\n[[Category:DNA]]\n[[Category:RNA]]\n[[Category:Molecular biology]]\n[[Category:Virology]]\n", "name_user": "DocWatson42", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRNA sense in viruses:Performed minor cleanup, especially on punctuation.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_(molecular_biology)"}
