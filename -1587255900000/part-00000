Klinger]], who had access to Stoker's original ''Dracula'' manuscript<ref>Klinger, page xii</ref> while researching his 2008 book ''The New Annotated Dracula'', saw evidence of \"Dracula's Guest\" having been deleted from the manuscript, such as a deleted sentence of Harker commenting that his throat is \"still sore from the licking of the gray wolf's file-like tongue\"<ref>Klinger, page 39, note 99</ref> and the first and second chapters of the finished novel being labeled in the manuscript as \"ii\"<ref>Klinger, page 9, note 1</ref> and \"iii\".<ref>Klinger, page 40, note 1</ref> Klinger ultimately concludes the following:\n\n{{blockquote|And so what may we make of [\"Dracula's Guest\"]? Without the name \"Dracula\" appearing in the title and [Dracula's] message [sent to the narrator], there would be very little to connect this traveler's tale with [the novel ''Dracula'']. The style is completely different; the narrator shares few characteristics with Jonathan Harker; and the action somehow fails to connect the story set forth in [''Dracula'']. However, there are numerous references in the [''Dracula''] Manuscript to some version of the tale eventually published as \"Dracula's Guest.\" Most likely, a different draft \u2014 one that identified the narrator as Harker \u2014 was included in ... an early version of [the ''Dracula'' manuscript]. It may be that Stoker's publisher requested that the book be shortened, or the publisher (or Stoker) may have felt that the \"stylistic\" aspects of the narrative were more important than its veracity.

It is [[Walpurgis Night]], and in spite of the hotelier's warning to not return late, the young man later leaves his carriage and wanders toward the direction of an abandoned \"unholy\" village. As the carriage departs with the frightened and superstitious driver, a tall and thin stranger scares the horses at the crest of a hill.\n\nAfter a few hours, as he reaches a desolate valley, it begins to snow; as a dark storm gathers intensity, the Englishman takes shelter in a grove of [[cypress]] and [[Taxus baccata|yew]] trees. The Englishman's location is soon illuminated by moonlight to be a cemetery, and he finds himself before a marble tomb with a large iron stake driven through the roof, the inscription reads: \"Countess Dolingen of [[Graz|Gratz]] / in [[Styria]] / sought and found death / 1801\". This inscription is now recognised as being a tribute to [[Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu]], one of Stoker's fellow predecessor in terms of vampire writing. Le Fanu's  [[Carmilla]] (1872) deals with a protagonist showing resemblances with Countess Dolingen. [[Carmilla]]'s main protagonist is ultimately revealed to Countess Millarca Karnestein, a vampire.<ref>Robert Tracy, \"Introduction\" ''In a Glass Darkly''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993: p.xxi</ref> Inscribed on the back of the tomb, graven in great Russian letters, is: \"The dead travel fast\", which was an ode to the fable \"[[Lenore (ballad)|Lenore]]\".\n\nThe Englishman is disturbed to be in such a place on such a night and as the storm breaks anew, he is forced by pelting hail to shelter in the doorway of the tomb. As he does so, the bronze door of the tomb opens under his weight and a flash of forked lightning shows the interior - and a \"beautiful woman with rounded cheeks and red lips, seemingly sleeping on a bier\". The force of the following thunder peal throws the Englishman from the doorway (experienced as \"being grasped as by the hand of a giant\") as another lightning bolt strikes the iron spike, destroying the tomb and the now screaming woman inside.\n\nThe Englishman's troubles are not quite over, as he painfully regains his senses from the ordeal, he is repulsed by a feeling of loathing which he connects to a warm feeling in his chest and a licking at this throat. The Englishman summons courage to peek through his eyelashes and discovers a gigantic [[wolf]] with flaming eyes is attending him.\n\nMilitary horsemen are the next to wake the semi-conscious man, chasing the wolf away with torches and guns. Some horsemen return to the main party and the Englishman after the chase, reporting that they had not found 'him' and that the Englishman's animal is \"[[werewolf|a wolf - and yet not a wolf]]\".\nThey also note that blood is on the ruined tomb, yet the Englishman's neck is unbloodied. \"See comrades, the wolf has been lying on him and keeping his blood warm\". Later, the Englishman finds his neck pained when a horseman comments on it.\n\nWhen the Englishman is taken back to his hotel by the men, he is informed that it is none other than his expectant host Dracula that has alerted his employees, the horsemen, of \"dangers from snow and wolves and night\" in a telegram received by the hotel during the time the Englishman was away.\n\n== Adaptations ==\n\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2010}}\n*[[David O.

The style is completely different; the narrator shares few characteristics with Jonathan Harker; and the action somehow fails to connect the story set forth in [''Dracula''].

It may be that Stoker's publisher requested that the book be shortened, or the publisher (or Stoker) may have felt that the \"stylistic\" aspects of the narrative were more important than its veracity.

It is [[Walpurgis Night]], and in spite of the hotelier's warning to not return late, the young man later leaves his carriage and wanders toward the direction of an abandoned \"unholy\" village. As the carriage departs with the frightened and superstitious driver, a tall and thin stranger scares the horses at the crest of a hill.\n\nAfter a few hours, as he reaches a desolate valley, it begins to snow; as a dark storm gathers intensity, the Englishman takes shelter in a grove of [[cypress]] and [[Taxus baccata|yew]] trees. The Englishman's location is soon illuminated by moonlight to be a cemetery, and he finds himself before a marble tomb with a large iron stake driven through the roof, the inscription reads: \"Countess Dolingen of [[Graz|Gratz]] / in [[Styria]] / sought and found death / 1801\". This inscription is now recognised as being a tribute to [[Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu]], one of Stoker's fellow predecessor in terms of vampire writing. Le Fanu's  [[Carmilla]] (1872) deals with a protagonist showing resemblances with Countess Dolingen. [[Carmilla]]'s main protagonist is ultimately revealed to Countess Millarca Karnestein, a vampire.<ref>Robert Tracy, \"Introduction\" ''In a Glass Darkly''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993: p.xxi</ref> Inscribed on the back of the tomb, graven in great Russian letters, is: \"The dead travel fast\", which was an ode to the fable \"[[Lenore (ballad)|Lenore]]\".\n\nThe Englishman is disturbed to be in such a place on such a night and as the storm breaks anew, he is forced by pelting hail to shelter in the doorway of the tomb. As he does so, the bronze door of the tomb opens under his weight and a flash of forked lightning shows the interior - and a \"beautiful woman with rounded cheeks and red lips, seemingly sleeping on a bier\". The force of the following thunder peal throws the Englishman from the doorway (experienced as \"being grasped as by the hand of a giant\") as another lightning bolt strikes the iron spike, destroying the tomb and the now screaming woman inside.\n\nThe Englishman's troubles are not quite over, as he painfully regains his senses from the ordeal, he is repulsed by a feeling of loathing which he connects to a warm feeling in his chest and a licking at this throat. The Englishman summons courage to peek through his eyelashes and discovers a gigantic [[wolf]] with flaming eyes is attending him.\n\nMilitary horsemen are the next to wake the semi-conscious man, chasing the wolf away with torches and guns. Some horsemen return to the main party and the Englishman after the chase, reporting that they had not found 'him' and that the Englishman's animal is \"[[werewolf|a wolf - and yet not a wolf]]\".\nThey also note that blood is on the ruined tomb, yet the Englishman's neck is unbloodied. \"See comrades, the wolf has been lying on him and keeping his blood warm\". Later, the Englishman finds his neck pained when a horseman comments on it.\n\nWhen the Englishman is taken back to his hotel by the men, he is informed that it is none other than his expectant host Dracula that has alerted his employees, the horsemen, of \"dangers from snow and wolves and night\" in a telegram received by the hotel during the time the Englishman was away.\n\n== Adaptations ==\n\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2010}}\n*[[David O.

The total damage by the severe weather was in excess of $1&nbsp;billion.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Meteorological synopsis==\nThe period of active weather started with a major [[derecho]] event on March 9 across the [[South Central United States]], that also included several [[tornado]]es, although straight-line winds did most of the damage. Numerous injuries and at least two fatalities were reported, but mostly due to the [[thunderstorm]] winds. The two fatalities were as a result of a weather-related [[automobile accident]] and a fire started by [[lightning]].<ref>[http://asia.news.yahoo.com/060310/ap/d8g8gbuo1.html Two Killed in Violent Southern Storms<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Tens of thousands of people also lost [[electricity]] throughout the region.<ref>[https://archive.is/20130202055039/http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/nation/20060309-2043-southernstorms.html SignOnSanDiego.com > News > Nation - One dead in lightning fire, school damaged as storms sweep South<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nActivity calmed down on March 10 with little severe weather reported, but picked up again the next day.\n\nOn the evening of March 11, 18 tornadoes developed across the region. One of them flattened a [[mobile home]] park and left many people injured and at least 2 dead in [[Perry County, Missouri]]. Several other tornadoes left heavy damage in [[Missouri]], [[Illinois]] and [[Arkansas]]. The tornadoes were accompanied by very large [[hail]], some as large as [[softball]]s.\n\nMore severe weather developed in the morning of March 12. The [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area]] was hardest hit, with significant wind and hail damage to many homes and businesses, but only two tornadoes in the far northwestern part of the area.<ref>http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/14082566.htm</ref> Significant damage was also reported at the [[University of Kansas]] in [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]] and at the [[Great Wolf Lodge Indoor Water Park]].

In addition, microburst winds exceeding 90&nbsp;mph (145&nbsp;km/h) and hail as large as [[softball]]s have been reported. Several major tornadoes were reported in [[Missouri]] (along Interstate 70 near Columbia MO; there was also an F4 tornado to the north/northeast of Columbia and just to the north of the St. Louis Viewing Area).  Significant destruction from separate tornadoes was dealt to Pike County Missouri (north of St. Louis) as well as central [[Illinois]].\n\nOne exceptionally long-lived [[supercell]] thunderstorm was responsible for many of the tornadoes on March 12. This storm began in the morning over northern Oklahoma before embarking on a nearly 800 mile (1290&nbsp;km) journey northeast across southeastern Kansas, Missouri during the afternoon and early evening, into Illinois during the mid-to-late evening, through Indiana by the late evening, and into lower Michigan where it lost severe characteristics more than 17.5&nbsp;hours after inception. This is one of the longest documented path and duration of a supercell on record. The city of [[Springfield, Illinois]] saw two strong tornadoes track directly through the city from this storm. It also did damage near [[Sedalia, Missouri|Sedalia]], [[Columbia, Missouri|Columbia]], and [[Mexico, Missouri]]. The strongest tornado, spawned by a different supercell, was a rare [[multiple vortex tornado|double tornado]] rated F4, but fortunately it remained over mainly rural countryside.\n\nFifteen more tornadoes \u2013 all of them weak \u2013 were reported on March 13 in [[Alabama]] and [[Mississippi]] before the system finally weakened and the severe weather came to an end.\n\n==Confirmed tornadoes==\n{{Tornado Chart | Total=99 | F0=45 | F1=26 | F2=16 | F3=11 | F4=1 | F5=0 }}\n\n===March 9 event===\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" width=\"100%\"\n!colspan=\"6\"|List of confirmed tornadoes \u2013 Thursday, March 9, 2006\n|-\n|<center>'''[[Fujita scale|F#]]'''</center> || <center>'''Location'''</center> || <center>'''County'''</center> || <center>'''Time (UTC)'''</center> || <center>'''Path length'''</center> || <center>'''Damage'''</center>\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\" align=center|'''[[Arkansas]]'''\n|-\n|bgcolor=#{{Storm colour|cat1}} | <big>'''F1'''</big>\n|'''SE of [[Scott, Arkansas|Scott]]'''\n|[[Lonoke County, Arkansas|Lonoke]]\n|1140\n|1&nbsp;mile <br />(1.6&nbsp;km)\n|Tornado overturned a recreational vehicle and damaged roofs on several homes.

A record wind gust of 107&nbsp;mph (172&nbsp;km/h) was recorded at the [[Quad Cities Airport]] in [[Moline, Illinois|Moline]]. The wind measurement was verified with backup equipment from the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] after the main instrument failed.\n\nThe winds, which were equivalent to a strong [[Category 2 hurricane]], caused severe damage to numerous houses, along with countless trees and power lines. The damage was reported to have been caused by a [[microburst]].\n\n===Northern Illinois===\nA [[microburst]] containing winds between 85&nbsp;mph (137&nbsp;km/h) and 100&nbsp;mph (162&nbsp;km/h) was reported in [[Bridgeview, Illinois|Bridgeview]], a south suburb of [[Chicago]]. The microburst hit the area just after midnight on March 13, and may have been part of a supercell to hit the southern suburbs just before the thunderstorm complex exited the area at 3:00&nbsp;a.m. CST. Roofs were ripped off apartments along a three block length, and seven garages were damaged or destroyed, according to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'.<ref>[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/custom/newsroom/chi-060313chicagoweather,1,543036.story?coll=chi-news-hed Topic Galleries - chicagotribune.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Harlem Avenue in Bridgeview ([[Illinois Route 43]]) in the vicinity of 77th Street was closed for four hours while debris was cleared from the road.\n\nFlash flooding closed [[U.S. Route 45]] around [[U.S. Route 30]], but major flooding was not reported on any of the area highways during the rush hour. 15,000 customers were left without power as the thunderstorms passed.

Four more construction workers were injured, one seriously, in [[Antioch, Illinois|Antioch]] when a roof being constructed for a new church collapsed due to the wind. A [[Wind Advisory]] was issued by the National Weather Service, indicating sustained winds of at least 30&nbsp;mph (50&nbsp;km/h) and gusts of up to 50&nbsp;mph (80&nbsp;km/h).\n\n===Eastern Illinois===\nBoth [[Ford County, Illinois]] and [[Iroquois County, Illinois]] recorded damage due to microbursts. In Ford County along [[Illinois Route 9]], power poles were snapped and damage to vehicles was recorded and attributed to a microburst which had winds between 85&nbsp;mph (137&nbsp;km/h) and 100&nbsp;mph (162&nbsp;km/h). In Iroquois County, most of a cattle building was blown into a field just west of [[Illinois Route 1]] near [[Milford, Illinois|Milford]]. This microburst had reported winds of 90&nbsp;mph (145&nbsp;km/h).\n\nDamage around [[Crescent City, Illinois|Crescent City]] and [[Interstate 57]] in Iroquois County was likely caused by straight-line winds.\n<ref>[http://www.crh.noaa.gov/crnews/display_story.php?wfo=lot&storyid=1821&source=0 Damage Survey for Storms on March 12<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of North American tornadoes and tornado outbreaks]]\n*[[Tornadoes of 2006]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.spc.noaa.gov/ Storm Prediction Center]\n\n{{2006 tornado outbreaks}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:2006-03-09 tornado outbreak}}\n[[Category:F4 tornadoes by date]]\n[[Category:F4 tornadoes by location| ,2006-03-09]]\n[[Category:Tornadoes of 2006]]\n[[Category:Tornadoes in Illinois]]\n[[Category:Tornadoes in Missouri]]\n[[Category:Derechos in the United States]]\n[[Category:2006 natural disasters in the United States]]\n[[Category:March 2006 events in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox storm\n| name = March 2006 Tornado Outbreak Sequence\n| image = Sprilltor.jpg\n| alt = \n| caption = Tornado damage in Springfield, Illinois\n| type = Tornado outbreak\n| active = March 9\u201313, 2006 \n| lowest pressure = \n| lowest temperature =\n| tornadoes = 99 confirmed\n| fujitascale = F4\n| tornado duration = 4 days, 14 hours, 45 minutes\n| highest winds = \n| hail = \n| gusts =\n| maximum snow = \n| power outages =\n| total fatalities = 10 fatalities (+2 non-tornadic), 183 injuries\n| damages = >$1 billion<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/reports/billionz.html NCDC: Billion Dollar U.S. Weather Disasters<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n| affected = [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] and [[Southern United States]]\n| current advisories =\n| enhanced =\n| notes = \n}}\nThe '''March 2006 tornado outbreak sequence''' was an early season and long lasting [[tornado outbreak sequence]] in the [[central United States]] that started on the morning of March 9 and continued for over four days until the evening of March 13.

Numerous injuries and at least two fatalities were reported, but mostly due to the [[thunderstorm]] winds. The two fatalities were as a result of a weather-related [[automobile accident]] and a fire started by [[lightning]].<ref>[http://asia.news.yahoo.com/060310/ap/d8g8gbuo1.html Two Killed in Violent Southern Storms<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Tens of thousands of people also lost [[electricity]] throughout the region.<ref>[https://archive.is/20130202055039/http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/nation/20060309-2043-southernstorms.html SignOnSanDiego.com > News > Nation - One dead in lightning fire, school damaged as storms sweep South<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nActivity calmed down on March 10 with little severe weather reported, but picked up again the next day.\n\nOn the evening of March 11, 18 tornadoes developed across the region. One of them flattened a [[mobile home]] park and left many people injured and at least 2 dead in [[Perry County, Missouri]]. Several other tornadoes left heavy damage in [[Missouri]], [[Illinois]] and [[Arkansas]]. The tornadoes were accompanied by very large [[hail]], some as large as [[softball]]s.\n\nMore severe weather developed in the morning of March 12. The [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area]] was hardest hit, with significant wind and hail damage to many homes and businesses, but only two tornadoes in the far northwestern part of the area.<ref>http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/14082566.htm</ref> Significant damage was also reported at the [[University of Kansas]] in [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]] and at the [[Great Wolf Lodge Indoor Water Park]].

In addition, microburst winds exceeding 90&nbsp;mph (145&nbsp;km/h) and hail as large as [[softball]]s have been reported. Several major tornadoes were reported in [[Missouri]] (along Interstate 70 near Columbia MO; there was also an F4 tornado to the north/northeast of Columbia and just to the north of the St. Louis Viewing Area).  Significant destruction from separate tornadoes was dealt to Pike County Missouri (north of St. Louis) as well as central [[Illinois]].\n\nOne exceptionally long-lived [[supercell]] thunderstorm was responsible for many of the tornadoes on March 12. This storm began in the morning over northern Oklahoma before embarking on a nearly 800 mile (1290&nbsp;km) journey northeast across southeastern Kansas, Missouri during the afternoon and early evening, into Illinois during the mid-to-late evening, through Indiana by the late evening, and into lower Michigan where it lost severe characteristics more than 17.5&nbsp;hours after inception. This is one of the longest documented path and duration of a supercell on record. The city of [[Springfield, Illinois]] saw two strong tornadoes track directly through the city from this storm. It also did damage near [[Sedalia, Missouri|Sedalia]], [[Columbia, Missouri|Columbia]], and [[Mexico, Missouri]]. The strongest tornado, spawned by a different supercell, was a rare [[multiple vortex tornado|double tornado]] rated F4, but fortunately it remained over mainly rural countryside.\n\nFifteen more tornadoes \u2013 all of them weak \u2013 were reported on March 13 in [[Alabama]] and [[Mississippi]] before the system finally weakened and the severe weather came to an end.\n\n==Confirmed tornadoes==\n{{Tornado Chart | Total=99 | F0=45 | F1=26 | F2=16 | F3=11 | F4=1 | F5=0 }}\n\n===March 9 event===\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" width=\"100%\"\n!colspan=\"6\"|List of confirmed tornadoes \u2013 Thursday, March 9, 2006\n|-\n|<center>'''[[Fujita scale|F#]]'''</center> || <center>'''Location'''</center> || <center>'''County'''</center> || <center>'''Time (UTC)'''</center> || <center>'''Path length'''</center> || <center>'''Damage'''</center>\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\" align=center|'''[[Arkansas]]'''\n|-\n|bgcolor=#{{Storm colour|cat1}} | <big>'''F1'''</big>\n|'''SE of [[Scott, Arkansas|Scott]]'''\n|[[Lonoke County, Arkansas|Lonoke]]\n|1140\n|1&nbsp;mile <br />(1.6&nbsp;km)\n|Tornado overturned a recreational vehicle and damaged roofs on several homes.

A record wind gust of 107&nbsp;mph (172&nbsp;km/h) was recorded at the [[Quad Cities Airport]] in [[Moline, Illinois|Moline]]. The wind measurement was verified with backup equipment from the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] after the main instrument failed.\n\nThe winds, which were equivalent to a strong [[Category 2 hurricane]], caused severe damage to numerous houses, along with countless trees and power lines. The damage was reported to have been caused by a [[microburst]].\n\n===Northern Illinois===\nA [[microburst]] containing winds between 85&nbsp;mph (137&nbsp;km/h) and 100&nbsp;mph (162&nbsp;km/h) was reported in [[Bridgeview, Illinois|Bridgeview]], a south suburb of [[Chicago]]. The microburst hit the area just after midnight on March 13, and may have been part of a supercell to hit the southern suburbs just before the thunderstorm complex exited the area at 3:00&nbsp;a.m. CST. Roofs were ripped off apartments along a three block length, and seven garages were damaged or destroyed, according to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'.<ref>[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/custom/newsroom/chi-060313chicagoweather,1,543036.story?coll=chi-news-hed Topic Galleries - chicagotribune.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Harlem Avenue in Bridgeview ([[Illinois Route 43]]) in the vicinity of 77th Street was closed for four hours while debris was cleared from the road.\n\nFlash flooding closed [[U.S. Route 45]] around [[U.S. Route 30]], but major flooding was not reported on any of the area highways during the rush hour. 15,000 customers were left without power as the thunderstorms passed.

Four more construction workers were injured, one seriously, in [[Antioch, Illinois|Antioch]] when a roof being constructed for a new church collapsed due to the wind. A [[Wind Advisory]] was issued by the National Weather Service, indicating sustained winds of at least 30&nbsp;mph (50&nbsp;km/h) and gusts of up to 50&nbsp;mph (80&nbsp;km/h).\n\n===Eastern Illinois===\nBoth [[Ford County, Illinois]] and [[Iroquois County, Illinois]] recorded damage due to microbursts. In Ford County along [[Illinois Route 9]], power poles were snapped and damage to vehicles was recorded and attributed to a microburst which had winds between 85&nbsp;mph (137&nbsp;km/h) and 100&nbsp;mph (162&nbsp;km/h). In Iroquois County, most of a cattle building was blown into a field just west of [[Illinois Route 1]] near [[Milford, Illinois|Milford]]. This microburst had reported winds of 90&nbsp;mph (145&nbsp;km/h).\n\nDamage around [[Crescent City, Illinois|Crescent City]] and [[Interstate 57]] in Iroquois County was likely caused by straight-line winds.\n<ref>[http://www.crh.noaa.gov/crnews/display_story.php?wfo=lot&storyid=1821&source=0 Damage Survey for Storms on March 12<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of North American tornadoes and tornado outbreaks]]\n*[[Tornadoes of 2006]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.spc.noaa.gov/ Storm Prediction Center]\n\n{{2006 tornado outbreaks}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:2006-03-09 tornado outbreak}}\n[[Category:F4 tornadoes by date]]\n[[Category:F4 tornadoes by location| ,2006-03-09]]\n[[Category:Tornadoes of 2006]]\n[[Category:Tornadoes in Illinois]]\n[[Category:Tornadoes in Missouri]]\n[[Category:Derechos in the United States]]\n[[Category:2006 natural disasters in the United States]]\n[[Category:March 2006 events in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "ChessEric", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed another error", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_2006_tornado_outbreak_sequence"}

A number of mechanical revisions and refinements were made due to the suggestions of the Neri and Bonacini racing development shop and test driver Bob Wallace.  The body was redesigned by Carrozzeria Touring, retaining the original profile while cleaning up details of the design to result in a more cohesive appearance.

Dallara's redesign for the production 350 GT used larger {{Convert|60|mm|in|abbr=on}} square-section steel tubing in a central \"floor\", with front and rear cradles made from {{Convert|50|mm|in|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|25|mm|in|abbr=on}} tubing to support the engine, rear differential and suspension mountings.

[[List of awards and nominations received by Fiona Apple|Her accolades]] include one [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance|Grammy Award]], and an additional seven Grammy Award nominations in various categories.\n\nThe daughter of actor [[Brandon Maggart]], Apple was born in [[New York City]] but was raised alternating between New York and her father's home in [[Los Angeles]]. Classically trained on piano as a child, she began composing her own songs when she was eight years old. Her debut album, ''[[Tidal (album)|Tidal]]'', containing songs written when she was 17, was released in 1996 and received a Grammy Award for Best Female Vocal Rock Performance for the single \"[[Criminal (Fiona Apple song)|Criminal]]\". She followed with ''[[When the Pawn...]]'' (1999), produced by [[Jon Brion]], which was also critically and commercially successful and was certified platinum.\n\nFor her third album, ''[[Extraordinary Machine]]'' (2005), Apple again collaborated with Brion, and began recording the album in 2002. However, Apple was reportedly unhappy with the production and opted not to release the record, leading fans to protest [[Epic Records]], erroneously believing that the label was withholding its release.

Classically trained on piano as a child, she began composing her own songs when she was eight years old. Her debut album, ''[[Tidal (album)|Tidal]]'', containing songs written when Apple was 17, was released in 1996 and received a Grammy Award for Best Female Vocal Rock Performance for the single \"[[Criminal (Fiona Apple song)|Criminal]]\". She followed with ''[[When the Pawn...]]'' (1999), produced by [[Jon Brion]], which was also critically and commercially successful and was certified platinum.\n\nFor her third album, ''[[Extraordinary Machine]]'' (2005), Apple again collaborated with Brion, and began recording the album in 2002. However, Apple was reportedly unhappy with the production and opted not to release the record, leading fans to protest [[Epic Records]], erroneously believing that the label was withholding its release. The album was eventually re-produced without Brion and released in October 2005. The album was certified [[Gold album|gold]], and nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album]]. In 2012, she released her fourth studio album, ''[[The Idler Wheel...]]'', which received critical praise and was followed by a tour of the United States and was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album]] in 2013.
