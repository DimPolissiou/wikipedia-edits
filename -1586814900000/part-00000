Production halted again in 1950 when the Standard engine ceased to be available, but resumed in 1955 when a suitable replacement, the side-valve 1,172 cc Ford 100E engine was found, and has continued ever since.\n\nThe 4/4 now uses the +8 chassis and a Ford engine.\n\n=== Morgan +8 ===\n{{main|Morgan Plus 8}}\nFaced with the decreasing availability of large four-cylinder engines for use in their +4 models, Morgan began to install the recently available [[Rover V8 engine]] in their cars in 1968, giving these cars the model designation \"+8\".\n\nThe engine displacement jumped from the 2.3&nbsp;L of the Triumph TR4 engine to 3.5&nbsp;L, then 3.9&nbsp;L (1990), 4.0 (1998\u20132004) with an optional 4.6L (1996\u20132000) all based on the same Land Rover block. However, this V-8 was no heavier than the Triumph engine. These features made the +8 accelerate much more quickly than the early +4 and also improved its road-holding capability.\n\nHorsepower (143\u2013204&nbsp;bhp), weight and performance varied with emission and structural laws through its history. Thus powered, the car could accelerate from 0\u201360 mph in 5.6 seconds. In its final form, the GEMS Land Rover V8 produced {{convert|190|hp|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[File:2006 SAG - Morgan roadster - 05.jpg|thumb|Roadster at 76e international Motorshow Geneva 2006]]\n\n=== Roadster ===\n{{main|Morgan Roadster}}\nIn 2004, Morgan came out with a traditional styled model to replace the departing Plus 8. The Mk I Roadsters with the Ford UK Mondeo V6 produced 223&nbsp;bhp (166&nbsp;kW, 226 PS) at 6150 rev/min. It had a [[Magna PT|Getrag]] gearbox with direct drive in 5th with a 3.08 axle ratio. Later Marks had a Ford gearbox with direct drive in 4th with a 3.73 axle ratio. The overall gearing is virtually the same. The later Roadsters were powered by a Ford UK Mondeo V6 producing {{convert|204|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. In 2007, the Mondeo engine was replaced by a US-specification version of the same engine in the Roadster II. In 2011\u201312, the engine was replaced by the 3.7 Duratec Cyclone engine and output increased to {{convert|280|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.

(Contrary to popular myth, however, the [[chassis]] is metal; [[aluminium]] for the Aero 8.) The Aero 8, with a [[BMW]] [[V8 engine]] in a car weighing less than a [[BMW Z4]] and considerably less than a [[BMW M3]], (though more than traditional Morgans) is even faster than the Plus 8, delivering what ''[[Autoweek]]'' magazine termed [[supercar]] performance. The newest Aero 8 (series V), presented in March 2015, puts out {{convert|367|hp|abbr=on}} at 6100 rpm with the company suggesting a top speed of over {{convert|170|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Due to the Aero 8's light weight it can do 0\u201362&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h) in 4.5 seconds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seriouswheels.com/cars/top-2006-Morgan-Aeromax.htm |title=2006 Morgan Aeromax |publisher=Seriouswheels.com |date= |accessdate=17 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nDuring its customer production lifetime (2002\u20132009), the Aero was configured in five official versions, (I, II, III, IV, the Aero America and V) with mild variations in styling, engines, transmissions, braking and suspension. The company canceled the model in 2009 but relaunched it in 2015 for 2016 deliveries. The year of highest production for any Aero variation was 2002.\n\n=== Morgan AeroMax ===\n[[File:Morgan-Aeromax-rear.jpg|thumb|Morgan AeroMax, showing distinct boat tail rear]]\n{{main|Morgan Aero 8}}\nThe Aero was followed by the Aeromax, a limited edition of 100 units produced between 2008 and early 2010.

The Eva GT would use [[BMW N54]] twin-turbo straight-6 producing 302&nbsp;bhp, Euro-6 emissions compliant. Shown at Pebble Beach in clay in 2010 and expected to go on sale in 2012, deposits have been taken since 2010. At the end of 2011, Morgan announced that it would use new magnesium technology for the body and therefore it would not be represented until 2014 with deliveries after that.

This vehicle was driven across the States, from New York to Los Angeles by Charles Morgan and his wife, covering 3000 miles, in the [[Gumball 3000]]. At the end of the seven-day drive, the Morgan 3 Wheeler was awarded the \"Spirit of Gumball\" prize.\n\n== General characteristics ==\n[[File:MorganSuspension.jpg|thumb|Traditional Morgan [[sliding pillar suspension]]]]\nIn spite of their traditional design, Morgans have always had sporting or \"sports car\" performance, due to their extremely low weight.\n\nAmong their enthusiasts, Morgans are affectionately known as \"Moggies\".\n\n=== Suspension ===\nH.F.S. Morgan's 1909 runabout used [[sliding pillar suspension]], an [[independent front suspension]] system with each front wheel mounted on a stub axle able to slide up and down a fixed pillar that also acts as the [[kingpin (automotive part)|kingpin]] and supported by a spring and external shock absorber (damper). One advantage is reduced unsprung weight, theoretically allowing the tyre and wheel to better respond to road surface irregularities. The Morgan system is described as an 'inverted' sliding pillar, as the pillar is fixed and the hub carrier slides over it. Earlier systems had the wheel carried on the pillar, sliding through a bush on the axle.\n\nMorgan used developments of this suspension system throughout its existence, and it is still used on Morgan's \"classic\" line, although not on the Aero 8 or its derivatives. It has been cancelled, along with all the Morgan Classic line, in 2019. However, some \"classics\", shipped in parts to avoid the need for normal compliancy, will be shipped to the USA, and assembled there for an indefinite period.\n\n== Models ==\n* 1909 Runabout\n* 1911\u20131939 [[V-Twin 3-wheeler]]\n* 1932\u20131952 [[F-Series 3-wheeler]]\n* 1936\u2013present [[Morgan 4/4|4/4 Two-Seater and Four-Seater]]\n* 1950\u20131969 [[Morgan +4|Plus 4]]\n* 1964\u20131967 [[Morgan +4+|Plus 4 Plus]]\n* 1965-1967 [[Morgan +4#Competition use|Morgan +4 Competition two seater]]\n* 1968\u20132004 (and 2012\u201319) [[Morgan Plus 8|Plus 8]]\n* 1985\u20132000 [[Morgan +4|Plus 4]]\n* 2001\u20132009 [[Morgan Aero 8|Aero 8]]\n* 2004\u20132012 [[Morgan Roadster|V6 Roadster]]\n* 2005\u2013present [[Morgan +4|Plus 4]]\n* 2006\u2013pending [[Morgan LIFEcar]]\n* 2008\u20132009 [[Morgan Aero 8|AeroMax]]\n* 2009\u2013present [[Morgan 4/4 Sport]]\n* 2010\u20132015 [[Morgan Aero 8|Aero SuperSports]]\n* 2010\u2013cancelled [[Morgan Eva GT]]\n* 2011\u2013cancelled [[Morgan Plus E]]\n* 2011\u20132012 [[Morgan Plus 4 Supersports]]\n* 2011\u2013present [[Morgan Anniversary 4/4]]\n* 2012\u20132015 [[Morgan Aero 8|Aero Coupe]]\n* 2012\u2013present [[Morgan 3-Wheeler]]\n* 2012\u201319 [[Morgan Aero 8]]\n* 2012\u2013present [[Morgan Roadster|Roadster 3.7]]\n* 2015\u201319 [[Morgan Aero 8]]\n* 2018 Morgan EV3<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.morgan-motor.co.uk/ev3/|title=EV3|publisher=|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref>\n* 2019\u2013present [[Morgan Plus Six]]\n\n== Motorsports ==\nMorgan cars can be found in many areas of motorsport, from club and historic racing to more prominent examples, including the Le Mans 24hr race.

Morgan quit the [[Great Western Railway]] in 1904 and co-founded a motor sales and servicing garage in Malvern Link. In 1909 he designed and built a car for his own use.

Production of three wheelers approached 1000 by WW1 and quickly resumed with both racing and touring models. Morgan's first four wheeler came in 1935 with three wheelers phased out in 1952.

Production halted again in 1950 when the Standard engine ceased to be available, but resumed in 1955 when a suitable replacement, the side-valve 1,172 cc Ford 100E engine was found, and has continued ever since.\n\nThe 4/4 now uses the +8 chassis and a Ford engine.\n\n=== Morgan +8 ===\n{{main|Morgan Plus 8}}\nFaced with the decreasing availability of large four-cylinder engines for use in their +4 models, Morgan began to install the recently available [[Rover V8 engine]] in their cars in 1968, giving these cars the model designation \"+8\".\n\nThe engine displacement jumped from the 2.3&nbsp;L of the Triumph TR4 engine to 3.5&nbsp;L, then 3.9&nbsp;L (1990), 4.0 (1998\u20132004) with an optional 4.6L (1996\u20132000) all based on the same Land Rover block. However, this V-8 was no heavier than the Triumph engine. These features made the +8 accelerate much more quickly than the early +4 and also improved its road-holding capability.\n\nHorsepower (143\u2013204&nbsp;bhp), weight and performance varied with emission and structural laws through its history. Thus powered, the car could accelerate from 0\u201360 mph in 5.6 seconds. In its final form, the GEMS Land Rover V8 produced {{convert|190|hp|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[File:2006 SAG - Morgan roadster - 05.jpg|thumb|Roadster at 76e international Motorshow Geneva 2006]]\n\n=== Roadster ===\n{{main|Morgan Roadster}}\nIn 2004, Morgan came out with a traditional styled model to replace the departing Plus 8. The Mk I Roadsters with the Ford UK Mondeo V6 produced 223&nbsp;bhp (166&nbsp;kW, 226 PS) at 6150 rev/min. It had a [[Magna PT|Getrag]] gearbox with direct drive in 5th with a 3.08 axle ratio. Later Marks had a Ford gearbox with direct drive in 4th with a 3.73 axle ratio. The overall gearing is virtually the same. The later Roadsters were powered by a Ford UK Mondeo V6 producing {{convert|204|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. In 2007, the Mondeo engine was replaced by a US-specification version of the same engine in the Roadster II. In 2011\u201312, the engine was replaced by the 3.7 Duratec Cyclone engine and output increased to {{convert|280|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.

(Contrary to popular myth, however, the [[chassis]] is metal; [[aluminium]] for the Aero 8.) The Aero 8, with a [[BMW]] [[V8 engine]] in a car weighing less than a [[BMW Z4]] and considerably less than a [[BMW M3]], (though more than traditional Morgans) is even faster than the Plus 8, delivering what ''[[Autoweek]]'' magazine termed [[supercar]] performance. The newest Aero 8 (series V), presented in March 2015, puts out {{convert|367|hp|abbr=on}} at 6100 rpm with the company suggesting a top speed of over {{convert|170|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Due to the Aero 8's light weight it can do 0\u201362&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h) in 4.5 seconds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seriouswheels.com/cars/top-2006-Morgan-Aeromax.htm |title=2006 Morgan Aeromax |publisher=Seriouswheels.com |date= |accessdate=17 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nDuring its customer production lifetime (2002\u20132009), the Aero was configured in five official versions, (I, II, III, IV, the Aero America and V) with mild variations in styling, engines, transmissions, braking and suspension. The company canceled the model in 2009 but relaunched it in 2015 for 2016 deliveries. The year of highest production for any Aero variation was 2002.\n\n=== Morgan AeroMax ===\n[[File:Morgan-Aeromax-rear.jpg|thumb|Morgan AeroMax, showing distinct boat tail rear]]\n{{main|Morgan Aero 8}}\nThe Aero was followed by the Aeromax, a limited edition of 100 units produced between 2008 and early 2010. The Aeromax was a coup\u00e9 variation of the Aero 8. Customers have included [[Richard Hammond]], [[Rowan Atkinson]] and [[Paul O'Grady]].\n\n=== Morgan Aero SuperSports ===\n{{main|Morgan Aero 8}}\nThe Morgan Aero SuperSports is a [[Targa top|targa-roofed]] version of the AeroMax, sharing its bonded aluminium chassis and lower bodywork with the coupe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/CarReviews/FirstDrives/Morgan-Aero-Supersports-V8-Supersports-auto/251830/|title=Morgan Aero 8 Review (2017) \u2013 Autocar|website=www.autocar.co.uk|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref> It was launched at the 2009 Pebble Beach car show in California.

The Eva GT would use [[BMW N54]] twin-turbo straight-6 producing 302&nbsp;bhp, Euro-6 emissions compliant. Shown at Pebble Beach in clay in 2010 and expected to go on sale in 2012, deposits have been taken since 2010. At the end of 2011, Morgan announced that it would use new magnesium technology for the body and therefore it would not be represented until 2014 with deliveries after that. In 2013 dealers confirmed that the EvaGT had been cancelled.\n\n=== {{Visible anchor|Morgan 3-Wheeler}} ===\n{{main|Morgan 3-Wheeler}}\n[[File:2012 US-spec Morgan 3-wheeler.jpg|thumb|Morgan 3-wheeler (2012)]]\n\nThe Morgan Motor Company announced that they would launch the \"3&nbsp;Wheeler\" in 2011<ref name=\"EIL20101104\">{{cite news| title = 2011 Morgan Threewheeler| url = http://www.insideline.com/morgan/2011-morgan-threewheeler.html| magazine = Edmunds Inside Line| publisher = Edmunds Inc.| date = 4 November 2010 | accessdate = 19 February 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Car20101103\">{{cite news| title = Morgan 3&nbsp;Wheeler (2011) first official pictures| first = Sarah-Jayne| last = Harrison | url = http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/News/Search-Results/First-Official-Pictures/Morgan-going-back-to-their-roots/| magazine = Car Magazine| publisher = Bauer Media| location = Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, UK| date = 3 November 2010| accessdate = 19 February 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"AE20101104\">{{cite news| title=Morgan revives the Threewheeler| first=Tom| last=Phillips| url=http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/news/autoexpressnews/259048/morgan_revives_the_threewheeler.html| magazine=Auto Express| publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]| location=London| date=4 November 2010| accessdate=19 February 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"AW20101103\">{{cite news| title=Morgan Threewheeler returns after 58-year break| first=Brad| last=Constant| url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20101103/CARNEWS/101109946| magazine=Autoweek| publisher=Crain Communications| location=Detroit| date=11 March 2010| accessdate=19 February 2011| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311062516/http://www.autoweek.com/article/20101103/CARNEWS/101109946| archive-date=11 March 2012| url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.topgearhk.com/2019/03/29/morgan-3-wheeler%EF%BC%882012%E5%B9%B4%E5%9E%8B%EF%BC%89%E9%99%B8%E5%9C%B0%E9%9B%99%E7%BF%BC%E6%A9%9F/|title=Morgan 3 Wheeler car review \u2013 TopGearhk|website=www.topgearhk|accessdate=29 Mar 2019}}</ref> at the [[Geneva Motor Show]].<ref name=\"Car20101103\" /><ref name=\"AE20101104\" /> The 3&nbsp;Wheeler was initially said to have a [[Harley-Davidson]] ''Screaming Eagle'' V-twin engine and a [[Mazda]] 5-speed manual transmission,<ref name= \"EIL20101104\" /><ref name=\"Car20101103\" /><ref name=\"AE20101104\" /><ref name=\"AW20101103\" /><ref name= \"WR20101103\">{{cite news| title=First Look: 2011 Morgan Threewheeler| first=Seyth| last=Miersma| url= http://www.windingroad.com/articles/news/first-look-2011-morgan-threewheeler/| magazine=Winding Road| location= Ypsilanti, Michigan, US| date=3 November 2010| accessdate=19 February 2011}}</ref> and was estimated to deliver {{cvt|115|hp|kW|0}}<ref name=\"EIL20101104\" /><ref name=\"AE20101104\" /><ref name=\"AW20101103\" /><ref name= \"WR20101103\" /> at the rear wheel.<ref name=\"AW20101103\" /><ref name=\"WR20101103\" /> However, the prototype that was shown at Geneva had an [[S&S Cycle|S&S]] engine.

This was the first time in 10 years that Morgan had had a presence at the largest of the American car shows and was the first US specification Morgan 3-Wheeler in the United States. The Morgan 3 Wheeler was voted one of the \"Hottest Cars Of The Show\" by G4TV.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hardiman|first=Paul |website=Hagerty.com |title=The New Morgan Three Wheeler|url=http://www.hagerty.com/articles-videos/Articles/2012/11/12/TheNew-2012-Morgan|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2012, Manhattan Motorsports took delivery of Charles Morgan's Superdry edition Morgan 3-Wheeler and prepared it for its first major American trial. This vehicle was driven across the States, from New York to Los Angeles by Charles Morgan and his wife, covering 3000 miles, in the [[Gumball 3000]]. At the end of the seven-day drive, the Morgan 3 Wheeler was awarded the \"Spirit of Gumball\" prize.\n\n== General characteristics ==\n[[File:MorganSuspension.jpg|thumb|Traditional Morgan [[sliding pillar suspension]]]]\nIn spite of their traditional design, Morgans have always had sporting or \"sports car\" performance, due to their extremely low weight.\n\nAmong their enthusiasts, Morgans are affectionately known as \"Moggies\".\n\n=== Suspension ===\nH.F.S. Morgan's 1909 runabout used [[sliding pillar suspension]], an [[independent front suspension]] system with each front wheel mounted on a stub axle able to slide up and down a fixed pillar that also acts as the [[kingpin (automotive part)|kingpin]] and supported by a spring and external shock absorber (damper). One advantage is reduced unsprung weight, theoretically allowing the tyre and wheel to better respond to road surface irregularities. The Morgan system is described as an 'inverted' sliding pillar, as the pillar is fixed and the hub carrier slides over it. Earlier systems had the wheel carried on the pillar, sliding through a bush on the axle.\n\nMorgan used developments of this suspension system throughout its existence, and it is still used on Morgan's \"classic\" line, although not on the Aero 8 or its derivatives. It has been cancelled, along with all the Morgan Classic line, in 2019. However, some \"classics\", shipped in parts to avoid the need for normal compliancy, will be shipped to the USA, and assembled there for an indefinite period.\n\n== Models ==\n* 1909 Runabout\n* 1911\u20131939 [[V-Twin 3-wheeler]]\n* 1932\u20131952 [[F-Series 3-wheeler]]\n* 1936\u2013present [[Morgan 4/4|4/4 Two-Seater and Four-Seater]]\n* 1950\u20131969 [[Morgan +4|Plus 4]]\n* 1964\u20131967 [[Morgan +4+|Plus 4 Plus]]\n* 1965-1967 [[Morgan +4#Competition use|Morgan +4 Competition two seater]]\n* 1968\u20132004 (and 2012\u201319) [[Morgan Plus 8|Plus 8]]\n* 1985\u20132000 [[Morgan +4|Plus 4]]\n* 2001\u20132009 [[Morgan Aero 8|Aero 8]]\n* 2004\u20132012 [[Morgan Roadster|V6 Roadster]]\n* 2005\u2013present [[Morgan +4|Plus 4]]\n* 2006\u2013pending [[Morgan LIFEcar]]\n* 2008\u20132009 [[Morgan Aero 8|AeroMax]]\n* 2009\u2013present [[Morgan 4/4 Sport]]\n* 2010\u20132015 [[Morgan Aero 8|Aero SuperSports]]\n* 2010\u2013cancelled [[Morgan Eva GT]]\n* 2011\u2013cancelled [[Morgan Plus E]]\n* 2011\u20132012 [[Morgan Plus 4 Supersports]]\n* 2011\u2013present [[Morgan Anniversary 4/4]]\n* 2012\u20132015 [[Morgan Aero 8|Aero Coupe]]\n* 2012\u2013present [[Morgan 3-Wheeler]]\n* 2012\u201319 [[Morgan Aero 8]]\n* 2012\u2013present [[Morgan Roadster|Roadster 3.7]]\n* 2015\u201319 [[Morgan Aero 8]]\n* 2018 Morgan EV3<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.morgan-motor.co.uk/ev3/|title=EV3|publisher=|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref>\n* 2019\u2013present [[Morgan Plus Six]]\n\n== Motorsports ==\nMorgan cars can be found in many areas of motorsport, from club and historic racing to more prominent examples, including the Le Mans 24hr race.

The call brings up bad memories from his disastrous appearance there seven years earlier. It scares him to the point where he cannot sing at rehearsal. Everyone panics thinking he is losing his voice.\n\nHis business manager, Henry Pollack, has a throat specialist Pamela Taylor, look at Giorgio. He at first refuses her, believing her not to be a doctor, but \"a nurse\" because she is a woman. After being scared into seeing her by his manager, she immediately detects that the problem is psychological, not physical. Pamela makes up a serious-sounding name for the condition and gives Giorgio a shot to cure it, which she reveals to Henry is harmless vitamin B12. After reacting to the prick of the needle, Giorgio instantly gets his voice back and proceeds to sing the following day at the [[Hatch Shell]] in Boston.\n\nGiorgio is immediately physically attracted to Pamela, and even though he is married with two children, she agrees to go out on a dinner date. The date does not go well, but Giorgio is persistent, visiting the hospital where Pamela works. His quick thinking helps calm a scared child getting ready for surgery to remove his tonsils, promising ice cream which he delivers after the surgery.  Impressed by his handling of the children, she agrees to another date. She eventually becomes his traveling companion. After spending a romantic week in [[San Francisco]] and the wine country visiting friends of Giorgio, the two eventually fall in love, even though at the start of their relationship he told her this was just \"a fling\" and made her promise not to fall in love with him.  He gains the confidence through his love for her to agree to perform at the Met in the [[Giacomo Puccini]] opera ''[[Turandot]]''. However, because Giorgio refuses to leave his wife, Pamela throws him a kiss and leaves the Met while Giorgio is singing \"[[Nessun Dorma]]\" to her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Luciano Pavarotti]] as Giorgio Fini\n* [[Kathryn Harrold]] as Pamela Taylor\n* [[Eddie Albert]] as Henry Pollack\n* [[Paola Borboni]] as Sister Theresa\n* [[James Hong]] as Kwan\n* Beulah Quo as Mei Ling\n* Norman Steinberg as Dr. Barmen\n* Rod Colbin as Ted Mullane\n* Kathryn Fuller as Faye Kennedy\n* [[Joseph Mascolo]] as Dominic Giordano\n* [[Karen Kondazian]] as Francesca Giordano\n* [[Leona Mitchell]] as Herself\n* [[Kurt Herbert Adler]] as Himself\n* [[Emerson Buckley]] as Himself\n* [[Alexander Courage]] as Conductor, ''Turandot''\n\n==Production==\nIn June 1980 MGM announced they had signed a deal with Pavarotti to star in the movie. \"I have done a lot of television and think I have the experience to do a movie,\" said the singer. \"I will put myself in the hands of those making this but hopefully my sense of humor will come through.<ref name=\"los\">LIGHTS, CAMERA...

The call brings up bad memories from his disastrous appearance there seven years earlier. It scares him to the point where he cannot sing at rehearsal. Everyone panics thinking he is losing his voice.\n\nHis business manager, Henry Pollack, has a throat specialist Pamela Taylor, look at Giorgio. He at first refuses her, believing her not to be a doctor, but \"a nurse\" because she is a woman. After being scared into seeing her by his manager, she immediately detects that the problem is psychological, not physical. Pamela makes up a serious-sounding name for the condition and gives Giorgio a shot to cure it, which she reveals to Henry is harmless vitamin B12. After reacting to the prick of the needle, Giorgio instantly gets his voice back and proceeds to sing the following day at the [[Hatch Shell]] in Boston.\n\nGiorgio is immediately physically attracted to Pamela, and even though he is married with two children, she agrees to go out on a dinner date. The date does not go well, but Giorgio is persistent, visiting the hospital where Pamela works. His quick thinking helps calm a scared child getting ready for surgery to remove his tonsils, promising ice cream which he delivers after the surgery.  Impressed by his handling of the children, she agrees to another date. She eventually becomes his traveling companion. After spending a romantic week in [[San Francisco]] and the wine country visiting friends of Giorgio, the two eventually fall in love, even though at the start of their relationship he told her this was just \"a fling\" and made her promise not to fall in love with him.  He gains the confidence through his love for her to agree to perform at the Met in the [[Giacomo Puccini]] opera ''[[Turandot]]''. However, because Giorgio refuses to leave his wife, Pamela throws him a kiss and leaves the Met while Giorgio is singing \"[[Nessun Dorma]]\" to her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Luciano Pavarotti]] as Giorgio Fini\n* [[Kathryn Harrold]] as Pamela Taylor\n* [[Eddie Albert]] as Henry Pollack\n* [[Paola Borboni]] as Sister Theresa\n* [[James Hong]] as Kwan\n* Beulah Quo as Mei Ling\n* Norman Steinberg as Dr. Barmen\n* Rod Colbin as Ted Mullane\n* Kathryn Fuller as Faye Kennedy\n* [[Joseph Mascolo]] as Dominic Giordano\n* [[Karen Kondazian]] as Francesca Giordano\n* [[Leona Mitchell]] as Herself\n* [[Kurt Herbert Adler]] as Himself\n* [[Emerson Buckley]] as Himself\n* [[Alexander Courage]] as Conductor, ''Turandot''\n==Production==\nIn June 1980 MGM announced they had signed a deal with Pavarotti to star in the movie. \"I have done a lot of television and think I have the experience to do a movie,\" said the singer. \"I will put myself in the hands of those making this but hopefully my sense of humor will come through.<ref name=\"los\">LIGHTS, CAMERA...

He flew [[Nakajima B5N]] torpedo bomber from carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier S\u014dry\u016b|''S\u014dry\u016b'']] during the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]], the [[Indian Ocean Raid]] and the [[Battle of Midway]]. He was shot down during the [[Solomon Islands Campaign]] while flying from carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Jun'y\u014d|''Jun'y\u014d'']] but survived the crash and was eventually evacuated to Japan.\n\n==Early career==\nJ\u016bz\u014d Mori was born in on 9 February 1917 in a small town in [[Saitama Prefecture]] to a poor farmer family. He wanted to become a teacher but the family could not afford the entrance fee for the school. He then moved to [[Tokyo]] to live with his uncle. He found him a job in the department store, while at the same time he attended a night school. However, in January 1935 his father died and he was forced to return to his home town in order to support the family. In August he noticed a navy recruiting poster and decided to join the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. He passed the entrance test in January 1936 but almost failed the physical exam as his chest measurement was to small. He enlisted the navy as a navy and in June left for [[Yokosuka]] naval base to start the basic training. In November he transferred to [[Lake Kasumigaura|Kasumigaura]] Training Naval Air Station (NAS) near [[Tokyo]] to begin pilot training. He graduated from the 38th class in 1938 and specialized for torpedo bombing.\n\nIn April 1938, Mori was assigned to the 12th Air Group based near [[Nanjing]] in [[Central China]]. He flew [[Aichi D1A]] bomber and participated in various operations along [[Yangtze River]]. In September, the unit transitioned to the new [[Nakajima B5N]] bombers. During one of the September mission on near [[Jiujiang]], Mori experienced an engine failure in the new aircraft and was forced to land in a nearby field controlled by [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. In November, while flying a mission from [[Hankou]], his B5N ran out of fuel due to a problem and he again was forced to land in a field near [[Yangtze River]]. This time he and his crew ended up in enemy territory but they were rescued the next day. He left China in December 1938 and in January 1939 he was transferred back to [[Lake Kasumigaura|Kasumigaura]] NAS to serve as an instructor. In May he was promoted to [[Petty Officer Third Class]].\n\nIn September 1941 he was transferred to carrier ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier S\u014dry\u016b|S\u014dry\u016b]]'' and started the training in preparation for the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]].\n\n==Pacific War==\nDuring the Attack on Pearl Harbor, Petty Officer Mori was part of the first wave. As his division of [[Nakajima B5N]] torpedo bombers they reached the harbor they lined up to attack the [[United States Navy]] (USN) battleship row. However, his division leader lined them up on a cruiser instead of a battleship. Mori realized the error before relasing the torpedo and and went around for another pass. He then lined up on a battleship [[USS California (BB-44)|California]] and hit it with his torpedo.\n\nPetty Officer Mori was not directly involved in the [[Attack on Darwin]] since he was assigned to a patrol duty in the vicinity of INJ carriers.\n\nOn the return journey from Pearl Harbor, the Second Carrier Division (consisting of carriers ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiry\u016b|Hiry\u016b]]'' and ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier S\u014dry\u016b|S\u014dry\u016b]]'') was detached to assist in [[Battle of Wake Island|capturing]] of [[Wake Island]]. On 22 December, Petty Officer Mori and his group of B5N level bombers attacked artillery emplacements and fortifications on the island. The next day, they flew again to support the landings on the islands. When he arrived to the island, the defence already garrison surrendered as he noticed the white flag flying above their headquarters. However, while flying around the islands, one of the rouge AA emplacements opened fire and hit his fuel tank. Infuriated about it, he considered doping the remaining bombs on their position, however, he decided not risk running out of fuel and returned to the IJN fleet instead.\n\nIn April 1942, Petty Officer Mori participated in [[Indian Ocean Raid]]. He was not directly involved in actions on 5 April as he was part of a reserve force waiting on the carriers. However, on 9 April he was part of strike against [[Trincomalee]] military harbor on [[Ceylon]]. His B5N was equipped with a 800 kilogram bomb and his division performed a low-level bombing attack on hrabor installation. On their back, they encountered a [[Supermarine Spitfire]] and evaded it by hiding into a cloud before safely returning to the carrier.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Midway]] on 4 June 1942, Petty Officer Mori was part of the strike force against the USN airfield and installations on [[Midway Atoll]]. His B5N was equipped with a 800 kilogram bomb for level bombing. On the way to the atoll, they were intercepted by a large group of Midway-based [[United States Marines|Marine]] fighters (six [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]]s and 20 [[Brewster F2A Buffalo]]s) led by Major [[Floyd B. Parks]]. His aircraft was attacked by the Marine fighters, however the escorting [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]]s drove them away. Mori and his division of six level bombers attacked the Midway airfield. Four bombs landed and detonated on the runway, while two of them missed and hit the forest nearby. However, those two bombs appeared to have hit AA emplacement and ammo depot, since they cause a series of secondary explosions. After the attack he headed back to IJN fleet where he witnessed the unsuccessful attack on IJN carriers by the Midway-based [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] high-altitude bombers on [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiry\u016b|''Hiry\u016b'']] and [[Douglas TBD Devastator]] torpedo bombers on ''S\u014dry\u016b''. He landed on ''S\u014dry\u016b'', which was preparing its [[Aichi D3A]] dive bombers for a strike against USN carrier detected in the North-East. However, before the preparation could be finished, ''S\u014dry\u016b'' was hit and set her ablaze by three bombs dropped by dive bombers of [[USS Yorktown (CV-5)|''Yorktown'']] led by [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Max Leslie]]. Mori was in the ready room at the time of attack and had to fight through the smoke and fire to reach the deck of the carrier. As the fires intensified, he had to jump 60 from the deck into the sea and was eventually picked up by destroyer [[Japanese destroyer Makigumo (1941)|Makigumo]].\n\nAfter the Battle of Midway, Petty Officer Mori was transferred to the new carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Jun'y\u014d|''Jun'y\u014d'']], which sailed from Japan to Guadalcanal in early October 1942. On 16 October, He participated in the hastily organized and ill-fated air strike to attack enemy position around [[Lunga Point]] on [[Guadalcanal]]. The strike consisted of 18 B5N bombers (equipped with 800 kilogram bombs) and 18 Zero fighters, under over all command of Lieutenant Commander [[Yoshio Shiga]]. [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiy\u014d|''Hiy\u014d'']] bombers were led by Lieutenant Yoshiaki Irikiin, while ''Jun'y\u014d'' bombers were led by inexperienced Lieutenant Tadao It\u014d. As they approached Lunga Point, It\u014d broke off the bombing run of the entire ''Jun'y\u014d'' group in order to make another attempt, which infuriated Mori. During the second attempt the group was ambushed by numerous Wildcat fighters from [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]]. In the attack three ''Hiy\u014d'' bombers were shot down and three were damaged, while six ''Jun'y\u014d'' bombers were shot down and 2 were damaged. The escorting Zeros claimed several Wildcats, however ''Hiy\u014d'' ace [[Kaname Harada]] was wounded and had to ditch at [[Rekata Bay]]. Petty Officer Mori lost his right hand and was forced to ditch his bomber in the water near [[Cape Esperance]]. He then endured starvation on [[Guadalcanal]] before being evacuated to [[Truk]] in November.\n\n==Later life==\nAs a result of the injury, Mori was discharged from the navy and survived the war. He later opened a bar near [[Nishi-Ogikubo Station]] in Tokyo, where he also worked as the bartender.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n; Sources\n* {{cite book \n |last=\u68ee\n |first=\u62fe\u4e09\n |year=2004\n |edition=new\n |language=Japanese\n |title=\u5947\u8e5f\u306e\u96f7\u6483\u968a\u2015\u3042\u308b\u96f7\u6483\u6a5f\u64cd\u7e26\u54e1\u306e\u751f\u9084\n |publisher=\u5149\u4eba\u793e\n |location= \n |isbn=476982064X\n}}\n\n* {{cite book \n |last=Mori\n |first=J\u016bz\u014d\n |year=2015\n |translator= Nicholas Voge\n |title=The Miraculous Torpedo Squadron\n |publisher=\n |location= \n |isbn=\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mori, J\u016bz\u014d}}\n[[Category:1917 births]]\n[[Category:Japanese naval aviators]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=April 2020}}\n\n{{Infobox military person\n|name= J\u016bz\u014d Mori\n|birth_date={{Birth date|df=y|1917|2|9}}\n|death_date=\n|birth_place=[[Saitama Prefecture]], [[Empire of Japan]]\n|death_place=\n|image=\n|caption=\n|nickname= \n|allegiance= [[Empire of Japan]]\n|branch= [[File:Naval Ensign of Japan.svg|22x20px|border]] [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] ([[Imperial Japanese Navy|IJN]])\n|serviceyears=\n|rank= [[Petty Officer]]\n|commands=\n|unit= 12th Air Group<br/>''[[Japanese aircraft carrier S\u014dry\u016b|S\u014dry\u016b]]''<br/>[[Japanese aircraft carrier Jun'y\u014d|''Jun'y\u014d'']]\n|battles='''[[World War II]]:'''<br/>[[Second Sino-Japanese War]]<br/>[[Attack on Pearl Harbor]]<br/>[[Indian Ocean Raid]]<br/>[[Battle of Midway]]<br/>[[Solomon Islands Campaign]]\n|awards= \n|laterwork=\n}}\n{{Japanese name|Mori}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''J\u016bz\u014d Mori'''|\u68ee \u62fe\u4e09|Mori J\u016bz\u014d|}} was a [[torpedo bomber]] pilot in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) during [[World War II]].

The term ''scrum'' was chosen by the paper's authors because it emphasizes teamwork.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dzone.com/articles/scrum-whats-in-a-name|title=Scrum, What's in a Name? - DZone Agile|website=dzone.com}}</ref>\n\n''Scrum'' is occasionally seen written in all-capitals, as ''SCRUM''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stackoverflow.com/q/6389423 |title=Should \"SCRUM\" be written in all caps?|website=stackoverflow.com|access-date=January 10, 2017}}</ref> The word is not an [[acronym]], so this stylization is not correct; it likely arose due to an early paper by Ken Schwaber<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schwaber|first=Ken|title=Scrum.org Ken Schwaber|url=https://www.scrum.org/team/ken-schwaber}}</ref> which capitalized ''SCRUM'' in its title.<ref name=\"schwaber\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schwaber|first=Ken|year=2004|title=SCRUM Development Process|url=http://www.jeffsutherland.org/oopsla/schwapub.pdf|journal=Advanced Development Methods}}</ref> \n\nWhile the [[trademark]] on the term ''Scrum'' itself has been allowed to lapse, it is deemed as owned by the wider community rather than an individual,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agilelearninglabs.com/2011/01/scrummaster-vs-scrum-master/|title=ScrumMaster vs scrum master: What do you think?|last=Johnson|first=Hillary Louise|date=January 13, 2011|website=agilelearninglabs.com|access-date=May 10, 2017}}</ref> so the leading capital for ''Scrum'' is retained in this article.\n\nMany of the terms used in Scrum are typically written with leading capitals (e.g., ''Scrum Master'', ''Daily Scrum'').

Henry and S. Henry. Quantitative assessment of the software maintenance process and requirements volatility. In Proc. of the ACM Conference on Computer Science, pages 346\u2013351, 1993.</ref>) and that there will be unpredictable challenges\u2014for which a predictive or planned approach is not suited. \n\nAs such, Scrum adopts an evidence-based [[Empirical process|empirical approach]] \u2013 accepting that the problem cannot be fully understood or defined up front, and instead focusing on how to maximize the team's ability to deliver quickly, to respond to emerging requirements, and to adapt to evolving technologies and changes in market conditions.\n\n== History ==\n\n[[Hirotaka Takeuchi]] and [[Ikujiro Nonaka]] introduced the term ''scrum'' in the context of [[New product development|product development]] in their 1986 ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' article, 'The New New Product Development Game'.<ref name=\"TakeuchiNonaka\">{{Cite journal|last1=Takeuchi|first1=Hirotaka|last2=Nonaka|first2=Ikujiro|date=January 1, 1986|title=The New New Product Development Game|url=https://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/86116-PDF-ENG|journal=Harvard Business Review|volume=|pages=|accessdate=June 9, 2010|quote=Moving the Scrum Downfield|via=}}</ref> Takeuchi and Nonaka later argued in ''The Knowledge Creating Company''<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B-qxrPaU1-MC&dq=The+Knowledge+Creating+Company&printsec=frontcover|title= The Knowledge Creating Company|publisher= Oxford University Press|page= 3|year= 1995|accessdate= March 12, 2013|isbn= 9780199762330}}</ref> that it is a form of \"organizational knowledge creation, [...] especially good at bringing about innovation continuously, incrementally and spirally\".\n\nThe authors described a new approach to commercial product development that would increase speed and flexibility, based on case studies from manufacturing firms in the automotive, photocopier and printer [[economic sector|industries]].<ref name=\"TakeuchiNonaka\" /> They called this the [[holistic]] or [[Rugby football|rugby]] approach, as the whole process is performed by one [[cross-functional team]] across multiple overlapping phases, in which the team \"tries to go the distance as a unit, passing the ball back and forth\".<ref name=\"TakeuchiNonaka\" /> (In [[rugby football]], a [[scrum (rugby)|scrum]] is used to restart play, as the forwards of each team interlock with their heads down and attempt to gain possession of the ball.<ref>{{Oxford&nbsp;Dictionaries|Scrum}}</ref>)\n\nThe Scrum framework was based on research by Schwaber with Tunde Babatunde at DuPont Research Station and University of Delaware. Tunde advised that attempts to develop complex products, such as software, that weren't based in empiricism were doomed to higher risks and rates of failure as the initial conditions and assumptions change. Empiricism, using frequent inspection and adaptation, with flexibility and transparency is the most suitable approach.\n\nIn the early 1990s, [[Ken Schwaber]] used what would become Scrum at his company, Advanced Development Methods; while [[Jeff Sutherland]], John Scumniotales and Jeff McKenna developed a similar approach at Easel Corporation, referring to it using the single word scrum.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url= https://www.scrumalliance.org/resource_download/35|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20171122013020/https://www.scrumalliance.org/resource_download/35|archivedate= November 22, 2017|format= PDF|title= Agile Development: Lessons learned from the first Scrum|last= Sutherland|first= Jeff|authorlink= Jeff Sutherland|date= October 2004|accessdate= September 26, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nKen and Jeff worked together to integrate their ideas into a single framework, Scrum.

Therefore a good product owner should be able to communicate what the business needs, ask why they need it (because there may be better ways to achieve that), and convey the message to all stakeholders including the Development Team using a technical language, as required. \n\nCommunication is a core responsibility of the product owner. The ability to convey priorities and empathize with team members and stakeholders is vital to steer product development in the right direction. The product owner role bridges the communication gap between the team and its stakeholders, serving as a proxy for stakeholders to the team and as a team representative to the overall stakeholder community.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Agile Product Management with Scrum: Creating Products that Customers Love|last=Pichler|first=Roman|date=March 11, 2010|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|isbn=978-0-321-68413-4|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://agilemodeling.com/essays/productOwner.htm|title= The Product Owner Role: A Stakeholder Proxy for Agile Teams|last= Ambler|first= Scott|publisher= agilemodeling.com|access-date= July 22, 2016 |  quote =  [...] in practice there proves to be two critical aspects to this role: first as a stakeholder proxy within the development team and second as a project team representative to the overall stakeholder community as a whole.}}</ref>\n\nAs the face of the team to the stakeholders, the following are some of the communication tasks of the product owner to the stakeholders:<ref>{{cite web|title=The Product Owner Role|url=http://scrum-master.thinkific.com/pages/the-product-owner-role|website=Scrum Master Test Prep|accessdate=February 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\n* Define and announce releases.\n* Communicate delivery and team status.\n* Share progress during governance meetings.\n* Share significant RIDAs (risks, impediments, dependencies, and assumptions) with stakeholders.\n* Negotiate priorities, scope, funding, and schedule.\n* Ensure that the product backlog is visible, transparent and clear.\n\nEmpathy is a key attribute for a product owner to have\u2014the ability to put one's self in another's shoes. A product owner converses with different stakeholders, who have a variety of backgrounds, job roles, and objectives. A product owner must be able to see from these different points of view. To be effective, it is wise for a product owner to know the level of detail the audience needs. The development team needs thorough feedback and specifications so they can build a product up to expectation, while an executive sponsor may just need summaries of progress. Providing more information than necessary may lose stakeholder interest and waste time. A direct means of communication is the most preferred by seasoned agile product owners.<ref name=\":1\">Cohn, Mike. Succeeding with Agile: Software Development Using Scrum. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Addison-Wesley, 2010.</ref>\n\nA product owner's ability to communicate effectively is also enhanced by being skilled in techniques that identify stakeholder needs, negotiate priorities between stakeholder interests, and collaborate with developers to ensure effective implementation of requirements.\n\n=== Development team ===\n\nThe development team has from three to nine members who carry out all tasks required to build increments of valuable output every sprint.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nWhile team members are referred to as ''developers'' in some literature<ref name=\"scrumguide\" />, the term refers to anyone who plays a role in the development and support of the system or product, and can include researchers, architects, designers, data specialists, statisticians, analysts, engineers, programmers, and testers, among others.<ref name=\":2\" /> However, due to the confusion that can arise when some people do not feel the term 'developer' applies to them, they are often referred to just as ''team members''. \n\nThe team is self-organizing. While no work should come to the team except through the product owner, and the scrum master is expected to protect the team from too much distraction, the team should still be encouraged to interact directly with customers and/or stakeholders to gain maximum understanding and immediacy of feedback.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Scrum master ===\n\nScrum is facilitated by a scrum master, who is accountable for removing impediments to the ability of the team to deliver the product goals and deliverables.<ref>Carroll, N, O\u2019Connor, M. and Edison, H.

The scrum master ensures that the scrum framework is followed. The scrum master helps to ensure the team follows the agreed processes in the Scrum framework, often facilitates key sessions, and encourages the team to improve.

Product backlog items may be broken into multiple smaller ones. Acceptance criteria may be clarified. Dependencies may be identified and investigated.\n\nAlthough not originally a core Scrum practice, backlog refinement has been added to the Scrum Guide and adopted as a way of managing the quality of product backlog items entering a sprint, with a recommended investment of up to 10% of a team's sprint capacity.<ref name=\"scrumguide\" /><ref>{{cite book|last=Cho|first=L|title=Adopting an Agile Culture A User Experience Team's Journey|journal=Agile Conference|year=2009|doi=10.1109/AGILE.2009.76|isbn=978-0-7695-3768-9|pages=416\u2013421}}</ref>\n\nThe backlog can also include [[technical debt]] (also known as design debt or code debt). This is a concept in software development that reflects the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.\n\n=== Cancelling a sprint ===\n\nThe product owner can cancel a sprint if necessary.<ref name=\"scrumguide\" /> The product owner may do so with input from the team, scrum master or management. For instance, management may wish the product owner to cancel a sprint if external circumstances negate the value of the sprint goal. If a sprint is abnormally terminated, the next step is to conduct a new sprint planning, where the reason for the termination is reviewed.\n\n== Artifacts ==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2013}}\n\n=== Product backlog ===\n\nThe product backlog is a breakdown of work to be done<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sedano|first1=Todd|last2=Ralph|first2=Paul|last3=P\u00e9raire|first3=C\u00e9cile|title=The Product Backlog|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330823863_The_Product_Backlog|publisher=IEEE}}</ref> and contains an ordered list of [[Requirement|product requirements]] that a scrum team maintains for a [[New product development|product]]. Common formats include [[user story|user stories]] and [[use case]]s.<ref name=\"scrumprimer\" /> The requirements define [[Software feature|feature]]s, [[Patch (computing)|bug fix]]es, [[non-functional requirement]]s, etc.\u2014whatever must be done to deliver a viable product. The product owner prioritizes product backlog items (PBIs) based on considerations such as risk, business value, dependencies, size, and date needed.\n\nThe product backlog is what will be delivered, ordered into the sequence in which it should be delivered. It is visible to everyone but may only be changed with the consent of the product owner, who is ultimately responsible for ordering product backlog items for the development team to choose.\n\nThe product backlog contains the product owner's assessment of business value and the development team's assessment of development effort, which are often, but not always, stated in [[Planning poker|story points]] using the [[Fibonacci scale (agile)|rounded Fibonacci scale]]. These estimates help the product owner to gauge the timeline and may influence the ordering of product backlog items; for example, if two features have the same business value, the product owner may schedule earlier delivery of the one with the lower development effort (because the [[return on investment]] is higher) or the one with higher development effort (because it is more complex or riskier, and they want to retire that risk earlier).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.batimes.com/articles/authoring-requirements-in-an-agile-world.html|title= Authoring Requirements in an Agile World|publisher= BA Times|first= Tony|last= Higgins|date= March 31, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe product backlog and the business value of each product backlog item is the responsibility of the product owner. The effort to deliver each item is estimated by the development team in story points, or time. By estimating in story points, the team reduces the dependency in individual developers; this is useful especially in dynamic teams where developers are often assigned to other projects after sprint delivery. For instance, if a user story is estimated as a 5 in effort (using Fibonacci sequence), it remains 5 regardless of how many developers are working on it\n\nStory points define the effort in a time-box, so they do not change with time. For instance, in one hour an individual can walk, run, or climb, but the effort expended is clearly different. The gap progression between the terms in the Fibonacci sequence encourages the team to deliver carefully considered estimates. Estimates of 1, 2 or 3 imply similar efforts (1 being trivial), but if the team estimates an 8 or 13 (or higher), the impact on both delivery and budget can be significant. The value of using story points is that the team can reuse them by comparing similar work from previous sprints, but it should be recognized that estimates are relative to the team. For example, an estimate of 5 for one team could be a 2 for another having senior developers and higher skills.\n\nEvery team should have a product owner, although in many instances a product owner could work with more than one team.<ref name=\":1\" /> The product owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product. The product owner gathers input and takes feedback from, and is lobbied by, many people, but ultimately makes the call on what gets built.\n\nThe product backlog:\n\n* Captures requests to modify a product\u2014including new features, replacing old features, removing features, and fixing issues\n* Ensures the development team has work that maximizes business benefit to the product owner\n\nTypically, the product owner and the scrum team work together to develop the breakdown of work; this becomes the product backlog, which evolves as new information surfaces about the product and about its customers, and so later sprints may address new work.\n\n==== Management ====\n\nA product backlog, in its simplest form, is merely a list of items to work on. Having well-established rules about how work is added, removed and ordered helps the whole team make better decisions about how to change the product.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.atlassian.com/agile/backlogs|title=The product backlog: your ultimate to-do list|website=Atlassian|accessdate=July 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe product owner prioritizes product backlog items based on which are needed soonest. The team then chooses which items they can complete in the coming sprint. On the scrum board, the team moves items from the product backlog to the sprint backlog, which is the list of items they will build. Conceptually, it is ideal for the team to only select what they think they can accomplish from the top of the list, but it is not unusual to see in practice that teams are able to take lower-priority items from the list along with the top ones selected. This normally happens because there is time left within the sprint to accommodate more work. Items at the top of the backlog, the items to work on first, should be broken down into stories that are suitable for the development team to work on. The further down the backlog goes, the less refined the items should be. As Schwaber and Beedle put it \"The lower the priority, the less detail until you can barely make out the backlog item.\"<ref name=\"schwaber\" />\n\nAs the team works through the backlog, it must be assumed that change happens outside their environment\u2014the team can learn about new market opportunities to take advantage of, competitor threats that arise, and feedback from customers that can change the way the product was meant to work. All of these new ideas tend to trigger the team to adapt the backlog to incorporate new knowledge. This is part of the fundamental mindset of an agile team. The world changes, the backlog is never finished.<ref name=\"Pichler, Roman 2010\">Pichler, Roman. ''Agile Product Management with Scrum: Creating Products that Customers Love''.

The development team should keep in mind its past performance assessing its capacity for the new-sprint, and use this as a guideline of how much 'effort' they can complete.\n\nThe product backlog items may be broken down into tasks by the development team.<ref name=\"MartinelliMilosevic2016\" /> Tasks on the sprint backlog are never assigned (or pushed) to team members by someone else; rather team members sign up for (or pull) tasks as needed according to the backlog priority and their own skills and capacity. This promotes self-organization of the development team and developer buy-in.\n\nThe sprint backlog is the property of the development team, and all included estimates are provided by the development team. Often an accompanying task board is used to see and change the state of the tasks of the current sprint, like to do, in progress and done.\n\nOnce a sprint backlog is committed, no additional work can be added to the sprint backlog except by the team. Once a sprint has been delivered, the product backlog is analyzed and reprioritized if necessary, and the next set of functionality is selected for the next sprint.\n\n=== Increment ===\n\nThe ''increment'' is the potentially releasable output of the sprint that meets the sprint goal. It is formed from all the completed sprint backlog items, integrated with the work of all previous sprints. The increment must be complete, according to the scrum team's ''definition of done'' (DoD), fully functioning, and in a usable condition regardless of whether the product owner decides to actually deploy and use it.\n\n=== Extensions ===\n\nThe following artifacts and techniques can be used to help people use Scrum.<ref name=\"scrumguide\" />\n\n==== Sprint burndown chart ====\n\n[[File:SampleBurndownChart.svg|thumb|A sample burndown chart for a completed sprint, showing remaining effort at the end of each day.]]\n\n{{main|Burn down chart}}\n\nThe sprint burndown chart is a publicly displayed chart showing remaining work in the sprint backlog.<ref name=\"Cobb2015\">{{cite book|author=Charles G. Cobb|title=The Project Manager's Guide to Mastering Agile: Principles and Practices for an Adaptive Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vHjTBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA378|date=January 27, 2015|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-99104-6|page=378}}</ref> Updated every day, it gives a simple view of the sprint progress. It also provides quick visualizations for reference. The horizontal axis of the sprint burndown chart shows the days in a sprint, while the vertical axis shows the amount of work remaining each day (typically representing the estimate of hours of work remaining).\n\nDuring sprint planning, the ideal burndown chart is plotted. Then, during the sprint, each member picks up tasks from the sprint backlog and works on them. At the end of the day, they update the remaining hours for tasks to be completed. In such a way, the actual burndown chart is updated day by day.\n\nIt should not be confused with an [[earned value management|earned value chart]].\n\n==== Release burn-up chart ====\n\n[[File:SampleBurnupChart.png|thumb|A sample burn-up chart for a release, showing scope completed each sprint (MVP = Minimum Viable Product)]]\n\nThe release burn-up chart is a way for the team to provide visibility and track progress toward a release. Updated at the end of each sprint, it shows progress toward delivering a forecast scope. The horizontal axis of the release burn-up chart shows the sprints in a release, while the vertical axis shows the amount of work completed at the end of each sprint (typically representing cumulative story points of work completed). Progress is plotted as a line that grows up to meet a horizontal line that represents the forecast scope; often shown with a forecast, based on progress to date, that indicates how much scope might be completed by a given release date or how many sprints it will take to complete the given scope.\n\nThe release burn-up chart makes it easy to see how much work has been completed, how much work has been added or removed (if the horizontal scope line moves), and how much work is left to be done.\n\n==== Definition of ready (DoR) ====\nThe start criteria to determine whether the [[specification]]s and inputs are set enough to start the work item, i.e. a [[user story]].\n\n==== Definition of done (DoD) ====\nThe [[exit-criteria]] to determine whether a product backlog item is complete. In many cases, the DoD requires that all [[regression testing|regression tests]] be successful. The definition of done may vary from one scrum team to another but must be consistent within one team.<ref>Ken Schwaber, ''Agile Project Management with Scrum'', p.55</ref>\n\n==== Velocity ====\n\nThe total effort a team is capable of in a sprint. The number is derived by evaluating the work (typically in [[user story]] points) completed in the last sprint. The collection of historical velocity data is a guideline for assisting the team in understanding how much work they can likely achieve in a future sprint.\n\n==== Spike ====\n\nA time-boxed period used to research a concept or create a simple prototype. Spikes can either be planned to take place in between sprints or, for larger teams, a spike might be accepted as one of many sprint delivery objectives. Spikes are often introduced before the delivery of large or complex product backlog items in order to secure budget, expand knowledge, or produce a proof of concept. The duration and objective(s) of a spike is agreed between product owner and development team before the start. Unlike sprint commitments, spikes may or may not deliver tangible, shippable, valuable functionality. For example, the objective of a spike might be to successfully reach a decision on a course of action. The spike is over when the time is up, not necessarily when the objective has been delivered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/spike.html|title=Create a Spike Solution|publisher=Extreme Programming}}</ref>\n\n==== Tracer bullet ====\n\nAlso called a drone spike, a tracer bullet is a spike with the current architecture, current technology set, current set of best practices that result in production quality code. It might just be a very narrow implementation of the functionality but is not throwaway code. It is of production quality, and the rest of the iterations can build on this code. The name has military origins as [[Tracer ammunition|ammunition]] that makes the path of the bullet visible, allowing for corrections. Often these implementations are a 'quick shot' through all layers of an application, such as connecting a single form's input field to the back-end, to prove the layers connect as expected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gettingagile.com/2007/10/22/research-spikes-tracer-bullets-oh-my/|title=Research, Spikes, Tracer Bullets, Oh My!|last=Sterling|first=Chris|date=October 22, 2007|website=Getting Agile|access-date=October 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Limitations ==\n\nThe benefits of Scrum may be more difficult to achieve when:<ref>{{cite journal |title=Limitations of Agile Software Processes |journal=Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Extreme Programming and Flexible Processes in Software Engineering |pages=43\u201346 |orig-year=2002 |arxiv=1409.6600v1 |last1=Turk |first1=Dan |last2=France |first2=Robert |last3=Rumpe |first3=Bernhard |year=2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ijser.org/researchpaper/Issues-and-Challenges-in-Scrum-Implementation.pdf |title=Issues and Challenges in Scrum Implementation |journal=International Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research |volume=3 |issue=8 |date=August 2012 |accessdate=December 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\n* '''Teams whose members are geographically dispersed or part-time''': In Scrum, developers should have close and ongoing interaction, ideally working together in the same space most of the time. While recent improvements in technology have reduced the impact of these barriers (e.g., being able to collaborate on a digital whiteboard), the Agile manifesto asserts that the best communication is face to face.<ref name=\"AgileManifesto\">{{cite web|url=http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html|title=Principles behind the Agile Manifesto |year=2001 |website=|publisher=Agile Alliance |author=[[Kent Beck]] |author2=James Grenning |author3=[[Robert Cecil Martin|Robert C.

This can be encouraged by good Scrum leadership. While team members with very specific skills can and do contribute well, they should be encouraged to learn more about and collaborate with other disciplines.\n* '''Products with many external dependencies''': In Scrum, dividing product development into short sprints requires careful planning; external dependencies, such as [[user acceptance testing]] or coordination with other teams, can lead to delays and the failure of individual sprints.\n* '''Products that are [[Product life-cycle theory|mature]] or [[Legacy system|legacy]] or with regulated [[quality control]]''': In Scrum, product increments should be fully developed and tested in a single sprint; products that need large amounts of [[regression testing]] or safety testing (e.g., medical devices or vehicle control) for each release are less suited to short sprints than to longer [[waterfall model|waterfall]] releases.\n\nFrom a business perspective, Scrum has many virtues, one of which is that it is designed to yield the best business solutions. However, the efficiency by which it does so in any given organization can vary widely and is largely dependent on the ability of the organization to adhere to the implementation guidelines. Every company has its own distinct organizational structure, culture, and set of business practices, and some are more naturally amenable to this methodology than others.\n\n== Tools for implementation ==\n{{Main|Comparison of Scrum software}}\nLike other agile methods, effective adoption of Scrum can be supported through a wide range of tools.\n\nMany companies use universal tools, such as spreadsheets to build and maintain artifacts such as the sprint backlog. There are also open-source and proprietary software packages for Scrum\u2014which are either dedicated to product development using the Scrum framework or support multiple product development approaches including Scrum.\n\nOther organizations implement Scrum without software tools and maintain their artifacts in hard-copy forms such as paper, whiteboards, and sticky notes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://targetprocess.com/download/whitepaper/agiletools.pdf|format=PDF|title=Agile Tools.

All work within the Scrum framework should be visible to those responsible for the outcome: the process, the workflow, progress, etc. In order to make these things visible, scrum teams need to frequently inspect the product being developed and how well the team is working. With frequent inspection, the team can spot when their work deviates outside of acceptable limits and adapt their process or the product under development.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Scrum: an ideal framework for agile projects|last=Morris|first=David|publisher=In Easy Steps|year=2017|isbn=9781840787313|location=|pages=178\u2013179|oclc=951453155}}</ref>\n\nThese three pillars require trust and openness in the team, which the following five values of Scrum enable:<ref name=\"scrumguide\" />\n\n# Commitment: Team members individually commit to achieving their team goals, each and every [[Sprint (software development)|sprint]].\n# Courage: Team members know they have the courage to work through conflict and challenges together so that they can do the right thing.\n# Focus: Team members focus exclusively on their team goals and the sprint backlog; there should be no work done other than through their backlog.\n# Openness: Team members and their stakeholders agree to be transparent about their work and any challenges they face.\n# Respect: Team members respect each other to be technically capable and to work with good intent.\n\n== Adaptations ==\n\nThe hybridization of Scrum with other software development methodologies is common as Scrum does not cover the whole [[software lifecycle|product development lifecycle]]; therefore, organizations find the need to add in additional processes to create a more comprehensive implementation. For example, at the start of product development, organizations commonly add process guidance on the business case, requirements gathering and prioritization, initial high-level design, and budget and schedule forecasting.<ref>{{Cite journal |author1=Hron, M. |author2=Obwegeser, N.|date=January 2018|title=Scrum in practice: an overview of Scrum adaptations|url=http://pure.au.dk/portal/files/116906219/Hron_Obwegeser_Scrum_in_practice_An_overview_of_Scrum_adaptations.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the 2018 51st Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS), January 3-6, 2018}}</ref>\n\nVarious authors and communities of people who use Scrum have also suggested more detailed techniques for how to apply or adapt Scrum to particular problems or organizations.  Many refer to these methodological techniques as 'patterns' - by analogy with [[design pattern]]s in architecture and software.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/a/scrumorgpatterns.com/www/|title=Scrum as Organizational Patterns |last=Bj\u00f8rnvig|first=Gertrud|last2=Coplien|first2=Jim|date=June 21, 2008|website=|publisher=Gertrude & Cope}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scrumplop.org|title=Scrum Pattern Community |website=ScrumPLoP.org|access-date=July 22, 2016}}</ref> Such patterns have extended Scrum outside of the software development domain into Manufacturing,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://agilebusinessmanagement.org/content/wikispeed-%E2%80%93-applying-agile-software-principles-and-practices-fast-automotive-development|title=WIKISPEED \u2013 Applying Agile software principles and practices for fast automotive development|date=December 3, 2013|website=|publisher=Agile Business Management Consortium |accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref> Finance and [[Human Resources]].\n\n=== Scrumban ===\n{{Main|Scrumban}}\n\nScrumban is a software production model based on Scrum and [[Kanban (development)|Kanban]]. Scrumban is especially suited for [[Software maintenance|product maintenance]] with frequent and unexpected work items, such as [[Software bug|production defects]] or programming errors. In such cases the time-limited sprints of the Scrum framework may be perceived to be of less benefit, although Scrum's daily events and other practices can still be applied, depending on the team and the situation at hand. Visualization of the work stages and limitations for simultaneous unfinished work and defects are familiar from the Kanban model. Using these methods, the team's [[workflow]] is directed in a way that allows for minimum completion time for each work item or programming error, and on the other hand ensures each team member is constantly employed.<ref name=\"knibergskarin\">{{cite web|url=https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/kanban-scrum-minibook|title=Kanban and Scrum - Making the most of both|last=Kniberg|first=Henrik|last2=Skarin|first2=Mattias|date=December 21, 2009 |website=|publisher=InfoQ|format=PDF|accessdate=July 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\nTo illustrate each stage of work, teams working in the same space often use post-it notes or a large whiteboard.<ref name=\"scrumban\">{{cite web|url=http://leansoftwareengineering.com/ksse/scrum-ban/|title=scrum-ban|last=Ladas|first=Corey|date=October 27, 2007|publisher=Lean Software Engineering|accessdate=September 13, 2012}}</ref> In the case of decentralized teams, stage-illustration software such as [[Assembla]], [[Jira (software)|JIRA]] or [[Agilo for Trac|Agilo]] can be used.\n\nThe major differences between Scrum and Kanban is that in Scrum work is divided into sprints that last a fixed amount of time, whereas in Kanban the flow of work is continuous. This is visible in work stage tables, which in Scrum are emptied after each sprint, whereas in Kanban all tasks are marked on the same table. Scrum focuses on teams with multifaceted know-how, whereas Kanban makes specialized, functional teams possible.<ref name=\"knibergskarin\" />\n\n=== Scrum of scrums ===\n\nThe scrum of scrums is a technique to operate Scrum at scale, for multiple teams working on the same product, allowing them to discuss progress on their interdependencies, focusing on how to coordinate delivering software,<ref name=\"scrumofscrums\" /> especially on areas of overlap and integration. Depending on the cadence (timing) of the scrum of scrums, the relevant daily scrum for each scrum team ends by designating one member as an ambassador to participate in the scrum of scrums with ambassadors from other teams. Depending on the context, the ambassadors may be technical contributors or each team's scrum master.<ref name=\"scrumofscrums\">{{cite web |publisher=Agile Alliance |title=Scrum of Scrums |url=http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/scrumofscrums.html |date=December 17, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nRather than simply a progress update, the scrum of scrums should focus on how teams are collectively working to resolve, mitigate, or accept any risks, impediments, dependencies, and assumptions (RIDAs) that have been identified. The scrum of scrums tracks these RIDAs via a backlog of its own, such as a risk board (sometimes known as a ''ROAM board'' after the initials of resolved, owned, accepted, and mitigated),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutagile.com/risk-management-how-to-stop-risks-from-screwing-up-your-projects/ |title=Risk Management \u2013 How to Stop Risks from Screwing Up Your Projects!|publisher=Kelly Waters}}</ref> which typically leads to greater coordination and collaboration between teams.<ref name=\"scrumofscrums\" />\n\nThis should run similar to a daily scrum, with each ambassador answering the following four questions:<ref>{{cite web|title=Scrum of Scrums|url=http://scrummastertest.com/scrum-of-scrums/|website=Scrum Master Test Prep|accessdate=May 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\n* What risks, impediments, dependencies, or assumptions has your team resolved since we last met?\n* What risks, impediments, dependencies, or assumptions will your team resolve before we meet again?\n* Are there any new risks, impediments, dependencies, or assumptions slowing your team down or getting in their way?\n* Are you about to introduce a new risk, impediment, dependency, or assumption that will get in another team's way?\n\nAs [[Jeff Sutherland]] commented,<ref name=\"scrumofscrums\" />\n\n<blockquote>Since I originally defined the Scrum of Scrums (Ken Schwaber was at IDX working with me), I can definitively say the Scrum of Scrums is not a 'meta Scrum'. The Scrum of Scrums as I have used it is responsible for delivering the working software of all teams to the Definition of Done at the end of the sprint, or for releases during the sprint. PatientKeeper delivered to production four times per Sprint. Ancestry.com delivers to production 220 times per two-week Sprint. Hubspot delivers live software 100-300 times a day. The Scrum of Scrums Master is held accountable for making this work. So the Scrum of Scrums is an operational delivery mechanism.</blockquote>\n\n===Large-scale Scrum===\nLarge-scale Scrum (LeSS) is a product development framework that extends Scrum with scaling rules and guidelines without losing the original purposes of Scrum.\n\nThere are two levels to the framework: the first LeSS level is designed for up to eight teams; the second level, known as 'LeSS Huge', introduces additional scaling elements for development with up to hundreds of developers. \"Scaling Scrum starts with understanding and being able to adopt standard real one-team Scrum. Large-scale Scrum requires examining the purpose of single-team Scrum elements and figuring out how to reach the same purpose while staying within the constraints of the standard Scrum rules.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Larman |last2=scrumyear=2013 |title=Scaling Agile Development (Crosstalk journal, November / December 2013)|url=http://www.crosstalkonline.org/storage/issue-archives/2013/201305/201305-larman.pdf}}</ref>\n\nBas Vodde and [[Craig Larman]] evolved the LeSS framework from their experiences working with large-scale product development, especially in the telecoms and finance industries.

Henry and S. Henry. Quantitative assessment of the software maintenance process and requirements volatility. In Proc. of the ACM Conference on Computer Science, pages 346\u2013351, 1993.</ref>) and that there will be unpredictable challenges\u2014for which a predictive or planned approach is not suited. \n\nAs such, Scrum adopts an evidence-based [[Empirical process|empirical approach]] \u2013 accepting that the problem cannot be fully understood or defined up front, and instead focusing on how to maximize the team's ability to deliver quickly, to respond to emerging requirements, and to adapt to evolving technologies and changes in market conditions.\n\n== History ==\n\n[[Hirotaka Takeuchi]] and [[Ikujiro Nonaka]] introduced the term ''scrum'' in the context of [[New product development|product development]] in their 1986 ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' article, 'The New New Product Development Game'.<ref name=\"TakeuchiNonaka\">{{Cite journal|last1=Takeuchi|first1=Hirotaka|last2=Nonaka|first2=Ikujiro|date=January 1, 1986|title=The New New Product Development Game|url=https://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/86116-PDF-ENG|journal=Harvard Business Review|volume=|pages=|accessdate=June 9, 2010|quote=Moving the Scrum Downfield|via=}}</ref> Takeuchi and Nonaka later argued in ''The Knowledge Creating Company''<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B-qxrPaU1-MC&dq=The+Knowledge+Creating+Company&printsec=frontcover|title= The Knowledge Creating Company|publisher= Oxford University Press|page= 3|year= 1995|accessdate= March 12, 2013|isbn= 9780199762330}}</ref> that it is a form of \"organizational knowledge creation, [...] especially good at bringing about innovation continuously, incrementally and spirally\".\n\nThe authors described a new approach to commercial product development that would increase speed and flexibility, based on case studies from manufacturing firms in the automotive, photocopier and printer [[economic sector|industries]].<ref name=\"TakeuchiNonaka\" /> They called this the [[holistic]] or [[Rugby football|rugby]] approach, as the whole process is performed by one [[cross-functional team]] across multiple overlapping phases, in which the team \"tries to go the distance as a unit, passing the ball back and forth\".<ref name=\"TakeuchiNonaka\" /> (In [[rugby football]], a [[scrum (rugby)|scrum]] is used to restart play, as the forwards of each team interlock with their heads down and attempt to gain possession of the ball.<ref>{{Oxford&nbsp;Dictionaries|Scrum}}</ref>)\n\nThe Scrum framework was based on research by Schwaber with Tunde Babatunde at DuPont Research Station and University of Delaware. Tunde advised that attempts to develop complex products, such as software, that weren't based in empiricism were doomed to higher risks and rates of failure as the initial conditions and assumptions change. Empiricism, using frequent inspection and adaptation, with flexibility and transparency is the most suitable approach.\n\nIn the early 1990s, [[Ken Schwaber]] used what would become Scrum at his company, Advanced Development Methods; while [[Jeff Sutherland]], John Scumniotales and Jeff McKenna developed a similar approach at Easel Corporation, referring to it using the single word scrum.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url= https://www.scrumalliance.org/resource_download/35|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20171122013020/https://www.scrumalliance.org/resource_download/35|archivedate= November 22, 2017|format= PDF|title= Agile Development: Lessons learned from the first Scrum|last= Sutherland|first= Jeff|authorlink= Jeff Sutherland|date= October 2004|accessdate= September 26, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nKen and Jeff worked together to integrate their ideas into a single framework, Scrum.

Therefore a good product owner should be able to communicate what the business needs, ask why they need it (because there may be better ways to achieve that), and convey the message to all stakeholders including the Development Team using a technical language, as required. The Product Owner uses Scrum\u2019s empirical tools to manage highly complex work, while controlling risk and achieving value.\n\nCommunication is a core responsibility of the product owner. The ability to convey priorities and empathize with team members and stakeholders is vital to steer product development in the right direction. The product owner role bridges the communication gap between the team and its stakeholders, serving as a proxy for stakeholders to the team and as a team representative to the overall stakeholder community.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Agile Product Management with Scrum: Creating Products that Customers Love|last=Pichler|first=Roman|date=March 11, 2010|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|isbn=978-0-321-68413-4|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://agilemodeling.com/essays/productOwner.htm|title= The Product Owner Role: A Stakeholder Proxy for Agile Teams|last= Ambler|first= Scott|publisher= agilemodeling.com|access-date= July 22, 2016 |  quote =  [...] in practice there proves to be two critical aspects to this role: first as a stakeholder proxy within the development team and second as a project team representative to the overall stakeholder community as a whole.}}</ref>\n\nAs the face of the team to the stakeholders, the following are some of the communication tasks of the product owner to the stakeholders:<ref>{{cite web|title=The Product Owner Role|url=http://scrum-master.thinkific.com/pages/the-product-owner-role|website=Scrum Master Test Prep|accessdate=February 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\n* Define and announce releases.\n* Communicate delivery and team status.\n* Share progress during governance meetings.\n* Share significant RIDAs (risks, impediments, dependencies, and assumptions) with stakeholders.\n* Negotiate priorities, scope, funding, and schedule.\n* Ensure that the product backlog is visible, transparent and clear.\n\nEmpathy is a key attribute for a product owner to have\u2014the ability to put one's self in another's shoes. A product owner converses with different stakeholders, who have a variety of backgrounds, job roles, and objectives. A product owner must be able to see from these different points of view. To be effective, it is wise for a product owner to know the level of detail the audience needs. The development team needs thorough feedback and specifications so they can build a product up to expectation, while an executive sponsor may just need summaries of progress. Providing more information than necessary may lose stakeholder interest and waste time. A direct means of communication is the most preferred by seasoned agile product owners.<ref name=\":1\">Cohn, Mike. Succeeding with Agile: Software Development Using Scrum. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Addison-Wesley, 2010.</ref>\n\nA product owner's ability to communicate effectively is also enhanced by being skilled in techniques that identify stakeholder needs, negotiate priorities between stakeholder interests, and collaborate with developers to ensure effective implementation of requirements.\n\n=== Development team ===\n\nThe development team has from three to nine members who carry out all tasks required to build increments of valuable output every sprint.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nWhile team members are referred to as ''developers'' in some literature<ref name=\"scrumguide\" />, the term refers to anyone who plays a role in the development and support of the system or product, and can include researchers, architects, designers, data specialists, statisticians, analysts, engineers, programmers, and testers, among others.<ref name=\":2\" /> However, due to the confusion that can arise when some people do not feel the term 'developer' applies to them, they are often referred to just as ''team members''. \n\nThe team is self-organizing. While no work should come to the team except through the product owner, and the scrum master is expected to protect the team from too much distraction, the team should still be encouraged to interact directly with customers and/or stakeholders to gain maximum understanding and immediacy of feedback.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Scrum master ===\n\nScrum is facilitated by a scrum master, who is accountable for removing impediments to the ability of the team to deliver the product goals and deliverables.<ref>Carroll, N, O\u2019Connor, M. and Edison, H.

What did not go well? What could be improved for better productivity in the next sprint?\n* The recommended duration is one-and-a-half hours for a two-week sprint (proportional for other sprint duration(s))\n* This event is facilitated by the scrum master\n\n=== Backlog refinement ===\n\nBacklog [[Refinement (computing)|refinement]] (formerly called grooming) is the ongoing process of reviewing product backlog items and checking that they are appropriately prepared and ordered in a way that makes them clear and executable for teams once they enter sprints via the sprint planning activity. Product backlog items may be broken into multiple smaller ones. Acceptance criteria may be clarified. Dependencies may be identified and investigated.\n\nAlthough not originally a core Scrum practice, backlog refinement has been added to the Scrum Guide and adopted as a way of managing the quality of product backlog items entering a sprint, with a recommended investment of up to 10% of a team's sprint capacity.<ref name=\"scrumguide\" /><ref>{{cite book|last=Cho|first=L|title=Adopting an Agile Culture A User Experience Team's Journey|journal=Agile Conference|year=2009|doi=10.1109/AGILE.2009.76|isbn=978-0-7695-3768-9|pages=416\u2013421}}</ref>\n\nThe backlog can also include [[technical debt]] (also known as design debt or code debt). This is a concept in software development that reflects the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.\n\n=== Cancelling a sprint ===\n\nThe product owner can cancel a sprint if necessary.<ref name=\"scrumguide\" /> The product owner may do so with input from the team, scrum master or management. For instance, management may wish the product owner to cancel a sprint if external circumstances negate the value of the sprint goal. If a sprint is abnormally terminated, the next step is to conduct a new sprint planning, where the reason for the termination is reviewed.\n\n== Artifacts ==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2013}}\n\n=== Product backlog ===\n\nThe product backlog is a breakdown of work to be done<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sedano|first1=Todd|last2=Ralph|first2=Paul|last3=P\u00e9raire|first3=C\u00e9cile|title=The Product Backlog|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330823863_The_Product_Backlog|publisher=IEEE}}</ref> and contains an ordered list of [[Requirement|product requirements]] that a scrum team maintains for a [[New product development|product]]. Common formats include [[user story|user stories]] and [[use case]]s.<ref name=\"scrumprimer\" /> The requirements define [[Software feature|feature]]s, [[Patch (computing)|bug fix]]es, [[non-functional requirement]]s, etc.\u2014whatever must be done to deliver a viable product. The product owner prioritizes product backlog items (PBIs) based on considerations such as risk, business value, dependencies, size, and date needed.\n\nThe product backlog is what will be delivered, ordered into the sequence in which it should be delivered. It is visible to everyone but may only be changed with the consent of the product owner, who is ultimately responsible for ordering product backlog items for the development team to choose.\n\nThe product backlog contains the product owner's assessment of business value and the development team's assessment of development effort, which are often, but not always, stated in [[Planning poker|story points]] using the [[Fibonacci scale (agile)|rounded Fibonacci scale]]. These estimates help the product owner to gauge the timeline and may influence the ordering of product backlog items; for example, if two features have the same business value, the product owner may schedule earlier delivery of the one with the lower development effort (because the [[return on investment]] is higher) or the one with higher development effort (because it is more complex or riskier, and they want to retire that risk earlier).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.batimes.com/articles/authoring-requirements-in-an-agile-world.html|title= Authoring Requirements in an Agile World|publisher= BA Times|first= Tony|last= Higgins|date= March 31, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe product backlog and the business value of each product backlog item is the responsibility of the product owner. The effort to deliver each item is estimated by the development team in story points, or time. By estimating in story points, the team reduces the dependency in individual developers; this is useful especially in dynamic teams where developers are often assigned to other projects after sprint delivery. For instance, if a user story is estimated as a 5 in effort (using Fibonacci sequence), it remains 5 regardless of how many developers are working on it\n\nStory points define the effort in a time-box, so they do not change with time. For instance, in one hour an individual can walk, run, or climb, but the effort expended is clearly different. The gap progression between the terms in the Fibonacci sequence encourages the team to deliver carefully considered estimates. Estimates of 1, 2 or 3 imply similar efforts (1 being trivial), but if the team estimates an 8 or 13 (or higher), the impact on both delivery and budget can be significant. The value of using story points is that the team can reuse them by comparing similar work from previous sprints, but it should be recognized that estimates are relative to the team. For example, an estimate of 5 for one team could be a 2 for another having senior developers and higher skills.\n\nEvery team should have a product owner, although in many instances a product owner could work with more than one team.<ref name=\":1\" /> The product owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product. The product owner gathers input and takes feedback from, and is lobbied by, many people, but ultimately makes the call on what gets built.\n\nThe product backlog:\n\n* Captures requests to modify a product\u2014including new features, replacing old features, removing features, and fixing issues\n* Ensures the development team has work that maximizes business benefit to the product owner\n\nTypically, the product owner and the scrum team work together to develop the breakdown of work; this becomes the product backlog, which evolves as new information surfaces about the product and about its customers, and so later sprints may address new work.\n\n==== Management ====\n\nA product backlog, in its simplest form, is merely a list of items to work on. Having well-established rules about how work is added, removed and ordered helps the whole team make better decisions about how to change the product.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.atlassian.com/agile/backlogs|title=The product backlog: your ultimate to-do list|website=Atlassian|accessdate=July 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe product owner prioritizes product backlog items based on which are needed soonest. The team then chooses which items they can complete in the coming sprint. On the scrum board, the team moves items from the product backlog to the sprint backlog, which is the list of items they will build. Conceptually, it is ideal for the team to only select what they think they can accomplish from the top of the list, but it is not unusual to see in practice that teams are able to take lower-priority items from the list along with the top ones selected. This normally happens because there is time left within the sprint to accommodate more work. Items at the top of the backlog, the items to work on first, should be broken down into stories that are suitable for the development team to work on. The further down the backlog goes, the less refined the items should be. As Schwaber and Beedle put it \"The lower the priority, the less detail until you can barely make out the backlog item.\"<ref name=\"schwaber\" />\n\nAs the team works through the backlog, it must be assumed that change happens outside their environment\u2014the team can learn about new market opportunities to take advantage of, competitor threats that arise, and feedback from customers that can change the way the product was meant to work. All of these new ideas tend to trigger the team to adapt the backlog to incorporate new knowledge. This is part of the fundamental mindset of an agile team. The world changes, the backlog is never finished.<ref name=\"Pichler, Roman 2010\">Pichler, Roman. ''Agile Product Management with Scrum: Creating Products that Customers Love''.

The development team should keep in mind its past performance assessing its capacity for the new-sprint, and use this as a guideline of how much 'effort' they can complete.\n\nThe product backlog items may be broken down into tasks by the development team.<ref name=\"MartinelliMilosevic2016\" /> Tasks on the sprint backlog are never assigned (or pushed) to team members by someone else; rather team members sign up for (or pull) tasks as needed according to the backlog priority and their own skills and capacity. This promotes self-organization of the development team and developer buy-in.\n\nThe sprint backlog is the property of the development team, and all included estimates are provided by the development team. Often an accompanying task board is used to see and change the state of the tasks of the current sprint, like to do, in progress and done.\n\nOnce a sprint backlog is committed, no additional work can be added to the sprint backlog except by the team. Once a sprint has been delivered, the product backlog is analyzed and reprioritized if necessary, and the next set of functionality is selected for the next sprint.\n\n=== Increment ===\n\nThe ''increment'' is the potentially releasable output of the sprint that meets the sprint goal. It is formed from all the completed sprint backlog items, integrated with the work of all previous sprints. The increment must be complete, according to the scrum team's ''definition of done'' (DoD), fully functioning, and in a usable condition regardless of whether the product owner decides to actually deploy and use it.\n\n=== Extensions ===\n\nThe following artifacts and techniques can be used to help people use Scrum.<ref name=\"scrumguide\" />\n\n==== Sprint burndown chart ====\n\n[[File:SampleBurndownChart.svg|thumb|A sample burndown chart for a completed sprint, showing remaining effort at the end of each day.]]\n\n{{main|Burn down chart}}\n\nThe sprint burndown chart is a publicly displayed chart showing remaining work in the sprint backlog.<ref name=\"Cobb2015\">{{cite book|author=Charles G. Cobb|title=The Project Manager's Guide to Mastering Agile: Principles and Practices for an Adaptive Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vHjTBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA378|date=January 27, 2015|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-99104-6|page=378}}</ref> Updated every day, it gives a simple view of the sprint progress. It also provides quick visualizations for reference. The horizontal axis of the sprint burndown chart shows the days in a sprint, while the vertical axis shows the amount of work remaining each day (typically representing the estimate of hours of work remaining).\n\nDuring sprint planning, the ideal burndown chart is plotted. Then, during the sprint, each member picks up tasks from the sprint backlog and works on them. At the end of the day, they update the remaining hours for tasks to be completed. In such a way, the actual burndown chart is updated day by day.\n\nIt should not be confused with an [[earned value management|earned value chart]].\n\n==== Release burn-up chart ====\n\n[[File:SampleBurnupChart.png|thumb|A sample burn-up chart for a release, showing scope completed each sprint (MVP = Minimum Viable Product)]]\n\nThe release burn-up chart is a way for the team to provide visibility and track progress toward a release. Updated at the end of each sprint, it shows progress toward delivering a forecast scope. The horizontal axis of the release burn-up chart shows the sprints in a release, while the vertical axis shows the amount of work completed at the end of each sprint (typically representing cumulative story points of work completed). Progress is plotted as a line that grows up to meet a horizontal line that represents the forecast scope; often shown with a forecast, based on progress to date, that indicates how much scope might be completed by a given release date or how many sprints it will take to complete the given scope.\n\nThe release burn-up chart makes it easy to see how much work has been completed, how much work has been added or removed (if the horizontal scope line moves), and how much work is left to be done.\n\n==== Definition of ready (DoR) ====\nThe start criteria to determine whether the [[specification]]s and inputs are set enough to start the work item, i.e. a [[user story]].\n\n==== Definition of done (DoD) ====\nThe [[exit-criteria]] to determine whether a product backlog item is complete. In many cases, the DoD requires that all [[regression testing|regression tests]] be successful. The definition of done may vary from one scrum team to another but must be consistent within one team.<ref>Ken Schwaber, ''Agile Project Management with Scrum'', p.55</ref>\n\n==== Velocity ====\n\nThe total effort a team is capable of in a sprint. The number is derived by evaluating the work (typically in [[user story]] points) completed in the last sprint. The collection of historical velocity data is a guideline for assisting the team in understanding how much work they can likely achieve in a future sprint.\n\n==== Spike ====\n\nA time-boxed period used to research a concept or create a simple prototype. Spikes can either be planned to take place in between sprints or, for larger teams, a spike might be accepted as one of many sprint delivery objectives. Spikes are often introduced before the delivery of large or complex product backlog items in order to secure budget, expand knowledge, or produce a proof of concept. The duration and objective(s) of a spike is agreed between product owner and development team before the start. Unlike sprint commitments, spikes may or may not deliver tangible, shippable, valuable functionality. For example, the objective of a spike might be to successfully reach a decision on a course of action. The spike is over when the time is up, not necessarily when the objective has been delivered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/spike.html|title=Create a Spike Solution|publisher=Extreme Programming}}</ref>\n\n==== Tracer bullet ====\n\nAlso called a drone spike, a tracer bullet is a spike with the current architecture, current technology set, current set of best practices that result in production quality code. It might just be a very narrow implementation of the functionality but is not throwaway code. It is of production quality, and the rest of the iterations can build on this code. The name has military origins as [[Tracer ammunition|ammunition]] that makes the path of the bullet visible, allowing for corrections. Often these implementations are a 'quick shot' through all layers of an application, such as connecting a single form's input field to the back-end, to prove the layers connect as expected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gettingagile.com/2007/10/22/research-spikes-tracer-bullets-oh-my/|title=Research, Spikes, Tracer Bullets, Oh My!|last=Sterling|first=Chris|date=October 22, 2007|website=Getting Agile|access-date=October 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Limitations ==\n\nThe benefits of Scrum may be more difficult to achieve when:<ref>{{cite journal |title=Limitations of Agile Software Processes |journal=Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Extreme Programming and Flexible Processes in Software Engineering |pages=43\u201346 |orig-year=2002 |arxiv=1409.6600v1 |last1=Turk |first1=Dan |last2=France |first2=Robert |last3=Rumpe |first3=Bernhard |year=2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ijser.org/researchpaper/Issues-and-Challenges-in-Scrum-Implementation.pdf |title=Issues and Challenges in Scrum Implementation |journal=International Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research |volume=3 |issue=8 |date=August 2012 |accessdate=December 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\n* '''Teams whose members are geographically dispersed or part-time''': In Scrum, developers should have close and ongoing interaction, ideally working together in the same space most of the time. While recent improvements in technology have reduced the impact of these barriers (e.g., being able to collaborate on a digital whiteboard), the Agile manifesto asserts that the best communication is face to face.<ref name=\"AgileManifesto\">{{cite web|url=http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html|title=Principles behind the Agile Manifesto |year=2001 |website=|publisher=Agile Alliance |author=[[Kent Beck]] |author2=James Grenning |author3=[[Robert Cecil Martin|Robert C.

This can be encouraged by good Scrum leadership. While team members with very specific skills can and do contribute well, they should be encouraged to learn more about and collaborate with other disciplines.\n* '''Products with many external dependencies''': In Scrum, dividing product development into short sprints requires careful planning; external dependencies, such as [[user acceptance testing]] or coordination with other teams, can lead to delays and the failure of individual sprints.\n* '''Products that are [[Product life-cycle theory|mature]] or [[Legacy system|legacy]] or with regulated [[quality control]]''': In Scrum, product increments should be fully developed and tested in a single sprint; products that need large amounts of [[regression testing]] or safety testing (e.g., medical devices or vehicle control) for each release are less suited to short sprints than to longer [[waterfall model|waterfall]] releases.\n\nFrom a business perspective, Scrum has many virtues, one of which is that it is designed to yield the best business solutions. However, the efficiency by which it does so in any given organization can vary widely and is largely dependent on the ability of the organization to adhere to the implementation guidelines. Every company has its own distinct organizational structure, culture, and set of business practices, and some are more naturally amenable to this methodology than others.\n\n== Tools for implementation ==\n{{Main|Comparison of Scrum software}}\nLike other agile methods, effective adoption of Scrum can be supported through a wide range of tools.\n\nMany companies use universal tools, such as spreadsheets to build and maintain artifacts such as the sprint backlog. There are also open-source and proprietary software packages for Scrum\u2014which are either dedicated to product development using the Scrum framework or support multiple product development approaches including Scrum.\n\nOther organizations implement Scrum without software tools and maintain their artifacts in hard-copy forms such as paper, whiteboards, and sticky notes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://targetprocess.com/download/whitepaper/agiletools.pdf|format=PDF|title=Agile Tools.

All work within the Scrum framework should be visible to those responsible for the outcome: the process, the workflow, progress, etc. In order to make these things visible, scrum teams need to frequently inspect the product being developed and how well the team is working. With frequent inspection, the team can spot when their work deviates outside of acceptable limits and adapt their process or the product under development.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Scrum: an ideal framework for agile projects|last=Morris|first=David|publisher=In Easy Steps|year=2017|isbn=9781840787313|location=|pages=178\u2013179|oclc=951453155}}</ref>\n\nThese three pillars require trust and openness in the team, which the following five values of Scrum enable:<ref name=\"scrumguide\" />\n\n# Commitment: Team members individually commit to achieving their team goals, each and every [[Sprint (software development)|sprint]].\n# Courage: Team members know they have the courage to work through conflict and challenges together so that they can do the right thing.\n# Focus: Team members focus exclusively on their team goals and the sprint backlog; there should be no work done other than through their backlog.\n# Openness: Team members and their stakeholders agree to be transparent about their work and any challenges they face.\n# Respect: Team members respect each other to be technically capable and to work with good intent.\n\n== Adaptations ==\n\nThe hybridization of Scrum with other software development methodologies is common as Scrum does not cover the whole [[software lifecycle|product development lifecycle]]; therefore, organizations find the need to add in additional processes to create a more comprehensive implementation. For example, at the start of product development, organizations commonly add process guidance on the business case, requirements gathering and prioritization, initial high-level design, and budget and schedule forecasting.<ref>{{Cite journal |author1=Hron, M. |author2=Obwegeser, N.|date=January 2018|title=Scrum in practice: an overview of Scrum adaptations|url=http://pure.au.dk/portal/files/116906219/Hron_Obwegeser_Scrum_in_practice_An_overview_of_Scrum_adaptations.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the 2018 51st Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS), January 3-6, 2018}}</ref>\n\nVarious authors and communities of people who use Scrum have also suggested more detailed techniques for how to apply or adapt Scrum to particular problems or organizations.

Scrumban is especially suited for [[Software maintenance|product maintenance]] with frequent and unexpected work items, such as [[Software bug|production defects]] or programming errors. In such cases the time-limited sprints of the Scrum framework may be perceived to be of less benefit, although Scrum's daily events and other practices can still be applied, depending on the team and the situation at hand. Visualization of the work stages and limitations for simultaneous unfinished work and defects are familiar from the Kanban model. Using these methods, the team's [[workflow]] is directed in a way that allows for minimum completion time for each work item or programming error, and on the other hand ensures each team member is constantly employed.<ref name=\"knibergskarin\">{{cite web|url=https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/kanban-scrum-minibook|title=Kanban and Scrum - Making the most of both|last=Kniberg|first=Henrik|last2=Skarin|first2=Mattias|date=December 21, 2009 |website=|publisher=InfoQ|format=PDF|accessdate=July 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\nTo illustrate each stage of work, teams working in the same space often use post-it notes or a large whiteboard.<ref name=\"scrumban\">{{cite web|url=http://leansoftwareengineering.com/ksse/scrum-ban/|title=scrum-ban|last=Ladas|first=Corey|date=October 27, 2007|publisher=Lean Software Engineering|accessdate=September 13, 2012}}</ref> In the case of decentralized teams, stage-illustration software such as [[Assembla]], [[Jira (software)|JIRA]] or [[Agilo for Trac|Agilo]] can be used.\n\nThe major differences between Scrum and Kanban is that in Scrum work is divided into sprints that last a fixed amount of time, whereas in Kanban the flow of work is continuous. This is visible in work stage tables, which in Scrum are emptied after each sprint, whereas in Kanban all tasks are marked on the same table. Scrum focuses on teams with multifaceted know-how, whereas Kanban makes specialized, functional teams possible.<ref name=\"knibergskarin\" />\n\n=== Scrum of scrums ===\n\nThe scrum of scrums is a technique to operate Scrum at scale, for multiple teams working on the same product, allowing them to discuss progress on their interdependencies, focusing on how to coordinate delivering software,<ref name=\"scrumofscrums\" /> especially on areas of overlap and integration. Depending on the cadence (timing) of the scrum of scrums, the relevant daily scrum for each scrum team ends by designating one member as an ambassador to participate in the scrum of scrums with ambassadors from other teams. Depending on the context, the ambassadors may be technical contributors or each team's scrum master.<ref name=\"scrumofscrums\">{{cite web |publisher=Agile Alliance |title=Scrum of Scrums |url=http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/scrumofscrums.html |date=December 17, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nRather than simply a progress update, the scrum of scrums should focus on how teams are collectively working to resolve, mitigate, or accept any risks, impediments, dependencies, and assumptions (RIDAs) that have been identified. The scrum of scrums tracks these RIDAs via a backlog of its own, such as a risk board (sometimes known as a ''ROAM board'' after the initials of resolved, owned, accepted, and mitigated),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutagile.com/risk-management-how-to-stop-risks-from-screwing-up-your-projects/ |title=Risk Management \u2013 How to Stop Risks from Screwing Up Your Projects!|publisher=Kelly Waters}}</ref> which typically leads to greater coordination and collaboration between teams.<ref name=\"scrumofscrums\" />\n\nThis should run similar to a daily scrum, with each ambassador answering the following four questions:<ref>{{cite web|title=Scrum of Scrums|url=http://scrummastertest.com/scrum-of-scrums/|website=Scrum Master Test Prep|accessdate=May 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\n* What risks, impediments, dependencies, or assumptions has your team resolved since we last met?\n* What risks, impediments, dependencies, or assumptions will your team resolve before we meet again?\n* Are there any new risks, impediments, dependencies, or assumptions slowing your team down or getting in their way?\n* Are you about to introduce a new risk, impediment, dependency, or assumption that will get in another team's way?\n\nAs [[Jeff Sutherland]] commented,<ref name=\"scrumofscrums\" />\n\n<blockquote>Since I originally defined the Scrum of Scrums (Ken Schwaber was at IDX working with me), I can definitively say the Scrum of Scrums is not a 'meta Scrum'. The Scrum of Scrums as I have used it is responsible for delivering the working software of all teams to the Definition of Done at the end of the sprint, or for releases during the sprint. PatientKeeper delivered to production four times per Sprint. Ancestry.com delivers to production 220 times per two-week Sprint. Hubspot delivers live software 100-300 times a day. The Scrum of Scrums Master is held accountable for making this work. So the Scrum of Scrums is an operational delivery mechanism.</blockquote>\n\n===Large-scale Scrum===\nLarge-scale Scrum (LeSS) is a product development framework that extends Scrum with scaling rules and guidelines without losing the original purposes of Scrum.\n\nThere are two levels to the framework: the first LeSS level is designed for up to eight teams; the second level, known as 'LeSS Huge', introduces additional scaling elements for development with up to hundreds of developers. \"Scaling Scrum starts with understanding and being able to adopt standard real one-team Scrum. Large-scale Scrum requires examining the purpose of single-team Scrum elements and figuring out how to reach the same purpose while staying within the constraints of the standard Scrum rules.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Larman |last2=scrumyear=2013 |title=Scaling Agile Development (Crosstalk journal, November / December 2013)|url=http://www.crosstalkonline.org/storage/issue-archives/2013/201305/201305-larman.pdf}}</ref>\n\nBas Vodde and [[Craig Larman]] evolved the LeSS framework from their experiences working with large-scale product development, especially in the telecoms and finance industries. It evolved by taking Scrum and trying many different experiments to discover what works. In 2013, the experiments were solidified into the LeSS framework rules.<ref>{{cite web|year=2014 |title=Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS)|url=http://less.works}}</ref> The intention of LeSS is to 'descale' organization complexity, dissolving unnecessary complex organizational solutions, and solving them in simpler ways.

It is the fourth installment in the [[Shrek (franchise)|''Shrek'' film franchise]] and the sequel to ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' (2007). The film was directed by [[Mike Mitchell (director)|Mike Mitchell]] from a screenplay by [[Josh Klausner]] and [[Darren Lemke]], and stars [[Mike Myers]], [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Cameron Diaz]], [[Antonio Banderas]], [[Julie Andrews]], and [[John Cleese]] reprising their previous roles, with [[Walt Dohrn]] introduced in the role of [[Rumpelstiltskin]]. The plot follows [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] struggling as a family man with no privacy, who yearns for the days when he was once feared. He is tricked by Rumpelstiltskin into signing a contract that allows him to relive his golden age, but comes to realize that it comes alongside disastrous consequences.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] on April 21, 2010, and was theatrically released in the [[United States]] on May 21, 2010 in [[3D film|3D]] and [[IMAX#IMAX 3D|IMAX 3D]] formats. The film debuted as the top-grossing film at the box office, a position it held for three consecutive weeks in the United States and Canada. The film received mixed reviews from critics, but many had considered it an improvement over its predecessor. The film grossed a worldwide total of $752&nbsp;million and becoming the [[2010 in film|fifth-highest-grossing film of 2010]]. In addition, ''Shrek Forever After'' became DreamWorks Animation's second-highest-grossing film at the foreign box office.<ref>{{cite web|last=Heath|first=Paul|url=http://www.thehollywoodnews.com/2010/09/07/shrek-forever-after-becomes-dreamworks-animations-biggest-release/|title=Shrek Forever After becomes Dreamworks Animation's biggest release|publisher=The Hollywood News|date=September 7, 2010}}</ref> Although originally marketed as the final installment in the film franchise, a [[Shrek Forever After#Possible sequels|fifth ''Shrek'' film]] has been reported to be in production in the years since ''Forever After'' was released.<ref name=\"Sequel-HollywoodReporter\" /><ref name=\"Shrek5\">{{cite web|last1=O'Connell|first1=Sean|title=When Shrek 5 Could Hit Theaters, According To Eddie Murphy|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1556529/when-shrek-5-could-hit-theaters-according-to-eddie-murphy|publisher=Cinemablend|accessdate=September 17, 2016|date=September 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!--\n\nPer WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words.\n \n-->\nIn a flashback, King Harold and Queen Lillian are about to sign the kingdom of Far Far Away over to [[Rumpelstiltskin|\"Rumpel\" Rumpelstiltskin]],  in exchange for lifting their daughter's curse. The deal is canceled at the last second when a knight informs the King and Queen that [[Princess Fiona]] has been rescued by [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]]. An angry Rumpelstiltskin laments his loss and wishes Shrek was never born.\n\nIn the present time, Shrek has grown steadily weary of being a family man and celebrity among the local villagers, leading him to wish for when he felt like a \"real ogre\" again. When he takes his family to Far Far Away to celebrate his children's first birthday, an escalating series of mishaps further injure his ego, causing him to lose his temper and walk out in anger.\n\nShrek encounters Rumpel, who gives his chance, having observed Shrek's angry outburst. He follows Shrek and arranges for him to appear to save his life. He gives Shrek a day to live like a real ogre, in exchange for a day from his childhood that he would not remember being erased to \"thank\" him. Shrek was tricked by Rumpelstiltskin into signing the contract and suddenly was taken to an [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate reality]] where the events starting from [[Shrek|the first film ]] never happened. Now feared by the villagers, Shrek takes the opportunity to cause some lighthearted mischief until he learns that Fiona is a fugitive, and his swamp is deserted and desolate. He is kidnapped by [[Witchcraft|witches]] and taken to Rumpel, now the King of Far Far Away, which has become derelict.\n\nRumpel reveals that he erased the day that Shrek was born. Therefore, Shrek does not exist, and the King and Queen signed their kingdom over to Rumpelstiltskin, making them disappear. When the day ends, Shrek will disappear as well. Shrek escapes Rumpel's castle with Donkey. Initially terrified of Shrek, Donkey decides to trust him after seeing Shrek cry over his erased history, something he had never seen an ogre do before. Donkey helps him find a hidden exit clause: the contract can be nullified by \"true love's kiss\".\n\nThey soon encounter an army of ogres who are resisting Rumpel, led by a still-cursed Fiona, who keeps [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]] as a lazy, overweight pet. Shrek does everything he can to gain Fiona's love, but she is cynical and disillusioned about the power of true love after no one came to rescue her and is too busy preparing an ambush on Rumpel. While sparring with her, Fiona begins to take a liking to Shrek but stops short of kissing him. Puss encourages him to continue pursuing Fiona.\n\nDuring the ambush, the ogres are captured by the [[Pied Piper of Hamelin|Pied Piper]], though Shrek and Fiona escape with the intervention of Puss and Donkey. Shrek insists Fiona kiss him, saying it will fix everything, but it does not work because Fiona does not truly love him. When he hears that Rumpel is offering a wish to the one who brings him Shrek, Shrek turns himself in and uses the wish to free the other ogres, who storm the castle, battle the witches, and capture Rumpel.\n\nAs the sun rises, Shrek begins to fade from existence, but Fiona, having fallen in love with him, kisses Shrek just before he disappears. As she does not transform in the sunlight, she realizes that her kiss with Shrek has broken her curse as she has assumed \"love's true form\". The alternate reality disintegrates and everyone else disappears as Rumpel is then attacked by vengeful spirits.\n\nShrek finds himself back at his children's birthday party at the time right before he lost his temper. Instead of lashing out, Shrek embraces everyone with a newfound appreciation for family and friends.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], Rumpel is arrested by the villagers and is put in a cage by them as punishment.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2/3|total_width=320\n| image1 = Mike Myers David Shankbone 2010 NYC.jpg|width1=930|height1=1203\n| image2 = Eddie Murphy Tribeca Shankbone 2010 NYC

It is the fourth installment in the [[Shrek (franchise)|''Shrek'' film franchise]] and the sequel to ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' (2007). The film was directed by [[Mike Mitchell (director)|Mike Mitchell]] from a screenplay by [[Josh Klausner]] and [[Darren Lemke]], and stars [[Mike Myers]], [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Cameron Diaz]], [[Antonio Banderas]], [[Julie Andrews]], and [[John Cleese]] reprising their previous roles, with [[Walt Dohrn]] introduced in the role of [[Rumpelstiltskin]]. The plot follows [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] struggling as a family man with no privacy, who yearns for the days when he was once feared. He is tricked by Rumpelstiltskin into signing a contract that allows him to relive his golden age, but comes to realize that it comes alongside disastrous consequences.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] on April 21, 2010, and was theatrically released in the [[United States]] on May 21, 2010 in [[3D film|3D]] and [[IMAX#IMAX 3D|IMAX 3D]] formats. The film debuted as the top-grossing film at the box office, a position it held for three consecutive weeks in the United States and Canada. The film received mixed reviews from critics, but many had considered it an improvement over its predecessor. The film grossed a worldwide total of $752&nbsp;million and becoming the [[2010 in film|fifth-highest-grossing film of 2010]].

The deal is canceled at the last second when a knight informs the King and Queen that [[Princess Fiona]] has been rescued by [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]]. An angry Rumpelstiltskin laments his loss and wishes Shrek was never born.\n\nIn the present time, Shrek has grown steadily weary of being a family man and celebrity among the local villagers, leading him to wish for when he felt like a \"real ogre\" again. When he takes his family to Far Far Away to celebrate his children's first birthday, an escalating series of mishaps further injure his ego, causing him to lose his temper and walk out in anger.\n\nShrek encounters Rumpel, who gives his chance, having observed Shrek's angry outburst. He follows Shrek and arranges for him to appear to save his life. He gives Shrek a day to live like a real ogre, in exchange for a day from his childhood that he would not remember being erased to \"thank\" him. Shrek was tricked by Rumpelstiltskin into signing the contract and suddenly was taken to an [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate reality]] where the events starting from [[Shrek|the first film ]] never happened. Now feared by the villagers, Shrek takes the opportunity to cause some lighthearted mischief until he learns that Fiona is a fugitive, and his swamp is deserted and desolate. He is kidnapped by [[Witchcraft|witches]] and taken to Rumpel, now the King of Far Far Away, which has become derelict.\n\nRumpel reveals that he erased the day that Shrek was born. Therefore, Shrek does not exist, and the King and Queen signed their kingdom over to Rumpelstiltskin, making them disappear. When the day ends, Shrek will disappear as well. Shrek escapes Rumpel's castle with Donkey. Initially terrified of Shrek, Donkey decides to trust him after seeing Shrek cry over his erased history, something he had never seen an ogre do before. Donkey helps him find a hidden exit clause: the contract can be nullified by \"true love's kiss\".\n\nThey soon encounter an army of ogres who are resisting Rumpel, led by a still-cursed Fiona, who keeps [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]] as a lazy, overweight pet. Shrek does everything he can to gain Fiona's love, but she is cynical and disillusioned about the power of true love after no one came to rescue her and is too busy preparing an ambush on Rumpel. While sparring with her, Fiona begins to take a liking to Shrek but stops short of kissing him. Puss encourages him to continue pursuing Fiona.\n\nDuring the ambush, the ogres are captured by the [[Pied Piper of Hamelin|Pied Piper]], though Shrek and Fiona escape with the intervention of Puss and Donkey. Shrek insists Fiona kiss him, saying it will fix everything, but it does not work because Fiona does not truly love him. When he hears that Rumpel is offering a wish to the one who brings him Shrek, Shrek turns himself in and uses the wish to free the other ogres, who storm the castle, battle the witches, and capture Rumpel.\n\nAs the sun rises, Shrek begins to fade from existence, but Fiona, having fallen in love with him, kisses Shrek just before he disappears. As she does not transform in the sunlight, she realizes that her kiss with Shrek has broken her curse as she has assumed \"love's true form\". The alternate reality disintegrates and everyone else disappears as Rumpel is then attacked by vengeful spirits.\n\nShrek finds himself back at his children's birthday party at the time right before he lost his temper. Instead of lashing out, Shrek embraces everyone with a newfound appreciation for family and friends.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], Rumpel is arrested by the villagers and is put in a cage by them as punishment.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2/3|total_width=320\n| image1 = Mike Myers David Shankbone 2010 NYC.jpg|width1=930|height1=1203\n| image2 = Eddie Murphy Tribeca Shankbone 2010 NYC

He eventually became a scout for Gen. [[Anthony Wayne|\"Mad Anthony\" Wayne]]. Capt. Wells was killed by [[Potawatomi]] allied with the British at the [[Battle of Fort Dearborn]] at the outbreak of the [[War of 1812]]. The Potawatomi ate Capt. Wells' heart to gain part of his courage.\n\nThere was also an accident that occurred at the [[clock tower]] of the county courthouse.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} While either fixing or building the roof, a man fell to the grounds of Main Street. He landed on his legs, and he lived for about a week before dying. The force of the fall thrust his [[human pelvis|pelvis]] into his [[rib cage]].

Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= [[Indiana Code]] |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |format=PDF|title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>\n\n'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>\n\n'''Court:''' The county maintains a [[small claims court]] that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name = inc2102/>\n\n'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit court [[Court clerk|clerk]]. Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government.

The best official statement relevant to the most recent era is contained in USAID's 2004 \"White Paper,\" which was reaffirmed in high-level USAID policy documents in 2006 and 2011.  (See the references authored by USAID, at the end of this article.)\n\nTo give a perspective of USAID's goals that is as general as possible, the list of goals in this article subsumes one of the goals from the 2004 White Paper, \"Strengthen fragile states,\" whose emphasis as understood at the time was on Iraq and Afghanistan, into a more general goal, \"U.S. national interests,\" together with one of the White Paper's other goals, \"Support strategic states.\"  State fragility is understood to be one of the development issues addressed under this article's \"Socioeconomic development\" goal.\n\nOn the other hand, the White Paper's goal, \"Provide humanitarian relief,\" is divided in this article into two goals, both of which are humanitarian: \"Disaster relief\" (which may assist victims at various income levels) and \"Poverty relief\" (which targets proverty that is chronic, not just the result of a disaster, and which does not necessarily have to be justified by developmental impact).</ref>\n\n* Disaster relief\n* Poverty relief\n* Technical cooperation on [[global issue]]s, including the environment\n* U.S. bilateral interests\n* Socioeconomic development\n\n===Disaster relief===\n[[File:USAID.jpg|thumb|right|USAID Packages are delivered by [[United States Coast Guard]] personnel]]\n\nSome of the U.S. Government's earliest foreign aid programs provided relief in crises created by war. In 1915, USG assistance through the Commission for Relief of Belgium headed by Herbert Hoover prevented starvation in Belgium after the German invasion.  After 1945, the European Recovery Program championed by Secretary of State George Marshall (the \"[[Marshall Plan]]\") helped rebuild war-torn Western Europe.\n\nUSAID manages relief efforts after wars and natural disasters through its Office of U.S Foreign Disaster Assistance in Washington D.C. Privately funded U.S. NGOs and the U.S. military also play major roles in disaster relief overseas.\n\n===Poverty relief===\n[[File:Early reading and literacy programs contribute to long-term development (7269588282).jpg|thumb|right|Early reading and literacy programs contribute to long-term development, USAID [[Nigeria]]]]\nAfter 1945, many newly independent countries needed assistance to relieve the chronic deprivation afflicting their low-income populations.  USAID and its predecessor agencies have continuously provided poverty relief in many forms, including assistance to public health and education services targeted at the poorest.  USAID has also helped manage food aid provided by the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]].  In addition, USAID provides funding to NGOs to supplement private donations in relieving chronic poverty.\n\n===Global issues===\nTechnical cooperation between nations is essential for addressing a range of cross-border concerns like communicable diseases, environmental issues, trade and investment cooperation, safety standards for traded products, money laundering, and so forth.  The USG has specialized agencies dealing with such areas, such as the Centers for Disease Control and the Environmental Protection Agency.  USAID's special ability to administer programs in low-income countries supports these and other USG agencies' international work on global concerns.\n\n====Environment====\n\nAmong these global interests, environmental issues attract high attention.  USAID assists projects that conserve and protect threatened land, water, forests, and wildlife.  USAID also assists projects to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and to build resilience to the risks associated with global [[climate change]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Global Climate Change: Capacity Building | publisher = [[USAID]] | url = http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/environment/climate/policies_prog/capacity.html | accessdate = 2014-08-07 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120120113701/http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/environment/climate/policies_prog/capacity.html | archivedate = 2012-01-20 }}</ref>  U.S. environmental regulation laws require that programs sponsored by USAID should be both economically and environmentally [[sustainable]].\n\n===U.S. national interests===\nTo support U.S. geopolitical interests, Congress appropriates exceptional financial assistance to allies, largely in the form of \"Economic Support Funds\" (ESF).  USAID is called on to administer the bulk (90%) of ESF<ref>Tarnoff (2015), p. 13.</ref> and is instructed \"To the maximum extent feasible, [to] provide [ESF] assistance ... consistent with the policy directions, purposes, and programs of [development assistance].\"<ref>Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (as amended), Section 531.</ref>\n\nAlso, when U.S. troops are in the field, USAID can supplement the \"[[Civil Affairs]]\" programs that the U.S. military conducts to win the friendship of local populations.  In these circumstances, USAID may be directed by specially appointed diplomatic officials of the State Department, as has been done in Afghanistan and Pakistan during operations against al-Qaeda.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stabilization: Lessons from the U.S. Experience in Afghanistan |url=https://www.sigar.mil/interactive-reports/stabilization/index.html |publisher=SIGAR |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nU.S. commercial interests are served by U.S. law's requirement that most goods and services financed by USAID must be sourced from U.S. vendors.<ref>{{cite web |title=ADS Chapter 310: Source and Nationality Requirements for Procurement of Commodities and Services Financed by USAID |url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1876/310.pdf |publisher=USAID |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Socioeconomic development===\nTo help low-income nations achieve self-sustaining socioeconomic development, USAID assists them in improving management of their own resources.  USAID's assistance for socioeconomic development mainly provides technical advice, training, scholarships, commodities, and financial assistance.  Through grants and contracts, USAID mobilizes the technical resources of the private sector, other USG agencies, universities, and NGOs to participate in this assistance.\n\nPrograms of the various types above frequently reinforce one another.  For example, the Foreign Assistance Act requires USAID to use funds appropriated for geopolitical purposes (\"Economic Support Funds\") to support socioeconomic development to the maximum extent possible.\n\n==Modes of assistance==\nUSAID delivers both technical assistance and financial assistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/primer.html |title=USAID Primer: What We Do and How We Do It |publisher=Usaid.gov |date=2010-12-08 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}</ref>\n\n===Technical assistance===\nTechnical assistance includes technical advice, training, scholarships, construction, and commodities.  Technical assistance is contracted or procured by USAID and provided in-kind to recipients.  For technical advisory services, USAID draws on experts from the private sector, mainly from the assisted country's own pool of expertise, as well as from specialized USG agencies.  Many host-government leaders have drawn on USAID's technical assistance for development of IT systems and computer hardware procurement to strengthen their institutions.\n\nTo build indigenous expertise and leadership, USAID finances scholarships to U.S. universities and assists the strengthening of developing countries' own universities.  Local universities' programs in developmentally important sectors are assisted directly and through USAID support for forming partnerships with U.S. universities.\n\nThe various forms of technical assistance are frequently coordinated as capacity building packages for development of local institutions.\n\n===Financial assistance===\n[[File:National Open Source Software Competition - USAID.jpg|thumb|National Open Source Software Competition \u2013 USAID financial assistance for groups developing technology in Indonesia]]\n\nFinancial assistance supplies cash to developing country organizations to supplement their budgets.  USAID also provides financial assistance to local and international [[NGOs]] who in turn give technical assistance in developing countries.  Although USAID formerly provided loans, all financial assistance is now provided in the form of nonreimbursable grants.\n\nIn recent years, the USG has increased its emphasis on financial rather than technical assistance.  In 2004, the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] Administration created the [[Millennium Challenge Corporation]] as a new foreign aid agency that is mainly restricted to providing financial assistance. In 2009, the Obama Administration initiated a major realignment of USAID's own programs to emphasize financial assistance, referring to it as \"government-to-government\" or \"G2G\" assistance.\n\n==Organization==\n\nUSAID is organized around country development programs managed by resident USAID offices in developing countries (\"USAID missions\"), supported by USAID's global headquarters in Washington, DC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/usaidorg.html |title=USAID: Organization |publisher=Usaid.gov |date=2011-03-04 |accessdate=2011-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423111526/http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/usaidorg.html |archive-date=2011-04-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Country development programs===\nUSAID plans its work in each country around an individual country development program managed by a resident office called a \"mission.\"  The USAID mission and its U.S. staff are guests in the country, with a status that is usually defined by a \"framework bilateral agreement\" between the USG and the host government.<ref>{{cite web|last1=USAID|title=ADS Chapter 349|url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1876/349.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2017|page=Section 349.3.1.1|date=2003}}</ref> Framework bilaterals give the mission and its U.S. staff privileges similar to (but not necessarily the same as) those accorded to the U.S. embassy and diplomats by the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]] of 1961.<ref>{{cite web|last1=USAID|title=ADS Chapter 155|url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1868/155.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2017|page=Section 155.3.1.1.c|date=2004}}</ref>\n\nUSAID missions work in over fifty countries, consulting with their governments and non-governmental organizations to identify programs that will receive USAID's assistance. As part of this process, USAID missions conduct socioeconomic analysis, discuss projects with host-country leaders, design assistance to those projects, award contracts and grants, administer assistance (including evaluation and reporting), and manage flows of funds.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tarnoff|first1=Curt|title=U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID): Background, Operations, and Issues|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R44117.pdf|accessdate=13 June 2017|date=July 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAs countries develop and need less assistance, USAID shrinks and ultimately closes its resident missions.

The length of a Foreign Service Officer's \"tour\" in most countries is four years, to provide enough time to develop in-depth knowledge about the country.  (Shorter tours of one or two years are usual in countries of exceptional hardship or danger.)<ref>{{cite web |title=ADS Chapter 436: Foreign Service Assignments and Tours of Duty |url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1877/436.pdf |publisher=USAID |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Mission Director is a member of the U.S. Embassy's \"Country Team\" under the direction of the U.S. Ambassador.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dorman |first1=Shawn |title=Foreign Service Work and Life: Embassy, Employee, Family |url=http://afsa.org/sites/default/files/iuse_country_team_local_staff_role.pdf |publisher=American Foreign Service Association |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>  As a USAID mission works in an unclassified environment with relative frequent public interaction, most missions were initially located in independent offices in the business districts of capital cities.

However, it soon became necessary for the USG's technical experts to plan and manage larger assistance programs than they could perform by themselves. The global expansion of TA in the early 1950s reinforced the need to draw on outside experts, which was also accelerated by Congress's requirement of major reductions of USG staffing in 1953.  See {{cite book|last1=Richardson|title=Partners in Development|pages=13\u201314, 37}} Also {{cite book|last1=Butterfield|title=U.S. Development Aid|pages=25\u201326}}</ref>  The technical offices that are frequently found in USAID missions include Health and Family Planning, Education, Environment, Democracy, and Economic Growth.\n\n====Health and Family Planning====\n\nExamples of projects assisted by missions' Health and Family Planning offices are projects for eradication of communicable diseases, strengthening of public health systems focusing on maternal-child health including family planning services, [[HIV/AIDS|HIV-AIDS]] monitoring, delivery of medical supplies including contraceptives and [[HIV]] vaccines, and coordination of Demographic and Health Surveys. This assistance is primarily targeted to the poor majority of the population and corresponds to USAID's poverty relief objective, as well as strengthening the basis for socioeconomic development.\n\n====Education====\n\nUSAID's Education offices mainly assist the national school system, emphasizing broadening coverage of quality basic education to reach the entire population. Examples of projects often assisted by Education offices are projects for curriculum development, teacher training, and provision of improved textbooks and materials.  Larger programs have included school construction.  Education offices often manage scholarship programs for training in the U.S., while assistance to the country's universities and professional education institutions may be provided by Economic Growth and Health offices.  The Education office's emphasis on school access for the poor majority of the population corresponds to USAID's poverty relief objective, as well as to the socioeconomic development objective in the long term.\n\n====Environment====\n\nExamples of projects assisted by Environment offices are projects for tropical forest conservation, protection of indigenous people's lands, regulation of marine fishing industries, pollution control, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and helping communities adapt to climate change.  Environment assistance corresponds to USAID's objective of technical cooperation on global issues, as well as laying a sustainable basis for USAID's socioeconomic development objective in the long term.\n\n====Democracy====\nExamples of projects assisted by Democracy offices are projects for the country's political institutions, including elections, political parties, legislatures, and human rights organizations.  Counterparts include the judicial sector and civil-society organizations that monitor government performance.  Democracy assistance received its greatest impetus at the time of the creation of the successor states to the USSR starting in about 1990, corresponding both to USAID's objective of supporting U.S. bilateral interests and to USAID's socioeconomic development objective.\n\n====Economic Growth====\n\nExamples of projects often assisted by Economic Growth offices are projects for improvements in agricultural techniques and marketing (the mission may have a specialized \"Agriculture\" office), development of microfinance industries, streamlining of Customs administrations (to accelerate growth of exporting industries), and modernization of government regulatory frameworks for industry in various sectors (telecommunications, agriculture, and so forth). [[File:USAID Firms Project's Agriculture Marketing Reforms.jpg|thumb|USAID Firms Project's Agriculture Marketing Reforms]] In USAID's early years and in some larger programs, Economic Growth offices have financed economic infrastructure like roads and electrical power plants.  Economic Growth assistance is thus quite diverse in terms of the range of sectors where it may work.  It corresponds to USAID's socioeconomic development objective and is the source of sustainable poverty reduction.  Economic Growth offices also occasionally manage assistance to poverty relief projects, such as to government programs that provide \"cash transfer\" payments to low-income families.\n\n====Special assistance offices====\n\nSome USAID missions have specialized technical offices for areas like counter-narcotics assistance or assistance in conflict zones.\n\nDisaster assistance on a large scale is provided through USAID's [[Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance|Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance]].  Rather than having a permanent presence in country missions, this office has supplies pre-positioned in strategic locations to respond quickly to disasters when and where they occur.<ref>{{cite web|last1=USAID|title=Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance|url=https://www.usaid.gov/who-we-are/organization/bureaus/bureau-democracy-conflict-and-humanitarian-assistance/office-us|accessdate=13 June 2017|date=November 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===The Office of the Mission Director and the Program Office===\nThe Mission Director's signature authorizes technical offices to provide assistance according to the designs and budgets they propose.  With the help of the Program Office, the Mission Director ensures that designs are consistent with USAID policy for the country, including budgetary earmarks by which Washington directs that funds be used for certain general purposes such as public health or environmental conservation.  The Program Office compiles combined reports to Washington to support budget requests to Congress and to verify that budgets were used as planned.\n\n===Contracting, financial management and management offices===\nWhile the Mission Director is the public face and key decision-maker for an impressive array of USAID technical capabilities, arguably the offices that make USAID preeminent among U.S. government agencies in the ability to follow through on assistance agreements in low-income countries are the \"support\" offices.\n\n====Contracting offices====\n\nCommitments of U.S. government funds to NGOs and firms that implement USAID's assistance programs can only be made in compliance with carefully designed contracts and grant agreements executed by warranted Contracting and Agreement Officers.  The Mission Director is authorized to commit financial assistance directly to the country's government agencies.\n\n====Financial management offices====\n\nFunds can be committed only when the Mission's Controller certifies their availability for the stated purpose.  \"FM\" offices assist technical offices in financial analysis and in developing detailed budgets for inputs needed by projects assisted.  They evaluate potential recipients' management abilities before financial assistance can be authorized and then review implementers' expenditure reports with great care.  This office often has the largest number of staff of any office in the mission.\n\n====Management offices====\n\nCalled the \"Executive Office\" in USAID (sometimes leading to confusion with the Embassy's Executive Office, which is the office of the Ambassador), \"EXO\" provides operational support for mission offices, including human resources, information systems management, transportation, property and procurement services. Increasing integration into Embassies' chancery complexes, and the State Department's recently increased role in providing support services to USAID, is expanding the importance of coordination between USAID's EXO and the Embassy's Management section.\n\n==Assistance projects==\nWhile the terms \"assistance project\" and \"development project\" might sometimes be used indiscriminately, it helps in understanding USAID's work to make a distinction.  (1) Development is what developing countries do.  Development projects are projects of local government agencies and NGOs, such as projects to improve public services or business regulations, etc.  (2) Assistance is what USAID does.  USAID's assistance projects support local development projects.\n\nThe key to a successful development project is the institutional capacity of local organizations, including the professional ability of their staff members.  The key to successful assistance is how well it fits the needs of local development projects, including institutional capacity building and supporting professional education and training for staff.\n\nWhen a local development project's assistance needs have been identified, USAID arranges the agreed assistance through funding agreements with implementing organizations, referred to by USAID staff as \"implementing partners.\"  USAID finances several types of implementers using a variety of funding agreements.\n\nTo illustrate, USAID might assist a development project with inputs provided through several different funding agreements:\n\n# A budget-support grant to a government agency.\n# A contract with a firm for support to the agency.\n# A grant to a local NGO serving the beneficiary group.\n# A grant to an international NGO to strengthen the operations of the local NGO.\n\nEach of these types of USAID funding agreements is profiled below.\n\n===Budget support to a government agency===\nThis funding agreement would take the form of a letter from USAID's Mission Director, countersigned by the recipient agency, explaining the agency's objectives, the amount of USAID's financial commitment, the specific expenditures to be financed by USAID's grant, and other operational aspects of the agreement.\n\nUSAID's technical office would assign a staff member (U.S. or local) to oversee progress in the agency's implementation.  USAID's financial management office would transfer funds to the agency, in tranches as needed.  Audit under this kind of government-to-government (G2G) financial assistance is usually performed by the host government's own audit agency.\n\n===Contract for technical assistance to a government agency===\nAs a government agency is usually specialized in services to the beneficiary population (medical services, for example), its staff may not be equipped to undertake planning and evaluation, construction, acquisition of equipment, or management of training and study tours.  The government agency might, therefore, request USAID's assistance in these areas, and USAID could respond by contracting with a firm to supply the services or technical assistance requested.\n\nUSAID's technical office would collaborate with the government agency in drafting the specifications for what is needed (generally referred to as a \"Statement of Work\" for the contract) and in conducting market research for available sources and potential bidders.  USAID's Contracting Officer would then advertise for bids, manage the selection of a contractor from among the competing bidders, sign the contract, and assign a technical-office staff member as the Contracting Officer's Representative to oversee the performance under the contract.  (If the workload permits, this staff member might be the same person who oversees USAID's financial assistance to the government agency.)\n\nThe contractor supplies technical assistance directly to the government agency, so that in monitoring contractor performance USAID relies substantially on the agency's evaluation of the contractor's work.\n\n===Grant to finance NGO services to a beneficiary group===\nNon-governmental organizations are, like their government counterparts, usually already engaged in service provision in areas where USAID wants to assist, and they often have unique abilities that complement public programs.  Therefore, USAID technical-office staff might set aside a budget and, with the help of the mission's contracting office, publish a solicitation for applications from NGOs for financial assistance to their programs.  One or several grants could be made to selected NGOs by the contracting office's \"Agreement Officer.\"  Similar to the case of a contract, a USAID technical-office staff member would be assigned as the Agreement Officer's Representative to monitor progress in the NGOs' implementation and to arrange for external evaluations.  USAID grants require recipient NGOs to contract for external audits.\n\nAs some local NGOs may be small and young organizations with no prior experience in receiving awards from USAID, the USAID mission's financial management office reviews grant applicants' administrative systems to ensure that they are capable of managing USG funds.  Where necessary, USAID can devote part of the grant to the NGO's internal strengthening to help the NGO qualify for USAID's financing and build the capacity of the organization in the process.  Following completion of the NGO's internal strengthening, USAID would disburse financing for the NGO's service project.\n\n===Grant to international NGOs for technical assistance===\nInternational NGOs have their own development projects and capabilities.  If USAID and its counterparts determine that development objectives can best be met by supporting an NGO project, and if local NGO capacity is not yet sufficient, the relevant USAID technical office will draft a program description and the contracting office will issue as a request for applications to solicit responses from the international NGO community.  USAID manages the award and implementation processes in the same way as for local NGOs.\n\nAlso, international NGOs frequently make unsolicited proposals to USAID, requesting funding for their own planned assistance activities.  Where NGOs or business enterprises are dedicating a substantial amount of non-USG resources to their projects, they can receive USAID funding through \"Global Development Alliance\" grants, provided that the non-USG resources are at least equal in value to USAID's grant.\n\nIn general, USAID provides financial assistance to support other organizations' programs when those programs correspond to the areas that USAID wants to support, while USAID uses contracts to procure products or services requested by the leaders of local development projects.\n\n===Other mechanisms===\nIn addition to the types of projects described above, USAID uses various other assistance mechanisms for different U.S. objectives.  Budget agreements with other USG agencies are common in supporting collaboration between the U.S. and other countries on global issues.  Large budget-support grants, referred to as \"non-project\" assistance, may be made to recipient governments to pursue U.S. foreign policy interests.\n\n==History==\nWhen the USG created USAID in November 1961, it built on a legacy of previous development-assistance agencies and their people, budgets, and operating procedures. USAID's predecessor agency was already substantial, with 6,400 U.S. staff in developing-country field missions in 1961.  Except for the peak years of the Vietnam War, 1965\u201370, that was more U.S. field staff than USAID would have in the future, and triple the number USAID has had in field missions in the years since 2000.<ref>Data from USAID reports, \"Distribution of Personnel as of June 30, 1949 thru 1976,\" \"Supporting the USAID Mission, and the \"USAID Staffing Report to Congress\" of 2016.  See full citations in \"References,\" below.</ref>\n\nAlthough the size of the development-assistance effort was not new, the 1961 decision to reorganize the USG's main development-assistance agency was a landmark in terms of institutional evolution, representing the culmination of twenty years' experience with different organizational forms and procedures, in changing foreign-policy environments.\n\nThe new structure created in 1961 \"proved to be sturdy and durable.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Butterfield|title=U.S. Development Aid|page=60}}</ref> In particular, the USG has maintained since then \"the unique American pattern of placing strong resident aid missions in countries that [the U.S. was] helping.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Butterfield|title=U.S. Development Aid|page=37}}</ref>\n\nThe story of how the base for USAID's structure was built is described below, along with an account of changes that have been made since 1961.<ref>A history of all the programs that USAID has supported since 1961, in scores of countries, plus the evolution of USG policies and academic theories about development and development assistance, to say nothing of the development in the low-income countries themselves, would require enough books to fill a library.  For a start, see Samuel Butterfield's ''U.S. Development Aid'' (2004).</ref>\n\n=== Before World War II ===\nThe realization that early industrializers like the United States could provide technical assistance to other countries' development efforts spread gradually in the late 1800s, leading to a substantial number of visits to other countries by U.S. technical experts, generally with official support by the U.S. Government even when the missions were unofficial. [[Japan]], China, Turkey, and several Latin American countries requested missions on subjects like fiscal management, monetary institutions, election management, mining, schooling, roads, flood control, and urban sanitation.  The U.S. Government also initiated missions, particularly to Central America and the Caribbean, when it felt that U.S. interests might be affected by crises like failed elections, debt defaults, or spread of infectious disease.<ref>Merle Curti and Kendall Birr, \"Prelude to Point Four: American Technical Missions Overseas, 1838\u20131938\" (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1954).</ref>\n\nU.S. technical missions in this era were not, however, part of a systematic, USG-supported program.  Possibly the closest approximation to what USG development assistance would become was the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chinafound.org.tw/ec99/eshop1387/e_profile.asp | title=China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture}}</ref> established by the USG in 1924 using funds provided by China as reparations following the \"Boxer\" conflict.  The Foundation's activities ranged widely and included support for development of a leading Chinese university, [[Tsinghua University]].\n\nA notable early example of U.S. Government foreign assistance for disaster relief was its contribution to the 1915 [[Committee for Relief in Belgium]] headed by [[Herbert Hoover]], to prevent starvation in [[Belgium]] after the German invasion.  After World War I in 1919, the USG created the American Relief Administration, also headed by Hoover, which provided food primarily in Eastern Europe.\n\nBetween the two world wars, however,  U.S. assistance in low-income countries was often the product of private initiative, including the work of private foundations such as the Rockefeller Foundation and the Near East Foundation.<ref>For information on the Near East Foundation, see {{cite web|title=Near East Foundation|url=http://www.neareast.org/}}  Also {{cite book|last1=Badeau|first1=John S.|last2=Stevens|first2=G.

Since countries in the region were regularly requesting expert assistance from USG cabinet departments, an Interdepartmental Committee on Cooperation with the American Republics was established in 1938, with the State Department in the chair, to ensure systematic responses.<ref>{{cite web|title=Records of Interdepartmental Committees|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/353.html|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Glick|first1=Philip|title=The Administration of Technical Assistance|date=1957|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|pages=7\u20139}}</ref>\n\nMore ambitiously, the U.S. subsequently created an institution that for the first time would take an active role in development assistance programming: the Institute of Inter-American Affairs (IIAA), chartered in March 1942. The Institute was the initiative of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, Nelson Rockefeller, the future Vice President of the United States, whose family financed the Rockefeller Foundation. IIAA's 1,400 employees provided technical assistance across Central and South America for economic stabilization, food supply, health, and sanitation. U.S. benefits included development of sources for raw materials that had been disrupted by the war.<ref>Erb, Claude (1985). \"Prelude to Point Four: The Institute of Inter-American Affairs\".

On the basis of positive evaluations from the U.S. Ambassadors in Latin America, the State Department succeeded in getting Congressional authorization to extend IIAA, initially through 1950 and then through 1955.<ref>Glick (1957), pp. 26\u201328</ref> Some existing USG technical-assistance agencies continued work in parallel with IIAA.  In particular, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Office of Foreign Agricultural Relations (OFAR) continued to operate separately until 1954.<ref>OFAR was an office in USDA between 1939 and 1953.  In this period, the [[Foreign Agricultural Service]] reported to the Department of State rather than to USDA.

The revised operating procedure was modeled on reforms that had been pioneered by IIAA in March 1951.]</ref>\n\n=== Maturation of American development assistance institutions ===\n\nWhile USG development assistance was institutionalized on a nearly global scale by TCA, strong currents of change in U.S. foreign economic policy during the 1950s affected how development assistance worked and at times called its continued existence into question.  When this process finally resulted in the creation USAID in 1961, USAID continued to use TCA's core mechanism \u2014 providing technical assistance led by in-country resident offices \u2014 and supplemented it with substantial amounts of financial assistance.\n\n==== Post-war foreign aid ====\n\nPoint Four and TCA had been established in the context of a number of other programs in the large-scale U.S. foreign aid effort of the 1940s.<ref>Brown & Opie (1953).</ref> Already during the war, in 1943, the U.S. (jointly with its wartime allies, referred to collectively as \"the United Nations\") established the \"United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration\" ([[UNRRA]]) for war-affected parts of Europe, China, the Philippines, Korea, and Ethiopia.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ninth and Final Financial Report of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration |date=March 1949 |publisher=UNRRA |location=Washington, D.C. |page=25 |hdl=2027/nnc1.cu03384870 }}</ref> Immediately after the war, the USG supplied relief in Germany and Japan, funded by appropriations for \"Government and Relief in Occupied Areas\" ([[GARIOA]]).<ref>Brown & Opie (1953), pp. 108\u2013109.</ref>\n\nRelief was quickly followed by reconstruction assistance.  In 1946, the U.S. created a special financial-assistance program for rehabilitation of war damages in its former possession, the Philippines.<ref>By the program's completion in March 1951, the U.S. had provided $388 million for private property claims and $55 million for public property reconstruction.  (See {{cite book |last1=Waring |first1=Frank A. |last2=Delgado |first2=Francisco A. |last3=O'Donnell |first3=John A. |title=Rehabilitation of the Philippines: Final and Ninth Semiannual Report of the United States Philippine War Damage Commission |date=March 31, 1951 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |location=Washington D.C. |hdl=2027/mdp.39015039449130 }})  The following month, in April 1951, the U.S. and the Philippines signed an agreement for the U.S. to open an aid office (a Special Technical and Economic Mission). (See {{cite book |title=Thirteenth Report to Congress of the Economic Cooperation Administration: Supplement |pages=58\u201365 |hdl=2027/umn.31951d03727992c }})</ref> In 1948, reconstruction assistance was expanded through the [[Marshall Plan]], implemented by the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA), mainly for Western Europe. In the same year, the U.S. and China established the [[Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction]],<ref>Brown & Opie (1953), pp. 341\u2013342.</ref> which, starting on the mainland and continuing for two decades in Taiwan, provided sustained development assistance.\n\nAlso, the [[Fulbright Program]] of academic exchanges was established in 1946, globalizing the wartime program of exchange visits between professionals from Latin America and the United States.\n\nIn contrast to the [[Marshall Plan]], Point Four focussed on technical assistance and provided financial assistance only in limited amounts to support its technical initiatives. In terms of geographic focus, while the two programs mainly operated in different countries, the Marshall Plan also expanded into developing nations.  In particular, the Marshall Plan financed activities in parts of the Middle East, in overseas territories of European allies (principally in Africa), and in \"the general area of China\" (Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Burma, Malaya, Indonesia, and the Philippines), where it operated through Special Technical and Economic Missions (STEMs).  The STEMs were set up in 1950 and 1951, and had a \"Point Four character\" in the sense that they emphasized services by technical experts.<ref>Hayes (1971), pp. 44\u201352.</ref>  Minimizing overlaps with the Marshall Plan, Point Four managed assistance mainly in Latin America (via IIAA), in North Africa and Eritrea, in parts of the Middle East, and in India, Pakistan, and Ceylon.<ref>Brown & Opie (1953), pp. 412\u2013414.</ref>\n\nThe U.S. also participated in post-1945 UN initiatives for technical assistance to developing countries.  Through a series of actions in 1948 and 1949, the UN's General Assembly and Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) created the [[Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance]] (EPTA).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jolly|first1=Richard|last2=Emmerji|first2=Louis|last3=Ghai|first3=Dharam|last4=Lapeyre|first4=Frederic|title=UN Contributions to Development Thinking and Practice|date=2004|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, IN|pages=68\u201373}}</ref>  The U.S. provided 60% of EPTA's financing.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kirdar|first1=\u00dcner|title=The Structure of United Nations Economic-Aid to Underdeveloped Countries|url=https://archive.org/details/structureofunite0000kird|url-access=registration|date=1966|publisher=M. Nijhoff|location=The Hague|page=[https://archive.org/details/structureofunite0000kird/page/60 60]}}</ref> By 1955, EPTA adopted a country-led approach where the UN's TA in each country was programmed according to a plan drawn up by the receiving country in consultation with the UN.  ECOSOC also created a new Technical Assistance Board, which (similarly to the USG's wartime Interdepartmental Committee) coordinated the TA being provided to low-income countries by various individual UN agencies.\n\n==== Korean War ====\n\nCoordination between development assistance and the Marshall Plan was tightened in response to the 1950\u201351 war in Korea.  In October 1951 Congress passed the [[Mutual Security Act]], creating the Mutual Security Agency (MSA), which reported directly to the President and supervised both civilian and military assistance. MSA increased the emphasis on large-scale financial assistance to U.S. allies, which was provided as civilian \"economic assistance\" but was intended to help the allies to make greater military efforts and was therefore often called \"defense support.\"<ref>The name under which Congress appropriates these funds has changed over time, becoming \"Supporting Assistance\" in 1961, \"Security Supporting Assistance\" in 1971, and finally \"Economic Support Funds\" from 1978 to the present. See Nowels (1987), pp. 5\u20136.</ref>\n\nThe Mutual Security Agency absorbed the Marshall Plan (the ECA), which otherwise had been scheduled to end in 1952.  The Technical Cooperation Administration remained a semi-autonomous agency in the State Department to administer Point Four, but after 1951 under the supervision of MSA.<ref>Butterfield (2004), p. 37.</ref> Under this coordinated approach, the policy was adopted that ECA and TCA would not both operate in the same country (\"one country \u2014 one agency\").  Accordingly, each agency transferred programs to the other and closed down in some countries.<ref>Bingham (2004), pp. 262\u2013263.</ref> For example, in Indonesia and Burma, ECA closed its financial-assistance programs, while TCA initiated technical assistance.<ref>{{cite web |title=Oral History Interview with Stanley Andrews |url=https://www.trumanlibrary.org/oralhist/andrewss.htm |publisher=Harry S. Truman Library & Museum |accessdate=22 April 2019 |pages=42\u201344}}</ref>\n\n==== Eisenhower administration ====\n\nIn 1953, the Eisenhower administration took office.  The President's party, which had been out of the White House since 1933,<ref>The only times the Republican Party had a majority in either house in the 48-year span from 1933 to 1981 was when it enjoyed small majorities in both houses of the 80th Congress in 1947\u20131949 under Pres. Truman and both houses of the 83rd Congress 1953\u20131955 under Pres. Eisenhower.</ref> took a critical view of the previous administrations' policies, including both the globalizing policies of the 1940s and the New Deal initiatives of the 1930s.<ref>The New Deal's Tennessee Valley Authority was the model for some major development assistance projects. See Ekbladh (2002).</ref>\n \nAn overall goal of the new administration was to administer the government efficiently and cut spending.<ref>Kaufman (1982), p. 14.</ref> While TCA's technical assistance to developing countries was a small budget item and was considered a long-term program (although fresh funds were appropriated annually), \"economic assistance\" (or \"defense support\") was considered an inherently short-term measure.<ref>Bingham (1953), p. 38.</ref> In place of U.S. economic assistance, the Eisenhower administration proposed that U.S. allies should increasingly finance themselves through their own exports: in other words, through \"trade not aid.\"<ref>Kaufman (1982), ch. 2, pp. 12\u201333.</ref>  With respect to financial assistance for developing countries, the policy was maintained that it should be provided primarily by the U.S. Export-Import Bank and by the World Bank,<ref>U.S. documents of the 1950s usually referred to the World Bank as \"the International Bank.\"</ref> and that it should be available only on commercial terms and primarily to finance private investment.<ref>Glick (1957), pp. 130\u2013136: \"The Relation of Technical Co-operation to Economic Aid.\"</ref>\n\nTo administer the foreign assistance more efficiently, President Eisenhower integrated management into a single agency, the newly created Foreign Operations Administration (FOA).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Eisenhower |first1=Dwight D. |title=Special Message to the Congress on the Organization of the Executive Branch for the Conduct of Foreign Affairs |url=https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/special-message-the-congress-the-organization-the-executive-branch-for-the-conduct-foreign |website=The American Presidency Project |publisher=UC\u2013Santa Barbara |accessdate=26 April 2019 |date=June 1, 1953}}</ref> MSA, TCA (which had been under MSA's direction), and IIAA (which had been part of TCA) were all abolished as of August 1953 and their country offices became \"United States Operations Missions\" (USOMs) under FOA.<ref>Bingham (2004), p. 240.</ref> The President directed other USG agencies to put their technical assistance in developing countries under FOA's management as well. USDA in particular transferred OFAR's programs to FOA, while reconstituting the [[Foreign Agricultural Service]] for the task of building global markets for U.S. farm products.<ref>Glick (1957) p. 49.</ref>\n\nAdministrative functions were consolidated as the various agencies came into FOA, and the Mutual Security Act of July 1953 instructed FOA to reduce personnel by at least 10% within 120 days.<ref>{{cite web|last1=U.S. Government|title=Mutual Security Act of 1953|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-67/pdf/STATUTE-67-Pg152.pdf|at=Section 706(a)|accessdate=21 June 2017|date=July 16, 1953}}</ref> A large number of TCA's senior professionals were summarily dismissed, and FOA's administrator mounted an effort to compensate for lower USG staffing by drawing on experts from U.S. universities and private voluntary organizations.<ref>Ruttan (1996), p. 205.</ref>  The ExIm Bank's lending volume in developing countries was also cut dramatically in 1953.<ref>Kaufman (1982), pp. 29\u201333.</ref>\n\nChanging world events and differences of opinion within the [[Eisenhower]] administration soon altered the administration's cutbacks, however.\n \nFirst, while a \"trade not aid\" strategy required the U.S. to import more goods from its allies, the administration was unable to convince Congress to liberalize import policy.<ref>Kaufman (1982), pp. 37\u201346.</ref>  On the contrary, the main foreign commercial measure taken at this time went in the other direction: the U.S. ramped up subsidies for exports of U.S. agricultural products.  The 1953 amendment to the Mutual Security Act and the much larger Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, known as \"PL-480,\" allowed the U.S. Government to buy U.S. farm surpluses and sell them in developing countries for inconvertible local currencies.<ref>Kaufman (1982), pp. 26\u201329.  Sen. Hubert Humphrey was a prominent supporter of the PL-480 concept.</ref><ref>A currency is \"inconvertible\" when the government forbids it to be used to buy foreign exchange, so that it can only be spent in the country that issues it.</ref> Much of PL-480's foreign-currency revenue was returned to developing countries as a supplement to U.S. development assistance.  PL-480 revenues in the first twenty years were sometimes huge and although PL-480 has become smaller it continues to provide resources to USAID for nutrition and disaster relief programs.<ref>{{cite web|last1=USAID|title=Food Assistance|url=https://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/agriculture-and-food-security/food-assistance|accessdate=19 June 2017|date=2017}}</ref>\n \nSecond, several factors arose that favored large-scale economic assistance to developing countries, especially in Asia. [[South Korea]] needed massive economic assistance after an armistice was finally signed in July 1953,<ref>Mason, Kim ''et al''. (1980), chapter 6.</ref> and U.S. economic assistance to South Vietnam increased after the retreat of France in 1954.<ref>Ruttan (1996), pp. 259\u2013260.</ref>  On a global scale, the Cold War after the death of Joseph Stalin in March 1953 evolved in the direction of rivalry over influence in low-income countries who were seeking financing for their development initiatives. India was a particular case of a country where the U.S. felt it needed to provide economic assistance to balance the USSR's influence, even though India was not a U.S. military ally.<ref>Ruttan (1996), pp. 72\u201373.</ref>  These considerations led to advocacy of expanded economic assistance by several voices within the Eisenhower administration: the FOA Director, former Minnesota Governor Harold Stassen; C.D. Jackson, from the Time-Life publishing business (who draw on advice from MIT economists Millikan and Rostow); the State Department; and the National Security Council.\n \nAs a result, the USG took several steps in the course of 1954 and 1955 to raise the profile of development assistance.\n\nIn June 1954, the USG raised the ExIm Bank's lending authority from $4.5 billion to $5 billion.<ref>Kaufman (1982), p. 32.</ref>  Pres. Eisenhower also created in December 1954 a Cabinet-level Council on Foreign Economic Policy,<ref>Kaufman (1982), p. 37.</ref> which in March 1955 recommended expanded soft loans for development.

See Ruttan (1996), pp. 89\u201391.</ref> Personnel changes soon reflected this change in the administration's view: Christian Herter succeeded Herbert Hoover Jr. as Under Secretary of State in February 1957, Robert Anderson succeeded George Humphrey as Treasury Secretary in July 1957, and James H. Smith Jr. replaced John Hollister as ICA Director in September 1957.<ref>Haviland (1958), pp. 690, 691, 696.</ref>\n \nPres. Eisenhower summarized the conclusions in his May 21, 1957 message to Congress: \"This past year ... Congressional Committees, the Executive Branch and distinguished private citizens have just examined these programs anew. ... I recommend the following legislative actions: ... economic development assistance should be provided primarily through loans, on a continuing basis, and related closely to technical assistance. ... I recommend a clear separation of military and defense support assistance on the one hand, from economic development assistance on the other. ... I recommend that longterm [sic] development assistance be provided from a Development Loan Fund. ... Such loans should not compete with or replace such existing sources of credit as private investors, the International Bank [the World Bank], or the Export-Import Bank. ... I believe the Fund should be established and administered in the International Cooperation Administration. ... The technical cooperation program is one of the most valuable elements of our entire mutual security effort. It also should be continued on a long-term basis and must be closely related to the work of the Fund.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Eisenhower |first1=Dwight D. |title=Special Message to the Congress on the Mutual Security Programs |date=May 21, 1957 |url=https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/special-message-the-congress-the-mutual-security-programs |website=The American Presidency Project |publisher=UC-\u2013Santa Barbara |accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref>\n \nAs a result, the Development Loan Fund was established in August 1957. The DLF largely financed infrastructure (such as railroads, highways, and power plants), factories, and agriculture with loans whose terms were relatively \"soft\" in the sense of charging interest rates lower than commercial levels and being repayable in local currency rather than U.S. dollars.<ref>Local-currency repayments were adjusted when exchange rates changed to maintain their value in terms of U.S. dollars.</ref> Some projects were financed by a combination of a DLF soft loan and a harder World Bank loan.<ref>{{cite web|last1=USAID|title=Terminal Report of the Development Loan Fund|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pdabc787.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2017|pages=3\u20134|date=1962}}</ref> Operationally, the DLF became administratively self-contained by 1959 after contracting for administrative support from ICA for its first two years.<ref>Terminal Report of the DLF, p. 6.</ref> Also, the Export-Import Bank's lending limit was raised in 1958 from $5 billion to $7 billion,<ref>Kaufman (1982), p. 167</ref> and the administration advocated in January 1959 an expanded \"food for peace\" program.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Eisenhower |first1=Dwight D. |title=Special Message to the Congress on Agriculture |url=https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/special-message-the-congress-agriculture-3 |date=January 29, 1959 |website=The American Presidency Project |publisher=UC\u2013Santa Barbara |accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe overall trend in USG development-assistance activity in the 1950s is indicated by the change in the number of U.S. staff in field missions, which during Pres. Eisenhower's years in office from 1953 to 1961 rose from 2,839 to 6,387.<ref name=\"USAID 1976\">Data from USAID, \"Distribution of Personnel as of June 30, 1949 thru 1976.\"</ref>\n\n==== Multilateral Initiatives ====\n\nAs the U.S. expanded its development-assistance efforts in the course of the 1950s, other industrial countries were recovering economically from World War II and were increasingly able to engage in development assistance.  The U.S. supported their involvement through several multilateral initiatives.\n\nThree of these initiatives expanded World Bank facilities.\n\nIn November 1954, the U.S. decided to endorse the World Bank's proposed International Finance Corporation, which would raise funds from global capital markets to lend to the private sector in developing countries.<ref>Kaufman (1982), pp. 46\u201349.</ref> The IFC was finally established in 1956.\n\nWith Senator [[Mike Monroney]] playing a prominent role, Congress approved in July 1958 another new World Bank facility, the International Development Association (IDA).  Funded by grants from industrialized countries, the IDA would make low-interest credits to developing countries for projects like public works.  The IDA formally came into being in September 1960, with the U.S. contributing 42% of its initial resources.<ref>Mason, Edward; Asher, Robert (1973). ''The World Bank Since Bretton Woods''. Washington, DC: The Brookings Institution. pp. 381\u2013389.</ref><ref>[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/IDA/Resources/ida-articlesofagreement.pdf International Development Association. \"Articles of Agreement, Schedule A\"]\nIDA-articlesofagreement.pdf. Retrieved 16 September 2018.</ref>\n\nAlso in 1958, the USG proposed doubling industrialized countries' contributions to the World Bank, raising the Bank's capitalization from $10 billion to $21 billion in September 1959.<ref>Kapur, D., Lewis, J. P, & Webb, R. Charles. (1997). ''The World Bank : its first half century'' (Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution), p. 929.</ref>\n\nWhile the U.S. supported expanded World Bank facilities, it did not support the proposal for a Special UN Fund for Economic Development (SUNFED). The UN did create a \"Special Fund\" in 1957, but it was limited to designing projects for the UN's technical assistance program, EPTA, and could not finance public works.<ref>Jolly ''et al.'' (2004), pp. 73\u201383.</ref>\n\nThe U.S. also adopted a regional initiative with [[Latin America]].  Through most of the 1950s, the U.S. concentrated on technical assistance in the region.  Financial assistance sources were limited to the Eximbank and the World Bank, with the U.S. opposing proposals for a regional development bank.  However, events in 1958 \u2014 notably a riot during Vice President Nixon's visit to [[Caracas, Venezuela]] in May 1958 \u2014 resulted in a reversal of the U.S. position in August 1958.  With U.S. support, the Organization of American States created in April 1959 the Inter-American Development Bank, most of whose capital was contributed by the borrowing countries.<ref>Kaufman (1982), p. 161-162.</ref>\n\nTo further engage other wealthy countries in development assistance, the USG supported the creation of the Aid India Consortium in August 1958. This was the first of several informal groupings of donors focussing on particular countries.\n\nThe USG also supported the Organization of European Economic Co-operation (the European Marshall Plan organization) in creating a Development Assistance Group in January 1960.<ref>{{cite web |last1=OECD |title=DAC in Dates: The History of OECD's Development Assistance Committee |url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/1896808.pdf |accessdate=16 September 2018 |date=2006}} As the organization broadened its membership and became the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ([[OECD]]) in 1961, the Development Assistance Group was re-named the [[Development Assistance Committee]], or DAC.</ref>\n\n=== Creation of USAID and the Development Decade ===\nAt the end of the 1950s, the momentum in favor of development assistance\u2014as represented by PL-480, new mechanisms for financial assistance, larger U.S. budgets and staffing, and multilateral initiatives\u2014picked up support from Senator John F. Kennedy, who was preparing to be a candidate for the presidency. In 1957, JFK proposed, in bipartisan collaboration with Sen. John Sherman Cooper (a former U.S. Ambassador to India), a major expansion of U.S. economic support for India. As a candidate in 1960, he supported the emphasis on humanitarian goals for PL-480 set by Sen. Hubert Humphrey's \"Food for Peace\" Act of 1959<ref>Ruttan (1996), pp. 156\u2013159.</ref> and supported the idea of a [[Peace Corps]] that was under development thanks to the initiatives of Sen. Humphrey, Rep. Reuss, and Sen. Neuberger.  {{Crossreference| (See the \"History\" section of [[Peace Corps]].)}}<ref>Until 1973, USAID and its predecessors also supported [[International Voluntary Services]], which was founded in 1953.

On March 22, he sent a special message to Congress on foreign aid, asserting that the 1960s should be a \"Decade of Development\" and proposing to unify U.S. development assistance administration into a single agency.  He sent a proposed \"Act for International Development\" to Congress in May and the resulting \"Foreign Assistance Act\" was approved in September, repealing the Mutual Security Act.  In November, Pres. Kennedy signed the act and issued an Executive Order tasking the Secretary of State to create, within the State Department, the \"Agency for International Development\" (or A.I.D.: subsequently re-branded as USAID),<ref>The names of predecessor agencies often continued in popular usage.  In Vietnam in the 1960s, it was common to refer to A.I.D.'s office as \"USOM,\" while in Peru A.I.D. telephone operators continued in the 1960s to answer calls saying \"Punto Cuatro\" (Point Four).</ref> as the successor to both ICA and the Development Loan Fund.<ref>In 1966, the UN would also integrate its EPTA and the Special Fund into a new agency, the UN Development Program, or UNDP.</ref>\n\nWith these actions, the U.S. created a permanent agency working with administrative autonomy under the policy guidance of the State Department to implement, through resident field missions, a global program of both technical and financial development assistance for low-income countries. This structure has continued to date.<ref>The Fulbright educational and cultural exchange program was also strengthened by the Fulbright-Hays Act in September 1961.</ref>\n\nTaking this momentum onto the world stage via an address to the UN General Assembly in September 1961, Pres. Kennedy called for a \"United Nations Decade of Development.\" This initiative was endorsed by a General Assembly resolution in December, establishing the concepts of development and development assistance as global priorities.\n\n=== \"New Directions\" in the 1970s ===\nIn the late 1960s, foreign aid became one of the focal points in Legislative-Executive differences over the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>Ruttan (1996). pp. 107\u2013108.</ref>  In September 1970, [[Richard M.

Specifically, USAID's budget would be reformed to account for expenditures for each of these Basic Human Needs, a system referred to as \"functional accounts.\" (Previously, budgets had been divided between categories such as \"development loans, technical assistance, [[Alliance for Progress]] [for Latin America], loans and grants, and population.\")<ref>Ruttan (1996).  pp. 94, 98\u2013100, 543 fn. 2.</ref> The new system was based on a proposal developed by a bipartisan group of House members and staff working with USAID management and outside advisors.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Butterfield|title=U.S. Development Aid|pages=177\u2013179}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Pastor|first1=Robert A.|title=Congress and the Politics of U.S. Foreign Economic Policy 1929\u20131976|date=1980|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA|isbn=0-520-03904-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/congresspolitics0000past/page/278 278\u2013279]|url=https://archive.org/details/congresspolitics0000past/page/278}}</ref> President Nixon signed the New Directions act into law (PL 93-189) in December 1973.\n\nAlso in 1973, the \"Percy Amendment\" of the Foreign Assistance Act required U.S. development assistance to integrate women into its programs, leading to USAID's creation of its Women in Development (WID) office in 1974. However, the [[Helms Amendment]] of 1973 banned use of U.S. Government funds for abortion as a method of family planning, which effectively required USAID to eliminate all support for abortion.<ref name=\"usaidweb1\">USAID Public website [http://transition.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/pop/restrictions.html USAID's Family Planning Guiding Principles and U.S. Legislative and Policy Requirements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329101241/http://transition.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/pop/restrictions.html |date=2013-03-29 }} Retrieved September 10, 2012</ref>\n\nA further amendment of the Foreign Assistance Act in 1974 prohibited assistance for police, thus ending USAID's involvement in Public Safety programs in Latin America, which in the 1960s were, along with the Vietnam War, part of the U.S. Government's anti-Communist strategy.\n\nThe reforms also ended the practice of the 1960s and 1970s in which many USAID officers in Latin America and Southeast Asia had worked in joint offices led by State Department diplomats or in units with U.S. military personnel.\n\nThe Basic Human Needs reforms largely cut off USAID's assistance to higher education.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Guither |first1=Harold D. |title=The Famine Prevention and Freedom from Hunger Amendment: Issues and Compromises in International Development Policymaking |journal=Illinois Agricultural Economics |date=July 1977 |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.2307/1348954 |jstor=1348954 }}</ref><ref>See also Congressional Research Service (1981), material found via search string \"higher education\".</ref>  A large part of that assistance had gone to agricultural universities in hungry developing countries, as illustrated by a 1974 book by a University of Illinois professor, Hadley Read, describing USAID-supported U.S. land-grant universities' work in building India's agricultural universities.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Read |first1=Hadley |title=Partners With India: Building Agricultural Universities |date=1974 |publisher=University of Illinois |location=Urbana-Champaign}}</ref> Read's book inspired an Illinois Member of Congress concerned with famine prevention, Paul Findley, to draft a bill authorizing more support for programs like the ones Read described.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Findley |first1=Paul |title=Interview with Paul Findley: Transcript |url=https://www.illinois.gov/alplm/library/collections/oralhistory/illinoisstatecraft/general/Documents/FindleyPaul/Findley_Pau_4FNL.pdf |publisher=Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library |accessdate=13 June 2018 |pages=158\u2013161 |date=2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115133153/https://www.illinois.gov/alplm/library/collections/oralhistory/illinoisstatecraft/general/Documents/FindleyPaul/Findley_Pau_4FNL.pdf |archive-date=2017-11-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In a legislative process involving USAID staff, the association of state universities and land-grant colleges (NASULGC), and Sen.

Title XII created the [[Board for International Food and Agricultural Development (BIFAD)]], with seven members representing U.S. universities and agricultural technology institutions who advise USAID on Title XII implementation.\n\nThe impact of all these actions of the early 1970s on the overall scale of U.S. development assistance is indicated by the change in the number of U.S. staff in field missions.  In 1969, the year when Pres. Nixon took office, the number was already decreasing from its Vietnam War high of 8,717 and had reached 7,701.

However, although IDCA was established by Executive Order in September 1979, it did not in practice make USAID independent.\n\nIn 1995, legislation to abolish USAID was introduced by Senator [[Jesse Helms]], the Chairman of the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]], who aimed to replace USAID with a grant-making foundation.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/16/world/helms-seeks-to-merge-foreign-policy-agencies.html | work=The New York Times | first=Steven | last=Greenhouse | title=Helms Seeks to Merge Foreign Policy Agencies | date=March 16, 1995}}</ref>  Although the House of Representatives passed a bill abolishing USAID, the measure did not become law.

Once a critical mass of users was reached they would change the content to spark political dissent and mobilize the users into organized political gatherings called 'smart mobs' that would trigger an uprising against the Cuban government.<ref name=\"Associated Press\"/>\n\nThe messaging service was launched in 2010 and gained 40,000 followers at its peak.

That operation involved contracting Venezuelan, Costa Rican and Peruvian youngsters to contact Cubans who could be recruited into anti-regime political activities.

''[[The Guardian]]'' criticized the operation as possibly undermining US efforts to work toward improving health globally.<ref name=TheGuardianCuba />\n\nThe travelers operation was also criticized for putting the operatives themselves at risk. After [[Alan Gross]], a development specialist and USAID subcontractor was arrested in Cuba, the US government warned USAID about the safety of covert operatives.

Debates of this kind are arbitrated in Washington by Congress and the Administration before budgets are decided and before USAID staff undertake detailed programming in the field.  The result is normally that USAID's programs in a given country pursue a mix of goals.\n\n===Modes of assistance===\nSome feel that USAID overemphasizes technical assistance and should instead provide more financial assistance (budget support, or debt relief).  They argue that financial assistance allows recipients to spend as they like with less influence from donors.  Others feel that financial assistance does not result in durable improvements and that person-to-person technical assistance has the advantage of sharing knowledge and experience, leading to permanent improvements.\n\nIn practice, many USAID missions find that their counterparts appreciate having both forms of aid: an assistance package that includes some financial assistance for things that can simply be bought and some technical assistance to confront problems and issues whose solutions are not so clear.\n\n===Cost of delivering assistance===\nUSAID is frequently criticized for providing expensive expert services to counterparts.  The majority of the staff that USAID finances are from the country itself, but USAID is also able to recruit internationally when necessary to meet the counterpart's needs.  USAID uses competition to arrive at market rates for the staff it recruits, and has experimented with volunteer programs for expertise from high paid professions.\n\n===Non-career contracts===\nUSAID frequently contracts with private firms or individuals for specialist services lasting from a few weeks to several years.  It has long been asked whether USAID should more often assign such tasks to career U.S. Government employees instead.  USG staff directly performed technical assistance in the earliest days of the program in the 1940s.  However, it soon became necessary for the USG's technical experts to plan and manage larger assistance programs than they could perform by themselves. The global expansion of TA in the early 1950s reinforced the need to draw on outside experts, which was also accelerated by Congress's requirement of major reductions of USG staffing in 1953.  By 1955, observers commented on a perceived shift towards more use of shorter-term contracts (rather than using employees with career-length contracts).<ref>See {{cite book|last1=Richardson|title=Partners in Development|pages=13\u201314, 37}} Also {{cite book|last1=Butterfield|title=U.S. Development Aid|pages=25\u201326}}</ref>\n\n===Anti-government programs===\nIn situations where the U.S. is hostile to the government of a country, USAID may be asked to undertake programs that the government would not accept and thus to operate without the government's knowledge.  This might include USAID support for opposition political movements that seek to remove the government.  Such \"political aid\" is criticized by some as being incompatible with USAID's role as an assistance or cooperation agency and as exposing USAID staff worldwide to the suspicion of being covertly engaged in subversion.  Similarly, USAID's participation in actions against foreign governments led by the U.S. military is criticized by some as inappropriate and as exposing USAID civilian staff to the dangers of military combat.  However, such political aid and joint civilian-military programs are supported by others as necessary to support U.S. geopolitical interests and to build democracy.\n\n===Economic interests===\nUSAID states that \"U.S. foreign assistance has always had the twofold purpose of furthering America's foreign policy interests in expanding democracy and free markets while improving the lives of the citizens of the developing world.\" However, non-government organization watch groups have noted that as much as 40% of aid to Afghanistan has found its way back to donor countries through awarding contracts at inflated costs.<ref>Richard Norton-Taylor [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/25/afghanistan.internationalaidanddevelopment1 40% of Afghan aid returns to donor countries, says report] ''guardian.co.uk'' 25 March 2008</ref>\n\nAlthough USAID officially selects contractors on a competitive and objective basis, watch dog groups, politicians, foreign governments and corporations have occasionally accused the agency of allowing its bidding process to be unduly influenced by the political and financial interests of its current Presidential administration.

The papers read that although the \"pattern of weak party discipline is found across the political spectrum, it is somewhat less true of parties on the liberal left, such as the [ruling] [[Worker's Party (Brazil)|Worker's Party]].\" The papers also expressed a concern about the \"'indigenization' of the conference so that it is not viewed as providing a U.S. perspective.\" The event's main sponsor was the [[International Republican Institute]].<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/brasil/ult96u424786.shtml |title=''EUA tentaram influenciar reforma pol\u00edtica do Brasil'' |publisher=.folha.uol.com.br |date= |accessdate=2013-05-27}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 2012, [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas|ALBA]] countries (Venezuela, Cuba, Ecuador, Bolivia,  Nicaragua, San Vicente y Las Granadinas, Dominica, Antigua y Barbuda) called on its members to expel USAID from their countries.<ref>[http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/7069 ALBA Expels USAID from Member Countries] Retrieved 2012-09-16</ref>\n\n===Influence on the United Nations===\nSeveral studies{{Which|date=April 2016}} suggest that foreign aid is used as a political weapon for the U.S. to elicit desired actions from other nations.

With a budget of over $27 billion, USAID is one of the [[List of development aid country donors|largest official aid agencies]] in the world, and accounts for more than half of all U.S. foreign assistance\u2014the highest in the world in absolute dollar terms.\n\nCongress passed the [[Foreign Assistance Act]] on September 4, 1961, which reorganized U.S. foreign assistance programs and mandated the creation of an agency to administer economic aid. USAID was subsequently established by the [[executive order]] of President [[John F. Kennedy]], who sought to unite several existing foreign assistance organizations and programs under one agency.<ref>{{cite web|title=USAID HISTORY|url=https://www.usaid.gov/who-we-are/usaid-history|website=usaid.gov|publisher=USAID|accessdate=8 January 2018}}</ref> USAID became the first U.S. foreign assistance organization whose primary focus was long-term socioeconomic development.\n\nUSAID's programs are authorized by Congress in the [[Foreign Assistance Act]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/policy/ads/400/fsa.pdf |title=USAID: Automated Directives System 400 |date= |accessdate=2013-05-27}}</ref> which Congress supplements through directions in annual funding appropriation acts and other legislation.

The best official statement relevant to the most recent era is contained in USAID's 2004 \"White Paper,\" which was reaffirmed in high-level USAID policy documents in 2006 and 2011.  (See the references authored by USAID, at the end of this article.)\n\nTo give a perspective of USAID's goals that is as general as possible, the list of goals in this article subsumes one of the goals from the 2004 White Paper, \"Strengthen fragile states,\" whose emphasis as understood at the time was on Iraq and Afghanistan, into a more general goal, \"U.S. national interests,\" together with one of the White Paper's other goals, \"Support strategic states.\"  State fragility is understood to be one of the development issues addressed under this article's \"Socioeconomic development\" goal.\n\nOn the other hand, the White Paper's goal, \"Provide humanitarian relief,\" is divided in this article into two goals, both of which are humanitarian: \"Disaster relief\" (which may assist victims at various income levels) and \"Poverty relief\" (which targets proverty that is chronic, not just the result of a disaster, and which does not necessarily have to be justified by developmental impact).</ref>\n\n* Disaster relief\n* Poverty relief\n* Technical cooperation on [[global issue]]s, including the environment\n* U.S. bilateral interests\n* Socioeconomic development\n\n===Disaster relief===\n[[File:USAID.jpg|thumb|right|USAID Packages are delivered by [[United States Coast Guard]] personnel]]\n\nSome of the U.S. Government's earliest foreign aid programs provided relief in crises created by war. In 1915, USG assistance through the Commission for Relief of Belgium headed by Herbert Hoover prevented starvation in Belgium after the German invasion.  After 1945, the European Recovery Program championed by Secretary of State George Marshall (the \"[[Marshall Plan]]\") helped rebuild war-torn Western Europe.\n\nUSAID manages relief efforts after wars and natural disasters through its Office of U.S Foreign Disaster Assistance in Washington D.C. Privately funded U.S. NGOs and the U.S. military also play major roles in disaster relief overseas.\n\n===Poverty relief===\n[[File:Early reading and literacy programs contribute to long-term development (7269588282).jpg|thumb|right|Early reading and literacy programs contribute to long-term development, USAID [[Nigeria]]]]\nAfter 1945, many newly independent countries needed assistance to relieve the chronic deprivation afflicting their low-income populations.  USAID and its predecessor agencies have continuously provided poverty relief in many forms, including assistance to public health and education services targeted at the poorest.  USAID has also helped manage food aid provided by the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]].  In addition, USAID provides funding to NGOs to supplement private donations in relieving chronic poverty.\n\n===Global issues===\nTechnical cooperation between nations is essential for addressing a range of cross-border concerns like communicable diseases, environmental issues, trade and investment cooperation, safety standards for traded products, money laundering, and so forth.  The USG has specialized agencies dealing with such areas, such as the Centers for Disease Control and the Environmental Protection Agency.  USAID's special ability to administer programs in low-income countries supports these and other USG agencies' international work on global concerns.\n\n====Environment====\n\nAmong these global interests, environmental issues attract high attention.  USAID assists projects that conserve and protect threatened land, water, forests, and wildlife.  USAID also assists projects to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and to build resilience to the risks associated with global [[climate change]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Global Climate Change: Capacity Building | publisher = [[USAID]] | url = http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/environment/climate/policies_prog/capacity.html | accessdate = 2014-08-07 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120120113701/http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/environment/climate/policies_prog/capacity.html | archivedate = 2012-01-20 }}</ref>  U.S. environmental regulation laws require that programs sponsored by USAID should be both economically and environmentally [[sustainable]].\n\n===U.S. national interests===\nTo support U.S. geopolitical interests, Congress appropriates exceptional financial assistance to allies, largely in the form of \"Economic Support Funds\" (ESF).  USAID is called on to administer the bulk (90%) of ESF<ref>Tarnoff (2015), p. 13.</ref> and is instructed \"To the maximum extent feasible, [to] provide [ESF] assistance ... consistent with the policy directions, purposes, and programs of [development assistance].\"<ref>Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (as amended), Section 531.</ref>\n\nAlso, when U.S. troops are in the field, USAID can supplement the \"[[Civil Affairs]]\" programs that the U.S. military conducts to win the friendship of local populations.  In these circumstances, USAID may be directed by specially appointed diplomatic officials of the State Department, as has been done in Afghanistan and Pakistan during operations against al-Qaeda.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stabilization: Lessons from the U.S. Experience in Afghanistan |url=https://www.sigar.mil/interactive-reports/stabilization/index.html |publisher=SIGAR |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nU.S. commercial interests are served by U.S. law's requirement that most goods and services financed by USAID must be sourced from U.S. vendors.<ref>{{cite web |title=ADS Chapter 310: Source and Nationality Requirements for Procurement of Commodities and Services Financed by USAID |url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1876/310.pdf |publisher=USAID |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Socioeconomic development===\nTo help low-income nations achieve self-sustaining socioeconomic development, USAID assists them in improving management of their own resources.  USAID's assistance for socioeconomic development mainly provides technical advice, training, scholarships, commodities, and financial assistance.  Through grants and contracts, USAID mobilizes the technical resources of the private sector, other USG agencies, universities, and NGOs to participate in this assistance.\n\nPrograms of the various types above frequently reinforce one another.  For example, the Foreign Assistance Act requires USAID to use funds appropriated for geopolitical purposes (\"Economic Support Funds\") to support socioeconomic development to the maximum extent possible.\n\n==Modes of assistance==\nUSAID delivers both technical assistance and financial assistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/primer.html |title=USAID Primer: What We Do and How We Do It |publisher=Usaid.gov |date=2010-12-08 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}</ref>\n\n===Technical assistance===\nTechnical assistance includes technical advice, training, scholarships, construction, and commodities.  Technical assistance is contracted or procured by USAID and provided in-kind to recipients.  For technical advisory services, USAID draws on experts from the private sector, mainly from the assisted country's own pool of expertise, as well as from specialized USG agencies.  Many host-government leaders have drawn on USAID's technical assistance for development of IT systems and computer hardware procurement to strengthen their institutions.\n\nTo build indigenous expertise and leadership, USAID finances scholarships to U.S. universities and assists the strengthening of developing countries' own universities.  Local universities' programs in developmentally important sectors are assisted directly and through USAID support for forming partnerships with U.S. universities.\n\nThe various forms of technical assistance are frequently coordinated as capacity building packages for development of local institutions.\n\n===Financial assistance===\n[[File:National Open Source Software Competition - USAID.jpg|thumb|National Open Source Software Competition \u2013 USAID financial assistance for groups developing technology in Indonesia]]\n\nFinancial assistance supplies cash to developing country organizations to supplement their budgets.  USAID also provides financial assistance to local and international [[NGOs]] who in turn give technical assistance in developing countries.  Although USAID formerly provided loans, all financial assistance is now provided in the form of nonreimbursable grants.\n\nIn recent years, the USG has increased its emphasis on financial rather than technical assistance.  In 2004, the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] Administration created the [[Millennium Challenge Corporation]] as a new foreign aid agency that is mainly restricted to providing financial assistance. In 2009, the Obama Administration initiated a major realignment of USAID's own programs to emphasize financial assistance, referring to it as \"government-to-government\" or \"G2G\" assistance.\n\n==Organization==\n\nUSAID is organized around country development programs managed by resident USAID offices in developing countries (\"USAID missions\"), supported by USAID's global headquarters in Washington, DC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/usaidorg.html |title=USAID: Organization |publisher=Usaid.gov |date=2011-03-04 |accessdate=2011-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423111526/http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/usaidorg.html |archive-date=2011-04-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Country development programs===\nUSAID plans its work in each country around an individual country development program managed by a resident office called a \"mission.\"  The USAID mission and its U.S. staff are guests in the country, with a status that is usually defined by a \"framework bilateral agreement\" between the USG and the host government.<ref>{{cite web|last1=USAID|title=ADS Chapter 349|url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1876/349.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2017|page=Section 349.3.1.1|date=2003}}</ref> Framework bilaterals give the mission and its U.S. staff privileges similar to (but not necessarily the same as) those accorded to the U.S. embassy and diplomats by the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]] of 1961.<ref>{{cite web|last1=USAID|title=ADS Chapter 155|url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1868/155.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2017|page=Section 155.3.1.1.c|date=2004}}</ref>\n\nUSAID missions work in over fifty countries, consulting with their governments and non-governmental organizations to identify programs that will receive USAID's assistance.

However, it soon became necessary for the USG's technical experts to plan and manage larger assistance programs than they could perform by themselves. The global expansion of TA in the early 1950s reinforced the need to draw on outside experts, which was also accelerated by Congress's requirement of major reductions of USG staffing in 1953.  See {{cite book|last1=Richardson|title=Partners in Development|pages=13\u201314, 37}} Also {{cite book|last1=Butterfield|title=U.S. Development Aid|pages=25\u201326}}</ref>  The technical offices that are frequently found in USAID missions include Health and Family Planning, Education, Environment, Democracy, and Economic Growth.\n\n====Health and Family Planning====\n\nExamples of projects assisted by missions' Health and Family Planning offices are projects for eradication of communicable diseases, strengthening of public health systems focusing on maternal-child health including family planning services, [[HIV/AIDS|HIV-AIDS]] monitoring, delivery of medical supplies including contraceptives and [[HIV]] vaccines, and coordination of Demographic and Health Surveys. This assistance is primarily targeted to the poor majority of the population and corresponds to USAID's poverty relief objective, as well as strengthening the basis for socioeconomic development.\n\n====Education====\n\nUSAID's Education offices mainly assist the national school system, emphasizing broadening coverage of quality basic education to reach the entire population. Examples of projects often assisted by Education offices are projects for curriculum development, teacher training, and provision of improved textbooks and materials.  Larger programs have included school construction.  Education offices often manage scholarship programs for training in the U.S., while assistance to the country's universities and professional education institutions may be provided by Economic Growth and Health offices.  The Education office's emphasis on school access for the poor majority of the population corresponds to USAID's poverty relief objective, as well as to the socioeconomic development objective in the long term.\n\n====Environment====\n\nExamples of projects assisted by Environment offices are projects for tropical forest conservation, protection of indigenous people's lands, regulation of marine fishing industries, pollution control, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and helping communities adapt to climate change.  Environment assistance corresponds to USAID's objective of technical cooperation on global issues, as well as laying a sustainable basis for USAID's socioeconomic development objective in the long term.\n\n====Democracy====\nExamples of projects assisted by Democracy offices are projects for the country's political institutions, including elections, political parties, legislatures, and human rights organizations.  Counterparts include the judicial sector and civil-society organizations that monitor government performance.  Democracy assistance received its greatest impetus at the time of the creation of the successor states to the USSR starting in about 1990, corresponding both to USAID's objective of supporting U.S. bilateral interests and to USAID's socioeconomic development objective.\n\n====Economic Growth====\n\nExamples of projects often assisted by Economic Growth offices are projects for improvements in agricultural techniques and marketing (the mission may have a specialized \"Agriculture\" office), development of microfinance industries, streamlining of Customs administrations (to accelerate growth of exporting industries), and modernization of government regulatory frameworks for industry in various sectors (telecommunications, agriculture, and so forth). [[File:USAID Firms Project's Agriculture Marketing Reforms.jpg|thumb|USAID Firms Project's Agriculture Marketing Reforms]] In USAID's early years and in some larger programs, Economic Growth offices have financed economic infrastructure like roads and electrical power plants.  Economic Growth assistance is thus quite diverse in terms of the range of sectors where it may work.  It corresponds to USAID's socioeconomic development objective and is the source of sustainable poverty reduction.  Economic Growth offices also occasionally manage assistance to poverty relief projects, such as to government programs that provide \"cash transfer\" payments to low-income families.\n\n====Special assistance offices====\n\nSome USAID missions have specialized technical offices for areas like counter-narcotics assistance or assistance in conflict zones.\n\nDisaster assistance on a large scale is provided through USAID's [[Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance|Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance]].  Rather than having a permanent presence in country missions, this office has supplies pre-positioned in strategic locations to respond quickly to disasters when and where they occur.<ref>{{cite web|last1=USAID|title=Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance|url=https://www.usaid.gov/who-we-are/organization/bureaus/bureau-democracy-conflict-and-humanitarian-assistance/office-us|accessdate=13 June 2017|date=November 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===The Office of the Mission Director and the Program Office===\nThe Mission Director's signature authorizes technical offices to provide assistance according to the designs and budgets they propose.  With the help of the Program Office, the Mission Director ensures that designs are consistent with USAID policy for the country, including budgetary earmarks by which Washington directs that funds be used for certain general purposes such as public health or environmental conservation.  The Program Office compiles combined reports to Washington to support budget requests to Congress and to verify that budgets were used as planned.\n\n===Contracting, financial management and management offices===\nWhile the Mission Director is the public face and key decision-maker for an impressive array of USAID technical capabilities, arguably the offices that make USAID preeminent among U.S. government agencies in the ability to follow through on assistance agreements in low-income countries are the \"support\" offices.\n\n====Contracting offices====\n\nCommitments of U.S. government funds to NGOs and firms that implement USAID's assistance programs can only be made in compliance with carefully designed contracts and grant agreements executed by warranted Contracting and Agreement Officers.  The Mission Director is authorized to commit financial assistance directly to the country's government agencies.\n\n====Financial management offices====\n\nFunds can be committed only when the Mission's Controller certifies their availability for the stated purpose.  \"FM\" offices assist technical offices in financial analysis and in developing detailed budgets for inputs needed by projects assisted.  They evaluate potential recipients' management abilities before financial assistance can be authorized and then review implementers' expenditure reports with great care.  This office often has the largest number of staff of any office in the mission.\n\n====Management offices====\n\nCalled the \"Executive Office\" in USAID (sometimes leading to confusion with the Embassy's Executive Office, which is the office of the Ambassador), \"EXO\" provides operational support for mission offices, including human resources, information systems management, transportation, property and procurement services. Increasing integration into Embassies' chancery complexes, and the State Department's recently increased role in providing support services to USAID, is expanding the importance of coordination between USAID's EXO and the Embassy's Management section.\n\n==Assistance projects==\nWhile the terms \"assistance project\" and \"development project\" might sometimes be used indiscriminately, it helps in understanding USAID's work to make a distinction.  (1) Development is what developing countries do.  Development projects are projects of local government agencies and NGOs, such as projects to improve public services or business regulations, etc.  (2) Assistance is what USAID does.  USAID's assistance projects support local development projects.\n\nThe key to a successful development project is the institutional capacity of local organizations, including the professional ability of their staff members.  The key to successful assistance is how well it fits the needs of local development projects, including institutional capacity building and supporting professional education and training for staff.\n\nWhen a local development project's assistance needs have been identified, USAID arranges the agreed assistance through funding agreements with implementing organizations, referred to by USAID staff as \"implementing partners.\"  USAID finances several types of implementers using a variety of funding agreements.\n\nTo illustrate, USAID might assist a development project with inputs provided through several different funding agreements:\n\n# A budget-support grant to a government agency.\n# A contract with a firm for support to the agency.\n# A grant to a local NGO serving the beneficiary group.\n# A grant to an international NGO to strengthen the operations of the local NGO.\n\nEach of these types of USAID funding agreements is profiled below.\n\n===Budget support to a government agency===\nThis funding agreement would take the form of a letter from USAID's Mission Director, countersigned by the recipient agency, explaining the agency's objectives, the amount of USAID's financial commitment, the specific expenditures to be financed by USAID's grant, and other operational aspects of the agreement.\n\nUSAID's technical office would assign a staff member (U.S. or local) to oversee progress in the agency's implementation.  USAID's financial management office would transfer funds to the agency, in tranches as needed.  Audit under this kind of government-to-government (G2G) financial assistance is usually performed by the host government's own audit agency.\n\n===Contract for technical assistance to a government agency===\nAs a government agency is usually specialized in services to the beneficiary population (medical services, for example), its staff may not be equipped to undertake planning and evaluation, construction, acquisition of equipment, or management of training and study tours.  The government agency might, therefore, request USAID's assistance in these areas, and USAID could respond by contracting with a firm to supply the services or technical assistance requested.\n\nUSAID's technical office would collaborate with the government agency in drafting the specifications for what is needed (generally referred to as a \"Statement of Work\" for the contract) and in conducting market research for available sources and potential bidders.  USAID's Contracting Officer would then advertise for bids, manage the selection of a contractor from among the competing bidders, sign the contract, and assign a technical-office staff member as the Contracting Officer's Representative to oversee the performance under the contract.  (If the workload permits, this staff member might be the same person who oversees USAID's financial assistance to the government agency.)\n\nThe contractor supplies technical assistance directly to the government agency, so that in monitoring contractor performance USAID relies substantially on the agency's evaluation of the contractor's work.\n\n===Grant to finance NGO services to a beneficiary group===\nNon-governmental organizations are, like their government counterparts, usually already engaged in service provision in areas where USAID wants to assist, and they often have unique abilities that complement public programs.  Therefore, USAID technical-office staff might set aside a budget and, with the help of the mission's contracting office, publish a solicitation for applications from NGOs for financial assistance to their programs.  One or several grants could be made to selected NGOs by the contracting office's \"Agreement Officer.\"  Similar to the case of a contract, a USAID technical-office staff member would be assigned as the Agreement Officer's Representative to monitor progress in the NGOs' implementation and to arrange for external evaluations.  USAID grants require recipient NGOs to contract for external audits.\n\nAs some local NGOs may be small and young organizations with no prior experience in receiving awards from USAID, the USAID mission's financial management office reviews grant applicants' administrative systems to ensure that they are capable of managing USG funds.  Where necessary, USAID can devote part of the grant to the NGO's internal strengthening to help the NGO qualify for USAID's financing and build the capacity of the organization in the process.  Following completion of the NGO's internal strengthening, USAID would disburse financing for the NGO's service project.\n\n===Grant to international NGOs for technical assistance===\nInternational NGOs have their own development projects and capabilities.  If USAID and its counterparts determine that development objectives can best be met by supporting an NGO project, and if local NGO capacity is not yet sufficient, the relevant USAID technical office will draft a program description and the contracting office will issue as a request for applications to solicit responses from the international NGO community.  USAID manages the award and implementation processes in the same way as for local NGOs.\n\nAlso, international NGOs frequently make unsolicited proposals to USAID, requesting funding for their own planned assistance activities.  Where NGOs or business enterprises are dedicating a substantial amount of non-USG resources to their projects, they can receive USAID funding through \"Global Development Alliance\" grants, provided that the non-USG resources are at least equal in value to USAID's grant.\n\nIn general, USAID provides financial assistance to support other organizations' programs when those programs correspond to the areas that USAID wants to support, while USAID uses contracts to procure products or services requested by the leaders of local development projects.\n\n===Other mechanisms===\nIn addition to the types of projects described above, USAID uses various other assistance mechanisms for different U.S. objectives.  Budget agreements with other USG agencies are common in supporting collaboration between the U.S. and other countries on global issues.  Large budget-support grants, referred to as \"non-project\" assistance, may be made to recipient governments to pursue U.S. foreign policy interests.\n\n==History==\nWhen the USG created USAID in November 1961, it built on a legacy of previous development-assistance agencies and their people, budgets, and operating procedures. USAID's predecessor agency was already substantial, with 6,400 U.S. staff in developing-country field missions in 1961.

[[Japan]], China, Turkey, and several Latin American countries requested missions on subjects like fiscal management, monetary institutions, election management, mining, schooling, roads, flood control, and urban sanitation.  The U.S. Government also initiated missions, particularly to Central America and the Caribbean, when it felt that U.S. interests might be affected by crises like failed elections, debt defaults, or spread of infectious disease.<ref>Merle Curti and Kendall Birr, \"Prelude to Point Four: American Technical Missions Overseas, 1838\u20131938\" (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1954).</ref>\n\nU.S. technical missions in this era were not, however, part of a systematic, USG-supported program.  Possibly the closest approximation to what USG development assistance would become was the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chinafound.org.tw/ec99/eshop1387/e_profile.asp | title=China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture}}</ref> established by the USG in 1924 using funds provided by China as reparations following the \"Boxer\" conflict.  The Foundation's activities ranged widely and included support for development of a leading Chinese university, [[Tsinghua University]].\n\nA notable early example of U.S. Government foreign assistance for disaster relief was its contribution to the 1915 [[Committee for Relief in Belgium]] headed by [[Herbert Hoover]], to prevent starvation in [[Belgium]] after the German invasion.  After World War I in 1919, the USG created the American Relief Administration, also headed by Hoover, which provided food primarily in Eastern Europe.\n\nBetween the two world wars, however,  U.S. assistance in low-income countries was often the product of private initiative, including the work of private foundations such as the Rockefeller Foundation and the Near East Foundation.<ref>For information on the Near East Foundation, see {{cite web|title=Near East Foundation|url=http://www.neareast.org/}}  Also {{cite book|last1=Badeau|first1=John S.|last2=Stevens|first2=G.

Since countries in the region were regularly requesting expert assistance from USG cabinet departments, an Interdepartmental Committee on Cooperation with the American Republics was established in 1938, with the State Department in the chair, to ensure systematic responses.<ref>{{cite web|title=Records of Interdepartmental Committees|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/353.html|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Glick|first1=Philip|title=The Administration of Technical Assistance|date=1957|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|pages=7\u20139}}</ref>\n\nMore ambitiously, the U.S. subsequently created an institution that for the first time would take an active role in development assistance programming: the Institute of Inter-American Affairs (IIAA), chartered in March 1942. The Institute was the initiative of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, Nelson Rockefeller, the future Vice President of the United States, whose family financed the Rockefeller Foundation. IIAA's 1,400 employees provided technical assistance across Central and South America for economic stabilization, food supply, health, and sanitation. U.S. benefits included development of sources for raw materials that had been disrupted by the war.<ref>Erb, Claude (1985). \"Prelude to Point Four: The Institute of Inter-American Affairs\".

On the basis of positive evaluations from the U.S. Ambassadors in Latin America, the State Department succeeded in getting Congressional authorization to extend IIAA, initially through 1950 and then through 1955.<ref>Glick (1957), pp. 26\u201328</ref> Some existing USG technical-assistance agencies continued work in parallel with IIAA.  In particular, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Office of Foreign Agricultural Relations (OFAR) continued to operate separately until 1954.<ref>OFAR was an office in USDA between 1939 and 1953.  In this period, the [[Foreign Agricultural Service]] reported to the Department of State rather than to USDA.

The revised operating procedure was modeled on reforms that had been pioneered by IIAA in March 1951.]</ref>\n\n=== Maturation of American development assistance institutions ===\n\nWhile USG development assistance was institutionalized on a nearly global scale by TCA, strong currents of change in U.S. foreign economic policy during the 1950s affected how development assistance worked and at times called its continued existence into question.  When this process finally resulted in the creation USAID in 1961, USAID continued to use TCA's core mechanism \u2014 providing technical assistance led by in-country resident offices \u2014 and supplemented it with substantial amounts of financial assistance.\n\n==== Post-war foreign aid ====\n\nPoint Four and TCA had been established in the context of a number of other programs in the large-scale U.S. foreign aid effort of the 1940s.<ref>Brown & Opie (1953).</ref> Already during the war, in 1943, the U.S. (jointly with its wartime allies, referred to collectively as \"the United Nations\") established the \"United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration\" ([[UNRRA]]) for war-affected parts of Europe, China, the Philippines, Korea, and Ethiopia.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ninth and Final Financial Report of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration |date=March 1949 |publisher=UNRRA |location=Washington, D.C. |page=25 |hdl=2027/nnc1.cu03384870 }}</ref> Immediately after the war, the USG supplied relief in Germany and Japan, funded by appropriations for \"Government and Relief in Occupied Areas\" ([[GARIOA]]).<ref>Brown & Opie (1953), pp. 108\u2013109.</ref>\n\nRelief was quickly followed by reconstruction assistance.  In 1946, the U.S. created a special financial-assistance program for rehabilitation of war damages in its former possession, the Philippines.<ref>By the program's completion in March 1951, the U.S. had provided $388 million for private property claims and $55 million for public property reconstruction.  (See {{cite book |last1=Waring |first1=Frank A. |last2=Delgado |first2=Francisco A. |last3=O'Donnell |first3=John A. |title=Rehabilitation of the Philippines: Final and Ninth Semiannual Report of the United States Philippine War Damage Commission |date=March 31, 1951 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |location=Washington D.C. |hdl=2027/mdp.39015039449130 }})  The following month, in April 1951, the U.S. and the Philippines signed an agreement for the U.S. to open an aid office (a Special Technical and Economic Mission). (See {{cite book |title=Thirteenth Report to Congress of the Economic Cooperation Administration: Supplement |pages=58\u201365 |hdl=2027/umn.31951d03727992c }})</ref> In 1948, reconstruction assistance was expanded through the [[Marshall Plan]], implemented by the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA), mainly for Western Europe. In the same year, the U.S. and China established the [[Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction]],<ref>Brown & Opie (1953), pp. 341\u2013342.</ref> which, starting on the mainland and continuing for two decades in Taiwan, provided sustained development assistance.\n\nAlso, the [[Fulbright Program]] of academic exchanges was established in 1946, globalizing the wartime program of exchange visits between professionals from Latin America and the United States.\n\nIn contrast to the [[Marshall Plan]], Point Four focussed on technical assistance and provided financial assistance only in limited amounts to support its technical initiatives. In terms of geographic focus, while the two programs mainly operated in different countries, the Marshall Plan also expanded into developing nations.  In particular, the Marshall Plan financed activities in parts of the Middle East, in overseas territories of European allies (principally in Africa), and in \"the general area of China\" (Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Burma, Malaya, Indonesia, and the Philippines), where it operated through Special Technical and Economic Missions (STEMs).  The STEMs were set up in 1950 and 1951, and had a \"Point Four character\" in the sense that they emphasized services by technical experts.<ref>Hayes (1971), pp. 44\u201352.</ref>  Minimizing overlaps with the Marshall Plan, Point Four managed assistance mainly in Latin America (via IIAA), in North Africa and Eritrea, in parts of the Middle East, and in India, Pakistan, and Ceylon.<ref>Brown & Opie (1953), pp. 412\u2013414.</ref>\n\nThe U.S. also participated in post-1945 UN initiatives for technical assistance to developing countries.  Through a series of actions in 1948 and 1949, the UN's General Assembly and Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) created the [[Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance]] (EPTA).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jolly|first1=Richard|last2=Emmerji|first2=Louis|last3=Ghai|first3=Dharam|last4=Lapeyre|first4=Frederic|title=UN Contributions to Development Thinking and Practice|date=2004|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, IN|pages=68\u201373}}</ref>  The U.S. provided 60% of EPTA's financing.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kirdar|first1=\u00dcner|title=The Structure of United Nations Economic-Aid to Underdeveloped Countries|url=https://archive.org/details/structureofunite0000kird|url-access=registration|date=1966|publisher=M. Nijhoff|location=The Hague|page=[https://archive.org/details/structureofunite0000kird/page/60 60]}}</ref> By 1955, EPTA adopted a country-led approach where the UN's TA in each country was programmed according to a plan drawn up by the receiving country in consultation with the UN.  ECOSOC also created a new Technical Assistance Board, which (similarly to the USG's wartime Interdepartmental Committee) coordinated the TA being provided to low-income countries by various individual UN agencies.\n\n==== Korean War ====\n\nCoordination between development assistance and the Marshall Plan was tightened in response to the 1950\u201351 war in Korea.  In October 1951 Congress passed the [[Mutual Security Act]], creating the Mutual Security Agency (MSA), which reported directly to the President and supervised both civilian and military assistance. MSA increased the emphasis on large-scale financial assistance to U.S. allies, which was provided as civilian \"economic assistance\" but was intended to help the allies to make greater military efforts and was therefore often called \"defense support.\"<ref>The name under which Congress appropriates these funds has changed over time, becoming \"Supporting Assistance\" in 1961, \"Security Supporting Assistance\" in 1971, and finally \"Economic Support Funds\" from 1978 to the present. See Nowels (1987), pp. 5\u20136.</ref>\n\nThe Mutual Security Agency absorbed the Marshall Plan (the ECA), which otherwise had been scheduled to end in 1952.  The Technical Cooperation Administration remained a semi-autonomous agency in the State Department to administer Point Four, but after 1951 under the supervision of MSA.<ref>Butterfield (2004), p. 37.</ref> Under this coordinated approach, the policy was adopted that ECA and TCA would not both operate in the same country (\"one country \u2014 one agency\").  Accordingly, each agency transferred programs to the other and closed down in some countries.<ref>Bingham (2004), pp. 262\u2013263.</ref> For example, in Indonesia and Burma, ECA closed its financial-assistance programs, while TCA initiated technical assistance.<ref>{{cite web |title=Oral History Interview with Stanley Andrews |url=https://www.trumanlibrary.org/oralhist/andrewss.htm |publisher=Harry S. Truman Library & Museum |accessdate=22 April 2019 |pages=42\u201344}}</ref>\n\n==== Eisenhower administration ====\n\nIn 1953, the Eisenhower administration took office.  The President's party, which had been out of the White House since 1933,<ref>The only times the Republican Party had a majority in either house in the 48-year span from 1933 to 1981 was when it enjoyed small majorities in both houses of the 80th Congress in 1947\u20131949 under Pres. Truman and both houses of the 83rd Congress 1953\u20131955 under Pres. Eisenhower.</ref> took a critical view of the previous administrations' policies, including both the globalizing policies of the 1940s and the New Deal initiatives of the 1930s.<ref>The New Deal's Tennessee Valley Authority was the model for some major development assistance projects. See Ekbladh (2002).</ref>\n \nAn overall goal of the new administration was to administer the government efficiently and cut spending.<ref>Kaufman (1982), p. 14.</ref> While TCA's technical assistance to developing countries was a small budget item and was considered a long-term program (although fresh funds were appropriated annually), \"economic assistance\" (or \"defense support\") was considered an inherently short-term measure.<ref>Bingham (1953), p. 38.</ref> In place of U.S. economic assistance, the Eisenhower administration proposed that U.S. allies should increasingly finance themselves through their own exports: in other words, through \"trade not aid.\"<ref>Kaufman (1982), ch. 2, pp. 12\u201333.</ref>  With respect to financial assistance for developing countries, the policy was maintained that it should be provided primarily by the U.S. Export-Import Bank and by the World Bank,<ref>U.S. documents of the 1950s usually referred to the World Bank as \"the International Bank.\"</ref> and that it should be available only on commercial terms and primarily to finance private investment.<ref>Glick (1957), pp. 130\u2013136: \"The Relation of Technical Co-operation to Economic Aid.\"</ref>\n\nTo administer the foreign assistance more efficiently, President Eisenhower integrated management into a single agency, the newly created Foreign Operations Administration (FOA).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Eisenhower |first1=Dwight D. |title=Special Message to the Congress on the Organization of the Executive Branch for the Conduct of Foreign Affairs |url=https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/special-message-the-congress-the-organization-the-executive-branch-for-the-conduct-foreign |website=The American Presidency Project |publisher=UC\u2013Santa Barbara |accessdate=26 April 2019 |date=June 1, 1953}}</ref> MSA, TCA (which had been under MSA's direction), and IIAA (which had been part of TCA) were all abolished as of August 1953 and their country offices became \"United States Operations Missions\" (USOMs) under FOA.<ref>Bingham (2004), p. 240.</ref> The President directed other USG agencies to put their technical assistance in developing countries under FOA's management as well. USDA in particular transferred OFAR's programs to FOA, while reconstituting the [[Foreign Agricultural Service]] for the task of building global markets for U.S. farm products.<ref>Glick (1957) p. 49.</ref>\n\nAdministrative functions were consolidated as the various agencies came into FOA, and the Mutual Security Act of July 1953 instructed FOA to reduce personnel by at least 10% within 120 days.<ref>{{cite web|last1=U.S. Government|title=Mutual Security Act of 1953|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-67/pdf/STATUTE-67-Pg152.pdf|at=Section 706(a)|accessdate=21 June 2017|date=July 16, 1953}}</ref> A large number of TCA's senior professionals were summarily dismissed, and FOA's administrator mounted an effort to compensate for lower USG staffing by drawing on experts from U.S. universities and private voluntary organizations.<ref>Ruttan (1996), p. 205.</ref>  The ExIm Bank's lending volume in developing countries was also cut dramatically in 1953.<ref>Kaufman (1982), pp. 29\u201333.</ref>\n\nChanging world events and differences of opinion within the [[Eisenhower]] administration soon altered the administration's cutbacks, however.\n \nFirst, while a \"trade not aid\" strategy required the U.S. to import more goods from its allies, the administration was unable to convince Congress to liberalize import policy.<ref>Kaufman (1982), pp. 37\u201346.</ref>  On the contrary, the main foreign commercial measure taken at this time went in the other direction: the U.S. ramped up subsidies for exports of U.S. agricultural products.  The 1953 amendment to the Mutual Security Act and the much larger Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, known as \"PL-480,\" allowed the U.S. Government to buy U.S. farm surpluses and sell them in developing countries for inconvertible local currencies.<ref>Kaufman (1982), pp. 26\u201329.  Sen. Hubert Humphrey was a prominent supporter of the PL-480 concept.</ref><ref>A currency is \"inconvertible\" when the government forbids it to be used to buy foreign exchange, so that it can only be spent in the country that issues it.</ref> Much of PL-480's foreign-currency revenue was returned to developing countries as a supplement to U.S. development assistance.  PL-480 revenues in the first twenty years were sometimes huge and although PL-480 has become smaller it continues to provide resources to USAID for nutrition and disaster relief programs.<ref>{{cite web|last1=USAID|title=Food Assistance|url=https://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/agriculture-and-food-security/food-assistance|accessdate=19 June 2017|date=2017}}</ref>\n \nSecond, several factors arose that favored large-scale economic assistance to developing countries, especially in Asia. [[South Korea]] needed massive economic assistance after an armistice was finally signed in July 1953,<ref>Mason, Kim ''et al''. (1980), chapter 6.</ref> and U.S. economic assistance to South Vietnam increased after the retreat of France in 1954.<ref>Ruttan (1996), pp. 259\u2013260.</ref>  On a global scale, the Cold War after the death of Joseph Stalin in March 1953 evolved in the direction of rivalry over influence in low-income countries who were seeking financing for their development initiatives. India was a particular case of a country where the U.S. felt it needed to provide economic assistance to balance the USSR's influence, even though India was not a U.S. military ally.<ref>Ruttan (1996), pp. 72\u201373.</ref>  These considerations led to advocacy of expanded economic assistance by several voices within the Eisenhower administration: the FOA Director, former Minnesota Governor Harold Stassen; C.D. Jackson, from the Time-Life publishing business (who draw on advice from MIT economists Millikan and Rostow); the State Department; and the National Security Council.\n \nAs a result, the USG took several steps in the course of 1954 and 1955 to raise the profile of development assistance.\n\nIn June 1954, the USG raised the ExIm Bank's lending authority from $4.5 billion to $5 billion.<ref>Kaufman (1982), p. 32.</ref>  Pres. Eisenhower also created in December 1954 a Cabinet-level Council on Foreign Economic Policy,<ref>Kaufman (1982), p. 37.</ref> which in March 1955 recommended expanded soft loans for development.  In April 1955, Pres. Eisenhower proposed a special economic fund for Asia.<ref name=\"Kaufman 1982, p. 52\"/>\n\nTo implement Congress's August 1954 decision that technical assistance for developing countries should be put back under the State Department,<ref>{{cite web|last1=U.S. Government|title=Mutual Security Act of 1953|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-67/pdf/STATUTE-67-Pg152.pdf|accessdate=21 June 2017|date=1953}}</ref> Pres.

Eisenhower and Congress conducted in 1956 a number of studies to give foreign aid policy a more solid basis.

Jackson had circulated in 1954.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1951900|title = Foreign Aid and the Policy Process: 1957|journal = The American Political Science Review|volume = 52|issue = 3|pages = 689\u2013724|last1 = Haviland|first1 = H.

See Ruttan (1996), pp. 89\u201391.</ref> Personnel changes soon reflected this change in the administration's view: Christian Herter succeeded Herbert Hoover Jr. as Under Secretary of State in February 1957, Robert Anderson succeeded George Humphrey as Treasury Secretary in July 1957, and James H. Smith Jr. replaced John Hollister as ICA Director in September 1957.<ref>Haviland (1958), pp. 690, 691, 696.</ref>\n \nPres. Eisenhower summarized the conclusions in his May 21, 1957 message to Congress: \"This past year ... Congressional Committees, the Executive Branch and distinguished private citizens have just examined these programs anew. ... I recommend the following legislative actions: ... economic development assistance should be provided primarily through loans, on a continuing basis, and related closely to technical assistance. ... I recommend a clear separation of military and defense support assistance on the one hand, from economic development assistance on the other. ... I recommend that longterm [sic] development assistance be provided from a Development Loan Fund. ... Such loans should not compete with or replace such existing sources of credit as private investors, the International Bank [the World Bank], or the Export-Import Bank. ... I believe the Fund should be established and administered in the International Cooperation Administration. ...

The U.S. supported their involvement through several multilateral initiatives.\n\nThree of these initiatives expanded World Bank facilities.\n\nIn November 1954, the U.S. decided to endorse the World Bank's proposed International Finance Corporation, which would raise funds from global capital markets to lend to the private sector in developing countries.<ref>Kaufman (1982), pp. 46\u201349.</ref> The IFC was finally established in 1956.\n\nWith Senator [[Mike Monroney]] playing a prominent role, Congress approved in July 1958 another new World Bank facility, the International Development Association (IDA).  Funded by grants from industrialized countries, the IDA would make low-interest credits to developing countries for projects like public works.  The IDA formally came into being in September 1960, with the U.S. contributing 42% of its initial resources.<ref>Mason, Edward; Asher, Robert (1973). ''The World Bank Since Bretton Woods''.

P, & Webb, R. Charles. (1997). ''The World Bank : its first half century'' (Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution), p. 929.</ref>\n\nWhile the U.S. supported expanded World Bank facilities, it did not support the proposal for a Special UN Fund for Economic Development (SUNFED). The UN did create a \"Special Fund\" in 1957, but it was limited to designing projects for the UN's technical assistance program, EPTA, and could not finance public works.<ref>Jolly ''et al.'' (2004), pp. 73\u201383.</ref>\n\nThe U.S. also adopted a regional initiative with [[Latin America]].  Through most of the 1950s, the U.S. concentrated on technical assistance in the region.  Financial assistance sources were limited to the Eximbank and the World Bank, with the U.S. opposing proposals for a regional development bank.  However, events in 1958 \u2014 notably a riot during Vice President Nixon's visit to [[Caracas, Venezuela]] in May 1958 \u2014 resulted in a reversal of the U.S. position in August 1958.  With U.S. support, the Organization of American States created in April 1959 the Inter-American Development Bank, most of whose capital was contributed by the borrowing countries.<ref>Kaufman (1982), p. 161-162.</ref>\n\nTo further engage other wealthy countries in development assistance, the USG supported the creation of the Aid India Consortium in August 1958. This was the first of several informal groupings of donors focussing on particular countries.\n\nThe USG also supported the Organization of European Economic Co-operation (the European Marshall Plan organization) in creating a Development Assistance Group in January 1960.<ref>{{cite web |last1=OECD |title=DAC in Dates: The History of OECD's Development Assistance Committee |url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/1896808.pdf |accessdate=16 September 2018 |date=2006}} As the organization broadened its membership and became the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ([[OECD]]) in 1961, the Development Assistance Group was re-named the [[Development Assistance Committee]], or DAC.</ref>\n\n=== Creation of USAID and the Development Decade ===\nAt the end of the 1950s, the momentum in favor of development assistance\u2014as represented by PL-480, new mechanisms for financial assistance, larger U.S. budgets and staffing, and multilateral initiatives\u2014picked up support from Senator John F. Kennedy, who was preparing to be a candidate for the presidency. In 1957, JFK proposed, in bipartisan collaboration with Sen. John Sherman Cooper (a former U.S. Ambassador to India), a major expansion of U.S. economic support for India. As a candidate in 1960, he supported the emphasis on humanitarian goals for PL-480 set by Sen. Hubert Humphrey's \"Food for Peace\" Act of 1959<ref>Ruttan (1996), pp. 156\u2013159.</ref> and supported the idea of a [[Peace Corps]] that was under development thanks to the initiatives of Sen. Humphrey, Rep. Reuss, and Sen. Neuberger.  {{Crossreference| (See the \"History\" section of [[Peace Corps]].)}}<ref>Until 1973, USAID and its predecessors also supported [[International Voluntary Services]], which was founded in 1953.

On March 22, he sent a special message to Congress on foreign aid, asserting that the 1960s should be a \"Decade of Development\" and proposing to unify U.S. development assistance administration into a single agency.  He sent a proposed \"Act for International Development\" to Congress in May and the resulting \"Foreign Assistance Act\" was approved in September, repealing the Mutual Security Act.  In November, Pres. Kennedy signed the act and issued an Executive Order tasking the Secretary of State to create, within the State Department, the \"Agency for International Development\" (or A.I.D.: subsequently re-branded as USAID),<ref>The names of predecessor agencies often continued in popular usage.  In Vietnam in the 1960s, it was common to refer to A.I.D.'s office as \"USOM,\" while in Peru A.I.D. telephone operators continued in the 1960s to answer calls saying \"Punto Cuatro\" (Point Four).</ref> as the successor to both ICA and the Development Loan Fund.<ref>In 1966, the UN would also integrate its EPTA and the Special Fund into a new agency, the UN Development Program, or UNDP.</ref>\n\nWith these actions, the U.S. created a permanent agency working with administrative autonomy under the policy guidance of the State Department to implement, through resident field missions, a global program of both technical and financial development assistance for low-income countries. This structure has continued to date.<ref>The Fulbright educational and cultural exchange program was also strengthened by the Fulbright-Hays Act in September 1961.</ref>\n\nTaking this momentum onto the world stage via an address to the UN General Assembly in September 1961, Pres. Kennedy called for a \"United Nations Decade of Development.\" This initiative was endorsed by a General Assembly resolution in December, establishing the concepts of development and development assistance as global priorities.\n\n=== \"New Directions\" in the 1970s ===\nIn the late 1960s, foreign aid became one of the focal points in Legislative-Executive differences over the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>Ruttan (1996). pp. 107\u2013108.</ref>  In September 1970, [[Richard M.

Specifically, USAID's budget would be reformed to account for expenditures for each of these Basic Human Needs, a system referred to as \"functional accounts.\" (Previously, budgets had been divided between categories such as \"development loans, technical assistance, [[Alliance for Progress]] [for Latin America], loans and grants, and population.\")<ref>Ruttan (1996).  pp. 94, 98\u2013100, 543 fn. 2.</ref> The new system was based on a proposal developed by a bipartisan group of House members and staff working with USAID management and outside advisors.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Butterfield|title=U.S. Development Aid|pages=177\u2013179}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Pastor|first1=Robert A.|title=Congress and the Politics of U.S. Foreign Economic Policy 1929\u20131976|date=1980|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA|isbn=0-520-03904-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/congresspolitics0000past/page/278 278\u2013279]|url=https://archive.org/details/congresspolitics0000past/page/278}}</ref> President Nixon signed the New Directions act into law (PL 93-189) in December 1973.\n\nAlso in 1973, the \"Percy Amendment\" of the Foreign Assistance Act required U.S. development assistance to integrate women into its programs, leading to USAID's creation of its Women in Development (WID) office in 1974. However, the [[Helms Amendment]] of 1973 banned use of U.S. Government funds for abortion as a method of family planning, which effectively required USAID to eliminate all support for abortion.<ref name=\"usaidweb1\">USAID Public website [http://transition.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/pop/restrictions.html USAID's Family Planning Guiding Principles and U.S. Legislative and Policy Requirements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329101241/http://transition.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/pop/restrictions.html |date=2013-03-29 }} Retrieved September 10, 2012</ref>\n\nA further amendment of the Foreign Assistance Act in 1974 prohibited assistance for police, thus ending USAID's involvement in Public Safety programs in Latin America, which in the 1960s were, along with the Vietnam War, part of the U.S. Government's anti-Communist strategy.\n\nThe reforms also ended the practice of the 1960s and 1970s in which many USAID officers in Latin America and Southeast Asia had worked in joint offices led by State Department diplomats or in units with U.S. military personnel.\n\nThe Basic Human Needs reforms largely cut off USAID's assistance to higher education.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Guither |first1=Harold D. |title=The Famine Prevention and Freedom from Hunger Amendment: Issues and Compromises in International Development Policymaking |journal=Illinois Agricultural Economics |date=July 1977 |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.2307/1348954 |jstor=1348954 }}</ref><ref>See also Congressional Research Service (1981), material found via search string \"higher education\".</ref>  A large part of that assistance had gone to agricultural universities in hungry developing countries, as illustrated by a 1974 book by a University of Illinois professor, Hadley Read, describing USAID-supported U.S. land-grant universities' work in building India's agricultural universities.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Read |first1=Hadley |title=Partners With India: Building Agricultural Universities |date=1974 |publisher=University of Illinois |location=Urbana-Champaign}}</ref> Read's book inspired an Illinois Member of Congress concerned with famine prevention, Paul Findley, to draft a bill authorizing more support for programs like the ones Read described.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Findley |first1=Paul |title=Interview with Paul Findley: Transcript |url=https://www.illinois.gov/alplm/library/collections/oralhistory/illinoisstatecraft/general/Documents/FindleyPaul/Findley_Pau_4FNL.pdf |publisher=Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library |accessdate=13 June 2018 |pages=158\u2013161 |date=2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115133153/https://www.illinois.gov/alplm/library/collections/oralhistory/illinoisstatecraft/general/Documents/FindleyPaul/Findley_Pau_4FNL.pdf |archive-date=2017-11-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In a legislative process involving USAID staff, the association of state universities and land-grant colleges (NASULGC), and Sen.

Title XII created the [[Board for International Food and Agricultural Development (BIFAD)]], with seven members representing U.S. universities and agricultural technology institutions who advise USAID on Title XII implementation.\n\nThe impact of all these actions of the early 1970s on the overall scale of U.S. development assistance is indicated by the change in the number of U.S. staff in field missions.  In 1969, the year when Pres. Nixon took office, the number was already decreasing from its Vietnam War high of 8,717 and had reached 7,701.

According to the AP's report, the plan was to build an audience by initially presenting non-controversial content like sports, music and weather. Once a critical mass of users was reached they would change the content to spark political dissent and mobilize the users into organized political gatherings called 'smart mobs' that would trigger an uprising against the Cuban government.<ref name=\"Associated Press\"/>\n\nThe messaging service was launched in 2010 and gained 40,000 followers at its peak.

That operation involved contracting Venezuelan, Costa Rican and Peruvian youngsters to contact Cubans who could be recruited into anti-regime political activities. The operatives posed as traveling aid workers and tourists. Some of the covert operations were masquerading as [[HIV prevention]] workshops, which leaked memos called \"the perfect excuse\". ''[[The Guardian]]'' criticized the operation as possibly undermining US efforts to work toward improving health globally.<ref name=TheGuardianCuba />\n\nThe travelers operation was also criticized for putting the operatives themselves at risk. After [[Alan Gross]], a development specialist and USAID subcontractor was arrested in Cuba, the US government warned USAID about the safety of covert operatives. Regardless of safety concerns, USAID refused to end the operation.

Debates of this kind are arbitrated in Washington by Congress and the Administration before budgets are decided and before USAID staff undertake detailed programming in the field.  The result is normally that USAID's programs in a given country pursue a mix of goals.\n\n===Modes of assistance===\nSome feel that USAID overemphasizes technical assistance and should instead provide more financial assistance (budget support, or debt relief).  They argue that financial assistance allows recipients to spend as they like with less influence from donors.  Others feel that financial assistance does not result in durable improvements and that person-to-person technical assistance has the advantage of sharing knowledge and experience, leading to permanent improvements.\n\nIn practice, many USAID missions find that their counterparts appreciate having both forms of aid: an assistance package that includes some financial assistance for things that can simply be bought and some technical assistance to confront problems and issues whose solutions are not so clear.\n\n===Cost of delivering assistance===\nUSAID is frequently criticized for providing expensive expert services to counterparts.  The majority of the staff that USAID finances are from the country itself, but USAID is also able to recruit internationally when necessary to meet the counterpart's needs.  USAID uses competition to arrive at market rates for the staff it recruits, and has experimented with volunteer programs for expertise from high paid professions.\n\n===Non-career contracts===\nUSAID frequently contracts with private firms or individuals for specialist services lasting from a few weeks to several years.  It has long been asked whether USAID should more often assign such tasks to career U.S. Government employees instead.  USG staff directly performed technical assistance in the earliest days of the program in the 1940s.  However, it soon became necessary for the USG's technical experts to plan and manage larger assistance programs than they could perform by themselves. The global expansion of TA in the early 1950s reinforced the need to draw on outside experts, which was also accelerated by Congress's requirement of major reductions of USG staffing in 1953.  By 1955, observers commented on a perceived shift towards more use of shorter-term contracts (rather than using employees with career-length contracts).<ref>See {{cite book|last1=Richardson|title=Partners in Development|pages=13\u201314, 37}} Also {{cite book|last1=Butterfield|title=U.S. Development Aid|pages=25\u201326}}</ref>\n\n===Anti-government programs===\nIn situations where the U.S. is hostile to the government of a country, USAID may be asked to undertake programs that the government would not accept and thus to operate without the government's knowledge.  This might include USAID support for opposition political movements that seek to remove the government.  Such \"political aid\" is criticized by some as being incompatible with USAID's role as an assistance or cooperation agency and as exposing USAID staff worldwide to the suspicion of being covertly engaged in subversion.  Similarly, USAID's participation in actions against foreign governments led by the U.S. military is criticized by some as inappropriate and as exposing USAID civilian staff to the dangers of military combat.  However, such political aid and joint civilian-military programs are supported by others as necessary to support U.S. geopolitical interests and to build democracy.\n\n===Economic interests===\nUSAID states that \"U.S. foreign assistance has always had the twofold purpose of furthering America's foreign policy interests in expanding democracy and free markets while improving the lives of the citizens of the developing world.\" However, non-government organization watch groups have noted that as much as 40% of aid to Afghanistan has found its way back to donor countries through awarding contracts at inflated costs.<ref>Richard Norton-Taylor [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/25/afghanistan.internationalaidanddevelopment1 40% of Afghan aid returns to donor countries, says report] ''guardian.co.uk'' 25 March 2008</ref>\n\nAlthough USAID officially selects contractors on a competitive and objective basis, watch dog groups, politicians, foreign governments and corporations have occasionally accused the agency of allowing its bidding process to be unduly influenced by the political and financial interests of its current Presidential administration.

According to USAID papers acquired by Folha under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]], the seminar was planned to coincide with the eve of talks in that country's Congress on a broad political reform. The papers read that although the \"pattern of weak party discipline is found across the political spectrum, it is somewhat less true of parties on the liberal left, such as the [ruling] [[Worker's Party (Brazil)|Worker's Party]].\" The papers also expressed a concern about the \"'indigenization' of the conference so that it is not viewed as providing a U.S. perspective.\" The event's main sponsor was the [[International Republican Institute]].<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/brasil/ult96u424786.shtml |title=''EUA tentaram influenciar reforma pol\u00edtica do Brasil'' |publisher=.folha.uol.com.br |date= |accessdate=2013-05-27}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 2012, [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas|ALBA]] countries (Venezuela, Cuba, Ecuador, Bolivia,  Nicaragua, San Vicente y Las Granadinas, Dominica, Antigua y Barbuda) called on its members to expel USAID from their countries.<ref>[http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/7069 ALBA Expels USAID from Member Countries] Retrieved 2012-09-16</ref>\n\n===Influence on the United Nations===\nSeveral studies{{Which|date=April 2016}} suggest that foreign aid is used as a political weapon for the U.S. to elicit desired actions from other nations.

An ally of [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] leader [[John Pym]], and cousin to [[Oliver Cromwell]], he was one of the [[Five Members]] whose attempted arrest in January 1642 sparked the [[First English Civil War]].\n\nAfter war began in August 1642, Hampden raised an infantry regiment, and died of wounds received at the [[Battle of Chalgrove Field]] on 18 June 1643. His loss was considered a serious blow, largely because he was one of the few Parliamentary leaders able to hold the different factions together. \n\nHis death in 1643 meant he avoided the bitter internal debates later in the war, the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1649, and establishment of [[The Protectorate]]. As a result, he is considered a less complex figure than either Cromwell, or even Pym; in 1841, his statue was erected in the [[Palace of Westminster]], to represent the Parliamentary cause.{{efn|The Royalist chosen was another moderate, [[Lucius_Cary,_2nd_Viscount_Falkland|Viscount Falkland]], killed at [[First_Battle_of_Newbury|Newbury]] three months later.}}    \n\nA reputation for honest, principled, and patriotic opposition to arbitrary rule also made him a popular figure in [[North America]]. Prior to the 1774 [[American Revolution]], [[Benjamin_Franklin|Franklin]] and [[John_Adams|Adams]] were among those who referenced him to justify their cause.{{sfn|Jansson|2009|pp=11-12}}\n\n==Biographical==\n[[File:Gt Hampden Church.jpg|thumb|left|[[Great_and_Little_Hampden|Great Hampden church]], where Hampden and other family members were baptised, and later buried]]\nJohn Hampden was born around June 1595, probably in [[London]], eldest son of William Hampden, (1570-1597), and Elizabeth Cromwell, (1574-1664); he had a younger brother, Richard, 1596 to 1659.{{sfn|Thompson|2010}}  \n\nThe Hampden family had been established in [[Buckinghamshire]] for many years; William was a lawyer, and [[Member of Parliament]] for [[East_Looe_(UK_Parliament_constituency)|East Looe]] in 1593.{{sfn|WJJ|1981}} He died in April 1597; his cousin, William Hampden of Ennington, was appointed executor, but became involved in a bitter legal dispute with Elizabeth.{{sfn|Russell|2008}}\n\nIn 1619, John married Elizabeth Symeon, and prior to her death in 1631, they had nine children. Seven survived into adulthood Ann (1616-1701), Elizabeth (1619-1643), John (1621-1642), William (died 1675), Ruth (1628-1687), Mary (1630-1689), and [[Richard_Hampden|Richard]] (1631-1695), [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] under [[William III of England|William III]].<ref>{{cite web |title=John Hampden |url=https://www.geni.com/people/John-Hampden-Patriae-Pater/6000000003266399664 |website=Geni.com |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> In 1640, he married Letitia Knollys (1591-1666); they had no children.   \n\n==Career==\nIn 1610, he graduated from [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]; as legal training was then considered part of a gentleman's education, he attended the [[Inner Temple]] from 1613 to 1615. \n\nThe Hampden family were [[Puritan]]s, a term then used for anyone who wanted to reform, or 'purify', the [[Church of England]]. It covered a variety of [[Christian_theology|doctrines]], of which [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] such as Hampden were the most prominent; it connected him to a network that included [[Richard_Knightley_(died_1639)|Sir Richard Knightley]], [[William_Fiennes,_1st_Viscount_Saye_and_Sele|Lord Saye]], and [[John_Preston_(priest)|John Preston]].{{sfn|Russell|2008}} \n\nIn 1621, Hampden was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Grampound (UK Parliament constituency)|Grampound]], a [[Rotten_and_pocket_boroughs|rotten borough]] in [[Cornwall]]. This is thought to have been through the influence of the local magnate, [[John_Arundell_(born_1576)|John Arundell]]; a good example of the complexity of the period, Arundell opposed [[Ship Money]] in 1636, but held [[Pendennis Castle]] for [[Charles_I_of_England|Charles I]] until 1646.{{sfn|Duffin|Hunneyball|2010}}  \n[[File:John Pym.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Pym]]; Hampden joined his attack on [[Roger Maynwaring]] and [[Robert Sibthorpe]] in 1628]]\nHe financed the cost of restoring Parliamentary representation to [[Wendover (UK Parliament constituency)|Wendover]] in 1624, a seat he held until 1629. The [[2nd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1626 Parliament]] refused taxes without an agreement to [[Impeachment_in_the_United_Kingdom|impeach]] Charles' favourite, the [[George_Villiers,_1st_Duke_of_Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]], a military commander notorious for inefficiency, combined with extravagance; only his assassination in August 1628 prevented a second attempt.{{sfn|Ferris|Hunneyball|2010}} \n\nRather than comply, Charles dissolved Parliament, and imposed a forced loan; over 70 individuals were jailed for not contributing, including Hampden's cousin, Sir Edmund Hampden.{{sfn|Hostettler|1997|p=127}} Like many others, Hampden also refused to subscribe; and reducing the income from the loans. Charles was forced to call a [[3rd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1628 Parliament]] in March 1627, which resulted in \"a preponderance of MPs opposed to the King\", including Selden, Coke, [[John Pym]] and a young [[Oliver Cromwell]].{{sfn|Hostettler|1997|p=127}} released to attend the [[3rd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1628 Parliament]], he supported [[John Pym]] and others in the Parliamentary attack on [[Roger Maynwaring]] and [[Robert Sibthorpe]].{{sfn|Russell|2008}} \n\nIn the 17th century, religion and politics were considered interdependent; 'good government' required 'true religion', and alterations in one, implied alterations in the other.{{efn|This view was summarised by Hampden in the debate on the [[Petition of Right]]; \"Here is 1, an innovation of religion suspected; is it not high time to take it to heart and acquaint his Majesty? 2ly, alteration of government; can you forbear when it goes no less than the subversion of the whole state? 3ly, hemmed in with enemies; is it now a time to be silent, and not to show to his Majesty that a man that has so much power uses none of it to help us? If he be no papist, papists are friends and kindred to him.\"{{sfn|Keeler|Janssen Cole|1997|pp=121-122}}}} The two published [[sermons]], supporting the Caroline precepts of the [[divine right of kings]], and [[passive obedience]]; although censured for preaching against the established English constitution, Charles pardoned them, and made Sibthorpe a royal [[chaplain]].{{sfn|Little|2008|p=33}} \n\nand in 1629, he dissolved Parliament, initiating the period of [[Personal Rule]] that continued until 1640\n\nIn April 1640 he was elected MP for [[Buckinghamshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckinghamshire]] in the [[Short Parliament]] and was re-elected MP for Buckinghamshire for the [[Long Parliament]] in November 1640.<ref name=Willis>{{Cite Notitia Parliamentaria|converted=1|part=2|pages=229\u2013239}}</ref> He sat until his death in 1643.\n\nIn the early days of his parliamentary career, he was content to be overshadowed by [[John Eliot (statesman)|John Eliot]], as in its later days he was content to be overshadowed by [[John Pym]] and to be commanded by the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]].\n\n\n\n===Views on ship money===\nSomething of Hampden's fame no doubt is owing to the position which he took up as the opponent of [[ship money]].<ref>Gross, David (ed.) ''We Won't Pay!: A Tax Resistance Reader'' {{ISBN|1-4348-9825-3}} pp. 9\u201316</ref> But it is hardly possible that even resistance to ship money would have so distinguished him but for the mingled massiveness and modesty of his character, his dislike of all pretences in himself or others, his brave contempt of danger, and his charitable readiness to shield others as far as possible from the evil consequences of their actions. Nor was he wanting in that skill which enabled him to influence men towards the ends at which he aimed, and which was spoken of as subtlety by those who disliked his ends.\n\n===Committee work===\nDuring these first parliaments Hampden did not, so far as we know, speak in public debate, but he was increasingly employed in [[committee]] work, for which he seems to have had a special aptitude. In 1626 he took an active part in the preparation of the charges against [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]]. In January 1627 he was bound over to answer at the council board for his refusal to pay the forced loan.  Later in the year he was committed to the gatehouse, and then sent into confinement in [[Hampshire]], from which he was liberated just before the meeting of the third parliament of the reign, in which he once more rendered useful but unobtrusive assistance to his leaders.\n\nWhen the breach came in 1629 Hampden was found corresponding with the imprisoned Eliot, discussing with him the prospects of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. Hampden was one of the persons to whom the [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]] granted land in [[Connecticut]] in what was then referred to as the [[Saybrook Colony]] and today as [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut]]. While some claim there is no foundation but anecdote that Hampden attempted emigration to the colonies with Cromwell, others assert that Cromwell and other future architects of the English Civil War, including Hampden, may have been close to moving to America in the 1630s. The author [[Kevin Phillips (political commentator)|Kevin Phillips]] points out that, \"Even in the 1770s, residents of [[Old Saybrook]] still talked about which prominent [[Member of Parliament|Parliamentarian]] was to have had which town lot.\"<ref>Alfred A. Young, \"English Plebeian Culture an 18th Century American Radicalism\" in Margret Jacob and James Jacob, eds., \"The Origin of Anglo-American Radicalism\" 9New Jersey, Humanitarian Press International, 19910 Page 195,</ref>\n\nIt was not until 1637, however, that his resistance to the payment of ship money gained him wide fame. Seven out of the twelve judges sided against him, but the connection between the rights of property and the parliamentary system became firmly established in the popular mind. The tax had been justified, says Clarendon, who expresses his admiration at Hampden's \"rare temper and modesty\" at this crisis, \"upon such grounds and reasons as every standerby was able to swear was not law\" (''Hist''. i. 150,  vii. 82).\n\n===Short Parliament===\nIn the Short Parliament that started on 13 April 1640, Hampden stood forth amongst the leaders. He guided the House in the debate on 4 May in its opposition to the grant of twelve subsidies in return for the surrender of ship money. Parliament was dissolved the next day, and on 6 May an unsuccessful search was made among the papers of Hampden and of other chiefs of the party to discover incriminating correspondence with the [[Scotland|Scots]]. During the eventful months which followed, when [[Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford|Strafford]] was striving in vain to force England, in spite of its visible reluctance, to support the king in his [[Bishops' Wars|Scottish war]], rumour has much to tell of Hampden's activity in rousing opposition. It is likely enough that the rumour is in the main true, but we are not possessed of any satisfactory evidence on the subject.\n\n===Long Parliament===\nIn the [[Long Parliament]], though Hampden was by no means a frequent speaker, it is possible to trace his course with sufficient distinctness. His power consisted in his personal influence, and as a debater rather than as an orator.  \"He was not a man of many words,\" says Clarendon, \"and rarely began the discourse or made the first entrance upon any business that was assumed, but a very weighty speaker, and after he had heard a full debate and observed how the House was likely to be inclined, took up the argument and shortly and clearly and craftily so stated it that he commonly conducted it to the conclusion he desired; and if he found he could not do that, he never was without the dexterity to divert the debate to another time, and to prevent the determining anything in the negative which might prove inconvenient in the future\" (''Hist''. iii. 31). Unwearied in attendance upon committees, he was in all things ready to second Pym, whom he plainly regarded as his leader.\n\nHampden was one of the eight managers of Strafford's prosecution. Like Pym, he was in favour of the more legal and regular procedure by [[impeachment]] rather than by [[attainder]], which at the later stage was supported by the majority of the Commons; and through his influence a compromise was effected by which, while an attainder was subsequently adopted, Strafford's counsel were heard as in the case of an impeachment, and thus a serious breach between the two Houses, which threatened to cause the breakdown of the whole proceedings, was averted.\n\n===Debate on episcopacy===\n[[File:John Hampden Statue.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of John Hampden in Market Square, [[Aylesbury]], Buckinghamshire]]\n\nThere was another point on which there was no agreement. A large minority wished to retain [[episcopacy]], and to keep the [[Book of Common Prayer]] unaltered, whilst the majority were at least willing to consider the question of abolishing the one and modifying the other. On this subject the parties which ultimately divided the House and the country itself were fully formed as early as 8 February 1641. It is enough to say that Hampden fully shared in the counsels of the opponents of episcopacy. It is not that he was a theoretical [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], but the [[bishop]]s had been in his days so fully engaged in the imposition of ceremonies regarded by the [[Puritans]] as verging on [[Papacy]] that it was difficult, if not impossible, to dissociate them from the cause in which they were embarked.  Closely connected with Hampden's distrust of the bishops was his distrust of monarchy as it then existed. The dispute about the church therefore soon attained the form of an attack upon [[monarchy]], and, when the majority of the [[House of Lords]] arrayed itself on the side of episcopacy and the Prayer Book, of an attack upon the House of Lords as well.\n\nNo serious importance therefore can be attached to the offers of advancement made from time to time to Hampden and his friends. Charles would gladly have given them office if they had been ready to desert their principles. Every day Hampden's conviction grew stronger that Charles would never surrender a position which he had taken up. In August 1641 Hampden was one of the four commissioners who attended Charles in Scotland, and the king's conduct there, connected with such events as the \"Incident\", must have proved to a man far less sagacious than Hampden that the time for compromise had gone by. He was therefore a warm supporter of the [[Grand Remonstrance]], and was marked out as one of the five impeached members, known thenceforth in history as the [[Five Members]] (the others being [[John Pym]], [[Arthur Haselrig]], [[Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles|Denzil Holles]] and [[William Strode]]) whose attempted arrest brought at last the opposing parties into open collision. In the angry scene which arose on the proposal to print the Grand Remonstrance, it was Hampden's personal intervention which prevented an actual conflict, and it was after the impeachment had been attempted that Hampden laid down the two conditions under which resistance to the king became the duty of a good subject.  Those conditions were:\n*an attack upon religion and\n*an attack upon the fundamental laws.\n\nThere can be no doubt that Hampden fully believed that both those conditions were fulfilled at the opening of 1642.\n\n==English Civil War==\n\nWhen the [[English Civil War]] began, Hampden was appointed a member of the [[ Committee of Safety (England) #1642\u20131644 | Committee of Safety]], levied a [[regiment]] of Buckinghamshire men for the parliamentary cause, and in his capacity of deputy-lieutenant carried out the parliamentary [[Militia Ordinance]] in the county. In the earlier operations of the war he bore himself gallantly and well. He took no actual part in the [[Battle of Edgehill]] (23 October 1642). His troops in the rear,  however, arrested [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]]'s charge at [[Kineton]], and he urged Essex to renew the attack here, and also after the disaster at [[Battle of Brentford (1642)|Brentford]]. In the spring of 1643, Hampden's regiment took part in the [[siege of Reading]], which surrendered on 27 April. Although Essex intended to advance on the King's headquarters at Oxford, he remained at Reading because of widespread sickness in the army, a shortage of cavalry and to await a paymaster with funds to pay his troops. In early June 1643 he moved his army to Thame making his headquarters there on 10 June.\n\nBut it is not on his skill as a regimental officer that Hampden's fame rests. In war as in peace his distinction lay in his power of disentangling the essential part from the non-essential. In the previous constitutional struggle he had seen that the one thing necessary was to establish the supremacy of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].  In the military struggle which followed he saw, as Cromwell saw afterwards, that the one thing necessary was to beat the enemy.  He protested at once against Essex's hesitations and compromises.  In the formation of the confederacy of the six associated counties, which was to supply a basis for Cromwell's operations, he took an active part.  His influence was felt alike in parliament and in the field but he was not in supreme command, and he had none of that impatience which often leads able men to fail in the execution of orders of which they disapprove.\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Hampden's monument, Chalgrove.jpg|thumb|Hampden's Monument, [[Chalgrove]]. A monument to John Hampden, who was mortally wounded 550 yards north of here in 1643 whilst fighting in the English Civil War on [[Battle of Chalgrove Field|Chalgrove Field]]]]\n\nOn the night of 17 June 1643, [[Prince Rupert]] sortied on a raid out of Oxford to capture the Parliamentarian army's paymaster, but while that failed, did succeed the next morning in overwhelming two of Essex's small garrison outposts at [[Postcombe]] and [[Chinnor]]. Hampden rode as a volunteer with 1,100 cavalry and dragoons commanded by Sir [[Philip Stapleton]] in pursuit of Rupert, with the intention of delaying him long enough for a larger force from Essex's main army to cut off his retreat. Rupert halted his own cavalry at [[Chalgrove]] to ambush the pursuit and allow 800 less mobile troops to escape via the ford of the [[River Thame]] at [[Chiselhampton]]. During the ensuing [[Battle of Chalgrove Field]], Hampden was mortally wounded (some sources claim in the shoulder by two carbine balls, others by fragments from his own pistol exploding<ref>Britannica 1911 (article \"HAMPDEN, JOHN\") \"two carbine balls\".

Sir Robert assured him that he bought them in Paris from an eminent maker and proved them himself. It appeared on examining the other pistol that it was loaded to the muzzle with several supernumerary charges, owning to the carelessness of a servant. He was ordered to see that the pistols were loaded every morning which he did but without drawing the former charge.\" An exhumation of Hampden's body in 1828 showed that there was no damage to the shoulder but his 'right hand was shattered by the bursting of his pistol, and death probably ensued from [[tetanus|lockjaw]] arising out of extensive injury to the nervous system'.<ref>Frederick George Lee, The History, description and antiquities of the Prebendal Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Thame in the county and diocese of Oxford.

During the preceding winter, Hampden had associated himself with John Pym's \"Middle Group\" in Parliament, which opposed any peace moves to the King except on favorable terms. At the same time he had worked to moderate the militancy of the parliamentary \"War Party\". Although Hampden was privately critical of Essex for not aggressively attacking after avoiding defeat at Edgehill and the standoff at [[Battle of Turnham Green|Turnham Green]], he remained publicly loyal and helped Essex resist the criticisms of the War Party. His death took with it a key link between the factions. Hearing of his death, the Member of Parliament [[Anthony Nicholl]] pronounced: \"Never Kingdom received a greater loss in one subject, never a man a truer and faithful friend.\"<ref>\"Selected Readings in English History\". p. 265.

him a national figure. An ally of [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] leader [[John Pym]], and cousin to [[Oliver Cromwell]], he was one of the [[Five Members]] whose attempted arrest in January 1642 sparked the [[First English Civil War]].\n\nAfter war began in August 1642, Hampden raised an infantry regiment, and died of wounds received at the [[Battle of Chalgrove Field]] on 18 June 1643. His loss was considered a serious blow, largely because he was one of the few Parliamentary leaders able to hold the different factions together. \n\nHis death in 1643 meant he avoided the bitter internal debates later in the war, the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1649, and establishment of [[The Protectorate]].

It covered a variety of [[Christian_theology|doctrines]], of which [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] such as Hampden were the most prominent; it connected him to a network that included [[Richard_Knightley_(died_1639)|Sir Richard Knightley]], [[William_Fiennes,_1st_Viscount_Saye_and_Sele|Lord Saye]], and [[John_Preston_(priest)|John Preston]].{{sfn|Russell|2008}} \n\nIn 1621, Hampden was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Grampound (UK Parliament constituency)|Grampound]], a [[Rotten_and_pocket_boroughs|rotten borough]] in [[Cornwall]].

''We Won't Pay!: A Tax Resistance Reader'' {{ISBN|1-4348-9825-3}} pp. 9\u201316</ref> But it is hardly possible that even resistance to ship money would have so distinguished him but for the mingled massiveness and modesty of his character, his dislike of all pretences in himself or others, his brave contempt of danger, and his charitable readiness to shield others as far as possible from the evil consequences of their actions. Nor was he wanting in that skill which enabled him to influence men towards the ends at which he aimed, and which was spoken of as subtlety by those who disliked his ends.\n\n===Committee work===\nDuring these first parliaments Hampden did not, so far as we know, speak in public debate, but he was increasingly employed in [[committee]] work, for which he seems to have had a special aptitude. In 1626 he took an active part in the preparation of the charges against [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]]. In January 1627 he was bound over to answer at the council board for his refusal to pay the forced loan.  Later in the year he was committed to the gatehouse, and then sent into confinement in [[Hampshire]], from which he was liberated just before the meeting of the third parliament of the reign, in which he once more rendered useful but unobtrusive assistance to his leaders.\n\nWhen the breach came in 1629 Hampden was found corresponding with the imprisoned Eliot, discussing with him the prospects of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. Hampden was one of the persons to whom the [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]] granted land in [[Connecticut]] in what was then referred to as the [[Saybrook Colony]] and today as [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut]]. While some claim there is no foundation but anecdote that Hampden attempted emigration to the colonies with Cromwell, others assert that Cromwell and other future architects of the English Civil War, including Hampden, may have been close to moving to America in the 1630s. The author [[Kevin Phillips (political commentator)|Kevin Phillips]] points out that, \"Even in the 1770s, residents of [[Old Saybrook]] still talked about which prominent [[Member of Parliament|Parliamentarian]] was to have had which town lot.\"<ref>Alfred A. Young, \"English Plebeian Culture an 18th Century American Radicalism\" in Margret Jacob and James Jacob, eds., \"The Origin of Anglo-American Radicalism\" 9New Jersey, Humanitarian Press International, 19910 Page 195,</ref>\n\nIt was not until 1637, however, that his resistance to the payment of ship money gained him wide fame. Seven out of the twelve judges sided against him, but the connection between the rights of property and the parliamentary system became firmly established in the popular mind. The tax had been justified, says Clarendon, who expresses his admiration at Hampden's \"rare temper and modesty\" at this crisis, \"upon such grounds and reasons as every standerby was able to swear was not law\" (''Hist''. i. 150,  vii. 82).\n\n===Short Parliament===\nIn the Short Parliament that started on 13 April 1640, Hampden stood forth amongst the leaders. He guided the House in the debate on 4 May in its opposition to the grant of twelve subsidies in return for the surrender of ship money. Parliament was dissolved the next day, and on 6 May an unsuccessful search was made among the papers of Hampden and of other chiefs of the party to discover incriminating correspondence with the [[Scotland|Scots]]. During the eventful months which followed, when [[Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford|Strafford]] was striving in vain to force England, in spite of its visible reluctance, to support the king in his [[Bishops' Wars|Scottish war]], rumour has much to tell of Hampden's activity in rousing opposition. It is likely enough that the rumour is in the main true, but we are not possessed of any satisfactory evidence on the subject.\n\n===Long Parliament===\nIn the [[Long Parliament]], though Hampden was by no means a frequent speaker, it is possible to trace his course with sufficient distinctness. His power consisted in his personal influence, and as a debater rather than as an orator.  \"He was not a man of many words,\" says Clarendon, \"and rarely began the discourse or made the first entrance upon any business that was assumed, but a very weighty speaker, and after he had heard a full debate and observed how the House was likely to be inclined, took up the argument and shortly and clearly and craftily so stated it that he commonly conducted it to the conclusion he desired; and if he found he could not do that, he never was without the dexterity to divert the debate to another time, and to prevent the determining anything in the negative which might prove inconvenient in the future\" (''Hist''. iii. 31). Unwearied in attendance upon committees, he was in all things ready to second Pym, whom he plainly regarded as his leader.\n\nHampden was one of the eight managers of Strafford's prosecution. Like Pym, he was in favour of the more legal and regular procedure by [[impeachment]] rather than by [[attainder]], which at the later stage was supported by the majority of the Commons; and through his influence a compromise was effected by which, while an attainder was subsequently adopted, Strafford's counsel were heard as in the case of an impeachment, and thus a serious breach between the two Houses, which threatened to cause the breakdown of the whole proceedings, was averted.\n\n===Debate on episcopacy===\n[[File:John Hampden Statue.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of John Hampden in Market Square, [[Aylesbury]], Buckinghamshire]]\n\nThere was another point on which there was no agreement. A large minority wished to retain [[episcopacy]], and to keep the [[Book of Common Prayer]] unaltered, whilst the majority were at least willing to consider the question of abolishing the one and modifying the other. On this subject the parties which ultimately divided the House and the country itself were fully formed as early as 8 February 1641. It is enough to say that Hampden fully shared in the counsels of the opponents of episcopacy. It is not that he was a theoretical [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], but the [[bishop]]s had been in his days so fully engaged in the imposition of ceremonies regarded by the [[Puritans]] as verging on [[Papacy]] that it was difficult, if not impossible, to dissociate them from the cause in which they were embarked.  Closely connected with Hampden's distrust of the bishops was his distrust of monarchy as it then existed. The dispute about the church therefore soon attained the form of an attack upon [[monarchy]], and, when the majority of the [[House of Lords]] arrayed itself on the side of episcopacy and the Prayer Book, of an attack upon the House of Lords as well.\n\nNo serious importance therefore can be attached to the offers of advancement made from time to time to Hampden and his friends. Charles would gladly have given them office if they had been ready to desert their principles. Every day Hampden's conviction grew stronger that Charles would never surrender a position which he had taken up. In August 1641 Hampden was one of the four commissioners who attended Charles in Scotland, and the king's conduct there, connected with such events as the \"Incident\", must have proved to a man far less sagacious than Hampden that the time for compromise had gone by. He was therefore a warm supporter of the [[Grand Remonstrance]], and was marked out as one of the five impeached members, known thenceforth in history as the [[Five Members]] (the others being [[John Pym]], [[Arthur Haselrig]], [[Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles|Denzil Holles]] and [[William Strode]]) whose attempted arrest brought at last the opposing parties into open collision. In the angry scene which arose on the proposal to print the Grand Remonstrance, it was Hampden's personal intervention which prevented an actual conflict, and it was after the impeachment had been attempted that Hampden laid down the two conditions under which resistance to the king became the duty of a good subject.  Those conditions were:\n*an attack upon religion and\n*an attack upon the fundamental laws.\n\nThere can be no doubt that Hampden fully believed that both those conditions were fulfilled at the opening of 1642.\n\n==English Civil War==\n\nWhen the [[English Civil War]] began, Hampden was appointed a member of the [[ Committee of Safety (England) #1642\u20131644 | Committee of Safety]], levied a [[regiment]] of Buckinghamshire men for the parliamentary cause, and in his capacity of deputy-lieutenant carried out the parliamentary [[Militia Ordinance]] in the county. In the earlier operations of the war he bore himself gallantly and well. He took no actual part in the [[Battle of Edgehill]] (23 October 1642). His troops in the rear,  however, arrested [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]]'s charge at [[Kineton]], and he urged Essex to renew the attack here, and also after the disaster at [[Battle of Brentford (1642)|Brentford]]. In the spring of 1643, Hampden's regiment took part in the [[siege of Reading]], which surrendered on 27 April. Although Essex intended to advance on the King's headquarters at Oxford, he remained at Reading because of widespread sickness in the army, a shortage of cavalry and to await a paymaster with funds to pay his troops. In early June 1643 he moved his army to Thame making his headquarters there on 10 June.\n\nBut it is not on his skill as a regimental officer that Hampden's fame rests. In war as in peace his distinction lay in his power of disentangling the essential part from the non-essential. In the previous constitutional struggle he had seen that the one thing necessary was to establish the supremacy of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].  In the military struggle which followed he saw, as Cromwell saw afterwards, that the one thing necessary was to beat the enemy.  He protested at once against Essex's hesitations and compromises.  In the formation of the confederacy of the six associated counties, which was to supply a basis for Cromwell's operations, he took an active part.  His influence was felt alike in parliament and in the field but he was not in supreme command, and he had none of that impatience which often leads able men to fail in the execution of orders of which they disapprove.\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Hampden's monument, Chalgrove.jpg|thumb|Hampden's Monument, [[Chalgrove]]. A monument to John Hampden, who was mortally wounded 550 yards north of here in 1643 whilst fighting in the English Civil War on [[Battle of Chalgrove Field|Chalgrove Field]]]]\n\nOn the night of 17 June 1643, [[Prince Rupert]] sortied on a raid out of Oxford to capture the Parliamentarian army's paymaster, but while that failed, did succeed the next morning in overwhelming two of Essex's small garrison outposts at [[Postcombe]] and [[Chinnor]]. Hampden rode as a volunteer with 1,100 cavalry and dragoons commanded by Sir [[Philip Stapleton]] in pursuit of Rupert, with the intention of delaying him long enough for a larger force from Essex's main army to cut off his retreat. Rupert halted his own cavalry at [[Chalgrove]] to ambush the pursuit and allow 800 less mobile troops to escape via the ford of the [[River Thame]] at [[Chiselhampton]]. During the ensuing [[Battle of Chalgrove Field]], Hampden was mortally wounded (some sources claim in the shoulder by two carbine balls, others by fragments from his own pistol exploding<ref>Britannica 1911 (article \"HAMPDEN, JOHN\") \"two carbine balls\".

Sir Robert assured him that he bought them in Paris from an eminent maker and proved them himself. It appeared on examining the other pistol that it was loaded to the muzzle with several supernumerary charges, owning to the carelessness of a servant. He was ordered to see that the pistols were loaded every morning which he did but without drawing the former charge.\" An exhumation of Hampden's body in 1828 showed that there was no damage to the shoulder but his 'right hand was shattered by the bursting of his pistol, and death probably ensued from [[tetanus|lockjaw]] arising out of extensive injury to the nervous system'.<ref>Frederick George Lee, The History, description and antiquities of the Prebendal Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Thame in the county and diocese of Oxford.

During the preceding winter, Hampden had associated himself with John Pym's \"Middle Group\" in Parliament, which opposed any peace moves to the King except on favorable terms. At the same time he had worked to moderate the militancy of the parliamentary \"War Party\". Although Hampden was privately critical of Essex for not aggressively attacking after avoiding defeat at Edgehill and the standoff at [[Battle of Turnham Green|Turnham Green]], he remained publicly loyal and helped Essex resist the criticisms of the War Party. His death took with it a key link between the factions.

It is the capital of the [[Nouvelle-Aquitaine]] region, as well as the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called ''\"Bordelais\"'' (for men) or ''\"Bordelaises\"'' (women). The term \"Bordelais\" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.\n\nBeing at the center of a major wine-growing and wine-producing region, Bordeaux remains a prominent powerhouse and exercises significant influence on the world wine industry although no wine production is conducted within the city limits.

The Romans were defeated and their commander, the [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Lucius Cassius Longinus (consul 107 BC)|Lucius Cassius Longinus]], was killed in battle. <ref> {{cite web |url=https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/138248 |title=Places: 138248 (Burdigala) |author=Sivan, H., R.

In 276 it was sacked by the [[Vandals]]. The Vandals attacked again in 409, followed by the [[Visigoths]] in 414, and the [[Franks]] in 498, and afterwards the city fell into a period of relative obscurity.\n\n[[File:Merovingian tremisses minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint Etienne late 6th century.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Tremissis|tremisses]] minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint-\u00c9tienne, late 6th century. [[British Museum]].]]\nIn the late 6th century the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Francia|kingdom of the Franks]], but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish [[Duchy of Vasconia]]. Around 585 Gallactorius was made count of [[County of Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] and fought the Basques.\n\nIn 732 the city was plundered by the troops of [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi|Abd er Rahman]] who stormed the fortifications and overwhelmed the Aquitanian garrison. [[Odo the Great|Duke Eudes]] mustered a force to engage the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]], eventually engaging them in the [[Battle of the River Garonne]] somewhere near the river Dordogne. The battle had a high death toll, and although Eudes was defeated he had enough troops to engage in the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] and so retain his grip on Aquitaine.\n\nIn 735 following his father Eudes's death, the Aquitanian [[Hunald I|duke Hunald]] led a rebellion to which [[Charles]] responded by launching an expedition that captured Bordeaux.  However, it was not retained for long, during the following year the Frankish commander clashed in battle with the Aquitanians but then left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745 Aquitaine faced another expedition where Charles's sons Pepin and Carloman challenged Hunald's power and defeated him. Hunald's son [[Waiofar|Waifer]] replaced him and confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).\n\nDuring the last stage of the [[Pepin the Short#Expansion of the Frankish realm|war against Aquitaine]] (760\u2013768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to the troops of King [[Pepin the Short]].  Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (''Frontiacus'', ''Franciacus'') near Bordeaux on a hill across the border with the Basques (''Wascones''), where Basque commanders came and pledged their loyalty (769).\n\nIn 778 [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin (or Sihimin)]] was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupo]], and possibly leading to the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]]<sup>[9]-</sup>. In 814 Seguin was made Duke of [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]], but was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress a Basque rebellion. Under the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]], sometimes the [[Count of Bordeaux|Counts of Bordeaux]] held the title concomitantly with that of [[Duke of Gascony|Duke of Vasconia]]. They were to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the [[Viking]]s when they appeared in c. 844. In Autumn 845 the Vikings were raiding Bordeaux and Saintes, count [[Seguin II of Gascony|Seguin II]] marched on them but was captured and executed. \n\nAlthough the [[Port de la Lune|port of Bordeaux]] was a buzzing trade center, the stability and success of the city was constantly threatened by Germanic and Norman invasions. It wasn't until the marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry Plantagenet in 1152 established some sort of protection, as it provided a connection with the English. <ref> https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux </ref> After this union, Bordeaux suddenly had access to naval protection, which made the attacks from the nomadic groups few and far between. <ref>https://www.bordeaux-port.fr/en/port-bordeaux/history</ref>\n==== 12th century to the 20th century  ====\nFrom the 12th to the 15th century Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess [[Eleanor of Aquitaine|El\u00e9onore]] of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] to the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in [[Le Mans]], who within months of their wedding became King [[Henry II of England]]. The city flourished, primarily due to the wine trade, and the [[Bordeaux Cathedral|cathedral of St. Andr\u00e9]] was built. After granting a tax-free trade status with England, King Henry II was adored by the locals as they could be even more profitable in the wine trade, their main source of income. The city cathedral St. Cath\u00e9drale St-Andr\u00e9 was built in 1227, incorporating the artisan quarter of Saint-Paul. <ref>https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/bordeaux/background/history/a/nar/5e51aa7a-15f6-47ad-8ad8-719613858dc0/359293</ref>. It was also the capital of an independent state under [[Edward, the Black Prince]] (1362\u20131372), but after the [[Battle of Castillon]] (1453) it was annexed by France, and so extended its territory. \n\nIn 1462 Bordeaux created a local parliament. However, it only regained its importance during the 16th century when it became a major trading centre for sugar and slaves from the [[Caribbean|West Indies]], along with its traditional wine exports.<ref>''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'', \"Bordeaux struggles with slave past\", 28 September 2009.</ref>\n\nBordeaux adhered to the [[Fronde]], being effectively annexed to the [[Kingdom of France]] only in 1653, when the army of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] entered the city.\n[[File:Edouard Manet 026.jpg|thumb|[[\u00c9douard Manet]]: ''Harbour at Bordeaux'', 1871]]\n[[File:Bordeaux rue Sainte-Catherine avril 1905.jpg|thumb|right|Rue Sainte-Catherine in 1905]]\n\nThe 18th century saw another golden age of Bordeaux.<ref> https://www.commanderie.org/showRegion.action </ref> Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. [[Victor Hugo]] found the town so beautiful he said: \"Take [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]], add [[Antwerp]], and you have Bordeaux\". [[Baron Haussmann]], a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] to transform a then still quasi-medieval [[Paris]] into a \"modern\" capital that would make France proud.\n\nTowards the end of the [[Peninsula war]] on 12 March 1814, the [[Duke of Wellington]] sent [[William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford|William Beresford]] with two divisions and seized Bordeaux encountering little resistance. Bordeaux was largely anti-[[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]] and the majority supported the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], so the British troops were treated as liberators.\n\nIn 1870, at the beginning of the [[Franco-Prussian war]] against [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux  |title=Bordeaux |accessed date= March 30, 2020 12:03 am</ref> This recurred during the [[World War I]] and again very briefly during the [[World War II]], when it became clear that Paris would fall into German hands. However, on the last of these occasions the French capital was soon moved again to [[Vichy]]. In May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, [[Aristides de Sousa Mendes]], who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.\n\nFrom 1940 to 1943, the [[Regia Marina|Italian Royal Navy]] (''[[Regia Marina]] Italiana'') established [[BETASOM]], a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] from this base, which was also a major base for German [[U-boat]]s as headquarters of [[12th U-boat Flotilla]]. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.\n\n== Geography ==\nBordeaux is located close to the European [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the [[Garonne|river Garonne]], and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to [[ocean liner]]s. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.\n\n=== Climate ===\nBordeaux's climate is classified as a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), or in the [[Trewartha climate classification]] system as temperate oceanic or Do climate. Bordeaux lies close to the humid subtropical climate zone, its summers not quite warm enough for that classification.\n\nWinters are cool because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches {{convert|21|to|22|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}). The average seasonal winter temperature is {{convert|7.1|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, but recent winters have been warmer than this. Frosts in the winter occur several times during a winter, but snowfall is very rare, occurring only once every three years. The average summer seasonal temperature is {{convert|20.7|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. The [[2003 European heat wave|summer of 2003]] set a record with an average temperature of {{convert|23.3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.<ref>GHCN climate, GISS world climate averages, 1971\u20132000</ref>\n\n{{Bordeaux weatherbox}}\n\n== Economy ==\nBordeaux is a major centre for business in France as it has the sixth largest metropolitan population in France. It serves as a major regional center for trade, administration, services and industry.\n\n{{As of|2014}}, the GDP of Bordeaux is \u20ac32.7 Billion.\n\n=== Wine ===\n{{Main|Bordeaux wine}}\n\nThe wine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Hugh |title=World Atlas of Wine |edition=4th|year=1994 |place=London |publisher=Octopus Publishing Group Ltd |page=13}}</ref>\n\nBordeaux wine growing area has about {{convert|116160|ha|acre}} of [[vineyard]]s, 57 [[appellations]], 10,000 wine-producing estates (ch\u00e2teaux) and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intowine.com/bordeaux.html|title=Bordeaux Wine Region in France: World's Most Famous Fine Wine Region|publisher=IntoWine.com|accessdate=23 October 2009}}</ref> the Bordeaux area produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five ''premier cru'' ([[First Growth|first growth]]) red wines (four from M\u00e9doc and one, Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion, from Graves), established by the [[Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855]]:\n\nBoth red and [[Wine|white wines]] are made in the Bordeaux region. Red Bordeaux wine is called [[claret]] in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Merlot]], [[Cabernet Franc]], [[Petit verdot]], [[Malbec]], and, less commonly in recent years, [[Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re]].\n\nWhite Bordeaux is made from [[Sauvignon blanc]], [[S\u00e9millon]], and [[Muscadelle]]. [[Graves (wine region)|Sauternes]] is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, [[dessert wine]]s such as [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem]].\n\nBecause of a wine glut ([[wine lake]]) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and [[vine pull schemes]], the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.\n\nThe [[Cit\u00e9 du Vin]], a [[museum]] as well as a place of exhibitions, shows, movie projections and [[Academia|academic]] [[seminar]]s on the theme of [[wine]] opened its doors in June 2016.<ref>{{cite web|language=fr|url=http://www.sudouest.fr/2016/02/19/la-cite-du-vin-cernee-par-les-chantiers-2278033-2780.php|title=Bordeaux : la Cit\u00e9 du vin cern\u00e9e par les chantiers|date=19 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Others ===\nThe [[Laser M\u00e9gajoule]] will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing [[Research|fundamental research]] and the development of the [[laser]] and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] technologies. This project, carried by the [[Minister of Defence (France)|French Ministry of Defence]], involves an investment of 2&nbsp;billion euros. The \"Road of the lasers\", a major project of [[regional planning]], promotes regional investment in optical and laser related industries leading to the Bordeaux area having the most important concentration of optical and laser expertise in Europe.\n\nSome 20,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault]], [[EADS Sogerma]], [[Snecma]], [[Thales Group|Thales]], SNPE, and others. The [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault Falcon]] private jets are built there as well as the [[military aircraft]] [[Dassault Rafale|Rafale]] and [[Dassault Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000]], the [[Airbus A380]] [[cockpit]], the [[Booster (rocketry)|boosters]] of [[Ariane 5]], and the [[M51 (missile)|M51 SLBM]] [[missile]].\n\nTourism, especially [[wine tourism]], is a major industry. Globelink.co.uk mentioned Bordeaux as the best tourist destination in Europe in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globelink.co.uk/articles/country-information/france/3-best-places-to-retire-in-france.html|title=3 Best Places to Retire in France|publisher=Globelink.co.uk|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccess to the [[Port de la Lune|port]] from the Atlantic is via the [[Gironde estuary]]. Almost nine million tonnes of goods arrive and leave each year.\n\n=== Major companies ===\nThis list includes indigenous Bordeaux-based companies and companies that have major presence in Bordeaux, but are not necessarily headquartered there.\n\n*[[Arena (swimwear)|Arena]]\n*[[Cdiscount]]\n*\n*[[Dassault Group|Dassault]]\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*[[Marie Brizard et Roger International|Marie Brizard]]\n*[[McKesson Corporation]]\n*[[Oxbow (surfwear)|Oxbow]]\n*[[Pernod Ricard|Ricard]]\n*[[Sanofi-Aventis|Sanofi Aventis]]\n*[[Smurfit Kappa]]\n*[[Snecma|SNECMA]]\n*\n*[[Solectron]]\n*[[Thales Group]]\n*\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Population ==\nAt the January 2011 census, there were 239,399 inhabitants in the city proper (commune) of Bordeaux.

Then came [[Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou]] with 22.01%, followed by [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. Nationally, Nicolas Sarkozy led with 31.18%, then S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal with 25.87%, followed by Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 18.57%. After these came Jean-Marie Le Pen with 10.44%, none of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. In the second round, the city of Bordeaux gave S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal 52.44% against 47.56% for Nicolas Sarkozy, the latter being elected [[President of the Republic]] with 53.06% against 46.94% for S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal. The abstention rates for Bordeaux were 14.52% in the first round and 15.90% in the second round. This is an earthquake in Bordeaux, a city deeply rooted right traditions{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}.\n\nIn the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. It should be added that after the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of Gironde switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP [[Chantal Bourragu\u00e9]] was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate [[Beatrice Desaigues]]. In the second round, it was [[Chantal Bourragu\u00e9]] who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea [[Alain Jupp\u00e9]] confronted the General Counsel PS Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Jupp\u00e9 was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for [[Mich\u00e8le Delaunay]]. In the second round, it was finally Mich\u00e8le Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Jupp\u00e9, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency \"Mayor\" showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.\n\nIn 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Jupp\u00e9 and the President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine Socialist [[Alain Rousset]]. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal and [[Mich\u00e8le Delaunay]] in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Jupp\u00e9 who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62%, far ahead of Alain Rousset who has managed to get 34.14%. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right's numbers.\n\nIn the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district \"Southwest\", here are the results:\n\nUMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front G\u00e9rard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% in the first round and 53.59% in the second round.\n\n<small>''Only candidates obtaining more than 5% are listed''</small>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ 2007 Presidential Election<ref>[http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Elections/Les-resultats/Presidentielles/elecresult__presidentielle_2007/%28path%29/presidentielle_2007/072/033/33063.html R\u00e9sultat de l'\u00e9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de 2007 \u00e0 Bordeaux] sur le site du minist\u00e8re de l'int\u00e9rieur.</ref>\n!rowspan=2|Candidate !!colspan=2|Ist round !!colspan=2|IInd round\n|-\n!Bordeaux !!

Bordeaux, [[Port of the Moon|Port of the moon]], has been inscribed on [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage List]] as ''\"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble\"''.\n\nBordeaux is home to one of Europe's biggest 18th-century architectural urban areas, making it a sought-after destination for tourists and cinema production crews. It stands out as one of the first French cities, after [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], to have entered an era of [[urbanism]] and metropolitan big scale projects, with the team Gabriel father and son, architects for King [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], under the supervision of two intendants (Governors), first [[Nicolas-Fran\u00e7ois Dupr\u00e9 de Saint-Maur]] then the Marquis de Tourny.\n\n=== Buildings ===\nMain sights include:\n* ''[[Place des Quinconces]]'', the largest square in France.\n* ''Monument aux Girondins''\n* ''[[Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux|Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre]]'' (1780), a large neoclassical theater built in the 18th century.\n* ''All\u00e9es de Tourny''\n* ''Cours de l'Intendance''\n* ''Place du Chapelet''\n* ''[[Place de la Bourse]]'' (1730\u20131775), designed by the Royal architect [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel|Jacques Ange Gabriel]] as landscape for an [[equestrian statue]] of Louis XV.\n* ''Place du Parlement''\n* ''Place Saint-Pierre''\n*''[[Pont de pierre (Bordeaux)|Pont de pierre]] (1822)''\n* ''Saint-Andr\u00e9 Cathedral'', consecrated by [[Pope Urban II]] in 1096.

The central lift span is {{convert|117|m|ft|0|adj=mid|abbr=off|-long}} and can be lifted vertically up to {{convert|53|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} to let tall ships pass underneath. The \u20ac160 million bridge was inaugurated by President [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]] and Mayor Alain Jupp\u00e9 on 16 March 2013. The bridge was named after the late [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]], who was a former Prime Minister and [[Mayor (France)|Mayor]] of Bordeaux.\n\n=== Shopping ===\nBordeaux has many shopping options. In the heart of Bordeaux is ''[[Sainte-Catherine Street (Bordeaux)|Rue Sainte-Catherine]]''. This pedestrian-only shopping street has {{convert|1.2|km|mi|sp=us}} of shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s; it is also one of the longest shopping streets in Europe. ''Rue Sainte-Catherine'' starts at ''Place de la Victoire'' and ends at ''Place de la Com\u00e9die'' by the ''Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre''. The shops become progressively more upmarket as one moves towards ''Place de la Com\u00e9die'' and the nearby ''Cours de l'Intendance'' is where one finds the more exclusive shops and boutiques.\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:GrandTheatreBordeaux2.jpg|thumb|Maison de l\u2019\u00c9conomie Cr\u00e9ative et de la Culture en Aquitaine]]\n[[File:RB 20200222 Bordeaux-11.jpg|thumb|Maison de l\u2019\u00c9conomie Cr\u00e9ative et de la Culture en Aquitaine]]\nBordeaux is also the first city in France to have created, in the 1980s, an architecture exhibition and research centre, ''[[Arc en r\u00eave]]''.{{citation needed |date=January 2018}} Bordeaux offers a large number of cinemas, theatres, and is the home of the [[Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux|Op\u00e9ra national de Bordeaux]]. There are many music venues of varying capacity. The city also offers several festivals throughout the year.\n\n== Transport ==\n=== Road ===\nBordeaux is an important road and [[Interchange (road)|motorway junction]]. The city is connected to Paris by the [[A10 autoroute (France)|A10]] motorway, with Lyon by the [[A89 autoroute|A89]], with Toulouse by the [[A62 autoroute|A62]], and with Spain by the [[A63 autoroute|A63]]. There is a {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Beltway|ring road]] called the \"Rocade\" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.\n\nBordeaux has five road bridges that cross the [[Garonne]], the Pont de pierre built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the [[Pont d'Aquitaine]], a suspended bridge downstream from downtown, and the Pont Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the [[Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas]], was constructed in 2009\u20132012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a [[vertical-lift bridge]] with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.\nAnother bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |title=Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc \u2013 La CUB |date=24 October 2013 |work=archive.org |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024224845/http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |archivedate=24 October 2013 |df=dmy}}</ref>\n\nLacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. [[Bike lane|Cycle lanes]] and [[bus lane]]s that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid [[bicycle-sharing system]] with automated stations has been established in 2010.\n\n=== Rail ===\nThe main railway station, [[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]], near the center of the city, has 12&nbsp;million passengers a year. It is served by the French national ([[SNCF]]) railway's high speed train, the [[TGV]], that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as [[Lille]], Brussels, [[Amsterdam]], [[Cologne]], Geneva and London. The TGV also serves [[Toulouse]] and [[Irun]] (Spain) from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to [[Nantes]], Nice, [[Marseille]] and [[Lyon]]. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains ([[Transport express r\u00e9gional|TER]]) operated by the SNCF to [[Arcachon]], [[Limoges]], [[Agen]], [[P\u00e9rigueux]], [[Langon, Gironde|Langon]], [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], Le M\u00e9doc, Angoul\u00eame and [[Bayonne]].\n\nHistorically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by [[Gustave Eiffel]], to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.\n\nThe two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of {{convert|30|km/h|0|abbr=on}} became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has four tracks and allows trains to pass at {{convert|60|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://aquitaine.fr/politiques-regionales/transports/pont-ferroviaire-de-bordeaux.html Pont Ferroviaire de Bordeaux] on aquitaine.fr</ref> During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.\n\nSince July 2017, the [[LGV Sud Europe Atlantique]] is fully operational and makes Bordeaux city 2h04 from Paris.\n\n=== Air ===\nBordeaux is served by [[Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport]], located {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city centre in the suburban city of [[M\u00e9rignac, Gironde|M\u00e9rignac]].\n\n[[File:A\u00e9roport Bx M\u00e9rignac.JPG|thumb|[[Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport]]]]\n\n=== Trams, buses and boats ===\n[[File:Bordeaux-lawn-track-&-vines1.jpg|thumb|Tramway in Bordeaux]]\nBordeaux has an important public transport system called [[Transports Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole]] (TBM). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:\n* 4 [[Tramway de Bordeaux|tram lines]] ([[Bordeaux Tramway Line A|A]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line B|B]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line C|C]] and [[Bordeaux Tramway Line D|D]])\n* 75 [[Bus lines in Bordeaux|bus routes]], all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)\n* 13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)\n* An [[Trolleybus|electric bus]] shuttle in the city centre\n* A boat shuttle on the Garonne river\nThis network is operated from 5&nbsp;am to 2&nbsp;am.\n\nThere had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the [[Tramway de Bordeaux]] system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses ground-level power supply technology [[Ground-level power supply|(APS)]], a new cable-free technology developed by French company [[Alstom]] and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with [[Limited-access road|limited access]] for cars.\n\nThe planned Bordeaux tramway system is to link with the airport to the city centre towards the end of 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/transports/bordeaux-voici-le-trace-du-tramway-qui-va-desservir-l-aeroport-1461940859|title=Bordeaux : voici le trac\u00e9 du tramway qui va desservir l'a\u00e9roport|date=29 April 2016|website=France Bleu}}</ref>\n\n=== Taxis ===\nThere are more than 400 [[taxicab]]s in Bordeaux.\n\n===Public transportation statistics===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bordeaux, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 51 min. 12.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 13 min, while 15.5% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is {{convert|7|km|abbr=on}}, while 8% travel for over {{convert|12|km|abbr=on}} in a single direction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index_France_Bordeaux-924|title=Bordeaux Public Transportation Statistics|publisher=Global Public Transit Index by Moovit|accessdate=June 19, 2017}} [[File:CC-BY_icon.svg|50x50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [[creativecommons:by/4.0/|Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License]].</ref>\n\n== Sport ==\n[[File:Bordeaux Stade Lescure entr\u00e9e.JPG|thumb|Entrance to the Stade Chaban-Delmas]]{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe 41,458-capacity [[Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux]] is the largest stadium in Bordeaux. The stadium was opened in 2015 and replaced the [[Stade Chaban-Delmas]], which was a venue for the [[FIFA World Cup]] in 1938 and 1998, as well as the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]]. In the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the [[Battle of Bordeaux (football)|Battle of Bordeaux]]. The ground was formerly known as the ''Stade du Parc Lescure'' until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]].\n\nThere are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Girondins de Bordeaux]] is the [[association football|football]] team, playing in [[Ligue 1]] in the [[Football in France|French football]] championship. [[Union Bordeaux B\u00e8gles]] is a [[rugby union|rugby]] team in the [[Top 14]] in the [[National Rugby League (France)|Ligue Nationale de Rugby]].\nSkateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a beautiful quay which runs along the Garonne river. On the quay there is a skate-park divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skate-park is very well maintained by the municipality.\n\nBordeaux is also the home to one of the strongest [[cricket]] teams in France and are champions of the South West League.\n\nThere is a {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} wooden [[velodrome]], V\u00e9lodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of [[UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics|UCI Track Cycling World Cup]] events.\n\nThe 2015 Trophee Eric Bompard was in Bordeaux. But the Free Skate was cancelled in all of the divisions due to the Paris bombing(s) and aftermath. The Short Program occurred hours before the bombing. French skaters Chafik Besseghier (68.36) in 10th place, Romain Ponsart (62.86) in 11th. Mae-Berenice-Meite (46.82) in 11th and Laurine Lecavelier (46.53) in 12th. Vanessa James/Morgan Cipres (65.75) in 2nd.\n\nBetween 1951 and 1955, an annual Formula 1 motor race was held on a 2.5-kilometre circuit which looped around the Esplanade des Quinconces and along the waterfront, attracting drivers such as [[Juan Manuel Fangio]], [[Stirling Moss]], [[Jean Behra]] and [[Maurice Trintignant]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pike |first1=Tim |title=When Bordeaux city centre became a Formula 1 racing track |url=http://invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com/2014/07/when-bordeaux-city-centre-became.html |website=invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com |accessdate=6 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n[[File:Michel-eyquem-de-montaigne 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Michel de Montaigne]]]]\n{{Div col|colwidth=35em}}\n* [[Jean Alaux]] (1786\u20131864), painter\n*[[Bertrand Andrieu]] (1761\u20131822), engraver\n*[[Jean Anouilh]] (1910\u20131987), dramatist\n*[[Yvonne Arnaud]] (1892\u20131958), pianist, singer and actress\n*[[Ausonius|Decimus Magnus Ausonius]] (c. 310\u2013395), Roman poet and rhetorician\n*[[Floyd Ayit\u00e9]], (born 1988), Togolese footballer\n*[[Jonathan Ayit\u00e9]], (born 1985), Togolese footballer\n*[[Christine Barbe]], winemaker\n*[[G\u00e9rard Bayo]] (born 1936), writer and poet,\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Bigot]] (1703\u20131778), last \"Intendant\" of New France\n*[[Gr\u00e9gory Bourdy]], (born 1982), golfer\n*[[Samuel Boutal]], (born 1969), footballer\n*[[Edmond de Caillou]] (died c.

{{IPA-oc|bu\u027e\u02c8\u00f0\u025bw|}}) is a port city on the [[Garonne]] in the [[Gironde]] [[Departments of France|department]] in Southwestern [[France]].\n\nThe municipality ([[Communes of France|commune]]) of Bordeaux proper has a population of 257,804 (2019). Bordeaux is the centre of the [[Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole]] that has a population of 783,081 (2017) and includes its [[suburb]]s and close [[satellite town]]s. With 1,195,335 in the metropolitan area, it is the sixth-largest in France, after Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse, and Lille. It is the capital of the [[Nouvelle-Aquitaine]] region, as well as the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called ''\"Bordelais\"'' (for men) or ''\"Bordelaises\"'' (women). The term \"Bordelais\" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.\n\nBeing at the center of a major wine-growing and wine-producing region, Bordeaux remains a prominent powerhouse and exercises significant influence on the world wine industry although no wine production is conducted within the city limits. It is home to the world's main wine fair, [[Vinexpo]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vinexpo.com/en/a-propos/historique |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706075152/http://www.vinexpo.com/en/a-propos/historique/ |archivedate=6 July 2009}}</ref> and the wine economy in the metro area takes in 14.5&nbsp;billion euros each year. [[Bordeaux wine]] has been produced in the region since the 8th century.

The Romans were defeated and their commander, the [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Lucius Cassius Longinus (consul 107 BC)|Lucius Cassius Longinus]], was killed in battle. <ref> {{cite web |url=https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/138248 |title=Places: 138248 (Burdigala) |author=Sivan, H., R.

In 276 it was sacked by the [[Vandals]]. The Vandals attacked again in 409, followed by the [[Visigoths]] in 414, and the [[Franks]] in 498, and afterwards the city fell into a period of relative obscurity.\n\n[[File:Merovingian tremisses minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint Etienne late 6th century.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Tremissis|tremisses]] minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint-\u00c9tienne, late 6th century. [[British Museum]].]]\nIn the late 6th century the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Francia|kingdom of the Franks]], but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish [[Duchy of Vasconia]]. Around 585 Gallactorius was made count of [[County of Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] and fought the Basques.\n\nIn 732 the city was plundered by the troops of [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi|Abd er Rahman]] who stormed the fortifications and overwhelmed the Aquitanian garrison. [[Odo the Great|Duke Eudes]] mustered a force to engage the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]], eventually engaging them in the [[Battle of the River Garonne]] somewhere near the river Dordogne. The battle had a high death toll, and although Eudes was defeated he had enough troops to engage in the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] and so retain his grip on Aquitaine.\n\nIn 735 following his father Eudes's death, the Aquitanian [[Hunald I|duke Hunald]] led a rebellion to which [[Charles]] responded by launching an expedition that captured Bordeaux.  However, it was not retained for long, during the following year the Frankish commander clashed in battle with the Aquitanians but then left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745 Aquitaine faced another expedition where Charles's sons Pepin and Carloman challenged Hunald's power and defeated him. Hunald's son [[Waiofar|Waifer]] replaced him and confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).\n\nDuring the last stage of the [[Pepin the Short#Expansion of the Frankish realm|war against Aquitaine]] (760\u2013768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to the troops of King [[Pepin the Short]].  Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (''Frontiacus'', ''Franciacus'') near Bordeaux on a hill across the border with the Basques (''Wascones''), where Basque commanders came and pledged their loyalty (769).\n\nIn 778 [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin (or Sihimin)]] was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupo]], and possibly leading to the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]]<sup>[9]-</sup>. In 814 Seguin was made Duke of [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]], but was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress a Basque rebellion. Under the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]], sometimes the [[Count of Bordeaux|Counts of Bordeaux]] held the title concomitantly with that of [[Duke of Gascony|Duke of Vasconia]]. They were to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the [[Viking]]s when they appeared in c. 844. In Autumn 845 the Vikings were raiding Bordeaux and Saintes, count [[Seguin II of Gascony|Seguin II]] marched on them but was captured and executed. \n\nAlthough the [[Port de la Lune|port of Bordeaux]] was a buzzing trade center, the stability and success of the city was constantly threatened by Germanic and Norman invasions. It wasn't until the marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry Plantagenet in 1152 established some sort of protection, as it provided a connection with the English. <ref> https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux </ref> After this union, Bordeaux suddenly had access to naval protection, which made the attacks from the nomadic groups few and far between. <ref>https://www.bordeaux-port.fr/en/port-bordeaux/history</ref>\n==== 12th century to the 20th century  ====\nFrom the 12th to the 15th century Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess [[Eleanor of Aquitaine|El\u00e9onore]] of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] to the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in [[Le Mans]], who within months of their wedding became King [[Henry II of England]]. The city flourished, primarily due to the wine trade, and the [[Bordeaux Cathedral|cathedral of St. Andr\u00e9]] was built. After granting a tax-free trade status with England, King Henry II was adored by the locals as they could be even more profitable in the wine trade, their main source of income. The city cathedral St. Cath\u00e9drale St-Andr\u00e9 was built in 1227, incorporating the artisan quarter of Saint-Paul. <ref>https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/bordeaux/background/history/a/nar/5e51aa7a-15f6-47ad-8ad8-719613858dc0/359293</ref>. It was also the capital of an independent state under [[Edward, the Black Prince]] (1362\u20131372), but after the [[Battle of Castillon]] (1453) it was annexed by France, and so extended its territory. \n\nIn 1462 Bordeaux created a local parliament. However, it only regained its importance during the 16th century when it became a major trading centre for sugar and slaves from the [[Caribbean|West Indies]], along with its traditional wine exports.<ref>''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'', \"Bordeaux struggles with slave past\", 28 September 2009.</ref>\n\nBordeaux adhered to the [[Fronde]], being effectively annexed to the [[Kingdom of France]] only in 1653, when the army of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] entered the city.\n[[File:Edouard Manet 026.jpg|thumb|[[\u00c9douard Manet]]: ''Harbour at Bordeaux'', 1871]]\n[[File:Bordeaux rue Sainte-Catherine avril 1905.jpg|thumb|right|Rue Sainte-Catherine in 1905]]\n\nThe 18th century saw another golden age of Bordeaux.<ref> https://www.commanderie.org/showRegion.action </ref> Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. [[Victor Hugo]] found the town so beautiful he said: \"Take [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]], add [[Antwerp]], and you have Bordeaux\". [[Baron Haussmann]], a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] to transform a then still quasi-medieval [[Paris]] into a \"modern\" capital that would make France proud.\n\nTowards the end of the [[Peninsula war]] on 12 March 1814, the [[Duke of Wellington]] sent [[William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford|William Beresford]] with two divisions and seized Bordeaux encountering little resistance. Bordeaux was largely anti-[[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]] and the majority supported the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], so the British troops were treated as liberators.\n\nIn 1870, at the beginning of the [[Franco-Prussian war]] against [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux  |title=Bordeaux |accessed date= March 30, 2020 12:03 am</ref> This recurred during the [[World War I]] and again very briefly during the [[World War II]], when it became clear that Paris would fall into German hands. However, on the last of these occasions the French capital was soon moved again to [[Vichy]]. In May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, [[Aristides de Sousa Mendes]], who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.\n\nFrom 1940 to 1943, the [[Regia Marina|Italian Royal Navy]] (''[[Regia Marina]] Italiana'') established [[BETASOM]], a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] from this base, which was also a major base for German [[U-boat]]s as headquarters of [[12th U-boat Flotilla]]. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.\n\n== Geography ==\nBordeaux is located close to the European [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the [[Garonne|river Garonne]], and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to [[ocean liner]]s. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.\n\n=== Climate ===\nBordeaux's climate is classified as a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), or in the [[Trewartha climate classification]] system as temperate oceanic or Do climate. Bordeaux lies close to the humid subtropical climate zone, its summers not quite warm enough for that classification.\n\nWinters are cool because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches {{convert|21|to|22|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}). The average seasonal winter temperature is {{convert|7.1|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, but recent winters have been warmer than this. Frosts in the winter occur several times during a winter, but snowfall is very rare, occurring only once every three years. The average summer seasonal temperature is {{convert|20.7|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. The [[2003 European heat wave|summer of 2003]] set a record with an average temperature of {{convert|23.3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.<ref>GHCN climate, GISS world climate averages, 1971\u20132000</ref>\n\n{{Bordeaux weatherbox}}\n\n== Economy ==\nBordeaux is a major centre for business in France as it has the sixth largest metropolitan population in France. It serves as a major regional center for trade, administration, services and industry.\n\n{{As of|2014}}, the GDP of Bordeaux is \u20ac32.7 Billion.\n\n=== Wine ===\n{{Main|Bordeaux wine}}\n\nThe wine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Hugh |title=World Atlas of Wine |edition=4th|year=1994 |place=London |publisher=Octopus Publishing Group Ltd |page=13}}</ref>\n\nBordeaux wine growing area has about {{convert|116160|ha|acre}} of [[vineyard]]s, 57 [[appellations]], 10,000 wine-producing estates (ch\u00e2teaux) and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intowine.com/bordeaux.html|title=Bordeaux Wine Region in France: World's Most Famous Fine Wine Region|publisher=IntoWine.com|accessdate=23 October 2009}}</ref> the Bordeaux area produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five ''premier cru'' ([[First Growth|first growth]]) red wines (four from M\u00e9doc and one, Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion, from Graves), established by the [[Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855]]:\n\nBoth red and [[Wine|white wines]] are made in the Bordeaux region. Red Bordeaux wine is called [[claret]] in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Merlot]], [[Cabernet Franc]], [[Petit verdot]], [[Malbec]], and, less commonly in recent years, [[Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re]].\n\nWhite Bordeaux is made from [[Sauvignon blanc]], [[S\u00e9millon]], and [[Muscadelle]]. [[Graves (wine region)|Sauternes]] is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, [[dessert wine]]s such as [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem]].\n\nBecause of a wine glut ([[wine lake]]) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and [[vine pull schemes]], the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.\n\nThe [[Cit\u00e9 du Vin]], a [[museum]] as well as a place of exhibitions, shows, movie projections and [[Academia|academic]] [[seminar]]s on the theme of [[wine]] opened its doors in June 2016.<ref>{{cite web|language=fr|url=http://www.sudouest.fr/2016/02/19/la-cite-du-vin-cernee-par-les-chantiers-2278033-2780.php|title=Bordeaux : la Cit\u00e9 du vin cern\u00e9e par les chantiers|date=19 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Others ===\nThe [[Laser M\u00e9gajoule]] will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing [[Research|fundamental research]] and the development of the [[laser]] and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] technologies. This project, carried by the [[Minister of Defence (France)|French Ministry of Defence]], involves an investment of 2&nbsp;billion euros. The \"Road of the lasers\", a major project of [[regional planning]], promotes regional investment in optical and laser related industries leading to the Bordeaux area having the most important concentration of optical and laser expertise in Europe.\n\nSome 20,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault]], [[EADS Sogerma]], [[Snecma]], [[Thales Group|Thales]], SNPE, and others. The [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault Falcon]] private jets are built there as well as the [[military aircraft]] [[Dassault Rafale|Rafale]] and [[Dassault Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000]], the [[Airbus A380]] [[cockpit]], the [[Booster (rocketry)|boosters]] of [[Ariane 5]], and the [[M51 (missile)|M51 SLBM]] [[missile]].\n\nTourism, especially [[wine tourism]], is a major industry. Globelink.co.uk mentioned Bordeaux as the best tourist destination in Europe in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globelink.co.uk/articles/country-information/france/3-best-places-to-retire-in-france.html|title=3 Best Places to Retire in France|publisher=Globelink.co.uk|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccess to the [[Port de la Lune|port]] from the Atlantic is via the [[Gironde estuary]]. Almost nine million tonnes of goods arrive and leave each year.\n\n=== Major companies ===\nThis list includes indigenous Bordeaux-based companies and companies that have major presence in Bordeaux, but are not necessarily headquartered there.\n\n*[[Arena (swimwear)|Arena]]\n*[[Cdiscount]]\n*\n*[[Dassault Group|Dassault]]\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*[[Marie Brizard et Roger International|Marie Brizard]]\n*[[McKesson Corporation]]\n*[[Oxbow (surfwear)|Oxbow]]\n*[[Pernod Ricard|Ricard]]\n*[[Sanofi-Aventis|Sanofi Aventis]]\n*[[Smurfit Kappa]]\n*[[Snecma|SNECMA]]\n*\n*[[Solectron]]\n*[[Thales Group]]\n*\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Population ==\nAt the January 2011 census, there were 239,399 inhabitants in the city proper (commune) of Bordeaux.

Then came [[Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou]] with 22.01%, followed by [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. Nationally, Nicolas Sarkozy led with 31.18%, then S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal with 25.87%, followed by Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 18.57%. After these came Jean-Marie Le Pen with 10.44%, none of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. In the second round, the city of Bordeaux gave S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal 52.44% against 47.56% for Nicolas Sarkozy, the latter being elected [[President of the Republic]] with 53.06% against 46.94% for S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal. The abstention rates for Bordeaux were 14.52% in the first round and 15.90% in the second round. This is an earthquake in Bordeaux, a city deeply rooted right traditions{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}.\n\nIn the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. It should be added that after the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of Gironde switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP [[Chantal Bourragu\u00e9]] was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate [[Beatrice Desaigues]]. In the second round, it was [[Chantal Bourragu\u00e9]] who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea [[Alain Jupp\u00e9]] confronted the General Counsel PS Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Jupp\u00e9 was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for [[Mich\u00e8le Delaunay]]. In the second round, it was finally Mich\u00e8le Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Jupp\u00e9, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency \"Mayor\" showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.\n\nIn 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Jupp\u00e9 and the President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine Socialist [[Alain Rousset]]. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal and [[Mich\u00e8le Delaunay]] in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Jupp\u00e9 who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62%, far ahead of Alain Rousset who has managed to get 34.14%. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right's numbers.\n\nIn the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district \"Southwest\", here are the results:\n\nUMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front G\u00e9rard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% in the first round and 53.59% in the second round.\n\n<small>''Only candidates obtaining more than 5% are listed''</small>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ 2007 Presidential Election<ref>[http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Elections/Les-resultats/Presidentielles/elecresult__presidentielle_2007/%28path%29/presidentielle_2007/072/033/33063.html R\u00e9sultat de l'\u00e9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de 2007 \u00e0 Bordeaux] sur le site du minist\u00e8re de l'int\u00e9rieur.</ref>\n!rowspan=2|Candidate !!colspan=2|Ist round !!colspan=2|IInd round\n|-\n!Bordeaux !!

It stands out as one of the first French cities, after [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], to have entered an era of [[urbanism]] and metropolitan big scale projects, with the team Gabriel father and son, architects for King [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], under the supervision of two intendants (Governors), first [[Nicolas-Fran\u00e7ois Dupr\u00e9 de Saint-Maur]] then the Marquis de Tourny.\n\n=== Buildings ===\nMain sights include:\n* ''[[Place des Quinconces]]'', the largest square in France.\n* ''Monument aux Girondins''\n* ''[[Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux|Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre]]'', a large neoclassical theater built in the 18th century.\n* ''All\u00e9es de Tourny''\n* ''Cours de l'Intendance''\n* ''Place du Chapelet''\n* ''[[Place de la Bourse]]''(1730\u20131775), designed by the Royal architect [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel|Jacques Ange Gabriel]] as landscape for an [[equestrian statue]] of Louis XV.\n* ''Place du Parlement''\n* ''Place Saint-Pierre''\n*''[[Pont de pierre (Bordeaux)|Pont de pierre]]''\n* ''Saint-Andr\u00e9 Cathedral'', consecrated by [[Pope Urban II]] in 1096.

The central lift span is {{convert|117|m|ft|0|adj=mid|abbr=off|-long}} and can be lifted vertically up to {{convert|53|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} to let tall ships pass underneath. The \u20ac160 million bridge was inaugurated by President [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]] and Mayor Alain Jupp\u00e9 on 16 March 2013. The bridge was named after the late [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]], who was a former Prime Minister and [[Mayor (France)|Mayor]] of Bordeaux.\n\n=== Shopping ===\nBordeaux has many shopping options. In the heart of Bordeaux is ''[[Sainte-Catherine Street (Bordeaux)|Rue Sainte-Catherine]]''. This pedestrian-only shopping street has {{convert|1.2|km|mi|sp=us}} of shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s; it is also one of the longest shopping streets in Europe. ''Rue Sainte-Catherine'' starts at ''Place de la Victoire'' and ends at ''Place de la Com\u00e9die'' by the ''Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre''. The shops become progressively more upmarket as one moves towards ''Place de la Com\u00e9die'' and the nearby ''Cours de l'Intendance'' is where one finds the more exclusive shops and boutiques.\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:GrandTheatreBordeaux2.jpg|thumb|Maison de l\u2019\u00c9conomie Cr\u00e9ative et de la Culture en Aquitaine]]\n[[File:RB 20200222 Bordeaux-11.jpg|thumb|Maison de l\u2019\u00c9conomie Cr\u00e9ative et de la Culture en Aquitaine]]\nBordeaux is also the first city in France to have created, in the 1980s, an architecture exhibition and research centre, ''[[Arc en r\u00eave]]''.{{citation needed |date=January 2018}} Bordeaux offers a large number of cinemas, theatres, and is the home of the [[Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux|Op\u00e9ra national de Bordeaux]]. There are many music venues of varying capacity. The city also offers several festivals throughout the year.\n\n== Transport ==\n=== Road ===\nBordeaux is an important road and [[Interchange (road)|motorway junction]]. The city is connected to Paris by the [[A10 autoroute (France)|A10]] motorway, with Lyon by the [[A89 autoroute|A89]], with Toulouse by the [[A62 autoroute|A62]], and with Spain by the [[A63 autoroute|A63]]. There is a {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Beltway|ring road]] called the \"Rocade\" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.\n\nBordeaux has five road bridges that cross the [[Garonne]], the Pont de pierre built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the [[Pont d'Aquitaine]], a suspended bridge downstream from downtown, and the Pont Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the [[Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas]], was constructed in 2009\u20132012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a [[vertical-lift bridge]] with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.\nAnother bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |title=Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc \u2013 La CUB |date=24 October 2013 |work=archive.org |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024224845/http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |archivedate=24 October 2013 |df=dmy}}</ref>\n\nLacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. [[Bike lane|Cycle lanes]] and [[bus lane]]s that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid [[bicycle-sharing system]] with automated stations has been established in 2010.\n\n=== Rail ===\nThe main railway station, [[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]], near the center of the city, has 12&nbsp;million passengers a year. It is served by the French national ([[SNCF]]) railway's high speed train, the [[TGV]], that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as [[Lille]], Brussels, [[Amsterdam]], [[Cologne]], Geneva and London. The TGV also serves [[Toulouse]] and [[Irun]] (Spain) from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to [[Nantes]], Nice, [[Marseille]] and [[Lyon]]. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains ([[Transport express r\u00e9gional|TER]]) operated by the SNCF to [[Arcachon]], [[Limoges]], [[Agen]], [[P\u00e9rigueux]], [[Langon, Gironde|Langon]], [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], Le M\u00e9doc, Angoul\u00eame and [[Bayonne]].\n\nHistorically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by [[Gustave Eiffel]], to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.\n\nThe two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of {{convert|30|km/h|0|abbr=on}} became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has four tracks and allows trains to pass at {{convert|60|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://aquitaine.fr/politiques-regionales/transports/pont-ferroviaire-de-bordeaux.html Pont Ferroviaire de Bordeaux] on aquitaine.fr</ref> During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.\n\nSince July 2017, the [[LGV Sud Europe Atlantique]] is fully operational and makes Bordeaux city 2h04 from Paris.\n\n=== Air ===\nBordeaux is served by [[Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport]], located {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city centre in the suburban city of [[M\u00e9rignac, Gironde|M\u00e9rignac]].\n\n[[File:A\u00e9roport Bx M\u00e9rignac.JPG|thumb|[[Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport]]]]\n\n=== Trams, buses and boats ===\n[[File:Bordeaux-lawn-track-&-vines1.jpg|thumb|Tramway in Bordeaux]]\nBordeaux has an important public transport system called [[Transports Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole]] (TBM). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:\n* 4 [[Tramway de Bordeaux|tram lines]] ([[Bordeaux Tramway Line A|A]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line B|B]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line C|C]] and [[Bordeaux Tramway Line D|D]])\n* 75 [[Bus lines in Bordeaux|bus routes]], all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)\n* 13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)\n* An [[Trolleybus|electric bus]] shuttle in the city centre\n* A boat shuttle on the Garonne river\nThis network is operated from 5&nbsp;am to 2&nbsp;am.\n\nThere had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the [[Tramway de Bordeaux]] system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses ground-level power supply technology [[Ground-level power supply|(APS)]], a new cable-free technology developed by French company [[Alstom]] and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with [[Limited-access road|limited access]] for cars.\n\nThe planned Bordeaux tramway system is to link with the airport to the city centre towards the end of 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/transports/bordeaux-voici-le-trace-du-tramway-qui-va-desservir-l-aeroport-1461940859|title=Bordeaux : voici le trac\u00e9 du tramway qui va desservir l'a\u00e9roport|date=29 April 2016|website=France Bleu}}</ref>\n\n=== Taxis ===\nThere are more than 400 [[taxicab]]s in Bordeaux.\n\n===Public transportation statistics===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bordeaux, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 51 min. 12.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 13 min, while 15.5% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is {{convert|7|km|abbr=on}}, while 8% travel for over {{convert|12|km|abbr=on}} in a single direction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index_France_Bordeaux-924|title=Bordeaux Public Transportation Statistics|publisher=Global Public Transit Index by Moovit|accessdate=June 19, 2017}} [[File:CC-BY_icon.svg|50x50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [[creativecommons:by/4.0/|Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License]].</ref>\n\n== Sport ==\n[[File:Bordeaux Stade Lescure entr\u00e9e.JPG|thumb|Entrance to the Stade Chaban-Delmas]]{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe 41,458-capacity [[Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux]] is the largest stadium in Bordeaux. The stadium was opened in 2015 and replaced the [[Stade Chaban-Delmas]], which was a venue for the [[FIFA World Cup]] in 1938 and 1998, as well as the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]]. In the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the [[Battle of Bordeaux (football)|Battle of Bordeaux]]. The ground was formerly known as the ''Stade du Parc Lescure'' until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]].\n\nThere are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Girondins de Bordeaux]] is the [[association football|football]] team, playing in [[Ligue 1]] in the [[Football in France|French football]] championship. [[Union Bordeaux B\u00e8gles]] is a [[rugby union|rugby]] team in the [[Top 14]] in the [[National Rugby League (France)|Ligue Nationale de Rugby]].\nSkateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a beautiful quay which runs along the Garonne river. On the quay there is a skate-park divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skate-park is very well maintained by the municipality.\n\nBordeaux is also the home to one of the strongest [[cricket]] teams in France and are champions of the South West League.\n\nThere is a {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} wooden [[velodrome]], V\u00e9lodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of [[UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics|UCI Track Cycling World Cup]] events.\n\nThe 2015 Trophee Eric Bompard was in Bordeaux. But the Free Skate was cancelled in all of the divisions due to the Paris bombing(s) and aftermath. The Short Program occurred hours before the bombing. French skaters Chafik Besseghier (68.36) in 10th place, Romain Ponsart (62.86) in 11th. Mae-Berenice-Meite (46.82) in 11th and Laurine Lecavelier (46.53) in 12th. Vanessa James/Morgan Cipres (65.75) in 2nd.\n\nBetween 1951 and 1955, an annual Formula 1 motor race was held on a 2.5-kilometre circuit which looped around the Esplanade des Quinconces and along the waterfront, attracting drivers such as [[Juan Manuel Fangio]], [[Stirling Moss]], [[Jean Behra]] and [[Maurice Trintignant]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pike |first1=Tim |title=When Bordeaux city centre became a Formula 1 racing track |url=http://invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com/2014/07/when-bordeaux-city-centre-became.html |website=invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com |accessdate=6 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n[[File:Michel-eyquem-de-montaigne 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Michel de Montaigne]]]]\n{{Div col|colwidth=35em}}\n* [[Jean Alaux]] (1786\u20131864), painter\n*[[Bertrand Andrieu]] (1761\u20131822), engraver\n*[[Jean Anouilh]] (1910\u20131987), dramatist\n*[[Yvonne Arnaud]] (1892\u20131958), pianist, singer and actress\n*[[Ausonius|Decimus Magnus Ausonius]] (c. 310\u2013395), Roman poet and rhetorician\n*[[Floyd Ayit\u00e9]], (born 1988), Togolese footballer\n*[[Jonathan Ayit\u00e9]], (born 1985), Togolese footballer\n*[[Christine Barbe]], winemaker\n*[[G\u00e9rard Bayo]] (born 1936), writer and poet,\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Bigot]] (1703\u20131778), last \"Intendant\" of New France\n*[[Gr\u00e9gory Bourdy]], (born 1982), golfer\n*[[Samuel Boutal]], (born 1969), footballer\n*[[Edmond de Caillou]] (died c.
