Maul commands her to meet with him on [[Dathomir]] and tells her that they will work more closely from now on, igniting his lightsaber.\n\n===Animated series===\n==== ''The Clone Wars'' ====\nDarth Maul's origins are elaborated upon in the third season of the animated series ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'', which takes place between ''[[Attack of the Clones]]'' and ''[[Revenge of the Sith]]''.\nMaul is explained to have been a warrior of the Nightbrother clan on the planet [[Dathomir]] inhabited by the dominant Nightsister [[witchcraft]] society led by [[Mother Talzin]]. Maul's tattoos are described as the markings of a warrior.{{efn|Earlier sources identified his body art as Sith markings.}} Talzin instructs [[Savage Opress]] to find his long-lost brother.\n\nIn the fourth season, Maul is revealed to be alive, having survived his presumed death at Obi-Wan's hands. Having ended up on a junkyard planet via a dumpster craft, Maul has suffered from amnesia since Obi-Wan defeated him. Savage finds Maul and brings him to the devastated Dathomir, where Talzin restores Maul's mind and gives him robotic legs.

Needing followers, they travel to [[Florrum]] and manage to convince [[Weequay]] pirate Jiro and his crew to join them and betray their leader [[Hondo Ohnaka]]. Maul's pirates attack Hondo's loyal forces, and Maul once again duels Obi-Wan while Savage fights and kills Jedi Master [[Adi Gallia]]. Obi-Wan draws the two brothers away from the pirates, engaging them in a duel. Obi-Wan, though outnumbered, cuts off Savage's arm. While Maul and Savage are in the process of retreating, Hondo's crew open fire at them and shoot off one of Maul's robotic legs. Maul's ship is blasted by a missile as it attempts to take flight, but Maul and Savage manage to escape using one of the emergency pods. After several days, they are found floating in dead space and close to death by the [[Mandalorian]] Death Watch warriors, led by [[Pre Vizsla]]. They are taken back to Vizsla's settlement, and Maul's damaged cybernetic legs are replaced with a new prosthetic that resembles a more humanoid form, while Savage is fitted with a mechanical arm. Maul offers Vizsla the chance to reclaim [[Mandalore]] by recruiting Black Sun, the Pyke Syndicate, and [[Jabba the Hutt]]'s minions to create the criminal syndicate named the Shadow Collective.\n\nFrom there, Maul engineers Vizsla's rise to power: he orders his henchmen to attack Mandalore so the Death Watch can arrest them and appear as heroes to the denizens who have long lived under Duchess [[Satine Kryze]]'s [[pacifist]] rule. Vizsla betrays Maul, imprisoning him and Savage. Easily breaking free, Maul challenges Vizsla to a duel to take over Death Watch and Mandalore; he succeeds in killing Vizsla and claims his former co-conspirator's [[darksaber (fictional weapon)|darksaber]]. He wins the loyalty of most Death Watch members, but Bo Katan retreats along with those loyal to their previous leader. Maul then puts disgraced former prime minister Almec, whom Satine had imprisoned for corruption, in power as a puppet leader, solidifying his control over Mandalore. Maul anticipates Satine's contacting the Jedi Council as part of his plan to get Obi-Wan to Mandalore. Once Obi-Wan arrives, Maul captures him and murders Satine in front of him, hoping to make the Jedi suffer as much as he once did. Obi-Wan is later freed by Katan's Death Watch faction.\n\nMaul senses Darth Sidious arriving on Mandalore. Although impressed with his former apprentice's survival, Sidious declares Maul a rival and uses the Force to push and choke him and Savage. He then engages them both in lightsaber combat, fatally injuring Savage. After Savage dies from his wounds, Sidious reminds Maul of the [[Star Wars: Darth Bane: Rule of Two|Rule of Two]], and tells him that he has been replaced. Enraged, Maul pulls out both his lightsaber and darksaber and proceeds to fight Sidious on equal ground, but Sidious ultimately defeats him. Maul pleads for mercy, but Sidious ignores him and tortures him with blasts of Force lightning. Sidious reveals that he has no intention of killing Maul, remarking that he has other uses for his former apprentice.\n\nMaul will return in season 7 in which he duels [[Ahsoka Tano]] during the Siege of Mandalore. He will be portrayed by Ray Park using [[motion capture]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/how-ray-park-and-the-mandalorian-are-upping-the-action-1834038997/amp|title=How Ray Park and The Mandalorian Are Upping the Action in Star Wars: The Clone Wars|last=Lussier|first=Germain|date=April 15, 2019|work=io9|accessdate=April 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====''Rebels''====\nAn older Maul appears in the season 2 finale of ''[[Star Wars Rebels]],''<ref name=\"Rebels\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/03/24/darth-maul-returns-star-wars-rebels|title='Star Wars: Rebels' resurrects a familiar old foe|website=Ew.com|accessdate=10 November 2017}}</ref> which takes place between ''Revenge of the Sith'' and ''[[A New Hope]]''. Tracked by an [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Imperial]] Inquisitor named the Eighth Brother, Maul is stranded on the ancient Sith world of [[Malachor]], where he is discovered among the ruins by series protagonist [[Ezra Bridger]]. Introducing himself as \"Old Master\" and seeking revenge against Sidious, Maul leads Ezra into an ancient Sith temple, where they discover a holocron that Maul claims can give them the knowledge needed to defeat the Sith. After recovering it, the two find Ezra's master [[Kanan Jarrus]] and former Jedi [[Ahsoka Tano]] locked in battle with the Eighth Brother. They also find the Inquisitors known as the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister, who have been pursuing the rebels for some time. Maul\u2014having cast aside the title of Darth\u2014reveals a new lightsaber disguised as a walking stick and joins the Jedi in battling their enemies, including Darth Vader.\n\nAfter the Inquisitors retreat, Maul wins the Jedi's trust by denouncing the Sith, and tells them that he cannot defeat Vader on his own. Working together, he and the Jedi ascend towards the top of the temple and successfully kill all three Inquisitors. Then, Maul reveals his intention to take Ezra as his apprentice, having already tricked him into activating the temple. After blinding Kanan, Maul briefly duels Ahsoka before facing Kanan again, only to be knocked off the temple's edge. However, he survives the fall and escapes Malachor in the Eighth Brother's [[TIE fighter]].\n\nMonths later, Maul takes the ''[[Ghost (Star Wars)|Ghost]]''{{'}}s crew hostage and threatens to kill them unless Kanan and Ezra bring both the Sith and Jedi holocrons to him. Maul takes the crew to a remote base in the Outer Rim where he awaits Kanan and Ezra's arrival. Then, the holocrons are hazardously united allowing Ezra and Maul to see visions of their desires: Ezra sees images of a way to destroy the Sith, images including \"twin suns\", while Maul sees a vision of his own. Kanan begs Ezra to look away before he sees too much of the dark side, while Maul tells him to ignore Kanan and keep looking. Ezra heeds his master's words and breaks off the connection, which causes a great explosion. Maul escapes in the confusion, uttering, \"He lives.\"\n\nMaul reappears after finding the rebels' secret base. He tells Ezra that because the connection was severed, they got bits and pieces of each other's visions. After the holocrons were destroyed, Maul discovered another way to get the information he needed. He travels to Dathomir with Ezra, and recreates a Nightsister spell to temporarily meld his and Ezra's minds. After this is completed, Ezra and Maul realize that they are both looking for Obi-Wan Kenobi.\n\nIn the episode \"Twin Suns\", Maul is shown lost on Tatooine. He decides to use Ezra to lure Obi-Wan out of hiding. His plan is ultimately successful as he tracks Ezra through the desert and the latter is rescued by Obi-Wan. Maul then comes face to face with his nemesis who ushered Ezra away. During their confrontation, Maul deduces that Obi-Wan is not only hiding, but is protecting [[Luke Skywalker|someone]]. Obi-Wan realizes Maul has to die and ignites his lightsaber. In a swift duel, Obi-Wan fatally wounds Maul. As he lies dying in Obi-Wan's arms, Maul asks if the person he is protecting is the [[Chosen One (Star Wars)|Chosen One]], and Obi-Wan (implying Luke as Anakin has since become Vader) replies that he is. Maul declares that this \"Chosen One\" will avenge them and dies.\n\n===Comics===\n{{Expand section|date=June 2019}}\n\n====''Darth Maul''====\nIn 2017, [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] released ''Star Wars: Darth Maul'' a 5-issue prequel series centered on Darth Maul before the events of ''The Phantom Menace''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Juba |first=Joe |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2016/11/14/darth-maul-to-star-in-new-comic-book.aspx |title=Darth Maul To Star In New Star Wars Comic Book - News |publisher=www.GameInformer.com |date=2016-11-14 |accessdate=2016-12-19}}</ref>\n\n====''Darth Maul: Son of Dathomir''====\n[[Dark Horse Comics]] produced ''[[Darth Maul: Son of Dathomir]]'' based on the scripts and storyboards of an unproduced 4-episode story arc intended for ''The Clone Wars'' Season 7. After killing Savage Opress, Darth Sidious takes Maul to a Separatist prison, where [[Count Dooku]] tortures him for information about the Shadow Collective. Prime Minister Almec arranges Maul's escape and the latter then heads back to Zanbar to command the Death Watch army. However, he is followed by [[General Grievous]] and his droids, who battle with Maul and the Mandalorians. While they put up a fierce fight, Maul and his minions are ultimately overwhelmed by the droids. During the battle, Maul tears through the droid ranks and attacks Grievous, but is overpowered and forced to retreat. Afterwards, Maul confers with Mother Talzin (revealed to be his biological mother) and plots to draw out Sidious by capturing Dooku and Grievous. The scheme works, and Talzin is able to restore herself to her physical form, but she sacrifices herself to save Maul. Although Maul escapes with a company of loyal Mandalorians, the Shadow Collective has disintegrated due to the conflict with Sidious, as the Hutts, Pykes, and Black Sun have all abandoned Maul.\n\n===Novels===\n====''Ahsoka''====\nIn flashbacks during the novel ''[[Star Wars: Ahsoka]]'', it is revealed that during the final days of the Clone Wars, Maul and his forces were besieged on Mandalore by an army of clone troopers led by Ahsoka Tano and [[Captain Rex]].{{efn|Anakin and Obi-Wan were dispatched to Mandalore with Ahsoka, but were immediately called back to Coruscant to rescue Chancellor [[Palpatine]], thus leading into the opening sequence of ''Revenge of the Sith''.}} During the siege, Maul confronts and duels Ahsoka, and though he proves to be the stronger fighter, the former Jedi outwits him and traps him in a ray shield. However, before Maul can be taken into official custody, [[Order 66 (Star Wars)|Order 66]] is enacted and the clone troopers following Ahsoka turn on her, with the exception of Rex. With Rex's life in peril, Ahsoka abandons the chance of killing Maul, allowing the former Sith to escape once again.

The series is set in the shortly before the Battle of Naboo in ''Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace''.  The story follows Maul in his mission to destroy the leadership of the well-feared crime syndicate Black Sun. Maul spends his time serving under Darth Sidious, killing countlessly. His main target in the series is the leader of Black Sun, some time before [[Prince Xizor]] takes command of it.\n\nSeveral sources depict Maul returning from the dead in several different forms. The story \"Resurrection\" from [[Star Wars Tales 9|''Star Wars Tales'' #9]] depicts a cult creating a duplicate of Maul as a replacement for Darth Vader, only for Vader to kill him. The story ''Phantom Menaces'' in [[Star Wars Tales 17|''Star Wars Tales'' #17]] (set after ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'') depicts Luke Skywalker visiting Maul's home planet of [[Iridonia]] in an ambassadorial capacity, where he faces a \"solid state hologram\" of Maul projected from Maul's salvaged brain as part of a scientist's attempt to recreate Maul as Iridonia's \"champion\". Luke recognizes the disruption that Maul's existence is causing in the Force, and shuts down the life-support systems keeping the brain alive.\n\nIn 2005, Dark Horse Comics published ''[[Star Wars: Visionaries]]'', a compilation of non-canonical short comics made by the creators of ''Revenge of the Sith''. One story, \"Old Wounds\", depicts Maul with longer horns on his head, having survived his bisection at Obi-Wan's hands, with his missing bottom half replaced with [[cybernetic]] legs, similar to those of General Grievous (and his eventual revival in ''The Clone Wars''). He follows Obi-Wan throughout the galaxy, finally tracking him down on Tatooine a few years after the events of ''Revenge of the Sith''. Maul taunts Obi-Wan, saying that after he kills him, he will take a toddler-aged Luke Skywalker to his master, Emperor Palpatine. Maul plans to kill Vader and resume his rightful place at Palpatine's side. He ignites his new double-bladed lightsaber and engages Obi-Wan in a duel, but Obi-Wan again bests him in combat, cutting off his opponent's horns. Maul is killed by a blaster bolt to the head from [[Owen Lars]]. Obi-Wan thanks Owen, and says he will take Maul's body into the desert and burn it.\n\n====Novels====\nIn early 2012, a [[young adult fiction|young adult]] novel entitled ''Star Wars: The Wrath of Darth Maul'' was released by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]]. Maul is also featured prominently in comic series starting in this period, ''The Clone Wars: The Sith Hunters'' and ''Darth Maul: Death Sentence''. Set around the various episodes of ''The Clone Wars'' that featured Maul, the two books detail his and Savage Opress' journey across the galaxy as they seek vengeance on the Jedi.\n\nIn the 2012 novel ''[[Star Wars: Darth Plagueis|Darth Plagueis]]'', the titular Sith lord sends his apprentice, Darth Sidious, to the Force-rich world of Dathomir. A Dathomiri witch, or Nightsister, senses Sidious' power in the Force and approaches him. Assuming he is a Jedi, she begs him to take her [[Zabrak (Star Wars)|Zabrak]] infant son. She realizes that Sidious is not a Jedi, and explains how she is trying to save her son from a Nightsister named Talzin, who killed Maul's father. It is implied that Maul has a twin brother and that Talzin is only aware of one child. Sidious realizes the infant is strong in the Force, and would become a threat if found by the Jedi. Concealing the existence of his own master, Sidious raises Maul to believe that he is a Sith apprentice, but he actually intends him to be an expendable minion rather than an heir. Maul himself acknowledges his shortcomings, such as his limited understanding of politics, even as he tries to become a true Sith.\n\n=====''Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter''=====\n'''''Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter''''' is a novel by [[Michael Reaves]] released on February 1, 2001. It is a prequel novel occurring about six months before the events of ''The Phantom Menace''. The cover art was by David Stevenson. [[Del Rey Books|Del Rey]] aired a TV commercial for the novel in 1999.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} As portrayed in the novel, Maul was raised by Sidious for as long as he can remember. Sidious then trains Maul as a Sith, marking his body with Sith tattoos. Maul initially goes on several missions of [[terrorism|terror]] for his master, killing politicians, crime bosses, merchants and warlords.\n\nSidious meets secretly with his [[Neimoidian]] contacts in the Trade Federation to finalize details in the plan to blockade Naboo. One member of the delegation is missing; suspecting betrayal, Sidious orders Maul to hunt down the traitor. Maul completes this task, but learns that the traitor had recorded proof of the Sith's manipulation of the Naboo blockade on a holocron to sell for profit. A [[suicide terrorism|suicidal]] attack by a Trade Federation-hired [[bounty hunter]] interferes with Maul's plan and the holocron is purchased by a [[Corellia]]n con man named Lorn Pavan.\nPavan realizes the nature of the information and seeks to take it to the [[Jedi Temple]]. Maul, for his part, is ordered by Sidious to retrieve the holocron and kill Pavan and anyone else who might have the information.  Meanwhile, a Jedi Padawan named Darsha Assant is faced with the Jedi trials to become a full-fledged Jedi Knight, and tries to save a member of Black Sun (which Maul had crippled in ''Saboteur'').\n\nPavan attempts to do business with a Hutt crime lord in one of the lower levels in Coruscant, but Maul arrives and kills the Hutt. Pavan escapes into the caverns where they meet Darsha and her master. The Jedi begin escorting Pavan and his droid to the temple but Maul soon attacks them. Darsha's master is slain while attempting to buy time for the others. Pavan and Darsha escape various dangers of Coruscant's subterranean levels before finding themselves in another battle.  Darsha, realizing that she cannot defeat Maul, draws out their duel long enough for Pavan's droid to repair a carbonite-freezing unit and seal Pavan and the droid inside it.  Darsha plunges her lightsaber into a pile of volatile gas canisters, killing her and causing an explosion that Maul barely escapes.  Upon surveying the scene, Maul feels no trace of Pavan in the Force, not realizing that the [[Carbonite (Star Wars)|carbonite]] [[hibernation]] has made his lifeforce undetectable.\n\nAn automatic timer frees Pavan from hibernation and he goes after Maul on his own.

Maul's tattoos are described as the markings of a warrior.{{efn|Earlier sources identified his body art as Sith markings.}} Talzin instructs [[Savage Opress]] to find his long-lost brother.\n\nIn the fourth season, Maul is revealed to be alive, having survived his presumed death at Obi-Wan's hands. Having ended up on a junkyard planet via a dumpster craft, Maul has suffered from amnesia since Obi-Wan defeated him.

Needing followers, they travel to [[Florrum]] and manage to convince [[Weequay]] pirate Jiro and his crew to join them and betray their leader [[Hondo Ohnaka]]. Maul's pirates attack Hondo's loyal forces, and Maul once again duels Obi-Wan while Savage fights and kills Jedi Master [[Adi Gallia]]. Obi-Wan draws the two brothers away from the pirates, engaging them in a duel. Obi-Wan, though outnumbered, cuts off Savage's arm. While Maul and Savage are in the process of retreating, Hondo's crew open fire at them and shoot off one of Maul's robotic legs. Maul's ship is blasted by a missile as it attempts to take flight, but Maul and Savage manage to escape using one of the emergency pods. After several days, they are found floating in dead space and close to death by the [[Mandalorian]] Death Watch warriors, led by [[Pre Vizsla]]. They are taken back to Vizsla's settlement, and Maul's damaged cybernetic legs are replaced with a new prosthetic that resembles a more humanoid form, while Savage is fitted with a mechanical arm. Maul offers Vizsla the chance to reclaim [[Mandalore]] by recruiting Black Sun, the Pyke Syndicate, and [[Jabba the Hutt]]'s minions to create the criminal syndicate named the Shadow Collective.\n\nFrom there, Maul engineers Vizsla's rise to power: he orders his henchmen to attack Mandalore so the Death Watch can arrest them and appear as heroes to the denizens who have long lived under Duchess [[Satine Kryze]]'s [[pacifist]] rule. Vizsla betrays Maul, imprisoning him and Savage. Easily breaking free, Maul challenges Vizsla to a duel to take over Death Watch and Mandalore; he succeeds in killing Vizsla and claims his former co-conspirator's [[darksaber (fictional weapon)|darksaber]]. He wins the loyalty of most Death Watch members, but Bo Katan retreats along with those loyal to their previous leader. Maul then puts disgraced former prime minister Almec, whom Satine had imprisoned for corruption, in power as a puppet leader, solidifying his control over Mandalore. Maul anticipates Satine's contacting the Jedi Council as part of his plan to get Obi-Wan to Mandalore. Once Obi-Wan arrives, Maul captures him and murders Satine in front of him, hoping to make the Jedi suffer as much as he once did. Obi-Wan is later freed by Katan's Death Watch faction.\n\nMaul senses Darth Sidious arriving on Mandalore. Although impressed with his former apprentice's survival, Sidious declares Maul a rival and uses the Force to push and choke him and Savage. He then engages them both in lightsaber combat, fatally injuring Savage. After Savage dies from his wounds, Sidious reminds Maul of the [[Star Wars: Darth Bane: Rule of Two|Rule of Two]], and tells him that he has been replaced. Enraged, Maul pulls out both his lightsaber and darksaber and proceeds to fight Sidious on equal ground, but Sidious ultimately defeats him. Maul pleads for mercy, but Sidious ignores him and tortures him with blasts of Force lightning. Sidious reveals that he has no intention of killing Maul, remarking that he has other uses for his former apprentice.\n\nMaul will return in season 7 in which he duels [[Ahsoka Tano]] during the Siege of Mandalore.

Tracked by an [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Imperial]] Inquisitor named the Eighth Brother, Maul is stranded on the ancient Sith world of [[Malachor]], where he is discovered among the ruins by series protagonist [[Ezra Bridger]]. Introducing himself as \"Old Master\" and seeking revenge against Sidious, Maul leads Ezra into an ancient Sith temple, where they discover a holocron that Maul claims can give them the knowledge needed to defeat the Sith. After recovering it, the two find Ezra's master [[Kanan Jarrus]] and former Jedi [[Ahsoka Tano]] locked in battle with the Eighth Brother. They also find the Inquisitors known as the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister, who have been pursuing the rebels for some time. Maul\u2014having cast aside the title of Darth\u2014reveals a new lightsaber disguised as a walking stick and joins the Jedi in battling their enemies, including Darth Vader.\n\nAfter the Inquisitors retreat, Maul wins the Jedi's trust by denouncing the Sith, and tells them that he cannot defeat Vader on his own. Working together, he and the Jedi ascend towards the top of the temple and successfully kill all three Inquisitors. Then, Maul reveals his intention to take Ezra as his apprentice, having already tricked him into activating the temple. After blinding Kanan, Maul briefly duels Ahsoka before facing Kanan again, only to be knocked off the temple's edge. However, he survives the fall and escapes Malachor in the Eighth Brother's [[TIE fighter]].\n\nMonths later, Maul takes the ''[[Ghost (Star Wars)|Ghost]]''{{'}}s crew hostage and threatens to kill them unless Kanan and Ezra bring both the Sith and Jedi holocrons to him. Maul takes the crew to a remote base in the Outer Rim where he awaits Kanan and Ezra's arrival. Then, the holocrons are hazardously united allowing Ezra and Maul to see visions of their desires: Ezra sees images of a way to destroy the Sith, images including \"twin suns\", while Maul sees a vision of his own. Kanan begs Ezra to look away before he sees too much of the dark side, while Maul tells him to ignore Kanan and keep looking. Ezra heeds his master's words and breaks off the connection, which causes a great explosion. Maul escapes in the confusion, uttering, \"He lives.\"\n\nMaul reappears after finding the rebels' secret base. He tells Ezra that because the connection was severed, they got bits and pieces of each other's visions. After the holocrons were destroyed, Maul discovered another way to get the information he needed. He travels to Dathomir with Ezra, and recreates a Nightsister spell to temporarily meld his and Ezra's minds. After this is completed, Ezra and Maul realize that they are both looking for Obi-Wan Kenobi.\n\nIn the episode \"Twin Suns\", Maul is shown lost on Tatooine. He decides to use Ezra to lure Obi-Wan out of hiding. His plan is ultimately successful as he tracks Ezra through the desert and the latter is rescued by Obi-Wan. Maul then comes face to face with his nemesis who ushered Ezra away. During their confrontation, Maul deduces that Obi-Wan is not only hiding, but is protecting [[Luke Skywalker|someone]]. Obi-Wan realizes Maul has to die and ignites his lightsaber. In a swift duel, Obi-Wan fatally wounds Maul. As he lies dying in Obi-Wan's arms, Maul asks if the person he is protecting is the [[Chosen One (Star Wars)|Chosen One]], and Obi-Wan (implying Luke as Anakin has since become Vader) replies that he is. Maul declares that this \"Chosen One\" will avenge them and dies.\n\n===Comics===\n{{Expand section|date=June 2019}}\n\n====''Darth Maul''====\nIn 2017, [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] released ''Star Wars: Darth Maul'' a 5-issue prequel series centered on Darth Maul before the events of ''The Phantom Menace''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Juba |first=Joe |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2016/11/14/darth-maul-to-star-in-new-comic-book.aspx |title=Darth Maul To Star In New Star Wars Comic Book - News |publisher=www.GameInformer.com |date=2016-11-14 |accessdate=2016-12-19}}</ref>\n\n====''Darth Maul: Son of Dathomir''====\n[[Dark Horse Comics]] produced ''[[Darth Maul: Son of Dathomir]]'' based on the scripts and storyboards of an unproduced 4-episode story arc intended for ''The Clone Wars'' Season 7. After killing Savage Opress, Darth Sidious takes Maul to a Separatist prison, where [[Count Dooku]] tortures him for information about the Shadow Collective. Prime Minister Almec arranges Maul's escape and the latter then heads back to Zanbar to command the Death Watch army. However, he is followed by [[General Grievous]] and his droids, who battle with Maul and the Mandalorians. While they put up a fierce fight, Maul and his minions are ultimately overwhelmed by the droids. During the battle, Maul tears through the droid ranks and attacks Grievous, but is overpowered and forced to retreat. Afterwards, Maul confers with Mother Talzin (revealed to be his biological mother) and plots to draw out Sidious by capturing Dooku and Grievous. The scheme works, and Talzin is able to restore herself to her physical form, but she sacrifices herself to save Maul. Although Maul escapes with a company of loyal Mandalorians, the Shadow Collective has disintegrated due to the conflict with Sidious, as the Hutts, Pykes, and Black Sun have all abandoned Maul.\n\n===Novels===\n====''Ahsoka''====\nIn flashbacks during the novel ''[[Star Wars: Ahsoka]]'', it is revealed that during the final days of the Clone Wars, Maul and his forces were besieged on Mandalore by an army of clone troopers led by Ahsoka Tano and [[Captain Rex]].{{efn|Anakin and Obi-Wan were dispatched to Mandalore with Ahsoka, but were immediately called back to Coruscant to rescue Chancellor [[Palpatine]], thus leading into the opening sequence of ''Revenge of the Sith''.}} During the siege, Maul confronts and duels Ahsoka, and though he proves to be the stronger fighter, the former Jedi outwits him and traps him in a ray shield. However, before Maul can be taken into official custody, [[Order 66 (Star Wars)|Order 66]] is enacted and the clone troopers following Ahsoka turn on her, with the exception of Rex. With Rex's life in peril, Ahsoka abandons the chance of killing Maul, allowing the former Sith to escape once again.

The series is set in the shortly before the Battle of Naboo in ''Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace''.  The story follows Maul in his mission to destroy the leadership of the well-feared crime syndicate Black Sun. Maul spends his time serving under Darth Sidious, killing countlessly. His main target in the series is the leader of Black Sun, some time before [[Prince Xizor]] takes command of it.\n\nSeveral sources depict Maul returning from the dead in several different forms. The story \"Resurrection\" from [[Star Wars Tales 9|''Star Wars Tales'' #9]] depicts a cult creating a duplicate of Maul as a replacement for Darth Vader, only for Vader to kill him. The story ''Phantom Menaces'' in [[Star Wars Tales 17|''Star Wars Tales'' #17]] (set after ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'') depicts Luke Skywalker visiting Maul's home planet of [[Iridonia]] in an ambassadorial capacity, where he faces a \"solid state hologram\" of Maul projected from Maul's salvaged brain as part of a scientist's attempt to recreate Maul as Iridonia's \"champion\". Luke recognizes the disruption that Maul's existence is causing in the Force, and shuts down the life-support systems keeping the brain alive.\n\nIn 2005, Dark Horse Comics published ''[[Star Wars: Visionaries]]'', a compilation of non-canonical short comics made by the creators of ''Revenge of the Sith''. One story, \"Old Wounds\", depicts Maul with longer horns on his head, having survived his bisection at Obi-Wan's hands, with his missing bottom half replaced with [[cybernetic]] legs, similar to those of General Grievous (and his eventual revival in ''The Clone Wars''). He follows Obi-Wan throughout the galaxy, finally tracking him down on Tatooine a few years after the events of ''Revenge of the Sith''. Maul taunts Obi-Wan, saying that after he kills him, he will take a toddler-aged Luke Skywalker to his master, Emperor Palpatine. Maul plans to kill Vader and resume his rightful place at Palpatine's side. He ignites his new double-bladed lightsaber and engages Obi-Wan in a duel, but Obi-Wan again bests him in combat, cutting off his opponent's horns. Maul is killed by a blaster bolt to the head from [[Owen Lars]]. Obi-Wan thanks Owen, and says he will take Maul's body into the desert and burn it.\n\n====Novels====\nIn early 2012, a [[young adult fiction|young adult]] novel entitled ''Star Wars: The Wrath of Darth Maul'' was released by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]]. Maul is also featured prominently in comic series starting in this period, ''The Clone Wars: The Sith Hunters'' and ''Darth Maul: Death Sentence''. Set around the various episodes of ''The Clone Wars'' that featured Maul, the two books detail his and Savage Opress' journey across the galaxy as they seek vengeance on the Jedi.\n\nIn the 2012 novel ''[[Star Wars: Darth Plagueis|Darth Plagueis]]'', the titular Sith lord sends his apprentice, Darth Sidious, to the Force-rich world of Dathomir. A Dathomiri witch, or Nightsister, senses Sidious' power in the Force and approaches him. Assuming he is a Jedi, she begs him to take her [[Zabrak (Star Wars)|Zabrak]] infant son. She realizes that Sidious is not a Jedi, and explains how she is trying to save her son from a Nightsister named Talzin, who killed Maul's father. It is implied that Maul has a twin brother and that Talzin is only aware of one child. Sidious realizes the infant is strong in the Force, and would become a threat if found by the Jedi. Concealing the existence of his own master, Sidious raises Maul to believe that he is a Sith apprentice, but he actually intends him to be an expendable minion rather than an heir. Maul himself acknowledges his shortcomings, such as his limited understanding of politics, even as he tries to become a true Sith.\n\n=====''Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter''=====\n'''''Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter''''' is a novel by [[Michael Reaves]] released on February 1, 2001. It is a prequel novel occurring about six months before the events of ''The Phantom Menace''. The cover art was by David Stevenson. [[Del Rey Books|Del Rey]] aired a TV commercial for the novel in 1999.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} As portrayed in the novel, Maul was raised by Sidious for as long as he can remember. Sidious then trains Maul as a Sith, marking his body with Sith tattoos. Maul initially goes on several missions of [[terrorism|terror]] for his master, killing politicians, crime bosses, merchants and warlords.\n\nSidious meets secretly with his [[Neimoidian]] contacts in the Trade Federation to finalize details in the plan to blockade Naboo. One member of the delegation is missing; suspecting betrayal, Sidious orders Maul to hunt down the traitor. Maul completes this task, but learns that the traitor had recorded proof of the Sith's manipulation of the Naboo blockade on a holocron to sell for profit. A [[suicide terrorism|suicidal]] attack by a Trade Federation-hired [[bounty hunter]] interferes with Maul's plan and the holocron is purchased by a [[Corellia]]n con man named Lorn Pavan.\nPavan realizes the nature of the information and seeks to take it to the [[Jedi Temple]]. Maul, for his part, is ordered by Sidious to retrieve the holocron and kill Pavan and anyone else who might have the information.  Meanwhile, a Jedi Padawan named Darsha Assant is faced with the Jedi trials to become a full-fledged Jedi Knight, and tries to save a member of Black Sun (which Maul had crippled in ''Saboteur'').\n\nPavan attempts to do business with a Hutt crime lord in one of the lower levels in Coruscant, but Maul arrives and kills the Hutt. Pavan escapes into the caverns where they meet Darsha and her master. The Jedi begin escorting Pavan and his droid to the temple but Maul soon attacks them. Darsha's master is slain while attempting to buy time for the others. Pavan and Darsha escape various dangers of Coruscant's subterranean levels before finding themselves in another battle.  Darsha, realizing that she cannot defeat Maul, draws out their duel long enough for Pavan's droid to repair a carbonite-freezing unit and seal Pavan and the droid inside it.  Darsha plunges her lightsaber into a pile of volatile gas canisters, killing her and causing an explosion that Maul barely escapes.  Upon surveying the scene, Maul feels no trace of Pavan in the Force, not realizing that the [[Carbonite (Star Wars)|carbonite]] [[hibernation]] has made his lifeforce undetectable.\n\nAn automatic timer frees Pavan from hibernation and he goes after Maul on his own.  Pavan follows Maul to a Republic space station and sneaks up on Maul, stunning him momentarily before he awakens, severes Pavan's right hand, and pursues him through the station's service tubes.\nPavan barely makes it into a public area where Maul cannot follow, and unwittingly gives the holocron to Senator Palpatine of Naboo, not realizing that Palpatine is Maul's Sith Master. After recovering, Pavan starts to leave his quarters, only to be confronted by Maul, who kills him as a worthy opponent.\n\n=====''Darth Maul: Saboteur''=====\n'''''Darth Maul: Saboteur''''' is a short story by [[James Luceno]]. It was released in [[ebook]] form, with a length equivalent to about 55 printed pages, on February 1, 2001.\nIt was also published in the back of the paperback edition of Michael Reaves' ''Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter''.\n\nThe story is about Darth Maul and takes place roughly a year before ''The Phantom Menace''. It recounts Maul's first solo mission and attempt to destroy two mining companies so the Trade Federation can take them over.\n\n=====''Maul: Lockdown''=====\n'''''Maul: Lockdown''''' is a ''Star Wars'' novel written by [[Joe Schreiber]], released by Del Rey Books on January 28, 2014.<ref>{{cite web |last=Anders |first=Charlie Jane |title=The guy who put zombies in the ''Star Wars'' universe is sending Darth Maul behind bars |url=http://io9.com/5978549/the-guy-who-put-zombies-in-the-star-wars-universe-is-sending-darth-maul-behind-bars |publisher=[[io9]] |date=January 24, 2013 |accessdate=July 15, 2016}}</ref> It was the last novel to be released in the ''Star Wars Legends'' line of the franchise.<ref name=\"SW Legends\"/><ref name=\"THR Legends\">{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lucasfilm-unveils-new-plans-star-698973|last=McMilian|first=Graeme|title=Lucasfilm Unveils New Plans for ''Star Wars Expanded Universe''|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=April 25, 2014|accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"SW Adult\"/> Before the events of ''The Phantom Menace'', Sith lords [[Darth Plagueis]] and Darth Sidious send their disciple Darth Maul to a galactic prison to recover a powerful weapon.

Whilst the movie received a mixed reaction from fans and critics alike, the character was one of the most highly praised parts of the film.

The [[Graded stakes race|Grade II]] [[grass|turf]] race is open to horses aged three and older and is raced over a distance of one mile (8 furlongs). Run in late June or early July, it currently offers a purse of [[CAD$]]200,000.<ref>{{cite web|title=King Edward Stakes|url=http://www.equibase.com/profiles/Results.cfm?type=Stakes&stkid=61|website=www.equibase.com|accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nNamed for [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom]] who had been crowned king in 1901, the race was created the following year with its first running taking place in 1903 as the King Edward Gold Cup. It was raced on dirt at the [[Greenwood Raceway|Old Woodbine Park]] until 1958 when it was moved to Woodbine Racetrack and changed to a turf race. Renamed the King Edward Breeders' Handicap, in 2007 it became a Stakes event.\n\nSince inception, the King Edward Stakes has been raced at a variety of distances:\n\n* {{frac|1|1|4}} miles : 1903-1917 ([[Old Woodbine Racetrack]])\n* {{frac|1|1|16}} miles : 1920-1957 on dirt at Old Woodbine Park,   1958-1993 on turf at [[Woodbine Racetrack]], and on turf in 1994 at [[Fort Erie Race Track]]\n* {{frac|1|1|8}} miles : 1995-2009 on turf at Woodbine Racetrack\n* 1 mile : beginning 2010\n\nDue to the large number of entries, the King Edward was raced in two divisions in 1978, 1984, 1985, 1987, and 1988. There was no race held in 1918, 1919, 1943, 1945, and 1956.\n\n==Records==\n'''Speed record:''' (at current distance of 1 mile)\n* 1:32.45 - [[Tower of Texas]] (2015)\n'''Speed  record:''' (at distance of {{frac|1|1|8}} miles)\n* 1:44.73 - [[Rahy's Attorney]] (2009) (new stakes and course record)\n\n'''Most wins:'''\n* 3 - [[Inferno (horse)|Inferno]] (1906, 1907, 1908)\n\n'''Most wins by an owner:'''\n* 9 - [[Sam-Son Farm]] (1974, 1987, 1988, 1991, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2005, 2010)\n\n'''Most wins by a [[jockey]]:'''\n* 4 - [[Robin Platts]] (1968, 1977, 1978, 1979)\n* 4 - [[Dave Penna]] (1986, 1987, 1989, 1990)\n\n'''Most wins by a [[Horse trainer|trainer]]:'''\n* 7 - [[Lou Cavalaris, Jr.]] (1959, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1976, 1978)\n\n==Winners of the King Edward Stakes==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|- \n! width=\"30px\" | Year<br>\n! width=\"135px\" | Winner<br>\n! width=\"20px\" | Age<br>\n! width=\"140px\" | Jockey<br>\n! width=\"130px\" | Trainer<br>\n! width=\"240px\" | Owner<br>\n! width=\"25px\" | Time<br>\n|-\n|2019\n|Synchrony\n|6\n|[[Javier Castellano]]\n|Michael Stidham\n|[[Pin Oak Stable]]\n|1:32.95\n|-\n|2018\n|Delta Prince\n|5\n|[[Javier Castellano]]\n|[[James Jerkens]]\n|[[Stronach Stables]]\n|1:32.35\n|-\n|2017\n|Go Bro\n|6\n|[[Jesse M.

The [[Graded stakes race|Grade II]] [[grass|turf]] race is open to horses aged three and older and is raced over a distance of one mile (8 furlongs). Run in late June or early July, it currently offers a purse of [[CAD$]]200,000.<ref>{{cite web|title=King Edward Stakes|url=http://www.equibase.com/profiles/Results.cfm?type=Stakes&stkid=61|website=www.equibase.com|accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nNamed for [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom]] who had been crowned king in 1901, the race was created the following year with its first running taking place in 1903 as the King Edward Gold Cup. It was raced on dirt at the [[Greenwood Raceway|Old Woodbine Park]] until 1958 when it was moved to Woodbine Racetrack and changed to a turf race. Renamed the King Edward Breeders' Handicap, in 2007 it became a Stakes event.\n\nSince inception, the King Edward Stakes has been raced at a variety of distances:\n\n* {{frac|1|1|4}} miles : 1903-1917 ([[Old Woodbine Racetrack]])\n* {{frac|1|1|16}} miles : 1920-1957 on dirt at Old Woodbine Park,   1958-1993 on turf at [[Woodbine Racetrack]], and on turf in 1994 at [[Fort Erie Racetrack]]\n* {{frac|1|1|8}} miles : 1995-2009 on turf at Woodbine Racetrack\n* 1 mile : beginning 2010\n\nDue to the large number of entries, the King Edward was raced in two divisions in 1978, 1984, 1985, 1987, and 1988. There was no race held in 1918, 1919, 1943, 1945, and 1956.\n\n==Records==\n'''Speed record:''' (at current distance of 1 mile)\n* 1:32.45 - [[Tower of Texas]] (2015)\n'''Speed  record:''' (at distance of {{frac|1|1|8}} miles)\n* 1:44.73 - [[Rahy's Attorney]] (2009) (new stakes and course record)\n\n'''Most wins:'''\n* 3 - [[Inferno (horse)|Inferno]] (1906, 1907, 1908)\n\n'''Most wins by an owner:'''\n* 9 - [[Sam-Son Farm]] (1974, 1987, 1988, 1991, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2005, 2010)\n\n'''Most wins by a [[jockey]]:'''\n* 4 - [[Robin Platts]] (1968, 1977, 1978, 1979)\n* 4 - [[Dave Penna]] (1986, 1987, 1989, 1990)\n\n'''Most wins by a [[Horse trainer|trainer]]:'''\n* 7 - [[Lou Cavalaris, Jr.]] (1959, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1976, 1978)\n\n==Winners of the King Edward Stakes==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|- \n! width=\"30px\" | Year<br>\n! width=\"135px\" | Winner<br>\n! width=\"20px\" | Age<br>\n! width=\"140px\" | Jockey<br>\n! width=\"130px\" | Trainer<br>\n! width=\"240px\" | Owner<br>\n! width=\"25px\" | Time<br>\n|-\n|2019\n|Synchrony\n|6\n|[[Javier Castellano]]\n|Michael Stidham\n|[[Pin Oak Stable]]\n|1:32.95\n|-\n|2018\n|Delta Prince\n|5\n|[[Javier Castellano]]\n|[[James Jerkens]]\n|[[Stronach Stables]]\n|1:32.35\n|-\n|2017\n|Go Bro\n|6\n|[[Jesse M.

Initially established as two MTV channels (MTV Asia and MTV Mandarin), MTV Networks businesses have crossed the continent and every delivery platform by catering to audiences with localized programming in eight different languages across ten MTV channels, eight Nickelodeon channels, four VH1 channels and numerous branded programming blocks across the Asia-Pacific region. The company's localization initiatives were pioneering and its rapid growth in Asia significantly contributed to MTV becoming the world's largest television network.\n\nMTV Networks Asia Pacific comprises 17 websites and 21 channels which are seen via 24-hour and programming blocks in various parts of Asia. Unlike the European and Latin American divisions, which are regulated by the headquarters' country main regulating body, the MTV Networks Asia channels are regulated by the individual country's regulation body.\n\n===ViacomCBS Networks UK & Australia===\n{{Main|ViacomCBS Networks UK & Australia}}\n'''ViacomCBS Networks International UK, Northern and Eastern Europe'''<ref>https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2019/11/28/viacom-international-media-networks-names-frow-as-uk-director-of-programmes/</ref> is a regional division of ViacomCBS Networks International.

In 2008, VIMN Africa decided to launch a 24-hour channel across Africa.\n\n* Since MTV's launch in Europe in the late 1980s, [[MTV Europe]] was made available in some territories across Africa primarily South Africa throughout the 1990s. Gradually, as MTV began to localize its brand in Europe, [[MTV France]] and [[MTV Portugal]] were added to the boutique of channels available across the African continent on major cable and digital television platforms.\n* In 2004, MTV Networks International announced it had plans to launch its 100th channel, in Africa with the launch of MTV Africa (proposed branding).

This branding makes the use of a standardised logo, idents and promos (except MTV US, MTV Canada and MTV Brazil). This is part of MTV Networks International's global branding initiative. The on-air branding titled '''Pop X1000''' reflects the changing nature of popular culture with MTV at the heart of these rapid changes. The branding was designed by MTV's design department '''World Design Studio''' in [[Milan]], with additional designs being added by other global departments throughout the year. The branding has been overseen by [[Universal Everything]]. This branding has been adopted by MTV Networks Europe, MTV Networks Asia, MTV Networks Africa and MTV Networks Latin America.

He studied painting and drawing with Jo Weiss, Lee Newman, [[Jack Boul]], and David Holt at the Washington Studio School, [[Washington, D.C.]], from 1987 to 1988, and attended graduate school in fine arts at [[Parsons School of Design]], [[New York City]].<ref>http://www.mitchelljohnson.com/</ref>\n \nDuring graduate school,  Johnson supported himself doing odd jobs for various New York artists, most notably [[Frank Stella]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Sandy Skoglund]] and Stella's assistant, Earl Childress.  In the fall of 1990, while waiting to hear if he would be able to join LeWitt's Wall Drawing Team, Johnson was offered a studio assistant job with [[Sam Francis]] and this is what landed him in Palo Alto.  He has since divided his time between California and Europe.\n\nIn 2007 he was an artist-in-residence at the [[Josef Albers|Josef]] and [[Anni Albers]] Foundation in [[Bethany, Connecticut]].  Johnson is a 2015 Visiting Artist at the American Academy in Rome and the subject of a short documentary film, The Artist of Silicon Valley, by Meg Smaker. His paintings can be found in over 700 private collections and the permanent collections of 28 museums.  The most recent museum acquisitions were the [[Museo Morandi]] in [[Bologna]], [[Galleria D'Arte Moderna]] in Rome and the [[Tucson Museum of Art]].

Born in 1964, in [[Rock Hill, South Carolina]],and raised in New York and Virginia, he currently paints in [[Palo Alto, California]] as well as in [[Truro, Massachusetts]]; [[Buonconvento]], [[Italy]]; [[Meyreuil]], [[France]] and [[Bornholm]], Denmark.  Johnson earned his M.F.A. at [[Parsons School of Design]] in 1990,<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Pasquali\n | first = Marilena\n | title = Mitchell Johnson Doppio Binario\n | year = 2007\n | url = \n | type = Hardcover\n | publisher = Musei Senesi\n | location = \n | language = English, Italian\n | isbn = 978-0-9754021-6-0 }}</ref> where he studied with [[Larry Rivers]], [[Paul Resika]], [[Leland Bell]], [[Robert De Niro, Sr.]], [[Nell Blaine]] and [[John Heliker]]&mdash;all former students of [[Hans Hofmann]].\n\n==Education==\nJohnson studied drawing and painting in high school at [[Staten Island Academy]] and at [[Randolph-Macon College]], where he studied with Ray Berry and earned a bachelor of science degree in computer science with minors in math and fine art.  He studied painting and drawing with Jo Weiss, Lee Newman, [[Jack Boul]], and David Holt at the Washington Studio School, [[Washington, D.C.]], from 1987 to 1988, and attended graduate school in fine arts at [[Parsons School of Design]], [[New York City]].<ref>http://www.mitchelljohnson.com/</ref>\n \nDuring graduate school,  Johnson supported himself doing odd jobs for various New York artists, most notably [[Frank Stella]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Sandy Skoglund]] and Stella's assistant, Earl Childress.  In the fall of 1990, while waiting to hear if he would be able to join LeWitt's Wall Drawing Team, Johnson was offered a studio assistant job with [[Sam Francis]] and this is what landed him in Palo Alto.  He has since divided his time between California and Europe.\n\nIn 2007 he was an artist-in-residence at the [[Josef Albers|Josef]] and [[Anni Albers]] Foundation in [[Bethany, Connecticut]].  Johnson is a 2015 Visiting Artist at the American Academy in Rome and the subject of a short documentary film, The Artist of Silicon Valley, by Meg Smaker. His paintings can be found in over 700 private collections and the permanent collections of 28 museums.  The most recent museum acquisitions were the Museo Morandi in Bologna, Galleria D'Arte Moderna in Rome and the Tucson Museum of Art. Johnson's paintings have appeared regularly in the New York Times Magazine since 2012. His work has been the subject of solo-exhibitions in Milan, New York, Santa Fe, San Francisco, Los Angeles, St. Helena, Oakland, Portland, and Scottsdale. Johnson's paintings have also appeared in many feature films and television shows including ''[[The Holiday]]'' (2006), ''[[It's Complicated (film)|It's Complicated]]'' (2009), ''[[The Lodger (2009 film)|The Lodger]]'' (2009), ''[[Crazy, Stupid, Love]]'' (2011), and ''[[The Mindy Project]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://nobhillgazette.com/go-west-young-man/ Nob Hill Gazette Article by Julissa James (2019)]\n*[http://inmenlo.com/2019/01/29/artist-mitchell-johnsons-paintings-on-display-in-downtown-menlo-park/ In Menlo Article (2019)]\n*[http://www.almanacnews.com/news/2019/01/30/seeing-better Almanac Cover Story (2019)]\n*[http://www.sfarts.org/event.cfm?Event_Num=83445 555 California Street exhibit (2019)]\n*[http://seattleartistleague.com/2019/10/11/mitchell-johnson/ Seattle Artist League (2019)]\n*[http://nobhillgazette.com/a-creative-union/ Nob Hill Gazette Article  (2018)]\n*[http://punchmagazine.com/mitchell-johnson-creative-colorist/ Punch Magazine Article  (2018)]\n*[http://paintingsinmovies.com/m/view/id/62 Paintings in Movies ]\n*[http://patch.com/california/paloalto/new-palo-alto-art-center-exhibition-explores-power-color/ Palo Alto Art Center color exhibit (2016)]\n*[http://www.vimeo.com/119744764 The Artist of Silicon Valley Mitchell Johnson Documentary Film by Meg Smaker (2015)]\n*[http://savvypainter.com/?s=mitchell+johnson Savvy Painter Interview (Oct 2014)]\n*[http://ogunquitmuseum.org/recent-acquisitions-mitchell-johnson/ Ogunquit Art Museum (2014)]\n*[http://www.bmoa.org/collection-paintings Bakersfield Art Museum (2014)]\n*[http://www.kemperart.org/collection/rossiniere-kirchheim Kemper Museum (2013)]\n*[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-seed/mitchell-johnson_b_1456753.html Huffington Post article (Apr 2012)]\n*[http://www.painters-table.com/link/john-seed-huffington-post/mitchell-johnson-interview Painters Table Interview (2012)]\n*[http://inmenlo.com/2013/02/11/mitchell-johnson-paintings-1990-2013-exhibited-in-two-locations/ In Menlo article (Feb 2013)]\n*[http://issuu.com/acamag/docs/aca201203 American Contemporary Art article (March 2012)]\n*[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-seed/bakersfield-museum-of-art-san-francisco_b_1372810.html Huffington Post article (March 2012)]\n*[http://www.ahtcast.com/2011/06/artist-interview-mitchell-johnson.html Ahtcast Interview (2011)]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJZh8yX2_dc Chris Busa interviews Mitchell Johnson WOMR Provincetown Radio (Aug 2011)]\n*[http://inmenlo.com/2010/11/09/mitchell-johnson-making-sense-of-the-world-through-painting/ InMenlo article (Nov 2010)]\n*[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/mitchell-johnson-interviews-15755 Smithsonian Archives American Art (Sept 2008)]\n*[http://www.almanacnews.com/news/2008/10/30/menlo-park-artists-exhibit/ Menlo Park Almanac (2008)]\n*[http://art-santamonica.blogspot.com/2008/03/terrence-rogers-fine-art-mitchell.html Santa Monica exhibit (2008)]\n*[http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2005/08/25/stanford-exhibit-shows-range-of-approaches/ East Bay Times (2005)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050829162028/http://www.teleculture.com/2005/01/seeing-reality-or-seeing-real.html Teleculture article (2005)]\n*[http://www.mitchelljohnson.com/ Mitchell Johnson website: paintings, exhibits, biography]\n*[http://www.trogart.com Mitchell Johnson at Terrence Rogers Fine Art]\n*[http://www.paloaltoonline.com/weekly/story.php?story_id=5312 Palo Alto Online (May 2007)]\n*[http://www.mercurynews.com/losgatos/ci_11333324/ Los Gatos Art Museum review (2008)]\n*[http://artscenecal.com/Announcements/0906/TRogers0906.html Terrence Rogers Fine Art (2006)]\n*[http://artdaily.cc/news/3706/New-Works-by-California-Artists--Mitchell-Johnson#.XdBKVWRKiu4 Triton Museum (2003)]\n*[http://www.mutualart.com/Article/An-artist-for-all-seasons/66B08748F816D67A Southwest Art article (2003)]\n\n==Books==\n*[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0982987455 ''Mitchell Johnson: Color as Content'' (2014)] by Alexander Nemerov, Peter Selz, Peter Campion, John Seed, \nJennifer Samet, John Goodrich\n*[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0982987447 ''Mitchell Johnson: Color from Tokyo, Truro, Seoul'' (2014)] by Jennifer Samet & Mitchell Johnson\n*[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0975402102 '' Mitchell Johnson: Paintings'' (1997)] by Donia Bijan and Annette Samec-Luciani\n*[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0975402110 '' Mitchell Johnson: Paesaggio e non Paesaggio '' (1999)] by Martina Corgnati, W.S.
