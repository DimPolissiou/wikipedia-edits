The evolution of this locomotive type began as a [[2-10-2|{{nowrap|2-10-2}} Santa Fe]] type with a larger four-wheeled trailing truck that would allow an enlarged [[Firebox (steam engine)|firebox]]. A subsequent development was as an elongated [[2-8-4|{{nowrap|2-8-4}} Berkshire]] type that required extra driving wheels to remain within [[axle load]] limits. Examples of both of these evolutionary progressions can be found.<ref name=Barris />\n\nSome {{nowrap|2-10-4}} [[tank locomotive]]s also existed in eastern Europe. One extraordinary experimental {{nowrap|2-10-4}} tender locomotive, built in the [[Soviet Union]], had an [[Soviet opposed-piston 2-10-4|opposed piston drive system]].<ref name=Russia>[http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/LOCOLOCO/russ/russrefr.htm Russian Reforms] (Accessed on 3 October 2016)</ref>\n\n==Usage==\n\n===Belgian Congo===\n[[File:CF du Bas-Congo 2-10-4 801.jpg|thumb|No. 801 dumped at Lubumbashi]]\nThe Texas type was rare in Africa. One locomotive, numbered 801, was built for the ''CF du Bas-Congo au Katanga'' by [[John Cockerill (company)|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme John Cockerill]] in 1939. It had {{convert|540|by|550|mm|abbr=off}} cylinders and {{convert|1100|mm|in|0|abbr=off}} diameter driving wheels, with a working order mass of {{convert|107.8|t|abbr=off}}, a grate area of {{convert|5.4|m2|abbr=off}} and a tractive effort at 65% boiler pressure of {{convert|14690|kgf|abbr=off}}. The locomotive is believed to have been built for the line between [[Bukama]] and [[Kamina]] and accumulated {{convert|1200000|km|mi|abbr=off}} during its service lifetime. Even with its large size, it was hand-fired and had two firebox doors, with two firemen being carried.<ref>Blanchart, De Deurwaerder, N\u00e8ve, Robeyns & Van Bost (1999).

In South America, the Central Railway of Brazil ordered seventeen {{Track gauge|metre|allk=on}} {{nowrap|2-10-4}} locomotives, ten from [[Baldwin Locomotive Works|Baldwin]] which were delivered in 1940, and another seven from the [[American Locomotive Company]] which were delivered in 1947.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Canada===\nThe Canadian Pacific (CP) [[Selkirk locomotive]]s were all built by [[Montreal Locomotive Works]] (MLW). The first twenty of these large engines were built in 1929, designated T1a class and allocated numbers 5900 to 5919. Their Canadian type name was after the [[Selkirk Mountains]] across which they were placed in service, the railway summit of which was located just inside the western portal of the [[Connaught Tunnel]] beneath [[Rogers Pass (British Columbia)|Rogers Pass]].<ref name=Atkins>{{cite book| first=C.P., B.Sc.| last=Atkins| title=Loco Profile 35: Canadian Pacific Selkirks| publisher=Profile Publications Ltd.| location=Windsor, England| year=1973}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Canadian Pacific Selkirk class 5927 takes on oil at the South Edmonton shops.jpg|thumb|Canadian Pacific T1b, 1957]]\nMLW built another ten of these successful locomotives for CP during November and December 1938, designated T1b class and numbered from 5920 to 5929. Modifications to the original design led to the T1b being ten tonnes lighter while its operating steam pressure was increased from {{convert|275|to|285|psi|abbr=off}}.<ref name=Atkins/>\n\nA further six Selkirks, classed T1c and numbered from 5930 to 5935, were delivered by MLW in 1949. They were the last [[standard gauge]] steam locomotives to be built in Canada for a Canadian railway. These were very similar to the T1b class, apart from a few refinements which included two cross-compound air compressors to speed up recharging of the air brake system, while some small streamlining touches were not retained, such as the streamlined casing around the smokebox stack as well as the teardrop shape of the classification lights. In addition, the inside of the cabs were no longer insulated in the same manner as the previous versions, which had provided better cold-weather cab insulation and were better-liked by crews. The last Selkirks were taken out of service in 1959. These were the most powerful steam locomotives in the British Empire. <ref name=Atkins/>\n\n===South Africa===\n[[File:Class 21 no. 2551 (2-10-4) a.jpg|thumb|left|[[South African Class 21 2-10-4|SAR Class 21]], c. 1937]]\nIn 1937, the South African Railways (SAR) placed one {{Track gauge|Cape|allk=on}} [[South African Class 21 2-10-4|Class 21]] steam locomotive with a Texas wheel arrangement in service, designed as a mixed traffic locomotive suitable for light rail. It was designed by A.G. Watson, Chief Mechanical Engineer of the SAR from 1929 to 1936, and built by the [[North British Locomotive Company]] in Glasgow. Only the one locomotive was built, at the time representing the maximum power obtainable on Cape gauge from a ten-coupled non-articulated locomotive that was limited to a {{convert|15|LT|t|1|abbr=off}} axle load on {{convert|60|lb/yd|kg/m|abbr=off}} rail. To enable it to negotiate tight curves, the third and fourth sets of coupled wheels were [[flangeless driver|flangeless]].<ref name=\"Holland 2\">{{Holland-Vol 2|pages=73-76}}</ref><ref name=\"NBL\">North British Locomotive Company works list, compiled by Austrian locomotive historian Bernhard Schmeiser</ref><ref name=\"diagram-book\">South African Railways and Harbours Locomotive Diagram Book, 2\u20190\" & 3\u20196\" Gauge Steam Locomotives, 15 August 1941, as amended</ref><ref name=\"Paxton-Bourne\">{{Paxton-Bourne|pages=10-11, 74-75}}</ref>\n\nThe locomotive\u2019s [[South African type FT tender|Type FT tender]] was an unusual experimental type using six pairs of wheels in a 2-8-2 wheel arrangement, with the leading and trailing wheels in [[Bissel truck|bissel]] type pony trucks and the rest of the axles mounted with a rigid wheelbase. A similar [[South African type JV tender|Type JV tender]] had been built in the Salt River shops in Cape Town in 1936 for test purposes and as a prototype to the Type FT. The tender\u2019s wheel arrangement did not prove to be very successful, however, and was not used again.<ref name=\"Holland 2\"/><ref name=\"Paxton-Bourne\"/>\n\n===Soviet Union===\n[[File:The Soviet-built opposed-piston 2-10-4 of 1949.jpg|thumb|[[Soviet locomotive class OR23|Soviet class OR23]], c. 1949]] \nThere were two Texas-type locomotives built in the USSR. One, the [[Soviet locomotive class OR23|class OR23]], built in 1949 by the locomotive works in [[Ulan Ude]], had cylinders that were placed above the center driving axle. Unlike nearly all steam locomotives, the pistons had rods on both ends which transferred power to the wheels. The idea was to balance the driving forces on the wheels, allowing the counterweights on the wheels to be smaller and reducing [[hammer blow]] on the track. Test runs showed, however, that the OR23 design was unsuitable as a practical locomotive. The locomotive was never used for more than testing and was returned to its builder  and scrapped.<ref name=Russia/>\n\n===United States of America===\n\n====Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe====\nThe [[Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway]] (ATSF) took delivery of locomotive No. 3829 from the [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] in 1919. It was used by Santa Fe as an experimental locomotive and was rostered as a member of ATSF\u2019s 3800 class of 2-10-2s that was fitted with a four-wheel trailing truck. Nearly one-hundred more 3800 class locomotives were delivered after No. 3829, but all with the 2-10-2 wheel arrangement. Photographs exist that show No. 3829 fitted with at least two different designs of four-wheel trailing truck through the years. No other members of the 3800 class have been documented with four-wheel trailing trucks. No. 3829 was scrapped in 1955, still equipped with a four-wheel trailing truck.<ref>{{cite book|last=Worley|first=E. D.|date=1965|title=Iron Horses of the Santa Fe Trail|publisher=Southwest Railroad Historical Society|page=340|lccn=75-39813}}</ref>\n\n[[File:ATSF 5000 Madam Queen.jpg|thumb|[[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|ATSF]] {{nowrap|2-10-4}} No. 5000 ''Madame Queen'']]Santa Fe, who had originated the {{nowrap|2-10-4}} type, adopted it again in 1930 with [[Santa Fe 5000|No. 5000]], nicknamed ''Madame Queen''. This locomotive was similar to the C&O T-1, with the same {{convert|69|inch|mm|0|abbr=off}} drivers but with {{convert|300|psi|abbr=off}} boiler pressure and 60% limited cutoff. It proved the viability of the type on the Santa Fe railway, but the [[Great Depression]] shelved plans to acquire more.\n\nIn 1938, with the railroad's fortunes improving, Santa Fe acquired ten more {{nowrap|2-10-4}} locomotives. These came with {{convert|74|in|mm|0|abbr=off}} diameter drivers and {{convert|310|psi|abbr=off}} boiler pressure, making these ATSF {{nowrap|2-10-4}}s the fastest and most modern of all.\n\nOf the original order of ten, five were oil-burning and five coal-burning, but when Santa Fe ordered twenty-five more for delivery in 1944, all were delivered equipped to burn oil. The first of the 1944 batch produced 5,600 drawbar horsepower on road test, the highest figure known for a two-cylinder steam locomotive.\n\n====Texas and Pacific====\nThe {{nowrap|2-10-4}} type was revived in 1925 by the [[Lima Locomotive Works]]. This time it was an expansion of the [[2-8-4|{{nowrap|2-8-4}} Berkshire]] type that Lima had pioneered. A version of the Berkshire with ten driving wheels instead of eight was an obvious development and the first to be delivered were to the [[Texas and Pacific Railway]], after which the type was subsequently named. The four-wheel trailing truck allowed a much larger firebox and thus a greater ability to generate heat, and thus steam. The [[Superpower steam|''Superpower'']] design, as Lima's marketing department called it, resulted in a locomotive that could develop great power at speed while not running out of steam-generating ability.\n\n====Chesapeake & Ohio====\nThe early Lima-built Texas types were low-drivered, {{convert|60|to|64|in|mm|0|abbr=off}} in diameter, which did not leave enough space to fully counterweight the extremely heavy and sturdy [[side rod]]s and [[main rod]]s required for such a powerful locomotive's piston thrusts. That changed in 1930 on the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]] (C&O), who stretched the design of an [[Erie Railroad]] high-drivered Berkshire type locomotive to produce forty of the {{nowrap|C&O T-1}}, a Texas type with {{convert|69|in|mm|0|abbr=off}} diameter drivers that was both powerful and fast enough for the new higher-speed freight services that the railroads were introducing. All subsequent Texas types were of this higher-drivered sort.\n\n====Pennsylvania====\nThe [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] (PRR) ordered few new locomotives after 1930, since [[electrification]] both consumed the railroad's resources and resulted in a supply of excess steam locomotives that eliminated any requirement for new power. It was not until the [[Second World War]] had begun, that the PRR's locomotive fleet began to appear inadequate. Although the PRR urgently needed new and modern freight power, the [[War Production Board]] prohibited working on a new design and, since there was not enough time to trial a prototype in any event, the PRR cast around for other railroads' designs that it might modify for PRR use.\n\nIt settled on the {{nowrap|C&O\u2019s T-1}}. Some modifications were made to the design for these PRR ''War Babies''. These included PRR drop-couplers, sheet steel [[pilot (locomotive)|pilots]], PRR-style [[Control car (rail)|cabs]], large PRR [[tender (locomotive)|tenders]], [[Keystone (steam automobile)|Keystone]] number plates up front and other modifications. It still betrayed its foreign heritage by lacking the PRR trademark [[Belpaire firebox]] and by having a [[booster engine]] on the trailing truck. Altogether 125 locomotives were built between 1942 and 1944 and became the largest fleet of Texas type locomotives in existence. All were eventually sold as scrap when the Pennsylvania Railroad dieselized.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Carlson, Neil. |title=Toward the 2-10-4 |journal=Classic Trains Magazine (Fall 2010)|publisher=[[Kalmbach Publishing|Kalmbach]] |year=2010 |volume=11 |issue=3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Farrell, Jack W.|title=North American steam locomotives: The Berkshire and Texas types|year=1989|publisher=Pacific Fast Mail, Edmonds, WA|isbn=0-915713-15-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Westcott|first=Lynn.

The evolution of this locomotive type began as a [[2-10-2|{{nowrap|2-10-2}} Santa Fe]] type with a larger four-wheeled trailing truck that would allow an enlarged [[Firebox (steam engine)|firebox]]. A subsequent development was as an elongated [[2-8-4|{{nowrap|2-8-4}} Berkshire]] type that required extra driving wheels to remain within [[axle load]] limits. Examples of both of these evolutionary progressions can be found.<ref name=Barris />\n\nSome {{nowrap|2-10-4}} [[tank locomotive]]s also existed in eastern Europe. One extraordinary experimental {{nowrap|2-10-4}} tender locomotive, built in the [[Soviet Union]], had an [[Soviet opposed-piston 2-10-4|opposed piston drive system]].<ref name=Russia>[http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/LOCOLOCO/russ/russrefr.htm Russian Reforms] (Accessed on 3 October 2016)</ref>\n\n==Usage==\n\n===Belgian Congo===\n[[File:CF du Bas-Congo 2-10-4 801.jpg|thumb|No. 801 dumped at Lubumbashi]]\nThe Texas type was rare in Africa. One locomotive, numbered 801, was built for the ''CF du Bas-Congo au Katanga'' by [[John Cockerill (company)|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme John Cockerill]] in 1939. It had {{convert|540|by|550|mm|abbr=off}} cylinders and {{convert|1100|mm|in|0|abbr=off}} diameter driving wheels, with a working order mass of {{convert|107.8|t|abbr=off}}, a grate area of {{convert|5.4|m2|abbr=off}} and a tractive effort at 65% boiler pressure of {{convert|14690|kgf|abbr=off}}. The locomotive is believed to have been built for the line between [[Bukama]] and [[Kamina]] and accumulated {{convert|1200000|km|mi|abbr=off}} during its service lifetime. Even with its large size, it was hand-fired and had two firebox doors, with two firemen being carried.<ref>Blanchart, De Deurwaerder, N\u00e8ve, Robeyns & Van Bost (1999).

In South America, the Central Railway of Brazil ordered seventeen {{Track gauge|metre|allk=on}} {{nowrap|2-10-4}} locomotives, ten from [[Baldwin Locomotive Works|Baldwin]] which were delivered in 1940, and another seven from the [[American Locomotive Company]] which were delivered in 1947.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Canada===\nThe Canadian Pacific (CP) [[Selkirk locomotive]]s were all built by [[Montreal Locomotive Works]] (MLW). The first twenty of these large engines were built in 1929, designated T1a class and allocated numbers 5900 to 5919. Their Canadian type name was after the [[Selkirk Mountains]] across which they were placed in service, the railway summit of which was located just inside the western portal of the [[Connaught Tunnel]] beneath [[Rogers Pass (British Columbia)|Rogers Pass]].<ref name=Atkins>{{cite book| first=C.P., B.Sc.| last=Atkins| title=Loco Profile 35: Canadian Pacific Selkirks| publisher=Profile Publications Ltd.| location=Windsor, England| year=1973}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Canadian Pacific Selkirk class 5927 takes on oil at the South Edmonton shops.jpg|thumb|Canadian Pacific T1b, 1957]]\nMLW built another ten of these successful locomotives for CP during November and December 1938, designated T1b class and numbered from 5920 to 5929. Modifications to the original design led to the T1b being ten tonnes lighter while its operating steam pressure was increased from {{convert|275|to|285|psi|abbr=off}}.<ref name=Atkins/>\n\nA further six Selkirks, classed T1c and numbered from 5930 to 5935, were delivered by MLW in 1949. They were the last [[standard gauge]] steam locomotives to be built in Canada for a Canadian railway. These were very similar to the T1b class, apart from a few refinements which included two cross-compound air compressors to speed up recharging of the air brake system, while some small streamlining touches were not retained, such as the streamlined casing around the smokebox stack as well as the teardrop shape of the classification lights. In addition, the inside of the cabs were no longer insulated in the same manner as the previous versions, which had provided better cold-weather cab insulation and were better-liked by crews. The last Selkirks were taken out of service in 1959. These were the most powerful steam locomotives in the British Empire. <ref name=Atkins/>\n\n===South Africa===\n[[File:Class 21 no. 2551 (2-10-4) a.jpg|thumb|left|[[South African Class 21 2-10-4|SAR Class 21]], c. 1937]]\nIn 1937, the South African Railways (SAR) placed one {{Track gauge|Cape|allk=on}} [[South African Class 21 2-10-4|Class 21]] steam locomotive with a Texas wheel arrangement in service, designed as a mixed traffic locomotive suitable for light rail. It was designed by A.G. Watson, Chief Mechanical Engineer of the SAR from 1929 to 1936, and built by the [[North British Locomotive Company]] in Glasgow. Only the one locomotive was built, at the time representing the maximum power obtainable on Cape gauge from a ten-coupled non-articulated locomotive that was limited to a {{convert|15|LT|t|1|abbr=off}} axle load on {{convert|60|lb/yd|kg/m|abbr=off}} rail. To enable it to negotiate tight curves, the third and fourth sets of coupled wheels were [[flangeless driver|flangeless]].<ref name=\"Holland 2\">{{Holland-Vol 2|pages=73-76}}</ref><ref name=\"NBL\">North British Locomotive Company works list, compiled by Austrian locomotive historian Bernhard Schmeiser</ref><ref name=\"diagram-book\">South African Railways and Harbours Locomotive Diagram Book, 2\u20190\" & 3\u20196\" Gauge Steam Locomotives, 15 August 1941, as amended</ref><ref name=\"Paxton-Bourne\">{{Paxton-Bourne|pages=10-11, 74-75}}</ref>\n\nThe locomotive\u2019s [[South African type FT tender|Type FT tender]] was an unusual experimental type using six pairs of wheels in a 2-8-2 wheel arrangement, with the leading and trailing wheels in [[Bissel truck|bissel]] type pony trucks and the rest of the axles mounted with a rigid wheelbase. A similar [[South African type JV tender|Type JV tender]] had been built in the Salt River shops in Cape Town in 1936 for test purposes and as a prototype to the Type FT. The tender\u2019s wheel arrangement did not prove to be very successful, however, and was not used again.<ref name=\"Holland 2\"/><ref name=\"Paxton-Bourne\"/>\n\n===Soviet Union===\n[[File:The Soviet-built opposed-piston 2-10-4 of 1949.jpg|thumb|[[Soviet locomotive class OR23|Soviet class OR23]], c. 1949]] \nThere were two Texas-type locomotives built in the USSR. One, the [[Soviet locomotive class OR23|class OR23]], built in 1949 by the locomotive works in [[Ulan Ude]], had cylinders that were placed above the center driving axle. Unlike nearly all steam locomotives, the pistons had rods on both ends which transferred power to the wheels. The idea was to balance the driving forces on the wheels, allowing the counterweights on the wheels to be smaller and reducing [[hammer blow]] on the track. Test runs showed, however, that the OR23 design was unsuitable as a practical locomotive. The locomotive was never used for more than testing and was returned to its builder  and scrapped.<ref name=Russia/>\n\n===United States of America===\n\n====Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe====\nThe [[Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway]] (ATSF) took delivery of locomotive no. 3829 from the [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] in 1919. It was used by Santa Fe as an experimental locomotive and was rostered as a member of ATSF\u2019s 3800 class of 2-10-2s that was fitted with a four-wheel trailing truck. Nearly a hundred more 3800 class locomotives were delivered after no. 3829, but all with the 2-10-2 wheel arrangement. Photographs exist that show no. 3829 fitted with at least two different designs of four-wheel trailing truck through the years. No other members of the 3800 class have been documented with four-wheel trailing trucks. No. 3829 was scrapped in 1955, still equipped with a four-wheel trailing truck.<ref>{{cite book|last=Worley|first=E. D.|date=1965|title=Iron Horses of the Santa Fe Trail|publisher=Southwest Railroad Historical Society|page=340|lccn=75-39813}}</ref>\n\n[[File:ATSF 5000 Madam Queen.jpg|thumb|[[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|ATSF]] {{nowrap|2-10-4}} No. 5000 ''Madame Queen'']]Santa Fe, who had originated the {{nowrap|2-10-4}} type, adopted it again in 1930 with [[Santa Fe 5000|no. 5000]], nicknamed ''Madame Queen''. This locomotive was similar to the C&O T-1, with the same {{convert|69|inch|mm|0|abbr=off}} drivers but with {{convert|300|psi|abbr=off}} boiler pressure and 60% limited cutoff. It proved the viability of the type on the Santa Fe railway, but the [[Great Depression]] shelved plans to acquire more.\n\nIn 1938, with the railroad's fortunes improving, Santa Fe acquired ten more {{nowrap|2-10-4}} locomotives. These came with {{convert|74|in|mm|0|abbr=off}} diameter drivers and {{convert|310|psi|abbr=off}} boiler pressure, making these ATSF {{nowrap|2-10-4}}s the fastest and most modern of all.\n\nOf the original order of ten, five were oil-burning and five coal-burning, but when Santa Fe ordered twenty-five more for delivery in 1944, all were delivered equipped to burn oil. The first of the 1944 batch produced 5600 drawbar horsepower on road test, the highest figure known for a two-cylinder steam locomotive.\n\n====Texas and Pacific====\nThe {{nowrap|2-10-4}} type was revived in 1925 by the [[Lima Locomotive Works]]. This time it was an expansion of the [[2-8-4|{{nowrap|2-8-4}} Berkshire]] type that Lima had pioneered. A version of the Berkshire with ten driving wheels instead of eight was an obvious development and the first to be delivered were to the [[Texas and Pacific Railway]], after which the type was subsequently named. The four-wheel trailing truck allowed a much larger firebox and thus a greater ability to generate heat, and thus steam. The [[Superpower steam|''Superpower'']] design, as Lima's marketing department called it, resulted in a locomotive that could develop great power at speed while not running out of steam-generating ability.\n\n====Chesapeake & Ohio====\nThe early Lima-built Texas types were low-drivered, {{convert|60|to|64|in|mm|0|abbr=off}} in diameter, which did not leave enough space to fully counterweight the extremely heavy and sturdy [[side rod]]s and [[main rod]]s required for such a powerful locomotive's piston thrusts. That changed in 1930 on the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]] (C&O), who stretched the design of an [[Erie Railroad]] high-drivered Berkshire type locomotive to produce forty of the {{nowrap|C&O T-1}}, a Texas type with {{convert|69|in|mm|0|abbr=off}} diameter drivers that was both powerful and fast enough for the new higher-speed freight services that the railroads were introducing. All subsequent Texas types were of this higher-drivered sort.\n\n====Pennsylvania====\nThe [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] (PRR) ordered few new locomotives after 1930, since [[electrification]] both consumed the railroad's resources and resulted in a supply of excess steam locomotives that eliminated any requirement for new power. It was not until the [[Second World War]] had begun, that the PRR's locomotive fleet began to appear inadequate. Although the PRR urgently needed new and modern freight power, the [[War Production Board]] prohibited working on a new design and, since there was not enough time to trial a prototype in any event, the PRR cast around for other railroads' designs that it might modify for PRR use.\n\nIt settled on the {{nowrap|C&O\u2019s T-1}}. Some modifications were made to the design for these PRR ''War Babies''. These included PRR drop-couplers, sheet steel [[pilot (locomotive)|pilots]], PRR-style [[Control car (rail)|cabs]], large PRR [[tender (locomotive)|tenders]], [[Keystone (steam automobile)|Keystone]] number plates up front and other modifications. It still betrayed its foreign heritage by lacking the PRR trademark [[Belpaire firebox]] and by having a [[booster engine]] on the trailing truck. Altogether 125 locomotives were built between 1942 and 1944 and became the largest fleet of Texas type locomotives in existence. All were eventually sold as scrap when the Pennsylvania Railroad dieselized.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Carlson, Neil. |title=Toward the 2-10-4 |journal=Classic Trains Magazine (Fall 2010)|publisher=[[Kalmbach Publishing|Kalmbach]] |year=2010 |volume=11 |issue=3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Farrell, Jack W.|title=North American steam locomotives: The Berkshire and Texas types|year=1989|publisher=Pacific Fast Mail, Edmonds, WA|isbn=0-915713-15-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Westcott|first=Lynn.

Developed in an era when [[HEAT]] warheads were thought to make conventional heavy armour of limited value, the Leopard focused on firepower in the form of the German-built version of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Ordnance L7|L7]] 105-mm gun, and improved cross-country performance that was unmatched by other designs of the era.\n\nThe design started as a collaborative project during the 1950s between [[West Germany]] and [[France]], and later joined by [[Italy]],<ref name=TGelbart109>{{cite book |last=Gelbart |first=Marsh |title=Tanks main battle and light tanks |year=1996 |publisher=Brassey\u2019s UK Ltd |pages=109\u2013110 |isbn=1-85753-168-X}}</ref> but the partnership ended shortly after and the final design was ordered by the [[Bundeswehr]], with full-scale production starting in 1965. In total, 6,485 Leopard tanks have been built, of which 4,744 were battle tanks and 1,741 were utility and anti-aircraft variants, not including 80 prototypes and pre-series vehicles.\n\nThe Leopard quickly became a standard of European forces, and eventually served as the [[main battle tank]] in over a dozen countries worldwide, with West Germany, Italy and the Netherlands being the largest operators until their retirement. Since 1990, the Leopard 1 has gradually been relegated to secondary roles in most armies. In the [[German Army]], the Leopard 1 was completely phased out in 2003 by the [[Leopard 2]], while Leopard 1-based vehicles are still widely used in utility roles. The Leopard 2 has replaced the Leopard 1 in service with many other nations as well, with derived vehicles using the Leopard 1 hull still seeing service. Currently, the largest operators are [[Greece]], with 520 vehicles, [[Turkey]], with 397 vehicles and [[Brazil]] with 378 vehicles. Most of these vehicles have been upgraded with various improvements to armour, firepower and sensors to maintain their ability to engage modern threats.\n\n== Development history ==\n=== Leopard 1 ===\n[[File:Leopard 1 Schnittmodell.jpg|thumb|left|Leopard 1 prototype]]The Leopard project started in November 1956 in order to develop a modern tank, the ''Standard-Panzer'', to replace the Bundeswehr's American-built [[M47 Patton|M47]] and [[M48 Patton]] tanks, which, though just delivered to West Germany's recently reconstituted army, were rapidly becoming outdated. On 25 July 1957, the detailed specifications were released; the new design needed to weigh no more than 30 tonnes, have a power-to-weight ratio of 30 horsepower per tonne, be able to withstand hits by 20&nbsp;mm rapid-fire guns on every side as well as to operate in a battlefield contaminated with [[chemical weapons]] or radioactive [[nuclear fallout|fallout]], the then-standard baseline for combat with the [[Warsaw Pact]]. In addition, the main armament had to consist of a 105&nbsp;mm caliber weapon (the new British L7A3 105&nbsp;mm gun was selected), carrying at least as many rounds as current US tank designs. Mobility had priority, while firepower came second; armour was seen as less essential, as it was believed that no real protection against [[hollow charge]] weapons was possible anyway.\n\nFrance was very interested in the design as its own [[AMX 50]] project had just failed. In June 1957, [[West Germany]] and the [[French Fourth Republic]] signed an agreement to develop a common tank, designated in German ''Europa-Panzer''. Three German (''Arbeitsgruppe'' A, B and C) and one French design team would be included in a competition, with each team producing two prototypes. In September 1958, [[Italian Army|Italy]] joined the development program. Several prototypes were entered for testing in 1960. Among the prototypes were [[Porsche]]'s ''Model 734'' from team A, sporting a cast turret, and that of team B ([[Rheinmetall]]), whose cast turret was somewhat higher. Team C from ''Borgward'', designing a very futuristic tank, failed to have a prototype ready in time.\n\nEven before these first prototypes were finished, it had (in 1959) been decided that a second phase with improved designs would be started: Team A had to build 26 phase II prototypes for testing, team B six. Only two tanks of the required six would actually be constructed by team B.\n\nThe Porsche Prototype II was eventually selected as the winner of the contest in 1963; this did not come as a surprise: it had already been decided in 1961 to build a pre-series of 50 vehicles based on this design; production of these was started that very year. This \"0-series\" was modified with a new cast turret and several hull changes to raise the rear deck to provide more room in the engine compartment and move some of the radiators to the upper sides of the hull. Before mass production of the standard version started, it was also decided to add an optical range-finding system for better long-range gunnery, which required the turret to be somewhat taller, and added \"bumps\" on either side of the turret to mount the optics for [[triangulation]]. Germany dropped France from the joint program after France repeatedly missed deadlines for its contribution to the program.<ref name=\"France dropped\">{{cite news |last1=Wilcke |first1=Gerd |title=Bonn to Build Own Tanks Despite Pact With France; Approval Is Sought |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1963/02/18/archives/bonn-to-build-own-tanks-despite-pact-with-france-approval-is-sought.html |accessdate=19 August 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=17 February 1963 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819083105/https://www.nytimes.com/1963/02/18/archives/bonn-to-build-own-tanks-despite-pact-with-france-approval-is-sought.html |archive-date=19 August 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> In February 1963 Defence Minister [[Kai-Uwe von Hassel]] announced he would soon ask the defense committee in Parliament to approve production of the tank.

The Leopard was soon being purchased from Germany by a number of [[NATO]] members and other allies, including (in chronological order) [[Belgium]] (1968), the [[Netherlands]] (1969), [[Norway]] (1970), [[Italy]] (1971), [[Denmark]] (1976), [[Australia]] (1976), [[Canada]] (1978), [[Turkey]] (1980) and [[Greece]] (1981). It is also key to note that Germany has a strict export-policy for their military equipment. [[Greece]], [[Spain]] and [[Chile]], while still under dictatorships, purchased the French [[AMX-30]] instead.\n\n=== Leopard 1A1 ===\n[[File:Leopard1 Bundeswehr 1983.jpg|thumb|right|[[German Army]] Leopard 1A1]]\n[[File:2 norwegian Leopard tanks in the snow.jpg|thumb|right|[[Norwegian Army]] Leopard 1A1]]\n\nAfter the first batch was delivered, the next three batches were the ''Leopard 1A1'' model, which included a new gun stabilization system from [[Cadillac Gage]] that allowed the tank to fire effectively on the move. The 1A1 also added the now-famous \"skirts\" along the sides to protect the upper tracks, and a new [[Thermal sleeve|thermal jacket]] on the gun barrel to control heating. A less important change was to use rectangular rubber blocks fastened to the treads with a single pin instead of the earlier two-pin \"shaped\" versions. The rubber blocks could be easily replaced with metal X-shaped crampons for movement on [[ice]] and snow in the winter.\n\nBetween 1974 and 1977, all of the machines in the first four batches were brought to the same ''Leopard 1A1A1'' standard, and given additional turret armour developed by [[Blohm & Voss]]. A further upgrade in the 1980s added leftover image-intensifier night sights, which were being handed down from the Leopard 2 as they were themselves upgraded. The PZB 200 [[image intensification]] system was mounted in a large box on the upper right of the gun, creating the ''Leopard 1A1A2''. A further upgrade with SEM80/90 all-digital radios created the ''Leopard 1A1A3''. Later improvements to the image intensifier created the ''Leopard 1A1A4''.\n\n=== Leopard 1A2 ===\n[[File:Leopard Tiefwaten.jpg|thumb|left|Leopard 1A2 crossing a river at night.]]\n\nThe first 232 tanks of the fifth production batch were delivered as the ''Leopard 1A2'' between 1972 and 1974. The A2 included a heavier and better armoured turret, and therefore did not receive the B&V armour add-ons as did the earlier machines. However, they did receive the other upgrades; the ''Leopard 1A2A1'' received the PZB 200, the ''Leopard 1A2A2'' received digital radios, and the ''Leopard 1A2A3'' got both.\n\n=== Leopard 1A3 ===\nThe next 110 vehicles in the fifth batch were fitted with a new welded turret, which was equipped with a new armour consisting of two spaced steel plates with a plastic filling between them (''high-hardness armour''{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}), and a wedge-shaped gun mantlet, creating the ''Leopard 1A3''. Although the level of armour area density was equivalent to the A2's new welded version, the internal volume was increased by 1.2 m\u00b3 and the effective protection level was increased by half. The improved TRP 2A independent sight was installed for the commander. Upgrades were identical to the 1A2 models, the ''Leopard 1A3A1'' with the night sights, ''Leopard 1A3A2'' with the new radios, and the ''Leopard 1A3A3'' with both.\n\n=== Leopard 1A4 ===\nThe ''Leopard 1A4'' formed the sixth batch of 250 vehicles, delivery starting in 1974. The 1A4 was externally similar to the 1A3, but included a new computerized [[fire control system]] and the new EMES 12A1 sighting system to aim it. In addition, the commander was provided with his own independent night sighting system, the PERI R12. The new equipment used up space and the ammunition load was reduced to 55 rounds, of which 42 were stored in the magazine to the left of the driver.\n\n=== Leopard 1A5 ===\n[[File:Brazilian Leopard 1 tank.jpg|thumb|[[Brazilian Army]] Leopard 1A5 BR tank.]]\nIn 1980, a research program was undertaken to study further improvements to the Leopard 1, providing it with a completely modern fire control system and fully effective night/bad-weather vision system. The decision was made to base the upgrades on the earlier models, which were no longer competitive.\n\nThe resulting ''Leopard 1A5'' was based on 1,225 vehicles of the Leopard 1A1A1 model. The turrets were again modified for the 1A5, both in order to store all of the new equipment, as well as to move more of the ammunition into the rear of the turret, as opposed to the left side of the driver where it had previously been stored. The new turret was also able to mount the newer 120&nbsp;mm gun from the Leopard 2 if desired, although this option has not been used.\n\nAfter trials, the Krupp-[[Atlas Elektronik]] EMES 18 fire control system, which was developed from the [[EMES 15]] used on the Leopard 2, was selected in December 1983. The EMES 18 included two new sights on the top of the turret, and no longer required the \"bumps\" as did the earlier optical systems. A crucial part of the upgrade was the introduction of more effective ammunition, including new [[Kinetic energy penetrator|APFSDS]] rounds.\n\nThe Leopard tank could also be fitted with bolt-on lexan armour panels, which have increased the effectiveness of the armour. These \"modified\" tanks have proved themselves in the field.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nThe first modified vehicle was delivered in early 1987. Since then, almost all users of the Leopard 1 have also applied similar changes to their own vehicles, and in most ways the 1A5 be considered the \"standard\" Leopard 1 today.\n\nIn the Netherlands, an improved version equivalent to the A5 called \"Leopard 1 Verbeterd\" (improved) was developed, the same version is used by the [[Chilean Army]].\n\n=== Leopard 1A6 ===\nThe ''Leopard 1A6'' prototype was a single Leopard 1 A1A1 testbed, modified with additional armour on the turret and equipped with a 120&nbsp;mm L/44 gun. The project was ended in 1987, as the Leopard 2 was in widespread service at this point and the 1A5 offered a more reasonable upgrade path for a fraction of the cost.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n=== Modified and derivative vehicles {{anchor|Beaver}} ===\n\n[[File:Dachs - 4.jpg|thumb|Armoured engineering vehicle \"Dachs\" (Badger) German Army.]]\n[[File:Bergepanzer2.jpg|thumb|Bergepanzer 2 (Armoured recovery vehicle) GE Army.]]\n[[File:Panzerschnellbruecke Biber auf Brueckenleger.jpg|thumb|Bridgelayer \"Biber\" (Beaver) with armoured vehicle-launched bridge.]]\n\nSimultaneous to the production of the battle tanks, a number of engineering, bridging and recovery vehicles were developed, as well as a number of versions used in the [[anti-aircraft]] role.\n\nThe most well known Leopard variants are the Bridgelayer \"Biber\" ('''Beaver'''), \"Bergepanzer 2\" armoured recovery vehicle, \"Pionierpanzer 2 Dachs\" (''Badger'') armoured engineer vehicle and the \"[[Flugabwehrkanonenpanzer Gepard|Gepard]]\" self-propelled anti-aircraft gun. The [[Warsaw Pact]] equivalent of the Gepard is the [[ZSU-23-4]]. [[Marconi Electronic Systems]] once offered conversions to the [[Marksman anti-aircraft system|Marksman]] [[Self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon|SPAAG]] for existing users of the Leopard 1; the Leopard 1 chassis would be used to carry the Marksman turret.\n\nThe [[Canadian Army]] operates the Beaver [[Armoured vehicle-launched bridge]], Taurus [[Armoured recovery vehicle|ARV]], and Badger [[Armoured engineering vehicle|AEV]], all based on the Leopard 1.\n\nThe United Kingdom's [[Royal Marines]] operate a vehicle known as the [[Beach armoured recovery vehicle#Hippo BRV|Hippo]] [[beach armoured recovery vehicle]]. The Hippo is a conversion of a Leopard 1A5 chassis by [[Alvis Vickers|ALVIS Moelv]]. The main alteration has been the replacement of the turret with a raised superstructure that resembles the wheelhouse of a boat. The original 830&nbsp;hp (634&nbsp;kW) diesel engine has been retained, but the gearing of the transmission had been lowered, reducing the vehicle's road speed to 32&nbsp;km/h (20&nbsp;mph), but increasing [[tractive effort]] to 250&nbsp;kN (56,000&nbsp;lbf). Other modifications include the addition of working platforms, a nosing block, raised air intakes and an [[Auxiliary power unit]]; this has raised the weight of the vehicle from 42.5 tonnes to 50 tonnes. The Hippo has a fording depth of 2.95&nbsp;m (10&nbsp;ft) and can pull vehicles up to 50 tonnes weight or push off from the beach a 240 tonne [[displacement (fluid)|displacement]] [[landing craft]].\n\n=== Gilded Leopard, ''Eber'' and ''Keiler'' ===\nAlmost as soon as the Leopard was introduced into service in 1965, Porsche was awarded a contract to study further improvements to the existing design, while waiting deliveries of the [[MBT-70]] in the mid-1970s. This original ''Gilded Leopard'' (''vergoldeter Leopard'') program expired in 1967 with no production order. In that year, it had already become obvious that the MBT-70 would be a failure. The agreement between the US and the Federal Republic of Germany forbade any national development of an MBT apart from technological experimentation, so a new tank project was begun under the designation of ''Experimentalentwicklung'' or \"experimental development\", two prototypes of which were built.\n\nWhen the MBT-70 program was ended, a further contract was offered under the name ''Boar'' (''Eber''), with an emphasis on using as many technologies from the MBT-70 as possible, but without the problematic XM150 152&nbsp;mm (6.0&nbsp;in) combined gun/[[MGM-51 Shillelagh]] missile launcher. Two prototype vehicles were constructed using a new chassis from Porsche with the road wheels from the MBT-70 and the original Leopard engine, combined with a new Wegmann turret mounting the MBT-70's [[Rheinmetall 120&nbsp;mm Gun|Rheinmetall 120&nbsp;mm smoothbore gun]] (although some also mounted the original 105&nbsp;mm L7). These were considered promising enough that seven more were ordered, this time powered by the MTU engine designed for the MBT-70. When this happened, the ''Experimentalentwicklung'' team went public with their alternative design which they called the ''Keiler'' (a synonym of ''Eber''). In 1971, the minister of defence, [[Helmut Schmidt]], decided to abandon the ''Eber''-project and build 17 prototypes of a Leopard 2, based on the ''Keiler'' design, which had a turret with spaced [[sloped armour]]. The maximum weight was to be 50 tonnes.\n\nDuring the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], 1950s and 1960s generation tanks were badly beaten by [[wire-guided missile]]s, and it was realized that dramatically improved armour protection was needed. The decision was made to allow the tank to increase its weight to the next classification, Military Loading Class 60 (tonnes), and a new design effort was started, with the spaced armour replaced with a much denser perforated armour assemblage. The new design would go on to augment and, after the [[Cold War]], sometimes replace the Leopard in many countries' armies.\n\n== Operational history ==\n=== Australia ===\n[[File:Australian Leopard AS1 tank forest.jpg|thumb|Australian Army Leopard 1A4 (AS1) on exercise.]]\nIn 1974, the Australian government confirmed the purchase of the Leopard, with a total of 101 vehicles being acquired (consisting of 90 MBTs, five Bridgelayers and six Armoured Recovery Vehicles). Two more ARVs were purchased later. The first Leopards subsequently arrived in Australia from Germany in 1976, ending a selection and trial process (against the US [[M60 Patton|M60]]<ref>Hunnicutt, p. 6 & 408</ref> series) that started in 1971 when the army decided it needed a replacement for its British [[Centurion tank|Centurions]], which had served since 1952 and been deployed during the Vietnam war.\n\nIn March 2004, the decision was made to replace the Leopard 1 with reconditioned US [[M1 Abrams|M1A1 Abrams AIM]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.defence.gov.au/dmo/lsd/land907/land907.cfm |title=Australian Defence Force maintains a supportable, survivable and interoperable tank capability until at least 2020 |publisher=Defence.gov.au |accessdate=2015-11-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117032149/http://www.defence.gov.au/dmo/lsd/land907/land907.cfm |archive-date=2015-11-17 |url-status=live }}</ref> The first 18 of 59 M1A1 Abrams arrived in September 2006. The [[M88 Recovery Vehicle|M88A2 Hercules]] is concurrently replacing the Leopard family of support variants in Australian service. The Leopard 1 was operated by the [[1st Armoured Regiment (Australia)|1st Armoured Regiment]] and was officially withdrawn from service in July 2007. Their guns were never fired in combat operations. Some of the tanks were subsequently offered to military museums or [[Returned and Services League of Australia|RSL]] clubs.<ref>McPhederan, Ian [http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/tanks-to-scare-neighbours/story-e6frf7kx-1111114422073 Leopard tanks up for grabs] ''[[Herald Sun]]'' Retrieved May 12, 2016</ref>\n\n=== Belgium ===\nThe Belgian Army received their 334 Leopard 1BE between 1968 and 1971. They equipped eight tank regiments, each equipped with 40 Leopards, and the Armour School. The first regiment to receive the Leopard was the 4th Lancers, followed by the 1st Lancers, 2nd Lancers, 3rd Lancers, 8th Lancers, 1st Guides, 2nd Guides and finally the 2nd Mounted Rifles. From 1974, they were modified with a gun stabilisation system and an Automatic firing direction system (AVLS = Automatisch VuurLeidingsSysteem) from SABCA. This system allowed the gun to fire on the move.\n\nIn 1984, the Army Command decided to upgrade 132 Leopard to the A5 standard. At the end of the Cold War, there was a drastic cut in the number of tanks and 128 were sold to Brazil. The upgrade, which started in 1993, was completed in 1997. The upgrade included a new gun firing direction system with thermal imaging, laser rangefinder and a muzzle reference system. At that time, four regiments were still equipped with the Leopard 1A5(BE). At the end of the 1990s, the remaining four regiments amalgamated into two tank regiments, the [[1st/3rd Lancers Regiment|1st/3rd Lancers]] and the [[2nd/4th Lancers Regiment|2nd/4th Lancers]]. In 2010, the 2nd/4th Lancers was disbanded. Around 40 Leopard 1A5(BE) are kept operational in the 1st/3rd Lancers and [[Regiment Carabiniers Prins Boudewijn \u2013 Grenadiers|Carabiniers Prins Boudewijn \u2013 Grenadiers]]. The 1st/3rd Lancers is no longer a tank regiment, but a medium infantry battalion, identical to the rest of the medium infantry battalions of the Belgian Army except for having a single squadron of Leopard 1A5(BE). Belgian Leopards have served in Kosovo and Afghanistan. In 2014, following the government's decision to replace all Land Component tracked vehicles (Leopards, AIFV, and M113) with PIRANHA DF90s,<ref>{{cite web |title=PIRANHA DF90 |url=https://mil.be/fr/materiel/piranha-df90 |website=LA DEFENSE |accessdate=13 July 2019}}</ref> Belgian Leopards were retired from service with most tanks being sold, put on display, or used for target practice.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Verboven |first1=Stijn |title=LE L\u00c9OPARD TIRE SA R\u00c9V\u00c9RENCE |url=https://www.mil.be/fr/article/le-leopard-tire-sa-reverence |website=LA DEFENSE |accessdate=13 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Belgian Army also had the following variants:\n* 36 armoured recovery vehicles (ARV \u2013 TRV)\n* 17 Pionier tanks (armoured engineers)\n* 55 Gepard anti-aircraft tanks (withdrawn from service)\n* 12 driving school tanks\n* 9 Leguan AVLB (armoured vehicle-launched bridge)\n\n=== Canada ===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Land Force Command (Canada)]] -->\n[[File:Leopard C2 Canadian Forces.jpg|thumb|right|Canadian Leopard C2 uparmoured, en route to Afghanistan, October 2006]]\n[[File:Leopard C2 MBT, RMC, CFB Kingston, 1.jpg|thumb|right|Canadian Leopard C2 [[Royal Military College of Canada]]]]\n\nAs a replacement for the [[Centurion Tank]], Canada acquired 127 Leopard C1 tanks (equivalent to Leopard 1A3 with laser rangefinder) in 1978\u201379 for its [[Canadian Forces Land Force Command|Land Forces]], with 114 being put into service. Most of these tanks were stationed in Germany during the Cold War, with a few retained at [[Canadian Forces Base Gagetown]], New Brunswick for training.

They were later upgraded with the same sights and fire-control system as the Leopard C2 (see below).\n\nStarting in 2000, the 114 Leopard C1 tanks in service were upgraded to C2 standard at a cost of [[Canadian dollar|CA$]]139 million. The turrets of 123 surplus Leopard 1A5 tanks purchased from the German Defence Ministry were fitted into the existing hulls (nine turrets were reserved for spare parts and training), and the German tank hulls sold back to the upgrade contractor.

Delivery was completed in 1978. In 1992, Denmark acquired another 110 1A3 tanks (partly through [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe|Conventional Forces Europe]] treaty AFV reduction requirements.) These tanks were upgraded to Leopard 1A5-DK along with the first 120 Leopards, which were not identical to the German 1A5 with welded turrets. Denmark had 230 Leopard 1A5-DKs.\n\nThese Leopards were involved in one of the most important engagements in modern Danish military history. Denmark was the only Scandinavian country to send a significant tank force to support their peacekeeping operations in Croatia and Bosnia. On the 29th of April 1994 near the city of [[Tuzla]] seven Danish Leopard 1A5 tanks was involved in a skirmish between [[UNPROFOR]]s Nordic Battalion (NORDBAT 2) and Bosnian-Serb military forces from the [[\u0160ekovi\u0107i]] brigade. The tanks was sent out to relieve a Swedish-manned observation post that had come under ambush fire by the Bosnian-Serb forces. Upon the tanks arrival at the observation post they were shelled by mortar fire and anti-tank rockets, which led the [[UN]] marked and white-painted Leopard 1A5 tanks to return fire. No casualties were suffered by Swedish observation post nor the Danish tank, however the Serbian casualties is estimated as high as 150 soldiers. This is believed to be the first hostile engagement involving the Leopard 1 tank.<ref>[[Operation B\u00f8llebank]]</ref><ref>Tak for turen!, Lars R.

They are actually Leopard 1A3s, but came with an EMES 12A3 FCS and some other modifications required by the Greek army at that time. During 1992, the Greek army received a batch of 75 Leopard 1A5 as offsets for the construction of 4 MEKO 200 frigates. Some months later, Greece received another batch of 170 Leopard 1V and 2 Leopard 1A5 from the Royal Netherlands army \u2013 the Leopard 1V is actually an 1A1A4 with an EMES 12A3 AFSL-2 FCS. From 1998 until 2000, Greece bought 192 used Leopard 1A5s as offsets for the upgrade of the Greek F-4 aircraft in Germany in a symbolic price. In 2001, the Greek army decided to upgrade 104 Leopard 1A4GR and 120 Leopard 1V to the A5+ version, costing 234 million dollars. However, the programme was cancelled because Greece received a batch of 150 Leopard 1A5s along with the newly built Leopard 2A6 HEL. In 2011, Greece is the largest user of Leopard 1 tanks, having over 500 Leopard 1A5 GR MBTs as well as many ST, Biber and Leguan versions.\n\n=== Italy ===\nItaly had to replace an enormous amount of [[M47 Patton]] (over 2,000 were received by US stocks) but, unlike other NATO members, did not instigate a national project to archive this. Its army, not entirely satisfied by the M60 Patton (300 delivered, of those 200 were produced by OTO-Melara), placed its first order for the Leopard 1 in 1970, with 200 Leopard 1A1 and 69 Bergepanzer 2 delivered between 1971 and 1972. The vehicles replaced the M47 in the [[Italian Army]]'s [[Pozzuolo del Friuli Cavalry Brigade|Cavalry Brigade ''\"Pozzuolo del Friuli\"'']]. A further 600 Leopard 1A2 and 67 Bergepanzer 2 were built in Italy by [[OTO Melara]] with deliveries starting in 1975, with a second batch of 120 build by [[OTO Melara]] between 1980 and 1983. All Italian-built Leopards were A2, but without stabilyzer and skirts; the 200 A1s originally bought from Germany were partially upgraded lately at this standard. Forty Pionierleopard (AEV), nine school (for drivers, without armament) and 64 Biber (AVLB) were ordered in 1985. Twelve of the Pionierleopard were produced in Germany and 28 by OTO Melara in Italy. All of the Biber were assembled by OTO Melara in Italy. At the end, Italy was the biggest customer of the Leopard outside Germany (920 plus 250 special versions); the only one with a licence production; the only country that produced both M60 and Leopard 1. Lastly, the Leopard was the basis for Italian MBTs and heavy artillery systems, starting with Leone/Lion and the following [[OF-40]], leading to other developments like the Palmaria and OTOMATIC artillery systems (both on OF-40 hull).<ref>Il carro armato Leaopard 1, Storia Militare N.10-2018, Ed. Storia Militare srl, Genova</ref> This experience made possible to develop also the [[C-1 Ariete]], that was born because Italian army decided in 1984 to have a new national tank, instead to buy 300 Leopard 2.<ref>Dossier MBT, ED AI editions, Florence, 1990 p.22</ref>\n\nAt the end of the Cold War, the Italian Army began an upgrade and a downsizing of its armoured units; a number of Leopards were retired in 1991, along with its fleet of M60 tanks. In 1995, Italy bought 120 A5 surplus turrets from the [[Bundeswehr]], which were mounted on the same number of reworked A2 hulls. These tanks took part in the various peacekeeping missions in the [[Balkan]]s, but they never saw action.\n\nThe last A1/A2 was retired in 2003, with the last A5 going in 2008, leaving the [[Ariete]] as the sole tank in Italian service. The AEVs, ARVs, and AVLBs have been reduced in number and some have been modified to work with the Ariete. They are stated to serve for some more years, as no replacement has been selected yet.\n\n=== Lebanon ===\nLebanon and Belgium finalized the transfer of 43 Leopard 1/A5 tanks to the [[Lebanese Armed Forces]] in a deal worth 3.5 million euros, which also includes a number of ex-Belgian APCs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://mplbelgique.wordpress.com/2008/08/27/feu-vert-pour-la-vente-darmes-belges-au-liban/|title=Feu vert pour la vente d'armes belges au Liban|date=August 27, 2008|work=RTL info|publisher=Mouvement pour le Liban|accessdate=2008-12-11|language=French|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227005550/http://mplbelgique.wordpress.com/2008/08/27/feu-vert-pour-la-vente-darmes-belges-au-liban/|archive-date=December 27, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.fr.be.msn.com/politique/article.aspx?cp-documentid=7126112 |title=Le Liban ach\u00e8te 71 blind\u00e9s \u00e0 la Belgique, dont 43 chars Leopard |date=December 31, 2007 |publisher=MSN Actualit\u00e9s |language=French |accessdate=2008-12-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205122951/http://news.fr.be.msn.com/politique/article.aspx?cp-documentid=7126112 |archivedate=December 5, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe purchased ex-Belgian APCs include 16 [[AIFV]]-B-C25s and 12 [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M113]] armoured ambulances.\n\n=== Turkey ===\nThe [[Turkish Army]] upgraded its Leopard 1 tanks to a version called the '''Leopard 1T 'Volkan''''.

[[West Germany]] that first entered service in 1965. Developed in an era when [[HEAT]] warheads were thought to make conventional heavy armour of limited value, the Leopard focused on firepower in the form of the German-built version of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Ordnance L7|L7]] 105-mm gun, and improved cross-country performance that was unmatched by other designs of the era.\n\nThe design started as a collaborative project during the 1950s between [[West Germany]] and [[France]], and later joined by [[Italy]],<ref name=TGelbart109>{{cite book |last=Gelbart |first=Marsh |title=Tanks main battle and light tanks |year=1996 |publisher=Brassey\u2019s UK Ltd |pages=109\u2013110 |isbn=1-85753-168-X}}</ref> but the partnership ended shortly after and the final design was ordered by the [[Bundeswehr]], with full-scale production starting in 1965. In total, 6,485 Leopard tanks have been built, of which 4,744 were battle tanks and 1,741 were utility and anti-aircraft variants, not including 80 prototypes and pre-series vehicles.\n\nThe Leopard quickly became a standard of European forces, and eventually served as the [[main battle tank]] in over a dozen countries worldwide, with West Germany, Italy and the Netherlands being the largest operators until their retirement. Since 1990, the Leopard 1 has gradually been relegated to secondary roles in most armies. In the [[German Army]], the Leopard 1 was completely phased out in 2003 by the [[Leopard 2]], while Leopard 1-based vehicles are still widely used in utility roles. The Leopard 2 has replaced the Leopard 1 in service with many other nations as well, with derived vehicles using the Leopard 1 hull still seeing service. Currently, the largest operators are [[Greece]], with 520 vehicles, [[Turkey]], with 397 vehicles and [[Brazil]] with 378 vehicles. Most of these vehicles have been upgraded with various improvements to armour, firepower and sensors to maintain their ability to engage modern threats.\n\n== Development history ==\n=== Leopard 1 ===\n[[File:Leopard 1 Schnittmodell.jpg|thumb|left|Leopard 1 prototype]]The Leopard project started in November 1956 in order to develop a modern tank, the ''Standard-Panzer'', to replace the Bundeswehr's American-built [[M47 Patton|M47]] and [[M48 Patton]] tanks, which, though just delivered to West Germany's recently reconstituted army, were rapidly becoming outdated. On 25 July 1957, the detailed specifications were released; the new design needed to weigh no more than 30 tonnes, have a power-to-weight ratio of 30 horsepower per tonne, be able to withstand hits by 20&nbsp;mm rapid-fire guns on every side as well as to operate in a battlefield contaminated with [[chemical weapons]] or radioactive [[nuclear fallout|fallout]], the then-standard baseline for combat with the [[Warsaw Pact]]. In addition, the main armament had to consist of a 105&nbsp;mm caliber weapon (the new British L7A3 105&nbsp;mm gun was selected), carrying at least as many rounds as current US tank designs. Mobility had priority, while firepower came second; armour was seen as less essential, as it was believed that no real protection against [[hollow charge]] weapons was possible anyway.\n\nFrance was very interested in the design as its own [[AMX 50]] project had just failed. In June 1957, [[West Germany]] and the [[French Fourth Republic]] signed an agreement to develop a common tank, designated in German ''Europa-Panzer''. Three German (''Arbeitsgruppe'' A, B and C) and one French design team would be included in a competition, with each team producing two prototypes. In September 1958, [[Italian Army|Italy]] joined the development program. Several prototypes were entered for testing in 1960. Among the prototypes were [[Porsche]]'s ''Model 734'' from team A, sporting a cast turret, and that of team B ([[Rheinmetall]]), whose cast turret was somewhat higher. Team C from ''Borgward'', designing a very futuristic tank, failed to have a prototype ready in time.\n\nEven before these first prototypes were finished, it had (in 1959) been decided that a second phase with improved designs would be started: Team A had to build 26 phase II prototypes for testing, team B six. Only two tanks of the required six would actually be constructed by team B.\n\nThe Porsche Prototype II was eventually selected as the winner of the contest in 1963; this did not come as a surprise: it had already been decided in 1961 to build a pre-series of 50 vehicles based on this design; production of these was started that very year. This \"0-series\" was modified with a new cast turret and several hull changes to raise the rear deck to provide more room in the engine compartment and move some of the radiators to the upper sides of the hull. Before mass production of the standard version started, it was also decided to add an optical range-finding system for better long-range gunnery, which required the turret to be somewhat taller, and added \"bumps\" on either side of the turret to mount the optics for [[triangulation]]. Germany dropped France from the joint program after France repeatedly missed deadlines for its contribution to the program.<ref name=\"France dropped\">{{cite news |last1=Wilcke |first1=Gerd |title=Bonn to Build Own Tanks Despite Pact With France; Approval Is Sought |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1963/02/18/archives/bonn-to-build-own-tanks-despite-pact-with-france-approval-is-sought.html |accessdate=19 August 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=17 February 1963 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819083105/https://www.nytimes.com/1963/02/18/archives/bonn-to-build-own-tanks-despite-pact-with-france-approval-is-sought.html |archive-date=19 August 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> In February 1963 Defence Minister [[Kai-Uwe von Hassel]] announced he would soon ask the defense committee in Parliament to approve production of the tank.

The Leopard was soon being purchased from Germany by a number of [[NATO]] members and other allies, including (in chronological order) [[Belgium]] (1968), the [[Netherlands]] (1969), [[Norway]] (1970), [[Italy]] (1971), [[Denmark]] (1976), [[Australia]] (1976), [[Canada]] (1978), [[Turkey]] (1980) and [[Greece]] (1981). It is also key to note that Germany has a strict export-policy for their military equipment. [[Greece]], [[Spain]] and [[Chile]], while still under dictatorships, purchased the French [[AMX-30]] instead.\n\n=== Leopard 1A1 ===\n[[File:Leopard1 Bundeswehr 1983.jpg|thumb|right|[[German Army]] Leopard 1A1]]\n[[File:2 norwegian Leopard tanks in the snow.jpg|thumb|right|[[Norwegian Army]] Leopard 1A1]]\n\nAfter the first batch was delivered, the next three batches were the ''Leopard 1A1'' model, which included a new gun stabilization system from [[Cadillac Gage]] that allowed the tank to fire effectively on the move. The 1A1 also added the now-famous \"skirts\" along the sides to protect the upper tracks, and a new [[Thermal sleeve|thermal jacket]] on the gun barrel to control heating. A less important change was to use rectangular rubber blocks fastened to the treads with a single pin instead of the earlier two-pin \"shaped\" versions. The rubber blocks could be easily replaced with metal X-shaped crampons for movement on [[ice]] and snow in the winter.\n\nBetween 1974 and 1977, all of the machines in the first four batches were brought to the same ''Leopard 1A1A1'' standard, and given additional turret armour developed by [[Blohm & Voss]]. A further upgrade in the 1980s added leftover image-intensifier night sights, which were being handed down from the Leopard 2 as they were themselves upgraded. The PZB 200 [[image intensification]] system was mounted in a large box on the upper right of the gun, creating the ''Leopard 1A1A2''. A further upgrade with SEM80/90 all-digital radios created the ''Leopard 1A1A3''. Later improvements to the image intensifier created the ''Leopard 1A1A4''.\n\n=== Leopard 1A2 ===\n[[File:Leopard Tiefwaten.jpg|thumb|left|Leopard 1A2 crossing a river at night.]]\n\nThe first 232 tanks of the fifth production batch were delivered as the ''Leopard 1A2'' between 1972 and 1974. The A2 included a heavier and better armoured turret, and therefore did not receive the B&V armour add-ons as did the earlier machines. However, they did receive the other upgrades; the ''Leopard 1A2A1'' received the PZB 200, the ''Leopard 1A2A2'' received digital radios, and the ''Leopard 1A2A3'' got both.\n\n=== Leopard 1A3 ===\nThe next 110 vehicles in the fifth batch were fitted with a new welded turret, which was equipped with a new armour consisting of two spaced steel plates with a plastic filling between them (''high-hardness armour''{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}), and a wedge-shaped gun mantlet, creating the ''Leopard 1A3''. Although the level of armour area density was equivalent to the A2's new welded version, the internal volume was increased by 1.2 m\u00b3 and the effective protection level was increased by half. The improved TRP 2A independent sight was installed for the commander. Upgrades were identical to the 1A2 models, the ''Leopard 1A3A1'' with the night sights, ''Leopard 1A3A2'' with the new radios, and the ''Leopard 1A3A3'' with both.\n\n=== Leopard 1A4 ===\nThe ''Leopard 1A4'' formed the sixth batch of 250 vehicles, delivery starting in 1974. The 1A4 was externally similar to the 1A3, but included a new computerized [[fire control system]] and the new EMES 12A1 sighting system to aim it. In addition, the commander was provided with his own independent night sighting system, the PERI R12. The new equipment used up space and the ammunition load was reduced to 55 rounds, of which 42 were stored in the magazine to the left of the driver.\n\n=== Leopard 1A5 ===\n[[File:Brazilian Leopard 1 tank.jpg|thumb|[[Brazilian Army]] Leopard 1A5 BR tank.]]\nIn 1980, a research program was undertaken to study further improvements to the Leopard 1, providing it with a completely modern fire control system and fully effective night/bad-weather vision system. The decision was made to base the upgrades on the earlier models, which were no longer competitive.\n\nThe resulting ''Leopard 1A5'' was based on 1,225 vehicles of the Leopard 1A1A1 model. The turrets were again modified for the 1A5, both in order to store all of the new equipment, as well as to move more of the ammunition into the rear of the turret, as opposed to the left side of the driver where it had previously been stored. The new turret was also able to mount the newer 120&nbsp;mm gun from the Leopard 2 if desired, although this option has not been used.\n\nAfter trials, the Krupp-[[Atlas Elektronik]] EMES 18 fire control system, which was developed from the [[EMES 15]] used on the Leopard 2, was selected in December 1983. The EMES 18 included two new sights on the top of the turret, and no longer required the \"bumps\" as did the earlier optical systems. A crucial part of the upgrade was the introduction of more effective ammunition, including new [[Kinetic energy penetrator|APFSDS]] rounds.\n\nThe Leopard tank could also be fitted with bolt-on lexan armour panels, which have increased the effectiveness of the armour. These \"modified\" tanks have proved themselves in the field.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nThe first modified vehicle was delivered in early 1987. Since then, almost all users of the Leopard 1 have also applied similar changes to their own vehicles, and in most ways the 1A5 be considered the \"standard\" Leopard 1 today.\n\nIn the Netherlands, an improved version equivalent to the A5 called \"Leopard 1 Verbeterd\" (improved) was developed, the same version is used by the [[Chilean Army]].\n\n=== Leopard 1A6 ===\nThe ''Leopard 1A6'' prototype was a single Leopard 1 A1A1 testbed, modified with additional armour on the turret and equipped with a 120&nbsp;mm L/44 gun. The project was ended in 1987, as the Leopard 2 was in widespread service at this point and the 1A5 offered a more reasonable upgrade path for a fraction of the cost.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n=== Modified and derivative vehicles {{anchor|Beaver}} ===\n\n[[File:Dachs - 4.jpg|thumb|Armoured engineering vehicle \"Dachs\" (Badger) German Army.]]\n[[File:Bergepanzer2.jpg|thumb|Bergepanzer 2 (Armoured recovery vehicle) GE Army.]]\n[[File:Panzerschnellbruecke Biber auf Brueckenleger.jpg|thumb|Bridgelayer \"Biber\" (Beaver) with armoured vehicle-launched bridge.]]\n\nSimultaneous to the production of the battle tanks, a number of engineering, bridging and recovery vehicles were developed, as well as a number of versions used in the [[anti-aircraft]] role.\n\nThe most well known Leopard variants are the Bridgelayer \"Biber\" ('''Beaver'''), \"Bergepanzer 2\" armoured recovery vehicle, \"Pionierpanzer 2 Dachs\" (''Badger'') armoured engineer vehicle and the \"[[Flugabwehrkanonenpanzer Gepard|Gepard]]\" self-propelled anti-aircraft gun. The [[Warsaw Pact]] equivalent of the Gepard is the [[ZSU-23-4]]. [[Marconi Electronic Systems]] once offered conversions to the [[Marksman anti-aircraft system|Marksman]] [[Self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon|SPAAG]] for existing users of the Leopard 1; the Leopard 1 chassis would be used to carry the Marksman turret.\n\nThe [[Canadian Army]] operates the Beaver [[Armoured vehicle-launched bridge]], Taurus [[Armoured recovery vehicle|ARV]], and Badger [[Armoured engineering vehicle|AEV]], all based on the Leopard 1.\n\nThe United Kingdom's [[Royal Marines]] operate a vehicle known as the [[Beach armoured recovery vehicle#Hippo BRV|Hippo]] [[beach armoured recovery vehicle]]. The Hippo is a conversion of a Leopard 1A5 chassis by [[Alvis Vickers|ALVIS Moelv]]. The main alteration has been the replacement of the turret with a raised superstructure that resembles the wheelhouse of a boat. The original 830&nbsp;hp (634&nbsp;kW) diesel engine has been retained, but the gearing of the transmission had been lowered, reducing the vehicle's road speed to 32&nbsp;km/h (20&nbsp;mph), but increasing [[tractive effort]] to 250&nbsp;kN (56,000&nbsp;lbf). Other modifications include the addition of working platforms, a nosing block, raised air intakes and an [[Auxiliary power unit]]; this has raised the weight of the vehicle from 42.5 tonnes to 50 tonnes. The Hippo has a fording depth of 2.95&nbsp;m (10&nbsp;ft) and can pull vehicles up to 50 tonnes weight or push off from the beach a 240 tonne [[displacement (fluid)|displacement]] [[landing craft]].\n\n=== Gilded Leopard, ''Eber'' and ''Keiler'' ===\nAlmost as soon as the Leopard was introduced into service in 1965, Porsche was awarded a contract to study further improvements to the existing design, while waiting deliveries of the [[MBT-70]] in the mid-1970s. This original ''Gilded Leopard'' (''vergoldeter Leopard'') program expired in 1967 with no production order. In that year, it had already become obvious that the MBT-70 would be a failure. The agreement between the US and the Federal Republic of Germany forbade any national development of an MBT apart from technological experimentation, so a new tank project was begun under the designation of ''Experimentalentwicklung'' or \"experimental development\", two prototypes of which were built.\n\nWhen the MBT-70 program was ended, a further contract was offered under the name ''Boar'' (''Eber''), with an emphasis on using as many technologies from the MBT-70 as possible, but without the problematic XM150 152&nbsp;mm (6.0&nbsp;in) combined gun/[[MGM-51 Shillelagh]] missile launcher. Two prototype vehicles were constructed using a new chassis from Porsche with the road wheels from the MBT-70 and the original Leopard engine, combined with a new Wegmann turret mounting the MBT-70's [[Rheinmetall 120&nbsp;mm Gun|Rheinmetall 120&nbsp;mm smoothbore gun]] (although some also mounted the original 105&nbsp;mm L7). These were considered promising enough that seven more were ordered, this time powered by the MTU engine designed for the MBT-70. When this happened, the ''Experimentalentwicklung'' team went public with their alternative design which they called the ''Keiler'' (a synonym of ''Eber''). In 1971, the minister of defence, [[Helmut Schmidt]], decided to abandon the ''Eber''-project and build 17 prototypes of a Leopard 2, based on the ''Keiler'' design, which had a turret with spaced [[sloped armour]]. The maximum weight was to be 50 tonnes.\n\nDuring the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], 1950s and 1960s generation tanks were badly beaten by [[wire-guided missile]]s, and it was realized that dramatically improved armour protection was needed. The decision was made to allow the tank to increase its weight to the next classification, Military Loading Class 60 (tonnes), and a new design effort was started, with the spaced armour replaced with a much denser perforated armour assemblage. The new design would go on to augment and, after the [[Cold War]], sometimes replace the Leopard in many countries' armies.\n\n== Operational history ==\n=== Australia ===\n[[File:Australian Leopard AS1 tank forest.jpg|thumb|Australian Army Leopard 1A4 (AS1) on exercise.]]\nIn 1974, the Australian government confirmed the purchase of the Leopard, with a total of 101 vehicles being acquired (consisting of 90 MBTs, five Bridgelayers and six Armoured Recovery Vehicles). Two more ARVs were purchased later. The first Leopards subsequently arrived in Australia from Germany in 1976, ending a selection and trial process (against the US [[M60 Patton|M60]]<ref>Hunnicutt, p. 6 & 408</ref> series) that started in 1971 when the army decided it needed a replacement for its British [[Centurion tank|Centurions]], which had served since 1952 and been deployed during the Vietnam war.\n\nIn March 2004, the decision was made to replace the Leopard 1 with reconditioned US [[M1 Abrams|M1A1 Abrams AIM]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.defence.gov.au/dmo/lsd/land907/land907.cfm |title=Australian Defence Force maintains a supportable, survivable and interoperable tank capability until at least 2020 |publisher=Defence.gov.au |accessdate=2015-11-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117032149/http://www.defence.gov.au/dmo/lsd/land907/land907.cfm |archive-date=2015-11-17 |url-status=live }}</ref> The first 18 of 59 M1A1 Abrams arrived in September 2006.

They equipped eight tank regiments, each equipped with 40 Leopards, and the Armour School. The first regiment to receive the Leopard was the 4th Lancers, followed by the 1st Lancers, 2nd Lancers, 3rd Lancers, 8th Lancers, 1st Guides, 2nd Guides and finally the 2nd Mounted Rifles. From 1974, they were modified with a gun stabilisation system and an Automatic firing direction system (AVLS = Automatisch VuurLeidingsSysteem) from SABCA. This system allowed the gun to fire on the move.\n\nIn 1984, the Army Command decided to upgrade 132 Leopard to the A5 standard. At the end of the Cold War, there was a drastic cut in the number of tanks and 128 were sold to Brazil. The upgrade, which started in 1993, was completed in 1997. The upgrade included a new gun firing direction system with thermal imaging, laser rangefinder and a muzzle reference system. At that time, four regiments were still equipped with the Leopard 1A5(BE). At the end of the 1990s, the remaining four regiments amalgamated into two tank regiments, the [[1st/3rd Lancers Regiment|1st/3rd Lancers]] and the [[2nd/4th Lancers Regiment|2nd/4th Lancers]]. In 2010, the 2nd/4th Lancers was disbanded. Around 40 Leopard 1A5(BE) are kept operational in the 1st/3rd Lancers and [[Regiment Carabiniers Prins Boudewijn \u2013 Grenadiers|Carabiniers Prins Boudewijn \u2013 Grenadiers]]. The 1st/3rd Lancers is no longer a tank regiment, but a medium infantry battalion, identical to the rest of the medium infantry battalions of the Belgian Army except for having a single squadron of Leopard 1A5(BE). Belgian Leopards have served in Kosovo and Afghanistan. In 2014, following the government's decision to replace all Land Component tracked vehicles (Leopards, AIFV, and M113) with PIRANHA DF90s,<ref>{{cite web |title=PIRANHA DF90 |url=https://mil.be/fr/materiel/piranha-df90 |website=LA DEFENSE |accessdate=13 July 2019}}</ref> Belgian Leopards were retired from service with most tanks being sold, put on display, or used for target practice.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Verboven |first1=Stijn |title=LE L\u00c9OPARD TIRE SA R\u00c9V\u00c9RENCE |url=https://www.mil.be/fr/article/le-leopard-tire-sa-reverence |website=LA DEFENSE |accessdate=13 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Belgian Army also had the following variants:\n* 36 armoured recovery vehicles (ARV \u2013 TRV)\n* 17 Pionier tanks (armoured engineers)\n* 55 Gepard anti-aircraft tanks (withdrawn from service)\n* 12 driving school tanks\n* 9 Leguan AVLB (armoured vehicle-launched bridge)\n\n=== Canada ===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Land Force Command (Canada)]] -->\n[[File:Leopard C2 Canadian Forces.jpg|thumb|right|Canadian Leopard C2 uparmoured, en route to Afghanistan, October 2006]]\n[[File:Leopard C2 MBT, RMC, CFB Kingston, 1.jpg|thumb|right|Canadian Leopard C2 [[Royal Military College of Canada]]]]\n\nAs a replacement for the [[Centurion Tank]], Canada acquired 127 Leopard C1 tanks (equivalent to Leopard 1A3 with laser rangefinder) in 1978\u201379 for its [[Canadian Forces Land Force Command|Land Forces]], with 114 being put into service. Most of these tanks were stationed in Germany during the Cold War, with a few retained at [[Canadian Forces Base Gagetown]], New Brunswick for training.

They were later upgraded with the same sights and fire-control system as the Leopard C2 (see below).\n\nStarting in 2000, the 114 Leopard C1 tanks in service were upgraded to C2 standard at a cost of [[Canadian dollar|CA$]]139 million. The turrets of 123 surplus Leopard 1A5 tanks purchased from the German Defence Ministry were fitted into the existing hulls (nine turrets were reserved for spare parts and training), and the German tank hulls sold back to the upgrade contractor.

Delivery was completed in 1978. In 1992, Denmark acquired another 110 1A3 tanks (partly through [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe|Conventional Forces Europe]] treaty AFV reduction requirements.) These tanks were upgraded to Leopard 1A5-DK along with the first 120 Leopards, which were not identical to the German 1A5 with welded turrets. Denmark had 230 Leopard 1A5-DKs.\n\nThese Leopards were involved in one of the most important engagements in modern Danish military history. Denmark was the only Scandinavian country to send a significant tank force to support their peacekeeping operations in Croatia and Bosnia. On the 29th of April 1994 near the city of [[Tuzla]] seven Danish Leopard 1A5 tanks was involved in a skirmish between [[UNPROFOR]]s Nordic Battalion (NORDBAT 2) and Bosnian-Serb military forces from the [[\u0160ekovi\u0107i]] brigade. The tanks was sent out to relieve a Swedish-manned observation post that had come under ambush fire by the Bosnian-Serb forces. Upon the tanks arrival at the observation post they were shelled by mortar fire and anti-tank rockets, which led the [[UN]] marked and white-painted Leopard 1A5 tanks to return fire. No casualties were suffered by Swedish observation post nor the Danish tank, however the Serbian casualties is estimated as high as 150 soldiers. This is believed to be the first hostile engagement involving the Leopard 1 tank.<ref>[[Operation B\u00f8llebank]]</ref><ref>Tak for turen!, Lars R.

They are actually Leopard 1A3s, but came with an EMES 12A3 FCS and some other modifications required by the Greek army at that time. During 1992, the Greek army received a batch of 75 Leopard 1A5 as offsets for the construction of 4 MEKO 200 frigates. Some months later, Greece received another batch of 170 Leopard 1V and 2 Leopard 1A5 from the Royal Netherlands army \u2013 the Leopard 1V is actually an 1A1A4 with an EMES 12A3 AFSL-2 FCS. From 1998 until 2000, Greece bought 192 used Leopard 1A5s as offsets for the upgrade of the Greek F-4 aircraft in Germany in a symbolic price. In 2001, the Greek army decided to upgrade 104 Leopard 1A4GR and 120 Leopard 1V to the A5+ version, costing 234 million dollars. However, the programme was cancelled because Greece received a batch of 150 Leopard 1A5s along with the newly built Leopard 2A6 HEL. In 2011, Greece is the largest user of Leopard 1 tanks, having over 500 Leopard 1A5 GR MBTs as well as many ST, Biber and Leguan versions.\n\n=== Italy ===\nItaly had to replace an enormous amount of [[M47 Patton]] (over 2,000 were received by US stocks) but, unlike other NATO members, did not instigate a national project to archive this. Its army, not entirely satisfied by the M60 Patton (300 delivered, of those 200 were produced by OTO-Melara), placed its first order for the Leopard 1 in 1970, with 200 Leopard 1A1 and 69 Bergepanzer 2 delivered between 1971 and 1972. The vehicles replaced the M47 in the [[Italian Army]]'s [[Pozzuolo del Friuli Cavalry Brigade|Cavalry Brigade ''\"Pozzuolo del Friuli\"'']]. A further 600 Leopard 1A2 and 67 Bergepanzer 2 were built in Italy by [[OTO Melara]] with deliveries starting in 1975, with a second batch of 120 build by [[OTO Melara]] between 1980 and 1983. All Italian-built Leopards were A2, but without stabilyzer and skirts; the 200 A1s originally bought from Germany were partially upgraded lately at this standard. Forty Pionierleopard (AEV), nine school (for drivers, without armament) and 64 Biber (AVLB) were ordered in 1985. Twelve of the Pionierleopard were produced in Germany and 28 by OTO Melara in Italy. All of the Biber were assembled by OTO Melara in Italy. At the end, Italy was the biggest costumer of the Leopard outside Germany (920 plus 250 special versions); the only one with a licence production; the only country that produced both M60 and Leopard 1. Lastly, the Leopard was the basis for Italian MBTs and heavy artillery systems, starting with Leone/Lion and the following [[OF-40]], leading to other developments like the Palmaria and OTOMATIC artillery systems (both on OF-40 hull).<ref>Il carro armato Leaopard 1, Storia Militare N.10-2018, Ed. Storia Militare srl, Genova</ref> This experience made possible to develop also the [[C-1 Ariete]], that was born because Italian army decided in 1984 to have a new national tank, instead to buy 300 Leopard 2.<ref>Dossier MBT, ED AI editions, Florence, 1990 p.22</ref>\n\nAt the end of the Cold War, the Italian Army began an upgrade and a downsizing of its armoured units; a number of Leopards were retired in 1991, along with its fleet of M60 tanks. In 1995, Italy bought 120 A5 surplus turrets from the [[Bundeswehr]], which were mounted on the same number of reworked A2 hulls. These tanks took part in the various peacekeeping missions in the [[Balkan]]s, but they never saw action.\n\nThe last A1/A2 was retired in 2003, with the last A5 going in 2008, leaving the [[Ariete]] as the sole tank in Italian service. The AEVs, ARVs, and AVLBs have been reduced in number and some have been modified to work with the Ariete. They are stated to serve for some more years, as no replacement has been selected yet.\n\n=== Lebanon ===\nLebanon and Belgium finalized the transfer of 43 Leopard 1/A5 tanks to the [[Lebanese Armed Forces]] in a deal worth 3.5 million euros, which also includes a number of ex-Belgian APCs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://mplbelgique.wordpress.com/2008/08/27/feu-vert-pour-la-vente-darmes-belges-au-liban/|title=Feu vert pour la vente d'armes belges au Liban|date=August 27, 2008|work=RTL info|publisher=Mouvement pour le Liban|accessdate=2008-12-11|language=French|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227005550/http://mplbelgique.wordpress.com/2008/08/27/feu-vert-pour-la-vente-darmes-belges-au-liban/|archive-date=December 27, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.fr.be.msn.com/politique/article.aspx?cp-documentid=7126112 |title=Le Liban ach\u00e8te 71 blind\u00e9s \u00e0 la Belgique, dont 43 chars Leopard |date=December 31, 2007 |publisher=MSN Actualit\u00e9s |language=French |accessdate=2008-12-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205122951/http://news.fr.be.msn.com/politique/article.aspx?cp-documentid=7126112 |archivedate=December 5, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe purchased ex-Belgian APCs include 16 [[AIFV]]-B-C25s and 12 [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M113]] armoured ambulances.\n\n=== Turkey ===\nThe [[Turkish Army]] upgraded its Leopard 1 tanks to a version called the '''Leopard 1T 'Volkan''''.

It also earned Ocean six [[Grammy Award]] nominations and was credited by some writers for moving the R&B genre in a different, more challenging direction. Considered as Ocean's first commercial release on a traditional record label, ''Channel Orange'' featured unconventional songs that were noted for their storytelling and social commentary, and a dense musical fusion that drew on [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Soul music|soul]], and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]. Funk and electric music also influenced his album. The songs about unrequited love in particular received the most attention, partly because of Ocean's announcement prior to the album's release, when he revealed that his first love was a man. The announcement made global headlines, and some critics compared its cultural impact to when [[David Bowie]] revealed that he was bisexual in 1972.<ref name=\"Johnson\">{{cite news|last=Johnson |first=Andrew |date=December 17, 2012 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/frank-ocean-records-another-first-as-channel-orange-is-named-album-of-the-year-8421123.html |title=Frank Ocean records another first as Channel Orange is named album of the year |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=December 17, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214144802/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/frank-ocean-records-another-first-as-channel-orange-is-named-album-of-the-year-8421123.html |archivedate=December 14, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n[[File:Frank Ocean Coachella 2012 3.jpg|thumb|right|Ocean performing at [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]] in August 2012.]]\n''Channel Orange'' debuted at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and sold 131,000 copies in its first week.<ref name=\"Caulfield2\"/> The majority of its first-week sales were digital copies from iTunes, while approximately 3,000 of the sales were physical copies.<ref name=\"Caulfield2\">{{cite journal|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|date=July 18, 2012|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/481282/zac-brown-band-frank-ocean-debut-at-nos-1-2-on-billboard-200|title=Zac Brown Band, Frank Ocean Debut at Nos. 1 & 2 on Billboard 200|journal=Billboard|accessdate=July 18, 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AfD79dDQ?url=http://m.billboard.com/v/News/ZacBrownBandFrank/?p=0&KSID=ad102a113cf37fe3c8620e8cc7ba2906&ints_viewed=1|archivedate=September 14, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>  On January 30, ''Channel Orange'' was certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).

It also earned Ocean six [[Grammy Award]] nominations and was credited by some writers for moving the R&B genre in a different, more challenging direction. Considered as Ocean's first commercial release on a traditional record label, ''Channel Orange'' featured unconventional songs that were noted for their storytelling and social commentary, and a dense musical fusion that drew on [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Soul music|soul]], and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]. Funk and electric music also influenced his album. The songs about unrequited love in particular received the most attention, partly because of Ocean's announcement prior to the album's release, when he revealed that his first love was a man. The announcement made global headlines, and some critics compared its cultural impact to when [[David Bowie]] revealed that he was bisexual in 1972.<ref name=\"Johnson\">{{cite news|last=Johnson |first=Andrew |date=December 17, 2012 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/frank-ocean-records-another-first-as-channel-orange-is-named-album-of-the-year-8421123.html |title=Frank Ocean records another first as Channel Orange is named album of the year |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=December 17, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214144802/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/frank-ocean-records-another-first-as-channel-orange-is-named-album-of-the-year-8421123.html |archivedate=December 14, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n[[File:Frank Ocean Coachella 2012 3.jpg|thumb|right|Ocean performing at [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]] in August 2012.]]\n''Channel Orange'' debuted at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and sold 131,000 copies in its first week.<ref name=\"Caulfield2\"/> The majority of its first-week sales were digital copies from iTunes, while approximately 3,000 of the sales were physical copies.<ref name=\"Caulfield2\">{{cite journal|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|date=July 18, 2012|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/481282/zac-brown-band-frank-ocean-debut-at-nos-1-2-on-billboard-200|title=Zac Brown Band, Frank Ocean Debut at Nos. 1 & 2 on Billboard 200|journal=Billboard|accessdate=July 18, 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AfD79dDQ?url=http://m.billboard.com/v/News/ZacBrownBandFrank/?p=0&KSID=ad102a113cf37fe3c8620e8cc7ba2906&ints_viewed=1|archivedate=September 14, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>  On January 30, ''Channel Orange'' was certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).
