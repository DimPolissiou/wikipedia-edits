De Brito made a modest fortune in the [[Manila galleon]] trade in the 16th century. He was also a regidor of Manila, whose post was adjudged to him at public auction for one thousand four hundred pesos of common gold, with the third part of what was promised from the increase. He took possession of his post on 24 June 1589.\n\nIn 1589, he acquired at a public auction a sprawling marshland measuring 4940 hectares, a part of which would become the 20th-century Makati. After his acquisition of the land, Capitan de Brito immediately took steps to \"discharge the royal conscience\", to fulfill, for the King of Spain, his duty to spread the Christian gospel. This effort was stymied, however, by local resistance to the forced dispossession of the land.\n\nThe Spaniards then assigned the area to the town of Santa Ana de Sapa and in the 1600s<ref name=\"History of Makati City\">{{cite web |url=http://www.manilainfo.blogspot.com/2010/05/history-of-makati.html|title=History of Makati City |accessdate=October 1, 2013 |publisher=Manila Info Blogspot}}</ref> began to be developed as a pilgrimage center around the churches of [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] (now [[Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Gracia Church|Our Lady of Grace]], opened 1625) and of Saints Peter and Paul (opened 1620) in what is today the ''[[Makati Poblacion|poblaci\u00f3n]]'', built by missionary friars to attract worshippers, and also as a farming community. It became an independent municipality in 1670, and was christened ''San Pedro de Macati'' in honour of the town's [[patron saint|patron]], [[Saint Peter]]. The town was also famous for its pottery industry since the 18th century, with skilled potters trained by [[Jesuit]] priests.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} Its strategic location also made it a pitstop for pilgrims, travelling by foot or boat, towards the shrine of [[Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage]] in [[Antipolo]]. Beginning in the early 19th century, the church has been directly administered by diocesean secular clergy.\n\nIn 1718 the Jesuits brought the Image of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Virgen de la Rosa  from Acapulco Mexico to the small town, it was later enthroned at the [[San Pedro Macati Church]] where it resides to this very day, and will mark its 300th anniversary in June 2018.  Until the Filipino American War, the image had an ivory head and hands and a reliquary on her breast which contained a strand of a hair of the Blessed Virgin Mary, both of them stolen and were never recovered at the same time while the church served as a hospital, and are today replaced by an oval cavity and a wooden head and hands. The city's feast days on June 29, the feast of Apostles Peter and Paul, and June 30, the feast of Our Lady of the Rose are marked with the \"Panatang Sayaw\", as the Bailes de los Arcos (Dance of the Arches) are called, are an old tradition going back at least to the beginnings of the 19th century as a dance to thank the city patrons for blessings received by its people<ref>Old Makati and the Bailes de los Arcos by [[Alejandro Roces]]</ref> and by a number of events organized by city and religious leaders.\n\nIn 1851, Don Jos\u00e9 Bonifacio R\u00f3xas (an ancestor of the [[Z\u00f3bel de Ayala family]]) purchased the [[Jesuit]] estate of \"[[Hacienda]] San Pedro de Macati\" for 52,800 pesos.<ref>{{cite web|title=This week in Ayala history|url=http://www.filipinaslibrary.org.ph/news/55?start=5|work=Filipinas Library|publisher=www.filipinaslibrary.org.ph|accessdate=6 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111161251/http://www.filipinaslibrary.org.ph/news/55?start=5|archive-date=11 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Since then, the development of Makati has remained linked with the [[Z\u00f3bel de Ayala family]] and their company, [[Ayala Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=History - Pioneers|url=http://www.ayala.com.ph/ayalaat175mag/pioneers.html|publisher=Ayala Group Official Website|accessdate=6 September 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060056/http://www.ayala.com.ph/ayalaat175mag/pioneers.html|archivedate=21 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe town was a cradle of Filipino passive resistance against Spanish colonial rule in the 1890s and the subsequent [[Philippine Revolution]], with the participation of the local [[Katipunan]] council based in the area with [[Pio del Pilar]], a local resident from the village of Culi-Culi, as its president.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Culi-Culi is now a barangay named in honour of Del Pilar.\n\n===American period===\nBy 1898, [[Spain]] ceded the Philippines and other overseas possessions to the [[United States]] after the former's defeat in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. In 1901, the Americans declared the whole area south of the Pasig River, including the town of San Pedro de Macati, down to [[Alabang]] in [[Muntinlupa]], a US military reservation, thus establishing [[Fort William McKinley|Fort McKinley]] (now [[Fort Bonifacio]]). That same year, the whole town, with a population of 25,000, was incorporated from the Province of [[Manila (province)|Manila]] to the new province of [[Rizal]], with Marcelino Magsaysay serving as the town president.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} As the 1910s approached, the [[Meralco]] tranvia lines to Fort McKinley and to the western end of the town were built, opening transport lines for its residents and thus brought along potential investors who opened several businesses including the famous Santa Ana Cabaret at the terminus of the streetcar lines.\n\nOn February 28, 1914, the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|Philippine Legislature]] passed Act 2390, shortening the name, San Pedro de Macati, to simply Makati.\n\nIn 1937, the airport [[Nielsen Field]] opened in what is now the [[Ayala Triangle]], the control tower of which still exists and is currently a restaurant.  The tracks of the now [[Philippine National Railways]] reached Makatie early in the decade. During that same period, [[Santa Ana Park]], the nation's second horse racing facility, opened to expectations from horse racing fans.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n===Post-war===\n[[File:Manila December 1982-5.jpg|thumbnail|left|Ayala Avenue (1982).]]\n\nAfter the destruction [[Second World War]] had brought upon Manila, and the subsequent closure of [[Nielson Field]], the town grew rapidly, and real estate values boomed. The first of the planned communities (in what are now the barangays [[Forbes Park, Makati|Forbes Park]], Urdaneta, San Lorenzo and [[Bel-Air Village|Bel-Air]]) were established in the 1950s with the efforts of its landowner, [[Ayala Corporation|Ayala y Compa\u00f1\u00eda]]. At the same time, Fort McKinley, then renamed Fort Bonifacio, and the then [[Philippine Army]] headquarters, became the starting point for the building up of seven more communities by military families who worked in the base area. The first office buildings were built on what is now the [[Makati Central Business District]]. Since the late 1960s, Makati has transformed into the financial and commercial capital of the country.<ref name=\"History of Makati City\"/>\n\nDuring the terms of town mayors M\u00e1ximo Estrella, Rafael Ba\u00f1ola, Jos\u00e9 Luciano, C\u00e9zar Alzona and Nemesio Yabut, massive development of the town took place, and foreign and local investors were welcomed to what was tagged as the nation's number one municipality at the time. Makati's central location adjacent to the city of [[Manila]] also made it an industrial hub for major national and international corporations. Partly as a result a new town hall just miles from the old one was built in 1962 just along [[J.P. Rizal Avenue]] (the old hall was later converted into the city museum). Mayor Ba\u00f1ola's term of office as town executive saw the building up of what is now the [[Ayala Center]] with the help of the Ayala firm, which would become the city's central shopping center of today.\n\nIn 1975, Makati was separated from Rizal province along with [[Caloocan]], [[Malabon]], [[Navotas]], [[Quezon City]], [[Marikina]], [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]], [[Pasig]], [[Mandaluyong]], [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]], [[Taguig]], [[Pasay City]], [[Para\u00f1aque]], [[Las Pi\u00f1as]], and [[Muntinlupa]], to become part of the [[Metro Manila|National Capital Region]] as a component municipality.\n\nFollowing the [[Assassination of Benigno Aquino, Jr.|assassination]] of opposition senator [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] on 21 August 1983, Makati became a nexus for protests against the dictatorship of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]]. Known as the ''Confetti Revolution'', the demonstrations held in the central business district were led partly by employees of major corporations based in the area, culminating in the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]] that toppled Marcos\u2019 20-year authoritarian regime. His political rival and successor, [[Corazon C. Aquino]]\u2013the wife of the deceased senator Aquino\u2013became the eleventh and first female president of the Philippines. After the death of Mayor Yabut during the Revolution, Aquino appointed [[Jejomar Binay]] as acting mayor of the town of Makati; he was subsequently [[1988 Philippine local elections|elected as mayor]] in 1988. His first term as the town executive would see the events of a 1989 [[coup d'etat]] attempt in the town's business district, and would help usher the building of the country's first skyscrapers in the early 1990s and full cityhood in 1995.\n\n[[File:Bonifacio Global City contested between Taguig and Makati.svg|thumb|Maps of Makati and Taguig with disputed land|180px|right]]\nOn May 17, 2000 at 5:02&nbsp;p.m., the [[Glorietta|Glorietta Mall]] located inside the [[Ayala Center]] was bombed, injuring 13 persons.

During its early years, it was among the top three hotels in the country - along with the Manila [[Hilton hotels|Hilton]] in Ermita and the Savoy Hotel (later becoming the [[Hyatt]] Regency) in Pasay City.  It closed in 2015 and the building was demolished shortly thereafter to give way to a new development to be named One Ayala.\n\n===Hagdang Bato===\nThis part of [[Kingdom of Namayan|Namayan]] was sacred to early [[Tagalog people|Tagalogs]].  Hagdang bat\u00f3 (see [https://mbasic.facebook.com/DiscoverOldPhilippines/photos/a.370149673073438.90061.201102429978164/588672527887817/?type=1&source=46&refid=17 photo]) is mentioned in chapter sixty-one of [[Jose Rizal|Jos\u00e9 Rizal]]'s first novel, ''[[Noli Me T\u00e1ngere (novel)|Noli Me T\u00e1ngere]]'', and chapter three of his second novel, ''[[El Filibusterismo]]''. During the [[Philippine Revolution|Revolution]] on 10 June 1897, Gen. [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] and about five hundred soldiers crossed the [[Pasig River]] at Hagdang bat\u00f3 during the march to [[Republic of Biak-na-Bato|Biac-na-bat\u00f3]] in [[Bulacan|Bulac\u00e1n]].\n\n===Rizal Theater===\nThis was the first luxury [[movie theater]] and performance venue in Makati and was located south of the [[Makati Avenue|Makati]] and [[Ayala Avenue|Ayala]] avenues intersection.  It opened in 1960 and was demolished in 1989 to give way to the construction of the [[Makati Shangri-La, Manila|Makati Shangri-la]] hotel (opened in 1993) which presently stands on the site.\n\nIt shared the same name as the Cinematografo Rizal located in [[Manila]], which was the first cinema not owned by foreigners.  This establishment, owned by Jos\u00e9 Jim\u00e9nez, opened as a movie house in 1903 and five years later its address was recorded as 155 [[Recto Avenue|Calle Azc\u00e1rraga]] in [[Tondo, Manila]].  About a decade later its address was Calle Ilaya (now Ilaya Street) and Calle Azc\u00e1rraga in Tondo.\n\n=== Santa Ana Cabaret ===\nThis twentieth-century [[nightclub]] ([http://www.cnac.org/emilscott/canson_chickese01.htm photos]), owned by an American named John Canson, was once advertised as being the largest [[cabaret]] in the world. It opened in Tejeros in 1921 and was in business until 1970, when a [[Typhoon Patsy (1970)|typhoon]] destroyed it. Famous patrons included President [[Manuel Quezon]], [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General]] [[Francis Burton Harrison|Francis Harrison]], and General [[Douglas MacArthur]]. It is also said that [[Edward VIII|Edward]], [[Prince of Wales]] once visited it. During World War II it was converted into a garment factory, producing shirts and military uniforms for the Japanese. After the Americans returned to Makati in February 1945, they converted their famous dance hall into a temporary medical facility. It was the forerunner of fashionable discos of the eighties and nineties, such as Manila's classy Stargazer, as well as Makati's Euphoria, Faces, and Mars.  Its modern counterpart is the Valkyrie Nightclub in Taguig.\n\n===Santa Ana Racetrack===\nOpened in 1937 by the Philippine Racing Club, it was the first notable [[sport venue]] of Makati, and was the forerunner of other famous Makati sport venues where international competitions were held such as the Manila Golf Club, which located in Makati in 1948, the Manila Polo Club, which relocated to Makati in 1950, and the defunct [[QubicaAMF Bowling World Cup|Astrobowl Magallanes]].  It was larger than the San Lazaro Racetrack in [[Santa Cruz, Manila]].\n \nDuring World War II it became a military storage area, and as a consequence was targeted by aerial bombardment toward the end of the war. On 9 February 1945, it was at the Philippine Racing Club grounds that the Americans, advancing from Wack Wack golf club ([http://www.silverlensgalleries.com/artist.php?teodulo-protomartir=155 photo no. 26a]) and crossing the Pasig River using [[amtrac]]s, returned to Makati. Afterward, they built a [[pontoon bridge]] ([http://battlingbastardsbataan.com/james.htm seventh photo]) which was one of two such temporary bridges they had to build after the last remaining bridges spanning the Pasig River\u2014Banzai (Jones) and Santa Cruz (MacArthur)\u2014were blown on 5 February. This pontoon bridge was damaged and knocked out by artillery fire on 10 and 11 February and was reported as having been repaired ([http://www.ww2online.org/image/philippine-refugees-stream-across-pontoon-bridge-spanning-upper-pasig-river-manila-26-february photo]). The Art-deco buildings of the racetrack were later used as a headquarters by US General MacArthur and also by [[Allied Translator and Interpreter Section|Allied translators and interpreters]].\n\nHorse racing resumed during the postcolonial period. Toward the end of the twentieth century, an increase in the taxation of winnings combined with a rise in the ownership of TV sets led to a decline in attendance, which resulted in the closure of the racetrack in December 2008 and its demolition in 2013.\n\n===Santiago Hospital===\nThe Santiago Hospital was a twentieth-century [[Health facility|medical facility]] in Poblaci\u00f3n. Originally named ''Hospital Espa\u00f1ol de Santiago'', it was founded in 1902 in Manila by the Spanish community as an infectious hospital for the hospitalization of Spaniards who, having to comply with sanitary regulations concerning compulsory hospitalization, preferred the services of this hospital rather than those of the public San Lazaro Hospital.  Its earliest known address was 1819 [[List of renamed streets in Metro Manila|Calle Azc\u00e1rraga]], Quiapo. In 1929, the hospital moved into its own building, an Art-deco structure in Makati, and at the beginning of the thirties was one of two hospitals in Rizal Province. By 1935, this medical facility, which had thirty-four beds, was classified as a general hospital which treated all sorts of diseases except those requiring compulsory segregation in government institutions, and by that time was admitting patients of nationalities other than Spanish.\n\nDuring World War II, Santiago Hospital was administered by the [[Sisters of Charity of St. Paul|Sisters of Saint Paul of Chartres]], and in February 1945 it had the distinction of being the only hospital in the Greater Manila area which remained open throughout the [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Battle of Manila]].  Santiago Hospital, which was once considered to be one of the best hospitals in the Philippines, closed in the 1960s as a result of the increasing urbanization of Makati.\n\nAlthough generally believed to be Makati's first hospital, it was preceded by a hospital in Guadalupe which existed during the [[First Philippine Republic|First Republic]].  Also over a decade earlier in 1884, the Spanish briefly operated in Guadalupe an orphanage, a type of institution which in their point of view was a medical facility.  In 1917, the Americans also opened an orphanage in Makati, at Casa Quinta.\n\n==Culture and sports==\n[[File:Ayala Museum.jpg|thumbnail|The [[Ayala Museum]]]]\nMakati is home to a number of fine art museums, colonial-era churches and recreation areas.

The [[Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]] (EDSA) pass along the city's southeast part and connects it with the cities of [[Mandaluyong]] and [[Pasay]]. The [[South Luzon Expressway]] (SLEX) runs through the city's western part and connects it with the city of [[Manila]] to the north and with southern Metro Manila. The [[Manila Skyway]], an elevated highway built on top of SLEX, provides residents coming from southern Metro Manila a fast way to reach Makati.

De Brito made a modest fortune in the [[Manila galleon]] trade in the 16th century. He was also a regidor of Manila, whose post was adjudged to him at public auction for one thousand four hundred pesos of common gold, with the third part of what was promised from the increase. He took possession of his post on 24 June 1589.\n\nIn 1589, he acquired at a public auction a sprawling marshland measuring 4940 hectares, a part of which would become the 20th-century Makati. After his acquisition of the land, Capitan de Brito immediately took steps to \"discharge the royal conscience\", to fulfill, for the King of Spain, his duty to spread the Christian gospel. This effort was stymied, however, by local resistance to the forced dispossession of the land.\n\nThe Spaniards then assigned the area to the town of Santa Ana de Sapa and in the 1600s<ref name=\"History of Makati City\">{{cite web |url=http://www.manilainfo.blogspot.com/2010/05/history-of-makati.html|title=History of Makati City |accessdate=October 1, 2013 |publisher=Manila Info Blogspot}}</ref> began to be developed as a pilgrimage center around the churches of [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] (now [[Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Gracia Church|Our Lady of Grace]], opened 1625) and of Saints Peter and Paul (opened 1620) in what is today the ''[[Makati Poblacion|poblaci\u00f3n]]'', built by missionary friars to attract worshippers, and also as a farming community. It became an independent municipality in 1670, and was christened ''San Pedro de Macati'' in honour of the town's [[patron saint|patron]], [[Saint Peter]]. The town was also famous for its pottery industry since the 18th century, with skilled potters trained by [[Jesuit]] priests.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} Its strategic location also made it a pitstop for pilgrims, travelling by foot or boat, towards the shrine of [[Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage]] in [[Antipolo]]. Beginning in the early 19th century, the church has been directly administered by diocesean secular clergy.\n\nIn 1718 the Jesuits brought the Image of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Virgen de la Rosa  from Acapulco Mexico to the small town, it was later enthroned at the [[San Pedro Macati Church]] where it resides to this very day, and will mark its 300th anniversary in June 2018.  Until the Filipino American War, the image had an ivory head and hands and a reliquary on her breast which contained a strand of a hair of the Blessed Virgin Mary, both of them stolen and were never recovered at the same time while the church served as a hospital, and are today replaced by an oval cavity and a wooden head and hands. The city's feast days on June 29, the feast of Apostles Peter and Paul, and June 30, the feast of Our Lady of the Rose are marked with the \"Panatang Sayaw\", as the Bailes de los Arcos (Dance of the Arches) are called, are an old tradition going back at least to the beginnings of the 19th century as a dance to thank the city patrons for blessings received by its people<ref>Old Makati and the Bailes de los Arcos by [[Alejandro Roces]]</ref> and by a number of events organized by city and religious leaders.\n\nIn 1851, Don Jos\u00e9 Bonifacio R\u00f3xas (an ancestor of the [[Z\u00f3bel de Ayala family]]) purchased the [[Jesuit]] estate of \"[[Hacienda]] San Pedro de Macati\" for 52,800 pesos.<ref>{{cite web|title=This week in Ayala history|url=http://www.filipinaslibrary.org.ph/news/55?start=5|work=Filipinas Library|publisher=www.filipinaslibrary.org.ph|accessdate=6 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111161251/http://www.filipinaslibrary.org.ph/news/55?start=5|archive-date=11 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Since then, the development of Makati has remained linked with the [[Z\u00f3bel de Ayala family]] and their company, [[Ayala Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=History - Pioneers|url=http://www.ayala.com.ph/ayalaat175mag/pioneers.html|publisher=Ayala Group Official Website|accessdate=6 September 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060056/http://www.ayala.com.ph/ayalaat175mag/pioneers.html|archivedate=21 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe town was a cradle of Filipino passive resistance against Spanish colonial rule in the 1890s and the subsequent [[Philippine Revolution]], with the participation of the local [[Katipunan]] council based in the area with [[Pio del Pilar]], a local resident from the village of Culi-Culi, as its president.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Culi-Culi is now a barangay named in honour of Del Pilar.\n\n===American period===\nBy 1898, [[Spain]] ceded the Philippines and other overseas possessions to the [[United States]] after the former's defeat in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. In 1901, the Americans declared the whole area south of the Pasig River, including the town of San Pedro de Macati, down to [[Alabang]] in [[Muntinlupa]], a US military reservation, thus establishing [[Fort William McKinley|Fort McKinley]] (now [[Fort Bonifacio]]). That same year, the whole town, with a population of 25,000, was incorporated from the Province of [[Manila (province)|Manila]] to the new province of [[Rizal]], with Marcelino Magsaysay serving as the town president.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} As the 1910s approached, the [[Meralco]] tranvia lines to Fort McKinley and to the western end of the town were built, opening transport lines for its residents and thus brought along potential investors who opened several businesses including the famous Santa Ana Cabaret at the terminus of the streetcar lines.\n\nOn February 28, 1914, the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|Philippine Legislature]] passed Act 2390, shortening the name, San Pedro de Macati, to simply Makati.\n\nIn 1937, the airport [[Nielsen Field]] opened in what is now the [[Ayala Triangle]], the control tower of which still exists and is currently a restaurant.  The tracks of the now [[Philippine National Railways]] reached Makatie early in the decade. During that same period, [[Santa Ana Park]], the nation's second horse racing facility, opened to expectations from horse racing fans.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n===Post-war===\n[[File:Manila December 1982-5.jpg|thumbnail|left|Ayala Avenue (1982).]]\n\nAfter the destruction [[Second World War]] had brought upon Manila, and the subsequent closure of [[Nielson Field]], the town grew rapidly, and real estate values boomed. The first of the planned communities (in what are now the barangays [[Forbes Park, Makati|Forbes Park]], Urdaneta, San Lorenzo and [[Bel-Air Village|Bel-Air]]) were established in the 1950s with the efforts of its landowner, [[Ayala Corporation|Ayala y Compa\u00f1\u00eda]]. At the same time, Fort McKinley, then renamed Fort Bonifacio, and the then [[Philippine Army]] headquarters, became the starting point for the building up of seven more communities by military families who worked in the base area. The first office buildings were built on what is now the [[Makati Central Business District]]. Since the late 1960s, Makati has transformed into the financial and commercial capital of the country.<ref name=\"History of Makati City\"/>\n\nDuring the terms of town mayors M\u00e1ximo Estrella, Rafael Ba\u00f1ola, Jos\u00e9 Luciano, C\u00e9zar Alzona and Nemesio Yabut, massive development of the town took place, and foreign and local investors were welcomed to what was tagged as the nation's number one municipality at the time. Makati's central location adjacent to the city of [[Manila]] also made it an industrial hub for major national and international corporations. Partly as a result a new town hall just miles from the old one was built in 1962 just along [[J.P. Rizal Avenue]] (the old hall was later converted into the city museum). Mayor Ba\u00f1ola's term of office as town executive saw the building up of what is now the [[Ayala Center]] with the help of the Ayala firm, which would become the city's central shopping center of today.\n\nIn 1975, Makati was separated from Rizal province along with [[Caloocan]], [[Malabon]], [[Navotas]], [[Quezon City]], [[Marikina]], [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]], [[Pasig]], [[Mandaluyong]], [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]], [[Taguig]], [[Pasay City]], [[Para\u00f1aque]], [[Las Pi\u00f1as]], and [[Muntinlupa]], to become part of the [[Metro Manila|National Capital Region]] as a component municipality.\n\nFollowing the [[Assassination of Benigno Aquino, Jr.|assassination]] of opposition senator [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] on 21 August 1983, Makati became a nexus for protests against the dictatorship of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]]. Known as the ''Confetti Revolution'', the demonstrations held in the central business district were led partly by employees of major corporations based in the area, culminating in the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]] that toppled Marcos\u2019 20-year authoritarian regime. His political rival and successor, [[Corazon C. Aquino]]\u2013the wife of the deceased senator Aquino\u2013became the eleventh and first female president of the Philippines. After the death of Mayor Yabut during the Revolution, Aquino appointed [[Jejomar Binay]] as acting mayor of the town of Makati; he was subsequently [[1988 Philippine local elections|elected as mayor]] in 1988. His first term as the town executive would see the events of a 1989 [[coup d'etat]] attempt in the town's business district, and would help usher the building of the country's first skyscrapers in the early 1990s and full cityhood in 1995.\n\n[[File:Bonifacio Global City contested between Taguig and Makati.svg|thumb|Maps of Makati and Taguig with disputed land|180px|right]]\nOn May 17, 2000 at 5:02&nbsp;p.m., the [[Glorietta|Glorietta Mall]] located inside the [[Ayala Center]] was bombed, injuring 13 persons.

During its early years, it was among the top three hotels in the country - along with the Manila [[Hilton hotels|Hilton]] in Ermita and the Savoy Hotel (later becoming the [[Hyatt]] Regency) in Pasay City.  It closed in 2015 and the building was demolished shortly thereafter to give way to a new development to be named One Ayala.\n\n===Hagdang Bato===\nThis part of [[Kingdom of Namayan|Namayan]] was sacred to early [[Tagalog people|Tagalogs]].  Hagdang bat\u00f3 (see [https://mbasic.facebook.com/DiscoverOldPhilippines/photos/a.370149673073438.90061.201102429978164/588672527887817/?type=1&source=46&refid=17 photo]) is mentioned in chapter sixty-one of [[Jose Rizal|Jos\u00e9 Rizal]]'s first novel, ''[[Noli Me T\u00e1ngere (novel)|Noli Me T\u00e1ngere]]'', and chapter three of his second novel, ''[[El Filibusterismo]]''. During the [[Philippine Revolution|Revolution]] on 10 June 1897, Gen. [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] and about five hundred soldiers crossed the [[Pasig River]] at Hagdang bat\u00f3 during the march to [[Republic of Biak-na-Bato|Biac-na-bat\u00f3]] in [[Bulacan|Bulac\u00e1n]].\n\n===Rizal Theater===\nThis was the first luxury [[movie theater]] and performance venue in Makati and was located south of the [[Makati Avenue|Makati]] and [[Ayala Avenue|Ayala]] avenues intersection.  It opened in 1960 and was demolished in 1989 to give way to the construction of the [[Makati Shangri-La, Manila|Makati Shangri-la]] hotel (opened in 1993) which presently stands on the site.\n\nIt shared the same name as the Cinematografo Rizal located in [[Manila]], which was the first cinema not owned by foreigners.  This establishment, owned by Jos\u00e9 Jim\u00e9nez, opened as a movie house in 1903 and five years later its address was recorded as 155 [[Recto Avenue|Calle Azc\u00e1rraga]] in [[Tondo, Manila]].  About a decade later its address was Calle Ilaya (now Ilaya Street) and Calle Azc\u00e1rraga in Tondo.\n\n=== Santa Ana Cabaret ===\nThis twentieth-century [[nightclub]] ([http://www.cnac.org/emilscott/canson_chickese01.htm photos]), owned by an American named John Canson, was once advertised as being the largest [[cabaret]] in the world. It opened in Tejeros in 1921 and was in business until 1970, when a [[Typhoon Patsy (1970)|typhoon]] destroyed it. Famous patrons included President [[Manuel Quezon]], [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General]] [[Francis Burton Harrison|Francis Harrison]], and General [[Douglas MacArthur]]. It is also said that [[Edward VIII|Edward]], [[Prince of Wales]] once visited it. During World War II it was converted into a garment factory, producing shirts and military uniforms for the Japanese. After the Americans returned to Makati in February 1945, they converted their famous dance hall into a temporary medical facility. It was the forerunner of fashionable discos of the eighties and nineties, such as Manila's classy Stargazer, as well as Makati's Euphoria, Faces, and Mars.  Its modern counterpart is the Valkyrie Nightclub in Taguig.\n\n===Santa Ana Racetrack===\nOpened in 1937 by the Philippine Racing Club, it was the first notable [[sport venue]] of Makati, and was the forerunner of other famous Makati sport venues where international competitions were held such as the Manila Golf Club, which located in Makati in 1948, the Manila Polo Club, which relocated to Makati in 1950, and the defunct [[QubicaAMF Bowling World Cup|Astrobowl Magallanes]].  It was larger than the San Lazaro Racetrack in [[Santa Cruz, Manila]].\n \nDuring World War II it became a military storage area, and as a consequence was targeted by aerial bombardment toward the end of the war. On 9 February 1945, it was at the Philippine Racing Club grounds that the Americans, advancing from Wack Wack golf club ([http://www.silverlensgalleries.com/artist.php?teodulo-protomartir=155 photo no. 26a]) and crossing the Pasig River using [[amtrac]]s, returned to Makati. Afterward, they built a [[pontoon bridge]] ([http://battlingbastardsbataan.com/james.htm seventh photo]) which was one of two such temporary bridges they had to build after the last remaining bridges spanning the Pasig River\u2014Banzai (Jones) and Santa Cruz (MacArthur)\u2014were blown on 5 February. This pontoon bridge was damaged and knocked out by artillery fire on 10 and 11 February and was reported as having been repaired ([http://www.ww2online.org/image/philippine-refugees-stream-across-pontoon-bridge-spanning-upper-pasig-river-manila-26-february photo]). The Art-deco buildings of the racetrack were later used as a headquarters by US General MacArthur and also by [[Allied Translator and Interpreter Section|Allied translators and interpreters]].\n\nHorse racing resumed during the postcolonial period. Toward the end of the twentieth century, an increase in the taxation of winnings combined with a rise in the ownership of TV sets led to a decline in attendance, which resulted in the closure of the racetrack in December 2008 and its demolition in 2013.\n\n===Santiago Hospital===\nThe Santiago Hospital was a twentieth-century [[Health facility|medical facility]] in Poblaci\u00f3n. Originally named ''Hospital Espa\u00f1ol de Santiago'', it was founded in 1902 in Manila by the Spanish community as an infectious hospital for the hospitalization of Spaniards who, having to comply with sanitary regulations concerning compulsory hospitalization, preferred the services of this hospital rather than those of the public San Lazaro Hospital.  Its earliest known address was 1819 [[List of renamed streets in Metro Manila|Calle Azc\u00e1rraga]], Quiapo. In 1929, the hospital moved into its own building, an Art-deco structure in Makati, and at the beginning of the thirties was one of two hospitals in Rizal Province. By 1935, this medical facility, which had thirty-four beds, was classified as a general hospital which treated all sorts of diseases except those requiring compulsory segregation in government institutions, and by that time was admitting patients of nationalities other than Spanish.\n\nDuring World War II, Santiago Hospital was administered by the [[Sisters of Charity of St. Paul|Sisters of Saint Paul of Chartres]], and in February 1945 it had the distinction of being the only hospital in the Greater Manila area which remained open throughout the [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Battle of Manila]].  Santiago Hospital, which was once considered to be one of the best hospitals in the Philippines, closed in the 1960s as a result of the increasing urbanization of Makati.\n\nAlthough generally believed to be Makati's first hospital, it was preceded by a hospital in Guadalupe which existed during the [[First Philippine Republic|First Republic]].  Also over a decade earlier in 1884, the Spanish briefly operated in Guadalupe an orphanage, a type of institution which in their point of view was a medical facility.  In 1917, the Americans also opened an orphanage in Makati, at Casa Quinta.\n\n==Culture and sports==\n[[File:Ayala Museum.jpg|thumbnail|The [[Ayala Museum]]]]\nMakati is home to a number of fine art museums, colonial-era churches and recreation areas.

She was not active in the women's movement until 1963, when she had her first abortion after separating from her first husband, who was the father of her four children. She was inspired after watching a protest on the television held at the University of California, Los Angeles, about the lack of birth control services offered on the campus. After going through her experience with the painful abortion, in the early 1970s Downer began her quest to making abortions safer for other women. She joined the LA Chapter of NOW's Abortion Committee where she met Harvey Karman. Mr. Karman was unlicensed in the medical field, and was the one responsible for educating Downer on safe abortion procedures by using suction to remove the fetus rather than scraping the uterus. Shortly after, Downer introduced menstrual extraction to other activists.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.scpr.org/programs/offramp/2017/04/14/56179/the-secret-home-abortion-movement-started-in-la-tw/|title=The secret home abortion movement that started in LA two years before Roe v.

She became active in the [[women's liberation movement]] in 1969, and she worked to try to make abortion available in [[Los Angeles, California]] under the liberalized [[abortion law]]. Downer began her work in the [[Women's health movement in the United States|women's health movement]] on the Abortion Task Force of [[National Organization for Women|NOW]] with Lana Clarke Phelan, author of ''The Abortion Handbook'', who became her mentor. Downer and other women observed abortion procedures at [[Harvey Karman]]'s illegal abortion clinic on [[Santa Monica Boulevard]] in [[West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California|West Los Angeles]] to learn how to perform abortions themselves. While there, she took a vaginal speculum and figured out how to do a vaginal self-examination. After Downer and others formed the Los Angeles Abortion Task Force, they called a meeting on April 7, 1971 at a feminist book store to educate women about abortion and their bodies. Downer demonstrated the vaginal self-examination to the estimated two dozen women who attended.<ref name=\"articles.latimes.com\">Woo, Elain.

This provided women with a less traumatic abortion option than the use of a metal tool to scrape the inside of the uterus, which was predominately used at the time.<ref name=\"articles.latimes.com\"/> Downer and Rothman travelled across the country and many Self-Help Clinics were formed.<ref>Davis, Flora.

The menstrual extraction and vaginal self examinations that Downer pioneered with her team provided women with the means to learn about their bodies and take control of their reproduction. [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] described Downer and Rothman's efforts as \"legitimizing the notion that we have the right to know and decide about procedures...that affect our bodies and our lives.\"<ref name=\"articles.latimes.com\"/>  In 1972 she also gave a notable speech to the American Psychological Association on September 5, 1972, in Hawaii, entitled \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20150923212048/http://www.cwluherstory.org/covert-sex-discrimination-against-women-as-medical-patients.html Covert Sex Discrimination Against Women as Medical Patients].\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://scriptorium.lib.duke.edu/wlm/covert/ |title = Covert Sex Discrimination Against Women as Medical Patients}}</ref>\n\nShe and Rothman were leaders of a group that founded the Feminist Women's Health Center in Los Angeles in 1971.

She was not active in the women's movement until 1963, when she had her first abortion after separating from her first husband, who was the father of her four children. She was inspired after watching a protest on the television held at the University of California, Los Angeles, about the lack of birth control services offered on the campus. After going through her experience with the painful abortion, in the early 1970s Downer began her quest to making abortions safer for other women. She joined the LA Chapter of NOW's Abortion Committee where she met Harvey Karman. Mr. Karman was unlicensed in the medical field, and was the one responsible for educating Downer on safe abortion procedures by using suction to remove the fetus rather than scraping the uterus. Shortly after, Downer introduced menstrual extraction to other activists.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.scpr.org/programs/offramp/2017/04/14/56179/the-secret-home-abortion-movement-started-in-la-tw/|title=The secret home abortion movement that started in LA two years before Roe v.

She became active in the [[women's liberation movement]] in 1969, and she worked to try to make abortion available in [[Los Angeles, California]] under the liberalized [[abortion law]]. Downer began her work in the [[Women's health movement in the United States|women's health movement]] on the Abortion Task Force of [[National Organization for Women|NOW]] with Lana Clarke Phelan, author of ''The Abortion Handbook'', who became her mentor. Downer and other women observed abortion procedures at [[Harvey Karman]]'s illegal abortion clinic on [[Santa Monica Boulevard]] in [[West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California|West Los Angeles]] to learn how to perform abortions themselves. While there, she took a vaginal speculum and figured out how to do a vaginal self-examination. After Downer and others formed the Los Angeles Abortion Task Force, they called a meeting on April 7, 1971 at a feminist book store to educate women about abortion and their bodies. Downer demonstrated the vaginal self-examination to the estimated two dozen women who attended.<ref name=\"articles.latimes.com\">Woo, Elain.

This provided women with a less traumatic abortion option than the use of a metal tool to scrape the inside of the uterus, which was predominately used at the time.<ref name=\"articles.latimes.com\"/> Downer and Rothman travelled across the country and many Self-Help Clinics were formed.<ref>Davis, Flora.

The menstrual extraction and vaginal self examinations that Downer pioneered with her team provided women with the means to learn about their bodies and take control of their reproduction. [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] described Downer and Rothman's efforts as \"legitimizing the notion that we have the right to know and decide about procedures...that affect our bodies and our lives.\"<ref name=\"articles.latimes.com\"/>  In 1972 she also gave a notable speech to the American Psychological Association on September 5, 1972, in Hawaii, entitled \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20150923212048/http://www.cwluherstory.org/covert-sex-discrimination-against-women-as-medical-patients.html Covert Sex Discrimination Against Women as Medical Patients].\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://scriptorium.lib.duke.edu/wlm/covert/ |title = Covert Sex Discrimination Against Women as Medical Patients}}</ref>\n\nShe and Rothman were leaders of a group that founded the Feminist Women's Health Center in Los Angeles in 1971.
