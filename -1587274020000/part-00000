Lilly Page ([[Signy Coleman]]) was an ex-CIA agent who helped coordinate Chance's missions.

The mini-series was followed by the graphic novel ''Human Target: Final Cut'', as well as an ongoing series lasting 21 issues until its cancellation in 2003.\n\n==In other media==\n* A [[Human Target (1992 TV series)|television pilot]], starring [[Rick Springfield]], was produced in [[1990 in television|1990]]. Springfield starred as Chance, who was now a Vietnam vet as well as a private investigator/bodyguard. In this version, for ten percent of a client's annual income (\"whether you're a busboy or the king of England\"), Chance would take the client's place and protect his or her life. Philo Marsden ([[Kirk Baltz]]) was an eccentric computer genius who helped Chance by designing high-tech masks, and Jeff Carlyle (Sami Chester) was the chauffeur, cook and pilot for Chance's mobile base of operations, the Blackwing (designed by [[Mike Kaluta]]). Lilly Page ([[Signy Coleman]]) was an ex-CIA agent who helped coordinate Chance's missions. The show was created by [[Warner Brothers]] and Pet Fly Productions (producers of ''[[The Flash (1990 TV series)|The Flash]]'', ''[[Viper (TV series)|Viper]]'' and ''[[The Sentinel (TV series)|The Sentinel]]''), and aired on ABC.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://humantargetonline.com/abc-series/ |title=Humantargetonline: About: ABC Series |last=: ABC Series |website=humantargetonline.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624181027/http://humantargetonline.com/abc-series/ |archive-date=2010-06-24 |access-date=2010-06-17}}</ref> Though produced in 1990, the show aired only briefly in 1992 (7 episodes aired in the summer of 1992 although the pilot itself was never aired). The [[Human Target (1992 TV series)|version of the show which aired in 1992]] had a slightly different cast from that of the unaired pilot episode.

Animals such as the [[grey wolf]], [[wild boar]], [[brown bear]], [[European bison]], [[Eurasian lynx]], [[tarpan]] and [[golden eagle]] used to inhabit the forests; however, due to over hunting and timber extraction the animals have disappeared. The North Atlantic moist mixed forests ecoregion is classified as critical/endangered by the World Wildlife Fund.\n\n==Prehistory==\n\nThe ecoregion is relatively young with regard to human settlement, due to glaciation during the most recent ice age, less than 10,000 years ago. Mesolithic peoples were certainly in evidence circa 9000 to 8000 years ago throughout the present day Irish portion of the ecoregion, as well as somewhat later in the western Scotland areas of the North Atlantic moist mixed forests. Neolithic farming ensued, as grain farming technologies developed, along with advancing forms of livestock tending, along with appearance of some of the early Neolithic and Bronze Age archaeological monumental sites in the region including standing stones and stone circles.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Ancient woodland]]\n* [[Biodiversity]]\n* [[Biodiversity Action Plan]]\n* [[Bioregionalism]]\n* [[Community Forests in England]]\n* [[Conservation biology]]\n* [[Forestry Commission]]\n* [[Geology of England]]\n* [[List of ecoregions]]\n* [[List of forests in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[National Nature Reserves in England]]\n* [[Protected areas of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Trees of Britain and Ireland]]\n\n==External links==\n* http://www.forestry.gov.uk/ UK forestry commission website\n* http://www.globalspecies.org/ecoregions/display/PA0429\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Paleartic temperate broadleaf and mixed forests}}\n\n[[Category:Ecoregions of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Ecoregions of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Fauna of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Fauna of Scotland]]\n[[Category:Flora of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Flora of Scotland]]\n[[Category:Palearctic ecoregions]]\n[[Category:Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox ecoregion\n| name                        = North Atlantic moist mixed forests\n| image                       = \n| image_size                  =    \n| image_alt                   = \n| image_caption               = \n| map                         = File:Ecoregion PA0429.svg\n| map_size                    = \n| map_alt                     = \n| map_caption                 = Map of North Atlantic moist mixed forests\n| country                     = [[Republic of Ireland]]\n| country1                    = [[United Kingdom]] ([[Northern Ireland]] and [[Scotland]])\n|country2 = [[Denmark]] ([[Faroe Islands]])\n| border                      = [[Celtic broadleaf forests]]\n| border1                     = [[Caledonian forest]]\n| border2                     = \n| border3                     = \n| border4                     = \n| border5                     = \n| biome                       = [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]]\n| biogeographic_realm = [[Palearctic realm|Palearctic]]\n| bird_species                = \n| mammal_species              = \n| habitat_loss               = \n| habitat_loss_ref =\n| protected                   = \n| protected_ref =\n| area                        = 22000 <ref>\"North Atlantic moist mixed forests\" World Wildlife Fund.

Animals such as the [[grey wolf]], [[wild boar]], [[brown bear]], [[European bison]], [[Eurasian lynx]], [[tarpan]] and [[golden eagle]] used to inhabit the forests; however, due to over hunting and timber extraction the animals have disappeared. The North Atlantic moist mixed forests ecoregion is classified as critical/endangered by the World Wildlife Fund.\n\n==Prehistory==\n\nThe ecoregion is relatively young with regard to human settlement, due to glaciation during the most recent ice age, less than 10,000 years ago. Mesolithic peoples were certainly in evidence circa 9000 to 8000 years ago throughout the present day Irish portion of the ecoregion, as well as somewhat later in the western Scotland areas of the North Atlantic moist mixed forests. Neolithic farming ensued, as grain farming technologies developed, along with advancing forms of livestock tending, along with appearance of some of the early Neolithic and Bronze Age archaeological monumental sites in the region including standing stones and stone circles.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Ancient woodland]]\n* [[Biodiversity]]\n* [[Biodiversity Action Plan]]\n* [[Bioregionalism]]\n* [[Community Forests in England]]\n* [[Conservation biology]]\n* [[Forestry Commission]]\n* [[Geology of England]]\n* [[List of ecoregions]]\n* [[List of forests in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[National Nature Reserves in England]]\n* [[Protected areas of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Trees of Britain and Ireland]]\n\n==External links==\n* http://www.forestry.gov.uk/ UK forestry commission website\n* http://www.globalspecies.org/ecoregions/display/PA0429\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Paleartic temperate broadleaf and mixed forests}}\n\n[[Category:Ecoregions of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Ecoregions of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Fauna of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Fauna of Scotland]]\n[[Category:Flora of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Flora of Scotland]]\n[[Category:Palearctic ecoregions]]\n[[Category:Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]]\n", "name_user": "Konli17", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic_moist_mixed_forests"}

He was killed in action on Mount [[Avala]], near Belgrade in Serbia.\n\n==Biography==\nGeneral von Stettner came from a well-respected family of soldiers. He fought in World War I.<br> He started World War II as commander of a Gebirgsj\u00e4ger-Regiment and fought in Poland, Norway, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union, where his unit advanced into the Caucasus.

The bridgehead held out until September 1943, but the 1st Mountain Division was transferred before in April to Yugoslavia for anti-partisan operations. \n\nUnder Stettner's command, the 1st Mountain Division committed several war crimes in Yugoslavia and Greece, including the [[Massacre of Kommeno|Massacres of Kommeno]], [[Mousiotitsa]], [[Lyngiades massacre|Lyngiades]] and the [[Massacre of the Acqui Division]].   \n\nIn October 1944, during the Soviet [[Belgrade Offensive]], his unit was cut off and Stettner went missing in action, presumed killed on Mount [[Avala]], near Belgrade.  \n\nHe was described as a \u201csmall, meticulous man, who suffered a complex of inferiority and was driven by a tremendous sense of pride that led him to keep political opinions to himself. From his solders, he expected unwavering obedience to Hitler\u2019s orders. He dismissed the role of the military chaplaincy in the 1<sup>st</sup> Mountain Division. In the guidelines released for Operation \u201cAugustus\u201d, Stettner required his soldiers to shoot on the spot any suspect who could potentially be connected to or suspected of partisan activities and to destroy all houses in their vicinity. This way of treating civilians in Epirus led to frequent frictions with his immediate superior, the devout Catholic General [[Hubert Lanz]]\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32652552|title=Vernichtungskrieg : Verbrechen der Wehrmacht 1941-1944|date=1995|publisher=Hamburger Edition|others=Heer, Hannes., Naumann, Klaus, 1949-|isbn=3-930908-04-2|location=Hamburg|oclc=32652552}}</ref>  \n\n==Sources==\n* This is a translation of the article in the [[German Wikipedia]], [[:de:Walter Stettner Ritter von Grabenhofen|Walter Stettner Ritter von Grabenhofen]].''\n \n{{s-start}}\n{{s-mil}}\n{{succession box|\nafter=Generalmajor [[August Wittmann]]|\nbefore=Generalmajor [[Hubert Lanz]]|\ntitle= Commander of [[1st Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|1.

Sultan [[Bahadur Shah of Gujarat]] captured the fortress from 1532 to 1535. The Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]] captured the fortress in 1569.\n\n=== Under Jaipur === \nThe fortress passed to the [[Kachwaha]] Maharajas of [[Jaipur]] in the 17th century, and it remained part of Jaipur state until Indian [[Independence]]. The area surrounding the fortress became a hunting ground for the Maharajas of Jaipur. [[Jaipur]] state acceded to India in 1949, becoming part of the state of [[Rajasthan]] in 1950.\n\n=== Temples ===\nInside Ranthambore fort, there are three Hindu temples dedicated to Ganesh, Shiva and Ramlalaji constructed in 12th and 13th centuries from red Karauli stone.

Its informal name in Puerto Rico arises from the [[feast day]] of [[Saint Roch]], or ''San Roque'' in Spanish, which coincided with the hurricane's landfall on that island.{{#tag:ref|The Puerto Rican tradition of referring to hurricanes by the names of Catholic saints being commemorated on the corresponding [[feast day]]s was among the earliest informal [[tropical cyclone naming]] systems, and lasted for centuries prior to the introduction of standardized naming conventions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tropical Cyclone Naming History and Retired Names|agency=[[National Hurricane Center]]|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=April 9, 2020|url=https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutnames_history.shtml}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Yanez, Anthony|date=September 7, 2017|title=From Adrian to Zelda: A History of Hurricane Names|newspaper=[[KNBC|NBC4 Southern California]]|url=https://www.nbclosangeles.com/local/how-hurricanes-get-their-names-storms-weather/23317/|accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref> This was the third storm bearing the local name \"San Roque\".<ref name=\"meta\"/> See also: [[Calendar of saints#Connection to tropical cyclones|Calendar of saints \u00a7 Connection to tropical cyclones]].|group=\"nb\"}} It was the third known hurricane of the [[1893 Atlantic hurricane season]]. The system was first observed on August 13 at low latitudes east of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. It grew to be a powerful, slow-moving hurricane in the [[Caribbean Sea]], and on August 17 struck Puerto Rico at the equivalence of Category 3 on the modern-day [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]]. The [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] crossed the island from southeast to northwest in about seven hours. A prolonged period of strong winds caused widespread destruction on the island, most notably along the northern coast. Large numbers of homes sustained varying degrees of damage, with flimsy shacks belonging to poor workers faring the worst; many families were left homeless. Telegraph communications were severed across the island. In addition to the intense winds, several days of heavy rainfall in interior sectors triggered extensive river flooding. The combined effects of rain and wind destroyed fields of crops, most notably coffee and sugar cane. Four people were killed in Puerto Rico.\n\nOn August 19, the hurricane began to turn northeastward, accelerate, and gradually weaken. Although its center remained far from the [[United States]], heavy rainfall and gale-force winds overspread the country's [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] on August 20 and 21. Eastern New England experienced conditions akin to a particularly bad [[nor'easter]], with winds as high as {{convert|72|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} recorded on [[Block Island]]. Across [[Rhode Island]] and [[Massachusetts]], grain crops were flattened and orchards were stripped of their fruits. The racing yacht [[Volunteer (yacht)|''Volunteer'']] was badly damaged, and a fishing [[schooner]] sank off [[Nantucket]]; only one of the seven crew members managed to survive, by clinging to debris for 33 hours. Later that day, the now-rapidly moving cyclone made landfall in Nova Scotia. Damage to utility wires in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] cut power and communications services, and a child was killed by a downed power line. The storm wrought havoc on ships and boats throughout Atlantic Canada, becoming \"one of the most notorious marine storms in the history of Nova Scotia\".<ref name=\"wreck\"/> The greatest maritime tragedy was the wreck of the [[steamship]] ''Dorcas'' and its barge, ''Etta Stewart'', which struck a rocky [[shoal]] while underway east of Halifax. ''Dorcas'' capsized and was driven ashore, while the barge broke up in the pounding surf. All crew members and passengers on the two vessels, totaling 24 people, were killed. Two more people died when their boat sank on [[Trinity Bay (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Trinity Bay]] in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], for a storm total of 37 fatalities.  \n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|1893 Atlantic hurricane 3 track.png}}\nBecause of scarce meteorological observations, little is known about Hurricane San Roque's early history.

The system was first observed on August 13 at low latitudes east of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. It grew to be a powerful, slow-moving hurricane in the [[Caribbean Sea]], and on August 17 struck Puerto Rico at the equivalence of Category 3 on the modern-day [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]]. The [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] crossed the island from southeast to northwest in about seven hours. A prolonged period of strong winds caused widespread destruction on the island, most notably along the northern coast. Large numbers of homes sustained varying degrees of damage, with flimsy shacks belonging to poor workers faring the worst; many families were left homeless. Telegraph communications were severed across the island. In addition to the intense winds, several days of heavy rainfall in interior sectors triggered extensive river flooding. The combined effects of rain and wind destroyed fields of crops, most notably coffee and sugar cane. Four people were killed in Puerto Rico.\n\nOn August 19, the hurricane began to turn northeastward, accelerate, and gradually weaken. Although its center remained far from the [[United States]], heavy rainfall and gale-force winds overspread the country's [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] on August 20 and 21. Eastern New England experienced conditions akin to a particularly bad [[nor'easter]], with winds as high as {{convert|72|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} recorded on [[Block Island]]. Across [[Rhode Island]] and [[Massachusetts]], grain crops were flattened and orchards were stripped of their fruits. The racing yacht [[Volunteer (yacht)|''Volunteer'']] was badly damaged, and a fishing [[schooner]] sank off [[Nantucket]]; only one of the seven crew members managed to survive, by clinging to debris for 33 hours. Later that day, the now-rapidly moving cyclone made landfall in Nova Scotia. Damage to utility wires in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] cut power and communications services, and a child was killed by a downed power line. The storm wrought havoc on ships and boats throughout Atlantic Canada, becoming \"one of the most notorious marine storms in the history of Nova Scotia\".<ref name=\"wreck\"/> The greatest maritime tragedy was the wreck of the [[steamship]] ''Dorcas'' and its barge, ''Etta Stewart'', which struck a rocky [[shoal]] while underway east of Halifax. ''Dorcas'' capsized and was driven ashore, while the barge broke up in the pounding surf. All crew members and passengers on the two vessels, totaling 24 people, were killed. Two more people died when their boat sank on [[Trinity Bay (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Trinity Bay]] in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], for a storm total of 37 fatalities.  \n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|1893 Atlantic hurricane 3 track.png}}\nBecause of scarce meteorological observations, little is known about Hurricane San Roque's early history.

Their fur consists of guard hairs that are moisture repellent. They have a woolly underfur for insulation. Their skin is thick and tough, especially on the head, containing a wedge-shaped muzzle with a leathery nosepad protecting its nostrils. upward thrust of their dorsally-flattened head and powerful down thrusts of the foreclaws help them tunnel through the soil during subsurface foraging. This creates raised visible ridges of soil. Genera Amblysomus and Neamblysomus use the head and webbed hind feet to move soil and evict it on the surface.<ref name=\"Bronner-Afrotheria\" />\n\nSimilarities to [[fossorial]] mammals resulted from [[Convergent evolution|ecological convergence]], not ancestry. The eyes are [[Vestigiality|vestigial]] and that is why they are covered by skin. The [[optic nerve]] is degenerate because they live underground where there is little use of them. The external ear [[Auricle (anatomy)|pinnae]] are absent as well as the external tail. The body has a streamlined shape which facilitates movement through dense substratum.<ref name=\"Bronner-Afrotheria\" /> On the outside, they are similar to other fossorial small mammals, but the golden moles show highly specialized characters like \u201ca unique hyoid-dentary articulation. Some also have hypertrophied malleus bones in the middle ear that permits great sensitivity to underground vibrations and airborne sounds. They have a third bone in the forearm (i.e. ossified tendon) and a reduction of phalanges in the fore- and hindfeet. Muscle arrangements are not paralleled in the Mammalia. Most anatomical specializations shown in extant species are found in 3 fossil species (dating back to the Miocene). Chrysochlorids have been described as \"spectacularly [[Autapomorphy|autapomorphic]]\" due to how unusual and numerous they are.<ref name=\"Bronner-Afrotheria\" />\n\nThey are blind, subterranean small mammals<ref name=\"Bronner-Afrotheria\" /> with small ears, tails and eyes that are all covered by skin and fur. They have unique cranial and nasal morphology.<ref name=\"Bronner-Afrotheria\" /> On their nose is a large leathery pad to help them burrow. They have powerful forearms and claws, but use mainly their snout to burrow. The golden mole thrusts its forearms from under its body to help it burrow deeper into the earth.\n\nBoth the male and female have a [[cloaca]]. They have tabulars in the [[Occipital lobe|occipital]] which is not found in other mammals. Their [[zygomatic arch]]es form elongations of the maxillae. Their malleus is enlarged and helps in hearing under the ground. Golden moles do not have a fifth finger on their front paws. Instead, they have a huge claw on the third or second finger. Their fur has an iridescent sheen.\n\nTheir dental formula is 3,1,3,2/3,1,3,2. The first [[incisor]] is enlarged. The lateral incisors and first [[premolar]]s are like canines. The molars are zalmbdodont (have v-shaped crest) like [[tenrec]]s. Zalambdodonty has arisen independently. This implies that it is due to morphological convergence, because they are not closely allied to any other family of extant mammals.<ref name=\"Bronner-Afrotheria\" />\n\nStudies show that tenrecs and golden moles should be separated from Insectivora and placed in Afrotheria which include the [[elephant shrew]]s and [[hyrax]]es.<ref name =\"Ciszek-2012\" /> They share few morphological [[Synapomorphy|synapomorphies]]. Mitochondrial/nuclear gene sequences and rare genomic changes demonstrated that chrysochlorids and tenrecs form their own clade, Afrosoricida (African shrew-like mammals). It contains no soricids (shrews) and is sometimes confused with the shrew subgenus ''Afrosorex''. Alternative names were \"Tenrecoidea\" and \"Tenrecomorpha\u201d. Divergence between golden-moles and tenrecs occurred about 50&nbsp;million years ago. They are now classified as Chrysochloridea instead of a specialized members of Order Insectivora.<ref name=\"Bronner-Afrotheria\" />\n\n==Natural history==\nGolden moles are common throughout southern Africa. There are 7 genera and 18 species known. They appear in the [[Talpidae]] (true moles) and Notoryctidae ([[marsupial moles]]).<ref name =\"Ciszek-2012\" /> Two subfamilies may be recognized: the Chrysochlorinae, in which the malleus bone of the middle ear is enlarged with a spherical or club-like shape and the Amblysominae, in which the malleus is not expanded and has the typical mammalian shape (i.e. Amblysomus).<ref name=\"Bronner-Afrotheria\" />\n\nAll 21 species of golden moles are endemic to subSaharan Africa. They inhabit a wide altitudinal, climatic and vegetational spectrum of subterrestrial habitats. The highest diversity is found in southern Africa. Only three species occur outside the region (i.e. Calcochloris leucorhinus; Chrysochloris; and Calcochloris tytonis). The South African species fall into two ecological groups: semi-desert (Eremitalpa granti, Cryptochloris zyli and C. wintoni), karroid (Chrysochloris visagiei) or fynbos habitats (Chrysochloris asiatica) along the south-west coast; and indigenous forests, savanna woodlands and temperate grasslands in the eastern part of the subregion (Chrysospalax, Chlorotalpa, Calcochloris, Neamblysomus and Amblysomus).<ref name=\"Bronner-Afrotheria\" />\n\nOnly the Hottentot golden mole (''Amblysomus hottentotus'') and the Cape golden mole (''Chrysochloris asiatica'') are widespread. The Stuhlmann's golden mole (''Chrysochloris stuhlmanni'') and Juliana's golden mole ''Neamblysomus julianae''), are known from scattered localities situated hundreds of kilometres apart, but connected by continuous favourable habitat. These may be more widespread than is indicated by the scant distribution data currently available. Other species, such as Sclater's golden mole (''Chlorotalpa sclateri''), probably have more restricted ranges than general texts indicate, since the few populations known to exist occur at localities separated by wide expanses of seemingly inhospitable habitat. Geographical continuity between these isolates seems unlikely.<ref name=\"Bronner-Afrotheria\" />\n\nDespite a high thermal conductance, the golden mole has a low [[basal metabolic rate]]. They reduce their thermoregulatory energy requirements and enter [[torpor]], (i.e. either daily or in the cold). Body temperature in the thermal neutral zone is lower than in other small mammals. Efficient renal function effectively reduces water requirements so that they do not need to drink. Specializations allow them to survive in extreme habitats and where food is seasonally or perennially scarce.<ref name=\"Bronner-Afrotheria\" />\n\nMost golden mole species are restricted to a narrow range of habitats and environmental conditions. They have very limited mobility and dispersal abilities. They are specialized [[R/K selection theory|K-selected]] strategists, opportunistic [[insectivore]]s. They eat primarily invertebrates they find.<ref name =\"Ciszek-2012\" /> They feed on [[earthworm]]s, [[termite]]s and [[millipede]]s. Their diets may vary due to the abundance of prey items.<ref name=\"Bronner-Afrotheria\" />\n\nMost are solitary and subterrestrial. They construct semi-permanent tunnel systems. Their tunnels consists of an upper tier of burrows used for foraging and a lower tier with inter-connecting chambers used for resting and raising young (except the Namib (''Eremitalpa granti namibensis'') who \u201cswims\" through the desert in search for termite nests.<ref name=\"Bronner-Afrotheria\" />\n\nPopulations of golden moles are restricted to patches of habitat with friable soils and abundant invertebrates. Their distribution is clumped and [[Sympatry|sympatric]]. Different species rarely coexist to compete for resources. If two species occur in the same area they tend to occupy different microhabitats due to ecological displacement.<ref name=\"Bronner-Afrotheria\" />\n\nIn courtship the male chirrups, bobs his head and stomps his foot and the female rasps and squeals. Reproductive data suggests that golden moles breed throughout the year, but peaks in the wetter months when food is more abundant. Some think they are polyoestrous. Litter sizes are usually 2. Post-natal development reaches up to 45.<ref name=\"Bronner-Afrotheria\" />\n\nThe behavior of all golden moles is primarily solitary and territorial. They live in deserts and swamps. The Golden mole digs and lives in burrows.<ref name =\"Ciszek-2012\" /> Territorial golden moles fight viciously when confined together. Studies show that small groups may hibernate together, but only in the giant golden mole. Burrows used by more than one mole. The Hottentot golden mole will fight aggressively with either sex by using their foreclaws to wrestle, and biting at the abdomen. Fighting is accompanied by high-pitched squeaks. The golden mole actively defends its burrow systems range overlap, and the dominant mole take over neighbouring burrows to increase its home range.<ref name=\"Bronner-Afrotheria\" />\n\nThe [[IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] includes 10 South African golden mole species.

Their fur consists of guard hairs that are moisture repellent. They have a woolly underfur for insulation. Their skin is thick and tough, especially on the head, containing a wedge-shaped muzzle with a leathery nosepad protecting its nostrils. upward thrust of their dorsally-flattened head and powerful down thrusts of the foreclaws help them tunnel through the soil during subsurface foraging. This creates raised visible ridges of soil. Genera Amblysomus and Neamblysomus use the head and webbed hind feet to move soil and evict it on the surface.<ref name=\"Bronner-Afrotheria\" />\n\nSimilarities to [[fossorial]] mammals resulted from [[Convergent evolution|ecological convergence]], not ancestry. The eyes are [[Vestigiality|vestigial]] and that is why they are covered by skin. The [[optic nerve]] is degenerate because they live underground where there is little use of them. The external ear [[Auricle (anatomy)|pinnae]] are absent as well as the external tail. The body has a streamlined shape which facilitates movement through dense substratum.<ref name=\"Bronner-Afrotheria\" /> On the outside, they are similar to other fossorial small mammals, but the golden moles show highly specialized characters like \u201ca unique hyoid-dentary articulation. Some also have hypertrophied malleus bones in the middle ear that permits great sensitivity to underground vibrations and airborne sounds. They have a third bone in the forearm (i.e. ossified tendon) and a reduction of phalanges in the fore- and hindfeet. Muscle arrangements are not paralleled in the Mammalia. Most anatomical specializations shown in extant species are found in 3 fossil species (dating back to the Miocene). Chrysochlorids have been described as \"spectacularly [[Autapomorphy|autapomorphic]]\" due to how unusual and numerous they are.<ref name=\"Bronner-Afrotheria\" />\n\nThey are blind, subterranean small mammals<ref name=\"Bronner-Afrotheria\" /> with small ears, tails and eyes that are all covered by skin and fur. They have unique cranial and nasal morphology.<ref name=\"Bronner-Afrotheria\" /> On their nose is a large leathery pad to help them burrow. They have powerful forearms and claws, but use mainly their snout to burrow. The golden mole thrusts its forearms from under its body to help it burrow deeper into the earth.\n\nBoth the male and female have a [[cloaca]]. They have tabulars in the [[Occipital lobe|occipital]] which is not found in other mammals. Their [[zygomatic arch]]es form elongations of the maxillae. Their malleus is enlarged and helps in hearing under the ground. Golden moles do not have a fifth finger on their front paws. Instead, they have a huge claw on the third or second finger. Their fur has an iridescent sheen.\n\nTheir dental formula is 3,1,3,2/3,1,3,2. The first [[incisor]] is enlarged. The lateral incisors and first [[premolar]]s are like canines. The molars are zalmbdodont (have v-shaped crest) like [[tenrec]]s. Zalambdodonty has arisen independently. This implies that it is due to morphological convergence, because they are not closely allied to any other family of extant mammals.<ref name=\"Bronner-Afrotheria\" />\n\nStudies show that tenrecs and golden moles should be separated from Insectivora and placed in Afrotheria which include the [[elephant shrew]]s and [[hyrax]]es.<ref name =\"Ciszek-2012\" /> They share few morphological [[Synapomorphy|synapomorphies]]. Mitochondrial/nuclear gene sequences and rare genomic changes demonstrated that chrysochlorids and tenrecs form their own clade, Afrosoricida (African shrew-like mammals). It contains no soricids (shrews) and is sometimes confused with the shrew subgenus Afrosorex. Alternative names were \"Tenrecoidea\" and \"Tenrecomorpha\u201d. Divergence between golden-moles and tenrecs occurred about 50&nbsp;million years ago. They are now classified as Chrysochloridea instead of a specialized members of Order Insectivora.<ref name=\"Bronner-Afrotheria\" />\n\n==Natural history==\nGolden moles are common throughout southern Africa. There are 7 genera and 18 species known. They appear in the [[Talpidae]] (true moles) and Notoryctidae ([[marsupial moles]]).<ref name =\"Ciszek-2012\" /> Two subfamilies may be recognized: the Chrysochlorinae, in which the malleus bone of the middle ear is enlarged with a spherical or club-like shape and the Amblysominae, in which the malleus is not expanded and has the typical mammalian shape (i.e. Amblysomus).<ref name=\"Bronner-Afrotheria\" />\n\nAll 21 species of golden moles are endemic to subSaharan Africa. They inhabit a wide altitudinal, climatic and vegetational spectrum of subterrestrial habitats. The highest diversity is found in southern Africa. Only three species occur outside the region (i.e. Calcochloris leucorhinus; Chrysochloris; and Calcochloris tytonis). The South African species fall into two ecological groups: semi-desert (Eremitalpa granti, Cryptochloris zyli and C. wintoni), karroid (Chrysochloris visagiei) or fynbos habitats (Chrysochloris asiatica) along the south-west coast; and indigenous forests, savanna woodlands and temperate grasslands in the eastern part of the subregion (Chrysospalax, Chlorotalpa, Calcochloris, Neamblysomus and Amblysomus).<ref name=\"Bronner-Afrotheria\" />\n\nOnly the Hottentot golden mole (''Amblysomus hottentotus'') and the Cape golden mole (''Chrysochloris asiatica'') are widespread. The Stuhlmann's golden mole (''Chrysochloris stuhlmanni'') and Juliana's golden mole ''Neamblysomus julianae''), are known from scattered localities situated hundreds of kilometres apart, but connected by continuous favourable habitat. These may be more widespread than is indicated by the scant distribution data currently available. Other species, such as Sclater's golden mole (''Chlorotalpa sclateri''), probably have more restricted ranges than general texts indicate, since the few populations known to exist occur at localities separated by wide expanses of seemingly inhospitable habitat. Geographical continuity between these isolates seems unlikely.<ref name=\"Bronner-Afrotheria\" />\n\nDespite a high thermal conductance, the golden mole has a low [[basal metabolic rate]]. They reduce their thermoregulatory energy requirements and enter [[torpor]], (i.e. either daily or in the cold). Body temperature in the thermal neutral zone is lower than in other small mammals. Efficient renal function effectively reduces water requirements so that they do not need to drink. Specializations allow them to survive in extreme habitats and where food is seasonally or perennially scarce.<ref name=\"Bronner-Afrotheria\" />\n\nMost golden mole species are restricted to a narrow range of habitats and environmental conditions. They have very limited mobility and dispersal abilities. They are specialized [[R/K selection theory|K-selected]] strategists, opportunistic [[insectivore]]s. They eat primarily invertebrates they find.<ref name =\"Ciszek-2012\" /> They feed on [[earthworm]]s, [[termite]]s and [[millipede]]s. Their diets may vary due to the abundance of prey items.<ref name=\"Bronner-Afrotheria\" />\n\nMost are solitary and subterrestrial. They construct semi-permanent tunnel systems. Their tunnels consists of an upper tier of burrows used for foraging and a lower tier with inter-connecting chambers used for resting and raising young (except the Namib (''Eremitalpa granti namibensis'') who \u201cswims\" through the desert in search for termite nests.<ref name=\"Bronner-Afrotheria\" />\n\nPopulations of golden moles are restricted to patches of habitat with friable soils and abundant invertebrates. Their distribution is clumped and [[Sympatry|sympatric]]. Different species rarely coexist to compete for resources. If two species occur in the same area they tend to occupy different microhabitats due to ecological displacement.<ref name=\"Bronner-Afrotheria\" />\n\nIn courtship the male chirrups, bobs his head and stomps his foot and the female rasps and squeals. Reproductive data suggests that golden moles breed throughout the year, but peaks in the wetter months when food is more abundant. Some think they are polyoestrous. Litter sizes are usually 2. Post-natal development reaches up to 45.<ref name=\"Bronner-Afrotheria\" />\n\nThe behavior of all golden moles is primarily solitary and territorial. They live in deserts and swamps. The Golden mole digs and lives in burrows.<ref name =\"Ciszek-2012\" /> Territorial golden moles fight viciously when confined together. Studies show that small groups may hibernate together, but only in the giant golden mole. Burrows used by more than one mole. The Hottentot golden mole will fight aggressively with either sex by using their foreclaws to wrestle, and biting at the abdomen. Fighting is accompanied by high-pitched squeaks. The golden mole actively defends its burrow systems range overlap, and the dominant mole take over neighbouring burrows to increase its home range.<ref name=\"Bronner-Afrotheria\" />\n\nThe [[IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] includes 10 South African golden mole species. The De Winton's golden mole (''Cryptochloris wintoni'') is critically endangered. Marley's golden mole (''Amblysomus marleyi''), Giant golden mole (Chrysospalax trevelyani), Van Zyl's golden mole (''Cryptochloris zyli''), Gunning's golden mole (''Neamblysomus gunningi''), and Juliana's golden mole (''Neamblysomus julianae'') are endangered.

They practiced a sort of ''jirga'' system with two types of councils \u2013 ''{{transl|pus|simite}}'' and ''{{transl|pus|sabh\u0101}}''. The ''{{transl|pus|simite}}'' (summit) comprised elders and tribal chiefs. The king also joined sessions of the ''{{transl|pus|simite}}''. ''Sabh\u0101'' was a sort of rural council. In India it is referred to as ''Samiti'' and ''Sabha''.\n\nIt was used over time for the selection of rulers and headmen and the airing of matters of principle. From the time of the great Kushan ruler [[Kanishka]] to the 1970s, there were sixteen [[nation]]al ''loya jirgas'' and hundreds of smaller ones. The institution, which is centuries old, is a similar idea to the Islamic ''[[shura]]'' (consultative assembly).<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\"/>\n\nIn the [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghan society]], the ''loya jirga'' is still maintained and favored, mostly by tribal leaders to solve internal or external disputes with other tribes. In some cases it functions like a [[town hall meeting]].\n\nWhen the Afghans took power they tried to legitimize their hold with such a ''jirga''. While in the beginning only Pashtuns were allowed to participate in the ''jirgas'', later other ethnic groups like [[Tajik people|Tajiks]] and [[Hazara people|Hazaras]] were allowed to participate as well, however they were little more than observers. The member of the ''jirgas'' were mostly members of the Royal Family, religious leaders and tribal leaders of the Afghans. King [[Amanullah Khan]] institutionalized the ''jirga''. From Amanullah until the reign of [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] (1933\u20131973) and [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] (1973\u20131978) the ''jirga'' was recognized as a common meeting of regional Pashtun leaders.\n\nThe meetings do not have scheduled occurrences, but rather are called for when issues or disputes arise. There is no time limit for a ''loya jirga'' to conclude, and the meetings often take time because decisions can only be made as a group and arguments can drag out for days. Various issues can be addressed such as major disaster, foreign policy, declaration of war, the legitimacy of leaders, and the introduction of new ideas and laws.\n\n==Afghanistan==\nLoya jirga can officialy call for Afghan cause.Loya Jirga is not a joke only Abdali can call the jirga for Afghanistan.\n\nSome of the historical ''loya jirgas'' in the [[history of Afghanistan]] are:\n*'''October 1747''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' at [[Kandahar]] was attended by Afghan representatives who appointed [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] as their new leader.\n*'''September 1928''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' at [[Paghman]], called by [[King Amanullah]], the third loya jirga of his reign (1919\u20131929) to discuss reforms.\n*'''September 1930''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' of 286 called by [[Mohammed Nadir Shah]] to confirm his accession to the throne.\n*'''1941''' \u2013 Called by [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] to approve neutrality in [[World War II]].\n*'''1947''' \u2013 Held by Pashtuns in the [[FATA|Tribal Agencies]] to choose between joining [[India]] or [[Pakistan]].\n*'''July 26, 1949''' \u2013 [[Afghanistan-Pakistan relations]] rapidly deteriorated over a dispute, officially declared that it did not recognize the 1893 [[Durand Line]] border any longer between the two countries.<ref>Agha Amin, [http://www.chowk.com/ilogs/65724/47736 \"Resolving the Afghan-Pakistan Border Question\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012045458/http://www.chowk.com/ilogs/65724/47736 |date=October 12, 2008}}, ''Journal of Afghanistan Studies'', Kabul, (accessed December 12, 2009).</ref>\n*'''September 1964''' \u2013 A meeting of 452 called by [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] to approve a new constitution.\n*'''July 1974''' \u2013 A meeting with Pakistan over the Durand Line.\n*'''[[1977 Afghan Constitutional Assembly election|January 1977]]''' \u2013 Approved the new constitution of [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] establishing one-party rule in the [[Daouds Republic of Afghanistan|Republic of Afghanistan]].\n*'''April 1985''' \u2013 To ratify the new constitution of the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]].\n*'''September 2001''' \u2013 Four different loya jirga movements anticipating the end of [[Taliban]] rule.

From the time of the great Kushan ruler [[Kanishka]] to the 1970s, there were sixteen [[nation]]al ''loya jirgas'' and hundreds of smaller ones. The institution, which is centuries old, is a similar idea to the Islamic ''[[shura]]'' (consultative assembly).<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\"/>\n\nIn the [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghan society]], the ''loya jirga'' is still maintained and favored, mostly by tribal leaders to solve internal or external disputes with other tribes. In some cases it functions like a [[town hall meeting]].\n\nWhen the Afghans took power they tried to legitimize their hold with such a ''jirga''. While in the beginning only Pashtuns were allowed to participate in the ''jirgas'', later other ethnic groups like [[Tajik people|Tajiks]] and [[Hazara people|Hazaras]] were allowed to participate as well, however they were little more than observers. The member of the ''jirgas'' were mostly members of the Royal Family, religious leaders and tribal leaders of the Afghans. King [[Amanullah Khan]] institutionalized the ''jirga''. From Amanullah until the reign of [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] (1933\u20131973) and [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] (1973\u20131978) the ''jirga'' was recognized as a common meeting of regional Pashtun leaders.\n\nThe meetings do not have scheduled occurrences, but rather are called for when issues or disputes arise. There is no time limit for a ''loya jirga'' to conclude, and the meetings often take time because decisions can only be made as a group and arguments can drag out for days. Various issues can be addressed such as major disaster, foreign policy, declaration of war, the legitimacy of leaders, and the introduction of new ideas and laws.\n\n==Afghanistan==\nSome of the historical ''loya jirgas'' in the [[history of Afghanistan]] are:\n*'''1707\u20131709''' \u2013 ''Loya jirga'' was gathered by [[Mir Wais Hotak]] at [[Kandahar]] in 1707, but according to [[Ghulam Mohammad Ghobar]] it was gathered in Manja in 1709.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wolas.beepworld.de/mirwaisneeka.htm |title=Mirwais Neeka |publisher=Wolas.beepworld.de |date= |accessdate=2013-04-15}}</ref>\n*'''October 1747''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' at [[Kandahar]] was attended by Afghan representatives who appointed [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] as their new leader.\n*'''September 1928''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' at [[Paghman]], called by [[King Amanullah]], the third loya jirga of his reign (1919\u20131929) to discuss reforms.\n*'''September 1930''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' of 286 called by [[Mohammed Nadir Shah]] to confirm his accession to the throne.\n*'''1941''' \u2013 Called by [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] to approve neutrality in [[World War II]].\n*'''1947''' \u2013 Held by Pashtuns in the [[FATA|Tribal Agencies]] to choose between joining [[India]] or [[Pakistan]].\n*'''July 26, 1949''' \u2013 [[Afghanistan-Pakistan relations]] rapidly deteriorated over a dispute, officially declared that it did not recognize the 1893 [[Durand Line]] border any longer between the two countries.<ref>Agha Amin, [http://www.chowk.com/ilogs/65724/47736 \"Resolving the Afghan-Pakistan Border Question\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012045458/http://www.chowk.com/ilogs/65724/47736 |date=October 12, 2008}}, ''Journal of Afghanistan Studies'', Kabul, (accessed December 12, 2009).</ref>\n*'''September 1964''' \u2013 A meeting of 452 called by [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] to approve a new constitution.\n*'''July 1974''' \u2013 A meeting with Pakistan over the Durand Line.\n*'''[[1977 Afghan Constitutional Assembly election|January 1977]]''' \u2013 Approved the new constitution of [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] establishing one-party rule in the [[Daouds Republic of Afghanistan|Republic of Afghanistan]].\n*'''April 1985''' \u2013 To ratify the new constitution of the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]].\n*'''September 2001''' \u2013 Four different loya jirga movements anticipating the end of [[Taliban]] rule.
