The actress contacted the casting director about a role on the show, and was eventually granted a meeting, where she learned that they were casting for a 17-year-old girl. Robbie auditioned for the role, but believing she had performed badly, Robbie went on holiday to Canada. She then learned she had won the part and had to return to Australia to begin filming. She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 2 June 2008. Donna was initially introduced as a guest character, but Robbie was promoted to the regular cast shortly after she made her debut.\n\nDonna was originally portrayed as an obsessive fan of musician [[Ty Harper]] ([[Dean Geyer]]) and someone who had a desire for friends and acceptance. After befriending the teens of [[Ramsay Street]], Donna changes her ways and matures into a warm, loveable girl. She has been described as being fiery, beautiful, kooky and confident. The character's storylines included a relationship with [[Ringo Brown]] ([[Sam Clark]]) whom she later married, a same-sex kiss with [[Sunny Lee]] (Hany Lee), the introduction of her family, and an affair with [[Andrew Robinson (Neighbours)|Andrew Robinson]] ([[Jordan Smith (actor)|Jordan Smith]]). The character became popular with viewers and Robbie earned various award nominations for her portrayal of Donna, including two [[Logie Award]] nominations. In April 2010, it was revealed that Robbie had told producers she would like to leave when her contract expired at the end of the year. Five months later, it was announced that Robbie had quit ''Neighbours'' and she departed on 26 January 2011.\n\n==Casting==\nWhen Robbie was 17, she moved to Melbourne and repeatedly contacted the serial's casting director [[Jan Russ]] to ask for a meeting. Eventually Russ agreed to see her and when she learned how old Robbie was, she revealed that they were casting for the role of a 17-year-old girl.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/the-making-of-margot-robbie-from-neighbours-to-ten-movies-in-five-years-20180315-p4z4ic.html|title=The making of Margot Robbie: From Neighbours to ten movies in five years|last=Cooney Carrillo|first=Jenny|date=16 March 2018|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=23 November 2018}}</ref> Robbie auditioned for the role of Donna in 2008.

The actress contacted the casting director about a role on the show, and was eventually granted a meeting, where she learned that they were casting for a 17 year old girl. Robbie auditioned for the role, but believing she had performed badly, Robbie went on holiday to Canada. She then learned she had won the part and had to return to Australia to begin filming. She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 2 June 2008. Donna was initially introduced as a guest character, but Robbie was promoted to the regular cast shortly after she made her debut.\n\nDonna was originally portrayed as an obsessive fan of musician [[Ty Harper]] ([[Dean Geyer]]) and someone who had a desire for friends and acceptance. After befriending the teens of [[Ramsay Street]], Donna changes her ways and matures into a warm, loveable girl. She has been described as being fiery, beautiful, kooky and confident. The character's storylines included a relationship with [[Ringo Brown]] ([[Sam Clark]]) whom she later married, a same-sex kiss with [[Sunny Lee]] (Hany Lee), the introduction of her family, and an affair with [[Andrew Robinson (Neighbours)|Andrew Robinson]] ([[Jordan Smith (actor)|Jordan Smith]]). The character became popular with viewers and Robbie earned various award nominations for her portrayal of Donna, including two [[Logie Award]] nominations. In April 2010, it was revealed that Robbie had told producers she would like to leave when her contract expired at the end of the year. Five months later, it was announced that Robbie had quit ''Neighbours'' and she departed on 26 January 2011.\n\n==Casting==\nWhen Robbie was 17, she moved to Melbourne and repeatedly contacted the serial's casting director [[Jan Russ]] to ask for a meeting. Eventually Russ agreed to see her and when she learned how old Robbie was, she revealed that they were casting for the role of a 17-year-old girl.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/the-making-of-margot-robbie-from-neighbours-to-ten-movies-in-five-years-20180315-p4z4ic.html|title=The making of Margot Robbie: From Neighbours to ten movies in five years|last=Cooney Carrillo|first=Jenny|date=16 March 2018|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=23 November 2018}}</ref> Robbie auditioned for the role of Donna in 2008.
