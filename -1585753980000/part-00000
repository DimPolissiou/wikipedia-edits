It was released first in arcades, followed by home ports for the [[Sega Saturn]] in Japan, and later for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in all regions.\n\nCapitalizing on the success of [[Sega]]'s ''[[Virtua Fighter (series)|Virtua Fighter]]'' fighting game series at the time, ''Dead or Alive'' takes influence from ''Virtua Fighter'' while adding unique gameplay elements of its own. The game was well-praised for its fighting system and advanced graphics. The game also attracted attention for its presentation, which was more provocative than other mainstream 3D fighting games at the time.\n\n''Dead or Alive'' was a commercial success, helping Tecmo overcome their financial problems. The success of the game helped turn the series into a franchise, including several sequels and numerous spinoffs.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nUnlike other fighting games of the time, in place of a \"guard\" button ''Dead or Alive'' uses a \"hold\" button, which causes the fighter to grab their opponent's limbs if they are attacking at the time.<ref name=\"SatMag9\">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Dead or Alive |magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=9|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=July 1996|page=96}}</ref> This countering system was the first in the fighting genre to utilize different commands that correspond to each type of attack. There are two kinds of holds, an Offensive Hold and a Defensive Hold; the latter are executed by holding back or forward on the directional pad along with the guard input to either force away or counter-damage an opponent.\n\nThe outer edges of the fighting arena are set with explosives which deal a high amount of damage to any fighter who comes in contact with them.<ref name=\"SatMag9\"/> They can also send an affected character in the air so the opposing player can execute a juggling air [[Combo (video gaming)|combo]]. However, this can be avoided with a defensive roll.\n\n== Characters ==\n{{See also|List of Dead or Alive characters}}\n\n*[[Bayman]], a Russian mercenary and [[Sambo (martial art)|Russian martial arts]] practitioner hired to kill DOATEC's founder and CEO, Fame Douglas.\n*[[Gen Fu]], an old Chinese [[Xing Yi Quan|xinyi liuhe quan]] martial arts master and bookstore owner who enters the tournament to win the prize money to provide funds for his sick granddaughter. \n*[[Jann Lee]], a Chinese [[Jeet Kune Do|jeet kune do]] martial artist who enters the tournament to test his skills against powerful opponents. His character is modeled on [[Bruce Lee]].\n*[[Kasumi (Dead or Alive)|Kasumi]], a Japanese kunoichi who abandons her village in search of Raidou, the man who crippled her brother.\n*[[Leifang]], a young Chinese [[Tai chi|tai chi quan]] practitioner, who enters the tournament to defeat Jann Lee.\n*[[Raidou (Dead or Alive)|Raidou]], an evil ninja exiled from Kasumi's clan.\n*[[Ryu Hayabusa]], a Japanese ninja hero and best friend of Kasumi's brother who enters the tournament to fulfill his thirst for challenge. He is originally from ''[[Ninja Gaiden]]''.\n*[[Tina Armstrong]], an American female [[Professional wrestling|wrestler]] who enters the tournament to be noticed by Hollywood.\n*[[Zack (Dead or Alive)|Zack]], a flamboyant African-American DJ and [[Muay Thai|kickboxer]] who enters the tournament to win the prize money.\n\nAdded in the PlayStation and ''Arcade++'' versions are Kasumi's half-sister [[Ayane (Dead or Alive)|Ayane]] and Tina's father [[Bass Armstrong]].\n*[[Ayane (Dead or Alive)|Ayane]], a Japanese kunoichi from the same clan as Kasumi who was ordered to kill her.\n*[[Bass Armstrong]], an American professional wrestling champion and father of Tina who tries to stop her from being noticed by Hollywood.\n\n== Plot ==\nA massive corporation known as DOATEC (Dead or Alive Tournament Executive Committee) host a fighting competition called the Dead or Alive World Combat Championship, where fighters from all over the world can compete for the title as champion and a vast amount of money. A runaway [[kunoichi]] known as Kasumi enters the Dead or Alive tournament to seek revenge against her uncle Raidou, who was responsible for crippling her brother [[Hayate (Dead or Alive)|Hayate]]. Kasumi eventually defeats and kills Raidou, but her decision to leave her village without permission violates the strict laws of the ninja society, and as a result, she becomes a hunted fugitive.\n\n== Development and release ==\nDuring the mid 1990s, Japanese gaming company [[Tecmo]] was in financial trouble. Seeing how popular [[Sega]]'s ''[[Virtua Fighter]]'' series was in Japan at the time, the management asked [[Tomonobu Itagaki]] to create a game similar to ''Virtua Fighter''.<ref name=\"videogamesdaily1\">{{cite web|url=http://archive.videogamesdaily.com/features/itagaki_interview_feb05_p1.asp |title=Video Games Daily &#124; Tomonobu Itagaki: The Kikizo Interview 2005 with Team Ninja Boss |website=Archive.videogamesdaily.com |date=2005-02-15 |accessdate=2016-03-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319000936/http://archive.videogamesdaily.com/features/itagaki_interview_feb05_p1.asp |archivedate=2016-03-19 }}</ref> Itagaki was a fan of ''Virtua Fighter'', but he wanted ''Dead or Alive'' to stand out among the competition.

The success of the game helped turn the series into a franchise, including several sequels and numerous spinoffs.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nUnlike other fighting games of the time, in place of a \"guard\" button ''Dead or Alive'' uses a \"hold\" button, which causes the fighter to grab their opponent's limbs if they are attacking at the time.<ref name=\"SatMag9\">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Dead or Alive |magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=9|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=July 1996|page=96}}</ref> This countering system was the first in the fighting genre to utilize different commands that correspond to each type of attack. There are two kinds of holds, an Offensive Hold and a Defensive Hold; the latter are executed by holding back or forward on the directional pad along with the guard input to either force away or counter-damage an opponent.\n\nThe outer edges of the fighting arena are set with explosives which deal a high amount of damage to any fighter who comes in contact with them.<ref name=\"SatMag9\"/> They can also send an affected character in the air so the opposing player can execute a juggling air [[Combo (video gaming)|combo]]. However, this can be avoided with a defensive roll.\n\n== Characters ==\n{{See also|List of Dead or Alive characters}}\n\n*[[Bayman]], a Russian mercenary and [[Sambo (martial art)|Russian martial arts]] practitioner hired to kill DOATEC's founder and CEO, Fame Douglas.\n*[[Gen Fu]], an old Chinese [[Xing Yi Quan|xinyi liuhe quan]] martial arts master and bookstore owner who enters the tournament to win the prize money to provide funds for his sick granddaughter. \n*[[Jann Lee]], a Chinese [[Jeet Kune Do|jeet kune do]] martial artist who enters the tournament to test his skills against powerful opponents.

A runaway [[kunoichi]] known as Kasumi enters the Dead or Alive tournament to seek revenge against her uncle Raidou, who was responsible for crippling her brother [[Hayate (Dead or Alive)|Hayate]]. Kasumi eventually defeats and kills Raidou, but her decision to leave her village without permission violates the strict laws of the ninja society, and as a result, she becomes a hunted fugitive.\n\n== Development and release ==\nDuring the mid 1990s, Japanese gaming company [[Tecmo]] was in financial trouble. Seeing how popular [[Sega]]'s ''[[Virtua Fighter]]'' series was in Japan at the time, the management asked [[Tomonobu Itagaki]] to create a game similar to ''Virtua Fighter''.<ref name=\"videogamesdaily1\">{{cite web|url=http://archive.videogamesdaily.com/features/itagaki_interview_feb05_p1.asp |title=Video Games Daily &#124; Tomonobu Itagaki: The Kikizo Interview 2005 with Team Ninja Boss |website=Archive.videogamesdaily.com |date=2005-02-15 |accessdate=2016-03-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319000936/http://archive.videogamesdaily.com/features/itagaki_interview_feb05_p1.asp |archivedate=2016-03-19 }}</ref> Itagaki was a fan of ''Virtua Fighter'', but he wanted ''Dead or Alive'' to stand out among the competition.

In the [[frame story]], four English children are relocated to a large, old country house following a [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|wartime evacuation]]. The youngest, Lucy, visits Narnia three times via the magic of a [[wardrobe]] in a spare room. Lucy's three siblings are with her on her third visit to Narnia. In Narnia, the siblings seem fit to fulfill an old prophecy and find themselves adventuring to save Narnia and their own lives. The lion Aslan gives his life to save one of the children; he later rises from the dead, vanquishes the White Witch, and crowns the children Kings and Queens of Narnia.\n\nLewis wrote the book for (and dedicated it to) his goddaughter, [[Lucy Barfield]].

Lucy meets [[Mr. Tumnus|Tumnus]], a [[faun]] who befriends her and informs her that she is in the land of Narnia. He invites her to have tea with him at his cave. Eventually, he reveals that he is in the pay of the [[White Witch]], a ruler who has kept Narnia frozen in a perpetual winter and who has given out orders that any human found in Narnia was to be captured and handed over to her. Tumnus then repents and realises that he cannot hand Lucy over to the Witch. He guides Lucy back to the lamppost. Once there, she returns to her own world by re-entering the wardrobe and finds that only a few seconds have passed there during her absence. None of her siblings believe her story about Narnia; upon inspection, the back of the wardrobe appears solid and leads nowhere. \n\nLucy enters the wardrobe again, and it again leads her into Narnia. This time, Edmund follows Lucy and also enters Narnia, but is unable to find his sister. Upon arriving in Narnia, Edmund encounters a great lady on a reindeer-drawn sleigh. She introduces herself as the Queen of Narnia, and plies him with sweet [[Turkish Delight]]. She is keen to find out as much as possible about Edmund, and is particularly interested in the fact that he has a brother and two sisters. She promises to reward Edmund with more Turkish Delight if he brings his brother and sisters to her house, and also promises to make him a prince and eventually King of Narnia. She then departs and when Edmund reaches the lamp-post, Lucy catches up with him. During their conversation about Narnia, Lucy tells Edmund that she has been to visit Tumnus the faun, and that the White Witch has done nothing to him for letting her go on her first visit. When Lucy describes the White Witch, Edmund realises that the Witch is no other than the lady he has just made friends with, but he remains quiet about his meeting with her. When they returned to their own world, however, Edmund decides to make out that Lucy has been telling lies about the country in the wardrobe, much to her dismay. Peter is angry with Edmund for his supposed encouragement and jeering towards Lucy over her \"imaginary\" country, and quickly agrees with Susan that they need to speak to the professor, as they fear that Lucy is going mad. The professor, however, suggests that Lucy's story may well be true - particularly as Peter and Susan always saw her as the more honest sibling, and it is perfect obvious in the professor's opinion that Lucy is not mad. \n\nSoon afterwards, all four children enter Narnia together while hiding in the wardrobe from the housekeeper, Mrs. Macready, who was giving a tour of the house to some visitors. Lucy leads the group to Tumnus's cave, only to find that it has been ransacked and that the faun is under arrest on a charge of treason against the Queen of Narnia (the White Witch), as mentioned in a letter signed by [[Maugrim]], chief of the White Witch's secret police. The children are befriended by [[Mr. Beaver]], a talking animal who takes them to his home. He informs them that Tumnus was last seen heading northwards - in the direction of the White Witch's castle - after being arrested by the secret police. His exact fate is unknown, but few people who have been taken into the castle have ever come out again - the courtyard, stairway and hall are reportedly full of statues of Narnians she has turned to stone. He and his wife tell the children about a prophecy that the Witch's tyranny will end when \"two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve\" sit on the four thrones of [[Cair Paravel]], and that Narnia's true ruler \u2014 the great lion [[Aslan]] \u2014 is at last arriving in Narnia, and they will be meeting him tomorrow at the Stone Table.\n\nEdmund slips away to the Witch's castle. In the courtyard, he is surprised by the many statues of Narnians the Witch has turned to stone. He first encounters Maugrim, who allows him to enter the castle. The Witch is furious that Edmund has come alone, and is angrier still to learn that Aslan \u2014 her enemy \u2014 has arrived in Narnia. She prepares to head to the Stone Table with Edmund in tow and her dwarf driving the sledge. She also orders Maugrim to take with him the swiftest of his wolves and kill Edmund's siblings and the beavers, and to head to the Stone Table if the children and beavers are already gone.\n\nMeanwhile, the children and the beavers notice Edmund's absence, and Mr Beaver was quick to reach the conclusion that Edmund had gone to the White Witch. They prepare for a long journey with the other children to meet Aslan. They finally reach a hiding place after walking for several miles in order to get some sleep. They are greeted the next morning by Father Christmas, who had been kept out of Narnia by the Witch's magic - this is the first major sign that the Witch's power is crumbling. By the time they have reached the Stone Table to meet Aslan, the snow has melted and winter has ended. \n\n[[Maugrim]] then approaches the camp and attempts to attack Susan, but is killed by Peter. Aslan sends a rescue party for Edmund; it arrives just in time to save him from the Witch, who had decided to kill him. The Witch parleys with Aslan, invoking the \"Deep Magic from the Dawn of Time\" which gives her the right to kill Edmund for his treason. Aslan then speaks to the Witch alone, and on his return he announces that the Witch has renounced her claim on Edmund's life. Aslan and his followers then move the encampment on into the nearby forest.\n\nThat evening, Susan and Lucy follow Aslan, who leads them to the Stone Table. They watch from a distance as the Witch puts Aslan to death - as they had agreed in their pact to spare Edmund. After the Witch and her followers depart to prepare for battle against Aslan's followers, Susan and Lucy remain with Aslan's body. In the morning, the girls find the Stone Table broken and Aslan restored to life. Aslan explains that the \"Deeper Magic from before the Dawn of Time\" has the power to reverse death if a willing victim takes the place of a traitor. Aslan takes the girls to the Witch's house and revives the Narnians that the Witch had turned to stone, including Tumnus and a giant named Rumblebuffin. They join the Narnian forces battling the Witch's army. The Narnian army prevails, and Aslan kills the Witch. The Pevensie children are then crowned kings and queens of Narnia at Cair Paravel.\n\nAfter a long and happy reign, the adult Pevensies go on a hunt for the White Stag who is said to grant the wishes of those who catch it. The four arrive at the lamppost and, having forgotten about it, unintentionally return through the wardrobe when they were looking for new adventures. When they return to England, they are children again, with no time having passed since their departure. They tell the story to the professor, who believes them and reassures the children that they will return to Narnia one day when they least expect it.\n\n==Main characters==\n*[[Lucy Pevensie|Lucy]] is the youngest of four siblings. In some respects, she is the primary protagonist of the story. She is the first to discover the land of Narnia, which she enters inadvertently when she steps into a wardrobe while exploring the Professor's house. When Lucy tells her three siblings about Narnia, they do not believe her: Peter and Susan think she is just playing a game, while Edmund persistently ridicules her. In Narnia, she is crowned Queen Lucy the Valiant.\n*[[Edmund Pevensie|Edmund]] is the second-youngest of four siblings. He has a bad relationship with his brother and sisters. Edmund is known to be a liar, and often harasses Lucy. Lured by the White Witch's promise of power and an unlimited supply of magical treats, Edmund betrays his siblings. He later repents and helps defeat the White Witch. He is eventually crowned King Edmund the Just.\n*[[Susan Pevensie|Susan]] is the second-oldest sibling. She does not believe in Narnia until she actually goes there. She and Lucy accompany Aslan on the journey to the Stone Table, where he allows the Witch to take his life in place of Edmund's. Tending to Aslan's carcass, she removes a muzzle from him to restore his dignity and oversees a horde of mice who gnaw away his bonds. She then shares the joy of his resurrection and the endeavor to bring reinforcements to a critical battle. Susan is crowned Queen Susan the Gentle.\n*[[Peter Pevensie|Peter]] is the eldest sibling. He judiciously settles disputes between his younger brother and sisters, often rebuking Edmund for his attitude. Peter also disbelieves Lucy's stories about Narnia until he sees it for himself. He is hailed as a hero for the slaying of [[Maugrim]] and for his command in the battle to overthrow the White Witch. He is crowned High King of Narnia and dubbed King Peter the Magnificent.\n*[[Aslan]], a [[lion]], is the rightful King of Narnia and other magic countries. He sacrifices himself to save Edmund, but is resurrected in time to aid the denizens of Narnia and the Pevensie children against the White Witch and her minions. As the \"son of the Emperor beyond the sea\" (an allusion to [[God the Father#Christianity|God the Father]]), Aslan is the all-powerful creator of Narnia. Lewis revealed that he wrote Aslan as a portrait, although not an allegorical portrait, of [[Jesus|Christ]].<ref>Letter to Anne Jenkins, 5 March 1961, in {{cite book|last=Hooper|first=Walter|title=The Collected Letters of C. S. Lewis, Volume III|year=2007|publisher=HarperSanFrancisco|isbn=978-0-06-081922-4|page=1245}}</ref>\n*[[White Witch|The White Witch]] is the land's self-proclaimed queen and the primary antagonist of the story. Her spell on Narnia has made winter persist for a hundred years with no end in sight. When provoked, she turns creatures to stone with her wand. She fears the fulfillment of a prophecy that \"two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve\" (meaning two male humans and two female humans) will supplant her. She is usually referred to as \"the White Witch\", or just \"the Witch\". Her actual name, \"Jadis,\" appears once in the notice left on Tumnus's door after his arrest. Lewis later wrote a [[The Magician's Nephew|prequel]] to include her back story and account for her presence in the Narnian world.\n*[[Digory Kirke|The Professor]] is a kindly old gentleman who takes the children in when they are evacuated from London. He is the first to believe that Lucy did indeed visit a land called Narnia. He tries to convince the others logically that she did not make it up. After the children return from Narnia, he assures them that they will return one day. The book hints that he knows more of Narnia than he lets on (hints expanded upon in later books of the series).\n*[[Mr. Tumnus|Tumnus]], a [[faun]], is the first individual Lucy (who calls him \"Mr. Tumnus\") meets in Narnia. Tumnus befriends Lucy, despite the White Witch's standing order to turn in any human he finds. He initially plans to obey the order but, after getting to like Lucy, he cannot bear to alert the Witch's forces. He instead escorts her back towards the safety of her own country. His good deed is later given away to the Witch by Edmund. The witch orders Tumnus arrested and turns him to stone, but he is later restored to life by Aslan.\n*[[Mr. and Mrs. Beaver]], two [[beaver]]s, are friends of Tumnus. They play host to Peter, Susan and Lucy and lead them to Aslan.\n\n==Writing==\nLewis described the origin of ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' in an essay titled \"It All Began with a Picture\":<ref>Lewis (1960). \"It All Began with a Picture\". ''Radio Times''. 15 July 1960. In Hooper (1982), p. 53.</ref>\n:The ''Lion'' all began with a picture of a Faun carrying an umbrella and parcels in a snowy wood.

[[Roger Lancelyn Green]] thinks that he might even have completed it. In September 1947 Lewis wrote in a letter about stories for children: \"I have tried one myself but it was, by the unanimous verdict of my friends, so bad that I destroyed it.\"<ref>Lewis (2004 [1947]).

Nesbit]]\".<ref>Walsh, Chad (1974). ''C. S. Lewis: Apostle to the Skeptics''. Norwood Editions. p. 10. {{ISBN|0-88305-779-4}}.</ref> After this conversation not much happened until the beginning of the next year. Then everything changed. In his essay \"It All Began With a Picture\" Lewis continues: \"At first I had very little idea how the story would go. But then suddenly Aslan came bounding into it. I think I had been having a good many dreams of lions about that time. Apart from that, I don't know where the Lion came from or why he came. But once he was there, he pulled the whole story together, and soon he pulled the six other Narnian stories in after him.\"<ref>Lewis (1960). In Hooper (1982), pp. xix, 53.</ref>\n\nThe major ideas of the book echo lines Lewis had written fourteen years earlier in his alliterative poem ''The Planets'':\n:...&nbsp;Of wrath ended\n:And woes mended, of winter passed\n:And guilt forgiven, and good fortune\n:[[Jupiter (mythology)|J<small>OVE</small>]] is master; and of jocund revel,\n:Laughter of ladies.

After the meal Lewis read two chapters from his new children's story to Green. Lewis asked Green's opinion of the tale and Green said that he thought it was good. The manuscript of ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' was complete by the end of March 1949. Lucy Barfield received it by the end of May.<ref>Hooper, Walter. \"Lucy Barfield (1935\u20132003)\".

Lewis chose [[Pauline Baynes]], possibly based on [[J.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;R. Tolkien]]'s recommendation. In December 1949, Bles showed Lewis the first drawings for the novel, and Lewis sent Baynes a note congratulating her, particularly on the level of detail. Lewis's appreciation of the illustrations is evident in a letter he wrote to Baynes after ''[[The Last Battle]]'' won the [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] for best children's book of 1956: \"is it not rather 'our' medal? I'm sure the illustrations were taken into account as well as the text\".<ref>Schakel 2002, pp. 30\u201331.</ref>\n\nThe British edition of the novel had 43 illustrations; American editions generally had fewer. The popular United States paperback edition published by Collier between 1970 and 1994, which sold many millions, had only 17 illustrations, many of them severely cropped from the originals, giving many readers in that country a very different experience when reading the novel. All the illustrations were restored for the 1994 worldwide HarperCollins edition, although these illustrations lacked the clarity of early printings.<ref>Schakel 2002, p. 132.</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nLewis very much enjoyed writing ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' and embarked on the sequel ''[[Prince Caspian]]'' soon after finishing the first novel. He completed the sequel by end of 1949, less than a year after finishing the initial book. ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' had few readers during 1949 and was not published until late in 1950, so his initial enthusiasm did not stem from favourable reception by the public.<ref>Veith, pp. 11\u201312.</ref>\n\nWhile Lewis is known today on the strength of the Narnia stories as a highly successful children's writer, the initial critical response was muted. At the time it was fashionable for children's stories to be realistic; fantasy and fairy tales were seen as indulgent, appropriate only for very young readers and potentially harmful to older children, even hindering their ability to relate to everyday life. Some reviewers considered the tale overtly moralistic or the Christian elements over-stated\u2014attempts to indoctrinate children. Others were concerned that the many violent incidents might frighten children.<ref>Veith, p. 12.</ref>\n\nLewis's publisher, Geoffrey Bles, feared that the Narnia tales would not sell, and might damage Lewis's reputation and affect sales of his other books. Nevertheless, the novel and its successors were highly popular with young readers, and Lewis's publisher was soon eager to release further Narnia stories.<ref>Veith, p. 13.</ref>\n\nIn the United States a 2004 study found that ''The Lion'' was a common read-aloud book for seventh-graders in schools in [[San Diego County, California]].<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Fisher, Douglas, James Flood, Diane Lapp, and Nancy Frey |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207031123/http://www.fisherandfrey.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/rt-read-alouds.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-07 |year=2004 |title= Interactive Read-Alouds: Is There a Common Set of Implementation Practices? |journal=[[The Reading Teacher]] |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages= 8\u201317|url= http://www.fisherandfrey.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/rt-read-alouds.pdf |accessdate= 2012-08-22 |doi=10.1598/RT.58.1.1}}</ref> In 2005 it was included on ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'''s unranked list of the 100 best English-language novels published since 1923.<ref name=Time2005/> Based on a 2007 online poll, the U.S. [[National Education Association]] named it one of \"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children\".<ref name=NEA2007>{{cite web |url= http://www.nea.org/grants/13154.htm/ |title= Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children |author= National Education Association |year= 2007|accessdate=2012-08-22}}</ref> In 2012 it was ranked number five among all-time children's novels in a survey published by ''[[School Library Journal]]'', a monthly with primarily U.S. audience.<ref name=SLJChapter2012>{{cite web |url= http://blog.schoollibraryjournal.com/afuse8production/2012/07/07/top-100-chapter-book-poll-results |title= Top 100 Chapter Book Poll Results |author= Bird, Elizabeth |publisher= A Fuse #8 Production.

Most reprintings of the novels until the 1980s also reflected the order of original publication. In 1980 [[HarperCollins]] published the series ordered by the chronology of the events in the novels. This meant ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'' was numbered as the first in the series. HarperCollins, which had previously published editions of the novels outside the United States, also acquired the rights to publish the novels in that country in 1994 and used this sequence in the uniform worldwide edition published in that year.<ref>Schakel, pp. 13\u201316.</ref>\n\nLaurence Krieg, a young fan, wrote to Lewis, asking him to adjudicate between his views of the correct sequence of reading the novels\u2014according to the sequence of events, with ''The Magician's Nephew'' being placed first\u2014and that of his mother, who thought the order of publication (with ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' being placed first) was more appropriate. Lewis wrote back, appearing to support the younger Krieg's views, although he did point out that the views of the author may not be the best guidance, and that perhaps it would not matter what order they were read in.<ref>Schakel, pp. 17\u201318.</ref>\n\nHowever publication order reflects Lewis's strategy for drawing readers into the world of Narnia. In the book he wrote first, [[Lucy Pevensie]]'s discovery of the wardrobe that opens onto a forest and a mysterious lamp post creates a sense of suspense about an unknown land she is discovering for the first time. This would be anticlimactic if the reader has already been introduced to Narnia in ''The Magician's Nephew'' and already knows the origins of Narnia, the wardrobe and the lamp post. Indeed, the narrative of ''The Magician's Nephew'' appears to assume that the reader has already read ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' and is now being shown its beginnings.<ref>Schakel, pp. 19\u201321.</ref>\n\nPaul Ford cites several scholars who have weighed in against the decision of HarperCollins to present the books in the order of their internal chronology,<ref>Ford, pp. xxiii\u2013xxiv.</ref> and continues, \"most scholars disagree with this decision and find it the least faithful to Lewis's deepest intentions\".<ref>Ford, p. 24.</ref>\n\n==Allusions==\nLewis wrote that \"The Narnian books are not as much allegory as supposal. Suppose there were a Narnian world and it, like ours, needed redemption. What kind of incarnation and Passion might Christ be supposed to undergo ''there''?\"<ref>James E. Higgins.

S. Lewis's ''The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe'' is the theme of [[Christianity]]. Various aspects of characters and events in the novel reflect biblical ideas from Christianity. The lion [[Aslan]] is one of the largest examples, as his death is very similar to that of [[Jesus]] Christ. While many readers made this connection, Lewis denied that the themes of Christianity were intentional, saying that his writing began by picturing images of characters, and the rest just came about through the writing process.<ref name=\"Full Text Finder\">{{Cite journal|title=Full Text Finder|doi=10.1353/sli.2013.0010}}</ref> While Lewis denied intentionally making the story a strictly Christian [[Theological fiction|theological novel]], he did admit that it could help young children accept Christianity into their lives when they were older.<ref name=\"Russell 59\u201376\">{{Cite journal|last=Russell|first=James|date=2009-09-27|title=Narnia as a Site of National Struggle: Marketing, Christianity, and National Purpose in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|journal=Cinema Journal|language=en|volume=48|issue=4|pages=59\u201376|doi=10.1353/cj.0.0145|issn=1527-2087}}</ref>\n\nAfter the children enter the world of Narnia through the wardrobe, [[Edmund Pevensie|Edmund]] finds himself in trouble under service of the [[White Witch]], as she tempts him with [[Turkish Delight]]s. When Edmund is threatened with death, Aslan offers to sacrifice himself instead. Aslan is shaved of his fur, and stabbed on an altar of stone. This is similar to how Jesus was publicly beaten, humiliated and crucified. After his sacrifice, Aslan is later reborn, and continues to help the children save Narnia.<ref name=\"Russell 59\u201376\"/> While this sequence of events is comparable to the death of Jesus, it is not identical to it. There are a few differences, such as the fact that Aslan did not allow himself to be killed to save the entirety of Narnia, but only to save Edmund. Aslan is also only dead for one night, while Jesus returned on the third day.<ref name=\"Full Text Finder\"/> Despite these differences, the image of Aslan and the event of his death and rebirth reflect those of the biblical account of Jesus' death and resurrection, adding to the theme of Christianity throughout the novel.<ref name=\"Full Text Finder\"/>\n\n==Differences between editions==\nDue to labor union rules,<ref name=\"Brown\">{{cite book |title=Inside Narnia: A Guide to Exploring The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe |last=Brown |first=Devin |year=2013 |publisher=[[Abingdon Press]] |isbn=978-0801065996 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780801065996 }}</ref> the text of ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' was reset for the publication of the first American edition of by [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan US]] in 1950.<ref name=LCC/> [[C.

The lion Aslan gives his life to save one of the children; he later rises from the dead, vanquishes the White Witch, and crowns the children Kings and Queens of Narnia.\n\nLewis wrote the book for (and dedicated it to) his goddaughter, [[Lucy Barfield]]. She was the daughter of [[Owen Barfield]], Lewis's friend, teacher, adviser and trustee.<ref>Schakel 2002 p. 75</ref> In 2003, ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' was ranked ninth on the [[BBC]]'s [[The Big Read]] poll.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top100.shtml \"BBC&nbsp;\u2013 The Big Read\"].

Lucy meets [[Mr. Tumnus|Tumnus]], a [[faun]] who befriends her and informs her that she is in the land of Narnia. He invites her to have tea with him at his cave. Eventually, he reveals that he is in the pay of the [[White Witch]], a ruler who has kept Narnia frozen in a perpetual winter and who has given out orders that any human found in Narnia was to be captured and handed over to her. Tumnus then repents and realises that he cannot hand Lucy over to the Witch. He guides Lucy back to the lamppost. Once there, she returns to her own world by re-entering the wardrobe and finds that only a few seconds have passed there during her absence. None of her siblings believe her story about Narnia; upon inspection, the back of the wardrobe appears solid and leads nowhere. \n\nLucy enters the wardrobe again, and it again leads her into Narnia. This time, Edmund follows Lucy and also enters Narnia, but is unable to find his sister. Upon arriving in Narnia, Edmund encounters a great lady on a reindeer-drawn sleigh. She introduces herself as the Queen of Narnia, and plies him with sweet [[Turkish Delight]]. She is keen to find out as much as possible about Edmund, and is particularly interested in the fact that he has a brother and two sisters. She promises to reward Edmund with more Turkish Delight if he brings his brother and sisters to her house, and also promises to make him a prince and eventually King of Narnia. She then departs and when Edmund reaches the lamp-post, Lucy catches up with him. During their conversation about Narnia, Lucy tells Edmund that she has been to visit Tumnus the faun, and that the White Witch has done nothing to him for letting her go on her first visit. When Lucy describes the White Witch, Edmund realises that the Witch is no other than the lady he has just made friends with, but he remains quiet about his meeting with her. When they returned to their own world, however, Edmund decides to make out that Lucy has been telling lies about the country in the wardrobe, much to her dismay. Peter is angry with Edmund for his supposed encouragement and jeering towards Lucy over her \"imaginary\" country, and quickly agrees with Susan that they need to speak to the professor, as they fear that Lucy is going mad. The professor, however, suggests that Lucy's story may well be true - particularly as Peter and Susan always saw her as the more honest sibling, and it is perfect obvious in the professor's opinion that Lucy is not mad. \n\nSoon afterwards, all four children enter Narnia together while hiding in the wardrobe from the housekeeper, Mrs. Macready, who was giving a tour of the house to some visitors. Lucy leads the group to Tumnus's cave, only to find that it has been ransacked and that the faun is under arrest on a charge of treason against the Queen of Narnia (the White Witch), as mentioned in a letter signed by [[Maugrim]], chief of the White Witch's secret police. The children are befriended by [[Mr. Beaver]], a talking animal who takes them to his home. He informs them that Tumnus was last seen heading northwards - in the direction of the White Witch's castle - after being arrested by the secret police. His exact fate is unknown, but few people who have been taken into the castle have ever come out again - the courtyard, stairway and hall are reportedly full of statues of Narnians she has turned to stone. He and his wife tell the children about a prophecy that the Witch's tyranny will end when \"two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve\" sit on the four thrones of [[Cair Paravel]], and that Narnia's true ruler \u2014 the great lion [[Aslan]] \u2014 is at last arriving in Narnia, and they will be meeting him tomorrow at the Stone Table.\n\nEdmund slips away to the Witch's castle. In the courtyard, he is surprised by the many statues of Narnians the Witch has turned to stone. He first encounters Maugrim, who allows him to enter the castle. The Witch is furious that Edmund has come alone, and is angrier still to learn that Aslan \u2014 her enemy \u2014 has arrived in Narnia. She prepares to head to the Stone Table with Edmund in tow and her dwarf driving the sledge. She also orders Maugrim to take with him the swiftest of his wolves and kill Edmund's siblings and the beavers, and to head to the Stone Table if the children and beavers are already gone.\n\nMeanwhile, the children and the beavers notice Edmund's absence, and Mr Beaver was quick to reach the conclusion that Edmund had gone to the White Witch. They prepare for a long journey with the other children to meet Aslan. They finally reach a hiding place after walking for several miles in order to get some sleep. They are greeted the next morning by Father Christmas, who had been kept out of Narnia by the Witch's magic - this is the first major sign that the Witch's power is crumbling. By the time they have reached the Stone Table to meet Aslan, the snow has melted and winter has ended. \n\n[[Maugrim]] then approaches the camp and attempts to attack Susan, but is killed by Peter. Aslan sends a rescue party for Edmund; it arrives just in time to save him from the Witch, who had decided to kill him. The Witch parleys with Aslan, invoking the \"Deep Magic from the Dawn of Time\" which gives her the right to kill Edmund for his treason. Aslan then speaks to the Witch alone, and on his return he announces that the Witch has renounced her claim on Edmund's life. Aslan and his followers then move the encampment on into the nearby forest.\n\nThat evening, Susan and Lucy follow Aslan, who leads them to the Stone Table. They watch from a distance as the Witch puts Aslan to death - as they had agreed in their pact to spare Edmund. After the Witch and her followers depart to prepare for battle against Aslan's followers, Susan and Lucy remain with Aslan's body. In the morning, the girls find the Stone Table broken and Aslan restored to life. Aslan explains that the \"Deeper Magic from before the Dawn of Time\" has the power to reverse death if a willing victim takes the place of a traitor. Aslan takes the girls to the Witch's house and revives the Narnians that the Witch had turned to stone, including Tumnus and a giant named Rumblebuffin. They join the Narnian forces battling the Witch's army. The Narnian army prevails, and Aslan kills the Witch. The Pevensie children are then crowned kings and queens of Narnia at Cair Paravel.\n\nAfter a long and happy reign, the adult Pevensies go on a hunt for the White Stag who is said to grant the wishes of those who catch it. The four arrive at the lamppost and, having forgotten about it, unintentionally return through the wardrobe when they were looking for new adventures. When they return to England, they are children again, with no time having passed since their departure. They tell the story to the professor, who believes them and reassures the children that they will return to Narnia one day when they least expect it.\n\n==Main characters==\n*[[Lucy Pevensie|Lucy]] is the youngest of four siblings. In some respects, she is the primary protagonist of the story. She is the first to discover the land of Narnia, which she enters inadvertently when she steps into a wardrobe while exploring the Professor's house. When Lucy tells her three siblings about Narnia, they do not believe her: Peter and Susan think she is just playing a game, while Edmund persistently ridicules her. In Narnia, she is crowned Queen Lucy the Valiant.\n*[[Edmund Pevensie|Edmund]] is the second-youngest of four siblings. He has a bad relationship with his brother and sisters. Edmund is known to be a liar, and often harasses Lucy. Lured by the White Witch's promise of power and an unlimited supply of magical treats, Edmund betrays his siblings. He later repents and helps defeat the White Witch. He is eventually crowned King Edmund the Just.\n*[[Susan Pevensie|Susan]] is the second-oldest sibling. She does not believe in Narnia until she actually goes there. She and Lucy accompany Aslan on the journey to the Stone Table, where he allows the Witch to take his life in place of Edmund's. Tending to Aslan's carcass, she removes a muzzle from him to restore his dignity and oversees a horde of mice who gnaw away his bonds. She then shares the joy of his resurrection and the endeavor to bring reinforcements to a critical battle. Susan is crowned Queen Susan the Gentle.\n*[[Peter Pevensie|Peter]] is the eldest sibling. He judiciously settles disputes between his younger brother and sisters, often rebuking Edmund for his attitude. Peter also disbelieves Lucy's stories about Narnia until he sees it for himself. He is hailed as a hero for the slaying of [[Maugrim]] and for his command in the battle to overthrow the White Witch. He is crowned High King of Narnia and dubbed King Peter the Magnificent.\n*[[Aslan]], a [[lion]], is the rightful King of Narnia and other magic countries. He sacrifices himself to save Edmund, but is resurrected in time to aid the denizens of Narnia and the Pevensie children against the White Witch and her minions. As the \"son of the Emperor beyond the sea\" (an allusion to [[God the Father#Christianity|God the Father]]), Aslan is the all-powerful creator of Narnia. Lewis revealed that he wrote Aslan as a portrait, although not an allegorical portrait, of [[Jesus|Christ]].<ref>Letter to Anne Jenkins, 5 March 1961, in {{cite book|last=Hooper|first=Walter|title=The Collected Letters of C. S. Lewis, Volume III|year=2007|publisher=HarperSanFrancisco|isbn=978-0-06-081922-4|page=1245}}</ref>\n*[[White Witch|The White Witch]] is the land's self-proclaimed queen and the primary antagonist of the story. Her spell on Narnia has made winter persist for a hundred years with no end in sight. When provoked, she turns creatures to stone with her wand. She fears the fulfillment of a prophecy that \"two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve\" (meaning two male humans and two female humans) will supplant her. She is usually referred to as \"the White Witch\", or just \"the Witch\". Her actual name, \"Jadis,\" appears once in the notice left on Tumnus's door after his arrest. Lewis later wrote a [[The Magician's Nephew|prequel]] to include her back story and account for her presence in the Narnian world.\n*[[Digory Kirke|The Professor]] is a kindly old gentleman who takes the children in when they are evacuated from London. He is the first to believe that Lucy did indeed visit a land called Narnia. He tries to convince the others logically that she did not make it up. After the children return from Narnia, he assures them that they will return one day. The book hints that he knows more of Narnia than he lets on (hints expanded upon in later books of the series).\n*[[Mr. Tumnus|Tumnus]], a [[faun]], is the first individual Lucy (who calls him \"Mr. Tumnus\") meets in Narnia. Tumnus befriends Lucy, despite the White Witch's standing order to turn in any human he finds. He initially plans to obey the order but, after getting to like Lucy, he cannot bear to alert the Witch's forces. He instead escorts her back towards the safety of her own country. His good deed is later given away to the Witch by Edmund. The witch orders Tumnus arrested and turns him to stone, but he is later restored to life by Aslan.\n*[[Mr. and Mrs. Beaver]], two [[beaver]]s, are friends of Tumnus. They play host to Peter, Susan and Lucy and lead them to Aslan.\n\n==Writing==\nLewis described the origin of ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' in an essay titled \"It All Began with a Picture\":<ref>Lewis (1960). \"It All Began with a Picture\". ''Radio Times''. 15 July 1960. In Hooper (1982), p. 53.</ref>\n:The ''Lion'' all began with a picture of a Faun carrying an umbrella and parcels in a snowy wood.

[[Roger Lancelyn Green]] thinks that he might even have completed it. In September 1947 Lewis wrote in a letter about stories for children: \"I have tried one myself but it was, by the unanimous verdict of my friends, so bad that I destroyed it.\"<ref>Lewis (2004 [1947]).

Nesbit]]\".<ref>Walsh, Chad (1974). ''C. S. Lewis: Apostle to the Skeptics''. Norwood Editions. p. 10. {{ISBN|0-88305-779-4}}.</ref> After this conversation not much happened until the beginning of the next year. Then everything changed. In his essay \"It All Began With a Picture\" Lewis continues: \"At first I had very little idea how the story would go. But then suddenly Aslan came bounding into it. I think I had been having a good many dreams of lions about that time. Apart from that, I don't know where the Lion came from or why he came. But once he was there, he pulled the whole story together, and soon he pulled the six other Narnian stories in after him.\"<ref>Lewis (1960).

After the meal Lewis read two chapters from his new children's story to Green. Lewis asked Green's opinion of the tale and Green said that he thought it was good. The manuscript of ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' was complete by the end of March 1949. Lucy Barfield received it by the end of May.<ref>Hooper, Walter. \"Lucy Barfield (1935\u20132003)\".

Lewis chose [[Pauline Baynes]], possibly based on [[J.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;R. Tolkien]]'s recommendation. In December 1949, Bles showed Lewis the first drawings for the novel, and Lewis sent Baynes a note congratulating her, particularly on the level of detail. Lewis's appreciation of the illustrations is evident in a letter he wrote to Baynes after ''[[The Last Battle]]'' won the [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] for best children's book of 1956: \"is it not rather 'our' medal? I'm sure the illustrations were taken into account as well as the text\".<ref>Schakel 2002, pp. 30\u201331.</ref>\n\nThe British edition of the novel had 43 illustrations; American editions generally had fewer. The popular United States paperback edition published by Collier between 1970 and 1994, which sold many millions, had only 17 illustrations, many of them severely cropped from the originals, giving many readers in that country a very different experience when reading the novel. All the illustrations were restored for the 1994 worldwide HarperCollins edition, although these illustrations lacked the clarity of early printings.<ref>Schakel 2002, p. 132.</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nLewis very much enjoyed writing ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' and embarked on the sequel ''[[Prince Caspian]]'' soon after finishing the first novel. He completed the sequel by end of 1949, less than a year after finishing the initial book. ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' had few readers during 1949 and was not published until late in 1950, so his initial enthusiasm did not stem from favourable reception by the public.<ref>Veith, pp. 11\u201312.</ref>\n\nWhile Lewis is known today on the strength of the Narnia stories as a highly successful children's writer, the initial critical response was muted. At the time it was fashionable for children's stories to be realistic; fantasy and fairy tales were seen as indulgent, appropriate only for very young readers and potentially harmful to older children, even hindering their ability to relate to everyday life. Some reviewers considered the tale overtly moralistic or the Christian elements over-stated\u2014attempts to indoctrinate children. Others were concerned that the many violent incidents might frighten children.<ref>Veith, p. 12.</ref>\n\nLewis's publisher, Geoffrey Bles, feared that the Narnia tales would not sell, and might damage Lewis's reputation and affect sales of his other books. Nevertheless, the novel and its successors were highly popular with young readers, and Lewis's publisher was soon eager to release further Narnia stories.<ref>Veith, p. 13.</ref>\n\nIn the United States a 2004 study found that ''The Lion'' was a common read-aloud book for seventh-graders in schools in [[San Diego County, California]].<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Fisher, Douglas, James Flood, Diane Lapp, and Nancy Frey |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207031123/http://www.fisherandfrey.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/rt-read-alouds.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-07 |year=2004 |title= Interactive Read-Alouds: Is There a Common Set of Implementation Practices? |journal=[[The Reading Teacher]] |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages= 8\u201317|url= http://www.fisherandfrey.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/rt-read-alouds.pdf |accessdate= 2012-08-22 |doi=10.1598/RT.58.1.1}}</ref> In 2005 it was included on ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'''s unranked list of the 100 best English-language novels published since 1923.<ref name=Time2005/> Based on a 2007 online poll, the U.S. [[National Education Association]] named it one of \"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children\".<ref name=NEA2007>{{cite web |url= http://www.nea.org/grants/13154.htm/ |title= Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children |author= National Education Association |year= 2007|accessdate=2012-08-22}}</ref> In 2012 it was ranked number five among all-time children's novels in a survey published by ''[[School Library Journal]]'', a monthly with primarily U.S. audience.<ref name=SLJChapter2012>{{cite web |url= http://blog.schoollibraryjournal.com/afuse8production/2012/07/07/top-100-chapter-book-poll-results |title= Top 100 Chapter Book Poll Results |author= Bird, Elizabeth |publisher= A Fuse #8 Production.

Most reprintings of the novels until the 1980s also reflected the order of original publication. In 1980 [[HarperCollins]] published the series ordered by the chronology of the events in the novels. This meant ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'' was numbered as the first in the series. HarperCollins, which had previously published editions of the novels outside the United States, also acquired the rights to publish the novels in that country in 1994 and used this sequence in the uniform worldwide edition published in that year.<ref>Schakel, pp. 13\u201316.</ref>\n\nLaurence Krieg, a young fan, wrote to Lewis, asking him to adjudicate between his views of the correct sequence of reading the novels\u2014according to the sequence of events, with ''The Magician's Nephew'' being placed first\u2014and that of his mother, who thought the order of publication (with ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' being placed first) was more appropriate. Lewis wrote back, appearing to support the younger Krieg's views, although he did point out that the views of the author may not be the best guidance, and that perhaps it would not matter what order they were read in.<ref>Schakel, pp. 17\u201318.</ref>\n\nHowever publication order reflects Lewis's strategy for drawing readers into the world of Narnia. In the book he wrote first, [[Lucy Pevensie]]'s discovery of the wardrobe that opens onto a forest and a mysterious lamp post creates a sense of suspense about an unknown land she is discovering for the first time. This would be anticlimactic if the reader has already been introduced to Narnia in ''The Magician's Nephew'' and already knows the origins of Narnia, the wardrobe and the lamp post. Indeed, the narrative of ''The Magician's Nephew'' appears to assume that the reader has already read ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' and is now being shown its beginnings.<ref>Schakel, pp. 19\u201321.</ref>\n\nPaul Ford cites several scholars who have weighed in against the decision of HarperCollins to present the books in the order of their internal chronology,<ref>Ford, pp. xxiii\u2013xxiv.</ref> and continues, \"most scholars disagree with this decision and find it the least faithful to Lewis's deepest intentions\".<ref>Ford, p. 24.</ref>\n\n==Allusions==\nLewis wrote that \"The Narnian books are not as much allegory as supposal.

Norse tradition mythologises a \"great winter\", known as the [[Fimbulwinter]], said to precede [[Ragnar\u00f6k]].

S. Lewis's ''The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe'' is the theme of [[Christianity]]. Various aspects of characters and events in the novel reflect biblical ideas from Christianity. The lion [[Aslan]] is one of the largest examples, as his death is very similar to that of [[Jesus]] Christ. While many readers made this connection, Lewis denied that the themes of Christianity were intentional, saying that his writing began by picturing images of characters, and the rest just came about through the writing process.<ref name=\"Full Text Finder\">{{Cite journal|title=Full Text Finder|doi=10.1353/sli.2013.0010}}</ref> While Lewis denied intentionally making the story a strictly Christian [[Theological fiction|theological novel]], he did admit that it could help young children accept Christianity into their lives when they were older.<ref name=\"Russell 59\u201376\">{{Cite journal|last=Russell|first=James|date=2009-09-27|title=Narnia as a Site of National Struggle: Marketing, Christianity, and National Purpose in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|journal=Cinema Journal|language=en|volume=48|issue=4|pages=59\u201376|doi=10.1353/cj.0.0145|issn=1527-2087}}</ref>\n\nAfter the children enter the world of Narnia through the wardrobe, [[Edmund Pevensie|Edmund]] finds himself in trouble under service of the [[White Witch]], as she tempts him with [[Turkish Delight]]s. When Edmund is threatened with death, Aslan offers to sacrifice himself instead. Aslan is shaved of his fur, and stabbed on an altar of stone. This is similar to how Jesus was publicly beaten, humiliated and crucified. After his sacrifice, Aslan is later reborn, and continues to help the children save Narnia.<ref name=\"Russell 59\u201376\"/> While this sequence of events is comparable to the death of Jesus, it is not identical to it. There are a few differences, such as the fact that Aslan did not allow himself to be killed to save the entirety of Narnia, but only to save Edmund. Aslan is also only dead for one night, while Jesus returned on the third day.<ref name=\"Full Text Finder\"/> Despite these differences, the image of Aslan and the event of his death and rebirth reflect those of the biblical account of Jesus' death and resurrection, adding to the theme of Christianity throughout the novel.<ref name=\"Full Text Finder\"/>\n\n==Differences between editions==\nDue to labor union rules,<ref name=\"Brown\">{{cite book |title=Inside Narnia: A Guide to Exploring The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe |last=Brown |first=Devin |year=2013 |publisher=[[Abingdon Press]] |isbn=978-0801065996 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780801065996 }}</ref> the text of ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' was reset for the publication of the first American edition of by [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan US]] in 1950.<ref name=LCC/> [[C.

Retrieved Apr. 1, 2020.</ref> A [[Science fiction|science-fiction]] [[Romance novel#Science Fiction romance|love story]] about [[time travel]], it describes the misadventures of a man, Jack, after he finds his pregnant wife, Patience, murdered in their apartment. Many years later, when grief has destroyed his life, chance leads him to discover a time machine, which he plans to use to save Patience. \n\nThe book's tagline, in a surreal and [[tongue-in-cheek]] style typical of Clowes, is, \"a cosmic timewarp deathtrip to the primordial infinite of everlasting love\". The book uses bright, contrasting colours to evoke atmosphere, as well as surrealistic sci-fi imagery, when Jack free-falls between dimensions and has nightmarish visions of himself outside time and space. (Clowes' visual approach in his graphic novels tends to vary between full, even gaudy colour, and muted blues and greens that create a black-and-white effect, as in ''[[Ghost World (comics)|Ghost World]]'' and ''[[David Boring]]''.)\n\n==Background and creation==\n''Patience'' is Clowes' longest book, at around 180 pages, and is the second by him, after ''[[Wilson (comics)|Wilson]]'', to not have been serialized first, either in ''[[Eightball (comics)|Eightball]]'' \u2014 his own [[comic book]] series \u2014 or elsewhere.

Many years later, when grief has destroyed his life, chance leads him to discover a time machine, which he plans to use to save Patience. \n\nThe book's tagline, in a surreal and [[tongue-in-cheek]] style typical of Clowes, is, \"a cosmic timewarp deathtrip to the primordial infinite of everlasting love\". The book uses bright, contrasting colours to evoke atmosphere, as well as surrealistic sci-fi imagery, when Jack free-falls between dimensions and has nightmarish visions of himself outside time and space. (Clowes' visual approach in his graphic novels tends to vary between full, even gaudy colour, and muted blues and greens that create a black-and-white effect, as in ''[[Ghost World (comics)|Ghost World]]'' and ''[[David Boring]]''.)\n\n==Background and creation==\n''Patience'' is Clowes' longest book, at around 180 pages, and is the second by him, after ''[[Wilson (comics)|Wilson]]'', to not have been serialised first, either in ''[[Eightball (comics)|Eightball]]'' - his own [[comic book]] series - or elsewhere. Clowes credits in the book Alvin Buenaventura, of [[Buenaventura Press]] (which has worked with several graphic novelists), with technical and production assistance. Buenaventura committed suicide in February 2016,<ref>http://blogflumer.blogspot.co.uk/2016/02/rip-alvin.html</ref> the month before ''Patience'''s release.\n\n==Film adaptation==\nOn December 13, 2016, Clowes announced that he will adapt his graphic novel ''Patience'' for [[Focus Features]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2016/12/graphic-novel-patience-movie-daniel-clowes-focus-features-1201869517/|work=Deadline|title=Focus Features Acquires Daniel Clowes\u2019 Graphic Novel \u2018Patience\u2019|date=December 13, 2016}}</ref> While promoting ''[[Wilson (2017 film)|Wilson]]'', Clowes spoke about how, unlike his previous adaptations, ''Patience'' is about the right length to fit in a film screenplay, saying, \"It\u2019s interesting \u2013 I thought that I was going to have to chop stuff, which would be the first time.

{"title_page": "Warrowen massacre", "text_new": "{{short description|Apparent mass killing in Australia}}\nThe '''Warrowen massacre''' was an apparent mass killing of [[Bunurong]] people by a group of [[Kurnai]] people in the vicinity of present-day [[Brighton, Victoria]], Australia. It is dated to the early 1830s, close in time to the founding of [[Melbourne]]. The killing was recorded separately several years later by [[William Thomas (Australian settler)|William Thomas]] and [[George Augustus Robinson]], based on testimony from Aboriginal sources. Thomas stated that at least 60 people had been killed. According to Robinson, the massacre contributed to the end of an entire Bunurong clan, allowing a Kurnai clan to take over their territory.\n\n==Background==\nEarly European settlers in the [[Western Port]] and [[Gippsland]] regions of Victoria were told that there had been a long-running conflict between indigenous groups, with \"each carrying out surprise attacks on the other and killing several people at a time\".{{sfn|Wilson|Ellender|2002|p=58}} According to Robinson, the victims of the massacre at Warrowen were the Yowengerre (or Yowenjerre) and the perpetrators were the Borro Borro Willun.{{sfn|Fels|2011|pp=255\u2013256}} There was an \"existing tenuous connection\" between the two, as their respective neighbours exchanged women for marriages.{{sfn|Wilson|Ellender|2002|p=61}} The Yowengerre (or Yowenjerre) were the easternmost clan of the [[Bunurong]] people, occupying the [[Tarwin River]] watershed and parts of [[Wilson's Promontory]].<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2014}}: \"[...] the Yowengerre, the eastern-most Boonwurrung clan, which was associated with the Tarwin River watershed and Wilson's Promontory\"</ref>{{sfn|Wilson|Ellender|2002|p=59}} The traditional country of the Borro Borro ''willun'' (clan) of the [[Gunai people|Gunai]] (Kurnai) was the [[Avon River (Gippsland, Victoria)|Avon River]] of Gippsland. The Borro Borro were surrounded by a larger group, the [[Braiakaulung people|Braiakaulung]] (Briakalung), but were more closely linked with the [[Brataualung people|Brataualung]] to the south.{{sfn|Wilson|Ellender|2002|p=60}}\n\n==Events==\n\nThe main sources for the massacre are the letters of [[William Thomas (Australian settler)|William Thomas]], the Assistant Protector of Aborigines of Port Phillip. In an 1840 letter to Superintendent [[Charles La Trobe]], he wrote that \"about four years ago 77 people were killed at Little Brighton not nine miles from Melbourne\".{{sfn|Fels|2011|p=255}} The letter listed \"events in which the Bonurong had suffered at the hands of the Kurnai\", in order to \"explain to La Trobe the deadly enmity that had existed for a very long time between the Bonurong and their eastern neighbours\". He further explained that he had \"known about these historic events almost from when he arrived in Melbourne, and that they\nformed part of the Bonurong [[Oral history|singing]]\".{{sfn|Fels|2011|pp=254-255}}\n\nIn a later report in 1849, Thomas recorded that: {{quotation|[the] blacks remember the awful affair at Warrowen (place of sorrow) near where Brighton now stands, where in 1834 nearly a quarter of the Western Port blacks were massacred by the Gippsland blacks who stole up on them before dawn of day.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Thomas|first=William|date=1849 |title=Thomas Half yearly Report |url= |location=unit 11,1850/55,PROV |publisher=VPRS 10|page= |isbn= |author-link=}}</ref>}}\n\nThomas gave further detail of the massacre in his description of an incised tree in a paper on Aboriginal monuments and inscriptions:\n{{quotation|[They have] no monuments whatever further than devices on trees where any great calamity have befallen them. On a large gum tree in Brighton, on the estate of Mr McMillan was a host of blacks lying as dead carved on the trunk for a yard or two up. The spot was called  Woorroowen or incessant weeping. Near this spot in the year 1833 or 4, the Gippsland blacks stole at night upon the Western Port or Coast tribe and killed 60 or 70 of them.{{sfn|Fels|2011|p=256}}}}\n\nWhile passing through Gippsland in 1844, [[George Augustus Robinson]] wrote in his diaries that \"the natives of Gippsland have killed 70 of the Boongerong [Bunurong] at Brighton\". His informant was Munmunginna (transcribed by Robinson as \"Mun mun jin ind\"), whose father was from the Yowengerre clan.{{sfn|Fels|2011|pp=255\u2013256}} \n\nAccording to {{harvp|Fels|2011}}, the massacre was \"well known to early settlers, is mentioned in histories of Brighton, and pioneers' accounts \u2013 it was commonplace information in early Melbourne history\".{{sfn|Fels|2011|p=255}}  Cooper states:<ref>{{cite book |title=History of Brighton, 1842{{ndash}}1925 |page=83 |date=1925 |author=John Butler Cooper |via=Bayside Library, Bayside City Council}}</ref>\n{{blockquote|The aboriginals told the settlers of a tradition which they had of a great tribal fight in the vicinity of Landcox Park.  Large numbers of those engaged were killed.  Settlers in the early days found bones, & evidences of camp fires having been numerous on the place pointed out as the scene of the fight.}}\n\n==Location==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| image1=Landcox Park, Brighton VIC.jpg\n| image2=Hurlingham Park, Brighton VIC.jpg\n| footer= Landcox Park (top) and Hurlingham Park (bottom)\n}}\nThomas named the place of the killings as \"Little Brighton\" or in the local language ''Warrowen'' (also spelt ''Warowen'', ''Worawen'', ''Worrowen'' or ''Woorroowen''), meaning \"place of sorrow\" or \"incessant weeping\". Robinson also gave Brighton as the location of the massacre.{{sfn|Fels|2011|pp=255\u2013256}} The area was one of the Bunurong's regular places of encampment, but was also used by \"anyone travelling to and from Melbourne, even though the route was outside their own country\". The Bunurong continued to use the area after the killings, as in 1843 \"Worawen\" was listed as the place of death of Worrowurk, a 28-year-old man.{{sfn|Fels|2011|p=261}}\n\nBased on accounts from early settlers, {{harvp|Fels|2011}} identifies this location with two parks in present-day [[Brighton East, Victoria|Brighton East]]. John Butler Cooper's history of Brighton states that the first European settlers found bones in the area and were told of \"a great tribal fight in the vicinity of Landcox Park\". Another account held by the Brighton Historical Society mentioned bones being ploughed up in Hurlingham Park. According to Fels, the two parks are \"practically contiguous\" and \"before being renamed separately by Europeans, they would have been the same place or space\".{{sfn|Fels|2011|p=256}} The pioneers' accounts state that the tree Thomas mentioned stood until the 1860s when it was felled by lightning.<ref>{{harvnb|Fels|2011|p=255}}: \"[T]he corroboree tree on which stick figures were incised detailing the events was still standing in the 1860s.

It is dated to the early 1830s, close in time to the founding of [[Melbourne]]. The killing was recorded separately several years later by [[William Thomas (Australian settler)|William Thomas]] and [[George Augustus Robinson]], based on testimony from Aboriginal sources. Thomas stated that at least 60 people had been killed. According to Robinson, the massacre contributed to the end of an entire Bunurong clan, allowing a Kurnai clan to take over their territory.\n\n==Background==\nEarly European settlers in the [[Western Port]] and [[Gippsland]] regions of Victoria were told that there had been a long-running conflict between indigenous groups, with \"each carrying out surprise attacks on the other and killing several people at a time\".{{sfn|Wilson|Ellender|2002|p=58}} According to Robinson, the victims of the massacre at Warrowen were the Yowengerre (or Yowenjerre) and the perpetrators were the Borro Borro Willun.{{sfn|Fels|2011|pp=255\u2013256}} There was an \"existing tenuous connection\" between the two, as their respective neighbours exchanged women for marriages.{{sfn|Wilson|Ellender|2002|p=61}} The Yowengerre (or Yowenjerre) were the easternmost clan of the [[Bunurong]] people, occupying the [[Tarwin River]] watershed and parts of [[Wilson's Promontory]].<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2014}}: \"[...] the Yowengerre, the eastern-most Boonwurrung clan, which was associated with the Tarwin River watershed and Wilson's Promontory\"</ref>{{sfn|Wilson|Ellender|2002|p=59}} The traditional country of the Borro Borro ''willun'' (clan) of the [[Gunai]] (Kurnai) was the [[Avon River (Gippsland, Victoria)|Avon River]] of Gippsland. The Borro Borro were surrounded by a larger group, the [[Braiakaulung people|Braiakaulung]] (Briakalung), but were more closely linked with the [[Brataualung people|Brataualung]] to the south.{{sfn|Wilson|Ellender|2002|p=60}}\n\n==Events==\n\nThe main sources for the massacre are the letters of [[William Thomas (Australian settler)|William Thomas]], the Assistant Protector of Aborigines of Port Phillip. In an 1840 letter to Superintendent [[Charles La Trobe]], he wrote that \"about four years ago 77 people were killed at Little Brighton not nine miles from Melbourne\".{{sfn|Fels|2011|p=255}} The letter listed \"events in which the Bonurong had suffered at the hands of the Kurnai\", in order to \"explain to La Trobe the deadly enmity that had existed for a very long time between the Bonurong and their eastern neighbours\". He further explained that he had \"known about these historic events almost from when he arrived in Melbourne, and that they\nformed part of the Bonurong [[Oral history|singing]]\".{{sfn|Fels|2011|pp=254-255}}\n\nIn a later report in 1849, Thomas recorded that: {{quotation|[the] blacks remember the awful affair at Warrowen (place of sorrow) near where Brighton now stands, where in 1834 nearly a quarter of the Western Port blacks were massacred by the Gippsland blacks who stole up on them before dawn of day.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Thomas|first=William|date=1849 |title=Thomas Half yearly Report |url= |location=unit 11,1850/55,PROV |publisher=VPRS 10|page= |isbn= |author-link=}}</ref>}}\n\nThomas gave further detail of the massacre in his description of an incised tree in a paper on Aboriginal monuments and inscriptions:\n{{quotation|[They have] no monuments whatever further than devices on trees where any great calamity have befallen them.

He was a recipient of the [[Medal of Honor]], the highest honor for valor given by the United States, and was a pioneering American aviator, polar explorer, and organizer of polar logistics. Aircraft flights in which he served as a [[navigator]] and expedition leader crossed the Atlantic Ocean, a segment of the Arctic Ocean, and a segment of the [[Antarctic Plateau]]. Byrd claimed that his expeditions had been the first to reach both the [[North Pole]] and the [[South Pole]] by air. His claim to have reached the North Pole is disputed.<ref name=\"ElWZQ\" /> He is also known for discovering [[Mount Sidley]], the largest dormant volcano in Antarctica, in 1934.\n\n==Family==\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Richard E.

His ancestors include planter [[John Rolfe]] and his wife [[Pocahontas]], [[William Byrd II]] of [[Westover Plantation]], who established [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], and [[Robert Carter I|Robert \"King\" Carter]], a colonial governor. He was the brother of [[Governor of Virginia|Virginia Governor]] and [[U.S. Senator]] [[Harry F.

He would later name a region of Antarctic land he discovered \"[[Marie Byrd Land]]\" after her. They had four children \u2013 [[Richard Evelyn Byrd III]], Evelyn Bolling Byrd Clarke, Katharine Agnes Byrd Breyer, and Helen Byrd Stabler. By late 1924, the Byrd family moved into a large brownstone house at 9 Brimmer Street in Boston's fashionable [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]] neighborhood<ref name=\":2\" /> that had been purchased by Marie's father, a wealthy industrialist.<ref name=\"zn5uY\" />\n\n===Personal life===\n\nByrd was friends with [[Edsel Ford]] and his father [[Henry Ford]], whose admiration of his polar exploits helped to gain Byrd sponsorship and financing for his various polar expeditions from the Ford Motor Company.<ref name=\"5NUPW\" />\n\n==Education and early naval career==\nByrd attended the [[Virginia Military Institute]] for two years and spent one year at the [[University of Virginia]] before financial circumstances inspired his transfer to the [[United States Naval Academy]], where he was appointed as a [[Midshipman|midshipman]] on May 28, 1908.<ref name=\"va3U5\" />   While at the Naval Academy, he suffered two injuries to this right ankle (one was by playing football and the other was while dismounting gymnastic rings during a competition).  Although he was allowed to remain at the Academy, his injuries eventually led to his forced retirement from the Navy in 1916.  \n\nOn June 8, 1912, Byrd graduated from the Naval Academy and was commissioned an [[Ensign (rank)#United States|ensign]] in the United States Navy. On July 14, 1912, he was assigned to the battleship [[USS Wyoming (BB-32)|USS ''Wyoming'']].  During service in the Caribbean Sea, Byrd received his first letter of commendation, and later a [[Lifesaving Medal|Silver Lifesaving Medal]], for twice plunging fully clothed to the rescue of a sailor who had fallen overboard.  In April 1914 he transferred to the armored cruiser [[USS Washington (ACR-11)|USS ''Washington'']] and served in Mexican waters in June following the [[United States occupation of Veracruz|American intervention]] in April.\n\nHis next assignment was to the gunboat [[USS Dolphin (PG-24)|USS ''Dolphin'']], which also served as the yacht of the Secretary of the Navy.  This assignment brought Byrd into contact with high-ranking officials and dignitaries including then [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] [[Franklin Roosevelt]].  He was promoted to the rank of [[lieutenant (junior grade)]] on June 8, 1915.  During Byrd's assignment to ''Dolphin'' she was commanded by future [[Fleet admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]] [[William D. Leahy]], who served as [[Chief of Naval Operations]] during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"eitvO\" />   Byrd's last assignment before forced retirement was to the presidential yacht [[USS Mayflower (PY-1)|USS ''Mayflower'']].\n\nOn March 15, 1916, Byrd, much to his frustration, was medically retired on three quarters pay for an ankle injury he suffered on board ''Mayflower''.  Shortly afterwards, he was assigned as the Inspector and Instructor for the [[Rhode Island Naval Militia]] in Providence, Rhode Island.<ref name=\"fmg93\" />  On December 14, 1916, he was commissioned as a commander in the Rhode Island Naval Militia.<ref name=\"CLCLA\" />  In this position he was commended by Brigadier General [[Charles Wheaton Abbot Jr.|Charles W. Abbot]], the Adjutant General of Rhode Island, with making great strides in improving the efficiency of the Rhode Island Naval Militia.  On April 25, 1928, by act of the Rhode Island General Assembly, he was promoted to captain in the Rhode Island Naval Militia in recognition of his flight to the North Pole in 1926.<ref name=\"AVXRl\" />\n\n==First World War==\n[[File:Richard Byrd in flight jacket, 1920s (exbt-iceberg-47).jpg|thumb|upright|Richard Byrd in flight jacket, 1920s]]\nShortly after the entry of the United States into the First World War in April 1917, Byrd oversaw the mobilization of the Rhode Island Naval Militia.  He was then recalled to active duty and was assigned to the Office of Naval Operations and served in a desk job as secretary and organizer of the Navy Department Commission on Training Camps.  In the autumn of 1917 he was sent naval aviation school at [[Pensacola Naval Air Station|Pensacola, Florida]].  He qualified as a Naval Aviator (number 608) in June 1918.<ref name=\"jYcqJ\" />  He then commanded naval air forces at [[Naval Air Station Halifax]] in [[Nova Scotia]], Canada from July 1918 until the armistice in November.  In that assignment he was promoted to the permanent rank of lieutenant and the temporary rank of lieutenant commander.<ref name=\"Who pg. 386\" />\n\nFor his services during the war, he received a letter of commendation from Secretary of the Navy [[Josephus Daniels]], which was after World War II converted to a [[Navy Commendation Medal]].\n\n==Post war==\nAfter the war, Byrd volunteered to be a crewmember in the U.S. Navy's 1919 aerial [[Transatlantic flight|transatlantic]] crossing.   This mission was historic as it was the first time the Atlantic Ocean would by crossed by an aircraft.   It was decided that only men who had not served overseas would be allowed on the mission.  Unfortunately for Byrd, his tour of duty in New Foundland was considered overseas service.  Byrd was, however, able to make a valuable contribution as his expertise in aerial navigation resulted in his appointment to plan the flight path of the mission.  Of the three [[flying boats]] (NC-1, NC-3 and NC-4) that started from New Foundland, only Lieutenant Commander [[Albert Cushing Read|Albert Read]]'s [[NC-4]] completed the trip on May 18, 1919, achieving the first ever transatlantic flight.<ref name=\"oqTJ3\" />\n\nIn 1921 Byrd volunteered to attempt a solo non-stop crossing of the Atlantic Ocean - prefiguring [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s historic flight by six years.  Byrd's ambition was dashed by then acting [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.]], who felt the risks outweighed the potential rewards.  Byrd was then assigned to the ill fated dirigible [[ZR-2|''ZR-2'']] (formerly known by the British designation of ''R-38'').  As fate would have it, Byrd missed his train to take him to the airship on August 24, 1921.  The airship broke apart in midair, killing 44 of 49 crewmembers on board.  Byrd lost several friends in the accident and was involved in the subsequent recovery operations and investigation.  The accident affected him deeply and inspired him to make safety a top priority in all of his future expeditions.\n\nDue to reductions in the Navy after the First World War, Byrd reverted to the rank of lieutenant at the end of 1921.\n\nDuring the summer of 1923 then Lieutenant Byrd and a group of volunteer Navy veterans of the First World War helped found the [[Naval Air Station Squantum|Naval Reserve Air Station]] (NRAS) at [[Squantum Point]] near Boston, using an unused First World War seaplane hangar which had remained more-or-less intact after the [[Victory Destroyer Plant]] shipyard was built on the site. NRAS Squantum was commissioned on August 15, 1923, and is considered to have been the first air base in the Naval Reserve program.<ref name=\"Rpfen\" />\n\nByrd commanded the aviation unit of the arctic expedition to North Greenland led by [[Donald B. MacMillan]] from June to October 1925.<ref name=\"Who pg. 386\" />  It was during this expedition that Byrd made the acquaintance of Navy Chief Aviation Pilot [[Floyd Bennett]] and Norwegian pilot [[Bernt Balchen]].  Bennett would serve as his pilot in his flight to the North Pole the next year.  Balchen, who's knowledge of arctic flight operations proved invaluable, would be the primary pilot on Byrd's flight to the South Pole in 1929.\n\n{{anchor|1926 North Pole flight}}\n\n==1926 North Pole flight==\n[[File:Fokker F.VII plane of Byrd-Bennett in flight in 1926.jpg|thumb|right|The Fokker F.VII of Byrd and Bennett in flight.]]\nOn May 9, 1926, Byrd and Navy [[Chief Petty Officer|Chief Aviation Pilot]] [[Floyd Bennett]] attempted a flight over the North Pole in a [[Fokker F.VII|Fokker F.VIIa/3m]] Tri-motor monoplane named ''Josephine Ford'' after the daughter of [[Ford Motor Company]] president [[Edsel Ford]], who helped finance the expedition. The flight left from [[Spitsbergen]] (Svalbard) and returned to its take-off airfield, lasting fifteen hours and fifty-seven minutes, including 13 minutes spent circling at their Farthest North.<ref name=\":2\" /> Byrd and Bennett claimed to have reached the North Pole, a distance of 1,535 miles (1,335 [[nautical mile]]s).<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nWhen he returned to the United States from the Arctic, Byrd became a national hero. Congress passed a special act on December 21, 1926, promoting him to the rank of commander and awarding both him and Floyd Bennett the [[Medal of Honor]].<ref name=\"bJpsT\" /> Bennett was promoted to the [[warrant officer]] rank of Machinist. Byrd and Bennett were presented with [[Tiffany Cross Medal of Honor|Tiffany Cross]] versions of the Medal of Honor on March 5, 1927 at the [[White House]] by President [[Calvin Coolidge]].<ref name=\"b3RS8\" />\n\n===Controversy===\n[[File:Fokker FVIIa3m wiki.jpg|thumb|left|The Fokker FVIIa/3M \u2013 \"Josephine Ford\", on display at [[The Henry Ford|The Henry Ford Museum]] ]]\nSince 1926, there have been doubts raised, defenses made, and heated controversy over whether or not Byrd actually reached the North Pole. In 1958, [[Norwegian-American]] aviator and explorer [[Bernt Balchen]] cast doubt on Byrd's claim on the basis of his knowledge of the airplane's speed.<ref name=\"gookz\" /> Balchen claimed that Bennett had confessed to him months after the flight that he and Byrd had not reached the pole.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"Nash\" /> Bennett died on April 25, 1928, during a flight to rescue downed aviators in Greenland. However, Bennett had started a memoir, given numerous interviews, and wrote an article for an aviation magazine about the flight before his death that all confirmed Byrd's version of the flight.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe 1996 release of Byrd's diary of the May 9, 1926 flight revealed erased (but still legible) sextant sights that sharply differ with Byrd's later June 22 typewritten official report to the National Geographic Society. Byrd took a sextant reading of the Sun at 7:07:10 GCT. His erased diary record shows the apparent (observed) solar altitude to have been 19\u00b025'30\", while his later official typescript reports the same 7:07:10 apparent solar altitude to have been 18\u00b018'18\".<ref name=\"vLD1b\" /> On the basis of this and other data in the diary, [[Dennis Rawlins]] concluded that Byrd steered accurately, and flew about eighty percent of the distance to the Pole before turning back because of an engine oil leak, but later falsified his official report to support his claim of reaching the pole.<ref name=\"6gYQw\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAccepting that the conflicting data in the typed report's flight times indeed require both northward and southward [[ground speed]]s greater than the flight's eighty-five mph [[airspeed]], a Byrd defender posits a westerly-moving [[anticyclone]] that tailwind-boosted Byrd's ground speed on both outward and inward legs, allowing the distance claimed to be covered in the time claimed (the theory is based on rejecting handwritten sextant data in favor of typewritten alleged dead-reckoning data<ref name=\"fukGs\" /><ref name=\"fC461\" />). This suggestion has been challenged by [[Dennis Rawlins]] who adds that the sextant data in the long unavailable original official typewritten report are all expressed to 1\", a precision not possible on Navy sextants of 1926 and not the precision of the sextant data in Byrd's diary for 1925 or the 1926 flight, which was normal (half or quarter of a minute of arc).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIf Byrd and Bennett did not reach the North Pole, then the first flight over the Pole occurred a few days later, on May 12, 1926, with the flight of the [[airship]] ''[[Norge (airship)|Norge]]'' that flew from [[Spitsbergen]] (Svalbard) to [[Alaska]] nonstop with a crew including [[Roald Amundsen]], [[Umberto Nobile]], [[Oscar Wisting]], and [[Lincoln Ellsworth]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"kAWPY\" />\n\n==1927 Trans-Atlantic flight==\n[[File:Lt com byrd and aircraft.jpg|right|thumb|Lt. Com. Byrd and aircraft]]\nIn 1927, Byrd announced he had the backing of the [[American Trans-Oceanic Company]], which had been established in 1914 by department-store magnate [[Rodman Wanamaker]] for the purpose of building aircraft to complete non-stop flights across the Atlantic Ocean. Byrd was one of several aviators who attempted to win the [[Orteig Prize]] in 1927 for making the first nonstop flight between the United States and France.{{citation needed|date = March 2017}}\n\nOnce again Byrd named Floyd Bennett as his chief pilot, with Norwegian [[Bernt Balchen]], [[Bert Acosta]], and Lieutenant [[George Otto Noville|George Noville]] as other crewmembers. During a practice takeoff with Tony Fokker at the controls and Bennett in the co-pilot seat, the [[Fokker F.VII|Fokker Trimotor]] airplane, ''[[America (airplane)|America]]'', crashed, severely injuring Bennett and slightly injuring Byrd. As the plane was being repaired, [[Charles Lindbergh]] won the prize by completing his historic flight on May 21, 1927. (Coincidentally, in 1925, then [[United States Army Air Service|Army Air Service Reserve Corps]] Lieutenant Charles Lindbergh had applied to serve as a pilot on Byrd's North Pole expedition, but, apparently, his bid came too late.)<ref name=\"Berg\" />\n\nByrd continued with his quest to cross the Atlantic non-stop, naming Balchen to replace Bennett, who had not yet fully recovered from his injuries, as chief pilot. Byrd, Balchen, Acosta, and Noville flew from Roosevelt Field [[East Garden City, New York]] in the ''America'' on June 29, 1927.  On board was mail from the US Postal Service to demonstrate the practicality of aircraft.  Arriving over France the next day, they were prevented from landing in Paris by cloud cover; they returned to the coast of [[Normandy]] and crash-landed near the beach at [[Ver-sur-Mer]] (known as [[Gold Beach]] during the [[Normandy Invasion]] on June 6, 1944) without fatalities on July 1, 1927.<ref name=\"ucqIu\" />  In France, Byrd and his crew were received as heroes and Byrd was invested as an Officer of the French [[Legion of Honor]] by Prime Minister [[Raymond Poincare]] on July 6.<ref name=\"6SieQ\" />\n\nAfter their return to the United States, an elaborate dinner in their honor in New York City on July 19.  Byrd and Noville were awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] by Secretary of the Navy [[Curtis D. Wilbur]] at the dinner.<ref name=\"iNgXi\" /> Acosta and Balchen did not receive the Distinguished Flying Cross because, at that time, it could only be awarded to members of the armed services and not to civilians.{{citation needed|date = March 2017}}\n\nByrd wrote an article for the August 1927 edition of ''Popular Science Monthly'' in which he accurately predicted that while specially modified aircraft with one to three crewmen would fly the Atlantic non-stop, it would be another 20 years before it would be realized on a commercial scale.<ref name=\"mheH3\" />\n\n==Early Antarctic expeditions==\n\n===First Antarctic expedition (1928\u20131930)===\n[[File:Remains of Fokker aircraft, First Byrd Expedition.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Remains of Fokker aircraft in the [[Rockefeller Mountains]], Antarctica in 1993]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-09158, Expeditionsschiff Byrds.jpg|thumb|left|Byrd's expedition]]\nIn 1928, Byrd began his [[Byrd Antarctic Expedition Medal|first expedition]] to the [[Antarctic]] involving two ships and three airplanes: Byrd's Flagship was the [[City of New York (1885 ship)|''City of New York'']] (a Norwegian sealing ship previously named ''Samson'' that had come into fame as a ship some claimed was in the vicinity of the [[RMS Titanic]] when the latter was sinking) and the [[Vamar Shipwreck Site|''Eleanor Bolling'']] (named after Byrd's mother); a [[Ford Trimotor]] airplane called the ''[[Floyd Bennett]]'' (named after the recently deceased pilot of Byrd's previous expeditions) flown by [[Dean Smith (American pioneer pilot)#Byrd expedition|Dean Smith]]; a [[Fairchild Aircraft|Fairchild]] [[Fairchild FC-2|FC-2W2]], NX8006, built 1928, named \"Stars And Stripes\" (now displayed at the [[Virginia Aviation Museum]], on loan from the [[National Air and Space Museum]]); and a Fokker Universal monoplane called the ''Virginia'' (Byrd's birth state). A base camp named \"[[Little America (exploration base)|Little America]]\" was constructed on the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] and scientific expeditions by [[snowshoe]], [[dog-sled]], [[snowmobile]], and [[airplane]] began.<ref name=\":6\" />   In order to increase the interest of youth in arctic exploration, a 19-year-old American [[Boy Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scout]], [[Paul Siple|Paul Allman Siple]], was chosen to accompany the expedition.  Siple would go on to earn an doctorate degree and was probably the only person, other than Byrd himself, to participate in all five of Byrd's Antarctic expeditions.\n\nPhotographic expeditions and geological surveys were undertaken for the duration of that summer, and constant radio communications were maintained with the outside world. After their first winter, their expeditions were resumed, and on November 28, 1929, the first flight to the South Pole and back was launched. Byrd, along with pilot [[Bernt Balchen]], co-pilot/radioman [[Harold June]], and photographer [[Ashley Chadbourne McKinley|Ashley McKinley]], flew the ''Floyd Bennett'' to the South Pole and back in 18 hours, 41 minutes. They had difficulty gaining enough altitude, and they had to dump empty gas tanks, as well as their emergency supplies, in order to achieve the altitude of the Polar Plateau, but they were ultimately successful.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n[[File:Richard-E-Byrd-0893e7.jpg|thumb|right|Admiral Byrd (circa 1955)]]\n\nAs a result of his acheivement, Byrd was promoted to the rank of [[rear admiral]] by a special act of Congress on December 21, 1929. As he was only 41 years old at the time, this promotion made Byrd the youngest admiral in the history of the United States Navy.<ref name=\"1GPaH\" />  By way of comparison, none of his Annapolis classmates would become admirals until 1942, after 30 years of commissioned service.  He is one of only three persons, one being Admiral [[David Dixon Porter]] and the other being arctic explorer [[Donald Baxter MacMillan]], to have been promoted to the rank of rear admiral in the United States Navy without having first held the rank of captain.\n\nAfter a further summer of exploration, the expedition returned to North America on June 18, 1930.  Unlike the 1926 flight, this expedition was honored with the gold medal of the [[American Geographical Society]]. This was also seen in the film ''[[With Byrd at the South Pole]]'' (1930) which covered his trip there.\n\nByrd, by then an internationally recognized, pioneering American polar explorer and aviator, served for a time as Honorary National President (1931\u20131935) of [[Pi Gamma Mu]], the international honor society in the social sciences. He carried the Society's flag during his first Antarctic expedition to dramatize the spirit of adventure into the unknown, characterizing both the natural and social sciences.<ref name=\"Richard E. Byrd 1888-1957\" /><ref name=\"Byrd Antarctic Expedition III\" />\n\nIn order to finance and gain both political and public support for his expeditions, Byrd actively cultivated relationships with many powerful individuals.  These individuals included, but were not limited to, President [[Franklin Roosevelt]], [[Henry Ford]], [[Edsel Ford]], [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]] and [[Vincent Astor]].  As a token of his gratitude, Byrd named geographic features in the Antarctic after his supporters.\n\n===Second Antarctic expedition===\nOn his second expedition in 1934, Byrd spent five winter months alone operating a [[meteorology|meteorological]] station, Advance Base, from which he narrowly escaped with his life after suffering [[carbon monoxide]] poisoning from a poorly ventilated stove. Unusual radio transmissions from Byrd finally began to alarm the men at the base camp, who then attempted to go to Advance Base. The first two trips were failures due to darkness, snow, and mechanical troubles. Finally, [[Thomas Poulter]], [[E.J. Demas]], and [[Amory Waite]] arrived at Advance Base, where they found Byrd in poor physical health. The men remained at Advance Base until October 12 when an airplane from the base camp picked up Dr. Poulter and Byrd. The rest of the men returned to base camp with the tractor.<ref name=\":2\" /> This expedition is described by Byrd in his autobiography ''Alone''. It is also commemorated in a U.S. postage stamp issued at the time, and a considerable amount of mail using it was sent from Byrd's base at [[Little America (exploration base)|Little America]].\n\nA CBS radio station, KFZ,  was set up on the base camp ship, the [[USS Bear|''Bear of Oakland'']] and ''The Adventures of Admiral Byrd'' were short waved to Buenos Aires then relayed to New York.<ref name=\"zw56a\" />\n\nIn late 1938 Byrd visited Hamburg and was invited to participate in the 1938/1939 German \"[[New Swabia|Neuschwabenland]]\" Antarctic Expedition, but declined. (Although Germany was not at war with the United States at this time, Adolf Hitler had been serving as [[F\u00fchrer|F\u00fchrer of the German Reich]] since 1934 and invaded Poland the next year.)\n\n===Antarctic Service Expedition (1939\u20131940)===\n{{main|United States Antarctic Service Expedition}}\nByrd's [[United States Antarctic Service Expedition|third expedition]] was the first one financed and conducted by the United States Government. The project included extensive studies of geology, biology, meteorology and exploration.  The innovative [[Antarctic Snow Cruiser]] was brought with the expedition but broke down shortly after arriving.  \n\nWithin a few months, in March 1940, Byrd was recalled to active duty in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. The expedition continued in Antarctica without him until the lasts of its participants left Antarctica on March 22, 1941.\n\n==World War II==\nAs a senior officer in the United States Navy, Byrd served on active duty during World War II.  He was recalled on active duty on March 26, 1942 and served as the confidential advisor to the Commander in Chief, United States Fleet and Chief of Naval Operations (i.e. Admiral [[Ernest J. King]]). From 1942 to 1945 he joined the South Pacific Island Base Inspection Board, which had important missions to the Pacific, including surveys of remote islands for airfields. On one assignment he visited the fighting front in Europe.\n\nOn February 10, 1945, Byrd received the [[Order of Christopher Columbus]] from the government of the [[Dominican Republic]].<ref name=\"QBmaR\" /> Byrd was present at the [[Japanese surrender]] in [[Tokyo Bay]] on September 2, 1945.   He was released from active duty on October 1, 1945.\n\nIn recognition of his service during World War II, Byrd was twice awarded the [[Legion of Merit]].<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==Later Antarctic expeditions==\n\n===Operation Highjump (1946\u20131947)===\n[[File:Alone (Richard Byrd autobiography - cover art).png|right|thumb|upright|Cover of Byrd's autobiography]]\n[[File:Richard-E-Byrd-6854e2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Admiral Byrd during ''Operation Deep Freeze&nbsp;I'' (Dec.&nbsp;1955)]]\nIn 1946, Secretary of the Navy [[James Forrestal]] appointed Byrd as officer in charge of Antarctic Developments Project.  Byrd's fourth Antarctic expedition was codenamed [[Operation Highjump]].<ref name=\":2\" />  It was the largest Antarctic expedition to date and was expected to last six to eight months.\n\nThe expedition was supported by a large naval force (designated Task Force 68), commanded by Rear Admiral [[Richard H. Cruzen]].  There were thirteen US Navy support ships (besides the flagship {{USS|Mount Olympus|AGC-8|6}} and the aircraft carrier {{USS|Philippine Sea|CV-47|6}}), six helicopters, six flying boats, two seaplane tenders, and fifteen other aircraft. The total number of personnel involved was over 4,000.\n\nThe armada arrived in the Ross Sea on December 31, 1946, and made aerial explorations of an area half the size of the United States, recording ten new mountain ranges. The major area covered was the eastern coastline of Antarctica from 150 degrees east to the Greenwich meridian.\n\nAdmiral Byrd was interviewed by Lee van Atta of [[International News Service]] aboard the expedition's command ship [[USS Mount Olympus (AGC-8)|USS Mount Olympus]], in which he discussed the lessons learned from the operation. The interview appeared in the Wednesday, March 5, 1947 edition of the Chilean newspaper ''[[El Mercurio]]'', and read in part as follows:\n\n<blockquote>Admiral Richard E. Byrd warned today that the United States should adopt measures of protection against the possibility of an invasion of the country by hostile planes coming from the polar regions. The admiral explained that he was not trying to scare anyone, but the cruel reality is that in case of a new war, the United States could be attacked by planes flying over one or both poles. This statement was made as part of a recapitulation of his own polar experience, in an exclusive interview with International News Service. Talking about the recently completed expedition, Byrd said that the most important result of his observations and discoveries is the potential effect that they have in relation to the security of the United States. The fantastic speed with which the world is shrinking&nbsp;\u2013 recalled the admiral \u2013 is one of the most important lessons learned during his recent Antarctic exploration. I have to warn my compatriots that the time has ended when we were able to take refuge in our isolation and rely on the certainty that the distances, the oceans, and the poles were a guarantee of safety.<ref name=\"SrP7R\" /><ref name=\"wVU0G\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn 1948 the U.S. Navy produced a documentary about Operation Highjump named ''[[The Secret Land]]''.  The film shows live action footage of the operation along with a few re-enacted scenes.  It won the [[Academy Award]] for Best Documentary.\n\nOn December 8, 1954, Byrd appeared on the television show Longines Chronoscope. He was interviewed by Larry LeSueur and Kenneth Crawford about his Antarctic voyages, and claimed that Antarctica, in the future, would become the most important place in the world for science.<ref name=\"d7E2H\" />\n\n===Operation Deep Freeze I (1955\u20131956)===\nAs part of the multinational collaboration for the [[International Geophysical Year]] (IGY) 1957\u201358, Byrd commanded the U.S. Navy [[Operation Deep Freeze|Operation Deep Freeze I]] in 1955\u201356 which established permanent Antarctic bases at [[McMurdo Sound]], the [[Bay of Whales]], and the [[South Pole]].  This was Byrd's last trip to Antarctica and marked the beginning of a permanent U.S. military presence in Antarctica.  Byrd spent only one week in the Antarctic and started his return to the United States on February 3, 1956.<ref name=\"FSIBZ\" />\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd (18680437653).jpg|thumb|Grave of Rear Admiral Richard E.

He was raised (became a Master Mason) in Federal Lodge No. 1, Washington, D.C. on March 19, 1921 and affiliated with [[Elisha Kane|Kane]] Lodge No. 454, New York City, September 18, 1928. He was a member of [[National Sojourners]] Chapter No. 3 at Washington. In 1930, Byrd was awarded a gold medal by Kane Lodge.<ref name=\"XeYPT\" /><ref name=\"tdIL8\" />\n\nIn 1931, Byrd became a compatriot of the Tennessee Society of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]].  He was assigned state membership number 605 and national membership number 50430.  He received the Society's War Service Medal for his service during the First World War.\n\nHe was also a member of numerous other patriotic, scientific and charitable organizations including the [[Explorers Club]], the [[American Legion]] and the [[National Geographic Society]].\n\n==Honors==\n[[File:Richard Byrd's Bust.jpg|thumb|upright|Bust of Richard E. Byrd by [[Felix de Weldon]] at [[McMurdo Station]], Antarctica.]]\n\nBy the time he died, Byrd had amassed twenty-two citations and special commendations, nine of which were for bravery and two for extraordinary heroism in saving the lives of others. In addition, he received the [[Medal of Honor]], the Silver [[Lifesaving Medal]], the [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]], the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]], and the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]].\n\nAdmiral Byrd is the only person to have three [[List of ticker-tape parades in New York City|ticker-tape parades in New York City]] (in 1926, 1927 and 1930) given in his honor.\n\nByrd was one of only four American military officers in history entitled to wear a medal with their own image on it. The others were Admiral [[George Dewey]], General [[John J. Pershing]] and Admiral [[William T. Sampson]]. As Byrd's image is on both the first and second [[Byrd Antarctic Expedition Medal]]s, he was the only American entitled to wear two medals with his own image on them.\n\nHe was the 7th recipient of the prestigious [[Hubbard Medal]] awarded by the [[National Geographic Society]] for his flight to the North Pole.  Other recipients include [[Robert Peary]], [[Roald Amundsen]] and [[Charles Lindbergh]].\n\nByrd received numerous medals from non-governmental organizations in honor of his achievements.  These included the David Livingstone Centenary Medal of the [[American Geographical Society]], the Loczy Medal of the Hungarian Geographical Society, the Vega Medal of the Swedish Geographical Society and the [[Elisha Kent Kane]] Medal of the Philadelphia Geographical Society.\n\nIn 1927, the [[Boy Scouts of America]] made Byrd an [[List of Scouts#Honorary Scouts|Honorary Scout]], a new category of Scout created that same year. This distinction was given to \"American citizens whose achievements in outdoor activity, exploration and worthwhile adventure are of such an exceptional character as to capture the imagination of boys ...\".<ref name=\"time29aug1927\" />[[File:Byrd Memorial.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Byrd Memorial on [[Mount Victoria, Wellington]], New Zealand]]\n\nAlso in 1927 the [[Richmond, Virginia|City of Richmond]] dedicated the Richard Evelyn Byrd Flying Field, now [[Richmond International Airport]], in [[Henrico County, Virginia]]. Byrd's [[Fairchild Aircraft|Fairchild]] FC-2W2, NX8006, \"Stars And Stripes\" is on display at the [[Virginia Aviation Museum]] located on the north side of the airport, on loan from the [[National Air and Space Museum]] in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 1929 Byrd received the [[Silver Buffalo Award]] from the Boy Scouts of America.  Also in 1929, he received the [[Langley Gold Medal]] from the [[Smithsonian Institution]].\n\n[[Lunar crater]] [[Byrd (lunar crater)|Byrd]] is named after him, as was the [[United States Navy]] dry cargo ship {{USNS|Richard E. Byrd|T-AKE-4}} and the now decommissioned [[Charles F. Adams class destroyer|''Charles F. Adams''-class]] [[guided missile destroyer]] {{USS|Richard E. Byrd|DDG-23}}.\n\nIn [[Glen Rock, New Jersey]], Richard E. Byrd School was dedicated in 1931.\n\nOn March 31, 1934, during a regularly scheduled broadcast, Admiral Byrd was awarded the CBS Medal for Distinguished Contribution to Radio. Byrd's short wave relay broadcasts, from his second Antarctic expedition, established a new chapter of communication history. Byrd was the sixth individual to receive this award.<ref name=\"K6Qai\" />\n\nThe Institute of Polar Studies at The Ohio State University officially changed its name to the Byrd Polar Research Center (BPRC) on January 21, 1987, after it acquired Admiral Richard E. Byrd's expeditionary records, personal papers and other memorabilia in 1985 from the estate of Marie A. Byrd, the late wife of Admiral Byrd. His papers served as the nucleus for establishment of the BPRC Polar Archival Program in 1990. In 1958 the Richard Byrd library, part of the [[Fairfax County Public Library]] system opened in [[Springfield, Virginia]].\n\nRichard E. Byrd Elementary School, a Department of Defense School located in Negishi (Yokohama, Japan)  opened on September 20, 1948. The name was changed to R.E. Byrd Elementary School on April 5, 1960.\n\nMemorials to Byrd can be found in two cities in New Zealand ([[Wellington]] and [[Dunedin]]). Byrd used New Zealand as his departure point for several of his Antarctic expeditions.\n\nThe fiftieth anniversary of Byrd's first flight over the South Pole was commemorated in a set of two postage stamps by [[Australian Antarctic Territory]] in 1979.\n\nThe long-range shortwave voice transmissions from Byrd's Antarctic expedition in 1934 was named an [[List of IEEE milestones|IEEE Milestone]] in 2001.<ref name=\"mG3dc\" />\n{{clear}}\nAdmiral Richard E. Byrd Middle School, located in [[Frederick County, Virginia]], was opened in 2005, and is decorated with pictures and letters from Byrd's life and career.\n\nHe was inducted into [[Phi Beta Kappa]] as an honorary member at the University of Virginia.<ref name=\"bUHQL\" />\n\nByrd was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the [[San Diego Air & Space Museum]] in 1968.<ref name=\"2B1EX\" />\n\nRichard E. Byrd Middle School in Sun Valley, California is named after Admiral Byrd. The school opened in its present location in 2008 after its original location was converted to Sun Valley High School.\n\n==Military awards==\nAdmiral Byrd was one of the most highly decorated officers in the history of the United States Navy.

After flying some distance beyond this point he returned to his base at Little America. This hazardous flight was made under extreme conditions of cold, over ranges and plateaus extending nine to ten thousand feet above sea level and beyond probable rescue of personnel had a forced landing occurred. Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd, U.S.N, Retired, was in command of this flight, navigated the airplane, made the mandatory preparations for the flight, and through his untiring energy, superior leadership, and excellent judgment the flight was brought to a successful conclusion.</blockquote>\n\n===1st Distinguished Service Medal citation===\n<blockquote>The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Distinguished Service Medal to Commander Richard Evelyn Byrd Jr. (NSN: 0\u20137918), United States Navy, for exceptionally meritorious and distinguished service in a position of great responsibility to the Government of the United States, in demonstrating, by his courage and professional ability that heavier-than-air craft could in continuous flight travel to the North Pole and return.\n\nGeneral Orders: Letter Dated August 6, 1926\n</blockquote>\n\n===2nd Distinguished Service Medal citation===\n<blockquote>The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting a Gold Star in lieu of a Second Award of the Navy Distinguished Service Medal to Rear Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd Jr. (NSN: 0\u20137918), United States Navy, for exceptionally meritorious and distinguished service in a position of great responsibility to the Government of the United States as Commanding Officer of the U.S. Antarctic Service. Rear Admiral Byrd did much toward the difficult task of organizing the expedition, which was accomplished in one fourth of the time generally necessary for such undertakings. In spite of a short operating season, he established two Antarctic bases 1,500 miles apart, where valuable scientific and economic investigations are now being carried on. With the {{USS|Bear}}, he penetrated unknown and dangerous seas where important discoveries were made; in addition to which he made four noteworthy flights, resulting in the discovery of new mountain ranges, islands, more than a hundred thousand square miles of area, a peninsula and 700 miles of hitherto unknown stretches of the Antarctic coast. The operations of the Antarctic Service have been a credit to the Government of the United States. His qualities of leadership and unselfish devotion to duty are in accordance with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.</blockquote>\n\n===1st Legion of Merit citation===\n<blockquote>The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Legion of Merit to Rear Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd Jr. (NSN: 0\u20137918), United States Navy, for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the Government of the United States while in command of a Special Navy Mission to the Pacific from August 27, 1943, to December 5, 1943, when thirty-three islands of the Pacific were surveyed or investigated for the purpose of recommending air base sites of value to the United States for its defense or for the development of post-war civil aviation. In this service Admiral Byrd exercised fine leadership in gaining the united effort of civilian, Army, and Navy experts. He displayed courage, initiative, vision, and a high order of ability in obtain data and in submitting reports which will be of great present and future value to the National Defense and to the Government of the United States in the post-war period.\n\nAction Date: August 27 \u2013 December 5, 1943\n</blockquote>\n\n===2nd Legion of Merit citation===\n<blockquote>The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting a Gold Star in lieu of a Second Award of the Legion of Merit to Rear Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd Jr. (NSN: 0\u20137918), United States Navy, for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the Government of the United States as Confidential Advisor to the Commander in Chief, United States Fleet and Chief of Naval Operations from March 26, 1942 to May 10, 1942, August 14, 1942 to August 26, 1943, and from December 6, 1943 to October 1, 1945. In the performance of his duty Rear Admiral Byrd served in the Navy Department and in various areas outside the continental limits of the United States, employed on special missions on the fighting fronts in Europe and the Pacific. In all assignments his thoroughness, attention to detail, keen discernment, professional judgment and zeal produced highly successful results. His wise counsel, sound advice and foresight in planning constituted a material contribution to the war effort and to the success of the United States Navy.

He was a recipient of the [[Medal of Honor]], the highest honor for valor given by the United States, and was a pioneering American aviator, polar explorer, and organizer of polar logistics. Aircraft flights in which he served as a [[navigator]] and expedition leader crossed the Atlantic Ocean, a segment of the Arctic Ocean, and a segment of the [[Antarctic Plateau]]. Byrd claimed that his expeditions had been the first to reach both the [[North Pole]] and the [[South Pole]] by air. His claim to have reached the North Pole is disputed.<ref name=\"ElWZQ\" /> He is also known for discovering [[Mount Sidley]], the largest dormant volcano in Antarctica, in 1934.\n\n==Family==\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Richard E. Byrd.svg|upright|thumb|left|Ancestral Coat of Arms of the Byrd family]]\n\n===Ancestry===\nByrd was born in Winchester, Virginia, the son of Esther Bolling (Flood) and [[Richard Evelyn Byrd Sr.]] He was a descendant of one of the [[First Families of Virginia]]. His ancestors include planter [[John Rolfe]] and his wife [[Pocahontas]], [[William Byrd II]] of [[Westover Plantation]], who established [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], and [[Robert Carter I|Robert \"King\" Carter]], a colonial governor. He was the brother of [[Governor of Virginia|Virginia Governor]] and [[U.S. Senator]] [[Harry F. Byrd]], a dominant figure in the [[Virginia]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] from the 1920s until the 1960s; [[Richard Evelyn Byrd Sr.|their father]] served as [[Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates|Speaker]] of the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] for a time.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Marriage===\nOn January 20, 1915, Richard married Marie Donaldson Ames (d. 1974). He would later name a region of Antarctic land he discovered \"[[Marie Byrd Land]]\" after her. They had four children \u2013 [[Richard Evelyn Byrd III]], Evelyn Bolling Byrd Clarke, Katharine Agnes Byrd Breyer, and Helen Byrd Stabler. By late 1924, the Byrd family moved into a large brownstone house at 9 Brimmer Street in Boston's fashionable [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]] neighborhood<ref name=\":2\" /> that had been purchased by Marie's father, a wealthy industrialist.<ref name=\"zn5uY\" />\n\n===Personal life===\n\nByrd was friends with [[Edsel Ford]] and his father [[Henry Ford]], whose admiration of his polar exploits helped to gain Byrd sponsorship and financing for his various polar expeditions from the Ford Motor Company.<ref name=\"5NUPW\" />\n\n==Education and early naval career==\nByrd attended the [[Virginia Military Institute]] for two years and spent one year at the [[University of Virginia]] before financial circumstances inspired his transfer to the [[United States Naval Academy]], where he was appointed as a [[Midshipman|midshipman]] on May 28, 1908.<ref name=\"va3U5\" />   While at the Naval Academy, he suffered two injuries to this right ankle (one was by playing football and the other was while dismounting gymnastic rings during a competition).  Although he was allowed to remain at the Academy, his injuries eventually led to his forced retirement from the Navy in 1916.  \n\nOn June 8, 1912, Byrd graduated from the Naval Academy and was commissioned an [[Ensign (rank)#United States|ensign]] in the United States Navy. On July 14, 1912, he was assigned to the battleship [[USS Wyoming (BB-32)|USS ''Wyoming'']].  During service in the Caribbean Sea, Byrd received his first letter of commendation, and later a [[Lifesaving Medal|Silver Lifesaving Medal]], for twice plunging fully clothed to the rescue of a sailor who had fallen overboard.  In April 1914 he transferred to the armored cruiser [[USS Washington (ACR-11)|USS ''Washington'']] and served in Mexican waters in June following the [[United States occupation of Veracruz|American intervention]] in April.\n\nHis next assignment was to the gunboat [[USS Dolphin (PG-24)|USS ''Dolphin'']], which also served as the yacht of the Secretary of the Navy.  This assignment brought Byrd into contact with high-ranking officials and dignitaries including then [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] [[Franklin Roosevelt]].  He was promoted to the rank of [[lieutenant (junior grade)]] on June 8, 1915.  During Byrd's assignment to ''Dolphin'' she was commanded by future [[Fleet admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]] [[William D. Leahy]], who served as [[Chief of Naval Operations]] during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"eitvO\" />   Byrd's last assignment before forced retirement was to the presidential yacht [[USS Mayflower (PY-1)|USS ''Mayflower'']].\n\nOn March 15, 1916, Byrd, much to his frustration, was medically retired on three quarters pay for an ankle injury he suffered on board ''Mayflower''.  Shortly afterwards, he was assigned as the Inspector and Instructor for the [[Rhode Island Naval Militia]] in Providence, Rhode Island.<ref name=\"fmg93\" />  On December 14, 1916, he was commissioned as a commander in the Rhode Island Naval Militia.<ref name=\"CLCLA\" />  In this position he was commended by Brigadier General [[Charles Wheaton Abbot Jr.|Charles W. Abbot]], the Adjutant General of Rhode Island, with making great strides in improving the efficiency of the Rhode Island Naval Militia.  On April 25, 1928, by act of the Rhode Island General Assembly, he was promoted to captain in the Rhode Island Naval Militia in recognition of his flight to the North Pole in 1926.<ref name=\"AVXRl\" />\n\n==First World War==\n[[File:Richard Byrd in flight jacket, 1920s (exbt-iceberg-47).jpg|thumb|upright|Richard Byrd in flight jacket, 1920s]]\nShortly after the entry of the United States into the First World War in April 1917, Byrd oversaw the mobilization of the Rhode Island Naval Militia.  He was then recalled to active duty and was assigned to the Office of Naval Operations and served in a desk job as secretary and organizer of the Navy Department Commission on Training Camps.  In the autumn of 1917 he was sent naval aviation school at [[Pensacola Naval Air Station|Pensacola, Florida]].  He qualified as a Naval Aviator (number 608) in June 1918.<ref name=\"jYcqJ\" />  He then commanded naval air forces at [[Naval Air Station Halifax]] in [[Nova Scotia]], Canada from July 1918 until the armistice in November.  In that assignment he was promoted to the permanent rank of lieutenant and the temporary rank of lieutenant commander.<ref name=\"Who pg. 386\" />\n\nFor his services during the war, he received a letter of commendation from Secretary of the Navy [[Josephus Daniels]], which was after World War II converted to a [[Navy Commendation Medal]].\n\n==Post war==\nAfter the war, Byrd volunteered to be a crewmember in the U.S. Navy's 1919 aerial [[Transatlantic flight|transatlantic]] crossing.   This mission was historic as it was the first time the Atlantic Ocean would by crossed by an aircraft.   It was decided that only men who had not served overseas would be allowed on the mission.  Unfortunately for Byrd, his tour of duty in New Foundland was considered overseas service.  Byrd was, however, able to make a valuable contribution as his expertise in aerial navigation resulted in his appointment to plan the flight path of the mission.  Of the three [[flying boats]] (NC-1, NC-3 and NC-4) that started from New Foundland, only Lieutenant Commander [[Albert Cushing Read|Albert Read]]'s [[NC-4]] completed the trip on May 18, 1919, achieving the first ever transatlantic flight.<ref name=\"oqTJ3\" />\n\nIn 1921 Byrd volunteered to attempt a solo non-stop crossing of the Atlantic Ocean - prefiguring [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s historic flight by six years.  Byrd's ambition was dashed by then acting [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.]], who felt the risks outweighed the potential rewards.  Byrd was then assigned to the ill fated dirigible [[ZR-2|''ZR-2'']] (formerly known by the British designation of ''R-38'').  As fate would have it, Byrd missed his train to take him to the airship on August 24, 1921.  The airship broke apart in midair, killing 44 of 49 crewmembers on board.  Byrd lost several friends in the accident and was involved in the subsequent recovery operations and investigation.  The accident affected him deeply and inspired him to make safety a top priority in all of his future expeditions.\n\nDue to reductions in the Navy after the First World War, Byrd reverted to the rank of lieutenant at the end of 1921.\n\nDuring the summer of 1923 then Lieutenant Byrd and a group of volunteer Navy veterans of the First World War helped found the [[Naval Air Station Squantum|Naval Reserve Air Station]] (NRAS) at [[Squantum Point]] near Boston, using an unused First World War seaplane hangar which had remained more-or-less intact after the [[Victory Destroyer Plant]] shipyard was built on the site. NRAS Squantum was commissioned on August 15, 1923, and is considered to have been the first air base in the Naval Reserve program.<ref name=\"Rpfen\" />\n\nByrd commanded the aviation unit of the arctic expedition to North Greenland led by [[Donald B. MacMillan]] from June to October 1925.<ref name=\"Who pg. 386\" />  It was during this expedition that Byrd made the acquaintance of Navy Chief Aviation Pilot [[Floyd Bennett]] and Norwegian pilot [[Bernt Balchen]].  Bennett would serve as his pilot in his flight to the North Pole the next year.  Balchen, who's knowledge of arctic flight operations proved invaluable, would be the primary pilot on Byrd's flight to the South Pole in 1929.\n\n{{anchor|1926 North Pole flight}}\n\n==1926 North Pole flight==\n[[File:Fokker F.VII plane of Byrd-Bennett in flight in 1926.jpg|thumb|right|The Fokker F.VII of Byrd and Bennett in flight.]]\nOn May 9, 1926, Byrd and Navy [[Chief Petty Officer|Chief Aviation Pilot]] [[Floyd Bennett]] attempted a flight over the North Pole in a [[Fokker F.VII|Fokker F.VIIa/3m]] Tri-motor monoplane named ''Josephine Ford'' after the daughter of [[Ford Motor Company]] president [[Edsel Ford]], who helped finance the expedition. The flight left from [[Spitsbergen]] (Svalbard) and returned to its take-off airfield, lasting fifteen hours and fifty-seven minutes, including 13 minutes spent circling at their Farthest North.<ref name=\":2\" /> Byrd and Bennett claimed to have reached the North Pole, a distance of 1,535 miles (1,335 [[nautical mile]]s).<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nWhen he returned to the United States from the Arctic, Byrd became a national hero. Congress passed a special act on December 21, 1926, promoting him to the rank of commander and awarding both him and Floyd Bennett the [[Medal of Honor]].<ref name=\"bJpsT\" /> Bennett was promoted to the [[warrant officer]] rank of Machinist. Byrd and Bennett were presented with [[Tiffany Cross Medal of Honor|Tiffany Cross]] versions of the Medal of Honor on March 5, 1927 at the [[White House]] by President [[Calvin Coolidge]].<ref name=\"b3RS8\" />\n\n===Controversy===\n[[File:Fokker FVIIa3m wiki.jpg|thumb|left|The Fokker FVIIa/3M \u2013 \"Josephine Ford\", on display at [[The Henry Ford|The Henry Ford Museum]] ]]\nSince 1926, there have been doubts raised, defenses made, and heated controversy over whether or not Byrd actually reached the North Pole. In 1958, [[Norwegian-American]] aviator and explorer [[Bernt Balchen]] cast doubt on Byrd's claim on the basis of his knowledge of the airplane's speed.<ref name=\"gookz\" /> Balchen claimed that Bennett had confessed to him months after the flight that he and Byrd had not reached the pole.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"Nash\" /> Bennett died on April 25, 1928, during a flight to rescue downed aviators in Greenland. However, Bennett had started a memoir, given numerous interviews, and wrote an article for an aviation magazine about the flight before his death that all confirmed Byrd's version of the flight.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe 1996 release of Byrd's diary of the May 9, 1926 flight revealed erased (but still legible) sextant sights that sharply differ with Byrd's later June 22 typewritten official report to the National Geographic Society. Byrd took a sextant reading of the Sun at 7:07:10 GCT. His erased diary record shows the apparent (observed) solar altitude to have been 19\u00b025'30\", while his later official typescript reports the same 7:07:10 apparent solar altitude to have been 18\u00b018'18\".<ref name=\"vLD1b\" /> On the basis of this and other data in the diary, [[Dennis Rawlins]] concluded that Byrd steered accurately, and flew about eighty percent of the distance to the Pole before turning back because of an engine oil leak, but later falsified his official report to support his claim of reaching the pole.<ref name=\"6gYQw\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAccepting that the conflicting data in the typed report's flight times indeed require both northward and southward [[ground speed]]s greater than the flight's eighty-five mph [[airspeed]], a Byrd defender posits a westerly-moving [[anticyclone]] that tailwind-boosted Byrd's ground speed on both outward and inward legs, allowing the distance claimed to be covered in the time claimed (the theory is based on rejecting handwritten sextant data in favor of typewritten alleged dead-reckoning data<ref name=\"fukGs\" /><ref name=\"fC461\" />). This suggestion has been challenged by [[Dennis Rawlins]] who adds that the sextant data in the long unavailable original official typewritten report are all expressed to 1\", a precision not possible on Navy sextants of 1926 and not the precision of the sextant data in Byrd's diary for 1925 or the 1926 flight, which was normal (half or quarter of a minute of arc).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIf Byrd and Bennett did not reach the North Pole, then the first flight over the Pole occurred a few days later, on May 12, 1926, with the flight of the [[airship]] ''[[Norge (airship)|Norge]]'' that flew from [[Spitsbergen]] (Svalbard) to [[Alaska]] nonstop with a crew including [[Roald Amundsen]], [[Umberto Nobile]], [[Oscar Wisting]], and [[Lincoln Ellsworth]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"kAWPY\" />\n\n==1927 Trans-Atlantic flight==\n[[File:Lt com byrd and aircraft.jpg|right|thumb|Lt. Com. Byrd and aircraft]]\nIn 1927, Byrd announced he had the backing of the [[American Trans-Oceanic Company]], which had been established in 1914 by department-store magnate [[Rodman Wanamaker]] for the purpose of building aircraft to complete non-stop flights across the Atlantic Ocean. Byrd was one of several aviators who attempted to win the [[Orteig Prize]] in 1927 for making the first nonstop flight between the United States and France.{{citation needed|date = March 2017}}\n\nOnce again Byrd named Floyd Bennett as his chief pilot, with Norwegian [[Bernt Balchen]], [[Bert Acosta]], and Lieutenant [[George Otto Noville|George Noville]] as other crewmembers. During a practice takeoff with Tony Fokker at the controls and Bennett in the co-pilot seat, the [[Fokker F.VII|Fokker Trimotor]] airplane, ''[[America (airplane)|America]]'', crashed, severely injuring Bennett and slightly injuring Byrd. As the plane was being repaired, [[Charles Lindbergh]] won the prize by completing his historic flight on May 21, 1927. (Coincidentally, in 1925, then [[United States Army Air Service|Army Air Service Reserve Corps]] Lieutenant Charles Lindbergh had applied to serve as a pilot on Byrd's North Pole expedition, but, apparently, his bid came too late.)<ref name=\"Berg\" />\n\nByrd continued with his quest to cross the Atlantic non-stop, naming Balchen to replace Bennett, who had not yet fully recovered from his injuries, as chief pilot. Byrd, Balchen, Acosta, and Noville flew from Roosevelt Field [[East Garden City, New York]] in the ''America'' on June 29, 1927.  On board was mail from the US Postal Service to demonstrate the practicality of aircraft.  Arriving over France the next day, they were prevented from landing in Paris by cloud cover; they returned to the coast of [[Normandy]] and crash-landed near the beach at [[Ver-sur-Mer]] (known as [[Gold Beach]] during the [[Normandy Invasion]] on June 6, 1944) without fatalities on July 1, 1927.<ref name=\"ucqIu\" />  In France, Byrd and his crew were received as heroes and Byrd was invested as an Officer of the French [[Legion of Honor]] by Prime Minister [[Raymond Poincare]] on July 6.<ref name=\"6SieQ\" />\n\nAfter their return to the United States, an elaborate dinner in their honor in New York City on July 19.  Byrd and Noville were awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] by Secretary of the Navy [[Curtis D. Wilbur]] at the dinner.<ref name=\"iNgXi\" /> Acosta and Balchen did not receive the Distinguished Flying Cross because, at that time, it could only be awarded to members of the armed services and not to civilians.{{citation needed|date = March 2017}}\n\nByrd wrote an article for the August 1927 edition of ''Popular Science Monthly'' in which he accurately predicted that while specially modified aircraft with one to three crewmen would fly the Atlantic non-stop, it would be another 20 years before it would be realized on a commercial scale.<ref name=\"mheH3\" />\n\n==Early Antarctic expeditions==\n\n===First Antarctic expedition (1928\u20131930)===\n[[File:Remains of Fokker aircraft, First Byrd Expedition.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Remains of Fokker aircraft in the [[Rockefeller Mountains]], Antarctica in 1993]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-09158, Expeditionsschiff Byrds.jpg|thumb|left|Byrd's expedition]]\nIn 1928, Byrd began his [[Byrd Antarctic Expedition Medal|first expedition]] to the [[Antarctic]] involving two ships and three airplanes: Byrd's Flagship was the [[City of New York (1885 ship)|''City of New York'']] (a Norwegian sealing ship previously named ''Samson'' that had come into fame as a ship some claimed was in the vicinity of the [[RMS Titanic]] when the latter was sinking) and the [[Vamar Shipwreck Site|''Eleanor Bolling'']] (named after Byrd's mother); a [[Ford Trimotor]] airplane called the ''[[Floyd Bennett]]'' (named after the recently deceased pilot of Byrd's previous expeditions) flown by [[Dean Smith (American pioneer pilot)#Byrd expedition|Dean Smith]]; a [[Fairchild Aircraft|Fairchild]] [[Fairchild FC-2|FC-2W2]], NX8006, built 1928, named \"Stars And Stripes\" (now displayed at the [[Virginia Aviation Museum]], on loan from the [[National Air and Space Museum]]); and a Fokker Universal monoplane called the ''Virginia'' (Byrd's birth state). A base camp named \"[[Little America (exploration base)|Little America]]\" was constructed on the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] and scientific expeditions by [[snowshoe]], [[dog-sled]], [[snowmobile]], and [[airplane]] began.<ref name=\":6\" />   In order to increase the interest of youth in arctic exploration, a 19-year-old American [[Boy Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scout]], [[Paul Siple|Paul Allman Siple]], was chosen to accompany the expedition.  Siple would go on to earn an doctorate degree and was probably the only person, other than Byrd himself, to participate in all five of Byrd's Antarctic expeditions.\n\nPhotographic expeditions and geological surveys were undertaken for the duration of that summer, and constant radio communications were maintained with the outside world. After their first winter, their expeditions were resumed, and on November 28, 1929, the first flight to the South Pole and back was launched. Byrd, along with pilot [[Bernt Balchen]], co-pilot/radioman [[Harold June]], and photographer [[Ashley Chadbourne McKinley|Ashley McKinley]], flew the ''Floyd Bennett'' to the South Pole and back in 18 hours, 41 minutes. They had difficulty gaining enough altitude, and they had to dump empty gas tanks, as well as their emergency supplies, in order to achieve the altitude of the Polar Plateau, but they were ultimately successful.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n[[File:Richard-E-Byrd-0893e7.jpg|thumb|right|Admiral Byrd (circa 1955)]]\n\nAs a result of his acheivement, Byrd was promoted to the rank of [[rear admiral]] by a special act of Congress on December 21, 1929. As he was only 41 years old at the time, this promotion made Byrd the youngest admiral in the history of the United States Navy.<ref name=\"1GPaH\" />  By way of comparison, none of his Annapolis classmates would become admirals until 1942, after 30 years of commissioned service.  He is one of only three persons, one being Admiral [[David Dixon Porter]] and the other being arctic explorer [[Donald Baxter MacMillan]], to have been promoted to the rank of rear admiral in the United States Navy without having first held the rank of captain.\n\nAfter a further summer of exploration, the expedition returned to North America on June 18, 1930.  Unlike the 1926 flight, this expedition was honored with the gold medal of the [[American Geographical Society]]. This was also seen in the film ''[[With Byrd at the South Pole]]'' (1930) which covered his trip there.\n\nByrd, by then an internationally recognized, pioneering American polar explorer and aviator, served for a time as Honorary National President (1931\u20131935) of [[Pi Gamma Mu]], the international honor society in the social sciences. He carried the Society's flag during his first Antarctic expedition to dramatize the spirit of adventure into the unknown, characterizing both the natural and social sciences.<ref name=\"Richard E. Byrd 1888-1957\" /><ref name=\"Byrd Antarctic Expedition III\" />\n\nIn order to finance and gain both political and public support for his expeditions, Byrd actively cultivated relationships with many powerful individuals.  These individuals included, but were not limited to, President [[Franklin Roosevelt]], [[Henry Ford]], [[Edsel Ford]], [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]] and [[Vincent Astor]].  As a token of his gratitude, Byrd named geographic features in the Antarctic after his supporters.\n\n===Second Antarctic expedition===\nOn his second expedition in 1934, Byrd spent five winter months alone operating a [[meteorology|meteorological]] station, Advance Base, from which he narrowly escaped with his life after suffering [[carbon monoxide]] poisoning from a poorly ventilated stove. Unusual radio transmissions from Byrd finally began to alarm the men at the base camp, who then attempted to go to Advance Base. The first two trips were failures due to darkness, snow, and mechanical troubles. Finally, [[Thomas Poulter]], [[E.J. Demas]], and [[Amory Waite]] arrived at Advance Base, where they found Byrd in poor physical health. The men remained at Advance Base until October 12 when an airplane from the base camp picked up Dr. Poulter and Byrd. The rest of the men returned to base camp with the tractor.<ref name=\":2\" /> This expedition is described by Byrd in his autobiography ''Alone''. It is also commemorated in a U.S. postage stamp issued at the time, and a considerable amount of mail using it was sent from Byrd's base at [[Little America (exploration base)|Little America]].\n\nA CBS radio station, KFZ,  was set up on the base camp ship, the [[USS Bear|''Bear of Oakland'']] and ''The Adventures of Admiral Byrd'' were short waved to Buenos Aires then relayed to New York.<ref name=\"zw56a\" />\n\nIn late 1938 Byrd visited Hamburg and was invited to participate in the 1938/1939 German \"[[New Swabia|Neuschwabenland]]\" Antarctic Expedition, but declined. (Although Germany was not at war with the United States at this time, Adolf Hitler had been serving as [[F\u00fchrer|F\u00fchrer of the German Reich]] since 1934 and invaded Poland the next year.)\n\n===Antarctic Service Expedition (1939\u20131940)===\n{{main|United States Antarctic Service Expedition}}\nByrd's [[United States Antarctic Service Expedition|third expedition]] was the first one financed and conducted by the United States Government. The project included extensive studies of geology, biology, meteorology and exploration.  The innovative [[Antarctic Snow Cruiser]] was brought with the expedition but broke down shortly after arriving.  \n\nWithin a few months, in March 1940, Byrd was recalled to active duty in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. The expedition continued in Antarctica without him until the lasts of its participants left Antarctica on March 22, 1941.\n\n==World War II==\nAs a senior officer in the United States Navy, Byrd served on active duty during World War II.  He was recalled on active duty on March 26, 1942 and served as the confidential advisor to the Commander in Chief, United States Fleet and Chief of Naval Operations (i.e. Admiral [[Ernest J. King]]). From 1942 to 1945 he joined the South Pacific Island Base Inspection Board, which had important missions to the Pacific, including surveys of remote islands for airfields. On one assignment he visited the fighting front in Europe.\n\nOn February 10, 1945, Byrd received the [[Order of Christopher Columbus]] from the government of the [[Dominican Republic]].<ref name=\"QBmaR\" /> Byrd was present at the [[Japanese surrender]] in [[Tokyo Bay]] on September 2, 1945.   He was released from active duty on October 1, 1945.\n\nIn recognition of his service during World War II, Byrd was twice awarded the [[Legion of Merit]].<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==Later Antarctic expeditions==\n\n===Operation Highjump (1946\u20131947)===\n[[File:Alone (Richard Byrd autobiography - cover art).png|right|thumb|upright|Cover of Byrd's autobiography]]\n[[File:Richard-E-Byrd-6854e2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Admiral Byrd during ''Operation Deep Freeze&nbsp;I'' (Dec.&nbsp;1955)]]\nIn 1946, Secretary of the Navy [[James Forrestal]] appointed Byrd as officer in charge of Antarctic Developments Project.  Byrd's fourth Antarctic expedition was codenamed [[Operation Highjump]].<ref name=\":2\" />  It was the largest Antarctic expedition to date and was expected to last six to eight months.\n\nThe expedition was supported by a large naval force (designated Task Force 68), commanded by Rear Admiral [[Richard H. Cruzen]].  There were thirteen US Navy support ships (besides the flagship {{USS|Mount Olympus|AGC-8|6}} and the aircraft carrier {{USS|Philippine Sea|CV-47|6}}), six helicopters, six flying boats, two seaplane tenders, and fifteen other aircraft. The total number of personnel involved was over 4,000.\n\nThe armada arrived in the Ross Sea on December 31, 1946, and made aerial explorations of an area half the size of the United States, recording ten new mountain ranges. The major area covered was the eastern coastline of Antarctica from 150 degrees east to the Greenwich meridian.\n\nAdmiral Byrd was interviewed by Lee van Atta of [[International News Service]] aboard the expedition's command ship [[USS Mount Olympus (AGC-8)|USS Mount Olympus]], in which he discussed the lessons learned from the operation. The interview appeared in the Wednesday, March 5, 1947 edition of the Chilean newspaper ''[[El Mercurio]]'', and read in part as follows:\n\n<blockquote>Admiral Richard E. Byrd warned today that the United States should adopt measures of protection against the possibility of an invasion of the country by hostile planes coming from the polar regions. The admiral explained that he was not trying to scare anyone, but the cruel reality is that in case of a new war, the United States could be attacked by planes flying over one or both poles. This statement was made as part of a recapitulation of his own polar experience, in an exclusive interview with International News Service. Talking about the recently completed expedition, Byrd said that the most important result of his observations and discoveries is the potential effect that they have in relation to the security of the United States. The fantastic speed with which the world is shrinking&nbsp;\u2013 recalled the admiral \u2013 is one of the most important lessons learned during his recent Antarctic exploration. I have to warn my compatriots that the time has ended when we were able to take refuge in our isolation and rely on the certainty that the distances, the oceans, and the poles were a guarantee of safety.<ref name=\"SrP7R\" /><ref name=\"wVU0G\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn 1948 the U.S. Navy produced a documentary about Operation Highjump named ''[[The Secret Land]]''.  The film shows live action footage of the operation along with a few re-enacted scenes.  It won the [[Academy Award]] for Best Documentary.\n\nOn December 8, 1954, Byrd appeared on the television show Longines Chronoscope. He was interviewed by Larry LeSueur and Kenneth Crawford about his Antarctic voyages, and claimed that Antarctica, in the future, would become the most important place in the world for science.<ref name=\"d7E2H\" />\n\n===Operation Deep Freeze I (1955\u20131956)===\nAs part of the multinational collaboration for the [[International Geophysical Year]] (IGY) 1957\u201358, Byrd commanded the U.S. Navy [[Operation Deep Freeze|Operation Deep Freeze I]] in 1955\u201356 which established permanent Antarctic bases at [[McMurdo Sound]], the [[Bay of Whales]], and the [[South Pole]].  This was Byrd's last trip to Antarctica and marked the beginning of a permanent U.S. military presence in Antarctica.  Byrd spent only one week in the Antarctic and started his return to the United States on February 3, 1956.<ref name=\"FSIBZ\" />\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd (18680437653).jpg|thumb|Grave of Rear Admiral Richard E.

He was raised (became a Master Mason) in Federal Lodge No. 1, Washington, D.C. on March 19, 1921 and affiliated with [[Elisha Kane|Kane]] Lodge No. 454, New York City, September 18, 1928. He was a member of [[National Sojourners]] Chapter No. 3 at Washington. In 1930, Byrd was awarded a gold medal by Kane Lodge.<ref name=\"XeYPT\" /><ref name=\"tdIL8\" />\n\nIn 1931, Byrd became a compatriot of the Tennessee Society of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]].  He was assigned state membership number 605 and national membership number 50430.  He received the Society's War Service Medal for his service during the First World War.\n\nHe was also a member of numerous other patriotic, scientific and charitable organizations including the [[Explorers Club]], the [[American Legion]] and the [[National Geographic Society]].\n\n==Honors==\n[[File:Richard Byrd's Bust.jpg|thumb|upright|Bust of Richard E. Byrd by [[Felix de Weldon]] at [[McMurdo Station]], Antarctica.]]\n\nBy the time he died, Byrd had amassed twenty-two citations and special commendations, nine of which were for bravery and two for extraordinary heroism in saving the lives of others. In addition, he received the [[Medal of Honor]], the Silver [[Lifesaving Medal]], the [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]], the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]], and the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]].\n\nAdmiral Byrd is the only person to have three [[List of ticker-tape parades in New York City|ticker-tape parades in New York City]] (in 1926, 1927 and 1930) given in his honor.\n\nByrd was one of only four American military officers in history entitled to wear a medal with their own image on it. The others were Admiral [[George Dewey]], General [[John J. Pershing]] and Admiral [[William T. Sampson]]. As Byrd's image is on both the first and second [[Byrd Antarctic Expedition Medal]]s, he was the only American entitled to wear two medals with his own image on them.\n\nHe was the 7th recipient of the prestigious [[Hubbard Medal]] awarded by the [[National Geographic Society]] for his flight to the North Pole.  Other recipients include [[Robert Peary]], [[Roald Amundsen]] and [[Charles Lindbergh]].\n\nByrd received numerous medals from non-governmental organizations in honor of his achievements.  These included the David Livingstone Centenary Medal of the [[American Geographical Society]], the Loczy Medal of the Hungarian Geographical Society, the Vega Medal of the Swedish Geographical Society and the [[Elisha Kent Kane]] Medal of the Philadelphia Geographical Society.\n\nIn 1927, the [[Boy Scouts of America]] made Byrd an [[List of Scouts#Honorary Scouts|Honorary Scout]], a new category of Scout created that same year. This distinction was given to \"American citizens whose achievements in outdoor activity, exploration and worthwhile adventure are of such an exceptional character as to capture the imagination of boys ...\".<ref name=\"time29aug1927\" />[[File:Byrd Memorial.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Byrd Memorial on [[Mount Victoria, Wellington]], New Zealand]]\n\nAlso in 1927 the [[Richmond, Virginia|City of Richmond]] dedicated the Richard Evelyn Byrd Flying Field, now [[Richmond International Airport]], in [[Henrico County, Virginia]]. Byrd's [[Fairchild Aircraft|Fairchild]] FC-2W2, NX8006, \"Stars And Stripes\" is on display at the [[Virginia Aviation Museum]] located on the north side of the airport, on loan from the [[National Air and Space Museum]] in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 1929 Byrd received the [[Silver Buffalo Award]] from the Boy Scouts of America.  Also in 1929, he received the [[Langley Gold Medal]] from the [[Smithsonian Institution]].\n\n[[Lunar crater]] [[Byrd (lunar crater)|Byrd]] is named after him, as was the [[United States Navy]] dry cargo ship {{USNS|Richard E. Byrd|T-AKE-4}} and the now decommissioned [[Charles F. Adams class destroyer|''Charles F. Adams''-class]] [[guided missile destroyer]] {{USS|Richard E. Byrd|DDG-23}}.\n\nIn [[Glen Rock, New Jersey]], Richard E. Byrd School was dedicated in 1931.\n\nOn March 31, 1934, during a regularly scheduled broadcast, Admiral Byrd was awarded the CBS Medal for Distinguished Contribution to Radio. Byrd's short wave relay broadcasts, from his second Antarctic expedition, established a new chapter of communication history. Byrd was the sixth individual to receive this award.<ref name=\"K6Qai\" />\n\nThe Institute of Polar Studies at The Ohio State University officially changed its name to the Byrd Polar Research Center (BPRC) on January 21, 1987, after it acquired Admiral Richard E. Byrd's expeditionary records, personal papers and other memorabilia in 1985 from the estate of Marie A. Byrd, the late wife of Admiral Byrd. His papers served as the nucleus for establishment of the BPRC Polar Archival Program in 1990. In 1958 the Richard Byrd library, part of the [[Fairfax County Public Library]] system opened in [[Springfield, Virginia]].\n\nRichard E. Byrd Elementary School, a Department of Defense School located in Negishi (Yokohama, Japan)  opened on September 20, 1948. The name was changed to R.E. Byrd Elementary School on April 5, 1960.\n\nMemorials to Byrd can be found in two cities in New Zealand ([[Wellington]] and [[Dunedin]]). Byrd used New Zealand as his departure point for several of his Antarctic expeditions.\n\nThe fiftieth anniversary of Byrd's first flight over the South Pole was commemorated in a set of two postage stamps by [[Australian Antarctic Territory]] in 1979.\n\nThe long-range shortwave voice transmissions from Byrd's Antarctic expedition in 1934 was named an [[List of IEEE milestones|IEEE Milestone]] in 2001.<ref name=\"mG3dc\" />\n{{clear}}\nAdmiral Richard E. Byrd Middle School, located in [[Frederick County, Virginia]], was opened in 2005, and is decorated with pictures and letters from Byrd's life and career.\n\nHe was inducted into [[Phi Beta Kappa]] as an honorary member at the University of Virginia.<ref name=\"bUHQL\" />\n\nByrd was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the [[San Diego Air & Space Museum]] in 1968.<ref name=\"2B1EX\" />\n\nRichard E. Byrd Middle School in Sun Valley, California is named after Admiral Byrd. The school opened in its present location in 2008 after its original location was converted to Sun Valley High School.\n\n==Military awards==\nAdmiral Byrd was one of the most highly decorated officers in the history of the United States Navy.  He is, probably, the only individual to receive the Medal of Honor, Navy Cross, Distinguished Flying Cross and the Silver Life Saving Medal.  He also was one of a very few individuals to receive all three Antarctic expedition medals issued for expeditions prior to the Second World War.\n\n===Decorations and medals===\n<center>\n{|\n|-\n|colspan=\"9\" align=\"center\" |[[File:Naval Aviator Badge.jpg|200px]]\n|-\n|colspan=\"9\" align=\"center\" |{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Medal of Honor ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Navy Cross ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=1|type=award-star|ribbon=Navy Distinguished Service ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=1|type=award-star|ribbon=Legion of Merit ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Distinguished Flying Cross ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=2|type=award-star|ribbon=Navy and Marine Corps Commendation ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Silver Lifesaving Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Byrd Antarctic Expedition Medal (1928-1930).png|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=SECOND BYRD ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION Medal.png|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=United States Antarctic Expedition Medal (1939-1941).png|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Mexican Service Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=7|type=service-star|ribbon=World War I Victory Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=1|type=service-star|ribbon=American Defense Service Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=1|type=service-star|ribbon=European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=2|type=service-star|ribbon=Asiatic-Pacific Campaign ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=World War II Victory Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=AnArcRib.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Legion Honneur Commandeur ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=DOM Order of Christopher Columbus ribbon bar.PNG|width=106}}\n|-\n|}\n\nNote -

After flying some distance beyond this point he returned to his base at Little America. This hazardous flight was made under extreme conditions of cold, over ranges and plateaus extending nine to ten thousand feet above sea level and beyond probable rescue of personnel had a forced landing occurred.

Rear Admiral Byrd did much toward the difficult task of organizing the expedition, which was accomplished in one fourth of the time generally necessary for such undertakings. In spite of a short operating season, he established two Antarctic bases 1,500 miles apart, where valuable scientific and economic investigations are now being carried on. With the {{USS|Bear}}, he penetrated unknown and dangerous seas where important discoveries were made; in addition to which he made four noteworthy flights, resulting in the discovery of new mountain ranges, islands, more than a hundred thousand square miles of area, a peninsula and 700 miles of hitherto unknown stretches of the Antarctic coast. The operations of the Antarctic Service have been a credit to the Government of the United States. His qualities of leadership and unselfish devotion to duty are in accordance with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.</blockquote>\n\n===1st Legion of Merit citation===\n<blockquote>The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Legion of Merit to Rear Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd Jr. (NSN: 0\u20137918), United States Navy, for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the Government of the United States while in command of a Special Navy Mission to the Pacific from August 27, 1943, to December 5, 1943, when thirty-three islands of the Pacific were surveyed or investigated for the purpose of recommending air base sites of value to the United States for its defense or for the development of post-war civil aviation. In this service Admiral Byrd exercised fine leadership in gaining the united effort of civilian, Army, and Navy experts.
