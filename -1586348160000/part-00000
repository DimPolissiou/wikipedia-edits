The school's mission is to educate its students either in the [[religious studies|academic study of religion]] or for leadership roles in religion, government, and service.<ref>{{cite web |title=About HDS |url=https://hds.harvard.edu/about |website=Harvard Divinity School |publisher=Harvard University |accessdate=15 January 2020}}</ref> It also caters to students from other Harvard schools that are interested in the former field. HDS is among a small group of university-based, non-denominational [[Divinity (academic discipline)|divinity]] schools in the United States (others include [[University of Chicago Divinity School]], [[Yale Divinity School]], [[Vanderbilt University Divinity School]], and [[Wake Forest University School of Divinity]]).\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Andover Hall, Harvard Divinity School - general view.JPG|thumb|left|Andover Hall]]\nHarvard College was founded in 1636 as a [[Puritan]]/[[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregationalist]] institution and trained ministers for many years.  The separate institution of the Divinity School, however, dates from 1816, when it was established as the first non-denominational divinity school in the United States. ([[Princeton Theological Seminary]] had been founded as a [[Presbyterian]] institution in 1812. [[Andover Theological Seminary]] was founded in 1807 by orthodox [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] who fled [[Harvard College]] after it appointed liberal theologian [[Henry Ware (Unitarian)|Henry Ware]] to the [[Hollis Chair of Divinity|Hollis Professorship of Divinity]] in 1805.)\n\nDuring its first century, Harvard Divinity School was unofficially associated with [[American Unitarian Association|American Unitarianism]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Morison|first1=Samuel Eliot|title=Three Centuries of Harvard, 1636-1926|date=1964|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780674888913|pages=242\u2013243|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Three_Centuries_of_Harvard_1636_1936.html?id=ZUUf7ssp1u4C|accessdate=7 January 2016}}</ref> However, it also retains a historical tie to one of the successor denominations of American Congregationalism, the [[United Church of Christ]].\n[[File:Andover Hall.jpg|thumb|right|Andover Hall]]\n\n===Harvard Divinity School and Unitarianism===\nThroughout the 18th century, [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas of the power of reason and free will became widespread among [[Congregationalist#United States|Congregationalist]] ministers, putting those ministers and their congregations in tension with more traditionalist, [[Calvinist]] parties.<ref name=Dorrien>{{cite book|last1=Dorrien|first1=Gary|title=The Making of American Liberal Theology|date=2001|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|location=Louisville, Ky.|isbn=9780664223540|page=195|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kbJzVH7DOc4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Gary+J.+Dorrien%22#v=onepage&q=age%20of%20enlightenment|accessdate=7 January 2016}}</ref>{{rp|1\u20134}}\n\nWhen the [[Hollis Chair of Divinity|Hollis Professor of Divinity]] [[David Tappan]] died in 1803 and the president of Harvard Joseph Willard died a year later, in 1804, the overseer of the college [[Jedidiah Morse]] demanded that orthodox men be elected.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Balmer|first1=Randall|title=The Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism|date=2001|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|location=Louisville, KY|isbn=9780664224097|page=393|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=syUupeVJOz4C&pg=PA393&lpg=PA393&dq=jedidiah+morse+and+harvard&ct=result&resnum=9#v=onepage|accessdate=7 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, after much struggle, the Unitarian [[Henry Ware (Unitarian)|Henry Ware]] was elected in 1805, which signaled the changing of the tide from the dominance of traditional, [[Calvinist]] ideas at Harvard to the dominance of liberal, [[Arminianism|Arminian]] ideas (defined by traditionalists as [[Unitarian-Universalism|Unitarian]] ideas).<ref name=Dorrien/>{{rp|4\u20135}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Field|first1=Peter S.|title=Ralph Waldo Emerson: The Making of a Democratic Intellectual|date=2003|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|location=Lewiston, NY|isbn=9780847688425|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HXHbEWJacwwC|accessdate=7 January 2016|language=en}}</ref>{{rp|24}} The appointment of Ware, with the election of the liberal [[Samuel Webber]] to the presidency of Harvard two years later, led Jedidiah Morse and other conservatives to found the [[Andover Theological Seminary]] as an orthodox alternative to the Harvard Divinity School.<ref name=Dorrien/>{{rp|4\u20135}}\n\n===Today===\nToday, students and faculty come from a variety of religious backgrounds: Christian (all denominations), Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, and others. Its academic programs attempt to balance theology and religious studies\u2014that is, the \"believer's\" perspective on religion with the \"secular\" perspective on religion. This is in contrast to many other divinity schools where one or the other is given primacy ([[Yale Divinity School]], for example, emphasizes its theological program, while the majority of students at the [[University of Chicago Divinity School]] enroll in its \"religious studies\" Master of Arts program).\n\n==Degrees==\nHarvard Divinity School is [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada]] (ATS) and approved by ATS to grant the following degrees:<ref name=ats>{{cite web|url=http://www.ats.edu/MemberSchools/Pages/SchoolDetail.aspx?ID=387|title=Member Schools: Harvard University Divinity School|publisher=[[Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada]]|accessdate=2009-10-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917190508/http://www.ats.edu/MemberSchools/Pages/SchoolDetail.aspx?ID=387|archivedate=17 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n{{refbegin|2}}\n*[[Master of Theological Studies]] (MTS)\n*[[Master of Divinity]] (MDiv)\n*[[Master of Theology]] (ThM)\n*[[Doctor of Theology]] (ThD) (discontinued, see below){{refend}}\n\nIn addition to candidates for the above, many Harvard graduate students pursuing PhDs in the study of religion work closely with Divinity School faculty. These students are formally affiliated with the Committee on the Study of Religion which is made up of 50% Arts and Sciences and 50% Divinity faculty members and housed in the [[Faculty of Arts and Sciences]].\n\nIn April 2014, the faculty of HDS voted to discontinue the ThD in favor of the PhD in the study of religion in the [[Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences]] (GSAS), suspending admission to the ThD. Those previously admitted to the ThD program continue to be candidates for the ThD, with the first cohort of PhD candidates entering in fall 2015.<ref>http://hds.harvard.edu/academics/degree-programs</ref> While many PhD students in the GSAS take courses at HDS, and HDS continues to advertise the PhD in the study of religion, PhD students are formally enrolled in the GSAS and not HDS; only the GSAS at Harvard may award the PhD.\n\n==Curriculum==\nCandidates for the MTS choose among 18 areas of academic focus:\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* [[Africa]]n and [[African Americans|African American]] Religious Studies\n* [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] Studies\n* Comparative Religious Studies\n* East Asian Religious Studies\n* [[Hebrew Bible]] / [[Old Testament]]\n* [[History of Christianity]]\n* [[Hindu Studies]]\n* South Asian Religious Studies\n* [[Islam]]ic Studies\n* [[Jews|Jewish]] Studies\n* [[New Testament]] and Early Christianity\n* [[Philosophy of Religion]]\n* Religions of the Americas\n* Religion, Ethics, and Politics\n* Religion, Literature, and Culture\n* Religious Studies and Education\n* [[Theology]]\n* Women, Gender, Sexuality, and Religion\n{{refend}}\n\nCandidates for the MDiv are required to take:\n* Three courses in the theories, methods, and practices of scriptural interpretation within the student's religious tradition\n* Six courses in the history, theology, and practice of the student's religious tradition in which they are preparing to minister\n* Three courses within a religious tradition different from the one they are studying\n\n==Research and special programs==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Women's Studies in Religion Program===\nThe Women's Studies in Religion Program (WSRP) at Harvard Divinity School was founded in 1973 and was the first program offering an interdisciplinary study of women and religion. Since its founding, it has supported more than 100 scholars, from over 50 institutions of higher learning in the United States and around the world.\n\nThe WSRP promotes critical inquiry into the interaction between religion and gender, and every year the program brings five postdoctoral scholars to HDS. The research associates each work on a book-length research project and teach courses related to their research.\n\n==={{anchor|Center for the Study of World Religions}}Center for the Study of World Religions===\n\n[[Image:CSWR.png|thumb|right|Rear view of the CSWR designed by [[Josep Llu\u00eds Sert]]]]\n\nFounded in 1960 after an anonymous donation in 1957, the Center for the Study of World Religions at Harvard Divinity School is a residential community of academic fellows, graduate students, and visiting professors of many world religious traditions. The Center focuses on the understanding of religions globally through its research, publications, funding, and public programs. It welcomes scholars and practitioners and highlights the intellectual and historical dimensions of religious dialogue. {{as of|2017|July|1|df=US}}, its current director is Charles Stang, a scholar of ancient Christianity, focusing especially on Eastern varieties of late antique Christianity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hds.harvard.edu/news/2017/04/04/charles-stang-named-director-center-study-world-religions|title=Charles Stang Named Director of Center for the Study of World Religions|website=hds.harvard.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-05-30}}</ref> The Center sponsors a diverse range of educative programs, ranging from public lectures to colloquia and reading groups, student-initiated projects, and \"religion in the news\" lunches on topics of public interest. The Center's Meditation Room is used regularly by individuals and groups.\n\nThe building that houses the Center was designed by [[Josep Llu\u00eds Sert]].\n\n===Summer Leadership Institute===\nThe Summer Leadership Institute (SLI), which has been discontinued, was a two-week training program that sought to establish theological instruction and grounding for individuals engaged in community and economic development.\n\nThe program of study was divided into four modules: Theology, Ethics, and Public Policy; Organizational Development and Management; Housing and Community Development; and Finance and Economic Development. It was a full-time residential program, holding classes five days a week, with an emphasis on faith-based case studies of corporations and communities.\n\nSince the SLI's inauguration in 1998, more than 450 participants have completed the program. About 50 people were selected each year from around the United States and internationally to participate in lectures, seminars, and field visits with faculty from across Harvard and other recognized experts. Participants also developed individual plans of action, on a case-study model, applicable to the local work in their communities.\n\n===Program in Religion and Secondary Education===\nThe Program in Religion and Secondary Education is a teacher education program that prepares students to teach about religion in public schools from a non-sectarian perspective. Students in the master of theological studies or master of divinity degree programs integrate their work in religion with courses on education and public policy to understand the relationship between religion and education and to advance religious literacy within their fields of licensure.\n\nHarvard Divinity School's Program in Religious Studies and Education (PRSE) has been temporarily suspended, pending new permanent funding that will allow the program to continue and to be capable of serving more students than can currently be admitted into the program. Beginning with the 2009\u201310 academic year, no new students will be admitted to the program for at least the next two years. Students who are already in the PRSE will continue and be able to finish their degrees in normal fashion.\n\n==Andover-Harvard Theological Library==\n\n[[Image:Andover Library.png|thumb|right|Andover-Harvard Theological Library]]\n\n[[Andover-Harvard Theological Library]] was founded in 1836 and underwent expansion in 1911 when the collections of HDS and [[Andover Theological Seminary]] were combined. The Library is part of the larger Harvard University library system, which is available to all faculty, staff, and students at HDS. In September 2001, the library completed a $12-million renovation that enhanced its technology facilities and improved its information systems. Andover-Harvard participates in the [[Boston Theological Institute]] library program, which extends borrowing privileges to all members of the HDS community at any of the other BTI libraries.\n\n(From the HDS 2007-08 Catalog)\n\n*Books and bound periodicals: 485,046\n*Over 30,000 rare books (including 22 published before 1525)\n*Current serial (periodical) subscriptions: 2,981\n*Original papers of [[Paul Tillich]]\n*Audiovisual material: 633 titles\n*Historical archives of the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]]\n*Library adds 4,000 to 6,000 new volumes to its collection each year.\n*Total circulations in 2006: 46,703\n\n==Andover Hall==\n[[Image:Andover Chapel.png|thumb|right|Andover Chapel, Andover Hall, 2nd floor]]\nCompleted in 1911 at a cost of $300,000, Andover Hall was designed by Allen and Collens, a firm that focused largely on neo-medieval and ecclesiastical designs, and is the only building at Harvard built in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Collegiate Gothic]] style of architecture.<ref name = AndoverLibrary>{{cite web |title=Harvard Divinity School at the Turn of the Last Century: Building Andover Hall |publisher=Andover-Harvard Library |year=2005 |url=http://library.hds.harvard.edu/exhibits/hds-20th-century/andover-hall |accessdate=2009-03-06}}</ref>\n\nAndover Hall was commissioned by Andover Theological Seminary, which, by 1906, saw its enrollment slide and entered an affiliation with the Divinity School in 1908.

The school's mission is to educate its students either in the [[religious studies|academic study of religion]] or for leadership roles in religion, government, and service.<ref>{{cite web |title=About HDS |url=https://hds.harvard.edu/about |website=Harvard Divinity School |publisher=Harvard University |accessdate=15 January 2020}}</ref> It also caters to students from other Harvard schools that are interested in the former field. HDS is among a small group of university-based, non-denominational [[Divinity (academic discipline)|divinity]] schools in the United States (others include [[University of Chicago Divinity School]], [[Yale Divinity School]], [[Vanderbilt University Divinity School]], and [[Wake Forest University School of Divinity]]).\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Andover Hall, Harvard Divinity School - general view.JPG|thumb|left|Andover Hall]]\nHarvard College was founded in 1636 as a [[Puritan]]/[[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregationalist]] institution and trained ministers for many years.  The separate institution of the Divinity School, however, dates from 1816, when it was established as the first non-denominational divinity school in the United States. ([[Princeton Theological Seminary]] had been founded as a [[Presbyterian]] institution in 1812. [[Andover Theological Seminary]] was founded in 1807 by orthodox [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] who fled [[Harvard College]] after it appointed liberal theologian [[Henry Ware (Unitarian)|Henry Ware]] to the [[Hollis Chair of Divinity|Hollis Professorship of Divinity]] in 1805.)\n\nDuring its first century, Harvard Divinity School was unofficially associated with [[American Unitarian Association|American Unitarianism]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Morison|first1=Samuel Eliot|title=Three Centuries of Harvard, 1636-1926|date=1964|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780674888913|pages=242\u2013243|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Three_Centuries_of_Harvard_1636_1936.html?id=ZUUf7ssp1u4C|accessdate=7 January 2016}}</ref> However, it also retains a historical tie to one of the successor denominations of American Congregationalism, the [[United Church of Christ]].\n[[File:Andover Hall.jpg|thumb|right|Andover Hall]]\n\n===Harvard Divinity School and Unitarianism===\nThroughout the 18th century, [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas of the power of reason and free will became widespread among [[Congregationalist#United States|Congregationalist]] ministers, putting those ministers and their congregations in tension with more traditionalist, [[Calvinist]] parties.<ref name=Dorrien>{{cite book|last1=Dorrien|first1=Gary|title=The Making of American Liberal Theology|date=2001|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|location=Louisville, Ky.|isbn=9780664223540|page=195|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kbJzVH7DOc4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Gary+J.+Dorrien%22#v=onepage&q=age%20of%20enlightenment|accessdate=7 January 2016}}</ref>{{rp|1\u20134}}\n\nWhen the [[Hollis Chair of Divinity|Hollis Professor of Divinity]] [[David Tappan]] died in 1803 and the president of Harvard Joseph Willard died a year later, in 1804, the overseer of the college [[Jedidiah Morse]] demanded that orthodox men be elected.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Balmer|first1=Randall|title=The Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism|date=2001|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|location=Louisville, KY|isbn=9780664224097|page=393|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=syUupeVJOz4C&pg=PA393&lpg=PA393&dq=jedidiah+morse+and+harvard&ct=result&resnum=9#v=onepage|accessdate=7 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, after much struggle, the Unitarian [[Henry Ware (Unitarian)|Henry Ware]] was elected in 1805, which signaled the changing of the tide from the dominance of traditional, [[Calvinist]] ideas at Harvard to the dominance of liberal, [[Arminianism|Arminian]] ideas (defined by traditionalists as [[Unitarian-Universalism|Unitarian]] ideas).<ref name=Dorrien/>{{rp|4\u20135}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Field|first1=Peter S.|title=Ralph Waldo Emerson: The Making of a Democratic Intellectual|date=2003|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|location=Lewiston, NY|isbn=9780847688425|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HXHbEWJacwwC|accessdate=7 January 2016|language=en}}</ref>{{rp|24}} The appointment of Ware, with the election of the liberal [[Samuel Webber]] to the presidency of Harvard two years later, led Jedidiah Morse and other conservatives to found the [[Andover Theological Seminary]] as an orthodox alternative to the Harvard Divinity School.<ref name=Dorrien/>{{rp|4\u20135}}\n\n===Today===\nToday, students and faculty come from a variety of religious backgrounds: Christian (all denominations), Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, and others. Its academic programs attempt to balance theology and religious studies\u2014that is, the \"believer's\" perspective on religion with the \"secular\" perspective on religion. This is in contrast to many other divinity schools where one or the other is given primacy ([[Yale Divinity School]], for example, emphasizes its theological program, while the majority of students at the [[University of Chicago Divinity School]] enroll in its \"religious studies\" Master of Arts program).\n\n==Degrees==\nHarvard Divinity School is [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada]] (ATS) and approved by ATS to grant the following degrees:<ref name=ats>{{cite web|url=http://www.ats.edu/MemberSchools/Pages/SchoolDetail.aspx?ID=387|title=Member Schools: Harvard University Divinity School|publisher=[[Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada]]|accessdate=2009-10-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917190508/http://www.ats.edu/MemberSchools/Pages/SchoolDetail.aspx?ID=387|archivedate=17 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n{{refbegin|2}}\n*[[Master of Theological Studies]] (MTS)\n*[[Master of Divinity]] (MDiv)\n*[[Master of Theology]] (ThM)\n*[[Doctor of Theology]] (ThD) (discontinued, see below){{refend}}\n\nIn addition to candidates for the above, many Harvard graduate students pursuing PhDs in the study of religion work closely with Divinity School faculty. These students are formally affiliated with the Committee on the Study of Religion which is made up of 50% Arts and Sciences and 50% Divinity faculty members and housed in the [[Faculty of Arts and Sciences]].\n\nIn April 2014, the faculty of HDS voted to discontinue the ThD in favor of the PhD in the study of religion in the [[Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences]] (GSAS), suspending admission to the ThD. Those previously admitted to the ThD program continue to be candidates for the ThD, with the first cohort of PhD candidates entering in fall 2015.<ref>http://hds.harvard.edu/academics/degree-programs</ref> While many PhD students in the GSAS take courses at HDS, and HDS continues to advertise the PhD in the study of religion, PhD students are formally enrolled in the GSAS and not HDS; only the GSAS at Harvard may award the PhD.\n\n==Curriculum==\nCandidates for the MTS choose among 18 areas of academic focus:\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* [[Africa]]n and [[African Americans|African American]] Religious Studies\n* [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] Studies\n* Comparative Religious Studies\n* East Asian Religious Studies\n* [[Hebrew Bible]] / [[Old Testament]]\n* [[History of Christianity]]\n* [[Hindu Studies]]\n* South Asian Religious Studies\n* [[Islam]]ic Studies\n* [[Jews|Jewish]] Studies\n* [[New Testament]] and Early Christianity\n* [[Philosophy of Religion]]\n* Religions of the Americas\n* Religion, Ethics, and Politics\n* Religion, Literature, and Culture\n* Religious Studies and Education\n* [[Theology]]\n* Women, Gender, Sexuality, and Religion\n{{refend}}\n\nCandidates for the MDiv are required to take:\n* Three courses in the theories, methods, and practices of scriptural interpretation within the student's religious tradition\n* Six courses in the history, theology, and practice of the student's religious tradition in which they are preparing to minister\n* Three courses within a religious tradition different from the one they are studying\n\n==Research and special programs==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Women's Studies in Religion Program===\nThe Women's Studies in Religion Program (WSRP) at Harvard Divinity School was founded in 1973 and was the first program offering an interdisciplinary study of women and religion. Since its founding, it has supported more than 100 scholars, from over 50 institutions of higher learning in the United States and around the world.\n\nThe WSRP promotes critical inquiry into the interaction between religion and gender, and every year the program brings five postdoctoral scholars to HDS. The research associates each work on a book-length research project and teach courses related to their research.\n\n==={{anchor|Center for the Study of World Religions}}Center for the Study of World Religions===\n\n[[Image:CSWR.png|thumb|right|Rear view of the CSWR designed by [[Josep Llu\u00eds Sert]]]]\n\nFounded in 1960 after an anonymous donation in 1957, the Center for the Study of World Religions at Harvard Divinity School is a residential community of academic fellows, graduate students, and visiting professors of many world religious traditions. The Center focuses on the understanding of religions globally through its research, publications, funding, and public programs. It welcomes scholars and practitioners and highlights the intellectual and historical dimensions of religious dialogue. {{as of|2017|July|1|df=US}}, its current director is Charles Stang, a scholar of ancient Christianity, focusing especially on Eastern varieties of late antique Christianity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hds.harvard.edu/news/2017/04/04/charles-stang-named-director-center-study-world-religions|title=Charles Stang Named Director of Center for the Study of World Religions|website=hds.harvard.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-05-30}}</ref> The Center sponsors a diverse range of educative programs, ranging from public lectures to colloquia and reading groups, student-initiated projects, and \"religion in the news\" lunches on topics of public interest. The Center's Meditation Room is used regularly by individuals and groups.\n\nThe building that houses the Center was designed by [[Josep Llu\u00eds Sert]].\n\n===Summer Leadership Institute===\nThe Summer Leadership Institute (SLI), which has been discontinued, was a two-week training program that sought to establish theological instruction and grounding for individuals engaged in community and economic development.\n\nThe program of study was divided into four modules: Theology, Ethics, and Public Policy; Organizational Development and Management; Housing and Community Development; and Finance and Economic Development. It was a full-time residential program, holding classes five days a week, with an emphasis on faith-based case studies of corporations and communities.\n\nSince the SLI's inauguration in 1998, more than 450 participants have completed the program. About 50 people were selected each year from around the United States and internationally to participate in lectures, seminars, and field visits with faculty from across Harvard and other recognized experts. Participants also developed individual plans of action, on a case-study model, applicable to the local work in their communities.\n\n===Program in Religion and Secondary Education===\nThe Program in Religion and Secondary Education is a teacher education program that prepares students to teach about religion in public schools from a non-sectarian perspective. Students in the master of theological studies or master of divinity degree programs integrate their work in religion with courses on education and public policy to understand the relationship between religion and education and to advance religious literacy within their fields of licensure.\n\nHarvard Divinity School's Program in Religious Studies and Education (PRSE) has been temporarily suspended, pending new permanent funding that will allow the program to continue and to be capable of serving more students than can currently be admitted into the program. Beginning with the 2009-10 academic year, no new students will be admitted to the program for at least the next two years. Students who are already in the PRSE will continue and be able to finish their degrees in normal fashion.\n\n==Andover-Harvard Theological Library==\n\n[[Image:Andover Library.png|thumb|right|Andover-Harvard Theological Library]]\n\n[[Andover-Harvard Theological Library]] was founded in 1836 and underwent expansion in 1911 when the collections of HDS and [[Andover Theological Seminary]] were combined. The Library is part of the larger Harvard University library system, which is available to all faculty, staff, and students at HDS. In September 2001, the library completed a $12-million renovation that enhanced its technology facilities and improved its information systems.

People are encouraged to stay in contact and cooperate with their brothers and sisters, but this is not an obligation. Older siblings in these cultures are sometimes given responsibilities to watch over a younger sibling, but this is only occasional, with parents taking on the primary role of caretaker. In contrast, close sibling relationships in [[Developing country|nonindustrialized cultures]] are often obligatory, with strong cultural norms prompting cooperation and close proximity between siblings. In [[India]], the brother-sister sibling relationship is so cherished that a festival is held in observance called Raksha Bandhan. At this celebration, the sister presents the brother with a woven bracelet to show their lasting bond even when they have raised their own families.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Verma|first1=Suman|last2=Saraswathi|first2=T.S.|title=Adolescence in India|page=110}}</ref> These cultures also extend caregiving roles to older siblings, who are constantly expected to watch over younger siblings.\n\n==Throughout the lifespan==\n====Best Siblings====\nHariram & Vidya are the best brother sisters in the world\n===Infancy and childhood===\nA relationship begins with the introduction of two siblings to one another.

Assuming an age gap of only a few years, this marks the time when the older sibling is beginning school, meeting peers, and making friends. This shift in environment reduces both children's access to one another and depletes the older sibling's dependency on the younger for social support, which can now be found outside the relationship. When the younger sibling begins school, the older sibling may help him or her become acclimated and give advice on the new struggles that come with being a student. At the same time, the older sibling is also available to answer questions and discuss topics that the younger sibling may not feel comfortable bringing up to a parent.<ref>Bryant, B.K. (1992).

Mixed-sex sibling pairs often experience more drastic decreases in intimacy during adolescence while same-sex sibling pairs experience a slight rise in intimacy during early adolescence followed by a slight drop.<ref>Kim, J., McHale, S.M., Osgood, D.W., & Crouter, A.C.

Longitudinal course and family correlates of sibling relationships from childhood through adolescence. \u201cChild Development, 77\u201d, 1746-1761.</ref> In both instances, intimacy once again increases during young adulthood. This trend may be the result of an increased emphasis on peer relationships during adolescence. Often, adolescents from the same family adopt differing lifestyles which further contributes to emotional distance between one another.<ref>Cicirelli, V. G.

In this stage the common struggles of school and being under the strict jurisdiction of parents is dissolved. Despite these factors, siblings often maintain a relationship through adulthood and even old age.<ref>.Cicirelli, V. G. (1981). \u201cHelping elderly parents: Role of adult children.\u201d Boston: Auburn House.</ref> Proximity is a large factor in maintaining contact between siblings; those who live closer to one another are more likely to visit each other frequently. In addition, gender also plays a significant role.<ref>White, L. K., & Riedmann, A. (1992). Ties among adult siblings. \u201cSocial Forces, 71\u201d, 85-102.</ref> Sisters are most likely to maintain contact with one another, followed by mixed-gender dyads. Brothers are least likely to contact one another frequently.\n\nCommunication is especially important when siblings do not live near one another. Communication may take place in person, over the phone, by mail, and with increasing frequency, by means of online communication such as email and social networking. Often, siblings will communicate indirectly through a parent or a mutual friend of relative.<ref>Adams, B. N. (1968) \u201cKinship in an urban setting.\u201d Chicago: Markham.</ref> Between adult and elderly siblings, conversations tend to focus on family happenings and reflections of the past.<ref>Cicirelli, V.

New York: Springer-Verlag.</ref>\n\nIn adulthood, siblings still perform a role similar to that of friends.<ref name=\"Cicirelli\"/> Friends and siblings are often similar in age, with any age gap seeming even less significant in adulthood. Furthermore, both relationships are often egalitarian in nature, although unlike sibling relationships, friendships are voluntary. The specific roles of each relationship also differ, especially later in life. For elderly siblings, friends tend to act as companions while siblings play the roles of confidants.<ref>Connidis, I. A., & Davies, L. (1990) Confidants and companions in later life: The place of family and friends. \u201cJournal of Gerontology: Social Sciences, 45\u201d, 141-149</ref>\n\nIt is difficult to make long-term assumptions about adult sibling relationships, as they may rapidly change in response to individual or shared life events.<ref>Connidis, I.

Changing affect toward siblings and the transition to old age. \u201cProceedings of the Second International Conference on the Future of Adult Life\u201d. Leeuwenhorst, The Netherlands.</ref> Marriage of one sibling may either strengthen or weaken the sibling bond. The same can be said for change of location, birth of a child, and numerous other life events. However, divorce or widowhood of one sibling or death of a close family member most often results in increased closeness and support between siblings.\n\n==Sibling rivalry==\n{{Main|Sibling rivalry}}\nSibling rivalry describes the competitive relationship or animosity between siblings, blood-related or not. Often competition is the result of a desire for greater attention from parents. However, even the most conscientious parents can expect to see sibling rivalry in play to a degree. Children tend to naturally compete with each other for not only attention from parents but for recognition in the world.\n\nSiblings generally spend more time together during childhood than they do with parents. The sibling bond is often complicated and is influenced by factors such as parental treatment, [[birth order]], personality, and people and experiences outside the family.<ref name=\"psychtoday\">[http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-19930101-000023.html Adult Sibling Rivalry] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121211220721/http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-19930101-000023.html |date=2012-12-11 }} Jane Mersky Leder, Psychology Today, Publication Date: Jan/Feb 93, Last Reviewed: 30 Aug 2004</ref> According to [[child psychologist]] [[Sylvia Rimm]], sibling rivalry is particularly intense when children are very close in age and of the same gender, or where one child is [[Intellectual giftedness|intellectually gifted]].<ref name=\"sylviarimm\">[http://www.sylviarimm.com/article13.html The Effects of Sibling Competition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701155521/http://www.sylviarimm.com/article13.html |date=2007-07-01 }} Syliva B. Rimm, Educational Assessment Service, 2002.</ref> Sibling rivalry involves aggression and insults, especially between siblings close in age.\n\n===Causes===\nThere are many things that can influence and shape sibling rivalry. According to Kyla Boyse from the University of Michigan, each child in a family competes to define who they are as individuals and want to show that they are separate from their siblings. Children may feel they are getting unequal amounts of their parents\u2019 attention, discipline, and responsiveness. Children fight more in families where there is no understanding that fighting is not an acceptable way to resolve conflicts, and no alternative ways of handling such conflicts. Stress in the parents\u2019 and children's lives can create more conflict and increase sibling rivalry.<ref name=\"michigan\"/>\n\n====Psychoanalytic view====\n[[Sigmund Freud]] saw the sibling relationship as an extension of the [[Oedipus complex]], where brothers were in competition for their mother's attention and sisters for their father's.<ref>[http://www.freud-museum.at/e/inhalt/wissenJulietMitchell2003.html Freud Lecture: Juliet Mitchell, 2003]</ref> For example, in the case of [[Herbert Graf|Little Hans]], Freud postulated that the young boy's fear of horses was related to jealousy of his baby sister, as well as the boy's desire to replace his father as his mother's mate. This view has been largely discredited by modern research.\n\n====Parent-offspring conflict theory====\nFormulated by [[Robert Trivers]], [[Parent\u2013offspring conflict|parent-offspring theory]] is important for understanding sibling dynamics and parental decision-making. Because parents are expected to invest whatever is necessary to ensure the survival of their offspring, it is generally thought that parents will allocate the maximum amount of resources available, possibly to their own detriment and that of other potential offspring.<ref name=\"Parent-offspring conflict\">{{cite journal | last1 = Trivers | first1 = R.L. | year = 1974 | title = Parent-offspring conflict | url = | journal = American Zoologist | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 249\u2013264 | doi = 10.1093/icb/14.1.249 }}</ref> While parent are investing as much as possible to their offspring, offspring may at the same time attempt to obtain more resources than the parents are able to give to maximize its own reproductive success. Therefore, there is a conflict between the wants of the individual offspring and what the parent is able or willing to give.<ref name=\"Parent-offspring conflict\"/> An extension of Trivers\u2019 theory leads to predict that it will pay siblings to compete intensely with one another. It can pay to be selfish even to the detriment of not only one's parents but also to one's siblings, as long as the total fitness benefits of doing do outweigh the total costs.<ref>Salmon, C., & Shackelford, T. K. (n.d.). The Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Family Psychology, 57-132</ref>\n\n====Other psychological approaches====\n{{See also|Deidentification (psychology)}}\n[[Alfred Adler]] saw siblings as \"striving for significance\" within the family and felt that [[birth order]] was an important aspect of personality development. The feeling of being replaced or supplanted is often the cause of jealousy on the part of the older sibling.<ref name=\"What is Sibling Rivalry?\">Ellis-Christensen, T. (2003). What is Sibling Rivalry?. In wiseGEEK clear answers for common question</ref> In fact, psychologists and researchers today endorse the influence of birth order, as well as age and gender constellations, on sibling relationships. A child's personality can also have an effect on how much sibling rivalry will occur in a home. Some kids seem to naturally accept changes, while others may be naturally competitive, and exhibit this nature long before a sibling enters the home.<ref name=\"What is Sibling Rivalry?\"/> However, parents are seen as capable of having an important influence on whether they are competitive or not.<ref>[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/FrustAgg/levy.htm The Hostile Act] David M. Levy (1941) First published in Psychological Review, 48, 356-361.</ref>\n\n[[David Levy (psychologist)|David Levy]] introduced the term \"sibling rivalry\" in 1941, claiming that for an older sibling \"the aggressive response to the new baby is so typical that it is safe to say it is a common feature of family life.\" <ref>[http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/laurie-kramer-interview/sibling-relationships/44340.aspx Interview with Laurie Kramer] G.

Naturally, there are exceptions to this rule. What makes brother/brother ties so rivalrous? Deborah Gold has launched a new study that is not yet completed. But she has found a consistent theme running through the interviews she's conducted thus far. \"The thing that rides through with brothers that doesn't come across in other sibling pairs is this notion of parental and societal comparison. Somehow with boys, it seems far more natural to compare them, especially more than with sister/brother pairs. Almost from day one, the fundamental developmental markers--who gets a tooth first, who crawls, walks, speaks first--are held up on a larger-than-life scale. And this comparison appears to continue from school to college to the workplace. Who has the biggest house, who makes the most money, drives the best car are constant topics of discussion. In our society, men are supposed to be achievement-oriented, aggressive. They're supposed to succeed.\" <ref name=\"psychtoday\"/>\n\nSibling rivalry often continues throughout childhood and can be very frustrating and stressful to parents.<ref name=\"michigan\">[http://www.med.umich.edu/yourchild/topics/sibriv.htm Sibling Rivalry] University of Michigan Health System, June 2009</ref> Adolescents fight for the same reasons younger children fight, but they are better equipped physically and intellectually to hurt and be hurt by each other.

Longitudinal studies looking at the degree of sibling rivalry throughout childhood from Western societies suggest that, over time, sibling relationships become more egalitarian and this suggest less conflict.<ref>Buhrmester, D., & Furman, W. (1987). The development of companionship and intimacy. ChildDevelopment, 58, 1101- 1113</ref> Yet, this effect is moderated by birth order: Older siblings report more or less the same level of conflict and rivalry throughout their childhood. In contrast, young siblings report a peak in conflict and rivalry around young adolescence and a drop in late adolescence. The decline in late adolescence makes sense from an evolutionary perspective: Once resources cease and/ or individuals have started their own reproductive career, it makes little sense for sibling to continue fierce competition over resources that do not affect their reproductive success anymore.<ref>Pollet, TV, & Nettle, D.

Events such as a parent's illness may bring siblings closer together, whereas marriage may drive them apart, particularly if the in-law relationship is strained. Approximately one-third of adults describe their relationship with siblings as rivalrous or distant. However, rivalry often lessens over time. At least 80 percent of siblings over age 60 enjoy close ties.<ref name=\"psychtoday\"/>\n\n===Prevention===\nParents can reduce the opportunity for rivalry by refusing to compare or typecast their children,<ref name=\"Journal article\">[http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/parenting-issues/family-favoritism/43568.aspx Parenting Issues: Playing Favorites] Stepp, G.

Children who have a strong sense of being part of a family are likely to see siblings as an extension of themselves. However, according to Sylvia Rimm, although sibling rivalry can be reduced it is unlikely to be entirely eliminated. In moderate doses, rivalry may be a healthy indication that each child is assertive enough to express his or her differences with other siblings.<ref name=\"sylviarimm\"/>\n\nWeihe <ref>Wiehe, V. R. (1997) Sibling abuse: Hidden physical, emotional, and sexual trauma, 2nd edition. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Inc.</ref> suggests that four criteria should be used to determine if questionable behavior is rivalry or [[sibling abuse]]. First, one must determine if the questionable behavior is age appropriate: e.g., children use different conflict-resolution tactics during various developmental stages. Second, one must determine if the behavior is an isolated incident or part of an enduring pattern: abuse is, by definition, a long-term pattern rather than occasional disagreements. Third, one must determine if there is an \"aspect of victimization\" to the behavior: rivalry tends to be incident-specific, reciprocal and obvious to others, while abuse is characterized by secrecy and an imbalance of power. Fourth, one must determine the goal of the questionable behavior: the goal of abuse tends to be embarrassment or domination of the victim.\nParents should remember that sibling rivalry today may someday result in siblings being cut off from each other when the parents are gone. Continuing to encourage family togetherness, treating siblings equitably, and using family counseling to help arrest sibling rivalry that is excessive may ultimately serve children in their adult years.\n\n=={{anchor|incest}}Sibling marriage and incest==\n{{See also|Adelphogamy|Genetic sexual attraction|List of coupled siblings}}\n[[Image:Amnon and Tamar by an unknown artist, oil on canvas, ca. 1650-1700, High Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Amnon]] and [[Tamar (daughter of David)|Tamar]], children of the [[biblical]] [[King David]], were half-siblings yet Amnon raped Tamar<ref>{{Bibleref2|2 Samuel 13:15-22}}</ref>  (unknown [[European art]]ist, [[oil on canvas]], {{circa}} [[1650 in art|1650-1700]], [[High Museum of Art]])]]\nWhile [[cousin marriage]] is legal in most countries, and [[avunculate marriage]] is legal in many, sexual relations between siblings are considered [[incest]]uous almost universally.

In these situations, children are exploring each other's bodies while also exploring gender roles and behaviors, and their sexual experimentation does not indicate that these children are child sex offenders. As siblings are generally close in age and locational proximity, it stands to reason{{why?|People are typically not sexually attracted to their siblings|date=August 2019}} that the opportunity for sexual exploration between siblings is fairly high<!-- the [[Westermarck effect]] contradicts that-->- and that, if simply based on mutual curiosity, then these activities are not harmful or distressing, either in childhood or later in adulthood (Borgis, 2002). According to Reinisch (1990), studying early sexual behavior generally, over half of all six- and seven-year-old boys have engaged in sex play with other boys, and more than a third of them with girls, while more than a third of six- and seven-year-old girls have engaged in such play with both other girls and with boys. This play includes [[playing doctor]], mutual touching, and attempts at simulated, non-penetrative intercourse. Reinisch views such play as part of a normal progression from the sensual elements of bonding with parents, to masturbation, and then to sex play with others. By the age of eight or nine, according to Reinisch, children become aware that sexual arousal is a specific type of erotic sensation, and will seek these pleasurable experiences through various sights, self-touches, and fantasy, so that earlier generalized sex play shifts into more deliberate and intentional arousal.\n\nAbusive incestuous relationships between siblings can have adverse effects on the parties involved. Such abuse can leave victims detrimentally hindered in developmental processes, such as those necessary for interpersonal relations, and can be the cause for depression, anxiety, and substance abuse in the victim's adult life.<ref>[http://www.familiesinsociety.org/articlearchive/2011/92-1_carlson.pdf]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  Definitions used have varied widely. Child sexual abuse between siblings is defined by the (US) National Task Force on Juvenile Sexual Offending as: sexual acts initiated by one sibling toward another without the other's consent, by use of force or coercion, or where there is a power differential between the siblings. In Caffaro & Conn-Caffaro (1998), sibling child sexual abuse is defined as \"sexual behavior between siblings that is not age appropriate, not transitory, and not motivated by developmentally, mutually appropriate curiosity\". When child sexual experimentation is carried out with siblings, some researchers, e.g. Bank and Kahn (1982), do consider it incest, but those researchers who do use that term distinguish between abusive incest and non-abusive incest. Bank and Kahn say that abusive incest is power-oriented, sadistic, exploitative, and coercive, often including deliberate physical or mental abuse.\n\nViews of young sibling sexual contact may be affected by more general views regarding sexuality and minors:\nFinkelhor and Hotaling (1984)<ref name=\"fink1984\">{{cite book | last = Finkelhor | first = David | title = Child sexual abuse : new theory and research | publisher = Free Press | location = New York | year = 1984 | isbn = 978-0029100202 }}</ref> consider sexual contact to be abusive only under these circumstances: \n*1. it occurs with a child less than 13 years old, and the perpetrator is more than five years older than the victim or if the child is between 13 and 16 years old, and the perpetrator is ten years older than the victim; \n*2. coercion, force, or threat is used.\n\nLaviola (1992), says that behavior that is sexually abusive of children (generally speaking) depends upon the use of power, authority, bribery, or appeal to the child's trust or affection.<ref name=\"Laviola1992\">{{cite journal|last1=Laviola|first1=Marisa|title=Effects of older brother-younger sister incest: A study of the dynamics of 17 cases|journal=Child Abuse & Neglect|volume=16|issue=3|year=1992|pages=409\u2013421|issn=0145-2134\n|doi=10.1016/0145-2134(92)90050-2|pmid=1617475}}</ref>\n\nDe Jong (1989), offers four criteria to judge whether sexual behavior involving persons under 14 years old is abusive or not: \n*1. an age difference of more than five years; \n*2. use of force, threat, or authority; \n*3. attempted penile penetration; \n*4. physical injury to the victim. \nAccording to De Jong, if one or more of these is present, the behavior is abusive, whereas if none is present, the behavior must be considered normal sexual experimentation.<ref name=\"De Jong1989\">{{cite journal|last1=De Jong|first1=Allan R|title=Sexual interactions among siblings and cousins: Experimentation or exploitation?|journal=Child Abuse & Neglect|volume=13|issue=2|year=1989|pages=271\u2013279|issn=0145-2134|doi=10.1016/0145-2134(89)90014-8|pmid=2743184}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Siblings Day]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n1.

In contrast, close sibling relationships in [[Developing country|nonindustrialized cultures]] are often obligatory, with strong cultural norms prompting cooperation and close proximity between siblings. In [[India]], the brother-sister sibling relationship is so cherished that a festival is held in observance called Raksha Bandhan. At this celebration, the sister presents the brother with a woven bracelet to show their lasting bond even when they have raised their own families.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Verma|first1=Suman|last2=Saraswathi|first2=T.S.|title=Adolescence in India|page=110}}</ref> These cultures also extend caregiving roles to older siblings, who are constantly expected to watch over younger siblings.\n\n==Throughout the lifespan==\n\n===Infancy and childhood===\nA relationship begins with the introduction of two siblings to one another.

When the younger sibling begins school, the older sibling may help him or her become acclimated and give advice on the new struggles that come with being a student.

In this stage the common struggles of school and being under the strict jurisdiction of parents is dissolved. Despite these factors, siblings often maintain a relationship through adulthood and even old age.<ref>.Cicirelli, V. G. (1981). \u201cHelping elderly parents: Role of adult children.\u201d Boston: Auburn House.</ref> Proximity is a large factor in maintaining contact between siblings; those who live closer to one another are more likely to visit each other frequently. In addition, gender also plays a significant role.<ref>White, L. K., & Riedmann, A. (1992). Ties among adult siblings. \u201cSocial Forces, 71\u201d, 85-102.</ref> Sisters are most likely to maintain contact with one another, followed by mixed-gender dyads. Brothers are least likely to contact one another frequently.\n\nCommunication is especially important when siblings do not live near one another. Communication may take place in person, over the phone, by mail, and with increasing frequency, by means of online communication such as email and social networking. Often, siblings will communicate indirectly through a parent or a mutual friend of relative.<ref>Adams, B. N. (1968) \u201cKinship in an urban setting.\u201d Chicago: Markham.</ref> Between adult and elderly siblings, conversations tend to focus on family happenings and reflections of the past.<ref>Cicirelli, V. G. (1985). The role of siblings as family caregivers. In W. J. Sauer & R. T. Coward (Eds.), \u201cSocial support networks and the care of the elderly\u201d (pp. 93-107). New York: Springer-Verlag.</ref>\n\nIn adulthood, siblings still perform a role similar to that of friends.<ref name=\"Cicirelli\"/> Friends and siblings are often similar in age, with any age gap seeming even less significant in adulthood. Furthermore, both relationships are often egalitarian in nature, although unlike sibling relationships, friendships are voluntary. The specific roles of each relationship also differ, especially later in life. For elderly siblings, friends tend to act as companions while siblings play the roles of confidants.<ref>Connidis, I. A., & Davies, L. (1990) Confidants and companions in later life: The place of family and friends. \u201cJournal of Gerontology: Social Sciences, 45\u201d, 141-149</ref>\n\nIt is difficult to make long-term assumptions about adult sibling relationships, as they may rapidly change in response to individual or shared life events.<ref>Connidis, I. A. (1992). Life transitions and the adult sibling tie: A qualitative study. \u201cJournal of Marriage and the Family, 54\u201d, 972-982.</ref><ref>Bedford, V. H. (1990). Changing affect toward siblings and the transition to old age. \u201cProceedings of the Second International Conference on the Future of Adult Life\u201d. Leeuwenhorst, The Netherlands.</ref> Marriage of one sibling may either strengthen or weaken the sibling bond. The same can be said for change of location, birth of a child, and numerous other life events. However, divorce or widowhood of one sibling or death of a close family member most often results in increased closeness and support between siblings.\n\n==Sibling rivalry==\n{{Main|Sibling rivalry}}\nSibling rivalry describes the competitive relationship or animosity between siblings, blood-related or not. Often competition is the result of a desire for greater attention from parents. However, even the most conscientious parents can expect to see sibling rivalry in play to a degree. Children tend to naturally compete with each other for not only attention from parents but for recognition in the world.\n\nSiblings generally spend more time together during childhood than they do with parents. The sibling bond is often complicated and is influenced by factors such as parental treatment, [[birth order]], personality, and people and experiences outside the family.<ref name=\"psychtoday\">[http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-19930101-000023.html Adult Sibling Rivalry] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121211220721/http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-19930101-000023.html |date=2012-12-11 }} Jane Mersky Leder, Psychology Today, Publication Date: Jan/Feb 93, Last Reviewed: 30 Aug 2004</ref> According to [[child psychologist]] [[Sylvia Rimm]], sibling rivalry is particularly intense when children are very close in age and of the same gender, or where one child is [[Intellectual giftedness|intellectually gifted]].<ref name=\"sylviarimm\">[http://www.sylviarimm.com/article13.html The Effects of Sibling Competition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701155521/http://www.sylviarimm.com/article13.html |date=2007-07-01 }} Syliva B. Rimm, Educational Assessment Service, 2002.</ref> Sibling rivalry involves aggression and insults, especially between siblings close in age.\n\n===Causes===\nThere are many things that can influence and shape sibling rivalry. According to Kyla Boyse from the University of Michigan, each child in a family competes to define who they are as individuals and want to show that they are separate from their siblings. Children may feel they are getting unequal amounts of their parents\u2019 attention, discipline, and responsiveness. Children fight more in families where there is no understanding that fighting is not an acceptable way to resolve conflicts, and no alternative ways of handling such conflicts. Stress in the parents\u2019 and children's lives can create more conflict and increase sibling rivalry.<ref name=\"michigan\"/>\n\n====Psychoanalytic view====\n[[Sigmund Freud]] saw the sibling relationship as an extension of the [[Oedipus complex]], where brothers were in competition for their mother's attention and sisters for their father's.<ref>[http://www.freud-museum.at/e/inhalt/wissenJulietMitchell2003.html Freud Lecture: Juliet Mitchell, 2003]</ref> For example, in the case of [[Herbert Graf|Little Hans]], Freud postulated that the young boy's fear of horses was related to jealousy of his baby sister, as well as the boy's desire to replace his father as his mother's mate. This view has been largely discredited by modern research.\n\n====Parent-offspring conflict theory====\nFormulated by [[Robert Trivers]], [[Parent\u2013offspring conflict|parent-offspring theory]] is important for understanding sibling dynamics and parental decision-making. Because parents are expected to invest whatever is necessary to ensure the survival of their offspring, it is generally thought that parents will allocate the maximum amount of resources available, possibly to their own detriment and that of other potential offspring.<ref name=\"Parent-offspring conflict\">{{cite journal | last1 = Trivers | first1 = R.L. | year = 1974 | title = Parent-offspring conflict | url = | journal = American Zoologist | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 249\u2013264 | doi = 10.1093/icb/14.1.249 }}</ref> While parent are investing as much as possible to their offspring, offspring may at the same time attempt to obtain more resources than the parents are able to give to maximize its own reproductive success. Therefore, there is a conflict between the wants of the individual offspring and what the parent is able or willing to give.<ref name=\"Parent-offspring conflict\"/> An extension of Trivers\u2019 theory leads to predict that it will pay siblings to compete intensely with one another. It can pay to be selfish even to the detriment of not only one's parents but also to one's siblings, as long as the total fitness benefits of doing do outweigh the total costs.<ref>Salmon, C., & Shackelford, T. K. (n.d.). The Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Family Psychology, 57-132</ref>\n\n====Other psychological approaches====\n{{See also|Deidentification (psychology)}}\n[[Alfred Adler]] saw siblings as \"striving for significance\" within the family and felt that [[birth order]] was an important aspect of personality development. The feeling of being replaced or supplanted is often the cause of jealousy on the part of the older sibling.<ref name=\"What is Sibling Rivalry?\">Ellis-Christensen, T. (2003). What is Sibling Rivalry?. In wiseGEEK clear answers for common question</ref> In fact, psychologists and researchers today endorse the influence of birth order, as well as age and gender constellations, on sibling relationships. A child's personality can also have an effect on how much sibling rivalry will occur in a home. Some kids seem to naturally accept changes, while others may be naturally competitive, and exhibit this nature long before a sibling enters the home.<ref name=\"What is Sibling Rivalry?\"/> However, parents are seen as capable of having an important influence on whether they are competitive or not.<ref>[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/FrustAgg/levy.htm The Hostile Act] David M. Levy (1941) First published in Psychological Review, 48, 356-361.</ref>\n\n[[David Levy (psychologist)|David Levy]] introduced the term \"sibling rivalry\" in 1941, claiming that for an older sibling \"the aggressive response to the new baby is so typical that it is safe to say it is a common feature of family life.\" <ref>[http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/laurie-kramer-interview/sibling-relationships/44340.aspx Interview with Laurie Kramer] G.

By 3 years old, children have a sophisticated grasp of social rules, can evaluate themselves in relation to their siblings, and know how to adapt to circumstances within the family.<ref name=\"psychtoday\"/> Whether they have the drive to adapt, to get along with a sibling whose goals and interests may be different from their own, can make the difference between a cooperative relationship and a rivalrous one.<ref name=\"psychtoday\"/>\n\nStudies have further shown that the greatest sibling rivalry tends to be shown between brothers, and the least between sisters. Naturally, there are exceptions to this rule. What makes brother/brother ties so rivalrous? Deborah Gold has launched a new study that is not yet completed. But she has found a consistent theme running through the interviews she's conducted thus far. \"The thing that rides through with brothers that doesn't come across in other sibling pairs is this notion of parental and societal comparison. Somehow with boys, it seems far more natural to compare them, especially more than with sister/brother pairs. Almost from day one, the fundamental developmental markers--who gets a tooth first, who crawls, walks, speaks first--are held up on a larger-than-life scale. And this comparison appears to continue from school to college to the workplace. Who has the biggest house, who makes the most money, drives the best car are constant topics of discussion. In our society, men are supposed to be achievement-oriented, aggressive. They're supposed to succeed.\" <ref name=\"psychtoday\"/>\n\nSibling rivalry often continues throughout childhood and can be very frustrating and stressful to parents.<ref name=\"michigan\">[http://www.med.umich.edu/yourchild/topics/sibriv.htm Sibling Rivalry] University of Michigan Health System, June 2009</ref> Adolescents fight for the same reasons younger children fight, but they are better equipped physically and intellectually to hurt and be hurt by each other. Physical and emotional changes cause pressures in the teenage years, as do changing relationships with parents and friends. Fighting with siblings as a way to get parental attention may increase in adolescence.<ref name=\"teenagers\">[http://www.ext.nodak.edu/extnews/pipeline/teen-6w.htm Living With Your Teenager: Dealing With Sibling Rivalry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725054814/http://www.ext.nodak.edu/extnews/pipeline/teen-6w.htm |date=2011-07-25 }} Donna Rae Jacobson, North Dakota State University, July 1995</ref> One study found that the age group 10 to 15 reported the highest level of competition between siblings.<ref name=\"mcnerney\">[http://jrscience.wcp.muohio.edu/humannature01/FinalArticles/SiblingRivalryinDegreeand.html Sibling Rivalry in Degree and Dimensions Across the Lifespan] Annie McNerney and Joy Usner, 30 April 2001.</ref>\n\nHowever, the degree of sibling rivalry and conflict is not constant. Longitudinal studies looking at the degree of sibling rivalry throughout childhood from Western societies suggest that, over time, sibling relationships become more egalitarian and this suggest less conflict.<ref>Buhrmester, D., & Furman, W. (1987). The development of companionship and intimacy. ChildDevelopment, 58, 1101- 1113</ref> Yet, this effect is moderated by birth order: Older siblings report more or less the same level of conflict and rivalry throughout their childhood. In contrast, young siblings report a peak in conflict and rivalry around young adolescence and a drop in late adolescence. The decline in late adolescence makes sense from an evolutionary perspective: Once resources cease and/ or individuals have started their own reproductive career, it makes little sense for sibling to continue fierce competition over resources that do not affect their reproductive success anymore.<ref>Pollet, TV, & Nettle, D. (2007). Birth order and face-to-face contact with a sibling: Firstborns have more contact than laterborns. Personality and individual Differences, 43, 1796-1806</ref>\n\nSibling rivalry can continue into adulthood and sibling relationships can change dramatically over the years. Events such as a parent's illness may bring siblings closer together, whereas marriage may drive them apart, particularly if the in-law relationship is strained. Approximately one-third of adults describe their relationship with siblings as rivalrous or distant. However, rivalry often lessens over time. At least 80 percent of siblings over age 60 enjoy close ties.<ref name=\"psychtoday\"/>\n\n===Prevention===\nParents can reduce the opportunity for rivalry by refusing to compare or typecast their children,<ref name=\"Journal article\">[http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/parenting-issues/family-favoritism/43568.aspx Parenting Issues: Playing Favorites] Stepp, G. (2011)</ref> teaching the children positive ways to get attention from each other and from the parent, planning fun family activities together, and making sure each child has enough time and space of their own.<ref name=\"michigan\"/> They can also give each child individual attention, encourage teamwork, refuse to hold up one child as a role model for the others, and avoid favoritism.<ref name=\"arkansas\">[http://www.parenting-ed.org Center for Effective Parenting] Arkansas State Parent Information & Resource Center</ref> It is also important for parents to invest in time spent together as a whole family. Children who have a strong sense of being part of a family are likely to see siblings as an extension of themselves. However, according to Sylvia Rimm, although sibling rivalry can be reduced it is unlikely to be entirely eliminated. In moderate doses, rivalry may be a healthy indication that each child is assertive enough to express his or her differences with other siblings.<ref name=\"sylviarimm\"/>\n\nWeihe <ref>Wiehe, V. R. (1997) Sibling abuse: Hidden physical, emotional, and sexual trauma, 2nd edition. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Inc.</ref> suggests that four criteria should be used to determine if questionable behavior is rivalry or [[sibling abuse]]. First, one must determine if the questionable behavior is age appropriate: e.g., children use different conflict-resolution tactics during various developmental stages. Second, one must determine if the behavior is an isolated incident or part of an enduring pattern: abuse is, by definition, a long-term pattern rather than occasional disagreements. Third, one must determine if there is an \"aspect of victimization\" to the behavior: rivalry tends to be incident-specific, reciprocal and obvious to others, while abuse is characterized by secrecy and an imbalance of power. Fourth, one must determine the goal of the questionable behavior: the goal of abuse tends to be embarrassment or domination of the victim.\nParents should remember that sibling rivalry today may someday result in siblings being cut off from each other when the parents are gone. Continuing to encourage family togetherness, treating siblings equitably, and using family counseling to help arrest sibling rivalry that is excessive may ultimately serve children in their adult years.\n\n=={{anchor|incest}}Sibling marriage and incest==\n{{See also|Adelphogamy|Genetic sexual attraction|List of coupled siblings}}\n[[Image:Amnon and Tamar by an unknown artist, oil on canvas, ca. 1650-1700, High Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Amnon]] and [[Tamar (daughter of David)|Tamar]], children of the [[biblical]] [[King David]], were half-siblings yet Amnon raped Tamar<ref>{{Bibleref2|2 Samuel 13:15-22}}</ref>  (unknown [[European art]]ist, [[oil on canvas]], {{circa}} [[1650 in art|1650-1700]], [[High Museum of Art]])]]\nWhile [[cousin marriage]] is legal in most countries, and [[avunculate marriage]] is legal in many, sexual relations between siblings are considered [[incest]]uous almost universally.

In these situations, children are exploring each other's bodies while also exploring gender roles and behaviors, and their sexual experimentation does not indicate that these children are child sex offenders. As siblings are generally close in age and locational proximity, it stands to reason{{why?|People are typically not sexually attracted to their siblings|date=August 2019}} that the opportunity for sexual exploration between siblings is fairly high<!-- the [[Westermarck effect]] contradicts that-->- and that, if simply based on mutual curiosity, then these activities are not harmful or distressing, either in childhood or later in adulthood (Borgis, 2002). According to Reinisch (1990), studying early sexual behavior generally, over half of all six- and seven-year-old boys have engaged in sex play with other boys, and more than a third of them with girls, while more than a third of six- and seven-year-old girls have engaged in such play with both other girls and with boys. This play includes [[playing doctor]], mutual touching, and attempts at simulated, non-penetrative intercourse. Reinisch views such play as part of a normal progression from the sensual elements of bonding with parents, to masturbation, and then to sex play with others. By the age of eight or nine, according to Reinisch, children become aware that sexual arousal is a specific type of erotic sensation, and will seek these pleasurable experiences through various sights, self-touches, and fantasy, so that earlier generalized sex play shifts into more deliberate and intentional arousal.\n\nAbusive incestuous relationships between siblings can have adverse effects on the parties involved. Such abuse can leave victims detrimentally hindered in developmental processes, such as those necessary for interpersonal relations, and can be the cause for depression, anxiety, and substance abuse in the victim's adult life.<ref>[http://www.familiesinsociety.org/articlearchive/2011/92-1_carlson.pdf]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  Definitions used have varied widely. Child sexual abuse between siblings is defined by the (US) National Task Force on Juvenile Sexual Offending as: sexual acts initiated by one sibling toward another without the other's consent, by use of force or coercion, or where there is a power differential between the siblings. In Caffaro & Conn-Caffaro (1998), sibling child sexual abuse is defined as \"sexual behavior between siblings that is not age appropriate, not transitory, and not motivated by developmentally, mutually appropriate curiosity\". When child sexual experimentation is carried out with siblings, some researchers, e.g. Bank and Kahn (1982), do consider it incest, but those researchers who do use that term distinguish between abusive incest and non-abusive incest. Bank and Kahn say that abusive incest is power-oriented, sadistic, exploitative, and coercive, often including deliberate physical or mental abuse.\n\nViews of young sibling sexual contact may be affected by more general views regarding sexuality and minors:\nFinkelhor and Hotaling (1984)<ref name=\"fink1984\">{{cite book | last = Finkelhor | first = David | title = Child sexual abuse : new theory and research | publisher = Free Press | location = New York | year = 1984 | isbn = 978-0029100202 }}</ref> consider sexual contact to be abusive only under these circumstances: \n*1. it occurs with a child less than 13 years old, and the perpetrator is more than five years older than the victim or if the child is between 13 and 16 years old, and the perpetrator is ten years older than the victim; \n*2. coercion, force, or threat is used.\n\nLaviola (1992), says that behavior that is sexually abusive of children (generally speaking) depends upon the use of power, authority, bribery, or appeal to the child's trust or affection.<ref name=\"Laviola1992\">{{cite journal|last1=Laviola|first1=Marisa|title=Effects of older brother-younger sister incest: A study of the dynamics of 17 cases|journal=Child Abuse & Neglect|volume=16|issue=3|year=1992|pages=409\u2013421|issn=0145-2134\n|doi=10.1016/0145-2134(92)90050-2|pmid=1617475}}</ref>\n\nDe Jong (1989), offers four criteria to judge whether sexual behavior involving persons under 14 years old is abusive or not: \n*1. an age difference of more than five years; \n*2. use of force, threat, or authority; \n*3. attempted penile penetration; \n*4. physical injury to the victim. \nAccording to De Jong, if one or more of these is present, the behavior is abusive, whereas if none is present, the behavior must be considered normal sexual experimentation.<ref name=\"De Jong1989\">{{cite journal|last1=De Jong|first1=Allan R|title=Sexual interactions among siblings and cousins: Experimentation or exploitation?|journal=Child Abuse & Neglect|volume=13|issue=2|year=1989|pages=271\u2013279|issn=0145-2134|doi=10.1016/0145-2134(89)90014-8|pmid=2743184}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Siblings Day]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n1.
