Although approved by then-president [[Ronald Reagan]] and announced in the 1984 [[State of the Union]] address, ''Freedom'' was never constructed or completed as originally designed. After several cutbacks, the project evolved into the [[International Space Station program]].\n\nSpace Station ''Freedom'' was a joint project between four participating space agencies: [[NASA]] ([[United States]]), [[JAXA]] ([[Japan]]), [[European Space Agency|ESA]] ([[Europe]]), and [[Canadian Space Agency|CSA]] ([[Canada]]).\n\n==Original proposal==\nAs the [[Apollo program]] began to wind down in the late 1960s, there were numerous proposals for what should follow it. Of the many proposals, large and small, three major themes emerged. Foremost among them was a crewed mission to [[Mars]], using systems, not unlike the ones used for Apollo. A permanent [[space station]] was also an important goal, both to help construct the large spacecraft needed for a Mars mission as well as to learn about long-term operations in space. Finally, the idea of a \"space logistics vehicle\" that could cheaply launch crews and cargo to that station.\n\nIn the early 1970s, [[Spiro Agnew]] took these general plans to [[President Nixon]], who was battling with a significant federal budget deficit. When he presented the three concepts, Nixon told him to select one. After much debate, [[NASA]] selected the space logistics vehicle, which by this time, was already known as the [[Space Shuttle]]. They argued that the Shuttle would so lower costs of launching cargo that it would make the construction of the station less expensive.\n\nFrom this point forward, these plans were never seriously changed, despite dramatic changes to the funding environment and the complete redesign of the Shuttle concept. In the early 1980s, with the [[Space Shuttle]] completed, NASA proposed the creation of a large, permanently crewed space station, which then-NASA Administrator [[James M. Beggs]] called \"the next logical step\" in space.  In some ways, it was meant to be the U.S. answer to the Soviet ''[[Mir]]''.\n\nNASA plans they called for the station, which was later dubbed Space Station ''Freedom'', to function as an orbiting repair shop for [[satellite]]s, an assembly point for [[spacecraft]], an observation post for [[astronomer]]s, a [[microgravity]] [[laboratory]] for scientists, and a microgravity factory for companies.\n\nReagan announced plans to build Space Station ''Freedom'' in 1984, stating: \"We can follow our dreams to distant stars, living and working in space for peaceful economic and scientific gain.\"\n\n==Design iterations==\nThe 1990 [[Space Exploration Initiative]] called for the construction of the Space Station ''Freedom''. Following the presidential announcement, NASA began a set of studies to determine the potential uses for the space station, both in research and in industry, in the U.S. or overseas. This led to the creation of a database of thousands of possible missions and payloads; studies were also carried out to support potential planetary missions, as well as those in low Earth orbit.\n\nSeveral Space Shuttle missions in the 1980s and early 1990s included [[extra-vehicular activity|spacewalks]] to demonstrate and test space station construction techniques. After the establishment of the initial baseline design, the project evolved extensively, growing in scope and cost.\n\n===\"Power Tower\" (1984)===\n[[File:Power Tower Space Station Concept.jpg|thumb|upright|\"Power Tower\" space station concept (1984)]]\n\nIn April 1984, the newly established Space Station Program Office at [[Johnson Space Center]] produced a first reference configuration; this design would serve as a baseline for further planning. The chosen design was the \"Power Tower,\" a long central keel with a most mass located at either end. This arrangement would provide enough gravity gradient stability to keep the station aligned with the keel pointed towards the Earth, reducing the need for thruster firings. Most designs featured a cluster of modules at the lower end and a set of articulated solar arrays at the upper end. It also contained a servicing bay. In April 1985, the program selected a set of contractors to carry out definition studies and preliminary design; various trade-offs were made in this process, balancing higher development costs against reduced long-term operating costs.\n\n===Revised Baseline Configuration (1987)===\n[[File:Space station freedom (1).jpg|thumb|Revised Baseline Configuration (1987)]]\n\nAt the same time, late 1986, NASA carried out a study into new configuration options to reduce development costs; options studied ranged from the use of a [[Skylab]]-type station to a phased development of the Dual-Keel configuration. This approach involved splitting assembly into two phases; Phase 1 would provide the central modules and the transverse boom, but with no keels. The solar arrays would be augmented to ensure 75&nbsp;kW of power would be provided, and the polar platform and servicing facility was again deferred. The study concluded that the project was viable, reducing development costs while minimizing negative impacts, and it was designated the Revised Baseline Configuration. This would have a development cost of US$15.3 billion (in FY1989 dollars) and FEL in the first quarter of 1994. This replanning was endorsed by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] in September 1987, which also recommended that the long-term national goals should be studied before committing to any particular Phase 2 design.\n\nDuring 1986 and 1987, various other studies were carried out on the future of the U.S. space program; the results of these often impacted the Space Station, and their recommendations were folded into the revised baseline as necessary. One of the effects of these was to baseline the Station program as requiring five shuttle flights a year for operations and logistics, rotating four crew at a time to extend individual stay times to 180 days.\n\n===''Freedom'' (1988) to ''Alpha'' (1993)===\n[[File:Artist's Conception of Space Station Freedom - GPN-2003-00092.jpg|thumb|1991 artist's conception of the completed Space Station ''Freedom'' in orbit]]\n\nNASA signed final ten-year contracts for developing the Space Station in September 1988, and the project was finally moving into the hardware fabrication phase.\n\nThe Space Station ''Freedom'' design was slightly modified in late 1989 after the program's Fiscal 1990 budget again was reduced\u2014from $2.05 billion to $1.75 billion\u2014when the design was found to be 23% overweight and over budget, too complicated to assemble, and providing little power for its users. Congress consequently demanded yet another redesign in October 1990 and requested further cost reductions after the fiscal 1991 budget was cut from $2.5 billion to $1.9 billion. NASA unveiled its new space station design in March 1991.\n\nRepeated budget cuts had forced a postponement of the first launch by a year to March 1995. The Station would be permanently crewed from June 1997 onwards and completed in February 1998. Cost escalation of the project and financial difficulties in Russia led to a briefing between NASA and [[NPO Energia]] on ''[[Mir-2]]''. In November 1993, ''Freedom'', ''Mir-2'', and the European and Japanese modules were incorporated into a single [[International Space Station]].\n\n==Station program placed on hold==\nUnderestimates by NASA of the station program's cost and unwillingness by the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] to appropriate funding for the space station resulted in delays of ''Freedom''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s design and construction; it was regularly redesigned and re-scoped.  Between 1984 and 1993, it went through seven significant re-designs, losing capacity and capabilities each time.  Rather than being completed in a decade, as Reagan had predicted, ''Freedom'' was never built, and no Shuttle launches were made as part of the program.\n\nBy 1993, ''Freedom'' was politically unviable; the administration had changed, and Congress was tiring of paying yet more money into the station program. Also, there were open questions over the need for the station.  Redesigns had cut most of the science capacity by this point, and the [[Space Race]] had ended in 1975 with the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]].  NASA presented several options to [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]], but even the most limited of these was still seen as too expensive.

Although approved by then-president [[Ronald Reagan]] and announced in the 1984 [[State of the Union]] address, ''Freedom'' was never constructed or completed as originally designed, and after several cutbacks, the project evolved into the [[International Space Station program]].\n\nSpace Station ''Freedom'' was a joint project between four participating space agencies: [[NASA]] ([[United States]]), [[JAXA]] ([[Japan]]), [[European Space Agency|ESA]] ([[Europe]]), and [[Canadian Space Agency|CSA]] ([[Canada]]).\n\n==Original proposal==\nAs the [[Apollo program]] began to wind down in the late 1960s, there were numerous proposals for what should follow it. Of the many proposals, large and small, three major themes emerged. Foremost among them was a crewed mission to [[Mars]], using systems not unlike the ones used for Apollo. A permanent [[space station]] was also a major goal, both to help construct the large spacecraft needed for a Mars mission as well as to learn about long-term operations in space. Finally, the idea of a \"space logistics vehicle\" that could cheaply launch crews and cargo to that station.\n\nIn the early 1970s, [[Spiro Agnew]] took these general plans to [[President Nixon]], who was battling with a major federal budget deficit. When he presented the three concepts, Nixon told him to select one. After much debate, [[NASA]] selected the space logistics vehicle, which by this time was already known as the [[Space Shuttle]]. They argued that the Shuttle would so lower costs of launching cargo that it would make the construction of the station less expensive.\n\nFrom this point forward these plans were never seriously changed, in spite of dramatic changes to the funding environment and the complete redesign of the Shuttle concept. In the early 1980s, with the [[Space Shuttle]] completed, NASA proposed the creation of a large, permanently crewed space station, which then-NASA Administrator [[James M. Beggs]] called \"the next logical step\" in space.  In some ways it was meant to be the U.S. answer to the Soviet ''[[Mir]]''.\n\nNASA plans called for the station, which was later dubbed Space Station ''Freedom'', to function as an orbiting repair shop for [[satellite]]s, an assembly point for [[spacecraft]], an observation post for [[astronomer]]s, a [[microgravity]] [[laboratory]] for scientists, and a microgravity factory for companies.\n\nReagan announced plans to build Space Station ''Freedom'' in 1984, stating: \"We can follow our dreams to distant stars, living and working in space for peaceful economic and scientific gain.\"\n\n==Design iterations==\nThe 1990 [[Space Exploration Initiative]] called for the construction of the Space Station ''Freedom''. Following the presidential announcement, NASA began a set of studies to determine the potential uses for the space station, both in research and in industry, in the U.S. or overseas. This led to the creation of a database of thousands of possible missions and payloads; studies were also carried out with a view to supporting potential planetary missions, as well as those in low Earth orbit.\n\nSeveral Space Shuttle missions in the 1980s and early 1990s included [[extra-vehicular activity|spacewalks]] to demonstrate and test space station construction techniques.
