The provinces and territories that do not share a border with the United States share a provincial border with at least one that does except for Prince Edward Island.\n\n===Yukon===\nThe border begins at the [[Beaufort Sea]] at 69\u00b039\u2032N, 141\u00b000\u2032W and proceeds southwards along the [[141st meridian west]].  At 60\u00b018\u2032N, the border proceeds away from the 141st meridian west in a southeastwardly direction and follows the [[St. Elias Mountains]].  South of the [[60th parallel north]], the border continues into British Columbia.  The entire Canada\u2013U.S. border in [[Yukon]] is shared with the U.S. state of [[Alaska]].\n\n===British Columbia===\nBritish Columbia has two international borders with the United States; one with the state of Alaska, and one at the southern end with the northwestern continental United States.\n\nThe former, continuing from the Yukon-Alaska border, proceeds through the St. Elias Mountains. Afterwards, at [[Mt. Fairweather]] at 58\u00b054\u2032N, 137\u00b031\u2032W, the border heads northwestwards towards the [[Coast Mountains]].  Afterwards, at 59\u00b048\u2032N, 135\u00b028\u2032W, the border heads in a generally southeastwardly direction along the Coast Mountains.  The border eventually reaches the [[Portland Canal]], and follows it outward to the [[Dixon Entrance]].  The border then follows the Dixon Entrance out into the [[Pacific Ocean]], and terminates upon reaching [[international waters]].\n\nThe latter begins at the terminus of international waters in the Pacific Ocean southwest of [[Vancouver Island]] and northwest of the [[Olympic Peninsula]].  It follows the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]] eastward and then turns northeastward to enter [[Haro Strait]]. The border follows this strait in a northerly direction and turns sharply in an easterly direction through [[Boundary Pass]], separating the Canadian [[Gulf Islands]] from the American [[San Juan Islands]]. Upon reaching the [[Strait of Georgia]], the border turns due north and then to a northwesterly direction, bisecting this strait until the [[49th parallel north]]. At this parallel, the border makes a sharp turn to a due eastbound direction, and follows the parallel across the [[Tsawwassen, British Columbia|Tsawwassen Peninsula]], separating [[Point Roberts, Washington]] from [[Delta, British Columbia]], and continues into [[Alberta]].  This border, going from west to east, is shared with the U.S. states of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Idaho]], and [[Montana]].\n\n===Alberta===\nThe entire Canada\u2013U.S. border in the Canadian province of Alberta lies on the 49th parallel north.  This border, going from west to east, is shared with the U.S. state of Montana.\n\n===Saskatchewan===\nThe entire Canada\u2013U.S. border in the Canadian province of [[Saskatchewan]] lies on the 49th parallel north.  This border, going from west to east, is shared with the U.S. states of Montana and [[North Dakota]].\n\n===Manitoba===\nNearly the entire Canada\u2013U.S. border in the Canadian province of [[Manitoba]] lies on the 49th parallel north.  At the eastern end, however, the border briefly enters the [[Lake of the Woods]], turns north at 48\u00b059\u2032N, 95\u00b009\u2032W, continues into land along the western end of Minnesota's [[Northwest Angle]], and continues into Ontario at 49\u00b023\u2032N, 95\u00b009\u2032W.  This border, going from west to east, is shared with the U.S. states of North Dakota and [[Minnesota]].\n\n===Ontario===\nThe border begins at the northwesternmost point of Minnesota's Northwest Angle 49\u00b023\u2032N, 95\u00b009\u2032W, and proceeds in an easterly direction through the Angle Inlet into the Lake of the Woods.  At 41\u00b019\u2032N, 94\u00b048\u2032W in the Lake of the Woods, the border turns to a southerly direction, and continues into the [[Rainy River (Minnesota\u2013Ontario)|Rainy River]].  The border then follows the Rainy River to [[Rainy Lake]], then subsequently through numerous small lakes, including Lake Namakan, [[Lac la Croix]], and [[Sea Gull Lake]], until reaching the [[Pigeon River (Minnesota-Ontario)|Pigeon River]], which leads it out into [[Lake Superior]].  The border continues through Lake Superior to [[Whitefish Bay]].  The border then proceeds through Whitefish Bay into the [[St. Marys River (Michigan\u2013Ontario)|St. Mary's River]], then into the [[North Channel (Ontario)|North Channel]], then, at 45\u00b059\u2032N 83\u00b026\u2032N, turns to a southerly direction into the [[False Detour Channel]], and reaches [[Lake Huron]].  The border then heads in a southerly direction through Lake Huron until reaching the [[St. Clair River]], which subsequently leads it to [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Lake St. Clair]].  The border then proceeds through Lake St. Clair, reaching the [[Detroit River]], which leads it to [[Lake Erie]].  The border then proceeds through Lake Erie into the [[Niagara River]], which leads into [[Lake Ontario]].  The border then proceeds in a northwesterly direction in Lake Ontario, then at 43\u00b027\u2032N, 79\u00b012\u2032W, the border makes a sharp turn to a north easterly direction.  The border then reaches and proceeds through the [[St. Lawrence River]]. Finally, at 45\u00b000\u2032N, 74\u00b040\u2032E, the border splits from the St. Lawrence River and continues into [[Quebec]].  This border, going from west to east, is shared with the U.S. states of Minnesota, [[Michigan]], [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[New York (state)|New York]].\n\n===Quebec===\nThe border begins in the St. Lawrence River, continuing from the Ontario-New York border, at the [[45th parallel north]], the border heads inland in an easterly direction, remaining on or near the parallel. At 45\u00b000\u2032N, 71\u00b030\u2032W, the border begins to follow various natural features of the [[Appalachian Mountains]].  It continues to do so until 46\u00b025\u2032N, 70\u00b003\u2032W, where it begins to follow a northerly direction, followed by a northeasterly direction at 46\u00b041\u2032N, 69\u00b059\u2032W.  Afterwards, at 47\u00b027\u2032N, 69\u00b013\u2032E the border heads toward [[Beau Lake]].  Finally, after the border proceeds through Beau Lake, it continues into [[New Brunswick]].  This border, going from west to east, is shared with the U.S. states of New York, [[Vermont]], [[New Hampshire]], and [[Maine]].\n\n===New Brunswick===\nThe border begins at the southern tip of Beau Lake at 47\u00b018\u2032N, 69\u00b003\u2032W and proceeds to the [[Saint John River (New Brunswick)|Saint John River]]. The border then proceeds through the Saint John River until 47\u00b004\u2032N, 67\u00b047\u2032W, where it splits from the river and heads southward. Then, at 45\u00b056\u2032N, 67\u00b047\u2032W heads into the [[Chiputneticook Lakes]], which subsequently lead it to the St. Croix River.  The border then proceeds through the [[St. Croix River (Maine \u2013 New Brunswick)|St. Croix River]] to [[Passamaquoddy Bay]], which in turn leads it past [[Grand Manan Island]] into the middle of the [[Bay of Fundy]], where it turns in a southerly direction and then terminates upon reaching international waters. This border is shared entirely with the U.S. state of Maine.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Canada\u2013United States border]]\n*[[Canada\u2013United States relations]]\n*[[Canada\u2013France Maritime Boundary Case]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{North America topic |Borders of}}\n\n[[Category:Borders of Canada| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=February 2009}}\n[[File:Alaska-Yukon International Border.jpg|thumb|The international border between Canada and the United States, with Yukon on one side and Alaska on the other, circa 1900-1923<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/99614340| title=Alaska-Yukon boundary| publisher=Library of Congress}}</ref>]]\nThe '''borders of [[Canada]]''' include the [[Canada\u2013United States border|longest shared border]] in the world, {{Convert|8893|km|abbr=on}} with the [[United States]]<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2096.html#ca| title=FIELD LISTING :: LAND BOUNDARIES| work=The World Factbook| publisher=CIA}}</ref> as well as a long [[maritime boundary]] with [[Denmark]], at the autonomous island [[country]] of [[Greenland]], and a short maritime border with [[France]], at the [[Overseas departments and territories of France|overseas islands]] of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]].\n\n==United States==\n{{Main|Canada\u2013United States border}}\nCanada shares borders with the United States in 8 out of 13 provinces and territories.

{"title_page": "Philipp Otto Runge", "text_new": "[[Image:Philipp Otto Runge 005.jpg|thumb|right|Self Portrait by Phillipp Otto Runge, at the [[Kunsthalle Hamburg|Kunsthalle]], [[Hamburg]]]]\n\n'''Philipp Otto Runge''' ({{IPA-de|\u02c8\u0281\u028a\u014b\u0259|lang}}; 23 July 1777 \u2013 2 December 1810) was a [[Romanticism|Romantic]] [[Germany|German]] painter and draughtsman. Although he made a late start to his career and died young, he is considered among the best German Romantic painters.\n\n== Life and work ==\n[[File:Philipp Otto Runge 003.jpg|thumb|''The H\u00fclsenbeck children'', oil on canvas]]\n\nRunge was born as the ninth of eleven children in [[Wolgast]], [[Western Pomerania]], then under Swedish rule, in a family of shipbuilders with ties to the Prussian nobility of [[Sypniewski]] / von Runge family. As a sickly child he often missed school and at an early age learned the art of scissor-cut silhouettes from his mother, practised by him throughout his life. In 1795 he began a commercial apprenticeship at his older brother Daniel's firm in Hamburg. In 1799 Daniel supported Runge financially to begin study of painting under [[Jens Juel (painter)|Jens Juel]] at the [[Copenhagen Academy]]. In 1801 he moved to [[Dresden]] to continue his studies, where he met [[Caspar David Friedrich]], [[Ludwig Tieck]], and his future wife Pauline Bassenge. He also began extensive study of the writings of the 17th century mystic [[Jakob Boehme]]. In 1803, on a visit to Weimar, Runge unexpectedly met [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and the two formed a friendship based on their common interests in [[color]] and art.\n\nIn 1804 he married and moved with his wife to [[Hamburg]]. Due to imminent war dangers (Napoleonic [[siege of Hamburg]]) they relocated in 1805 to his parental home in Wolgast where they remained until 1807. In 1805 Runge's correspondence with Goethe on the subject of his artistic work and color became more intensive. Returning to Hamburg in 1807, he and his brother Daniel formed a new company in which he remained active until the end of his life. In the same year he developed the concept of the color sphere.<ref>Maltzahn, H. 1940, ''Philipp Otto Runge's Briefwechsel mit Goethe'', Weimar: Verlag der [[Goethe-Gesellschaft]].</ref> In 1808 he intensified his work on color, including making [[color triangle|disk color]] mixture experiments. He also published written versions of two local folk fairy tales ''The fisherman and his wife'' and ''The almond tree'', later included among the [[Grimm's Fairy Tales|tales of the brothers Grimm]]. In 1809 Runge completed his work on the manuscript of ''Farben-Kugel'' (Color sphere), published in 1810 in Hamburg.<ref>Runge, P. O. 1810, ''Die Farben-Kugel, oder Construction des Verhaeltnisses aller Farben zueinander'', Hamburg: Perthes.</ref> In the same year, ill with tuberculosis, Runge painted another self-portrait as well as portraits of his family and brother Daniel. The last of his four children was born on the day after Runge's death.<ref>Runge, P. O. 1840/41, ''Hinterlassene Schriften', 2. vols., D. Runge, ed., Hamburg: Perthes.'</ref>\n\n[[File:Philipp Otto Runge 001.jpg|thumb|upright|''Der Morgen'' (\"Morning\", 1808), oil on canvas]]\n[[File:Philipp Otto Runge - A Stalk of Lilies with Six Blooms.jpg|thumb|<center>''A Stalk of Lilies with Six Blooms''</center>]]\n\nRunge was of a mystical, deeply Christian turn of mind, and in his artistic work he tried to express notions of the harmony of the universe through symbolism of colour, form, and numbers. He considered blue, yellow, and red to be symbolic of the Christian trinity and equated blue with God and the night, red with morning, evening, and Jesus, and yellow with the Holy Spirit (Runge 1841, I, p.&nbsp;17). He also wrote poetry and to this end he planned a series of four [[painting]]s called ''The Times of the Day'', designed to be seen in a special building and viewed to the accompaniment of [[music]] and [[poetry]]. This concept was common to romantic artists, who tried to achieve a \"total art\", or a fusion between all forms of art. In 1803 Runge had large-format engravings made of the drawings of the ''Times of the Day'' series that became commercially successful and a set of which he presented to Goethe. He painted two versions of ''Morning'' (Kunsthalle, Hamburg), but the others did not advance beyond drawings. \"Morning\" was the start of a new type of landscape, one of religion and emotion.\n\nRunge was also one of the best German [[portrait]]ists of his period; several examples are in Hamburg. His style was rigid, sharp, and intense, at times almost na\u00efve.\n\n== Runge and color ==\n\n[[Image:Runge Farbenkugel.jpg|thumb|left|Runge's ''Farbenkugel'' (color sphere)]]\nRunge's interest in color was the natural result of his work as a painter and of having an enquiring mind. Among his accepted tenets was that \"as is known, there are only three colors, yellow, red, and blue\" (letter to Goethe of July 3, 1806). His goal was to establish the complete world of colors resulting from mixture of the three, among themselves and together with white and black. In the same lengthy letter, Runge discussed in some detail his views on color order and included a sketch of a mixture circle, with the three primary colors forming an equilateral triangle and, together with their pair-wise mixtures, a hexagon.\n\nHe arrived at the concept of the color sphere sometime in 1807, as indicated in his letter to Goethe of November 21 of that year, by expanding the hue circle into a sphere, with white and black forming the two opposing poles. A [[color solid|color mixture solid]] of a double-triangular pyramid had been proposed by [[Tobias Mayer]] in 1758, a fact known to Runge. His expansion of that solid into a sphere appears to have had an idealistic basis rather than one of logical necessity. With his disk color mixture experiments of 1807, he hoped to provide scientific support for the sphere form. Encouraged by Goethe and other friends, he wrote in 1808 a manuscript describing the color sphere, published in Hamburg early in 1810. In addition to a description of the color sphere, it contains an illustrated essay on rules of color harmony and one on color in nature written by Runge's friend [[Henrik Steffens]]. An included hand-colored plate shows two different views of the surface of the sphere as well as horizontal and vertical slices showing the organization of its interior (see figure on left).\n\nRunge's premature death limited the impact of this work. Goethe, who had read the manuscript before publication, mentioned it in his ''[[Theory of Colours (book)|Farbenlehre]]'' of 1810 as \"successfully concluding this kind of effort.\" It was soon overshadowed by [[Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul]]'s hemispherical system of 1839. A spherical color order system was patented in 1900 by [[Albert Henry Munsell]], soon replaced with an irregular form of the solid.\n\n== Legacy ==\nRunge has been included in numerous major retrospective exhibitions, including the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|Metropolitan Museum of Art's]], \"German Masters of the Nineteenth Century\" and the [[Kunsthalle Hamburg|Hamburg Kunsthalle's]], \"Runge\u2019s Cosmos\". The art critic Robert Hughes has described Runge as \"the closest equivalent to [[William Blake]] that Germany produced\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Hughes, Robert, 1938-2012.|first=|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/707239996|title=Nothing if not critical : selected essays on art and artists|date=1990|publisher=A.A.

Although he made a late start to his career and died young, he is considered among the best German Romantic painters.\n\n== Life and work ==\n[[File:Philipp Otto Runge 003.jpg|thumb|''The H\u00fclsenbeck children'', oil on canvas]]\n\nRunge was born as the ninth of eleven children in [[Wolgast]], [[Western Pomerania]], then under Swedish rule, in a family of shipbuilders with ties to the Prussian nobility of [[Sypniewski]] / von Runge family. As a sickly child he often missed school and at an early age learned the art of scissor-cut silhouettes from his mother, practised by him throughout his life. In 1795 he began a commercial apprenticeship at his older brother Daniel's firm in Hamburg. In 1799 Daniel supported Runge financially to begin study of painting under [[Jens Juel (painter)|Jens Juel]] at the [[Copenhagen Academy]]. In 1801 he moved to [[Dresden]] to continue his studies, where he met [[Caspar David Friedrich]], [[Ludwig Tieck]], and his future wife Pauline Bassenge. He also began extensive study of the writings of the 17th century mystic [[Jakob Boehme]]. In 1803, on a visit to Weimar, Runge unexpectedly met [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and the two formed a friendship based on their common interests in [[color]] and art.\n\nIn 1804 he married and moved with his wife to [[Hamburg]]. Due to imminent war dangers (Napoleonic [[siege of Hamburg]]) they relocated in 1805 to his parental home in Wolgast where they remained until 1807. In 1805 Runge's correspondence with Goethe on the subject of his artistic work and color became more intensive. Returning to Hamburg in 1807, he and his brother Daniel formed a new company in which he remained active until the end of his life. In the same year he developed the concept of the color sphere.<ref>Maltzahn, H. 1940, ''Philipp Otto Runge's Briefwechsel mit Goethe'', Weimar: Verlag der [[Goethe-Gesellschaft]].</ref> In 1808 he intensified his work on color, including making [[color triangle|disk color]] mixture experiments. He also published written versions of two local folk fairy tales ''The fisherman and his wife'' and ''The almond tree'', later included among the [[Grimm's Fairy Tales|tales of the brothers Grimm]]. In 1809 Runge completed his work on the manuscript of ''Farben-Kugel'' (Color sphere), published in 1810 in Hamburg.<ref>Runge, P. O. 1810, ''Die Farben-Kugel, oder Construction des Verhaeltnisses aller Farben zueinander'', Hamburg: Perthes.</ref> In the same year, ill with tuberculosis, Runge painted another self-portrait as well as portraits of his family and brother Daniel. The last of his four children was born on the day after Runge's death.<ref>Runge, P. O. 1840/41, ''Hinterlassene Schriften', 2. vols., D. Runge, ed., Hamburg: Perthes.'</ref>\n\n[[File:Philipp Otto Runge 001.jpg|thumb|upright|''Der Morgen'' (\"Morning\", 1808), oil on canvas]]\n[[File:Philipp Otto Runge - A Stalk of Lilies with Six Blooms.jpg|thumb|<center>''A Stalk of Lilies with Six Blooms''</center>]]\n\nRunge was of a mystical, deeply Christian turn of mind, and in his artistic work he tried to express notions of the harmony of the universe through symbolism of colour, form, and numbers. He considered blue, yellow, and red to be symbolic of the Christian trinity and equated blue with God and the night, red with morning, evening, and Jesus, and yellow with the Holy Spirit (Runge 1841, I, p.&nbsp;17). He also wrote poetry and to this end he planned a series of four [[painting]]s called ''The Times of the Day'', designed to be seen in a special building and viewed to the accompaniment of [[music]] and [[poetry]]. This concept was common to romantic artists, who tried to achieve a \"total art\", or a fusion between all forms of art. In 1803 Runge had large-format engravings made of the drawings of the ''Times of the Day'' series that became commercially successful and a set of which he presented to Goethe. He painted two versions of ''Morning'' (Kunsthalle, Hamburg), but the others did not advance beyond drawings. \"Morning\" was the start of a new type of landscape, one of religion and emotion.\n\nRunge was also one of the best German [[portrait]]ists of his period; several examples are in Hamburg. His style was rigid, sharp, and intense, at times almost na\u00efve.\n\n== Runge and color ==\n\n[[Image:Runge Farbenkugel.jpg|thumb|left|Runge's ''Farbenkugel'' (color sphere)]]\nRunge's interest in color was the natural result of his work as a painter and of having an enquiring mind. Among his accepted tenets was that \"as is known, there are only three colors, yellow, red, and blue\" (letter to Goethe of July 3, 1806). His goal was to establish the complete world of colors resulting from mixture of the three, among themselves and together with white and black. In the same lengthy letter, Runge discussed in some detail his views on color order and included a sketch of a mixture circle, with the three primary colors forming an equilateral triangle and, together with their pair-wise mixtures, a hexagon.\n\nHe arrived at the concept of the color sphere sometime in 1807, as indicated in his letter to Goethe of November 21 of that year, by expanding the hue circle into a sphere, with white and black forming the two opposing poles. A [[color solid|color mixture solid]] of a double-triangular pyramid had been proposed by [[Tobias Mayer]] in 1758, a fact known to Runge. His expansion of that solid into a sphere appears to have had an idealistic basis rather than one of logical necessity. With his disk color mixture experiments of 1807, he hoped to provide scientific support for the sphere form. Encouraged by Goethe and other friends, he wrote in 1808 a manuscript describing the color sphere, published in Hamburg early in 1810. In addition to a description of the color sphere, it contains an illustrated essay on rules of color harmony and one on color in nature written by Runge's friend [[Henrik Steffens]]. An included hand-colored plate shows two different views of the surface of the sphere as well as horizontal and vertical slices showing the organization of its interior (see figure on left).\n\nRunge's premature death limited the impact of this work. Goethe, who had read the manuscript before publication, mentioned it in his ''[[Theory of Colours (book)|Farbenlehre]]'' of 1810 as \"successfully concluding this kind of effort.\" It was soon overshadowed by [[Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul]]'s hemispherical system of 1839. A spherical color order system was patented in 1900 by [[Albert Henry Munsell]], soon replaced with an irregular form of the solid.\n\n== Legacy ==\nRunge has been included in numerous major retrospective exhibitions, including the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|Metropolitan Museum of Art's]], \"German Masters of the Nineteenth Century\" and the [[Kunsthalle Hamburg|Hamburg Kunsthalle's]], \"Runge\u2019s Cosmos\".

It is based on the true story of [[Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo Odone|Augusto and Michaela Odone]], two parents in a relentless search for a cure for their son [[Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo Odone|Lorenzo]]'s [[adrenoleukodystrophy]] (ALD). It was filmed primarily from September 1991 to February 1992 in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].<ref>{{cite news | title= Pittsburgh - City lands good share of movies| url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=V19cAAAAIBAJ&sjid=s1YNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1397%2C300980|date= 10 December 1995|work= The Vindicator}}</ref> The film had a limited release in North America on December 30, 1992, with a nationwide release two weeks later on January 15, 1993. It was generally well received by the critics and received two nominations at the [[65th Academy Awards]] but was a [[box office bomb]], grossing only $7.2 million against its $30 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n\n[[Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo Odone|Lorenzo]] is a bright and vibrant young boy living in the [[Comoro Islands]], as his father [[Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo Odone|Augusto]] works for the [[World Bank]] and is stationed there. However, when his parents relocate back to the United States, he begins to show signs of neurological problems (such as falling, loss of hearing, tantrums, etc.). The boy is diagnosed as having [[adrenoleukodystrophy]] (ALD), which is fatal within two years. Failing to find a doctor capable of treating their son's rare disease Augusto and his wife, [[Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo Odone|Michaela]], set out on a mission to find a treatment to save their son. In their quest, the Odones clash with doctors, scientists and a support group that is skeptical that anything could be done about ALD, much less by laypeople. But they persist, setting up camp in medical libraries, reviewing animal experiments, enlisting the aid of Professor Gus Nikolais, badgering researchers, questioning top doctors all over the world and even organizing an international symposium about the disease.\n\nDespite research dead-ends, the horror of watching their son's health decline and being surrounded by skeptics (including the coordinators of the support group they attend), they persist until they finally hit upon a therapy involving adding a certain kind of [[Lorenzo's oil|oil]] (actually containing two specific [[long chain fatty acids]], isolated from  [[rapeseed oil]] and [[olive oil]]) to their son's diet. They contact over 100 firms around the world until they find an elderly British chemist, Don Suddaby, who is working for [[Croda International]] and is willing to take on the challenge of distilling the proper formula. The oil, [[erucic acid]], proves successful in normalizing the accumulation of the very long chain fatty acids in the brain that had been causing their son's steady decline, thereby halting the progression of the disease. There is still a great deal of neurological damage remaining which could not be reversed unless new treatments could be found to regenerate the [[myelin sheath]] (a [[lipid]] insulator) around the nerves. The father is seen taking on the new challenge of organizing [[The Myelin Project|biomedical efforts to heal myelin damage in patients]].\n\nFinally, Lorenzo, at the age of 14, shows definite improvement (swallowing for himself and answering \"yes\" or \"no\" questions by blinking) but more medical research is still needed. Ultimately, it is revealed that Lorenzo has regained his sight, can move his head from side to side, vocalize simple sounds and is learning to use a computer.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Nick Nolte]] as [[Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo Odone|Augusto Odone]]\n*[[Susan Sarandon]] as [[Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo Odone|Michaela Odone]]\n*[[Zack O'Malley Greenburg]] as [[Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo Odone|Lorenzo Odone]]\n*[[Peter Ustinov]] as [[Hugo Moser (scientist)|Professor Gus Nikolais]]\n*[[Kathleen Wilhoite]] as Deirdre Murphy\n*[[Gerry Bamman]] as Doctor Judalon\n*[[Margo Martindale]] as Wendy Gimble\n*[[James Rebhorn]] as Ellard Muscatine\n*[[Ann Hearn]] as Loretta Muscatine\n*Maduka Steady as Omouri\n*Mary Wakio as Comorian Teacher\n*Don Suddaby as himself\n*Colin Ward as Jake Gimble\n*[[LaTanya Richardson|La Tanya Richardson]] as Nurse Ruth\n*[[Jennifer Dundas]] as Nurse Nancy Jo\n*William Cameron as Pellerman\n*[[Peter Mackenzie]] as Immunosuppression Doctor\n*[[Laura Linney]] as Young Teacher\n*[[Elizabeth Daily]] as vocal effects for [[Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo Odone|Lorenzo]] \n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nPrincipal photography for ''Lorenzo's Oil'' began on September 9, 1991 in [[Ben Avon, Pennsylvania]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Blank|first1=Ed|title=Producer excited about Ben Avon as site for movie 'Lorenzo's Oil'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat=19910831&id=vfkjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-WMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5983,8208963|accessdate=May 12, 2015|work=[[Pittsburgh Press]]|date=August 31, 1991}}</ref>\n\nPossibly to emphasize the \"Everyman\" aspect of the plot (the notion that a cure could affect families and individuals anywhere), many smaller roles were played by inexperienced actors or non-actors with unusual physical features and mannerisms.

It was filmed primarily from September 1991 to February 1992 in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].<ref>{{cite news | title= Pittsburgh - City lands good share of movies| url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=V19cAAAAIBAJ&sjid=s1YNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1397%2C300980|date= 10 December 1995|work= The Vindicator}}</ref> The film had a limited release in North America on December 30, 1992, with a nationwide release two weeks later on January 15, 1993. It was generally well received by the critics and received two nominations at the [[65th Academy Awards]] but was a [[box office bomb]], grossing only $7.2 million against its $30 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n\n[[Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo Odone|Lorenzo]] is a bright and vibrant young boy living in the [[Comoro Islands]], as his father [[Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo Odone|Augusto]] works for the [[World Bank]] and is stationed there. However, when his parents relocate back to the United States, he begins to show signs of neurological problems (such as falling, loss of hearing, tantrums, etc.). The boy is diagnosed as having [[adrenoleukodystrophy]] (ALD), which is fatal within two years. Failing to find a doctor capable of treating their son's rare disease Augusto and his wife, [[Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo Odone|Michaela]], set out on a mission to find a treatment to save their son. In their quest, the Odones clash with doctors, scientists and a support group that is skeptical that anything could be done about ALD, much less by laypeople. But they persist, setting up camp in medical libraries, reviewing animal experiments, enlisting the aid of Professor Gus Nikolais, badgering researchers, questioning top doctors all over the world and even organizing an international symposium about the disease.\n\nDespite research dead-ends, the horror of watching their son's health decline and being surrounded by skeptics (including the coordinators of the support group they attend), they persist until they finally hit upon a therapy involving adding a certain kind of [[Lorenzo's oil|oil]] (actually containing two specific [[long chain fatty acids]], isolated from  [[rapeseed oil]] and [[olive oil]]) to their son's diet. They contact over 100 firms around the world until they find an elderly British chemist, Don Suddaby, who is working for [[Croda International]] and is willing to take on the challenge of distilling the proper formula. The oil, [[erucic acid]], proves successful in normalizing the accumulation of the very long chain fatty acids in the brain that had been causing their son's steady decline, thereby halting the progression of the disease. There is still a great deal of neurological damage remaining which could not be reversed unless new treatments could be found to regenerate the [[myelin sheath]] (a [[lipid]] insulator) around the nerves. The father is seen taking on the new challenge of organizing [[The Myelin Project|biomedical efforts to heal myelin damage in patients]].\n\nFinally, Lorenzo, at the age of 14, shows definite improvement (swallowing for himself and answering \"yes\" or \"no\" questions by blinking) but more medical research is still needed. Ultimately, it is revealed that Lorenzo has regained his sight, can move his head from side to side, vocalize simple sounds and is learning to use a computer.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Nick Nolte]] as [[Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo Odone|Augusto Odone]]\n*[[Susan Sarandon]] as [[Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo Odone|Michaela Odone]]\n*[[Zack O'Malley Greenburg]] as [[Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo Odone|Lorenzo Odone]]\n*[[Peter Ustinov]] as [[Hugo Moser (scientist)|Professor Gus Nikolais]]\n*[[Kathleen Wilhoite]] as Deirdre Murphy\n*[[Gerry Bamman]] as Doctor Judalon\n*[[Margo Martindale]] as Wendy Gimble\n*[[James Rebhorn]] as Ellard Muscatine\n*[[Ann Hearn]] as Loretta Muscatine\n*Maduka Steady as Omouri\n*Mary Wakio as Comorian Teacher\n*Don Suddaby as himself\n*Colin Ward as Jake Gimble\n*[[LaTanya Richardson|La Tanya Richardson]] as Nurse Ruth\n*[[Jennifer Dundas]] as Nurse Nancy Jo\n*William Cameron as Pellerman\n*[[Peter Mackenzie]] as Immunosuppression Doctor\n*[[Laura Linney]] as Young Teacher\n*[[Elizabeth Daily]] as vocal effects for [[Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo Odone|Lorenzo]] \n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nPrincipal photography for ''Lorenzo's Oil'' began on September 9, 1991 in [[Ben Avon, Pennsylvania]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Blank|first1=Ed|title=Producer excited about Ben Avon as site for movie 'Lorenzo's Oil'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat=19910831&id=vfkjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-WMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5983,8208963|accessdate=May 12, 2015|work=[[Pittsburgh Press]]|date=August 31, 1991}}</ref>\n\nPossibly to emphasize the \"Everyman\" aspect of the plot (the notion that a cure could affect families and individuals anywhere), many smaller roles were played by inexperienced actors or non-actors with unusual physical features and mannerisms.

For example: [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb's Law]] is suppressed by the screening to yield a distance-dependent charge,  <math>Q \\rightarrow Q e^{-r/\\alpha}</math>, i.e., the charge Q is reduced exponentially with the distance divided by a screening length \u03b1. In a QGP, the [[color charge]] of the [[quark]]s and [[gluon]]s is screened. The QGP has other analogies with a normal plasma. There are also dissimilarities because the color charge is [[non-abelian group|non-abelian]], whereas the [[electric charge]] is abelian. Outside a finite volume of QGP the color-electric field is not screened, so that a volume of QGP must still be color-neutral. It will therefore, like a nucleus, have integer electric charge.\n\nBecause of the extremely high energies involved, quark-antiquark pairs are produced by [[pair production]] and thus QGP is a roughly equal mixture of quarks and antiquarks of various flavors, with only a slight excess of quarks. This property is not a general feature of conventional plasmas, which may be too cool for pair production (see however [[pair instability supernova]]).\n\n=== Theory ===\n\nOne consequence of this difference is that the [[color charge]] is too large for [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbative]] computations which are the mainstay of [[Quantum electrodynamics|QED]]. As a result, the main theoretical tools to explore the theory of the QGP is [[lattice gauge theory]].<ref name=\"Karsch\">https://arxiv.org/PS_cache/hep-lat/pdf/9503/9503010v1.pdf</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |title=The Quark-Gluon Plasma |journal=Nuclear Physics A |volume=862\u2013863 |issue=12 |pages=4\u201312 |doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2011.05.014|year=2011 |arxiv=1101.3937 |last1=Satz |first1=Helmut |bibcode = 2011NuPhA.862....4S }}</ref> The transition temperature (approximately {{val|175|ul=MeV}}) was first predicted by lattice gauge theory. Since then lattice gauge theory has been used to predict many other properties of this kind of matter. The [[AdS/CFT correspondence]] conjecture may provide insights in QGP, moreover the ultimate goal of the fluid/gravity correspondence is to understand QGP. The QGP is believed to be a phase of QCD which is completely locally thermalized and thus suitable for an effective fluid dynamic description.\n\n=== Production ===\n\nThe QGP can be created by heating matter up to a [[temperature]] of {{val|2|e=12|ul=K}}, which amounts to {{val|175|u=MeV}} per particle. This can be accomplished by colliding two large nuclei at high energy (note that {{val|175|u=MeV}} is not the energy of the colliding beam). [[Lead]] and [[gold]] [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] have been used for such collisions at [[CERN]] [[Super Proton Synchrotron|SPS]] and [[Brookhaven National Laboratory|BNL]] [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider|RHIC]], respectively. The nuclei are accelerated to [[Ultrarelativistic limit|ultrarelativistic speeds]] ([[Length contraction|contracting their length]]) and directed towards each other, creating a \"fireball\", in the rare event of a collision. Hydrodynamic simulation predicts this fireball will expand under its own [[pressure]], and cool while expanding. By carefully studying the spherical and [[elliptic flow]], experimentalists put the theory to test.\n\n=== How the QGP fits into the general scheme of physics ===\n\n[[Quantum chromodynamics|QCD]] is one part of the modern theory of [[particle physics]] called the [[Standard Model]]. Other parts of this theory deal with [[electroweak interaction]]s and [[neutrino]]s. The [[quantum electrodynamics|theory of electrodynamics]] has been tested and found correct to a few parts in a billion. The [[electroweak interaction|theory of weak interactions]] has been tested and found correct to a few parts in a thousand. Perturbative forms of QCD have been tested to a few percent. Perturbative models assume relatively small changes from the ground state, i.e. relatively low temperatures and densities, which simplifies calculations at the cost of generality. In contrast, non-perturbative forms of QCD have barely been tested. The study of the QGP, which has both a high temperature and density, is part of this effort to consolidate the grand theory of particle physics.\n\nThe study of the QGP is also a testing ground for [[Thermal quantum field theory|finite temperature field theory]], a branch of theoretical physics which seeks to understand particle physics under conditions of high temperature. Such studies are important to understand the early evolution of our universe: [[Timeline of the Big Bang#Very early universe|the first hundred microseconds]] or so. It is crucial to the physics goals of a new generation of observations of the universe ([[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]] and its successors). It is also of relevance to [[grand unification theory|Grand Unification Theories]] which seek to unify the three fundamental forces of nature (excluding gravity).\n\n== Expected properties ==\n\n=== Thermodynamics ===\nThe cross-over temperature from the normal hadronic to the QGP phase is about {{val|175|u=MeV}}. This \"crossover\" may actually ''not'' be only a qualitative feature, but instead one may have to do with a true (second order) phase transition, e.g. of the universality class of the three-dimensional Ising model. The phenomena involved correspond to an energy density of a little less than {{val|1|u=[[Electronvolt|GeV]]/fm<sup>3</sup>}}. For [[Relativistic particle|relativistic]] matter, pressure and temperature are not independent variables, so the [[equation of state]] is a relation between the energy density and the pressure. This has been found through [[lattice gauge theory|lattice computations]], and compared to both [[perturbation theory]] and [[string theory]]. This is still a matter of active research. Response functions such as the [[Specific heat capacity|specific heat]] and various quark number susceptibilities are currently being computed.\n\n=== Flow ===\nThe equation of state is an important input into the flow equations. The [[speed of sound]] is currently under investigation in lattice computations. The [[mean free path]] of quarks and gluons has been computed using [[perturbation theory]] as well as [[string theory]]. [[Lattice gauge theory|Lattice computations]] have been slower here, although the first computations of [[viscosity|transport coefficients]] have recently been concluded. These indicate that the [[mean free time]] of quarks and gluons in the QGP may be comparable to the average interparticle spacing: hence the QGP is a liquid as far as its flow properties go. This is very much an active field of research, and these conclusions may evolve rapidly. The incorporation of dissipative phenomena into hydrodynamics is another recent development that is still in an active stage.\n\nIn short, a quark\u2013gluon plasma flows like a splat of liquid, and because it's not \"transparent\" with respect to quarks, it can attenuate [[Jet (particle physics)|jets]] emitted by collisions. Furthermore, once formed, a ball of quark\u2013gluon plasma, like any hot object, transfers heat internally by radiation. However, unlike in everyday objects, there is enough energy available that [[gluon]]s (particles mediating the [[strong force]]) collide and produce an excess of the heavy (i.e. [[Mass-energy equivalence|high-energy]]) [[strange quarks]]. Whereas, if the QGP didn't exist and there was a pure collision, the same energy would be converted into a nonequilibrium mixture containing even heavier quarks such as [[charm quark]]s or [[bottom quark]]s.\n\n=== Excitation spectrum ===\nThe study of thermodynamic and flow properties indicate that the assumption of QGP consisting almost entirely of free quarks and gluons is an over-simplification. Many ideas are currently being developed and will be put to test in the near future. It has been hypothesized recently that some mesons built from heavy quarks do not dissolve until the temperature reaches about {{val|350|u=MeV}}. This has led to speculation that many other kinds of bound states may exist in the plasma. Some static properties of the plasma (similar to the [[Debye length|Debye screening length]]) constrain the excitation spectrum.\n\n=== Glasma hypothesis ===\nSince 2008, there is a discussion about a hypothetical precursor state of the quark\u2013gluon plasma, the so-called \"Glasma\", where the dressed particles are condensed into some kind of glassy (or amorphous) state, below the genuine transition between the confined state and the plasma liquid.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=From Glasma to Quark Gluon Plasma in heavy ion collisions |year=2008 |arxiv=0806.1356 |bibcode = 2008JPhG...35j4003V |doi = 10.1088/0954-3899/35/10/104003 |volume=35 |issue=10 |journal=Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics |page=104003|last1=Venugopalan |first1=Raju }}</ref> This would be analogous to the formation of metallic glasses, or amorphous alloys of them, below the genuine onset of the liquid metallic state.\n\n== Experimental situation ==\nThere is an overwhelming evidence for production of quark-gluon plasma in relativistic heavy ion collisions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Busza|first=Wit|last2=Rajagopal|first2=Krishna|last3=van der Schee|first3=Wilke|year=2018|title=Heavy ion collisions: The big picture and the big questions|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-nucl-101917-020852|journal=Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science|language=en|volume=68|issue=1|pages=339\u2013376|doi=10.1146/annurev-nucl-101917-020852|issn=0163-8998|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=ALICE Collaboration|first=|year=2017|title=Enhanced production of multi-strange hadrons in high-multiplicity proton\u2013proton collisions|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nphys4111|journal=Nature Physics|language=en|volume=13|issue=6|pages=535\u2013539|doi=10.1038/nphys4111|issn=1745-2473|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Koch|first=Peter|last2=M\u00fcller|first2=Berndt|last3=Rafelski|first3=Johann|year=2017|title=From strangeness enhancement to quark\u2013gluon plasma discovery|url=https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0217751X17300241|journal=International Journal of Modern Physics A|language=en|volume=32|issue=31|pages=1730024|doi=10.1142/S0217751X17300241|issn=0217-751X|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=The WA97 Collaboration|first=|last2=|first2=|year=2000|title=Transverse mass spectra of strange and multi\u2013strange particles in Pb\u2013Pb collisions at 158 A GeV/c|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s100520000386|journal=The European Physical Journal C|language=en|volume=14|issue=4|pages=633\u2013641|doi=10.1007/s100520000386|issn=1434-6044|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe important classes of experimental observations are\n\n* [[Strangeness production]]\n* [[Elliptic flow]]\n* [[Jet quenching]]\n*[[J/\u03c8#J/\u03c8 melting|J/\u03c8 melting]]\n* [[Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect]] and [[Bose\u2013Einstein correlations]]\n*[[single particle spectrum|Single particle spectra]] ([[photons]] and [[dilepton]]s)\n\n== In laboratory formation of deconfined \u00a0matter ==\nThe formation of a quark-gluon plasma occurs as a result of a [[strong interaction]] between the [[partons]] ([[Quark|quarks]], [[Gluon|gluons]]) that make up the nucleons of the colliding heavy nuclei called heavy ions.

While at first a phase transition was expected, present day theoretical interpretations propose a phase transformation similar to the process of ionisation of normal matter into ionic and electron plasma.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hwa|first=Rudolph C|url=https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/7588|title=Quark-Gluon Plasma 4|last2=Wang|first2=Xin-Nian|publisher=World Scientific|year=2010|isbn=978-981-4293-28-0|location=|pages=|language=en|doi=10.1142/7588}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |journal=CERN Courier|volume=60|pages=40\u201346 |last=Mangano |first=Michelangelo |eprint=2003.05976 |title=LHC at 10: the physics legacy|url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/2712176|issue=2|year=2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shuryak|first=Edward|year=2017|title=Strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma in heavy ion collisions|url=http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/RevModPhys.89.035001|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|language=en|volume=89|issue=3|pages=035001|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.89.035001|issn=0034-6861|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pasechnik|first=Roman|last2=\u0160umbera|first2=Michal|year=2017|title=Phenomenological review on quark\u2013gluon plasma: concepts vs. observations|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2218-1997/3/1/7|journal=Universe|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=7|doi=10.3390/universe3010007|issn=2218-1997|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite report|last=Ludlam|first=T.|last2=Aronson|first2=S.|year=2005|title=Hunting the quark gluon plasma|url=http://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/15015225-XIVUcW/native/|journal=Report|docket=BNL-73847-2005|language=en|publisher=Brookhaven National Laboratory|doi=10.2172/15015225|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Reasons for studying the formation of quark-gluon plasma ===\nThe generally accepted model of the formation of the [[Universe]] states that it happened as the result of the [[Big Bang]]. In this model, in the time interval of 10<sup>\u201310</sup>\u201310<sup>\u20136</sup> s after the Big Bang, matter existed in the form of a quark-gluon plasma. It is possible to reproduce the density and temperature of matter existing of that time in laboratory conditions to study the characteristics of the very Universe. So far, the only possibility is the collision of two heavy [[Atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] accelerated to energies of more than a hundred GeV. Using the result of a head-on collision in the volume approximately equal to the volume of the atomic nucleus, it is possible to model the density and temperature that existed in the first instants of the life of the Universe.\n\n=== Production of quark-gluon plasma in accelerators ===\nQuark-gluon plasma experiments are conducted at the largest accelerators at the highest possible energies of colliding beams of relativistic nuclei. \n[[File:Table results.png|thumb|The table shows the collision energies per nucleon of the colliding nuclei achieved at the Bevatron (Billions of eV Synchrotron), AGS (Alternating Gradient Synchrotron) and RHIC (Relative Heavy Ion Collider) accelerators at the BNL (Brookhaven National Laboratory) and at the LHC accelerator ( Large Hardon Collider) at CERN. [3]]]\n\nSome results of the experiments: \n\n\u00b7 Experimental data obtained at the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider|RHIC]] and [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]] showed that the collision of heavy nuclei cannot be considered as a simple additive set of pp-collisions. \n\n\u00b7 In collisions of heavy nuclei, new previously unknown collective properties of the quark-gluon medium are manifested. \n\n\u00b7 The resulting quark-gluon medium in its properties resembles a superconducting liquid with a low [[Viscosity|viscosity coefficient]]. \n\n\u00b7 A comparison of the data from the STAR and ALICE collaborations shows that the lifetime of the quark-gluon medium formed in the collision of lead nuclei in the ALICE collaboration is almost two times higher than the corresponding result obtained by the STAR collaboration and amounts to 10\u201311 Fm/s. \n[[File:Schematic representation of the interaction region formed.png|thumb|Schematic representation of the interaction region formed in the first moments after the collision of heavy ions with high energies in the accelerator. [4]]]\n\u00b7 The formation of an elliptical flow and the quenching of jets in a dense quark-gluon medium are confirmed. \n\nTo study the properties of the quark-gluon medium further, more detailed information is needed on the deconfinement mechanism in the quark-gluon medium, the hadronization mechanism, quenching of jets in the quark-gluon plasma, angular distributions of products, and especially on the formation of hadrons containing heavy quarks and [[antiquarks]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601131517/http:/livefromcern.web.cern.ch/livefromcern/antimatter/history/AM-history01-b.html|title=The History fo Antimatter - from 1928 to 1995|date=2008-06-01|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref> \n\n=== Quark-gluon plasma density ===\nThe central issue of the formation of a quark-gluon plasma remains as follows: whether [[energy density]] can be achieved in nucleus-nucleus collisions and how does it evolve over time? The answer to this question depends on how much energy each nucleon loses, of accelerated nuclei in a collision of beams.\n\nUsually, there are three different stages of nuclear collision distinguished: \n\n\u00b7 The maximum density is reached at the time of complete overlapping of the colliding nuclei. \n\n\u00b7 The maximum energy density transferred to particles born in a fireball. \n\n\u00b7 The maximum energy density at the moment of the local thermalization of a quark-gluon plasma.\n\n=== Jet quenching effect at RHIC energies ===\nOne of the most striking physical effects obtained at RHIC energies is the effect of quenching jets. At the first stage of interaction of colliding relativistic nuclei, partons of the colliding nuclei give rise to the secondary partons with a large transverse impulse \u2265 3\u20136 GeV / s. Passing through a highly heated compressed plasma, partons lose energy. The magnitude of the energy loss by the parton depends on the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (temperature, density). In addition, it is also necessary to take into \n\naccount the fact that colored quarks and gluons are the elementary objects of the plasma, which differs from the energy loss by a parton in a medium consisting of colorless [[Hadron|hadrons]]. Under the conditions of a quark-gluon plasma, the energy losses resulting from the RHIC energies by partons are estimated as dE / dx = 1 GeV / fm. This conclusion is confirmed by comparing the relative yield of hadrons with a large transverse impulse in nucleon-nucleon and nucleus-nucleus collisions at the same collision energy. The energy loss by partons with a large transverse impulse in nucleon-nucleon collisions is much smaller than in nucleus-nucleus collisions, which leads to a decrease in the yield of high-energy hadrons in nucleus-nucleus collisions. This result suggests that nuclear collisions cannot be regarded as a simple superposition of nucleon-nucleon collisions. For a short time, ~ 1 \u03bcs and in the final volume, quarks and gluons form some ideal liquid. The collective properties of this fluid are manifested during its movement as a whole. Therefore, when moving partons in this medium, it is necessary to take into account some collective properties of this quark-gluon liquid. Energy losses depend on the properties of the quark-gluon medium, on the parton density in the resulting fireball, and on the dynamics of its expansion. Losses of energy by light and heavy quarks during the passage of a fireball turn out to be approximately the same.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schukraft|first=J\u00fcrgen|url=https://indico.cern.ch/event/114939/contributions/62599/attachments/48842/70225/CERN_HI_Dec_2010.pdf|title=ALICE\u2014'Little Bang' : The first 3 weeks ...|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* {{open access}} [http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-17545-4 Melting hadrons, boiling quarks] : from Hagedorn temperature to ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions at CERN : with a tribute to Rolf Hagedorn, ed.

For example: [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb's Law]] is suppressed by the screening to yield a distance-dependent charge,  <math>Q \\rightarrow Q e^{-r/\\alpha}</math>, i.e., the charge Q is reduced exponentially with the distance divided by a screening length \u03b1. In a QGP, the [[color charge]] of the [[quark]]s and [[gluon]]s is screened. The QGP has other analogies with a normal plasma. There are also dissimilarities because the color charge is [[non-abelian group|non-abelian]], whereas the [[electric charge]] is abelian. Outside a finite volume of QGP the color-electric field is not screened, so that a volume of QGP must still be color-neutral. It will therefore, like a nucleus, have integer electric charge.\n\nBecause of the extremely high energies involved, quark-antiquark pairs are produced by [[pair production]] and thus QGP is a roughly equal mixture of quarks and antiquarks of various flavors, with only a slight excess of quarks. This property is not a general feature of conventional plasmas, which may be too cool for pair production (see however [[pair instability supernova]]).\n\n=== Theory ===\n\nOne consequence of this difference is that the [[color charge]] is too large for [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbative]] computations which are the mainstay of [[Quantum electrodynamics|QED]]. As a result, the main theoretical tools to explore the theory of the QGP is [[lattice gauge theory]].<ref name=\"Karsch\">https://arxiv.org/PS_cache/hep-lat/pdf/9503/9503010v1.pdf</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |title=The Quark-Gluon Plasma |journal=Nuclear Physics A |volume=862\u2013863 |issue=12 |pages=4\u201312 |doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2011.05.014|year=2011 |arxiv=1101.3937 |last1=Satz |first1=Helmut |bibcode = 2011NuPhA.862....4S }}</ref> The transition temperature (approximately {{val|175|ul=MeV}}) was first predicted by lattice gauge theory. Since then lattice gauge theory has been used to predict many other properties of this kind of matter. The [[AdS/CFT correspondence]] conjecture may provide insights in QGP, moreover the ultimate goal of the fluid/gravity correspondence is to understand QGP. The QGP is believed to be a phase of QCD which is completely locally thermalized and thus suitable for an effective fluid dynamic description.\n\n=== Production ===\n\nThe QGP can be created by heating matter up to a [[temperature]] of {{val|2|e=12|ul=K}}, which amounts to {{val|175|u=MeV}} per particle. This can be accomplished by colliding two large nuclei at high energy (note that {{val|175|u=MeV}} is not the energy of the colliding beam). [[Lead]] and [[gold]] [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] have been used for such collisions at [[CERN]] [[Super Proton Synchrotron|SPS]] and [[Brookhaven National Laboratory|BNL]] [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider|RHIC]], respectively. The nuclei are accelerated to [[Ultrarelativistic limit|ultrarelativistic speeds]] ([[Length contraction|contracting their length]]) and directed towards each other, creating a \"fireball\", in the rare event of a collision. Hydrodynamic simulation predicts this fireball will expand under its own [[pressure]], and cool while expanding. By carefully studying the spherical and [[elliptic flow]], experimentalists put the theory to test.\n\n=== How the QGP fits into the general scheme of physics ===\n\n[[Quantum chromodynamics|QCD]] is one part of the modern theory of [[particle physics]] called the [[Standard Model]]. Other parts of this theory deal with [[electroweak interaction]]s and [[neutrino]]s. The [[quantum electrodynamics|theory of electrodynamics]] has been tested and found correct to a few parts in a billion. The [[electroweak interaction|theory of weak interactions]] has been tested and found correct to a few parts in a thousand. Perturbative forms of QCD have been tested to a few percent. Perturbative models assume relatively small changes from the ground state, i.e. relatively low temperatures and densities, which simplifies calculations at the cost of generality. In contrast, non-perturbative forms of QCD have barely been tested. The study of the QGP, which has both a high temperature and density, is part of this effort to consolidate the grand theory of particle physics.\n\nThe study of the QGP is also a testing ground for [[Thermal quantum field theory|finite temperature field theory]], a branch of theoretical physics which seeks to understand particle physics under conditions of high temperature. Such studies are important to understand the early evolution of our universe: [[Timeline of the Big Bang#Very early universe|the first hundred microseconds]] or so. It is crucial to the physics goals of a new generation of observations of the universe ([[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]] and its successors). It is also of relevance to [[grand unification theory|Grand Unification Theories]] which seek to unify the three fundamental forces of nature (excluding gravity).\n\n== Expected properties ==\n\n=== Thermodynamics ===\nThe cross-over temperature from the normal hadronic to the QGP phase is about {{val|175|u=MeV}}. This \"crossover\" may actually ''not'' be only a qualitative feature, but instead one may have to do with a true (second order) phase transition, e.g. of the universality class of the three-dimensional Ising model. The phenomena involved correspond to an energy density of a little less than {{val|1|u=[[Electronvolt|GeV]]/fm<sup>3</sup>}}. For [[Relativistic particle|relativistic]] matter, pressure and temperature are not independent variables, so the [[equation of state]] is a relation between the energy density and the pressure. This has been found through [[lattice gauge theory|lattice computations]], and compared to both [[perturbation theory]] and [[string theory]]. This is still a matter of active research. Response functions such as the [[Specific heat capacity|specific heat]] and various quark number susceptibilities are currently being computed.\n\n=== Flow ===\nThe equation of state is an important input into the flow equations. The [[speed of sound]] is currently under investigation in lattice computations. The [[mean free path]] of quarks and gluons has been computed using [[perturbation theory]] as well as [[string theory]]. [[Lattice gauge theory|Lattice computations]] have been slower here, although the first computations of [[viscosity|transport coefficients]] have recently been concluded. These indicate that the [[mean free time]] of quarks and gluons in the QGP may be comparable to the average interparticle spacing: hence the QGP is a liquid as far as its flow properties go. This is very much an active field of research, and these conclusions may evolve rapidly. The incorporation of dissipative phenomena into hydrodynamics is another recent development that is still in an active stage.\n\nIn short, a quark\u2013gluon plasma flows like a splat of liquid, and because it's not \"transparent\" with respect to quarks, it can attenuate [[Jet (particle physics)|jets]] emitted by collisions. Furthermore, once formed, a ball of quark\u2013gluon plasma, like any hot object, transfers heat internally by radiation. However, unlike in everyday objects, there is enough energy available that [[gluon]]s (particles mediating the [[strong force]]) collide and produce an excess of the heavy (i.e. [[Mass-energy equivalence|high-energy]]) [[strange quarks]]. Whereas, if the QGP didn't exist and there was a pure collision, the same energy would be converted into a nonequilibrium mixture containing even heavier quarks such as [[charm quark]]s or [[bottom quark]]s.\n\n=== Excitation spectrum ===\nThe study of thermodynamic and flow properties indicate that the assumption of QGP consisting almost entirely of free quarks and gluons is an over-simplification. Many ideas are currently being developed and will be put to test in the near future. It has been hypothesized recently that some mesons built from heavy quarks do not dissolve until the temperature reaches about {{val|350|u=MeV}}. This has led to speculation that many other kinds of bound states may exist in the plasma. Some static properties of the plasma (similar to the [[Debye length|Debye screening length]]) constrain the excitation spectrum.\n\n=== Glasma hypothesis ===\nSince 2008, there is a discussion about a hypothetical precursor state of the quark\u2013gluon plasma, the so-called \"Glasma\", where the dressed particles are condensed into some kind of glassy (or amorphous) state, below the genuine transition between the confined state and the plasma liquid.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=From Glasma to Quark Gluon Plasma in heavy ion collisions |year=2008 |arxiv=0806.1356 |bibcode = 2008JPhG...35j4003V |doi = 10.1088/0954-3899/35/10/104003 |volume=35 |issue=10 |journal=Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics |page=104003|last1=Venugopalan |first1=Raju }}</ref> This would be analogous to the formation of metallic glasses, or amorphous alloys of them, below the genuine onset of the liquid metallic state.\n\n== Experimental situation ==\nThere is an overwhelming evidence for production of quark-gluon plasma in relativistic heavy ion collisions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Busza|first=Wit|last2=Rajagopal|first2=Krishna|last3=van der Schee|first3=Wilke|year=2018|title=Heavy ion collisions: The big picture and the big questions|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-nucl-101917-020852|journal=Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science|language=en|volume=68|issue=1|pages=339\u2013376|doi=10.1146/annurev-nucl-101917-020852|issn=0163-8998|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=ALICE Collaboration|first=|year=2017|title=Enhanced production of multi-strange hadrons in high-multiplicity proton\u2013proton collisions|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nphys4111|journal=Nature Physics|language=en|volume=13|issue=6|pages=535\u2013539|doi=10.1038/nphys4111|issn=1745-2473|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Koch|first=Peter|last2=M\u00fcller|first2=Berndt|last3=Rafelski|first3=Johann|year=2017|title=From strangeness enhancement to quark\u2013gluon plasma discovery|url=https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0217751X17300241|journal=International Journal of Modern Physics A|language=en|volume=32|issue=31|pages=1730024|doi=10.1142/S0217751X17300241|issn=0217-751X|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=The WA97 Collaboration|first=|last2=|first2=|year=2000|title=Transverse mass spectra of strange and multi\u2013strange particles in Pb\u2013Pb collisions at 158 A GeV/c|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s100520000386|journal=The European Physical Journal C|language=en|volume=14|issue=4|pages=633\u2013641|doi=10.1007/s100520000386|issn=1434-6044|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe important classes of experimental observations are\n\n* [[Strangeness production]]\n* [[Elliptic flow]]\n* [[Jet quenching]]\n*[[J/\u03c8#J/\u03c8 melting|J/\u03c8 melting]]\n* [[Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect]] and [[Bose\u2013Einstein correlations]]\n*[[single particle spectrum|Single particle spectra]] ([[photons]] and [[dilepton]]s)\n\n== In laboratory formation of deconfined \u00a0matte ==\nThe formation of a quark-gluon plasma occurs as a result of a [[strong interaction]] between the [[partons]] ([[Quark|quarks]], [[Gluon|gluons]]) that make up the nucleons of the colliding heavy nuclei called heavy ions.

In this model, in the time interval of 10<sup>\u201310</sup>\u201310<sup>\u20136</sup> s after the Big Bang, matter existed in the form of a quark-gluon plasma. It is possible to reproduce the density and temperature of matter existing of that time in laboratory conditions to study the characteristics of the very Universe. So far, the only possibility is the collision of two heavy [[Atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] accelerated to energies of more than a hundred GeV. Using the result of a head-on collision in the volume approximately equal to the volume of the atomic nucleus, it is possible to model the density and temperature that existed in the first instants of the life of the Universe.\n\n=== Production of quark-gluon plasma in accelerators ===\nQuark-gluon plasma experiments are conducted at the largest accelerators at the highest possible energies of colliding beams of relativistic nuclei. \n[[File:Table results.png|thumb|The table shows the collision energies per nucleon of the colliding nuclei achieved at the Bevatron (Billions of eV Synchrotron), AGS (Alternating Gradient Synchrotron) and RHIC (Relative Heavy Ion Collider) accelerators at the BNL (Brookhaven National Laboratory) and at the LHC accelerator ( Large Hardon Collider) at CERN. [3]]]\n\nSome results of the experiments: \n\n\u00b7 Experimental data obtained at the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider|RHIC]] and [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]] showed that the collision of heavy nuclei cannot be considered as a simple additive set of pp-collisions. \n\n\u00b7 In collisions of heavy nuclei, new previously unknown collective properties of the quark-gluon medium are manifested. \n\n\u00b7 The resulting quark-gluon medium in its properties resembles a superconducting liquid with a low [[Viscosity|viscosity coefficient]]. \n\n\u00b7 A comparison of the data from the STAR and ALICE collaborations shows that the lifetime of the quark-gluon medium formed in the collision of lead nuclei in the ALICE collaboration is almost two times higher than the corresponding result obtained by the STAR collaboration and amounts to 10\u201311 Fm/s. \n[[File:Schematic representation of the interaction region formed.png|thumb|Schematic representation of the interaction region formed in the first moments after the collision of heavy ions with high energies in the accelerator. [4]]]\n\u00b7 The formation of an elliptical flow and the quenching of jets in a dense quark-gluon medium are confirmed. \n\nTo study the properties of the quark-gluon medium further, more detailed information is needed on the deconfinement mechanism in the quark-gluon medium, the hadronization mechanism, quenching of jets in the quark-gluon plasma, angular distributions of products, and especially on the formation of hadrons containing heavy quarks and [[antiquarks]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601131517/http:/livefromcern.web.cern.ch/livefromcern/antimatter/history/AM-history01-b.html|title=The History fo Antimatter - from 1928 to 1995|date=2008-06-01|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref> \n\n=== Quark-gluon plasma density ===\nThe central issue of the formation of a quark-gluon plasma remains as follows: whether [[energy density]] can be achieved in nucleus-nucleus collisions and how does it evolve over time? The answer to this question depends on how much energy each nucleon loses, of accelerated nuclei in a collision of beams.\n\nUsually, there are three different stages of nuclear collision distinguished: \n\n\u00b7 The maximum density is reached at the time of complete overlapping of the colliding nuclei. \n\n\u00b7 The maximum energy density transferred to particles born in a fireball. \n\n\u00b7 The maximum energy density at the moment of the local thermalization of a quark-gluon plasma.\n\n=== Jet quenching effect at RHIC energies ===\nOne of the most striking physical effects obtained at RHIC energies is the effect of quenching jets. At the first stage of interaction of colliding relativistic nuclei, partons of the colliding nuclei give rise to the secondary partons with a large transverse impulse \u2265 3\u20136 GeV / s. Passing through a highly heated compressed plasma, partons lose energy. The magnitude of the energy loss by the parton depends on the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (temperature, density). In addition, it is also necessary to take into \n\naccount the fact that colored quarks and gluons are the elementary objects of the plasma, which differs from the energy loss by a parton in a medium consisting of colorless [[Hadron|hadrons]]. Under the conditions of a quark-gluon plasma, the energy losses resulting from the RHIC energies by partons are estimated as dE / dx = 1 GeV / fm. This conclusion is confirmed by comparing the relative yield of hadrons with a large transverse impulse in nucleon-nucleon and nucleus-nucleus collisions at the same collision energy. The energy loss by partons with a large transverse impulse in nucleon-nucleon collisions is much smaller than in nucleus-nucleus collisions, which leads to a decrease in the yield of high-energy hadrons in nucleus-nucleus collisions. This result suggests that nuclear collisions cannot be regarded as a simple superposition of nucleon-nucleon collisions. For a short time, ~ 1 \u03bcs and in the final volume, quarks and gluons form some ideal liquid. The collective properties of this fluid are manifested during its movement as a whole. Therefore, when moving partons in this medium, it is necessary to take into account some collective properties of this quark-gluon liquid. Energy losses depend on the properties of the quark-gluon medium, on the parton density in the resulting fireball, and on the dynamics of its expansion. Losses of energy by light and heavy quarks during the passage of a fireball turn out to be approximately the same.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schukraft|first=J\u00fcrgen|url=https://indico.cern.ch/event/114939/contributions/62599/attachments/48842/70225/CERN_HI_Dec_2010.pdf|title=ALICE\u2014'Little Bang' : The first 3 weeks ...|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* {{open access}} [http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-17545-4 Melting hadrons, boiling quarks] : from Hagedorn temperature to ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions at CERN : with a tribute to Rolf Hagedorn, ed.

After breaking ties with them, Starr and his business partner, Mary Alford, sought to create a white counterpart act.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/11/arts/pop-view-white-singers-black-style-pop-bonanza.html|title=POP VIEW; White Singers + Black Style - Pop Bonanza|first=Peter|last=Watrous|date=March 11, 1990|website=Nytimes.com}}</ref> Fifteen-year-old [[Donnie Wahlberg]] immediately impressed Starr and Alford with his rapping skills, dancing ability and showmanship, becoming the group's first member. Wahlberg assisted in helping to recruit other members. Among them were his younger brother [[Mark Wahlberg|Mark]] and his best friends [[Danny Wood]] and Jamie Kelly. He also coaxed one-time schoolmate [[Jordan Knight]] - who sang an exceptional [[falsetto]] - into auditioning for Starr as well. Upon Knight's passing the audition, his older brother [[Jonathan Knight|Jonathan]] was accepted into the group as well.<ref name=heartthrobs>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20118457,00.html|title=The Heartthrobs of America |last=Dougherty|first=Steve |date=August 13, 1990|magazine=People|accessdate=September 23, 2008}}</ref>\n\nAs the group began to take shape, Mark Wahlberg left and was briefly replaced by Jamie Kelly. When a search was made to find a [[Michael Jackson]]-esque singer to fill the role, Starr replaced Jamie with 12-year-old [[Joey McIntyre]], whom the other members initially resented for being the one to replace their friend. With the final line-up in place, Starr rehearsed the boys diligently, after school and on weekends, and eventually secured the group, at this time named Nynuk,<ref>{{cite book|title=New Kids on the Block: Five Brothers and a Million Sisters: The Authorized Biography|author=Van Noy, Nikki|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|year=2012|chapter=What's a Nynuk)?}}</ref> a recording contract at [[Columbia Records]]. However, the label demanded Starr change the name of the group. Subsequently, they settled on New Kids on the Block, after a [[hip hop music|rap]] song that Donnie Wahlberg had written and arranged for their first album.<ref name=heartthrobs />\n\n===1986: ''New Kids on the Block'' (debut album)===\n{{Main article|New Kids on the Block (album)}}\nIn April 1986, Columbia Records released the group's self-titled debut album. The album, almost exclusively written and produced by Maurice Starr, featured mid 80s [[bubblegum pop]] material. The first single, \"[[Be My Girl (New Kids on the Block song)|Be My Girl]]\", received minor airplay around the group's native Boston, but failed to capture nationwide attention. The album's second single, \"[[Stop It Girl]]\", fared even worse. The New Kids went on tour around the New England states, singing wherever Starr could book them: in bars, school dances, and clubs. Nevertheless, Starr remained diligent and persuaded the label to allow the group to record a second album.\n\n===1988\u20131989: ''Hangin' Tough''===\n{{Main article|Hangin' Tough}}\nAfter the failure of the first album, Starr had the group back in the studio for most of 1987 and 1988 recording their second album. Dissatisfied with the excessively bubblegum sound of their first album, the group wanted to have more input on their look, direction and song material. As a result, Wahlberg, Wood and Jordan Knight received [[associate producer]] credit on the final product. The album's first single was \"[[Please Don't Go Girl]]\", a ballad released in the spring of 1988. Failure seemed destined a second time when the song became another that went unnoticed by the listening public, and Columbia Records made plans to drop the New Kids from the label. At the eleventh hour, however, a pop radio station in Florida began playing the song. Scoring listener approval, it soon became the most requested song on their play list. When Columbia caught wind of the positive response, they decided to keep the group on its roster and put more effort into promoting the single. Columbia decided to re-shoot a music video for \"Please Don't Go Girl\", hiring director [[Doug Nichol]], and sent the video to thousands of radio stations across the country to show the group's visual appeal. National attention soon followed and \"Please Don't Go Girl\" eventually climbed to No. 10 on [[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard's Hot 100 Singles Chart]]\u2014becoming the group's first hit.<ref name=\"billboard\">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=new kids on the block|chart=all}}|title=Artist Chart History \u2013 New Kids on the Block|publisher=billboard.com|accessdate=September 23, 2008}}</ref>\n\nNew Kids on the Block's second album, ''Hangin' Tough'', was released to modest fanfare in September. In the meantime, the group began making national televised appearances on such music programs as ''[[Showtime at the Apollo]]'', and ''[[Soul Train]]''. Producer Maurice Starr then held auditions to secure a band of musicians suitable for touring with the New Kids approving musical director and Keyboardist Greg McPherson, bassist [[David Dyson (musician)|David Dyson]], keyboardist Yasko Kubota, guitarist Nerida Rojas, and drummer Derrick Antunes. The New Kids later landed a spot as an opening act for fellow teen-pop act [[Tiffany (American singer)|Tiffany]] on the U.S. leg of her concert tour. Sales of ''Hangin' Tough'' steadily increased as the group's national attention slowly rose. At year's end, the album's second single \"[[You Got It (The Right Stuff)]]\" was released. The song was given a huge boost when [[MTV]] took notice of the group and began playing the video in regular rotation, including an appearance on [[Club MTV]]. By early 1989, it cracked the top five.<ref name=\"billboard\" /> The New Kids hit pay dirt with their next single, \"[[I'll Be Loving You (Forever)]]\", which reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart in June.<ref name=\"billboard\" /> The group had been scheduled to open for Tiffany once again on a [[Hangin' Tough Tour|second tour]], but their sudden popularity caused a reversal, and she wound up opening for them (although the two acts were technically billed as \"co-headliners\").\n\nMore top five singles from ''Hangin' Tough'' followed into the summer and fall, including [[Hangin' Tough (song)|the title track]] and \"[[Cover Girl (New Kids on the Block song)|Cover Girl]]\". Columbia Records also released the single \"[[Didn't I (Blow Your Mind This Time)]]\" (a cover of [[The Delfonics]]' classic hit), from the group's previously overlooked debut album. The song went No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles<ref name=\"billboard\" /> on the strength of the group's popularity and effectively jump-started the sales of that album as well. By the end of 1989, ''Hangin' Tough'' had climbed to number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] Albums Chart and had gone eight-times [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]]. They, subsequently, became the first 'teen' act to garner five top ten hits from a single album.\n\nMeanwhile, a top ten charting [[Christmas and holiday season|holiday]] album, ''[[Merry, Merry Christmas]]'', was released in the fall\u2014spawning another top 10 hit, \"[[This One's for the Children]]\" and going double platinum in the U.S. The proceeds were donated to [[United Cerebral Palsy]], the New Kids' favorite charitable cause. ''Hangin' Tough'' would go on to spend 132 weeks on the chart, and in January 1990, the album won two [[American Music Awards of 1990|American Music Awards]] for \"Best Pop/Rock Album\", and \"Best Pop/Rock Group\". With the success of \"Didn't I (Blow Your Mind)\", \"Cover Girl\", and \"This One's For the Children\", the group pulled off a rare feat of having three singles on the Billboard Hot 100 at the same time, but each from a different album.\n\nColumbia Music Video also released a home video \"Hangin' Tough\", a documentary on the band directed by [[Doug Nichol]] and produced by Bryan Johnson, that included their four hit music videos and a live concert recorded during their 1989 tour. It achieved massive sales, earning a [[Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video]] nomination,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/grammy/videos.htm |title=Grammy Awards: Best Music Videos |publisher=Rock On The Net |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}</ref> and was one of the biggest selling music videos of all time.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/22/business/the-media-business-new-products-help-to-bolster-music-sales.html?pagewanted=1 | work=The New York Times | title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; New Products Help to Bolster Music Sales | first=Geraldine | last=Fabrikant | date=October 22, 1990 | accessdate=May 20, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Commonwealth of Massachusetts declared April 24, 1989, \"New Kids on the Block Day\".\n\n===1990\u20131993: ''Step by Step'' and lip syncing allegations===\n{{Main article|Step by Step (New Kids on the Block album)}}\nBy early 1990, New Kids on the Block had become one of the most popular acts in the United States. The following May, they followed up ''Hangin' Tough'' with ''Step by Step'', which featured slightly more than half of the songs co-written and produced by the members themselves. The first single, [[Step by Step (New Kids on the Block song)|the title track]], raced to number one on the Hot 100 Singles Chart<ref name=\"billboard\" /> and became their biggest selling single. It was followed up with the top ten \"[[Tonight (New Kids on the Block song)|Tonight]]\", which extended the consecutive top ten singles chart run to nine records. \"Let's Try It Again\" hit No. 8 on the UK Singles Chart, whilst \"Baby I Believe In You\" went No. 1 on the Japanese Chart, further signifying the international appeal of the group. The album was eventually certified triple platinum, selling close to 20 million copies worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=new kids on the block|bio=true}}|title=Artist Biography \u2013 New Kids on the Block|last= Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|author2=Leahey, Andrew |publisher=billboard.com|accessdate=September 23, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe group performed an estimated two hundred concerts a year, with an extravagant worldwide concert tour that summer, called ''[[The Magic Summer Tour]]'', sponsored by [[Coca-Cola|Coke]]. The tour ultimately grossed $74 million ($133 million, adjusted for inflation), making the group the top-grossing touring act in the country at the time and one of highest-grossing concert tours of the decade. The tour had an overall attendance of 3.2 million people. Their 1990 [[Pay-per-view|pay-per-view special]] broke cable-TV history at the time. During this time, the group became heavily merchandised. NKOTB-licensed merchandise included [[lunch box]]es, [[Badge|buttons]], T-shirts, [[comic books]], [[Celebrity doll|dolls]], trading cards and even a [[Saturday morning cartoon]] in their likeness, which was developed by the writing and development team from [[Pangea Corporation]] and animated by [[DIC Entertainment]]. In 1991, sales for the group's merchandise were estimated at [[United States dollar|US$]]400 million.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=P.

That summer, Wood and Wahlberg co-wrote and produced the debut album from [[Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch]]\u2014headed by Mark Wahlberg, Donnie's brother and former New Kid.

In early 1992, the group released the stand-alone single \"[[If You Go Away (New Kids on the Block song)|If You Go Away]]\", the only new track on the compilation ''[[H.I.T.S.]]''. The song peaked at No. 16 on the US charts and No. 9 in the UK charts. Meanwhile, as the music industry was still reeling from the [[Milli Vanilli]] [[Lip sync|lip-syncing]] scandal, the group found themselves accused of lip-syncing by Gregory McPherson, also a music teacher at [[Berklee College of Music]], who was listed as an associate producer and string arranger on the group's third album, ''Step by Step''. McPherson alleged that Maurice Starr sang the vocals while the group lip-synced to pre-recorded vocals during their live performances. McPherson also filed a [[breach of contract]] and creative infringement lawsuit against Starr.\n\nThe group immediately responded to the allegations and interrupted the Australian leg of their tour to fly to Los Angeles to perform live on ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]].''<ref>{{cite news|title= New Kids on the Block Let Singing Do the Talking|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=February 6, 1992|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1992-02-06/local/me-2060_1_arsenio-hall-show|accessdate=October 9, 2010 | first=Steve | last=Hochman}}</ref> After performing a medley of their previous hits and their new single, the group (along with Starr) was interviewed by Hall.

Despite their success, the group was regularly dismissed by critics for their attempts to promote themselves as an [[Hip hop culture|urban act]] and their practice of using backing vocals for live performances.

After breaking ties with them, Starr and his business partner, Mary Alford, sought to create a white counterpart act.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/11/arts/pop-view-white-singers-black-style-pop-bonanza.html|title=POP VIEW; White Singers + Black Style - Pop Bonanza|first=Peter|last=Watrous|date=March 11, 1990|website=Nytimes.com}}</ref> Fifteen-year-old [[Donnie Wahlberg]] immediately impressed Starr and Alford with his rapping skills, dancing ability and showmanship, becoming the group's first member. Wahlberg assisted in helping to recruit other members. Among them were his younger brother [[Mark Wahlberg|Mark]] and his best friends [[Danny Wood]] and Jamie Kelly. He also coaxed one-time schoolmate [[Jordan Knight]] - who sang an exceptional [[falsetto]] - into auditioning for Starr as well. Upon Knight's passing the audition, his older brother [[Jonathan Knight|Jonathan]] was accepted into the group as well.<ref name=heartthrobs>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20118457,00.html|title=The Heartthrobs of America |last=Dougherty|first=Steve |date=August 13, 1990|magazine=People|accessdate=September 23, 2008}}</ref>\n\nAs the group began to take shape, Mark Wahlberg left and was briefly replaced by Jamie Kelly. When a search was made to find a [[Michael Jackson]]-esque singer to fill the role, Starr replaced Jamie with 12-year-old [[Joey McIntyre]], whom the other members initially resented for being the one to replace their friend. With the final line-up in place, Starr rehearsed the boys diligently, after school and on weekends, and eventually secured the group, at this time named Nynuk,<ref>{{cite book|title=New Kids on the Block: Five Brothers and a Million Sisters: The Authorized Biography|author=Van Noy, Nikki|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|year=2012|chapter=What's a Nynuk)?}}</ref> a recording contract at [[Columbia Records]]. However, the label demanded Starr change the name of the group. Subsequently, they settled on New Kids on the Block, after a [[hip hop music|rap]] song that Donnie Wahlberg had written and arranged for their first album.<ref name=heartthrobs />\n\n===1986: ''New Kids on the Block'' (debut album)===\n{{Main article|New Kids on the Block (album)}}\nIn April 1986, Columbia Records released the group's self-titled debut album. The album, almost exclusively written and produced by Maurice Starr, featured mid 80s [[bubblegum pop]] material. The first single, \"[[Be My Girl (New Kids on the Block song)|Be My Girl]]\", received minor airplay around the group's native Boston, but failed to capture nationwide attention. The album's second single, \"[[Stop It Girl]]\", fared even worse. The New Kids went on tour around the New England states, singing wherever Starr could book them: in bars, school dances, and clubs. Nevertheless, Starr remained diligent and persuaded the label to allow the group to record a second album.\n\n===1988\u20131989: ''Hangin' Tough''===\n{{Main article|Hangin' Tough}}\nAfter the failure of the first album, Starr had the group back in the studio for most of 1987 and 1988 recording their second album. Dissatisfied with the excessively bubblegum sound of their first album, the group wanted to have more input on their look, direction and song material. As a result, Wahlberg, Wood and Jordan Knight received [[associate producer]] credit on the final product. The album's first single was \"[[Please Don't Go Girl]]\", a ballad released in the spring of 1988. Failure seemed destined a second time when the song became another that went unnoticed by the listening public, and Columbia Records made plans to drop the New Kids from the label. At the eleventh hour, however, a pop radio station in Florida began playing the song. Scoring listener approval, it soon became the most requested song on their play list. When Columbia caught wind of the positive response, they decided to keep the group on its roster and put more effort into promoting the single. Columbia decided to re-shoot a music video for \"Please Don't Go Girl\", hiring director [[Doug Nichol]], and sent the video to thousands of radio stations across the country to show the group's visual appeal. National attention soon followed and \"Please Don't Go Girl\" eventually climbed to No. 10 on [[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard's Hot 100 Singles Chart]]\u2014becoming the group's first hit.<ref name=\"billboard\">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=new kids on the block|chart=all}}|title=Artist Chart History \u2013 New Kids on the Block|publisher=billboard.com|accessdate=September 23, 2008}}</ref>\n\nNew Kids on the Block's second album, ''Hangin' Tough'', was released to modest fanfare in September. In the meantime, the group began making national televised appearances on such music programs as ''[[Showtime at the Apollo]]'', and ''[[Soul Train]]''. Producer Maurice Starr then held auditions to secure a band of musicians suitable for touring with the New Kids approving musical director and Keyboardist Greg McPherson, bassist [[David Dyson (musician)|David Dyson]], keyboardist Yasko Kubota, guitarist Nerida Rojas, and drummer Derrick Antunes. The New Kids later landed a spot as an opening act for fellow teen-pop act [[Tiffany (American singer)|Tiffany]] on the U.S. leg of her concert tour. Sales of ''Hangin' Tough'' steadily increased as the group's national attention slowly rose. At year's end, the album's second single \"[[You Got It (The Right Stuff)]]\" was released. The song was given a huge boost when [[MTV]] took notice of the group and began playing the video in regular rotation, including an appearance on [[Club MTV]]. By early 1989, it cracked the top five.<ref name=\"billboard\" /> The New Kids hit pay dirt with their next single, \"[[I'll Be Loving You (Forever)]]\", which reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart in June.<ref name=\"billboard\" /> The group had been scheduled to open for Tiffany once again on a [[Hangin' Tough Tour|second tour]], but their sudden popularity caused a reversal, and she wound up opening for them (although the two acts were technically billed as \"co-headliners\").\n\nMore top five singles from ''Hangin' Tough'' followed into the summer and fall, including [[Hangin' Tough (song)|the title track]] and \"[[Cover Girl (New Kids on the Block song)|Cover Girl]]\". Columbia Records also released the single \"[[Didn't I (Blow Your Mind This Time)]]\" (a cover of [[The Delfonics]]' classic hit), from the group's previously overlooked debut album. The song went No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles<ref name=\"billboard\" /> on the strength of the group's popularity and effectively jump-started the sales of that album as well. By the end of 1989, ''Hangin' Tough'' had climbed to number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] Albums Chart and had gone eight-times [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]]. They, subsequently, became the first 'teen' act to garner five top ten hits from a single album.\n\nMeanwhile, a top ten charting [[Christmas and holiday season|holiday]] album, ''[[Merry, Merry Christmas]]'', was released in the fall\u2014spawning another top 10 hit, \"[[This One's for the Children]]\" and going double platinum in the U.S. The proceeds were donated to [[United Cerebral Palsy]], the New Kids' favorite charitable cause. ''Hangin' Tough'' would go on to spend 132 weeks on the chart, and in January 1990, the album won two [[American Music Awards of 1990|American Music Awards]] for \"Best Pop/Rock Album\", and \"Best Pop/Rock Group\". With the success of \"Didn't I (Blow Your Mind)\", \"Cover Girl\", and \"This One's For the Children\", the group pulled off a rare feat of having three singles on the Billboard Hot 100 at the same time, but each from a different album.\n\nColumbia Music Video also released a home video \"Hangin' Tough\", a documentary on the band directed by [[Doug Nichol]] and produced by Bryan Johnson, that included their four hit music videos and a live concert recorded during their 1989 tour. It achieved massive sales, earning a [[Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video]] nomination,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/grammy/videos.htm |title=Grammy Awards: Best Music Videos |publisher=Rock On The Net |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}</ref> and was one of the biggest selling music videos of all time.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/22/business/the-media-business-new-products-help-to-bolster-music-sales.html?pagewanted=1 | work=The New York Times | title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; New Products Help to Bolster Music Sales | first=Geraldine | last=Fabrikant | date=October 22, 1990 | accessdate=May 20, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Commonwealth of Massachusetts declared April 24, 1989, \"New Kids on the Block Day\".\n\n===1990\u20131993: ''Step by Step'' and lip syncing allegations===\n{{Main article|Step by Step (New Kids on the Block album)}}\nBy early 1990, New Kids on the Block had become one of the most popular acts in the United States. The following May, they followed up ''Hangin' Tough'' with ''Step by Step'', which featured slightly more than half of the songs co-written and produced by the members themselves. The first single, [[Step by Step (New Kids on the Block song)|the title track]], raced to number one on the Hot 100 Singles Chart<ref name=\"billboard\" /> and became their biggest selling single. It was followed up with the top ten \"[[Tonight (New Kids on the Block song)|Tonight]]\", which extended the consecutive top ten singles chart run to nine records. \"Let's Try It Again\" hit No. 8 on the UK Singles Chart, whilst \"Baby I Believe In You\" went No. 1 on the Japanese Chart, further signifying the international appeal of the group. The album was eventually certified triple platinum, selling close to 20 million copies worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=new kids on the block|bio=true}}|title=Artist Biography \u2013 New Kids on the Block|last= Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|author2=Leahey, Andrew |publisher=billboard.com|accessdate=September 23, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe group performed an estimated two hundred concerts a year, with an extravagant worldwide concert tour that summer, called ''[[The Magic Summer Tour]]'', sponsored by [[Coca-Cola|Coke]]. The tour ultimately grossed $74 million ($133 million, adjusted for inflation), making the group the top-grossing touring act in the country at the time and one of highest-grossing concert tours of the decade. The tour had an overall attendance of 3.2 million people. Their 1990 [[Pay-per-view|pay-per-view special]] broke cable-TV history at the time. During this time, the group became heavily merchandised. NKOTB-licensed merchandise included [[lunch box]]es, [[Badge|buttons]], T-shirts, [[comic books]], [[Celebrity doll|dolls]], trading cards and even a [[Saturday morning cartoon]] in their likeness, which was developed by the writing and development team from [[Pangea Corporation]] and animated by [[DIC Entertainment]].

In early 1992, the group released the stand-alone single \"[[If You Go Away (New Kids on the Block song)|If You Go Away]]\", the only new track on the compilation ''[[H.I.T.S.]]''. The song peaked at No. 16 on the US charts and No. 9 in the UK charts. Meanwhile, as the music industry was still reeling from the [[Milli Vanilli]] [[Lip sync|lip-syncing]] scandal, the group found themselves accused of lip-syncing by Gregory McPherson, also a music teacher at [[Berklee College of Music]], who was listed as an associate producer and string arranger on the group's third album, ''Step by Step''. McPherson alleged that Maurice Starr sang the vocals while the group lip-synced to pre-recorded vocals during their live performances. McPherson also filed a [[breach of contract]] and creative infringement lawsuit against Starr.\n\nThe group immediately responded to the allegations and interrupted the Australian leg of their tour to fly to Los Angeles to perform live on ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]].''<ref>{{cite news|title= New Kids on the Block Let Singing Do the Talking|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=February 6, 1992|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1992-02-06/local/me-2060_1_arsenio-hall-show|accessdate=October 9, 2010 | first=Steve | last=Hochman}}</ref> After performing a medley of their previous hits and their new single, the group (along with Starr) was interviewed by Hall.
