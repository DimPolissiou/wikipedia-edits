There also were seven institutes for higher Islamic teaching. \n\nAccording to recent official estimates, 11 percent of the population is Russian Orthodox, although some experts believe the figure could be as low as 8 percent. The country has 44 Russian Orthodox churches, 1 Russian Orthodox [[monastery]] for women, and 1 [[parochial school]].\n[[File:Russian Orthodox cathedral in Bishkek.jpg|thumb|[[Russian Orthodox]] cathedral in [[Bishkek]]]]\nOther religious groups account for a very small percentage of the population. The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] operates 30 churches throughout the country. The [[Roman Catholics]] hold services in three churches, located in [[Jalal-Abad|Jalalabad]], [[Talas, Kyrgyzstan|Talas]], and [[Bishkek]]. The small [[Jewish community]] operates one [[synagogue]] in Bishkek, and it organizes internal cultural studies and humanitarian services, chiefly food assistance for the elderly and persons with disabilities regardless of faith. One [[Buddhist temple]] serves the small Buddhist community. There are 12 registered [[Baha'i]] houses of worship. In addition, there are 240 registered [[Protestant]] houses of worship. The Church of Jesus Christ is the country's largest Protestant church with approximately 10 affiliates and an estimated 11 thousand members, of whom approximately 40 percent are ethnic Kyrgyz. Other Protestant congregations include [[Baptist]]s, [[Pentecostal]]s, [[Lutheran]]s, nondenominational Protestants, [[Presbyterian]]s, and [[Charismatics]]. There also are syncretistic religious practices. There is no official estimate of the number of [[atheists]].\n\nIslam is practiced widely throughout the country in both urban and rural areas. Russian Orthodoxy typically is concentrated in cities with a larger ethnic Russian population. Other religious groups more commonly practice in the cities where their smaller communities tend to be concentrated. There is a correlation between ethnicity and religion; primarily Muslim ethnic groups are [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] (67% of the whole population); [[Uzbeks]] (14.2%) ; [[Dungans]] (ethnic [[Chinese Muslims]]) (1.1%) and [[Uighurs]] (ethnic [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Muslim]]s) (1%). Ethnic Russians usually belong to either the Russian Orthodox Church or one of the Protestant denominations. However, some Christian pastors noted that the number of ethnic Kyrgyz converts to Christianity grew significantly during the year covered by this report. Religious practice in the south of the country is more traditional and devout than in the north part.\n\n[[Missionary]] groups operate freely in the country. SARA has registered missionaries from all over the world representing an estimated 20 religious groups and denominations. According to SARA, since 1996 it has registered 1,133 missionaries, of whom 263 were Muslim and the rest represented other, mostly Christian, religious groups. During the period covered by this report, there were 111 registered missionaries, of whom 80 were Christian and 31 were Muslim. Missionaries disseminating [[dogma]] inconsistent with the traditional customs of local Muslims are subject to expulsion. According to SARA, of the approximately 20 missionaries expelled since 1991, all represented various \"totalitarian sects,\" groups the SCRA considered incompatible with the standard principles of traditional world religious groups.\n\n==Status of religious freedom==\n\n===Legal and policy framework===\nThe Constitution and the law provide for freedom of religion; however, the Government restricted the activities of radical Islamic groups it considered to be threats to security. The Constitution provides for the separation of religion and state. The new Constitution, adopted on December 30, 2006, defines the country as a sovereign, unitary, democratic social state based on the rule of law; the previous Constitution had also defined the country as \"secular.\" A May 6, 2006 decree recognized Islam and Russian Orthodoxy as \"traditional religious groups.\"\n\nArticle 5 of the \"Law On Religious Freedom and Religious Organizations\" affirms that \"the State does not interfere with the activity of religious organizations that adhere to established laws; does not allow for establishing advantages or restrictions of one religion over another; does not finance the activity of religious organizations and activity of propagating atheism.\"\n\nArticle 8 of the Constitution prohibits the formation of political parties on religious and ethnic grounds, as well as activities of religious organizations that jeopardize the state, constitutional system, or national security. Article 85 of the Constitution provides the Constitutional Court with the authority to determine the constitutionality of a religious organization's activities.\n\nThe Government recognizes two Muslim holy days (Kurman Ait or [[Eid al-Adha]], and Orozo Ait or [[Eid al-Fitr]]) and one Russian Orthodox holy day ([[Orthodox Christmas]]) as national holidays. The President and the Government send greetings to Muslims and Orthodox adherents on their major holy days, and the greetings are printed in the mass media.\n\nEstablished in 1993, the [[Muftiate]] (or Spiritual Administration of Muslims of Kyrgyzstan-SAMK) is the highest Islamic managing body in the country. The Muftiate oversees all Islamic entities, including institutes and [[madrassahs]], mosques, and Islamic organizations. The Mufti is the official head of the Muftiate and is elected by the Council of Ulemas, which consists of 30 Islamic clerics and scholars. A Muftiate-established commission reviews and standardizes Islamic educational literature printed and distributed in the country and reviews new books on Islamic themes prior to publication. The Muftiate has the authority to ban publications that do not meet the established standards, an initiative it started and the Government supports.\n\nSARA is responsible under the law for promoting religious tolerance, protecting freedom of conscience, and overseeing the application of laws on religion. The [[President of Kyrgyzstan|President]] appoints the Director, and the [[Prime Minister of Kyrgyzstan|Prime Minister]] appoints the deputies of the agency. In June 2006 SARA moved its offices to the city of Osh in the south to be closer to the more religious part of the country.\n\nA 1997 presidential decree requires the registration of all religious organizations with the Ministry of Justice (MOJ), following approval from SARA. SARA can deny or postpone the certification of a particular religious group if SARA believes the proposed activities of that group are not religious in character. Unregistered religious organizations are prohibited from actions such as renting space and holding religious services, although many hold regular services without government interference.\n\nOrganizations applying for registration must have at least 10 members who are adult citizens and must submit an application form, organizational charter, minutes of an institutional meeting, and a list of founding members to SARA for review. SARA then provides a recommendation to the MOJ for approval or rejection of the registration application. Recommendation for rejection occurs when a religious organization does not comply with the law or is a threat to national security, social stability, interethnic and interdenominational harmony, public order, health, or morality. An applicant whose registration is denied may reapply and may appeal to the courts. The registration process with SARA is often cumbersome, taking a month to several years for completion. Each congregation must register separately.\n\nIf approved, a religious organization then must complete the registration process with the MOJ to obtain status as a legal entity, which is necessary to own property, open bank accounts, and otherwise engage in contractual activities. If a religious organization engages in commercial activity, it is required to pay taxes. In practice the MOJ has never registered a religious organization without prior approval by SARA. SARA reported that its staff continued to travel around the country to help unregistered religious entities prepare applications for registration.\n\nAccording to SARA, there were 2,113 registered religious entities, including mosques, churches, foundations, [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) of a religious nature, and religious educational institutions. SARA identified 1,742 Islamic entities, 46 entities of the Russian Orthodox Church, and 304 other \"nontraditional\" houses of worship, including 2 Russian churches of \"Old Belief,\" 3 Catholic churches, 1 synagogue, 1 Buddhist temple, and 297 Protestant churches (48 Baptist, 21 Lutheran, 49 Pentecostal, 30 Adventist, 35 Presbyterian, 43 \"Charismatic,\" 49 [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and 22 \"other\" Protestant churches). According to SARA, there are 21 \"other religious entities\" including 12 Baha'i centers, 21 religious centers of \"other foreign confessions,\" 13 religious schools, and 7 religious foundations and unions.\n\nMembers of registered religious groups may fulfill alternative military service; it was reported in the press in 2005 that approximately three thousand persons apply annually.\n\nMissionaries of various religious groups operate freely, although they are required to register. Since 1996 SARA has registered more than 1,133 foreign citizens as religious missionaries. All religious entities founded by a foreigner must re-register each year with SARA, although the process is much less cumbersome than the initial registration. Missionaries are only required to register with SARA once.\n\nThe 1997 Law on Religious Freedom and Religious Organizations forbids the teaching of religion (or atheism) in public schools. In 2001 the Government instructed the SCRA to draw up programs for training clergy and to prepare methodologies for teaching about religious groups in public schools. These instructions came in response to concerns about the spread of [[Wahhabism]] and what the Government considered unconventional religious sects. The SCRA turned to a number of religious organizations for their ideas on introducing religious education; their reaction generally was negative, as they preferred to retain responsibility for the religious education of their adherents. SARA indicated that it was still developing a curriculum to teach about religious groups, in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and several academic institutions. An August 9, 2006 press report indicated that the Government planned to introduce religious education into the secondary school curriculum; however, there had been no implementation of this plan by the end of the reporting period. Under the auspices of the Muftiate, volunteers called Davatchi visited villages in the south to teach traditional Islamic values.\n\nThe Islamic University oversees all Islamic schools, including madrassahs, to develop a standardized curriculum and curb the spread of extremist religious teaching. This program continued during the reporting period.\n\nSince 2001 the Government has worked with representatives of various religious groups and NGOs on a draft law \"On Freedom of Conscience and Religious Organizations,\" ostensibly in response to concerns about terrorism and other illegal activities committed by groups disguised as religious organizations. In May 2006, a group of parliamentary deputies proposed a different draft bill. Work on the new draft bill continued at the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe August 2005 law on \"Countering Extremist Activity\" seeks to \"halt extremist activities by religious organizations or groups.\" Law enforcement officials have acted under this law to detain members of banned organizations, such as Hizb-ut Tahrir (HT), for distributing leaflets and other materials deemed to be of an extremist nature.\n\n===Restrictions on religious freedom===\nThe Government continued to express concern publicly about groups that it viewed as extremist because of either radical religious or political agendas. The Government was particularly concerned about the threat of political Islam, whose followers (Islamists) it labels \"Wahhabists.\" The Government perceives radical Islamists to be a threat to national stability, particularly in the south, and fears that they seek to overthrow the government and establish an Islamic theocracy. Armed incursions in 1999 and 2000 by members of the [[Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan]] (IMU), a [[terrorist organization]], and more recent incursions by unidentified terrorists in May 2006 increased the Government's concern regarding political Islam and the actions of militant Islamic groups.\n\nIn 2003 the Supreme Court sustained the ban on four political organizations, imposed because of extremism and alleged ties to international terrorist organizations: [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] (HT), the [[Islamic Party of Turkestan]], the Organization for Freeing Eastern Turkestan, and the [[Eastern Turkestan Islamic Party]].\n\nSeveral religious groups had difficulties registering. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons), which initially applied for registration with SARA in August 2004, was still not registered at the end of the reporting period. Leaders of the Hare Krishna temple in Bishkek, after attempting unsuccessfully to register several times in the last 2 years, planned to resubmit the application for registration once the location of their new temple was confirmed.\n\nAccording to the Union of Baptist Churches of Kyrgyzstan, several churches in [[Tash-Kumyr]], [[At-Bashi]], Osh, and Jalalabad continue to wait for registration, despite numerous meetings with SARA officials and submissions of applications. Church leaders attributed previous delays to the submission of improper documentation and information during the application process. On December 1, 2006, SARA refused registration of the [[Baptist]] Church in [[Kara-Kulja]], citing the local population's petition to SARA to prevent the church from staying open (see section 3).\n\nAccording to church officials, the local community and government officials attempted to pressure Dzhanybek Zhakipov, the pastor of the [[Pentecostal]] Church of Jesus Christ in Jalalabad, to close down his church in July 2006. Local law enforcement officials reportedly \"tormented\" the pastor after receiving complaints by relatives of Christian converts who belonged to his church. SARA officials showed the pastor a petition with 500 signatures requesting that the church be shut down. After court proceedings, a Jalalabad judge ordered SARA to register the church. The church continued to operate, and there were no reports of further pressure.\n\nThe [[Unification Church]] remained active, despite the SCRA suspension of its activities in 2003 for registration irregularities, a ruling upheld in an appeal to the Bishkek City Court.\n\nAlthough the Government monitored, including by filming, Protestant and Muslim religious groups in the past, there were no reports of surveillance during the period covered by this report. There were unconfirmed reports that law enforcement officials monitored the activities of missionaries.\n\nA Baptist pastor reported several cases of their foreign missionaries being denied [[visa (document)|visa]]s or facing visa delays when attempting to visit the country. No missionaries were expelled, asked to leave the country, or denied registration during the reporting period.\n\nOn February 21, 2007, news agency Ferghana.ru reported that school administrators and teachers at the Kyzyljar School of the Jalalabad Oblast prohibited two female students from attending class because the students refused to remove their [[hijab]]s. A similar incident occurred in a neighboring village. Parents at both schools protested the prohibition of hijabs but the dispute continued as of the end of the reporting period. In December 2005 the Jalalabad city education department banned the wearing of hijabs in that city's schools. Several parents protested the move and demanded that the ban be lifted. SARA's stated position was that students, who for religious reasons choose to wear clothing that would indicate adherence to a particular religion, may attend religious schools.\n\nAccording to news agency RFE/RL, Mutakalim, a Muslim women's NGO, requested a change in the legislation that bans females from wearing Islamic headscarves in official passport photos. The Government defended the current law as being a national security measure and rejected a petition from the group for lacking a sufficient number of signatures.\n\nOn March 10, 2007, State National Safety Committee (GKNB) officers in Jalalabad seized a warehouse containing Bibles owned by a Baptist church. The authorities told church administrators that the seizure was for the purpose of \"expert examination.\" The GKNB refused to release the warehouse as of the end of the reporting period.\n\n===Abuses of religious freedom===\nOn August 6, 2006, the special forces of the National Security Service (SNB) shot and killed three persons, including Mukhammadrafiq Kamalov, imam of the largest mosque in [[Kara-Suu]]. Immediately following the incident, government officials stated that the three were affiliated with the banned Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) and were killed in the course of an antiterrorism operation. Kamalov's family and observers, including the [[ombudsman]] for human rights, denied security officials' allegations about the possible involvement of the imam in religious extremist groups. Security officials later conceded that Kamalov might not have been part of the group but instead may have been kidnapped by the suspected terrorists and thus killed accidentally in the raid. On May 24, 2006, security forces had detained Kamalov and searched his house on suspicion of his involvement in HT activities.\n\nOn several occasions during the period covered by this report, police arrested or fined members of the Islamic political organization HT for distributing leaflets. On February 21, 2007, local media reported that police detained a resident of Osh after discovering HT booklets and a hand grenade in his home. As of the end of the reporting period, the investigation continued.\n\nOf the 12 men arrested in April 2006 for alleged links to a November 2004 grenade incident blamed on Islamic extremists, 4 remained in custody. It was unclear whether their detention was linked to their religious beliefs or practice.\n\nThere were no reports of religious prisoners or detainees in the country.\n\n===Forced religious conversion===\nThere were no reports of [[forced conversion|forced religious conversion]], including of minor U.S. citizens who had been abducted or illegally removed from the United States, or of the refusal to allow such citizens to be returned to the [[United States]].\n\n===Improvements and Positive Developments in Respect for Religious Freedom===\nIn 2006 the Church of Jesus Christ signed a 49-year lease for land upon which its church is located after resolving favorably an ongoing dispute with the Bishkek mayor's office.\n\n==Societal abuses and discrimination==\nThere was no evidence of widespread societal discrimination or violence against members of different religious groups; however, there was evidence of periodic tension in rural areas between conservative Muslims and foreign Christian missionaries and individuals from traditionally Muslim ethnic groups who had converted to other religious groups. There were several reports that tensions between Muslims and Muslim converts continued. Both Muslim and Russian Orthodox spiritual leaders criticized the proselytizing activities of nontraditional Christian groups.\n\nSeveral media outlets reported incidents of aggression against Baptist Pastor Zulumbek Sarygulov in Osh Oblast. According to Forum 18, the first incident occurred on July 28, 2006 when a crowd of 80 local Muslims broke into the Karakulja village Baptist Church in the Osh Oblast. The mob physically abused the pastor and burned his Bibles and other religious materials. Church leaders reported that local police on the scene made no efforts to stop the attack. Soon after the event, local police opened a criminal investigation, questioning Sarygulov and others for detailed accounts of the incident. After the initial inquiries, there were no further reports from the local authorities regarding developments in the investigation.\n\nIn a second incident on November 12, 2006, perpetrators threw [[Molotov cocktail]]s at Sarygulov's church facilities, but church staff quickly extinguished the flames, and the fire caused little damage. Local authorities investigated the event but made no arrests. The investigation continued as of the end of the reporting period.\n\nOn December 1, 2006, according to Forum 18, SARA notified Aleksandr Nikitin, pastor of the Baptist church in Osh and regional coordinator for Baptist churches in the south, that the Karakulja church had been officially denied registration on the grounds that it operated for several years without having official registration. On March 5, 2007, a law enforcement official showed Forum 18 reporters a letter from SARA requesting that the police end the Karakulja Baptist church activities. The authorities took no further action as of the end of the reporting period.\n\nOn February 15, 2007, independently operated Channel 5 TV broadcast a program that portrayed the Church of Jesus Christ as being possibly associated with [[devil worship]]ers. The pastor provided a rebuttal to the program, but producers never aired it. Channel 5 producers aired opinions in support of the program's message presented by representatives of the \"traditional religious groups\" (Islam and Russian Orthodoxy).\n\nSeveral Protestant pastors complained of difficulties interring deceased parishioners who converted from Islam to Christianity. Local Islamic and community leaders opposed the burial of converts in Islamic cemeteries. Officially, the cemetery plots are under government control, but usually local Islamic figures oversee them. The Government resolved the problem by allotting new plots of land for Protestant cemeteries. However, the scarcity of such cemeteries forces Christians to travel great distances to bury their deceased.\n\nThere were no acts of violence, harassment, or vandalism reported against Jews, community institutions, schools, synagogues, or cemeteries during the reporting period.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Human rights in Kyrgyzstan]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{commons category|Religion in Kyrgyzstan}}\n* United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor.

The Muftiate has the authority to ban publications that do not meet the established standards, an initiative it started and the Government supports.\n\nSARA is responsible under the law for promoting religious tolerance, protecting freedom of conscience, and overseeing the application of laws on religion. The [[President of Kyrgyzstan|President]] appoints the Director, and the [[Prime Minister of Kyrgyzstan|Prime Minister]] appoints the deputies of the agency. In June 2006 SARA moved its offices to the city of Osh in the south to be closer to the more religious part of the country.\n\nA 1997 presidential decree requires the registration of all religious organizations with the Ministry of Justice (MOJ), following approval from SARA. SARA can deny or postpone the certification of a particular religious group if SARA believes the proposed activities of that group are not religious in character. Unregistered religious organizations are prohibited from actions such as renting space and holding religious services, although many hold regular services without government interference.\n\nOrganizations applying for registration must have at least 10 members who are adult citizens and must submit an application form, organizational charter, minutes of an institutional meeting, and a list of founding members to SARA for review. SARA then provides a recommendation to the MOJ for approval or rejection of the registration application. Recommendation for rejection occurs when a religious organization does not comply with the law or is a threat to national security, social stability, interethnic and interdenominational harmony, public order, health, or morality. An applicant whose registration is denied may reapply and may appeal to the courts. The registration process with SARA is often cumbersome, taking a month to several years for completion. Each congregation must register separately.\n\nIf approved, a religious organization then must complete the registration process with the MOJ to obtain status as a legal entity, which is necessary to own property, open bank accounts, and otherwise engage in contractual activities. If a religious organization engages in commercial activity, it is required to pay taxes. In practice the MOJ has never registered a religious organization without prior approval by SARA. SARA reported that its staff continued to travel around the country to help unregistered religious entities prepare applications for registration.\n\nAccording to SARA, there were 2,113 registered religious entities, including mosques, churches, foundations, [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) of a religious nature, and religious educational institutions. SARA identified 1,742 Islamic entities, 46 entities of the Russian Orthodox Church, and 304 other \"nontraditional\" houses of worship, including 2 Russian churches of \"Old Belief,\" 3 Catholic churches, 1 synagogue, 1 Buddhist temple, and 297 Protestant churches (48 Baptist, 21 Lutheran, 49 Pentecostal, 30 Adventist, 35 Presbyterian, 43 \"Charismatic,\" 49 [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and 22 \"other\" Protestant churches). According to SARA, there are 21 \"other religious entities\" including 12 Baha'i centers, 21 religious centers of \"other foreign confessions,\" 13 religious schools, and 7 religious foundations and unions.\n\nMembers of registered religious groups may fulfill alternative military service; it was reported in the press in 2005 that approximately three thousand persons apply annually.\n\nMissionaries of various religious groups operate freely, although they are required to register. Since 1996 SARA has registered more than 1,133 foreign citizens as religious missionaries. All religious entities founded by a foreigner must re-register each year with SARA, although the process is much less cumbersome than the initial registration. Missionaries are only required to register with SARA once.\n\nThe 1997 Law on Religious Freedom and Religious Organizations forbids the teaching of religion (or atheism) in public schools. In 2001 the Government instructed the SCRA to draw up programs for training clergy and to prepare methodologies for teaching about religious groups in public schools. These instructions came in response to concerns about the spread of [[Wahhabism]] and what the Government considered unconventional religious sects. The SCRA turned to a number of religious organizations for their ideas on introducing religious education; their reaction generally was negative, as they preferred to retain responsibility for the religious education of their adherents. SARA indicated that it was still developing a curriculum to teach about religious groups, in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and several academic institutions. An August 9, 2006 press report indicated that the Government planned to introduce religious education into the secondary school curriculum; however, there had been no implementation of this plan by the end of the reporting period. Under the auspices of the Muftiate, volunteers called Davatchi visited villages in the south to teach traditional Islamic values.\n\nThe Islamic University oversees all Islamic schools, including madrassahs, to develop a standardized curriculum and curb the spread of extremist religious teaching. This program continued during the reporting period.\n\nSince 2001 the Government has worked with representatives of various religious groups and NGOs on a draft law \"On Freedom of Conscience and Religious Organizations,\" ostensibly in response to concerns about terrorism and other illegal activities committed by groups disguised as religious organizations. In May 2006, a group of parliamentary deputies proposed a different draft bill. Work on the new draft bill continued at the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe August 2005 law on \"Countering Extremist Activity\" seeks to \"halt extremist activities by religious organizations or groups.\" Law enforcement officials have acted under this law to detain members of banned organizations, such as Hizb-ut Tahrir (HT), for distributing leaflets and other materials deemed to be of an extremist nature.\n\n===Restrictions on religious freedom===\nThe Government continued to express concern publicly about groups that it viewed as extremist because of either radical religious or political agendas. The Government was particularly concerned about the threat of political Islam, whose followers (Islamists) it labels \"Wahhabists.\" The Government perceives radical Islamists to be a threat to national stability, particularly in the south, and fears that they seek to overthrow the government and establish an Islamic theocracy. Armed incursions in 1999 and 2000 by members of the [[Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan]] (IMU), a [[terrorist organization]], and more recent incursions by unidentified terrorists in May 2006 increased the Government's concern regarding political Islam and the actions of militant Islamic groups.\n\nIn 2003 the Supreme Court sustained the ban on four political organizations, imposed because of extremism and alleged ties to international terrorist organizations: [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] (HT), the [[Islamic Party of Turkestan]], the Organization for Freeing Eastern Turkestan, and the [[Eastern Turkestan Islamic Party]].\n\nSeveral religious groups had difficulties registering. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons), which initially applied for registration with SARA in August 2004, was still not registered at the end of the reporting period. Leaders of the Hare Krishna temple in Bishkek, after attempting unsuccessfully to register several times in the last 2 years, planned to resubmit the application for registration once the location of their new temple was confirmed.\n\nAccording to the Union of Baptist Churches of Kyrgyzstan, several churches in [[Tash-Kumyr]], [[At-Bashi]], Osh, and Jalalabad continue to wait for registration, despite numerous meetings with SARA officials and submissions of applications. Church leaders attributed previous delays to the submission of improper documentation and information during the application process. On December 1, 2006, SARA refused registration of the [[Baptist]] Church in [[Kara-Kulja]], citing the local population's petition to SARA to prevent the church from staying open (see section 3).\n\nAccording to church officials, the local community and government officials attempted to pressure Dzhanybek Zhakipov, the pastor of the [[Pentecostal]] Church of Jesus Christ in Jalalabad, to close down his church in July 2006. Local law enforcement officials reportedly \"tormented\" the pastor after receiving complaints by relatives of Christian converts who belonged to his church. SARA officials showed the pastor a petition with 500 signatures requesting that the church be shut down. After court proceedings, a Jalalabad judge ordered SARA to register the church. The church continued to operate, and there were no reports of further pressure.\n\nThe [[Unification Church]] remained active, despite the SCRA suspension of its activities in 2003 for registration irregularities, a ruling upheld in an appeal to the Bishkek City Court.\n\nAlthough the Government monitored, including by filming, Protestant and Muslim religious groups in the past, there were no reports of surveillance during the period covered by this report. There were unconfirmed reports that law enforcement officials monitored the activities of missionaries.\n\nA Baptist pastor reported several cases of their foreign missionaries being denied [[visa (document)|visa]]s or facing visa delays when attempting to visit the country. No missionaries were expelled, asked to leave the country, or denied registration during the reporting period.\n\nOn February 21, 2007, news agency Ferghana.ru reported that school administrators and teachers at the Kyzyljar School of the Jalalabad Oblast prohibited two female students from attending class because the students refused to remove their [[hijab]]s. A similar incident occurred in a neighboring village. Parents at both schools protested the prohibition of hijabs but the dispute continued as of the end of the reporting period. In December 2005 the Jalalabad city education department banned the wearing of hijabs in that city's schools. Several parents protested the move and demanded that the ban be lifted. SARA's stated position was that students, who for religious reasons choose to wear clothing that would indicate adherence to a particular religion, may attend religious schools.\n\nAccording to news agency RFE/RL, Mutakalim, a Muslim women's NGO, requested a change in the legislation that bans females from wearing Islamic headscarves in official passport photos. The Government defended the current law as being a national security measure and rejected a petition from the group for lacking a sufficient number of signatures.\n\nOn March 10, 2007, State National Safety Committee (GKNB) officers in Jalalabad seized a warehouse containing Bibles owned by a Baptist church. The authorities told church administrators that the seizure was for the purpose of \"expert examination.\" The GKNB refused to release the warehouse as of the end of the reporting period.\n\n===Abuses of religious freedom===\nOn August 6, 2006, the special forces of the National Security Service (SNB) shot and killed three persons, including Mukhammadrafiq Kamalov, imam of the largest mosque in [[Kara-Suu]]. Immediately following the incident, government officials stated that the three were affiliated with the banned Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) and were killed in the course of an antiterrorism operation. Kamalov's family and observers, including the [[ombudsman]] for human rights, denied security officials' allegations about the possible involvement of the imam in religious extremist groups. Security officials later conceded that Kamalov might not have been part of the group but instead may have been kidnapped by the suspected terrorists and thus killed accidentally in the raid. On May 24, 2006, security forces had detained Kamalov and searched his house on suspicion of his involvement in HT activities.\n\nOn several occasions during the period covered by this report, police arrested or fined members of the Islamic political organization HT for distributing leaflets. On February 21, 2007, local media reported that police detained a resident of Osh after discovering HT booklets and a hand grenade in his home. As of the end of the reporting period, the investigation continued.\n\nOf the 12 men arrested in April 2006 for alleged links to a November 2004 grenade incident blamed on Islamic extremists, 4 remained in custody. It was unclear whether their detention was linked to their religious beliefs or practice.\n\nThere were no reports of religious prisoners or detainees in the country.\n\n===Forced religious conversion===\nThere were no reports of [[forced conversion|forced religious conversion]], including of minor U.S. citizens who had been abducted or illegally removed from the United States, or of the refusal to allow such citizens to be returned to the [[United States]].\n\n===Improvements and Positive Developments in Respect for Religious Freedom===\nIn 2006 the Church of Jesus Christ signed a 49-year lease for land upon which its church is located after resolving favorably an ongoing dispute with the Bishkek mayor's office.\n\n==Societal abuses and discrimination==\nThere was no evidence of widespread societal discrimination or violence against members of different religious groups; however, there was evidence of periodic tension in rural areas between conservative Muslims and foreign Christian missionaries and individuals from traditionally Muslim ethnic groups who had converted to other religious groups. There were several reports that tensions between Muslims and Muslim converts continued. Both Muslim and Russian Orthodox spiritual leaders criticized the proselytizing activities of nontraditional Christian groups.\n\nSeveral media outlets reported incidents of aggression against Baptist Pastor Zulumbek Sarygulov in Osh Oblast. According to Forum 18, the first incident occurred on July 28, 2006 when a crowd of 80 local Muslims broke into the Karakulja village Baptist Church in the Osh Oblast. The mob physically abused the pastor and burned his Bibles and other religious materials. Church leaders reported that local police on the scene made no efforts to stop the attack. Soon after the event, local police opened a criminal investigation, questioning Sarygulov and others for detailed accounts of the incident. After the initial inquiries, there were no further reports from the local authorities regarding developments in the investigation.\n\nIn a second incident on November 12, 2006, perpetrators threw [[Molotov cocktail]]s at Sarygulov's church facilities, but church staff quickly extinguished the flames, and the fire caused little damage. Local authorities investigated the event but made no arrests. The investigation continued as of the end of the reporting period.\n\nOn December 1, 2006, according to Forum 18, SARA notified Aleksandr Nikitin, pastor of the Baptist church in Osh and regional coordinator for Baptist churches in the south, that the Karakulja church had been officially denied registration on the grounds that it operated for several years without having official registration. On March 5, 2007, a law enforcement official showed Forum 18 reporters a letter from SARA requesting that the police end the Karakulja Baptist church activities. The authorities took no further action as of the end of the reporting period.\n\nOn February 15, 2007, independently operated Channel 5 TV broadcast a program that portrayed the Church of Jesus Christ as being possibly associated with [[devil worship]]ers. The pastor provided a rebuttal to the program, but producers never aired it. Channel 5 producers aired opinions in support of the program's message presented by representatives of the \"traditional religious groups\" (Islam and Russian Orthodoxy).\n\nSeveral Protestant pastors complained of difficulties interring deceased parishioners who converted from Islam to Christianity. Local Islamic and community leaders opposed the burial of converts in Islamic cemeteries. Officially, the cemetery plots are under government control, but usually local Islamic figures oversee them. The Government resolved the problem by allotting new plots of land for Protestant cemeteries. However, the scarcity of such cemeteries forces Christians to travel great distances to bury their deceased.\n\nThere were no acts of violence, harassment, or vandalism reported against Jews, community institutions, schools, synagogues, or cemeteries during the reporting period.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Human rights in Kyrgyzstan]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{commons category|Religion in Kyrgyzstan}}\n* United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor.

The drawing, which is in ink on paper, depicts a man in two superimposed positions with his arms and legs apart and inscribed in a circle and square. It is kept in the ''Gabinetto dei disegni e delle stampe'' of the [[Gallerie dell'Accademia]], in [[Venice]], [[Italy]], under reference 228. Like most works on paper, it is displayed to the public only occasionally, so it is not part of the normal exhibition of the museum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://leonardodavinci.stanford.edu/submissions/clabaugh/history/leonardo.html |title=The Vitruvian man |publisher=Leonardodavinci.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://witcombe.sbc.edu/davincicode/leonardo-vitruvian-man.html |title=Da Vinci's Code |publisher=Witcombe.sbc.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-20}}</ref> The work was recently on display at the [[Louvre]]'s exhibit of Da Vinci's work, from 24 October  2019 to 24 February  2020 as part of an agreement between [[France]] and [[Italy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://aleteia.org/2019/12/01/louvre-exhibit-has-most-da-vinci-paintings-ever-assembled/ |title=Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s Unexamined Life as a Painter |date=1 December 2019 |publisher=Aleteia |access-date=1 December 2019 |quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/12/leonardo-da-vinci-louvre-museum-his-life-painter/602800/ |title=Louvre exhibit has most da Vinci paintings ever assembled |date=1 December 2019 |publisher=The Atlantic|access-date=1 December 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nThe drawing represents ideal human [[body proportions]]. Its inscription in a square and a circle comes from a description by the ancient Roman architect Vitruvius in Book III of his treatise ''[[De architectura]]''. Yet, as it has been demonstrated, Leonardo did not represent Vitruvius's proportions of the limbs but rather included those he found himself after measuring male models in Milan. While the drawing is named after Vitruvius, some scholars today question the appropriateness of such a title.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lugli|first=Emanuele|title=In cerca della perfezione: nuovi elementi per l&#39;Uomo vitruviano di Leonardo Da Vinci|url=https://www.academia.edu/40295085/In_cerca_della_perfezione_nuovi_elementi_per_lUomo_vitruviano_di_Leonardo_Da_Vinci|journal=Leonardo e Vitruvio: Oltre il cerchio e il quadrato, ed. by Francesca Borgo|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Subject and title==\nThis image demonstrates the blend of [[mathematics and art]] during the [[Renaissance]] and demonstrates Leonardo's deep understanding of [[body proportions|proportion]].

If we take the height of the face itself, the distance from the bottom of the chin to the under side of the nostrils is one third of it; the nose from the under side of the nostrils to a line between the eyebrows is the same; from there to the lowest roots of the hair is also a third, comprising the forehead. The length of the foot is one sixth of the height of the body; of the forearm, one fourth; and the breadth of the breast is also one fourth. The other members, too, have their own symmetrical proportions, and it was by employing them that the famous painters and sculptors of antiquity attained to great and endless renown.\n\nSimilarly, in the members of a temple there ought to be the greatest harmony in the symmetrical relations of the different parts to the general magnitude of the whole. Then again, in the human body the central point is naturally the navel. For if a man be placed flat on his back, with his hands and feet extended, and a pair of compasses centred at his navel, the fingers and toes of his two hands and feet will touch the circumference of a circle described therefrom. And just as the human body yields a circular outline, so too a square figure may be found from it. For if we measure the distance from the soles of the feet to the top of the head, and then apply that measure to the outstretched arms, the breadth will be found to be the same as the height, as in the case of plane surfaces which are perfectly square.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20239/20239-h/29239-h.htm#Page_72 |title=Ten Books on Architecture.

He also departs from Vitruvius by drawing the arms raised to a position in which the fingertips are level with the top of the head, rather than Vitruvius's much lower angle, in which the arms form lines passing through the navel.\n\nIt may be noticed by examining the drawing that the combination of arm and leg positions creates sixteen different poses. The pose with the arms straight out and the feet together is seen to be inscribed in the superimposed square. On the other hand, the spread-eagle pose is seen to be inscribed in the superimposed circle.\n\nLeonardo's collaboration with [[Luca Pacioli]], the author of ''[[Divina proportione]]'' (''Divine Proportion'')<ref>''Leonardo da Vinci's Polyhedra'', by [[George W.

Its inscription in a square and a circle comes from a description by the ancient Roman architect Vitruvius in Book III of his treatise ''[[De architectura]]''. Yet, as it has been demonstrated, Leonardo did not represent Vitruvius's proportions of the limbs but rather included those he found himself after measuring male models in Milan. While the drawing is named after Vitruvius, some scholars today question the appropriateness of such a title.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lugli|first=Emanuele|title=In cerca della perfezione: nuovi elementi per l&#39;Uomo vitruviano di Leonardo Da Vinci|url=https://www.academia.edu/40295085/In_cerca_della_perfezione_nuovi_elementi_per_lUomo_vitruviano_di_Leonardo_Da_Vinci|journal=Leonardo e Vitruvio: Oltre il cerchio e il quadrato, ed. by Francesca Borgo|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Subject and title==\nThis image demonstrates the blend of [[mathematics and art]] during the [[Renaissance]] and demonstrates Leonardo's deep understanding of [[body proportions|proportion]].

If we take the height of the face itself, the distance from the bottom of the chin to the under side of the nostrils is one third of it; the nose from the under side of the nostrils to a line between the eyebrows is the same; from there to the lowest roots of the hair is also a third, comprising the forehead. The length of the foot is one sixth of the height of the body; of the forearm, one fourth; and the breadth of the breast is also one fourth. The other members, too, have their own symmetrical proportions, and it was by employing them that the famous painters and sculptors of antiquity attained to great and endless renown.\n\nSimilarly, in the members of a temple there ought to be the greatest harmony in the symmetrical relations of the different parts to the general magnitude of the whole. Then again, in the human body the central point is naturally the navel. For if a man be placed flat on his back, with his hands and feet extended, and a pair of compasses centred at his navel, the fingers and toes of his two hands and feet will touch the circumference of a circle described therefrom. And just as the human body yields a circular outline, so too a square figure may be found from it. For if we measure the distance from the soles of the feet to the top of the head, and then apply that measure to the outstretched arms, the breadth will be found to be the same as the height, as in the case of plane surfaces which are perfectly square.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20239/20239-h/29239-h.htm#Page_72 |title=Ten Books on Architecture.

He also departs from Vitruvius by drawing the arms raised to a position in which the fingertips are level with the top of the head, rather than Vitruvius's much lower angle, in which the arms form lines passing through the navel.\n\nIt may be noticed by examining the drawing that the combination of arm and leg positions creates sixteen different poses. The pose with the arms straight out and the feet together is seen to be inscribed in the superimposed square. On the other hand, the spread-eagle pose is seen to be inscribed in the superimposed circle.\n\nLeonardo's collaboration with [[Luca Pacioli]], the author of ''[[Divina proportione]]'' (''Divine Proportion'')<ref>''Leonardo da Vinci's Polyhedra'', by [[George W.

Arnold told the friend that she had planned to walk through [[Central Park]] before returning home. That evening, when Arnold failed to return home for dinner, her family grew suspicious.\n\nFrancis Arnold was reluctant to garner publicity over his daughter's disappearance, and initially sought the help of [[private investigator]]s in locating her. After these attempts proved fruitless, the family filed a missing persons report with the New York City Police Department in January 1911.

Mary Francis offered to go with her daughter, but Dorothy declined the offer telling her mother she would call her if she found a suitable dress. She then left the family home at around 11 a.m.{{sfn|Raybin Emert|1992|pages=32\u201333}} According to the Arnold family, Dorothy had approximately $25\u201330 cash in her possession  (approximately ${{Inflation|US|25|1910}} to  ${{Inflation|US|30|1910}} today). Arnold walked from her home on 79th Street to the Park & Tilford store at the corner of [[Fifth Avenue]] and 27th Street. She charged a half pound box of chocolates to her account, placed the candy in her [[muff (handwarmer)|muff]] and then walked to nearby [[Brentano's]] bookstore.<ref name=churchhill/> While at Brentano's, Arnold purchased ''Engaged Girl Sketches'', a book of humorous essays by Emily Calvin Blake.{{sfn|Raybin Emert|1992|p=33}} The clerks who waited on Arnold in both stores later said that she was courteous and did not exhibit any unusual behavior.{{sfn|Katz|2010|p=47}} Outside the bookstore, Arnold ran into a female friend named Gladys King. King recalled that the two spoke briefly about Marjorie Arnold's upcoming debutante party and that Arnold seemed to be in good spirits. King then excused herself to meet her mother for lunch at the [[Waldorf-Astoria]].<ref name=churchhill/> King recalled that Arnold told her she was going to walk home through [[Central Park]].

They began calling Arnold's friends to find her whereabouts but no one had seen her. Shortly after midnight on December 13, Elsie Henry, one of Arnold's friends, phoned the Arnold family home to see if Dorothy had returned. Henry later said Arnold's mother Mary answered the telephone and told her that Dorothy had returned home. When Henry asked to speak to Arnold, Mary hesitated and told Henry that Dorothy had gone to bed with a headache.<ref name=churchhill/>\n\n===Investigation===\nFearing that their daughter's disappearance would draw unwanted media attention and could become socially embarrassing, the Arnold family did not report Dorothy's disappearance to the police for weeks. However, the morning following Arnold's disappearance, the family did contact John S.

He discovered that except for the outfit she was wearing, all of Arnold's clothes and other personal belongings were in her room. Keith also found personal letters with foreign postmarks in her desk, two folders for transatlantic steamliners on the desk, and burned papers in the fireplace. The burned papers were presumed to be the rejected manuscripts Arnold submitted to ''McClure's'' magazine. Over the following weeks, Keith visited jails, hospitals and morgues in New York City, [[Philadelphia]] and [[Boston]] but did not find any sign of Arnold. After Keith's search proved fruitless, he suggested that the Arnold family hire [[Pinkerton (detective agency)|Pinkerton]] detectives to investigate.<ref name=churchhill/>\n\nPinkerton investigators searched area hospitals and other places that Arnold was known to frequent but found no trace of her. They also questioned Arnold's friends and former college classmates about her whereabouts, but none had seen her. As John Keith had found literature for transatlantic steamliners in Arnold's room the day after she disappeared, Pinkerton investigators theorized that Arnold might have eloped with a man to Europe. The agents searched marriage records but none were found bearing Dorothy Arnold's name. Agents were then dispatched overseas to search steamliners arriving from New York. While several women matching Arnold's physical description were found, Dorothy Arnold was not.{{sfn|Katz|2010|p=47}}\n\nAfter Keith and the Pinkerton detectives could not find Arnold, they persuaded Francis Arnold to call the police. The police advised Francis Arnold to hold a press conference in order to get as much publicity as possible. Francis Arnold resisted the suggestion but eventually agreed.<ref name=churchhill/> On January 25, 1911, reporters gathered at Francis Arnold's New York City office where he informed them of his daughter's disappearance and offered a $1,000 reward (approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000|1910|r=-3}}}} today) for information leading to her whereabouts. During the press conference, reporters asked Francis Arnold if it were possible that his daughter was still alive and had simply run away with a man, as he did not allow his daughter to date. Francis Arnold vehemently denied this stating, \"I would have been glad to see her associate more with young men than she did, especially some young men of brains and position: one whose profession or business would keep him occupied. I don\u2019t approve of young men who have nothing to do.\"<ref name=churchhill/> Reporters soon discovered that Francis Arnold's comment was in reference to George Griscom Jr., a man Dorothy had met while attending Bryn Mawr and with whom she was romantically involved. Griscom Jr. (who preferred to be called \"Junior\") was a 42-year-old engineer who came from a wealthy [[Pennsylvania]] family with whom he still lived at the Kenmawr Hotel in Pittsburgh.<ref name=tuscaloosa/><ref name=gazette>{{cite news|title=Dorothy Arnold's Father Does Not Believe Story|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1126&dat=19140410&id=6AtRAAAAIBAJ&pg=3829,5000197|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|The Gazette Times]]|location=Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|page=2|date=April 10, 1914|via=Google News}} {{open access}}</ref> Reporters also discovered that, in September 1910, Arnold had lied to her parents and told them she was going to visit a former Bryn Mawr classmate in Boston. Instead, she spent a week in a hotel with Griscom Jr. Arnold's parents found out about the rendezvous after Arnold pawned $500 worth of jewels to finance their week-long stay. After returning home, Arnold's parents forbade her to continue the relationship with Griscom Jr. because they found him unsuitable. Despite her parents' disapproval, Arnold continued to correspond with Griscom Jr.<ref name=spokane/> The two saw each other for a final time in early November, shortly before Griscom Jr. left on a vacation with his parents.{{sfn|Katz|2010|p=48}}\n\nAfter Arnold's disappearance, George Griscom Jr. was found vacationing with his parents in [[Florence]], [[Italy]]. The Arnold family sent him a telegram on December 16 asking for information about Dorothy's disappearance. In a return telegram, Griscom Jr. denied any knowledge of Arnold's whereabouts and claimed to know nothing of her disappearance. In early January 1911, Arnold's mother Mary and her brother John travelled to Italy by ship to forcibly interrogate Griscom Jr. They met Griscom Jr. in his room at the Anglo-American Hotel on January 16. Griscom Jr. continued to maintain that he knew nothing of Arnold's disappearance.\nDuring the visit, Mary and John Arnold demanded that Griscom Jr. give them the letters that Arnold had sent him. John Arnold later claimed the letters contained nothing of importance and said that he later destroyed them. Upon his return to the United States in February 1911, Griscom Jr. told the press that he intended to marry Arnold once she was found and on the condition that her mother approve of the marriage. Mary Arnold later told reporters she would never approve of the union.{{sfn|Katz|2010|p=48}} That same month, ''The San Francisco Chronicle'' reported that hotel clerks at the hotel where Griscom Jr. was staying had seen a veiled woman they believed to be Dorothy Arnold.

These calls were investigated but proved to be false. The Arnold family also received two [[ransom note]]s from alleged kidnappers who demanded upwards of $5,000 for Arnold's return. The kidnapping claims proved to be hoaxes.\n\nIn early February 1911, Francis Arnold received a postcard signed \"Dorothy\" bearing a New York City postmark that read, \"I am safe.\" While the writing matched his daughter's, Francis Arnold said he believed that someone had copied Dorothy's handwriting from samples that were featured in the newspaper and that the postcard was nothing more than a cruel joke.{{sfn|Katz|2010|p=50}} Around the same time, a jeweler in [[San Francisco]], California claimed a woman he recognized as Arnold had him engrave a diamond wedding ring for her on January 7, with the inscription \"To A.J.A. from E.R.B., December 10, 1910.\"<ref>{{cite news|work=[[The Oregon Journal]]|location=Portland, Oregon|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/25255632/the_oregon_daily_journal/|title=Dorothy Arnold's Father Despairs|date=February 21, 1911|p=1|via=Newspapers.com}} {{open access}}</ref>\n\nShortly after this, the New York City police announced that they had decided to stop investigating Arnold's disappearance, saying they believed she was dead.

[...] We have no evidence that a crime has been committed and the case is now one of a missing person and nothing more.\"{{sfn|Katz|2010|p=51}} Police continued to investigate reports of sightings, but none led to Dorothy Arnold.{{sfn|Katz|2010|p=50}}\n\n===Rumors and theories===\nNumerous theories and rumors regarding Arnold's disappearance continued to arise. One theory was that Arnold had slipped on an icy sidewalk, struck her head and was in a hospital with total [[amnesia]]. This theory did not pan out as there were no women matching her description in area hospitals who had sustained a concussion. Other theories arose that Arnold had been drugged and abducted, but that theory was considered unlikely as Arnold was last seen on a busy street in mid-afternoon. George Griscom Jr. theorized that Arnold had committed suicide because she was despondent over her failed writing career.<ref name=\"spokane\" /> After her second short story was rejected, Arnold wrote a letter to Griscom Jr. expressing her disappointment over her failed writing career and alluded to suicide stating, \"Well, it has come back. ''McClure's'' has turned me down. Failure stares me in the face. All I can see ahead is a long road with no turning. Mother will always think an accident has happened.\"<ref name=\"tuscaloosa\" /> Some of Arnold's family members and friends also said they believed that Arnold had committed suicide, but felt she killed herself because her relationship with Griscom Jr. was faltering. The ''[[New York World]]'' also supported this reasoning after they discovered that Andrew Griscom, a cousin of Griscom Jr., had jumped to his death from an [[ocean liner]] after he had been forbidden to marry an English governess.<ref name=\"spokane\" />\n\nOne of the more widespread rumors was that Arnold had become pregnant, had sought an [[abortion]], had died during or after the botched procedure, and had been secretly buried or cremated. This rumor gained some credibility when, in early April 1916, an illegal abortion clinic operating out of the basement of a home in [[Bellevue, Pennsylvania]] was raided by police. The clinic was run by Dr. C.C. Meredith and became notoriously known as \"The House of Mystery,\" after numerous women from the area went missing after visiting the clinic. One of the doctors who worked at the clinic, Dr. H.E. Lutz, testified to the district attorney that Dr. Meredith told him that Dorothy Arnold had died there after experiencing complications from an abortion. Dr. Lutz claimed that, like many of the women who had undergone abortions at the clinic and died, her body was burned in the furnace.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1914/04/10/100086478.pdf|format=PDF|title=Dorothy Arnold Story \u2013 Arrests in Pittsburgh Private Hospital Elicit Remarkable Tale|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 10, 1914}}</ref> While the New York District Attorney said he believed that Arnold had died at the clinic, Francis Arnold said he thought the story was \"...ridiculous and absolutely untrue.\"<ref name=\"gazette\" /> The Arnold family attorney, John S.

Glennoris claimed that an acquaintance known only as \"Little Louie\" hired him to drive a woman from a home in [[New Rochelle, New York]] to [[West Point, New York]]. At the home in New Rochelle, Glennoris said that he and Little Louie were met by two men: one of whom was named \"Doc\" and another that Glennoris described \"wealthy and well dressed...\" and that description matched George Griscom Jr's physical description.{{sfn|Gethard|2005|p=37}}<ref name=\"lewiston\">{{cite news|title=Voluntary Confession of Prisoner May Clear Up Five Year Old Mystery Of Girl's Disappearance|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1928&dat=19160418&id=maYgAAAAIBAJ&pg=2017,1033714|newspaper=[[Sun Journal (Lewiston, Maine)|The Lewiston Daily Sun]]|location=Lewiston, Maine|page=1, 7|date=April 18, 1916|accessdate=May 7, 2014}}</ref> Glennoris and Little Louie then loaded the unconscious woman in the car and drove her to a house in [[Weehawken, New Jersey]].

Arnold, a fine goods importer, Arnold was born and raised in [[Manhattan]] in an affluent family. After graduating from [[Bryn Mawr College]], she returned to her family home at 108 East [[79th Street (Manhattan)|79th Street]], and attempted to begin a career as a writer. On December 12, 1910, Arnold left to go shopping for a dress and was seen by a cashier as well as a friend on [[Fifth Avenue]]. Arnold told the friend that she had planned to walk through [[Central Park]] before returning home. That evening, when Arnold failed to return home for dinner, her family grew suspicious.\n\nFrancis Arnold was reluctant to garner publicity over his daughter's disappearance, and initially sought the help of [[private investigator]]s in locating her. After these attempts proved fruitless, the family filed a missing persons report with the New York City Police Department in January 1911.

The burned papers were presumed to be the rejected manuscripts Arnold submitted to ''McClure's'' magazine. Over the following weeks, Keith visited jails, hospitals and morgues in New York City, [[Philadelphia]] and [[Boston]] but did not find any sign of Arnold. After Keith's search proved fruitless, he suggested that the Arnold family hire [[Pinkerton (detective agency)|Pinkerton]] detectives to investigate.<ref name=churchhill/>\n\nPinkerton investigators searched area hospitals and other places that Arnold was known to frequent but found no trace of her. They also questioned Arnold's friends and former college classmates about her whereabouts, but none had seen her. As John Keith had found literature for transatlantic steamliners in Arnold's room the day after she disappeared, Pinkerton investigators theorized that Arnold might have eloped with a man to Europe. The agents searched marriage records but none were found bearing Dorothy Arnold's name. Agents were then dispatched overseas to search steamliners arriving from New York. While several women matching Arnold's physical description were found, Dorothy Arnold was not.{{sfn|Katz|2010|p=47}}\n\nAfter Keith and the Pinkerton detectives could not find Arnold, they persuaded Francis Arnold to call the police. The police advised Francis Arnold to hold a press conference in order to get as much publicity as possible. Francis Arnold resisted the suggestion but eventually agreed.<ref name=churchhill/> On January 25, 1911, reporters gathered at Francis Arnold's New York City office where he informed them of his daughter's disappearance and offered a $1,000 reward (approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000|1910|r=-3}}}} today) for information leading to her whereabouts. During the press conference, reporters asked Francis Arnold if it were possible that his daughter was still alive and had simply run away with a man, as he did not allow his daughter to date. Francis Arnold vehemently denied this stating, \"I would have been glad to see her associate more with young men than she did, especially some young men of brains and position: one whose profession or business would keep him occupied. I don\u2019t approve of young men who have nothing to do.\"<ref name=churchhill/> Reporters soon discovered that Francis Arnold's comment was in reference to George Griscom Jr., a man Dorothy had met while attending Bryn Mawr and with whom she was romantically involved.

After returning home, Arnold's parents forbade her to continue the relationship with Griscom Jr. because they found him unsuitable. Despite her parents' disapproval, Arnold continued to correspond with Griscom Jr.<ref name=spokane/> The two saw each other for a final time in early November, shortly before Griscom Jr. left on a vacation with his parents.{{sfn|Katz|2010|p=48}}\n\nAfter Arnold's disappearance, George Griscom Jr. was found vacationing with his parents in [[Florence]], [[Italy]]. The Arnold family sent him a telegram on December 16 asking for information about Dorothy's disappearance. In a return telegram, Griscom Jr. denied any knowledge of Arnold's whereabouts and claimed to know nothing of her disappearance. In early January 1911, Arnold's mother Mary and her brother John travelled to Italy by ship to forcibly interrogate Griscom Jr. They met Griscom Jr. in his room at the Anglo-American Hotel on January 16. Griscom Jr. continued to maintain that he knew nothing of Arnold's disappearance.\nDuring the visit, Mary and John Arnold demanded that Griscom Jr. give them the letters that Arnold had sent him. John Arnold later claimed the letters contained nothing of importance and said that he later destroyed them. Upon his return to the United States in February 1911, Griscom Jr. told the press that he intended to marry Arnold once she was found and on the condition that her mother approve of the marriage.

The ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' continued to cover the story on a near daily basis.{{sfn|Katz|2010|pages=48\u201349}} The publicity led to investigators receiving calls from people across the United States who claimed to have seen Arnold. These calls were investigated but proved to be false. The Arnold family also received two [[ransom note]]s from alleged kidnappers who demanded upwards of $5,000 for Arnold's return. The kidnapping claims proved to be hoaxes.\n\nIn early February 1911, Francis Arnold received a postcard signed \"Dorothy\" bearing a New York City postmark that read, \"I am safe.\" While the writing matched his daughter's, Francis Arnold said he believed that someone had copied Dorothy's handwriting from samples that were featured in the newspaper and that the postcard was nothing more than a cruel joke.{{sfn|Katz|2010|p=50}} Around the same time, a jeweler in [[San Francisco]], California claimed a woman he recognized as Arnold had him engrave a diamond wedding ring for her on January 7, with the inscription \"To A.J.A. from E.R.B., December 10, 1910.\"<ref>{{cite news|work=[[The Oregon Journal]]|location=Portland, Oregon|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/25255632/the_oregon_daily_journal/|title=Dorothy Arnold's Father Despairs|date=February 21, 1911|p=1|via=Newspapers.com}} {{open access}}</ref>\n\nShortly after this, the New York City police announced that they had decided to stop investigating Arnold's disappearance, saying they believed she was dead. New York City deputy police commissioner William J. Flynn stated, \"That now seems the only reasonable way of looking at the case. [...] The girl has now been missing for 75 days and in all that time not a single clue has been found that was worth the name. [...] We have no evidence that a crime has been committed and the case is now one of a missing person and nothing more.\"{{sfn|Katz|2010|p=51}} Police continued to investigate reports of sightings, but none led to Dorothy Arnold.{{sfn|Katz|2010|p=50}}\n\n===Rumors and theories===\nNumerous theories and rumors regarding Arnold's disappearance continued to arise. One theory was that Arnold had slipped on an icy sidewalk, struck her head and was in a hospital with total [[amnesia]]. This theory did not pan out as there were no women matching her description in area hospitals who had sustained a concussion. Other theories arose that Arnold had been drugged and abducted, but that theory was considered unlikely as Arnold was last seen on a busy street in mid-afternoon. George Griscom Jr. theorized that Arnold had committed suicide because she was despondent over her failed writing career.<ref name=\"spokane\" /> After her second short story was rejected, Arnold wrote a letter to Griscom Jr. expressing her disappointment over her failed writing career and alluded to suicide stating, \"Well, it has come back. ''McClure's'' has turned me down. Failure stares me in the face. All I can see ahead is a long road with no turning. Mother will always think an accident has happened.\"<ref name=\"tuscaloosa\" /> Some of Arnold's family members and friends also said they believed that Arnold had committed suicide, but felt she killed herself because her relationship with Griscom Jr. was faltering. The ''[[New York World]]'' also supported this reasoning after they discovered that Andrew Griscom, a cousin of Griscom Jr., had jumped to his death from an [[ocean liner]] after he had been forbidden to marry an English governess.<ref name=\"spokane\" />\n\nOne of the more widespread rumors was that Arnold had become pregnant, had sought an [[abortion]], had died during or after the botched procedure, and had been secretly buried or cremated. This rumor gained some credibility when, in early April 1916, an illegal abortion clinic operating out of the basement of a home in [[Bellevue, Pennsylvania]] was raided by police. The clinic was run by Dr. C.C. Meredith and became notoriously known as \"The House of Mystery,\" after numerous women from the area went missing after visiting the clinic. One of the doctors who worked at the clinic, Dr. H.E. Lutz, testified to the district attorney that Dr. Meredith told him that Dorothy Arnold had died there after experiencing complications from an abortion. Dr. Lutz claimed that, like many of the women who had undergone abortions at the clinic and died, her body was burned in the furnace.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1914/04/10/100086478.pdf|format=PDF|title=Dorothy Arnold Story \u2013 Arrests in Pittsburgh Private Hospital Elicit Remarkable Tale|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 10, 1914}}</ref> While the New York District Attorney said he believed that Arnold had died at the clinic, Francis Arnold said he thought the story was \"...ridiculous and absolutely untrue.\"<ref name=\"gazette\" /> The Arnold family attorney, John S.

Glennoris claimed that an acquaintance known only as \"Little Louie\" hired him to drive a woman from a home in [[New Rochelle, New York]] to [[West Point, New York]]. At the home in New Rochelle, Glennoris said that he and Little Louie were met by two men: one of whom was named \"Doc\" and another that Glennoris described \"wealthy and well dressed...\" and that description matched George Griscom Jr's physical description.{{sfn|Gethard|2005|p=37}}<ref name=\"lewiston\">{{cite news|title=Voluntary Confession of Prisoner May Clear Up Five Year Old Mystery Of Girl's Disappearance|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1928&dat=19160418&id=maYgAAAAIBAJ&pg=2017,1033714|newspaper=[[Sun Journal (Lewiston, Maine)|The Lewiston Daily Sun]]|location=Lewiston, Maine|page=1, 7|date=April 18, 1916|accessdate=May 7, 2014}}</ref> Glennoris and Little Louie then loaded the unconscious woman in the car and drove her to a house in [[Weehawken, New Jersey]].

Glennoris said that he and Little Louie then drove the woman's body back to the home in New Rochelle, wrapped the body in a sheet, and buried it in the cellar.<ref name=\"lewiston\" /> \n\nGlennoris initially told this story to a prison warden, who then reported it to authorities.<ref name=rich/> However, upon subsequent interviews with law enforcement, Glennoris acted confused and claimed to know nothing of it.<ref name=rich/> Police followed up on Glennoris' story and excavated the cellars of several homes in the area, but did not locate any human remains.{{sfn|Gethard|2005|p=37}} Arnold's father refuted Glennoris' claim, telling reporters: \"So far it appears on the face of the man's story, he is talking utter nonsense.\"<ref name=rich/>\n\n===Aftermath===\nYears after Dorothy Arnold disappeared, numerous alleged sightings from all over the United States were still being reported. Police continued to investigate the reports, but all proved to be false. The Arnold family also continued to receive letters from women claiming to be Dorothy Arnold.
