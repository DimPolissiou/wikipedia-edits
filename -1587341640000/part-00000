He played [[college football]] at the [[University of Missouri]], where he was a two way starter, playing on both the offensive and defensive lines under head coach [[Dan Devine]].  As a first-team All-[[Big Eight Conference]] [[defensive tackle]] in 1965, Van Dyke played on Tigers teams that went a combined 21\u20138\u20132 from 1963 to 1965.  The [[1965 Missouri Tigers football team|1965 Missouri squad]], on which he served as a captain, finished the year ranked sixth nationally, with a win over the [[1965 Florida Gators football team|Florida]] in the 1966 Sugar Bowl.  Van Dyke was selected to play in the Hula Bowl in 1966, and was inducted into the University of Missouri's Intercollegiate Hall of Fame in 2001.\n\n==Professional career==\nVan Dyke was selected in the 12th round of the [[1966 NFL Draft]] by the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] and in the 15th round of the [[1966 AFL Draft]] by the [[Kansas City Chiefs]].  He signed with the Eagles and played there his rookie year.  The following season he was traded to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] where he played right guard for the next seven seasons.  His first year with the Steelers the team had won only one game.  In 1972 Pittsburgh finished the season with an 11\u20133 record and won the [[AFC Central]] title.  In week 8 of the 1972 Steelers season Van Dyke was named A.P. Offensive player of the week after a 40\u201317 win over the [[Cincinnati Bengals]].  That same year the Steelers made their first playoff appearance since the 1947 season and won their first franchise playoff game beating the [[Oakland Raiders]] 13\u20137.  During that game, one of the most memorable plays in both Van Dyke's career and NFL history occurred.  Trailing 7\u20136 with 22 seconds left in the game, [[Franco Harris]] scored the winning touchdown on the final play of the game.  This play, of course, is known as the [[Immaculate Reception]].  In 1974, Van Dyke was traded to the [[Green Bay Packers]], where he was reunited with his former college coach Dan Devine.  While in Green Bay he switched to left guard and retired from football after the 1976 season. In 2008, Van Dyke was named to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers Legends team]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Eagles1966DraftPicks}}{{Pittsburgh Steelers Legends team}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Van Dyke, Bruce}}\n[[Category:1944 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American football offensive guards]]\n[[Category:Green Bay Packers players]]\n[[Category:Missouri Tigers football players]]\n[[Category:Philadelphia Eagles players]]\n[[Category:Pittsburgh Steelers players]]\n[[Category:American Conference Pro Bowl players]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Independence, Missouri]]\n[[Category:People from Lancaster, California]]\n[[Category:Players of American football from Missouri]]\n[[Category:People from Jackson County, Missouri]]\n\n\n{{offensive-lineman-1940s-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American football player}}\n{{unreferenced BLP|date=March 2019}}\n{{Infobox NFL player\n|name=Bruce Van Dyke\n|image=Bruce van dyke.tif\n|number=66, 61\n|position=[[Guard (American and Canadian football)|Guard]]\n|birth_date={{Birth date and age|1944|8|6}}\n|birth_place=[[Lancaster, California]]\n|height_ft=6\n|height_in=2\n|weight_lbs=255\n|high_school=[[Fort Osage High School|Fort Osage]]<br/>([[Independence, Missouri]])\n|college=[[Missouri Tigers football|Missouri]]\n|draftyear=1966\n|draftround=12\n|draftpick=174\n|afldraftyear=1966\n|afldraftround=15\n|afldraftpick=133\n|pastteams=\n* [[Philadelphia Eagles]] ({{NFL Year|1966}})\n* [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] ({{NFL Year|1967|1973}})\n* [[Green Bay Packers]] ({{NFL Year|1974|1976}})\n|highlights=\n* [[Pro Bowl]] ([[1974 Pro Bowl|1973]])\n* 2\u00d7 Second-Team [[All-Pro]] (1972, 1973)\n* [[1966 Sugar Bowl]]\n* [[Hula Bowl]]\n* [[Missouri Sports Hall of Fame]] inductee (2010)\n|statlabel1=Games played\n|statvalue1=128\n|statlabel2=Games started\n|statvalue2=121\n|nflnew=brucevandyke/2527856\n|pfr=V/VanDBr00\n}}\n'''Bruce Van Dyke'''  (born August 6, 1944) is a former [[American football]] [[Guard (American and Canadian football)|guard ]]who played eleven seasons  in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], and the [[Green Bay Packers]].\n\n==Early years==\nVan Dyke grew up in [[Buckner, Missouri]], and attended [[Fort Osage High School]] in [[Independence, Missouri]].

It lies in a pleasant rolling countryside with a mosaic of fields, meadows and hundreds of ponds.\n\nBlatn\u00e1 is also the seat of the Municipality with Extended Competence and Municipality with Commissioned Local Authority within the same borders.\n\n==History==\n=== The Castle===\nAlthough the area has been inhabited since the 6th century, the first written record of Blatn\u00e1 dates back to 1235, when probably just a wooden fortress built on a rocky piece of land in the middle of a marshland (''blata'' in old Czech, hence the name Blatn\u00e1 - A Marshy Place) existed. Not much is known about the castle until the second half of the 13th century, when it becomes the property of the house of Bavorov\u00e9 of [[Strakonice]]. There exists a legend that in those times the fortress was a seat of the [[Knights Templar|Templars]] who are said to have hidden a treasure somewhere in the castle. The only remaining construction from this period are the foundations of a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] chapel.\n\nFrom 1391 the castle and then already existing town belonged to the house of Lvov\u00e9 (i.e. Lions) of Ro\u017emit\u00e1l. Under the new masters the fortress was for the first time rebuilt in stone (the oldest parts being the tower and Ro\u017emit\u00e1lsk\u00fd Palace) and the surrounding marshes were changed into wide water trenches, thus giving the castle the looks of \"A swan sitting in a lake\". Their long rule marks the golden age of this place. Lvov\u00e9 were continuously rebuilding and enlarging the castle, first with the so-called Old Palace, standing separatedly over the remnants of the Romanesque Chapel. In 1523\u20131530, under the guidance of renowned royal builder [[Benedikt Rejt|Benedikt Ried of Piesting (or Benedikt Rejt of P\u00edstov)]], a new palace in a mixed Gothic-Renaissance style was appended (it is named after Rejt these days).\n\nIn the second half of the 17th century, the castle was owned by the house of \u0160ternberkov\u00e9 for a short time until it was bought by the Polish house of Rozdra\u017eov\u0161t\u00ed of Rozdra\u017eov in 1579 who had a new [[Renaissance]] palace built. During their rule, the castle and town were looted. The Baroque period is marked by the Hungarian house of Ser\u00e9nyi who had the castle rebuilt (namely after the big fire in 1763) and also erected many statues in the town and its surroundings. They also completely rebuilt the church in Pa\u0161tiky.\n\nSince 1798, the castle has belonged to the Tyrolian house by origin of Hildprandtov\u00e9 of Ottenhausen, except the period of communist dictatorship (1948\u20131989) when it was confiscated by the state. In 1850\u20131856 the castle received its last rebuilt, in English Gothic style, which gave it its contemporary looks.\n\nThe castle is now being restored with most of the works finished. It is still open for tourists, together with the magnificent landscape garden.\n\n===The Town===\nThe settlement around the castle was promoted to a little town (''m\u011bste\u010dko'' in Czech) probably around 1300. In 1601 it gained a full town status. The town burned down completely on 1834-09-13 - 118 houses, the town hall and the bell tower were destroyed and therefore most buildings in the town come from after that event.\n\n===The Lords of Blatn\u00e1===\n*13th century legends: Templars or Johannites\n*13th century \u2013 1391: Bavorov\u00e9 of Strakonice\n*1391\u20131541: Lvov\u00e9 z Ro\u017emit\u00e1lu\n*1541\u20131579: Rozdra\u017eov\u0161t\u00ed z Rozdra\u017eova\n*1579\u20131695: the house of Ser\u00e9nyi\n*1798\u20131948: Hildprandts of Ottenhausen\n*1948\u20131989: None\n*1989\u2013today: Hildprandts of Ottenhausen\n\n==Geography==\nThe town lies on the small river of Lomnice in a gently rolling area built of granite rocks, thus the soils are not very fertile. There are many granite quarries (for gravel and construction stones), some closed ones are now flooded and are they very scenic places. In past there were many marshes making the countryside even less hospitable. Since the Middle Ages, however, people have been transforming the land by building plethora of small to large lakes which now grace the area. The largest artificial lake is Labu\u0165 (i.e. Swan) at <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">108.5&nbsp;ha&nbsp;(268.1&nbsp;acre)</span> some <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">5&nbsp;km</span> to the north-east of the town.\n\n==Climate==\nBlatna enjoys an inland version of [[temperate]] [[Oceanic climate]] (Cfb) with rather balanced temperatures year round. Precipitations are vastly in form of rain, totalling 691&nbsp;mm. There are four pronounced seasons with notably cold, dry, and murky winter season, contrasting with much sunnier and wetter warm seasons. Average round the clock temperatures in July stays on +17.2&nbsp;\u00b0C and January mean temperatures stays on \u22122.5&nbsp;\u00b0C.

It is built on a rock surrounded by a [[moat]] (i. e. artificial water trench), which looks rather like a lake. The castle is narrow, U-shaped, with a tower in front to which the palaces from various periods attach. It opens to a large landscaped garden. Some of the castle has been recently reconstructed and it is open to the public in the tourist season (April\u2013October). Most of the castle is in a very bad state for a long time already.\n\n*'''Romanesque Chapel''' - the oldest part of the castle dating back to the 13th century, it is preserved only as a part of the wall with two arches in the western part of the courtyard.\n*'''Tower''' - the tower dominates the castle and it is the main entrance to it from the East. Its square shape with an overlapping half-timbered top became the symbol of the town. At the beginning of the 16th century the famous Green Chamber (''Zelen\u00e1 sv\u011btnice'') was created on the first floor. The walls of this room are covered in murals depicting various religious and secular themes. The prevailing color of the paintings gave the room its name. All around the room are coats of arms of major Czech houses dominated by a large one of the house of the masters on the castle of that time, the Lords of Lvov\u00e9 of Ro\u017emit\u00e1l.\n*'''Ro\u017emit\u00e1lsk\u00fd Palace''' \u2212 built at the same time as the tower, it connects to it from the southwest. On the first floor is the castle Chapel of Blessed Virgin Mary, whose Gothic presbytery protrudes from the body of the palace on the south side.\n*'''Old Palace''' - from around the half of the 15th century is erected over the former Romanesque chapel. It's built in a late Gothic style, but its large windows already mark the coming of the Renaissance style. Originally, it stood separately to the north from the previous two parts.\n*'''Rejt's Palace''' - is a unique combination of a late Gothic and the upcoming Renaissance style. It was built during the rule of Zden\u011bk Lev of Ro\u017emit\u00e1l, an important diplomat at the court of the Czech king Vladislav Jagellonsk\u00fd. It has large windows, richly decorated fa\u00e7ade and a structured roof with wooden-tile ceilings.\n*'''Rozdra\u017eovsk\u00fd (or Ser\u00e9nyi) Palace''' - built first in the Renaissance style and rebuilt later in the Baroque style, it closed the body of the castle by connecting the Old Palace (through a lower utility building) with the rest of the castle buildings.\n\n===Park===\n[[File:Blatn\u00e1 (CZE) - park in winter.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Park in winter]]\n<!--[[File:Blatn\u00e1 (CZE) - fallow-deer in park.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Fallow-deer in the park]]-->\nIt spreads next to the [[castle]] on an area of {{convert|42|ha|acre}}. The park was created as an [[English landscape garden]] at the beginning of the 19th century by Franti\u0161ek Hildprandt. Its part close to the castle surrounds a large meadow with very old solitary [[oak]] trees. Beyond the meadow are preserved old woods with alleys, swamps, streams with footbridges over them, [[Grotto|artificial caves]], remnants after [[placer mining]] and an [[Empire (style)|Empire-style]] summer house. A herd of tame [[fallow deer]] freely roams the park, which is open to the public year-round.\n\n===Gothic church===\n[[File:Blatn\u00e1 (CZE) - bell tower + church.jpg|thumb|120px|right|The Bell Tower and the back of the Gothic Church]]\nThe Church of the Assumption of Mary lies next to the castle, at the end of the main square. It was founded around 1290 as a two-aisled building with a long presbytery, and small adytum on the north side. It gained its present looks in 1515 when a rebuilt was finished. It is surprisingly large for even then a rather small town, with its length of {{convert|37|m|ft}} and height of {{convert|16|m|ft}}.\n\n===Bell tower===\nThe Bell Tower (''Zvonice'' in Czech) in its present location was first built in 1723 when a {{convert|44|m|ft|adj=on}} tower was erected. It was destroyed with most of the town in the big fire of 1834 but was soon built again, at {{convert|52|m|ft}} of height.\n\n===School===\nThere are two elementary schools in town.\n[[File:Blatn\u00e1 (CZE) - school of Comenius.jpg|thumb|160px|left|School of Comenius]]\nA very large building from 1902\u20131904 which carries the name of J. A. Commenius. (''J. A. Komensk\u00fd'' in Czech), built by Karel Fiala, an architect who participated in the reconstruction of the Prague Castle.\n\n===Church in Pa\u0161tiky===\n[[File:Pa\u0161tiky (CZE) - church.jpg|thumb|160px|right|The church in Pa\u0161tiky]]\nA unique [[Baroque]] Church of [[St. John the Baptist]] towering over Blatn\u00e1 some {{convert|2|km|mi}} to the north. It stands on a place of an older parish church from the 14th century. It was completely rebuilt by renowned architect [[Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer]] between 1747\u20131752, on the order of countess Ser\u00e9nyi. The church is a single-aisled building ended in a rectangular presbytery with richly decorated cornices in a [[Rococo]] style. The carvings inside are by [[Ferdinand Ublacker]], the paintings are by J. V. [[Spitzer]]. It is currently undergoing  a reconstruction. Next to the church is a cemetery with a Mortuary Chapel under which is the family crypt of the house of the [[Hildprandt]]s.\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Kamil B\u011bhounek]] (1916\u20131983), [[accordion]]ist and composer\n* [[Karel Strakat\u00fd]] (1804\u20131868), operatic bass, first interpreter of the [[Kde domov m\u016fj|Czech national anthem]]\n* Jan Mikul\u00e1\u0161 H\u00e1la (born 1937), painter\n* Dimitrij Slonim (1925\u20132017), microbiologist, virologist\n\n==Twin towns \u2014 sister cities==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in the Czech Republic}}\n\nBlatn\u00e1 is [[town twinning|twinned]] with:<ref>{{cite web |title=Partnersk\u00e1 m\u011bsta|url=https://www.mesto-blatna.cz/mesto-blatna/mezinarodni-spoluprace/partnerska-mesta/|publisher=M\u011bsto Blatn\u00e1|language=cs|accessdate=2019-08-25}}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|UK}} [[Calderdale]], [[United Kingdom]], from 1992\n*{{flagicon|SUI}} [[Roggwil, Bern|Roggwil]], [[Switzerland]], from 1993\n*{{flagicon|GER}} [[Vacha, Germany|Vacha]], [[Germany]], from 1993\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Sarg\u00e9-l\u00e8s-le-Mans]], [[France]], from 2004\n*{{flagicon|SVK}} [[Va\u017eec]], [[Slovakia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book\n| last = Koub\u00edk\n| first = V.\n| author2 = J\u00edrovec, J.\n| title = Jeden\u00e1ct blatensk\u00fdch zastaven\u00ed\n| publisher = M\u011bstsk\u00e9 muzeum v Blatn\u00e9\n| year = 2001\n| location = Blatn\u00e1\n| pages =\n| id =\n}}\n\n*{{cite book\n| last = \u0160imek\n| first = Martin\n| title = Blatn\u00e1\n| publisher = Nakladatelstv\u00ed Fraus\n| year = 2004\n| location = Plze\u0148\n| pages =\n| isbn = 80-7238-351-5\n}}\n*{{cite book\n| last = Poche\n| first = Emanuel\n| author2=et col.\n| title = Um\u011bleck\u00e9 pam\u00e1tky \u010cech 1 &#91;A/J&#93;\n| publisher = Academia\n| year = 1977\n| location = Praha\n| pages =\n| id =\n}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Blatn\u00e1}}\n* [http://www.mesto-blatna.cz/ Blatn\u00e1] Official website\n* [http://www.radio.cz/en/section/spotlight/blatna-castle Interview With Jana Germanis, Baroness of Blatn\u00e1 Castle]\n\n{{Strakonice District}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Blatna}}\n[[Category:Cities and towns in the Czech Republic]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Strakonice District]]\n[[Category:Pr\u00e1che\u0148sko]]\n", "text_old": "{{more footnotes|date=March 2012}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name                    = Blatn\u00e1\n| native_name             = \n| other_name              = \n| settlement_type         = Town\n<!-- images, nickname, motto -->\n| image_skyline           = Blatna (CZE) -

Under the new masters the fortress was for the first time rebuilt in stone (the oldest parts being the tower and Ro\u017emit\u00e1lsk\u00fd Palace) and the surrounding marshes were changed into wide water trenches, thus giving the castle the looks of \"A swan sitting in a lake\". Their long rule marks the golden age of this place. Lvov\u00e9 were continuously rebuilding and enlarging the castle, first with the so-called Old Palace, standing separatedly over the remnants of the Romanesque Chapel. In 1523\u20131530, under the guidance of renowned royal builder [[Benedikt Rejt|Benedikt Ried of Piesting (or Benedikt Rejt of P\u00edstov)]], a new palace in a mixed Gothic-Renaissance style was appended (it is named after Rejt these days).\n\nIn the second half of the 17th century, the castle was owned by the house of \u0160ternberkov\u00e9 for a short time until it was bought by the Polish house of Rozdra\u017eov\u0161t\u00ed of Rozdra\u017eov in 1579 who had a new [[Renaissance]] palace built. During their rule, the castle and town were looted. The Baroque period is marked by the Hungarian house of Ser\u00e9nyi who had the castle rebuilt (namely after the big fire in 1763) and also erected many statues in the town and its surroundings. They also completely rebuilt the church in Pa\u0161tiky.\n\nSince 1798, the castle has belonged to the Tyrolian house by origin of Hildprandtov\u00e9 of Ottenhausen, except the period of communist dictatorship (1948\u20131989) when it was confiscated by the state. In 1850\u20131856 the castle received its last rebuilt, in English Gothic style, which gave it its contemporary looks.\n\nThe castle is now being restored with most of the works finished. It is still open for tourists, together with the magnificent landscape garden.\n\n===The Town===\nThe settlement around the castle was promoted to a little town (''m\u011bste\u010dko'' in Czech) probably around 1300. In 1601 it gained a full town status. The town burned down completely on 1834-09-13 - 118 houses, the town hall and the bell tower were destroyed and therefore most buildings in the town come from after that event.\n\n===The Lords of Blatn\u00e1===\n*13th century legends: Templars or Johannites\n*13th century \u2013 1391: Bavorov\u00e9 of Strakonice\n*1391\u20131541: Lvov\u00e9 z Ro\u017emit\u00e1lu\n*1541\u20131579: Rozdra\u017eov\u0161t\u00ed z Rozdra\u017eova\n*1579\u20131695: the house of Ser\u00e9nyi\n*1798\u20131948: Hildprandts of Ottenhausen\n*1948\u20131989: None\n*1989\u2013today: Hildprandts of Ottenhausen\n\n==Geography==\nThe town lies on the small river of Lomnice in a gently rolling area built of granite rocks, thus the soils are not very fertile. There are many granite quarries (for gravel and construction stones), some closed ones are now flooded and are they very scenic places. In past there were many marshes making the countryside even less hospitable. Since the Middle Ages, however, people have been transforming the land by building plethora of small to large lakes which now grace the area. The largest artificial lake is Labu\u0165 (i.e. Swan) at <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">108.5&nbsp;ha&nbsp;(268.1&nbsp;acre)</span> some <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">5&nbsp;km</span> to the north-east of the town.\n\n==Climate==\nBlatna enjoys an inland version of [[temperate]] [[Oceanic climate]] (Cfb) with rather balanced temperatures year round. Precipitations are vastly in form of rain, totalling 691&nbsp;mm. There are four pronounced seasons with notably cold, dry, and murky winter season, contrasting with much sunnier and wetter warm seasons. Average round the clock temperatures in July stays on +17.2&nbsp;\u00b0C and January mean temperatures stays on \u22122.5&nbsp;\u00b0C.

It is built on a rock surrounded by a [[moat]] (i. e. artificial water trench), which looks rather like a lake. The castle is narrow, U-shaped, with a tower in front to which the palaces from various periods attach. It opens to a large landscaped garden. Some of the castle has been recently reconstructed and it is open to the public in the tourist season (April\u2013October). Most of the castle is in a very bad state for a long time already.\n\n*'''Romanesque Chapel''' - the oldest part of the castle dating back to the 13th century, it is preserved only as a part of the wall with two arches in the western part of the courtyard.\n*'''Tower''' - the tower dominates the castle and it is the main entrance to it from the East. Its square shape with an overlapping half-timbered top became the symbol of the town. At the beginning of the 16th century the famous Green Chamber (''Zelen\u00e1 sv\u011btnice'') was created on the first floor. The walls of this room are covered in murals depicting various religious and secular themes. The prevailing color of the paintings gave the room its name. All around the room are coats of arms of major Czech houses dominated by a large one of the house of the masters on the castle of that time, the Lords of Lvov\u00e9 of Ro\u017emit\u00e1l.\n*'''Ro\u017emit\u00e1lsk\u00fd Palace''' \u2212 built at the same time as the tower, it connects to it from the southwest. On the first floor is the castle Chapel of Blessed Virgin Mary, whose Gothic presbytery protrudes from the body of the palace on the south side.\n*'''Old Palace''' - from around the half of the 15th century is erected over the former Romanesque chapel. It's built in a late Gothic style, but its large windows already mark the coming of the Renaissance style. Originally, it stood separately to the north from the previous two parts.\n*'''Rejt's Palace''' - is a unique combination of a late Gothic and the upcoming Renaissance style. It was built during the rule of Zden\u011bk Lev of Ro\u017emit\u00e1l, an important diplomat at the court of the Czech king Vladislav Jagellonsk\u00fd. It has large windows, richly decorated fa\u00e7ade and a structured roof with wooden-tile ceilings.\n*'''Rozdra\u017eovsk\u00fd (or Ser\u00e9nyi) Palace''' - built first in the Renaissance style and rebuilt later in the Baroque style, it closed the body of the castle by connecting the Old Palace (through a lower utility building) with the rest of the castle buildings.\n\n===Park===\n[[File:Blatn\u00e1 (CZE) - park in winter.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Park in winter]]\n<!--[[File:Blatn\u00e1 (CZE) - fallow-deer in park.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Fallow-deer in the park]]-->\nIt spreads next to the [[castle]] on an area of {{convert|42|ha|acre}}. The park was created as an [[English landscape garden]] at the beginning of the 19th century by Franti\u0161ek Hildprandt. Its part close to the castle surrounds a large meadow with very old solitary [[oak]] trees. Beyond the meadow are preserved old woods with alleys, swamps, streams with footbridges over them, [[Grotto|artificial caves]], remnants after [[placer mining]] and an [[Empire (style)|Empire-style]] summer house. A herd of tame [[fallow deer]] freely roams the park, which is open to the public year round.\n\n===Gothic church===\n[[File:Blatn\u00e1 (CZE) - bell tower + church.jpg|thumb|120px|right|The Bell Tower and the back of the Gothic Church]]\nThe Church of the Assumption of Mary lies next to the castle, at the end of the main square. It was founded around 1290 as a two-aisled building with a long presbytery, and small adytum on the north side. It gained its present looks in 1515 when a rebuilt was finished. It is surprisingly large for even then a rather small town, with its length of {{convert|37|m|ft}} and height of {{convert|16|m|ft}}.\n\n===Bell tower===\nThe Bell Tower (''Zvonice'' in Czech) in its present location was first built in 1723 when a {{convert|44|m|ft|adj=on}} tower was erected. It was destroyed with most of the town in the big fire of 1834 but was soon built again, at {{convert|52|m|ft}} of height.\n\n===School===\nThere are two elementary schools in town.\n[[File:Blatn\u00e1 (CZE) - school of Comenius.jpg|thumb|160px|left|School of Comenius]]\nA very large building from 1902\u20131904 which carries the name of J. A. Commenius. (''J. A. Komensk\u00fd'' in Czech), built by Karel Fiala, an architect who participated in the reconstruction of the Prague Castle.\n\n===Church in Pa\u0161tiky===\n[[File:Pa\u0161tiky (CZE) - church.jpg|thumb|160px|right|The church in Pa\u0161tiky]]\nA unique [[Baroque]] Church of [[St. John the Baptist]] towering over Blatn\u00e1 some {{convert|2|km|mi}} to the north. It stands on a place of an older parish church from the 14th century. It was completely rebuilt by renowned architect [[Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer]] between 1747\u20131752, on the order of countess Ser\u00e9nyi. The church is a single-aisled building ended in a rectangular presbytery with richly decorated cornices in a [[Rococo]] style. The carvings inside are by [[Ferdinand Ublacker]], the paintings are by J. V. [[Spitzer]]. It is currently undergoing  a reconstruction. Next to the church is a cemetery with a Mortuary Chapel under which is the family crypt of the house of the [[Hildprandt]]s.\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Kamil B\u011bhounek]] (1916\u20131983), [[accordion]]ist and composer\n* [[Karel Strakat\u00fd]] (1804\u20131868), operatic bass, first interpreter of the [[Kde domov m\u016fj|Czech national anthem]]\n* Jan Mikul\u00e1\u0161 H\u00e1la (born 1937), painter\n* Dimitrij Slonim (1925\u20132017), microbiologist, virologist\n\n==Twin towns \u2014 sister cities==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in the Czech Republic}}\n\nBlatn\u00e1 is [[town twinning|twinned]] with:<ref>{{cite web |title=Partnersk\u00e1 m\u011bsta|url=https://www.mesto-blatna.cz/mesto-blatna/mezinarodni-spoluprace/partnerska-mesta/|publisher=M\u011bsto Blatn\u00e1|language=cs|accessdate=2019-08-25}}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|UK}} [[Calderdale]], [[United Kingdom]], from 1992\n*{{flagicon|SUI}} [[Roggwil, Bern|Roggwil]], [[Switzerland]], from 1993\n*{{flagicon|GER}} [[Vacha, Germany|Vacha]], [[Germany]], from 1993\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Sarg\u00e9-l\u00e8s-le-Mans]], [[France]], from 2004\n*{{flagicon|SVK}} [[Va\u017eec]], [[Slovakia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book\n| last = Koub\u00edk\n| first = V.\n| author2 = J\u00edrovec, J.\n| title = Jeden\u00e1ct blatensk\u00fdch zastaven\u00ed\n| publisher = M\u011bstsk\u00e9 muzeum v Blatn\u00e9\n| year = 2001\n| location = Blatn\u00e1\n| pages =\n| id =\n}}\n\n*{{cite book\n| last = \u0160imek\n| first = Martin\n| title = Blatn\u00e1\n| publisher = Nakladatelstv\u00ed Fraus\n| year = 2004\n| location = Plze\u0148\n| pages =\n| isbn = 80-7238-351-5\n}}\n*{{cite book\n| last = Poche\n| first = Emanuel\n| author2=et col.\n| title = Um\u011bleck\u00e9 pam\u00e1tky \u010cech 1 &#91;A/J&#93;\n| publisher = Academia\n| year = 1977\n| location = Praha\n| pages =\n| id =\n}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Blatn\u00e1}}\n* [http://www.mesto-blatna.cz/ Blatn\u00e1] Official website\n* [http://www.radio.cz/en/section/spotlight/blatna-castle Interview With Jana Germanis, Baroness of Blatn\u00e1 Castle]\n\n{{Strakonice District}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Blatna}}\n[[Category:Cities and towns in the Czech Republic]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Strakonice District]]\n[[Category:Pr\u00e1che\u0148sko]]\n", "name_user": "I dream of horses", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePark:clean up,typo(s) fixed: year round \u2192 year-round", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blatn%C3%A1"}

Given the training focus and difficulty of the RSLC, the school is still commonly attended by operators from [[Special Forces (United States Army)|U.S. Army Special Forces]], the [[Regimental Reconnaissance Company|75th Ranger Regiment's Regimental Reconnaissance Company]], [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEALs]], and [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance|Marine reconnaissance units]]; today's students also come from more conventional [[infantry]], [[Stryker]] and [[armor]]ed [[Brigade Combat Team]]s (BCT). Following the US Army decision to disband US Army LRS companies, the reconnaissance fundamentals taught in the course also provides U.S. military commanders the ability to preserve key LRS skills and abilities within the conventional force.<ref name=\"Official Site\"/>\n\nGiven the importance of timely, accurate and relevant battlefield information, U.S. Military commanders require reconnaissance professionals be well-trained, highly skilled and disciplined, and capable of operating forward of BCTs. The course curriculum is primarily designed to train small unit leaders assigned to reconnaissance formations to include infantry, Stryker and armored BCT [[Cavalry scout|cavalry squadrons]]; infantry, Stryker, and Combined Arms Battalion (CAB) scout platoons; and [[Special forces|special operations forces]].  The RSLC program of Instruction (PoI) is continuously assessed and refined to ensure it meets these needs, the needs of reconnaissance units, and those of a U.S. Joint force at war.<ref name=\"Official Site\"/>\n\n==History==\nIn 1958, the commanding general of the [[101st Airborne Division]], [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[William Westmoreland]], noticed a failing of proficiency and initiative in [[squad]], [[fireteam]], and [[patrol]] leaders during an exercise code named White Cloud.  [[General (United States)|General]] (GEN) Westmoreland was a veteran of the [[Invasion of Normandy]] and realized the importance of small unit leaders and individuals who had been separated from their parent units to take action against superior enemy forces.

Located on Camp Cornett at Fort Benning's Harmony Church cantonment area, the RSLC PoI is tailored to train and test the fundamentals of reconnaissance operations for Soldiers and leaders assigned to reconnaissance teams and squads.  Therefore, priority for training is to team leaders and above (pay grades of E-4s and above) assigned oversight of small unit reconnaissance operations without prior reconnaissance training and experience.  In addition to resident course instruction, the RSLC PoI provides opportunities to deliver menu-based training through Mobile Training Teams (MTT) at a requesting unit's home station location.  Menu-based training enables unit commanders to meet specific reconnaissance focused training priorities without sacrificing other training needs in support of a unit's operational mission requirements.

Given the training focus and difficulty of the RSLC, the school is still commonly attended by operators from [[Special Forces (United States Army)|U.S. Army Special Forces]], the [[Regimental Reconnaissance Company|75th Ranger Regiment's Regimental Reconnaissance Company]], [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEALs]], and [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance|Marine reconnaissance units]]; today's students also come from more conventional [[infantry]], [[Stryker]] and [[armor]]ed [[Brigade Combat Team]]s (BCT).

The course curriculum is primarily designed to train small unit leaders assigned to reconnaissance formations to include infantry, Stryker and armored BCT [[Cavalry scout|cavalry squadrons]]; infantry, Stryker, and Combined Arms Battalion (CAB) scout platoons; and [[Special forces|special operations forces]].  The RSLC program of Instruction (PoI) is continuously assessed and refined to ensure it meets these needs, the needs of reconnaissance units, and those of a U.S. Joint force at war.<ref name=\"Official Site\"/>\n\n==History==\nIn 1958, the commanding general of the [[101st Airborne Division]], [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[William Westmoreland]], noticed a failing of proficiency and initiative in [[squad]], [[fireteam]], and [[patrol]] leaders during an exercise code named White Cloud.  [[General (United States)|General]] (GEN) Westmoreland was a veteran of the [[Invasion of Normandy]] and realized the importance of small unit leaders and individuals who had been separated from their parent units to take action against superior enemy forces.
