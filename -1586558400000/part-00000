After working at Le Gavroche for a year, Albert Roux invited Ramsay to work with him at Hotel Diva, a ski resort in the [[French Alps]], as his number two.

The restaurant was renamed [[Aubergine (London restaurant)|Aubergine]] and went on to win its first [[Michelin star]] fourteen months later. In 1997, Aubergine won its second Michelin star.

White discouraged Ramsay from taking a job in Paris, instead encouraging him to work for [[Albert Roux]] at [[Le Gavroche]] in [[Mayfair]], where he met Jean-Claude Breton, now his [[ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel]] at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay. After working at Le Gavroche for a year, Albert Roux invited Ramsay to work with him at Hotel Diva, a ski resort in the [[French Alps]], as his number two. From there, a 23-year-old Ramsay moved to Paris to work with [[Guy Savoy (chef)|Guy Savoy]] and [[Jo\u00ebl Robuchon]], both [[Michelin star|Michelin-starred]] chefs. In ''Master Chef'' series 3 episode 18, Gordon Ramsay stated that Guy Savoy was his mentor. He continued his training in France for three years, before giving in to the physical and mental stress of the kitchens and taking a year to work as a personal chef on the private yacht ''Idlewild'', based in [[Bermuda]].<ref name=\"HumblePie\"/> The role on the boat saw him travel to [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]], [[Italy]], and learn about Italian cuisine.<ref>{{Citation|last=BabbleTop|title=10 Times Gordon Ramsay was ACTUALLY NICE!|date=30 August 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vF8GvyjMP8|accessdate=6 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Head chef==\nUpon his return to London in 1993, Ramsay was offered the position of head chef, under chef-patron [[Pierre Koffmann]], at the three-Michelin-starred [[La Tante Claire]] in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]]. Shortly thereafter, Marco Pierre White reentered his life, offering to set him up with a head chef position and 10% share in the Rossmore, owned by White's business partners. The restaurant was renamed [[Aubergine (London restaurant)|Aubergine]] and went on to win its first [[Michelin star]] fourteen months later. In 1997, Aubergine won its second Michelin star. Despite the restaurant's success, a dispute with Ramsay's business owners, who wanted to turn Aubergine into a chain, and Ramsay's dream of running his own restaurant led to his leaving the partnership in July 1998.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/30/style/chefs-walkoutwith-staff-sets-london-abroil.html |last=Today I Found Out|title=From Soccer Hopeful to Worlds Angriest Chef|date=24 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BvaNnfrsSI|title=From Soccer Hopeful to Worlds Angriest Chef|accessdate=23 January 2017}}</ref> He has described the decision to set out on his own as \"the most important day of my entire cooking career; the most important decision of my life\".<ref>''Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares'' episode \"Rococo\" (2006)</ref>\n\nIn 1998, Ramsay opened his own restaurant in Chelsea, [[Restaurant Gordon Ramsay]], with the help of his father-in-law, Chris Hutcheson, and his former colleagues at Aubergine.<ref name=\":1\">{{Citation|last=Today I Found Out|title=From Soccer Hopeful to Worlds Angriest Chef|date=24 October 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BvaNnfrsSI|accessdate=23 January 2017}}</ref> The restaurant gained its third Michelin star in 2001, making Ramsay the first Scot to achieve that feat.<ref name=\"Chef Trouble\">{{cite news | title=Gordon Ramsay: Chef terrible |work=BBC News World Edition | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1448742.stm |accessdate=1 August 2006 | date=20 July 2001}}</ref> In 2011, ''[[The Good Food Guide]]'' listed Restaurant Gordon Ramsay as the second best in the UK, only bettered by [[The Fat Duck]] in [[Bray, Berkshire]].<ref>{{cite news|title=The Good Food Guide's Top 60 UK Restaurants AnnouNced|url=http://www.thegoodfoodguide.co.uk/news/the-good-food-guides-top-60-uk-restaurants-announced|accessdate=9 May 2011|newspaper=The Good Food Guide}}</ref>\n\nAfter establishing his first restaurant, Ramsay's empire expanded rapidly.

Young was imprisoned for refusing to be conscripted.\n\nThe party suffered its first split during this period with John MacCormick leaving the party in 1942, owing to his failure to change the party's policy from supporting all out independence to [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|Home Rule]] at that year's conference in Glasgow. McCormick went on to form the [[Scottish Covenant Association]], a non-partisan political organisation campaigning for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly.\n\nHowever, wartime conditions also enabled the SNP's first parliamentary success at the [[1945 Motherwell by-election|Motherwell by-election]] in 1945, but [[Robert McIntyre]] MP lost the seat at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|general election]] three months later. The 1950s were characterised by similarly low levels of support, and this made it difficult for the party to advance. Indeed, in most general elections they were unable to put up more than a handful of candidates.\n\nThe 1960s, however, offered more electoral successes, with candidates polling credibly at [[Glasgow Bridgeton by-election, 1961|Glasgow Bridgeton]] in 1961, [[1962 West Lothian by-election|West Lothian]] in 1962 and [[1967 Glasgow Pollok by-election|Glasgow Pollok]] in 1967. Indeed, this foreshadowed [[Winnie Ewing]]'s surprise victory in [[1967 Hamilton by-election|a by-election]] at the previously safe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat of [[Hamilton (UK Parliament constituency)|Hamilton]]. This brought the SNP to national prominence, leading to the establishment of the [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)|Kilbrandon Commission]].\n\n=== Becoming a Major Force (1970s) ===\n[[File:United Kingdom general election 1974 Oct in Scotland.svg|thumb|In [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]] the SNP won 11 constituencies, a record that would stand until [[Nicola Sturgeon]] assumed the party's leadership.|350x350px]]\nDespite this breakthrough, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] was to prove a disappointment for the party as despite an increase in vote share, Ewing failed to retain her seat in Hamilton. The party did receive some consolation with the capture of the [[Western Isles (UK Parliament constituency)|Western Isles]], making [[Donald Stewart (MP)|Donald Stewart]] the party's only MP. This was to be the case until the [[1973 Glasgow Govan by-election|1973 by-election]] at [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] where a hitherto safe Labour seat was claimed by [[Margo MacDonald]].\n\n1974 was to prove something of an [[annus mirabilis]] for the party as it deployed its highly effective ''[[It's Scotland's oil]]'' campaign.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4241-dilemmas-of-over-development-scottish-nationalism-and-the-future-of-the-union|title=Dilemmas of Over-Development: Scottish Nationalism and the Future of the Union|website=Versobooks.com|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> The SNP gained 6 seats at the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February general election]] before hitting a high point in the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October re-run]], polling almost a third of all votes in Scotland and returning 11 MPs to Westminster. Furthermore, during that year's [[1974 Scottish local elections|local elections]] the party claimed overall control of [[Cumbernauld and Kilsyth]]. \n\nThis success was to continue for much of the decade, and at the [[1977 Scottish local elections|1977 district elections]] the SNP saw victories at councils including [[East Kilbride (district)|East Kilbride]] and [[Falkirk Council|Falkirk]] and held the balance of power in [[1977 Glasgow City District Council election|Glasgow]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Faux|first=Ronald|url=|title=Labour lose control of Glasgow|date=4 May 1977|work=The Times, p. 1|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> However, this level of support was not to last and by 1978 Labour revival was evident at three by-elections ([[1978 Glasgow Garscadden by-election|Glasgow Garscadden]], [[1978 Hamilton by-election|Hamilton]] and [[1978 Berwick and East Lothian by-election|Berwick and East Lothian]]) as well as the [[1978 Scottish regional elections|regional elections]].\n\nThis was to culminate when the party experienced a large drop in its support at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], precipitated by the party [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|bringing down]] the incumbent Labour minority government following the controversial failure of that year's [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|devolution referendum]]. Reduced to just 2 MPs, the successes of October 1974 were not to be surpassed until the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]].\n\n=== Factional Divisions and Infighting (1980s) ===\n[[File:Scottish National Party 79 Group Logo.svg|left|thumb|112x112px|The [[79 Group]] sought to define the party on the [[Left-wing politics|left]]. ]]\nFollowing this defeat, a period of internal strike occurred within the party, culminating with the formation of two internal groups: the proto-fascist [[Siol nan Gaidheal|Siol nan Gaidhea]]<nowiki/>l<ref>{{Cite book|last=Devine, T.

Traditionalists within the party, centred around [[Winnie Ewing]], by this time an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], responded by establishing the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] which sought to ensure that the primary objective of the SNP was campaigning for independence outwith a traditional left-right orientation, despite the fact that this would have undone the work of figures such as [[William Wolfe]], who developed a clearly [[Social democracy|social democratic]] policy platform throughout the 1970s.\n\nThese events ensured the success of a leadership motion at the party's annual conference of 1982, in [[Ayr]], despite the 79 Group being bolstered by the merger of [[Jim Sillars|Jim Sillars']] [[Scottish Labour Party (1976)|Scottish Labour Party (SLP)]] although this influx of ex-SLP members further shifted the characteristics of the party leftwards. Despite this, traditionalist figure [[Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)|Gordon Wilson]] remained party leader through the electoral dissapointments of [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] and [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]], where he lost his own [[Dundee East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee East]] seat won 13 years prior. \n\nThrough this period, Sillars grew influence in the party, developing a clear socio-economic platform including ''Independence in Europe,'' reversing the SNP's previous opposition to membership of the [[European Union|then-EEC]] which had been unsuccessful in a [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]]. This position was enhanced further by Sillars reclaiming [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] in a [[1988 Glasgow Govan by-election|by-election]] in 1988. \n\nDespite this moderation, the party did not join [[Scottish Labour|Labour]], the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Scottish Greens|Greens]] as well as civil society in the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] which developed a blueprint for a devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] due to the unwillingness of the convention to discuss independence as a constitutional option.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thetarge.co.uk/article/current-affairs/0165/ex-mp-scotland-in-trouble-if-lax-on-constitution|title=Ex-MP: Scotland \u2018in trouble\u2019 if lax on constitution - The Targe|website=thetarge.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> \n\n=== First Salmond Era (1990s) ===\n[[File:Tayside Regional Council 1994.svg|thumb|181x181px|In [[1994 Tayside Regional Council election|1994]] the SNP gained control of [[Tayside]], the only time the party controlled a regional council, albeit without a majority.]]\n[[Alex Salmond]] had been elected MP for [[Banff and Buchan (UK Parliament constituency)|Banff and Buchan]] in 1987, after the re-admittance of 79 Group members, and was able to seize the party leadership after Wilson's resignation in [[1990 Scottish National Party leadership election|1990]] after a contest with [[Margaret Ewing]]. This was a surprise victory as Ewing had the backing of much of the party establishment, including Sillars and then-Party Secretary [[John Swinney]]. The defection of Labour MP [[Dick Douglas]] further evidenced the party's clear left-wing positioning, particularly regarding opposition to the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-27388579|title=Former MP Dick Douglas dies aged 82|date=2014-05-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB}}</ref> Despite this, Salmond's leadership was unable to avert a fourth successive general election disappointment in [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]] with the party reduced back from 5 to 3 MPs.\n\nThe mid-90s offered some successes for the party, with [[North East Scotland (European Parliament constituency)|North East Scotland]] being gained at the [[1994 European Parliament election|1994 European elections]] and the party securing a [[1995 Perth and Kinross by-election|by-election]] at [[Perth and Kinross (UK Parliament constituency)|Perth and Kinross]] in 1995 after a near miss at [[1994 Monklands East by-election|Monklands East]] the previous year.\n[[File:Scottish devolution referendum, 1997 Question 1 results.svg|left|thumb|The party was part of the successful [[History of Scottish devolution|devolution]] campaign in [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|1997]].]]\n1997 offered the party's most successful [[1997 United Kingdom general election|general election]] for 23 years, although in the face of the Labour landslide the party was unable to match either 1974 election.

This was also the best performance of any party in the era of proportional elections to the European Parliament in [[Scotland (European Parliament constituency)|Scotland]].

Although the party suffered a [[North East Fife (UK Parliament constituency)|loss]] to the Liberal Democrats, it gained the [[East Dunbartonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|seat]] of its then UK leader [[Jo Swinson]], along with 7 from the Conservatives and 6 from Labour.

All of the Branches within each Scottish Parliament constituency form a Constituency Association, which coordinates the work of the Branches within the constituency, coordinates the activities of the party in the constituency, and acts as a point of liaison between an MSP or MP and the party. Constituency Associations are composed of delegates from all of the Branches within the constituency.\n\nThe annual National Conference is the supreme governing body of the SNP, and is responsible for determining party policy and electing the National Executive Committee. The National Conference is composed of:\n* delegates from every Branch and Constituency Association\n* the members of the National Executive Committee\n* 15 members elected by the National Conference\n* every SNP MSP and MP (and previously MEPs)\n* a number of SNP local councillors, and\n* delegates from one of the SNP's Affiliated Organisations ([[Young Scots for Independence]], [[SNP Students]], [[SNP Trade Union Group]] and the Association of Nationalist Councillors)\n\nThe National Council serves as the SNP's governing body between National Conferences, and its decisions are binding, unless rescinded or modified by the National Conference. There are also regular meetings of the National Assembly, which provides a forum for detailed discussion of party policy by party members.\n\nThe party has an active youth wing, the [[Young Scots for Independence]], as well as a student wing, the [[Federation of Student Nationalists]]. There is also an [[SNP Trade Union Group]]. There is an independently owned monthly newspaper, ''[[The Scots Independent]]'', which is highly supportive of the party.\n\nThe SNP's leadership is vested in its National Executive Committee (NEC), which is made up of the party's elected office bearers and six elected members (voted for at conference). The SNP parliamentarians (Holyrood and Westminster) and councillors have representation on the NEC, as do the Trade Union Group, the youth wing and the student wing.\n\n===National Executive Committee===\nThe National Executive Committee is composed of:\n* President: [[Ian Hudghton]]\n* Leader: [[Nicola Sturgeon]] [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|<small>MSP</small>]] <small>([[Glasgow Southside (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Southside]])</small>\n* Depute Leader: [[Keith Brown (Scottish politician)|Keith Brown]] [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|<small>MSP</small>]] <small>([[Clackmannanshire and Dunblane (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Clackmannanshire and Dunblane]])</small>\n* National Treasurer: [[Colin Beattie]] [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|<small>MSP</small>]] <small>([[Midlothian North and Musselburgh (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Midlothian North and Musselburgh]])</small>\n* National Secretary: <small>Dr</small> Angus MacLeod\n* Business Convener: [[Kirsten Oswald]] [[Member of parliament|<small>MP</small>]] <small>([[East Renfrewshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Renfrewshire]])</small>\n* Organisation Convener: Stacy Bradley\n* Member Support Convener: Doug Daniel\n* Policy Development Convener: [[Alyn Smith]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|<small>MP</small>]] <small>([[Stirling (UK Parliament constituency)|Stirling]])</small>\n* Local Government Convener: <small>Cllr</small> Ellen Forson <small>([[Clackmannanshire South]])</small>\n* Women's Convener: <small>Cllr</small> Rhiannon Spear <small>([[Greater Pollok (ward)|Greater Pollok]])</small>\n* Equalities Convener: Fiona Robertson\n* Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic Convener: <small>Cllr</small> Graham Campbell <small>([[Springburn/Robroyston (ward)|Springburn/Robroyston]])</small>\n* Disabled Members' Convener: Morag Fulton\n* [[Tommy Sheppard]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|<small>MP</small>]] <small>([[Edinburgh East (UK Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh East]])</small>\n* [[Alison Thewliss]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|<small>MP</small>]] <small>([[Glasgow Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Central]])</small>\n* Sixteen regional representatives\n* Representatives from the Association of Nationalist Councillors and affiliated organisations\n\n===Membership===\nSince 18 September 2014 (the day of the Scottish independence referendum), party membership has more than quadrupled (from 25,642), surpassing the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and, briefly, [[Conservatives (UK)|Conservatives]] to become the second-largest political party in the United Kingdom in terms of membership.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/theSNP/status/1036557191648604160//|title=New figures show our party is now powered by 125,482 members - making @theSNP the second biggest party in the UK.|access-date=3 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190524143611/https://twitter.com/theSNP/status/1036557191648604160|archive-date=24 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> As of August 2018, the Party has 125,482 members.\n\n===European affiliation===\nThe SNP retains close links with [[Plaid Cymru]], its counterpart in [[Wales]].

Members of the 79 Group - including future party leader and [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]] - were expelled from the party. This produced a response in the shape of the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] from those who wanted the SNP to remain a \"broad church\", apart from arguments of left vs. right.

In essence, gradualists seek to advance Scotland to independence through further devolution, in a \"step-by-step\" strategy. They tend to be in the moderate left grouping, though much of the [[79 Group]] was gradualist in approach.

Young was imprisoned for refusing to be conscripted.\n\nThe party suffered its first split during this period with John MacCormick leaving the party in 1942, owing to his failure to change the party's policy from supporting all out independence to [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|Home Rule]] at that year's conference in Glasgow. McCormick went on to form the [[Scottish Covenant Association]], a non-partisan political organisation campaigning for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly.\n\nHowever, wartime conditions also enabled the SNP's first parliamentary success at the [[1945 Motherwell by-election|Motherwell by-election]] in 1945, but [[Robert McIntyre]] MP lost the seat at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|general election]] three months later. The 1950s were characterised by similarly low levels of support, and this made it difficult for the party to advance. Indeed, in most general elections they were unable to put up more than a handful of candidates.\n\nThe 1960s, however, offered more electoral successes, with candidates polling credibly at [[Glasgow Bridgeton by-election, 1961|Glasgow Bridgeton]] in 1961, [[1962 West Lothian by-election|West Lothian]] in 1962 and [[1967 Glasgow Pollok by-election|Glasgow Pollok]] in 1967. Indeed, this foreshadowed [[Winnie Ewing]]'s surprise victory in [[1967 Hamilton by-election|a by-election]] at the previously safe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat of [[Hamilton (UK Parliament constituency)|Hamilton]]. This brought the SNP to national prominence, leading to the establishment of the [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)|Kilbrandon Commission]].\n\n=== Becoming a Major Force (1970s) ===\n[[File:United Kingdom general election 1974 Oct in Scotland.svg|thumb|In [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]] the SNP won 11 constituencies, a record that would stand until [[Nicola Sturgeon]] assumed the party's leadership.|350x350px]]\nDespite this breakthrough, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] was to prove a disappointment for the party as despite an increase in vote share, Ewing failed to retain her seat in Hamilton. The party did receive some consolation with the capture of the [[Western Isles (UK Parliament constituency)|Western Isles]], making [[Donald Stewart (MP)|Donald Stewart]] the party's only MP. This was to be the case until the [[1973 Glasgow Govan by-election|1973 by-election]] at [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] where a hitherto safe Labour seat was claimed by [[Margo MacDonald]].\n\n1974 was to prove something of an [[annus mirabilis]] for the party as it deployed its highly effective ''[[It's Scotland's oil]]'' campaign.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4241-dilemmas-of-over-development-scottish-nationalism-and-the-future-of-the-union|title=Dilemmas of Over-Development: Scottish Nationalism and the Future of the Union|website=Versobooks.com|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> The SNP gained 6 seats at the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February general election]] before hitting a high point in the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October re-run]], polling almost a third of all votes in Scotland and returning 11 MPs to Westminster. Furthermore, during that year's [[1974 Scottish local elections|local elections]] the party claimed overall control of [[Cumbernauld and Kilsyth]]. \n\nThis success was to continue for much of the decade, and at the [[1977 Scottish local elections|1977 district elections]] the SNP saw victories at councils including [[East Kilbride (district)|East Kilbride]] and [[Falkirk Council|Falkirk]] and held the balance of power in [[1977 Glasgow City District Council election|Glasgow]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Faux|first=Ronald|url=|title=Labour lose control of Glasgow|date=4 May 1977|work=The Times, p. 1|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> However, this level of support was not to last and by 1978 Labour revival was evident at three by-elections ([[1978 Glasgow Garscadden by-election|Glasgow Garscadden]], [[1978 Hamilton by-election|Hamilton]] and [[1978 Berwick and East Lothian by-election|Berwick and East Lothian]]) as well as the [[1978 Scottish regional elections|regional elections]].\n\nThis was to culminate when the party experienced a large drop in its support at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], precipitated by the party [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|bringing down]] the incumbent Labour minority government following the controversial failure of that year's [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|devolution referendum]]. Reduced to just 2 MPs, the successes of October 1974 were not to be surpassed until the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]].\n\n=== Factional Divisions and Infighting (1980s) ===\n[[File:Scottish National Party 79 Group Logo.svg|left|thumb|112x112px|The [[79 Group]] sought to define the party on the [[Left-wing politics|left]]. ]]\nFollowing this defeat, a period of internal strike occurred within the party, culminating with the formation of two internal groups: the proto-fascist [[Siol nan Gaidheal|Siol nan Gaidhea]]<nowiki/>l<ref>{{Cite book|last=Devine, T. M. (Thomas Martin)|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1004568536|title=The Scottish nation : a modern history|isbn=978-0-7181-9673-8|location=London|oclc=1004568536}}</ref> and left-wing [[79 Group]]. Traditionalists within the party, centred around [[Winnie Ewing]], by this time an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], responded by establishing the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] which sought to ensure that the primary objective of the SNP was campaigning for independence outwith a traditional left-right orientation, despite the fact that this would have undone the work of figures such as [[William Wolfe]], who developed a clearly [[Social democracy|social democratic]] policy platform throughout the 1970s.\n\nThese events ensured the success of a leadership motion at the party's annual conference of 1982, in [[Ayr]], despite the 79 Group being bolstered by the merger of [[Jim Sillars|Jim Sillars']] [[Scottish Labour Party (1976)|Scottish Labour Party (SLP)]] although this influx of ex-SLP members further shifted the characteristics of the party leftwards. Despite this, traditionalist figure [[Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)|Gordon Wilson]] remained party leader through the electoral dissapointments of [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] and [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]], where he lost his own [[Dundee East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee East]] seat won 13 years prior. \n\nThrough this period, Sillars grew influence in the party, developing a clear socio-economic platform including ''Independence in Europe,'' reversing the SNP's previous opposition to membership of the [[European Union|then-EEC]] which had been unsuccessful in a [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]]. This position was enhanced further by Sillars reclaiming [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] in a [[1988 Glasgow Govan by-election|by-election]] in 1988. \n\nDespite this moderation, the party did not join [[Scottish Labour|Labour]], the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Scottish Greens|Greens]] as well as civil society in the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] which developed a blueprint for a devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] due to the unwillingness of the convention to discuss independence as a constitutional option.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thetarge.co.uk/article/current-affairs/0165/ex-mp-scotland-in-trouble-if-lax-on-constitution|title=Ex-MP: Scotland \u2018in trouble\u2019 if lax on constitution - The Targe|website=thetarge.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> \n\n=== First Salmond Era (1990s) ===\n[[File:Tayside Regional Council 1994.svg|thumb|181x181px|In [[1994 Tayside Regional Council election|1994]] the SNP gained control of [[Tayside]], the only time the party controlled a regional council, albeit without a majority.]]\n[[Alex Salmond]] had been elected MP for [[Banff and Buchan (UK Parliament constituency)|Banff and Buchan]] in 1987, after the re-admittance of 79 Group members, and was able to seize the party leadership after Wilson's resignation in [[1990 Scottish National Party leadership election|1990]] after a contest with [[Margaret Ewing]]. This was a surprise victory as Ewing had the backing of much of the party establishment, including Sillars and then-Party Secretary [[John Swinney]]. The defection of Labour MP [[Dick Douglas]] further evidenced the party's clear left-wing positioning, particularly regarding opposition to the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-27388579|title=Former MP Dick Douglas dies aged 82|date=2014-05-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB}}</ref> Despite this, Salmond's leadership was unable to avert a fourth successive general election disappointment in [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]] with the party reduced back from 5 to 3 MPs.\n\nThe mid-90s offered some successes for the party, with [[North East Scotland (European Parliament constituency)|North East Scotland]] being gained at the [[1994 European Parliament election|1994 European elections]] and the party securing a [[1995 Perth and Kinross by-election|by-election]] at [[Perth and Kinross (UK Parliament constituency)|Perth and Kinross]] in 1995 after a near miss at [[1994 Monklands East by-election|Monklands East]] the previous year.\n[[File:Scottish devolution referendum, 1997 Question 1 results.svg|left|thumb|The party was part of the successful [[History of Scottish devolution|devolution]] campaign in [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|1997]].]]\n1997 offered the party's most successful [[1997 United Kingdom general election|general election]] for 23 years, although in the face of the Labour landslide the party was unable to match either 1974 election.

There is also an [[SNP Trade Union Group]]. There is an independently owned monthly newspaper, ''[[The Scots Independent]]'', which is highly supportive of the party.\n\nThe SNP's leadership is vested in its National Executive Committee (NEC), which is made up of the party's elected office bearers and six elected members (voted for at conference).

This policy was followed in 1963 by a motion opposed to [[nuclear weapon]]s: a policy that has remained in place ever since.<ref name=\"Mitchell19961994\">{{cite book|author=James Mitchell|title=Strategies for Self-government: The Campaigns for a Scottish Parliament|year=1996|publisher=Polygon|page=194}}</ref> The 1964 policy document, ''SNP & You'', contained a clear centre-left policy platform, including commitments to [[full employment]], government intervention in fuel, power and transport, a state bank to guide economic development, encouragement of [[cooperative]]s and [[credit union]]s, extensive building of [[council house]]s (social housing) by central and local government, pensions adjusted to cost of living, a [[minimum wage]] and an improved [[NHS Scotland|national health service]].<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\nThe 1960s also saw the beginnings of the SNP's efforts to establish an industrial organisation and mobilise amongst trade unionists in Scotland, with the establishment of the SNP Trade Union Group, and identifying the SNP with industrial campaigns, such as the [[Upper-Clyde Shipbuilders Work-in]] and the attempt of the workers at the Scottish ''[[Daily Express]]'' to run as a co-operative.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/> For the party manifestos for the two 1974 general elections, the SNP finally self-identified as a social democratic party, and proposed a range of social democratic policies.<ref name=\"Brand199027\">{{cite book|title=\u2018Scotland\u2019, in Watson, Michael (ed.), Contemporary Minority Nationalism|publisher=Routledge|year=1990|page=27|author=Jack Brand}}</ref><ref name=\"Hassan2009121\">{{cite book|author=Gerry Hassan|title=The Modern SNP: From Protest to Power|year=2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|page=121}}</ref> There was also an unsuccessful proposal at the 1975 party conference to rename the party as the ''Scottish National Party (Social Democrats)''.<ref name=\"Hepburn2013143\">{{cite book|author=Eve Hepburn|title=New Challenges for Stateless Nationalist and Regionalist Parties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dTOOAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA143|date=18 October 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-96596-1|page=143|access-date=25 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503092815/https://books.google.com/books?id=dTOOAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA143|archive-date=3 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In the UK wide referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the European Economic Community (EEC) in the same year as the aforementioned attempted name change, the SNP campaigned for Britain to leave the EEC.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Devenney|first=Andrew D.|date=2008|title=Regional Resistance to European Integration: The Case of the Scottish National Party, 1961-1972|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20762312|journal=Historical Social Research / Historische Sozialforschung|volume=33|issue=3 (125)|pages=319\u2013345|issn=0172-6404}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37107148|title=The dilemma facing Scotland's Eurosceptic nationalists|last=Ley|first=Shaun|date=2016-08-18|access-date=2020-01-12|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nThere were further ideological and internal struggles after 1979, with the [[79 Group]] attempting to move the SNP further to the left, away from being what could be described a \"social-democratic\" party, to an expressly \"[[socialism|socialist]]\" party. Members of the 79 Group - including future party leader and [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]] - were expelled from the party. This produced a response in the shape of the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] from those who wanted the SNP to remain a \"broad church\", apart from arguments of left vs. right. The 1980s saw the SNP further define itself as a party of the political left, such as campaigning against the introduction of the [[community charge|poll tax]] in Scotland in 1989; one year before the tax was imposed on the rest of the UK.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\nIdeological tensions inside the SNP are further complicated by arguments between the so-called [[SNP gradualist]]s and [[SNP fundamentalist]]s. In essence, gradualists seek to advance Scotland to independence through further devolution, in a \"step-by-step\" strategy. They tend to be in the moderate left grouping, though much of the [[79 Group]] was gradualist in approach. However, this 79 Group gradualism was as much a reaction against the fundamentalists of the day, many of whom believed the SNP should not take a clear left or right position.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\n===Economic Policy===\n[[File:Revenue Scotland logo.png|left|thumb|The [[First Sturgeon government|Sturgeon Government]] created [[Revenue Scotland]] in 2015.]]\nWith the SNP's policy base being mostly in the mainstream Western European [[social democracy|social democratic]] tradition, the party is committed to polices such as [[progressive tax|progressive personal taxation]].

Among the victims were the [[President of Poland]] [[Lech Kaczy\u0144ski]] and his wife [[Maria Kaczy\u0144ska|Maria]], the former [[Polish government-in-exile|President of Poland in exile]] [[Ryszard Kaczorowski]], the chief of the [[Polish General Staff]] and other senior [[Polish military]] officers, the president of the [[National Bank of Poland]], [[Polish Government]] officials, 18 members of the [[Polish Parliament]], senior members of the Polish clergy and relatives of victims of the [[Katyn massacre]]. The group was arriving from [[Warsaw]] to attend an event commemorating the 70th anniversary of the massacre, which took place not far from Smolensk.\n\nThe pilots were attempting to land at [[Smolensk North Airport]]\u2014a former military airbase\u2014in thick fog, with visibility reduced to about {{convert|500|m|ft}}. The aircraft descended far below the normal approach path until it struck trees, rolled inverted and crashed into the ground, coming to rest in a wooded area a short distance from the runway.<ref name=\"final_polish_report\"/>\n\nBoth the Russian and Polish official investigations found no technical faults with the aircraft, and concluded that the crew failed to conduct the approach in a safe manner in the given weather conditions. The Polish authorities found serious deficiencies in the organization and training of the Air Force unit involved, which was subsequently disbanded. Several high-ranking members of the Polish military resigned, under pressure from politicians and the media.\n\nVarious [[conspiracy theories]] about the crash have since been in circulation, and are promoted by [[Law and Justice]]'s leaders [[Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski]] (twin brother to Polish President Lech Kaczy\u0144ski) and his deputy, [[Antoni Macierewicz]], who claim the crash was a political assassination. Polish and international investigations did not find any evidence supporting this claim.<ref name=\"final_polish_report\"/>\n\n==Background==\n\n===Purpose of the flight===\nThe flight's purpose was taking many high-ranking Polish officials to ceremonies marking the 70th anniversary of the [[Katyn massacre]], a mass murder of Polish intellectuals, politicians, and military officers by the Soviets during World War II. The site of the massacre is approximately {{convert|19|km|abbr=on}} west of Smolensk. The area is fairly remote; Smolensk is the only city nearby and has the only two airports in the area: [[Smolensk North Airport]], where the accident occurred, and [[Smolensk South Airport]].\n\n===Destination airport===\n[[File:Tu-154-crash-in-smolensk-20100410-08.jpg|thumb|Russian servicemen, accompanied by a policeman, twist bulbs into the approach lights of Smolensk North Airport's runway, hours after the crash of the Tu-154]]\n[[Smolensk North Airport]] is a former military airbase, presently in mixed military-civilian use. At the time of the crash, the airport was not equipped with an [[ICAO]]-compliant [[instrument landing system]] (ILS), the standard system used in most developed countries. The airport used to have a Russian-made landing system installed, which was decommissioned after civilian operations started.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The Polish Tu-154 was modified to use western-style ILS.<ref name=\"RT-1\"/> A [[non-directional beacon]] (NDB) was installed at the airport,<ref name=\"Charles Bremner&nbsp;\u2013 Times Online&nbsp;\u2013 WBLG: The Polish crash: looking for answers\"/> but such a device is essentially a [[navigational aid]], and can be used only for [[non-precision approach]]es, where it can guide the pilot to align with the runway, but offers no vertical guidance on how to descend towards the runway.<ref name=\"Gazeta\"/> The airport was equipped also with both a [[Surveillance radar approach|surveillance]] and landing [[radar]].<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The lowest approved visibility conditions to land (approach minimums) were cloud base {{convert|100|m|sp=us}} and visibility {{convert|1000|m|sp=us}}.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\nThe ground visual navigation aids on 10 April 2010 were not effective. According to the Polish report, the radar was unstable and swung within \u00b110%.<ref name=\"komisja.smolensk.gov.pl\"/> From the photographic documentation of the Polish committee, it appears that the origin of components of the Smolensk North lighting system was unknown. This was not the Luch-2MU system as the Russians stated. The report from the inspection flight performed on 15 April 2010 stated that the approach lamps, depending on their location and on the altitude of an inbound aircraft, can be shaded by surrounding trees and shrubs when an aircraft is at a distance of 400, 700, and 800 metres from Runway 26. The lamps of the first group (900 m) had their light filters shattered and, of three bulbs installed, only one was serviceable.<ref name=\"komisja.smolensk.gov.pl\"/>\n\n===Aircraft===\n[[File:Polish Air Force Tupolev Tu-154 Dmitry Karpezo-2.jpg|thumb|''PLF 101'', the aircraft involved in the accident, seen at [[Boryspil International Airport]] in 2008]]\nThe aircraft was a [[Tupolev Tu-154M]] of the [[36th Special Aviation Regiment]] of the [[Polish Air Force]] (Si\u0142y Powietrzne), tail number 101. Built in 1990 at the [[Aviakor|Kuybyshev Aviation Plant]] as [[manufacturer's serial number|msn]] 90A837, it first flew on 29 June 1990. At the time of the accident, the airframe had accumulated more than 5,150 hours in 4,000 cycles. The service life of the Tu-154M is more than 25 years or 30,000 hours or 15,000 cycles (whichever comes first). All three [[Soloviev]] [[Soloviev D-30|D-30KU-154]] engines were within the service limits of 24,000 hours or 11,100 cycles.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\n\"101\" was one of two Tupolev Tu-154s that served as [[Air transports of heads of state and government|official government jets]]; the other with a tail number of 102 was a year younger and at the time of the accident it was being overhauled in the [[Aviakor]] aviation plant in [[Samara, Russia]]. The \"101\" aircraft had undergone a major overhaul in December 2009, and Alexey Gusev, the head of the maintenance plant that carried out the work, told Polish TV that it should not have had technical problems.<ref name=\"bbctupolev\"/> The crash happened 138 flight hours after the most recent overhaul.<ref name=\"altair\"/>\n\nThe aircraft used the [[callsign]] ''PLF 101''. PLF is the [[ICAO]] [[Airline codes|three-letter designator]] for the Polish Air Force used to identify the operator of an aircraft by air traffic control.\n\n=== Crew ===\nThe cockpit crew consisted of pilot Captain [[Arkadiusz Protasiuk]], co-pilot Major [[Robert Grzywna]], navigator Lieutenant [[Artur Zi\u0119tek]] and flight engineer WO2 Andrzej Michalak.  Protasiuk had landed at Smolensk three days earlier on 7 April in the same Tu-154; he served as first officer on that flight.<ref name=\"Final Report\" /> Protasiuk had 3,531 flight hours, including 2,906 hours on the Tu-154. Co-pilot Grzywna had 1,909 hours, with 475 of them on the Tu-154. Zi\u0119tek had 1,050 hours, only 58 of them on the Tu-154. Michalak had only 329 hours, all on the Tu-154.<ref name=\"Final Report\" />\n\n==Flight sequence==\n\n===Take-off and cruise===\n[[File:2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash map-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Map of the origin and destination of the accident flight]]\n''PLF 101''<ref name=\"PLF\"/> took off from Warsaw at 9:27 Smolensk time after a delay of 27 minutes.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\nAs the aircraft left Warsaw, weather conditions were rapidly deteriorating at Smolensk. A [[Inversion (meteorology)|temperature inversion]] had developed, trapping moisture low in the atmosphere and causing a dense fog to develop.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> At 9:15 Smolensk time, about an hour and a half before the crash, a [[Yakovlev Yak-40]] jet (flight PLF 031)<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> also belonging to the Polish government<ref name=\"gazeta\"/> and carrying Polish journalists from the President's [[News media|press pool]] landed at the airbase without incident, though conditions were rapidly worsening at the time.<ref name=\"rt_journalists\"/> Shortly thereafter, between 9:20 and 9:39 MSD, a Russian [[Ilyushin Il-76]] (tail number 78817) made two attempts to land,<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> but because of low visibility, it diverted to [[Vnukovo International Airport|Vnukovo Airport]] near Moscow.<ref name=\"smol\"/> Upon ''PLF 101'''s<ref name=\"PLF\"/> approach to the base, atmospheric conditions continued to worsen, and the fog continued to thicken, further reducing visibility to {{convert|400|m|ft}}.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The ground control personnel stated to ''PLF 101''<ref name=\"PLF\"/> that there were no conditions for landing.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The Captain then requested and was given permission to conduct a \"trial\" approach.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The controllers instructed the captain as to the landing minimum of {{convert|100|m|ft}}, to which the captain replied, \"Yes, sir!\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\n===Stress and workload factors===\nMeanwhile, the situation in the cockpit was one of very high stress.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> As the weather continued to worsen, the crew became increasingly aware of the extreme difficulty they would encounter in landing at Smolensk. The crew may have feared a negative reaction from their passengers should they have to divert to an alternative airfield.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The protocol director was present in the cockpit from time to time, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Air Force was present in the cockpit{{check|date=October 2016}} for the final approach phase of the flight, including the crash itself.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{Update inline|date=October 2016}}<!-- Subsequent investigation claims voice of CinC was misidentified on CVR --> At one point, the navigator is heard on the CVR saying \"He'll go crazy\", a possible reference to the President of Poland, had the crew chosen to divert.<ref>{{cite news|title=He'll Go Crazy: Cockpit audio sheds light on Polish plane crash|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNyHemI4hKs|accessdate=21 November 2015|work=RT|publisher=Autonomous Nonprofit Organization \"TV-Novosti\"|date=12 January 2011}}</ref> There may also have been some friction between the Air Force Commander and the captain, caused by an absence of the latter from condition training.<ref name=\"polityka\"/>\n\nThe captain and first officer's decision making may have also been affected by knowledge of a 2008 flight when the President of Poland ordered a change in destination right before departure and again while airborne. The captain and first officer had been the first officer and navigator, respectively, on that flight. Lacking charts or a flight plan for the new destination, the captain of that flight had decided he could not bring the aircraft to the new destination safely. Disobeying the President and a high-ranking Polish Air Force commander on board, the captain flew on to the originally planned destination. The Polish prosecutor's office would later clear that captain of any wrongdoing in relation to that flight, and he was even awarded a silver medal of merit for national defense.<ref name=\"Tbilisi Captain flies to New York\"/> However, in the final report issued by MAK ([[The Interstate Aviation Committee]]; Russian: \u041c\u0435\u0436\u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u0432\u0438\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442, \u041c\u0410\u041a) \u2013 a supervising body overseeing the use and management of civil aviation in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS), it was stated he had not been assigned to fly the President since,<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> though Polish sources note he flew the President to New York in September 2008, despite objections from the President.<ref name=\"Tbilisi Captain flies to New York\"/> The captain involved in the 2008 incident flew the Polish Prime Minister to Smolensk on 7 April without the President on board, but he was removed from the crew of the 10 April flight which carried the President.<ref name=\"dziennik\"/> Knowledge of the 2008 incident and its repercussions may have weighed on the crew of ''PLF 101'',<ref name=\"PLF\"/> potentially placing additional pressure on them to complete their flight to the original destination.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\nComplicating the situation was the increased workload on the captain. Normally, one pilot flies the airplane while another crew member handles radio communications. On ''PLF 101'',<ref name=\"PLF\"/> the responsibility for communication usually rests with the navigator. At Smolensk however the situation was different. As the airport is not usually open for international flights and is not ICAO certified, the air traffic controllers were not required to be fluent in English, the ICAO standard language for ATC communication. As such, all communication between Smolensk ATC and ''PLF 101''<ref name=\"PLF\"/> was carried out in Russian. Russian law requires international flights landing at military airports to have a Russian \"Leaderman\" (navigator; [[Russian language|Russian]] lidirovshik) on board the flight, who is then responsible for all ATC communication, which is done in Russian.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> In the middle of March, as part of their request for permission to conduct the flight, Poland asked for \"Leaderman\" services and the latest airport data for Smolensk. At the end of March, after apparently receiving no reply to their first request, Poland tendered a second request for permission to fly, but did not request \"Leaderman\" services. As a spokesperson for the Air Force Command said: \"The Russian side has not confirmed readiness to secure the flight leader\".<ref name=\"Pu\u0142k chcia\u0142, by rosyjski nawigator lecia\u0142 Tu-154\"/><ref name=\"Piloci prosili o rosyjskiego nawigatora do Tu-154\"/> According to the Final Report, Russia did offer \"Leaderman\" services, but Poland refused, stating their crew had satisfactory knowledge of Russian and could conduct the flight without the Leaderman.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> In reality, the captain was the only member of the crew who could speak adequate Russian.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> Therefore, upon being handed off (transferred) to Smolensk ATC, the captain took over communication duties from the navigator. In a normal situation, this would dictate that the first officer be the pilot actually flying the airplane, but as the weather was bad the captain, as the most experienced member of the crew, elected to fly the airplane as well.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> Therefore, the captain was performing two tasks simultaneously which are usually split up, increasing his workload and requiring him to divide his attention.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\n===Approach===\n[[File:Polish Air Force Tupolev Tu-154M Lebeda.jpg|thumb|''PLF 101'' landing at [[Prague Airport]] less than two days before the accident]]\nUnder these stresses, the crew continued their approach pattern and readied the aircraft for final descent. Radios were tuned to the two Non-Directional Beacons (NDBs) present at the field, and the [[autopilot]] was set up to use [[waypoint]]s from the [[Flight Management System]] (FMS) units for navigation. The crew used their second radio to contact the Yak-40 which had landed earlier, inquiring as to the weather conditions. The Yak-40 crew replied, \"Well, generally it's absolute shit here,\" and that, \"(we) were lucky to land at the last moment.\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The Yak-40 crew estimated visibility was {{convert|200|m|ft}}, but told ''PLF 101'',<ref name=\"PLF\"/> \"you might try...(to make an approach).\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The crew of ''PLF 101'' acknowledged this information and continued their approach. As the aircraft approached the outer marker, the crew issued pitch commands (via the CLIMB-DESCEND wheel) to the autopilot. This is not recommended for the Tu-154, as the autopilot cannot maintain vertical speed accurately enough for the approach phase of flight; manual flight mode is instead recommended. Although the crew had not requested it, the radar controller began issuing reports to ''PLF 101'' concerning their distance from the runway and whether or not they were on the glidepath.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The Polish report noted that on multiple occasions the radar controller stated the airplane was on the glidepath when it was not.\n\nThe [[Terrain awareness and warning system|Terrain Awareness Warning System]] (TAWS) fired its first audible warning \"terrain ahead!\" at 10:40:06. This was because the Smolensk airport, as a former military airfield not open to international flights, was not in the system's database and therefore the system did not recognize that the airplane was approaching an airport.<ref name=\"TAWS Airport data listing\"/> Six seconds later, someone (most likely the captain or navigator) pressed a button on the captain's FMS panel commanding standard barometric pressure be set on the captain's main electronic altimeter. This had the effect of increasing the altimeter's reading by {{convert|170|m|ft}}; as the TAWS takes readings from this particular altimeter, this had the additional effect of silencing the warning.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The captain's secondary (mechanical) and the copilot's main electronic pressure altimeters continued to read correctly.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> As the descent continued, the crew realized they had started descent too late. To compensate for this, they increased their vertical speed to {{convert|8|m/s|ft/s}}, twice the prescribed rate for a normal approach. The aircraft did not have enough drag to maintain speed with this rate of descent, so even though the autothrottles commanded idle power from the engines, the speed of the aircraft increased to approximately {{convert|35|km/h|0|abbr=on}} higher than specified.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\nApproaching {{convert|300|m|ft}}, the navigator began calling out the [[radar altimeter]]'s reading. This is not standard practice for a non-precision approach, as the radar altimeter does not take into account the contour of the terrain around the airport. Standard practice would entail calling out the readings on the [[pressure altimeter]], which is set according to atmospheric pressure and thereby references the elevation of the actual airport. The terrain on approach to Smolensk airport is uneven and locally much lower than the runway level.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\n===Warning signs===\nAt {{convert|200|m|ft}}, the engines were still at idle power. Power settings for jet engines are expressed in instrument readings and flight data recorders as percentages labeled as \"N1\" and \"N2\". N1 and N2 refer to the spools, or shafts, of a [[jet engine]] on which the compressor and turbine blades are mounted; jet engine power is measured as a percentage of maximum N1 or N2 rpm.<ref name=\"Airplane Flying Handbook\"/> Although the shafts are not mechanically connected, the speed of one spool can be calculated based on the speed of the other spool and atmospheric conditions.<ref name=\"Airplane Flying Handbook\"/> The Tu-154 manual indicates that a [[go-around]] must be initiated at 200 m if the engines are running at or below 75% N2.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> This is because jet engine throttle response is not linear; jet engines have to \"spool up\" in order to produce more thrust.<ref name=\"Airplane Flying Handbook\"/> At power settings higher than 78%, this response is almost instantaneous; at idle power, it can take a full 8 seconds for a jet engine to \"spool up\" to full power.<ref name=\"Airplane Flying Handbook\"/> On ''PLF 101'',<ref name=\"PLF\"/> the N2 values were not recorded by the [[flight data recorder]] (FDR). The N1 values were, and at 200 m they indicated 32\u201333% N1. 75% N2 equates to 51\u201352% N1 for the given conditions.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> As such, the engines were well below the 75% minimum N2 reading, and the crew should have initiated a [[go-around]] at this point, even though they were still above [[Decision height|Decision Height (DH)]]. However, they did not go around, and continued the descent. The Final Report would later determine that a go-around was technically possible from as low as 40 m, but that 200 m was the first of many times that the crew were required to go around, but did not.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\nAt {{convert|180|m|ft}}, the \"terrain ahead!\" warning again sounded on the flight deck. The crew continued the descent. According to MAK's report, at {{convert|100|m|ft}} (Decision Height) there was no \"landing\" or \"go-around\" call by the captain. If this happens, the first officer is supposed to overrule the captain, take control of the airplane, and initiate a go-around.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> Poland suggests that at this point the captain said \"Go around\", and 8 seconds later the first officer confirmed by saying \"go around\".<ref name=\"Polish comments to draft of Final Report\"/><ref name=\"TU154m did not land\"/><ref name=\"TU154m did not land2\"/> (only the second of these two statements is recorded in the official transcripts by MAK; the first one may have been obscured by a simultaneous report by TAWS). Despite these calls, neither pilot initiated a go-around, and the descent continued.  One second after the 100 m altitude was reached, the TAWS alert \"PULL UP\" activated and continued to sound for the remainder of the flight. \"PULL UP\" only activates when the TAWS computer believes a collision with terrain is imminent. Therefore, when \"PULL UP\" sounds, the crew is supposed to begin an immediate, maximum performance emergency climb (full power and [[angle of attack]] to the maximum permissible without [[stall (aviation)|stalling]]) and continue climbing until the warning stops.<ref name=\"ICAO TAWS Report\"/> However, the crew continued the descent.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> In a typical situation with an airport in the TAWS database, the \"PULL UP\" warning might not have sounded at this point.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} There is a method of setting up the TAWS to prevent false warnings when flying into airports not in the database, known as \"terrain inhibit\" mode; however, the crew did not utilize it.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> Even if they had, an excessive rate of descent and excessive airspeed can cause the TAWS to issue a \"SINK RATE\" warning followed by a \"PULL UP\" warning.<ref name=\"Certification of Terrain Awareness and Warning System (TAWS) Installations\"/> This point (10:40:40 local time, approximately 20 seconds before the collision with terrain) is also notable because this was the moment when the aircraft had crossed the minimum allowed approach slope for this airport (2\u00b010'). Prior to this moment, the radar controller had no reason to think that the landing attempt was not proceeding normally. The behavior of the controller was later the subject of some criticism by the Polish media. The controller remained silent for about 12 seconds after the aircraft passed the 100 m mark, and, even at that point, he did not order a go-around, but, rather issued an instruction to transit from a descent to a horizontal flight. (The decision to go around was apparently reached in the cabin of the aircraft within a few seconds of that instruction.)<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> In addition, according to some interpretations of the radio exchange between the ground and the aircraft, the crew was instructed by the ground control to descend to {{convert|120|m|ft}} and either to wait for clearance to land or request one explicitly,<ref name=\"rian\"/> or to inform the ground control regarding their decision whether to land or to go around.<ref name=\"marker\"/> (According to MAK's report, it meant that the crew was supposed to inform the ground control of their decision to land before passing the decision altitude, and that the ground control was supposed to allow the landing as long as the runway and the airspace were clear.) None of this ever happened, with the aircraft continuing the descent through the 120 m mark while the ground control remained silent. It is unknown whether the crew really understood the ground control instruction (literally, \"landing additionally, 120, 3 m\"), which was issued in Russian and used a relatively recent expression that was only codified in 2006.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nFor the next several seconds, the crew continued to call out \"100 meters\" as read from the radar altimeter. The aircraft was flying into a valley at this time and actually descended by {{convert|60\u201370|m}}.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The crew began calling out radar altitude every {{convert|10|m}}. At {{convert|60|m}} radar altitude (where the crew had set their radar altitude bugs), the First Officer called out \"Go around\" (this is the \"confirmation\" go around call referred to in the Polish comment above). Due to the terrain in the area, the aircraft was actually only {{convert|15|m}} above runway level at the time. Simultaneously to this callout, the FDR recorded a brief pull on the control column, likely done by the first officer, as he instinctively started the go-around sequence of actions. According to the investigation, this attempt at a go-around was completely overridden by the auto-pilot, which was still active, and, in any event, it was not completed (protocol requires that the correct sequence of operations during a go-around attempt involves increasing thrust to takeoff mode and disengaging the autopilot, neither action was done at the time).<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> Flight simulator testing by the investigation concluded that had the first officer completed a go-around at this point, the crash would likely have been avoided despite the violation of minimums and the excessive rate of descent.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The investigation found that this was the last moment at which a go-around could have been successful.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\n===Point of no return===\nAs the crew called out \"50 meters\", the controller instructed \"level 101\", telling the aircraft to terminate descent. At {{convert|20|m|ft}}, another controller instructed \"Check altitude, level.\" Simultaneously with this final call, the control column was pulled full aft, commanding max pitch up from the aircraft, and the throttles were moved within one second from their flight idle positions to maximum power. The aircraft, due to the valley terrain, was actually {{convert|15|m|ft}} below the runway at this time. The Russian investigation surmised that at this moment the flight crew saw the trees through the fog, and instinctively reacted in an attempt to escape their grave predicament. The crew did not disengage the autopilot, but the action of commanding maximum pitch up on the control column overpowered it, causing the pitch channel to disengage. The control column briefly moved to neutral at this point, then moved full aft and remained there for the duration of the flight.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> According to the Polish report, the command \"level\" ordering a change to horizontal flight was issued at a time when the aircraft was at an altitude of about {{convert|14|m|ft}} above airfield level. Two seconds before the \"level\" command, the aircraft commander made the decision to go around. According to the Polish committee's findings, the command to level should have been issued 10 seconds sooner, when the aircraft was well below the glide path.<ref name=\"komisja.smolensk.gov.pl\"/>\n\nSoon after, the aircraft began hitting trees. One, a large birch with a trunk {{convert|30|to|40|cm|0|abbr=on}} wide, ripped off about {{convert|6.5|m|ft}} of the left wing, including the left [[aileron]]. The resulting asymmetrical lift caused an uncommanded roll to the left. Within 5 seconds, the aircraft was inverted, hitting the ground with the left wing, followed very shortly after by the nose. The nose impact resulted in forces exceeding 100[[g-force|g]], which killed everyone on board instantly.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> Even without the birch tree and subsequent roll, the excessive [[angle of attack]] would have led to an aerodynamic [[Stall (flight)|stall]] approximately two seconds after impact with that tree, which would also have led to a fatal accident.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> According to the Polish report, safety areas around every aerodrome are mandated by international regulations (including Polish and Russian law) to prevent situations where aircraft or aerodrome operation could be compromised by obstacles in the immediate vicinity. A thorough analysis of terrain reveals that obstacles were present in the safety area, with many trees exceeding the permitted height limit (mostly about {{convert|10\u201311|m|ft}}).<ref name=\"komisja.smolensk.gov.pl\"/>\n\nAfter the nose hit, the aircraft was violently torn apart by impact forces.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The wreckage came to rest upside-down about {{convert|200|m|ft}} before the runway threshold and slightly left of its centreline. The largest pieces left were the [[wing root]]s (the strongest part of an airplane), the wingtips and the tail section. The tail section came to rest backwards, relative to the direction of flight. A small post-impact fire ensued, but was quickly brought under control by the emergency services and extinguished 18 minutes later.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\nThe [[Governor of Smolensk Oblast|Governor]] of [[Smolensk Oblast]], [[Sergey Antufyev]], confirmed that there were no survivors of the crash. Pictures from the scene showed parts of the aircraft charred and strewn through a wooded area.<ref name=\"BBC8612825\"/> The Russian Prime Minister, [[Vladimir Putin]], said that the bodies of those killed in the crash would be brought to Moscow for identification.<ref name=\"Body of Polish President recovered from crash site\"/> Kaczy\u0144ski's body was identified in Smolensk and was flown directly to [[Warsaw]] on the afternoon of 11 April.<ref name=\"President Lech Kaczy\u0144ski's body returns to Poland\"/>\n\n==Initial investigation==\nAs the accident occurred on Russian soil, Russia was tasked by [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]] procedure with primary responsibility for investigation, which it carried out with international cooperation. Poland also set up its own committee to investigate the crash, and prosecutors in both countries began criminal investigations.\n\n===Interstate Aviation Committee===\nIn the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS), the [[Interstate Aviation Committee]] (IAC) ({{lang-ru|\u041c\u0435\u0436\u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u0432\u0438\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442 (MAK)}}) oversees the use and management of civil aviation. The committee's Air Accident Investigation Commission is responsible for investigating civil aviation accidents occurring in commonwealth member nations. The committee is headquartered in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]].<ref name=\"Main Page\"/>\n\n===Immediate actions===\nWithin hours of the crash, the [[President of Russia]], [[Dmitry Medvedev]], announced the establishment of a special commission for the investigation of the accident. The commission was to be supervised by [[Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation|Prime Minister]] Vladimir Putin.<ref name=\"kremlin\"/><ref name=\"kremlin1\"/><ref name=\"lenta\"/> An Investigation Committee of the [[Prosecutor General of Russia]] started a criminal case in accordance with a \"violation of the safety rules\" of the [[Russian Criminal Code]].<ref name=\"newsru\"/>\n\n===Flight recorders===\nTwo [[flight recorder]]s, the [[cockpit voice recorder]] (CVR) and the [[flight data recorder]] (FDR), were recovered undamaged from the crash site during the afternoon/early evening of 10 April, as was confirmed by [[Sergey Shoygu]], the Russian [[Ministry of Emergency Situations (Russia)|Minister of Emergency Situations]].<ref name=\"news\"/> That evening, it was reported that the [[Cockpit voice recorder|CVR]] recordings confirmed the crew attempted to land against the advice of air traffic controllers.<ref name=\"rian2\"/> A third flight recorder, a [[Quick Access Recorder]] (QAR) designed for maintenance diagnostics, was found on 12 April.<ref name=\"lenta3\"/> The two [[Flight Management System]] (FMS) units were also recovered.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The investigation was able to obtain information from the electronic memories of the Quick Access Recorder and one of the FMS units, despite the fact that they were not designed to withstand a crash. Since the FMS units are linked together, being able to read the memory of one meant the investigation was able to determine the actions performed by both units.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> It would later be discovered that the FDR was partially defective and had occasional gaps in its data, but as the QAR managed to survive the crash, by synchronizing the data from the two units, a complete picture of flight data emerged.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\nOn the day after the crash, investigators said they had reviewed the flight recorders, and confirmed that there were no technical problems with the Soviet-built aeroplane, ruling out initial theories that the 20-year-old aircraft was at fault. Alexei Gusev, general director of the [[Aviakor]] factory, said that the aircraft's three engines had been repaired and technicians had upgraded the plane's [[avionics]] at a recent overhaul the previous year. He said that there were no doubts about the plane's airworthiness.<ref name=\"Poland mourns as President Lech Kaczy\u0144ski's body arrives home\"/>\n\n===Search for human remains===\n[[Ewa Kopacz]], former Polish Minister of Health, claimed before the [[Sejm]] that after the crash, ground was dug to a depth of one metre, and even if a tiny piece of human flesh was found, it was genetically tested. However, in the transcript released online by the Sejm, the meaning of her speech was changed: that when a small piece of flesh was found, the ground was dug to a depth of one metre. Moreover, in September 2010, one of the Polish pilgrims to Smolensk found a [[jaw]] with teeth and two other bones.<ref name=\"wpolityce\"/>\n\n===Russian cooperation===\nRussia offered full cooperation to Polish prosecutors during the investigation.<ref name=\"wyborcza_investigation\"/> According to the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC) Polish investigators in Russia have been given access to all procedures of Russian investigators. However, Edmund Klich, the head of the Polish investigative commission, said that \"Poland does not have a lot of things that (we) would like to have\" and as an example gives lack of documentation of Smolensk airport and regulations about Air Control.<ref name=\"wiadomosci.onet.pl\"/> Polish investigators do not have the authority to conduct investigative actions by themselves, but they participated on equal terms with their Russian counterparts in the interviews with people involved and other parts of the investigation. Polish officials were to secure all Polish state documents found in the wreckage, as well as electronic devices (portable computers and mobile telephones) belonging to government officials and military officers. In turn Russian investigators received from Poland materials secured after the crash, including those about the technical state of the aircraft and fitness of the pilot. The Polish investigation results were to be based in part on Russian findings, but they are not bound by the results of the Russian investigation. Preliminary results of the investigations were to be released on the Thursday after the crash (including the cockpit voice recordings), but this was postponed until after the weekend when the funeral of the Presidential couple was to take place,<ref name=\"wyborcza_investigation\"/><ref name=\"Polish pilots on Kaczynski jet 'saw crash coming'\"/> then postponed indefinitely until the full analysis was completed. The Flight Data Recorder and Cockpit Voice Recorder, both of Soviet design, were analyzed in Russia with the participation of Polish experts.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The Quick Access Recorder, designed and produced in Poland, was sent to Poland and analysed there, with the participation of Russian experts.<ref name=\"tvn0413\"/> The Flight Management System units, manufactured in the United States, were analyzed there with the participation of the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]], [[National Transportation Safety Board|NTSB]], Polish experts, and Russian experts.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\n===Airport and pilot communication===\nThe airport's traffic control communicated with the pilots in [[Russian language|Russian]], and one of the controllers claimed the Polish crew had problems communicating in this language.<ref name=\"tvn_plusnin\"/><ref name=\"RT-2\"/> However, according to Tomasz Pietrzak, the former commander of the Polish [[36th Special Aviation Regiment]], the captain of ''PLF 101''<ref name=\"PLF\"/> was fluent in Russian and English.<ref name=\"tvn_plusnin\"/><ref name=\"RT-2\"/> The Captain had landed in Smolensk three days before the crash, when he was part of the crew bringing Polish Prime Minister [[Donald Tusk]] to the 7 April ceremony, and at the time no communication problems with ground control were reported.<ref name=\"gazeta_ru\"/> However, while the captain knew Russian, the rest of the crew did not, in particular the navigator whose task it is to communicate with the ground,<ref name=\"kto niechcial\"/> thus placing an additional workload on the captain. Previous flights to Smolensk had been accompanied by a Russian navigator, but none was provided for the April 2010 flights, with differing reasons for this given by Polish and Russian sides.<ref name=\"kto niechcial\"/> The final accident report would later conclude that the captain's knowledge of Russian was \"satisfactory.\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\nThe airport, which normally should have been closed due to the severe conditions, was not declared closed as its management feared that this could cause a diplomatic incident.<ref name=\"Wszyscy jeste\u015bmy winni tej tragedii\"/> According to the news agency Interfax, the pilot was told that Smolensk North Airport was enveloped in thick fog and strongly advised against landing, but still he decided to continue with the original flight plan and attempt a landing.<ref name=\"guardian1\"/> According to an interview with a flight controller Pavel Plusnin<ref name=\"lifenews-ru_interview\"/> it was suggested to the pilot that he land at an alternative airfield in Moscow or [[Minsk]]. According to Plusnin, the pilot said, that he would attempt one approach, and if landing was not possible, he would then divert to another airfield.<ref name=\"tvn_plusnin\"/>\n\nThere was some concern in the press as to whether or not Russian military ATC had the authority to issue military orders to ''PLF 101'',<ref name=\"PLF\"/> as the aircraft was a military flight. Under Russian law, military flights are under the control of Russian military ATC, and permission or denial for approach and landing must be given by the controller prior to these actions being undertaken by a flight crew.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The final accident report determined that, as a foreign military aircraft, Russian controllers did not have the authority to issue military orders to ''PLF 101'', and this had been communicated to the ATC personnel who handled the flight.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The \"trial\" approach was conducted with the understanding by ATC that all risk for such an approach was to be undertaken by ''PLF 101'' and not ATC.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\n===Theft from victims===\nOn 6 June 2010, it was reported that payments worth [[Euro|\u20ac]]1,400 had been made from a credit card found on the body of historian [[Andrzej Przewo\u017anik]], one of the victims of the crash. Credit cards belonging to the politician [[Aleksandra Natalli-\u015awiat]] were also missing, but not used in transactions.<ref name=\"thenews1\"/> On 8 June 2010, [[Information Telegraph Agency of Russia|ITAR-TASS]] reported that four soldiers of ''Unit 06755'' had been charged in connection with the theft, after being found in possession of three credit cards used to withdraw a total of 60,345 [[Russian Ruble|rubles]].<ref name=\"itar_tass\"/> A Polish spokesperson said that the first withdrawals using the cards had been made around two hours after the crash.<ref name=\"bbc_cards\"/> The Polish government admitted that the Russian soldiers involved in the theft were probably conscripts, and that earlier reports blaming members of Russia's [[OMON]] forces for the theft had been a mistake.<ref name=\"thenews2\"/>\n\n===Initial reports===\nAn initial report by [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]]' [[Interstate Aviation Committee]] ({{lang-ru|\u041c\u0435\u0436\u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u0432\u0438\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442 (MAK)}}) revealed that all three engines were operating normally, and that there was no fire or explosion before the aircraft crashed.<ref name=\"AH429ec5fa\"/> According to the newspaper Dziennik, Polish flight recorder ATM-[[Quick access recorder|QAR]] registered that precisely at 8:41:02.5 (Polish time) the tail of the aircraft separated. All systems of Tu-154 stopped working at 8:41:04. Fuel temperature was below {{convert|0|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Engines when the aircraft was above the road were at 60% of their nominal power (Tu-154 needs about 10 seconds to get 100% of power from engines). They also determined that the aircraft was {{convert|40|m|ft}} lower than it should have been.<ref name=\"dziennik4\"/>\n\nThe discrepancy among the time of the crash registered by MARS flight recorders (10:41:05.4), ATM-QAR recorder (10:41:04), and when electricity lines were cut by the crashing aircraft a second or two before the final crash (10:39:35) was never explained.<ref name=\"cables\"/>\n\nOn 19 May 2010, the preliminary report of the investigation into the crash was published. Alexei Morozov, the head of the technical commission of Russia's Interstate Aviation Committee, stated that the Tupolev Tu-154M had no mechanical faults, and that an air traffic control official at Smolensk North Airport had \"warned twice that visibility was 400 metres (1,312ft) and that were no conditions for landing\". The investigation ruled out a terrorist attack, explosion or fire on board the aircraft as the cause of the crash. It was also reported that the voices of two non-crew members were heard in the cockpit during the period leading up to the crash. One of the voices was identified by sources as the Polish Air Force Commander, Lieutenant General [[Andrzej B\u0142asik]].<ref name=\"bbc report\"/><ref name=\"boston globe\"/> However, according to the findings of the Polish prosecutor's office in January 2013, General B\u0142asik had not stayed in the cockpit and was a regular passenger.<ref name=\"wp\"/> The other voice was later identified as the Director of Protocol.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\nAccording to the Interstate Aviation Committee report from 19 May 2010, the aircraft first hit an {{convert|11|m|ft|adj=mid}} tree approximately {{convert|1100|m|ft|0|abbr=out}} from the runway. The aircraft was also off by {{convert|40|m|ft}} from the extended middle line of the runway. The [[Terrain awareness and warning system|TAWS]] alarm \"Pull up!\" was first sounded at {{convert|100|m|ft|0|abbr=out}}  altitude and then repeated several times before the crash. It was first sounded 18 seconds before hitting the tree and the crew attempted to abort landing 13 seconds later. Due to geographical relief the aircraft was actually {{convert|15|m|ft|0|abbr=out}}  below the runway at the time of the first impact.<ref name=\"MAK\"/>\n\nOn 26 May 2010, it was reported<ref name=\"rt-concl\"/> that [[pilot error]] had been identified as the reason for the crash. Edmund Klich, the head of the Polish investigative commission, stated in an interview \"Pretty much everything is clear right now and nearly all evidence has been gathered\". \"The pilots ignored the plane's automatic warnings and attempted an incredibly risky landing,\" Klich said.<ref name=\"rt-concl\"/> According to the report, the crew of the Tupolev Tu-154M failed to respond for 13 seconds when the plane's \"terrain approaching\" alarm warned that the aircraft was less than {{convert|100|m|ft}} from the ground. The aircraft attempted to pull up after hitting a {{convert|5|m|ft|adj=mid|-tall|spell=in}} [[birch]] tree, but part of the left wing had been sheared off in the impact. The aircraft then went into a roll before landing on its back and disintegrating five seconds later. Edmund Klich declined to speculate on whether the pilot had been placed under pressure to land, commenting, \"Psychologists will have to assess the stress levels the pilots were subjected to.\"<ref name=\"wsj2\"/>\n\nOn 1 June 2010, Poland's Interior Ministry published a transcript from the cockpit voice recorder of the crashed Tu-154M.<ref name=\"RT-recording\"/> The transcript confirmed earlier reports that the aircraft had attempted to land in bad weather against the advice of air traffic control and the plane's terrain awareness warning system.<ref name=\"krakow post\"/> At one point in the recording, [[Mariusz Kazana]], the Director of Diplomatic Protocol in the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Poland|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], enters the cockpit and was told by the pilot \"Sir, the fog is increasing. At the moment, under these conditions that we have now, we will not manage to land\" to which Kazana replies \"Well, then we have a problem.\"<ref name=\"pa news\"/>\n\nExpert commentators have noted that the flight navigator, who was listing the altitude readings on the transcript, was referring to the radar [[altimeter]] (which gives height above ground) rather than the pressure altimeter (which would provide the height relative to the level of the runway).<ref name=\"gazeta5\"/> Because the terrain rises up to the runway, this could have had the effect of causing the pilot to fly far too low. The Final Report confirms this is exactly what happened.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\nThe Russian report was published on 12 January 2011, and the Polish report was published on 29 July 2011. Both reports placed the majority of the blame for the accident on the pilots for descending too low without being able to see the ground. The Polish report also placed harsh criticism on the organization of Poland's special aviation regiment and its leaders, as well as finding deficiencies in the performance of the Russian air traffic controllers and in the airport's lighting and approach area. In Polish discourse, there remained wider questions and unease about the potential causes of the crash.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.pl/1/9/Artykul/130720,Opposition-party-welcomes-reopened-Smolensk-disaster-probe|title=Opposition party welcomes reopened Smolensk disaster probe|work=Polskie Radio dla Zagranicy|accessdate=3 August 2015}}</ref> This prompted a Warsaw court and a separate military investigation.

A copy of the report was sent to the Polish authorities, who had 60 days to comment, after which the report was published on 12 January 2011.<ref name=AH429ec5fa/>\n\nAfter the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC) report's publication, Poland stated that it was created in violation of Annex 13 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation because some requested documents or evidences were not provided by Russia<ref name=\"wiadomosci.onet.pl\"/><ref name=\"Onet.pl\"/> and, according to a Polish lawyer, because Polish comments to the final report were not agreed to nor fully applied.<ref name=\"onet\"/>\n\nThe final report noticed that the captain's [[electronic altimeter]] was set {{convert|170|m|ft}} higher than the actual position. This change was made after the aircraft began its final approach and soon after the first TAWS warning sounded.  All other altimeters on board were set correctly. The investigation also determined that the controller's radar screen was not calibrated correctly and showed the airplane as being {{convert|90\u2013150|m|ft}} closer to the runway than it actually was. Additionally, his radio calls to the crew regarding their distance to the runway were given in advance by an average of {{convert|500|m|ft}}.<ref name=\"Appendixes for MAK report\"/>\n\nAs part of their investigation, MAK conducted an experiment in a Tu-154M simulator to determine how late the crew could have gone around. \"The experiment confirmed that during approaches in conditions similar to the flight conditions of the T-154M ... with a similar flight profile with vertical speed of descent of 7\u20138&nbsp;m/s ... the aircraft characteristics guaranteed safe go around from the height of 40&nbsp;m (without taking into consideration the possible obstacles and terrain along the flight path).\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> Taking into consideration the terrain at Smolensk, the investigation determined the last moment a go-around maneuver would have been successful was coincident with the first officer calling \"Go around\" and briefly pulling the control column at {{convert|60|m|ft}}.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\n===Polish comments on the draft of the final report===\nOn the same day that the final report was published by MAK, Poland published its comments on the draft of the final report<ref name=\"Polish comments to draft of Final Report\"/> sent to MAK before. Poland stated that their comments were not taken into consideration. MAK did not include them in the report, but published this document on its website among other appendixes.<ref name=\"Appendixes for MAK report\"/> Poland also published a final version of MAK report with changes performed by MAK in reaction for Polish comments highlighted (red color means changes of text, blue means text addition).<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\nThe main points of Polish comments are:<ref name=\"Polish comments to draft of Final Report\"/>\n* A list of documents, evidence, and other information requested by Poland but not received from the Russian side (First table in document \"Lista Wystapien Strony Polskiej o Dokumentacje\", List of requests from Poland about documentation.

During military operations the ATC can give orders to the crew about landing decisions as opposed to civilian flights where the ATC only gives recommendations, but where the final decision about landing is the pilots' responsibility.<ref name=\"Polish comments to draft of Final Report\"/>\n* Information that result of analysis of CVR (Cockpit Voice Recorder), performed by Polish Commission for the Investigation of National Aviation Accidents, says that first officer gives command \"go around\" at 100&nbsp;m altitude<ref name=\"Polish comments to draft of Final Report\"/><ref name=\"TU154m did not land\"/><ref name = \"TU154m did not land2\"/> This analysis has been ignored by MAK's final report.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n* Request for document confirmation that Commander of the Landing Zone was allowed to work in bad weather conditions.

The heights of these obstacles are 15m higher than allowed (according to both Russian and ICAO regulations). After the accident, trees in this area were cut.<ref name = \"Polish comments to draft of Final Report\"/> The structure of flight PLF 101 began to be destroyed in that area.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n* Polish explanation that there is no requirement in Military aviation for aircraft to have insurance (''PLF 101'' was owned and maintained by the Polish Military) and even civil regulations allows other financial protections besides insurance. In the case of ''PLF 101'', the Polish National Treasury was financially responsible for the aircraft.<ref name=\"Polish comments to draft of Final Report\"/>\n* Polish explanation that, according to Polish law, Certificate of Airworthiness is required for civilian planes and is not obligatory for military machines&nbsp;\u2014 instead of this certificate, Polish military planes have to accomplish conditions regulated by \"Instrukcja s\u0142u\u017cby in\u017cynieryjno-lotniczej Lotnictwa Si\u0142 Zbrojnych RP\" (Instruction for engineering and aviation service of Aviation Forces in Republic of Poland).

They concluded that the \"on course, on glide path\" calls given to the pilots were made when the aircraft was actually off course, and furthermore the \"Level!\" call was given 11 seconds too late.<ref name=\"polish comments 1-18-11\"/>\n\n===MAK publication of ATC tapes===\nIn response to the Polish claims of publicity MAK published transcripts of ATC recordings on its website.<ref

2016}}</ref>{{better source|date=December 2017}} The transcripts show that communication between the ATC and PLF101 was done mostly in Russian with only a few English phrases.\n\n==Causes==\n\n===MAK report===\nThe MAK report found the \"immediate cause\" of the accident was the failure of the crew to make a timely decision to proceed to an alternate airport despite being warned multiple times of the poor weather conditions at Smolensk.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> Another immediate cause was the descent below minimums without visual contact with the ground as well as ignoring numerous TAWS warnings.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> This led to [[controlled flight into terrain]].<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> Additionally, the MAK report found an \"immediate cause\" of the accident was the presence in the cockpit of the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Air Force, which placed extreme [[Stress in the aviation industry|stress]] and \"psychological pressure\" on the Captain to \"continue descent in conditions of unjustified risk with a dominating aim of landing at any means.\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\nA \"contributing factor\" to the accident was a long discussion with the Protocol director and the crew of the Yak-40 regarding the actual weather and the impossibility of landing at Smolensk in such weather conditions.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The report found this discussion caused the Captain to experience \"clash of motives.\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> On one hand he knew that landing in the reported weather conditions was unsafe.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> On the other hand, he faced strong motivation to land at Smolensk anyway.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> He expected a strong negative reaction from the President if he chose to divert the airplane and land at an alternate airport.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\nOther \"contributing factors\" were a lack of compliance with standard operating procedures, a lack of crew resource management, and a significant gap in bad weather flights by the PIC (he had not flown in weather conditions similar to Smolensk that day in four months).<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> Additional \"contributing factors\" were the Navigator calling out radar altitudes without considering the uneven terrain in the area, utilization of the autopilot and autothrottles much lower than minimum descent altitude which did not comply with the Flight Crew Operations Manual for the Tu-154, and the late start of the final descent which caused the crew to maintain a higher than normal vertical speed.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\nA \"systemic cause\" of the accident were \"significant shortcomings in the organization of flight operations, flight crew preparation and arrangement of the VIP flight in the special air regiment.\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\n===Official Polish government report===\nThe Polish [[Committee for Investigation of National Aviation Accidents]] (KBWLLP) published its report on 29 July 2011,<ref name=\"komisja.smolensk.gov.pl\"/> also available in English and Russian.<ref name=\"final_polish_report\"/><ref name=\"final_polish_reportRU\"/> While the report stated that pilot error was the main cause of the accident, with the crew lacking adequate training in operating in adverse weather conditions, it differed from the Russian report in several aspects.\n\nChief among these differences was a conclusion that the pilots were not placed under pressure forcing them to land at Smolensk, and furthermore the crew did not want to land and after reaching 100m altitude (measured by radio altimeter) and had decided to go around using the autopilot.<ref name=\"final_polish_report\"/> However, it was impossible for the autopilot installed in the aircraft to conduct an automatic go-around from a non-precision approach.<ref name=\"final_polish_report\"/> The Polish investigation concluded this caused a delay in executing the go-around which contributed to the crash.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nAnother major difference was a conclusion that Russian air traffic control played a part in the accident by passing incorrect information to the crew regarding the plane's position. ATC gave distance callouts on average {{convert|500|m|ft}} in advance, and told the aircraft it was on the correct glidepath when it actually was not. Furthermore, the controllers gave the \"Level 101\" command ten seconds after the aircraft passed the {{convert|100|m|ft}} altitude where such call was supposed to be given.<ref name=\"final_polish_report\"/><ref name=\"BBC blame\"/><ref name=\"flight pol\"/>\n\nThe Polish report also found three deficiencies regarding the Smolensk airport which contributed to the crash. One was a large number of obstacles (mostly tall trees) in the area before the runway which should have been removed to keep the protected approach airspace clear of obstructions. The second deficiency was with the approach lighting system, which was charted incorrectly and not well maintained. Many bulbs were burned out, several others were missing their lenses, and others were obscured by shrubbery.<ref name=\"final_polish_report\"/> The third concern was with the airport information received by Poland, which contained incorrect information. In addition to the lighting system not being depicted correctly, the airport's location was charted approximately {{convert|116|m|ft}} to the North of its actual position.<ref name=\"final_polish_report\"/><ref name=\"Polish comments to draft of Final Report\"/>\n\nDue to numerous accusations raised by [[Law and Justice]] opposition party who rejected the official report's conclusions, a new commission was created in 2013, headed by [[Maciej Lasek]]. Its task was to publish and explain all the technical evidence used in the official report. Lasek commission's produced over a hundred very detailed technical reports, maps, transcripts, photos and videos which were originally published on ''www.faktysmolensk.gov.pl'' website.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Shortly after the [[2015 Polish parliamentary election]]s the website was shut down and all documents removed by the new government,<ref name=\"AP-Gera\" /> but were subsequently restored on an independent mirror.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nCause of accident according to Polish report:\n: The immediate cause of the accident was the descent below the minimum descent altitude at an excessive rate of descent in weather conditions which prevented visual contact with the ground, as well as a delayed execution of the go-around procedure. Those circumstances led to an impact on a terrain obstacle resulting in separation of a part of the left wing with aileron and consequently to the loss of aircraft control and eventual ground impact.<ref name=\"final_polish_report\"/>\n\nCircumstances contributing to the accident:<ref name=\"final_polish_report\"/>\n# Failure to monitor altitude by means of a pressure altimeter during a non-precision approach;\n# failure by the crew to respond to the PULL UP warning generated by the TAWS;\n# attempt to execute the go-around maneuver under the control of ABSU (automatic go-around);\n# Approach Control confirming to the crew the correct position of the airplane in relation to the RWY threshold, glide slope, and course which might have affirmed the crew's belief that the approach was proceeding correctly although the airplane was actually outside the permissible deviation margin;\n# failure by LZC to inform the crew about descending below the glide slope and delayed issuance of the level-out command;\n# incorrect training of the Tu-154M flight crews in the 36 Regiment.\n\nConducive circumstances:<ref name=\"final_polish_report\"/>\n# incorrect coordination of the crew's work, which placed an excessive burden on the aircraft commander in the final phase of the flight;\n# insufficient flight preparation of the crew;\n# the crew's insufficient knowledge of the airplane's systems and their limitations;\n# inadequate cross-monitoring among the crew members and failure to respond to the mistakes committed;\n# crew composition inadequate for the task;\n# ineffective immediate supervision of the 36 Regiment's flight training process by the Air Force Command;\n# failure by the 36 Regiment to develop procedures governing the crew's actions in the event of:\n#* failure to meet the established approach criteria;\n#* using radio altimeter for establishing alarm altitude values for various types of approach;\n#* distribution of duties in a multi-crew flight.\n# sporadic performance of flight support duties by LZC over the last 12 months, in particular under difficult WC, and lack of practical experience as LZC at the SMOLENSK NORTH airfield.\n\n==Notable passengers==\n{{see also|List of casualties of the 2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash}}\nIn addition to Kaczy\u0144ski and his wife Maria, and [[Ryszard Kaczorowski]], the former last President of Poland in exile, on board were the military [[Polish General Staff|chiefs of staff]] ([[Polish Land Forces|army]], [[Polish Air Force|air force]], [[Polish Navy|navy]]), the [[National Bank of Poland|national bank]] governor, a deputy foreign minister, head army chaplains of the Catholic and Orthodox churches, head of the [[National Security Bureau (Poland)|National Security Bureau]], three deputy [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland|parliament]] speakers, [[Polish Olympic Committee|Olympic Committee]] head, the [[Ombudsman|civil rights commissioner]] [[Janusz Kochanowski]], trade union activist [[Anna Walentynowicz]], and at least two presidential aides and widely known national lawmakers (including core members of the [[Law and Justice]] party).<ref name=\"yahoo\"/><ref name=\"mswia\"/>\n\n==Political aftermath==\nIn accordance with the [[Constitution of the Republic of Poland|Polish Constitution]], on the [[President of the Republic of Poland|President]]'s death his duties were taken on by the [[Marshal of the Sejm]] (speaker of the lower house of the parliament)\u2014at the time [[Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski]], who thus became [[Acting President of Poland]].<ref name=\"The Constitution of the Republic of Poland\"/> Within two weeks he was obliged to announce the date of the [[2010 Polish presidential election|popular presidential election]], to be held within a further 60 days on a weekend.

The [[Polish Armed Forces]] were dealt a severe blow, however, since all of their senior commanding officers were killed; their duties were automatically taken over by respective deputy commanders, following standard contingency plans for such a situation.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nThe commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre was split up because of the political conflict between the liberal-conservative government of [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]] [[Donald Tusk]] and national-conservative President Kaczy\u0144ski.<ref name=\"Dwie uroczysto\u015bci w Katyniu\"/>\nOn 7 April, Tusk, along with government officials and members of his [[Civic Platform]] party, went to Katyn<ref name=\"gazeta6\"/>\non invitation from the [[Prime Minister of Russia]], [[Vladimir Putin]].<ref name=\"Putin zaprosi\u0142 Tuska do Katynia\"/>\nThe official commemoration, organised by Polish [[Council for the Protection of Struggle and Martyrdom Sites]], was scheduled on 10 April.

On 26 November 2010, the Russian [[State Duma]] passed a resolution admitting that Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] personally approved the Katyn massacre.<ref name=\"Stalin and Katyn\" /> The Soviets had long claimed Nazi Germany were the ones responsible.<ref name=\"Stalin and Katyn\" /> Although this stance changed in 1990 when [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] admitted the Soviet NKVD secret police carried out the massacre, the November 2010 resolution was the first time the Russian government admitted direct involvement by Stalin.<ref name=\"Stalin and Katyn\" />\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Rzeczpospolita (newspaper)|Rzeczpospolita]]'', [[Andrei Illarionov]], Vladimir Putin's former advisor, noted, \"... contrary to the promises, the investigation of this crash is neither transparent nor dynamic.\" and added, \"... the Polish side does not have full and free access to documents and evidence.\" Illarionov was also one of the signatories of an open letter written by Russian dissidents, which voiced concerns about the conduct of the investigation. According to the letter, \"rapprochement with the current Russian authorities is more important for the Polish government than determining the truth about the plane crash.\" Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk responded that his government would obtain flight data from the Russian investigators before making its own judgment and revealing it to the public.<ref name=\"wsj\" />\n\n===International===\nAt least 96 countries, 13 international organizations and several other entities expressed their reaction on behalf of the incident.

Among the victims were the [[President of Poland]] [[Lech Kaczy\u0144ski]] and his wife [[Maria Kaczy\u0144ska|Maria]], the former [[Polish government-in-exile|President of Poland in exile]] [[Ryszard Kaczorowski]], the chief of the [[Polish General Staff]] and other senior [[Polish military]] officers, the president of the [[National Bank of Poland]], [[Polish Government]] officials, 18 members of the [[Polish Parliament]], senior members of the Polish clergy and relatives of victims of the [[Katyn massacre]]. The group was arriving from [[Warsaw]] to attend an event commemorating the 70th anniversary of the massacre, which took place not far from Smolensk.\n\nThe pilots were attempting to land at [[Smolensk North Airport]]\u2014a former military airbase\u2014in thick fog, with visibility reduced to about {{convert|500|m|ft}}. The aircraft descended far below the normal approach path until it struck trees, rolled inverted and crashed into the ground, coming to rest in a wooded area a short distance from the runway.<ref name=\"final_polish_report\"/>\n\nBoth the Russian and Polish official investigations found no technical faults with the aircraft, and concluded that the crew failed to conduct the approach in a safe manner in the given weather conditions. The Polish authorities found serious deficiencies in the organization and training of the Air Force unit involved, which was subsequently disbanded. Several high-ranking members of the Polish military resigned, under pressure from politicians and the media.\n\nVarious [[conspiracy theories]] about the crash have since been in circulation, and are promoted by [[Law and Justice]]'s leaders [[Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski]] (twin brother to Polish President Lech Kaczy\u0144ski) and his deputy, [[Antoni Macierewicz]], who claim the crash was a political assassination. Polish and international investigations did not find any evidence supporting this claim.<ref name=\"final_polish_report\"/>\n\n==Background==\n\n===Purpose of the flight===\nThe flight's purpose was taking many high-ranking Polish officials to ceremonies marking the 70th anniversary of the [[Katyn massacre]], a mass murder of Polish intellectuals, politicians, and military officers by the Soviets during World War II. The site of the massacre is approximately {{convert|19|km|abbr=on}} west of Smolensk. The area is fairly remote; Smolensk is the only city nearby and has the only two airports in the area: [[Smolensk North Airport]], where the accident occurred, and [[Smolensk South Airport]].\n\n===Destination airport===\n[[File:Tu-154-crash-in-smolensk-20100410-08.jpg|thumb|Russian servicemen, accompanied by a policeman, twist bulbs into the approach lights of Smolensk North Airport's runway, hours after the crash of the Tu-154]]\n[[Smolensk North Airport]] is a former military airbase, presently in mixed military-civilian use. At the time of the crash, the airport was not equipped with an [[ICAO]]-compliant [[instrument landing system]] (ILS), the standard system used in most developed countries. The airport used to have a Russian-made landing system installed, which was decommissioned after civilian operations started.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The Polish Tu-154 was modified to use western-style ILS.<ref name=\"RT-1\"/> A [[non-directional beacon]] (NDB) was installed at the airport,<ref name=\"Charles Bremner&nbsp;\u2013 Times Online&nbsp;\u2013 WBLG: The Polish crash: looking for answers\"/> but such a device is essentially a [[navigational aid]], and can be used only for [[non-precision approach]]es, where it can guide the pilot to align with the runway, but offers no vertical guidance on how to descend towards the runway.<ref name=\"Gazeta\"/> The airport was equipped also with both a [[Surveillance radar approach|surveillance]] and landing [[radar]].<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The lowest approved visibility conditions to land (approach minimums) were cloud base {{convert|100|m|sp=us}} and visibility {{convert|1000|m|sp=us}}.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\nThe ground visual navigation aids on 10 April 2010 were not effective. According to the Polish report, the radar was unstable and swung within \u00b110%.<ref name=\"komisja.smolensk.gov.pl\"/> From the photographic documentation of the Polish committee, it appears that the origin of components of the Smolensk North lighting system was unknown. This was not the Luch-2MU system as the Russians stated. The report from the inspection flight performed on 15 April 2010 stated that the approach lamps, depending on their location and on the altitude of an inbound aircraft, can be shaded by surrounding trees and shrubs when an aircraft is at a distance of 400, 700, and 800 metres from Runway 26. The lamps of the first group (900 m) had their light filters shattered and, of three bulbs installed, only one was serviceable.<ref name=\"komisja.smolensk.gov.pl\"/>\n\n===Aircraft===\n[[File:Polish Air Force Tupolev Tu-154 Dmitry Karpezo-2.jpg|thumb|''PLF 101'', the aircraft involved in the accident, seen at [[Boryspil International Airport]] in 2008]]\nThe aircraft was a [[Tupolev Tu-154M]] of the [[36th Special Aviation Regiment]] of the [[Polish Air Force]] (Si\u0142y Powietrzne), tail number 101. Built in 1990 at the [[Aviakor|Kuybyshev Aviation Plant]] as [[manufacturer's serial number|msn]] 90A837, it first flew on 29 June 1990. At the time of the accident, the airframe had accumulated more than 5,150 hours in 4,000 cycles. The service life of the Tu-154M is more than 25 years or 30,000 hours or 15,000 cycles (whichever comes first). All three [[Soloviev]] [[Soloviev D-30|D-30KU-154]] engines were within the service limits of 24,000 hours or 11,100 cycles.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\n\"101\" was one of two Tupolev Tu-154s that served as [[Air transports of heads of state and government|official government jets]]; the other with a tail number of 102 was a year younger and at the time of the accident it was being overhauled in the [[Aviakor]] aviation plant in [[Samara, Russia]]. The \"101\" aircraft had undergone a major overhaul in December 2009, and Alexey Gusev, the head of the maintenance plant that carried out the work, told Polish TV that it should not have had technical problems.<ref name=\"bbctupolev\"/> The crash happened 138 flight hours after the most recent overhaul.<ref name=\"altair\"/>\n\nThe aircraft used the [[callsign]] ''PLF 101''. PLF is the [[ICAO]] [[Airline codes|three-letter designator]] for the Polish Air Force used to identify the operator of an aircraft by air traffic control.\n\n=== Crew ===\nThe cockpit crew consisted of pilot Captain [[Arkadiusz Protasiuk]], co-pilot Major [[Robert Grzywna]], navigator Lieutenant [[Artur Zi\u0119tek]] and flight engineer WO2 Andrzej Michalak.  Protasiuk had landed at Smolensk three days earlier on 7 April in the same Tu-154; he served as first officer on that flight.<ref name=\"Final Report\" /> Protasiuk had 3,531 flight hours, including 2,906 hours on the Tu-154. Co-pilot Grzywna had 1,909 hours, with 475 of them on the Tu-154. Zi\u0119tek had 1,050 hours, only 58 of them on the Tu-154. Michalak had only 329 hours, all on the Tu-154.<ref name=\"Final Report\" />\n\n==Flight sequence==\n\n===Take-off and cruise===\n[[File:2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash map-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Map of the origin and destination of the accident flight]]\n''PLF 101''<ref name=\"PLF\"/> took off from Warsaw at 9:27 Smolensk time after a delay of 27 minutes.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\nAs the aircraft left Warsaw, weather conditions were rapidly deteriorating at Smolensk. A [[Inversion (meteorology)|temperature inversion]] had developed, trapping moisture low in the atmosphere and causing a dense fog to develop.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> At 9:15 Smolensk time, about an hour and a half before the crash, a [[Yakovlev Yak-40]] jet (flight PLF 031)<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> also belonging to the Polish government<ref name=\"gazeta\"/> and carrying Polish journalists from the President's [[News media|press pool]] landed at the airbase without incident, though conditions were rapidly worsening at the time.<ref name=\"rt_journalists\"/> Shortly thereafter, between 9:20 and 9:39 MSD, a Russian [[Ilyushin Il-76]] (tail number 78817) made two attempts to land,<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> but because of low visibility, it diverted to [[Vnukovo International Airport|Vnukovo Airport]] near Moscow.<ref name=\"smol\"/> Upon ''PLF 101'''s<ref name=\"PLF\"/> approach to the base, atmospheric conditions continued to worsen, and the fog continued to thicken, further reducing visibility to {{convert|400|m|ft}}.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The ground control personnel stated to ''PLF 101''<ref name=\"PLF\"/> that there were no conditions for landing.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The Captain then requested and was given permission to conduct a \"trial\" approach.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The controllers instructed the captain as to the landing minimum of {{convert|100|m|ft}}, to which the captain replied, \"Yes, sir!\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\n===Stress and workload factors===\nMeanwhile, the situation in the cockpit was one of very high stress.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> As the weather continued to worsen, the crew became increasingly aware of the extreme difficulty they would encounter in landing at Smolensk. The crew may have feared a negative reaction from their passengers should they have to divert to an alternative airfield.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The protocol director was present in the cockpit from time to time, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Air Force was present in the cockpit{{check|date=October 2016}} for the final approach phase of the flight, including the crash itself.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{Update inline|date=October 2016}}<!-- Subsequent investigation claims voice of CinC was misidentified on CVR --> At one point, the navigator is heard on the CVR saying \"He'll go crazy\", a possible reference to the President of Poland, had the crew chosen to divert.<ref>{{cite news|title=He'll Go Crazy: Cockpit audio sheds light on Polish plane crash|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNyHemI4hKs|accessdate=21 November 2015|work=RT|publisher=Autonomous Nonprofit Organization \"TV-Novosti\"|date=12 January 2011}}</ref> There may also have been some friction between the Air Force Commander and the captain, caused by an absence of the latter from condition training.<ref name=\"polityka\"/>\n\nThe captain and first officer's decision making may have also been affected by knowledge of a 2008 flight when the President of Poland ordered a change in destination right before departure and again while airborne. The captain and first officer had been the first officer and navigator, respectively, on that flight. Lacking charts or a flight plan for the new destination, the captain of that flight had decided he could not bring the aircraft to the new destination safely. Disobeying the President and a high-ranking Polish Air Force commander on board, the captain flew on to the originally planned destination. The Polish prosecutor's office would later clear that captain of any wrongdoing in relation to that flight, and he was even awarded a silver medal of merit for national defense.<ref name=\"Tbilisi Captain flies to New York\"/> However, in the final report issued by MAK (The Interstate Aviation Committee [IAC; Russian: \u041c\u0435\u0436\u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u0432\u0438\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442, \u041c\u0410\u041a] \u2013 a supervising body overseeing the use and management of civil aviation in the Commonwealth of Independent States [CIS]), it was stated he had not been assigned to fly the President since,<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> though Polish sources note he flew the President to New York in September 2008, despite objections from the President.<ref name=\"Tbilisi Captain flies to New York\"/> The captain involved in the 2008 incident flew the Polish Prime Minister to Smolensk on 7 April without the President on board, but he was removed from the crew of the 10 April flight which carried the President.<ref name=\"dziennik\"/> Knowledge of the 2008 incident and its repercussions may have weighed on the crew of ''PLF 101'',<ref name=\"PLF\"/> potentially placing additional pressure on them to complete their flight to the original destination.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\nComplicating the situation was the increased workload on the captain. Normally, one pilot flies the airplane while another crew member handles radio communications. On ''PLF 101'',<ref name=\"PLF\"/> the responsibility for communication usually rests with the navigator. At Smolensk however the situation was different. As the airport is not usually open for international flights and is not ICAO certified, the air traffic controllers were not required to be fluent in English, the ICAO standard language for ATC communication. As such, all communication between Smolensk ATC and ''PLF 101''<ref name=\"PLF\"/> was carried out in Russian. Russian law requires international flights landing at military airports to have a Russian \"Leaderman\" (navigator; [[Russian language|Russian]] lidirovshik) on board the flight, who is then responsible for all ATC communication, which is done in Russian.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> In the middle of March, as part of their request for permission to conduct the flight, Poland asked for \"Leaderman\" services and the latest airport data for Smolensk. At the end of March, after apparently receiving no reply to their first request, Poland tendered a second request for permission to fly, but did not request \"Leaderman\" services. As a spokesperson for the Air Force Command said: \"The Russian side has not confirmed readiness to secure the flight leader\".<ref name=\"Pu\u0142k chcia\u0142, by rosyjski nawigator lecia\u0142 Tu-154\"/><ref name=\"Piloci prosili o rosyjskiego nawigatora do Tu-154\"/> According to the Final Report, Russia did offer \"Leaderman\" services, but Poland refused, stating their crew had satisfactory knowledge of Russian and could conduct the flight without the Leaderman.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> In reality, the captain was the only member of the crew who could speak adequate Russian.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> Therefore, upon being handed off (transferred) to Smolensk ATC, the captain took over communication duties from the navigator. In a normal situation, this would dictate that the first officer be the pilot actually flying the airplane, but as the weather was bad the captain, as the most experienced member of the crew, elected to fly the airplane as well.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> Therefore, the captain was performing two tasks simultaneously which are usually split up, increasing his workload and requiring him to divide his attention.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\n===Approach===\n[[File:Polish Air Force Tupolev Tu-154M Lebeda.jpg|thumb|''PLF 101'' landing at [[Prague Airport]] less than two days before the accident]]\nUnder these stresses, the crew continued their approach pattern and readied the aircraft for final descent. Radios were tuned to the two Non-Directional Beacons (NDBs) present at the field, and the [[autopilot]] was set up to use [[waypoint]]s from the [[Flight Management System]] (FMS) units for navigation. The crew used their second radio to contact the Yak-40 which had landed earlier, inquiring as to the weather conditions. The Yak-40 crew replied, \"Well, generally it's absolute shit here,\" and that, \"(we) were lucky to land at the last moment.\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The Yak-40 crew estimated visibility was {{convert|200|m|ft}}, but told ''PLF 101'',<ref name=\"PLF\"/> \"you might try...(to make an approach).\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The crew of ''PLF 101'' acknowledged this information and continued their approach. As the aircraft approached the outer marker, the crew issued pitch commands (via the CLIMB-DESCEND wheel) to the autopilot. This is not recommended for the Tu-154, as the autopilot cannot maintain vertical speed accurately enough for the approach phase of flight; manual flight mode is instead recommended. Although the crew had not requested it, the radar controller began issuing reports to ''PLF 101'' concerning their distance from the runway and whether or not they were on the glidepath.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The Polish report noted that on multiple occasions the radar controller stated the airplane was on the glidepath when it was not.\n\nThe [[Terrain awareness and warning system|Terrain Awareness Warning System]] (TAWS) fired its first audible warning \"terrain ahead!\" at 10:40:06. This was because the Smolensk airport, as a former military airfield not open to international flights, was not in the system's database and therefore the system did not recognize that the airplane was approaching an airport.<ref name=\"TAWS Airport data listing\"/> Six seconds later, someone (most likely the captain or navigator) pressed a button on the captain's FMS panel commanding standard barometric pressure be set on the captain's main electronic altimeter. This had the effect of increasing the altimeter's reading by {{convert|170|m|ft}}; as the TAWS takes readings from this particular altimeter, this had the additional effect of silencing the warning.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The captain's secondary (mechanical) and the copilot's main electronic pressure altimeters continued to read correctly.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> As the descent continued, the crew realized they had started descent too late. To compensate for this, they increased their vertical speed to {{convert|8|m/s|ft/s}}, twice the prescribed rate for a normal approach. The aircraft did not have enough drag to maintain speed with this rate of descent, so even though the autothrottles commanded idle power from the engines, the speed of the aircraft increased to approximately {{convert|35|km/h|0|abbr=on}} higher than specified.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\nApproaching {{convert|300|m|ft}}, the navigator began calling out the [[radar altimeter]]'s reading. This is not standard practice for a non-precision approach, as the radar altimeter does not take into account the contour of the terrain around the airport. Standard practice would entail calling out the readings on the [[pressure altimeter]], which is set according to atmospheric pressure and thereby references the elevation of the actual airport. The terrain on approach to Smolensk airport is uneven and locally much lower than the runway level.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\n===Warning signs===\nAt {{convert|200|m|ft}}, the engines were still at idle power. Power settings for jet engines are expressed in instrument readings and flight data recorders as percentages labeled as \"N1\" and \"N2\". N1 and N2 refer to the spools, or shafts, of a [[jet engine]] on which the compressor and turbine blades are mounted; jet engine power is measured as a percentage of maximum N1 or N2 rpm.<ref name=\"Airplane Flying Handbook\"/> Although the shafts are not mechanically connected, the speed of one spool can be calculated based on the speed of the other spool and atmospheric conditions.<ref name=\"Airplane Flying Handbook\"/> The Tu-154 manual indicates that a [[go-around]] must be initiated at 200 m if the engines are running at or below 75% N2.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> This is because jet engine throttle response is not linear; jet engines have to \"spool up\" in order to produce more thrust.<ref name=\"Airplane Flying Handbook\"/> At power settings higher than 78%, this response is almost instantaneous; at idle power, it can take a full 8 seconds for a jet engine to \"spool up\" to full power.<ref name=\"Airplane Flying Handbook\"/> On ''PLF 101'',<ref name=\"PLF\"/> the N2 values were not recorded by the [[flight data recorder]] (FDR). The N1 values were, and at 200 m they indicated 32\u201333% N1. 75% N2 equates to 51\u201352% N1 for the given conditions.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> As such, the engines were well below the 75% minimum N2 reading, and the crew should have initiated a [[go-around]] at this point, even though they were still above [[Decision height|Decision Height (DH)]]. However, they did not go around, and continued the descent. The Final Report would later determine that a go-around was technically possible from as low as 40 m, but that 200 m was the first of many times that the crew were required to go around, but did not.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\nAt {{convert|180|m|ft}}, the \"terrain ahead!\" warning again sounded on the flight deck. The crew continued the descent. According to MAK's report, at {{convert|100|m|ft}} (Decision Height) there was no \"landing\" or \"go-around\" call by the captain. If this happens, the first officer is supposed to overrule the captain, take control of the airplane, and initiate a go-around.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> Poland suggests that at this point the captain said \"Go around\", and 8 seconds later the first officer confirmed by saying \"go around\".<ref name=\"Polish comments to draft of Final Report\"/><ref name=\"TU154m did not land\"/><ref name=\"TU154m did not land2\"/> (only the second of these two statements is recorded in the official transcripts by MAK; the first one may have been obscured by a simultaneous report by TAWS). Despite these calls, neither pilot initiated a go-around, and the descent continued.  One second after the 100 m altitude was reached, the TAWS alert \"PULL UP\" activated and continued to sound for the remainder of the flight. \"PULL UP\" only activates when the TAWS computer believes a collision with terrain is imminent. Therefore, when \"PULL UP\" sounds, the crew is supposed to begin an immediate, maximum performance emergency climb (full power and [[angle of attack]] to the maximum permissible without [[stall (aviation)|stalling]]) and continue climbing until the warning stops.<ref name=\"ICAO TAWS Report\"/> However, the crew continued the descent.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> In a typical situation with an airport in the TAWS database, the \"PULL UP\" warning might not have sounded at this point.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} There is a method of setting up the TAWS to prevent false warnings when flying into airports not in the database, known as \"terrain inhibit\" mode; however, the crew did not utilize it.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> Even if they had, an excessive rate of descent and excessive airspeed can cause the TAWS to issue a \"SINK RATE\" warning followed by a \"PULL UP\" warning.<ref name=\"Certification of Terrain Awareness and Warning System (TAWS) Installations\"/> This point (10:40:40 local time, approximately 20 seconds before the collision with terrain) is also notable because this was the moment when the aircraft had crossed the minimum allowed approach slope for this airport (2\u00b010'). Prior to this moment, the radar controller had no reason to think that the landing attempt was not proceeding normally. The behavior of the controller was later the subject of some criticism by the Polish media. The controller remained silent for about 12 seconds after the aircraft passed the 100 m mark, and, even at that point, he did not order a go-around, but, rather issued an instruction to transit from a descent to a horizontal flight. (The decision to go around was apparently reached in the cabin of the aircraft within a few seconds of that instruction.)<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> In addition, according to some interpretations of the radio exchange between the ground and the aircraft, the crew was instructed by the ground control to descend to {{convert|120|m|ft}} and either to wait for clearance to land or request one explicitly,<ref name=\"rian\"/> or to inform the ground control regarding their decision whether to land or to go around.<ref name=\"marker\"/> (According to MAK's report, it meant that the crew was supposed to inform the ground control of their decision to land before passing the decision altitude, and that the ground control was supposed to allow the landing as long as the runway and the airspace were clear.) None of this ever happened, with the aircraft continuing the descent through the 120 m mark while the ground control remained silent. It is unknown whether the crew really understood the ground control instruction (literally, \"landing additionally, 120, 3 m\"), which was issued in Russian and used a relatively recent expression that was only codified in 2006.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nFor the next several seconds, the crew continued to call out \"100 meters\" as read from the radar altimeter. The aircraft was flying into a valley at this time and actually descended by {{convert|60\u201370|m}}.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The crew began calling out radar altitude every {{convert|10|m}}. At {{convert|60|m}} radar altitude (where the crew had set their radar altitude bugs), the First Officer called out \"Go around\" (this is the \"confirmation\" go around call referred to in the Polish comment above). Due to the terrain in the area, the aircraft was actually only {{convert|15|m}} above runway level at the time. Simultaneously to this callout, the FDR recorded a brief pull on the control column, likely done by the first officer, as he instinctively started the go-around sequence of actions. According to the investigation, this attempt at a go-around was completely overridden by the auto-pilot, which was still active, and, in any event, it was not completed (protocol requires that the correct sequence of operations during a go-around attempt involves increasing thrust to takeoff mode and disengaging the autopilot, neither action was done at the time).<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> Flight simulator testing by the investigation concluded that had the first officer completed a go-around at this point, the crash would likely have been avoided despite the violation of minimums and the excessive rate of descent.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The investigation found that this was the last moment at which a go-around could have been successful.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\n===Point of no return===\nAs the crew called out \"50 meters\", the controller instructed \"level 101\", telling the aircraft to terminate descent. At {{convert|20|m|ft}}, another controller instructed \"Check altitude, level.\" Simultaneously with this final call, the control column was pulled full aft, commanding max pitch up from the aircraft, and the throttles were moved within one second from their flight idle positions to maximum power. The aircraft, due to the valley terrain, was actually {{convert|15|m|ft}} below the runway at this time. The Russian investigation surmised that at this moment the flight crew saw the trees through the fog, and instinctively reacted in an attempt to escape their grave predicament. The crew did not disengage the autopilot, but the action of commanding maximum pitch up on the control column overpowered it, causing the pitch channel to disengage. The control column briefly moved to neutral at this point, then moved full aft and remained there for the duration of the flight.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> According to the Polish report, the command \"level\" ordering a change to horizontal flight was issued at a time when the aircraft was at an altitude of about {{convert|14|m|ft}} above airfield level. Two seconds before the \"level\" command, the aircraft commander made the decision to go around. According to the Polish committee's findings, the command to level should have been issued 10 seconds sooner, when the aircraft was well below the glide path.<ref name=\"komisja.smolensk.gov.pl\"/>\n\nSoon after, the aircraft began hitting trees. One, a large birch with a trunk {{convert|30|to|40|cm|0|abbr=on}} wide, ripped off about {{convert|6.5|m|ft}} of the left wing, including the left [[aileron]]. The resulting asymmetrical lift caused an uncommanded roll to the left. Within 5 seconds, the aircraft was inverted, hitting the ground with the left wing, followed very shortly after by the nose. The nose impact resulted in forces exceeding 100[[g-force|g]], which killed everyone on board instantly.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> Even without the birch tree and subsequent roll, the excessive [[angle of attack]] would have led to an aerodynamic [[Stall (flight)|stall]] approximately two seconds after impact with that tree, which would also have led to a fatal accident.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> According to the Polish report, safety areas around every aerodrome are mandated by international regulations (including Polish and Russian law) to prevent situations where aircraft or aerodrome operation could be compromised by obstacles in the immediate vicinity. A thorough analysis of terrain reveals that obstacles were present in the safety area, with many trees exceeding the permitted height limit (mostly about {{convert|10\u201311|m|ft}}).<ref name=\"komisja.smolensk.gov.pl\"/>\n\nAfter the nose hit, the aircraft was violently torn apart by impact forces.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The wreckage came to rest upside-down about {{convert|200|m|ft}} before the runway threshold and slightly left of its centreline. The largest pieces left were the [[wing root]]s (the strongest part of an airplane), the wingtips and the tail section. The tail section came to rest backwards, relative to the direction of flight. A small post-impact fire ensued, but was quickly brought under control by the emergency services and extinguished 18 minutes later.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\nThe [[Governor of Smolensk Oblast|Governor]] of [[Smolensk Oblast]], [[Sergey Antufyev]], confirmed that there were no survivors of the crash. Pictures from the scene showed parts of the aircraft charred and strewn through a wooded area.<ref name=\"BBC8612825\"/> The Russian Prime Minister, [[Vladimir Putin]], said that the bodies of those killed in the crash would be brought to Moscow for identification.<ref name=\"Body of Polish President recovered from crash site\"/> Kaczy\u0144ski's body was identified in Smolensk and was flown directly to [[Warsaw]] on the afternoon of 11 April.<ref name=\"President Lech Kaczy\u0144ski's body returns to Poland\"/>\n\n==Initial investigation==\nAs the accident occurred on Russian soil, Russia was tasked by [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]] procedure with primary responsibility for investigation, which it carried out with international cooperation. Poland also set up its own committee to investigate the crash, and prosecutors in both countries began criminal investigations.\n\n===Interstate Aviation Committee===\nIn the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS), the [[Interstate Aviation Committee]] (IAC) ({{lang-ru|\u041c\u0435\u0436\u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u0432\u0438\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442 (MAK)}}) oversees the use and management of civil aviation. The committee's Air Accident Investigation Commission is responsible for investigating civil aviation accidents occurring in commonwealth member nations. The committee is headquartered in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]].<ref name=\"Main Page\"/>\n\n===Immediate actions===\nWithin hours of the crash, the [[President of Russia]], [[Dmitry Medvedev]], announced the establishment of a special commission for the investigation of the accident. The commission was to be supervised by [[Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation|Prime Minister]] Vladimir Putin.<ref name=\"kremlin\"/><ref name=\"kremlin1\"/><ref name=\"lenta\"/> An Investigation Committee of the [[Prosecutor General of Russia]] started a criminal case in accordance with a \"violation of the safety rules\" of the [[Russian Criminal Code]].<ref name=\"newsru\"/>\n\n===Flight recorders===\nTwo [[flight recorder]]s, the [[cockpit voice recorder]] (CVR) and the [[flight data recorder]] (FDR), were recovered undamaged from the crash site during the afternoon/early evening of 10 April, as was confirmed by [[Sergey Shoygu]], the Russian [[Ministry of Emergency Situations (Russia)|Minister of Emergency Situations]].<ref name=\"news\"/> That evening, it was reported that the [[Cockpit voice recorder|CVR]] recordings confirmed the crew attempted to land against the advice of air traffic controllers.<ref name=\"rian2\"/> A third flight recorder, a [[Quick Access Recorder]] (QAR) designed for maintenance diagnostics, was found on 12 April.<ref name=\"lenta3\"/> The two [[Flight Management System]] (FMS) units were also recovered.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The investigation was able to obtain information from the electronic memories of the Quick Access Recorder and one of the FMS units, despite the fact that they were not designed to withstand a crash. Since the FMS units are linked together, being able to read the memory of one meant the investigation was able to determine the actions performed by both units.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> It would later be discovered that the FDR was partially defective and had occasional gaps in its data, but as the QAR managed to survive the crash, by synchronizing the data from the two units, a complete picture of flight data emerged.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\nOn the day after the crash, investigators said they had reviewed the flight recorders, and confirmed that there were no technical problems with the Soviet-built aeroplane, ruling out initial theories that the 20-year-old aircraft was at fault. Alexei Gusev, general director of the [[Aviakor]] factory, said that the aircraft's three engines had been repaired and technicians had upgraded the plane's [[avionics]] at a recent overhaul the previous year. He said that there were no doubts about the plane's airworthiness.<ref name=\"Poland mourns as President Lech Kaczy\u0144ski's body arrives home\"/>\n\n===Search for human remains===\n[[Ewa Kopacz]], former Polish Minister of Health, claimed before the [[Sejm]] that after the crash, ground was dug to a depth of one metre, and even if a tiny piece of human flesh was found, it was genetically tested. However, in the transcript released online by the Sejm, the meaning of her speech was changed: that when a small piece of flesh was found, the ground was dug to a depth of one metre. Moreover, in September 2010, one of the Polish pilgrims to Smolensk found a [[jaw]] with teeth and two other bones.<ref name=\"wpolityce\"/>\n\n===Russian cooperation===\nRussia offered full cooperation to Polish prosecutors during the investigation.<ref name=\"wyborcza_investigation\"/> According to the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC) Polish investigators in Russia have been given access to all procedures of Russian investigators. However, Edmund Klich, the head of the Polish investigative commission, said that \"Poland does not have a lot of things that (we) would like to have\" and as an example gives lack of documentation of Smolensk airport and regulations about Air Control.<ref name=\"wiadomosci.onet.pl\"/> Polish investigators do not have the authority to conduct investigative actions by themselves, but they participated on equal terms with their Russian counterparts in the interviews with people involved and other parts of the investigation. Polish officials were to secure all Polish state documents found in the wreckage, as well as electronic devices (portable computers and mobile telephones) belonging to government officials and military officers. In turn Russian investigators received from Poland materials secured after the crash, including those about the technical state of the aircraft and fitness of the pilot. The Polish investigation results were to be based in part on Russian findings, but they are not bound by the results of the Russian investigation. Preliminary results of the investigations were to be released on the Thursday after the crash (including the cockpit voice recordings), but this was postponed until after the weekend when the funeral of the Presidential couple was to take place,<ref name=\"wyborcza_investigation\"/><ref name=\"Polish pilots on Kaczynski jet 'saw crash coming'\"/> then postponed indefinitely until the full analysis was completed. The Flight Data Recorder and Cockpit Voice Recorder, both of Soviet design, were analyzed in Russia with the participation of Polish experts.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The Quick Access Recorder, designed and produced in Poland, was sent to Poland and analysed there, with the participation of Russian experts.<ref name=\"tvn0413\"/> The Flight Management System units, manufactured in the United States, were analyzed there with the participation of the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]], [[National Transportation Safety Board|NTSB]], Polish experts, and Russian experts.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\n===Airport and pilot communication===\nThe airport's traffic control communicated with the pilots in [[Russian language|Russian]], and one of the controllers claimed the Polish crew had problems communicating in this language.<ref name=\"tvn_plusnin\"/><ref name=\"RT-2\"/> However, according to Tomasz Pietrzak, the former commander of the Polish [[36th Special Aviation Regiment]], the captain of ''PLF 101''<ref name=\"PLF\"/> was fluent in Russian and English.<ref name=\"tvn_plusnin\"/><ref name=\"RT-2\"/> The Captain had landed in Smolensk three days before the crash, when he was part of the crew bringing Polish Prime Minister [[Donald Tusk]] to the 7 April ceremony, and at the time no communication problems with ground control were reported.<ref name=\"gazeta_ru\"/> However, while the captain knew Russian, the rest of the crew did not, in particular the navigator whose task it is to communicate with the ground,<ref name=\"kto niechcial\"/> thus placing an additional workload on the captain. Previous flights to Smolensk had been accompanied by a Russian navigator, but none was provided for the April 2010 flights, with differing reasons for this given by Polish and Russian sides.<ref name=\"kto niechcial\"/> The final accident report would later conclude that the captain's knowledge of Russian was \"satisfactory.\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\nThe airport, which normally should have been closed due to the severe conditions, was not declared closed as its management feared that this could cause a diplomatic incident.<ref name=\"Wszyscy jeste\u015bmy winni tej tragedii\"/> According to the news agency Interfax, the pilot was told that Smolensk North Airport was enveloped in thick fog and strongly advised against landing, but still he decided to continue with the original flight plan and attempt a landing.<ref name=\"guardian1\"/> According to an interview with a flight controller Pavel Plusnin<ref name=\"lifenews-ru_interview\"/> it was suggested to the pilot that he land at an alternative airfield in Moscow or [[Minsk]]. According to Plusnin, the pilot said, that he would attempt one approach, and if landing was not possible, he would then divert to another airfield.<ref name=\"tvn_plusnin\"/>\n\nThere was some concern in the press as to whether or not Russian military ATC had the authority to issue military orders to ''PLF 101'',<ref name=\"PLF\"/> as the aircraft was a military flight. Under Russian law, military flights are under the control of Russian military ATC, and permission or denial for approach and landing must be given by the controller prior to these actions being undertaken by a flight crew.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The final accident report determined that, as a foreign military aircraft, Russian controllers did not have the authority to issue military orders to ''PLF 101'', and this had been communicated to the ATC personnel who handled the flight.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The \"trial\" approach was conducted with the understanding by ATC that all risk for such an approach was to be undertaken by ''PLF 101'' and not ATC.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\n===Theft from victims===\nOn 6 June 2010, it was reported that payments worth [[Euro|\u20ac]]1,400 had been made from a credit card found on the body of historian [[Andrzej Przewo\u017anik]], one of the victims of the crash. Credit cards belonging to the politician [[Aleksandra Natalli-\u015awiat]] were also missing, but not used in transactions.<ref name=\"thenews1\"/> On 8 June 2010, [[Information Telegraph Agency of Russia|ITAR-TASS]] reported that four soldiers of ''Unit 06755'' had been charged in connection with the theft, after being found in possession of three credit cards used to withdraw a total of 60,345 [[Russian Ruble|rubles]].<ref name=\"itar_tass\"/> A Polish spokesperson said that the first withdrawals using the cards had been made around two hours after the crash.<ref name=\"bbc_cards\"/> The Polish government admitted that the Russian soldiers involved in the theft were probably conscripts, and that earlier reports blaming members of Russia's [[OMON]] forces for the theft had been a mistake.<ref name=\"thenews2\"/>\n\n===Initial reports===\nAn initial report by [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]]' [[Interstate Aviation Committee]] ({{lang-ru|\u041c\u0435\u0436\u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u0432\u0438\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442 (MAK)}}) revealed that all three engines were operating normally, and that there was no fire or explosion before the aircraft crashed.<ref name=\"AH429ec5fa\"/> According to the newspaper Dziennik, Polish flight recorder ATM-[[Quick access recorder|QAR]] registered that precisely at 8:41:02.5 (Polish time) the tail of the aircraft separated. All systems of Tu-154 stopped working at 8:41:04. Fuel temperature was below {{convert|0|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Engines when the aircraft was above the road were at 60% of their nominal power (Tu-154 needs about 10 seconds to get 100% of power from engines). They also determined that the aircraft was {{convert|40|m|ft}} lower than it should have been.<ref name=\"dziennik4\"/>\n\nThe discrepancy among the time of the crash registered by MARS flight recorders (10:41:05.4), ATM-QAR recorder (10:41:04), and when electricity lines were cut by the crashing aircraft a second or two before the final crash (10:39:35) was never explained.<ref name=\"cables\"/>\n\nOn 19 May 2010, the preliminary report of the investigation into the crash was published. Alexei Morozov, the head of the technical commission of Russia's Interstate Aviation Committee, stated that the Tupolev Tu-154M had no mechanical faults, and that an air traffic control official at Smolensk North Airport had \"warned twice that visibility was 400 metres (1,312ft) and that were no conditions for landing\". The investigation ruled out a terrorist attack, explosion or fire on board the aircraft as the cause of the crash. It was also reported that the voices of two non-crew members were heard in the cockpit during the period leading up to the crash. One of the voices was identified by sources as the Polish Air Force Commander, Lieutenant General [[Andrzej B\u0142asik]].<ref name=\"bbc report\"/><ref name=\"boston globe\"/> However, according to the findings of the Polish prosecutor's office in January 2013, General B\u0142asik had not stayed in the cockpit and was a regular passenger.<ref name=\"wp\"/> The other voice was later identified as the Director of Protocol.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\nAccording to the Interstate Aviation Committee report from 19 May 2010, the aircraft first hit an {{convert|11|m|ft|adj=mid}} tree approximately {{convert|1100|m|ft|0|abbr=out}} from the runway. The aircraft was also off by {{convert|40|m|ft}} from the extended middle line of the runway. The [[Terrain awareness and warning system|TAWS]] alarm \"Pull up!\" was first sounded at {{convert|100|m|ft|0|abbr=out}}  altitude and then repeated several times before the crash. It was first sounded 18 seconds before hitting the tree and the crew attempted to abort landing 13 seconds later. Due to geographical relief the aircraft was actually {{convert|15|m|ft|0|abbr=out}}  below the runway at the time of the first impact.<ref name=\"MAK\"/>\n\nOn 26 May 2010, it was reported<ref name=\"rt-concl\"/> that [[pilot error]] had been identified as the reason for the crash. Edmund Klich, the head of the Polish investigative commission, stated in an interview \"Pretty much everything is clear right now and nearly all evidence has been gathered\". \"The pilots ignored the plane's automatic warnings and attempted an incredibly risky landing,\" Klich said.<ref name=\"rt-concl\"/> According to the report, the crew of the Tupolev Tu-154M failed to respond for 13 seconds when the plane's \"terrain approaching\" alarm warned that the aircraft was less than {{convert|100|m|ft}} from the ground. The aircraft attempted to pull up after hitting a {{convert|5|m|ft|adj=mid|-tall|spell=in}} [[birch]] tree, but part of the left wing had been sheared off in the impact. The aircraft then went into a roll before landing on its back and disintegrating five seconds later. Edmund Klich declined to speculate on whether the pilot had been placed under pressure to land, commenting, \"Psychologists will have to assess the stress levels the pilots were subjected to.\"<ref name=\"wsj2\"/>\n\nOn 1 June 2010, Poland's Interior Ministry published a transcript from the cockpit voice recorder of the crashed Tu-154M.<ref name=\"RT-recording\"/> The transcript confirmed earlier reports that the aircraft had attempted to land in bad weather against the advice of air traffic control and the plane's terrain awareness warning system.<ref name=\"krakow post\"/> At one point in the recording, [[Mariusz Kazana]], the Director of Diplomatic Protocol in the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Poland|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], enters the cockpit and was told by the pilot \"Sir, the fog is increasing. At the moment, under these conditions that we have now, we will not manage to land\" to which Kazana replies \"Well, then we have a problem.\"<ref name=\"pa news\"/>\n\nExpert commentators have noted that the flight navigator, who was listing the altitude readings on the transcript, was referring to the radar [[altimeter]] (which gives height above ground) rather than the pressure altimeter (which would provide the height relative to the level of the runway).<ref name=\"gazeta5\"/> Because the terrain rises up to the runway, this could have had the effect of causing the pilot to fly far too low. The Final Report confirms this is exactly what happened.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\nThe Russian report was published on 12 January 2011, and the Polish report was published on 29 July 2011. Both reports placed the majority of the blame for the accident on the pilots for descending too low without being able to see the ground. The Polish report also placed harsh criticism on the organization of Poland's special aviation regiment and its leaders, as well as finding deficiencies in the performance of the Russian air traffic controllers and in the airport's lighting and approach area. In Polish discourse, there remained wider questions and unease about the potential causes of the crash.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.pl/1/9/Artykul/130720,Opposition-party-welcomes-reopened-Smolensk-disaster-probe|title=Opposition party welcomes reopened Smolensk disaster probe|work=Polskie Radio dla Zagranicy|accessdate=3 August 2015}}</ref> This prompted a Warsaw court and a separate military investigation.

A copy of the report was sent to the Polish authorities, who had 60 days to comment, after which the report was published on 12 January 2011.<ref name=AH429ec5fa/>\n\nAfter the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC) report's publication, Poland stated that it was created in violation of Annex 13 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation because some requested documents or evidences were not provided by Russia<ref name=\"wiadomosci.onet.pl\"/><ref name=\"Onet.pl\"/> and, according to a Polish lawyer, because Polish comments to the final report were not agreed to nor fully applied.<ref name=\"onet\"/>\n\nThe final report noticed that the captain's [[electronic altimeter]] was set {{convert|170|m|ft}} higher than the actual position. This change was made after the aircraft began its final approach and soon after the first TAWS warning sounded.  All other altimeters on board were set correctly. The investigation also determined that the controller's radar screen was not calibrated correctly and showed the airplane as being {{convert|90\u2013150|m|ft}} closer to the runway than it actually was. Additionally, his radio calls to the crew regarding their distance to the runway were given in advance by an average of {{convert|500|m|ft}}.<ref name=\"Appendixes for MAK report\"/>\n\nAs part of their investigation, MAK conducted an experiment in a Tu-154M simulator to determine how late the crew could have gone around. \"The experiment confirmed that during approaches in conditions similar to the flight conditions of the T-154M ... with a similar flight profile with vertical speed of descent of 7\u20138&nbsp;m/s ... the aircraft characteristics guaranteed safe go around from the height of 40&nbsp;m (without taking into consideration the possible obstacles and terrain along the flight path).\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> Taking into consideration the terrain at Smolensk, the investigation determined the last moment a go-around maneuver would have been successful was coincident with the first officer calling \"Go around\" and briefly pulling the control column at {{convert|60|m|ft}}.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\n===Polish comments on the draft of the final report===\nOn the same day that the final report was published by MAK, Poland published its comments on the draft of the final report<ref name=\"Polish comments to draft of Final Report\"/> sent to MAK before. Poland stated that their comments were not taken into consideration. MAK did not include them in the report, but published this document on its website among other appendixes.<ref name=\"Appendixes for MAK report\"/> Poland also published a final version of MAK report with changes performed by MAK in reaction for Polish comments highlighted (red color means changes of text, blue means text addition).<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\nThe main points of Polish comments are:<ref name=\"Polish comments to draft of Final Report\"/>\n* A list of documents, evidence, and other information requested by Poland but not received from the Russian side (First table in document \"Lista Wystapien Strony Polskiej o Dokumentacje\", List of requests from Poland about documentation. Entry \"Nie otrzymano\" means \"Not received\").<ref name = \"Polish comments to draft of Final Report\"/> Sample of them: Standards of certification for usage of military airports on the Russian Federation territory, Instructions for flights in Smolensk area.\n* Poland notes that, according to international agreement between Poland and Russia from 1993, PLF 101 was classified in Poland as a military plane and should be treated as performing a military operation also on the territory of the Russian Federation, especially in non-classified airspace and during approaching a military airport without [[ICAO]] certification. During military operations the ATC can give orders to the crew about landing decisions as opposed to civilian flights where the ATC only gives recommendations, but where the final decision about landing is the pilots' responsibility.<ref name=\"Polish comments to draft of Final Report\"/>\n* Information that result of analysis of CVR (Cockpit Voice Recorder), performed by Polish Commission for the Investigation of National Aviation Accidents, says that first officer gives command \"go around\" at 100&nbsp;m altitude<ref name=\"Polish comments to draft of Final Report\"/><ref name=\"TU154m did not land\"/><ref name = \"TU154m did not land2\"/> This analysis has been ignored by MAK's final report.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n* Request for document confirmation that Commander of the Landing Zone was allowed to work in bad weather conditions. Documents confirm only admission for work at day and night in normal weather conditions.  Poland notices also that Commander of the Landing Zone had never before worked at Smolensk and in last 12 months performed this function only 7 times. All that information is in his testimony. There is no documentation which certificate Commander of the Landing Zone on Smolensk airport which is required by Russian Law.<ref name=\"Polish comments to draft of Final Report\"/>\n* Polish position that ATC gives wrong information for PLF 101 (\"on course, on glide slope\") and \"Level 101\" was given too late.<ref name=\"Polish comments to draft of Final Report\"/> According to Final Report at this moment plane was up to {{convert|15\u201320|m}} above runway level and {{convert|1400|m}} before runway begins.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n* Differences in approach card described by Final Report and approach card received by Poland before 10 April 2010 with information that Russia sent documents without information about reference system of coordinates in document. Poland assumed that coordinates are expressed using [[WGS-84]] which is worldwide standard. Current standard for reference system used in Russia (according to its own law regulation) is PZ-90 which differ from WGS-84 by less than {{convert|40|cm|0|abbr=on}} in any given direction.<ref name=\"Polish comments to draft of Final Report\"/>\n* Doubts about Smolensk compliance with Russian regulations because there were trees and other obstacles in an area 300 to 900&nbsp;m long before the runway. The heights of these obstacles are 15m higher than allowed (according to both Russian and ICAO regulations). After the accident, trees in this area were cut.<ref name = \"Polish comments to draft of Final Report\"/> The structure of flight PLF 101 began to be destroyed in that area.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n* Polish explanation that there is no requirement in Military aviation for aircraft to have insurance (''PLF 101'' was owned and maintained by the Polish Military) and even civil regulations allows other financial protections besides insurance. In the case of ''PLF 101'', the Polish National Treasury was financially responsible for the aircraft.<ref name=\"Polish comments to draft of Final Report\"/>\n* Polish explanation that, according to Polish law, Certificate of Airworthiness is required for civilian planes and is not obligatory for military machines&nbsp;\u2014 instead of this certificate, Polish military planes have to accomplish conditions regulated by \"Instrukcja s\u0142u\u017cby in\u017cynieryjno-lotniczej Lotnictwa Si\u0142 Zbrojnych RP\" (Instruction for engineering and aviation service of Aviation Forces in Republic of Poland). Poland also provides list of documents that confirm plane compliance with that document.<ref name=\"Polish comments to draft of Final Report\"/>\n* Information that Polish side had not received documentation of control flight over Smolensk nor documentation of RSP-6m2 radar system used in ATC.<ref name=\"Polish comments to draft of Final Report\"/>\n* Doubts about reliability of protocol after control flight which confirmed that light system (LUCZ-2MU) is working properly on Smolensk when MAK Final Report says it did not. Polish specialists were not allowed to be present during control flight.<ref name=\"Polish comments to draft of Final Report\"/>\n* Doubts about proper work of radar display according to protocol from control flight.<ref name=\"Polish comments to draft of Final Report\"/>\n* Request for source data to marker location on radar display described in Final Report. Information provided to Poland says that camera recorder in ATC was corrupted and there is no information about any other source data.<ref name=\"Polish comments to draft of Final Report\"/>\n* Request for information about 13 recorders mounted in ATC, and data recorded (even corrupted) for analysis. MAK states that camera, voice recorders and photo laboratory not worked properly and a lot of information was not saved.<ref name=\"Polish comments to draft of Final Report\"/>\n* Information that FCOM of Tu-154M in fact does not prescribe using the autopilot during non-precision approach, however this is also not forbidden.<ref name=\"Polish comments to draft of Final Report\"/>\n* Expressed lack of any document that confirms PLF 101's status under Russian law.<ref name=\"Polish comments to draft of Final Report\"/>\n* Request for source data and method of calculation of PLF 101's weight. Poland says that original documentation about loading and weight measure was destroyed.<ref name=\"Polish comments to draft of Final Report\"/>\n* Allegations that documents certifying the medical examination of air controllers had manual corrections and are inconsistent with their testimonies where they confirmed that medical point was closed on 10 April 2010.<ref name=\"Polish comments to draft of Final Report\"/>\n* Correction of number of specialists\u2014with list of their certifications\u2014that performed technical support on PLF 101<ref name=\"Polish comments to draft of Final Report\"/>\n\n===Polish publication of ATC tapes===\nAt an 18 January 2011 press conference, the Polish investigation made public the information contained in ATC recordings, and their analysis of such. They concluded that the \"on course, on glide path\" calls given to the pilots were made when the aircraft was actually off course, and furthermore the \"Level!\" call was given 11 seconds too late.<ref name=\"polish comments 1-18-11\"/>\n\n===MAK publication of ATC tapes===\nIn response to the Polish claims of publicity MAK published transcripts of ATC recordings on its website.<ref

2016}}</ref>{{better source|date=December 2017}} The transcripts show that communication between the ATC and PLF101 was done mostly in Russian with only a few English phrases.\n\n==Causes==\n\n===MAK report===\nThe MAK report found the \"immediate cause\" of the accident was the failure of the crew to make a timely decision to proceed to an alternate airport despite being warned multiple times of the poor weather conditions at Smolensk.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> Another immediate cause was the descent below minimums without visual contact with the ground as well as ignoring numerous TAWS warnings.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> This led to [[controlled flight into terrain]].<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> Additionally, the MAK report found an \"immediate cause\" of the accident was the presence in the cockpit of the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Air Force, which placed extreme [[Stress in the aviation industry|stress]] and \"psychological pressure\" on the Captain to \"continue descent in conditions of unjustified risk with a dominating aim of landing at any means.\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\nA \"contributing factor\" to the accident was a long discussion with the Protocol director and the crew of the Yak-40 regarding the actual weather and the impossibility of landing at Smolensk in such weather conditions.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> The report found this discussion caused the Captain to experience \"clash of motives.\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> On one hand he knew that landing in the reported weather conditions was unsafe.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> On the other hand, he faced strong motivation to land at Smolensk anyway.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> He expected a strong negative reaction from the President if he chose to divert the airplane and land at an alternate airport.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\nOther \"contributing factors\" were a lack of compliance with standard operating procedures, a lack of crew resource management, and a significant gap in bad weather flights by the PIC (he had not flown in weather conditions similar to Smolensk that day in four months).<ref name=\"Final Report\"/> Additional \"contributing factors\" were the Navigator calling out radar altitudes without considering the uneven terrain in the area, utilization of the autopilot and autothrottles much lower than minimum descent altitude which did not comply with the Flight Crew Operations Manual for the Tu-154, and the late start of the final descent which caused the crew to maintain a higher than normal vertical speed.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\nA \"systemic cause\" of the accident were \"significant shortcomings in the organization of flight operations, flight crew preparation and arrangement of the VIP flight in the special air regiment.\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>\n\n===Official Polish government report===\nThe Polish [[Committee for Investigation of National Aviation Accidents]] (KBWLLP) published its report on 29 July 2011,<ref name=\"komisja.smolensk.gov.pl\"/> also available in English and Russian.<ref name=\"final_polish_report\"/><ref name=\"final_polish_reportRU\"/> While the report stated that pilot error was the main cause of the accident, with the crew lacking adequate training in operating in adverse weather conditions, it differed from the Russian report in several aspects.\n\nChief among these differences was a conclusion that the pilots were not placed under pressure forcing them to land at Smolensk, and furthermore the crew did not want to land and after reaching 100m altitude (measured by radio altimeter) and had decided to go around using the autopilot.<ref name=\"final_polish_report\"/> However, it was impossible for the autopilot installed in the aircraft to conduct an automatic go-around from a non-precision approach.<ref name=\"final_polish_report\"/> The Polish investigation concluded this caused a delay in executing the go-around which contributed to the crash.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nAnother major difference was a conclusion that Russian air traffic control played a part in the accident by passing incorrect information to the crew regarding the plane's position. ATC gave distance callouts on average {{convert|500|m|ft}} in advance, and told the aircraft it was on the correct glidepath when it actually was not. Furthermore, the controllers gave the \"Level 101\" command ten seconds after the aircraft passed the {{convert|100|m|ft}} altitude where such call was supposed to be given.<ref name=\"final_polish_report\"/><ref name=\"BBC blame\"/><ref name=\"flight pol\"/>\n\nThe Polish report also found three deficiencies regarding the Smolensk airport which contributed to the crash. One was a large number of obstacles (mostly tall trees) in the area before the runway which should have been removed to keep the protected approach airspace clear of obstructions. The second deficiency was with the approach lighting system, which was charted incorrectly and not well maintained. Many bulbs were burned out, several others were missing their lenses, and others were obscured by shrubbery.<ref name=\"final_polish_report\"/> The third concern was with the airport information received by Poland, which contained incorrect information. In addition to the lighting system not being depicted correctly, the airport's location was charted approximately {{convert|116|m|ft}} to the North of its actual position.<ref name=\"final_polish_report\"/><ref name=\"Polish comments to draft of Final Report\"/>\n\nDue to numerous accusations raised by [[Law and Justice]] opposition party who rejected the official report's conclusions, a new commission was created in 2013, headed by [[Maciej Lasek]]. Its task was to publish and explain all the technical evidence used in the official report. Lasek commission's produced over a hundred very detailed technical reports, maps, transcripts, photos and videos which were originally published on ''www.faktysmolensk.gov.pl'' website.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Shortly after the [[2015 Polish parliamentary election]]s the website was shut down and all documents removed by the new government,<ref name=\"AP-Gera\" /> but were subsequently restored on an independent mirror.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nCause of accident according to Polish report:\n: The immediate cause of the accident was the descent below the minimum descent altitude at an excessive rate of descent in weather conditions which prevented visual contact with the ground, as well as a delayed execution of the go-around procedure. Those circumstances led to an impact on a terrain obstacle resulting in separation of a part of the left wing with aileron and consequently to the loss of aircraft control and eventual ground impact.<ref name=\"final_polish_report\"/>\n\nCircumstances contributing to the accident:<ref name=\"final_polish_report\"/>\n# Failure to monitor altitude by means of a pressure altimeter during a non-precision approach;\n# failure by the crew to respond to the PULL UP warning generated by the TAWS;\n# attempt to execute the go-around maneuver under the control of ABSU (automatic go-around);\n# Approach Control confirming to the crew the correct position of the airplane in relation to the RWY threshold, glide slope, and course which might have affirmed the crew's belief that the approach was proceeding correctly although the airplane was actually outside the permissible deviation margin;\n# failure by LZC to inform the crew about descending below the glide slope and delayed issuance of the level-out command;\n# incorrect training of the Tu-154M flight crews in the 36 Regiment.\n\nConducive circumstances:<ref name=\"final_polish_report\"/>\n# incorrect coordination of the crew's work, which placed an excessive burden on the aircraft commander in the final phase of the flight;\n# insufficient flight preparation of the crew;\n# the crew's insufficient knowledge of the airplane's systems and their limitations;\n# inadequate cross-monitoring among the crew members and failure to respond to the mistakes committed;\n# crew composition inadequate for the task;\n# ineffective immediate supervision of the 36 Regiment's flight training process by the Air Force Command;\n# failure by the 36 Regiment to develop procedures governing the crew's actions in the event of:\n#* failure to meet the established approach criteria;\n#* using radio altimeter for establishing alarm altitude values for various types of approach;\n#* distribution of duties in a multi-crew flight.\n# sporadic performance of flight support duties by LZC over the last 12 months, in particular under difficult WC, and lack of practical experience as LZC at the SMOLENSK NORTH airfield.\n\n==Notable passengers==\n{{see also|List of casualties of the 2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash}}\nIn addition to Kaczy\u0144ski and his wife Maria, and [[Ryszard Kaczorowski]], the former last President of Poland in exile, on board were the military [[Polish General Staff|chiefs of staff]] ([[Polish Land Forces|army]], [[Polish Air Force|air force]], [[Polish Navy|navy]]), the [[National Bank of Poland|national bank]] governor, a deputy foreign minister, head army chaplains of the Catholic and Orthodox churches, head of the [[National Security Bureau (Poland)|National Security Bureau]], three deputy [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland|parliament]] speakers, [[Polish Olympic Committee|Olympic Committee]] head, the [[Ombudsman|civil rights commissioner]] [[Janusz Kochanowski]], trade union activist [[Anna Walentynowicz]], and at least two presidential aides and widely known national lawmakers (including core members of the [[Law and Justice]] party).<ref name=\"yahoo\"/><ref name=\"mswia\"/>\n\n==Political aftermath==\nIn accordance with the [[Constitution of the Republic of Poland|Polish Constitution]], on the [[President of the Republic of Poland|President]]'s death his duties were taken on by the [[Marshal of the Sejm]] (speaker of the lower house of the parliament)\u2014at the time [[Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski]], who thus became [[Acting President of Poland]].<ref name=\"The Constitution of the Republic of Poland\"/> Within two weeks he was obliged to announce the date of the [[2010 Polish presidential election|popular presidential election]], to be held within a further 60 days on a weekend. Kaczy\u0144ski was up for re-election in late September or early October, before the end of his first five-year term.<ref name=\"constitution\"/>\n\nDespite the deaths of the president and numerous officials, the crash was not expected to [[Continuity of government|impair the functions of the Polish government]], since no cabinet ministers were aboard the plane. The [[Polish Armed Forces]] were dealt a severe blow, however, since all of their senior commanding officers were killed; their duties were automatically taken over by respective deputy commanders, following standard contingency plans for such a situation.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nThe commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre was split up because of the political conflict between the liberal-conservative government of [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]] [[Donald Tusk]] and national-conservative President Kaczy\u0144ski.<ref name=\"Dwie uroczysto\u015bci w Katyniu\"/>\nOn 7 April, Tusk, along with government officials and members of his [[Civic Platform]] party, went to Katyn<ref name=\"gazeta6\"/>\non invitation from the [[Prime Minister of Russia]], [[Vladimir Putin]].<ref name=\"Putin zaprosi\u0142 Tuska do Katynia\"/>\nThe official commemoration, organised by Polish [[Council for the Protection of Struggle and Martyrdom Sites]], was scheduled on 10 April. Nevertheless, both ruling coalition and opposition were represented on the plane, with six and nine members of the Sejm, as well as one and two from the Senate, respectively, some of them well known in Poland. Many passengers were actively opposed to Tusk's policies, including:\n* President Kaczy\u0144ski himself,\n* President of the [[National Bank of Poland]], [[S\u0142awomir Skrzypek]],<ref name=\"money\"/><ref name=\"bankier\"/>\n* Chief of the [[Institute of National Remembrance]], [[Janusz Kurtyka]],<ref name=\"Kurtyka krytykuje nowelizacj\u0119 ustawy o IPN\"/><ref name=\"Gazeta.pl\"/>{{Dead link|date=August 2011}}<ref name=\"Ustawa o IPN zmieniona, teraz kolej na prezydenta\"/>\n* [[Polish Ombudsman]] [[Janusz Kochanowski]],<ref name=\"wprost\"/>\n* [[Jerzy Szmajdzi\u0144ski]], the left-wing candidate<ref name=\"Szmajdzi\u0144ski kandydatem SLD na prezydenta\"/> in the upcoming presidential election.\n\nThe President of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers and former CIA analyst, [[S.

It was reported that over 100,000 mourners attended the event, held in [[Pi\u0142sudski Square]]; however, up to 1.5&nbsp;million had been expected.<ref name=\"guardian\"/><ref name=\"Trauerfeier f\u00fcr Absturzopfer in Warschau (International, NZZ Online)\"/>\n\n===State funeral===\n{{main|Death and state funeral of Lech and Maria Kaczy\u0144ski}}\nThe funeral service for the presidential couple took place in [[St. Mary's Basilica, Krak\u00f3w|Saint Mary's Basilica]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]] on 18 April. The couple were buried in a crypt below [[Wawel Cathedral]], a place traditionally reserved for people considered to be heroes of Polish history.<ref name=\"upi\"/>\n\n===Presidential election===\n{{main|2010 Polish presidential election}}\nThe first round of the election to elect President Kaczy\u0144ski's successor was held on 20 June 2010. Since no candidate obtained an absolute majority, a run-off was held on 4 July 2010, between the two highest-polling candidates: the acting president [[Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski]], and the late president's brother [[Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski]].<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\"/> While commentators noted that PiS gained some sympathy votes, it was not seen as a decisive factor in the election.<ref name=\"reuters\"/><ref name=\"www\"/><ref name=\"economist\"/> In the second round of the election, Komorowski defeated Kaczy\u0144ski with 53% of the vote.<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\"/>\n\n===VIP flight reorganisation===\nFollowing the publication of the Polish Accident report, the 36th Special Aviation Regiment which operated the flight was disbanded, and 13 Polish military officers were dismissed. Most Polish officials were instructed to fly on regular civilian flights. Two [[Embraer 170]]s were retained for government VIPs, but were flown by civilian pilots and operated by [[LOT Polish Airlines]]. The remaining aircraft from the regiment, including the surviving Tu-154, were sold.<ref name=\"36. pu\u0142k specjalny zosta\u0142 zlikwidowany\"/>\n\n==Reactions==\n\n===Poland===\n[[File:Warsaw National Tragedy 2010-04-10 (4).jpg|thumb|Crowds on the [[Royal Route, Warsaw]]]]\n[[File:Lublin after president Lech Kaczy\u0144ski's plane crash, New Town Hall (02).jpg|thumb|Flowers and candles in front of [[Lublin]] town hall]]\nIn Poland, the public reacted with shock and grief to the disaster. Almost immediately after the news broke, tens of thousands of Poles assembled at the [[Presidential Palace, Warsaw|Presidential Palace]] to lay tributes, including flowers, wreaths, and candles.\n\nA week of national mourning was declared in Poland.<ref name=\"CBC-1\" /> Poles around the world mourned Kaczy\u0144ski and set up shrines in the week that followed.<ref name=\"CBC-1\" /><ref name=\"Poland bleeds anew\" /><ref name=\"Across the U.S., Polish-Americans Mourn Crash\"/> Many wept openly.<ref name=\"Poland mourns President's death\"/> Flags flew at half mast in Poland.<ref name=\"Poland struggles to absorb news\"/> Sports fixtures, including women's U-17 UEFA Championship elite qualifying phase game [[Poland national football team|Poland]] versus [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] in [[Ukraine]], were postponed.<ref name=\"Rep of Ireland v Poland is postponed\"/><ref name=\"They were wiped out.

The establishing of the cross provoked controversy in [[Poland]], mainly related to questions concerning the [[separation of church and state]]. Polish [[Catholic]]s wanted the cross to permanently remain in front of the palace, while others, including Komorowski, wanted it moved to [[St. Anne's Church, Warsaw|St. Anne's Church]]. After a summer of protests over the cross, it was transferred to the church on 16 September.\n\nA public noon commemoration ceremony in Warsaw's [[Pi\u0142sudski Square]] was attended by more than 100,000 people on 17 April.

Tusk knelt and briefly hid his face in his hands, then stood up as Putin patted him on the shoulder. The two hugged, then gave a joint press conference on the investigation into the crash. Polish commentators noted this was a human gesture, and a display of emotion that Poles had longed to see from their eastern neighbours.<ref name=\"Maslikowski11Apr2010\" />\n\nOn 11 April, holding a bouquet of red roses, Putin was reported to have appeared truly distressed as he escorted Kaczy\u0144ski's body to a Warsaw-bound plane. Later Putin said in a Polish television interview: \"This is of course first and foremost Poland's tragedy and that of the Polish people, but it is also our tragedy. We mourn with you\".<ref name=Berry13Apr2010 />\n\nThe Russian response has been noted favourably by Poles, with talk of a thawing in the [[Poland\u2013Russia relations|relationship between Russia and Poland]].<ref name=\"BBC8615945\" /> Witold Waszczykowski, deputy head of Poland's [[National Security Bureau (Poland)|National Security Bureau]], told Reuters, \"We did not expect this gentle, kind approach, this personal involvement from Putin. Naturally it will have a positive impact on the relationship between our countries.\" [[Jerzy Bahr]], the [[Polish ambassador to Russia]] also stated, \"We can sense Russian solidarity at every step of the way.\"<ref name=\"BBC8614685\" />\n\nAs part of this thawing of relations, on 28 April 18 days after the crash, Russia's state Archive publicly published a number of previously secret files on the Katyn massacre on their website. The files were declassified in the early 1990s, but before their publication they were only available to specialized researchers.<ref name=\"Russia publishes previously secret files on 1940 Katyn massacre\" />\n\nThe strongest admission was yet to come. On 26 November 2010, the Russian [[State Duma]] passed a resolution admitting that Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] personally approved the Katyn massacre.<ref name=\"Stalin and Katyn\" /> The Soviets had long claimed Nazi Germany were the ones responsible.<ref name=\"Stalin and Katyn\" /> Although this stance changed in 1990 when [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] admitted the Soviet NKVD secret police carried out the massacre, the November 2010 resolution was the first time the Russian government admitted direct involvement by Stalin.<ref name=\"Stalin and Katyn\" />\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Rzeczpospolita (newspaper)|Rzeczpospolita]]'', [[Andrei Illarionov]], Vladimir Putin's former advisor, noted, \"... contrary to the promises, the investigation of this crash is neither transparent nor dynamic.\" and added, \"... the Polish side does not have full and free access to documents and evidence.\" Illarionov was also one of the signatories of an open letter written by Russian dissidents, which voiced concerns about the conduct of the investigation.
