The team crowned its season by rolling over the [[American Football League|AFL]] champion [[1966 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] 35\u201310 in [[Super Bowl I]].\n\n====1967: Super Bowl II, and Lombardi's departure====\nThe [[1967 NFL season|1967 season]] was the last for Lombardi as the Packers' head coach.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/coaches/LombVi0.htm|title=Vince Lombardi Record, Statistics, and Category Ranks {{!}} Pro-Football-Reference.com|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|access-date=August 1, 2018}}</ref> The [[NFL Championship Game, 1967|NFL Championship game]], a rematch of the 1966 contest against Dallas, became indelibly known as the \"Ice Bowl\" as a result of the brutal conditions at [[Lambeau Field]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2017/12/28/ap-was-there-1967-cowboys-packers-ice-bowl-game/108970804/|title=AP Was There: 1967 Cowboys-Packers Ice Bowl game|work=USA Today|access-date=August 1, 2018}}</ref> Still, the coldest NFL game ever played, it remains one of the most famous football games at any level in the history of the sport.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/specials/100-greatest/?q=55-the-ice-bowl|title=The 100 Greatest Moments in Sports History {{!}} The Ice Bowl|website=Sports Illustrated's 100 Greatest Moments|access-date=August 1, 2018}}</ref> With 16 seconds left, [[Bart Starr]]'s touchdown on a quarterback sneak brought the Packers a 21\u201317 victory and their still unequaled third straight NFL Championship. They then won [[Super Bowl II]] with a 33\u201314 victory over the [[Oakland Raiders]]. Lombardi stepped down as head coach after the game, and Phil Bengtson was named his successor. Lombardi remained as general manager for one season but left in 1969 to become head coach and minority owner of the [[Washington Redskins]].\n\nAfter Lombardi died of cancer on September 3, 1970, the NFL renamed the Super Bowl trophy the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]] in recognition of his accomplishments with the Packers. The city of [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]] renamed Highland Avenue in his honor in 1968, placing [[Lambeau Field]] at 1265 Lombardi Avenue ever since.\n\n===1968\u20131991: Post-Lombardi and decline===\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 16 - Eddie Lee Ivery.jpg|thumb|right|The Packers, pictured against Cardinals in the [[1982\u201383 NFL playoffs|1982\u201383 playoffs]], only qualified for the postseason twice during the team's post-Lombardi \"dark ages\" (1969\u201391).]]\nFor about a quarter-century after Lombardi's departure, the Packers had relatively little on-field success. In the 24 seasons from 1968 to 1991, they had only five seasons with a winning record, one being the shortened [[1982 NFL season|1982 strike season]]. They appeared in the playoffs twice, with a 1\u20132 record. The period saw five different head coaches&nbsp;\u2013 [[Phil Bengtson]], [[Dan Devine]], [[Bart Starr]], [[Forrest Gregg]], and [[Lindy Infante]]&nbsp;\u2013 two of whom, Starr and Gregg, were Lombardi's era stars, while Bengtson was a former Packer coach. Each led the Packers to a worse record than his predecessor. Poor personnel decisions were rife, notoriously the 1974 trade by acting general manager Dan Devine which sent five 1975 or 1976 draft picks (two first-rounders, two-second-rounders and a third) to the [[Los Angeles Rams]] for aging quarterback [[John Hadl]], who would spend only 1{{sfrac|1|2}} seasons in Green Bay.<ref>[http://www2.jsonline.com:80/packer/insider/history/oldschool/ Old School Packers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218153613/http://www2.jsonline.com/packer/insider/history/oldschool/ |date=February 18, 2006 }} from the [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] website.

He had his No. 4 jersey retired by the Packers in 2015.]]\nThe Packers' performance in the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s led to a shakeup, with [[Ron Wolf]] hired as general manager and given full control of the team's football operations to start the 1991 season. In 1992, Wolf hired [[San Francisco 49ers]] offensive coordinator [[Mike Holmgren]] as the Packers' new head coach.\n\nSoon afterward, Wolf acquired quarterback [[Brett Favre]] from the [[Atlanta Falcons]] for a first-round pick. Favre got the Packers their first win of the 1992 season, stepping in for injured quarterback [[Don Majkowski]] and leading a comeback over the [[1992 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]]. He started the following week, a win against the [[1992 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]], and never missed another start for Green Bay through the end of the 2007 season. He would go on to break the [[Most consecutive starts by a quarterback (NFL)|record]] for consecutive starts by an NFL quarterback, starting 297 consecutive games including stints with the [[New York Jets]] and [[Minnesota Vikings]] with the [[Most consecutive starts (NFL)|streak]] finally coming to an end [[Brett Favre#Consecutive starts streak|late in the 2010 season]].\n\nThe [[1992 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] had a 9\u20137 record in [[1992 NFL season|1992]], and began to turn heads around the league when they signed perhaps the most prized free agent in NFL history in [[Reggie White]] on the defense in 1993. White believed that Wolf, Holmgren, and Favre had the team heading in the right direction with a \"total commitment to winning.\" With White on board the Packers made it to the second round of the playoffs during both the [[1993 NFL season|1993]] and [[1994 NFL season|1994]] seasons but lost their 2nd-round matches to their playoff rival, the Dallas Cowboys, playing in Dallas on both occasions. In [[1995 NFL season|1995]], the [[1995 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] won the NFC Central Division championship for the first time since 1972. After a home playoff 37\u201320 win against Favre's former team, the Atlanta Falcons, the Packers defeated the defending Super Bowl champion [[1995 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] 27\u201317 in San Francisco on the road to advance to the [[NFC Championship Game]], where they lost again to the [[1995 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] 38\u201327.\n\n====1996: Super Bowl XXXI champions====\n[[File:19981213 28 Reggie White, Lambeau Field.jpg|thumb|Reggie White in 1998. White is widely considered one of the greatest defensive players in NFL history, and had his number retired by the Packers in 2005]]\nIn [[1996 NFL season|1996]], the [[1996 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]]' turnaround was complete. The team posted a league-best 13\u20133 record in the regular season, dominating the competition and securing home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. They were ranked no. 1 in offense with [[Brett Favre]] leading the way, no. 1 in defense with Reggie White as the leader of the defense and no. 1 in special teams with former [[Heisman Trophy]] winner [[Desmond Howard]] returning punts and kickoffs for touchdowns. After relatively easy wins against the [[1996 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]] in a muddy 35\u201314 beatdown and [[1996 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]] 30\u201313, the Packers advanced to the Super Bowl for the first time in 29 years. In [[Super Bowl XXXI]], Green Bay defeated the [[1996 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] 35\u201321 to win their 12th world championship. [[Desmond Howard]] was named MVP of the game for his kickoff return for a touchdown that ended the Patriots' bid for a comeback. Then-Packers president [[Bob Harlan]] credited Wolf, Holmgren, Favre, and White for ultimately changing the fortunes of the organization and turning the Green Bay Packers into a model NFL franchise. A 2007 panel of football experts at [[ESPN]] ranked the 1996 Packers the 6th-greatest team ever to play in the Super Bowl.\n\n====1997: defeat in Super Bowl XXXII====\nThe following season the [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] recorded another 13\u20133 record and won their second consecutive NFC championship. After defeating the [[1997 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] 21\u20137 and [[1997 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] 23\u201310 in the playoffs, the Packers returned to the Super Bowl as an 11{{sfrac|1|2}} point favorite. The team ended up losing in an upset to [[John Elway]] and the [[1997 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] in [[Super Bowl XXXII]], by the score of 31\u201324.\n\n====1998: Holmgren's last season====\n[[File:19981213 24 Mike Holmgren, Lambeau Field,.jpg|thumb|Holmgren, one of three Packer coaches to win a Super Bowl, pictured in 1998]]\nIn [[1998 NFL season|1998]], the [[1998 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] went 11\u20135 and met the [[1998 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] in the first-round of the NFC playoffs. It was the fourth consecutive year these teams had met in the playoffs and the sixth overall contest since the 1995 season. The Packers had won all previous games, and the media speculated that another 49ers loss would result in the dismissal of San Francisco head coach [[Steve Mariucci]]. Unlike the previous playoff matches, this game was hotly contested, with the teams frequently exchanging leads. With 4:19 left in the 4th quarter, Brett Favre and the Packers embarked on an 89-yard drive, which concluded with a Favre touchdown pass to receiver [[Antonio Freeman]]. This play appeared to give Green Bay the victory. But San Francisco quarterback [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]] led the 49ers on an improbable touchdown drive, which culminated when [[Terrell Owens]] caught Young's pass between several defenders to give the 49ers a lead with three seconds remaining. Afterwards, the game was mired in controversy. Many argued that during the 49ers game-winning drive, Niners receiver [[Jerry Rice]] fumbled the ball but officials stated he was down by contact. Television replays confirmed the fumble, but referees were unable to review the play; the next season the NFL reinstituted an instant replay system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs98/news/1999/990103/01025866.html|title=ESPN.com: Instant replay comes back to haunt Holmgren|publisher=ESPN|access-date=August 1, 2018}}</ref> In the end, this game turned out to be the end of an era in Green Bay. Days later Mike Holmgren left the Packers to become vice president, general manager and head coach of the [[Seattle Seahawks]]. Much of Holmgren's coaching staff went with him, and [[Reggie White]] also retired after the season (but later played one season for the [[Carolina Panthers]] in 2000).\n\n====1999: Ray Rhodes' one-year tenure====\nIn 1999, the team struggled to find an identity after the departure of so many of the individuals responsible for their Super Bowl run. [[Ray Rhodes]] was hired in 1999 as the team's new head coach. Rhodes had served around the league as a highly regarded defensive coordinator and more recently experienced moderate success as head coach of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] from 1995 to 1998. Ron Wolf believed that Rhodes' experience and player-friendly demeanor would fit nicely in Green Bay's veteran locker room, but Rhodes was fired after one 8\u20138 [[1999 Green Bay Packers season|season]]. Wolf visited team practice late in the 1999 season and believed that players had become too comfortable with Rhodes' style, and said the atmosphere resembled a country club.\n\n=====2000\u201305: Mike Sherman as head coach=====\n[[File:MikeSherman2003.jpg|thumb|left|Coach Mike Sherman, pictured in 2003]]\nIn 2000, Wolf replaced Rhodes with [[Mike Sherman]]. Sherman had never been a head coach at any level of football and was relatively unknown in NFL circles. He had only coached in professional football for three years starting as the Packers' tight ends coach in 1997 and 1998. In 1999, he followed Mike Holmgren to Seattle and became the Seahawks' offensive coordinator, although Sherman did not call the plays during games. Despite Sherman's apparent anonymity, Wolf was blown away in the interview process by the coach's organizational skills and attention to detail. Sherman's inaugural season started slowly, but the Packers won their final four games to achieve a 9\u20137 record. Brett Favre praised the atmosphere Sherman had cultivated in Green Bay's locker room and fans were optimistic about the team's future. In the offseason, however, Wolf suddenly announced his own resignation as general manager to take effect after the April 2001 draft. Packers' president Bob Harlan was surprised by Wolf's decision and felt unsure of how to replace him. Harlan preferred the structure Green Bay had employed since 1991; a general manager who ran football operations and hired a subservient head coach. But with the momentum and locker room chemistry that was built during the 2000 season, Harlan was reluctant to bring in a new individual with a potentially different philosophy. Wolf recommended that Harlan give the job to Sherman. Though Harlan was wary of the structure in principle, he agreed with Wolf that it was the best solution. In 2001, Sherman assumed the duties of both general manager and head coach.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2004, Sherman coached the Packers to respectable regular-season success, led by the spectacular play of Brett Favre, [[Ahman Green]], and a formidable offensive line. But Sherman's teams faltered in the playoffs. Prior to 2003, the Packers had never lost a home playoff game since the NFL instituted a post-season in 1933 (they were 13\u20130, with 11 of the wins at Lambeau and two more in Milwaukee.). That ended January 4, 2003, when the [[2002 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] defeated the [[2002 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] 27\u20137 in an NFC Wild Card game. The Packers would also lose at home in the playoffs to the [[2004 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] two years later.\n\nBy the end of the 2004 season, the Packers team depth appeared to be diminishing. Sherman also seemed overworked and reportedly had trouble communicating with players on the practice field with whom he was also negotiating contracts. Harlan felt the dual roles were too much for one man to handle and removed Sherman from the general manager position in early 2005 while retaining him as a head coach. Harlan hired the Seattle Seahawks' vice president of operations [[Ted Thompson]] as the new executive vice president, general manager and director of football operations. The relationship between Thompson and Sherman appeared strained, as Thompson immediately began rebuilding Green Bay's roster. Following a dismal 4\u201312 season, Thompson fired Sherman.\n\n====2006\u201307: McCarthy arrives, Favre departs====\n[[File:Donald Driver - October 24, 2010.jpg|right|thumb|Former Packers wide-receiver [[Donald Driver]]]]\nIn 2006, Thompson hired [[Mike McCarthy (American football)|Mike McCarthy]], the former [[offensive coordinator]] for the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and [[New Orleans Saints]] as his new head coach. McCarthy had also previously served as the [[quarterbacks coach]] for the Packers in 1999.\n\nAfter missing the playoffs in 2006, Brett Favre announced that he would return for the 2007 season; it would turn out to be one of his best. The Packers won 10 of their first 11 games and finished 13\u20133, earning a first-round bye in the playoffs. The Packers' passing offense, led by Favre and a very skilled wide receiver group, finished second in the NFC, behind the Dallas Cowboys, and third overall in the league. Running back [[Ryan Grant (running back)|Ryan Grant]], acquired for a sixth-round draft pick from the New York Giants, became the featured back in Green Bay and rushed for 956 yards and 8 touchdowns in the final 10 games of the regular season. In the divisional playoff round, in a heavy snowstorm, the Packers beat the Seattle Seahawks 42\u201320. Grant rushed for 201 yards and three touchdowns, while Favre tossed an additional three touchdown passes to receiver [[Donald Driver]] (as well as a snowball, which Favre memorably threw at Driver in celebration).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Walker |first1=Ben |title=Playful Favre accurate even with snowball |url=https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2008/01/13/playful-favre-accurate-even-with-snowball/ |website=East Bay Times |accessdate=May 30, 2018 |date=January 13, 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn January 20, 2008, Green Bay appeared in their first NFC Championship Game in 10 years facing the [[2007 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] in Green Bay. The game was lost 23\u201320 on an overtime field goal by [[Lawrence Tynes]]. This would be [[Brett Favre]]'s final game as a Green Bay Packer with his final pass being an interception in overtime.\n\n[[Mike McCarthy (American football)|Mike McCarthy]] coached the [[National Football Conference|NFC]] team during the [[2008 Pro Bowl]] in Hawaii. [[Al Harris (cornerback)|Al Harris]] and [[Aaron Kampman]] were also picked to play for the NFC Pro Bowl team as starters. [[Donald Driver]] was named as a third-string wideout on the Pro Bowl roster. [[Brett Favre]] was named the first-string quarterback for the NFC, but he declined to play in the Pro Bowl and was replaced on the roster by [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers|Tampa Bay]] [[quarterback]] [[Jeff Garcia]]. The Packers also had several first alternates, including [[offensive tackle]] [[Chad Clifton]] and [[linebacker]] [[Nick Barnett]].\n\nIn December 2007, [[Ted Thompson]] was signed to a 5-year contract extension with the Packers. In addition, on February 5, 2008, head coach Mike McCarthy signed a 5-year contract extension.\n\n===2008\u2013present: Aaron Rodgers era===\n\n====2008: Transition====\n{{Main|2008 Green Bay Packers season}}\n[[Image:Aaron Rodgers 2008 (cropped).jpg|upright|thumb|240px|Quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]] in 2008.]]\n\nOn March 4, 2008, [[Brett Favre]] announced his retirement. Within five months, however, he filed for reinstatement with the NFL on July 29. Favre's petition was granted by Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]], effective August 4, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3517219|title=NFL grants Favre reinstatement; sources say QB job is open|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=August 3, 2008|date=August 3, 2008}}</ref> On August 6, 2008, it was announced that Brett Favre was traded to the [[New York Jets]] for a conditional draft pick in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/8381934/Packers-trade-Favre-to-Jets |title=Packers trade Favre to Jets |accessdate=August 6, 2008 |author=Jay Glazer |authorlink=Jay Glazer |date=August 6, 2008 |work=Fox Sports on MSN |quote=The month-long saga has finally come to an end, with the Packers agreeing to trade their future Hall-of-Fame quarterback to the New York Jets, Fox Sports.com has learned. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819213402/http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/8381934/Packers-trade-Favre-to-Jets |archivedate=August 19, 2008  }}</ref>\n\nThe Packers began their [[2008 NFL season|2008 season]] with their 2005 first-round draft pick, quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]], under center, as the first QB other than Favre to start for the Packers in 16 years. Rodgers played well in his first year starting for the Packers, throwing for over 4,000 yards and 28 touchdowns. However, injuries plagued the Packers' defense, as they lost 7 close games by 4 points or less, finishing with a 6\u201310 record. After the season, eight assistant coaches were dismissed by McCarthy, including Bob Sanders, the team's defensive coordinator, who was replaced by [[Dom Capers]].\n\n====2009: Return to the playoffs====\n{{Main|2009 Green Bay Packers season}}\nIn March 2009, the organization assured fans that Brett Favre's jersey number would be retired, but not during the 2009 season. In April 2009, the Packers selected defensive lineman [[B. J. Raji]] of Boston College as the team's first pick in the draft. The team then traded three draft picks (including the pick the Packers acquired from the Jets for Brett Favre) for another first-round pick, selecting linebacker [[Clay Matthews III]] of the [[University of Southern California]].\n\nDuring the [[2009 NFL season]], two match-ups between the franchise and its former quarterback Brett Favre were highly anticipated after Favre's arrival with the division-rival Vikings in August. The first encounter took place in Week 4, on a [[Monday Night Football]] game which broke several TV audience records. The scheduling of this game was made possible when Baseball Commissioner and Packer board of directors member [[Bud Selig]] forced baseball's [[Minnesota Twins]] to play 2 games within a 12-hour span. The Vikings won the game 30\u201323. [[Brett Favre]] threw 3 TDs, no interceptions, and had a passer rating of 135.<ref name=\"nfl.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/players/gamelogs?id=FAV540222 |title=Brett Favre: Game Logs at |publisher=National Football League  |accessdate=February 7, 2011}}</ref> The teams met for a second time in Week 8, Favre leading the Vikings to a second win, 38\u201326, in Green Bay. Rodgers was heavily pressured in both games, being sacked 14 times total, but still played well, throwing five touchdowns and only one interception. The next week, the Packers were upset by the win-less [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. Following a players-only meeting, the team found some stability on the offensive line with the return of tackle [[Mark Tauscher]] bringing a minor halt to sacks to Rodgers and opening the running game to [[Ryan Grant (running back)|Ryan Grant]] and the other running backs. Green Bay finished the season strongly, winning 7 out of their last 8 games, including winning their 16th regular season finale in the past 17 seasons, and earning a NFC wild-card playoff bid with an 11\u20135 regular-season record. The Packers defense was ranked No. 2 and the offense was ranked No. 6 with rookies [[Brad Jones (American football)|Brad Jones]] and [[Clay Matthews III]] becoming sensations at linebacker and young players like [[James Jones (wide receiver)|James Jones]], [[Brandon Jackson (American football)|Brandon Jackson]], [[Jermichael Finley]] and [[Jordy Nelson]] becoming threats on offense. Rodgers also became the first quarterback in NFL history to throw for at least 4,000 yards in each of his first two seasons as a starter. Also, cornerback [[Charles Woodson]] won [[NFL Defensive Player of the Year]] honors after recording 9 interceptions, forcing four fumbles, 3 touchdowns and registering 74 tackles and 2 sacks. In fact, Woodson's 9 interceptions were more than the 8 collected by all Packer opponents that season. Though the defense was ranked high, injuries to [[Al Harris (cornerback)|Al Harris]], [[Tramon Williams]], [[Will Blackmon]], [[Atari Bigby]] and [[Brandon Underwood]] severely limited the depth of the secondary and teams like the [[Minnesota Vikings]] and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] used that to their advantage by unleashing aerial assaults against inexperienced players with the NFL's best receivers. The season ended with an overtime loss in a [[2010 NFL Playoffs#Wild Card playoffs|wild card round]] shootout at the [[Arizona Cardinals]], 51\u201345.\n\n====2010: Super Bowl XLV championship====\n{{Main|2010 Green Bay Packers season}}\n[[File:Mike McCarthy (TJG).JPG|thumb|Former [[Super Bowl]] winning Packers head coach [[Mike McCarthy (American football)|Mike McCarthy]]]]\n\nThe team lost [[Johnny Jolly]] to a season-long suspension after he violated the NFL drug policy.

He was given $500 for uniforms and equipment in return for the team being named for its sponsor. An early newspaper article referred to the fledglings as \"the Indians\", but by the time they played their first game \"Packers\" had taken hold.\n\nIndian Packing was purchased in 1920 by the Acme Packing Company. Acme continued to support the team, which played its first NFL season with \"ACME PACKERS\" emblazoned on its jerseys.\n\n===Team colors===\nLambeau, a [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] alumnus, borrowed its [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Irish]]'s navy blue and gold team colors, much as [[George Halas]] borrowed his [[University of Illinois|Illinois]] alma mater's for the [[Chicago Bears]]. As a result, the early Packers were often referred to as the \"Bays\" or the \"Blues\" (and even occasionally as \"the Big Bay Blues\").\n\nBy 1950, Green Bay replaced navy blue with kelly green, but kept what was by then a lighter shade of athletic gold. Navy blue was kept as a secondary color, seen primarily on sideline capes, but was quietly dropped on all official materials shortly thereafter. In 1958, this kelly green was replaced by a darker hunter green; it and athletic gold have served as the team colors since. The team's current uniform combination of forest green or white jerseys and metallic gold pants was adopted soon after Vince Lombardi arrived in 1959. However, to celebrate the NFL's 75th anniversary in 1994, the Packers joined in a league-wide donning of \"throwback\" jerseys, back to navy blue and gold. The team would go throwback again for two Thanksgiving Day games against the [[Detroit Lions]], in blue and gold 1930s-era uniforms in 2001, and 1960s green and gold (only slightly different from the current ones) in 2003.<ref>[http://www.packers.com/history/fast_facts/uniform_history/ Packers Uniform History, 1921\u20132004] from Packers.com.

Indeed, County Stadium had been built partly to entice the Packers to move to Milwaukee full-time. The Packers worked to capture their growing fan base in Milwaukee and the larger crowds. By the 1960s, threat of an [[American Football League]] franchise in Milwaukee prompted the Packers to stay, including scheduling a [[NFL playoffs, 1967#Conference championships|Western Conference Playoff]] in 1967.\n\nCounty Stadium was built primarily as a baseball stadium and made only the bare minimum adjustments to accommodate football. At its height, it only seated 56,000 people, just barely above the NFL minimum; many of those seats were badly obstructed. The field was just barely large enough to fit a football field. Both teams shared the same sideline (separated by a piece of tape) and the end zones extended onto the [[warning track]]. By 1994, improvements and seating expansions at Lambeau, along with the Brewers preparing to campaign for their [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|new stadium]] prompted the Packers to play their full slate in Green Bay for the first time in 62 years. Former season ticketholders for the Milwaukee package continue to receive preference for one pre-season and the second and fifth regular-season games at Lambeau Field each season, along with playoff games through a lottery under the \"Gold Package\" plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.packers.com/tickets/season-tickets.html|title=Green & Gold Package Scheduling|publisher=Packers.com|accessdate=August 22, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Packers have three practice facilities across the street from Lambeau Field: the [[Don Hutson Center]], an indoor facility; [[Ray Nitschke Field]], an outdoor field with artificial [[FieldTurf]]; and [[Clarke Hinkle Field]], an outdoor field with natural grass.\n\n==Statistics and records==\n{{Main|Green Bay Packers records}}\n\n===Season-by-season results===\nThis is a partial list of the Packers' last five completed seasons.

[[NFL blackout]] restrictions for the team apply within both areas. However, Packers games have not been blacked out locally since [[1972 NFL season|1972]] (the last year home game local telecasts were prohibited regardless of sellout status) due to strong home attendance and popularity. As mentioned above, every Packers home game\u2014preseason, regular season and playoffs\u2014has been sold out since 1960.\n\n===Radio===\nThe [[flagship station]] of the [[Packers Radio Network]] is [[Good Karma Brands]]'s [[WTMJ (AM)|WTMJ]] in Milwaukee, which was the former flagship of the [[Journal Media Group|Journal Broadcast Group]] before its merger with [[E. W. Scripps Company]] in April 2015; Scripps itself sold their Milwaukee radio assets to GKB in November 2018, including the Packers Radio Network. WTMJ has aired Packers games since 1929, the longest association between a radio station and an NFL team to date, and the only rights deal in American professional sports where a station outside of the team's main metro area is the radio flagship. While this might be unusual, the station can be heard at city-grade strength at all hours in Green Bay proper. Games air in Green Bay on [[WTAQ]] (1360/97.5) and [[WIXX-FM]] (101.1), and [[WAPL]] (105.7) and [[WHBY]] (1150) in [[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]] and the [[Fox Cities]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.packers.com/gameday/packers_radio_network/station_listing/ |title=Packers Radio Station Listing |publisher=Packers.com |accessdate=February 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102043312/http://packers.com/gameday/packers_radio_network/station_listing/ |archive-date=January 2, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Wayne Larrivee]] is the play-by-play announcer and [[Larry McCarren]] is the color analyst.

When victory is assured for the Packers, either a game-winning touchdown, interception or a crucial 4th down defensive stop, Larrivee's trademark declaration of \"And there is your dagger!\" signifies the event. In limited circumstances where the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] are in either playoff or post-season contention and their play-by-play takes priority, WTMJ's sister FM station [[WKTI]] (94.5) currently airs Packer games to avert game conflicts. Surrounding pre-game programming is also carried on sister station [[WAUK]] (540), an [[ESPN Radio]] affiliate and former competitor which produced unofficial Packers programming for years.\n\n===Television===\nThe TV rights for pre-season games, not nationally broadcast are held by Scripps television stations [[WGBA-TV]] (Channel 26) in Green Bay and [[WTMJ-TV]] (Channel 4) in Milwaukee,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/sports/141227143.html|title=Packers and Journal Broadcast Group announce partnership deal|last=Wolfley|first=Bob|date=March 2, 2012|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|accessdate=March 3, 2012}}</ref> along with [[Quincy Media]]'s six [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] stations in the central, northern and western parts of the state, [[KQDS-TV]] (Channel 21) in [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]]-[[Superior, Wisconsin|Superior]], and in [[Escanaba, Michigan|Escanaba]]/[[Marquette, Michigan]], [[WLUC-TV]] (Channel 6), along with their [[WLUC-DT2|Fox subchannel]]. As such, these stations are authorized to use the tagline ''Your official Packers station'' in their market area by the team, and also carry two weeknight programs; ''Packers Live'' on Tuesday evening, and the weekly coach's show, ''The Matt LaFleur Show'' on Wednesday evenings at 6:30&nbsp;pm throughout the football season. Until the end of the 2011 season, the team's partner in Green Bay was [[WFRV-TV]] (Channel 5), and sister satellite [[WJMN-TV]] in Escanaba. As part of the 2012 deal, McCarren resigned his duties as [[sports director]] of WFRV to move to WTMJ/WGBA as a Packers analyst, becoming WGBA's official sports director on April 1, 2013, as his [[non-compete clause]] to appear as a sports anchor in Green Bay expired, though he retired as sports director in March 2015 to focus full-time on his duties for the Packer radio and television networks. WFRV/WJMN still airs any Packers regular season home games against an AFC team.\n\nThe 2012 TV rights deal expanded the team's preseason network further across the Midwest. Additional stations include the [[Quad Cities]] region of Iowa/Illinois where game coverage is carried by [[KLJB]] (Channel 18) in [[Davenport, Iowa]] and [[KGCW]] (Channel 26) in [[Burlington, Iowa]], both owned by [[Grant Broadcasting System II]], [[KCWI-TV]] (Channel 23) in [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]], [[KWWL (TV)|KWWL]] (Channel 7) in [[Waterloo, Iowa]], and in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], [[KMTV-TV]] (Channel 3), a sister Scripps station to WTMJ and WGBA. As part of a large package of preseason football from various team networks, [[KHII-TV|KFVE]] (Channel 9) in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]] also carried Packers state network games in the 2016 preseason. The network also added its first affiliate with [[Spanish language]] play-by-play, Milwaukee's [[WYTU-LD]] (Channel 63/49.4), a [[Telemundo]] affiliate, which airs statewide on [[Charter Communications|Spectrum]] systems. The Spanish broadcast is also simulcast by Scripps' [[WACY-TV]] (Channel 32) in the Green Bay/Appleton market (WACY is an otherwise English-language [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate).\n\nPre-season coverage is produced by [[CBS Sports|CBS]], formerly using the ''[[NFL on CBS]]'' graphics package until the last contract ended as a remnant of WFRV's former ownership by the CBS Corporation itself until 2007. In 2012, the pre-season coverage began to use the [[NBC Sports]] ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' graphics package due to WTMJ/WGBA's NBC affiliation. The TV play-by-play announcer, [[Kevin Harlan]] (also on loan from CBS), is the son of former Packers president [[Bob Harlan]], with [[Rich Gannon]] joining him as color commentator. Since the 2008 pre-season all Packers preseason games on the statewide network are produced and aired in [[high definition television|high definition]], with WTMJ-TV subcontracting the games to minor network affiliates in Milwaukee during [[Summer Olympics]] years due to mandatory non-preemption policies by their network, [[NBC]] (this was not done in 2012 as the pre-season opener was a national ESPN game). In Green Bay, WACY carries preseason games in English if WGBA is unable to during Olympics years.\n\n[[ESPN]] ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' games, both pre-season and season, are broadcast over the air on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[WLUK-TV]] in Green Bay and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WISN-TV]] (Channel 12) in Milwaukee (ABC affiliate [[WBAY-TV]] in Green Bay carried those games from 2006 until 2015;<ref>{{cite news|url=http://fox11online.com/sports/packers-and-nfl/fox-11-to-air-hall-of-fame-game-packers-mnf-games|title=FOX 11 to air Hall of Fame Game, Packers MNF games|date=July 6, 2016|publisher=WLUK-TV|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}</ref> the 2016 season was first where that station has not carried a Packer game in its history), while the stations airing Packers games in the [[NFL Network]] ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' package have varied over the years depending on arrangements for syndication or co-network productions and simulcasts with CBS or NBC. WBAY's evening [[news anchor]] Bill Jartz also serves as the [[public address]] system announcer for Lambeau Field.\n\nThe team's intra-squad Lambeau scrimmage at the beginning of the season, marketed as ''Packers Family Night'', was broadcast for over a decade by [[WITI (TV)|WITI]] (Channel 6) in Milwaukee, and produced by WLUK-TV in Green Bay, both Fox affiliates which broadcast the bulk of the team's regular-season games, along with the state's other Fox affiliates until the 2016 season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.packers.com/media-center/tv-shows.html |title=Green Bay Packers TV Broadcast Partners |publisher=Packers.com |accessdate=February 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630084908/http://www.packers.com/media-center/tv-shows.html |archive-date=June 30, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2017, Scripps and the Packers Television Network began to originate the Packers Family Night broadcast.<ref>Kirchen, R., [https://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/news/2017/04/20/green-baypackers-extend-partnership-with-wtmj-tv.html \"Green Bay Packers extend partnership with WTMJ-TV in Milwaukee\"], [[American City Business Journals|''Milwaukee Business Journal'']], April 20, 2017.</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nOn the television sitcom ''[[That '70s Show]]'', in season 7 episode 14, [[Donna Pinciotti]] gave the gang\u2014including [[Red Forman]], a long-time Packer fan\u2014six free tickets to Lambeau Field for a game against the Chicago Bears.

[[1966 NFL season#Major rule changes|Goalpost uprights]] would be made taller the next year.\n\n====1966: the first \"AFL-NFL World Championship Game\"====\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 15 - Willie Davis.jpg|right|thumb|Packers [[Willie Davis (defensive end)|Willie Davis]] (left) and [[Henry Jordan]] tackling a Chiefs player in the first AFL-NFL Championship (Super Bowl I). ]]\nThe [[1966 NFL season|1966 season]] saw the [[1966 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] led to the first-ever [[Super Bowl]] by [[National Football League Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] quarterback Bart Starr. The team went 12\u20132, and as time wound down in the [[NFL Championship Game, 1966|NFL Championship]] against the [[1966 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], the Packers clung to a 34\u201327 lead. Dallas had the ball on the Packers' two-yard line, threatening to tie the ballgame. But on fourth down the Packers' [[Tom Brown (sportsman, born 1940)|Tom Brown]] intercepted [[Don Meredith]]'s pass in the end zone to seal the win. The team crowned its season by rolling over the [[American Football League|AFL]] champion [[1966 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] 35\u201310 in [[Super Bowl I]].\n\n====1967: Super Bowl II, and Lombardi's departure====\nThe [[1967 NFL season|1967 season]] was the last for Lombardi as the Packers' head coach.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/coaches/LombVi0.htm|title=Vince Lombardi Record, Statistics, and Category Ranks {{!}} Pro-Football-Reference.com|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|access-date=August 1, 2018}}</ref> The [[NFL Championship Game, 1967|NFL Championship game]], a rematch of the 1966 contest against Dallas, became indelibly known as the \"Ice Bowl\" as a result of the brutal conditions at [[Lambeau Field]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2017/12/28/ap-was-there-1967-cowboys-packers-ice-bowl-game/108970804/|title=AP Was There: 1967 Cowboys-Packers Ice Bowl game|work=USA Today|access-date=August 1, 2018}}</ref> Still, the coldest NFL game ever played, it remains one of the most famous football games at any level in the history of the sport.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/specials/100-greatest/?q=55-the-ice-bowl|title=The 100 Greatest Moments in Sports History {{!}} The Ice Bowl|website=Sports Illustrated's 100 Greatest Moments|access-date=August 1, 2018}}</ref> With 16 seconds left, [[Bart Starr]]'s touchdown on a quarterback sneak brought the Packers a 21\u201317 victory and their still unequaled third straight NFL Championship. They then won [[Super Bowl II]] with a 33\u201314 victory over the [[Oakland Raiders]]. Lombardi stepped down as head coach after the game, and Phil Bengtson was named his successor. Lombardi remained as general manager for one season but left in 1969 to become head coach and minority owner of the [[Washington Redskins]].\n\nAfter Lombardi died of cancer on September 3, 1970, the NFL renamed the Super Bowl trophy the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]] in recognition of his accomplishments with the Packers. The city of [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]] renamed Highland Avenue in his honor in 1968, placing [[Lambeau Field]] at 1265 Lombardi Avenue ever since.\n\n===1968\u20131991: Post-Lombardi and decline===\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 16 - Eddie Lee Ivery.jpg|thumb|right|The Packers, pictured against Cardinals in the [[1982\u201383 NFL playoffs|1982\u201383 playoffs]], only qualified for the postseason twice during the team's post-Lombardi \"dark ages\" (1969\u201391).]]\nFor about a quarter-century after Lombardi's departure, the Packers had relatively little on-field success. In the 24 seasons from 1968 to 1991, they had only five seasons with a winning record, one being the shortened [[1982 NFL season|1982 strike season]]. They appeared in the playoffs twice, with a 1\u20132 record. The period saw five different head coaches&nbsp;\u2013 [[Phil Bengtson]], [[Dan Devine]], [[Bart Starr]], [[Forrest Gregg]], and [[Lindy Infante]]&nbsp;\u2013 two of whom, Starr and Gregg, were Lombardi's era stars, while Bengtson was a former Packer coach. Each led the Packers to a worse record than his predecessor. Poor personnel decisions were rife, notoriously the 1974 trade by acting general manager Dan Devine which sent five 1975 or 1976 draft picks (two first-rounders, two-second-rounders and a third) to the [[Los Angeles Rams]] for aging quarterback [[John Hadl]], who would spend only 1{{sfrac|1|2}} seasons in Green Bay.<ref>[http://www2.jsonline.com:80/packer/insider/history/oldschool/ Old School Packers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218153613/http://www2.jsonline.com/packer/insider/history/oldschool/ |date=February 18, 2006 }} from the [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] website.

He had his No. 4 jersey retired by the Packers in 2015.]]\nThe Packers' performance in the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s led to a shakeup, with [[Ron Wolf]] hired as general manager and given full control of the team's football operations to start the 1991 season. In 1992, Wolf hired [[San Francisco 49ers]] offensive coordinator [[Mike Holmgren]] as the Packers' new head coach.\n\nSoon afterward, Wolf acquired quarterback [[Brett Favre]] from the [[Atlanta Falcons]] for a first-round pick. Favre got the Packers their first win of the 1992 season, stepping in for injured quarterback [[Don Majkowski]] and leading a comeback over the [[1992 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]]. He started the following week, a win against the [[1992 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]], and never missed another start for Green Bay through the end of the 2007 season. He would go on to break the [[Most consecutive starts by a quarterback (NFL)|record]] for consecutive starts by an NFL quarterback, starting 297 consecutive games including stints with the [[New York Jets]] and [[Minnesota Vikings]] with the [[Most consecutive starts (NFL)|streak]] finally coming to an end [[Brett Favre#Consecutive starts streak|late in the 2010 season]].\n\nThe [[1992 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] had a 9\u20137 record in [[1992 NFL season|1992]], and began to turn heads around the league when they signed perhaps the most prized free agent in NFL history in [[Reggie White]] on the defense in 1993. White believed that Wolf, Holmgren, and Favre had the team heading in the right direction with a \"total commitment to winning.\" With White on board the Packers made it to the second round of the playoffs during both the [[1993 NFL season|1993]] and [[1994 NFL season|1994]] seasons but lost their 2nd-round matches to their playoff rival, the Dallas Cowboys, playing in Dallas on both occasions. In [[1995 NFL season|1995]], the [[1995 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] won the NFC Central Division championship for the first time since 1972. After a home playoff 37\u201320 win against Favre's former team, the Atlanta Falcons, the Packers defeated the defending Super Bowl champion [[1995 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] 27\u201317 in San Francisco on the road to advance to the [[NFC Championship Game]], where they lost again to the [[1995 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] 38\u201327.\n\n====1996: Super Bowl XXXI champions====\n[[File:19981213 28 Reggie White, Lambeau Field.jpg|thumb|Reggie White in 1998. White is widely considered one of the greatest defensive players in NFL history, and had his number retired by the Packers in 2005]]\nIn [[1996 NFL season|1996]], the [[1996 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]]' turnaround was complete. The team posted a league-best 13\u20133 record in the regular season, dominating the competition and securing home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. They were ranked no. 1 in offense with [[Brett Favre]] leading the way, no. 1 in defense with Reggie White as the leader of the defense and no. 1 in special teams with former [[Heisman Trophy]] winner [[Desmond Howard]] returning punts and kickoffs for touchdowns. After relatively easy wins against the [[1996 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]] in a muddy 35\u201314 beatdown and [[1996 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]] 30\u201313, the Packers advanced to the Super Bowl for the first time in 29 years. In [[Super Bowl XXXI]], Green Bay defeated the [[1996 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] 35\u201321 to win their 12th world championship. [[Desmond Howard]] was named MVP of the game for his kickoff return for a touchdown that ended the Patriots' bid for a comeback. Then-Packers president [[Bob Harlan]] credited Wolf, Holmgren, Favre, and White for ultimately changing the fortunes of the organization and turning the Green Bay Packers into a model NFL franchise. A 2007 panel of football experts at [[ESPN]] ranked the 1996 Packers the 6th-greatest team ever to play in the Super Bowl.\n\n====1997: defeat in Super Bowl XXXII====\nThe following season the [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] recorded another 13\u20133 record and won their second consecutive NFC championship. After defeating the [[1997 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] 21\u20137 and [[1997 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] 23\u201310 in the playoffs, the Packers returned to the Super Bowl as an 11{{sfrac|1|2}} point favorite. The team ended up losing in an upset to [[John Elway]] and the [[1997 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] in [[Super Bowl XXXII]], by the score of 31\u201324.\n\n====1998: Holmgren's last season====\n[[File:19981213 24 Mike Holmgren, Lambeau Field,.jpg|thumb|Holmgren, one of three Packer coaches to win a Super Bowl, pictured in 1998]]\nIn [[1998 NFL season|1998]], the [[1998 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] went 11\u20135 and met the [[1998 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] in the first-round of the NFC playoffs. It was the fourth consecutive year these teams had met in the playoffs and the sixth overall contest since the 1995 season. The Packers had won all previous games, and the media speculated that another 49ers loss would result in the dismissal of San Francisco head coach [[Steve Mariucci]]. Unlike the previous playoff matches, this game was hotly contested, with the teams frequently exchanging leads. With 4:19 left in the 4th quarter, Brett Favre and the Packers embarked on an 89-yard drive, which concluded with a Favre touchdown pass to receiver [[Antonio Freeman]]. This play appeared to give Green Bay the victory. But San Francisco quarterback [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]] led the 49ers on an improbable touchdown drive, which culminated when [[Terrell Owens]] caught Young's pass between several defenders to give the 49ers a lead with three seconds remaining. Afterwards, the game was mired in controversy. Many argued that during the 49ers game-winning drive, Niners receiver [[Jerry Rice]] fumbled the ball but officials stated he was down by contact. Television replays confirmed the fumble, but referees were unable to review the play; the next season the NFL reinstituted an instant replay system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs98/news/1999/990103/01025866.html|title=ESPN.com: Instant replay comes back to haunt Holmgren|publisher=ESPN|access-date=August 1, 2018}}</ref> In the end, this game turned out to be the end of an era in Green Bay. Days later Mike Holmgren left the Packers to become vice president, general manager and head coach of the [[Seattle Seahawks]]. Much of Holmgren's coaching staff went with him, and [[Reggie White]] also retired after the season (but later played one season for the [[Carolina Panthers]] in 2000).\n\n====1999: Ray Rhodes' one-year tenure====\nIn 1999, the team struggled to find an identity after the departure of so many of the individuals responsible for their Super Bowl run. [[Ray Rhodes]] was hired in 1999 as the team's new head coach. Rhodes had served around the league as a highly regarded defensive coordinator and more recently experienced moderate success as head coach of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] from 1995 to 1998. Ron Wolf believed that Rhodes' experience and player-friendly demeanor would fit nicely in Green Bay's veteran locker room, but Rhodes was fired after one 8\u20138 [[1999 Green Bay Packers season|season]]. Wolf visited team practice late in the 1999 season and believed that players had become too comfortable with Rhodes' style, and said the atmosphere resembled a country club.\n\n=====2000\u201305: Mike Sherman as head coach=====\n[[File:MikeSherman2003.jpg|thumb|left|Coach Mike Sherman, pictured in 2003]]\nIn 2000, Wolf replaced Rhodes with [[Mike Sherman]]. Sherman had never been a head coach at any level of football and was relatively unknown in NFL circles. He had only coached in professional football for three years starting as the Packers' tight ends coach in 1997 and 1998. In 1999, he followed Mike Holmgren to Seattle and became the Seahawks' offensive coordinator, although Sherman did not call the plays during games. Despite Sherman's apparent anonymity, Wolf was blown away in the interview process by the coach's organizational skills and attention to detail. Sherman's inaugural season started slowly, but the Packers won their final four games to achieve a 9\u20137 record. Brett Favre praised the atmosphere Sherman had cultivated in Green Bay's locker room and fans were optimistic about the team's future. In the offseason, however, Wolf suddenly announced his own resignation as general manager to take effect after the April 2001 draft. Packers' president Bob Harlan was surprised by Wolf's decision and felt unsure of how to replace him. Harlan preferred the structure Green Bay had employed since 1991; a general manager who ran football operations and hired a subservient head coach. But with the momentum and locker room chemistry that was built during the 2000 season, Harlan was reluctant to bring in a new individual with a potentially different philosophy. Wolf recommended that Harlan give the job to Sherman. Though Harlan was wary of the structure in principle, he agreed with Wolf that it was the best solution. In 2001, Sherman assumed the duties of both general manager and head coach.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2004, Sherman coached the Packers to respectable regular-season success, led by the spectacular play of Brett Favre, [[Ahman Green]], and a formidable offensive line. But Sherman's teams faltered in the playoffs. Prior to 2003, the Packers had never lost a home playoff game since the NFL instituted a post-season in 1933 (they were 13\u20130, with 11 of the wins at Lambeau and two more in Milwaukee.). That ended January 4, 2003, when the [[2002 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] defeated the [[2002 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] 27\u20137 in an NFC Wild Card game. The Packers would also lose at home in the playoffs to the [[2004 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] two years later.\n\nBy the end of the 2004 season, the Packers team depth appeared to be diminishing. Sherman also seemed overworked and reportedly had trouble communicating with players on the practice field with whom he was also negotiating contracts. Harlan felt the dual roles were too much for one man to handle and removed Sherman from the general manager position in early 2005 while retaining him as a head coach. Harlan hired the Seattle Seahawks' vice president of operations [[Ted Thompson]] as the new executive vice president, general manager and director of football operations. The relationship between Thompson and Sherman appeared strained, as Thompson immediately began rebuilding Green Bay's roster. Following a dismal 4\u201312 season, Thompson fired Sherman.\n\n====2006\u201307: McCarthy arrives, Favre departs====\n[[File:Donald Driver - October 24, 2010.jpg|right|thumb|Former Packers wide-receiver [[Donald Driver]]]]\nIn 2006, Thompson hired [[Mike McCarthy (American football)|Mike McCarthy]], the former [[offensive coordinator]] for the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and [[New Orleans Saints]] as his new head coach. McCarthy had also previously served as the [[quarterbacks coach]] for the Packers in 1999.\n\nAfter missing the playoffs in 2006, Brett Favre announced that he would return for the 2007 season; it would turn out to be one of his best. The Packers won 10 of their first 11 games and finished 13\u20133, earning a first-round bye in the playoffs. The Packers' passing offense, led by Favre and a very skilled wide receiver group, finished second in the NFC, behind the Dallas Cowboys, and third overall in the league. Running back [[Ryan Grant (running back)|Ryan Grant]], acquired for a sixth-round draft pick from the New York Giants, became the featured back in Green Bay and rushed for 956 yards and 8 touchdowns in the final 10 games of the regular season. In the divisional playoff round, in a heavy snowstorm, the Packers beat the Seattle Seahawks 42\u201320. Grant rushed for 201 yards and three touchdowns, while Favre tossed an additional three touchdown passes to receiver [[Donald Driver]] (as well as a snowball, which Favre memorably threw at Driver in celebration).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Walker |first1=Ben |title=Playful Favre accurate even with snowball |url=https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2008/01/13/playful-favre-accurate-even-with-snowball/ |website=East Bay Times |accessdate=May 30, 2018 |date=January 13, 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn January 20, 2008, Green Bay appeared in their first NFC Championship Game in 10 years facing the [[2007 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] in Green Bay. The game was lost 23\u201320 on an overtime field goal by [[Lawrence Tynes]]. This would be [[Brett Favre]]'s final game as a Green Bay Packer with his final pass being an interception in overtime.\n\n[[Mike McCarthy (American football)|Mike McCarthy]] coached the [[National Football Conference|NFC]] team during the [[2008 Pro Bowl]] in Hawaii. [[Al Harris (cornerback)|Al Harris]] and [[Aaron Kampman]] were also picked to play for the NFC Pro Bowl team as starters. [[Donald Driver]] was named as a third-string wideout on the Pro Bowl roster. [[Brett Favre]] was named the first-string quarterback for the NFC, but he declined to play in the Pro Bowl and was replaced on the roster by [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers|Tampa Bay]] [[quarterback]] [[Jeff Garcia]]. The Packers also had several first alternates, including [[offensive tackle]] [[Chad Clifton]] and [[linebacker]] [[Nick Barnett]].\n\nIn December 2007, [[Ted Thompson]] was signed to a 5-year contract extension with the Packers. In addition, on February 5, 2008, head coach Mike McCarthy signed a 5-year contract extension.\n\n===2008\u2013present: Aaron Rodgers era===\n\n====2008: Transition====\n{{Main|2008 Green Bay Packers season}}\n[[Image:Aaron Rodgers 2008 (cropped).jpg|upright|thumb|240px|Quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]] in 2008.]]\n\nOn March 4, 2008, [[Brett Favre]] announced his retirement. Within five months, however, he filed for reinstatement with the NFL on July 29. Favre's petition was granted by Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]], effective August 4, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3517219|title=NFL grants Favre reinstatement; sources say QB job is open|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=August 3, 2008|date=August 3, 2008}}</ref> On August 6, 2008, it was announced that Brett Favre was traded to the [[New York Jets]] for a conditional draft pick in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/8381934/Packers-trade-Favre-to-Jets |title=Packers trade Favre to Jets |accessdate=August 6, 2008 |author=Jay Glazer |authorlink=Jay Glazer |date=August 6, 2008 |work=Fox Sports on MSN |quote=The month-long saga has finally come to an end, with the Packers agreeing to trade their future Hall-of-Fame quarterback to the New York Jets, Fox Sports.com has learned. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819213402/http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/8381934/Packers-trade-Favre-to-Jets |archivedate=August 19, 2008  }}</ref>\n\nThe Packers began their [[2008 NFL season|2008 season]] with their 2005 first-round draft pick, quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]], under center, as the first QB other than Favre to start for the Packers in 16 years. Rodgers played well in his first year starting for the Packers, throwing for over 4,000 yards and 28 touchdowns. However, injuries plagued the Packers' defense, as they lost 7 close games by 4 points or less, finishing with a 6\u201310 record. After the season, eight assistant coaches were dismissed by McCarthy, including Bob Sanders, the team's defensive coordinator, who was replaced by [[Dom Capers]].\n\n====2009: Return to the playoffs====\n{{Main|2009 Green Bay Packers season}}\nIn March 2009, the organization assured fans that Brett Favre's jersey number would be retired, but not during the 2009 season. In April 2009, the Packers selected defensive lineman [[B. J. Raji]] of Boston College as the team's first pick in the draft. The team then traded three draft picks (including the pick the Packers acquired from the Jets for Brett Favre) for another first-round pick, selecting linebacker [[Clay Matthews III]] of the [[University of Southern California]].\n\nDuring the [[2009 NFL season]], two match-ups between the franchise and its former quarterback Brett Favre were highly anticipated after Favre's arrival with the division-rival Vikings in August. The first encounter took place in Week 4, on a [[Monday Night Football]] game which broke several TV audience records. The scheduling of this game was made possible when Baseball Commissioner and Packer board of directors member [[Bud Selig]] forced baseball's [[Minnesota Twins]] to play 2 games within a 12-hour span. The Vikings won the game 30\u201323. [[Brett Favre]] threw 3 TDs, no interceptions, and had a passer rating of 135.<ref name=\"nfl.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/players/gamelogs?id=FAV540222 |title=Brett Favre: Game Logs at |publisher=National Football League  |accessdate=February 7, 2011}}</ref> The teams met for a second time in Week 8, Favre leading the Vikings to a second win, 38\u201326, in Green Bay. Rodgers was heavily pressured in both games, being sacked 14 times total, but still played well, throwing five touchdowns and only one interception. The next week, the Packers were upset by the win-less [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. Following a players-only meeting, the team found some stability on the offensive line with the return of tackle [[Mark Tauscher]] bringing a minor halt to sacks to Rodgers and opening the running game to [[Ryan Grant (running back)|Ryan Grant]] and the other running backs. Green Bay finished the season strongly, winning 7 out of their last 8 games, including winning their 16th regular season finale in the past 17 seasons, and earning a NFC wild-card playoff bid with an 11\u20135 regular-season record. The Packers defense was ranked No. 2 and the offense was ranked No. 6 with rookies [[Brad Jones (American football)|Brad Jones]] and [[Clay Matthews III]] becoming sensations at linebacker and young players like [[James Jones (wide receiver)|James Jones]], [[Brandon Jackson (American football)|Brandon Jackson]], [[Jermichael Finley]] and [[Jordy Nelson]] becoming threats on offense. Rodgers also became the first quarterback in NFL history to throw for at least 4,000 yards in each of his first two seasons as a starter. Also, cornerback [[Charles Woodson]] won [[NFL Defensive Player of the Year]] honors after recording 9 interceptions, forcing four fumbles, 3 touchdowns and registering 74 tackles and 2 sacks. In fact, Woodson's 9 interceptions were more than the 8 collected by all Packer opponents that season. Though the defense was ranked high, injuries to [[Al Harris (cornerback)|Al Harris]], [[Tramon Williams]], [[Will Blackmon]], [[Atari Bigby]] and [[Brandon Underwood]] severely limited the depth of the secondary and teams like the [[Minnesota Vikings]] and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] used that to their advantage by unleashing aerial assaults against inexperienced players with the NFL's best receivers. The season ended with an overtime loss in a [[2010 NFL Playoffs#Wild Card playoffs|wild card round]] shootout at the [[Arizona Cardinals]], 51\u201345.\n\n====2010: Super Bowl XLV championship====\n{{Main|2010 Green Bay Packers season}}\n[[File:Mike McCarthy (TJG).JPG|thumb|Former [[Super Bowl]] winning Packers head coach [[Mike McCarthy (American football)|Mike McCarthy]]]]\n\nThe team lost [[Johnny Jolly]] to a season-long suspension after he violated the NFL drug policy.

They first faced No. 3 seeded [[Philadelphia Eagles|Philadelphia]], winning 21\u201316. In the Divisional round, they defeated No. 1 seeded [[Atlanta Falcons|Atlanta]] 48\u201321. They then played the [[Chicago Bears]] at [[Soldier Field]] in the NFC Championship Game \u2013 only the second playoff meeting between the two storied rivals (the other a 33\u201314 Chicago victory which sent them to the [[1941 NFL Championship Game]]).

He was given $500 for uniforms and equipment in return for the team being named for its sponsor. An early newspaper article referred to the fledglings as \"the Indians\", but by the time they played their first game \"Packers\" had taken hold.\n\nIndian Packing was purchased in 1920 by the Acme Packing Company. Acme continued to support the team, which played its first NFL season with \"ACME PACKERS\" emblazoned on its jerseys.\n\n===Team colors===\nLambeau, a [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] alumnus, borrowed its [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Irish]]'s navy blue and gold team colors, much as [[George Halas]] borrowed his [[University of Illinois|Illinois]] alma mater's for the [[Chicago Bears]]. As a result, the early Packers were often referred to as the \"Bays\" or the \"Blues\" (and even occasionally as \"the Big Bay Blues\").\n\nBy 1950, Green Bay replaced navy blue with kelly green, but kept what was by then a lighter shade of athletic gold. Navy blue was kept as a secondary color, seen primarily on sideline capes, but was quietly dropped on all official materials shortly thereafter. In 1958, this kelly green was replaced by a darker hunter green; it and athletic gold have served as the team colors since. The team's current uniform combination of forest green or white jerseys and metallic gold pants was adopted soon after Vince Lombardi arrived in 1959. However, to celebrate the NFL's 75th anniversary in 1994, the Packers joined in a league-wide donning of \"throwback\" jerseys, back to navy blue and gold. The team would go throwback again for two Thanksgiving Day games against the [[Detroit Lions]], in blue and gold 1930s-era uniforms in 2001, and 1960s green and gold (only slightly different from the current ones) in 2003.<ref>[http://www.packers.com/history/fast_facts/uniform_history/ Packers Uniform History, 1921\u20132004] from Packers.com.

Indeed, County Stadium had been built partly to entice the Packers to move to Milwaukee full-time. The Packers worked to capture their growing fan base in Milwaukee and the larger crowds. By the 1960s, threat of an [[American Football League]] franchise in Milwaukee prompted the Packers to stay, including scheduling a [[NFL playoffs, 1967#Conference championships|Western Conference Playoff]] in 1967.\n\nCounty Stadium was built primarily as a baseball stadium and made only the bare minimum adjustments to accommodate football. At its height, it only seated 56,000 people, just barely above the NFL minimum; many of those seats were badly obstructed. The field was just barely large enough to fit a football field. Both teams shared the same sideline (separated by a piece of tape) and the end zones extended onto the [[warning track]]. By 1994, improvements and seating expansions at Lambeau, along with the Brewers preparing to campaign for their [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|new stadium]] prompted the Packers to play their full slate in Green Bay for the first time in 62 years. Former season ticketholders for the Milwaukee package continue to receive preference for one pre-season and the second and fifth regular-season games at Lambeau Field each season, along with playoff games through a lottery under the \"Gold Package\" plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.packers.com/tickets/season-tickets.html|title=Green & Gold Package Scheduling|publisher=Packers.com|accessdate=August 22, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Packers have three practice facilities across the street from Lambeau Field: the [[Don Hutson Center]], an indoor facility; [[Ray Nitschke Field]], an outdoor field with artificial [[FieldTurf]]; and [[Clarke Hinkle Field]], an outdoor field with natural grass.\n\n==Statistics and records==\n{{Main|Green Bay Packers records}}\n\n===Season-by-season results===\nThis is a partial list of the Packers' last five completed seasons.

[[NFL blackout]] restrictions for the team apply within both areas. However, Packers games have not been blacked out locally since [[1972 NFL season|1972]] (the last year home game local telecasts were prohibited regardless of sellout status) due to strong home attendance and popularity. As mentioned above, every Packers home game\u2014preseason, regular season and playoffs\u2014has been sold out since 1960.\n\n===Radio===\nThe [[flagship station]] of the [[Packers Radio Network]] is [[Good Karma Brands]]'s [[WTMJ (AM)|WTMJ]] in Milwaukee, which was the former flagship of the [[Journal Media Group|Journal Broadcast Group]] before its merger with [[E. W. Scripps Company]] in April 2015; Scripps itself sold their Milwaukee radio assets to GKB in November 2018, including the Packers Radio Network. WTMJ has aired Packers games since 1929, the longest association between a radio station and an NFL team to date, and the only rights deal in American professional sports where a station outside of the team's main metro area is the radio flagship. While this might be unusual, the station can be heard at city-grade strength at all hours in Green Bay proper. Games air in Green Bay on [[WTAQ]] (1360/97.5) and [[WIXX-FM]] (101.1), and [[WAPL]] (105.7) and [[WHBY]] (1150) in [[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]] and the [[Fox Cities]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.packers.com/gameday/packers_radio_network/station_listing/ |title=Packers Radio Station Listing |publisher=Packers.com |accessdate=February 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102043312/http://packers.com/gameday/packers_radio_network/station_listing/ |archive-date=January 2, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Wayne Larrivee]] is the play-by-play announcer and [[Larry McCarren]] is the color analyst.

When victory is assured for the Packers, either a game-winning touchdown, interception or a crucial 4th down defensive stop, Larrivee's trademark declaration of \"And there is your dagger!\" signifies the event. In limited circumstances where the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] are in either playoff or post-season contention and their play-by-play takes priority, WTMJ's sister FM station [[WKTI]] (94.5) currently airs Packer games to avert game conflicts. Surrounding pre-game programming is also carried on sister station [[WAUK]] (540), an [[ESPN Radio]] affiliate and former competitor which produced unofficial Packers programming for years.\n\n===Television===\nThe TV rights for pre-season games, not nationally broadcast are held by Scripps television stations [[WGBA-TV]] (Channel 26) in Green Bay and [[WTMJ-TV]] (Channel 4) in Milwaukee,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/sports/141227143.html|title=Packers and Journal Broadcast Group announce partnership deal|last=Wolfley|first=Bob|date=March 2, 2012|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|accessdate=March 3, 2012}}</ref> along with [[Quincy Media]]'s six [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] stations in the central, northern and western parts of the state, [[KQDS-TV]] (Channel 21) in [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]]-[[Superior, Wisconsin|Superior]], and in [[Escanaba, Michigan|Escanaba]]/[[Marquette, Michigan]], [[WLUC-TV]] (Channel 6), along with their [[WLUC-DT2|Fox subchannel]]. As such, these stations are authorized to use the tagline ''Your official Packers station'' in their market area by the team, and also carry two weeknight programs; ''Packers Live'' on Tuesday evening, and the weekly coach's show, ''The Matt LaFleur Show'' on Wednesday evenings at 6:30&nbsp;pm throughout the football season. Until the end of the 2011 season, the team's partner in Green Bay was [[WFRV-TV]] (Channel 5), and sister satellite [[WJMN-TV]] in Escanaba. As part of the 2012 deal, McCarren resigned his duties as [[sports director]] of WFRV to move to WTMJ/WGBA as a Packers analyst, becoming WGBA's official sports director on April 1, 2013, as his [[non-compete clause]] to appear as a sports anchor in Green Bay expired, though he retired as sports director in March 2015 to focus full-time on his duties for the Packer radio and television networks. WFRV/WJMN still airs any Packers regular season home games against an AFC team.\n\nThe 2012 TV rights deal expanded the team's preseason network further across the Midwest. Additional stations include the [[Quad Cities]] region of Iowa/Illinois where game coverage is carried by [[KLJB]] (Channel 18) in [[Davenport, Iowa]] and [[KGCW]] (Channel 26) in [[Burlington, Iowa]], both owned by [[Grant Broadcasting System II]], [[KCWI-TV]] (Channel 23) in [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]], [[KWWL (TV)|KWWL]] (Channel 7) in [[Waterloo, Iowa]], and in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], [[KMTV-TV]] (Channel 3), a sister Scripps station to WTMJ and WGBA. As part of a large package of preseason football from various team networks, [[KHII-TV|KFVE]] (Channel 9) in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]] also carried Packers state network games in the 2016 preseason. The network also added its first affiliate with [[Spanish language]] play-by-play, Milwaukee's [[WYTU-LD]] (Channel 63/49.4), a [[Telemundo]] affiliate, which airs statewide on [[Charter Communications|Spectrum]] systems. The Spanish broadcast is also simulcast by Scripps' [[WACY-TV]] (Channel 32) in the Green Bay/Appleton market (WACY is an otherwise English-language [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate).\n\nPre-season coverage is produced by [[CBS Sports|CBS]], formerly using the ''[[NFL on CBS]]'' graphics package until the last contract ended as a remnant of WFRV's former ownership by the CBS Corporation itself until 2007. In 2012, the pre-season coverage began to use the [[NBC Sports]] ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' graphics package due to WTMJ/WGBA's NBC affiliation. The TV play-by-play announcer, [[Kevin Harlan]] (also on loan from CBS), is the son of former Packers president [[Bob Harlan]], with [[Rich Gannon]] joining him as color commentator. Since the 2008 pre-season all Packers preseason games on the statewide network are produced and aired in [[high definition television|high definition]], with WTMJ-TV subcontracting the games to minor network affiliates in Milwaukee during [[Summer Olympics]] years due to mandatory non-preemption policies by their network, [[NBC]] (this was not done in 2012 as the pre-season opener was a national ESPN game). In Green Bay, WACY carries preseason games in English if WGBA is unable to during Olympics years.\n\n[[ESPN]] ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' games, both pre-season and season, are broadcast over the air on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[WLUK-TV]] in Green Bay and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WISN-TV]] (Channel 12) in Milwaukee (ABC affiliate [[WBAY-TV]] in Green Bay carried those games from 2006 until 2015;<ref>{{cite news|url=http://fox11online.com/sports/packers-and-nfl/fox-11-to-air-hall-of-fame-game-packers-mnf-games|title=FOX 11 to air Hall of Fame Game, Packers MNF games|date=July 6, 2016|publisher=WLUK-TV|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}</ref> the 2016 season was first where that station has not carried a Packer game in its history), while the stations airing Packers games in the [[NFL Network]] ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' package have varied over the years depending on arrangements for syndication or co-network productions and simulcasts with CBS or NBC. WBAY's evening [[news anchor]] Bill Jartz also serves as the [[public address]] system announcer for Lambeau Field.\n\nThe team's intra-squad Lambeau scrimmage at the beginning of the season, marketed as ''Packers Family Night'', was broadcast for over a decade by [[WITI (TV)|WITI]] (Channel 6) in Milwaukee, and produced by WLUK-TV in Green Bay, both Fox affiliates which broadcast the bulk of the team's regular-season games, along with the state's other Fox affiliates until the 2016 season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.packers.com/media-center/tv-shows.html |title=Green Bay Packers TV Broadcast Partners |publisher=Packers.com |accessdate=February 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630084908/http://www.packers.com/media-center/tv-shows.html |archive-date=June 30, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2017, Scripps and the Packers Television Network began to originate the Packers Family Night broadcast.<ref>Kirchen, R., [https://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/news/2017/04/20/green-baypackers-extend-partnership-with-wtmj-tv.html \"Green Bay Packers extend partnership with WTMJ-TV in Milwaukee\"], [[American City Business Journals|''Milwaukee Business Journal'']], April 20, 2017.</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nOn the television sitcom ''[[That '70s Show]]'', in season 7 episode 14, [[Donna Pinciotti]] gave the gang\u2014including [[Red Forman]], a long-time Packer fan\u2014six free tickets to Lambeau Field for a game against the Chicago Bears.

He did so through vision (about how to improve health care through research), innovation (in research methods for health care and education of researchers and clinicians), and engendering collegiality and collaboration.\nAmong his more important [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized clinical trials]], and in collaboration with colleagues around the world, he was a Principal Investigator in the trials that showed, for the first time anywhere, the life-saving benefits of [[aspirin]] for patients with threatened stroke and threatened heart attack, that surgically repairing the \"hardened\" arteries of patients with threatened stroke (carotid endarterectomy) prevented both stroke and death, and the ability of nurse practitioners to provide effective, high-quality primary care.  In addition, his \"debunking\" trials showed the futility of traditional health education in helping hypertensive patients take their medicine, and that a popular \"bypass\" operation for stroke-prone individuals did more harm than good.\n\nHe repeated his residency in medicine some 20 years after first training because, although a professor in medical school, he 'wasn't a good enough doctor.'\" (BMJ, 14 May 2015)\n\nHis contributions to research methodology included ways to detect and reduce bias in clinical research, and ways to design, conduct, and report randomized clinical trials.  \nDavid Sackett is widely regarded as one of 3 \"fathers\" of modern clinical epidemiology (along with [[Archie Cochrane]] of the UK and [[Alvan Feinstein]] of the USA). Clinical epidemiology is a research discipline based on the methods of epidemiology (and other scientific pursuits, notably biostatistics, the behavioral sciences, and health economics), applied to understanding the nature of health care problems and, especially, their management. Thus, it is a bridging discipline, linking research to clinical practice. Typical topics include the cause, diagnosis, course (prognosis, clinical prediction), prevention, treatment, and amelioration of health disorders, and the improvement and cost-effectiveness of health services.\n\nSackett was the founding chair of the first department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics in the world at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, in 1967, and extensively contributed to the development of research methods through his books and published articles, as well as through education and lectures at McMaster and around the world. Notably, he turned clinical research into a scientifically sound and practical, multidisciplinary \"team sport\" and has changed for the better the quality of health care research and clinical practice. \n \nIn the late 1970s, Sackett began to popularize the use of clinical epidemiologic principles in the practice of medicine and other health care disciplines, working with his former students, Brian Haynes, Peter Tugwell, [[Gordon Guyatt]] and eventually many other clinician scientists at McMaster University and around the world. Initially termed \"critical appraisal of the medical literature\", to help practitioners keep up with scientific advances in health care, this became \"evidence-based medicine\". Evidence-Based Medicine: An Oral History documents some of the highlights of the role that he and others played in the evolution of EBM. Sackett led the writing of seminal articles on clinical disagreement and how to read clinical journals books, beginning in 1980 in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, followed by seminal books, beginning in 1985 with Clinical Epidemiology: A Basic Science for Clinical Medicine.\n\nIn 1994, Sackett accepted an invitation from (later, Sir) Muir Gray of the UK National Health Service to start the first Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine in Britain, as Professor of Clinical Epidemiology, Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Oxford.\n \nClinically, Sackett practiced as a general internist and was appointed Physician-in-Chief of Medicine at the Chedoke-McMaster Hospital in Hamilton Ontario in 1986, then Head of the Division of General Internal Medicine in 1988. In Oxford, he practiced as Honorary NHS Consultant in General Medicine.\n\nRetired from clinical practice in 1999, he returned to Canada and created the Trout Research & Education Centre, where he read, researched, wrote and taught about randomized clinical trials. He also authored, with Sharon Straus, the definitive guide about mentorship for clinician scientists.<ref>Straus SE, Sackett DL, Mentorship in Academic Medicine. John Wiley & Sons, 2014.

In recent years,{{when|date=August 2019}} more products sold by retailers outside United States and Canada have been using EAN-13 codes beginning with 0, since they were generated by GS1-US.\n\nThe 020-029 GS1 Prefixes are worth a special mention. GS1 defines this as being available for retailer internal use (or internal use by other types of business). Some retailers use this for proprietary (own brand or unbranded) products, although many retailers obtain their own manufacturer's code for their own brands. Other retailers use at least part of this prefix for products which are packaged in store, for example, items weighed and served over a counter for a customer. In these cases, the barcode may encode a price, quantity or weight along with a product identifier - in a retailer defined way. The product identifier may be one assigned by the Produce Electronic Identification Board (PEIB) or may be retailer assigned. Retailers who have historically used UPC barcodes tend to use GS1 prefixes starting with \"02\" for store-packaged products.{{fact|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe EAN \"country code\" 978 (and later 979) has been allocated since the 1980s to reserve a Unique Country Code (UCC) prefix for EAN identifiers of published books, regardless of country of origin, so that the EAN space can catalog books by [[ISBN]]s<ref name=\":0\" /> rather than maintaining a redundant parallel numbering system. This is informally known as \"[[Bookland]]\". The prefix 979 with first digit 0 is used for [[ISMN|International Standard Music Number (ISMN)]] and the prefix 977 indicates [[ISSN|International Standard Serial Number (ISSN)]].\n\n===Manufacturer code===\nThe manufacturer code is a unique code assigned to each manufacturer by the numbering authority indicated by the GS1 Prefix. All products produced by a given company will use the same manufacturer code. EAN-13 uses what are called \"variable-length manufacturer codes\". Assigning fixed-length 5-digit manufacturer codes, as the UCC has done until recently, means that each manufacturer can have up to 99,999 product codes. Many manufacturers do not have that many products, which means hundreds or even thousands of potential product codes are being wasted on manufacturers that only have a few products. Thus if a potential manufacturer knows that it is only going to produce a few products, EAN-13 may issue it a longer manufacturer code, leaving less space for the product code. This results in more efficient use of the available manufacturer and product codes.<ref>{{cite web|title=EAN-13 SYMBOLOGY|url=http://www.barcodeisland.com/ean13.phtml|website=www.barcodeisland.com}}</ref>\n\nIn ISBN and ISSN, this component is used to identify the language in which the publication was issued and managed by a transnational agency covering several countries, or to identify the country where the legal deposits are made by a publisher registered with a national agency, and it is further subdivided any allocating subblocks for publishers; many countries have several prefixes allocated in the ISSN and ISBN registries.\n\n===Product code===\n\nThe product code is assigned by the manufacturer. The product code immediately follows manufacturer code. The total length of manufacturer code plus product code should be 9 or 10 digits depending on the length of country code (2-3 digits).\n\nIn ISBN, ISMN and ISSN, it uniquely identifies the publication from the same publisher; it should be used and allocated by the registered publisher in order to avoid creating gaps; however it happens that a registered book or serial never gets published and sold.\n\n===Check digit===\nThe check digit is an additional digit, used to verify that a barcode has been scanned correctly. It is computed modulo 10, where the weights in the checksum calculation alternate 3 and 1. In particular, since the weights are relatively prime to 10, the EAN-13 system will detect all single digit errors. It also recognizes 90% of transposition errors (all cases, where the difference between adjacent digits is not 5).\n\n== Calculation of checksum digit ==\n\nThe checksum is calculated as sum of products - taking an alternating weight value (3 or 1) times the value of each data digit. The checksum digit is the digit, which must be added to this checksum to get a number divisible by 10 (i.e. the additive inverse of the checksum, modulo 10).<ref>[http://www.gs1us.org/resources/tools/check-digit-calculator Check Digit Calculator], at ''GS1'' US.</ref> See [[ISBN#ISBN-13 check digit calculation|ISBN-13 check digit calculation]] for a more extensive description and algorithm. The [[Global Location Number|Global Location Number(GLN)]] also uses the same method.\n\n===Position - weight===\n\nThe weight at a specific position in the EAN code is alternating (3 or 1) in a way, that the final data digit has a weight of 3 (and thus the check digit has a weight of 1).\n\nAll [[Global Trade Item Number|Global Trade Item Number (GTIN)]] and [[Serial Shipping Container Code|Serial Shipping Container Code (SSCC)]] codes meet the next rule:\n\nNumbering the positions from the right (code aligned to the right), the odd data digits are always weight of 3 and the even data digits are always weight of 1, regardless of the length of the code.\n\nWeights for 18-digit SSCC code and GTINs (GTIN-8, GTIN-12, GTIN-13, GTIN-14):\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n! position\n| 17 || 16 || 15 || 14 || 13 || 12 || 11 || 10 || 9 || 8 || 7 || 6 || 5 || 4 || 3 || 2 || 1\n|-\n! weight\n| 3 || 1 || 3 || 1 || 3 || 1 || 3 || 1 || 3 || 1 || 3 || 1 || 3 || 1 || 3 || 1 || 3\n|}\n\nWeights for EAN-13 code:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n! position\n| 12 || 11 || 10 || 9 || 8 || 7 || 6 || 5 || 4 || 3 || 2 || 1\n|-\n! weight\n| 1 || 3 || 1 || 3 || 1 || 3 || 1 || 3 || 1 || 3 || 1 || 3\n|}\n\nWeights for EAN-8 code:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n! position\n| 7 || 6 || 5 || 4 || 3 || 2 || 1\n|-\n! weight\n| 3 || 1 || 3 || 1 || 3 || 1 || 3\n|}\n\n=== Calculation examples===\n\n* For [[EAN-13]] barcode 400638133393'''''x''''', where '''''x''''' is the unknown check digit, (Stabilo Point 88 Art.

Subtract them: 70 - 63 = 7, which is the check digit '''''x''''' of the barcode.\n\n== Binary encoding of data digits into EAN-13 barcode ==\nThe GTIN numbers, encoded to UPC-A, EAN-8 and EAN-13, all use similar encoding. The encoded data is usually repeated in plain text below the barcode.\n\n=== Barcode structure ===\n[[Image:Codering EAN-13 new.svg|thumb|Encoding EAN-13]]\n[[Image:EAN-L.png|thumb|Encoding L-digits]]\n[[Image:EAN-G.png|thumb|Encoding G-digits]]\n[[Image:EAN-R.png|thumb|Encoding R-digits]]\nThe barcode consists of 95 areas (also called modules{{cn|date=January 2019}}) of equal width.  Each area can be either white (represented here as 0) or black (represented as 1).  From left to right:\n* 3 areas for the start marker (101)\n* 42 areas (seven per digit) to encode digits 2-7, and to encode digit 1 indirectly, as described in the following section\n* 5 areas for the center marker (01010)\n* 42 areas (seven per digit) to encode digits 8-13\n* 3 areas for the end marker (101)\n\n=== Encoding of the digits ===\nTo encode the 13-digit EAN-13 number, the digits are split into 3 groups; the first digit, the first group of 6 and the last group of 6. The first group of 6 is encoded using a pattern whereby each digit has two possible encodings, one of which has even [[parity bit#Parity|parity]] (denoted with letter G) and one of which has odd parity (denoted with letter L). The first digit is not represented directly by a pattern of bars and spaces, but is encoded indirectly, by selecting a pattern of choices between these two encodings for the first group of 6 digits, according to the table below. All digits in the last group of 6 digits are encoded using a single pattern RRRRRR, the one also used for [[Universal Product Code|UPC]].\n\nIf the first digit is zero, all digits in the first group of 6 are encoded using the pattern LLLLLL used for [[Universal Product Code|UPC]], therefore, a UPC barcode is also an EAN-13 barcode with the first digit set to zero.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Structure of EAN-13\n! First digit !! First group of 6 digits !! Last group of 6 digits\n|-\n| <tt>0</tt> || <tt>LLLLLL</tt> || <tt>RRRRRR</tt>\n|-\n| <tt>1</tt> || <tt>LLGLGG</tt> || <tt>RRRRRR</tt>\n|-\n| <tt>2</tt> || <tt>LLGGLG</tt> || <tt>RRRRRR</tt>\n|-\n| <tt>3</tt> || <tt>LLGGGL</tt> || <tt>RRRRRR</tt>\n|-\n| <tt>4</tt> || <tt>LGLLGG</tt> || <tt>RRRRRR</tt>\n|-\n| <tt>5</tt> || <tt>LGGLLG</tt> || <tt>RRRRRR</tt>\n|-\n| <tt>6</tt> || <tt>LGGGLL</tt> || <tt>RRRRRR</tt>\n|-\n| <tt>7</tt> || <tt>LGLGLG</tt> || <tt>RRRRRR</tt>\n|-\n| <tt>8</tt> || <tt>LGLGGL</tt> || <tt>RRRRRR</tt>\n|-\n| <tt>9</tt> || <tt>LGGLGL</tt> || <tt>RRRRRR</tt>\n|}\nThis encoding guarantees that the first group always starts with an L-code, which has odd parity, and that the second group always starts with an R-code, which has even parity.  Thus, it does not matter whether the barcode is scanned from the left or from the right, as the scanning software can use this parity to identify the start and end of the code.\n\nEAN-8 barcodes encode all digits directly, using this scheme:\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Structure of EAN-8\n! First group of 4 digits !! Last group of 4 digits\n|-\n| <tt>LLLL</tt> || <tt>RRRR</tt>\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Encoding of the digits\n! Digit !! L-code !!

Entries in the G-column are the entries in the R-column in reverse bit order. See pictures of all codes against a colored background.\n\nA run of one or more black areas is known as a \"bar\", and a run of one or more white areas is known as a \"space\".  As can be seen in the table, each digit's encoding comprises two bars and two spaces, and the maximum width of a bar or space is four areas.\n\n=== EAN-13 barcode example ===\n[[File:Ean13-Beispiel k.png|thumb|none|upright=2.0|EAN-13 barcode. A green bar indicates the black bars and white spaces that encode a digit.]]\n* C1, C3:Start/end marker.\n* C2: Marker for the center of the barcode.\n* 6 digits in the left group: 003994.\n* 6 digits in the right group (the last digit is the check digit): 155486.\n* A digit is encoded in seven areas, by two black bars and two white spaces. Each black bar or white space can have a width between 1 and 4 areas.\n* Parity for the digits from left and right group: OEOOEE EEEEEE (O = Odd parity, E = Even parity).\n* The first digit in the EAN code: the combination of parities of the digits in the left group indirectly encodes the first digit 4.\n\nThe complete EAN-13 code is thus: 4 003994 155486.\n\n[[File:How to scan part of an EAN-13 barcode.png|thumb|Scanning part of an EAN-13 barcode.]]\n\n=== Decoding ===\n{{section-stub|date=January 2019}}\nBy using the barcode center marker, it is possible for a barcode scanner to scan just one half of the barcode at a time. This allows reconstruction of the code by means of a helical scan of the barcode by an angle of approximately 45 degrees.\n\n== Japanese Article Number ==\n{{anchor|jan}}<!-- [[Japanese Article Number]] redirect links to this subsection anchor -->\n'''Japanese Article Number''' ('''JAN''') is a barcode standard compatible with the EAN. Use of the JAN standard began in 1978. Originally, JAN was issued a flag code (EAN's number system) of 49. In 1992, JAN was newly issued an additional flag code of 45. In January 2001 the manufacturer code changed to 7 digits (9 digits including the flag code) for new companies.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.polylabel.com/barcodes/types/jancode.php | title = Bar Code Guide - Barcode Types - JAN | accessdate = 2016-05-02}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[EAN-8]], another form of EAN barcode\n* [[Electronic Data Interchange]]\n* [[European Article Numbering-Uniform Code Council]]\n* [[Global Electronic Party Information Register]] (GEPIR) a searchable distributed database of [[GS1]] GTINs\n* [[GTIN]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|International Article Number (EAN)}}\n*[https://www.gs1.org/barcodes/ean-upc International Article Number] at [[GS1]] website\n* [https://metacpan.org/search?q=barcode Barcode] [[Perl]] modules at [[CPAN]]\n* [http://marin.jb.free.fr/barcode/ An example of EAN8/13 implementation]\n* [http://www.chaosreligion.com/wtl/index.php5?title=EAN EAN MediaWiki extension], a MediaWiki extension, visualizing EAN-13/EAN-8/UPC-A/Code39/Codabar barcodes by specifying only the numbers/symbols in the wiki-text.\n* [http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/10162/Creating-EAN-Barcodes-with-C Implementing the EAN-13 barcode in C#]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160512193603/http://gepir.gs1.org/v32/xx/default.aspx?Lang=en-US%2F Global Electronic Party Information Registry (GEPIR)]\n* [https://www.upcdatabase.com upcdatabase, another online barcode database]\n* [https://www.ean-search.org/ EAN-Search, free barcode database with API, 180 million entries]\n* [https://www.dsri.jp/jan/ Official JAN homepage] {{in lang|ja}}\n\n{{Barcodes}}\n\n[[Category:Barcodes]]\n[[Category:Identifiers]]\n[[Category:Unique identifiers]]\n[[Category:GS1 standards]]\n", "text_old": "[[Image:EAN13.svg|thumbnail|GTIN-13 number encoded in EAN-13 barcode.

Some retailers use this for proprietary (own brand or unbranded) products, although many retailers obtain their own manufacturer's code for their own brands. Other retailers use at least part of this prefix for products which are packaged in store, for example, items weighed and served over a counter for a customer. In these cases, the barcode may encode a price, quantity or weight along with a product identifier - in a retailer defined way. The product identifier may be one assigned by the Produce Electronic Identification Board (PEIB) or may be retailer assigned. Retailers who have historically used UPC barcodes tend to use GS1 prefixes starting with \"02\" for store-packaged products.{{fact|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe EAN \"country code\" 978 (and later 979) has been allocated since the 1980s to reserve a Unique Country Code (UCC) prefix for EAN identifiers of published books, regardless of country of origin, so that the EAN space can catalog books by [[ISBN]]s<ref name=\":0\" /> rather than maintaining a redundant parallel numbering system. This is informally known as \"[[Bookland]]\". The prefix 979 with first digit 0 is used for [[ISMN|International Standard Music Number (ISMN)]] and the prefix 977 indicates [[ISSN|International Standard Serial Number (ISSN)]].\n\n===Manufacturer code===\nThe manufacturer code is a unique code assigned to each manufacturer by the numbering authority indicated by the GS1 Prefix. All products produced by a given company will use the same manufacturer code. EAN-13 uses what are called \"variable-length manufacturer codes\". Assigning fixed-length 5-digit manufacturer codes, as the UCC has done until recently, means that each manufacturer can have up to 99,999 product codes. Many manufacturers do not have that many products, which means hundreds or even thousands of potential product codes are being wasted on manufacturers that only have a few products. Thus if a potential manufacturer knows that it is only going to produce a few products, EAN-13 may issue it a longer manufacturer code, leaving less space for the product code. This results in more efficient use of the available manufacturer and product codes.<ref>{{cite web|title=EAN-13 SYMBOLOGY|url=http://www.barcodeisland.com/ean13.phtml|website=www.barcodeisland.com}}</ref>\n\nIn ISBN and ISSN, this component is used to identify the language in which the publication was issued and managed by a transnational agency covering several countries, or to identify the country where the legal deposits are made by a publisher registered with a national agency, and it is further subdivided any allocating subblocks for publishers; many countries have several prefixes allocated in the ISSN and ISBN registries.\n\n===Product code===\n\nThe product code is assigned by the manufacturer. The product code immediately follows manufacturer code. The total length of manufacturer code plus product code should be 9 or 10 digits depending on the length of country code (2-3 digits).\n\nIn ISBN, ISMN and ISSN, it uniquely identifies the publication from the same publisher; it should be used and allocated by the registered publisher in order to avoid creating gaps; however it happens that a registered book or serial never gets published and sold.\n\n===Check digit===\nThe check digit is an additional digit, used to verify that a barcode has been scanned correctly. It is computed modulo 10, where the weights in the checksum calculation alternate 3 and 1. In particular, since the weights are relatively prime to 10, the EAN-13 system will detect all single digit errors. It also recognizes 90% of transposition errors (all cases, where the difference between adjacent digits is not 5).\n\n== Calculation of checksum digit ==\n\nThe checksum is calculated as sum of products - taking an alternating weight value (3 or 1) times the value of each data digit. The checksum digit is the digit, which must be added to this checksum to get a number divisible by 10 (i.e. the additive inverse of the checksum, modulo 10).<ref>[http://www.gs1us.org/resources/tools/check-digit-calculator Check Digit Calculator], at ''GS1'' US.</ref> See [[ISBN#ISBN-13 check digit calculation|ISBN-13 check digit calculation]] for a more extensive description and algorithm. The [[Global Location Number|Global Location Number(GLN)]] also uses the same method.\n\n===Position - weight===\n\nThe weight at a specific position in the EAN code is alternating (3 or 1) in a way, that the final data digit has a weight of 3 (and thus the check digit has a weight of 1).\n\nAll [[Global Trade Item Number|Global Trade Item Number (GTIN)]] and [[Serial Shipping Container Code|Serial Shipping Container Code (SSCC)]] codes meet the next rule:\n\nNumbering the positions from the right (code aligned to the right), the odd data digits are always weight of 3 and the even data digits are always weight of 1, regardless of the length of the code.\n\nWeights for 18-digit SSCC code and GTINs (GTIN-8, GTIN-12, GTIN-13, GTIN-14):\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n! position\n| 17 || 16 || 15 || 14 || 13 || 12 || 11 || 10 || 9 || 8 || 7 || 6 || 5 || 4 || 3 || 2 || 1\n|-\n! weight\n| 3 || 1 || 3 || 1 || 3 || 1 || 3 || 1 || 3 || 1 || 3 || 1 || 3 || 1 || 3 || 1 || 3\n|}\n\nWeights for EAN-13 code:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n! position\n| 12 || 11 || 10 || 9 || 8 || 7 || 6 || 5 || 4 || 3 || 2 || 1\n|-\n! weight\n| 1 || 3 || 1 || 3 || 1 || 3 || 1 || 3 || 1 || 3 || 1 || 3\n|}\n\nWeights for EAN-8 code:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n! position\n| 7 || 6 || 5 || 4 || 3 || 2 || 1\n|-\n! weight\n| 3 || 1 || 3 || 1 || 3 || 1 || 3\n|}\n\n=== Calculation examples===\n\n* For [[EAN-13]] barcode 400638133393'''''x''''', where '''''x''''' is the unknown check digit, (Stabilo Point 88 Art.

Subtract them: 90 - 89 = 1, which is the check digit '''''x''''' of the barcode.\n\n*For [[EAN-8]] barcode 7351353'''''x''''', where '''''x''''' is the unknown check digit, the check digit calculation is...\n\n::{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! position\n| 7 || 6 || 5 || 4 || 3 || 2 || 1\n|-\n! first 7 digits of barcode\n| 7 || 3 || 5 || 1 || 3 || 5 || 3\n|-\n! weight\n| 3 || 1 || 3 || 1 || 3 || 1 || 3\n|-\n! partial sum\n| 21 || 3 || 15 || 1 || 9 || 5 || 9\n|-\n! checksum\n| || || || || || || 63\n|}\n\n::The nearest multiple of 10 that is equal to or higher than the checksum, is 70. Subtract them: 70 - 63 = 7, which is the check digit '''''x''''' of the barcode.\n\n== Binary encoding of data digits into EAN-13 barcode ==\nThe GTIN numbers, encoded to UPC-A, EAN-8 and EAN-13, all use similar encoding. The encoded data is usually repeated in plain text below the barcode.\n\n=== Barcode structure ===\n[[Image:Codering EAN-13 new.svg|thumb|Encoding EAN-13]]\n[[Image:EAN-L.png|thumb|Encoding L-digits]]\n[[Image:EAN-G.png|thumb|Encoding G-digits]]\n[[Image:EAN-R.png|thumb|Encoding R-digits]]\nThe barcode consists of 95 areas (also called modules{{cn|date=January 2019}}) of equal width.  Each area can be either white (represented here as 0) or black (represented as 1).  From left to right:\n* 3 areas for the start marker (101)\n* 42 areas (seven per digit) to encode digits 2-7, and to encode digit 1 indirectly, as described in the following section\n* 5 areas for the center marker (01010)\n* 42 areas (seven per digit) to encode digits 8-13\n* 3 areas for the end marker (101)\n\n=== Encoding of the digits ===\nTo encode the 13-digit EAN-13 number, the digits are split into 3 groups; the first digit, the first group of 6 and the last group of 6. The first group of 6 is encoded using a pattern whereby each digit has two possible encodings, one of which has even [[parity bit#Parity|parity]] (denoted with letter G) and one of which has odd parity (denoted with letter L). The first digit is not represented directly by a pattern of bars and spaces, but is encoded indirectly, by selecting a pattern of choices between these two encodings for the first group of 6 digits, according to the table below. All digits in the last group of 6 digits are encoded using a single pattern RRRRRR, the one also used for [[Universal Product Code|UPC]].\n\nIf the first digit is zero, all digits in the first group of 6 are encoded using the pattern LLLLLL used for [[Universal Product Code|UPC]], therefore, a UPC barcode is also an EAN-13 barcode with the first digit set to zero.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Structure of EAN-13\n! First digit !! First group of 6 digits !! Last group of 6 digits\n|-\n| <tt>0</tt> || <tt>LLLLLL</tt> || <tt>RRRRRR</tt>\n|-\n| <tt>1</tt> || <tt>LLGLGG</tt> || <tt>RRRRRR</tt>\n|-\n| <tt>2</tt> || <tt>LLGGLG</tt> || <tt>RRRRRR</tt>\n|-\n| <tt>3</tt> || <tt>LLGGGL</tt> || <tt>RRRRRR</tt>\n|-\n| <tt>4</tt> || <tt>LGLLGG</tt> || <tt>RRRRRR</tt>\n|-\n| <tt>5</tt> || <tt>LGGLLG</tt> || <tt>RRRRRR</tt>\n|-\n| <tt>6</tt> || <tt>LGGGLL</tt> || <tt>RRRRRR</tt>\n|-\n| <tt>7</tt> || <tt>LGLGLG</tt> || <tt>RRRRRR</tt>\n|-\n| <tt>8</tt> || <tt>LGLGGL</tt> || <tt>RRRRRR</tt>\n|-\n| <tt>9</tt> || <tt>LGGLGL</tt> || <tt>RRRRRR</tt>\n|}\nThis encoding guarantees that the first group always starts with an L-code, which has odd parity, and that the second group always starts with an R-code, which has even parity.  Thus, it does not matter whether the barcode is scanned from the left or from the right, as the scanning software can use this parity to identify the start and end of the code.\n\nEAN-8 barcodes encode all digits directly, using this scheme:\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Structure of EAN-8\n! First group of 4 digits !! Last group of 4 digits\n|-\n| <tt>LLLL</tt> || <tt>RRRR</tt>\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Encoding of the digits\n! Digit !! L-code !!

Entries in the G-column are the entries in the R-column in reverse bit order. See pictures of all codes against a colored background.\n\nA run of one or more black areas is known as a \"bar\", and a run of one or more white areas is known as a \"space\".  As can be seen in the table, each digit's encoding comprises two bars and two spaces, and the maximum width of a bar or space is four areas.\n\n=== EAN-13 barcode example ===\n[[File:Ean13-Beispiel k.png|thumb|none|upright=2.0|EAN-13 barcode. A green bar indicates the black bars and white spaces that encode a digit.]]\n* C1, C3:Start/end marker.\n* C2: Marker for the center of the barcode.\n* 6 digits in the left group: 003994.\n* 6 digits in the right group (the last digit is the check digit): 155486.\n* A digit is encoded in seven areas, by two black bars and two white spaces. Each black bar or white space can have a width between 1 and 4 areas.\n* Parity for the digits from left and right group: OEOOEE EEEEEE (O = Odd parity, E = Even parity).\n* The first digit in the EAN code: the combination of parities of the digits in the left group indirectly encodes the first digit 4.\n\nThe complete EAN-13 code is thus: 4 003994 155486.\n\n[[File:How to scan part of an EAN-13 barcode.png|thumb|Scanning part of an EAN-13 barcode.]]\n\n=== Decoding ===\n{{section-stub|date=January 2019}}\nBy using the barcode center marker, it is possible for a barcode scanner to scan just one half of the barcode at a time. This allows reconstruction of the code by means of a helical scan of the barcode by an angle of approximately 45 degrees.\n\n== Japanese Article Number ==\n{{anchor|jan}}<!-- [[Japanese Article Number]] redirect links to this subsection anchor -->\n'''Japanese Article Number''' ('''JAN''') is a barcode standard compatible with the EAN. Use of the JAN standard began in 1978. Originally, JAN was issued a flag code (EAN's number system) of 49. In 1992, JAN was newly issued an additional flag code of 45. In January 2001 the manufacturer code changed to 7 digits (9 digits including the flag code) for new companies.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.polylabel.com/barcodes/types/jancode.php | title = Bar Code Guide - Barcode Types - JAN | accessdate = 2016-05-02}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[EAN-8]], another form of EAN barcode\n* [[Electronic Data Interchange]]\n* [[European Article Numbering-Uniform Code Council]]\n* [[Global Electronic Party Information Register]] (GEPIR) a searchable distributed database of [[GS1]] GTINs\n* [[GTIN]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|International Article Number (EAN)}}\n*[https://www.gs1.org/barcodes/ean-upc International Article Number] at [[GS1]] website\n* [https://metacpan.org/search?q=barcode Barcode] [[Perl]] modules at [[CPAN]]\n* [http://marin.jb.free.fr/barcode/ An example of EAN8/13 implementation]\n* [http://www.chaosreligion.com/wtl/index.php5?title=EAN EAN MediaWiki extension], a MediaWiki extension, visualizing EAN-13/EAN-8/UPC-A/Code39/Codabar barcodes by specifying only the numbers/symbols in the wiki-text.\n* [http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/10162/Creating-EAN-Barcodes-with-C Implementing the EAN-13 barcode in C#]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160512193603/http://gepir.gs1.org/v32/xx/default.aspx?Lang=en-US%2F Global Electronic Party Information Registry (GEPIR)]\n* [https://www.upcdatabase.com upcdatabase, another online barcode database]\n* [https://www.ean-search.org/ EAN-Search, free barcode database with API, 180 million entries]\n* [https://www.dsri.jp/jan/ Official JAN homepage] {{in lang|ja}}\n\n{{Barcodes}}\n\n[[Category:Barcodes]]\n[[Category:Identifiers]]\n[[Category:Unique identifiers]]\n[[Category:GS1 standards]]\n", "name_user": "178.247.163.49", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(ETF4712376SL0)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Article_Number"}

Ansaldo & C.]], which was hoping to profit from the need for the world's navies to modernize towards heavily armored steam warships. The design was so popular that between 1894 and 1902 ten cruisers were purchased by four different countries: The first five by the [[Regia Marina|Italian Navy]], four by the [[Argentine Navy]] and one by the [[Spanish Navy]].\n\nThere is a disagreement in sources as to who originally ordered these ships. ''Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships'' states that they were ordered by the Italian Navy,<ref name=Conway>Chesneau, '' Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1860\u20131905'', p. 226.</ref> while naval historian Robert Scheina writes that it was actually Argentina.<ref>Scheina, ''Latin America'', p. 49.</ref> In any case, Argentina originally planned to name them ''Mitre'' and ''Roca'', then ''Rivadavia'' and ''Mariano Moreno'', before they sold them to the Imperial Japanese Navy before final completion in 1904, where they were renamed the {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Kasuga||2}} and {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Nisshin||2}}.<ref name=Conway/>\n\n==Design==\nDesigned by [[Edoardo Masdea]], the ''Garibaldi''-class cruiser was a hybrid between a [[cruiser]] and a [[battleship]]. At {{convert|20|kn|km/h|0}} maximum speed, the design was slightly slower than contemporary cruisers, but was very heavily armed and also heavily armored, in a package with very low displacement and moderate dimensions.\n\nThe class was unusual in that they did not have a uniform main armament. Some had single {{convert|10|in|mm|0|adj=on}} guns in [[gun turret]]s fore and aft; others (including the ''Kasuga'') had a mixed armament of a single {{convert|10|in|mm|0|adj=on}} gun in one turret and another turret with twin {{convert|8|in|mm|0|adj=on}} guns. A third variation (including ''Nisshin'') was a uniform armament of four {{convert|8|in|mm|0|adj=on}} guns, twin gun turrets fore and aft.\n\n==Ships in class==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:97%;\"\n|-\n!

After 1922, she was partially disarmed as part of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] and used as a training ship. She was bombed and sunk by US Navy carrier aircraft at Yokosuka 18 July 1945, raised and scrapped in 1948.<ref name=Conway />\n\n==={{ship|Japanese cruiser|Nisshin||2}}===\n[[File:Japanese cruiser Nisshin.jpg|thumb|300px|''Nisshin'' in 1905]]\n''Nisshin'' was originally to be named ''Roca'' but was renamed as ''Mariano Moreno'' by Argentina.

After 1922, as part of the Washington Naval Treaty she was partially disarmed and used as a training ship.

British and Arab commercial banks operating in the West Bank were closed down soon after Israel assumed power there. [[Bank Leumi]] then opened nine branches, without successfully replacing the earlier system. Farmers could get loans, but Palestinian businessmen avoided taking out loans from them since they charged 9% compared to 5% interest in Jordan.{{sfn|Cohen|1985|p=245}}{{sfn|Van Arkadie|1977|pp=112\u2013113}} By June 1967, only a third of West Bank land had been registered under Jordan's ''Settlement of Disputes over Land and Water Law'' and in 1968 Israel moved to cancel the possibility of registering one's title with the Jordanian Land Register.{{sfn|Nicoletti|Hearne|2012|p=14}} [[Ian Lustick]] states that Israel \"virtually prevented\" Palestinian investment in local industry and agriculture.{{sfn|Lustick|2018|p=11}} At the same time, Israel encouraged Arab labour to enter into Israel's economy, and regarded them as a new, expanded and protected market for Israeli exports.

With Military Order No. 393 (14 June 1970), the local commander was given the power and authority to block any construction if, in his evaluation, the building might pose a danger to Israel's security. The overall effect was to obstruct manufacturing development and subordinate any local industrial activity to the exigencies of Israel's economy, or to block the creation of industries that might compete with Israel's. For example, entrepreneurs were denied a permit for a cement factory in Hebron. In order to protect Israeli farmers, melon production was forbidden, imports of grapes and dates were banned, and limits were set to how many cucumbers and tomatoes could be produced.{{sfn|Quigley|2005|p=186}} Israeli milk producers exerted pressure on the [[Ministry of Economy (Israel)|Ministry for Industry and Trade]] to stop the establishment of a competitive dairy in [[Ramallah]].{{sfn|El-Farra|MacMillen|2000|pp=161\u2013161}}\n\nThe sum effect after two decades was that 15% of all Palestinian firms in the West Bank (and Gaza) employing over eight people, and 32% with seven or less, were prohibited from selling their products in Israel.{{sfn|El-Farra|MacMillen|2000|p=164}} Israeli [[Protectionism|protectionist policies]] thus distorted wider trade relations to the point that, by 1996, 90% of all West Bank imports came from Israel, with consumers paying more than they would for comparable products had they been able to exercise commercial autonomy.{{sfn|Kadri|1998|pp=517\u2013518}}\n\n===Legal status===\n{{main|Israeli occupation of the West Bank}}\n[[File:1947-UN-Partition-Plan-1949-Armistice-Comparison.svg|thumb|upright|alt=Map comparing the borders of the 1947 partition plan and the armistice of 1949.|{{Partition Plan-Armistice Lines comparison map legend}}]]\nFrom 1517 to 1917 the West Bank was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

[...] It is understood that realizing the full potential of such investments requires other changes as well \u2013 first, the rolling back of the movement and access restrictions in force outside Area C, which prevent the easy export of Palestinian products and inhibit tourists and investors from accessing Area C; and second, further reforms by the Palestinian Authority to better enable potential investors to register businesses, enforce contracts, and acquire finance. [...] Neglecting indirect positive effects, we estimate that the potential additional output from the sectors evaluated in this report alone would amount to at least USD 2.2 billion per annum in valued added terms \u2013 a sum equivalent to 23 percent of 2011 Palestinian GDP. The bulk of this would come from agriculture and Dead Sea minerals exploitation. [...] x. Tapping this potential output could dramatically improve the PA's fiscal position. Even without any improvements in the efficiency of tax collection, at the current rate of tax/GDP of 20 percent the additional tax revenues associated with such an increase in GDP would amount to some USD 800 million. Assuming that expenditures remain at the same level, this extra resource would notionally cut the fiscal deficit by half \u2013 significantly reducing the need for donor recurrent budget support. This major improvement in fiscal sustainability would in turn generate significant positive reputational benefits for the PA and would considerably enhance investor confidence. xi. The impact on Palestinian livelihoods would be impressive. An increase in GDP equivalent to 35 percent would be expected to create substantial employment, sufficient to put a significant dent in the currently high rate of unemployment. If an earlier estimated one-to-one relationship between growth and employment was to hold, this increase in GDP would lead to a 35 percent increase in employment. This level of growth in employment would also put a large dent in poverty, as recent estimates show that unemployed Palestinians are twice as likely to be poor as their employed counterparts. |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140801210703/http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2014/01/23/000442464_20140123122135/Rendered/PDF/AUS29220REPLAC0EVISION0January02014.pdf |archivedate= 1 August 2014 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Water supply===\n{{main|Water supply and sanitation in the Palestinian territories}}\nAmnesty International has criticized the way that the Israeli state is dealing with the regional water resources:\n\n{{quote|Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) do not have access to adequate, safe water supplies...Discriminatory Israeli policies in the OPT are the root cause of the striking disparity in access to water between Palestinians and Israelis...The inequality is even more pronounced between Palestinian communities and unlawful Israeli settlements, established in the OPT in violation of international law.

It forbids the creation among them of \"environmental sacrifice zones.\"{{sfn|Aloni|2017|p=16}} Israel, it is argued, uses the West Bank as a \"sacrifice\" zone for placing 15 waste treatment plants, which are there under less stringent rules that those required in Israel because a different legal system has been organized regarding hazardous materials that can be noxious to local people and the environment. The military authorities do not render public the details of these operations. These materials consist of such things as sewage sludge, infectious medical waste, used oils, solvents, metals, electronic waste and batteries.{{sfn|Aloni|2017|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nIn 2007 it was estimated that 38% (35 mcm a year) of all wastewater flowing into the West Bank derived from settlements and Jerusalem.{{sfn|Hareuveni|2009|p=7}} Of the 121 settlements surveyed, 81 had wastewater treatrment plant, much of it inadequate or subject to breakdown, with much sewage flowing into lowland streams and terrain where Palestinian villages are located. Only 4 of 53 indictments for waste pollution were made over the years from 2000 to 2008, whereas in Israel the laws are strictly applied and, in 2006 alone, 230 enforcements for the same abuse were enforced.{{sfn|Hareuveni|2009|pp=8\u201312}} At the same time 90\u201395% of Palestinian wastewater was not treated, with only 1 of 4 Israeli plants built in the 1970s to that purpose functioning, and the neglect to improve the infrastructure is attributed to Israeli budgetary problems.{{sfn|Hareuveni|2009|pp=19\u201321}} After the Oslo Accords, the global community earmarked $250,000,000 for West Bank wastewater infrastructure. Israel at times insisted its approval was conditional on linking the grid to Israeli settlements, which neither the donors nor Palestinians accepted. Most the infrastructure was subsequently destroyed by IDF military operations.{{sfn|Weizman|2012|p=273,n.11}} The PA did raise funds from Germany for 15 plants, but only managed to build one, at [[al-Bireh]], within Area B, though even there Israel insisted the plant process waste from the settlement of [[Psagot]], though refusing to pay fees for the treatment.{{sfn|Hareuveni|2009|pp=19\u201321}} Palestinian towns like [[Salfit]] have been deeply affected by sewage overflow channeled past the town from the settlement of Ariel.{{sfn|Ashly|2017}}{{sfn|Weizman|2012|p=273,n.14}}\n\nUnlike the data available for sewage treatment within Israel, the Israeli Water Commission refuses to provide public reports on 15&nbsp;million cubic metres of sewage flowing from Israeli settlements in the West Bank. It claims 75% is treated adequately but independent Israeli studies (2000) suggest that only 6% met Israeli treatment standards, while 48% was either not treated adequastely or discharged raw. Since then some improvements have been implemented.{{sfn|Tagar|Keinen|Bromberg|2007|pp=419\u2013420}}\n\nThe landfill near [[Al-Jiftlik]] in the [[Jericho Governorate]], built on [[Israeli land and property laws|absentee Palestinian property]] without planning or an environment impact analysis, is for the exclusive use of waste, 1,000 tons per day, produced by Israeli settlements and cities within Israel.{{sfn|HRW|2016}} Palestinians are restricted to 3 landfills, and permits for more have been denied unless the sites can be used to dump settlement garbage.

World Bank, April 2009.</ref>\n\n===Resource extraction===\nBased on the number of quarries per km<sup>2</sup> in Areas A and B, it is calculated that, were Israel to lift restrictions, a further 275 quarries could be opened in Area C.  The World Bank estimates that Israel's virtual ban on issuing Palestinians permits for quarries there costs the Palestinian economy at least US$241&nbsp;million per year.{{sfn|Niksic|Eddin|Cali|2014|p=58}}\nIn International law drawing on the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]] (Article 55), it is established that an occupying power may reap some value from the resources of the country occupied but not deplete its assets, and that the [[usufruct]] must benefit the people under occupation. The Oslo Accords agreed to hand over mining rights to the Palestinian Authority. Israel licenses eleven settlement quarries in the West Bank and they sell 94% of their material to Israel, which arguably constitutes \"depletion\" and pays royalties to its West Bank military government and settlement municipalities.{{sfn|HRW|2016}} Thus the German [[HeidelbergCement|cement firm quarrying at Nahal Raba]] paid out \u20ac430,000 ($479,000) in taxes to the [[Samaria Regional Council]] in 2014 alone.{{sfn|HRW|2016}} The Israeli High Court rejected a petition that such quarrying was a violation by stating that after 4 decades Israeli law must adapt to \"the realities on the ground\". The state did undertake not to open more quarries.{{sfn|Gross|2011}} As an illustrative example, a Human Rights Watch report contrasts the difference between a Palestinian-owned quarry company in [[Beit Fajar]] and that of a European one working on what Israeli considers its state land. The European company obtained a concession and license to harvest stone, whereas Israel refuses permits for most of the roughly 40 Beit Fajar quarries, or nearly any other Palestinian-owned quarry in the West Bank under Israeli administration.{{sfn|HRW|2016}}\n\nIsrael had denied Palestinians permits to process minerals in that area of the West Bank.{{sfn|Niksic|Eddin|Cali|2014|p=58}} The products of the Israeli cosmetics firm [[Ahava]], established in 1988, were developed in laboratories at the West Bank Dead Sea settlements of [[Mitzpe Shalem]] and [[Kalya]]. 60% of their production is sold in the EU market.{{sfn|Nicoletti|Hearne|2012|pp=21\u201322}} In 2018 The UN, stating that the violations were both \"pervasive and devastating\" to the local Palestinian population, identified some 206 companies which do business with Israeli settlements in the West Bank.{{sfn|Nebehay|2018}}\nRoughly 73 percent of global [[bromine]] production comes from Israeli and Jordanian exploitation of the Dead Sea. The potential incremental value that could accrue to the Palestinian economy from the production and sales of [[potash]], bromine and magnesium has been conservatively estimated at US$918&nbsp;million per annum, or 9 percent of GDP.{{sfn|World Bank|2013|pp=12\u201313}}{{sfn|Beckouche|2017|p=156}} The lost earnings from not being allowed to process Dead Sea minerals such as potash, and for making bromide-based flame retardants, based on calculations of comparable use by Israel and Jordan, suggest a figure of $642&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Niksic|Eddin|Cali|2014|pp=58\u201360}}\n\n===Loss of cultural property===\nAlbert Glock argued that Israel is responsible for the disappearance of significant parts of the Palestinian cultural patrimony, by confiscating Arab cultural resources. In 1967 it appropriated the Palestine Archaeological Museum{{efn|\"The one center of archaeological activity that might have provided a base for Palestinian archaeologists was the Palestine Archaeological Museum in Jerusalem, which was under the control not of Jordan but of trustees made up of the directors of the several foreign schools of archaeology in the city. It is therefore not clear why persons like [[Dimitri Baramki]] did not continue their work as archaeologists employed by the Palestine Museum. In any event, Jordan nationalized the museum only months before the June 1967 war, enabling the Israelis to claim it as theirs by right of conquest,\"{{sfn|Glock|1994|p=77}}}} and its library in East Jerusalem.{{efn|\"Fourth, the disappearance of the Palestinian patrimony (material evidence) through the deliberate confiscation of Arab cultural resources by Israelis (such as the large library of Dr. [[Tawfiq Canaan]] in 1948, the [[Rockefeller Museum|Palestine Archaeological Museum]] and its library in Jerusalem in 1967, and the library of the Palestine Research Center in Beirut in 1982), as well as the destruction of cultural property in the form of entire villages in 1948\u201349. This last is particularly crucial, since the Palestinians' link to their past is largely through the villages, few towns, and fewer cities that predominated in their land during the last thirteen centuries.\"{{sfn|Glock|1994|p=71}}}} Often these losses are personal, as when homes are ransacked and looted of their valuables. The journalist Hamdi Faraj, jailed for endangering public order, had his 500-volume library confiscated, including copies of the Bible and Qur'an and, when he applied for their restitution, was told all the books had been accidentally burnt.{{sfn|Friedman|1983|p=96}}\nThe Israeli occupation has wrought a profound change in Palestinian identity, which clings to a sense of a \"paradise lost\" before the changes brought out by the 1967 conquest.{{sfn|Kamrava|2016|p=116}}{{efn|Israeli settlers forced to evacuate their settlements have also called their prior state as one of a \"lost paradise\".{{sfn|Perugini|2014|p=55}}}}\n\n===Tourism===\n{{main|Tourism in the Palestinian territories}}\nThe Palestinian territories contain several of the most significant sites for Muslims, Christians and Jews, and are endowed with a world-class heritage highly attractive to tourists and pilgrims.{{sfn|World Bank|2013|p=20}} The West Bank Palestinians themselves have difficulties in accessing the territory for recreation.\n\nBased on 1967 figures, the Palestinian [[Dead Sea]] Coastline is roughly 40&nbsp;km in length, of which 15% (6&nbsp;kilometres) could lend itself to the same tourist infrastructure developed by Jordan and Israel in their respective areas. Were Israel to permit a parallel development of this Palestinian sector, the World Bank estimates that 2,900 jobs would be added, allowing the Palestinian economy a potential value-added input of something like $126&nbsp;million annually.{{sfn|Niksic|Eddin|Cali|2014|pp=65\u201366}} It is also the only maritime recreational outlet for West Bankers, but according to an [[Association for Civil Rights in Israel|Acri]] complaint to the Israeli Supreme Court in 2008 Palestinians are often barred or turned away from the beaches at their only access point, the [[Beit HaArava|Beit Ha'arava checkpoint]] on [[Highway 90 (Israel)|Route 90]]. Acri claimed the ban responds to fears by settlers who operate tourist concessions in this West Bank area that they will lose Jewish customers if there are too many West Bank Palestinians on the beaches.{{efn|'The ban came to light after the testimony of two Israeli army reservists who said that at the beginning of their tour of duty in May they were told that the purpose of the checkpoint was to \"prevent Palestinians coming from the Jordan Valley to the Dead Sea beaches\".. One of the reservists, Doron Karbel, testified that as a \"side note\", the Jordan Valley Brigade Commander, Colonel Yigal Slovik, had said the reason for the checkpoint was that \"when Jews and Palestinian vacationers were sitting on the beaches side by side it hurt the business of the surrounding [[yishuv]]im (Jewish communities).\" {{sfn|Macintyre|2008}} }}\nThe key Palestinian towns in the West Bank for tourism are East Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Jericho. All access points are controlled by Israel and the road system, checkpoints and obstacles in place for visitors desiring to visit Palestinian towns leaves their hotels half-empty.{{sfn|Isaac|2013|p=147}} From 92 to 94 cents in every dollar of the tourist trade goes to Israel.{{sfn|Isaac|2013|p=144}} The general itineraries under Israeli management focus predominantly on Jewish history.

At best drivers must wait for several hours for them to be returned, when, as can happen, the IDs themselves are lost as soldiers change shifts, in which case Palestinians are directed to some regional office the next day, and more checkpoints to get there.{{sfn|Efrat|2006|p=85}} Even before the Al Aqsa Intifada, [[United Nations Population Fund|UNFPA]] estimated that 20% of pregnant West Bank women were unable to access [[prenatal care]] because of the difficulties and delays caused by crossing checkpoints, and dozens were forced to deliver their children on the roadside.{{sfn|Aswad|2007}}\nConstant uncertainty and the inability to plan are the results for Palestinians of the Israeli military rules governing their movements.  The [[World Bank]] noted that additional costs arising from longer travelling caused by restrictions on movement through three major routes in the West Bank alone ran to (2013) USD 185&nbsp;million a year, adding that other, earlier calculations (2007) suggest restrictions on the Palestinian labour market cost the West Bank approximately US$229&nbsp;million per annum. It concluded that such imposed restrictions had a major negative impact on the local economy, hindering stability and growth.{{sfn|World Bank|2013|p=30}} In 2007, official Israeli statistics indicated that there were 180,000 Palestinians on Israel's secret travel ban list. 561 roadblocks and checkpoints were in place (October), the number of Palestinians licensed to drive private cars was 46,166 and the annual cost of permits was $454.{{sfn|Makdisi|2010|pp=63\u201364}} These checkpoints, together with the separation wall and the restricted networks restructure the West Bank into \"land cells\", freezing the flow of normal everyday Palestinian lives.{{sfn|Handel|2010|pp=259,261}} Israel sets up [[Random checkpoint|flying checkpoints]] without notice. Some 2,941 flying checkpoints were rigged up along West Bank roads, averaging some 327 a month, in 2017. A further 476 unstaffed physical obstacles, such as dirt mounds, concrete blocks, gates and fenced sections had been placed on roads for Palestinian use. Of the gates erected at village entrances, 59 were always closed.{{sfn|B'Tselem|2017b}} The checkpoint system did not ease up after the Oslo Accords, but was strengthened after them, which has been interpreted as suggesting their function is to assert control over Palestinians, and as a sign of an unwillingness to yield ground in the West Bank.{{sfn|Efrat|2006|p=86}} According to [[Health Minister of the Palestinian National Authority|PA Health Ministry statistics]] relating to the period from 2000 to 2006, of 68 Palestinian women who gave birth to their children while held up at checkpoints, 35 miscarried and 5 died while delivering their child there.{{sfn|BBC|2008}} [[Machsom Watch]] accumulated over a mere five years (2001\u20132006)  some 10,000 eyewitness reports and testimonies regarding the innumerable difficulties faced by Palestinians trying to negotiate West Bank checkpoints.{{sfn|Keshet|2013|p=viii}}\n\nTransportation infrastructure is particularly problematic as Palestinian use of roads in Area C is highly restricted, and travel times can be inordinate; the Palestinian Authority has also been unable to develop roads, airports or railways in or through Area C,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2013/10/18344690/west-bank-gaza-area-c-future-palestinian-economy|title=West Bank and Gaza \u2013 Area C and the future of the Palestinian economy|author=World Bank|website=|publisher=World Bank, Washington DC|accessdate=18 January 2014|year=2013|quote=UNOCHA analysis suggests that less than one percent of the land in Area C is currently available to Palestinians for construction; permit data also shows that it is almost impossible to obtain permission to build in Area C. Less than 6 percent of all requests made between 2000 and 2007 secured approval. This situation applies not only to housing but to public economic infrastructure (roads, water reservoirs, waste treatment plants) and industrial plant, and to the access roads and utility lines needed to connect Areas A and B across Area C. [...] The outbreak of the second Intifada in 2000 interrupted this trend, bringing increased violence and uncertainty \u2013 and most significantly, the intensification by Israel of a complex set of security-related restrictions that impeded the movement of people and goods and fragmented the Palestinian territories into small enclaves lacking economic cohesion.

Since 1967, Israel has allowed and even encouraged its citizens to live in the new settlements established in the territories, motivated by religious and national sentiments attached to the history of the Jewish nation in the land of Israel. This policy has also been justified in terms of security interests, taking into consideration the dangerous geographic circumstances of Israel before 1967 (where Israeli areas on the Mediterranean coast were potentially threatened by Jordanian control of the West Bank ridge). The international community, for its part, has viewed this policy as patently illegal, based on the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention that prohibit moving populations to or from territories under occupation.|issue=3|doi=10.1093/icon/mol021|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|chapter=Self-determination and population transfer|last=Drew|first=Catriona|title=Human rights, self-determination and political change in the occupied Palestinian territories|volume=52|series=International studies in human rights|editor-last=Bowen|editor-first=Stephen|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|year=1997|isbn=978-90-411-0502-8|pages=151\u2013152|quote=It can thus clearly be concluded that the transfer of Israeli settlers into the occupied territories violates not only the laws of belligerent occupation but the Palestinian right of self-determination under international law.

[...] Neglecting indirect positive effects, we estimate that the potential additional output from the sectors evaluated in this report alone would amount to at least USD 2.2 billion per annum in valued added terms \u2013 a sum equivalent to 23 percent of 2011 Palestinian GDP. The bulk of this would come from agriculture and Dead Sea minerals exploitation. [...] x. Tapping this potential output could dramatically improve the PA's fiscal position. Even without any improvements in the efficiency of tax collection, at the current rate of tax/GDP of 20 percent the additional tax revenues associated with such an increase in GDP would amount to some USD 800 million. Assuming that expenditures remain at the same level, this extra resource would notionally cut the fiscal deficit by half \u2013 significantly reducing the need for donor recurrent budget support. This major improvement in fiscal sustainability would in turn generate significant positive reputational benefits for the PA and would considerably enhance investor confidence. xi. The impact on Palestinian livelihoods would be impressive. An increase in GDP equivalent to 35 percent would be expected to create substantial employment, sufficient to put a significant dent in the currently high rate of unemployment. If an earlier estimated one-to-one relationship between growth and employment was to hold, this increase in GDP would lead to a 35 percent increase in employment. This level of growth in employment would also put a large dent in poverty, as recent estimates show that unemployed Palestinians are twice as likely to be poor as their employed counterparts. |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140801210703/http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2014/01/23/000442464_20140123122135/Rendered/PDF/AUS29220REPLAC0EVISION0January02014.pdf |archivedate= 1 August 2014 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Water supply===\n{{main|Water supply and sanitation in the Palestinian territories}}\nAmnesty International has criticized the way that the Israeli state is dealing with the regional water resources:\n\n{{quote|Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) do not have access to adequate, safe water supplies...Discriminatory Israeli policies in the OPT are the root cause of the striking disparity in access to water between Palestinians and Israelis...The inequality is even more pronounced between Palestinian communities and unlawful Israeli settlements, established in the OPT in violation of international law.

The military authorities do not render public the details of these operations. These materials consist of such things as sewage sludge, infectious medical waste, used oils, solvents, metals, electronic waste and batteries.{{sfn|Aloni|2017|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nIn 2007 it was estimated that 38% (35 mcm a year) of all wastewater flowing into the West Bank derived from settlements and Jerusalem.{{sfn|Hareuveni|2009|p=7}} Of the 121 settlements surveyed, 81 had wastewater treatrment plant, much of it inadequate or subject to breakdown, with much sewage flowing into lowland streams and terrain where Palestinian villages are located.

Israel at times insisted its approval was conditional on linking the grid to Israeli settlements, which neither the donors nor Palestinians accepted. Most the infrastructure was subsequently destroyed by IDF military operations.{{sfn|Weizman|2012|p=273,n.11}} The PA did raise funds from Germany for 15 plants, but only managed to build one, at [[al-Bireh]], within Area B, though even there Israel insisted the plant process waste from the settlement of [[Psagot]], though refusing to pay fees for the treatment.{{sfn|Hareuveni|2009|pp=19\u201321}} Palestinian towns like [[Salfit]] have been deeply affected by sewage overflow channeled past the town from the settlement of Ariel.{{sfn|Ashly|2017}}{{sfn|Weizman|2012|p=273,n.14}}\n\nUnlike the data available for sewage treatment within Israel, the Israeli Water Commission refuses to provide public reports on 15&nbsp;million cubic metres of sewage flowing from Israeli settlements in the West Bank.

The World Bank estimates that Israel's virtual ban on issuing Palestinians permits for quarries there costs the Palestinian economy at least US$241&nbsp;million per year.{{sfn|Niksic|Eddin|Cali|2014|p=58}}\nIn International law drawing on the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]] (Article 55), it is established that an occupying power may reap some value from the resources of the country occupied but not deplete its assets, and that the [[usufruct]] must benefit the people under occupation. The Oslo Accords agreed to hand over mining rights to the Palestinian Authority. Israel licenses eleven settlement quarries in the West Bank and they sell 94% of their material to Israel, which arguably constitutes \"depletion\" and pays royalties to its West Bank military government and settlement municipalities.{{sfn|HRW|2016}} Thus the German [[HeidelbergCement|cement firm quarrying at Nahal Raba]] paid out \u20ac430,000 ($479,000) in taxes to the [[Samaria Regional Council]] in 2014 alone.{{sfn|HRW|2016}} The Israeli High Court rejected a petition that such quarrying was a violation by stating that after 4 decades Israeli law must adapt to \"the realities on the ground\". The state did undertake not to open more quarries.{{sfn|Gross|2011}} As an illustrative example, a Human Rights Watch report contrasts the difference between a Palestinian-owned quarry company in [[Beit Fajar]] and that of a European one working on what Israeli considers its state land. The European company obtained a concession and license to harvest stone, whereas Israel refuses permits for most of the roughly 40 Beit Fajar quarries, or nearly any other Palestinian-owned quarry in the West Bank under Israeli administration.{{sfn|HRW|2016}}\n\nIsrael had denied Palestinians permits to process minerals in that area of the West Bank.{{sfn|Niksic|Eddin|Cali|2014|p=58}} The products of the Israeli cosmetics firm [[Ahava]], established in 1988, were developed in laboratories at the West Bank Dead Sea settlements of [[Mitzpe Shalem]] and [[Kalya]]. 60% of their production is sold in the EU market.{{sfn|Nicoletti|Hearne|2012|pp=21\u201322}} In 2018 The UN, stating that the violations were both \"pervasive and devastating\" to the local Palestinian population, identified some 206 companies which do business with Israeli settlements in the West Bank.{{sfn|Nebehay|2018}}\nRoughly 73 percent of global [[bromine]] production comes from Israeli and Jordanian exploitation of the Dead Sea. The potential incremental value that could accrue to the Palestinian economy from the production and sales of [[potash]], bromine and magnesium has been conservatively estimated at US$918&nbsp;million per annum, or 9 percent of GDP.{{sfn|World Bank|2013|pp=12\u201313}}{{sfn|Beckouche|2017|p=156}} The lost earnings from not being allowed to process Dead Sea minerals such as potash, and for making bromide-based flame retardants, based on calculations of comparable use by Israel and Jordan, suggest a figure of $642&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Niksic|Eddin|Cali|2014|pp=58\u201360}}\n\n===Loss of cultural property===\nAlbert Glock argued that Israel is responsible for the disappearance of significant parts of the Palestinian cultural patrimony, by confiscating Arab cultural resources. In 1967 it appropriated the Palestine Archaeological Museum{{efn|\"The one center of archaeological activity that might have provided a base for Palestinian archaeologists was the Palestine Archaeological Museum in Jerusalem, which was under the control not of Jordan but of trustees made up of the directors of the several foreign schools of archaeology in the city. It is therefore not clear why persons like [[Dimitri Baramki]] did not continue their work as archaeologists employed by the Palestine Museum. In any event, Jordan nationalized the museum only months before the June 1967 war, enabling the Israelis to claim it as theirs by right of conquest,\"{{sfn|Glock|1994|p=77}}}} and its library in East Jerusalem.{{efn|\"Fourth, the disappearance of the Palestinian patrimony (material evidence) through the deliberate confiscation of Arab cultural resources by Israelis (such as the large library of Dr. [[Tawfiq Canaan]] in 1948, the [[Rockefeller Museum|Palestine Archaeological Museum]] and its library in Jerusalem in 1967, and the library of the Palestine Research Center in Beirut in 1982), as well as the destruction of cultural property in the form of entire villages in 1948\u201349. This last is particularly crucial, since the Palestinians' link to their past is largely through the villages, few towns, and fewer cities that predominated in their land during the last thirteen centuries.\"{{sfn|Glock|1994|p=71}}}} Often these losses are personal, as when homes are ransacked and looted of their valuables. The journalist Hamdi Faraj, jailed for endangering public order, had his 500-volume library confiscated, including copies of the Bible and Qur'an and, when he applied for their restitution, was told all the books had been accidentally burnt.{{sfn|Friedman|1983|p=96}}\nThe Israeli occupation has wrought a profound change in Palestinian identity, which clings to a sense of a \"paradise lost\" before the changes brought out by the 1967 conquest.{{sfn|Kamrava|2016|p=116}}{{efn|Israeli settlers forced to evacuate their settlements have also called their prior state as one of a \"lost paradise\".{{sfn|Perugini|2014|p=55}}}}\n\n===Tourism===\n{{main|Tourism in the Palestinian territories}}\nThe Palestinian territories contain several of the most significant sites for Muslims, Christians and Jews, and are endowed with a world-class heritage highly attractive to tourists and pilgrims.{{sfn|World Bank|2013|p=20}} The West Bank Palestinians themselves have difficulties in accessing the territory for recreation.\n\nBased on 1967 figures, the Palestinian [[Dead Sea]] Coastline is roughly 40&nbsp;km in length, of which 15% (6&nbsp;kilometres) could lend itself to the same tourist infrastructure developed by Jordan and Israel in their respective areas.

Acri claimed the ban responds to fears by settlers who operate tourist concessions in this West Bank area that they will lose Jewish customers if there are too many West Bank Palestinians on the beaches.{{efn|'The ban came to light after the testimony of two Israeli army reservists who said that at the beginning of their tour of duty in May they were told that the purpose of the checkpoint was to \"prevent Palestinians coming from the Jordan Valley to the Dead Sea beaches\".. One of the reservists, Doron Karbel, testified that as a \"side note\", the Jordan Valley Brigade Commander, Colonel Yigal Slovik, had said the reason for the checkpoint was that \"when Jews and Palestinian vacationers were sitting on the beaches side by side it hurt the business of the surrounding [[yishuv]]im (Jewish communities).\" {{sfn|Macintyre|2008}} }}\nThe key Palestinian towns in the West Bank for tourism are East Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Jericho.

It concluded that such imposed restrictions had a major negative impact on the local economy, hindering stability and growth.{{sfn|World Bank|2013|p=30}} In 2007, official Israeli statistics indicated that there were 180,000 Palestinians on Israel's secret travel ban list. 561 roadblocks and checkpoints were in place (October), the number of Palestinians licensed to drive private cars was 46,166 and the annual cost of permits was $454.{{sfn|Makdisi|2010|pp=63\u201364}} These checkpoints, together with the separation wall and the restricted networks restructure the West Bank into \"land cells\", freezing the flow of normal everyday Palestinian lives.{{sfn|Handel|2010|pp=259,261}} Israel sets up [[Random checkpoint|flying checkpoints]] without notice.

Less than 6 percent of all requests made between 2000 and 2007 secured approval. This situation applies not only to housing but to public economic infrastructure (roads, water reservoirs, waste treatment plants) and industrial plant, and to the access roads and utility lines needed to connect Areas A and B across Area C. [...] The outbreak of the second Intifada in 2000 interrupted this trend, bringing increased violence and uncertainty \u2013 and most significantly, the intensification by Israel of a complex set of security-related restrictions that impeded the movement of people and goods and fragmented the Palestinian territories into small enclaves lacking economic cohesion.
