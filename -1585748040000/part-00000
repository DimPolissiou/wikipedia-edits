The book is divided into three parts, the first being mostly theoretical, the second one clinical, and the third one concerning more general problems. The first four articles contain most of Fairbairn's innovative concepts.  Fairbairn's work was a direct challenge to Freud's model of psychoanalysis, including his theory of psychological development, the functions and dynamics of personality, the origins of psychopathology, and the treatment of disordered individuals. In short, his goal was to replace Freudian metapsychology with his own model as noted by Greenberg and Mitchell: <blockquote>In a series of dense and fertile papers written during the  early 1940's, W.R.D. Fairbairn developed a theoretical perspective which, along with Sullivan's \"interpersonal psychiatry\", provides the purest and clearest expression of the shift from the drive/structure model to the relational/structure model (Greenberg and Mitchell, 1983:151)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Greenberg and Mitchell|first=Jay  and Stephen|title=Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-62975-2|location=|pages=151}}</ref>.</blockquote>'''Freud's psychoanalytic model''' is a drive/structure  model  in that it  proposes that  human beings are born with innate, biological drives (sex and aggression) that are contained in the unconscious Id. The infant's Id seeks discharge of its tensions regardless of the situation. When the discharging drive (hitting, biting, urinating, defecating)  comes into contact with the demands and prohibitions of society there is immediate conflict. A new structure has to emerge from the Id to insure that the drives continue to be expressed in a way permitted by society. Thus the unconscious Id, which is Freud's metaphor for the package of the (assumed)  biological  drives, is forced to develop contact with reality through the emergence of the ego. This second structure has the task of mediating  between the primitive Id and society. Later on  in development (via the Oedipal Conflict) the child internalizes the values of his parents and these internalized values become the third internal structure, which is called the Super Ego. These three hypothetical ego structures: The Id, Ego and Super Ego, mature, and grow with experience. Freud postulated that all psychological development is based on the Id seeking satisfaction, the Ego curbing the Id's most extreme demands, and the Super Ego pressing the Ego to make the morally correct choices.         \n\n'''Fairbairn's model''' is a relational/structure model in that the human psyche develops its structure from actual human experience, and not from the pressure exerted by the Id (which does not exist in Fairbairn's metapsychology). The human psyche develops structures based on actual interpersonal events. Internal ego structures can be understood to be '''packages of memories''' that coalesce and form internal representations of the '''parents''', of the '''child''' himself, and of the child's relationship to them. Fairbairn's structural theory develops as a consequence of empathic failures of the parents that are too disruptive for the child's under developed central ego to remember.  Awareness of these failures would interfere with the child's absolute dependency on his parents, and knowledge of them would destroy his necessary illusion that he is loved and cherished. In primitive families where punishment is frequent, the child can be overwhelmed by parental aggression and faces the loss of his sense of self, as described by Bromberg in the following quote.     <blockquote>Psychological trauma occurs in situations, explicitly or implicitly interpersonal, in which self-invalidation (sometimes self-annihilation) cannot be escaped from or prevented, and from which there is no hope of protection, relief, or soothing. If the experience is either prolonged, assaultively violent, or if self-development is weak or immature, then the level of affective arousal is too great for the event to be experienced self-reflectively and given meaning through cognitive processing. ..At its extreme, the subjective experience is that of a chaotic and terrifying flooding of affect that threatens to overwhelm sanity and psychological survival (Bromberg, 1998, 12).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bromberg|first=Philip|title=Standing in The Spaces: Essays on Clinical Process, Trauma and Dissociation|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=0-88163-356-9|location=|pages=12}}</ref>     \n\n     </blockquote>Over time, these dissociated events, including those where the child's sense of self was endangered, become ego structures in the individual's internal world (See the following section on splitting of the ego for a detailed explanation of this process). Thus the human psyche is structured over time based on split off traumas that are unavailable to the individual's central ego. This is a very different structural model when compared to Freud's. In Fairbairn's model the  unconscious is ''developed'' (not inherited) from parental failures and interpersonal traumas that were dissociated because they were too disruptive to remember.\n\n=== Schizoid Factors in the Personality  (1940) ===\nFairbairn's first paper introduced his observation that many of his patient's appeared to be \"schizoid\" a condition that he defined as being a direct result of having splits in their ego structure. He noted that these patients had three observable characteristics.<blockquote>These are (1) an attitude of omnipotence, (2) an attitude of isolation and detachment and, (3) a preoccupation with inner reality....So as far as the preoccupation with inner reality is concerned, this is undoubtedly the most important of all schizoid characteristics; and it is not the less present whether inner reality be substituted for outer reality, identified with outer reality or superimposed upon outer reality (Fairbairn,1952, p:6-7).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Fairbairn|first=William Ronald Dodds|title=Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=0-7100-1361-2|location=London|pages=}}</ref>      </blockquote>He noted that the schizoid condition was do to split off (dissociated) interpersonal experiences which were unknown to the conscious \"central ego\".  The schizoid style of relating (or rather, non-relating) to others was originated from repeated rejections of the child's legitimate need for love during his developmental years. The schizoid was raised by a mother who was unable  to relate to her child  with tender, loving  emotions  and as a direct consequence of this rejection, the child withdraws into his inner world which is safer, but ultimately less satisfying. Fairbairn spells this out in bold and uncompromising manner as the following quote illustrates.<blockquote>Regressive reinstatement of the early oral attitude would appear to be most readily brought about by a situation of emotional frustration in which the child comes to feel (a) that he is not really loved for himself as a person by his mother, and (b) that his own love for his mother is not really valued and accepted by her. This is a highly traumatic situation  giving rise to a further situation characterized as follows: (a) the child comes to regard his mother as a bad object in so far as she does not seem to love him, (b) The child comes to regard outward expressions of his own love as bad, with the result that...he tends to retain his love inside of himself. (C) The child comes to feel that love relationships with external objects in general are bad, or at least precarious, (Fairbairn, 1952:17-18)<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>Thus, Fairbairn saw that the lack of love in a young child's life was traumatic, and also caused splits in his ego. Typically, Fairbairn waited until later in his writing to inform the reader how and why certain material was deleted from the child's memory by dissociation, as the first four papers exposed his thought processes as he worked on and developed his full theory.  \n\n=== A Revised Psychopathology of the Psychoses and Psychoneuroses  (1941) ===\nFairbairn gradually formed his model in these first four papers. He  challenged Freud drive theory directly in this second paper by  stating \"Nevertheless,it would appear as if the point had now been reached at which, in the interest of progress,the classical libido theory would have to be transformed into ''a theory of development based essentially upon object-relationships,'' Fairbairn (1952,p,31).<ref name=\":2\" />  Unfortunately, this shift in focus was to great for the analytic community to accept, because Freud's entire model  was based on the existence and activity of libidinal drives. All of psychoanalysis was Freudian, there were no other options, and Fairbairn asked his colleagues to choose between his model and Freud's. They overwhelming chose Freud. From his point on, his model was seen as an interesting intellectual exercise, rather than as a viable analytic model that would, over time, become more powerful than Libido Theory.\nFairbairn proposed an outline of a developmental model in this chapter as well. He noted that human development was characterized by a gradual differentation (separation) from the parent because of he development of a mature, reality based central ego in the child.<blockquote>The development of object-relationships is essentially a process whereby infantile dependence upon the object gradually gives place to mature dependence upon the object. The process of development is characterized (a) by the gradual abandonment of an original object relationship based on primary identification, and (b) the gradual adoption of an object-relationship based upon differentiation of the object (Fairbairn, 1952, p.34)<ref name=\":2\" />\n<br /></blockquote>\nThus, the developmental process requires that the individual no longer sees himself as part of his mother, but rather as an independent, fully functioning person.The problem lies in the reality that many children are not supported and loved sufficiently to go through the \"transitional\" stage easily,as Fairbairn noted in one of his most famous quotes.<blockquote>\nThe greatest need of of a child is to obtain conclusive assurance (a) that he is genuinely loved as a person by his parents, and (b) that his parents genuinely accept his love. It is only in so far as such assurance is forthcoming in a form sufficiently convincing to enable him to depend safely upon his real objects that he is able to gradually renounce infantile dependence without misgiving. In the absence of such assurance his relationships to his objects is fraught with too much anxiety over separation to enable him to renounce the attitude of infantile dependence: for such a renunciation would be equivalent in his eyes to forfeiting all hope of ever obtaining the satisfaction of his unsatisfied emotional needs. Frustration of his desire to be loved as a person,and to have his love accepted is the greatest trauma that a child can experience (Fairbairn, 1952, p.39-40)<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\n</blockquote>\nFairbairn's language is a bit overwrought, but in essence he says that the dependent child cannot mature with being sure that his parents love and support him, which gives him enough courage to let them go and establish new relationships with peers and future partners. The child who is unsure of his parents love remains emotionally underdeveloped, and often remains at home, or nearby,  trying to obtain the love that was not forthcoming in his developmental history (Celani, 2005)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=Leaving Home|publisher=Columbia Universities Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13477-4|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Innovative concepts==\n\n===The object-seeking libido===\nOne of the most important contributions of Fairbairn to the psychoanalytic paradigm is proposing an alternative viewpoint regarding the libido. Whereas [[Freud]] assumed that the [[libido]] is pleasure seeking, Fairbairn thought of the libido as object seeking.<ref>{{cite book | authorlink=Peter Fuller|last=Fuller|first=Peter | title=Introduction to \"Psychoanalysis and after\" | publisher=Chatto | year=1985|isbn=0-7011-2971-9|page=18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fairbairn|first=W.

The first connections a child makes are with his parents. Through diverse forms of contact between the child and his parents, a bond between them is formed. When the bond is formed, the child becomes strongly attached to his parents. This early relationship shapes the emotional life of the child in such a strong way that it determines the emotional experiences that the child will have later on in life, because the early libidinal objects become the prototypes for all later experience of connection with others.\n\n===Internal object relations===\nFairbairn states that the [[object relations]] a child has very early on in life become the child's prototypes for all later experiences regarding connections with others. The internal [[object relations|object relation]] describes a relation which exists in the person's mind. In the normal situation, healthy parenting results in a child with an outward orientation towards real people, who can give real contact and exchange. When the needs of the child are not met by the parents (e.g. [[dependency need]]s and the need for affirmative interactions) a pathological turning away from external reality takes place. Instead of actual exchange with others, fantasised, private presences are established, the so-called internal objects. To these internal objects the child relates in fantasised connections, the internal object relations.\n\n===The splitting of the ego===\n{{Main|Splitting (psychology)}}\nFairbairn recognized that  children are  totally and absolutely dependent on their parents. Because of this dependency they cannot tolerate \"knowing\" that their parents are indifferent, abandoning, and perhaps even abusive. They solve the problem of \"knowing\" about their parents' rejection of them by dissociating memories of interactions that were intolerable to accept. The defense of dissociation was seen as an extreme defense that was only used  in life-threatening situations. Fairbairn had worked in an orphanage associated with the University of Edinburgh <ref>{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's journey into the interior|last=Sutherland, John Derg, 1905- ...|date=1999|publisher=Free Association Books|isbn=1-85343-059-5|oclc=470458410}}</ref>as one of his part-time appointments and his experiences with children separated from their families alerted him to the reality that the child's extreme dependency on their parents makes any abandonment a major trauma. The powerful defense called dissociation was needed to erase the event from their consciousness. The memory of the rejecting parent, along with the  memory of the child's response to that parent, are forced into the unconscious and held there by repression. This allows the child to continue loving a parent that he sees as completely supportive. Once dissociated, these memories of the child in relationship to the parent become internal ego structures over time. In families where rejection is commonplace, the thousands upon thousands of dissociated memories accrue and become powerful sub-personalities. Memories of the angry, annoyed, rejecting or indifferent parent must be dissociated for if the child were to \"see\" this reality it would destroy his dependency relationship on the parent and he would face an abandonment crisis. In addition to the memories of the rejecting parent (The Rejecting Object in Fairbairn's model) the child must also dissociate memories of himself during the interpersonally rejecting interactions. Fairbairn called the ego structure that develops from the dissociated memories of  the child's  self  as he reacted to the parent's rejection of him and his legitimate needs, the Antilibidinal Ego. These memories of the self as fearful, defeated, shamed and humiliated cannot be tolerated consciously. The antagonistic and bickering  relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the internalized rejecting object that are held in the inner world continues unabated in dialogues between them, as described by Ogden (2018); \n\n\" Neither the rejecting object nor the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego) is willing or able to think about, much less relinquish, that tie. In fact, there is no desire on the part of either to change anything about their mutual dependence. The power of that bond is impossible to overestimate. The rejecting object and the internal saboteur are determined to nurse their feelings of having been deeply wronged, cheated, humiliated, betrayed, exploited, treated unfairly, discriminated against, and so on.The mistreatment at the hands of the other is felt to be unforgivable. An apology is forever expected by each, but never offered by either.\"<ref>{{Citation|last=Ogden|first=Thomas H.|chapter=Why read Fairbairn? *|date=2018-03-08|pages=131\u2013146|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-429-47453-8|doi=10.4324/9780429474538-12|title=Fairbairn and the Object Relations Tradition}}</ref>  \n\nWithin the child's inner world (his unconscious) the Antilibidinal Ego relates only to the \"Rejecting Object\", and this pair of self and object structures are unknown to the conscious Central Ego that is in contact with the acceptable aspects of the parent (the Ideal Object) and with external reality.  In extremely negative families there are so few supportive, positive interactions with the parents that the child is forced, by necessity  to create hope for himself by developing a second set of views of himself in relationship to his parent. In Fairbairn's model the need of the child for a positive parent is so intense that he creates a \"good\" parent  for himself. That is, without a loving parent the child's bond and attachment to his parent would be broken, and he would experience a sense of complete abandonment. The child avoids this crisis by creating of a second vision of the parent, one that is based on idealization and fantasy which (mis) perceives the parent as filled with the potential of love. This second vision of the parent is built out of the occasional positive or tender interaction that he has experienced with his mostly rejecting parents. These rare supportive interactions are enhanced by fantasy and become a second unconscious view of the parent as loving and supportive. This potentially loving fantasy-based parent (which becomes an ego structure) was called the Exciting Object by Fairbairn, and the child's self  that relates to it was called the Libidinal Ego (or Self).  The attachment between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object is intense as they struggle to convince each other of their claims against the other. Similarly. the attachment between the intensely needy Libidinal Ego and the Exciting Object is equally powerful. The combination of the attachments of these  two mostly unconscious selves to these part objects constitutes what Fairbairn defined as an attachment to the '''Bad Object'''.  The Bad Object has two facets- the Antilibidinal Ego argues with and complains about its mistreatment to the Rejecting Object in an attempt to reform it,  while the Libidinal Ego seeks ways to find out how to please the Exciting Object which promises it love which is  always out of reach. \n\nThese two unconscious pairs (The Antilibidinal Ego that relates to the Rejecting Object, and the Libidinal Ego that relates only to the Exciting Object) are unknown to each other and to the Central Ego. Splitting allows the child to hate the rejecting object with a feral rage, and to love the Exciting Object with all its heart. Splitting is a defense that prevents the integration of Good and Bad Object memories into a single whole Object. Thus, the individual  never develops \"object constancy\" which is the ability to see a person's goodness, even when they are being rejected or frustrated by that person. Thus, a very important developmental milestone is not achieved and the individual functions at an earlier stage of development, often throughout life. Splitting causes the individual to respond to external objects as if they were two different people. When the individual is frustrated they see the object as \"all bad\" and devoid of any goodness. Conversely, when they are dominated by their  Libidinal Ego structure they see the object as \"all good\". Developmentally, this is equivalent to the child who screams at her mother in a rage and minutes later says \"I love you Mommy\". There is no memory of the other ego state. Equally importantly, powerful, emotional filled memories are dissociated which impoverishes, and weakens the Central Ego, which is unaware of significant realities from its developmental history.<ref>{{Cite book|url=isbn 978-0-231-14907-5|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting Columbia University Press|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-3-11-053768-0|location=|pages=|oclc=1007218368}}</ref>\n\n'''Fairbairn's Structural Model'''\n\nEmotional deprivation and the resulting fear of abandonment leads to splitting of the ego and the split ego eventuates into Fairbairn's s Structural Theory. As just described, the psyche is split into three pairs of selves that relate to three separate objects. The three pairs of structures relate only to each other and are unaware of the other two pairs. In effect, this structural model is the beginning stage of a multiple personality, however it never develops beyond this steady state. As described, the Central Ego develops in relationship to the supportive and nurturing parent(s), the Ideal Object(s). The strength and size of the Central Ego varies from child to child according to how many positive, ego enhancing activities and interpersonal events they have experienced during their development. Fairbairn's model assumes that actual events in reality summate in both the conscious central ego and in the unconscious structures as well. Thus large numbers of loving, non intrusive, and emotionally supportive interactions with the parent(s) enhance the child's central ego through  daily positive relating. As the child develops over time his trust in others allows him to interact with new adults and children and is able to develop  new skills, as well as enlarge a more complex view of himself through interactions with other who see aspects of himself that his parent's have not discovered. \n\nIn  less favorable developmental conditions, where support, nurturance and reassurance  is scarce or absent, the child's Central Ego does not develop a richer and more rounded sense of self, rather the  development of his central ego is thwarted rather than enhanced. At the same time,  his many negative experiences are being dissociated and repressed, and his Central Ego is losing sight the many important (but negative) events in his childhood, which are banished (and remain) in his unconscious structures.  The ratio of conscious to unconscious structures shifts away from conscious relationships with external objects to the child's powerful and richly populated unconscious, with the endless bickering between the antilibidinal ego and the rejecting object, and the unrealistic fantasy world of the libidinal ego seeking the key to the love that it assumes (incorrectly) is stored in their parent.

The book is divided into three parts, the first being mostly theoretical, the second one clinical, and the third one concerning more general problems. The first four articles contain most of Fairbairn's innovative concepts.  Fairbairn's work was a direct challenge to Freud's model of psychoanalysis, including his theory of psychological development, the functions and dynamics of personality, the origins of psychopathology, and the treatment of disordered individuals. In short, his goal was to replace Freudian metapsychology with his own model as noted by Greenberg and Mitchell: <blockquote>In a series of dense and fertile papers written during the  early 1940's, W.R.D. Fairbairn developed a theoretical perspective which, along with Sullivan's \"interpersonal psychiatry\", provides the purest and clearest expression of the shift from the drive/structure model to the relational/structure model (Greenberg and Mitchell, 1983:151)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Greenberg and Mitchell|first=Jay  and Stephen|title=Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-62975-2|location=|pages=151}}</ref>.</blockquote>'''Freud's psychoanalytic model''' is a drive/structure  model  in that it  proposes that  human beings are born with innate, biological drives (sex and aggression) that are contained in the unconscious Id. The infant's Id seeks discharge of its tensions regardless of the situation. When the discharging drive (hitting, biting, urinating, defecating)  comes into contact with the demands and prohibitions of society there is immediate conflict. A new structure has to emerge from the Id to insure that the drives continue to be expressed in a way permitted by society. Thus the unconscious Id, which is Freud's metaphor for the package of the (assumed)  biological  drives, is forced to develop contact with reality through the emergence of the ego. This second structure has the task of mediating  between the primitive Id and society. Later on  in development (via the Oedipal Conflict) the child internalizes the values of his parents and these internalized values become the third internal structure, which is called the Super Ego. These three hypothetical ego structures: The Id, Ego and Super Ego, mature, and grow with experience. Freud postulated that all psychological development is based on the Id seeking satisfaction, the Ego curbing the Id's most extreme demands, and the Super Ego pressing the Ego to make the morally correct choices.         \n\n'''Fairbairn's model''' is a relational/structure model in that the human psyche develops its structure from actual human experience, and not from the pressure exerted by the Id (which does not exist in Fairbairn's metapsychology). The human psyche develops structures based on actual interpersonal events. Internal ego structures can be understood to be '''packages of memories''' that coalesce and form internal representations of the '''parents''', of the '''child''' himself, and of the child's relationship to them. Fairbairn's structural theory develops as a consequence of empathic failures of the parents that are too disruptive for the child's under developed central ego to remember.  Awareness of these failures would interfere with the child's absolute dependency on his parents, and knowledge of them would destroy his necessary illusion that he is loved and cherished. In primitive families where punishment is frequent, the child can be overwhelmed by parental aggression and faces the loss of his sense of self, as described by Bromberg in the following quote.     <blockquote>Psychological trauma occurs in situations, explicitly or implicitly interpersonal, in which self-invalidation (sometimes self-annihilation) cannot be escaped from or prevented, and from which there is no hope of protection, relief, or soothing. If the experience is either prolonged, assaultively violent, or if self-development is weak or immature, then the level of affective arousal is too great for the event to be experienced self-reflectively and given meaning through cognitive processing. ..At its extreme, the subjective experience is that of a chaotic and terrifying flooding of affect that threatens to overwhelm sanity and psychological survival (Bromberg, 1998, 12).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bromberg|first=Philip|title=Standing in The Spaces: Essays on Clinical Process, Trauma and Dissociation|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=0-88163-356-9|location=|pages=12}}</ref>     \n\n     </blockquote>Over time, these dissociated events, including those where the child's sense of self was endangered, become ego structures in the individual's internal world (See the following section on splitting of the ego for a detailed explanation of this process). Thus the human psyche is structured over time based on split off traumas that are unavailable to the individual's central ego. This is a very different structural model when compared to Freud's. In Fairbairn's model the  unconscious is ''developed'' (not inherited) from parental failures and interpersonal traumas that were dissociated because they were too disruptive to remember.\n\n=== Schizoid Factors in the Personality  (1940) ===\nFairbairn's first paper introduced his observation that many of his patient's appeared to be \"schizoid\" a condition that he defined as being a direct result of having splits in their ego structure. He noted that these patients had three observable characteristics.<blockquote>These are (1) an attitude of omnipotence, (2) an attitude of isolation and detachment and, (3) a preoccupation with inner reality....So as far as the preoccupation with inner reality is concerned, this is undoubtedly the most important of all schizoid characteristics; and it is not the less present whether inner reality be substituted for outer reality, identified with outer reality or superimposed upon outer reality (Fairbairn,1952, p:6-7).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Fairbairn|first=William Ronald Dodds|title=Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=0-7100-1361-2|location=London|pages=}}</ref>      </blockquote>He noted that the schizoid condition was do to split off (dissociated) interpersonal experiences which were unknown to the conscious \"central ego\".  The schizoid style of relating (or rather, non-relating) to others was originated from repeated rejections of the child's legitimate need for love during his developmental years. The schizoid was raised by a mother who was unable  to relate to her child  with tender, loving  emotions  and as a direct consequence of this rejection, the child withdraws into his inner world which is safer, but ultimately less satisfying. Fairbairn spells this out in bold and uncompromising manner as the following quote illustrates.<blockquote>Regressive reinstatement of the early oral attitude would appear to be most readily brought about by a situation of emotional frustration in which the child comes to feel (a) that he is not really loved for himself as a person by his mother, and (b) that his own love for his mother is not really valued and accepted by her. This is a highly traumatic situation  giving rise to a further situation characterized as follows: (a) the child comes to regard his mother as a bad object in so far as she does not seem to love him, (b) The child comes to regard outward expressions of his own love as bad, with the result that...he tends to retain his love inside of himself. (C) The child comes to feel that love relationships with external objects in general are bad, or at least precarious, (Fairbairn, 1952:17-18)<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>Thus, Fairbairn saw that the lack of love in a young child's life was traumatic, and also caused splits in his ego. Typically, Fairbairn waited until later in his writing to inform the reader how and why certain material was deleted from the child's memory by dissociation, as the first four papers exposed his thought processes as he worked on and developed his full theory.  \n\n=== A Revised Psychopathology of the Psychoses and Psychoneuroses  (1941) ===\nFairbairn gradually formed his model in these first four papers. He  challenged Freud drive theory directly in this second paper by  stating \"Nevertheless,it would appear as if the point had now been reached at which, in the interest of progress,the classical libido theory would have to be transformed into ''a theory of development based essentially upon object-relationships,'' Fairbairn (1952,p,31).<ref name=\":2\" />  Unfortunately, this shift in focus was to great for the analytic community to accept, because Freud's entire model  was based on the existence and activity of libidinal drives. All of psychoanalysis was Freudian, there were no other options, and Fairbairn asked his colleagues to choose between his model and Freud's. They overwhelming chose Freud. From his point on, his model was seen as an interesting intellectual exercise, rather than as a viable analytic model that would, over time, become more powerful than Libido Theory.\nFairbairn proposed an outline of a developmental model in this chapter as well. He noted that human development was characterized by a gradual differentation (separation) from the parent because of he development of a mature, reality based central ego in the child.<blockquote>The development of object-relationships is essentially a process whereby infantile dependence upon the object gradually gives place to mature dependence upon the object. The process of development is characterized (a) by the gradual abandonment of an original object relationship based on primary identification, and (b) the gradual adoption of an object-relationship based upon differentiation of the object (Fairbairn, 1952, p.34)<ref name=\":2\" />\n<br /></blockquote>\nThus, the developmental process requires that the individual no longer sees himself as part of his mother, but rather as an independent, fully functioning person.The problem lies in the reality that many children are not supported and loved sufficiently to go through the \"transitional\" stage easily,as Fairbairn noted in one of his most famous quotes.<blockquote>\nThe greatest need of of a child is to obtain conclusive assurance (a) that he is genuinely loved as a person by his parents, and (b) that his parents genuinely accept his love. It is only in so far as such assurance is forthcoming in a form sufficiently convincing to enable him to depend safely upon his real objects that he is able to gradually renounce infantile dependence without misgiving. In the absence of such assurance his relationships to his objects is fraught with too much anxiety over separation to enable him to renounce the attitude of infantile dependence: for such a renunciation would be equivalent in his eyes to forfeiting all hope of ever obtaining the satisfaction of his unsatisfied emotional needs. Frustration of his desire to be loved as a person,and to have his love accepted is the greatest trauma that a child can experience (Fairbairn, 1952, p.39-40)<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\n</blockquote>\nFairbairn's language is a bit overwrought, but in essence he says that the dependent child cannot mature with being sure that his parents love and support him, which gives him enough courage to let them go and establish new relationships with peers and future partners. The child who is unsure of his parents love remains emotionally underdeveloped, and often remains at home, or nearby,  trying to obtain the love that was not forthcoming in his developmental history (Celani, 2005)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=Leaving Home|publisher=Columbia Universities Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13477-4|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Innovative concepts==\n\n===The object-seeking libido===\nOne of the most important contributions of Fairbairn to the psychoanalytic paradigm is proposing an alternative viewpoint regarding the libido. Whereas [[Freud]] assumed that the [[libido]] is pleasure seeking, Fairbairn thought of the libido as object seeking.<ref>{{cite book | authorlink=Peter Fuller|last=Fuller|first=Peter | title=Introduction to \"Psychoanalysis and after\" | publisher=Chatto | year=1985|isbn=0-7011-2971-9|page=18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fairbairn|first=W.

The first connections a child makes are with his parents. Through diverse forms of contact between the child and his parents, a bond between them is formed. When the bond is formed, the child becomes strongly attached to his parents. This early relationship shapes the emotional life of the child in such a strong way that it determines the emotional experiences that the child will have later on in life, because the early libidinal objects become the prototypes for all later experience of connection with others.\n\n===Internal object relations===\nFairbairn states that the [[object relations]] a child has very early on in life become the child's prototypes for all later experiences regarding connections with others. The internal [[object relations|object relation]] describes a relation which exists in the person's mind. In the normal situation, healthy parenting results in a child with an outward orientation towards real people, who can give real contact and exchange. When the needs of the child are not met by the parents (e.g. [[dependency need]]s and the need for affirmative interactions) a pathological turning away from external reality takes place. Instead of actual exchange with others, fantasised, private presences are established, the so-called internal objects. To these internal objects the child relates in fantasised connections, the internal object relations.\n\n===The splitting of the ego===\n{{Main|Splitting (psychology)}}\nFairbairn recognized that  children are  totally and absolutely dependent on their parents. Because of this dependency they cannot tolerate \"knowing\" that their parents are indifferent, abandoning, and perhaps even abusive. They solve the problem of \"knowing\" about their parents' rejection of them by dissociating memories of interactions that were intolerable to accept. The defense of dissociation was seen as an extreme defense that was only used  in life-threatening situations. Fairbairn had worked in an orphanage associated with the University of Edinburgh <ref>{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's journey into the interior|last=Sutherland, John Derg, 1905- ...|date=1999|publisher=Free Association Books|isbn=1-85343-059-5|oclc=470458410}}</ref>as one of his part-time appointments and his experiences with children separated from their families alerted him to the reality that the child's extreme dependency on their parents makes any abandonment a major trauma. The powerful defense called dissociation was needed to erase the event from their consciousness. The memory of the rejecting parent, along with the  memory of the child's response to that parent, are forced into the unconscious and held there by repression. This allows the child to continue loving a parent that he sees as completely supportive. Once dissociated, these memories of the child in relationship to the parent become internal ego structures over time. In families where rejection is commonplace, the thousands upon thousands of dissociated memories accrue and become powerful sub-personalities. Memories of the angry, annoyed, rejecting or indifferent parent must be dissociated for if the child were to \"see\" this reality it would destroy his dependency relationship on the parent and he would face an abandonment crisis. In addition to the memories of the rejecting parent (The Rejecting Object in Fairbairn's model) the child must also dissociate memories of himself during the interpersonally rejecting interactions. Fairbairn called the ego structure that develops from the dissociated memories of  the child's  self  as he reacted to the parent's rejection of him and his legitimate needs, the Antilibidinal Ego. These memories of the self as fearful, defeated, shamed and humiliated cannot be tolerated consciously. The antagonistic and bickering  relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the internalized rejecting object that are held in the inner world continues unabated in dialogues between them, as described by Ogden (2018); \n\n\" Neither the rejecting object nor the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego) is willing or able to think about, much less relinquish, that tie. In fact, there is no desire on the part of either to change anything about their mutual dependence. The power of that bond is impossible to overestimate. The rejecting object and the internal saboteur are determined to nurse their feelings of having been deeply wronged, cheated, humiliated, betrayed, exploited, treated unfairly, discriminated against, and so on.The mistreatment at the hands of the other is felt to be unforgivable. An apology is forever expected by each, but never offered by either.\"<ref>{{Citation|last=Ogden|first=Thomas H.|chapter=Why read Fairbairn? *|date=2018-03-08|pages=131\u2013146|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-429-47453-8|doi=10.4324/9780429474538-12|title=Fairbairn and the Object Relations Tradition}}</ref>  \n\nWithin the child's inner world (his unconscious) the Antilibidinal Ego relates only to the \"Rejecting Object\", and this pair of self and object structures are unknown to the conscious Central Ego that is in contact with the acceptable aspects of the parent (the Ideal Object) and with external reality.  In extremely negative families there are so few supportive, positive interactions with the parents that the child is forced, by necessity  to create hope for himself by developing a second set of views of himself in relationship to his parent. In Fairbairn's model the need of the child for a positive parent is so intense that he creates a \"good\" parent  for himself. That is, without a loving parent the child's bond and attachment to his parent would be broken, and he would experience a sense of complete abandonment. The child avoids this crisis by creating of a second vision of the parent, one that is based on idealization and fantasy which (mis) perceives the parent as filled with the potential of love. This second vision of the parent is built out of the occasional positive or tender interaction that he has experienced with his mostly rejecting parents. These rare supportive interactions are enhanced by fantasy and become a second unconscious view of the parent as loving and supportive. This potentially loving fantasy-based parent (which becomes an ego structure) was called the Exciting Object by Fairbairn, and the child's self  that relates to it was called the Libidinal Ego (or Self).  The attachment between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object is intense as they struggle to convince each other of their claims against the other. Similarly. the attachment between the intensely needy Libidinal Ego and the Exciting Object is equally powerful. The combination of the attachments of these  two mostly unconscious selves to these part objects constitutes what Fairbairn defined as an attachment to the '''Bad Object'''.  The Bad Object has two facets- the Antilibidinal Ego argues with and complains about its mistreatment to the Rejecting Object in an attempt to reform it,  while the Libidinal Ego seeks ways to find out how to please the Exciting Object which promises it love which is  always out of reach. \n\nThese two unconscious pairs (The Antilibidinal Ego that relates to the Rejecting Object, and the Libidinal Ego that relates only to the Exciting Object) are unknown to each other and to the Central Ego. Splitting allows the child to hate the rejecting object with a feral rage, and to love the Exciting Object with all its heart. Splitting is a defense that prevents the integration of Good and Bad Object memories into a single whole Object. Thus, the individual  never develops \"object constancy\" which is the ability to see a person's goodness, even when they are being rejected or frustrated by that person. Thus, a very important developmental milestone is not achieved and the individual functions at an earlier stage of development, often throughout life. Splitting causes the individual to respond to external objects as if they were two different people. When the individual is frustrated they see the object as \"all bad\" and devoid of any goodness. Conversely, when they are dominated by their  Libidinal Ego structure they see the object as \"all good\". Developmentally, this is equivalent to the child who screams at her mother in a rage and minutes later says \"I love you Mommy\". There is no memory of the other ego state. Equally importantly, powerful, emotional filled memories are dissociated which impoverishes, and weakens the Central Ego, which is unaware of significant realities from its developmental history.<ref>{{Cite book|url=isbn 978-0-231-14907-5|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting Columbia University Press|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-3-11-053768-0|location=|pages=|oclc=1007218368}}</ref>\n\n'''Fairbairn's Structural Model'''\n\nEmotional deprivation and the resulting fear of abandonment leads to splitting of the ego and the split ego eventuates into Fairbairn's s Structural Theory. As just described, the psyche is split into three pairs of selves that relate to three separate objects. The three pairs of structures relate only to each other and are unaware of the other two pairs. In effect, this structural model is the beginning stage of a multiple personality, however it never develops beyond this steady state. As described, the Central Ego develops in relationship to the supportive and nurturing parent(s), the Ideal Object(s). The strength and size of the Central Ego varies from child to child according to how many positive, ego enhancing activities and interpersonal events they have experienced during their development. Fairbairn's model assumes that actual events in reality summate in both the conscious central ego and in the unconscious structures as well. Thus large numbers of loving, non intrusive, and emotionally supportive interactions with the parent(s) enhance the child's central ego through  daily positive relating. As the child develops over time his trust in others allows him to interact with new adults and children and is able to develop  new skills, as well as enlarge a more complex view of himself through interactions with other who see aspects of himself that his parent's have not discovered. \n\nIn  less favorable developmental conditions, where support, nurturance and reassurance  is scarce or absent, the child's Central Ego does not develop a richer and more rounded sense of self, rather the  development of his central ego is thwarted rather than enhanced. At the same time,  his many negative experiences are being dissociated and repressed, and his Central Ego is losing sight the many important (but negative) events in his childhood, which are banished (and remain) in his unconscious structures.  The ratio of conscious to unconscious structures shifts away from conscious relationships with external objects to the child's powerful and richly populated unconscious, with the endless bickering between the antilibidinal ego and the rejecting object, and the unrealistic fantasy world of the libidinal ego seeking the key to the love that it assumes (incorrectly) is stored in their parent. This powerful unconscious influences the weakened central ego and is the source of both transference and repetition compulsions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory In the Clinical Setting|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=New York|pages=51\u201371}}</ref> When any individual superimposes or projects his inner structures on an external object (for instance, his Rejecting Object) then he is going to misperceive that individual's intentions and behavior  and relate to him in a passive-aggressive and hostile manner.

According to Dr. Nadia Nikitenko, a historian who has studied the cathedral for 30 years, the cathedral was founded in 1011, under the reign of Yaroslav's father, Grand Prince of Kievan Rus', [[Vladimir the Great]]. This has been accepted by both UNESCO and Ukraine, which officially celebrated the 1000th anniversary of the cathedral during 2011.<ref>Booklet \"The Millenary of St. Sophia of Kyiv\" by Nadia Nikitenko, Kiev 2011</ref>) The structure has 5 [[nave]]s, 5 [[apse]]s, and (quite surprisingly for [[Byzantine architecture]]) 13 [[cupola]]s. It is surrounded by two-tier galleries from three sides. Measuring {{convert|37|to|55|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, the exterior used to be faced with [[plinth]]s. On the inside, it retains [[mosaics]] and [[fresco]]s from the 11th century, including a dilapidated representation of Yaroslav's family, and the [[Orans]].\n\nOriginally the cathedral was a burial place of the Kievan rulers including [[Vladimir Monomakh]], [[Vsevolod Yaroslavich]] and the cathedral's founder [[Yaroslav I the Wise]], although only the latter's grave survived to this day (see [[:Image:Yaroslavtomb.jpg|picture]]).\n\nAfter the pillaging of Kiev by [[Andrei Bogolyubsky]] of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] in 1169, followed by [[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongolian Tatars]] in 1240, the cathedral fell into disrepair. It was also greatly damaged in the 16th century when Poland and Ukraine were trying to unite Catholic and Orthodox churches. At this period the Cathedral was almost ruined: its roof decayed and a lot of wall paintings had gone.\nFollowing the 1595-96 [[Union of Brest]], the Cathedral of Holy Sophia belonged to the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] until it was claimed by the Moldavian [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] [[Peter Mogila]] (Mohyla) in 1633. Mogila commissioned the repair work and the upper part of the building was thoroughly rebuilt, modeled by the Italian architect [[Octaviano Mancini]] in the distinct [[Ukrainian Baroque]] style, while preserving the Byzantine interior, keeping its splendor intact. The work continued under the [[Cossack]] [[Hetman]] [[Ivan Mazepa]] until 1767. During this period around Holy Sophia Cathedral a bell tower, a monastery canteen, a bakery, a \"House of Metropolitan\", the western gates (Zborovsky gates), a Monastic Inn, a Brotherhood campus and a bursa (seminary) were all erected. All of these buildings, as well as the Cathedral after the reconstruction, have distinctive features of Ukrainian Baroque.\n\nAfter the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and during the Soviet anti-religious campaign of the 1920s, the government plan called for the cathedral's destruction and transformation of the grounds into a park \"Heroes of [[Perekop]]\" (after a [[Red Army]] victory in the [[Russian Civil War]] in [[Crimea]]). The cathedral was saved from destruction<ref name=\"Forgotten Soviet Plans For Kyiv\">[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/109648/ Forgotten Soviet Plans For Kyiv], [[Kyiv Post]] (28 July 2011)</ref> (the opposite [[St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery]] was destroyed in 1935<ref name=\"Forgotten Soviet Plans For Kyiv\"/>) primarily with the effort of many scientists and historians. Nevertheless, in 1934, [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities confiscated the structure from the church, including the surrounding 17th\u201318th-century architectural complex and designated it as an architectural and historical museum.\n\nSince the late 1980s Soviet, and later Ukrainian, politicians promised to return the building to the Orthodox Church. Due to various [[History of Christianity in Ukraine|schisms, and factions]] within the Church the return was postponed as all Orthodox and the Greek-Catholic Churches lay claim to it. Although all of the Orthodox churches have been allowed to conduct services at different dates, at other times they are denied access. A severe incident was the funeral of [[Patriarch Volodymyr]] of the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church \u2013 Kiev Patriarchate]] in 1995 when riot police were forced to prevent the burial on the premises of the museum and a bloody clash took place.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} After events such as those no religious body has yet been given the rights for regular services. The complex now remains a secular museum of Ukraine's Christianity, with most of its visitors being tourists.\n\nOn 21 August 2007, the Holy Sophia Cathedral was named one of the [[Seven Wonders of Ukraine]], based on votes by experts and the internet community.\n\n{{Gallery\n|title=\n|width=200 | height=210 | lines=5\n|align=center\n|File:Oranta-Kyiv.jpg|The Virgin [[Orans]], c. 1000\n|file: Church Fathers Order (left part) - Google Art Project.jpg|Church Fathers Order, c. 1000\n|file: The Deesis - Google Art Project.jpg|The Deesis, 1000\n|file: Princely group portrait.

According to Dr. Nadia Nikitenko, a historian who has studied the cathedral for 30 years, the cathedral was founded in 1011, under the reign of Yaroslav's father, Grand Prince of Kievan Rus', [[Vladimir the Great]]. This has been accepted by both UNESCO and Ukraine, which officially celebrated the 1000th anniversary of the cathedral during 2011.<ref>Booklet \"The Millenary of St. Sophia of Kyiv\" by Nadia Nikitenko, Kiev 2011</ref>) The structure has 5 [[nave]]s, 5 [[apse]]s, and (quite surprisingly for [[Byzantine architecture]]) 13 [[cupola]]s. It is surrounded by two-tier galleries from three sides. Measuring {{convert|37|to|55|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, the exterior used to be faced with [[plinth]]s. On the inside, it retains [[mosaics]] and [[fresco]]s from the 11th century, including a dilapidated representation of Yaroslav's family, and the [[Orans]].\n\nOriginally the cathedral was a burial place of the Kievan rulers including [[Vladimir Monomakh]], [[Vsevolod Yaroslavich]] and the cathedral's founder [[Yaroslav I the Wise]], although only the latter's grave survived to this day (see [[:Image:Yaroslavtomb.jpg|picture]]).\n\nAfter the pillaging of Kiev by [[Andrei Bogolyubsky]] of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] in 1169, followed by [[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongolian Tatars]] in 1240, the cathedral fell into disrepair. It was also greatly damaged in the 16th century when Poland and Ukraine were trying to unite Catholic and Orthodox churches. At this period the Cathedral was almost ruined: its roof decayed and a lot of wall paintings had gone.\nFollowing the 1595-96 [[Union of Brest]], the Cathedral of Holy Sophia belonged to the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] until it was claimed by the Moldavian [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] [[Peter Mogila]] (Mohyla) in 1633. Mogila commissioned the repair work and the upper part of the building was thoroughly rebuilt, modeled by the Italian architect [[Octaviano Mancini]] in the distinct [[Ukrainian Baroque]] style, while preserving the Byzantine interior, keeping its splendor intact. The work continued under the [[Cossack]] [[Hetman]] [[Ivan Mazepa]] until 1767. During this period around Holy Sophia Cathedral a bell tower, a monastery canteen, a bakery, a \"House of Metropolitan\", the western gates (Zborovsky gates), a Monastic Inn, a Brotherhood campus and a bursa (seminary) were all erected. All of these buildings, as well as the Cathedral after the reconstruction, have distinctive features of Ukrainian Baroque.\n\nAfter the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and during the Soviet anti-religious campaign of the 1920s, the government plan called for the cathedral's destruction and transformation of the grounds into a park \"Heroes of [[Perekop]]\" (after a [[Red Army]] victory in the [[Russian Civil War]] in [[Crimea]]). The cathedral was saved from destruction<ref name=\"Forgotten Soviet Plans For Kyiv\">[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/109648/ Forgotten Soviet Plans For Kyiv], [[Kyiv Post]] (28 July 2011)</ref> (the opposite [[St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery]] was destroyed in 1935<ref name=\"Forgotten Soviet Plans For Kyiv\"/>) primarily with the effort of many scientists and historians. Nevertheless, in 1934, [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities confiscated the structure from the church, including the surrounding 17th\u201318th-century architectural complex and designated it as an architectural and historical museum.\n\nSince the late 1980s Soviet, and later Ukrainian, politicians promised to return the building to the Orthodox Church. Due to various [[History of Christianity in Ukraine|schisms, and factions]] within the Church the return was postponed as all Orthodox and the Greek-Catholic Churches lay claim to it. Although all of the Orthodox churches have been allowed to conduct services at different dates, at other times they are denied access. A severe incident was the funeral of [[Patriarch Volodymyr]] of the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church \u2013 Kiev Patriarchate]] in 1995 when riot police were forced to prevent the burial on the premises of the museum and a bloody clash took place.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} After events such as those no religious body has yet been given the rights for regular services. The complex now remains a secular museum of Ukraine's Christianity, with most of its visitors being tourists.\n\nOn 21 August 2007, the Holy Sophia Cathedral was named one of the [[Seven Wonders of Ukraine]], based on votes by experts and the internet community.\n\n{{Gallery\n|title=\n|width=200 | height=210 | lines=5\n|align=center\n|File:Oranta-Kyiv.jpg|The Virgin [[Orans]], c. 1000\n|file: Church Fathers Order (left part) - Google Art Project.jpg|Church Fathers Order, c. 1000\n|file: The Deesis - Google Art Project.jpg|The Deesis, 1000\n|file: Princely group portrait.

The name refers to the serrations found along the margins of the opercular bones in many members of this family.<ref name=\"FishBase\"/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nPomacentrids are found primarily in tropical seas, with a few species occurring in temperate waters (e.g., [[Garibaldi (fish)|''Hypsypops rubicundus'']]). Most species are found on or near [[coral reef]]s in the Indo-West Pacific (from East Africa to Polynesia).

In general, the coral is used as shelter, and many species can only survive in its presence.<ref name=EoF/>\n\nThe bottom-dwelling species are territorial, occupying and defending a portion of the reef, often centered on shelter. By keeping away other species of fish, some pomacentrids encourage the growth of thick mats of [[algae]] within their territories, leading to the common name [[dusky farmerfish|farmerfish]].<ref name=EoF/>\n\n==Characteristics==\nPomacentrids have an orbiculate to elongated body shape, which is often laterally compressed.  They have interrupted or incomplete lateral lines and they usually have a single nostril on each side (some species of ''[[Chromis]]'' and ''[[Dascyllus]]'' have two on each side).<ref name=FotW/>  They have small- to medium-sized [[ctenoid]] scales. They have one or two rows of teeth, which may be conical or spatulate.\n\nThey display a wide range of colors, predominantly bright shades of yellow, red, orange, and blue, although some are a relatively drab brown, black, or grey. The young are often a different, brighter color than adults.\n\nPomacentrids are [[omnivorous]] or [[herbivorous]], feeding on algae, [[plankton]], and small bottom-dwelling [[crustacean]]s, depending on their precise habitats. Only a small number of genera, such as ''[[Cheiloprion]]'', eat the [[coral]] where they live.<ref name=EoF/>\n\nThey also engage in symbiotic relationship with cleaner gobies of genus ''[[Elacatinus]]'', allowing the gobies to feed on [[ectoparasites]] on their bodies.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Ivan Sazima |author2=Cristina Sazima |author3=Ronaldo B.

They engage in ritualised [[courtship display]]s, which may consist of rapid bursts of motion, chasing or nipping females, stationary hovering, or wide extension of their fins. After being attracted to the site, the female lays a string of sticky eggs that attach to the substrate. The male swims behind the female as she lays the eggs, and fertilises them [[external fertilisation|externally]]. Varying by species, brood sizes range from 50 to 1000 eggs.<ref name=EoF/>\n\nThe male guards the nest for the two to seven days needed for the eggs to hatch. The transparent [[larvae]] are {{convert|2|to|4|mm|abbr=on}} long.

One day, young Purnima gives her trophy for student of the year to her step-sister, Shanaya, but is later caught as someone comes from her school revealing the truth. Purnima's father always stands for Purnima and asks Shanaya to apologise but she refuses. Later, her step-mother, who prefers her daughter, abandons young Purnima at the Golden Temple. In search of her mother, young Purnima meets young Kartik who gives her a bracelet saying the bracelet will give her protection. Kartik's mother gets angry as her son is talking to a girl of dark complexion and middle-class. Purnima, nonetheless, reaches home and takes the blame of being a butterfly. Her father talks to her about how the way you act matters more than the colour of someone's skin complexion. \n\n16 years later, Purnima and Kartik are now adults. Kartik is a doctor who loves volunteering at the temple's footwear storage. While taking Purnima's footwear, he notices the bracelet. Kartik's mother, Soni, hates dark complexion as she is the owner of a fairness beauty brand and wishes for a fairy-like girl, fair complexion is a must. Purnima prays for her sister who is taking part in Miss Amritsar beauty. Purnima calls Shanaya and gives her a definition of beauty that was given to her by her father. Kartik overhears Purnima while he is consulting a patient and gets impressed by her thoughtfulness. Like the Arora sisters, the Mehra brothers have different definitions of beauty. When questioned by Soni, a judge at the show, Shanaya gives the exacts same words Purnima told her. Kartik realises the similarity and concludes that Purnima might be nearby. Soni chooses Shanaya as her future daughter-in-law. Some time later, Kartik spots Purnima who was with her other family members. Soni sees her son and asks him what he was looking at. He points where and Soni sees Shanaya.\n\nNext morning, Soni and Sumreet (Kartik's brother) express their choices that match, both being Shanaya. Soni also plans on making Shanaya face for the company's new product. A boy comes for a marriage proposal for Purnima but they reject her for her complexion. Shanaya needs money for another contest, Miss Punjab. Shanaya steals Purnima's money which the latter collected since childhood. Shanaya gets caught as one of her nails gets found near Purnima's belongings but she has already used the stolen things for her next contest. \n\nPurnima finds a small girl hurt on the road and the people surrounding the little kid are of no help, some shooting videos. Purnima sacrifices her school fees for the girl and donates some of her blood to her. Purnima bumps into Soni and Soni is disgusted. Soni sends a marriage proposal for Shanaya. Shanaya tells her mother that she does not like the idea of marriage. Shanaya misunderstands the groom as only the two brothers are sent there.
