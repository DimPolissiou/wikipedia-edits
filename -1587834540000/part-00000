As such, its presiding officer was called a \"provost\", and reported to the main campus in Berkeley. In 1951, UCLA was formally elevated to co-equal status with UC Berkeley, and its presiding officer [[Raymond B. Allen]] was the first chief executive to be granted the title of chancellor. The appointment of [[Franklin David Murphy]] to the position of Chancellor in 1960 helped spark an era of tremendous growth of facilities and faculty honors. By the end of the decade, UCLA had achieved distinction in a wide range of subjects. This era also secured UCLA's position as a proper university and not simply a branch of the UC system. This change is exemplified by an incident involving Chancellor Murphy, which was described by him:\n\n<blockquote>\nI picked up the telephone and called in from somewhere, and the phone operator said, \"University of California.\" And I said, \"Is this Berkeley?\" She said, \"No.\" I said, \"Well, who have I gotten to?\" \"UCLA.\" I said, \"Why didn't you say UCLA?\" \"Oh\", she said, \"we're instructed to say University of California.\" So the next morning I went to the office and wrote a memo; I said, \"Will you please instruct the operators, as of noon today, when they answer the phone to say, 'UCLA.{{'\"}} And they said, \"You know they won't like it at Berkeley.\" And I said, \"Well, let's just see.

As such, its presiding officer was called a \"provost\", and reported to the main campus in Berkeley. In 1951, UCLA was formally elevated to co-equal status with UC Berkeley, and its presiding officer [[Raymond B. Allen]] was the first chief executive to be granted the title of chancellor. The appointment of [[Franklin David Murphy]] to the position of Chancellor in 1960 helped spark an era of tremendous growth of facilities and faculty honors. By the end of the decade, UCLA had achieved distinction in a wide range of subjects. This era also secured UCLA's position as a proper university and not simply a branch of the UC system. This change is exemplified by an incident involving Chancellor Murphy, which was described by him:\n\n<blockquote>\nI picked up the telephone and called in from somewhere, and the phone operator said, \"University of California.\" And I said, \"Is this Berkeley?\" She said, \"No.\" I said, \"Well, who have I gotten to?\" \"UCLA.\" I said, \"Why didn't you say UCLA?\" \"Oh\", she said, \"we're instructed to say University of California.\" So the next morning I went to the office and wrote a memo; I said, \"Will you please instruct the operators, as of noon today, when they answer the phone to say, 'UCLA.{{'\"}} And they said, \"You know they won't like it at Berkeley.\" And I said, \"Well, let's just see.

In addition to the student members, there are representatives appointed by the administration, the academic senate, and the alumni association. The \"services and enterprises\" portion of ASUCLA is run by a professional executive director who oversees some 300 staff and 2,000 student employees.\n\nThe Graduate Students Association is the governing body for approximately 13,000 graduate and professional students at UCLA.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gsa.asucla.ucla.edu/ |title=UCLA Graduate Student Association |publisher=Gsa.asucla.ucla.edu |date=February 2, 2010 |accessdate=May 23, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610183026/http://gsa.asucla.ucla.edu/ |archive-date=June 10, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe Undergraduate Students Association Council (USAC) is the governing body of the Undergraduate Students Association (USA) whose membership comprises every UCLA undergraduate student.<ref name=usac>{{cite web |url=https://www.usac.ucla.edu/about/usac.php |title=UCLA Undergraduate Students Association |publisher=UCLA |accessdate=September 11, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720073752/http://www.usac.ucla.edu/about/usac.php |archivedate=July 20, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>  {{as of|2015}}, the student body had two major political slates: Bruins United and Let's Act.

All members of USAC may participate fully in Council deliberations, but only the elected officers, minus the USAC President may vote.\n\nAlong with the council, the student government also includes a seven-member Judicial Board, which similar to the Supreme Court, serves as the judicial branch of government and reviews actions of the council. These seven students are appointed by the student body president and confirmed by the council.\n\nUSAC's programs offers additional services to the campus and surrounding communities. For example, each year approximately 40,000 students, faculty and staff attend programs of the [[UCLA Campus Events Commission|Campus Events Commission]], including a low-cost film program, a speakers program which presents leading figures from a wide range of disciplines, and performances by dozens of entertainers.

It was his first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Following the [[hard rock]] sound of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' marked a move towards [[art rock]] and [[art pop]] styles. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]] and Bowie himself, it was recorded in mid-1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London and featured [[Rick Wakeman]] on piano and the musicians who would later be known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. The album cover, photographed by Brian Ward and airbrushed by Terry Pastor, was influenced by a [[Marlene Dietrich]] photo book that Bowie took with him to the photoshoot.<ref>{{cite book |title=1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die |last=Dimery |first=Robert |year=2005 |publisher=Quintet Publishing |location=London |isbn=978-1-84403-392-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/1001albumsyoumus0000unse_l0q0/page/254 254] |url=https://archive.org/details/1001albumsyoumus0000unse_l0q0/page/254 }}</ref>\n\nThe album was initially released to favourable critical and commercial reception but wasn't a major success until the commercial breakthrough of his following album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972). It was supported by the singles \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\" in 1972 and \"[[Life on Mars (song)|Life on Mars?]]\" in 1973. Retrospectively, ''Hunky Dory'' has received critical acclaim and is regarded as one of Bowie's best works. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' chose it as part of their \"100 best albums of all time\" list in January 2010, with journalist [[Josh Tyrangiel]] praising Bowie's \"earthbound ambition to be a [[Bohemianism|boho]] poet with prodigal style\".<ref name=time /> The album has been reissued multiple times and remastered in 2015 as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set.\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the completion of his third studio album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' in May 1970, Bowie became less active in both the studio and on stage. This was partly due to challenges that were confronting his new manager [[Tony Defries]], who Bowie hired after firing his old manager [[Kenneth Pitt]] and departing music publisher Essex Music.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} After hearing Bowie's new single \"[[Holy Holy]]\", Defries signed a contract with Chrysalis but thereafter limited his work with Bowie to focus on other projects, including attempting to sign American singer-songwriter [[Stevie Wonder]] following his contract ending with [[Motown Records]]. Because of this, Bowie, who was devoting himself to songwriting, turned to Chrysalis partner Bob Grace. Grace, according to biographer Nicholas Pegg, had \"courted\" Bowie on \"the strength of 'Holy Holy'\", and subsequently booked time at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London for Bowie to record his demos.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} According to his then-wife [[Angie Bowie|Angela]], Bowie had spent time composing songs on piano rather than guitar, which would \"infuse the flavour of the new album.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}}\n\nIn August 1970, due to his disillusionment with Bowie's lack of enthusiasm during the sessions for ''The Man Who Sold the World'' and his dislike of Defries, bassist and producer [[Tony Visconti]] parted ways with Bowie; it was the last time he would see the artist for three to four years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}} [[Mick Ronson]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]], who played guitar and drums, respectively for ''The Man Who Sold the World'', similarly parted ways with Bowie, primarily due to their disgruntlement with the artist on top of not being paid for their performances.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}} Visconti would then produce music for glam rock artist [[Marc Bolan]] while Ronson and Woodmansey went to [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]] and formed a short-lived group called Ronno with Benny Marshall of [[The Rats (British band)|the Rats]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=214}} \n\nThe first song Bowie wrote and demoed for ''Hunky Dory'' was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\" in January 1971. After recording a demo at Radio Luxembourg, Bowie gave the tape to Grace, who showed it to [[Peter Noone]] of [[Herman's Hermits]]. Noone decided to record \"Oh! You Pretty Things\" and released it as his debut single later that year.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=202\u2013203}} Noone's version reached number 12 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in mid-June, with Noone telling ''[[NME]]'': \"My view is that David Bowie is the best writer in Britain at the moment...certainly the best since [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]].\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=220}} It was at this studio where Bowie wrote future ''Ziggy Stardust'' tracks \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"[[Hang On to Yourself]]\", which he recorded with his short-lived band [[Arnold Corns]] in February 1971.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=206\u2013207}}\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nAfter the minimal critical and commercial impact of his Arnold Corns project and leaving Mercury Records, Bowie regrouped in the studio in May 1971 to begin work on his next album.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=216, 218}} Initially, he was joined by Arnold Corns guitarist Mark Pritchett, ''Space Oddity'' drummer [[Terry Cox]] and his former Turquoise colleague Tony Hill. However, he came to the conclusion that he couldn't do the project without Ronson.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} Ronson, who had not talked to Bowie in nine months and had become depressed, was enthusiastic when Bowie contacted him. Woodmansey returned with Ronson, who recruited a new bass player to replace Visconti. He initially suggested [[Rick Kemp]], who Bowie recorded with in the King Bees in the mid-1960s. However, upon meeting Bowie at Haddon Hall to audition, Bowie was dismissive of him and, according to Pegg, some reports say that Defries rejected Kemp on the grounds of his \"receding hairline;\" Kemp would instead join the English folk rock band [[Steeleye Span]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} So, Ronson suggested his acquaintance [[Trevor Bolder]], a former hairdresser and piano tuner who had previously seen Bowie live in 1970 and met Ronson at Haddon Hall.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} Upon Bolder's hiring, the trio grouped at Haddon to rehearse some of Bowie's new material, of which included album track \"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}\n\n[[File:Ken Scott - 2014-11-14 - Andy Mabbett.JPG|thumb|upright=0.65|alt=Ken Scott in 2014|''Hunky Dory'' was the first production collaboration between Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] ''(pictured in 2014)''.]]\nFollowing the birth of his son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan]], Bowie wrote the song \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" as a tribute to him. Also known as 'Zowie', Bowie would tell David Wigg in 1973: \"I got the name [Zowie] from a [[Batman]] comic.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} On 3 June, Bowie and the Spiders, along with traveled to the BBC's Paris Studios in London to record for [[John Peel]]'s radio show ''In Concert''.

However, the composer also took time to pay tribute to his influences with the tracks \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\", \"[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]\" and the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] inspired \"[[Queen Bitch]]\".\n\nFollowing the [[hard rock]] of Bowie's previous album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of ''[[Space Oddity (album)|Space Oddity]]'', with light fare such as \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" and the cover \"Fill Your Heart\" sitting alongside heavier material like the [[occult]]-tinged \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" (whose lyric mentions the Golden Dawn (i.e. the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]) and [[Aleister Crowley]]) and the semi-autobiographical \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\". Between the two extremes was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\", whose pop tune hid lyrics, inspired by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], predicting the imminent replacement of modern man by \"the [[\u00dcbermensch|Homo Superior]]\", and which has been cited as a direct precursor to \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" from Bowie's next album, ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=44}}\n\n== Title and artwork ==\nAlthough Bowie generally left naming his albums until last minute, the title, 'Hunky Dory', was announced at the John Peel session.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} It was suggested by Bob Grace of Chrysalis, who got the idea from an [[Esher]] pub landlord and formerly of the [[Royal Air Force]]. He told Peter and Leni Gillman, the authors of ''Alias David Bowie'', that the landlord had an unusual vocabulary that was \"peppered with upper-crust jargon\", using words such as 'prang' and 'whizzo', and phrases such as 'everything's hunky-dory'. Grace told Bowie and he loved it.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=606\u2013607}} Pegg notes that there was a song from 1957 by the American doo-wop band the Guytones also titled \"Hunky Dory\" that may have played a part as well.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=607}} The album's sleeve would bear the credit \"Produced by Ken Scott (assisted by the actor)\". The \"actor\" was Bowie himself, whose \"pet conceit\", in the words of ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]], was \"to think of himself as an actor\".{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=7\u201311}}\n\nThe cover artwork was taken by photographer Brian Ward at his [[Heddon Street]] studio,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=610\u2013611}} who was introduced to Bowie by Grace. One idea was for Bowie to dress as an Egyptian Pharoah, partly inspired by the British media's infatuation with the [[British Museum]]'s new [[Tutankhamun]] exhibit.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Photos of Bowie posing as a sphinx and in a lotus position were taken \u2013 one of them was released as part of the 1990 ''Space Oddity'' reissue \u2013 but the idea was ultimately not chosen. Bowie later recalled: \"We didn't run with it, as they say. Probably a good idea.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Rather than something extravagant, Bowie opted for a more minimalist image reflecting the album's \"preoccupation with the silver screen.\" Bowie later said: \"I was into Oxford bags, and there are a pair, indeed, on the back of the album. [I was attempting] what I presumed was kind of an [[Evelyn Waugh]] Oxbridge look.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} The final image is a close-up of Bowie looking up into space as he pushes his hair back from his forehead. Originally shot in monochrome, the image was re-coloured by illustrator Terry Pastor, who recently set up the Main Artery design studio in [[Covent Garden]] with George Underwood; Pastor would later design the cover and sleeve for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Pegg writes: \"Bowie's decision to use a re-coloured photo suggests a hand-tinted lobby-card from the days of the silent cinema and, simultaneously, Warhol's famous ''[[Marilyn Diptych]]'' screen-prints.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}}\n\n== Release and aftermath ==\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"Erlewine AllMusic\">{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=''Hunky Dory'' \u2013 David Bowie|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/hunky-dory-mw0000189509|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=13 March 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615072909/http://www.allmusic.com/album/hunky-dory-mw0000189509|archive-date=15 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|rev2 = ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''\n|rev2score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite journal|title=David Bowie: Hunky Dory|url=http://www.blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?ID=3887|work=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]|issue=47|date=May 2006|accessdate=14 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823012137/http://www.blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?ID=3887|archivedate=23 August 2007}}</ref>\n|rev3 = ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''\n|rev3score = {{Rating|3.5|4}}<ref>{{cite news|last=Kot|first=Greg|authorlink=Greg Kot|title=Bowie's Many Faces Are Profiled on Compact Disc|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-06-10/entertainment/9002170173_1_space-oddity-scary-monsters-ziggy-stardust|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=10 June 1990|accessdate=14 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416150839/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-06-10/entertainment/9002170173_1_space-oddity-scary-monsters-ziggy-stardust|archive-date=16 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|rev4 = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n|rev4Score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|edition=5th concise|year=2011|last=Larkin|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer)|isbn=0-85712-595-8|chapter=David Bowie}}</ref>\n|rev5 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n|rev5score = 10/10<ref name=\"Wolk Pitchfork\">{{cite web|last=Wolk|first=Douglas|authorlink=Douglas Wolk|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21066-five-years-1969-1973/|title=David Bowie: ''Five Years 1969\u20131973''|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=1 October 2015|accessdate=21 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206231305/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21066-five-years-1969-1973/|archive-date=6 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|rev6 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n|rev6score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|authorlink=Rob Sheffield|title=David Bowie: ''Hunky Dory'' (reissue)|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/cd/review.asp?aid=50071&cf=331|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=18 March 1999|accessdate=14 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031003202846/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/cd/review.asp?aid=50071&cf=331|archivedate=3 October 2003}}</ref>\n|rev7 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n|rev7Score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|authorlink=Rob Sheffield|chapter=David Bowie|title=[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]]|editor1-last=Brackett|editor1-first=Nathan|editor2-last=Hoard|editor2-first=Christian|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|edition=4th|year=2004|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/97 97\u201399]|isbn=0-7432-0169-8}}</ref>\n|rev8 = ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''\n|rev8score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dolan|first=Jon|title=How to Buy: David Bowie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s5jfV6kXmTEC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA84|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|volume=22|issue=7|date=July 2006|accessdate=14 July 2016|page=84|journal=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002175230/https://books.google.com/books?id=s5jfV6kXmTEC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA84|archive-date=2 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|rev9 = ''[[Spin Alternative Record Guide]]''\n|rev9score = 9/10{{sfn|Weisbard|Marks|1995|page=55}}\n|rev10 = ''[[The Village Voice]]''\n|rev10Score = A\u2212<ref name=\"Christgau\">{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cg22.php|title=Consumer Guide (22)|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|location=New York|date=30 December 1971|accessdate=28 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815194640/http://robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cg22.php|archive-date=15 August 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\nFollowing the success of Peter Noone's version of \"Oh!

It was his first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Following the [[hard rock]] sound of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' marked a move towards [[art rock]] and [[art pop]] styles. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]] and Bowie himself, it was recorded in mid-1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London and featured [[Rick Wakeman]] on piano and the musicians who would later be known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. The album cover, photographed by Brian Ward and airbrushed by Terry Pastor, was influenced by a [[Marlene Dietrich]] photo book that Bowie took with him to the photoshoot.<ref>{{cite book |title=1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die |last=Dimery |first=Robert |year=2005 |publisher=Quintet Publishing |location=London |isbn=978-1-84403-392-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/1001albumsyoumus0000unse_l0q0/page/254 254] |url=https://archive.org/details/1001albumsyoumus0000unse_l0q0/page/254 }}</ref>\n\nThe album was initially released to favourable critical and commercial reception but wasn't a major success until the commercial breakthrough of his following album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972). It was supported by the singles \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\" in 1972 and \"[[Life on Mars (song)|Life on Mars?]]\" in 1973. Retrospectively, ''Hunky Dory'' has received critical acclaim and is regarded as one of Bowie's best works. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' chose it as part of their \"100 best albums of all time\" list in January 2010, with journalist [[Josh Tyrangiel]] praising Bowie's \"earthbound ambition to be a [[Bohemianism|boho]] poet with prodigal style\".<ref name=time /> The album has been reissued multiple times and remastered in 2015 as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set.\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the completion of his third studio album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' in May 1970, Bowie became less active in both the studio and on stage. This was partly due to challenges that were confronting his new manager [[Tony Defries]], who Bowie hired after firing his old manager [[Kenneth Pitt]] and departing music publisher Essex Music.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} After hearing Bowie's new single \"[[Holy Holy]]\", Defries signed a contract with Chrysalis but thereafter limited his work with Bowie to focus on other projects, including attempting to sign American singer-songwriter [[Stevie Wonder]] following his contract ending with [[Motown Records]]. Because of this, Bowie, who was devoting himself to songwriting, turned to Chrysalis partner Bob Grace. Grace, according to biographer Nicholas Pegg, had \"courted\" Bowie on \"the strength of 'Holy Holy'\", and subsequently booked time at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London for Bowie to record his demos.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} According to his then-wife [[Angie Bowie|Angela]], Bowie had spent time composing songs on piano rather than guitar, which would \"infuse the flavour of the new album.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}}\n\nIn August 1970, due to his disillusionment with Bowie's lack of enthusiasm during the sessions for ''The Man Who Sold the World'' and his dislike of Defries, bassist and producer [[Tony Visconti]] parted ways with Bowie; it was the last time he would see the artist for three to four years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}} [[Mick Ronson]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]], who played guitar and drums, respectively for ''The Man Who Sold the World'', similarly parted ways with Bowie, primarily due to their disgruntlement with the artist on top of not being paid for their performances.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}} Visconti would then produce music for glam rock artist [[Marc Bolan]] while Ronson and Woodmansey went to [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]] and formed a short-lived group called Ronno with Benny Marshall of [[The Rats (British band)|the Rats]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=214}} \n\nThe first song Bowie wrote and demoed for ''Hunky Dory'' was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\" in January 1971. After recording a demo at Radio Luxembourg, Bowie gave the tape to Grace, who showed it to [[Peter Noone]] of [[Herman's Hermits]]. Noone decided to record \"Oh! You Pretty Things\" and released it as his debut single later that year.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=202\u2013203}} Noone's version reached number 12 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in mid-June, with Noone telling ''[[NME]]'': \"My view is that David Bowie is the best writer in Britain at the moment...certainly the best since [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]].\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=220}} It was at this studio where Bowie wrote future ''Ziggy Stardust'' tracks \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"[[Hang On to Yourself]]\", which he recorded with his short-lived band [[Arnold Corns]] in February 1971.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=206\u2013207}}\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nAfter the minimal critical and commercial impact of his Arnold Corns project and leaving Mercury Records, Bowie regrouped in the studio in May 1971 to begin work on his next album.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=216, 218}} Initially, he was joined by Arnold Corns guitarist Mark Pritchett, ''Space Oddity'' drummer [[Terry Cox]] and his former Turquoise colleague Tony Hill. However, he came to the conclusion that he couldn't do the project without Ronson.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} Ronson, who had not talked to Bowie in nine months and had become depressed, was enthusiastic when Bowie contacted him. Woodmansey returned with Ronson, who recruited a new bass player to replace Visconti. He initially suggested [[Rick Kemp]], who Bowie recorded with in the King Bees in the mid-1960s. However, upon meeting Bowie at Haddon Hall to audition, Bowie was dismissive of him and, according to Pegg, some reports say that Defries rejected Kemp on the grounds of his \"receding hairline;\" Kemp would instead join the English folk rock band [[Steeleye Span]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} So, Ronson suggested his acquaintance [[Trevor Bolder]], a former hairdresser and piano tuner who had previously seen Bowie live in 1970 and met Ronson at Haddon Hall.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} Upon Bolder's hiring, the trio grouped at Haddon to rehearse some of Bowie's new material, of which included album track \"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}\n\n[[File:Ken Scott - 2014-11-14 - Andy Mabbett.JPG|thumb|upright=0.65|alt=Ken Scott in 2014|''Hunky Dory'' was the first production collaboration between Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] ''(pictured in 2014)''.]]\nFollowing the birth of his son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan]], Bowie wrote the song \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" as a tribute to him. Also known as 'Zowie', Bowie would tell David Wigg in 1973: \"I got the name [Zowie] from a [[Batman]] comic.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} On 3 June, Bowie and the Spiders, along with traveled to the BBC's Paris Studios in London to record for [[John Peel]]'s radio show ''In Concert''. They were joined by [[Dana Gillespie]], Mark Pritchett, Geoffrey MacCormack (better known as [[Warren Peace]]) and George Underwood.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} The songs they performed were all originals written by Bowie, apart from a cover of [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Almost Grown (song)|Almost Grown]]\" and [[Ron Davies (songwriter)|Ron Davies]]' \"It Ain't Easy\",{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}} which was to be recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust'' a year later.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} The performance began with \"[[Queen Bitch]]\" and \"[[Bombers (David Bowie song)|Bombers]]\", which Peel says will both be on the upcoming album, although \"Bombers\" was to replaced by the cover \"Fill Your Heart\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=160}} They also played \"[[The Supermen]]\" from ''The Man Who Sold the World'', \"Looking for a Friend\" (which was sung by Pritchett), \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\" (which was sung by Underwood) and \"Andy Warhol\" (which was sung by Gillespie).{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} Although Bowie's backing trio were referred to as \"members of a group called Ronno\", the session would become the first performance with the trio who would become known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] and who would record with him for the next three years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}}<ref name=\"Gallucci UCR\" /> \n\n{{quote box|quote=[''Hunky Dory''] is very much a duo record.

He recalled in 1995 that he met Bowie in late June 1971 at Haddon Hall, where Bowie played him demos of \"Changes\" and \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" in \"their raw brilliance\". He recalled: \"He [played] the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life...I couldn't wait to get into the studio and record them.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}}\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n[[File:Rickwakemanmoog.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Rick Wakeman performing in 2012|The album features prominent piano by [[Yes (band)|Yes]] keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]] ''(pictured in 2012)''.]]\nAuthor [[Peter Doggett]] describes ''Hunky Dory'' as \"a collective of attractively accessible pop songs, through which Bowie tested out his feelings about the nature of stardom and power.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=11}} Musical biographer David Buckley said of the album: \"Its almost easy-listening status and conventional musical sensibility has detracted from the fact that, lyrically, this record lays down the blueprint for Bowie's future career.\"<ref name=buckstrange1>{{cite book |title=Strange Fascination \u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story |last=Buckley |first=David |year=2000 |origyear=1999 |publisher=Virgin Books |location=London |isbn=0-7535-0457-X |page=112}}</ref> The opening track, \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\", focused on the compulsive nature of artistic reinvention (\"Strange fascination, fascinating me/Changes are taking the pace I'm going through\") and distancing oneself from the rock mainstream (\"Look out, you rock 'n' rollers\"). However, the composer also took time to pay tribute to his influences with the tracks \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\", \"[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]\" and the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] inspired \"[[Queen Bitch]]\".\n\nFollowing the [[hard rock]] of Bowie's previous album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of ''[[Space Oddity (album)|Space Oddity]]'', with light fare such as \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" and the cover \"Fill Your Heart\" sitting alongside heavier material like the [[occult]]-tinged \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" (whose lyric mentions the Golden Dawn (i.e. the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]) and [[Aleister Crowley]]) and the semi-autobiographical \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\". Between the two extremes was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\", whose pop tune hid lyrics, inspired by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], predicting the imminent replacement of modern man by \"the [[\u00dcbermensch|Homo Superior]]\", and which has been cited as a direct precursor to \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" from Bowie's next album, ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=44}}\n\n== Title and artwork ==\nAlthough Bowie generally left naming his albums until last minute, the title, 'Hunky Dory', was announced at the John Peel session.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} It was suggested by Bob Grace of Chrysalis, who got the idea from an [[Esher]] pub landlord and formerly of the [[Royal Air Force]]. He told Peter and Leni Gillman, the authors of ''Alias David Bowie'', that the landlord had an unusual vocabulary that was \"peppered with upper-crust jargon\", using words such as 'prang' and 'whizzo', and phrases such as 'everything's hunky-dory'. Grace told Bowie and he loved it.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=606\u2013607}} Pegg notes that there was a song from 1957 by the American doo-wop band the Guytones also titled \"Hunky Dory\" that may have played a part as well.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=607}}\n\nThe cover artwork was taken by photographer Brian Ward at his [[Heddon Street]] studio,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=610\u2013611}} who was introduced to Bowie by Grace. One idea was for Bowie to dress as an Egyptian Pharoah, partly inspired by the British media's infatuation with the [[British Museum]]'s new [[Tutankhamun]] exhibit.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Photos of Bowie posing as a sphinx and in a lotus position were taken \u2013 one of them was released as part of the 1990 ''Space Oddity'' reissue \u2013 but the idea was ultimately not chosen. Bowie later recalled: \"We didn't run with it, as they say. Probably a good idea.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Rather than something extravagant, Bowie opted for a more minimalist image reflecting the album's \"preoccupation with the silver screen.\" Bowie later said: \"I was into Oxford bags, and there are a pair, indeed, on the back of the album.

Sports]] (Yahoo!).\n\nCurrently, the NCAA compiles consensus all-America teams in the sports of [[NCAA Division I#Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I-FBS]] football and Division I men's basketball using a point system computed from All-America teams named by coaches associations or media sources.  The system consists of three points for a first-team honor, two points for second-team honor, and one point for third-team honor.  Honorable mention and fourth team or lower recognitions are not accorded any points.  Football consensus teams are compiled by position and the player accumulating the most points at each position is named first team consensus all-American.  Currently, the NCAA recognizes All-Americans selected by the '''AP, AFCA, FWAA, ''TSN'', and the WCFF''' to determine Consensus and Unanimous All-Americans. Any player named to the First Team by all five of the NCAA-recognized selectors is deemed a Unanimous All-American.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/stats/statistics+policies |title=2010-11 NCAA Statistics Policies(updated 9/15/2010) |accessdate=December 10, 2011 |archivedate=December 10, 2011 |date=September 15, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63plxMYlJ?url=http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/stats/statistics+policies |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.sportingnews.com/ca/ncaa-football/news/alabamas-tua-tagovailoa-2018-consensus-all-american-team/u4gei2bnxvig1jmptsbwhsj97 2018 Consensus All-America Team]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"0\" \n|-\n!

Sports]] (Yahoo!).\n\nCurrently, the NCAA compiles consensus all-America teams in the sports of [[NCAA Division I#Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I-FBS]] football and Division I men's basketball using a point system computed from All-America teams named by coaches associations or media sources.  The system consists of three points for a first-team honor, two points for second-team honor, and one point for third-team honor.  Honorable mention and fourth team or lower recognitions are not accorded any points.  Football consensus teams are compiled by position and the player accumulating the most points at each position is named first team consensus all-American.  Currently, the NCAA recognizes All-Americans selected by the '''AP, AFCA, FWAA, ''TSN'', and the WCFF''' to determine Consensus and Unanimous All-Americans. Any player named to the First Team by all five of the NCAA-recognized selectors is deemed a Unanimous All-American.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/stats/statistics+policies |title=2010-11 NCAA Statistics Policies(updated 9/15/2010) |accessdate=December 10, 2011 |archivedate=December 10, 2011 |date=September 15, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63plxMYlJ?url=http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/stats/statistics+policies |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.sportingnews.com/ca/ncaa-football/news/alabamas-tua-tagovailoa-2018-consensus-all-american-team/u4gei2bnxvig1jmptsbwhsj97 2018 Consensus All-America Team]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"0\" \n|-\n!

Under his tutelage, she suffered physical abuse during her formative years, with her instructor often punching her in the chest while she sang to force her voice to come from her gut.

Another story was that Otis spotted the Creolettes performing at a Los Angeles nightclub and sought for them to record his \"[[answer song]]\" to [[Hank Ballard]]'s \"[[Work with Me, Annie]]\". Otis took the group under his wing, helping them sign to [[Modern Records]] and changing their name from the Creolettes to the Peaches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/etta-james-mn0000806542/biography|title=Etta James {{!}} Biography & History {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2018-06-17}}</ref> He also gave the singer her stage name, transposing Jamesetta into Etta James. James recorded the version, for which she was given credit as co-author, in 1954, and the record was released in early 1955 as \"[[The Wallflower (Dance with Me, Henry)|Dance with Me, Henry]]\". The original title of the song was \"Roll with Me, Henry\", but it was changed to avoid censorship due to the off-color title (''roll'' connoting sexual activity). In February of that year, the song reached number one on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot Rhythm & Blues Tracks]] chart.<ref name=\"rockhall.com\"/> Its success gave the group an opening spot on [[Little Richard]]'s national tour.<ref name=\"whitepp68,78\">White, Charles (2003).

After leaving the Peaches, James had another R&B hit with \"Good Rockin' Daddy\" but struggled with follow-ups. When her contract with Modern came up for renewal in 1960, she signed a contract with [[Chess Records]] instead. Shortly afterward she was involved in a relationship with the singer [[Harvey Fuqua]], the founder of the doo-wop group the [[The Moonglows|Moonglows]].\n\nMusician [[Bobby Murray (musician)|Bobby Murray]] toured with James for over 20 years.

Though the record was not as successful as expected, her rendition has become the best-known version of the song.<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/> James followed that with \"Trust in Me\", which also included string instruments.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Later that same year, James released a second studio album, ''[[The Second Time Around (Etta James album)|The Second Time Around]]''.

These sessions yielded her comeback hit \"[[Tell Mama (song)|Tell Mama]]\", co-written by [[Clarence Carter]], which reached number ten R&B and number twenty-three pop.

In her autobiography, ''Rage to Survive'', she wrote that she heard the song outlined by her friend Ellington \"Fugi\" Jordan when she visited him in prison.<ref>James, Etta; Ritz, David (1995). ''Rage to Survive''. {{ISBN|0-306-80812-9}}.</ref> According to her account, she wrote the rest of the song with Jordan, but for tax reasons gave her songwriting credit to her partner at the time, Billy Foster.\n\nFollowing this success, James became an in-demand concert performer though she never again reached the heyday of her early to mid-1960s success. Her records continued to chart in the [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] Top 40 in the early 1970s, with singles such as \"Losers Weepers\" (1970) and \"I Found a Love\" (1972). Though James continued to record for Chess, she was devastated by the death of [[Leonard Chess]] in 1969. James ventured into rock and [[funk]] with the release of her self-titled album in 1973, with production from the famed rock producer [[Gabriel Mekler]], who had worked with [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] and [[Janis Joplin]], who had admired James and had covered \"Tell Mama\" in concert. The album, known for its mixture of musical styles, was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]].<ref name=\"oldies\"/> The album did not produce any major hits; neither did the follow-up, ''Come a Little Closer'', in 1974, though, like ''Etta James'' before it, the album was also critically acclaimed. James continued to record for Chess (now owned by [[All Platinum Records]]), releasing one more album in 1976, ''Etta Is Betta Than Evvah!'' Her 1978 album ''Deep in the Night'', produced by [[Jerry Wexler]] for Warner Bros., incorporated more rock-based music in her repertoire.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> That same year, James was the opening act for the [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] and performed at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]].

Under his tutelage, she suffered physical abuse during her formative years, with her instructor often punching her in the chest while she sang to force her voice to come from her gut.

Another story was that Otis spotted the Creolettes performing at a Los Angeles nightclub and sought for them to record his \"[[answer song]]\" to [[Hank Ballard]]'s \"[[Work with Me, Annie]]\".

The original title of the song was \"Roll with Me, Henry\", but it was changed to avoid censorship due to the off-color title (''roll'' connoting sexual activity). In February of that year, the song reached number one on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot Rhythm & Blues Tracks]] chart.<ref name=\"rockhall.com\"/> Its success gave the group an opening spot on [[Little Richard]]'s national tour.<ref name=\"whitepp68,78\">White, Charles (2003).

After leaving the Peaches, James had another R&B hit with \"Good Rockin' Daddy\" but struggled with follow-ups. When her contract with Modern came up for renewal in 1960, she signed a contract with [[Chess Records]] instead.

Though the record was not as successful as expected, her rendition has become the best-known version of the song.<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/> James followed that with \"Trust in Me\", which also included string instruments.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Later that same year, James released a second studio album, ''[[The Second Time Around (Etta James album)|The Second Time Around]]''.

In her autobiography, ''Rage to Survive'', she wrote that she heard the song outlined by her friend Ellington \"Fugi\" Jordan when she visited him in prison.<ref>James, Etta; Ritz, David (1995). ''Rage to Survive''. {{ISBN|0-306-80812-9}}.</ref> According to her account, she wrote the rest of the song with Jordan, but for tax reasons gave her songwriting credit to her partner at the time, Billy Foster.\n\nFollowing this success, James became an in-demand concert performer though she never again reached the heyday of her early to mid-1960s success. Her records continued to chart in the [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] Top 40 in the early 1970s, with singles such as \"Losers Weepers\" (1970) and \"I Found a Love\" (1972). Though James continued to record for Chess, she was devastated by the death of [[Leonard Chess]] in 1969. James ventured into rock and [[funk]] with the release of her self-titled album in 1973, with production from the famed rock producer [[Gabriel Mekler]], who had worked with [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] and [[Janis Joplin]], who had admired James and had covered \"Tell Mama\" in concert. The album, known for its mixture of musical styles, was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]].<ref name=\"oldies\"/> The album did not produce any major hits; neither did the follow-up, ''Come a Little Closer'', in 1974, though, like ''Etta James'' before it, the album was also critically acclaimed. James continued to record for Chess (now owned by [[All Platinum Records]]), releasing one more album in 1976, ''Etta Is Betta Than Evvah!'' Her 1978 album ''Deep in the Night'', produced by [[Jerry Wexler]] for Warner Bros., incorporated more rock-based music in her repertoire.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> That same year, James was the opening act for the [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] and performed at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]].

They replaced the  [[Douglas AC-47 Spooky]] and operated alongside the early versions of the [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130 Spectre]] gunship.\n\n==Design and development==\nBy late 1967, the idea of the fixed-wing gunship had been proven so successful, the United States Air Force was having a difficult time keeping up with demand.  The newer [[AC-130 gunship|AC-130s]] that had been created under '''Project Gunship II''' were effective, but were being mostly used for armed reconnaissance and [[interdiction]] of the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]].  Furthermore, the [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130]] airframe was in active service as a transport, vital to the war effort in Southeast Asia. The Air Force desperately needed a new gunship to replace the vulnerable and underpowered [[AC-47 Spooky|AC-47]] in the close air support role, as well as supplementing the AC-130 in attacking targets on the Ho Chi Minh Trail.\n\nThe [[Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar]] presented an obvious choice, having been phased out of front-line service in favor of the [[Fairchild C-123 Provider|C-123]] and C-130, and with the stock of available airframes in [[United States Air Force Reserve|U.S. Air Force Reserve]] being sufficient. In February 1968, under the USAF program '''Project Gunship III''', 26 C-119Gs were converted to AC-119G standard, initially taking on the name \"Creep\", but later assigned the callsign \"Shadow\".<ref>[http://www.strategic-air-command.com/aircraft/attack/ac119_gunship.htm \"Fairchild AC-119 Gunship 'Shadow'.\"] strategic-air-command. Retrieved: 8 May 2012.</ref>\n\nIn addition, [[Fairchild (aircraft manufacturer)|Fairchild-Hiller]], which was contracted for all the conversions, converted another 26 C-119Gs into AC-119Ks, primarily for the \"truck hunter\" role over the Ho Chi Minh Trail. These aircraft were called \"Stingers\" primarily in reference to the two [[M61 Vulcan]] 20-mm cannons they carried in addition to the AC-119G's four [[Minigun|GAU-2/A miniguns]]. The AC-119K could be visually distinguished by the addition of two [[General Electric J85]] turbojet engines in underwing pods. The conversions were completed at Fairchild-Hiller's facility in St. Augustine, Florida.\n\nProject Gunship III, being a follow-on to the success of the AC-130 series, meant that the AC-119 was a more advanced aircraft in both its iterations than the [[Douglas AC-47 Spooky|AC-47]]. Even the TIC AC-119G featured some of the most up-to-date [[electronic countermeasures]] and radar equipment, as well as more basic technology, including an AVQ-8 xenon light, a night observation sight, and an LAU-74/A flare launcher.\n\nThe AC-119K, designed to hit trucks on the Ho Chi Minh Trail, was more advanced. Included in the conversion was the AN/APN-147 Doppler navigation radar, AN/AAD-4 forward looking infrared, AN/APQ-133 side-looking beacon tracking radar and AN/APQ-136 search radar.\n\nThe armament scheme for both aircraft was simpler than that of the AC-130.  The AC-119G had a total of four GAU-2A/A miniguns in [[Minigun#Gun Pods and Mounts|SUU-11A/A]] pods, all on mounts similar to those used on early AC-47s. Like late-model AC-47s, these were soon changed to the purpose-built MXU-470/A minigun modules.  The AC-119K, needing a more powerful and longer range \"punch\" to take out vehicles, featured two M61 20-mm cannons in addition to the four miniguns of the AC-119G.\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:AC-119 Stinger.png|thumb|right|300px|One of the J85 turbojet engines added to later models of the AC-119 is visible in this photo.]]\nBy November 1968, the aircraft had deployed to Vietnam and joined the [[14th Special Operations Wing]] at [[Nha Trang Air Base]].  The AC-119Gs were placed in the [[71st Special Operations Squadron]] which was formed from the activated 71st Troop Carrier Squadron, of the [[Air Force Reserve]] located at [[Bakalar Air Force Base]] in Columbus, Indiana. When the 71 SOS returned to continental USA in 1969, the gunships were taken over by the newly formed [[17th Special Operations Squadron|17 SOS]].\n \nThe AC-119Ks were placed in the [[18th Special Operations Squadron]].  With the addition of the two types, the 14 SOW for a time in 1968 was flying eight different aircraft from ten different bases in South Vietnam.  The 14 SOW was inactivated in 1971. Limited numbers continued to be operated out of Thailand as late as the fall of 1972, but the AC-119 was phased out shortly after from the US Air Force.  The AC-119G and 119K continued to serve with the [[Republic of Vietnam Air Force]] (RVNAF) until the [[Fall of Saigon]] in 1975.  During the Vietnam War, only five AC-119 Gunship IIIs were lost to all causes.<ref>Hobson 2001</ref>\n\n==Operators==\n; {{flag|South Vietnam}}\n[[Republic of Vietnam Air Force]]\n; {{USA}}\n[[United States Air Force]]\n* [[14th Special Operations Wing]] \u2013 [[Nha Trang Air Base]], [[South Vietnam]]\n:: [[17th Special Operations Squadron]] 1969\u20131971\n:: [[18th Special Operations Squadron]] 1969\u20131971\n:: [[71st Special Operations Squadron]] 1968\u20131969\n:: (Detachments at [[Tan Son Nhut Air Base|Tan San Nhut]], [[Phan Rang Air Base|Phan Rang]] and [[Ph\u00f9 C\u00e1t Air Base|Phu Cat AB]])\n* [[56th Special Operations Wing]] \u2013 Nakhon Phanom Air Base, [[Thailand]]\n:: 18th Special Operations Squadron 1971\u20131972\n\n==Surviving example==\n* AC-119G Shadow, AF Ser.
