Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

A target web page may be removed. The server that hosts the target page could fail, be removed from service, or relocate to a new [[domain name]]. A domain name's registration may lapse or be transferred to another party. Some causes will result in the link failing to find any target at returning an error such as [[HTTP 404]]. Other causes will cause a link to target content other than what was intended by the link's author.\n\nOther reasons for broken links include:\n* the restructuring of websites that causes changes in URLs (e.g. {{code|domain.net/pine_tree}} might be moved to {{code|domain.net/tree/pine}})\n* relocation of formerly free content to behind a [[paywall]]\n* a change in server architecture that results in code such as [[PHP]] functioning differently\n* dynamic page content such as search results that changes by design\n* the presence of user-specific information such as a login name within the link\n* deliberate blocking by [[content filter]]s or [[Firewall (networking)|firewalls]]\n* the removal of [[Generic top-level domain|gTLDs]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/the-death-of-a-tld|title=The death of a TLD|website=blog.benjojo.co.uk|access-date=2018-07-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726220205/https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/the-death-of-a-tld|archive-date=2018-07-26|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Prevention and detection==\nStrategies for preventing link rot can focus on placing content where its likelihood of persisting is strong, authoring links that are less likely to be broken, taking steps to preserve existing links, or repairing links whose targets have been relocated or removed.\n\nThe creation of URLs that will not change with time is the fundamental method of preventing link rot.

A target web page may be removed. The server that hosts the target page could fail, be removed from service, or relocate to a new [[domain name]]. A domain name's registration may lapse or be transferred to another party. Some causes will result in the link failing to find any target at returning an error such as [[HTTP 404]]. Other causes will cause a link to target content other than what was intended by the link's author.\n\nOther reasons for broken links include:\n* the restructuring of websites that causes changes in URLs (e.g. {{code|domain.net/pine_tree}} might be moved to {{code|domain.net/tree/pine}})\n* relocation of formerly free content to behind a [[paywall]]\n* a change in server architecture that results in code such as [[PHP]] functioning differently\n* dynamic page content such as search results that changes by design\n* the presence of user-specific information such as a login name within the link\n* deliberate blocking by [[content filter]]s or [[Firewall (networking)|firewalls]]\n* the removal of [[Generic top-level domain|gTLDs]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/the-death-of-a-tld|title=The death of a TLD|website=blog.benjojo.co.uk|access-date=2018-07-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726220205/https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/the-death-of-a-tld|archive-date=2018-07-26|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Prevention and detection==\nStrategies for preventing link rot can focus on placing content where its likelihood of persisting is strong, authoring links that are less likely to be broken, taking steps to preserve existing links, or repairing links whose targets have been relocated or removed.\n\nThe creation of URLs that will not change with time is the fundamental method of preventing link rot.

[[Porridge]] is made by mixing maize flour or millet flour with water and bringing the mixture to a boil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://raebear.net/recipes/ugandaporridge.html|title=Porridge|accessdate=27 March 2014}}</ref> While [[Katogo (food)|Katogo]] is made from [[matoke]] (green [[bananas]]), peeled and cooked in the same pot with a sauce ([[Beef]], [[peanut]]s, beans or greens), Katogo is served with [[tea]] or [[juice]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/artsculture/Dining---Recipes/-/691226/941578/-/c8y70v/-/index.html|title=Katogo|publisher=Monitor News paper|accessdate=27 March 2014}}</ref> Both dishes are popular in all regions of Uganda.\n\n==Asia==\nBreakfasts vary widely throughout [[Asia]]. In Arab countries, breakfast is often a quick meal, consisting of [[bread]] and dairy products, with [[tea]] and sometimes jam. Flat bread with olive oil and ''[[Za'atar|za'tar]]'' is also popular.<ref name=\"fescooking.com\" />\n\n===China===\n[[File:Mama's congee. (464786586).jpg|thumb|right|Chinese homemade congee]]\nAs [[mainland China]] is made up of many distinct provinces, each with their own unique cuisine, breakfast in China can vary significantly from province to province. In general, basic choices include sweet or salty pancakes, soup, deep-fried bread sticks or doughnuts ([[youtiao]]), buns ([[mantou]]), porridge ([[congee]]), and fried or soup-based noodles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chinese Cuisine|url=http://www.saturdaymarket.com/chinabreakfast/intro.htm|accessdate=28 June 2012}}</ref> These options are often accompanied by tea or sweetened soybean milk. However, condiments for porridge and the soup base tend to vary between provinces and regions. The types of teas that are served and spices that are used can also differ significantly between the provinces.\n\n====Hong Kong====\nDue to its near two centuries' history as a British colony and proximity to China's Canton region, both English and traditional Cantonese style breakfasts are of somewhat equal popularity in [[Hong Kong]], as well as the hybrid form of breakfast commonly offered in [[Cha chaan teng]]. Cha Chaan Teng breakfasts often include [[Hong Kong-style milk tea]], pan fried egg, bread, Cantonese noodles or Hong Kong style macaroni in soup.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://travel.cnn.com/hong-kong/eat/cha-chaan-teng-cheat-sheet-how-order-hong-kongs-temples-comfort-food-726567|title=Cha chaan teng cheat sheet: What to order at the most popular eateries in Hong Kong|work=travel.cnn.com|accessdate=30 December 2013}}</ref> Traditional Cantonese breakfast may include [[dim sum]], which include a variety of different ingredients and are prepared in numerous different forms from delicately wrapped baby shrimp steamed dumplings to sweet water chestnut cake. Each dish is designed to be sampled and diners can go through a large selection of dim sum quickly accompanied by a generous amount of good tea. ''[[Tieguanyin]]'' is the most common accompaniment, but other teas such as ''[[pu'er tea|pu'er]]'' and ''[[oolong]]'' are also common.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Taste of Chinese Breakfast|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/Life/35510.htm|accessdate=28 June 2012}}</ref> Fried and rice-based noodles and cakes are also popular. In modern times, dim sum is commonly prepared and served in [[Yum cha|Yum Cha]] restaurants rather than at home because of the skill and efforts involved in the preparation.\n\n===Bangladesh===\nThe typical Bangladeshi breakfast consists of flour-based flat breads such as [[chapati]], [[roti]] or [[paratha]], served with a curry.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Usually the curry can be vegetable, home-fried potatoes or scrambled eggs. The breakfast varies according to location and the eater's income. In villages and rural areas, rice with curry (potato mash, dal ) is mostly preferred by day labourers. In the city, sliced bread with jam or jelly is chosen due to time efficiency. In Bangladesh tea is preferred to coffee, and is an essential part of most breakfasts.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Having toasted biscuits, bread or puffed rice with tea is also very popular.\n\n===India===\nIn all, there are at least 25 types of Indian breakfasts, each consisting of a choice of over 100 different food items.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jaffrey|first1=Madhur|title=Vegetarian India|year= 2015|publisher=Penguin Random House|location=New Delhi|url=http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/247938/vegetarian-india-by-madhur-jaffrey/9781101874868|accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref> Each state in India has different specialties and items for breakfast.

Other popular south Indian breakfast items are [[Pongal (dish)|pongal]], [[bisibelebath]] (sambar rice), [[upma]], and [[poori]].

Frequently breakfast can be as simple as butter and jam on bread with tea. Iranians prefer to drink their hot black tea with sugar. Traditional cooked dishes for breakfast include [[haleem]] (wheat and chicken/lamb/turkey porridge eaten with cinnamon) or [[Khash (dish)|kale pache]] (sheep's feet, stomach, and other offal), adasi (green lentil soup), fried/boiled/soft-boiled eggs, ''omlet'' (eggs cooked in tomato sauce).\n\n===Israel===\n{{main|Israeli breakfast}}\n[[File:The 7 Breakfasts - Espresso Bar.jpg|thumb|right|An [[Israeli breakfast]]]]\nThe Israeli breakfast is a mix of culinary influences from eastern Europe, [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] [[Yishuv]] culture, [[Maghreb cuisine|North African cuisine]], and [[Levantine cuisine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bonvoyageurs.com/2016/05/15/israeli-breakfast/|title=The Israeli breakfast \u2013 Best in the world!|last1=Gagnon|first1=Lynn|date=15 May 2016|website=BonVoyageurs|publisher=|access-date=19 May 2016}}</ref> It usually consists of a range of cheeses along with sliced vegetables, scrambled eggs (or another kind of fried egg)<ref name=\"Dubois\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GDy_1w83KEUC&pg=PA122&dq=%22Israeli+breakfast%22#v=onepage&q=%22Israeli%20breakfast%22&f=false|title=Cultures of the World: Israel|last=Dubois|first=Jill|last2=Rosh|first2=Mair|publisher=[[Marshall Cavendish]]|year=2004|isbn=9780761416692|location=[[Singapore]]|page=122|jfm=}}</ref><ref name=\"Marks\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gFK_yx7Ps7cC&pg=PT563&dq=%22Israeli+breakfast%22|title=Encyclopedia of Jewish Food|last=Marks|first=Gil|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|year=2010|isbn=9780544186316|location=[[Boston]]|jfm=|authorlink=Gil Marks}}</ref> and bread, served with spreads like butter, jam, or honey.

The term originated in Britain in the mid-19th century, first used in 1896 public hygiene book ''The Sanitarian'', in which \"continent\" refers to the countries of mainland [[Europe]], though the idea had been around for a few decades as American hotels endeavored to appeal to the changing tastes of the emerging middle class and European travelers visiting America. The term refers to the type of breakfast found in places such as France and the Mediterranean, which is lighter and more delicate than the typical full English breakfast, which tends to consist of a large plate of eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, beans, and roasted mushrooms and tomatoes, and American breakfasts featuring eggs, breakfast meats, pancakes, potatoes, and toast. Continental breakfasts are also more cost-effective for the establishments serving them, because they require fewer staff to prepare them.<ref>Goldfarb, Anna (January 18, 2018).

The sandwich is buttered (with margarine), with toppings such as [[prosciutto]] and yellow [[cheese]].\n\n===Albania===\nIn [[Albania]] the breakfast often consists of a scone, milk, tea, eggs, jam or cheese. Meat is not preferred during the breakfast and it is usually substituted for seafood such as canned sardines or tuna which is typically served with condiments such as mustard or mayonnaise. Whole grain cereals and pastries are mostly consumed by children. A shot of [[Rakia|raki]] may be added to coffee as in the Italian ''[[Caff\u00e8 corretto]]''.\n\n===Croatia===\nIn [[Croatia]] the base is a continental breakfast with a variety of pastries with or without fillings ([[marmalade]], chocolate, cheese, ham, nuts, [[poppy]]) and [[fermented milk products]] (yogurt, soured milk, soured cream).

Marmalade/jams or even chocolate spreads are also common on bread or toast. Today cereal bars are also becoming a common type of breakfast on the island. The traditional English breakfast of eggs, sausages, and fried bacon was also popular among the Maltese, especially on Sundays, due to the strong British influence on the island, but this has diminished almost completely, as locals have rediscovered a more Mediterranean and continental diet over the recent years.

Sides include various cold cuts, meat spreads, the Polish sausage [[kielbasa]], tomatoes, cheese, and sliced pickles. ''[[Quark (cheese)|Twar\u00f3g]],'' a Polish cheese, is the breakfast classic and comes in many forms. ''Twar\u00f3g'' can be eaten plain, with salt, sugar, or honey, or it can be mixed with [[chives]] into a [[cream cheese]]-like spread. Eggs are served often as the main breakfast item, mostly soft-boiled or scrambled. For a quick winter breakfast, hot oatmeal, to which cocoa is sometimes added, is often served. Jam spreads are popular for a quick breakfast, including plum, raspberry, and black or red [[Ribes|currant]] spreads. Breakfast drinks include coffee, milk, hot cocoa, or tea. Traditionally, the Poles avoid heavy-cooked foods for breakfast.<ref>Polish Cooking Marianna Olszewska Heberle Penguin 2005 {{ISBN|9781440624759}}</ref> For the most part, one will not see fried meats or potatoes in a classic Polish breakfast.

Sometimes the buttered bread is served savory instead of sweet, in which case the Romanians add cured meats, salami, or cheese. Another option is to spread on a slice of bread some liver p\u00e2t\u00e9.

Dating from a time when hard labour was more common, calorie intakes were necessarily higher, and servant labour was more available, it is nowadays regarded as a meal for the weekend or holidays when time is available for preparation, prepared by parents to welcome children, or as a special occasion such as a birthday or anniversary, or following a night of drinking. A healthy and nutritious version consists of grilling the protein and using poached, rather than fried, eggs, and variations based on one egg, one protein, and toast abound. It remains by far the most common choice on [[brunch]] menus and breakfast cafes across the region. The \"full Scottish breakfast\" tends to omit pork sausages and have beef sausages or lamb [[haggis]] instead. At its most extensive it consists of eggs, [[Lorne sausage|square sausage]], fried dumpling, [[potato scone]], tomato, mushrooms, bacon beef links, and [[fried bread]].

They are prepared raw or boiled, then they are ground with some vinegar, chopped onions, and chopped cilantro to make the hot sauce. A traditional egg dish prepared with both green and red sauces is called \"huevos divorciados.\"\nIn the eastern part of the country, specifically in [[Zacapa]], you can find \"huevos a caballo\" or (eggs on a horse) which is basically two fried eggs over roasted steak.\n\nOther types of breakfast include milk cereals.

It always includes black coffee (tinto) or with milk (called pintado) with any of these sides: corn tortillas, traditional white cheese (or queso del pais), another type of tortillas or \"torrejas\" made of wheat flour known as \"[[hojaldres]].\" Another traditional breakfast side is \"[[bollo]]\" made out of either corn, white corn, or coconut that is wrapped in corn leaves and \"pre\u00f1a'o\" (meaning with child) that means it's filled with some type of meat.\n\nAs protein, a large serving of beef liver with onion, scrambled or fried eggs, beef stew or \"tasajo\" (a type of beef jerky), pork rinds and different kinds of sausages like chorizo or ''[[morcilla]]'' are the most popular. These are also accompanied by: slices of green plantain or [[cooking plantain]], \"[[patacones]]\" (double fried plantain), [[carima\u00f1ola]]s (yuca filled with meat), as well as different bread pastries both savory and sweet. These large breakfasts are normally reserved for special occasions while everyday breakfasts consist of more traditional food from the west like toast, ham, cheese, jam etc.\n\nIt is important to mention that the prolonged US presence has also influenced urban areas of Panama by introducing meals like cereal with milk as well as pancakes with syrup as traditional breakfast meals.<ref>[[:es:Desayuno#Panam\u00e1]]</ref>\n\n===United States===\n{{See also|List of American breakfast foods}}\n[[File:NYC-Diner-ToGo-Overeasy-Eggs.jpg|thumb|right|An example of an American diner breakfast, with overeasy eggs, home fries, bacon, and buttered toast]]\nThe average starting time for breakfasts in the United States has been found to be 8:12&nbsp;a.m, and varies from 8:08&nbsp;a.m. in the South to 8:17&nbsp;a.m. in the West.<ref>{{Citation|last=Larson|first=Robert B.|title=When is Dinner?|date=2002|volume=33|issue=3|pages=38\u201345|periodical=Journal of Food Distribution Research|doi=10.22004/ag.econ.26834|issn=2643-3354}}</ref> Breakfast often consists of a combination of hot or cold cereals, eggs, breakfast meats, and breakfast quick breads such as [[pancake]]s, [[waffle]]s, or [[biscuit]]s.

Several kinds of cheeses are popular, including ''{{Transl|arz|gebna b\u0113\u1e0da}}'' or [[Domyati]] cheese, ''{{transl|arz|gebna r\u016bmi}}'' (Roman cheese) which is similar to ''[[Pecorino Romano]]'' or ''[[Manchego]]'', and Istanbuli cheese (a brined white cheese with peppers added to the brine which makes it spicy). Fried eggs with [[pastirma]] is also a common breakfast food in Egypt.\n\n=== Malawi ===\nFor breakfast, some children in Malawi eat porridge, [[cornbread]], savory [[fritter]]s, boiled starchy vegetables, such as white potatoes, [[sweet potato]]es, or [[pumpkin]], and drink [[Sweet tea|sweet black tea]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/08/magazine/eaters-all-over.html,%20https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/08/magazine/eaters-all-over.html|title=What Kids Around the World Eat for Breakfast|last=Whitaker|first=Hannah|date=2014-10-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-01-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n===Morocco===\n[[File:Rghaif (detalle).jpg|thumb|right|[[Msemen]], a common breakfast in [[Moroccan cuisine]]]]\nFor breakfast, many Moroccans eat bread, harsha (semolina griddle cakes), or [[msemen]] (oiled pancakes) with olive oil, tea, and different kinds of Moroccan crepes.<ref name=\"fescooking.com\">{{cite web|url=http://fescooking.com/come-cook-with-us/the-art-of-moroccan-cuisine|title=The Art of Moroccan Cuisine \u2013 Cooking Classes in Morocco &#124; Fes Cooking and Cultural Tours|author=Special Events|date=18 July 2013|publisher=Fescooking.com|accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Nigeria===\n[[Nigeria]] has over 250 different ethnic groups,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ni.html|title=Africa :: Nigeria|publisher=cia.gov}}</ref> with a corresponding variety of cuisines.

Both of these cakes can be served with porridge and sugar known as ''koko''.

(464786586).jpg|thumb|right|Chinese homemade congee]]\nAs [[mainland China]] is made up of many distinct provinces, each with their own unique cuisine, breakfast in China can vary significantly from province to province. In general, basic choices include sweet or salty pancakes, soup, deep-fried bread sticks or doughnuts ([[youtiao]]), buns ([[mantou]]), porridge ([[congee]]), and fried or soup-based noodles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chinese Cuisine|url=http://www.saturdaymarket.com/chinabreakfast/intro.htm|accessdate=28 June 2012}}</ref> These options are often accompanied by tea or sweetened soybean milk. However, condiments for porridge and the soup base tend to vary between provinces and regions. The types of teas that are served and spices that are used can also differ significantly between the provinces.\n\n====Hong Kong====\nDue to its near two centuries' history as a British colony and proximity to China's Canton region, both English and traditional Cantonese style breakfasts are of somewhat equal popularity in [[Hong Kong]], as well as the hybrid form of breakfast commonly offered in [[Cha chaan teng]].

''[[Tieguanyin]]'' is the most common accompaniment, but other teas such as ''[[pu'er tea|pu'er]]'' and ''[[oolong]]'' are also common.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Taste of Chinese Breakfast|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/Life/35510.htm|accessdate=28 June 2012}}</ref> Fried and rice-based noodles and cakes are also popular.

The breakfast varies according to location and the eater's income. In villages and rural areas, rice with curry (potato mash, dal ) is mostly preferred by day labourers. In the city, sliced bread with jam or jelly is chosen due to time efficiency. In Bangladesh tea is preferred to coffee, and is an essential part of most breakfasts.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Having toasted biscuits, bread or puffed rice with tea is also very popular.\n\n===India===\nIn all, there are at least 25 types of Indian breakfasts, each consisting of a choice of over 100 different food items.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jaffrey|first1=Madhur|title=Vegetarian India|year= 2015|publisher=Penguin Random House|location=New Delhi|url=http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/247938/vegetarian-india-by-madhur-jaffrey/9781101874868|accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref> Each state in India has different specialties and items for breakfast.

Other popular south Indian breakfast items are [[Pongal (dish)|pongal]], [[bisibelebath]] (sambar rice), [[upma]], and [[poori]].

The term originated in Britain in the mid-19th century, first used in 1896 public hygiene book ''The Sanitarian'', in which \"continent\" refers to the countries of mainland [[Europe]], though the idea had been around for a few decades as American hotels endeavored to appeal to the changing tastes of the emerging middle class and European travelers visiting America. The term refers to the type of breakfast found in places such as France and the Mediterranean, which is lighter and more delicate than the typical full English breakfast, which tends to consist of a large plate of eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, beans, and roasted mushrooms and tomatoes, and American breakfasts featuring eggs, breakfast meats, pancakes, potatoes, and toast. Continental breakfasts are also more cost-effective for the establishments serving them, because they require fewer staff to prepare them.<ref>Goldfarb, Anna (January 18, 2018).

The sandwich is buttered (with margarine), with toppings such as [[prosciutto]] and yellow [[cheese]].\n\n===Albania===\nIn [[Albania]] the breakfast often consists of a scone, milk, tea, eggs, jam or cheese. Meat is not preferred during the breakfast and it is usually substituted for seafood such as canned sardines or tuna which is typically served with condiments such as mustard or mayonnaise. Whole grain cereals and pastries are mostly consumed by children. A shot of [[Rakia|raki]] may be added to coffee as in the Italian ''[[Caff\u00e8 corretto]]''.\n\n===Croatia===\nIn [[Croatia]] the base is a continental breakfast with a variety of pastries with or without fillings ([[marmalade]], chocolate, cheese, ham, nuts, [[poppy]]) and [[fermented milk products]] (yogurt, soured milk, soured cream).

The main food consists of sweet products such as ''tartines'' (slices of [[baguette]] or other breads spread with butter, jam, or chocolate paste), sometimes dunked in the hot drink.

Marmalade/jams or even chocolate spreads are also common on bread or toast. Today cereal bars are also becoming a common type of breakfast on the island. The traditional English breakfast of eggs, sausages, and fried bacon was also popular among the Maltese, especially on Sundays, due to the strong British influence on the island, but this has diminished almost completely, as locals have rediscovered a more Mediterranean and continental diet over the recent years. Hotels usually serve both a continental as well as a full English breakfast.

Sides include various cold cuts, meat spreads, the Polish sausage [[kielbasa]], tomatoes, cheese, and sliced pickles. ''[[Quark (cheese)|Twar\u00f3g]],'' a Polish cheese, is the breakfast classic and comes in many forms. ''Twar\u00f3g'' can be eaten plain, with salt, sugar, or honey, or it can be mixed with [[chives]] into a [[cream cheese]]-like spread. Eggs are served often as the main breakfast item, mostly soft-boiled or scrambled. For a quick winter breakfast, hot oatmeal, to which cocoa is sometimes added, is often served. Jam spreads are popular for a quick breakfast, including plum, raspberry, and black or red [[Ribes|currant]] spreads. Breakfast drinks include coffee, milk, hot cocoa, or tea. Traditionally, the Poles avoid heavy-cooked foods for breakfast.<ref>Polish Cooking Marianna Olszewska Heberle Penguin 2005 {{ISBN|9781440624759}}</ref> For the most part, one will not see fried meats or potatoes in a classic Polish breakfast. Emphasis is placed on a large variety of foods to satisfy everyone at the breakfast table.\n\n===Romania===\nThe traditional Romanian breakfast is milk, tea or coffee alongside (toasted) bread with butter or margarine and on top of it, honey or fruit jams or preserves. Sometimes the buttered bread is served savory instead of sweet, in which case the Romanians add cured meats, salami, or cheese. Another option is to spread on a slice of bread some liver p\u00e2t\u00e9.

Freshly squeezed orange juice is widely available in most places as an alternative for coffee. The breakfast is not often larger than these two items, because usually in late morning there is a break known as ''[[almuerzo]]'' when there is a snack. Sometimes, toast is replaced with ''galletas'' (a type of cookie made with flour, sugar, oil, and vanilla flavour), ''magdalenas'' (a Spanish version of the French [[Madeleine (cake)|madeleine]] made with oil instead of butter) or buns.\n\n===Sweden===\nBreakfast in [[Sweden]] is usually an [[open sandwich]] of soft bread or [[crisp bread]], cold cuts, [[sm\u00f6rg\u00e5skaviar]], cheese, cottage cheese, cream cheese, eggs, scrambled or boiled, p\u00e2t\u00e9 ([[leverpastej]]) with [[pickled cucumber]], tomatoes or cucumber, or a toast with marmalade or maybe honey, juices, coffee, [[hot chocolate]]. or tea.

Tea and coffee remain equally popular accompaniments. Marmalade, originally a Portuguese confection, had been a popular British spread to consume in the evening, before the Scots moved it to the breakfast table in the 18th century.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/08/19/1061261128384.html|title=Spread over centuries|date=10 June 2015|agency=The Age|issue=19 August 2003}}</ref> It is however becoming very common to 'skip breakfast' entirely or take coffee or pastries on the morning commute. Portable quick snacks such as [[granola bars]], ready-cut fruit and warm takeaway foods are becoming increasingly commonly consumed away from home and are sold at commuting points and [[newsagents]] and local shops in all urban areas.\n\nThe traditional breakfast most associated with Britain and Ireland remains, however, the [[full breakfast]] of eggs (fried, scrambled, or [[poaching (cooking)|poached]]) with [[bacon]] and [[sausages]], usually with mushrooms, tomatoes, [[baked beans]], fried bread, [[black pudding]] or [[white pudding]], and toast. Dating from a time when hard labour was more common, calorie intakes were necessarily higher, and servant labour was more available, it is nowadays regarded as a meal for the weekend or holidays when time is available for preparation, prepared by parents to welcome children, or as a special occasion such as a birthday or anniversary, or following a night of drinking. A healthy and nutritious version consists of grilling the protein and using poached, rather than fried, eggs, and variations based on one egg, one protein, and toast abound. It remains by far the most common choice on [[brunch]] menus and breakfast cafes across the region. The \"full Scottish breakfast\" tends to omit pork sausages and have beef sausages or lamb [[haggis]] instead. At its most extensive it consists of eggs, [[Lorne sausage|square sausage]], fried dumpling, [[potato scone]], tomato, mushrooms, bacon beef links, and [[fried bread]]. Originating in the British isles during the [[Victorian era]], the full breakfast is among the most internationally recognised [[British cuisine|British dishes]].<ref>{{cite book|title=British Food: An Extraordinary Thousand Years of History|last=Spencer|first=Colin|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-231-13110-0}}</ref>\n\nAnother traditional British breakfast consists of [[porridge]], although now associated with Scotland, it has been consumed across Britain as a staple food since at least the [[Middle Ages]].

With this comes fresh cream, fresh cheese, and fried plantains (or [[cooking plantain]]). It is common to add hot sauce made out of \"[[chiltepe]]s\" (a type of pepper). They are prepared raw or boiled, then they are ground with some vinegar, chopped onions, and chopped cilantro to make the hot sauce. A traditional egg dish prepared with both green and red sauces is called \"huevos divorciados.\"\nIn the eastern part of the country, specifically in [[Zacapa]], you can find \"huevos a caballo\" or (eggs on a horse) which is basically two fried eggs over roasted steak.\n\nOther types of breakfast include milk cereals. The most common drinks are orange juice or other fruits, milk, atol (a milk pudding with chocolate), and corn starch. The coffee is normally served with sweet bread also called \"pan de manteca\" (or butter bread).\n\n===Honduras===\nIn [[Honduras]] it is typical to start the day with homemade bread, with coffee or a glass of milk. Then, a plate of food with beans, alongside eggs that can be scrambled or sunny side up, slivers of fried plantain (or [[cooking plantain]]), corn, tortillas, cheese, and butter. Versions of egg preparation vary: \"estrellados\" which consists of just cracking the shell, in \"torta\" or omelette (beaten with some salt), scrambled or boiled. Another typical breakfast are the [[baleadas]] and tortillas with cheese; sometimes they are fried together with cheese in between. In the \"gar\u00edfuna\" culture, coffee is accompanied by \"m\u00ednimo\" bread (banana bread) or coconut bread.\n\n===Jamaica===\nA Jamaican breakfast includes [[ackee and saltfish]], seasoned [[callaloo]], boiled [[green banana]]s, and [[jonnycake|fried dumplings]].<ref name=\"breakfast\">Deborah S.

Following a sizable victory for Trump in the [[New Hampshire Republican primary, 2016|New Hampshire primary]], Christie, Fiorina, and Gilmore abandoned the race.

The Russian intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army (GRU) carried out these operations. In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks. Around the time that the DNC announced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government's role in hacking its network, the GRU began disseminating stolen materials through the fictitious online personas \"DCLeaks\" and \"Guccifer 2.0.\" The GRU later released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks.</ref>\n\nTo establish whether a crime was committed by members of the Trump campaign with regard to Russian interference, the special counsel's investigators \"applied the framework of [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy law]]\", and not the concept of \"collusion\", because collusion \"is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Morais |first1=Betsy |title=Collusion by any other name |url=https://www.cjr.org/first_person/trump-mueller-collusion.php |date=April 18, 2019 |work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] |access-date=April 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol. I, p. 2: In evaluating whether evidence about the collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of \"collusion.\" In so doing, the Office recognized that the word \"collud[e]\" was used in communications with the Acting Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation's scope and that the term has frequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons, the Office's focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law.</ref> They also investigated if members of the Trump campaign \"coordinated\" with Russia, using the definition of \"coordination\" as having \"an agreement\u2014tacit or express\u2014between the Trump campaign and the Russian government on election interference\". Investigators further elaborated that merely having \"two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests\" was not enough to establish coordination.<!-- ref name=NYTcompare/ --><ref>''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol.

Like collusion, \"coordination\" does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood coordination to require an agreement\u2014tacit or express\u2014between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests. We applied the term coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.</ref>\n\nThe Mueller Report writes that the investigation \"identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign\", found that Russia \"perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency\" and that the 2016 Trump presidential campaign \"expected it would benefit electorally\" from Russian hacking efforts. Ultimately, \"the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities\".<ref name=\"GlobeGraphic\">{{Cite web |last1=Ostriker |first1=Rebecca |last2=Puzzanghera |first2=Jim |last3=Finucane |first3=Martin |last4=Datar |first4=Saurabh |last5=Uraizee |first5=Irfan |last6=Garvin |first6=Patrick |title=What the Mueller report says about Trump and more |url=https://apps.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/graphics/2019/03/mueller-report/ |website=[[The Boston Globe]] |access-date=April 22, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"TIMErelease\">{{cite magazine |last1=Law |first1=Tara |title=Here Are the Biggest Takeaways From the Mueller Report |url=http://time.com/5567077/mueller-report-release/ |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=April 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\nHowever, investigators had an incomplete picture of what had really occurred during the 2016 campaign, due to some associates of Trump campaign providing either false, incomplete or declined testimony, as well as having deleted, unsaved or encrypted communications.

The study points out that since the 1980s, the advancement of technology has often led to a significant fraction of the workforce being worse off. Low skilled workers affected by [[Technological unemployment|technology driven job displacement]] had to replace their middle-income jobs with lower-income service jobs, or were pushed out of the workforce altogether, while the advancement of technology increased the demand for high-income jobs among skilled workers. Frey and his co-authors note a positive trend between automation driven income inequality and the movement toward [[political polarization]] in the United States. The study found a strong correlation between areas affected by technological automation and the increase of support for Donald Trump among low-skilled workers in the affected voting districts, concluding that:<blockquote>While the Computer Revolution has not rendered the workforce redundant, a large share of Americans have lost the race to technology, which is reflected in the reallocation of millions of workers from middle-income jobs to low-income occupations or non-employment as their jobs have been automated away{{nbsp}}... the victims of the Computer Revolution have a higher propensity to opt for radical political change: electoral districts with a higher share of jobs exposed to automation were significantly more likely to support Trump. The 2016 U.S. Presidential Election can thus be described as a riot against machines by democratic means.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Frey|first=Carl Benedikt|last2=Berger|first2=Thor|last3=Chen|first3=Chinchih|date=July 23, 2017|title=Political Machinery: Automation Anxiety and the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election|url=https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/Political%20Machinery-Automation%20Anxiety%20and%20the%202016%20U_S_%20Presidential%20Election_230712.pdf}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Candidates table ===\n\n<!-- This table is sorted by pledged electors first (that is, ignoring faithless electors), then by popular vote among candidates with 0 pledged electors. -->\n{{start U.S. presidential ticket box|pv_footnote=|ev_footnote=}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan|name=[[Donald Trump]]|party=[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]|state=[[New York (state)|New York]]|pv= 62,984,828 |pv_pct= 46.09% |ev-projected=306|ev=304 (306)|vp_count=1|vp_name=[[Mike Pence]]|vp_party=[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]|vp_state=[[Indiana]]|vp_ev=304}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan|name=[[Hillary Clinton]]|party=[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]|state=[[New York (state)|New York]]|pv= 65,853,514 |pv_pct= 48.18% |ev-projected=232|ev=227 (232)|vp_count=1|vp_name=[[Tim Kaine]]|vp_party=[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]|vp_state=[[Virginia]]|vp_ev=227}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Gary Johnson]]| party=[[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]]| state=[[New Mexico]]| pv= 4,489,341 | pv_pct= 3.28% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Bill Weld]]| vp_party=[[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]]| vp_state=[[Massachusetts]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Jill Stein]]| party=[[Green Party of the United States|Green]]| state=[[Massachusetts]]| pv= 1,457,218 | pv_pct= 1.07% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Ajamu Baraka]]| vp_party=[[Green Party (United States)|Green]]| vp_state=[[Illinois]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row| name=[[Evan McMullin]]| party=[[Independent politician|Independent]]| state=[[Utah]]| pv= 731,991 | pv_pct= 0.54% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Mindy Finn]]| vp_party=[[Independent politician|Independent]]| vp_state=[[District of Columbia]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row| name=[[Darrell Castle]]|| party=[[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution]]| state=[[Tennessee]]| pv= 203,090 | pv_pct= 0.15% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Scott Bradley (politician)|Scott Bradley]]| vp_party=[[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution]]| vp_state=[[Utah]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan| name=[[Bernie Sanders]]{{efn|name=faithless}}| party=[[Independent politician|Independent]]| state=[[Vermont]]| pv= 111,850 {{efn|name=write-in}}| pv_pct= 0.08% {{efn|name=write-in}}| ev-projected=0| ev=1 (0)| vp_count=1| vp_name=[[Elizabeth Warren]]{{efn|name=faithless}}|vp_party=[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]| vp_state=[[Massachusetts]]| vp_ev=1}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Gloria La Riva]]|party=[[Party for Socialism and Liberation|Socialism and Liberation]]|state=[[California]]| pv= 74,401 | pv_pct= 0.05% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Eugene Puryear]]|vp_party=[[Party for Socialism and Liberation|Socialism and Liberation]]| vp_state=[[District of Columbia]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan| name=[[John Kasich]]{{efn|name=faithless}}{{efn|name=paul-kasich|Two faithless electors from Texas cast their presidential votes for Ron Paul and John Kasich, respectively.

However, FiveThirtyEight's model pointed to the possibility of an Electoral College-popular vote split widening in the final weeks based on Trump's improvement in swing states like Florida or Pennsylvania. This was due to the demographics targeted by Trump's campaign which lived in big numbers there, in addition to Clinton's poor performance in several of those swing states in comparison with Obama's performance in 2012, as well as having a big number of her potential voters in very populated traditionally 'blue' states, but also in some very populated states traditionally 'red', like Texas, which were projected safe for Trump.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-trump-could-win-the-white-house-while-losing-the-popular-vote/ |title=How Trump Could Win The White House While Losing The Popular Vote |last=Wasserman |first=David |date=September 15, 2016 |newspaper=FiveThirtyEight|access-date=February 17, 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nEarly exit polls generally favored Clinton.<ref name=frankluntz/> After the polls closed and some of the results came in, the forecasts were found to be inaccurate, as Trump performed better in the competitive Midwestern states, such as [[Iowa]], [[Ohio]], and [[Minnesota]], than expected.

The Russian intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army (GRU) carried out these operations. In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks. Around the time that the DNC announced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government's role in hacking its network, the GRU began disseminating stolen materials through the fictitious online personas \"DCLeaks\" and \"Guccifer 2.0.\" The GRU later released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks.</ref>\n\nTo establish whether a crime was committed by members of the Trump campaign with regard to Russian interference, the special counsel's investigators \"applied the framework of [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy law]]\", and not the concept of \"collusion\", because collusion \"is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Morais |first1=Betsy |title=Collusion by any other name |url=https://www.cjr.org/first_person/trump-mueller-collusion.php |date=April 18, 2019 |work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] |access-date=April 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol. I, p. 2: In evaluating whether evidence about the collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of \"collusion.\" In so doing, the Office recognized that the word \"collud[e]\" was used in communications with the Acting Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation's scope and that the term has frequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons, the Office's focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law.</ref> They also investigated if members of the Trump campaign \"coordinated\" with Russia, using the definition of \"coordination\" as having \"an agreement\u2014tacit or express\u2014between the Trump campaign and the Russian government on election interference\". Investigators further elaborated that merely having \"two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests\" was not enough to establish coordination.<!-- ref name=NYTcompare/ --><ref>''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol.

Like collusion, \"coordination\" does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood coordination to require an agreement\u2014tacit or express\u2014between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests. We applied the term coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.</ref>\n\nThe Mueller Report writes that the investigation \"identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign\", found that Russia \"perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency\" and that the 2016 Trump presidential campaign \"expected it would benefit electorally\" from Russian hacking efforts. Ultimately, \"the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities\".<ref name=\"GlobeGraphic\">{{Cite web |last1=Ostriker |first1=Rebecca |last2=Puzzanghera |first2=Jim |last3=Finucane |first3=Martin |last4=Datar |first4=Saurabh |last5=Uraizee |first5=Irfan |last6=Garvin |first6=Patrick |title=What the Mueller report says about Trump and more |url=https://apps.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/graphics/2019/03/mueller-report/ |website=[[The Boston Globe]] |access-date=April 22, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"TIMErelease\">{{cite magazine |last1=Law |first1=Tara |title=Here Are the Biggest Takeaways From the Mueller Report |url=http://time.com/5567077/mueller-report-release/ |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=April 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\nHowever, investigators had an incomplete picture of what had really occurred during the 2016 campaign, due to some associates of Trump campaign providing either false, incomplete or declined testimony, as well as having deleted, unsaved or encrypted communications.

The study points out that since the 1980s, the advancement of technology has often led to a significant fraction of the workforce being worse off. Low skilled workers affected by [[Technological unemployment|technology driven job displacement]] had to replace their middle-income jobs with lower-income service jobs, or were pushed out of the workforce altogether, while the advancement of technology increased the demand for high-income jobs among skilled workers. Frey and his co-authors note a positive trend between automation driven income inequality and the movement toward [[political polarization]] in the United States. The study found a strong correlation between areas affected by technological automation and the increase of support for Donald Trump among low-skilled workers in the affected voting districts, concluding that:<blockquote>While the Computer Revolution has not rendered the workforce redundant, a large share of Americans have lost the race to technology, which is reflected in the reallocation of millions of workers from middle-income jobs to low-income occupations or non-employment as their jobs have been automated away{{nbsp}}... the victims of the Computer Revolution have a higher propensity to opt for radical political change: electoral districts with a higher share of jobs exposed to automation were significantly more likely to support Trump. The 2016 U.S. Presidential Election can thus be described as a riot against machines by democratic means.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Frey|first=Carl Benedikt|last2=Berger|first2=Thor|last3=Chen|first3=Chinchih|date=July 23, 2017|title=Political Machinery: Automation Anxiety and the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election|url=https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/Political%20Machinery-Automation%20Anxiety%20and%20the%202016%20U_S_%20Presidential%20Election_230712.pdf}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Candidates table ===\n\n<!-- This table is sorted by pledged electors first (that is, ignoring faithless electors), then by popular vote among candidates with 0 pledged electors. -->\n{{start U.S. presidential ticket box|pv_footnote=|ev_footnote=}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan|name=[[Donald Trump]]|party=[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]|state=[[New York (state)|New York]]|pv= 62,984,828 |pv_pct= 46.09% |ev-projected=306|ev=304 (306)|vp_count=1|vp_name=[[Mike Pence]]|vp_party=[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]|vp_state=[[Indiana]]|vp_ev=304}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan|name=[[Hillary Clinton]]|party=[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]|state=[[New York (state)|New York]]|pv= 65,853,514 |pv_pct= 48.18% |ev-projected=232|ev=227 (232)|vp_count=1|vp_name=[[Tim Kaine]]|vp_party=[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]|vp_state=[[Virginia]]|vp_ev=227}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Gary Johnson]]| party=[[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]]| state=[[New Mexico]]| pv= 4,489,341 | pv_pct= 3.28% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Bill Weld]]| vp_party=[[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]]| vp_state=[[Massachusetts]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Jill Stein]]| party=[[Green Party of the United States|Green]]| state=[[Massachusetts]]| pv= 1,457,218 | pv_pct= 1.07% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Ajamu Baraka]]| vp_party=[[Green Party (United States)|Green]]| vp_state=[[Illinois]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row| name=[[Evan McMullin]]| party=[[Independent politician|Independent]]| state=[[Utah]]| pv= 731,991 | pv_pct= 0.54% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Mindy Finn]]| vp_party=[[Independent politician|Independent]]| vp_state=[[District of Columbia]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row| name=[[Darrell Castle]]|| party=[[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution]]| state=[[Tennessee]]| pv= 203,090 | pv_pct= 0.15% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Scott Bradley (politician)|Scott Bradley]]| vp_party=[[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution]]| vp_state=[[Utah]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan| name=[[Bernie Sanders]]{{efn|name=faithless}}| party=[[Independent politician|Independent]]| state=[[Vermont]]| pv= 111,850 {{efn|name=write-in}}| pv_pct= 0.08% {{efn|name=write-in}}| ev-projected=0| ev=1 (0)| vp_count=1| vp_name=[[Elizabeth Warren]]{{efn|name=faithless}}|vp_party=[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]| vp_state=[[Massachusetts]]| vp_ev=1}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Gloria La Riva]]|party=[[Party for Socialism and Liberation|Socialism and Liberation]]|state=[[California]]| pv= 74,401 | pv_pct= 0.05% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Eugene Puryear]]|vp_party=[[Party for Socialism and Liberation|Socialism and Liberation]]| vp_state=[[District of Columbia]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan| name=[[John Kasich]]{{efn|name=faithless}}{{efn|name=paul-kasich|Two faithless electors from Texas cast their presidential votes for Ron Paul and John Kasich, respectively.

However, FiveThirtyEight's model pointed to the possibility of an Electoral College-popular vote split widening in the final weeks based on Trump's improvement in swing states like Florida or Pennsylvania. This was due to the demographics targeted by Trump's campaign which lived in big numbers there, in addition to Clinton's poor performance in several of those swing states in comparison with Obama's performance in 2012, as well as having a big number of her potential voters in very populated traditionally 'blue' states, but also in some very populated states traditionally 'red', like Texas, which were projected safe for Trump.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-trump-could-win-the-white-house-while-losing-the-popular-vote/ |title=How Trump Could Win The White House While Losing The Popular Vote |last=Wasserman |first=David |date=September 15, 2016 |newspaper=FiveThirtyEight|access-date=February 17, 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nEarly exit polls generally favored Clinton.<ref name=frankluntz/> After the polls closed and some of the results came in, the forecasts were found to be inaccurate, as Trump performed better in the competitive Midwestern states, such as [[Iowa]], [[Ohio]], and [[Minnesota]], than expected.

Ecuador, featuring stars such as Washington Mu\u00f1oz, [[Alberto Spencer]], [[Carlos Alberto Raffo]], Enrique Raymondi and Jorge Bola\u00f1os, forced a play-off in [[Peru]] before being eliminated by Chile. Other talented players to have represented Ecuador include [[Jos\u00e9 Villafuerte]] in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nThe [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|1998 World Cup qualifiers]] saw the format for qualifying in [[CONMEBOL]] changed to a league home-and-away system. This difference made a huge impact on Ecuador's performance as they clinched several important home wins during the campaign. At the end, they achieved a very respectable 6th-place finish, just under [[Peru national football team|Peru]] and [[Chile national football team|Chile]] (which qualified by goal differential). The campaign also marked the emergence of several players, such as [[Agust\u00edn Delgado]], [[\u00c1lex Aguinaga]], [[Iv\u00e1n Hurtado]], [[Ulises de la Cruz]] and [[Iv\u00e1n Kaviedes]], who would set the stage for Ecuador's achievements in the next decade.\n\nThis remained the closest they had come to appearing in a finals until the [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|qualification tournament for the 2002 FIFA World Cup]] in [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]]. Led by [[Colombia]]n born manager [[Hern\u00e1n Dar\u00edo G\u00f3mez]], they finished second to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], and one point ahead of [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] who went on to win the World Cup. [[Agust\u00edn Delgado]], with 9 goals, finished joint top scorer in qualifying with [[Hern\u00e1n Crespo]] of [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]. They were drawn into Group G with [[Italy national football team|Italy]], [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] and [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]]. Although they were knocked out at the group stage, they achieved a 1\u20130 victory over [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], who had come third at the previous edition of the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]].\n\nA disappointing showing at the [[2004 Copa Am\u00e9rica]] in [[Peru]] led to the resignation of G\u00f3mez, who was replaced by another [[Colombia]]n, [[Luis Fernando Su\u00e1rez]]. He led them successfully through the latter stages of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|qualification process for the 2006 FIFA World Cup]], finishing third to make the finals. In Germany, they were drawn into Group A with [[German national football team|the hosts]], [[Poland national football team|Poland]], and [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]]. Wins over Poland and Costa Rica earned ''La Tri'' qualification to the knockout stages for the first time.\n\nAnother disappointing showing at yet another [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]] in 2007 and three successive defeats in the beginning of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|2010 World Cup qualifying campaign]] led to the end of Suarez's time in the national team. He was replaced in 2008 for [[Sixto Vizuete]], who had previously gained recognition for winning the [[Football at the 2007 Pan American Games \u2013 Men's tournament|2007 Pan American Games]] with the U-18s. Vizuete became one of the few Ecuadorians to coach the U-23 national team, and senior team, but Ecuador finished the qualifying campaign for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in 6th place, being eliminated from the finals for the first time since [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]]. They managed to turn it around in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|2014 World Cup qualifying campaign]] where they finished in the top 4, enough to record a third World Cup appearance. On Friday, 6 December 2013 they were drawn into a balanced group compromising of top seeds, [[Switzerland]], former champions [[France]], and minnows [[Honduras]].\n\n==Competitive record==\n===FIFA

(soccer)|Canada Cup]]}}\n{{MedalGold|'''1999 Canada Cup'''|NA}}\n{{MedalCompetition|[[Korea Cup]]}}\n{{MedalGold|'''1995 Korea Cup'''|NA}}\n}}\n\nThe '''Ecuador national football team''' ({{lang-es|Selecci\u00f3n de f\u00fatbol de Ecuador}}) represents [[Ecuador]] in men's international [[association football|football]] and is controlled by the [[Ecuadorian Football Federation]] (Federaci\u00f3n Ecuatoriana de F\u00fatbol). They play their home matches at the [[Estadio Ol\u00edmpico Atahualpa]] in [[Quito]].\n\nEcuador has qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]] three times, in [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]], [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] and [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]]. Their best performance came in 2006 when they advanced to the Round of 16, where they were eventually eliminated by [[England national football team|England]]. They are one of two countries in South America not to have won the [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]], the other being [[Venezuela national football team|Venezuela]]. Their best performance in the continental tournament was fourth in [[1959 South American Championship (Ecuador)|1959]] and [[1993 Copa Am\u00e9rica|1993]], both times on home soil.\n\n==History==\nFrom a historical viewpoint, Ecuador have been one of the more struggling footballing nations in South America. Despite their past irregularities, however, Ecuador has risen to be a serious South American competitor in recent years.\n\nDiscarding an invitation to participate in the inaugural [[1930 FIFA World Cup]] held in [[Uruguay]], their first participation in a World Cup qualifying campaign was in the [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962]] campaign, eventually being well beaten by [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] over two games. However, the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]] qualifying campaign pitted the side, regarded as one of the finest teams Ecuador has ever produced, against 1962 hosts and third-place finishers [[Chile national football team|Chile]] and a weakened [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] side. Ecuador, featuring stars such as Washington Mu\u00f1oz, [[Alberto Spencer]], [[Carlos Alberto Raffo]], Enrique Raymondi and Jorge Bola\u00f1os, forced a play-off in [[Peru]] before being eliminated by Chile. Other talented players to have represented Ecuador include [[Jos\u00e9 Villafuerte]] in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nThe [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|1998 World Cup qualifiers]] saw the format for qualifying in [[CONMEBOL]] changed to a league home-and-away system. This difference made a huge impact on Ecuador's performance as they clinched several important home wins during the campaign. At the end, they achieved a very respectable 6th-place finish, just under [[Peru national football team|Peru]] and [[Chile national football team|Chile]] (which qualified by goal differential). The campaign also marked the emergence of several players, such as [[Agust\u00edn Delgado]], [[\u00c1lex Aguinaga]], [[Iv\u00e1n Hurtado]], [[Ulises de la Cruz]] and [[Iv\u00e1n Kaviedes]], who would set the stage for Ecuador's achievements in the next decade.\n\nThis remained the closest they had come to appearing in a finals until the [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|qualification tournament for the 2002 FIFA World Cup]] in [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]]. Led by [[Colombia]]n born manager [[Hern\u00e1n Dar\u00edo G\u00f3mez]], they finished second to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], and one point ahead of [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] who went on to win the World Cup. [[Agust\u00edn Delgado]], with 9 goals, finished joint top scorer in qualifying with [[Hern\u00e1n Crespo]] of [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]. They were drawn into Group G with [[Italy national football team|Italy]], [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] and [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]]. Although they were knocked out at the group stage, they achieved a 1\u20130 victory over [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], who had come third at the previous edition of the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]].\n\nA disappointing showing at the [[2004 Copa Am\u00e9rica]] in [[Peru]] led to the resignation of G\u00f3mez, who was replaced by another [[Colombia]]n, [[Luis Fernando Su\u00e1rez]]. He led them successfully through the latter stages of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|qualification process for the 2006 FIFA World Cup]], finishing third to make the finals. In Germany, they were drawn into Group A with [[German national football team|the hosts]], [[Poland national football team|Poland]], and [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]]. Wins over Poland and Costa Rica earned ''La Tri'' qualification to the knockout stages for the first time.\n\nAnother disappointing showing at yet another [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]] in 2007 and three successive defeats in the beginning of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|2010 World Cup qualifying campaign]] led to the end of Suarez's time in the national team. He was replaced in 2008 for [[Sixto Vizuete]], who had previously gained recognition for winning the [[Football at the 2007 Pan American Games \u2013 Men's tournament|2007 Pan American Games]] with the U-18s. Vizuete became one of the few Ecuadorians to coach the U-23 national team, and senior team, but Ecuador finished the qualifying campaign for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in 6th place, being eliminated from the finals for the first time since [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]]. They managed to turn it around in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|2014 World Cup qualifying campaign]] where they finished in the top 4, enough to record a third World Cup appearance. On Friday, 6 December 2013 they were drawn into a balanced group compromising of top seeds, [[Switzerland]], former champions [[France]], and minnows [[Honduras]].\n\n==Competitive record==\n===FIFA

The [[flower]] is variable, golden yellow to cream or pale lavender to deep blue-purple, generally with darker veins. The flower stems are usually short (less than 25&nbsp;cm) when in the sun and bear 2 flowers. It blooms in spring.\n\n==Uses==\nUsed as a source of fiber by  [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].  The fiber was used for fish nets, deer snares and other items.\n\nIt is also cultivated as an [[ornamental plant]], where it prefers dry summer dormancy, with good drainage.\n\n== References ==\n*[http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/get_JM_treatment.pl?Iris+macrosiphon Jepson Flora Project: ''Iris macrosiphon'']\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20041106152130/http://www.itis.usda.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search_value=43220 ITIS 43220]\n*[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=242101709 Flora of North America:]\n*[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=IRMA USDA: Plants Profile:]\n*[http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/cgi/img_query?text_only=0&display1=image+ID+num&where-calrecnum=4355 Images from the CalPhotos archive:]\n*Harlow, Nora, Jakob, Kristin, and Raiche, Roger (2003) ''Wild Lilies, Irises, and Grasses''.
