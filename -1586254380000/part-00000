A chibi series is set to be released in 2020.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nAs the grandmaster who founded the Demonic Sect (Chinese: Mo Dao Zu Shi), Wei Wuxian roamed the world in his wanton ways, hated by millions for the chaos he created. In the end, he was backstabbed by his dearest Shidi (meaning \"junior fellow brother\") and killed by the vicious ghosts he controlled when powerful clans attacked his stronghold to overpower him. After 13 years, He incarnates into the body of a lunatic called Mo Xuanyu, who was abandoned by his clan and bullied by his family, therefore sacrificing his own body to the Mo Dao Zu Shi for the power to pay back. After the revenge for the owner of his body is done, Wei Wuxian (with the appearance of Mo Xuanyu) is unwillingly taken away by a famous cultivator among the clans\u2014Lan Wangji, his former classmate.\n\nThe time changes to 20 years in the past. Wei Wuxian is introduced as an innocent, talented young master. This marks the start of a thrilling yet hilarious journey of attacking monsters, solving mysteries, and raising children. From the mutual flirtation along the way, Wei Wuxian slowly realizes that Lan Wangji, a seemingly haughty and indifferent poker-face, holds more feelings for Wei Wuxian than he is letting on.\n\nBut they will soon face tragedy and war. They will be forced to make choices with disastrous consequences, and Wei Wuxian starts experimenting with the forbidden, dangerous Demonic cultivation path.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{Main|List of Mo Dao Zu Shi episodes}}\n{{Series overview\n| color1     = #224488\n| link1      =   \n| episodes1  = 15 \n| start1     = {{Start date|2018|7|9}}\n| end1       = {{End date|2018|10|6}}\n\n| color2     = #228888\n| link2      = \n| episodes2  = 8\n| start2     = {{Start date|2019|8|3}}\n| end2       = {{End date|2019|10|05}}\n}}\n\n==Characters==\n\n=== Main characters ===\n'''Wei Ying''' ({{zh|c=\u9b4f\u5a74|p=W\u00e8i Y\u012bng|s=|t=}}), [[courtesy name]] Wuxian ({{zh|c=|p=W\u00faxi\u00e0n|s=\u65e0\u7fa1|t=\u7121\u7fa8}}), thus also known as '''Wei Wuxian''' ({{zh|c=|p=W\u00e8i W\u00faxi\u00e0n|s=\u9b4f\u65e0\u7fa1|t=\u9b4f\u7121\u7fa8}}). \n:Voiced by (Mandarin): [[Zhang Jie (voice actor)|Zhang Jie]] (animation), Lu Zhixing (audio drama \u2013 adult, web series), Ye Zhiqiu (audio drama \u2013 child)\n:Voiced by (Japanese): [[Tatsuhisa Suzuki]] (audio drama)\n:Played by: [[Xiao Zhan]] (adult), Su Yaxin (child)\n\n:Wei Wuxian is the protagonist of the series, born as the only son of Cangse Sanren ({{zh|c=|p=C\u00e1ngs\u00e8 S\u00e0n R\u00e9n|s=\u85cf\u8272\u6563\u4eba|t=\u85cf\u8272\u6563\u4eba}}) and Wei Changze ({{zh|c=|p=W\u00e8i Zh\u01cengz\u00e9|s=\u9b4f\u957f\u6cfd|t=\u9b4f\u9577\u6fa4}}). He is a bright, optimistic, mischievous but good-hearted cultivator, whose intelligence and strength lie more in his ability to invent new spiritual techniques and inventions not defined by conventional cultivation methods. He was a former disciple of the Yunmeng Jiang Sect ({{zh|c=|p=Y\u00fanm\u00e8ng Ji\u0101ng Sh\u00ec|s=\u4e91\u68a6\u6c5f\u6c0f|t=\u96f2\u5922\u6c5f\u6c0f}}) and later created the Demonic Path ({{zh|c=|p=gu\u01d0 d\u00e0o|s=\u9b3c\u9053|t=\u9b3c\u9053}}), thus earning him the title of ''Yiling Patriarch'' ({{zh|c=|p=Y\u00edl\u00edng L\u01ceoz\u01d4|s=\u5937\u9675\u8001\u7956|t=\u5937\u9675\u8001\u7956}}).

He travels with Lan Wangji to solve a curious case of a powerful walking corpse and along the way manages to clear his name.

He is known for his cold, aloof and strict nature. In his youth, he became friends with and fell in love with Wei Wuxian. When Wei Wuxian became the Yiling Patriarch, he often tried to persuade him to stop following the dark arts and attempted to protect him from being murdered by the other cultivation sects, but to no avail. After thirteen years of mourning, he recognized Wei Wuxian in the body of Mo Xuanyu and helped to clear Wei Wuxian's name. The two live alongside each other as cultivation partners.\n\n=== Gusu Lan Sect ===\nThe Gusu Lan Sect ({{zh|c=\u59d1\u82cf\u84dd\u6c0f|p=G\u016bs\u016b L\u00e1n Sh\u00ec|s=|t=}}) is a cultivational sect based in the Cloud Recesses ({{zh|c=|p=Y\u00fansh\u0113nb\u00f9zh\u012bch\u00f9|s=\u4e91\u6df1\u4e0d\u77e5\u5904|t=\u96f2\u6df1\u4e0d\u77e5\u8655}}), a residence on a remote mountain outside the city of Gusu.

Titled as Zewu-Jun ({{zh|c=\u6cfd\u829c\u541b|p=Z\u00e9w\u00fa-j\u016bn|s=|t=|l=}}), he is one of the Two Jades of Lan alongside his younger brother, Lan Wangji; and one of the Three Zuns alongside his sworn brothers Jin Guangyao and Nie Mingjue. He has a warm and gentle personality in contrast to Lan Wangji. He is trustful and loyal to others and his kindness is not limited to those of his sect. This is especially shown through his relationship with Jin Guangyao, as he was the only person who did not look down on Jin Guangyao despite his status as the son of a prostitute. However, Lan Xichen does possess a temper and is deeply protective of those he cares for, especially his younger brother. His anger is best seen towards Wei Wuxian, whom he developed a grudge against because Lan Wangji had defended Wei Wuxian and betrayed the Lan sect to protect him. He even refers bitterly to Wei Wuxian as \"the only mistake Lan Wangji made in his life\".\n\n'''Lan Qiren''' ({{zh|c=\u84dd\u542f\u4ec1|p=L\u00e1n Q\u01d0r\u00e9n|s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Liu Cong (animation), Song Ming (audio drama), Zhang Wentian (web series) \n:Voiced by (Japanese): Tarusuke Shingaki (audio drama) \n:Played by: Huang Ziteng\n\n:Lan Qiren is an elder of the Lan Sect known for producing outstanding students, even out of the most hopeless ones. He is the uncle of Lan Xichen and Lan Wangji. Having watched his brother Qingheng-jun ({{zh|c=\u9752\u8605\u541b|p=|s=|t=|l=}}) drive himself into self-destruction over love, he took guardianship of his nephews, teaching them strictly in an effort to prevent them from following their father's footsteps, although Lan Wanji eventually eloped with Wei Wuxian. He is hence infamously known to be a pedantic, stubborn, and strict teacher.\n\n'''Lan Yuan''' ({{zh|c=\u84dd\u613f|p=L\u00e1n Yu\u00e0n|s=|t=}}), [[courtesy name]] Sizhui ({{zh|c=\u601d\u8ffd|p=S\u012bzhu\u012b|s=|t=}}), thus also known as '''Lan Sizhui''' ({{zh|c=\u84dd\u601d\u8ffd|p=L\u00e1n S\u012bzhu\u012b|s=|t=}}).\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Chenzhang Taikang (animation), Qian Wenqing (audio drama \u2013 adult), Yu Shuhan (audio drama \u2013 child), Chen Jinwen (web series) \n:Voiced by (Japanese): [[Y\u016bsuke Kobayashi (voice actor)|Y\u016bsuke Kobayashi]] (audio drama) \n:Played by: Zheng Fanxing (adult), Jiang Yiting (child)\n\n:Lan Sizhui is a disciple of the Lan Sect. He was originally born to the Wen Sect with the name Wen Yuan ({{zh|c=|p=W\u0113n Yu\u00e0n|s=\u6e29\u82d1|t=\u6eab\u82d1}}). He was found by Wei Wuxian among the remains of the Wen Sect who were forced to work in a valley in Yiling. Wei Wuxian then started raising him. After the First Siege of the Burial Mounds, when he was only three years old, he lost both Wei Wuxian and his home. He was later found by Lan Wangji who came searching for Wei Wuxian's remains. But he fell into a high fever and lost all memories of his past. He was then re-named as Lan Yuan, and presumably given the courtesy name Sizhui in the same year that Wei Wuxian returned to the living world. Thirteen years after the First Siege, he is finally reunited with Wei Wuxian and Wen Ning, although he only remembered his past memories much later. In the present setting, he is close friends with Lan Jingyi and Jin Ling.\n\n'''Lan Jingyi''' ({{zh|c=\u84dd\u666f\u4eea|p=L\u00e1n J\u01d0ngy\u00ed|s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Wang Chenguang (animation), Cao Xupeng (audio drama), Liu Kang (web series) \n:Voiced by (Japanese): [[Hiro Shimono]] (audio drama)\n:Played by: Guo Cheng\n\n:Lan Jingyi is a disciple of the Lan Sect. He is short-tempered and dislikes people who don't follow rules and are noisy, even though he is ironically noisy himself when angered. However, despite his prideful nature, he is caring. He will stand up for his friends, even for Wei Wuxian whom he had initially disliked because of his reckless personality. He is close friends with Lan Sizhui and Jin Ling.\n\n=== Lanling Jin Sect ===\nThe Lanling Jin Sect ({{zh|c=|p=L\u00e1nl\u00edng J\u012bn Sh\u00ec|s=\u5170\u9675\u91d1\u6c0f|t=\u862d\u9675\u91d1\u6c0f}}) is a cultivational sect based in Carp Tower, Lanling. The real-life counterpart to the sect's location is [[Lanling County|Lanling]] in [[Shandong]] province.\n\n'''Meng Yao''' ({{zh|c=\u5b5f\u7476|p=M\u00e8ng Y\u00e1o|s=|t=}}), renamed as '''Jin Guangyao''' ({{zh|c=\u91d1\u5149\u7476|p=J\u012bn Gu\u0101ngy\u00e1o|s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Yang Tianxiang (animation), [[Jiang Guangtao]] (audio drama), Su Shangqing (web series) \n:Played by: Zhu Zanjin\n\n:Titled as Lianfang-zun ({{zh|c=|p=Li\u01cenf\u0101ng-z\u016bn|s=\u655b\u82b3\u5c0a|t=\u6b5b\u82b3\u5c0a|l=Hidden Fragrance Lord}}), Jin Guangyao was the leader of the Jin Sect after the death of Jin Guangshan. He was the illegitimate son of Jin Guangshan and uncle to Jin Ling. Due to the power of the Jin Sect before and during his reign, he also became the first Chief Cultivator ({{zh|c=|p=Xi\u0101n D\u016b|s=\u4ed9\u7763|t=\u4ed9\u7763}}), which can be seen as the leader among all cultivation sects. He is also known as one of the Three Zuns alongside his sworn brothers Lan Xichen and Nie Mingjue. He sought greater amounts of power due to the fact he had often been looked down upon due to his status as the son of a prostitute. However, this is with the exception of his sworn brother Lan Xichen, whose kindness was the reason he held Lan Xichen to the highest esteem. He had accomplished many achievements in his life, such as building lookout towers and helping to rebuild the Cloud Recesses' libraries. However, his desire for power had led him to team up with shady characters like Xue Yang to harness the power of the Stygian Tiger Seal ({{zh|c=|p=Y\u012bn H\u01d4 F\u00fa|s=\u9634\u864e\u7b26|t=\u9670\u864e\u7b26}}), which was once deemed too powerful and broken in half to prevent any more damage. He also murdered anyone who got in his way, including his father, brother, wife, son, master, and friend. His murdering of Nie Mingjue led Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji to solve the mystery of a particular fierce corpse, which turned out to be Nie Mingjue. In the end, when his deeds were revealed, everyone quickly turned against him and Nie Huaisang tricked Lan Xichen into murdering him.\n\n'''Jin Guangshan''' ({{zh|c=\u91d1\u5149\u5584|p=J\u012bn Gu\u0101ngsh\u00e0n|s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Li Longbin (animation), Xiao Tan (audio drama), Yang Mo (web series) \n:Played by: Shen Xiaohai \n\n:Jin Guangshan was the former leader of the Jin Sect who had many illegitimate children, among them are Jin Guangyao and Mo Xuanyu.

He is the son of Jiang Yanli and Jin Zixuan, and the nephew of both Jin Guangyao and Jiang Cheng. He is currently taken care of by Jiang Cheng. He is the only living, legitimate child of the Jin Sect, therefore he will inherit the sect leader position after Jin Guangyao. He owns a spiritual dog which he had named as Fairy, which was given to him by Jin Guangyao. He is prideful and short-tempered, which caused him difficulty getting along with his peers and he doesn't have many friends his age. Although he became who he is due to his life circumstances, he is still kind at heart and strives to become a better person. He is close friends with Lan Sizhui and Lan Jingyi.\n\n'''Jin Zixuan''' ({{zh|c=\u91d1\u5b50\u8f69|p= J\u012bn Zixu\u0101n|s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Gu Jiangshan (animation), Liu Mingyue (audio drama), Shi Zekun (web series) \n:Voiced by (Japanese): [[Hiroki Takahashi]] (audio drama)\n:Played by: Cao Yuchen \n\n:Jin Zixuan was Jiang Yanli's husband and the father of Jin Ling. He was Jin Guangshan's only legitimate child. He was arrogant and had no issue insulting Jiang Yanli while her brothers were in range to hear. However, he was shown to have a sense of justice, shown by his willingness to stand up to Wen Chao when the latter ordered them to seize Mianmian to be sacrificed in order to lure a monster, protecting her alongside Lan Wangji even though he knew his actions would bear consequences. \n\n'''Qin Su''' ({{zh|c=\u79e6\u612b|p= Q\u00edn S\u00f9|s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Ye Zhiqiu (audio drama)\n:Played by: Jin Luying\n\n:Qin Su was the legal wife of Jin Guangyao. She was the daughter of Qin Cangye, the leader of the Laoling Qin Sect, a subsidiary of the Jin Sect. After Jin Guangyao saved her life during the Sunshot Campaign ({{zh|c=|p=Sh\u00e8r\u00eczh\u012bzh\u0113ng|s=\u5c04\u65e5\u4e4b\u5f81|t=\u5c04\u65e5\u4e4b\u5f81}}), she fell in love with him and did not give up until they were married. She then became Jin Guangyao's official wife and the mistress of Carp Tower. It is revealed that she was actually one of Jin Guangshan's illegitimate children as Jin Guangshan once raped her mother while he was drunk. But because Qin Cangye was an advent supporter of Jin Guangshan, her mother could not tell him. When her mother told Jin Guangyao the truth that he and Qin Su were siblings, Qin Su was already pregnant. Jin Guangyao still married her to not lose the support of her stepfather and Jin Guangshan. When their son was around three, Jin Guangyao murdered him as one of his plans to rise up to the Chief Cultivator title. After learning of this secret, she committed suicide in front of a crowd of people the night of the Discussion Conference hosted at Carp Tower.\n\n'''Mo Xuanyu''' ({{zh|c=\u83ab\u7384\u7fbd|p= M\u00f2 Xu\u00e1ny\u01d4|s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): [[Zhang Jie (voice actor)|Zhang Jie]] (animation), Tong Yin (audio drama)\n:Voiced by (Japanese): Nakayama Kazuhisa (audio drama)\n:Played by: [[Xiao Zhan]]\n\n:Mo Xuanyu was one of Jin Guangshan's illegitimate sons and a former disciple of the Jin Sect. He sacrificed his soul to summon Wei Wuxian to exact revenge on the Mo family on his behalf. In his living days and even during Wei Wuxian's possession of his body, he was described as a lunatic. In his past, he was tortured with meeting the expectations of his servant mother to gain recognition of his father. He was then sent to Jin Sect to learn cultivation, but was cast out after harassing Jin Guangyao, as he is a cut-sleeve (homosexual). He returned to Mo Village and his mother died soon after, leaving him in the care of his abusive aunt, Mistress Mo, and her son, Mo Ziyuan ({{zh|c=|p=M\u00f2 Z\u01d0yu\u0101n|s=\u83ab\u5b50\u6e0a|t=\u83ab\u5b50\u6df5}}).

He is known as one of the Three Zuns alongside his sworn brothers Jin Guangyao and Lan Xichen. Nie Mingjue's personality was defined by strictness, a bad temper and an intolerance for anything deviating from the moral good. While this attitude won him acclaim and reputation, the shift in power towards the Jin Sect after the Sunshot Campaign also marked him as a great opposition to their power. Furthermore, as the trademark cultivation of his sect affected his temper, his intolerance grew and he could not accept that two of his subordinates were killed by Jin Guangyao when they were captured with him and brought before Wen Ruohan in Nightless City. This was despite Jin Guangyao pointing out that Nie Mingjue himself would have died if they did not, since all three had offended Wen Ruohan. He was murdered by Jin Guangyao and turned into a fierce corpse.\n\n'''Nie Huaisang''' ({{zh|c=\u8042\u6000\u6851|p= Ni\u00e8 Hu\u00e1is\u0101ng|s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Liu Sanmu (animation), Qi Sijia (audio drama), Ji Li (web series) \n:Voiced by (Japanese): [[Yoshitsugu Matsuoka]] (audio drama)\n:Played by: Ji Li \n\n:Nie Huaisang is the current leader of the Nie Sect and the younger half-brother of Nie Mingjue.

He was pegged by Wei Wuxian to be the mastermind behind the events around his summoning and the chain of events which subsequently led to the death of Jin Guangyao at the hands of Lan Xichen.\n\n=== Qishan Wen Sect ===\nThe Qishan Wen Sect ({{zh|c=\u5c90\u5c71\u6e29\u6c0f|p=Q\u00edsh\u0101n W\u0113n Sh\u00ec|s=|t=}}) is a cultivational sect based in the Nightless City.

He accused the Lan Sect of some wrongdoing and forced them to burn down the Cloud Recesses under the guise of cleansing the place so that it could be \"reborn from the firelight\". Eventually, he was decapitated by Nie Mingjue, with his head hung up as a demonstration to the Wen Sect's cultivators, and his body cut into pieces and ground up by the cultivators of the Nie Sect.\n\n'''Wen Chao''' ({{zh|c=\u6e29\u6641|p= W\u0113n Ch\u00e1o|s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Liang Xiaoqiang (animation), Hao Xianghai (audio drama), Wen Jingyuan (web series) \n:Played by: He Peng\n\n:Wen Chao was the youngest son of Wen Ruohan and leader of the Wen Sect. He enjoyed looking at ladies even though he had a wife, to the point of harassing them. One instance was with Mianmian, which ended with Wei Wuxian saving her by diverting his attention to fake erotic arts. Because of his and Wen Ruohan's malicious intent, they caused great destruction to the Lan Sect and Jiang Sect by destroying their residences and killing the entire Jiang Sect, except the three children who went into hiding. He was also responsible for throwing Wei Wuxian into the Burial Mounds, which resulted in his own death when Wei Wuxian returned to end his clan with his newfound demonic abilities.\n\n'''Wen Qing''' ({{zh|c=\u6e29\u60c5|p= W\u0113n Q\u00edng|s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Qiao Shiyu (animation, web series), Shan Xin (audio drama)\n:Played by: [[Meng Ziyi]] (adult), Lin Chenxi (child) \n\n:Wen Qing was a member of the Wen sect and Wen Ning's older sister.

He was more commonly known as Core-Melting Hand ({{zh|c=\u5316\u4e39\u624b|p=Hu\u0101d\u0101n sh\u01d2u|s=|t=}}) due to his ability to melt a Golden Core, which stores and controls a cultivator's spiritual energy. He was responsible for melting away Jiang Cheng's Golden Core when he was captured by the Wen Sect during hiding. Along with Wen Chao, he died in Wei Wuxian's hands.\n\n'''Wang Lingjiao''' ({{zh|c=\u738b\u7075\u5a07|p=W\u00e1ng L\u00edngji\u0101o|s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Qiu Qiu (animation, web series), Yan Mengmeng (audio drama)\n:Played by: Lu Enjie\n\n:Wang Lingjiao was a former maid of Wen Chao's principal wife and later his lover. Despite only achieving her status by engaging in sexual activities with Wen Chao, she was arrogant and pompous. She also guarded her status as Wen Chao's favorite, and did her best to eliminate any competition, like volunteering Mianmian as a sacrifice when she witnessed Wen Chao flirting with her. She died in Wei Wuxian's hands, and later became a fierce corpse where she turned against Wen Chao in an attempt to kill him.\n\n=== Yunmeng Jiang Sect ===\nThe Yunmeng Jiang Sect ({{zh|c=\u4e91\u68a6\u6c5f\u6c0f|p=Y\u00fanm\u00e8ng Ji\u0101ng Sh\u00ec|s=|t=}}) is a cultivational sect located in Yunmeng's Lotus Pier. The current leader is Jiang Cheng. The real-life counterpart to the sect's location is [[Yunmeng County|Yunmeng]] in [[Hubei]] province.\n\n'''Jiang Fengmian''' ({{zh|c=\u6c5f\u67ab\u7720|p=Ji\u0101ng F\u0113ngmi\u00e1n|s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Tang Shuiyu (animation, web series), Zhang Zhen (audio drama)\n:Played by: Lu Jianmin \n\n:Jiang Fengmian was the former leader of the Jiang Sect. He was the husband of Yu Ziyuan and the father of Jiang Cheng and Jiang Yanli. He was friends with Wei Wuxian's father, Wei Changze, who was a servant of the sect. He was also familiar with Wei Wuxian's mother, Cangse Sanren, and it was rumored that he was in love with her. When he heard that both parents had died on a night-hunt, he dedicated himself to finding their son. He eventually found Wei Wuxian on the streets of Yiling and fed him a piece of melon before carrying him home to Yunmeng. Because of his treatment to Wei Wuxian which was seen as better than how he treated his own son, he and his wife often argued. Along with his wife, he died in Wen Sect's hands during their invasion of the Lotus Pier.\n\n'''Jiang Cheng''' ({{zh|c=\u6c5f\u6f84|p=Ji\u0101ng Ch\u00e9ng|s=|t=}}), [[courtesy name]] Wanyin ({{zh|c=\u665a\u541f|p=W\u01ceny\u00edn|s=|t=}}), thus also known as '''Jiang Wanyin''' ({{zh|c=\u6c5f\u665a\u541f|p=Ji\u0101ng W\u01ceny\u00edn|s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Guo Haoran (animation), Peng Yao (audio drama), Wang Kai (web series) \n:Voiced by (Japanese): [[Hikaru Midorikawa]] (audio drama)\n:Played by: Wang Zhuocheng (adult), Huang Zhenchen (child) \n\n:Jiang Cheng is the current leader of the Jiang Sect.

He is a straight-laced and strict man who abides by the rules. He has a deep care for his family and friends and knows to respect his elders. At the beginning, he had a good relationship with Wei Wuxian, despite the latter often annoying him with his mischief. However, his hatred for the Wen Sect caused a great strain in their relationship. This eventually became pure hatred when Wen Ning accidentally killed his brother-in-law (Jin Zixuan) and his sister died while protecting Wei Wuxian. However, ultimately, he gives up this hatred after learning how Wei Wuxian had sacrificed his Golden Core for him. Though despite all these, he still loves his nephew Jin Ling, and acts in a strict manner like his mother had did to him as a child.\n\n'''Jiang Yanli''' ({{zh|c=\u6c5f\u538c\u79bb|p=Ji\u0101ng Y\u00e0nl\u00ed|s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Li Shimeng (animation), Qiao Shiyu (audio drama), Bai Xuecen (web series) \n:Played by: [[Lulu Xuan|Xuan Lu]] (adult), Ye Xuantong (child)\n\n:Jiang Yanli was the daughter of Jiang Fengmian and Yu Ziyuan, and older sister of Jiang Cheng and Wei Wuxian. She was a very kind person who would always protect her younger brothers and offer them emotional support. She had an arranged marriage with Jin Zixuan as their mothers were very close. But she did not like Jin Zixuan at first, and was even mocked at by him for being average. The engagement was called off until Jin Zixuan realised his mistake and pursued her again. They were then blessed with a son, Jin Ling, but were unable to raise him for long as they died in the hands of Wen Ning.\n\n'''Yu Ziyuan''' ({{zh|c=\u865e\u7d2b\u9e22|p=Y\u00fa Z\u01d0yu\u0101n|s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Ji Guanlin (animation), Zhang Kai (audio drama), Li Jinyan (web series) \n:Played by: Zhang Jingtong \n\n:Yu Ziyuan was the wife of Jiang Fengmian, and mother of Jiang Cheng and Jiang Yanli. She had a cold and assertive personality which did not come off as likeable. Titled Madam Yu ({{zh|c=\u865e\u592b\u4eba|p=Y\u00fa f\u016br\u00e9n|s=|t=}}) and Violet Spider ({{zh|c=\u7d2b\u8718\u86db|p=Z\u01d0 Zh\u012bzh\u016b|s=|t=}}), she was a formidable cultivator whose name alone could scare quite a few people away.

She obliged to whip him with Zidian when Wang Lingjiao demanded him to be punished. However, she showed some care towards Wei Wuxian when she did not chop off his hand despite Wang Lingjiao's demands. Along with her husband, she died in Wen Sect's hands during their invasion of the Lotus Pier. During her final moments, she told Wei Wuxian to protect Jiang Cheng with his life.\n\n=== Yi City Arc ===\nDuring Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji's mission, they arrived at Yi City ({{zh|c=\u4e49\u57ce|p=Y\u00ec ch\u00e9ng|s=|t=}}) and bumped into Lan Sizhui, Lan Jingyi, Jin Ling and some other disciples from different sects during their night hunt. From there, they uncover the truth of Xiao Xingchen's death and found the missing right arm for the mission.\n\n'''Xiao Xingchen''' ({{zh|c=\u6653\u661f\u5c18|p=Xi\u01ceo X\u012bngch\u00e9n|s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Chen Hao (audio drama), Chenzhang Taikang (web series) \n:Played by: Song Jiyang\n\n:Also known as Daozhang ({{zh|c=\u9053\u957f|p=D\u00e0ozh\u00e1ng|s=|t=}}), Xiao Xingchen was one of Baoshan Sanren's ({{zh|c=\u62b1\u5c71\u6563\u4eba}}) students who left the mountain for the mortal world. He and his best friend Song Lan were once called \"the bright moon and cold breeze Xiao Xingchen, the distant snow and cold frost Song Zichen\" ({{zh|c=\u660e\u6708\u6e05\u98ce\u6653\u661f\u5c18\uff0c\u50b2\u96ea\u51cc\u971c\u5b8b\u5b57\u741b}}). He first met A-Qing who was in the midst of using her fake blindness to steal money, and the latter started following him around. After finding an injured person lying unconscious on the street, later revealed to be Xue Yang, the three of them started living in an uninhabited coffin house. During their time here, he once told them stories about some of Baoshan Sanren's disciples, including Wei Wuxian's parents. Throughout the years, he went on night-hunts with Xue Yang, unknowingly killing innocent people who were put under Corpse Poisoning by the latter.  After finding out the truth about Xue Yang's identity from A-Qing, he told her to run away while he confronted Xue Yang. However, the truth of him unintentionally killing Song Lan put him in great misery, hence he committed suicide. As this method of death caused his soul to be shattered, Xue Yang was unable to turn him into a fierce corpse. Not willing to let him go, Xue Yang stored his soul in a spirit-trapping pouch, which was later presented to Wei Wuxian when he sought his help to restore it. At the end, after hearing A-Qing's story, the disciples cried and mourned over their deaths while they burned incense money for him and A-Qing right outside Yi City.\n\n'''Song Lan''' ({{zh|c=\u5b8b\u5c9a|p=S\u00f2ng L\u00e1n|s=|t=}}), [[courtesy name]] \u5b50\u741b ({{zh|c=\u5b50\u741b|p=Zich\u0113n|s=|t=}}), thus also known as '''Song Zichen''' ({{zh|c=\u5b8b\u5b50\u741b|p=S\u00f2ng Zich\u0113n |s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Wu Lei (audio drama), Lu Lifeng (web series) \n:Played by: Li Bowen\n\n:Song Lan was a cultivator from Baixue Temple, and best friend of Xiao Xingchen. He was described by Xiao Xingchen to be \"a man with strong sense of righteousness\". He and Xiao Xingchen were once called \"the bright moon and cold breeze Xiao Xingchen, the distant snow and cold frost Song Zichen\". He once had his eyes blinded and poisoned by Xue Yang when Baixue Temple was destroyed. But Xiao Xingchen dug out his own eyes and gave them to him after bringing him to Baoshan Sanren's residence and begging her to save him. While searching for Xiao Xingchen after his sudden disappearance, he came across A-Qing who was out playing on her own. A-Qing then helped him get to Xiao Xingchen. When they arrived at the coffin house, he recognised Xue Yang immediately and advised A-Qing to stay away from this matter, although she then followed him secretly. During his fight with Xue Yang, the latter gave him Corpse Poisoning and cut off his tongue, hence he was rendered mute. Xue Yang later tricked Xiao Xingchen into killing him. In his final moments, he did not make a sound as he did not want to let Xiao Xingchen know it was him. After his death, Xue Yang turned him into a fierce corpse who will obey him, and he was also summoned to fight Wei Wuxian. But Wei Wuxian managed to return his consciousness and gave him the spirit-trapping pouch that contained Xiao Xingchen's and A-Qing's souls. When asked what he would do with Xiao Xingchen's body, he lamented that he would cremate his body, roam the world with Xiao Xingchen's sword Shuanghua ({{zh|c=\u971c\u534e|p=Shu\u0101nghu\u00e1) |s=|t=}} to eliminate evil, and await for his return so he could tell him that this was never his fault.\n\n'''A-Qing''' ({{zh|c=\u963f\u7b90|p=\u0100-q\u012bng|s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Yang Neng (audio drama), He Wenxiao (web series) \n:Played by: Chen Zhuoxuan \n\n:A-Qing was a young maiden who lived on the streets prior to meeting Xiao Xingchen and she was an expert at pretending to be blind. After encountering Xiao Xingchen, she started following him against his will at first, but they eventually started living together in an uninhabited coffin house with Xue Yang. Throughout the years, she was extremely cautious about Xue Yang and protective of Xiao Xingchen, hence she would follow them sometimes, uncovering Xue Yang's secrets in the process. When she witnessed how Xue Yang tricked Xiao Xingchen into killing Song Lan, she immediately decided to bring Xiao Xingchen away to keep him safe. However, Xiao Xingchen told her to run away instead while he confronted Xue Yang himself. As she went around searching for a powerful cultivator to seek revenge for Xiao Xingchen, Xue Yang found her. After continuously insulting Xue Yang in anger, the latter lost his patience and dug out her eyes and cut her tongue, resulting in her death. When Wei Wuxian, Lan Wangji and the disciples arrived at Yi City, as a walking corpse, she kept on warning them about Xue Yang. However, her muteness brought about confusion until Wei Wuxian finally figured out her intentions. To learn more about her story, Wei Wuxian used Empathy, a rite that allows a spirit to use one's body as a medium, allowing oneself to see, feel and hear their memories. After hearing her story, the disciples cried and mourned over her death while they burned incense money for her and Xiao Xingchen right outside Yi City.\n\n'''Xue Yang''' ({{zh|c=\u859b\u6d0b|p=Xu\u0113 Y\u00e1ng|s=|t=}}), [[courtesy name]] \u6210\u7f8e ({{zh|c=\u6210\u7f8e|p=Ch\u00e9ngm\u011bi|s=|t=}}), thus also known as '''Xue Chengmei''' ({{zh|c=\u859b\u6210\u7f8e|p=Xu\u0113 Ch\u00e9ngm\u011bi |s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Hui Long (audio drama), Liu Sanmu (web series) \n:Played by: Wang Haoxuan\n\n:Xue Yang was a guest disciple of the Jin Sect who recreated the other half of the Stygian Tiger Seal. He was found by Xiao Xingchen and A-Qing while he was injured and unconscious on the streets. He was then brought to an uninhabited coffin house where the two tended to his injuries. As the two did not know his real identity, he used Xiao Xingchen's blindness to his advantage and ended up living with them for years through deception. However, he was exposed when A-Qing witnessed his malicious intent. He fought Xiao Xingchen and ultimately revealed the truth, which caused Xiao Xingchen to commit suicide. As Xue Yang was unable to turn him into a fierce corpse, he stored his shattered soul in a spirit-trapping pouch. He later found A-Qing who was seeking revenge, and killed her by digging her eyes and cutting her tongue out. When Wei Wuxian, Lan Wangji and the disciples arrived at Yi City, he pretended to be Xiao Xingchen and tricked them to get himself some alone time with Wei Wuxian. Revealing that he has been searching for the Yiling Patriarch, he then presented Wei Wuxian the spirit-trapping pouch and threatened him to restore it. Wei Wuxian saw through his act and quickly found out he was Xue Yang. The two then got into a fight, and Lan Wangji subsequently took over while Wei Wuxian goes to find A-Qing with the disciples. After knowing the whole truth about the past, Wei Wuxian returned to the battle to aid in killing him. However, he was taken away by the gravedigger in the middle of battle. It was unclear whether he had died, but both Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji believed that his injuries were too serious to be healed.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Tracklist\n| collapsed       = \n| all_writing     = \n| all_lyrics      = \n| all_music       = \n| arranger_credits = yes\n| extra_column = Singers\n\n| title1          = Drunken Dreams of the Past (\u9189\u68a6\u524d\u5c18)\n| note1           = Opening theme song\n| lyrics1         = Sun Yujing\n| music1          = Sun Yujing \n| arranger1       =  Zhong Xingming \n| extra1          =  [[Terry Lin|Lin Zhixuan]] \n| length1         = 04:31 \n\n| title2          =  Asking the Zither (\u95ee\u7434) \n| note2           = Ending theme song (season 1; eps 1\u20138, 14\u201315)\n| lyrics2        =  Sun Yujing\n| music2         =  Sun Yujing, Feng Shuo\n| arranger2      =  Feng Shuo \n| extra2        = Yin Lin \n| length2       = 03:16 \n\n| title3          =No Envies (\u4e0d\u7fa1)\n| note3           = Ending theme song (season 1; eps 9\u201313)\n| lyrics3         = Miao Boyang \n| music3          = He Liang \n| arranger3       =  Zhao Peng \n| extra3          = [[Super Impassioned Net Generation|S.I.N.G]] \n| length3         = 04:28\n\n| title4          =  Unchanging Youth (\u5c11\u5e74\u5982\u6545)\n| note4           = Ending theme song (season 2) \n| lyrics4         = Cheng Yi, He Siwei \n| music4          = Lin Hai\n| arranger4       =  Lin Hai , Seven \n| extra4          = [[R1SE]] \n| length4         = 04:20\n        \n| title5          = Envying Clouds (\u7fa1\u4e91) \n| note5           = Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji's theme song\n| lyrics5         = Sun Yujing\n| music5         = Sun Yujing\n| arranger5       =  Weng Teng \n| extra5          = Hita \n| length5         = 03:00\n\n| title6          = Drunken Dreams of the Past (\u9189\u68a6\u524d\u5c18)\n| note6           =\n| lyrics6         = Sun Yujing\n| music6          = Sun Yujing \n| arranger6       =  Zhong Xingming \n| extra6          =  [[Zhang Jie (voice actor)|Zhang Jie]] & Bian Jiang  \n| length6         = 04:31 \n}} \n\n==Reception==\nThe series received overwhelmingly positive reviews for its high production quality and storyline, and amassed a notable Internet fandom both in China and overseas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ent.ifeng.com/a/20180712/43067782_0.shtml|title=\u9ad8\u6c34\u51c6\u5236\u4f5c\u300a\u9b54\u9053\u7956\u5e08\u300b\u4e3a\u56fd\u6f2b\u590d\u5174\u6ce8\u5165\u65b0\u529b|date=July 12, 2018|website=Phoenix New Media|language=zh}}</ref> Upon its release in China, the series became an instant hit, ultimately generating 1.74 billion views on [[Tencent Video|Tencent's streaming platform]], as of December 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://v.qq.com/x/cover/k4mutekomtrdbux.html|title=Mo Dao Zu Shi official streaming\u9b54\u9053\u7956\u5e08 \u7b2c01\u96c6_1080P\u5728\u7ebf\u89c2\u770b\u5e73\u53f0_\u817e\u8baf\u89c6\u9891|website=Tencent Video|language=zh|access-date=2018-12-20}}</ref> On [[Douban]], ''Mo Dao Zu Shi'' holds a rating of 8.9 out of 10, making it one of the best received [[Chinese animation|donghua]] series of 2018 in China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://movie.douban.com/subject/27015848/|title=\u9b54\u9053\u7956\u5e08 (\u8c46\u74e3)|website=movie.douban.com|access-date=2018-12-27}}</ref> \n\nOutside China, ''Mo Dao Zu Shi'' was officially released by [[Tencent Video|Tencent]] on its official [[YouTube]] channel on August 27, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m346FShZ5Dc|title=\u300aMo Dao Zu Shi\u300b|website=YouTube|accessdate=2019-08-29}}</ref> It was also released by WeTV, a streaming platform for overseas users created by Tencent, under the title of ''The Founder of Diabolism''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wetv.vip/play?cid=r8t02fkxr9jyvvn''|title=The Founder of Diabolism|website=WeTV|accessdate=2019-08-29}}</ref>\n\n===Awards and nominations===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n!

A chibi series is set to be released in 2020.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nAs the grandmaster who founded the Demonic Sect (Chinese: Mo Dao Zu Shi), Wei Wuxian roamed the world in his wanton ways, hated by millions for the chaos he created. In the end, he was backstabbed by his dearest Shidi (meaning \"junior fellow brother\") and killed by the vicious ghosts he controlled when powerful clans attacked his stronghold to overpower him. After 13 years, He incarnates into the body of a lunatic called Mo Xuanyu, who was abandoned by his clan and bullied by his family, therefore sacrificing his own body to the Mo Dao Zu Shi for the power to pay back. After the revenge for the owner of his body is done, Wei Wuxian (with the appearance of Mo Xuanyu) is unwillingly taken away by a famous cultivator among the clans\u2014Lan Wangji, his former classmate.\n\nThe time changes to 20 years in the past. Wei Wuxian is introduced as an innocent, talented young master. This marks the start of a thrilling yet hilarious journey of attacking monsters, solving mysteries, and raising children. From the mutual flirtation along the way, Wei Wuxian slowly realizes that Lan Wangji, a seemingly haughty and indifferent poker-face, holds more feelings for Wei Wuxian than he is letting on.\n\nBut they will soon face tragedy and war.

He was a former disciple of the Yunmeng Jiang Sect ({{zh|c=|p=Y\u00fanm\u00e8ng Ji\u0101ng Sh\u00ec|s=\u4e91\u68a6\u6c5f\u6c0f|t=\u96f2\u5922\u6c5f\u6c0f}}) and later created the Demonic Path ({{zh|c=|p=gu\u01d0 d\u00e0o|s=\u9b3c\u9053|t=\u9b3c\u9053}}), thus earning him the title of ''Yiling Patriarch'' ({{zh|c=|p=Y\u00edl\u00edng L\u01ceoz\u01d4|s=\u5937\u9675\u8001\u7956|t=\u5937\u9675\u8001\u7956}}).

He is known for his cold, aloof and strict nature. In his youth, he became friends with and fell in love with Wei Wuxian. When Wei Wuxian became the Yiling Patriarch, he often tried to persuade him to stop following the dark arts and attempted to protect him from being murdered by the other cultivation sects, but to no avail. After thirteen years of mourning, he recognized Wei Wuxian in the body of Mo Xuanyu and helped to clear Wei Wuxian's name. The two live alongside each other as cultivation partners.\n\n=== Gusu Lan Sect ===\nThe Gusu Lan Sect ({{zh|c=\u59d1\u82cf\u84dd\u6c0f|p=G\u016bs\u016b L\u00e1n Sh\u00ec|s=|t=}}) is a cultivational sect based in the Cloud Recesses ({{zh|c=|p=Y\u00fansh\u0113nb\u00f9zh\u012bch\u00f9|s=\u4e91\u6df1\u4e0d\u77e5\u5904|t=\u96f2\u6df1\u4e0d\u77e5\u8655}}), a residence on a remote mountain outside the city of Gusu.

Titled as Zewu-Jun ({{zh|c=\u6cfd\u829c\u541b|p=Z\u00e9w\u00fa-j\u016bn|s=|t=|l=}}), he is one of the Two Jades of Lan alongside his younger brother, Lan Wangji; and one of the Three Zuns alongside his sworn brothers Jin Guangyao and Nie Mingjue. He has a warm and gentle personality in contrast to Lan Wangji. He is trustful and loyal to others and his kindness is not limited to those of his sect. This is especially shown through his relationship with Jin Guangyao, as he was the only person who did not look down on Jin Guangyao despite his status as the son of a prostitute. However, Lan Xichen does possess a temper and is deeply protective of those he cares for, especially his younger brother. His anger is best seen towards Wei Wuxian, whom he developed a grudge against because Lan Wangji had defended Wei Wuxian and betrayed the Lan sect to protect him. He even refers bitterly to Wei Wuxian as \"the only mistake Lan Wangji made in his life\".\n\n'''Lan Qiren''' ({{zh|c=\u84dd\u542f\u4ec1|p=L\u00e1n Q\u01d0r\u00e9n|s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Liu Cong (animation), Song Ming (audio drama), Zhang Wentian (web series) \n:Voiced by (Japanese): Tarusuke Shingaki (audio drama) \n:Played by: Huang Ziteng\n\n:Lan Qiren is an elder of the Lan Sect known for producing outstanding students, even out of the most hopeless ones. He is the uncle of Lan Xichen and Lan Wangji. Having watched his brother Qingheng-jun ({{zh|c=\u9752\u8605\u541b|p=|s=|t=|l=}}) drive himself into self-destruction over love, he took guardianship of his nephews, teaching them strictly in an effort to prevent them from following their father's footsteps, although Lan Wanji eventually eloped with Wei Wuxian. He is hence infamously known to be a pedantic, stubborn, and strict teacher.\n\n'''Lan Yuan''' ({{zh|c=\u84dd\u613f|p=L\u00e1n Yu\u00e0n|s=|t=}}), [[courtesy name]] Sizhui ({{zh|c=\u601d\u8ffd|p=S\u012bzhu\u012b|s=|t=}}), thus also known as '''Lan Sizhui''' ({{zh|c=\u84dd\u601d\u8ffd|p=L\u00e1n S\u012bzhu\u012b|s=|t=}}).\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Chenzhang Taikang (animation), Qian Wenqing (audio drama \u2013 adult), Yu Shuhan (audio drama \u2013 child), Chen Jinwen (web series) \n:Voiced by (Japanese): [[Y\u016bsuke Kobayashi (voice actor)|Y\u016bsuke Kobayashi]] (audio drama) \n:Played by: Zheng Fanxing (adult), Jiang Yiting (child)\n\n:Lan Sizhui is a disciple of the Lan Sect. He was originally born to the Wen Sect with the name Wen Yuan ({{zh|c=|p=W\u0113n Yu\u00e0n|s=\u6e29\u82d1|t=\u6eab\u82d1}}). He was found by Wei Wuxian among the remains of the Wen Sect who were forced to work in a valley in Yiling. Wei Wuxian then started raising him. After the First Siege of the Burial Mounds, when he was only three years old, he lost both Wei Wuxian and his home. He was later found by Lan Wangji who came searching for Wei Wuxian's remains. But he fell into a high fever and lost all memories of his past. He was then re-named as Lan Yuan, and presumably given the courtesy name Sizhui in the same year that Wei Wuxian returned to the living world. Thirteen years after the First Siege, he is finally reunited with Wei Wuxian and Wen Ning, although he only remembered his past memories much later. In the present setting, he is close friends with Lan Jingyi and Jin Ling.\n\n'''Lan Jingyi''' ({{zh|c=\u84dd\u666f\u4eea|p=L\u00e1n J\u01d0ngy\u00ed|s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Wang Chenguang (animation), Cao Xupeng (audio drama), Liu Kang (web series) \n:Voiced by (Japanese): [[Hiro Shimono]] (audio drama)\n:Played by: Guo Cheng\n\n:Lan Jingyi is a disciple of the Lan Sect. He is short-tempered and dislikes people who don't follow rules and are noisy, even though he is ironically noisy himself when angered. However, despite his prideful nature, he is caring. He will stand up for his friends, even for Wei Wuxian whom he had initially disliked because of his reckless personality. He is close friends with Lan Sizhui and Jin Ling.\n\n=== Lanling Jin Sect ===\nThe Lanling Jin Sect ({{zh|c=\u5170\u9675\u91d1\u6c0f|p=L\u00e1nl\u00edng J\u012bn Sh\u00ec|s=|t=}}) is a cultivational sect based in Carp Tower, Lanling.

He was the illegitimate son of Jin Guangshan and uncle to Jin Ling. Due to the power of the Jin Sect before and during his reign, he also became the first Chief Cultivator ({{zh|c=\u4ed9\u7763|p=|s=|t=}}), which can be seen as the leader among all cultivation sects. He is also known as one of the Three Zuns alongside his sworn brothers Lan Xichen and Nie Mingjue. He sought greater amounts of power due to the fact he had often been looked down upon due to his status as the son of a prostitute. However, this is with the exception of his sworn brother Lan Xichen, whose kindness was the reason he held Lan Xichen to the highest esteem. He had accomplished many achievements in his life, such as building lookout towers and helping to rebuild the Cloud Recesses' libraries. However, his desire for power had led him to team up with shady characters like Xue Yang to harness the power of the Stygian Tiger Seal ({{zh|c=\u4ed9\u7763|p=|s=|t=}}), which was once deemed too powerful and broken in half to prevent any more damage. He also murdered anyone who got in his way, including his father, brother, wife, son, master, and friend. His murdering of Nie Mingjue led Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji around China to solve the mystery of a particular fierce corpse, which turned out to be Nie Mingjue. In the end, when his deeds were revealed, everyone quickly turned against him and Nie Huaisang tricked Lan Xichen into murdering him.\n\n'''Jin Guangshan''' ({{zh|c=\u91d1\u5149\u5584|p=J\u012bn Gu\u0101ngsh\u00e0n|s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Li Longbin (animation), Xiao Tan (audio drama), Yang Mo (web series) \n:Played by: Shen Xiaohai \n\n:Jin Guangshan was the former leader of the Jin Sect who had many illegitimate children, among them are Jin Guangyao and Mo Xuanyu.

He is the son of Jiang Yanli and Jin Zixuan, and the nephew of both Jin Guangyao and Jiang Cheng. He is currently taken care of by Jiang Cheng. He is the only living, legitimate child of the Jin Sect, therefore he will inherit the sect leader position after Jin Guangyao. He owns a spiritual dog which he had named as Fairy, which was given to him by Jin Guangyao. He is prideful and short-tempered, which caused him difficulty getting along with his peers and he doesn't have many friends his age. Although he became who he is due to his life circumstances, he is still kind at heart and strives to become a better person. He is close friends with Lan Sizhui and Lan Jingyi.\n\n'''Jin Zixuan''' ({{zh|c=\u91d1\u5b50\u8f69|p= J\u012bn Zixu\u0101n|s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Gu Jiangshan (animation), Liu Mingyue (audio drama), Shi Zekun (web series) \n:Voiced by (Japanese): [[Hiroki Takahashi]] (audio drama)\n:Played by: Cao Yuchen \n\n:Jin Zixuan was Jiang Yanli's husband and the father of Jin Ling. He was Jin Guangshan's only legitimate child. He was arrogant and had no issue insulting Jiang Yanli while her brothers were in range to hear. However, he was shown to have a sense of justice, shown by his willingness to stand up to Wen Chao when the latter ordered them to seize Mianmian to be sacrificed in order to lure a monster, protecting her alongside Lan Wangji even though he knew his actions would bear consequences.\n\n'''Qin Su''' ({{zh|c=\u79e6\u612b|p= Q\u00edn S\u00f9|s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Ye Zhiqiu (audio drama)\n:Played by: Jin Luying\n\n:Qin Su was the wife of Jin Guangyao. She was the daughter of Qin Cangye, the leader of the Laoling Qin Sect, a subsidiary of the Jin Sect. After Jin Guangyao saved her life during the Sunshot Campaign, she fell in love with him and did not give up until they were married. She then became Jin Guangyao's official wife and the mistress of Carp Tower. It is revealed that she was actually one of Jin Guangshan's illegitimate children as Jin Guangshan once raped her mother while he was drunk. But because Qin Cangye was an advent supporter of Jin Guangshan, her mother could not tell him. When her mother told Jin Guangyao the truth that he and Qin Su were siblings, as Qin Su was already pregnant, he still married her to not lose the support of her stepfather or Jin Guangshan. When their son was around three, Jin Guangyao murdered him as one of his plans to rise up to the Chief Cultivator title. After learning of this secret, she committed suicide in front of a crowd of people the night of the Discussion Conference hosted at Carp Tower.\n\n'''Mo Xuanyu''' ({{zh|c=\u83ab\u7384\u7fbd|p= M\u00f2 Xu\u00e1ny\u01d4|s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): [[Zhang Jie (voice actor)|Zhang Jie]] (animation), Tong Yin (audio drama)\n:Voiced by (Japanese): Nakayama Kazuhisa (audio drama)\n:Played by: [[Xiao Zhan]]\n\n:Mo Xuanyu was one of Jin Guangshan's illegitimate sons and a former disciple of the Jin Sect. He sacrificed his soul to summon Wei Wuxian to exact revenge on the Mo family on his behalf. In his living days and even during Wei Wuxian's possession of his body, he was described as a lunatic. In his past, he was tortured with meeting the expectations of his servant mother to gain recognition of his father. He was then sent to Jin Sect to learn cultivation, but was cast out after harassing Jin Guangyao, as he is a cut-sleeve (homosexual). He returned to Mo Village and his mother died soon after, leaving him in the care of his abusive aunt and her son, Mo Ziyuan. Both were resentful of his wasted opportunity at becoming a cultivator of a prolific sect, and hence physically beaten and verbally abused him to the point of insanity.\n\n=== Qinghe Nie Sect ===\nThe Qinghe Nie Sect ({{zh|c=\u6e05\u6cb3\u8042\u6c0f|p=Q\u012bngh\u00e9 Ni\u00e8 Sh\u00ec|s=|t=}}) is a cultivational sect that resides in the Unclean Realm.

He is known as one of the Three Zuns alongside his sworn brothers Jin Guangyao and Lan Xichen. Nie Mingjue's personality was defined by strictness, a bad temper and an intolerance for anything deviating from the moral good. While this attitude won him acclaim and reputation, the shift in power towards the Jin Sect after the Sunshot Campaign also marked him as a great opposition to their power. Furthermore, as the trademark cultivation of his sect affected his temper, his intolerance grew and he could not accept that two of his subordinates were killed by Jin Guangyao when they were captured with him and brought before Wen Ruohan in Nightless City. This was despite Jin Guangyao pointing out that Nie Mingjue himself would have died if they did not, since all three had offended Wen Ruohan. He was murdered by Jin Guangyao and turned into a fierce corpse.\n\n'''Nie Huaisang''' ({{zh|c=\u8042\u6000\u6851|p= Ni\u00e8 Hu\u00e1is\u0101ng|s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Liu Sanmu (animation), Qi Sijia (audio drama), Ji Li (web series) \n:Voiced by (Japanese): [[Yoshitsugu Matsuoka]] (audio drama)\n:Played by: Ji Li \n\n:Nie Huaisang is the current leader of the Nie Sect and the younger half-brother of Nie Mingjue.

He accused the Lan Sect of some wrongdoing and forced them to burn down the Cloud Recesses under the guise of cleansing the place so that it could be \"reborn from the firelight\".

He enjoyed looking at ladies even though he had a wife, to the point of harassing them. One instance was with Mianmian, which ended with Wei Wuxian saving her by diverting his attention to fake erotic arts. Because of his and Wen Ruohan's malicious intent, they caused great destruction to the Lan Sect and Jiang Sect by destroying their residences and killing the entire Jiang Sect, except the three children who went into hiding. He was also responsible for throwing Wei Wuxian into the Burial Mounds, which resulted in his own death when Wei Wuxian returned to end his clan with his newfound demonic abilities.\n\n'''Wen Qing''' ({{zh|c=\u6e29\u60c5|p= W\u0113n Q\u00edng|s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Qiao Shiyu (animation, web series), Shan Xin (audio drama)\n:Played by: [[Meng Ziyi]] (adult), Lin Chenxi (child) \n\n:Wen Qing was a member of the Wen sect and Wen Ning's older sister.

He was responsible for melting away Jiang Cheng's Golden Core when he was captured by the Wen Sect during hiding. Along with Wen Chao, he died in Wei Wuxian's hands.\n\n'''Wang Lingjiao''' ({{zh|c=\u738b\u7075\u5a07|p=W\u00e1ng L\u00edngji\u0101o|s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Qiu Qiu (animation, web series), Yan Mengmeng (audio drama)\n:Played by: Lu Enjie\n\n:Wang Lingjiao was a former maid of Wen Chao's principal wife and later his lover. Despite only achieving her status by engaging in sexual activities with Wen Chao, she was arrogant and pompous. She also guarded her status as Wen Chao's favorite, and did her best to eliminate any competition, like volunteering Mianmian as a sacrifice when she witnessed Wen Chao flirting with her. She died in Wei Wuxian's hands, and later became a fierce corpse where she turned against Wen Chao in an attempt to kill him.\n\n=== Yunmeng Jiang Sect ===\nThe Yunmeng Jiang Sect ({{zh|c=\u4e91\u68a6\u6c5f\u6c0f|p=Y\u00fanm\u00e8ng Ji\u0101ng Sh\u00ec|s=|t=}}) is a cultivational sect located in Yunmeng's Lotus Pier. The current leader is Jiang Cheng. The real-life counterpart to the sect's location is [[Yunmeng County|Yunmeng]] in [[Hubei]] province.\n\n'''Jiang Fengmian''' ({{zh|c=\u6c5f\u67ab\u7720|p=Ji\u0101ng F\u0113ngmi\u00e1n|s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Tang Shuiyu (animation, web series), Zhang Zhen (audio drama)\n:Played by: Lu Jianmin \n\n:Jiang Fengmian was the former leader of the Jiang Sect. He was the husband of Yu Ziyuan and the father of Jiang Cheng and Jiang Yanli. He was friends with Wei Wuxian's father, Wei Changze, who was a servant of the sect. He was also familiar with Wei Wuxian's mother, Cangse Sanren, and it was rumored that he was in love with her. When he heard that both parents had died on a night-hunt, he dedicated himself to finding their son. He eventually found Wei Wuxian on the streets of Yiling and fed him a piece of melon before carrying him home to Yunmeng. Because of his treatment to Wei Wuxian which was seen as better than how he treated his own son, he and his wife often argued. Along with his wife, he died in Wen Sect's hands during their invasion of the Lotus Pier.\n\n'''Jiang Cheng''' ({{zh|c=\u6c5f\u6f84|p=Ji\u0101ng Ch\u00e9ng|s=|t=}}), [[courtesy name]] Wanyin ({{zh|c=\u665a\u541f|p=W\u01ceny\u00edn|s=|t=}}), thus also known as '''Jiang Wanyin''' ({{zh|c=\u6c5f\u665a\u541f|p=Ji\u0101ng W\u01ceny\u00edn|s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Guo Haoran (animation), Peng Yao (audio drama), Wang Kai (web series) \n:Voiced by (Japanese): [[Hikaru Midorikawa]] (audio drama)\n:Played by: Wang Zhuocheng (adult), Huang Zhenchen (child) \n\n:Jiang Cheng is the current leader of the Jiang Sect. Titled Sandu Shengshou ({{zh|c=\u4e09\u6bd2\u5723\u624b|p=S\u0101nd\u00fa sh\u00e8ngsh\u01d2u|s=|t=}}), he is the brother of Jiang Yanli and Wei Wuxian, and the uncle of Jin Ling. He is a straight-laced and strict man who abides by the rules. He has a deep care for his family and friends and knows to respect his elders. At the beginning, he had a good relationship with Wei Wuxian, despite the latter often annoying him with his mischief. However, his hatred for the Wen Sect caused a great strain in their relationship. This eventually became pure hatred when Wen Ning accidentally killed his brother-in-law (Jin Zixuan) and his sister died while protecting Wei Wuxian. However, ultimately, he gives up this hatred after learning how Wei Wuxian had sacrificed his Golden Core for him. Though despite all these, he still loves his nephew Jin Ling, and acts in a strict manner like his mother had did to him as a child.\n\n'''Jiang Yanli''' ({{zh|c=\u6c5f\u538c\u79bb|p=Ji\u0101ng Y\u00e0nl\u00ed|s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Li Shimeng (animation), Qiao Shiyu (audio drama), Bai Xuecen (web series) \n:Played by: [[Lulu Xuan|Xuan Lu]] (adult), Ye Xuantong (child)\n\n:Jiang Yanli was the daughter of Jiang Fengmian and Yu Ziyuan, and older sister of Jiang Cheng and Wei Wuxian. She was a very kind person who would always protect her younger brothers and offer them emotional support. She had an arranged marriage with Jin Zixuan as their mothers were very close. But she did not like Jin Zixuan at first, and was even mocked at by him for being average. The engagement was called off until Jin Zixuan realised his mistake and pursued her again. They were then blessed with a son, Jin Ling, but were unable to raise him for long as they died in the hands of Wen Ning.\n\n'''Yu Ziyuan''' ({{zh|c=\u865e\u7d2b\u9e22|p=Y\u00fa Z\u01d0yu\u0101n|s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Ji Guanlin (animation), Zhang Kai (audio drama), Li Jinyan (web series) \n:Played by: Zhang Jingtong \n\n:Yu Ziyuan was the wife of Jiang Fengmian, and mother of Jiang Cheng and Jiang Yanli. She had a cold and assertive personality which did not come off as likeable. Titled Madam Yu ({{zh|c=\u865e\u592b\u4eba|p=Y\u00fa f\u016br\u00e9n|s=|t=}}) and Violet Spider ({{zh|c=\u7d2b\u8718\u86db|p=Z\u01d0 Zh\u012bzh\u016b|s=|t=}}), she was a formidable cultivator whose name alone could scare quite a few people away. She had a poor relationship with Wei Wuxian, as she viewed him as the cause of all problems that befall her family. She would often speak poorly of him in her conversations with Jiang Fengmian. She obliged to whip him with Zidian when Wang Lingjiao demanded him to be punished. However, she showed some care towards Wei Wuxian when she did not chop off his hand despite Wang Lingjiao's demands. Along with her husband, she died in Wen Sect's hands during their invasion of the Lotus Pier. During her final moments, she told Wei Wuxian to protect Jiang Cheng with his life.\n\n=== Yi City Arc ===\nDuring Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji's mission, they arrived at Yi City ({{zh|c=\u4e49\u57ce|p=Y\u00ec ch\u00e9ng|s=|t=}}) and bumped into Lan Sizhui, Lan Jingyi, Jin Ling and some other disciples from different sects during their night hunt. From there, they uncover the truth of Xiao Xingchen's death and found the missing right arm for the mission.\n\n'''Xiao Xingchen''' ({{zh|c=\u6653\u661f\u5c18|p=Xi\u01ceo X\u012bngch\u00e9n|s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Chen Hao (audio drama), Chenzhang Taikang (web series) \n:Played by: Song Jiyang\n\n:Also known as Daozhang ({{zh|c=\u9053\u957f|p=D\u00e0ozh\u00e1ng|s=|t=}}), Xiao Xingchen was one of Baoshan Sanren's ({{zh|c=\u62b1\u5c71\u6563\u4eba}}) students who left the mountain for the mortal world. He and his best friend Song Lan were once called \"the bright moon and cold breeze Xiao Xingchen, the distant snow and cold frost Song Zichen\" ({{zh|c=\u660e\u6708\u6e05\u98ce\u6653\u661f\u5c18\uff0c\u50b2\u96ea\u51cc\u971c\u5b8b\u5b57\u741b}}). He first met A-Qing who was in the midst of using her fake blindness to steal money, and the latter started following him around. After finding an injured person lying unconscious on the street, later revealed to be Xue Yang, the three of them started living in an uninhabited coffin house. During their time here, he once told them stories about some of Baoshan Sanren's disciples, including Wei Wuxian's parents. Throughout the years, he went on night-hunts with Xue Yang, unknowingly killing innocent people who were put under Corpse Poisoning by the latter.  After finding out the truth about Xue Yang's identity from A-Qing, he told her to run away while he confronted Xue Yang. However, the truth of him unintentionally killing Song Lan put him in great misery, hence he committed suicide. As this method of death caused his soul to be shattered, Xue Yang was unable to turn him into a fierce corpse. Not willing to let him go, Xue Yang stored his soul in a spirit-trapping pouch, which was later presented to Wei Wuxian when he sought his help to restore it. At the end, after hearing A-Qing's story, the disciples cried and mourned over their deaths while they burned incense money for him and A-Qing right outside Yi City.\n\n'''Song Lan''' ({{zh|c=\u5b8b\u5c9a|p=S\u00f2ng L\u00e1n|s=|t=}}), [[courtesy name]] \u5b50\u741b ({{zh|c=\u5b50\u741b|p=Zich\u0113n|s=|t=}}), thus also known as '''Song Zichen''' ({{zh|c=\u5b8b\u5b50\u741b|p=S\u00f2ng Zich\u0113n |s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Wu Lei (audio drama), Lu Lifeng (web series) \n:Played by: Li Bowen\n\n:Song Lan was a cultivator from Baixue Temple, and best friend of Xiao Xingchen. He was described by Xiao Xingchen to be \"a man with strong sense of righteousness\". He and Xiao Xingchen were once called \"the bright moon and cold breeze Xiao Xingchen, the distant snow and cold frost Song Zichen\". He once had his eyes blinded and poisoned by Xue Yang when Baixue Temple was destroyed. But Xiao Xingchen dug out his own eyes and gave them to him after bringing him to Baoshan Sanren's residence and begging her to save him. While searching for Xiao Xingchen after his sudden disappearance, he came across A-Qing who was out playing on her own. A-Qing then helped him get to Xiao Xingchen. When they arrived at the coffin house, he recognised Xue Yang immediately and advised A-Qing to stay away from this matter, although she then followed him secretly. During his fight with Xue Yang, the latter gave him Corpse Poisoning and cut off his tongue, hence he was rendered mute. Xue Yang later tricked Xiao Xingchen into killing him. In his final moments, he did not make a sound as he did not want to let Xiao Xingchen know it was him. After his death, Xue Yang turned him into a fierce corpse who will obey him, and he was also summoned to fight Wei Wuxian. But Wei Wuxian managed to return his consciousness and gave him the spirit-trapping pouch that contained Xiao Xingchen's and A-Qing's souls. When asked what he would do with Xiao Xingchen's body, he lamented that he would cremate his body, roam the world with Xiao Xingchen's sword Shuanghua ({{zh|c=\u971c\u534e|p=Shu\u0101nghu\u00e1) |s=|t=}} to eliminate evil, and await for his return so he could tell him that this was never his fault.\n\n'''A-Qing''' ({{zh|c=\u963f\u7b90|p=\u0100-q\u012bng|s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Yang Neng (audio drama), He Wenxiao (web series) \n:Played by: Chen Zhuoxuan \n\n:A-Qing was a young maiden who lived on the streets prior to meeting Xiao Xingchen and she was an expert at pretending to be blind. After encountering Xiao Xingchen, she started following him against his will at first, but they eventually started living together in an uninhabited coffin house with Xue Yang. Throughout the years, she was extremely cautious about Xue Yang and protective of Xiao Xingchen, hence she would follow them sometimes, uncovering Xue Yang's secrets in the process. When she witnessed how Xue Yang tricked Xiao Xingchen into killing Song Lan, she immediately decided to bring Xiao Xingchen away to keep him safe. However, Xiao Xingchen told her to run away instead while he confronted Xue Yang himself. As she went around searching for a powerful cultivator to seek revenge for Xiao Xingchen, Xue Yang found her. After continuously insulting Xue Yang in anger, the latter lost his patience and dug out her eyes and cut her tongue, resulting in her death. When Wei Wuxian, Lan Wangji and the disciples arrived at Yi City, as a walking corpse, she kept on warning them about Xue Yang. However, her muteness brought about confusion until Wei Wuxian finally figured out her intentions. To learn more about her story, Wei Wuxian used Empathy, a rite that allows a spirit to use one's body as a medium, allowing oneself to see, feel and hear their memories. After hearing her story, the disciples cried and mourned over her death while they burned incense money for her and Xiao Xingchen right outside Yi City.\n\n'''Xue Yang''' ({{zh|c=\u859b\u6d0b|p=Xu\u0113 Y\u00e1ng|s=|t=}}), [[courtesy name]] \u6210\u7f8e ({{zh|c=\u6210\u7f8e|p=Ch\u00e9ngm\u011bi|s=|t=}}), thus also known as '''Xue Chengmei''' ({{zh|c=\u859b\u6210\u7f8e|p=Xu\u0113 Ch\u00e9ngm\u011bi |s=|t=}})\n:Voiced by (Mandarin): Hui Long (audio drama), Liu Sanmu (web series) \n:Played by: Wang Haoxuan\n\n:Xue Yang was a guest disciple of the Jin Sect who recreated the other half of the Stygian Tiger Seal. He was found by Xiao Xingchen and A-Qing while he was injured and unconscious on the streets. He was then brought to an uninhabited coffin house where the two tended to his injuries. As the two did not know his real identity, he used Xiao Xingchen's blindness to his advantage and ended up living with them for years through deception. However, he was exposed when A-Qing witnessed his malicious intent. He fought Xiao Xingchen and ultimately revealed the truth, which caused Xiao Xingchen to commit suicide. As Xue Yang was unable to turn him into a fierce corpse, he stored his shattered soul in a spirit-trapping pouch. He later found A-Qing who was seeking revenge, and killed her by digging her eyes and cutting her tongue out. When Wei Wuxian, Lan Wangji and the disciples arrived at Yi City, he pretended to be Xiao Xingchen and tricked them to get himself some alone time with Wei Wuxian. Revealing that he has been searching for the Yiling Patriarch, he then presented Wei Wuxian the spirit-trapping pouch and threatened him to restore it. Wei Wuxian saw through his act and quickly found out he was Xue Yang. The two then got into a fight, and Lan Wangji subsequently took over while Wei Wuxian goes to find A-Qing with the disciples. After knowing the whole truth about the past, Wei Wuxian returned to the battle to aid in killing him. However, he was taken away by the gravedigger in the middle of battle. It was unclear whether he had died, but both Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji believed that his injuries were too serious to be healed.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Tracklist\n| collapsed       = \n| all_writing     = \n| all_lyrics      = \n| all_music       = \n| arranger_credits = yes\n| extra_column = Singers\n\n| title1          = Drunken Dreams of the Past (\u9189\u68a6\u524d\u5c18)\n| note1           = Opening theme song\n| lyrics1         = Sun Yujing\n| music1          = Sun Yujing \n| arranger1       =  Zhong Xingming \n| extra1          =  [[Terry Lin|Lin Zhixuan]] \n| length1         = 04:31 \n\n| title2          =  Asking the Zither (\u95ee\u7434) \n| note2           = Ending theme song (season 1; eps 1\u20138, 14\u201315)\n| lyrics2        =  Sun Yujing\n| music2         =  Sun Yujing, Feng Shuo\n| arranger2      =  Feng Shuo \n| extra2        = Yin Lin \n| length2       = 03:16 \n\n| title3          =No Envies (\u4e0d\u7fa1)\n| note3           = Ending theme song (season 1; eps 9\u201313)\n| lyrics3         = Miao Boyang \n| music3          = He Liang \n| arranger3       =  Zhao Peng \n| extra3          = [[Super Impassioned Net Generation|S.I.N.G]] \n| length3         = 04:28\n\n| title4          =  Unchanging Youth (\u5c11\u5e74\u5982\u6545)\n| note4           = Ending theme song (season 2) \n| lyrics4         = Cheng Yi, He Siwei \n| music4          = Lin Hai\n| arranger4       =  Lin Hai , Seven \n| extra4          = [[R1SE]] \n| length4         = 04:20\n        \n| title5          = Envying Clouds (\u7fa1\u4e91) \n| note5           = Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji's theme song\n| lyrics5         = Sun Yujing\n| music5         = Sun Yujing\n| arranger5       =  Weng Teng \n| extra5          = Hita \n| length5         = 03:00\n\n| title6          = Drunken Dreams of the Past (\u9189\u68a6\u524d\u5c18)\n| note6           =\n| lyrics6         = Sun Yujing\n| music6          = Sun Yujing \n| arranger6       =  Zhong Xingming \n| extra6          =  [[Zhang Jie (voice actor)|Zhang Jie]] & Bian Jiang  \n| length6         = 04:31 \n}} \n\n==Reception==\nThe series received overwhelmingly positive reviews for its high production quality and storyline, and amassed a notable Internet fandom both in China and overseas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ent.ifeng.com/a/20180712/43067782_0.shtml|title=\u9ad8\u6c34\u51c6\u5236\u4f5c\u300a\u9b54\u9053\u7956\u5e08\u300b\u4e3a\u56fd\u6f2b\u590d\u5174\u6ce8\u5165\u65b0\u529b|date=July 12, 2018|website=Phoenix New Media|language=zh}}</ref> Upon its release in China, the series became an instant hit, ultimately generating 1.74 billion views on [[Tencent Video|Tencent's streaming platform]], as of December 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://v.qq.com/x/cover/k4mutekomtrdbux.html|title=Mo Dao Zu Shi official streaming\u9b54\u9053\u7956\u5e08 \u7b2c01\u96c6_1080P\u5728\u7ebf\u89c2\u770b\u5e73\u53f0_\u817e\u8baf\u89c6\u9891|website=Tencent Video|language=zh|access-date=2018-12-20}}</ref> On [[Douban]], ''Mo Dao Zu Shi'' holds a rating of 8.9 out of 10, making it one of the best received [[Chinese animation|donghua]] series of 2018 in China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://movie.douban.com/subject/27015848/|title=\u9b54\u9053\u7956\u5e08 (\u8c46\u74e3)|website=movie.douban.com|access-date=2018-12-27}}</ref> \n\nOutside China, ''Mo Dao Zu Shi'' was officially released by [[Tencent Video|Tencent]] on its official [[YouTube]] channel on August 27, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m346FShZ5Dc|title=\u300aMo Dao Zu Shi\u300b|website=YouTube|accessdate=2019-08-29}}</ref> It was also released by WeTV, a streaming platform for overseas users created by Tencent, under the title of ''The Founder of Diabolism''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wetv.vip/play?cid=r8t02fkxr9jyvvn''|title=The Founder of Diabolism|website=WeTV|accessdate=2019-08-29}}</ref>\n\n===Awards and nominations===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n!

The [[Aizu-Otsuka Kofun]] within the city borders dates from the 4th century AD, and is an [[Important Cultural Property (Japan)|Important Cultural Property]].\n\nAccording to legend, in 88 BCE, [[Emperor Sujin]] sent two generals; Ohiko and Takenukawa-wake to the [[T\u014dhoku region]] for the purpose of establishing peace after the quashing of a rebellion in the region.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=International Dictionary of Historic Places, Volume 5: Asia and Oceania|last=|first=|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|year=1996|isbn=1-884964-04-4|editor-last=Schellinger|editor-first=Paul|location=Chicago|pages=10|editor-last2=Salkin|editor-first2=Robert}}</ref>\n\nBefore the late 12th century, Aizuwakamatsu was mainly a market town and a base for regional warlords. Starting in 1192, Aizuwakamatsu became part of the regions that were controlled by the [[Kamakura shogunate]]. Soon after taking power, Yoritomo granted a [[samurai]] named Suwara Yoshitsura (from the [[Miura clan]]) all of Aizu. A descendant of Suwara, Ashina Morinori, began construction of the first castle in the city in 1384.<ref name=\":0\" /> During the [[Sengoku period]] the final lord of Aizu, Ashina Moritaka, died in 1583 and soon the [[Ashina clan]] lost power. After the [[Satake clan]] took control of the castle, they placed a twelve-year-old member of their clan who was renamed Ashina Morishige and proclaimed lord of Aizu. The Ashina clan regained control of Aizu for a brief time in 1589 with the help of [[Date Masamune]]. However, Masamune took over the domain for himself soon after. He surrendered in 1590 to [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. Toyotomi gave Aizu to one of his allies, [[Gamo Ujisato]] who then began construction in 1592 of a new castle at the site. It was during this time that the town was renamed \"Wakamatsu\" (young pine).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring the [[Edo period]], Aizu was controlled briefly by [[Uesugi Kagekatsu]] in 1600 after the death of Gamo Ujisato in 1596. [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] accused Uesugi of gathering troops in Aizu. Ieyasu then transferred the Uesugi to [[Yonezawa, Yamagata|Yonezawa]].  Through inheritance, Aizu was passed to [[Hoshina Masayuki]] (a brother of the third Tokugawa shogun) in 1643. The [[Edo period]] saw the economic and cultural growth of Aizu.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Aizu Domain]] was the location of the [[Battle of Aizu]], one of the largest conflicts of the [[Boshin War]]. After the [[Meiji Restoration]], Wakamatsu Town was created with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. It became Wakamatsu City in 1899. On April 1, 1937, a part of Machikita village (from [[Kitaaizu District, Fukushima|Kitaaizu District]]) was merged into the city of Wakamatsu. The remained was annexed on April 1, 1951. The name of the city was changed to Aizuwakamatsu on January 1, 1955 when Wakamatsu merged with seven villages of Kitaaizu District (Kouya, Kouzashi, Monden, Ikki, Higashiyama, \u014cto and Minato). {{cn|date=February 2014}}.

The [[Aizu-Otsuka Kofun]] within the city borders dates from the 4th century AD, and is an [[Important Cultural Property (Japan)|Important Cultural Property]].\n\nAccording to legend, in 88 BCE, [[Emperor Sujin]] sent two generals; Ohiko and Takenukawa-wake to the [[T\u014dhoku region]] for the purpose of establishing peace after the quashing of a rebellion in the region.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=International Dictionary of Historic Places, Volume 5: Asia and Oceania|last=|first=|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|year=1996|isbn=1-884964-04-4|editor-last=Schellinger|editor-first=Paul|location=Chicago|pages=10|editor-last2=Salkin|editor-first2=Robert}}</ref>\n\nBefore the late 12th century, Aizuwakamatsu was mainly a market town and a base for regional warlords. Starting in 1192, Aizuwakamatsu became part of the regions that were controlled by the [[Kamakura shogunate]]. Soon after taking power, Yoritomo granted a [[samurai]] named Suwara Yoshitsura (from the [[Miura clan]]) all of Aizu. A descendant of Suwara, Ashina Morinori, began construction of the first castle in the city in 1384.<ref name=\":0\" /> During the [[Sengoku period]] the final lord of Aizu, Ashina Moritaka, died in 1583 and soon the [[Ashina clan]] lost power. After the [[Satake clan]] took control of the castle, they placed a twelve-year-old member of their clan who was renamed Ashina Morishige and proclaimed lord of Aizu. The Ashina clan regained control of Aizu for a brief time in 1589 with the help of [[Date Masamune]]. However, Masamune took over the domain for himself soon after. He surrendered in 1590 to [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. Toyotomi gave Aizu to one of his allies, [[Gamo Ujisato]] who then began construction in 1592 of a new castle at the site. It was during this time that the town was renamed \"Wakamatsu\" (young pine).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring the [[Edo period]], Aizu was controlled briefly by [[Uesugi Kagekatsu]] in 1600 after the death of Gamo Ujisato in 1596. [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] accused Uesugi of gathering troops in Aizu. Ieyasu then transferred the Uesugi to [[Yonezawa, Yamagata|Yonezawa]].  Through inheritance, Aizu was passed to [[Hoshina Masayuki]] (a brother of the third Tokugawa shogun) in 1643. The [[Edo period]] saw the economic and cultural growth of Aizu.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Aizu Domain]] was the location of the [[Battle of Aizu]], one of the largest conflicts of the [[Boshin War]]. After the [[Meiji Restoration]], Wakamatsu Town was created with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. It became Wakamatsu City in 1899. On April 1, 1937, a part of Machikita village (from [[Kitaaizu District, Fukushima|Kitaaizu District]]) was merged into the city of Wakamatsu. The remained was annexed on April 1, 1951. The name of the city was was changed to Aizuwakamatsu on January 1, 1955 when Wakamatsu merged with seven villages of Kitaaizu District (Kouya, Kouzashi, Monden, Ikki, Higashiyama, \u014cto and Minato). {{cn|date=February 2014}}.

In 1916, an Army [[Judge Advocate General's Corps|Judge Advocate General]] review determined that field clerks should be members of the military. Legislation in 1916 authorized those positions as military rather than civilian and created the ranks of Army Field Clerk (the former rank of Headquarters Clerk) and Quarter Master Corps Field Clerk (the former rank of Pay Clerk). In July, 1917, all Field Clerks were considered enlisted and were assigned an enlisted uniform. Their branch insignia was two crossed quill pens (worn on a disk pin on the left side of the standing collar and a freework insignia on the visored cap).\n\nIn 19 December 1917, ''Special Regulation 41'' stated that the Army Field Clerk and Quarter Master Corps Field Clerk ranks were authorized the same uniform as an officer. Their rank insignia was now a freework pin of crossed quill pens on either side of the freework \"U.S.\" pins worn on the standing collar of the M1909 tunic. They were not permitted the brown mohair cuff braid band of an Army officer, but were authorized a silver-and-black braid hatcord for wear with the M1911 Campaign Hat and the officer's \"G.I. Eagle\" on the M1902 peaked cap.\n\nOn 9 July 1918, Congress established the rank and grade of warrant officer concurrent with establishing the Army [[Mine Planter Service (U.S. Army)|Mine Planter Service]] (AMPS)<ref>http://www.militarymuseum.org/Mines.html | The California State Military Museum - Forts Under the Sea - Submarine Mine Defense of San Francisco Bay</ref> within the [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps|Coast Artillery Corps]]. Creation of the Mine Planter Service replaced an informal service crewed by civilians, replacing them with military personnel, of whom the vessel's master, mates, chief engineer, and assistant engineers were Army warrant officers. Warrant officer rank was indicated by rings of brown cord worn on the lower sleeve of the uniform jacket: two for 2nd Mate and 2nd Assistant Engineer, three for 1st Mate and Assistant Engineer, and four for Ship's Master and Chief Engineer.\n\n{{multiple image\n| header   = U.S. Army Warrant Officer rank insignia from 1941 to 1949\n| width    = 45\n| image1   = FlightOfficerWW2.jpg\n| caption1 = Flight Officer\n| image2   = JuniorWarrantWW2.jpg\n| caption2 = Warrant Officer\n| image3   = ChiefWarrantWW2.jpg\n| caption3 = Chief Warrant Officer\n}}\n{{anchor|W1|WOJG}}Since that time, the position of warrant officer in the Army has been refined. On 21 August 1941, under {{USPL|77|230}}, Congress authorized two grades: warrant officer (junior grade) and chief warrant officer. In 1942, temporary appointments in about 40 occupational areas were made.\nThe insignia for warrant officer (junior grade) was a gold bar {{convert|3/8|in|cm}} wide and {{convert|1|in|cm}} long, rounded at the ends with brown enamel on top and a latitudinal center of gold {{sfrac|1|8}} (0.32&nbsp;cm) inch wide. The insignia for chief warrant officer was a gold bar {{convert|3/8|in|cm}} in width and {{convert|1|in|cm}} in length with rounded ends, brown enamel on top with a longitudinal center stripe of gold {{convert|1/8|in|cm}} wide. The brown enamel backing of the warrant officer insignia was based on the color of the sleeve insignia of rank for ship's officers of the AMPS.<ref name=\"WO-1\">{{cite web|url=http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/wocc/woprogram.asp#history|title=Warrant Officer History|publisher=U.S. Army Warrant Officer Career College|accessdate=14 November 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"tioh_rank\">http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/UniformedServices/Insignia_Rank/warrant_officers.aspx |Insignia of Grade Warrant - Officers</ref><ref>[http://www.usawoa.org/stivers2announced.htm Ship's officers]</ref>\n\nOn 18 July 1942 {{USPL|77|658}}, the Flight Officer Act, was enacted, creating the rank of [[flight officer]], equivalent to warrant officer (junior grade) and assigned to the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]] (USAAF). Insignia was the same as for a warrant officer (junior grade), except the backing was in blue enamel rather than brown. Most flight officers were graduates of various USAAF flight-training programs, including power and glider pilots, and navigator and bombardier ratings. Graduates were appointed to the rating of flight officer, but some of each graduating class were commissioned as [[second lieutenant]]s. Once reaching operational units and after gaining flying experience, flight officers were later offered direct commissions as lieutenants.\n\nFlight sergeants, who were assigned as transport and glider pilots, were appointed as flight officers when the new rank was created. Some of the first eligible flight officers were Americans who had served as sergeant pilots in the [[Royal Air Force]] and who transferred to the USAAF after the U.S. entered the war.\n\nIn November 1942, the War Department defined the rank order as having warrant officers above all enlisted grades and below all commissioned grades. In March 1944, the first six women were appointed to the warrant officer grades as Band Leaders and administrative specialists.\n\nIn 1947, legislation was sought to introduce four grades of warrant officers. Proposed rank titles were: chief warrant officer, senior warrant officer, warrant officer first class, and warrant officer.\n\nIn 1949, {{USPL|81|351}}, the Career Compensation Act, created four pay grades, W-1 through W-4, for all the armed services. The two warrant ranks were unchanged, but warrant officer (junior grade) was pay grade W-1, while chief warrant officer started at W-2 and could advance to W-3 and -4.\n\nIn late 1949, the Warrant Officer Flight Program was created, which trained thousands of warrant officer pilots. The personnel were to be trained by the US Air Force, but controlled by the US Army Transportation Corps. The first helicopter pilot class was 51A (April 1951 to December 1951), which was trained to fly [[Sikorsky H-19 Chickasaw|H-19 Chickasaws]]. The program was temporarily cancelled in 1959 due to military budget cuts, but was reinstated in 1963 to meet the increased demand.\n\n{{multiple image\n| header   = U.S. Army Warrant Officer rank insignia from 1956 to 2004\n| width1   = 45\n| image1   = US Army WO-1 1950-1972.png\n| caption1 = WO1 (1956-1972)\n| width2   = 45\n| image2   = US Army CW-2 1950-1972.png\n| caption2 = CW2 (1956\u20131972)\n| width3   = 45\n| image3   = US Army CW-3 1950-1972.png\n| caption3 = CW3 (1956\u20131972)\n| width4   = 45\n| image4   = US Army CW-4 1950-1972.png\n| caption4 = CW4 (1956-1972)\n| width5   = 41\n| image5   = US-Army-CW5old.svg\n| caption5 = CW5 (1991\u20132004)\n}}\nIn 1954, the Warrant Officer Act, {{USPL|83|379}}, created separate ranks for each pay grade, W-1 through W-4. On 10 September 1956, AR 670-5 authorized the approved insignia for the new ranks that consisted of a metal frame around a brown enamel bar. The insignia for Warrant Officer 1 (Grade W-1) and Chief Warrant Officer 2 (Grade W-2) was a gold metal frame with one or two horizontal metal bands across it. Chief Warrant Officer 3 and Chief Warrant Officer 4 had a silver frame with one or two horizontal bands across it.\n\nDue to the demand for helicopter pilots in Vietnam, the number of warrant officer pilots grew from about 2,960 in 1966 to more than 12,000 by 1970. In 1973, a reduction in force began and chief warrant officer helicopter pilots were offered promotion to the rank of first lieutenant to retain combat veterans.\n\nOn 10 June 1970, the Army adopted a redesigned warrant officer insignia that was easier to identify. It was a silver bar with one to four black enamel squares on it (one per level of rank). \"In July 1972, Army Warrant Officers began wearing the newly designed silver rank insignia, with black squares...\"<ref>[https://warrantofficerhistory.org/Hist_of_Army_WO.htm#1950-1974 \"Army Warrant Officer History 1950\u20131974\"].

Candidates were drawn from Chief Warrant Officer 4s (CW4) who had attended a special course at the Warrant Officer school at Fort Rucker. The first class graduated in 8 December 1988. The Warrant Officer Management Act {{USPL|102|190}} of 5 December 1991, created the paygrade of W5 and the separate rank of Master Warrant Officer (CW5), since renamed as Chief Warrant Officer Five.\n\nOn 9 July 2004 the Warrant Officer Branch insignia (also known as the \"Eagle Rising\" or \"Squashed Bug\") was discontinued.<ref>[http://www.cavhooah.com/info/index.php/join-the-cav/warrant-officers/warrant-insignia/ \"Warrant officers to sport branch insignia\"] by Sgt. 1st Class Marcia Triggs.

Through progressive levels of expertise in assignments, training, and education, the warrant officer administers, manages, maintains, operates, and integrates Army systems and equipment across the full spectrum of Army operations. Warrant officers are innovative integrators of emerging technologies, dynamic teachers, confident warfighters, and developers of specialized teams of soldiers. They support a wide range of Army missions throughout their careers. Warrant officers in the Army are accessed with specific levels of technical ability. They refine their technical expertise and develop their leadership and management skills through tiered progressive assignment and education. The following are specific characteristics and responsibilities of the separate, successive warrant officer grades:\n\na. Warrant officer one (WO1) / chief warrant officer two (CW2): A WO1 is an officer appointed by warrant with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position given by the Secretary of the Army. CW2s and above are commissioned officers with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position as given by the President of the United States. WO1's and CW2's primary focus is becoming proficient and working on those systems linked directly to their AOC/MOS, that is, their area of concentration (officer AOC), or an enlisted rank's military occupational specialty (MOS). Warrant officers are classified by warrant officer military occupational specialty, or WOMOS. As they become experts on the systems they operate and maintain, their focus migrates to integrating their systems with other branch systems.\n\nb. Chief warrant officer three (CW3): The CW3s are advanced level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of technical leader, trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator, and advisor. They also perform any other branch-related duties assigned to them. As they become more senior, their focus becomes integrating branch systems into larger Army systems. \n \nc. Chief warrant officer four (CW4): The CW4s are senior-level technical and tactical experts who perform the duties of technical leader, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator, and advisor and serve in a wide variety of branch level positions. As they become more senior, they focus on integrating branch and Army systems into joint and national-level systems. \n \nd. Chief warrant officer five (CW5): The CW5s are master-level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of technical leader, manager, integrator, and advisor. They are the senior technical experts in their branches and serve at [[brigade]] and higher levels. They also serve as '''Command Chief Warrant Officers (CCWO)'''<ref name= ccwo>[https://www.army.mil/article/227507/smdc_command_chief_warrant_officer_discusses_role  Jason Cutshaw (September 20, 2019) SMDC command chief warrant officer discusses role]</ref> for large commands at the brigade level and higher.\n\nNote: Chief warrant officer six was approved by the Army Chief of Staff in 1970 with the anticipation of Congress approving two new grades, W-5 and W-6. However, Congress did not authorize W-5 until 1991 and as of January 2017 has not approved W-6. The original W-5 insignia consisted of a single silver bar superimposed with four equally spaced silver squares with each square bordered in black. In 2004, this insignia was changed to a single silver bar surmounted by a single, narrow, vertical, black stripe. The proposed CW6 insignia had two narrow, vertical, parallel, black stripes.<ref>https://warrantofficerhistory.org/Hist_Army_CW5_Insignia.htm. Retrieved 17 January 2017.

Those appointed would be selected from the noncommissioned officer ranks.\n\nOn 26 August 1916, Congress increased the Marine Corps strength, which included adding the rank of warrant officer; 43 Marine Gunners and 41 Quartermaster Clerks would be appointed. The first Marine Gunner is believed to have been [[Henry L. Hulbert]].<ref>Bevilacqua, Allan C. Major USMC (Ret) ''Henry Lewis Hurlbert-Marine Gunner'' ''Leatherneck'' Dec 2008 Vol XCI No 12</ref> On 22 May 1917, due to commissioned officer shortages, all but three of the appointees were commissioned as temporary second lieutenants. In 1918, the grade of pay clerk was added.\n\nIn June, 1926, Congress created the commissioned warrant grades of Chief Marine Gunner, Chief Quartermaster Clerk, and Chief Pay Clerk. Requirements for promotion to chief warrant officer were six years of service as a warrant officer and an examination to qualify.\n\nDuring World War II, Congress abolished the titles of Marine Gunner, Chief Marine Gunner, Quartermaster Clerk, Chief Quartermaster Clerk, Pay Clerk, and Chief Pay Clerk. Instead, they would be designated warrant officer or commissioned warrant officer. In 1943, all Marine warrant officer ranks were aligned with the other services. They were warrant officer and commissioned warrant officer.\n\nThen in 1949, the grade of WO (paygrade W-1) was created for warrant officers and CWO-2, CWO-3, and CWO-4 (paygrades W-2, W-3, and W-4) were created for commissioned warrant officers. In 1954, title \"Chief Warrant Officer\" replaced \"commissioned warrant officer\" for those in grades CWO-2, CWO-3 and CWO-4.\n\nOn 1 February 1992, the grade of CWO-5 (paygrade W-5) was created and those who are appointed serve on the highest unit echelon levels. Only 5% of chief warrant officers occupy this grade.\n\n===Today===\nThe role and purpose of the Chief Warrant Officer in the United States Marine Corps fulfills the responsibilities as a high-rank 'Subject Matter Expert' within their chosen craft (military occupation specialty [MOS]), and the additional authority of a Commissioned Officer.\n\nThe Chief Warrant Officers commonly provide their respective Marine units and sections, valuable practical experience, and a master level of technical proficiency. Normally, a Unrestricted officer (2ndLt-General) would not have the opportunity to achieve such specialized skills due to their career progression track being more Commander-Centric and less MOS technical as they advance through the ranks.\n\nOnly active-duty enlisted (non-commissioned officers) are accepted into the program. Currently, there are two selection program distinctions, with each its own separate qualifications: administration-oriented or field-oriented.\n\nThe administrative Warrant Officer Selection Program requires a minimum of eight years of active-duty enlistment (not commissioned), proof and/or demonstration of their exceedingly technical proficiency within their MOS field, and achieved the rank and pay grade of Sergeant (E-5) or above.\n\n{{Multiple image\n|header    = U.S. Marine Corps Infantry Weapons Officer 'Gunner' insignia\n|width     = 110\n|image1    = USMC CWO Gunner (Dress).png\n|image2    = USMC CWO Gunner (Black).png\n}}\n{{See also|Infantry Weapons Officer}}\n\nHowever, the duties of an [[Infantry Weapons Officer]] is much more demanding. The Infantry Weapons Officer Program requires a minimum of sixteen years in MOS 0300 (Infantry) and achieved at least the rank and grade of [[Gunnery Sergeant]] (E-7).\n\nWhen either Marine (administrative or field [infantry]) is selected for the program, they are given additional leadership and management training during the Warrant Officer Basic Course (WOBC), conducted at [[The Basic School]], in [[Quantico, Virginia]].<ref name=\"marines\">[http://www.quantico.usmc.mil/Sentry/StoryView.aspx?SID=677 General Emphasizes Leadership at Warrant Officer Commissioning] 2nd Lt.

Upon being commissioned as CWO2, selectees underwent warrant officer indoctrination and then flight school for 18 to 30 months. After completion of flight school, selectees were placed in one of four types of squadrons: Shipbased Helicopter Maritime Strike (HSM) or Helicopter Sea Combat (HSC) squadrons, and land-based fixed-wing maritime patrol and reconnaissance (VP) and fleet air reconnaissance (VQ). These pilots and NFOs were then trained to operate the [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3 Orion]], the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries II]], the [[Boeing E-6 Mercury|E-6 Mercury]], or variants of the [[Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk|MH-60 Seahawk]]. Those in the VP community would also eventually qualify to fly the [[Boeing P-8 Poseidon|P-8 Poseidon]] once that aircraft began replacing the P-3 in 2012.

The USAF inherited warrant officer ranks from the Army at its inception in 1947, but their place in the Air Force structure was never made clear. When Congress authorized the creation of two new senior enlisted ranks in each of the five services in 1958 (implementing them in 1959-60), Air Force officials privately concluded that these two new \"super grades\" of [[senior master sergeant]] and [[chief master sergeant]] (styling the incumbents as \"[[Air Force Specialty Code#Enlisted AFSCs|superintendents]]\" vice senior or staff NCOICs as does the USA{{not a typo}} and USMC) could fill all Air Force needs then performed at the warrant officer level.

Chief Warrant officers fill a variety of [[billet#United States usage|billets]] as they can command larger small boat stations and patrol boats, as specialists and supervisors in other technical areas, and as special agents in the [[Coast Guard Investigative Service]]. They wear insignia essentially like that of their Navy counterparts, but with the USCG shield between the rank insignia and the specialty mark, as Coast Guard commissioned officers do with their rank insignia. Like their Navy counterparts, candidates for the rank of chief warrant officer must typically be serving in the chief petty officer grades (E-7 through E-9), however, the Coast Guard also permits selection of first class petty officers (E-6) who are chief petty officer selectees and who are in the top 50% on their advancement list to E-7.

While the ranks are authorized by Congress, each branch of the [[Uniformed services of the United States|uniformed services]] selects, manages and uses warrant officers in slightly different ways. For appointment to the rank of warrant officer one (W\u20111), normally a warrant is approved by the secretary of the respective service.<ref name=\"warrant officer appointment\">[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/571 10 U.S. Code \u00a7\u202f571.

For the chief warrant officer ranks (CW\u20112 to CW\u20115), these warrant officers are commissioned by the President. Both warrant officers and chief warrant officers take the same oath as regular [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned officers]] (O\u20111 to O\u201110).\n\nWarrant officers can and do command [[Detachment (military)|detachments]], [[Military formation|unit]]s, but also activities, vessels, aircraft and armored vehicles, as well as lead, coach, train and counsel subordinates. However, the warrant officer's primary task as a leader is to serve as a technical expert, providing valuable skills, guidance, and expertise to commanders and organizations in their particular field.\n{{TOCLeft}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Rank insignia==\n{| class=\"wikitable center\"\n|+ Modern insignia and grades of U.S. Military Warrant Officers\n!

In 1916, an Army [[Judge Advocate General's Corps|Judge Advocate General]] review determined that field clerks should be members of the military. Legislation in 1916 authorized those positions as military rather than civilian and created the ranks of Army Field Clerk (the former rank of Headquarters Clerk) and Quarter Master Corps Field Clerk (the former rank of Pay Clerk). In July, 1917, all Field Clerks were considered enlisted and were assigned an enlisted uniform. Their branch insignia was two crossed quill pens (worn on a disk pin on the left side of the standing collar and a freework insignia on the visored cap).\n\nIn 19 December 1917, ''Special Regulation 41'' stated that the Army Field Clerk and Quarter Master Corps Field Clerk ranks were authorized the same uniform as an officer. Their rank insignia was now a freework pin of crossed quill pens on either side of the freework \"U.S.\" pins worn on the standing collar of the M1909 tunic. They were not permitted the brown mohair cuff braid band of an Army officer, but were authorized a silver-and-black braid hatcord for wear with the M1911 Campaign Hat and the officer's \"G.I. Eagle\" on the M1902 peaked cap.\n\nOn 9 July 1918, Congress established the rank and grade of warrant officer concurrent with establishing the Army [[Mine Planter Service (U.S. Army)|Mine Planter Service]] (AMPS)<ref>http://www.militarymuseum.org/Mines.html | The California State Military Museum - Forts Under the Sea - Submarine Mine Defense of San Francisco Bay</ref> within the [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps|Coast Artillery Corps]]. Creation of the Mine Planter Service replaced an informal service crewed by civilians, replacing them with military personnel, of whom the vessel's master, mates, chief engineer, and assistant engineers were Army warrant officers. Warrant officer rank was indicated by rings of brown cord worn on the lower sleeve of the uniform jacket: two for 2nd Mate and 2nd Assistant Engineer, three for 1st Mate and Assistant Engineer, and four for Ship's Master and Chief Engineer.\n\n{{multiple image\n| header   = U.S. Army Warrant Officer rank insignia from 1941 to 1949\n| width    = 45\n| image1   = FlightOfficerWW2.jpg\n| caption1 = Flight Officer\n| image2   = JuniorWarrantWW2.jpg\n| caption2 = Warrant Officer\n| image3   = ChiefWarrantWW2.jpg\n| caption3 = Chief Warrant Officer\n}}\n{{anchor|W1|WOJG}}Since that time, the position of warrant officer in the Army has been refined. On 21 August 1941, under {{USPL|77|230}}, Congress authorized two grades: warrant officer (junior grade) and chief warrant officer. In 1942, temporary appointments in about 40 occupational areas were made.\nThe insignia for warrant officer (junior grade) was a gold bar {{convert|3/8|in|cm}} wide and {{convert|1|in|cm}} long, rounded at the ends with brown enamel on top and a latitudinal center of gold {{sfrac|1|8}} (0.32&nbsp;cm) inch wide. The insignia for chief warrant officer was a gold bar {{convert|3/8|in|cm}} in width and {{convert|1|in|cm}} in length with rounded ends, brown enamel on top with a longitudinal center stripe of gold {{convert|1/8|in|cm}} wide. The brown enamel backing of the warrant officer insignia was based on the color of the sleeve insignia of rank for ship's officers of the AMPS.<ref name=\"WO-1\">{{cite web|url=http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/wocc/woprogram.asp#history|title=Warrant Officer History|publisher=U.S. Army Warrant Officer Career College|accessdate=14 November 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"tioh_rank\">http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/UniformedServices/Insignia_Rank/warrant_officers.aspx |Insignia of Grade Warrant - Officers</ref><ref>[http://www.usawoa.org/stivers2announced.htm Ship's officers]</ref>\n\nOn 18 July 1942 {{USPL|77|658}}, the Flight Officer Act, was enacted, creating the rank of [[flight officer]], equivalent to warrant officer (junior grade) and assigned to the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]] (USAAF). Insignia was the same as for a warrant officer (junior grade), except the backing was in blue enamel rather than brown. Most flight officers were graduates of various USAAF flight-training programs, including power and glider pilots, and navigator and bombardier ratings. Graduates were appointed to the rating of flight officer, but some of each graduating class were commissioned as [[second lieutenant]]s. Once reaching operational units and after gaining flying experience, flight officers were later offered direct commissions as lieutenants.\n\nFlight sergeants, who were assigned as transport and glider pilots, were appointed as flight officers when the new rank was created. Some of the first eligible flight officers were Americans who had served as sergeant pilots in the [[Royal Air Force]] and who transferred to the USAAF after the U.S. entered the war.\n\nIn November 1942, the War Department defined the rank order as having warrant officers above all enlisted grades and below all commissioned grades. In March 1944, the first six women were appointed to the warrant officer grades as Band Leaders and administrative specialists.\n\nIn 1947, legislation was sought to introduce four grades of warrant officers. Proposed rank titles were: chief warrant officer, senior warrant officer, warrant officer first class, and warrant officer.\n\nIn 1949, {{USPL|81|351}}, the Career Compensation Act, created four pay grades, W-1 through W-4, for all the armed services. The two warrant ranks were unchanged, but warrant officer (junior grade) was pay grade W-1, while chief warrant officer started at W-2 and could advance to W-3 and -4.\n\nIn late 1949, the Warrant Officer Flight Program was created, which trained thousands of warrant officer pilots. The personnel were to be trained by the US Air Force, but controlled by the US Army Transportation Corps. The first helicopter pilot class was 51A (April 1951 to December 1951), which was trained to fly [[Sikorsky H-19 Chickasaw|H-19 Chickasaws]]. The program was temporarily cancelled in 1959 due to military budget cuts, but was reinstated in 1963 to meet the increased demand.\n\n{{multiple image\n| header   = U.S. Army Warrant Officer rank insignia from 1956 to 2004\n| width1   = 45\n| image1   = US Army WO-1 1950-1972.png\n| caption1 = WO1 (1956-1972)\n| width2   = 45\n| image2   = US Army CW-2 1950-1972.png\n| caption2 = CW2 (1956\u20131972)\n| width3   = 45\n| image3   = US Army CW-3 1950-1972.png\n| caption3 = CW3 (1956\u20131972)\n| width4   = 45\n| image4   = US Army CW-4 1950-1972.png\n| caption4 = CW4 (1956-1972)\n| width5   = 41\n| image5   = US-Army-CW5old.svg\n| caption5 = CW5 (1991\u20132004)\n}}\nIn 1954, the Warrant Officer Act, {{USPL|83|379}}, created separate ranks for each pay grade, W-1 through W-4. On 10 September 1956, AR 670-5 authorized the approved insignia for the new ranks that consisted of a metal frame around a brown enamel bar. The insignia for Warrant Officer 1 (Grade W-1) and Chief Warrant Officer 2 (Grade W-2) was a gold metal frame with one or two horizontal metal bands across it. Chief Warrant Officer 3 and Chief Warrant Officer 4 had a silver frame with one or two horizontal bands across it.\n\nDue to the demand for helicopter pilots in Vietnam, the number of warrant officer pilots grew from about 2,960 in 1966 to more than 12,000 by 1970. In 1973, a reduction in force began and chief warrant officer helicopter pilots were offered promotion to the rank of first lieutenant to retain combat veterans.\n\nOn 10 June 1970, the Army adopted a redesigned warrant officer insignia that was easier to identify. It was a silver bar with one to four black enamel squares on it (one per level of rank). \"In July 1972, Army Warrant Officers began wearing the newly designed silver rank insignia, with black squares...\"<ref>[https://warrantofficerhistory.org/Hist_of_Army_WO.htm#1950-1974 \"Army Warrant Officer History 1950\u20131974\"].

Candidates were drawn from Chief Warrant Officer 4s (CW4) who had attended a special course at the Warrant Officer school at Fort Rucker. The first class graduated in 8 December 1988. The Warrant Officer Management Act {{USPL|102|190}} of 5 December 1991, created the paygrade of W5 and the separate rank of Master Warrant Officer (CW5), since renamed as Chief Warrant Officer Five.\n\nOn 9 July 2004 the Warrant Officer Branch insignia (also known as the \"Eagle Rising\" or \"Squashed Bug\") was discontinued.<ref>[http://www.cavhooah.com/info/index.php/join-the-cav/warrant-officers/warrant-insignia/ \"Warrant officers to sport branch insignia\"] by Sgt. 1st Class Marcia Triggs.

Through progressive levels of expertise in assignments, training, and education, the warrant officer administers, manages, maintains, operates, and integrates Army systems and equipment across the full spectrum of Army operations. Warrant officers are innovative integrators of emerging technologies, dynamic teachers, confident warfighters, and developers of specialized teams of soldiers. They support a wide range of Army missions throughout their careers. Warrant officers in the Army are accessed with specific levels of technical ability. They refine their technical expertise and develop their leadership and management skills through tiered progressive assignment and education. The following are specific characteristics and responsibilities of the separate, successive warrant officer grades:\n\na. Warrant officer one (WO1) / chief warrant officer two (CW2): A WO1 is an officer appointed by warrant with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position given by the Secretary of the Army. CW2s and above are commissioned officers with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position as given by the President of the United States. WO1's and CW2's primary focus is becoming proficient and working on those systems linked directly to their AOC/MOS, that is, their area of concentration (officer AOC), or an enlisted rank's military occupational specialty (MOS). Warrant officers are classified by warrant officer military occupational specialty, or WOMOS. As they become experts on the systems they operate and maintain, their focus migrates to integrating their systems with other branch systems.\n\nb. Chief warrant officer three (CW3): The CW3s are advanced level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of technical leader, trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator, and advisor. They also perform any other branch-related duties assigned to them. As they become more senior, their focus becomes integrating branch systems into larger Army systems. \n \nc.

However, Congress did not authorize W-5 until 1991 and as of January 2017 has not approved W-6. The original W-5 insignia consisted of a single silver bar superimposed with four equally spaced silver squares with each square bordered in black. In 2004, this insignia was changed to a single silver bar surmounted by a single, narrow, vertical, black stripe. The proposed CW6 insignia had two narrow, vertical, parallel, black stripes.<ref>https://warrantofficerhistory.org/Hist_Army_CW5_Insignia.htm. Retrieved 17 January 2017.

Those appointed would be selected from the noncommissioned officer ranks.\n\nOn 26 August 1916, Congress increased the Marine Corps strength, which included adding the rank of warrant officer; 43 Marine Gunners and 41 Quartermaster Clerks would be appointed. The first Marine Gunner is believed to have been [[Henry L. Hulbert]].<ref>Bevilacqua, Allan C. Major USMC (Ret) ''Henry Lewis Hurlbert-Marine Gunner'' ''Leatherneck'' Dec 2008 Vol XCI No 12</ref> On 22 May 1917, due to commissioned officer shortages, all but three of the appointees were commissioned as temporary second lieutenants. In 1918, the grade of pay clerk was added.\n\nIn June, 1926, Congress created the commissioned warrant grades of Chief Marine Gunner, Chief Quartermaster Clerk, and Chief Pay Clerk. Requirements for promotion to chief warrant officer were six years of service as a warrant officer and an examination to qualify.\n\nDuring World War II, Congress abolished the titles of Marine Gunner, Chief Marine Gunner, Quartermaster Clerk, Chief Quartermaster Clerk, Pay Clerk, and Chief Pay Clerk. Instead, they would be designated warrant officer or commissioned warrant officer. In 1943, all Marine warrant officer ranks were aligned with the other services. They were warrant officer and commissioned warrant officer.\n\nThen in 1949, the grade of WO (paygrade W-1) was created for warrant officers and CWO-2, CWO-3, and CWO-4 (paygrades W-2, W-3, and W-4) were created for commissioned warrant officers. In 1954, title \"Chief Warrant Officer\" replaced \"commissioned warrant officer\" for those in grades CWO-2, CWO-3 and CWO-4.\n\nOn 1 February 1992, the grade of CWO-5 (paygrade W-5) was created and those who are appointed serve on the highest unit echelon levels. Only 5% of chief warrant officers occupy this grade.\n\n===Today===\nThe role and purpose of the Chief Warrant Officer in the United States Marine Corps fulfills the responsibilities as a high-rank 'Subject Matter Expert' within their chosen craft (military occupation specialty [MOS]), and the additional authority of a Commissioned Officer.\n\nThe Chief Warrant Officers commonly provide their respective Marine units and sections, valuable practical experience, and a master level of technical proficiency. Normally, a Unrestricted officer (2ndLt-General) would not have the opportunity to achieve such specialized skills due to their career progression track being more Commander-Centric and less MOS technical as they advance through the ranks.\n\nOnly active-duty enlisted (non-commissioned officers) are accepted into the program. Currently, there are two selection program distinctions, with each its own separate qualifications: administration-oriented or field-oriented.\n\nThe administrative Warrant Officer Selection Program requires a minimum of eight years of active-duty enlistment (not commissioned), proof and/or demonstration of their exceedingly technical proficiency within their MOS field, and achieved the rank and pay grade of Sergeant (E-5) or above.\n\n{{Multiple image\n|header    = U.S. Marine Corps Infantry Weapons Officer 'Gunner' insignia\n|width     = 110\n|image1    = USMC CWO Gunner (Dress).png\n|image2    = USMC CWO Gunner (Black).png\n}}\n{{See also|Infantry Weapons Officer}}\n\nHowever, the duties of an [[Infantry Weapons Officer]] is much more demanding. The Infantry Weapons Officer Program requires a minimum of sixteen years in MOS 0300 (Infantry) and achieved at least the rank and grade of [[Gunnery Sergeant]] (E-7).\n\nWhen either Marine (administrative or field [infantry]) is selected for the program, they are given additional leadership and management training during the Warrant Officer Basic Course (WOBC), conducted at [[The Basic School]], in [[Quantico, Virginia]].<ref name=\"marines\">[http://www.quantico.usmc.mil/Sentry/StoryView.aspx?SID=677 General Emphasizes Leadership at Warrant Officer Commissioning] 2nd Lt.

Upon being commissioned as CWO2, selectees underwent warrant officer indoctrination and then flight school for 18 to 30 months. After completion of flight school, selectees were placed in one of four types of squadrons: Shipbased Helicopter Maritime Strike (HSM) or Helicopter Sea Combat (HSC) squadrons, and land-based fixed-wing maritime patrol and reconnaissance (VP) and fleet air reconnaissance (VQ). These pilots and NFOs were then trained to operate the [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3 Orion]], the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries II]], the [[Boeing E-6 Mercury|E-6 Mercury]], or variants of the [[Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk|MH-60 Seahawk]].

The USAF inherited warrant officer ranks from the Army at its inception in 1947, but their place in the Air Force structure was never made clear. When Congress authorized the creation of two new senior enlisted ranks in each of the five services in 1958 (implementing them in 1959-60), Air Force officials privately concluded that these two new \"super grades\" of [[senior master sergeant]] and [[chief master sergeant]] (styling the incumbents as \"[[Air Force Specialty Code#Enlisted AFSCs|superintendents]]\" vice senior or staff NCOICs as does the USA{{not a typo}} and USMC) could fill all Air Force needs then performed at the warrant officer level. This was not publicly acknowledged until years later. The Air Force stopped appointing warrant officers in 1959.<ref name=\"WO-5\" />\n\nThe last active-duty air force chief warrant officer, CWO4 James H. Long, retired in 1980.

Warrant Officers may serve as officers-in-charge of [[Coast Guard Stations]], or even as Command warrant officers. Chief Warrant officers fill a variety of [[billet#United States usage|billets]] as they can command larger small boat stations and patrol boats, as specialists and supervisors in other technical areas, and as special agents in the [[Coast Guard Investigative Service]]. They wear insignia essentially like that of their Navy counterparts, but with the USCG shield between the rank insignia and the specialty mark, as Coast Guard commissioned officers do with their rank insignia. Like their Navy counterparts, candidates for the rank of chief warrant officer must typically be serving in the chief petty officer grades (E-7 through E-9), however, the Coast Guard also permits selection of first class petty officers (E-6) who are chief petty officer selectees and who are in the top 50% on their advancement list to E-7.  The Coast Guard does not use the rank of warrant officer (WO-1). Although authorized in 1994, the Coast Guard does not currently use or have any active CWO5 grade.<ref>United States Coast Guard.

Having attended Mount Saint Joseph College in Roscrea, he entered [[University College Dublin]], where he obtained a BE civil engineering degree and BSc degree. He subsequently went on to get a master's degree in UCD before marrying Elizabeth Ann (Lilian) Mulleaney and emigrating to England, where he secured a job with leading construction steelmaker [[Dorman Long]].\n\nIn 1947 he secured a post as senior lecturer in [[Leeds University]], where he obtained a PhD in 1951. \nThen in 1953, he was invited to take up the newly created head of engineering post at the fledgling [[Indian Institute of Technology]] in Kharagpur, Eastern India. His teaching philosophy was always to encourage a 'practical' hands-on approach to engineering, and to this end, he encouraged his students to embark on a project to design and build a swimming pool complex on the institute's campus.\n\nFinally in 1956, he moved to the [[University of Hong Kong]] to take up the post of Taikoo Professor of Engineering. \nWithin a few years he had expanded the engineering faculty from one department to four, and later went on to be appointed dean of the joint Faculty of Engineering and Architecture. \nOutside of academia, he was a founding council member of the Hong Kong Management Association in 1960.\n \nDuring his time in the University of Hong Kong, he initiated an intensive research programme studying the effects of wind on tall buildings, attracting global interest and culminating in an International Seminar in 1961.[https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/professor-sean-mackey-1.112027][https://books.google.com/books?id=Mc4fPWocyykC&pg=PA98&lpg=PA98&dq=sean+mackey+hong+kong&source=bl&ots=HvmicR-qIY&sig=oWcN60ma_nfoNvvXmUHThia9-pY&hl=en&ei=frqgS8CaIoWUjAeOmbj4DQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CBIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=sean%20mackey%20hong%20kong&f=false][http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/27577329?selectedversion=NBD2550686] 1968 saw him help set up and become the first president of, the Hong Kong branch of the [[Institution of Structural Engineers]]. \nIn 1962 he was elected president of the Hong Kong St Patrick's Society [http://www.stpatrickshk.com/history/] and was also for many years, a Steward of the prestigious [[Hong Kong Jockey Club]]. He also founded and chaired the Colony's 'British Engineering Week' in 1966, which was opened by the late [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]].

Having attended Mount Saint Joseph College in Roscrea, he entered [[University College Dublin]], where he obtained a BE civil engineering degree and BSc degree. He subsequently went on to get a master's degree in UCD before marrying Elizabeth Ann (Lilian) Mulleaney and emigrating to England, where he secured a job with leading construction steelmaker [[Dorman Long]].\n\nIn 1947 he secured a post as senior lecturer in [[Leeds University]], where he obtained a PhD in 1951. \nThen in 1953, he was invited to take up the newly created head of engineering post at the fledgling [[Indian Institute of Technology]] in Kharagpur, Eastern India. His teaching philosophy was always to encourage a 'practical' hands-on approach to engineering, and to this end, he encouraged his students to embark on a project to design and build a swimming pool complex on the institute's campus.\n\nFinally in 1956, he moved to the [[University of Hong Kong]] to take up the post of Taikoo Professor of Engineering. \nWithin a few years he had expanded the engineering faculty from one department to four, and later went on to be appointed dean of the joint Faculty of Engineering and Architecture. \nOutside of academia, he was a founding council member of the Hong Kong Management Association in 1960.\n \nDuring his time in the University of Hong Kong, he initiated an intensive research programme studying the effects of wind on tall buildings, attracting global interest and culminating in an International Seminar in 1961.[https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/professor-sean-mackey-1.112027][https://books.google.com/books?id=Mc4fPWocyykC&pg=PA98&lpg=PA98&dq=sean+mackey+hong+kong&source=bl&ots=HvmicR-qIY&sig=oWcN60ma_nfoNvvXmUHThia9-pY&hl=en&ei=frqgS8CaIoWUjAeOmbj4DQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CBIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=sean%20mackey%20hong%20kong&f=false][http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/27577329?selectedversion=NBD2550686] 1968 saw him help set up and become, the first president of the Hong Kong branch of the [[Institution of Structural Engineers]]. \nIn 1962 he was elected president of the Hong Kong St Patrick's Society [http://www.stpatrickshk.com/history/] and was also for many years, a Steward of the prestigious [[Hong Kong Jockey Club]]. He also founded and chaired the Colony's 'British Engineering Week' in 1966, which was opened by the late [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]].
