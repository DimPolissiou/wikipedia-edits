In his book ''[[South from Granada (book)|South from Granada]]'', [[Gerald Brenan]] claims that the melody was from an old Spanish [[ballad]], made popular by [[Mexico|Mexican]] miners during the [[California Gold Rush]]. It was best known from ''Romance del Conde Olinos o Ni\u00f1o'', a sad love story very popular in Spanish-speaking cultures. It was also given various [[English language|English]] translations. No particular source is cited to verify that the song he used to hear in the 1920s in a remote [[Spain|Spanish]] village was not an old text with new music, but Brenan states in his preface that all the information in his book has been checked reasonably well.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brenan |first1=Gerald |title=South from Granada |date=1957 |publisher=Penguin |location=Cambridge |isbn=9780141189321 |page=119 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=Lw84AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA109&lpg=PA109&dq=donde+vas+buen+caballero+clementine&source=bl&ots=sNipIFXWPw&sig=24HGULxbHpp31PaPcb7KwI8DPIk&hl=es&sa=X&ei=10a7UqvOJ6mw0AXjxYCgDg#v=onepage&q=donde%20vas%20buen%20caballero%20clementine&f=false |accessdate=19 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nIt is unclear when, where and by whom the song was first recorded in English, but the first version to reach the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts was that by [[Bing Crosby]] recorded on June 14, 1941,<ref>{{cite web|title=A Bing Crosby Discography|url=http://www.bingmagazine.co.uk/bingmagazine/crosby1bDecca.html|website=BING magazine|publisher=International Club Crosby|accessdate=August 19, 2017}}</ref> which briefly reached the No. 20 spot.

It was best known from ''Romance del Conde Olinos o Ni\u00f1o'', a sad love story very popular in Spanish-speaking cultures. It was also given various [[English language|English]] translations. No particular source is cited to verify that the song he used to hear in the 1920s in a remote [[Spain|Spanish]] village was not an old text with new music, but Brenan states in his preface that all the information in his book has been checked reasonably well.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brenan |first1=Gerald |title=South from Granada |date=1957 |publisher=Penguin |location=Cambridge |isbn=9780141189321 |page=119 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=Lw84AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA109&lpg=PA109&dq=donde+vas+buen+caballero+clementine&source=bl&ots=sNipIFXWPw&sig=24HGULxbHpp31PaPcb7KwI8DPIk&hl=es&sa=X&ei=10a7UqvOJ6mw0AXjxYCgDg#v=onepage&q=donde%20vas%20buen%20caballero%20clementine&f=false |accessdate=19 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nIt is unclear when, where and by whom the song was first recorded in English, but the first version to reach the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts was that by [[Bing Crosby]] recorded on June 14, 1941,<ref>{{cite web|title=A Bing Crosby Discography|url=http://www.bingmagazine.co.uk/bingmagazine/crosby1bDecca.html|website=BING magazine|publisher=International Club Crosby|accessdate=August 19, 2017}}</ref> which briefly reached the No. 20 spot.

Blood vessels on the surface of a cyst may tear and bleed into the cyst (intracystic [[hemorrhage]]), increasing its size. If a blood vessel bleeds on the outside of a cyst, a collection of blood ([[hematoma]]) may result. In the cases of intracystic hemorrhage and hematoma, the individual may have symptoms of increased pressure within the cranium and signs of compression of nearby nerve (neural) tissue.\n\nSome scientists debate whether arachnoid cysts are a true congenite condition or if this should be separated from secondary cysts.<ref name=\"pmid22411232\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Westermaier T, Schweitzer T, Ernestus RI | title = Arachnoid cysts | journal = Adv.

He was also the first to recognize the difference between conscious [[selective breeding]] in which humans directly select for desirable traits, and unconscious selection where traits evolve as a by-product of [[natural selection]] or from selection on other traits.<ref name=darwin1868/><ref name=diamond2007/><ref name=larson2014b/> There is a genetic difference between domestic and wild populations. There is also a genetic difference between the domestication traits that researchers believe to have been essential at the early stages of domestication, and the improvement traits that have appeared since the split between wild and domestic populations.<ref name=olsen2013/><ref name=doust2014/><ref name=larson2014/> Domestication traits are generally fixed within all domesticates, and were selected during the initial episode of domestication of that animal or plant, whereas improvement traits are present only in a proportion of domesticates, though they may be fixed in individual breeds or [[Landrace|regional populations]].<ref name=doust2014/><ref name=larson2014/><ref name=meyer2013/>\n\nDomestication should not be confused with [[tame animal|taming]]. Taming is the conditioned behavioral modification of a wild-born animal when its natural avoidance of humans is reduced and it accepts the presence of humans, but domestication is the permanent genetic modification of a bred lineage that leads to an inherited predisposition toward humans.<ref name=price2008/><ref name=macdonald2009/><ref name=diamond2012/> Certain animal species, and certain individuals within those species, make better candidates for domestication than others because they exhibit certain behavioral characteristics: (1) the size and organization of their social structure; (2) the availability and the degree of selectivity in their choice of mates; (3) the ease and speed with which the parents bond with their young, and the maturity and mobility of the young at birth; (4) the degree of flexibility in diet and habitat tolerance; and (5) responses to humans and new environments, including flight responses and reactivity to external stimuli.<ref name=zeder2012/>{{rp|Fig 1}}<ref name=hale1969/><ref name=price1984/><ref name=price2002/>\n\nIt is proposed that there were three major pathways that most animal domesticates followed into domestication: (1) commensals, adapted to a human niche (e.g., [[Domestication of the dog|dogs]], cats, fowl, possibly pigs); (2) prey animals sought for food (e.g., sheep, goats, cattle, water buffalo, yak, pig, reindeer, llama, alpaca, and turkey); and (3) targeted animals for draft and nonfood resources (e.g., [[Domestication of the horse|horse]], donkey, camel).<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=frantz2015b/><ref name=marshall2014/><ref name=blaustein2015/><ref name=telechea2015/><ref name=vahabi2015/><ref name=gepts2012/><ref name=pontarotti2015/> The dog was the first to be domesticated,<ref name=larson2012/><ref name=perri2016/> and was established across [[Eurasia]] before the end of the [[Late Pleistocene]] era, well before [[Agriculture|cultivation]] and before the domestication of other animals.<ref name=larson2012/> Unlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors.<ref name=serpell2014/><ref name=cagan2016/> The archaeological and genetic data suggest that long-term bidirectional [[gene flow]] between wild and domestic stocks \u2013 including [[donkey]]s, [[horse]]s, New and Old World [[camelid]]s, [[goat]]s, [[sheep]], and [[pig]]s \u2013 was common.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=marshall2014/> One study has concluded that human selection for domestic traits likely counteracted the homogenizing effect of gene flow from wild boars into pigs and created [[domestication islands]] in the genome. The same process may also apply to other domesticated animals.<ref name=frantz2015/><ref name=pennisi2015/>\n\n==Definitions==\n\n===Domestication===\n\nDomestication has been defined as \"a sustained multi-generational, [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship in which one [[organism]] assumes a significant degree of influence over the [[reproduction]] and care of another organism in order to secure a more predictable supply of a resource of interest, and through which the [[Symbiosis|partner organism]] gains advantage over individuals that remain outside this relationship, thereby benefitting and often increasing the [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of both the domesticator and the target domesticate.\"<ref name=zeder2015/><ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=maggioni2015/><ref name=smith2014/><ref name=sykes2014/> This definition recognizes both the biological and the cultural components of the domestication process and the effects on both humans and the domesticated animals and plants. All past definitions of domestication have included a relationship between humans with plants and animals, but their differences lay in who was considered as the lead partner in the relationship. This new definition recognizes a mutualistic relationship in which both partners gain benefits. Domestication has vastly enhanced the reproductive output of crop plants, livestock, and pets far beyond that of their wild progenitors. Domesticates have provided humans with resources that they could more predictably and securely control, move, and redistribute, which has been the advantage that had fueled a population explosion of the agro-pastoralists and their spread to all corners of the planet.<ref name=zeder2012/>\n\nThis [[Mutualism (biology)|biological mutualism]] is not restricted to humans with domestic crops and livestock but is well-documented in nonhuman species, especially among a number of social insect domesticators and their plant and animal domesticates, for example the [[ant\u2013fungus mutualism]] that exists between [[leafcutter ants]] and certain fungi.<ref name=zeder2015/>\n\n===Domestication syndrome===\n\nDomestication syndrome is a term often used to describe the suite of [[phenotype|phenotypic]] traits arising during domestication that distinguish crops from their wild ancestors.<ref name=olsen2013/><ref name=hammer1984/> The term is also applied to animals and includes  increased docility and tameness, coat color changes, reductions in tooth size, changes in craniofacial morphology, alterations in ear and tail form (e.g., floppy ears), more frequent and nonseasonal estrus cycles, alterations in adrenocorticotropic hormone levels, changed concentrations of several neurotransmitters, prolongations in juvenile behavior, and reductions in both total brain size and of particular brain regions.<ref name=wilkins2014/>\n\n===Difference from taming===\n\nDomestication should not be confused with [[tame animal|taming]]. Taming is the conditioned behavioral modification of a wild-born animal when its natural avoidance of humans is reduced and it accepts the presence of humans, but domestication is the permanent genetic modification of a bred lineage that leads to an inherited predisposition toward humans.<ref name=price2008/><ref name=macdonald2009/><ref name=diamond2012/> Human selection included tameness, but without a suitable evolutionary response then domestication was not achieved.<ref name=larson2014/> Domestic animals need not be tame in the behavioral sense, such as the Spanish fighting bull. Wild animals can be tame, such as a hand-raised cheetah. A domestic animal's breeding is controlled by humans and its tameness and tolerance of humans is genetically determined. However, an animal merely bred in captivity is not necessarily domesticated. Tigers, gorillas, and polar bears breed readily in captivity but are not domesticated.<ref name=macdonald2009/> Asian elephants are wild animals that with taming manifest outward signs of domestication, yet their breeding is not human controlled and thus they are not true domesticates.<ref name=macdonald2009/><ref name=lair1997/>\n\n==Cause and timing==\n{{further|History of agriculture}}\n\nThe domestication of animals and plants was triggered by the climatic and environmental changes that occurred after the peak of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] around 21,000 years ago and which continue to this present day. These changes made obtaining food difficult. The first domesticate was the [[wolf]] (''Canis lupus'') at least 15,000 years ago. The [[Younger Dryas]] that occurred 12,900 years ago was a period of intense cold and aridity that put pressure on humans to intensify their foraging strategies. By the beginning of the [[Holocene]] from 11,700 years ago, favorable climatic conditions and increasing human populations led to small-scale animal and plant domestication, which allowed humans to augment the food that they were obtaining through [[Hunter-gatherer|hunter-gathering]].<ref name=McHugo2019/>\n\nThe [[Neolithic transition]] led to agricultural societies emerging in locations across Eurasia, North Africa, and South and Central America. In the [[Fertile Crescent]] 10,000-11,000 years ago, [[zooarchaeology]] indicates that goats, pigs, sheep, and [[taurine cattle]] were the first livestock to be domesticated. Two thousand years later, humped [[zebu]] cattle were domesticated in what is today [[Baluchistan]] in Pakistan. In [[East Asia]] 8,000 years ago, pigs were domesticated from wild boar that were genetically different from those found in the Fertile Crescent. The horse was domesticated on the Central Asian steppe 5,500 years ago. Both the chicken in Southeast Asia and the cat in Egypt were domesticated 4,000 years ago.<ref name=McHugo2019/>\n\nThe sudden appearance of the [[domestic dog]] (''Canis lupus familiaris'') in the archaeological record then led to a rapid shift in the [[evolution]], [[ecology]], and [[demography]] of both humans and numerous species of animals and plants.<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=larson2014/> It was followed by livestock and crop domestication, and the transition of humans from foraging to farming in different places and times across the planet.<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=fuller2011/><ref name=zeder2006/> Around 10,000 YBP, a new way of life emerged for humans through the management and exploitation of plant and animal species, leading to higher-density populations in the centers of domestication,<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=bocquet2011/> the expansion of agricultural economies, and the development of urban communities.<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=barker2006/>\n\n==Universal features==\nThe biomass of wild vertebrates is now increasingly small compared to the biomass of domestic animals, with the calculated biomass of domestic cattle alone being greater than that of all wild mammals.<ref name=smil2011/> Because the evolution of domestic animals is ongoing, the process of domestication has a beginning but not an end. Various criteria have been established to provide a definition of domestic animals, but all decisions about exactly when an animal can be labelled \"domesticated\" in the zoological sense are arbitrary, although potentially useful.<ref name=larson2013/>\nDomestication is a fluid and nonlinear process that may start, stop, reverse, or go down unexpected paths with no clear or universal threshold that separates the wild from the domestic. However, there are universal features held in common by all domesticated animals.<ref name=zeder2012/>\n\n===Behavioral preadaption===\nCertain animal species, and certain individuals within those species, make better candidates for domestication than others because they exhibit certain behavioral characteristics: (1) the size and organization of their social structure; (2) the availability and the degree of selectivity in their choice of mates; (3) the ease and speed with which the parents bond with their young, and the maturity and mobility of the young at birth; (4) the degree of flexibility in diet and habitat tolerance; and (5) responses to humans and new environments, including flight responses and reactivity to external stimuli.<ref name=zeder2012/>{{rp|Fig 1}}<ref name=hale1969/><ref name=price1984/><ref name=price2002/> Reduced wariness to humans and low reactivity to both humans and other external stimuli are a key pre-adaptation for domestication, and these behaviors are also the primary target of the selective pressures experienced by the animal undergoing domestication.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=zeder2012/> This implies that not all animals can be domesticated, e.g. a wild member of the horse family, the [[Zebra#Domestication|Zebra]].<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=zeder2006/>\n\n[[Jared Diamond]] in his book ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'' enquired as to why, among the world's 148 large wild terrestrial herbivorous mammals, only 14 were domesticated, and proposed that their wild ancestors must have possessed six characteristics before they could be considered for domestication:<ref name=diamond2007/>{{rp|p168-174}}\n[[File:Cows in green field - nullamunjie olive grove03.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Hereford cattle, domesticated for beef production.]]\n\n#Efficient diet&nbsp;\u2013 Animals that can efficiently process what they eat and live off plants are less expensive to keep in captivity. Carnivores feed on flesh, which would require the domesticators to raise additional animals to feed the carnivores and therefore increase the consumption of plants further.\n#Quick growth rate&nbsp;\u2013 Fast maturity rate compared to the human life span allows breeding intervention and makes the animal useful within an acceptable duration of caretaking. Some large animals require many years before they reach a useful size.\n#Ability to breed in captivity&nbsp;\u2013 Animals that will not breed in captivity are limited to acquisition through capture in the wild.\n#Pleasant disposition&nbsp;\u2013 Animals with nasty dispositions are dangerous to keep around humans.\n#Tendency not to panic&nbsp;\u2013 Some species are nervous, fast, and prone to flight when they perceive a threat.\n#Social structure&nbsp;\u2013 All species of domesticated large mammals had wild ancestors that lived in herds with a dominance hierarchy amongst the herd members, and the herds had overlapping home territories rather than mutually exclusive home territories. This arrangement allows humans to take control of the dominance hierarchy.\n\n===Brain size and function===\n[[File:Unnatural selection, 2 heads, one species.jpg|thumb|right|Reduction in skull size with neoteny - grey wolf and chihuahua skulls]]\n\nThe sustained selection for lowered reactivity among mammal domesticates has resulted in profound changes in brain form and function. The larger the size of the brain to begin with and the greater its degree of folding, the greater the degree of brain-size reduction under domestication.<ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=kruska1988/> [[domesticated red fox|Foxes that had been selectively bred for tameness over 40 years]] had experienced a significant reduction in cranial height and width and by inference in brain size,<ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=trut1999/> which supports the hypothesis that brain-size reduction is an early response to the selective pressure for tameness and lowered reactivity that is the universal feature of animal domestication.<ref name=zeder2012/> The most affected portion of the brain in domestic mammals is the limbic system, which in domestic dogs, pigs, and sheep show a 40% reduction in size compared with their wild species. This portion of the brain regulates endocrine function that influences behaviors such as aggression, wariness, and responses to environmentally induced stress, all attributes which are dramatically affected by domestication.<ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=kruska1988/>\n\n===Pleiotropy===\nA putative cause for the broad changes seen in domestication syndrome is [[pleiotropy]]. Pleiotropy occurs when one gene influences two or more seemingly unrelated [[phenotypic trait]]s. Certain physiological changes characterize domestic animals of many species. These changes include extensive white markings (particularly on the head), floppy ears, and curly tails. These arise even when tameness is the only trait under selective pressure.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal |last=Trut |first=Lyudmila |last2=Oskina |first2=Irina |last3=Kharlamova |first3=Anastasiya |date=2009 |title=Animal evolution during domestication: the domesticated fox as a model |journal=BioEssays |volume=31|issue=3 |pages=349\u2013360 |doi=10.1002/bies.200800070 |pmc=2763232 |pmid=19260016}}</ref> The genes involved in tameness are largely unknown, so it is not known how or to what extent pleiotropy contributes to domestication syndrome. Tameness may be caused by the [[Downregulation and upregulation|down regulation]] of fear and stress responses via reduction of the [[adrenal gland]]s.<ref name=\":0\" /> Based on this, the pleiotropy hypotheses can be separated into two theories. The Neural Crest Hypothesis relates adrenal gland function to deficits in neural crest cells during development. The Single Genetic Regulatory Network Hypothesis claims that genetic changes in [[Upstream and downstream (DNA)|upstream]] regulators affect downstream systems.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal |last=Wilkins |first=Adam S. |last2=Wrangham |first2=Richard W. |last3=Fitch |first3=W.

Although they do not affect the development of the adrenal cortex directly, the neural crest cells may be involved in relevant upstream embryological interactions.<ref name=\":1\" /> Furthermore, artificial selection targeting tameness may affect genes that control the concentration or movement of NCCs in the embryo, leading to a variety of phenotypes.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe single genetic regulatory network hypothesis proposes that domestication syndrome results from mutations in genes that regulate the expression pattern of more downstream genes.<ref name=\":0\" /> For example piebald, or spotted coat coloration, may be caused by a linkage in the biochemical pathways of melanins involved in coat coloration and neurotransmitters such as dopamine that help shape behavior and cognition.<ref name=\"zeder2012\" /><ref name=\"hemmer1990\" /> These linked traits may arise from mutations in a few key regulatory genes.<ref name=\"zeder2012\" /> A problem with this hypothesis is that it proposes that there are mutations in gene networks that cause dramatic effects that are not lethal, however no currently known genetic regulatory networks cause such dramatic change in so many different traits.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Limited reversion===\nFeral mammals such as dogs, cats, goats, donkeys, pigs, and ferrets that have lived apart from humans for generations show no sign of regaining the brain mass of their wild progenitors.<ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=birks1999/> [[Dingo]]s have lived apart from humans for thousands of years but still have the same brain size as that of a domestic dog.<ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=schultz1969/> Feral dogs that actively avoid human contact are still dependent on human waste for survival and have not reverted to the self-sustaining behaviors of their wolf ancestors.<ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=boitani1995/>\n\n==Categories==\nDomestication can be considered as the final phase of intensification in the relationship between animal or plant sub-populations and human societies, but it is divided into several grades of intensification.<ref name=vigne2011/> For studies in animal domestication, researchers have proposed five distinct categories: wild, captive wild, domestic, cross-breeds and feral.<ref name=price2002/><ref name=mayer1991/><ref name=evin2015/>\n\n; ''Wild'' animals : Subject to natural selection, although the action of past demographic events and artificial selection induced by game management or habitat destruction cannot be excluded.<ref name=evin2015/>\n; ''Captive wild'' animals : Directly affected by a relaxation of natural selection associated with feeding, breeding and protection/confinement by humans, and an intensification of artificial selection through passive selection for animals that are more suited to captivity.<ref name=evin2015/>\n;''Domestic'' animals : Subject to intensified artificial selection through husbandry practices with relaxation of natural selection associated with captivity and management.<ref name=evin2015/>\n;''Cross-breed'' animals : Genetic hybrids of wild and domestic parents. They may be forms intermediate between both parents, forms more similar to one parent than the other, or unique forms distinct from both parents. Hybrids can be intentionally bred for specific characteristics or can arise unintentionally as the result of contact with wild individuals.<ref name=evin2015/>\n;''Feral'' animals : Domesticates that have returned to a wild state. As such, they experience relaxed artificial selection induced by the captive environment paired with intensified natural selection induced by the wild habitat.<ref name=evin2015/>\n\nIn 2015, a study compared the diversity of dental size, shape and allometry across the proposed domestication categories of modern pigs (genus ''Sus''). The study showed clear differences between the dental phenotypes of wild, captive wild, domestic, and hybrid pig populations, which supported the proposed categories through physical evidence. The study did not cover feral pig populations but called for further research to be undertaken on them, and on the genetic differences with hybrid pigs.<ref name=evin2015/>\n\n==Pathways==\nSince 2012, a multi-stage model of animal domestication has been accepted by two groups. The first group proposed that animal domestication proceeded along a continuum of stages from anthropophily, commensalism, control in the wild, control of captive animals, extensive breeding, intensive breeding, and finally to pets in a slow, gradually intensifying relationship between humans and animals.<ref name=larson2013/><ref name=vigne2011/>\n\nThe second group proposed that there were three major pathways that most animal domesticates followed into domestication: (1) commensals, adapted to a human niche (e.g., dogs, cats, fowl, possibly pigs); (2) prey animals sought for food (e.g., sheep, goats, cattle, water buffalo, yak, pig, reindeer, llama and alpaca); and (3) targeted animals for draft and nonfood resources (e.g., horse, donkey, camel).<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=frantz2015b/><ref name=marshall2014/><ref name=blaustein2015/><ref name=telechea2015/><ref name=vahabi2015/><ref name=gepts2012/><ref name=pontarotti2015/> The beginnings of animal domestication involved a protracted [[coevolution]]ary process with multiple stages along different pathways. Humans did not intend to domesticate animals from, or at least they did not envision a domesticated animal resulting from, either the commensal or prey pathways. In both of these cases, humans became entangled with these species as the relationship between them, and the human role in their survival and reproduction, intensified.<ref name=larson2014/> Although the directed pathway proceeded from capture to taming, the other two pathways are not as goal-oriented and archaeological records suggest that they take place over much longer time frames.<ref name=larson2013/>\n\n===Commensal pathway===\nThe [[Commensalism|commensal]] pathway was traveled by vertebrates that fed on refuse around human habitats or by animals that preyed on other animals drawn to human  camps. Those animals established a commensal relationship with humans in which the animals benefited but the humans received no harm but little benefit. Those animals that were most capable of taking advantage of the resources associated with human camps would have been the tamer, less aggressive individuals with shorter fight or flight distances.<ref name=crockford2000/><ref name=coppinger2001/><ref name=russell2012/> Later, these animals developed closer social or economic bonds with humans that led to a domestic relationship.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=frantz2015b/> The leap from a [[Synanthrope|synanthropic]] population to a domestic one could only have taken place after the animals had progressed from anthropophily to habituation, to commensalism and partnership, when the relationship between animal and human would have laid the foundation for domestication, including captivity and human-controlled breeding. From this perspective, animal domestication is a [[coevolution]]ary process in which a population responds to selective pressure while adapting to a novel [[Ecological niche|niche]] that included another species with evolving behaviors.<ref name=larson2014/> Commensal pathway animals include dogs, cats, fowl, and possibly pigs.<ref name=larson2012/>\n\nThe domestication of animals commenced over 15,000&nbsp;[[years before present]] (YBP), beginning with the [[grey wolf]] (''Canis lupus'') by nomadic [[hunter-gatherers]]. It was not until 11,000&nbsp;YBP that people living in the [[Ancient Near East|Near East]] entered into relationships with wild populations of [[aurochs]], boar, sheep, and goats. A domestication process then began to develop. The grey wolf most likely followed the commensal pathway to domestication. When, where, and how many times wolves may have been domesticated remains debated because only a small number of ancient specimens have been found, and both archaeology and genetics continue to provide conflicting evidence. The most widely accepted, earliest dog remains date back 15,000&nbsp;YBP to the [[Origin of the domestic dog#Bonn\u2013Oberkassel dog|Bonn\u2013Oberkassel dog]]. Earlier remains dating back to 30,000&nbsp;YBP have been described as [[Paleolithic dog]]s, however their status as dogs or wolves remains debated. Recent studies indicate that a [[genetic divergence]] occurred between dogs and wolves 20,000\u201340,000&nbsp;YBP, however this is the upper time-limit for domestication because it represents the time of divergence and not the time of domestication.<ref name=irving-pease2018/>\n\nThe chicken is one of the most widespread domesticated species and one of the human world's largest sources of protein. Although the chicken was domesticated in South-East Asia, archaeological evidence suggests that it was not kept as a livestock species until 400&nbsp;[[BCE]] in the [[Levant]].<ref name=perrygal2015/> Prior to this, chickens had been associated with humans for thousands of years and kept for cock-fighting, rituals, and royal zoos, so they were not originally a prey species.<ref name=perrygal2015/><ref name=sykes2012/> The chicken was not a popular food in Europe until only one thousand years ago.<ref name=gibbons2016/>\n\n===Prey pathway===\n[[File:Animal husbandry.jpeg|thumbnail|Domesticated dairy cows in North India]]\nThe prey pathway was the way in which most major livestock species entered into domestication as these were once hunted by humans for their meat. Domestication was likely initiated when humans began to experiment with hunting strategies designed to increase the availability of these prey, perhaps as a response to localized pressure on the supply of the animal. Over time and with the more responsive species, these game-management strategies developed into herd-management strategies that included the sustained multi-generational control over the animals\u2019 movement, feeding, and reproduction. As human interference in the life-cycles of prey animals intensified, the evolutionary pressures for a lack of aggression would have led to an acquisition of the same domestication syndrome traits found in the commensal domesticates.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=frantz2015b/>\n\nPrey pathway animals include sheep, goats, cattle, water buffalo, yak, pig, reindeer, llama and alpaca. The right conditions for the domestication for some of them appear to have been in place in the central and eastern [[Fertile Crescent]] at the end of the [[Younger Dryas]] climatic downturn and the beginning of the Early [[Holocene]] about 11,700 YBP, and by 10,000 YBP people were preferentially killing young males of a variety of species and allowed the females to live in order to produce more offspring.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=zeder2012/> By measuring the size, sex ratios, and mortality profiles of [[Zooarchaeology|zooarchaeological]] specimens, archeologists have been able to document changes in the management strategies of hunted sheep, goats, pigs, and cows in the Fertile Crescent starting 11,700 YBP. A recent demographic and metrical study of cow and pig remains at Sha\u2019ar Hagolan, Israel, demonstrated that both species were severely overhunted before domestication, suggesting that the intensive exploitation led to management strategies adopted throughout the region that ultimately led to the domestication of these populations following the prey pathway. This pattern of overhunting before domestication suggests that the prey pathway was as accidental and unintentional as the commensal pathway.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=frantz2015b/>\n\n===Directed pathway===\n[[File:Kazakh shepard with dogs and horse.jpg|thumb|Kazakh shepherd with horse and dogs. Their job is to guard the sheep from predators.]]\n\nThe directed pathway was a more deliberate and directed process initiated by humans with the goal of domesticating a free-living animal. It probably only came into being once people were familiar with either commensal or prey-pathway domesticated animals. These animals were likely not to possess many of the [[Domestication#Behavioral preadaptions|behavioral preadaptions]] some species show before domestication. Therefore, the domestication of these animals requires more deliberate effort by humans to work around behaviors that do not assist domestication, with increased technological assistance needed.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=frantz2015b/>\n\nHumans were already reliant on domestic plants and animals when they imagined the domestic versions of wild animals. Although horses, donkeys, and Old World camels were sometimes hunted as prey species, they were each deliberately brought into the human niche for sources of transport. Domestication was still a multi-generational adaptation to human selection pressures, including tameness, but without a suitable evolutionary response then domestication was not achieved.<ref name=larson2014/> For example, despite the fact that hunters of the Near Eastern [[gazelle]] in the [[Epipaleolithic]] avoided culling reproductive females to promote population balance, neither gazelles<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=zeder2006/> nor zebras<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=diamond2002/> possessed the necessary prerequisites and were never domesticated. There is no clear evidence for the domestication of any herded prey animal originating in Africa.<ref name=larson2014/>\n\n===Multiple pathways===\nThe pathways that animals may have followed are not mutually exclusive. Pigs, for example, may have been domesticated as their populations became accustomed to the human niche, which would suggest a commensal pathway, or they may have been hunted and followed a prey pathway, or both.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=frantz2015b/>\n\n==Post-domestication gene flow==\nAs agricultural societies migrated away from the domestication centers taking their domestic partners with them, they encountered populations of wild animals of the same or sister species. Because domestics often shared a recent common ancestor with the wild populations, they were capable of producing fertile offspring. Domestic populations were small relative to the surrounding wild populations, and repeated [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]]s between the two eventually led to the domestic population becoming more genetically divergent from its original domestic source population.<ref name=larson2013/><ref name=currat2008/>\n\nAdvances in [[DNA sequencing]] technology allow the nuclear [[genome]] to be accessed and analyzed in a [[population genetics]] framework. The increased resolution of [[DNA sequencing|nuclear sequences]] has demonstrated that gene flow is common, not only between geographically diverse domestic populations of the same species but also between domestic populations and wild species that never gave rise to a domestic population.<ref name=larson2014/>\n* The yellow leg trait possessed by numerous modern commercial chicken breeds was acquired via [[introgression]] from the [[grey junglefowl]] indigenous to South Asia.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=eriksson2008/>\n* African cattle are hybrids that possess both a European [[Taurine cattle]] maternal mitochondrial signal and an Asian [[Indicine cattle]] paternal Y-chromosome signature.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=hanotte2002/>\n* Numerous other bovid species, including bison, yak, banteng, and gaur also hybridize with ease.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=verkaar2004/>\n* Cats<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=pierpaoli2003/> and horses<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=jordana1995/> have been shown to hybridize with many closely related species.\n* Domestic honey bees have mated with so many different species they now possess genomes more variable than their original wild progenitors.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=harpur2012/>\nThe archaeological and genetic data suggests that long-term bidirectional gene flow between wild and domestic stocks \u2013 including canids, donkeys, horses, New and Old World camelids, goats, sheep, and pigs \u2013 was common.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=marshall2014/> Bidirectional gene flow between domestic and wild reindeer continues today.<ref name=larson2014/>\n\nThe consequence of this [[introgression]] is that modern domestic populations can often appear to have much greater genomic affinity to wild populations that were never involved in the original domestication process. Therefore, it is proposed that the term \"domestication\" should be reserved solely for the initial process of domestication of a discrete population in time and space. Subsequent admixture between introduced domestic populations and local wild populations that were never domesticated should be referred to as \"introgressive capture\". Conflating these two processes muddles our understanding of the original process and can lead to an artificial inflation of the number of times domestication took place.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=larson2013/> This introgression can, in some cases, be regarded as adaptive introgression, as observed in domestic sheep due to gene flow with the wild European Mouflon.<ref name=barbato2017/>\n\nThe sustained admixture between different dog and wolf populations across the Old and New Worlds over at least the last 10,000&nbsp;years has blurred the genetic signatures and confounded efforts of researchers at pinpointing the origins of dogs.<ref name=larson2012/> None of the modern wolf populations are related to the [[Pleistocene]] wolves that were first domesticated,<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=freedman2014/> and the extinction of the wolves that were the direct ancestors of dogs has muddied efforts to pinpoint the time and place of dog domestication.<ref name=larson2014/>\n\n==Positive selection==\n[[Charles Darwin]] recognized the small number of traits that made domestic species different from their wild ancestors. He was also the first to recognize the difference between conscious [[selective breeding]] in which humans directly select for desirable traits, and unconscious selection where traits evolve as a by-product of [[natural selection]] or from selection on other traits.<ref name=darwin1868/><ref name=diamond2007/><ref name=larson2014b/> Domestic animals have variations in coat color as well as texture, dwarf and giant varieties, and changes in their reproductive cycle, and many others have tooth crowding and floppy ears.\n\nAlthough it is easy to assume that each of these traits was uniquely selected for by hunter-gatherers and early farmers, beginning in 1959 [[Dmitry Belyayev (zoologist)|Dmitry Belyayev]] tested the reactions of silver foxes to a hand placed in their cage and selected the tamest, least aggressive individuals to breed. His hypothesis was that, by selecting a behavioral trait, he could also influence the phenotype of subsequent generations, making them more domestic in appearance. Over the next 40 years, he succeeded in producing foxes with traits that were never directly selected for, including piebald coats, floppy ears, upturned tails, shortened snouts, and shifts in developmental timing.<ref name=larson2013/><ref name=trut1999/><ref name=trut2009/> In the 1980s, a researcher used a set of behavioral, cognitive, and visible phenotypic markers, such as coat colour, to produce domesticated fallow deer within a few generations.<ref name=larson2013/><ref name=hemmer2005/> Similar results for tameness and fear have been found for mink<ref name=malmkvist2002/> and Japanese quail.<ref name=jones1997/> In addition to demonstrating that domestic phenotypic traits could arise through selection for a behavioral trait, and domestic behavioral traits could arise through the selection for a phenotypic trait, these experiments provided a mechanism to explain how the animal domestication process could have begun without deliberate human forethought and action.<ref name=larson2013/>\n\n[[File:\u053d\u0578\u0566\u0561\u0580\u0561\u056e.JPG|thumb|Pig herding in fog, Armenia. Human selection for domestic traits is not affected by later gene flow from wild boar.<ref name=frantz2015/><ref name=pennisi2015/>]]\n\nThe genetic difference between domestic and wild populations can be framed within two considerations. The first distinguishes between domestication traits that are presumed to have been essential at the early stages of domestication, and improvement traits that have appeared since the split between wild and domestic populations.<ref name=olsen2013/><ref name=doust2014/><ref name=larson2014/> Domestication traits are generally fixed within all domesticates and were selected during the initial episode of domestication, whereas improvement traits are present only in a proportion of domesticates, though they may be fixed in individual breeds or regional populations.<ref name=doust2014/><ref name=larson2014/><ref name=meyer2013/> A second issue is whether traits associated with the domestication syndrome resulted from a relaxation of selection as animals exited the wild environment or from [[positive selection]] resulting from intentional and unintentional human preference. Some recent genomic studies on the genetic basis of traits associated with the domestication syndrome have shed light on both of these issues.<ref name=larson2014/>\n\nGeneticists have identified more than 300 genetic loci and 150 genes associated with coat color variability.<ref name=larson2013/><ref name=cieslak2011/> Knowing the mutations associated with different colors has allowed some correlation between the timing of the appearance of variable coat colors in horses with the timing of their domestication.<ref name=larson2013/><ref name=ludwig2009/> Other studies have shown how human-induced selection is responsible for the allelic variation in pigs.<ref name=larson2013/><ref name=fang2009/> Together, these insights suggest that, although natural selection has kept variation to a minimum before domestication, humans have actively selected for novel coat colors as soon as they appeared in managed populations.<ref name=larson2013/><ref name=hemmer1990/>\n\nIn 2015, a study looked at over 100 pig genome sequences to ascertain their process of domestication. The process of domestication was assumed to have been initiated by humans, involved few individuals and relied on [[reproductive isolation]] between wild and domestic forms, but the study found that the assumption of reproductive isolation with [[population bottleneck]]s was not supported. The study indicated that pigs were domesticated separately in Western Asia and China, with Western Asian pigs introduced into Europe where they crossed with wild boar. A model that fitted the data included admixture with a now extinct [[ghost population]] of wild pigs during the [[Pleistocene]]. The study also found that despite back-crossing with wild pigs, the genomes of domestic pigs have strong signatures of selection at [[Locus (genetics)|genetic loci]] that affect behavior and morphology. The study concluded that human selection for domestic traits likely counteracted the homogenizing effect of gene flow from wild boars and created [[domestication islands]] in the genome. The same process may also apply to other domesticated animals.<ref name=frantz2015/><ref name=pennisi2015/>\n\nUnlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors.<ref name=\"serpell2014\"/><ref name=cagan2016/> In 2016, a study found that there were only 11 fixed genes that showed variation between wolves and dogs. These gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution, and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication. These genes have been shown to affect the [[Catecholamine#Synthesis|catecholamine synthesis]] pathway, with the majority of the genes affecting the fight-or-flight response<ref name=cagan2016/><ref>Almada RC, Coimbra NC.

He was also the first to recognize the difference between conscious [[selective breeding]] in which humans directly select for desirable traits, and unconscious selection where traits evolve as a by-product of [[natural selection]] or from selection on other traits.<ref name=darwin1868/><ref name=diamond2007/><ref name=larson2014b/> There is a genetic difference between domestic and wild populations. There is also a genetic difference between the domestication traits that researchers believe to have been essential at the early stages of domestication, and the improvement traits that have appeared since the split between wild and domestic populations.<ref name=olsen2013/><ref name=doust2014/><ref name=larson2014/> Domestication traits are generally fixed within all domesticates, and were selected during the initial episode of domestication of that animal or plant, whereas improvement traits are present only in a proportion of domesticates, though they may be fixed in individual breeds or [[Landrace|regional populations]].<ref name=doust2014/><ref name=larson2014/><ref name=meyer2013/>\n\nDomestication should not be confused with [[tame animal|taming]]. Taming is the conditioned behavioral modification of a wild-born animal when its natural avoidance of humans is reduced and it accepts the presence of humans, but domestication is the permanent genetic modification of a bred lineage that leads to an inherited predisposition toward humans.<ref name=price2008/><ref name=macdonald2009/><ref name=diamond2012/> Certain animal species, and certain individuals within those species, make better candidates for domestication than others because they exhibit certain behavioral characteristics: (1) the size and organization of their social structure; (2) the availability and the degree of selectivity in their choice of mates; (3) the ease and speed with which the parents bond with their young, and the maturity and mobility of the young at birth; (4) the degree of flexibility in diet and habitat tolerance; and (5) responses to humans and new environments, including flight responses and reactivity to external stimuli.<ref name=zeder2012/>{{rp|Fig 1}}<ref name=hale1969/><ref name=price1984/><ref name=price2002/>\n\nIt is proposed that there were three major pathways that most animal domesticates followed into domestication: (1) commensals, adapted to a human niche (e.g., [[Domestication of the dog|dogs]], cats, fowl, possibly pigs); (2) prey animals sought for food (e.g., sheep, goats, cattle, water buffalo, yak, pig, reindeer, llama, alpaca, and turkey); and (3) targeted animals for draft and nonfood resources (e.g., [[Domestication of the horse|horse]], donkey, camel).<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=frantz2015b/><ref name=marshall2014/><ref name=blaustein2015/><ref name=telechea2015/><ref name=vahabi2015/><ref name=gepts2012/><ref name=pontarotti2015/> The dog was the first to be domesticated,<ref name=larson2012/><ref name=perri2016/> and was established across [[Eurasia]] before the end of the [[Late Pleistocene]] era, well before [[Agriculture|cultivation]] and before the domestication of other animals.<ref name=larson2012/> Unlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors.<ref name=serpell2014/><ref name=cagan2016/> The archaeological and genetic data suggest that long-term bidirectional [[gene flow]] between wild and domestic stocks \u2013 including [[donkey]]s, [[horse]]s, New and Old World [[camelid]]s, [[goat]]s, [[sheep]], and [[pig]]s \u2013 was common.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=marshall2014/> One study has concluded that human selection for domestic traits likely counteracted the homogenizing effect of gene flow from wild boars into pigs and created [[domestication islands]] in the genome. The same process may also apply to other domesticated animals.<ref name=frantz2015/><ref name=pennisi2015/>\n\n==Definitions==\n\n===Domestication===\n\nDomestication has been defined as \"a sustained multi-generational, [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship in which one [[organism]] assumes a significant degree of influence over the [[reproduction]] and care of another organism in order to secure a more predictable supply of a resource of interest, and through which the [[Symbiosis|partner organism]] gains advantage over individuals that remain outside this relationship, thereby benefitting and often increasing the [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of both the domesticator and the target domesticate.\"<ref name=zeder2015/><ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=maggioni2015/><ref name=smith2014/><ref name=sykes2014/> This definition recognizes both the biological and the cultural components of the domestication process and the effects on both humans and the domesticated animals and plants. All past definitions of domestication have included a relationship between humans with plants and animals, but their differences lay in who was considered as the lead partner in the relationship. This new definition recognizes a mutualistic relationship in which both partners gain benefits. Domestication has vastly enhanced the reproductive output of crop plants, livestock, and pets far beyond that of their wild progenitors. Domesticates have provided humans with resources that they could more predictably and securely control, move, and redistribute, which has been the advantage that had fueled a population explosion of the agro-pastoralists and their spread to all corners of the planet.<ref name=zeder2012/>\n\nThis [[Mutualism (biology)|biological mutualism]] is not restricted to humans with domestic crops and livestock but is well-documented in nonhuman species, especially among a number of social insect domesticators and their plant and animal domesticates, for example the [[ant\u2013fungus mutualism]] that exists between [[leafcutter ants]] and certain fungi.<ref name=zeder2015/>\n\n===Domestication syndrome===\n\nDomestication syndrome is a term often used to describe the suite of [[phenotype|phenotypic]] traits arising during domestication that distinguish crops from their wild ancestors.<ref name=olsen2013/><ref name=hammer1984/> The term is also applied to animals and includes  increased docility and tameness, coat color changes, reductions in tooth size, changes in craniofacial morphology, alterations in ear and tail form (e.g., floppy ears), more frequent and nonseasonal estrus cycles, alterations in adrenocorticotropic hormone levels, changed concentrations of several neurotransmitters, prolongations in juvenile behavior, and reductions in both total brain size and of particular brain regions.<ref name=wilkins2014/>\n\n===Difference from taming===\n\nDomestication should not be confused with [[tame animal|taming]]. Taming is the conditioned behavioral modification of a wild-born animal when its natural avoidance of humans is reduced and it accepts the presence of humans, but domestication is the permanent genetic modification of a bred lineage that leads to an inherited predisposition toward humans.<ref name=price2008/><ref name=macdonald2009/><ref name=diamond2012/> Human selection included tameness, but without a suitable evolutionary response then domestication was not achieved.<ref name=larson2014/> Domestic animals need not be tame in the behavioral sense, such as the Spanish fighting bull. Wild animals can be tame, such as a hand-raised cheetah. A domestic animal's breeding is controlled by humans and its tameness and tolerance of humans is genetically determined. However, an animal merely bred in captivity is not necessarily domesticated. Tigers, gorillas, and polar bears breed readily in captivity but are not domesticated.<ref name=macdonald2009/> Asian elephants are wild animals that with taming manifest outward signs of domestication, yet their breeding is not human controlled and thus they are not true domesticates.<ref name=macdonald2009/><ref name=lair1997/>\n\n==Cause and timing==\n{{further|History of agriculture}}\n\nThe [[domestication of animals]] and plants was triggered by the climatic and environmental changes that occurred after the peak of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] around 21,000 years ago and which continue to this present day. These changes made obtaining food difficult. The first domesticate was the [[wolf]] (''Canis lupus'') at least 15,000 years ago. The [[Younger Dryas]] that occurred 12,900 years ago was a period of intense cold and aridity that put pressure on humans to intensify their foraging strategies. By the beginning of the [[Holocene]] from 11,700 years ago, favorable climatic conditions and increasing human populations led to small-scale animal and plant domestication, which allowed humans to augment the food that they were obtaining through [[Hunter-gatherer|hunter-gathering]].<ref name=McHugo2019/>\n\nThe [[Neolithic transition]] led to agricultural societies emerging in locations across Eurasia, North Africa, and South and Central America. In the [[Fertile Crescent]] 10,000-11,000 years ago, [[zooarchaeology]] indicates that goats, pigs, sheep, and [[taurine cattle]] were the first livestock to be domesticated. Two thousand years later, humped [[zebu]] cattle were domesticated in what is today [[Baluchistan]] in Pakistan. In [[East Asia]] 8,000 years ago, pigs were domesticated from wild boar that were genetically different from those found in the Fertile Crescent. The horse was domesticated on the Central Asian steppe 5,500 years ago. Both the chicken in Southeast Asia and the cat in Egypt were domesticated 4,000 years ago.<ref name=McHugo2019/>\n\nThe sudden appearance of the [[domestic dog]] (''Canis lupus familiaris'') in the archaeological record then led to a rapid shift in the [[evolution]], [[ecology]], and [[demography]] of both humans and numerous species of animals and plants.<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=larson2014/> It was followed by livestock and crop domestication, and the transition of humans from foraging to farming in different places and times across the planet.<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=fuller2011/><ref name=zeder2006/> Around 10,000 YBP, a new way of life emerged for humans through the management and exploitation of plant and animal species, leading to higher-density populations in the centers of domestication,<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=bocquet2011/> the expansion of agricultural economies, and the development of urban communities.<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=barker2006/>\n\n==Universal features==\nThe biomass of wild vertebrates is now increasingly small compared to the biomass of domestic animals, with the calculated biomass of domestic cattle alone being greater than that of all wild mammals.<ref name=smil2011/> Because the evolution of domestic animals is ongoing, the process of domestication has a beginning but not an end. Various criteria have been established to provide a definition of domestic animals, but all decisions about exactly when an animal can be labelled \"domesticated\" in the zoological sense are arbitrary, although potentially useful.<ref name=larson2013/>\nDomestication is a fluid and nonlinear process that may start, stop, reverse, or go down unexpected paths with no clear or universal threshold that separates the wild from the domestic. However, there are universal features held in common by all domesticated animals.<ref name=zeder2012/>\n\n===Behavioral preadaption===\nCertain animal species, and certain individuals within those species, make better candidates for domestication than others because they exhibit certain behavioral characteristics: (1) the size and organization of their social structure; (2) the availability and the degree of selectivity in their choice of mates; (3) the ease and speed with which the parents bond with their young, and the maturity and mobility of the young at birth; (4) the degree of flexibility in diet and habitat tolerance; and (5) responses to humans and new environments, including flight responses and reactivity to external stimuli.<ref name=zeder2012/>{{rp|Fig 1}}<ref name=hale1969/><ref name=price1984/><ref name=price2002/> Reduced wariness to humans and low reactivity to both humans and other external stimuli are a key pre-adaptation for domestication, and these behaviors are also the primary target of the selective pressures experienced by the animal undergoing domestication.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=zeder2012/> This implies that not all animals can be domesticated, e.g. a wild member of the horse family, the [[Zebra#Domestication|Zebra]].<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=zeder2006/>\n\n[[Jared Diamond]] in his book ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'' enquired as to why, among the world's 148 large wild terrestrial herbivorous mammals, only 14 were domesticated, and proposed that their wild ancestors must have possessed six characteristics before they could be considered for domestication:<ref name=diamond2007/>{{rp|p168-174}}\n[[File:Cows in green field - nullamunjie olive grove03.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Hereford cattle, domesticated for beef production.]]\n\n#Efficient diet&nbsp;\u2013 Animals that can efficiently process what they eat and live off plants are less expensive to keep in captivity. Carnivores feed on flesh, which would require the domesticators to raise additional animals to feed the carnivores and therefore increase the consumption of plants further.\n#Quick growth rate&nbsp;\u2013 Fast maturity rate compared to the human life span allows breeding intervention and makes the animal useful within an acceptable duration of caretaking. Some large animals require many years before they reach a useful size.\n#Ability to breed in captivity&nbsp;\u2013 Animals that will not breed in captivity are limited to acquisition through capture in the wild.\n#Pleasant disposition&nbsp;\u2013 Animals with nasty dispositions are dangerous to keep around humans.\n#Tendency not to panic&nbsp;\u2013 Some species are nervous, fast, and prone to flight when they perceive a threat.\n#Social structure&nbsp;\u2013 All species of domesticated large mammals had wild ancestors that lived in herds with a dominance hierarchy amongst the herd members, and the herds had overlapping home territories rather than mutually exclusive home territories. This arrangement allows humans to take control of the dominance hierarchy.\n\n===Brain size and function===\n[[File:Unnatural selection, 2 heads, one species.jpg|thumb|right|Reduction in skull size with neoteny - grey wolf and chihuahua skulls]]\n\nThe sustained selection for lowered reactivity among mammal domesticates has resulted in profound changes in brain form and function. The larger the size of the brain to begin with and the greater its degree of folding, the greater the degree of brain-size reduction under domestication.<ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=kruska1988/> [[domesticated red fox|Foxes that had been selectively bred for tameness over 40 years]] had experienced a significant reduction in cranial height and width and by inference in brain size,<ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=trut1999/> which supports the hypothesis that brain-size reduction is an early response to the selective pressure for tameness and lowered reactivity that is the universal feature of animal domestication.<ref name=zeder2012/> The most affected portion of the brain in domestic mammals is the limbic system, which in domestic dogs, pigs, and sheep show a 40% reduction in size compared with their wild species. This portion of the brain regulates endocrine function that influences behaviors such as aggression, wariness, and responses to environmentally induced stress, all attributes which are dramatically affected by domestication.<ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=kruska1988/>\n\n===Pleiotropy===\nA putative cause for the broad changes seen in domestication syndrome is [[pleiotropy]]. Pleiotropy occurs when one gene influences two or more seemingly unrelated [[phenotypic trait]]s. Certain physiological changes characterize domestic animals of many species. These changes include extensive white markings (particularly on the head), floppy ears, and curly tails. These arise even when tameness is the only trait under selective pressure.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal |last=Trut |first=Lyudmila |last2=Oskina |first2=Irina |last3=Kharlamova |first3=Anastasiya |date=2009 |title=Animal evolution during domestication: the domesticated fox as a model |journal=BioEssays |volume=31|issue=3 |pages=349\u2013360 |doi=10.1002/bies.200800070 |pmc=2763232 |pmid=19260016}}</ref> The genes involved in tameness are largely unknown, so it is not known how or to what extent pleiotropy contributes to domestication syndrome.

Although they do not affect the development of the adrenal cortex directly, the neural crest cells may be involved in relevant upstream embryological interactions.<ref name=\":1\" /> Furthermore, artificial selection targeting tameness may affect genes that control the concentration or movement of NCCs in the embryo, leading to a variety of phenotypes.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe single genetic regulatory network hypothesis proposes that domestication syndrome results from mutations in genes that regulate the expression pattern of more downstream genes.<ref name=\":0\" /> For example piebald, or spotted coat coloration, may be caused by a linkage in the biochemical pathways of melanins involved in coat coloration and neurotransmitters such as dopamine that help shape behavior and cognition.<ref name=\"zeder2012\" /><ref name=\"hemmer1990\" /> These linked traits may arise from mutations in a few key regulatory genes.<ref name=\"zeder2012\" /> A problem with this hypothesis is that it proposes that there are mutations in gene networks that cause dramatic effects that are not lethal, however no currently known genetic regulatory networks cause such dramatic change in so many different traits.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Limited reversion===\nFeral mammals such as dogs, cats, goats, donkeys, pigs, and ferrets that have lived apart from humans for generations show no sign of regaining the brain mass of their wild progenitors.<ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=birks1999/> [[Dingo]]s have lived apart from humans for thousands of years but still have the same brain size as that of a domestic dog.<ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=schultz1969/> Feral dogs that actively avoid human contact are still dependent on human waste for survival and have not reverted to the self-sustaining behaviors of their wolf ancestors.<ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=boitani1995/>\n\n==Categories==\nDomestication can be considered as the final phase of intensification in the relationship between animal or plant sub-populations and human societies, but it is divided into several grades of intensification.<ref name=vigne2011/> For studies in animal domestication, researchers have proposed five distinct categories: wild, captive wild, domestic, cross-breeds and feral.<ref name=price2002/><ref name=mayer1991/><ref name=evin2015/>\n\n; ''Wild'' animals : Subject to natural selection, although the action of past demographic events and artificial selection induced by game management or habitat destruction cannot be excluded.<ref name=evin2015/>\n; ''Captive wild'' animals : Directly affected by a relaxation of natural selection associated with feeding, breeding and protection/confinement by humans, and an intensification of artificial selection through passive selection for animals that are more suited to captivity.<ref name=evin2015/>\n;''Domestic'' animals : Subject to intensified artificial selection through husbandry practices with relaxation of natural selection associated with captivity and management.<ref name=evin2015/>\n;''Cross-breed'' animals : Genetic hybrids of wild and domestic parents. They may be forms intermediate between both parents, forms more similar to one parent than the other, or unique forms distinct from both parents. Hybrids can be intentionally bred for specific characteristics or can arise unintentionally as the result of contact with wild individuals.<ref name=evin2015/>\n;''Feral'' animals : Domesticates that have returned to a wild state. As such, they experience relaxed artificial selection induced by the captive environment paired with intensified natural selection induced by the wild habitat.<ref name=evin2015/>\n\nIn 2015, a study compared the diversity of dental size, shape and allometry across the proposed domestication categories of modern pigs (genus ''Sus''). The study showed clear differences between the dental phenotypes of wild, captive wild, domestic, and hybrid pig populations, which supported the proposed categories through physical evidence. The study did not cover feral pig populations but called for further research to be undertaken on them, and on the genetic differences with hybrid pigs.<ref name=evin2015/>\n\n==Pathways==\nSince 2012, a multi-stage model of animal domestication has been accepted by two groups. The first group proposed that animal domestication proceeded along a continuum of stages from anthropophily, commensalism, control in the wild, control of captive animals, extensive breeding, intensive breeding, and finally to pets in a slow, gradually intensifying relationship between humans and animals.<ref name=larson2013/><ref name=vigne2011/>\n\nThe second group proposed that there were three major pathways that most animal domesticates followed into domestication: (1) commensals, adapted to a human niche (e.g., dogs, cats, fowl, possibly pigs); (2) prey animals sought for food (e.g., sheep, goats, cattle, water buffalo, yak, pig, reindeer, llama and alpaca); and (3) targeted animals for draft and nonfood resources (e.g., horse, donkey, camel).<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=frantz2015b/><ref name=marshall2014/><ref name=blaustein2015/><ref name=telechea2015/><ref name=vahabi2015/><ref name=gepts2012/><ref name=pontarotti2015/> The beginnings of animal domestication involved a protracted [[coevolution]]ary process with multiple stages along different pathways. Humans did not intend to domesticate animals from, or at least they did not envision a domesticated animal resulting from, either the commensal or prey pathways. In both of these cases, humans became entangled with these species as the relationship between them, and the human role in their survival and reproduction, intensified.<ref name=larson2014/> Although the directed pathway proceeded from capture to taming, the other two pathways are not as goal-oriented and archaeological records suggest that they take place over much longer time frames.<ref name=larson2013/>\n\n===Commensal pathway===\nThe [[Commensalism|commensal]] pathway was traveled by vertebrates that fed on refuse around human habitats or by animals that preyed on other animals drawn to human  camps. Those animals established a commensal relationship with humans in which the animals benefited but the humans received no harm but little benefit. Those animals that were most capable of taking advantage of the resources associated with human camps would have been the tamer, less aggressive individuals with shorter fight or flight distances.<ref name=crockford2000/><ref name=coppinger2001/><ref name=russell2012/> Later, these animals developed closer social or economic bonds with humans that led to a domestic relationship.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=frantz2015b/> The leap from a [[Synanthrope|synanthropic]] population to a domestic one could only have taken place after the animals had progressed from anthropophily to habituation, to commensalism and partnership, when the relationship between animal and human would have laid the foundation for domestication, including captivity and human-controlled breeding. From this perspective, animal domestication is a [[coevolution]]ary process in which a population responds to selective pressure while adapting to a novel [[Ecological niche|niche]] that included another species with evolving behaviors.<ref name=larson2014/> Commensal pathway animals include dogs, cats, fowl, and possibly pigs.<ref name=larson2012/>\n\nThe domestication of animals commenced over 15,000&nbsp;[[years before present]] (YBP), beginning with the [[grey wolf]] (''Canis lupus'') by nomadic [[hunter-gatherers]]. It was not until 11,000&nbsp;YBP that people living in the [[Ancient Near East|Near East]] entered into relationships with wild populations of [[aurochs]], boar, sheep, and goats. A domestication process then began to develop. The grey wolf most likely followed the commensal pathway to domestication. When, where, and how many times wolves may have been domesticated remains debated because only a small number of ancient specimens have been found, and both archaeology and genetics continue to provide conflicting evidence. The most widely accepted, earliest dog remains date back 15,000&nbsp;YBP to the [[Origin of the domestic dog#Bonn\u2013Oberkassel dog|Bonn\u2013Oberkassel dog]]. Earlier remains dating back to 30,000&nbsp;YBP have been described as [[Paleolithic dog]]s, however their status as dogs or wolves remains debated. Recent studies indicate that a [[genetic divergence]] occurred between dogs and wolves 20,000\u201340,000&nbsp;YBP, however this is the upper time-limit for domestication because it represents the time of divergence and not the time of domestication.<ref name=irving-pease2018/>\n\nThe chicken is one of the most widespread domesticated species and one of the human world's largest sources of protein. Although the chicken was domesticated in South-East Asia, archaeological evidence suggests that it was not kept as a livestock species until 400&nbsp;[[BCE]] in the [[Levant]].<ref name=perrygal2015/> Prior to this, chickens had been associated with humans for thousands of years and kept for cock-fighting, rituals, and royal zoos, so they were not originally a prey species.<ref name=perrygal2015/><ref name=sykes2012/> The chicken was not a popular food in Europe until only one thousand years ago.<ref name=gibbons2016/>\n\n===Prey pathway===\n[[File:Animal husbandry.jpeg|thumbnail|Domesticated dairy cows in North India]]\nThe prey pathway was the way in which most major livestock species entered into domestication as these were once hunted by humans for their meat. Domestication was likely initiated when humans began to experiment with hunting strategies designed to increase the availability of these prey, perhaps as a response to localized pressure on the supply of the animal. Over time and with the more responsive species, these game-management strategies developed into herd-management strategies that included the sustained multi-generational control over the animals\u2019 movement, feeding, and reproduction. As human interference in the life-cycles of prey animals intensified, the evolutionary pressures for a lack of aggression would have led to an acquisition of the same domestication syndrome traits found in the commensal domesticates.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=frantz2015b/>\n\nPrey pathway animals include sheep, goats, cattle, water buffalo, yak, pig, reindeer, llama and alpaca. The right conditions for the domestication for some of them appear to have been in place in the central and eastern [[Fertile Crescent]] at the end of the [[Younger Dryas]] climatic downturn and the beginning of the Early [[Holocene]] about 11,700 YBP, and by 10,000 YBP people were preferentially killing young males of a variety of species and allowed the females to live in order to produce more offspring.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=zeder2012/> By measuring the size, sex ratios, and mortality profiles of [[Zooarchaeology|zooarchaeological]] specimens, archeologists have been able to document changes in the management strategies of hunted sheep, goats, pigs, and cows in the Fertile Crescent starting 11,700 YBP. A recent demographic and metrical study of cow and pig remains at Sha\u2019ar Hagolan, Israel, demonstrated that both species were severely overhunted before domestication, suggesting that the intensive exploitation led to management strategies adopted throughout the region that ultimately led to the domestication of these populations following the prey pathway. This pattern of overhunting before domestication suggests that the prey pathway was as accidental and unintentional as the commensal pathway.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=frantz2015b/>\n\n===Directed pathway===\n[[File:Kazakh shepard with dogs and horse.jpg|thumb|Kazakh shepherd with horse and dogs. Their job is to guard the sheep from predators.]]\n\nThe directed pathway was a more deliberate and directed process initiated by humans with the goal of domesticating a free-living animal. It probably only came into being once people were familiar with either commensal or prey-pathway domesticated animals. These animals were likely not to possess many of the [[Domestication#Behavioral preadaptions|behavioral preadaptions]] some species show before domestication. Therefore, the domestication of these animals requires more deliberate effort by humans to work around behaviors that do not assist domestication, with increased technological assistance needed.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=frantz2015b/>\n\nHumans were already reliant on domestic plants and animals when they imagined the domestic versions of wild animals. Although horses, donkeys, and Old World camels were sometimes hunted as prey species, they were each deliberately brought into the human niche for sources of transport. Domestication was still a multi-generational adaptation to human selection pressures, including tameness, but without a suitable evolutionary response then domestication was not achieved.<ref name=larson2014/> For example, despite the fact that hunters of the Near Eastern [[gazelle]] in the [[Epipaleolithic]] avoided culling reproductive females to promote population balance, neither gazelles<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=zeder2006/> nor zebras<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=diamond2002/> possessed the necessary prerequisites and were never domesticated. There is no clear evidence for the domestication of any herded prey animal originating in Africa.<ref name=larson2014/>\n\n===Multiple pathways===\nThe pathways that animals may have followed are not mutually exclusive. Pigs, for example, may have been domesticated as their populations became accustomed to the human niche, which would suggest a commensal pathway, or they may have been hunted and followed a prey pathway, or both.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=frantz2015b/>\n\n==Post-domestication gene flow==\nAs agricultural societies migrated away from the domestication centers taking their domestic partners with them, they encountered populations of wild animals of the same or sister species. Because domestics often shared a recent common ancestor with the wild populations, they were capable of producing fertile offspring. Domestic populations were small relative to the surrounding wild populations, and repeated [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]]s between the two eventually led to the domestic population becoming more genetically divergent from its original domestic source population.<ref name=larson2013/><ref name=currat2008/>\n\nAdvances in [[DNA sequencing]] technology allow the nuclear [[genome]] to be accessed and analyzed in a [[population genetics]] framework. The increased resolution of [[DNA sequencing|nuclear sequences]] has demonstrated that gene flow is common, not only between geographically diverse domestic populations of the same species but also between domestic populations and wild species that never gave rise to a domestic population.<ref name=larson2014/>\n* The yellow leg trait possessed by numerous modern commercial chicken breeds was acquired via [[introgression]] from the [[grey junglefowl]] indigenous to South Asia.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=eriksson2008/>\n* African cattle are hybrids that possess both a European [[Taurine cattle]] maternal mitochondrial signal and an Asian [[Indicine cattle]] paternal Y-chromosome signature.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=hanotte2002/>\n* Numerous other bovid species, including bison, yak, banteng, and gaur also hybridize with ease.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=verkaar2004/>\n* Cats<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=pierpaoli2003/> and horses<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=jordana1995/> have been shown to hybridize with many closely related species.\n* Domestic honey bees have mated with so many different species they now possess genomes more variable than their original wild progenitors.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=harpur2012/>\nThe archaeological and genetic data suggests that long-term bidirectional gene flow between wild and domestic stocks \u2013 including canids, donkeys, horses, New and Old World camelids, goats, sheep, and pigs \u2013 was common.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=marshall2014/> Bidirectional gene flow between domestic and wild reindeer continues today.<ref name=larson2014/>\n\nThe consequence of this [[introgression]] is that modern domestic populations can often appear to have much greater genomic affinity to wild populations that were never involved in the original domestication process. Therefore, it is proposed that the term \"domestication\" should be reserved solely for the initial process of domestication of a discrete population in time and space. Subsequent admixture between introduced domestic populations and local wild populations that were never domesticated should be referred to as \"introgressive capture\". Conflating these two processes muddles our understanding of the original process and can lead to an artificial inflation of the number of times domestication took place.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=larson2013/> This introgression can, in some cases, be regarded as adaptive introgression, as observed in domestic sheep due to gene flow with the wild European Mouflon.<ref name=barbato2017/>\n\nThe sustained admixture between different dog and wolf populations across the Old and New Worlds over at least the last 10,000&nbsp;years has blurred the genetic signatures and confounded efforts of researchers at pinpointing the origins of dogs.<ref name=larson2012/> None of the modern wolf populations are related to the [[Pleistocene]] wolves that were first domesticated,<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=freedman2014/> and the extinction of the wolves that were the direct ancestors of dogs has muddied efforts to pinpoint the time and place of dog domestication.<ref name=larson2014/>\n\n==Positive selection==\n[[Charles Darwin]] recognized the small number of traits that made domestic species different from their wild ancestors. He was also the first to recognize the difference between conscious [[selective breeding]] in which humans directly select for desirable traits, and unconscious selection where traits evolve as a by-product of [[natural selection]] or from selection on other traits.<ref name=darwin1868/><ref name=diamond2007/><ref name=larson2014b/> Domestic animals have variations in coat color as well as texture, dwarf and giant varieties, and changes in their reproductive cycle, and many others have tooth crowding and floppy ears.\n\nAlthough it is easy to assume that each of these traits was uniquely selected for by hunter-gatherers and early farmers, beginning in 1959 [[Dmitry Belyayev (zoologist)|Dmitry Belyayev]] tested the reactions of silver foxes to a hand placed in their cage and selected the tamest, least aggressive individuals to breed. His hypothesis was that, by selecting a behavioral trait, he could also influence the phenotype of subsequent generations, making them more domestic in appearance. Over the next 40 years, he succeeded in producing foxes with traits that were never directly selected for, including piebald coats, floppy ears, upturned tails, shortened snouts, and shifts in developmental timing.<ref name=larson2013/><ref name=trut1999/><ref name=trut2009/> In the 1980s, a researcher used a set of behavioral, cognitive, and visible phenotypic markers, such as coat colour, to produce domesticated fallow deer within a few generations.<ref name=larson2013/><ref name=hemmer2005/> Similar results for tameness and fear have been found for mink<ref name=malmkvist2002/> and Japanese quail.<ref name=jones1997/> In addition to demonstrating that domestic phenotypic traits could arise through selection for a behavioral trait, and domestic behavioral traits could arise through the selection for a phenotypic trait, these experiments provided a mechanism to explain how the animal domestication process could have begun without deliberate human forethought and action.<ref name=larson2013/>\n\n[[File:\u053d\u0578\u0566\u0561\u0580\u0561\u056e.JPG|thumb|Pig herding in fog, Armenia. Human selection for domestic traits is not affected by later gene flow from wild boar.<ref name=frantz2015/><ref name=pennisi2015/>]]\n\nThe genetic difference between domestic and wild populations can be framed within two considerations. The first distinguishes between domestication traits that are presumed to have been essential at the early stages of domestication, and improvement traits that have appeared since the split between wild and domestic populations.<ref name=olsen2013/><ref name=doust2014/><ref name=larson2014/> Domestication traits are generally fixed within all domesticates and were selected during the initial episode of domestication, whereas improvement traits are present only in a proportion of domesticates, though they may be fixed in individual breeds or regional populations.<ref name=doust2014/><ref name=larson2014/><ref name=meyer2013/> A second issue is whether traits associated with the domestication syndrome resulted from a relaxation of selection as animals exited the wild environment or from [[positive selection]] resulting from intentional and unintentional human preference. Some recent genomic studies on the genetic basis of traits associated with the domestication syndrome have shed light on both of these issues.<ref name=larson2014/>\n\nGeneticists have identified more than 300 genetic loci and 150 genes associated with coat color variability.<ref name=larson2013/><ref name=cieslak2011/> Knowing the mutations associated with different colors has allowed some correlation between the timing of the appearance of variable coat colors in horses with the timing of their domestication.<ref name=larson2013/><ref name=ludwig2009/> Other studies have shown how human-induced selection is responsible for the allelic variation in pigs.<ref name=larson2013/><ref name=fang2009/> Together, these insights suggest that, although natural selection has kept variation to a minimum before domestication, humans have actively selected for novel coat colors as soon as they appeared in managed populations.<ref name=larson2013/><ref name=hemmer1990/>\n\nIn 2015, a study looked at over 100 pig genome sequences to ascertain their process of domestication. The process of domestication was assumed to have been initiated by humans, involved few individuals and relied on [[reproductive isolation]] between wild and domestic forms, but the study found that the assumption of reproductive isolation with [[population bottleneck]]s was not supported. The study indicated that pigs were domesticated separately in Western Asia and China, with Western Asian pigs introduced into Europe where they crossed with wild boar. A model that fitted the data included admixture with a now extinct [[ghost population]] of wild pigs during the [[Pleistocene]]. The study also found that despite back-crossing with wild pigs, the genomes of domestic pigs have strong signatures of selection at [[Locus (genetics)|genetic loci]] that affect behavior and morphology. The study concluded that human selection for domestic traits likely counteracted the homogenizing effect of gene flow from wild boars and created [[domestication islands]] in the genome. The same process may also apply to other domesticated animals.<ref name=frantz2015/><ref name=pennisi2015/>\n\nUnlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors.<ref name=\"serpell2014\"/><ref name=cagan2016/> In 2016, a study found that there were only 11 fixed genes that showed variation between wolves and dogs.

In 1950 the track was given lighting and in 1957, the track was paved for the first time as car racing, specifically [[stock car racing]], became more popular. [[Robert Roseberry]] sold his portion to John Nuckles after the paving was complete. The track was run by the Nuckles for many years, and was owned and operated by the Nuckles family.

It is a miscellaneous science as it links [[health science]]s with [[pharmaceutical science]]s and [[natural science]]s. The professional practice is becoming more clinically oriented as most of the drugs are now manufactured by pharmaceutical industries. Based on the setting, the pharmacy is classified as a community or institutional pharmacy. Providing direct patient care in the community of institutional pharmacies are considered clinical pharmacy.<ref name=\"Thomas_2019\">{{cite book| vauthors = Thomas D | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Jp7DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1|title=Clinical Pharmacy Education, Practice and Research | date = November 2018 | isbn = 9780128142769}}</ref>\n\nThe scope of pharmacy practice includes more traditional roles such as [[compounding]] and dispensing of medications, and it also includes more modern services related to [[health care]], including clinical services, reviewing medications for safety and efficacy, and providing [[drug]] information. [[Pharmacist]]s, therefore, are the experts on drug therapy and are the primary health professionals who optimize the use of medication for the benefit of the patients.\n\nAn establishment in which pharmacy (in the first sense) is practiced is called a ''pharmacy'' (this term is more common in the United States) or a ''chemist's'' (which is more common in Great Britain). In the United States and Canada, ''[[drugstore]]s'' commonly sell [[medicines]], as well as miscellaneous items such as [[confectionery]], [[cosmetics]], [[office supplies]], [[toy]]s, [[hair care]] products and [[magazine]]s and occasionally refreshments and groceries.\n\nIn its investigation of herbal and chemical ingredients, the work of the pharma may be regarded as a precursor of the modern sciences of [[chemistry]] and [[pharmacology]], prior to the formulation of the [[scientific method]].\n\n==Disciplines==\n[[File:42-aspetti di vita quotidiana, medicine,Taccuino Sanitatis, .jpg|thumb|Pharmacy, ''[[Tacuinum sanitatis]]'' casanatensis (14th century)]]\nThe field of pharmacy can generally be divided into three primary disciplines:\n*[[Pharmaceutics]] \n*[[Medicinal Chemistry]] and [[Pharmacognosy]]\n*Pharmacy Practice\n\nThe boundaries between these disciplines and with other sciences, such as biochemistry, are not always clear-cut.\nOften, collaborative teams from various disciplines (pharmacists and other scientists) work together toward the introduction of new therapeutics and methods for patient care. However, pharmacy is not a basic or biomedical science in its typical form. Medicinal chemistry is also a distinct branch of synthetic chemistry combining pharmacology, organic chemistry, and chemical biology.\n\n[[Pharmacology]] is sometimes considered as the 4th discipline of pharmacy. Although pharmacology is essential to the study of pharmacy, it is not specific to pharmacy. Both disciplines are distinct. Those who wish to practice both pharmacy (patient-oriented) and pharmacology (a biomedical science requiring the scientific method) receive separate training and degrees unique to either discipline.\n\n[[Pharmacoinformatics]] is considered another new discipline, for systematic drug discovery and development with efficiency and safety.\n\nPharmacogenomics is the study of genetic-linked variants that effect patient clinical responses, allergies, and metabolism of drugs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/genomicresearch/pharmacogenomics|title=What is pharmacogenomics?|last=Reference|first=Genetics Home|website=Genetics Home Reference|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref>\n\n==Professionals==\nThe [[World Health Organization]] estimates that there are at least 2.6 million pharmacists and other pharmaceutical personnel worldwide.<ref>World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/whosis/whostat/2011/en/index.html ''World Health Statistics 2011''] \u2013 Table 6: Health workforce, infrastructure, and essential medicines. Geneva, 2011. Accessed 21 July 2011.</ref>\n\n===Pharmacists===\n{{Main|Pharmacist}}\n[[File:Farmacia conventuale Museo scienza e tecnologia Milano.jpg|thumb|Convent pharmacy exhibited at the [[Museo nazionale della scienza e della tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci]] of Milan.]]\n\nPharmacists are [[healthcare profession]]als with specialized education and training who perform various roles to ensure optimal [[health]] outcomes for their patients through the quality use of medicines. Pharmacists may also be [[small business|small-business]] proprietors, owning the pharmacy in which they practice. Since pharmacists know about the mode of action of a particular drug, and its metabolism and physiological effects on the human body in great detail, they play an important role in optimization of drug treatment for an individual.\n\nPharmacists are represented internationally by the [[International Pharmaceutical Federation]] (FIP). They are represented at the national level by [[professional body|professional organisations]] such as the [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society]] in the UK, [[Pharmacy Guild of Australia]] (PSA), [[Canadian Pharmacists Association]] (CPhA), [[Indian Pharmacist Association]] (IPA), [[Pakistan Pharmacists Association]] (PPA), and the [[American Pharmacists Association]] (APhA). (''See also: [[List of pharmacy associations]].)''\n\nIn some cases, the representative body is also the registering body, which is responsible for the regulation and [[ethics]] of the profession.\n\nIn the United States, specializations in pharmacy practice recognized by the [[Board of Pharmacy Specialties]] include: cardiovascular, [[infectious disease]], [[oncology]], pharmacotherapy, nuclear, [[nutrition]], and [[psychiatry]].<ref>Board of Pharmacy Specialties, [http://www.bpsweb.org/03_Specialties_Current.html, Current Specialties]</ref> The [[Commission for Certification in Geriatric Pharmacy]] certifies pharmacists in geriatric pharmacy practice. The [[American Board of Applied Toxicology]] certifies pharmacists and other medical professionals in applied [[toxicology]].\n\n===Pharmacy technicians===\n{{Main|Pharmacy technician}}\n\nPharmacy technicians support the work of pharmacists and other health professionals by performing a variety of pharmacy-related functions, including dispensing prescription drugs and other medical devices to patients and instructing on their use. They may also perform administrative duties in pharmaceutical practice, such as reviewing prescription requests with medic's offices and insurance companies to ensure correct medications are provided and payment is received.\n\nA Pharmacy Technician in the UK has recently been referred to by some as a professional. Legislation requires the supervision of certain pharmacy technician's activities by a pharmacist. The majority of pharmacy technicians work in community pharmacies. In hospital pharmacies, pharmacy technicians may be managed by other senior pharmacy technicians. In the UK the role of a PhT in hospital pharmacy has grown and responsibility has been passed on to them to manage the pharmacy department and specialized areas in pharmacy practice allowing pharmacists the time to specialize in their expert field as medication consultants spending more time working with patients and in research. Pharmacy technicians are registered with the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC). The GPhC is the regulator of pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and pharmacy premises.\n\nIn the US, pharmacy technicians perform their duties under the supervision of pharmacists. Although they may perform, under supervision, most dispensing, compounding and other tasks, they are not generally allowed to perform the role of counseling patients on the proper use of their medications.\n\n== Education requirements ==\n{{Globalize|section|date=December 2019}}\nThere are different requirements of schooling according to the national jurisdiction where the student intends to practise.\n\n===United States===\n<!-- It appears that there is also a Batchelor degree but if so then it needs its own citation -->\nIn the United States, general pharmacist will attain a Doctor of Pharmacy Degree (Pharm.D.).

There are a series of required standardized tests that students have to pass throughout the process of pharmacy school. The standardized test to get into pharmacy school in the United States is called the Pharmacy College Admission Test (PCAT). In a student's third professional year in pharmacy school, it is required to pass the Pharmacy Curriculum Outcomes Assessment (PCOA). Once the Pharm.D. is attained after the fourth year professional school, the student is then eligible to take the North American Pharmacist Licensure Exam (NAPLEX) and the Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Exam (MPJE) to work as a professional pharmacist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pharmacy.ku.edu/sites/pharmacy.ku.edu/files/files/student%20handbooks/2017-2018%20Student%20Handbook%20v2017_08_18.pdf|title=Pharmacy Student Handbook 2017\u20132018|date=August 2017|website=KU Pharmacy|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of pharmacy|List of pharmacists}}\n[[File:Legenogapotekeren.jpg|thumb|Physician and Pharmacist, illustration from ''Medicinarius'' (1505) by [[Hieronymus Brunschwig]].]]\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:Scientific chemistry and pharmacy.jpg|thumb|Pharmacy in medieval [[Muslim world]].]] -->\n\nThe earliest known compilation of medicinal substances was the ''[[Sushruta Samhita]]'', an Indian [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic treatise]] attributed to [[Sushruta]] in the 6th century BC.

The Latin translation ''[[De Materia Medica (Dioscorides)|De Materia Medica]]'' (''Concerning medical substances'') was used a basis for many medieval texts and was built upon by many middle eastern scientists during the [[Islamic Golden Age]].\n\n[[Pharmacy in China]] dates at least to the earliest known Chinese manual, the ''Shennong Bencao Jing'' (''The Divine Farmer's Herb-Root Classic''), dating back to the 1st century AD. It was compiled during the [[Han dynasty]] and was attributed to the mythical [[Shennong]]. Earlier literature included lists of prescriptions for specific ailments, exemplified by a manuscript \"Recipes for 52 Ailments\", found in the [[Mawangdui]], sealed in 168 BC.\n\nIn Japan, at the end of the [[Asuka period]] (538\u2013710) and the early [[Nara period]] (710\u2013794), the men who fulfilled roles similar to those of modern pharmacists were highly respected.  The place of pharmacists in society was expressly defined in the [[Taih\u014d Code]] (701) and re-stated in the [[Y\u014dr\u014d Code]] (718).  Ranked positions in the pre-[[Heian period|Heian]] Imperial court were established; and this organizational structure remained largely intact until the [[Meiji Restoration]] (1868).  In this highly stable hierarchy, the pharmacists\u2014and even pharmacist assistants\u2014were assigned status superior to all others in health-related fields such as physicians and acupuncturists. In the Imperial household, the pharmacist was even ranked above the two personal physicians of the Emperor.<ref>Titsingh, Isaac.

[[Muhammad ibn Zakar\u012bya R\u0101zi]] (Rhazes) (865\u2013915), for instance, acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds. [[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi]] (Abulcasis) (936\u20131013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]] and [[distillation]]. His ''Liber servitoris'' is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the 'simples' from which were [[compounding|compounded]] the complex drugs then generally used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however, the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia, describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. [[Al-Biruni]] (973\u20131050) wrote one of the most valuable Islamic works on pharmacology, entitled ''Kitab al-Saydalah'' (''The Book of Drugs''), in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist. [[Avicenna]], too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action, and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]''. Of great impact were also the works by [[Masawaih al-Mardini|al-Maridini of Baghdad]] and [[Cairo]], and [[Ibn al-Wafid]] (1008\u20131074), both of which were printed in [[Latin]] more than fifty times, appearing as ''De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus'' by '[[Mesue]]' the younger, and the ''Medicamentis simplicibus'' by '[[Abenguefit]]'. [[Peter of Abano]] (1250\u20131316) translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Maridini under the title ''De Veneris''. Al-Muwaffaq's contributions in the field are also pioneering. Living in the 10th century, he wrote ''The foundations of the true properties of Remedies'', amongst others describing [[arsenious oxide]], and being acquainted with [[silicic acid]]. He made clear distinction between [[sodium carbonate]] and [[potassium carbonate]], and drew attention to the poisonous nature of [[copper]] compounds, especially copper [[vitriol]], and also [[lead]] compounds.

It is the community pharmacy in which the dichotomy of the profession exists; health professionals who are also retailers.\n\n[[Community pharmacy|Community pharmacies]] usually consist of a retail storefront with a dispensary, where medications are stored and dispensed. According to Sharif Kaf al-Ghazal, the opening of the first drugstores are recorded by [[Islamic medicine|Muslim]] pharmacists in [[Baghdad]] in 754 AD.<ref name=Hadzovic /><ref>Sharif Kaf al-Ghazal, ''Journal of the International Society for the History of Islamic Medicine'', 2004 (3), pp. 3\u20139 [8].</ref>\n\nIn most countries, the dispensary is subject to pharmacy legislation; with requirements for storage conditions, compulsory texts, equipment, etc., specified in legislation. It was once the case that pharmacists stayed within the dispensary compounding/dispensing medications, but there has been an increasing trend towards the use of trained [[pharmacy technician]]s, with the pharmacist spending more time communicating with patients. Pharmacy technicians are now more dependent upon automation to assist them in their new role dealing with patients' prescriptions and patient safety issues.\n\nPharmacies are typically required to have a pharmacist on-duty at all times when they are open. It is also often a requirement for the owner of a pharmacy to be a registered pharmacist, but that is not the case in all jurisdictions, such that many [[retailer]]s (including [[supermarket]]s and [[Discount retail store|mass merchandiser]]s) now include a pharmacy as a department of their store.\n\nLikewise, many pharmacies are now rather grocery store-like in their design. In addition to medicines and prescriptions, many now sell a diverse arrangement of additional items such as [[cosmetics]], [[shampoo]], [[office supplies]], [[confections]], [[snack foods]], [[durable medical equipment]], [[greeting cards]], and provide [[photo processing]] services.\n\nCommunity pharmacies offer a unique added value by building direct relationships with their customers. They are able to provide more personalized, dedicated care to local members of their community and even offer enhanced services such as Medication Therapy Management (MTM), Medication Synchronization, and compounding. With the aid of [[pharmacy management system]]s and different integrated technologies, these smaller pharmacies are able to keep up with their large-scale competition. \n \nIn community pharmacy, [[Medical prescription|prescription]]s, [[medical devices]] and other [[over the counter]] products are dispensed by community pharmacists. Community pharmacists may be confronted with numerous ethical problems in their daily work. Ethical issues may exist while dispensing medications based on prescription and over the counter products. Community pharmacists\u2019 understanding of ethics, [[confidentiality]], patient [[autonomy]], [[trustworthiness]] and [[wikt:reliability|reliability]] may be the dynamics that affect community pharmacists\u2019 values which may influence their decision making during ethical dilemmas.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.5530/ijper.52.4s.95|title = Community Pharmacists' Perceptions and Experiences towards Values, Ethics and Decisionmaking: A Qualitative Study|journal = Indian Journal of Pharmaceutical Education and Research|volume = 52|issue = 4s|pages = S164\u2013S173|year = 2018|last1 = Rajiah|first1 = Kingston|last2 = Venaktaraman|first2 = Rajesh}}</ref> Most of the pharmacists face the ethical dilemma situations may be at least once a week in their pharmacies.

Some pharmacists in hospital pharmacies may have more complex clinical medication management issues, and pharmacists in community pharmacies often have more complex business and customer relations issues.\n\nBecause of the complexity of medications including specific indications, effectiveness of treatment regimens, safety of medications (i.e., drug interactions) and [[patient compliance]] issues (in the hospital and at home), many pharmacists practicing in hospitals gain more education and training after pharmacy school through a pharmacy practice residency and sometimes followed by another residency in a specific area. Those pharmacists are often referred to as clinical pharmacists and they often specialize in various disciplines of pharmacy.\n\nFor example, there are pharmacists who specialize in hematology/oncology, HIV/AIDS, infectious disease, critical care, [[emergency medicine]], toxicology, nuclear pharmacy, pain management, psychiatry, anti-coagulation clinics, [[Herbalism|herbal medicine]], neurology/epilepsy management, pediatrics, neonatal pharmacists and more.\n\nHospital pharmacies can often be found within the premises of the hospital. Hospital pharmacies usually stock a larger range of medications, including more specialized medications, than would be feasible in the community setting. Most hospital medications are unit-dose, or a single dose of medicine.  Hospital pharmacists and trained pharmacy technicians compound sterile products for patients including [[total parenteral nutrition]] (TPN), and other medications are given intravenously. That is a complex process that requires adequate training of personnel, [[Quality Assurance|quality assurance]] of products, and adequate facilities.\n\nSeveral hospital pharmacies have decided to [[outsource]] high-risk preparations and some other compounding functions to companies who specialize in compounding. The high cost of medications and drug-related technology and the potential impact of medications and pharmacy services on patient-care outcomes and patient safety require hospital pharmacies to perform at the highest level possible.\n\n===Clinical pharmacy===\n{{Main|Clinical pharmacy}}\n[[Pharmacists]] provide direct patient care services that optimize the use of medication and promotes health, wellness, and disease prevention.<ref>American College of Clinical Pharmacy.

Clinical pharmacists often collaborate with [[physician]]s and other healthcare professionals to improve pharmaceutical care. Clinical pharmacists are now an integral part of the interdisciplinary approach to patient care. They often participate in patient care rounds for drug product selection.\n\nThe clinical pharmacist's role involves creating a comprehensive drug therapy plan for patient-specific problems, identifying goals of therapy, and reviewing all prescribed medications prior to dispensing and administration to the patient. The review process often involves an evaluation of the appropriateness of drug therapy (e.g., drug choice, dose, route, frequency, and duration of therapy) and its efficacy. The pharmacist must also monitor for potential drug interactions, adverse drug reactions, and assess patient drug allergies while they design and initiate a drug therapy plan.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Burke JM, Miller WA, Spencer AP, etal | year = 2008 | title = Clinical pharmacist competencies | url = http://www.accp.com/docs/positions/whitePapers/CliniPharmCompTFfinalDraft.pdf | journal = Pharmacotherapy | volume = 28 | issue = 6| pages = 806\u2013815 | doi=10.1592/phco.28.6.806| pmid = 18503407 }}</ref>\n\n===Ambulatory care pharmacy===\nSince the emergence of modern clinical pharmacy, ambulatory care pharmacy practice has emerged as a unique pharmacy practice setting. Ambulatory care pharmacy is based primarily on pharmacotherapy services that a pharmacist provides in a clinic. Pharmacists in this setting often do not dispense drugs, but rather see patients in-office visits to manage chronic disease states.\n\nIn the U.S. federal health care system (including the VA, the Indian Health Service, and NIH) ambulatory care pharmacists are given full independent prescribing authority. In some states such [[North Carolina]] and [[New Mexico]] these pharmacist clinicians are given collaborative prescriptive and diagnostic authority.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 15719585 | year = 2005 | last1 = Knapp | first1 = KK | last2 = Okamoto | first2 = MP | last3 = Black | first3 = BL | title = ASHP survey of ambulatory care pharmacy practice in health systems\u20142004 | volume = 62 | issue = 3 | pages = 274\u201384 | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | doi=10.1093/ajhp/62.3.274}}</ref> In 2011 the board of Pharmaceutical Specialties approved ambulatory care pharmacy practice as a separate board certification.

This may include altering the strength, ingredients, or dosage form.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Research|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and|date=2018-11-03|title=Compounding and the FDA: Questions and Answers|url=https://www.fda.gov/drugs/human-drug-compounding/compounding-and-fda-questions-and-answers|journal=FDA|language=en}}</ref> Compounding is a way to create custom drugs for patients who may not be able to take the medication in its standard form, such as due to an allergy or difficulty swallowing. Compounding is necessary for these patients to still be able to properly get the prescriptions they need.\n\nOne area of compounding is preparing drugs in new dosage forms. For example, if a drug manufacturer only provides a drug as a tablet, a compounding pharmacist might make a medicated [[lollipop]] that contains the drug. Patients who have difficulty swallowing the tablet may prefer to suck the medicated lollipop instead.\n\nAnother form of compounding is by mixing different strengths (g, mg, mcg) of capsules or tablets to yield the desired amount of medication indicated by the [[physician]], [[physician assistant]], [[Nurse Practitioner]], or [[clinical pharmacist practitioner]]. This form of compounding is found at community or hospital pharmacies or in-home administration therapy.\n\nCompounding pharmacies specialize in compounding, although many also dispense the same non-compounded drugs that patients can obtain from community pharmacies.\n\n===Consultant pharmacy===\n{{Main|Consultant pharmacist}}\n{{Globalize|section|date=December 2019}}\nConsultant pharmacy practice focuses more on medication regimen review (i.e. \"cognitive services\") than on actual dispensing of drugs. Consultant pharmacists most typically work in [[nursing home]]s, but are increasingly branching into other institutions and non-institutional settings.<ref>American Society of Consultant Pharmacists, [http://www.ascp.com/about/ascpfactsheet.cfm Frequently Asked Questions]</ref> Traditionally{{where|date=December 2019}} consultant pharmacists were usually independent business owners, though in the United States many now work for a large pharmacy management company such as [[Omnicare]], [[Kindred Healthcare]] or [[PharMerica]]. This trend may be gradually reversing{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} as consultant pharmacists begin to work directly with patients, primarily because many elderly people are now taking numerous medications but continue to live outside of institutional settings. Some community pharmacies employ consultant pharmacists and/or provide consulting services.\n\nThe main principle of consultant pharmacy is developed by Hepler and Strand in 1990.<ref name=\"Pharmaceutical care and patient outcomes\">{{Cite journal|author=Strand LM |title=Pharmaceutical care and patient outcomes: notes on what it is we manage |journal=Top Hosp Pharm Manage. |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=77\u201384 |year=1990 |pmid=10128568 }}</ref><ref name=\"Responsibilities in pharmaceutical care\">{{Cite journal|vauthors=Hepler CD, Strand LM |title=Opportunities and responsibilities in pharmaceutical care |journal=Am J Hosp Pharm |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=533\u201343 |year=1990 |pmid=2316538 }}</ref>\n\n===Internet pharmacy===\n{{Main|Online pharmacy}}\n[[File:Mail order pharmacy dispensers.jpg|right|thumb|Canisters of pills from a mail order pharmacy.]]\nSince about the year 2000, a growing number of [[Internet]] pharmacies have been established worldwide.  Many of these pharmacies are similar to community pharmacies, and in fact, many of them are actually operated by [[Bricks and mortar business|brick-and-mortar]] community pharmacies that serve consumers online and those that walk in their door.  The primary difference is the method by which the medications are requested and received. Some customers consider this to be more convenient and private method rather than traveling to a community drugstore where another customer might overhear about the drugs that they take. Internet pharmacies (also known as online pharmacies) are also recommended to some patients by their physicians if they are home-bound.\n\nWhile most Internet pharmacies sell [[prescription drug]]s and require a valid prescription, some Internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs without requiring a prescription.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}  Some customers order drugs from such pharmacies to avoid the \"inconvenience\" of visiting a doctor, or to obtain medications which their doctors were unwilling to prescribe. However, this practice has been criticized as potentially dangerous, especially by those who feel that only doctors can reliably assess contraindications, risk/benefit ratios, and an individual's overall suitability for use of medication. There also have been reports of such pharmacies dispensing substandard products.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/ForHealthProfessionals/UCM330640.pdf|title=Protecting Patients from Counterfeit and Other Substandard Drugs/Supply Chain Threats}}</ref>\n\nOf particular concern with Internet pharmacies is the ease with which people, youth in particular, can obtain [[controlled substances]] (e.g., [[Vicodin]], generically known as [[hydrocodone]]) via the Internet without a prescription issued by a doctor/practitioner who has an established doctor-patient relationship.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}  There are instances where a practitioner issues a prescription, brokered by an Internet server, for a controlled substance to a \"patient\" s/he has never met.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} In the United States, in order for a prescription for a controlled substance to be valid, it must be issued for a legitimate medical purpose by a licensed practitioner acting in the course of legitimate doctor-patient relationship. The filling pharmacy has a corresponding responsibility to ensure that the prescription is valid. Often, individual state laws outline what defines a valid patient-doctor relationship. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is also heavily involved in monitoring internet pharmacies and has issued warnings against several companies who have violated the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that protects individuals against rogue online pharmacies.\n\nCanada is home to dozens of licensed Internet pharmacies, many of which sell their lower-cost prescription drugs to U.S. consumers (who must otherwise pay one of the world's highest drug prices).<ref>London Free Press Regional News Archive, [http://canada.regional-news.org/2005-11-canada-internet-pharmacy-merged-in-38-million-deal.html Canada Internet Pharmacy Merged In $3.8 Million Deal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426022604/http://canada.regional-news.org/2005-11-canada-internet-pharmacy-merged-in-38-million-deal.html |date=26 April 2012 }}</ref> In recent years, many consumers in the US (and in other countries with high drug costs), have turned to licensed Internet pharmacies in India, Israel, and the UK, which often have even lower prices than in Canada.\n\nIn the [[United States]], there has been a push to legalize the importation of medications from [[Canada]] and other countries,{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} in order to reduce consumer costs. While in most cases importation of prescription medications violates [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulations and federal laws, enforcement is generally targeted at international drug suppliers, rather than consumers.  There is no known case of any U.S. citizens buying Canadian drugs for personal use with a prescription, who has ever been charged by authorities.\n\n===Veterinary pharmacy===\n{{Main|Veterinary pharmacy}}\nVeterinary pharmacies, sometimes called ''animal pharmacies'', may fall in the category of hospital pharmacy, retail pharmacy or mail-order pharmacy. Veterinary pharmacies stock different varieties and different strengths of medications to fulfill the pharmaceutical needs of animals.  Because the needs of animals, as well as the regulations on [[veterinary medicine]], are often very different from those related to people, in some jurisdictions veterinary pharmacy may be  kept separate from regular pharmacies.\n\n===Nuclear pharmacy===\n{{Main|Nuclear pharmacy}}\nNuclear pharmacy focuses on preparing radioactive materials for diagnostic tests and for treating certain diseases. Nuclear pharmacists undergo additional training specific to handling radioactive materials, and unlike in community and hospital pharmacies, nuclear pharmacists typically do not interact directly with patients.\n\n===Military pharmacy===\n{{Globalize|section|date=December 2019}}\n[[File:332nd EMSG Pharmacy Tech DVIDS328212.jpg|thumb|Airman 1st Class Breanna DeMasters and Staff Sgt.

In Asian countries, it is traditional for physicians to also provide drugs.\n\nIn contemporary time researchers and health policy analysts have more deeply considered these traditions and their effects. Advocates for separation and advocates for combining make similar claims for each of their conflicting perspectives, saying that separating or combining reduces [[conflict of interest in the healthcare industry]], [[unnecessary health care]], and lowers costs, while the opposite causes those things. Research in various places reports mixed outcomes in different circumstances.\n\n===The future of pharmacy===\n[[File:A U.S. Soldier with the Special Warfare Medical Group(Airborne), speaks to Dr 110228-A-GV060-946.jpg|thumb|Pharmacists now go on rounds with doctors and have more patient interaction.]]\nIn the coming decades, pharmacists are expected to become more integral within the [[health care system]]. Rather than simply dispensing medication, pharmacists are increasingly expected to be compensated for their patient care skills.<ref>American College of Clinical Pharmacy, [http://www.accp.com/position/pos029.pdf Evidence of the Economic Benefit of Clinical Pharmacy Services:  1996\u20132000]</ref> In particular, [[Medication Therapy Management]] (MTM) includes the clinical services that pharmacists can provide for their patients.  Such services include a thorough analysis of all medication ([[prescription medication|prescription]], non-prescription, and herbals) currently being taken by an individual.  The result is a reconciliation of medication and patient education resulting in increased patient health outcomes and decreased costs to the health care system.<ref>American Pharmacy Student Alliance (APSA){{Unreliable source?|date=July 2011}}</ref>\n\nThis shift has already commenced in some countries; for instance, pharmacists in [[Australia]] receive remuneration from the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] for conducting comprehensive Home Medicines Reviews. In Canada, pharmacists in certain provinces have limited prescribing rights (as in Alberta and British Columbia) or are remunerated by their provincial government for expanded services such as medications reviews (Medschecks in Ontario). In the United Kingdom, pharmacists who undertake additional training are obtaining prescribing rights and this is because of [[pharmacy education]]. They are also being paid for by the government for [[medicine use review]]s. In Scotland, the pharmacist can write prescriptions for Scottish registered patients of their regular medications, for the majority of drugs, except for controlled drugs, when the patient is unable to see their doctor, as could happen if they are away from home or the doctor is unavailable. In the United States, pharmaceutical care or [[clinical pharmacy]] has had an evolving influence on the practice of pharmacy.<ref name=\"Clinical Pharmacy Defined\">American College of Clinical Pharmacy, [http://www.accp.com/clinical_pharmacy.php Clinical Pharmacy Defined]</ref> Moreover, the [[Doctor of Pharmacy]] (Pharm. D.) degree is now required before entering practice and some pharmacists now complete one or two years of residency or fellowship training following graduation.  In addition, [[consultant pharmacist]]s, who traditionally operated primarily in [[nursing home]]s are now expanding into direct consultation with patients, under the banner of \"senior care pharmacy\".<ref>[[American Society of Consultant Pharmacists]], [http://www.ascp.com/consumers/what/ What is a Senior Care Pharmacist?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023213917/http://www.ascp.com/consumers/what/ |date=23 October 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to patient care, pharmacies will be a focal point for medical adherence initiatives. There is enough evidence to show that integrated pharmacy based initiatives significantly impact adherence for chronic patients. For example, a study published in NIH shows \"pharmacy based interventions improved patients' medication adherence rates by 2.1 percent and increased physicians' initiation rates by 38 percent, compared to the control group\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brennan|first=Troyen A.|last2=Dollear|first2=Timothy J.|last3=Hu|first3=Min|last4=Matlin|first4=Olga S.|last5=Shrank|first5=William H.|last6=Choudhry|first6=Niteesh K.|last7=Grambley|first7=William|date=1 January 2012|title=An integrated pharmacy-based program improved medication prescription and adherence rates in diabetes patients|journal=Health Affairs (Project Hope)|volume=31|issue=1|pages=120\u2013129|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2011.0931|issn=1544-5208|pmid=22232102}}</ref>\n\n==Pharmacy journals==\n* [[List of Pharmacy Journals]]\n\n==Symbols==\nThe [[symbol]]s most commonly associated with pharmacy are the [[mortar and pestle]] (North America) and the \u211e ([[Medical prescription]]) character, which is often written as \"Rx\" in typed text; the green [[Greek cross]] in [[France]], [[Argentina]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Belgium]], [[Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], and [[India]]; the [[Bowl of Hygieia]] (only) often used in the [[Netherlands]] but may be seen combined with other symbols elsewhere.

It is a miscellaneous science as it links [[health science]]s with [[pharmaceutical science]]s and [[natural science]]s. The professional practice is becoming more clinically oriented as most of the drugs are now manufactured by pharmaceutical industries. Based on the setting, the pharmacy is classified as a community or institutional pharmacy. Providing direct patient care in the community of institutional pharmacies are considered clinical pharmacy.<ref name=\"Thomas_2019\">{{cite book| vauthors = Thomas D | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Jp7DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1|title=Clinical Pharmacy Education, Practice and Research | date = November 2018 | isbn = 9780128142769}}</ref>\n\nThe scope of pharmacy practice includes more traditional roles such as [[compounding]] and dispensing of medications, and it also includes more modern services related to [[health care]], including clinical services, reviewing medications for safety and efficacy, and providing [[drug]] information. [[Pharmacist]]s, therefore, are the experts on drug therapy and are the primary health professionals who optimize the use of medication for the benefit of the patients.\n\nAn establishment in which pharmacy (in the first sense) is practiced is called a ''pharmacy'' (this term is more common in the United States) or a ''chemist's'' (which is more common in Great Britain). In the United States and Canada, ''[[drugstore]]s'' commonly sell [[medicines]], as well as miscellaneous items such as [[confectionery]], [[cosmetics]], [[office supplies]], [[toy]]s, [[hair care]] products and [[magazine]]s and occasionally refreshments and groceries.\n\nIn its investigation of herbal and chemical ingredients, the work of the pharma may be regarded as a precursor of the modern sciences of [[chemistry]] and [[pharmacology]], prior to the formulation of the [[scientific method]].\n\n==Disciplines==\n[[File:42-aspetti di vita quotidiana, medicine,Taccuino Sanitatis, .jpg|thumb|Pharmacy, ''[[Tacuinum sanitatis]]'' casanatensis (14th century)]]\nThe field of pharmacy can generally be divided into three primary disciplines:\n*[[Pharmaceutics]] \n*[[Medicinal Chemistry]] and [[Pharmacognosy]]\n*Pharmacy Practice\n\nThe boundaries between these disciplines and with other sciences, such as biochemistry, are not always clear-cut.\nOften, collaborative teams from various disciplines (pharmacists and other scientists) work together toward the introduction of new therapeutics and methods for patient care. However, pharmacy is not a basic or biomedical science in its typical form. Medicinal chemistry is also a distinct branch of synthetic chemistry combining pharmacology, organic chemistry, and chemical biology.\n\n[[Pharmacology]] is sometimes considered as the 4th discipline of pharmacy. Although pharmacology is essential to the study of pharmacy, it is not specific to pharmacy. Both disciplines are distinct. Those who wish to practice both pharmacy (patient-oriented) and pharmacology (a biomedical science requiring the scientific method) receive separate training and degrees unique to either discipline.\n\n[[Pharmacoinformatics]] is considered another new discipline, for systematic drug discovery and development with efficiency and safety.\n\nPharmacogenomics is the study of genetic-linked variants that effect patient clinical responses, allergies, and metabolism of drugs. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/genomicresearch/pharmacogenomics|title=What is pharmacogenomics?|last=Reference|first=Genetics Home|website=Genetics Home Reference|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref>\n\n==Professionals==\nThe [[World Health Organization]] estimates that there are at least 2.6 million pharmacists and other pharmaceutical personnel worldwide.<ref>World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/whosis/whostat/2011/en/index.html ''World Health Statistics 2011''] \u2013 Table 6: Health workforce, infrastructure, and essential medicines. Geneva, 2011.

Pharmacists may also be [[small business|small-business]] proprietors, owning the pharmacy in which they practice. Since pharmacists know about the mode of action of a particular drug, and its metabolism and physiological effects on the human body in great detail, they play an important role in optimization of drug treatment for an individual.\n\nPharmacists are represented internationally by the [[International Pharmaceutical Federation]] (FIP). They are represented at the national level by [[professional body|professional organisations]] such as the [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society]] in the UK, [[Pharmacy Guild of Australia]] (PSA), [[Canadian Pharmacists Association]] (CPhA), [[Indian Pharmacist Association]] (IPA), [[Pakistan Pharmacists Association]] (PPA), and the [[American Pharmacists Association]] (APhA). (''See also: [[List of pharmacy associations]].)''\n\nIn some cases, the representative body is also the registering body, which is responsible for the regulation and [[ethics]] of the profession.\n\nIn the United States, specializations in pharmacy practice recognized by the [[Board of Pharmacy Specialties]] include: cardiovascular, [[infectious disease]], [[oncology]], pharmacotherapy, nuclear, [[nutrition]], and [[psychiatry]].<ref>Board of Pharmacy Specialties, [http://www.bpsweb.org/03_Specialties_Current.html, Current Specialties]</ref> The [[Commission for Certification in Geriatric Pharmacy]] certifies pharmacists in geriatric pharmacy practice. The [[American Board of Applied Toxicology]] certifies pharmacists and other medical professionals in applied [[toxicology]].\n\n===Pharmacy technicians===\n{{Main|Pharmacy technician}}\n\nPharmacy technicians support the work of pharmacists and other health professionals by performing a variety of pharmacy-related functions, including dispensing prescription drugs and other medical devices to patients and instructing on their use. They may also perform administrative duties in pharmaceutical practice, such as reviewing prescription requests with medic's offices and insurance companies to ensure correct medications are provided and payment is received.\n\nA Pharmacy Technician in the UK has recently been referred to by some as a professional. Legislation requires the supervision of certain pharmacy technician's activities by a pharmacist. The majority of pharmacy technicians work in community pharmacies. In hospital pharmacies, pharmacy technicians may be managed by other senior pharmacy technicians. In the UK the role of a PhT in hospital pharmacy has grown and responsibility has been passed on to them to manage the pharmacy department and specialized areas in pharmacy practice allowing pharmacists the time to specialize in their expert field as medication consultants spending more time working with patients and in research. Pharmacy technicians are registered with the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC). The GPhC is the regulator of pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and pharmacy premises.\n\nIn the US, pharmacy technicians perform their duties under the supervision of pharmacists. Although they may perform, under supervision, most dispensing, compounding and other tasks, they are not generally allowed to perform the role of counseling patients on the proper use of their medications.\n\n== Education requirements ==\n{{Worldwide|section|date=December 2019}}\nThere are different requirements of schooling according to the national jurisdiction where the student intends to practise. \n===United States===\n<!-- It appears that there is also a Batchelor degree but if so then it needs its own citation -->\nIn the United States, general pharmacist will attain a Doctor of Pharmacy Degree (Pharm.D.).

In a student's third professional year in pharmacy school, it is required to pass the Pharmacy Curriculum Outcomes Assessment (PCOA). Once the Pharm.D. is attained after the fourth year professional school, the student is then eligible to take the North American Pharmacist Licensure Exam (NAPLEX) and the Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Exam (MPJE) to work as a professional pharmacist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pharmacy.ku.edu/sites/pharmacy.ku.edu/files/files/student%20handbooks/2017-2018%20Student%20Handbook%20v2017_08_18.pdf|title=Pharmacy Student Handbook 2017\u20132018|date=August 2017|website=KU Pharmacy|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of pharmacy|List of pharmacists}}\n[[File:Legenogapotekeren.jpg|thumb|Physician and Pharmacist, illustration from ''Medicinarius'' (1505) by [[Hieronymus Brunschwig]].]]\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:Scientific chemistry and pharmacy.jpg|thumb|Pharmacy in medieval [[Muslim world]].]] -->\n\nThe earliest known compilation of medicinal substances was the ''[[Sushruta Samhita]]'', an Indian [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic treatise]] attributed to [[Sushruta]] in the 6th century BC.

Earlier literature included lists of prescriptions for specific ailments, exemplified by a manuscript \"Recipes for 52 Ailments\", found in the [[Mawangdui]], sealed in 168 BC.\n\nIn Japan, at the end of the [[Asuka period]] (538\u2013710) and the early [[Nara period]] (710\u2013794), the men who fulfilled roles similar to those of modern pharmacists were highly respected.  The place of pharmacists in society was expressly defined in the [[Taih\u014d Code]] (701) and re-stated in the [[Y\u014dr\u014d Code]] (718).  Ranked positions in the pre-[[Heian period|Heian]] Imperial court were established; and this organizational structure remained largely intact until the [[Meiji Restoration]] (1868).  In this highly stable hierarchy, the pharmacists\u2014and even pharmacist assistants\u2014were assigned status superior to all others in health-related fields such as physicians and acupuncturists. In the Imperial household, the pharmacist was even ranked above the two personal physicians of the Emperor.<ref>Titsingh, Isaac.

[[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi]] (Abulcasis) (936\u20131013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]] and [[distillation]]. His ''Liber servitoris'' is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the 'simples' from which were [[compounding|compounded]] the complex drugs then generally used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however, the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia, describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. [[Al-Biruni]] (973\u20131050) wrote one of the most valuable Islamic works on pharmacology, entitled ''Kitab al-Saydalah'' (''The Book of Drugs''), in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist. [[Avicenna]], too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action, and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]''. Of great impact were also the works by [[Masawaih al-Mardini|al-Maridini of Baghdad]] and [[Cairo]], and [[Ibn al-Wafid]] (1008\u20131074), both of which were printed in [[Latin]] more than fifty times, appearing as ''De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus'' by '[[Mesue]]' the younger, and the ''Medicamentis simplicibus'' by '[[Abenguefit]]'. [[Peter of Abano]] (1250\u20131316) translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Maridini under the title ''De Veneris''. Al-Muwaffaq's contributions in the field are also pioneering. Living in the 10th century, he wrote ''The foundations of the true properties of Remedies'', amongst others describing [[arsenious oxide]], and being acquainted with [[silicic acid]]. He made clear distinction between [[sodium carbonate]] and [[potassium carbonate]], and drew attention to the poisonous nature of [[copper]] compounds, especially copper [[vitriol]], and also [[lead]] compounds. He also describes the [[Distilled water|distillation of sea-water]] for drinking.<ref>Levey M. (1973), \u2018 Early Arabic Pharmacology', E. J. Brill; Leiden.</ref>{{Verify source|date=September 2010}}\n\nIn [[Europe]] pharmacy-like shops began to appear during the 12th century.

Pharmacists themselves may have expertise in a [[Specialty (medicine)|medical specialty]].\n\n===Community pharmacy===\n[[Image:NatMuseum.Ravenna.jpg|thumb|right|19th-century Italian pharmacy]]\n[[File:Ancienne Pharmacie avec symboles sur la mur.JPG|thumb|Classic symbols at the wall of a former German pharmacy]]\n[[Image:Selvvalg.jpg|thumb|right|Modern pharmacy in Norway]]\n{{See also|Community pharmacy|Pharmacy automation}}\n\nA ''pharmacy'' (commonly the ''chemist'' in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]]; or ''drugstore'' in [[North America]]; ''retail pharmacy'' in industry terminology; or [[apothecary]], historically) is where most pharmacists practice the profession of pharmacy. It is the community pharmacy in which the dichotomy of the profession exists; health professionals who are also retailers.\n\n[[Community pharmacy|Community pharmacies]] usually consist of a retail storefront with a dispensary, where medications are stored and dispensed. According to Sharif Kaf al-Ghazal, the opening of the first drugstores are recorded by [[Islamic medicine|Muslim]] pharmacists in [[Baghdad]] in 754 AD.<ref name=Hadzovic /><ref>Sharif Kaf al-Ghazal, ''Journal of the International Society for the History of Islamic Medicine'', 2004 (3), pp. 3\u20139 [8].</ref>\n\nIn most countries, the dispensary is subject to pharmacy legislation; with requirements for storage conditions, compulsory texts, equipment, etc., specified in legislation. It was once the case that pharmacists stayed within the dispensary compounding/dispensing medications, but there has been an increasing trend towards the use of trained [[pharmacy technician]]s, with the pharmacist spending more time communicating with patients. Pharmacy technicians are now more dependent upon automation to assist them in their new role dealing with patients' prescriptions and patient safety issues.\n\nPharmacies are typically required to have a pharmacist on-duty at all times when they are open. It is also often a requirement for the owner of a pharmacy to be a registered pharmacist, but that is not the case in all jurisdictions, such that many [[retailer]]s (including [[supermarket]]s and [[Discount retail store|mass merchandiser]]s) now include a pharmacy as a department of their store.\n\nLikewise, many pharmacies are now rather grocery store-like in their design. In addition to medicines and prescriptions, many now sell a diverse arrangement of additional items such as [[cosmetics]], [[shampoo]], [[office supplies]], [[confections]], [[snack foods]], [[durable medical equipment]], [[greeting cards]], and provide [[photo processing]] services.\n\nCommunity pharmacies offer a unique added value by building direct relationships with their customers. They are able to provide more personalized, dedicated care to local members of their community and even offer enhanced services such as Medication Therapy Management (MTM), Medication Synchronization, and compounding. With the aid of [[Pharmacy management system|pharmacy management systems]] and different integrated technologies, these smaller pharmacies are able to keep up with their large-scale competition. \n \nIn community pharmacy, [[Medical prescription|prescription]]s, [[medical devices]] and other [[over the counter]] products are dispensed by community pharmacists. Community pharmacists may be confronted with numerous ethical problems in their daily work. Ethical issues may exist while dispensing medications based on prescription and over the counter products. Community pharmacists\u2019 understanding of ethics, [[confidentiality]], patient [[autonomy]], [[trustworthiness]] and [[wikt:reliability|reliability]] may be the dynamics that affect community pharmacists\u2019 values which may influence their decision making during ethical dilemmas.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.5530/ijper.52.4s.95|title = Community Pharmacists' Perceptions and Experiences towards Values, Ethics and Decisionmaking: A Qualitative Study|journal = Indian Journal of Pharmaceutical Education and Research|volume = 52|issue = 4s|pages = S164\u2013S173|year = 2018|last1 = Rajiah|first1 = Kingston|last2 = Venaktaraman|first2 = Rajesh}}</ref> Most of the pharmacists face the ethical dilemma situations may be at least once a week in their pharmacies.

Some pharmacists in hospital pharmacies may have more complex clinical medication management issues, and pharmacists in community pharmacies often have more complex business and customer relations issues.\n\nBecause of the complexity of medications including specific indications, effectiveness of treatment regimens, safety of medications (i.e., drug interactions) and [[patient compliance]] issues (in the hospital and at home), many pharmacists practicing in hospitals gain more education and training after pharmacy school through a pharmacy practice residency and sometimes followed by another residency in a specific area. Those pharmacists are often referred to as clinical pharmacists and they often specialize in various disciplines of pharmacy.\n\nFor example, there are pharmacists who specialize in hematology/oncology, HIV/AIDS, infectious disease, critical care, [[emergency medicine]], toxicology, nuclear pharmacy, pain management, psychiatry, anti-coagulation clinics, [[Herbalism|herbal medicine]], neurology/epilepsy management, pediatrics, neonatal pharmacists and more.\n\nHospital pharmacies can often be found within the premises of the hospital. Hospital pharmacies usually stock a larger range of medications, including more specialized medications, than would be feasible in the community setting. Most hospital medications are unit-dose, or a single dose of medicine.  Hospital pharmacists and trained pharmacy technicians compound sterile products for patients including [[total parenteral nutrition]] (TPN), and other medications are given intravenously. That is a complex process that requires adequate training of personnel, [[Quality Assurance|quality assurance]] of products, and adequate facilities.\n\nSeveral hospital pharmacies have decided to [[outsource]] high-risk preparations and some other compounding functions to companies who specialize in compounding. The high cost of medications and drug-related technology and the potential impact of medications and pharmacy services on patient-care outcomes and patient safety require hospital pharmacies to perform at the highest level possible.\n\n===Clinical pharmacy===\n{{Main|Clinical pharmacy}}\n[[Pharmacists]] provide direct patient care services that optimize the use of medication and promotes health, wellness, and disease prevention.<ref>American College of Clinical Pharmacy.

Clinical pharmacists often collaborate with [[physician]]s and other healthcare professionals to improve pharmaceutical care. Clinical pharmacists are now an integral part of the interdisciplinary approach to patient care. They often participate in patient care rounds for drug product selection.\n\nThe clinical pharmacist's role involves creating a comprehensive drug therapy plan for patient-specific problems, identifying goals of therapy, and reviewing all prescribed medications prior to dispensing and administration to the patient. The review process often involves an evaluation of the appropriateness of drug therapy (e.g., drug choice, dose, route, frequency, and duration of therapy) and its efficacy. The pharmacist must also monitor for potential drug interactions, adverse drug reactions, and assess patient drug allergies while they design and initiate a drug therapy plan.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Burke JM, Miller WA, Spencer AP, etal | year = 2008 | title = Clinical pharmacist competencies | url = http://www.accp.com/docs/positions/whitePapers/CliniPharmCompTFfinalDraft.pdf | journal = Pharmacotherapy | volume = 28 | issue = 6| pages = 806\u2013815 | doi=10.1592/phco.28.6.806| pmid = 18503407 }}</ref>\n\n===Ambulatory care pharmacy===\nSince the emergence of modern clinical pharmacy, ambulatory care pharmacy practice has emerged as a unique pharmacy practice setting. Ambulatory care pharmacy is based primarily on pharmacotherapy services that a pharmacist provides in a clinic. Pharmacists in this setting often do not dispense drugs, but rather see patients in-office visits to manage chronic disease states.\n\nIn the U.S. federal health care system (including the VA, the Indian Health Service, and NIH) ambulatory care pharmacists are given full independent prescribing authority. In some states such [[North Carolina]] and [[New Mexico]] these pharmacist clinicians are given collaborative prescriptive and diagnostic authority.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 15719585 | year = 2005 | last1 = Knapp | first1 = KK | last2 = Okamoto | first2 = MP | last3 = Black | first3 = BL | title = ASHP survey of ambulatory care pharmacy practice in health systems\u20142004 | volume = 62 | issue = 3 | pages = 274\u201384 | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | doi=10.1093/ajhp/62.3.274}}</ref> In 2011 the board of Pharmaceutical Specialties approved ambulatory care pharmacy practice as a separate board certification.

This may include altering the strength, ingredients, or dosage form.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Research|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and|date=2018-11-03|title=Compounding and the FDA: Questions and Answers|url=https://www.fda.gov/drugs/human-drug-compounding/compounding-and-fda-questions-and-answers|journal=FDA|language=en}}</ref> Compounding is a way to create custom drugs for patients who may not be able to take the medication in its standard form, such as due to an allergy or difficulty swallowing. Compounding is necessary for these patients to still be able to properly get the prescriptions they need.\n\nOne area of compounding is preparing drugs in new dosage forms. For example, if a drug manufacturer only provides a drug as a tablet, a compounding pharmacist might make a medicated [[lollipop]] that contains the drug. Patients who have difficulty swallowing the tablet may prefer to suck the medicated lollipop instead.\n\nAnother form of compounding is by mixing different strengths (g, mg, mcg) of capsules or tablets to yield the desired amount of medication indicated by the [[physician]], [[physician assistant]], [[Nurse Practitioner]], or [[clinical pharmacist practitioner]]. This form of compounding is found at community or hospital pharmacies or in-home administration therapy.\n\nCompounding pharmacies specialize in compounding, although many also dispense the same non-compounded drugs that patients can obtain from community pharmacies.\n\n===Consultant pharmacy===\n{{Main|Consultant pharmacist}}\n{{Worldwide|section|date=December 2019}}\nConsultant pharmacy practice focuses more on medication regimen review (i.e. \"cognitive services\") than on actual dispensing of drugs. Consultant pharmacists most typically work in [[nursing home]]s, but are increasingly branching into other institutions and non-institutional settings.<ref>American Society of Consultant Pharmacists, [http://www.ascp.com/about/ascpfactsheet.cfm Frequently Asked Questions]</ref> Traditionally{{where|date=December 2019}} consultant pharmacists were usually independent business owners, though in the United States many now work for a large pharmacy management company such as [[Omnicare]], [[Kindred Healthcare]] or [[PharMerica]]. This trend may be gradually reversing{{cn|date=December 2019}} as consultant pharmacists begin to work directly with patients, primarily because many elderly people are now taking numerous medications but continue to live outside of institutional settings. Some community pharmacies employ consultant pharmacists and/or provide consulting services.\n\nThe main principle of consultant pharmacy is developed by Hepler and Strand in 1990.<ref name=\"Pharmaceutical care and patient outcomes\">{{Cite journal|author=Strand LM |title=Pharmaceutical care and patient outcomes: notes on what it is we manage |journal=Top Hosp Pharm Manage. |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=77\u201384 |year=1990 |pmid=10128568 }}</ref><ref name=\"Responsibilities in pharmaceutical care\">{{Cite journal|vauthors=Hepler CD, Strand LM |title=Opportunities and responsibilities in pharmaceutical care |journal=Am J Hosp Pharm |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=533\u201343 |year=1990 |pmid=2316538 }}</ref>\n\n===Internet pharmacy===\n{{Main|Online pharmacy}}\n[[File:Mail order pharmacy dispensers.jpg|right|thumb|Canisters of pills from a mail order pharmacy.]]\nSince about the year 2000, a growing number of [[Internet]] pharmacies have been established worldwide.  Many of these pharmacies are similar to community pharmacies, and in fact, many of them are actually operated by [[Bricks and mortar business|brick-and-mortar]] community pharmacies that serve consumers online and those that walk in their door.  The primary difference is the method by which the medications are requested and received. Some customers consider this to be more convenient and private method rather than traveling to a community drugstore where another customer might overhear about the drugs that they take. Internet pharmacies (also known as online pharmacies) are also recommended to some patients by their physicians if they are home-bound.\n\nWhile most Internet pharmacies sell [[prescription drug]]s and require a valid prescription, some Internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs without requiring a prescription.{{cn|date=December 2019}}  Some customers order drugs from such pharmacies to avoid the \"inconvenience\" of visiting a doctor, or to obtain medications which their doctors were unwilling to prescribe. However, this practice has been criticized as potentially dangerous, especially by those who feel that only doctors can reliably assess contraindications, risk/benefit ratios, and an individual's overall suitability for use of medication. There also have been reports of such pharmacies dispensing substandard products.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/ForHealthProfessionals/UCM330640.pdf|title=Protecting Patients from Counterfeit and Other Substandard Drugs/Supply Chain Threats}}</ref>\n\nOf particular concern with Internet pharmacies is the ease with which people, youth in particular, can obtain [[controlled substances]] (e.g., [[Vicodin]], generically known as [[hydrocodone]]) via the Internet without a prescription issued by a doctor/practitioner who has an established doctor-patient relationship.{{cn|date=December 2019}}  There are instances where a practitioner issues a prescription, brokered by an Internet server, for a controlled substance to a \"patient\" s/he has never met.{{cn|date=December 2019}} In the United States, in order for a prescription for a controlled substance to be valid, it must be issued for a legitimate medical purpose by a licensed practitioner acting in the course of legitimate doctor-patient relationship. The filling pharmacy has a corresponding responsibility to ensure that the prescription is valid. Often, individual state laws outline what defines a valid patient-doctor relationship. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is also heavily involved in monitoring internet pharmacies and has issued warnings against several companies who have violated the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that protects individuals against rogue online pharmacies.\n\nCanada is home to dozens of licensed Internet pharmacies, many of which sell their lower-cost prescription drugs to U.S. consumers (who must otherwise pay one of the world's highest drug prices).<ref>London Free Press Regional News Archive, [http://canada.regional-news.org/2005-11-canada-internet-pharmacy-merged-in-38-million-deal.html Canada Internet Pharmacy Merged In $3.8 Million Deal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426022604/http://canada.regional-news.org/2005-11-canada-internet-pharmacy-merged-in-38-million-deal.html |date=26 April 2012 }}</ref> In recent years, many consumers in the US (and in other countries with high drug costs), have turned to licensed Internet pharmacies in India, Israel, and the UK, which often have even lower prices than in Canada.\n\nIn the [[United States]], there has been a push to legalize the importation of medications from [[Canada]] and other countries,{{cn|date=December 2019}} in order to reduce consumer costs. While in most cases importation of prescription medications violates [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulations and federal laws, enforcement is generally targeted at international drug suppliers, rather than consumers.  There is no known case of any U.S. citizens buying Canadian drugs for personal use with a prescription, who has ever been charged by authorities.\n\n===Veterinary pharmacy===\n{{Main|Veterinary pharmacy}}\nVeterinary pharmacies, sometimes called ''animal pharmacies'', may fall in the category of hospital pharmacy, retail pharmacy or mail-order pharmacy. Veterinary pharmacies stock different varieties and different strengths of medications to fulfill the pharmaceutical needs of animals.  Because the needs of animals, as well as the regulations on [[veterinary medicine]], are often very different from those related to people, in some jurisdictions veterinary pharmacy may be  kept separate from regular pharmacies.\n\n===Nuclear pharmacy===\n{{Main|Nuclear pharmacy}}\nNuclear pharmacy focuses on preparing radioactive materials for diagnostic tests and for treating certain diseases. Nuclear pharmacists undergo additional training specific to handling radioactive materials, and unlike in community and hospital pharmacies, nuclear pharmacists typically do not interact directly with patients.\n\n===Military pharmacy===\n{{Worldwide|section|date=December 2019}}\n[[File:332nd EMSG Pharmacy Tech DVIDS328212.jpg|thumb|Airman 1st Class Breanna DeMasters and Staff Sgt.

These shared fundamental concepts further the understanding of their applicability to all aspects of [[pharmaceutical research]] and [[drug therapy]].\n\n[[Pharmacocybernetics]] (also known as pharma-cybernetics, cybernetic pharmacy, and cyber pharmacy) is an emerging field that describes the science of supporting drugs and medications use through the application and evaluation of informatics and internet technologies, so as to improve the [[pharmaceutical care]] of patients.<ref name=\"Yap Pharmaco-cybernetics as an interactive component of pharma-culture\">Yap KY, Chuang X, Lee AJM, Lee RZ, Lim L, Lim JJ, Nimesha R.

In Asian countries, it is traditional for physicians to also provide drugs.\n\nIn contemporary time researchers and health policy analysts have more deeply considered these traditions and their effects. Advocates for separation and advocates for combining make similar claims for each of their conflicting perspectives, saying that separating or combining reduces [[conflict of interest in the healthcare industry]], [[unnecessary health care]], and lowers costs, while the opposite causes those things. Research in various places reports mixed outcomes in different circumstances.\n\n===The future of pharmacy===\n[[File:A U.S. Soldier with the Special Warfare Medical Group(Airborne), speaks to Dr 110228-A-GV060-946.jpg|thumb|Pharmacists now go on rounds with doctors and have more patient interaction. ]]\nIn the coming decades, pharmacists are expected to become more integral within the [[health care system]]. Rather than simply dispensing medication, pharmacists are increasingly expected to be compensated for their patient care skills.<ref>American College of Clinical Pharmacy, [http://www.accp.com/position/pos029.pdf Evidence of the Economic Benefit of Clinical Pharmacy Services:  1996\u20132000]</ref> In particular, [[Medication Therapy Management]] (MTM) includes the clinical services that pharmacists can provide for their patients.  Such services include a thorough analysis of all medication ([[prescription medication|prescription]], non-prescription, and herbals) currently being taken by an individual.  The result is a reconciliation of medication and patient education resulting in increased patient health outcomes and decreased costs to the health care system.<ref>American Pharmacy Student Alliance (APSA){{Unreliable source?|date=July 2011}}</ref>\n\nThis shift has already commenced in some countries; for instance, pharmacists in [[Australia]] receive remuneration from the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] for conducting comprehensive Home Medicines Reviews. In Canada, pharmacists in certain provinces have limited prescribing rights (as in Alberta and British Columbia) or are remunerated by their provincial government for expanded services such as medications reviews (Medschecks in Ontario). In the United Kingdom, pharmacists who undertake additional training are obtaining prescribing rights and this is because of [[pharmacy education]]. They are also being paid for by the government for [[medicine use review]]s. In Scotland, the pharmacist can write prescriptions for Scottish registered patients of their regular medications, for the majority of drugs, except for controlled drugs, when the patient is unable to see their doctor, as could happen if they are away from home or the doctor is unavailable. In the United States, pharmaceutical care or [[clinical pharmacy]] has had an evolving influence on the practice of pharmacy.<ref name=\"Clinical Pharmacy Defined\">American College of Clinical Pharmacy, [http://www.accp.com/clinical_pharmacy.php Clinical Pharmacy Defined]</ref> Moreover, the [[Doctor of Pharmacy]] (Pharm. D.) degree is now required before entering practice and some pharmacists now complete one or two years of residency or fellowship training following graduation.  In addition, [[consultant pharmacist]]s, who traditionally operated primarily in [[nursing home]]s are now expanding into direct consultation with patients, under the banner of \"senior care pharmacy\".<ref>[[American Society of Consultant Pharmacists]], [http://www.ascp.com/consumers/what/ What is a Senior Care Pharmacist?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023213917/http://www.ascp.com/consumers/what/ |date=23 October 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to patient care, pharmacies will be a focal point for medical adherence initiatives. There is enough evidence to show that integrated pharmacy based initiatives significantly impact adherence for chronic patients. For example, a study published in NIH shows \"pharmacy based interventions improved patients' medication adherence rates by 2.1 percent and increased physicians' initiation rates by 38 percent, compared to the control group\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brennan|first=Troyen A.|last2=Dollear|first2=Timothy J.|last3=Hu|first3=Min|last4=Matlin|first4=Olga S.|last5=Shrank|first5=William H.|last6=Choudhry|first6=Niteesh K.|last7=Grambley|first7=William|date=1 January 2012|title=An integrated pharmacy-based program improved medication prescription and adherence rates in diabetes patients|journal=Health Affairs (Project Hope)|volume=31|issue=1|pages=120\u2013129|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2011.0931|issn=1544-5208|pmid=22232102}}</ref>\n\n==Pharmacy journals==\n* [[List of Pharmacy Journals]]\n\n==Symbols==\nThe [[symbol]]s most commonly associated with pharmacy are the [[mortar and pestle]] (North America) and the \u211e ([[Medical prescription]]) character, which is often written as \"Rx\" in typed text; the green [[Greek cross]] in [[France]], [[Argentina]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Belgium]], [[Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], and [[India]]; the [[Bowl of Hygieia]] (only) often used in the [[Netherlands]] but may be seen combined with other symbols elsewhere.

The introduction of the Mustang created a new class of automobile known as the [[pony car]].  The Mustang\u2019s styling, with its long hood and short deck, proved wildly popular and inspired a host of competition.\n\nIt was initially introduced on April 17, 1964, as a hardtop and convertible with the fastback version put on sale in August 1964.  At the time of its introduction, the Mustang, sharing its underpinnings with the [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Falcon]], was slotted into a [[compact car]] segment.\n\nWith each revision, the Mustang saw an increase in overall dimensions and in engine power. The 1971 model saw a drastic redesign to its predecessors.  After an initial surge, sales were steadily declining, as Ford began working on a new generation Mustang. With the onset of the [[1973 oil crisis]], Ford was prepared, having already designed the smaller [[Ford Mustang II|Mustang II]] for the 1974 [[model year]]. This new car had no common components with preceding models.\n\n== Conception and styling ==\nAs [[Lee Iacocca]]'s assistant general manager and chief engineer, [[Donald N. Frey]] was the head engineer for the Mustang project &mdash; supervising the development of the Mustang in a record 18 months from September 1962 to March 1964.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.thetech.org/nmot/detail.cfm?ID=8& |title=Donald N.

We talked about the sporty car for most of that afternoon, setting parameters for what it should look like \u2014 and what it should not look like \u2014 by making lists on a large pad, a technique I adapted from the management seminar. We taped the lists up all around the studio to keep ourselves on track. We also had photographs of all the previous sporty cars that had been done in the Corporate Advanced studio as a guide to themes or ideas that were tired or not acceptable to management.\n\nWithin a week we had hammered out a new design. We cut templates and fitted them to the clay model that had been started. We cut right into it, adding or deleting clay to accommodate our new theme, so it wasn't like starting all over. But we knew Lincoln-Mercury would have two models.  And Advanced would have five, some they had previously shown and modified, plus a couple extras. But we would only have one model because Ford studio had a production schedule for a good many facelifts and other projects. We couldn't afford the manpower, but we made up for lost time by working around the clock so our model would be ready for the management review.<ref name=\"midco\" />}}\n\nIn a 2004 interview, Oros recalls the planning behind the design:<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A18082-2004Apr16_2.html?sections=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/business |title=Mustang Fans Gather to Mark Anniversary |newspaper=The Washington Post |date= April 16, 2004 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate= February 13, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{cquote|I told the team that I wanted the car to appeal to women, but I wanted men to desire it, too.

I said it should be as sporty as possible and look like it was related to European design.}}\n\n===David Ash===\n\n[[L. David Ash]] is often credited with the actual styling of the Mustang.  Ash, in a 1985 interview speaking of the origin of the Mustang design, when asked the degree of his contribution, said:\n{{cquote | I would say substantial. However, anyone that says they designed the car by themselves, is wrong. Iacocca didn't design it. He conceived it. He's called the father of it, and, in that respect, he was. I did not design it in total, nor did Oros. It was designed by a design group. You look at the photograph taken at the award banquet for the Industrial Designers\u2019 Society where the Mustang received the medal; it\u2019s got Damon Woods in it (the group that did the interior), and Charlie Phaneuf (who was with Damon), and it\u2019s got myself and John Foster (who was with me), it\u2019s got (John) Najjar in it.<ref name=\"umich\">{{cite web|author=DRC |title=Automotive Design Oral History Project -\u2014 The Reminiscences of L.

[[Lee Iacocca |Iacocca]] in his book flat out comes and says I did the car. It's right there in print, \"It's Dave Ash's Mustang.\" Bordinat will tell you I did the car. This book tells you I did the car, but, in actual fact, I had a lot of help, and I don't think anyone ever does a car by himself, not in these times anyway.<ref name=\"umich\"/>}}\n\n===Gale Halderman===\n\nGale Halderman, in a 2002 interview with Collectible Automobile, spoke of the Mustang's evolution through the Ford design studio:\n\n{{cquote | [[L. David Ash|Dave Ash]] had started a clay model of the car. He had this very boxy, very stiff-looking car. Joe came back from a management conference, saw it, and said, \"No, no, no, we're not going to do that!\"  That's when he came to me\u2026 he said, \"\u2026we've just been given an assignment by [Gene] Bordinat to do a proposal on a small car that Lee [Iaccoca] wants to build. We've got to do one, and I want you to work on that project.\" I went home and sketched some cars, and I took about five or six sketches with me the next morning and put them up on the board. }}\n\n{{cquote|We must have put 25 sketches on the board that morning, because Joe assigned three or four of us to do designs. Joe picked one of the sketches I did at home to be clay modeled\u2026 so we actually started over on [Dave Ash's] clay model with the theme from one of my designs, which had scoops on the sides and the hop-up quarter lines.<ref>{{cite web |title= Gale Halderman: Mustangs, Marks, and More, Part I |publisher= Collectible Automobile |first=Jim |last= Farell |url= http://www.lincolnmarkv.com/LincolnMarkV/The_Stylists/Pages/Gale_Haldeman_Part_1.html#0 |accessdate=10 August 2014}}</ref>}}\n\nTo decrease developmental costs, the Mustang used [[chassis]], [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], and drivetrain components derived from the [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Ford Falcon]] and [[Ford Fairlane (North America)|Fairlane]]. It used a unitized platform-type frame from the 1964 Falcon, and welded box-section side rails, including welded crossmembers.  Although hardtop Mustangs accounted for the highest sales, durability problems with the new frame led to the engineering of a convertible first, which ensured adequate stiffness. Overall length of the Mustang and Falcon was identical, although the Mustang's [[wheelbase]] was slightly shorter.  With an overall width of {{convert|68.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, it was {{convert|2.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} narrower, yet the wheel track was nearly identical. Shipping weight, approximately {{convert |2570|lb|kg|0|abbr= on}} with the straight [[Straight-six engine|six-cylinder]] engine, was also similar to the Falcon. A fully equipped [[V8 engine|V8]] model weighed approximately {{convert|3000|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}. Although most of the mechanical parts were from the Falcon, the Mustang's body was completely different; sporting a shorter wheelbase, wider track, lower seating position and lower overall height. An industry first, the \"torque box\" was an innovative structural system that greatly stiffened the Mustang's construction and helped contribute to better handling.\n\nGale Haldeman spoke of the engineering and design of the car in his interview, stating:\n\n{{cquote |No one knew the Mustang was going to be as popular as it was, but it created a huge stir in the company. Everybody just loved it, even the engineers, though we must have bent 75 in-house engineering and manufacturing rules. The Mustang had the first floating bumpers. The whole front end was a die-casting with a floating hood.}}\n\n{{cquote|There were so many things the engineers said we shouldn't be doing, but they didn't want to change them either. There was so much enthusiasm right from the beginning.  Even the drivers at the test track loved it. We would go there for meetings, and the crowds of people around it were huge. That was totally unusual, so we suspected the Mustang was going to be a hit.}}\n\nThe idea for a fastback originated with Joe Oros as well, and was designed in Charlie Phaneuf's studio.<ref name=\"howstuffworks1\">{{cite web |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/gale-halderman1.htm |title=Gale Halderman: Creating the 1965 Ford Mustang Prototype |publisher= How stuff works |date=February 7, 2007 |accessdate= February 13, 2016}}</ref> Haldeman recalls:<ref name=\"howstuffworks1\" />\n\n{{cquote |We did it in secret.

V8 models got a badge on the front fender that spelled out the engine's cubic inch displacement (\"260\" or \"289\") over a wide \"V.\"  This emblem was identical to the one on the 1964 [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Fairlane]].\n\nSeveral changes to the Mustang occurred at the start of the \"normal\" 1965 model year in August 1964, about four months after its introduction. These cars are known as \"late 65's\". The engine lineup was changed, with a {{convert|200|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} \"T-code\" engine that produced {{convert|120|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. Production of the Fairlane's \"F-code\" {{convert|260|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engine ceased when the 1964 model year ended.

An \"A-code\" {{convert|225|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} four-barrel carbureted version was next in line, followed by the unchanged [[Ford Windsor engine#289 HiPo (K-code)|289 HiPo \"K-code\"]] equipped with a 4-barrel [[Autolite]] 4100 carburetor rated at {{convert|271|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 6000 rpm and {{convert|312|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3400 rpm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecarsource.com/fords/engines/289engine.shtml|website=thecarsource.com|title=289 engines|accessdate=July 12, 2018}}</ref> The DC [[electrical generator]] was replaced by a new AC [[alternator (automotive)|alternator]] on all Fords (a way to distinguish a 1964 from a 1965 is to see if the alternator light on the dash says \"GEN\" or \"ALT\"). \n\n=== GT Equipment Group ===\nThe Mustang GT version was introduced as the \"GT Equipment Package\" and included a [[V8 engine]] (most often the {{convert|225|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on|disp=comma}} \"289\"), grille-mounted fog lamps, rocker panel stripes, and disc brakes. In the interior the GT option added a different instrument panel that included a speedometer, fuel gauge, temp. gauge, oil pressure gauge and ammeter in five round dials (the gauges were not marked with numbers, however.)<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford_%20Mustang/1965_Ford_Mustang/1965%20Ford%20Mustang%20Brochure/1965%20Ford%20Mustang-14-15.html |title=1965 Ford Mustang Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |pages=14\u201315 |accessdate=April 26, 2012}}</ref> A four-barrel carbureted engine was now available with any body style. Additionally, reverse lights were an option added to the car from August 1964 production. The Mustang was originally available as either a hardtop or convertible, but during the car's early design phases a fastback model was strongly considered. For 1965, the [[Shelby Mustang]] was born, it was available only in newly introduced [[fastback]] body version with its swept-back rear glass and distinctive ventilation louvers.<ref name=\"schnack1965\">{{cite web|url =http://www.shnack.com/history/1965 |title=Ford Mustang History - 1965 |publisher=Shnack.com |date= |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}</ref> In 1965 they built 15,079 Mustangs that featured the GT Equipment Group.<ref name=\"Car Memories 1965\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.carmemories.com/cgi-bin/viewexperience.cgi?experience_id=374 |title=1965 Mustang Production Numbers |work=Car Memories |access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref> For 1966, they built 25,517 GTs.<ref name=\"Car Memories 1966\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.carmemories.com/cgi-bin/viewexperience.cgi?experience_id=373 |title=1966 Mustang Production Numbers |work=Car Memories |access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref> According to Jim Smart production guide, the fastback would have been the most common, followed by the coupe and then convertible.\n\n=== Options ===\nThe standard interior features of the 1965 Mustang included adjustable driver and passenger bucket seats, an AM radio, and a floor mounted shifter in a variety of color options. Ford added additional interior options during the 1965 model year. The Interior Decor Group was popularly known as \"Pony Interior\" due to the addition of embossed running ponies on the seat fronts, and also included integral armrests, woodgrain appliqu\u00e9 accents, and a round gauge cluster that would replace the standard [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Falcon]] instrumentation. Also available were sun visors, a (mechanical) remote-operated mirror, a floor console, and a bench seat. Ford later offered an under-dash air-conditioning unit, and discontinued the vinyl with cloth insert seat option, offered only in early 1965 models. One option designed strictly for fun was the [[Rally-Pac]].  Introduced in 1963 after Ford's success at that year's [[Monte Carlo Rally]] and available on other Ford and Mercury compacts and intermediates, the Rally-Pac was a combination clock and tachometer<ref name=\"oldcarbrochures1965\">{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford_%20Mustang/1965_Ford_Mustang/1965%20Ford%20Mustang%20Brochure/1965%20Ford%20Mustang-12-13.html |title=1965 Ford Mustang Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |pages=12\u201313 |accessdate=April 26, 2012}}</ref> mounted to the steering column.

Ford's new C4 \"Cruise-O-Matic\" three-speed automatic transmission became available for the 225&nbsp;hp V8. The 289 \"HiPo\" K-code engine was also offered with a C4 transmission, but it had stronger internals and can be identified by the outer casing of the servo which is marked with a 'C'. The long duration solid-lifter camshaft that allowed the high revving 289 to make the horsepower it was known for, was not friendly for a low stall speed automatic torque converter. The \"HiPo\" could be spotted very easily by the {{convert|1|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick}} vibration damper, (as compared to 1/2&nbsp;inch on the 225-hp version)  and the absence of a vacuum advance unit on the dual point distributor. With the valve covers off, there is a large letter \"K\" stamped between the valve springs, along with screw in studs (vs. a pressed in stud for other 289s) for the adjustable rocker arms. A large number of new paint and interior color options, an [[amplitude modulation|AM]]/[[Stereo 8|eight-track]] sound system, and one of the first AM/[[FM broadcasting|FM]] [[monaural|mono]] automobile radios were also offered. It also removed the Falcon instrument cluster; the previously optional features, including the round gauges and padded sun visors, became standard equipment. The Mustang would be the best-selling convertible in 1966, with 72,119 sold, beating the number two [[Chevrolet Impala|Impala]] by almost 2:1.<ref>{{cite book|last=Flory, Jr. |first=J. \"Kelly\" |title=American Cars, 1960\u20131972: Every Model, Year by Year |publisher=McFarland |year=2004 |page=412 |isbn=978-0-7864-1273-0 }}</ref>\n\nThe 1965 and 1966 Mustangs are differentiated by variations in the exterior, despite similar design. These variations include the emblem on the quarter-panels behind the doors. From August 1964 production, the emblem was a single vertical piece of chrome, while for 1966 models the emblem was smaller in height and had three horizontal bars extending from the design, resembling an \"E\". The front intake grilles and ornaments were also different. The 1965 front grille used a \"honeycomb\" pattern, while the 1966 version was a \"slotted\" style.  While both model years used the \"Horse and Corral\" emblem on the grille, the 1965 had four bars extending from each side of the corral, while on the 1966, these bars were removed. The 1966 model year saw introduction of 'High Country Special' limited edition, 333 of them were sold in Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.shnack.com/history/1966 |title=Ford Mustang History - 1966 |publisher=Shnack.com |date= |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}</ref>\n\nWhen Ford wanted to introduce the Mustang in [[Germany]], they discovered that [[Krupp]] company had already registered the name for a truck.<ref name=\"t-5\">{{cite web|url= http://www.fordt5.com/history.html |first=Gary J. |last=Hanson|title=History of the Ford T5 |publisher=Fordt5.com |date= |accessdate=December 10, 2012}}</ref> The German company offered to sell the rights for US$10,000.

The hardtop also included upholstered quarter trim panels, a carryover from the 1965\u20131966 deluxe interior. The 1967 hardtop also had the chrome quarter trim caps, carried over from 1965\u20131966, but these were painted to match the interior in 1968 models. The 1967 deluxe interior included stainless steel-trimmed seat back shells, similar to those in the Thunderbird. These were dropped at the end of the 1967 model year, and were not included in the woodgrain-trimmed 1968 interior. The deluxe steering wheel, which had been included in the deluxe interior for the 1965\u20131966, became optional, and could also be ordered with the standard interior. The 1968 models that were produced from January 1968 were also the first model year to incorporate three-point lap and shoulder belts (which had previously been optional, in 1967\u20131968 models) as opposed to the standard lap belts. The air-conditioning option was fully integrated into the dash, the speakers and stereo were upgraded, and unique center and overhead consoles were options. The fastback model offered the option of a rear fold-down seat, and the convertible was available with folding glass windows. Gone was the Rally-Pac, since the new instrument cluster had provisions for an optional tachometer and clock.

Mustang E lettering on the rear quarters identified the special Mustang E.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mustangattitude.com/mustang/1969specialmod.shtml |title=1969 Ford Mustang Special Models |publisher=Mustangattitude.com |date= |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref>  Air conditioning was not available on the 'E' model.<ref name=\"mustangspecs.com\"/>\n\nThe Mustang GT was discontinued in 1969 due to poor sales versus the success of the new [[Ford Mustang Mach 1|Mach 1]] with only 5396 GT models sold that year.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://home.comcast.net/~gt69registry/ |title=Welcome to the 1969 Mustang GT Registry Page |publisher=Home.comcast.net |date= |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref>\n\nA new [[Ford Straight-6 engine#250|{{convert|250|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} Thriftpower]] I6 engine with {{convert|155|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} filled the gap between the existing [[Ford Straight-6 engine#200|{{convert|200|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} Thriftpower]] I6 and the V8 engine line-up.\n\nAlthough 1969 continued with many of the same basic V8 engines available on 1968 models, notably a now revised [[Ford 302 Engine|302 cu in (4.9 L) Windsor]] engine with {{convert|220|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, the [[Ford FE engine#390|390 cu in (6.4 L) FE]] with {{convert|320|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and the recently launched [[Ford FE engine#428|428 cu in (7.0 L) Cobra Jet]] engine (with or without Ram-Air) with an advertised {{convert|335|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, a variety of revised options and changes were introduced to keep the Mustang fresh and competitive including a new performance V8 available in {{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} or {{convert|290|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} tune known as the [[351 Windsor|351 cu in (5.8 L) Windsor (351W)]], which was effectively a stretched and revised {{convert|302|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} to achieve the extra stroke.\n\nThe [[Ford FE engine#428|428 cu in (7.0 L) Cobra Jet]] engine continued unchanged in the 1969 and 1970 model years and continued to be advertised at just {{convert|335|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} despite being closer to {{convert|410|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.  However, whenever a V or W axle was ordered (3.90 or 4.30 locking ratio) on any Cobra Jet Mustang, this kicked in various engine improvements which were designed to make the engine more reliable on the strip. These improvements included an engine oil cooler (which resulted in AC not remaining an option), stronger crankshaft and conrods and improved engine balancing and was named the '[[Ford FE engine#428|Super Cobra Jet]]'. On the order form, these improvements were later referred to as '[[Drag Pack]]'. Today, these models request a premium price despite offering no notable performance increase other than provided by their unique axle ratios.\n\nThe 1969 [[Shelby Mustang]] was now under Ford's control and made to look vastly different from regular production Mustangs, despite now being built inhouse by Ford.<ref name=\"69-70shelby\">{{cite web|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide''|url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1969-1970-ford-mustang6.htm |title=1969 and 1970 Shelby Mustang |publisher=Auto.howstuffworks.com |date=February 7, 2007|accessdate=May 15, 2012 }}</ref> The custom styling included a fiberglass front end with a combination loop bumper/grille that increased the car's overall length by {{convert|3|in|mm|0}}, as well as five air intakes on the hood.<ref name=\"69-70shelby\"/> Two models were available, GT-350 (with a [[351 Windsor|351 cu in (5.8 L) Windsor (351W)]] producing {{convert|290|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}) and GT-500 (with the [[Ford FE engine#428|428 cu in (7.0 L) Cobra Jet]] engine), in both sportsroof or convertible versions.

Some felt the aggressive styling of the 1969 model hurt its sales and this view prompted the headlamp revisions and simplification of other exterior styling aspects.  It's worth noting though that 1969 model year sales exceeded those of 1970.<ref name=\"carmemories.com\"/>  The rear fender air scoops were removed and the taillight panel was now flat instead of concave as seen on 1969 models.

Though some early 1970 mustangs, built in 1969, had the 351W. The [[Ford 335 engine#351 Cleveland|351C 4V (M code)]] engine featured 11.0:1 compression and produced 300&nbsp;bhp (224&nbsp;kW; 304 PS) at 5400 rpm.  This new performance engine incorporated elements learned from the [[Ford 385 engine|Ford 385 series engine]] and the [[Boss 302 Mustang|Boss 302]], particularly the poly-angle combustion chambers with canted valves and the thin-wall casting technology.\n\nFord made 96 'Mustang Twister Special' cars for Kansas Ford dealers in late 1969. The Twister Specials were Grabber Orange Mach 1s with special decals. Ford also made a few 'Sidewinders', which were built in Dearborn, shipped to Omaha, and sold in Iowa and Nebraska. They were available in Grabber Green, Grabber Blue, Calypso Coral, and Yellow.

At mid-year, Ford offered a slightly detuned Boss 351 engine, which could be ordered with any model.  Only 398 Mustangs were built with the drag race oriented R code motor and was designated as the 351 HO.  Mandatory options were the top loader 4 speed, competition N case rear end (427, 428, 429, Boss 351, 351HO), and air conditioning delete.  Vacuum operated Ram Air was not available, however the HO came with the first full time cold air induction system in a Mustang, routing cold air via a 2 piece plastic duct under the battery tray to the air cleaner snorkel.  All 351 HO cars were manufactured in Dearborn, MI.\n\n=== 1973 ===\n1973 brought some mild restyling. The urethane front bumper became standard, and was enlarged in accordance with new NHTSA standards. All Mustang models had their sportlamps replaced with vertical turn signals, as the new bumper covered the previous turn signal locations in the front valance. Both a Mach 1 and base grille were offered, with differing insert patterns.\n\nMach 1 decals were also revised in 1972 for 1973 models, and the previous hockey stick side stripes of 1971\u20131972 models became an option on hardtops and convertibles with the addition of the 'Exterior Decor Group'.

Mustang}}\n\nThe '''first-generation Ford Mustang''' was manufactured by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] from March 1964 until 1973.  The introduction of the Mustang created a new class of automobile known as the [[pony car]].  The Mustang\u2019s styling, with its long hood and short deck, proved wildly popular and inspired a host of competition.\n\nIt was initially introduced on April 17, 1964, as a hardtop and convertible with the fastback version put on sale in August 1964.  At the time of its introduction, the Mustang, sharing its underpinnings with the [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Falcon]], was slotted into a [[compact car]] segment.\n\nWith each revision, the Mustang saw an increase in overall dimensions and in engine power. The 1971 model saw a drastic redesign to its predecessors.  After an initial surge, sales were steadily declining, as Ford began working on a new generation Mustang. With the onset of the [[1973 oil crisis]], Ford was prepared, having already designed the smaller [[Ford Mustang II|Mustang II]] for the 1974 [[model year]]. This new car had no common components with preceding models.\n\n== Conception and styling ==\nAs [[Lee Iacocca]]'s assistant general manager and chief engineer, [[Donald N.

We talked about the sporty car for most of that afternoon, setting parameters for what it should look like \u2014 and what it should not look like \u2014 by making lists on a large pad, a technique I adapted from the management seminar. We taped the lists up all around the studio to keep ourselves on track. We also had photographs of all the previous sporty cars that had been done in the Corporate Advanced studio as a guide to themes or ideas that were tired or not acceptable to management.\n\nWithin a week we had hammered out a new design. We cut templates and fitted them to the clay model that had been started. We cut right into it, adding or deleting clay to accommodate our new theme, so it wasn't like starting all over. But we knew Lincoln-Mercury would have two models.  And Advanced would have five, some they had previously shown and modified, plus a couple extras. But we would only have one model because Ford studio had a production schedule for a good many facelifts and other projects. We couldn't afford the manpower, but we made up for lost time by working around the clock so our model would be ready for the management review.<ref name=\"midco\" />}}\n\nIn a 2004 interview, Oros recalls the planning behind the design:<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A18082-2004Apr16_2.html?sections=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/business |title=Mustang Fans Gather to Mark Anniversary |newspaper=The Washington Post |date= April 16, 2004 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate= February 13, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{cquote|I told the team that I wanted the car to appeal to women, but I wanted men to desire it, too.

Ash, in a 1985 interview speaking of the origin of the Mustang design, when asked the degree of his contribution, said:\n{{cquote | I would say substantial. However, anyone that says they designed the car by themselves, is wrong. Iacocca didn't design it. He conceived it. He's called the father of it, and, in that respect, he was. I did not design it in total, nor did Oros. It was designed by a design group. You look at the photograph taken at the award banquet for the Industrial Designers\u2019 Society where the Mustang received the medal; it\u2019s got Damon Woods in it (the group that did the interior), and Charlie Phaneuf (who was with Damon), and it\u2019s got myself and John Foster (who was with me), it\u2019s got (John) Najjar in it.<ref name=\"umich\">{{cite web|author=DRC |title=Automotive Design Oral History Project -\u2014 The Reminiscences of L.

David Ash|Dave Ash]] had started a clay model of the car. He had this very boxy, very stiff-looking car. Joe came back from a management conference, saw it, and said, \"No, no, no, we're not going to do that!\"  That's when he came to me\u2026 he said, \"\u2026we've just been given an assignment by [Gene] Bordinat to do a proposal on a small car that Lee [Iaccoca] wants to build. We've got to do one, and I want you to work on that project.\" I went home and sketched some cars, and I took about five or six sketches with me the next morning and put them up on the board. }}\n\n{{cquote|We must have put 25 sketches on the board that morning, because Joe assigned three or four of us to do designs.

It used a unitized platform-type frame from the 1964 Falcon, and welded box-section side rails, including welded crossmembers.  Although hardtop Mustangs accounted for the highest sales, durability problems with the new frame led to the engineering of a convertible first, which ensured adequate stiffness. Overall length of the Mustang and Falcon was identical, although the Mustang's [[wheelbase]] was slightly shorter.  With an overall width of {{convert|68.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, it was {{convert|2.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} narrower, yet the wheel track was nearly identical. Shipping weight, approximately {{convert |2570|lb|kg|0|abbr= on}} with the straight [[Straight-six engine|six-cylinder]] engine, was also similar to the Falcon. A fully equipped [[V8 engine|V8]] model weighed approximately {{convert|3000|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}. Although most of the mechanical parts were from the Falcon, the Mustang's body was completely different; sporting a shorter wheelbase, wider track, lower seating position and lower overall height. An industry first, the \"torque box\" was an innovative structural system that greatly stiffened the Mustang's construction and helped contribute to better handling.\n\nGale Haldeman spoke of the engineering and design of the car in his interview, stating:\n\n{{cquote |No one knew the Mustang was going to be as popular as it was, but it created a huge stir in the company. Everybody just loved it, even the engineers, though we must have bent 75 in-house engineering and manufacturing rules. The Mustang had the first floating bumpers. The whole front end was a die-casting with a floating hood.}}\n\n{{cquote|There were so many things the engineers said we shouldn't be doing, but they didn't want to change them either. There was so much enthusiasm right from the beginning.  Even the drivers at the test track loved it. We would go there for meetings, and the crowds of people around it were huge. That was totally unusual, so we suspected the Mustang was going to be a hit.}}\n\nThe idea for a fastback originated with Joe Oros as well, and was designed in Charlie Phaneuf's studio.<ref name=\"howstuffworks1\">{{cite web |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/gale-halderman1.htm |title=Gale Halderman: Creating the 1965 Ford Mustang Prototype |publisher= How stuff works |date=February 7, 2007 |accessdate= February 13, 2016}}</ref> Haldeman recalls:<ref name=\"howstuffworks1\" />\n\n{{cquote |We did it in secret.

V8 models got a badge on the front fender that spelled out the engine's cubic inch displacement (\"260\" or \"289\") over a wide \"V.\"  This emblem was identical to the one on the 1964 [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Fairlane]].\n\nSeveral changes to the Mustang occurred at the start of the \"normal\" 1965 model year in August 1964, about four months after its introduction. These cars are known as \"late 65's\". The engine lineup was changed, with a {{convert|200|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} \"T-code\" engine that produced {{convert|120|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.

Ford added additional interior options during the 1965 model year. The Interior Decor Group was popularly known as \"Pony Interior\" due to the addition of embossed running ponies on the seat fronts, and also included integral armrests, woodgrain appliqu\u00e9 accents, and a round gauge cluster that would replace the standard [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Falcon]] instrumentation. Also available were sun visors, a (mechanical) remote-operated mirror, a floor console, and a bench seat.

Ford's new C4 \"Cruise-O-Matic\" three-speed automatic transmission became available for the 225&nbsp;hp V8. The 289 \"HiPo\" K-code engine was also offered with a C4 transmission, but it had stronger internals and can be identified by the outer casing of the servo which is marked with a 'C'. The long duration solid-lifter camshaft that allowed the high revving 289 to make the horsepower it was known for, was not friendly for a low stall speed automatic torque converter. The \"HiPo\" could be spotted very easily by the {{convert|1|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick}} vibration damper, (as compared to 1/2&nbsp;inch on the 225-hp version)  and the absence of a vacuum advance unit on the dual point distributor. With the valve covers off, there is a large letter \"K\" stamped between the valve springs, along with screw in studs (vs. a pressed in stud for other 289s) for the adjustable rocker arms. A large number of new paint and interior color options, an [[amplitude modulation|AM]]/[[Stereo 8|eight-track]] sound system, and one of the first AM/[[FM broadcasting|FM]] [[monaural|mono]] automobile radios were also offered. It also removed the Falcon instrument cluster; the previously optional features, including the round gauges and padded sun visors, became standard equipment. The Mustang would be the best-selling convertible in 1966, with 72,119 sold, beating the number two [[Chevrolet Impala|Impala]] by almost 2:1.<ref>{{cite book|last=Flory, Jr. |first=J. \"Kelly\" |title=American Cars, 1960\u20131972: Every Model, Year by Year |publisher=McFarland |year=2004 |page=412 |isbn=978-0-7864-1273-0 }}</ref>\n\nThe 1965 and 1966 Mustangs are differentiated by variations in the exterior, despite similar design.

From August 1964 production, the emblem was a single vertical piece of chrome, while for 1966 models the emblem was smaller in height and had three horizontal bars extending from the design, resembling an \"E\". The front intake grilles and ornaments were also different. The 1965 front grille used a \"honeycomb\" pattern, while the 1966 version was a \"slotted\" style.  While both model years used the \"Horse and Corral\" emblem on the grille, the 1965 had four bars extending from each side of the corral, while on the 1966, these bars were removed.

The hardtop also included upholstered quarter trim panels, a carryover from the 1965\u20131966 deluxe interior. The 1967 hardtop also had the chrome quarter trim caps, carried over from 1965\u20131966, but these were painted to match the interior in 1968 models. The 1967 deluxe interior included stainless steel-trimmed seat back shells, similar to those in the Thunderbird. These were dropped at the end of the 1967 model year, and were not included in the woodgrain-trimmed 1968 interior. The deluxe steering wheel, which had been included in the deluxe interior for the 1965\u20131966, became optional, and could also be ordered with the standard interior. The 1968 models that were produced from January 1968 were also the first model year to incorporate three-point lap and shoulder belts (which had previously been optional, in 1967\u20131968 models) as opposed to the standard lap belts. The air-conditioning option was fully integrated into the dash, the speakers and stereo were upgraded, and unique center and overhead consoles were options. The fastback model offered the option of a rear fold-down seat, and the convertible was available with folding glass windows. Gone was the Rally-Pac, since the new instrument cluster had provisions for an optional tachometer and clock. Its size and shape also precluded the installation of the accessory atop the steering column.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.1967-mustang.com/index.htm |title=1967 Mustang |publisher=1967 Mustang |date= |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}</ref> The convenience group with four warning lights for low fuel, seat belt reminder, parking brake not released, and door ajar were added to the instrument panel, or, if one ordered the optional console and A/C, the lights were mounted on the console.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford_%20Mustang/1968_Ford_Mustang/1968_Ford_Mustang_Brochure/1968%20Mustang-12-13.html |title=1968 Ford Mustang Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |pages=12\u201313 |accessdate=April 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\nChanges for the 1968 model increased safety with a two-spoke energy-absorbing steering wheel, along with newly introduced shoulder belts.

However, whenever a V or W axle was ordered (3.90 or 4.30 locking ratio) on any Cobra Jet Mustang, this kicked in various engine improvements which were designed to make the engine more reliable on the strip. These improvements included an engine oil cooler (which resulted in AC not remaining an option), stronger crankshaft and conrods and improved engine balancing and was named the '[[Ford FE engine#428|Super Cobra Jet]]'. On the order form, these improvements were later referred to as '[[Drag Pack]]'.

This new performance engine incorporated elements learned from the [[Ford 385 engine|Ford 385 series engine]] and the [[Boss 302 Mustang|Boss 302]], particularly the poly-angle combustion chambers with canted valves and the thin-wall casting technology.\n\nFord made 96 'Mustang Twister Special' cars for Kansas Ford dealers in late 1969. The Twister Specials were Grabber Orange Mach 1s with special decals. Ford also made a few 'Sidewinders', which were built in Dearborn, shipped to Omaha, and sold in Iowa and Nebraska.

At mid-year, Ford offered a slightly detuned Boss 351 engine, which could be ordered with any model.  Only 398 Mustangs were built with the drag race oriented R code motor and was designated as the 351 HO.  Mandatory options were the top loader 4 speed, competition N case rear end (427, 428, 429, Boss 351, 351HO), and air conditioning delete.  Vacuum operated Ram Air was not available, however the HO came with the first full time cold air induction system in a Mustang, routing cold air via a 2 piece plastic duct under the battery tray to the air cleaner snorkel.  All 351 HO cars were manufactured in Dearborn, MI.\n\n=== 1973 ===\n1973 brought some mild restyling. The urethane front bumper became standard, and was enlarged in accordance with new NHTSA standards. All Mustang models had their sportlamps replaced with vertical turn signals, as the new bumper covered the previous turn signal locations in the front valance.

J. Scott]] and starring [[Bolo Yeung]], [[Jalal Merhi]], [[Billy Blanks]], [[Bobbie Phillips]], [[Matthias Hues]], Harry Mok, and Kelly Gallant. The film was written by [[T.J. Scott]] from a story by J. Stephen Maunder and Richard M. Samuels and produced by Merhi. The soundtrack was composed by VaRouje.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 2020, ecological disaster has driven the wealthy to an underground city.  Jason Storm is part of an elite security force called the Tracker-Communicators who protect the city against the surface world survivors who could not afford to escape.  Zoey Kinsella, the deceased founder's daughter, joins him as his rookie partner.  After a raid by starving surface world survivors breaches the city's force field, Zoey comes to believe they have inside help.  Storm acknowledges the possibility but is more concerned with his clashes against the Controller, the leader of the city's security, and his enforcer, Bigalow.  The Controller wants to use a  cybernetic project to replace the Tracker-Communicators, but he can not find any volunteers\n\nNiki Picasso and his gang penetrate the underground city's force field and head directly to a disused area of the city.  There, in a hidden cache, they find ammunition and an automatic rifle, a weapon that has become extremely rare.  While Picasso pins down Storm and Kinsella, an unseen adversary shoots Kinsella dead.  Convinced of a coverup, Storm angrily resigns, only to have the Controller send Bigalow to kill him.  When Storm escapes the city, the Controller frames him for Kinsella's death and sets the security forces after him.  Unknown to Storm, the Controller has Kinsella resurrected as a cyborg and programs her to be his personal assassin.  Her first mission is to seduce Picasso and recruit him to take over a research facility guarded by the Lifers, a powerful gang.\n\nOn the surface world, Storm encounters a martial arts master, Sumai, and his daughter.  Sumai helps Storm infiltrate Picasso's lair, but the cybernetic Kinsella easily defeats Storm.  As Storm recovers, Sumai trains him.  Sumai, former head of security at the research facility, tells Storm that Kinsella's father was the person who founded it.  The facility was originally meant to counter the ecological damage but was converted into a chemical weapons factory.  Suspecting that the Controller seeks the biological weapons to take over the surface world, Storm and Sumai recruit fighters who are willing to stand up to Picasso.  As Picasso overpowers the Lifers with his rifle, the Controller murders the city's leader, the Overlord, and joins him.\n\nAfter launching the chemical weapons, the Controller double-crosses Picasso.  As the Controller flees the facility, Picasso confronts and kills him, though he left trapped in a silo.  The chemicals, though currently inert, will kill every surface dweller unless a countdown is aborted.  After defeating Bigalow and his men, Storm and Sumai break into the control room, where the Controller has left Kinsella.  Storm helps her to remember her true self, and she guesses several passwords.  Finally, with time running out, Sumai guesses the correct password and saves the surface world.  Picasso calls for help; when they ignore him, he vows revenge.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Billy Blanks]] as Jason Storm\n* [[Bobbie Phillips]] as Zoey Kinsella\n* [[Jalal Merhi]] as Niki Picasso\n* [[Bolo Yeung]] as Sumai\n* [[Matthias Hues]] as Bigalow\n* Harry Mok as Blade\n* Kelly Gallant as Zircon\n* Ramsay Smith as The Controller\n* Douglas J.
