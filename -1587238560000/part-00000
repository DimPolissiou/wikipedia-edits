His father, a soldier, died when Hoggart was a year old, and his mother died when he was eight. He grew up with his grandmother in [[Hunslet]], and was encouraged in his education by an aunt. He gained a place at [[Cockburn High School]] which was a [[grammar school]], after his headmaster requested that the education authority reread his scholarship examination essay. He then won a scholarship to study English at the [[University of Leeds]], where he graduated with a First Class Degree.<ref name=telegraph>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10760334/Richard-Hoggart-obituary.html Telegraph Richard Hoggart Obituary]. Retrieved 12 April 2014</ref> He served with the [[Royal Artillery]] during [[World War II]] and was demobilised as a Staff Captain.<ref name=\"guardian obit\"/>\n\n==Career==\nHe was a Staff Tutor at the [[University of Hull]] from 1946 to 1959, and published his first book, a study of [[W. H. Auden]]'s poetry, in 1951. His major work, ''[[The Uses of Literacy]]'', was published in 1957. Partly autobiography, the volume was interpreted as lamenting the loss of an authentic working class popular culture in Britain, and denouncing the imposition of a mass culture through advertising, media and Americanisation.\n\nHe became Senior Lecturer in English at the [[University of Leicester]] from 1959 to 1962. Hoggart was an expert witness at the [[R v Penguin Books Ltd.|Lady Chatterley trial]] in 1960, and his argument that it was an essentially moral and \"puritan\" work, which merely repeated words he had heard on a building site on his way to the court,<ref name=\"Hartley\">Hartley, J. (2009). The Uses of Digital Literacy. St. Lucia: University of Queensland Press. p. 2</ref> is sometimes viewed as having had a decisive influence on the outcome of the trial.\n\nWhile Professor of English at [[University of Birmingham|Birmingham University]] between 1962 and 1973, he founded the institution's [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies]] in 1964 and was its director until 1969. Hoggart was Assistant Director-General of [[UNESCO]] (1971\u20131975) and finally Warden of [[Goldsmiths, University of London]] (1976\u20131984), after which he retired from formal academic life. The 'Main Building' at Goldsmiths has now been renamed the 'Richard Hoggart Building' in tribute to his contributions to the college.\n\nHoggart was a member of numerous public bodies and committees, including the [[Albermarle Committee on Youth Services]] (1958\u20131960), the [[Pilkington Committee on Broadcasting]] (1960\u20131962), the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] (1976\u20131981) and the [[Statesman and Nation Publishing Company Ltd]] (1977\u20131981). He was also Chairman of the Advisory Council for Adult and [[Continuing Education]] (1977\u20131983), and the [[Broadcasting Research Unit]] (1981\u20131991), as well as a Governor of the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] (1962\u20131988).\n\nIn later works, such as ''The Way We Live Now'' (1995), he regretted the decline in [[moral authority]] that he held religion once provided. He also attacked contemporary education for its emphasis on the 'vocational', and '[[cultural relativism]]' for its tendency to concentrate on the popular and meretricious.\n\n==Personal life==\nOne of his two sons was the political journalist [[Simon Hoggart]], who predeceased him by three months, and the other is the television critic [[Paul Hoggart]]. He is also survived by a daughter, Nicola. In ''[[The Chatterley Affair]]'', a 2006 dramatisation of the 1960 trial made for the [[digital television]] channel [[BBC Four]], he was played by actor [[David Tennant]].\n\n==Death==\nIn later life he suffered from senile dementia.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jan/10/simon-hoggart-dad-working-socialising-laughing | work=The Guardian | title=Simon Hoggart, my dad, was working, socialising and laughing to the end | date=10 January 2014 | location=London | first=Amy | last=Hoggart|accessdate=11 January 2014}}</ref> He died on 10 April 2014 at the age of 95.<ref name=\"guardian obit\">{{cite web\n|title=Richard Hoggart obituary\n|work=The Guardian\n|date=10 April 2014\n|url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/10/richard-hoggart\n|accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n*''Auden'' (Chatto, 1951) {{ISBN|0-7011-0762-6}} biography of [[W.

Is any blame attached because somebody took Nietzsche's philosophy seriously and fashioned his life upon it? ... It is hardly fair to hang a 19-year-old boy for the philosophy that was taught him at the university.\n\nNow, your Honor, I have spoken about the war. I believed in it. I don't know whether I was crazy or not. Sometimes I think perhaps I was. I approved of it; I joined in the general cry of madness and despair. I urged men to fight. I was safe because I was too old to go. I was like the rest. What did they do? Right or wrong, justifiable or unjustifiable \u2013 which I need not discuss today \u2013 it changed the world. For four long years the civilized world was engaged in killing men. Christian against Christian, barbarian uniting with Christians to kill Christians; anything to kill. It was taught in every school, aye in the Sunday schools. The little children played at war. The toddling children on the street. Do you suppose this world has ever been the same since? How long, your Honor, will it take for the world to get back the humane emotions that were slowly growing before the war? How long will it take the calloused hearts of men before the scars of hatred and cruelty shall be removed?\n\nWe read of killing one hundred thousand men in a day. We read about it and we rejoiced in it\u2014if it was the other fellows who were killed. We were fed on flesh and drank blood. Even down to the prattling babe. I need not tell you how many upright, honorable young boys have come into this court charged with murder, some saved and some sent to their death, boys who fought in this war and learned to place a cheap value on human life. You know it and I know it. These boys were brought up in it. The tales of death were in their homes, their playgrounds, their schools; they were in the newspapers that they read; it was a part of the common frenzy \u2013 what was a life? It was nothing. It was the least sacred thing in existence and these boys were trained to this cruelty.\n\nIt will take fifty years to wipe it out of the human heart, if ever. I know this, that after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in 1865, crimes of this sort increased, marvelously. No one needs to tell me that crime has no cause. It has as definite a cause as any other disease, and I know that out of the hatred and bitterness of the Civil War crime increased as America had never seen before. I know that Europe is going through the same experience today; I know it has followed every war; and I know it has influenced these boys so that life was not the same to them as it would have been if the world had not made red with blood. I protest against the crimes and mistakes of society being visited upon them. All of us have a share in it. I have mine. I cannot tell and I shall never know how many words of mine might have given birth to cruelty in place of love and kindness and charity.\n\nYour Honor knows that in this very court crimes of violence have increased growing out of the war. Not necessarily by those who fought but by those that learned that blood was cheap, and human life was cheap, and if the State could take it lightly why not the boy? There are causes for this terrible crime. There are causes as I have said for everything that happens in the world. War is a part of it; education is a part of it; birth is a part of it; money is a part of it\u2014all these conspired to compass the destruction of these two poor boys.\n\nHas the court any right to consider anything but these two boys? The State says that your Honor has a right to consider the welfare of the community, as you have. If the welfare of the community would be benefited by taking these lives, well and good. I think it would work evil that no one could measure. Has your Honor a right to consider the families of these defendants? I have been sorry, and I am sorry for the bereavement of Mr. and Mrs. Franks, for those broken ties that cannot be healed. All I can hope and wish is that some good may come from it all. But as compared with the families of Leopold and Loeb, the Franks are to be envied\u2014and everyone knows it.\n\nI do not know how much salvage there is in these two boys. I hate to say it in their presence, but what is there to look forward to? I do not know but what your Honor would be merciful to them, but not merciful to civilization, and not merciful if you tied a rope around their necks and let them die; merciful to them, but not merciful to civilization, and not merciful to those who would be left behind. To spend the balance of their days in prison is mighty little to look forward to, if anything. Is it anything? They may have the hope that as the years roll around they might be released. I do not know. I do not know. I will be honest with this court as I have tried to be from the beginning. I know that these boys are not fit to be at large. I believe they will not be until they pass through the next stage of life, at forty-five or fifty. Whether they will then, I cannot tell. I am sure of this; that I will not be here to help them. So far as I am concerned, it is over.\n\nI would not tell this court that I do not hope that some time, when life and age have changed their bodies, as they do, and have changed their emotions, as they do\u2014that they may once more return to life. I would be the last person on earth to close the door of hope to any human being that lives, and least of all to my clients. But what have they to look forward to? Nothing. And I think here of the stanza of [[A. E. Housman|Housman]]:\n\n{{poemquote|\nNow hollow fires burn out to black, / And lights are fluttering low:\nSquare your shoulders, lift your pack / And leave your friends and go.\nO never fear, lads, naught's to dread, / Look not left nor right:\nIn all the endless road you tread / There's nothing but the night.}}\n\nI care not, your Honor, whether the march begins at the gallows or when the gates of Joliet close upon them, there is nothing but the night, and that is little for any human being to expect.\n\nBut there are others to consider. Here are these two families, who have led honest lives, who will bear the name that they bear, and future generations must carry it on.\n\nHere is Leopold's father \u2013 and this boy was the pride of his life. He watched him, he cared for him, he worked for him; the boy was brilliant and accomplished, he educated him, and he thought that fame and position awaited him, as it should have awaited. It is a hard thing for a father to see his life's hopes crumble into dust.\n\nShould he be considered? Should his brothers be considered? Will it do society any good or make your life safer, or any human being's life safer, if it should be handed down from generation to generation, that this boy, their kin, died upon the scaffold?\n\nAnd Loeb's the same. Here are the faithful uncle and brother, who have watched here day by day, while Dickie's father and his mother are too ill to stand this terrific strain, and shall be waiting for a message which means more to them than it can mean to you or me. Shall these be taken into account in this general bereavement?\n\nHave they any rights? Is there any reason, your Honor, why their proud names and all the future generations that bear them shall have this bar sinister written across them? How many boys and girls, how many unborn children will feel it? It is bad enough as it is, God knows. It is bad enough, however it is. But it's not yet death on the scaffold. It's not that. And I ask your Honor, in addition to all that I have said to save two honorable families from a disgrace that never ends, and which could be of no avail to help any human being that lives.\n\nNow, I must say a word more and then I will leave this with you where I should have left it long ago. None of us are unmindful of the public; courts are not, and juries are not. We placed our fate in the hands of a trained court, thinking that he would be more mindful and considerate than a jury. I cannot say how people feel. I have stood here for three months as one might stand at the ocean trying to sweep back the tide. I hope the seas are subsiding and the wind is falling, and I believe they are, but I wish to make no false pretense to this court. The easy thing and the popular thing to do is to hang my clients. I know it. Men and women who do not think will applaud. The cruel and thoughtless will approve. It will be easy today; but in Chicago, and reaching out over the length and breadth of the land, more and more fathers and mothers, the humane, the kind and the hopeful, who are gaining an understanding and asking questions not only about these poor boys, but about their own \u2013 these will join in no acclaim at the death of my clients.\n\nThese would ask that the shedding of blood be stopped, and that the normal feelings of man resume their sway. And as the days and the months and the years go on, they will ask it more and more. But, your Honor, what they shall ask may not count. I know the easy way. I know the future is with me, and what I stand for here; not merely for the lives of these two unfortunate lads, but for all boys and all girls; for all of the young, and as far as possible, for all of the old. I am pleading for life, understanding, charity, kindness, and the infinite mercy that considers all. I am pleading that we overcome cruelty with kindness and hatred with love. I know the future is on my side. Your Honor stands between the past and the future. You may hang these boys; you may hang them by the neck until they are dead. But in doing it you will turn your face toward the past. In doing it you are making it harder for every other boy who in ignorance and darkness must grope his way through the mazes which only childhood knows. In doing it you will make it harder for unborn children. You may save them and make it easier for every child that sometime may stand where these boys stand. You will make it easier for every human being with an aspiration and a vision and a hope and a fate. I am pleading for the future; I am pleading for a time when hatred and cruelty will not control the hearts of men. When we can learn by reason and judgment and understanding and faith that all life is worth saving, and that mercy is the highest attribute of man.\n\nI feel that I should apologize for the length of time I have taken. This case may not be as important as I think it is, and I am sure I do not need to tell this court, or to tell my friends that I would fight just as hard for the poor as for the rich. If I should succeed, my greatest reward and my greatest hope will be that for the countless unfortunates who must tread the same road in blind childhood that these poor boys have trod\u2014that I have done something to help human understanding, to temper justice with mercy, to overcome hate with love.\n\nI was reading last night of the aspiration of the old Persian poet, [[Omar Khayyam]]. It appealed to me as the highest that I can vision.

These included reorganizing the prison library, revamping the schooling system and teaching its students, and volunteer work in the prison hospital. In 1944, Leopold volunteered for the [[Stateville Penitentiary Malaria Study]]; he was deliberately inoculated with [[malaria]] pathogens and then subjected to multiple experimental malaria treatments.<ref>Higdon, H.

Leopold responded that he did not wish his story told in fictionalized form, but offered Levin a chance to contribute to his own memoir, which was in progress. Levin, unhappy with that suggestion, went ahead with his book alone, despite Leopold's express objections. \n\nThe novel, titled ''Compulsion'',<ref>Levin, M. ''Compulsion''(1956). New York, Simon & Schuster. {{ISBN|0786703199}}</ref> was published in 1956. Levin portrayed Leopold (under the pseudonym Judd Steiner) as a brilliant but deeply disturbed teenager, psychologically driven to kill because of his troubled childhood and an obsession with Loeb. Leopold later wrote that reading Levin's book made him \"physically sick ... More than once I had to lay the book down and wait for the nausea to subside.

They spent seven months planning everything from the method of abduction to disposal of the body. To obfuscate the precise nature of their crime and their motive, they decided to make a ransom demand, and devised an intricate plan for collecting it, involving a long series of complex delivery instructions to be communicated, one set at a time, by phone. They typed the final set of instructions involving the actual money drop in the form of a ransom note, using the typewriter stolen from the fraternity house.

I know this, that after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in 1865, crimes of this sort increased, marvelously. No one needs to tell me that crime has no cause. It has as definite a cause as any other disease, and I know that out of the hatred and bitterness of the Civil War crime increased as America had never seen before. I know that Europe is going through the same experience today; I know it has followed every war; and I know it has influenced these boys so that life was not the same to them as it would have been if the world had not made red with blood. I protest against the crimes and mistakes of society being visited upon them. All of us have a share in it. I have mine. I cannot tell and I shall never know how many words of mine might have given birth to cruelty in place of love and kindness and charity.\n\nYour Honor knows that in this very court crimes of violence have increased growing out of the war. Not necessarily by those who fought but by those that learned that blood was cheap, and human life was cheap, and if the State could take it lightly why not the boy? There are causes for this terrible crime. There are causes as I have said for everything that happens in the world. War is a part of it; education is a part of it; birth is a part of it; money is a part of it\u2014all these conspired to compass the destruction of these two poor boys.\n\nHas the court any right to consider anything but these two boys? The State says that your Honor has a right to consider the welfare of the community, as you have. If the welfare of the community would be benefited by taking these lives, well and good. I think it would work evil that no one could measure. Has your Honor a right to consider the families of these defendants? I have been sorry, and I am sorry for the bereavement of Mr. and Mrs. Franks, for those broken ties that cannot be healed. All I can hope and wish is that some good may come from it all. But as compared with the families of Leopold and Loeb, the Franks are to be envied\u2014and everyone knows it.\n\nI do not know how much salvage there is in these two boys. I hate to say it in their presence, but what is there to look forward to? I do not know but what your Honor would be merciful to them, but not merciful to civilization, and not merciful if you tied a rope around their necks and let them die; merciful to them, but not merciful to civilization, and not merciful to those who would be left behind. To spend the balance of their days in prison is mighty little to look forward to, if anything. Is it anything? They may have the hope that as the years roll around they might be released. I do not know. I do not know. I will be honest with this court as I have tried to be from the beginning. I know that these boys are not fit to be at large. I believe they will not be until they pass through the next stage of life, at forty-five or fifty. Whether they will then, I cannot tell. I am sure of this; that I will not be here to help them. So far as I am concerned, it is over.\n\nI would not tell this court that I do not hope that some time, when life and age have changed their bodies, as they do, and have changed their emotions, as they do\u2014that they may once more return to life. I would be the last person on earth to close the door of hope to any human being that lives, and least of all to my clients. But what have they to look forward to? Nothing. And I think here of the stanza of [[A. E. Housman|Housman]]:\n\n{{poemquote|\nNow hollow fires burn out to black, / And lights are fluttering low:\nSquare your shoulders, lift your pack / And leave your friends and go.\nO never fear, lads, naught's to dread, / Look not left nor right:\nIn all the endless road you tread / There's nothing but the night.}}\n\nI care not, your Honor, whether the march begins at the gallows or when the gates of Joliet close upon them, there is nothing but the night, and that is little for any human being to expect.\n\nBut there are others to consider. Here are these two families, who have led honest lives, who will bear the name that they bear, and future generations must carry it on.\n\nHere is Leopold's father \u2013 and this boy was the pride of his life. He watched him, he cared for him, he worked for him; the boy was brilliant and accomplished, he educated him, and he thought that fame and position awaited him, as it should have awaited. It is a hard thing for a father to see his life's hopes crumble into dust.\n\nShould he be considered? Should his brothers be considered? Will it do society any good or make your life safer, or any human being's life safer, if it should be handed down from generation to generation, that this boy, their kin, died upon the scaffold?\n\nAnd Loeb's the same. Here are the faithful uncle and brother, who have watched here day by day, while Dickie's father and his mother are too ill to stand this terrific strain, and shall be waiting for a message which means more to them than it can mean to you or me. Shall these be taken into account in this general bereavement?\n\nHave they any rights? Is there any reason, your Honor, why their proud names and all the future generations that bear them shall have this bar sinister written across them? How many boys and girls, how many unborn children will feel it? It is bad enough as it is, God knows. It is bad enough, however it is. But it's not yet death on the scaffold. It's not that. And I ask your Honor, in addition to all that I have said to save two honorable families from a disgrace that never ends, and which could be of no avail to help any human being that lives.\n\nNow, I must say a word more and then I will leave this with you where I should have left it long ago. None of us are unmindful of the public; courts are not, and juries are not. We placed our fate in the hands of a trained court, thinking that he would be more mindful and considerate than a jury. I cannot say how people feel. I have stood here for three months as one might stand at the ocean trying to sweep back the tide. I hope the seas are subsiding and the wind is falling, and I believe they are, but I wish to make no false pretense to this court. The easy thing and the popular thing to do is to hang my clients. I know it. Men and women who do not think will applaud. The cruel and thoughtless will approve. It will be easy today; but in Chicago, and reaching out over the length and breadth of the land, more and more fathers and mothers, the humane, the kind and the hopeful, who are gaining an understanding and asking questions not only about these poor boys, but about their own \u2013 these will join in no acclaim at the death of my clients.\n\nThese would ask that the shedding of blood be stopped, and that the normal feelings of man resume their sway. And as the days and the months and the years go on, they will ask it more and more. But, your Honor, what they shall ask may not count. I know the easy way. I know the future is with me, and what I stand for here; not merely for the lives of these two unfortunate lads, but for all boys and all girls; for all of the young, and as far as possible, for all of the old. I am pleading for life, understanding, charity, kindness, and the infinite mercy that considers all. I am pleading that we overcome cruelty with kindness and hatred with love. I know the future is on my side. Your Honor stands between the past and the future. You may hang these boys; you may hang them by the neck until they are dead. But in doing it you will turn your face toward the past. In doing it you are making it harder for every other boy who in ignorance and darkness must grope his way through the mazes which only childhood knows. In doing it you will make it harder for unborn children. You may save them and make it easier for every child that sometime may stand where these boys stand. You will make it easier for every human being with an aspiration and a vision and a hope and a fate. I am pleading for the future; I am pleading for a time when hatred and cruelty will not control the hearts of men. When we can learn by reason and judgment and understanding and faith that all life is worth saving, and that mercy is the highest attribute of man.\n\nI feel that I should apologize for the length of time I have taken. This case may not be as important as I think it is, and I am sure I do not need to tell this court, or to tell my friends that I would fight just as hard for the poor as for the rich. If I should succeed, my greatest reward and my greatest hope will be that for the countless unfortunates who must tread the same road in blind childhood that these poor boys have trod\u2014that I have done something to help human understanding, to temper justice with mercy, to overcome hate with love.\n\nI was reading last night of the aspiration of the old Persian poet, [[Omar Khayyam]]. It appealed to me as the highest that I can vision. I wish it was in my heart, and I wish it was in the hearts of all:\n\n{{poemquote|\nSo I be written in the Book of Love,\nI do not care about that Book above.\nErase my name or write it as you will,\nSo I be written in the Book of Love.}}\n}}\n\nThe judge was persuaded, though according to his ruling, his decision was based on precedent and the youth of the accused; after 12 days on September 10, 1924 he sentenced both men to [[life imprisonment]] for the murder, and an additional 99 years for the kidnapping.<ref name=\"AmExper\" /><ref name=\"geis\" /> A little over a month later Loeb's father died of [[heart failure]].<ref>''Daily Illini'', University of Illinois, October 28, 1924</ref>\n\n== Prison ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-12794, Nathan Leopold und Richard Loeb.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Leopold (top) and Loeb (bottom)]]\n\nLeopold and Loeb were initially held at [[Joliet Prison]].

These included reorganizing the prison library, revamping the schooling system and teaching its students, and volunteer work in the prison hospital. In 1944, Leopold volunteered for the [[Stateville Penitentiary Malaria Study]]; he was deliberately inoculated with [[malaria]] pathogens and then subjected to multiple experimental malaria treatments.<ref>Higdon, H.

Leopold responded that he did not wish his story told in fictionalized form, but offered Levin a chance to contribute to his own memoir, which was in progress. Levin, unhappy with that suggestion, went ahead with his book alone, despite Leopold's express objections. \n\nThe novel, titled ''Compulsion'',<ref>Levin, M. ''Compulsion''(1956). New York, Simon & Schuster. {{ISBN|0786703199}}</ref> was published in 1956. Levin portrayed Leopold (under the pseudonym Judd Steiner) as a brilliant but deeply disturbed teenager, psychologically driven to kill because of his troubled childhood and an obsession with Loeb.

Housemates are voted out (usually on a weekly basis) until only one remains and wins the cash prize. During their stay in the house, contestant are continuously monitored by live television cameras as well as personal audio microphones.\n\n== Premise ==\nThe program relies on techniques such as a stripped back-to-basic environment, evictions, weekly tasks and competitions set by ''Bigg Boss'', and the \"Confession Room\" where housemates convey their private thoughts to the camera and reveal their number of their fellow housemates whom they wish to be evicted from the house. The housemates with the most nominations are then announced, and viewers are given the opportunity to vote (via [[SMS]] or online through social media and smartphone applications) for the nominee they wish to be evicted or to be saved from eviction. The remaining last person is declared the winner.\n\nThe contestants are required to indulge in housework and are assigned tasks by the producers of the show (who communicate with the housemates via the omnipresent authority figure known to them only as \"Bigg Boss\"). The tasks are designed to test the teamwork abilities and community spirit of the housemates. The housemates' \"luxury budget\" (weekly allowance to buy luxury food items other than the supplied essentials) depends on the outcome of assigned tasks.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Creation ===\n''Bigg Boss'' is a [[Hindi]] ([[Bollywood]]) adaption of [[Big Brother (franchise)|''Big Brother'']] created in [[Big Brother (Dutch TV series)|Netherlands]] by [[John de Mol Jr.]], largely based on the ''[[Celebrity Big Brother]]'' model owned by the [[Endemol Shine Group]]. The show was named ''Bigg Boss'' and a house was constructed for the purpose of the show at [[Lonavla]] in [[Maharashtra]] (Season 1 to 4 and 6 to 12), in Karjat (Season 5), in [[Goregaon]] (Season 13) . ''Bigg Boss'' debuted on television in 2006 through [[Sony Entertainment Television]] with [[Arshad Warsi]] as the host.

Housemates are voted out (usually on a weekly basis) until only one remains and wins the cash prize. During their stay in the house, contestant are continuously monitored by live television cameras as well as personal audio microphones.\n\n== Premise ==\nThe program relies on techniques such as a stripped back-to-basic environment, evictions, weekly tasks and competitions set by ''Bigg Boss'', and the \"Confession Room\" where housemates convey their private thoughts to the camera and reveal their number of their fellow housemates whom they wish to be evicted from the house. The housemates with the most nominations are then announced, and viewers are given the opportunity to vote (via [[SMS]] or online through social media and smartphone applications) for the nominee they wish to be evicted or to be saved from eviction. The remaining last person is declared the winner.\n\nThe contestants are required to indulge in housework and are assigned tasks by the producers of the show (who communicate with the housemates via the omnipresent authority figure known to them only as \"Bigg Boss\"). The tasks are designed to test the teamwork abilities and community spirit of the housemates. The housemates' \"luxury budget\" (weekly allowance to buy luxury food items other than the supplied essentials) depends on the outcome of assigned tasks.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Creation ===\n''Bigg Boss'' is a [[Hindi]] ([[Bollywood]]) adaption of [[Big Brother (franchise)|''Big Brother'']] created in [[Big Brother (Dutch TV series)|Netherlands]] by [[John de Mol Jr.]], largely based on the ''[[Celebrity Big Brother]]'' model owned by the [[Endemol Shine Group]]. The show was named ''Bigg Boss'' and a house was constructed for the purpose of the show at [[Lonavla]] in [[Maharashtra]] (Season 1 to 4 and 6 to 12), in Karjat (Season 5), in [[Goregaon]] (Season 13) . ''Bigg Boss'' debuted on television in 2006 through [[Sony Entertainment Television]] with [[Arshad Warsi]] as the host.

It maintains a [[partial vacuum]], with an [[air pressure]] below [[atmospheric pressure]] inside the pipe network and vacuum station collection vessel. Valves open and reseal automatically when the system is used, so [[differential pressure]] can be maintained without expending much energy pumping. A single central vacuum station can collect the [[wastewater]] of several thousand individual homes, depending on terrain and the local situation.<ref name=palm/>{{Better source|date=January 2020|reason=Commercial vendor}}\n\nVacuum sewers were first installed in Europe in 1882. Dutch engineer [[Charles Liernur]] first applied negative pressure drainage to sewers in the second half of the 19th century.<ref>{{cite|url=http://www.sewerhistory.org/images/aus/aus4/1892_482439.pdf |last=Liernur |first= C.T. |title=Pneumatic Sewerage system |website=sewerhistory.org}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=December 2019}}  Technical implementations of vacuum sewerage systems began in 1959 in Sweden.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nHistorically, vacuum sewers have been a [[niche product]], used only in [[train toilet|trains]], [[airplane toilet|airplanes]], and flat areas with sandy soils and high [[ground water table]]s. [[Gravity sewer]]s were used for most applications, because although vacuum sewers were cheaper to install, they were more expensive to maintain. In the 20th century, vacuum sewer technology has improved significantly: fault-locating sensors have reduced [[operation and maintenance]] costs, and some operators now consider that vacuum sewers can be cheaper to run than conventional gravity sewers.<ref>See {{harv|Gibbs|2016}}: \"'When we did the pilot project study in 1993, we calculated that the present value estimate comparison for vacuum sewers and gravity sewers would intersect in 20 years,' he notes. 'At that point, we predicted that vacuum sewers would be more expensive due to maintenance and upkeep. This was based largely on data known at that time. It has been 23 years now, and we\u2019re still not close to seeing the O&M costs that were originally estimated,' Beach continues. 'We have not crossed the present worth value line, and it will likely be another 10 years before these lines intersect.'\"</ref>\n\n==Basic elements==\n{{multiple image\n| image1 = 3 in valve 2.jpg\n| caption1 = A [[Cutaway (industrial)|cutaway]] of a vacuum valve\n| image2= Vakuumventil Flovac 78 mm.webm\n| caption2 = A similar vacuum valve opening and closing\n}}\n[[File:The vacuum station (3212352359).jpg|thumb|A vacuum station for a student [[dorm]] in [[Norway]], providing suction for all the vacuum toilets in the dorm]]\n[[File:Hooper Utah Vacuum Station.jpg|alt=|thumb|Vacuum station in Hooper, Utah.]]\nThe main components of a vacuum sewer system are a collection chambers and vacuum valve parts, sewers, a central vacuum station and monitoring and control components.\n\nSome vacuum systems have [[vacuum toilet]]s are connected directly to a vacuum line, which requires less water for flushing (less than a quarter of a liter per flush).<ref name=ofworld/> Others use standard gravity drainage for the first phase of collection; sewage flows by means of gravity from each house, as in a standard system. It discharges into a collection [[sump]] that might collect sewage from 2-6 houses and is located in a public area.\n\nVacuum technology is based on differential air pressure. Rotary vane vacuum pumps generate an operation pressure of -0.4 to -0.6 bar at the vacuum station, which is also the only element of the vacuum sewerage system that must be supplied with electricity.\n\nInterface valves are installed inside the collection chambers. They work pneumatically. After a certain fill level inside this sump is reached, the interface valve opens. The impulse to open the valve is transferred by a pneumatically mechanical controlled controller unit. No electricity is needed to open or close the valve. The energy is provided by the vacuum itself.\n\nWhile the valve is open, the resulting differential pressure between atmosphere and vacuum becomes the driving force and transports the wastewater and air towards the vacuum station. Besides these collection chambers, no other manholes, neither for changes in direction, nor for inspection or connection of branch lines, are necessary. High flow velocities keep the system free of any blockages or sedimentation.\n\nLarge systems with numerous collection chambers benefit from the provision of a monitoring system for remote monitoring of the vacuum valves and sump pits. Such systems allow much faster troubleshooting and easier preventive maintenance of collection chambers and valves. However, monitoring systems are optional systems and not required for operation of vacuum sewer systems.\n\nVacuum sewer systems are considered to be free of ex- and infiltration which allows their use even in water protection areas. For this reason, vacuum sewer lines may even be laid in the same trench as potable water lines (depending on local guidelines).\n\nIn order to ensure reliable transport, the vacuum sewer line is laid in a saw-tooth (length-) profile.<ref name=Gibbs2015_sawtooth>See {{harv|Gibbs|2015}}: \"'One of the interesting things I learned about vacuum sewers is that they are gravity assisted,' Garri notes. 'The collection lines have a sawtooth profile. Vacuum pressure in the lines assists gravity to help move sewage slugs along to the treatment plant. This type of innovative design allows for the vacuum sewer mains to be installed at a much shallower depth than gravity sewers.'\"</ref> The whole vacuum sewers are filled with air at a pressure of -0.4 to -0.6 bar. The most important aspect for a reliable operation is the air-to-liquid ratio. When a system is well designed, the sewers contain only very small amounts of sewage. The air-to-liquid ratio is usually maintained by collecting liquid/air simultaneously or controller units that adjust their opening times according to the pressure in the system.\n\nSewers can be laid in flat terrain, and parts may flow uphill (within limits). A saw-tooth profile keeps sewer lines shallow;<ref name=Gibbs2015_sawtooth/> in frost-free climates, trench depth can be about 1.0 \u2013 1.2&nbsp;m. By contrast, [[gravity sewer]]s need a [[monotonic]]ally falling slope of at least 0.5 - 1.0%, which can mean that expensive trenching and pumping stations are needed.\n\nOnce the wastewater arrives in the vacuum collection tank at the vacuum station, it is pumped to the discharge point, which could be either a gravity sewer or the treatment station. As the dwell time of the wastewater inside the system is very short and the wastewater is continuously mixed with air, the sewage is kept fresh and any fouling inside the system is avoided (less H<sub>2</sub>S).\n\n==Advantages==\n[[File:Vacuum sewer system installation.jpg|alt=|thumb|Minimal disruption for vacuum sewers]]\n\n* closed, mechanical/pneumatical controlled system with a central vacuum station. Electrical energy is only needed at this central station\n* no sedimentation due to self-cleansing high velocities\n* spooling and maintenance of the sewer lines is not necessary\n* manholes are not required\n* Usually only a single vacuum pump station is required rather than multiple stations found in gravity and low pressure networks. This frees up land, reduces energy costs and reduces operational costs.\n* investment costs can be reduced up to 50% due to simple trenching at shallow depths, close to surface\n* flexibility of piping, obstacles (as open channels) can be over- or underpassed\n* reduced installation time\n* small diameter sewer pipes of HDPE, PVC materials; savings of material costs\n* aeration of sewage, less development of H<sub>2</sub>S, with its dangers for workers, inhabitants, as well as corrosion of the pipes may be avoided; sewage is kept fresh\n* no odours along the closed vacuum sewers\n* no stormwater infiltration, therefore less hydraulic load at the [[Wastewater treatment|wastewater treatment plant]]\n* no sewage leakages (vacuum avoids exfiltration), which is not only an ecological/public health benefit, but also makes repairs to the pipes easier and more sanitary for repair workers<ref>See {{harv|Gibbs|2016}}: \"Leaks in a vacuum main or lateral likewise are rare... 'That\u2019s one of the things we appreciate about vacuum sewers; if there is a leak in the line, vacuum pressure sucks in whatever is around the hole rather than sewage pouring out into the environment,' notes Read. 'We don\u2019t have to do a line repair standing in sewage.'\"</ref>\n* sewers may be laid in the same trench with other mains, also with potable water or storm-water, as well as in water protection areas\n* Lower cost to maintain in the long term due to shallow trenching and easy identification of problems<ref>See {{harv|Gibbs|2016}}: \"Read said his team can detect the location of small leaks by looking at the diagnostic data at the vacuum station to determine the specific area, then listening for the sucking sound of air rushing in... 'We can usually locate a leak in less than 30 minutes. If you can\u2019t find it in 30 minutes, it must be a very small hole'... Vacuum sewer line repair usually is quick and easy, because collection lines are buried only 3 to 4 feet deep. A small backhoe typically is all that\u2019s required to excavate a leaky pipe.\"</ref>\n* In combination of vacuum toilets it creates concentrated waste streams, which makes it feasible to use different waste water treatment techniques, like anaerobic treatment\n\n==Disadvantages==\n[[File:Hinweisschild-Abwasser_May-2009_clip_SL272651.JPG|thumb|Sign indicating a buried vacuum sewer in [[Germany]].]]\n\n* vacuum systems are not capable of transporting sewage over very long distances, but can pump long distances from the vacuum station to the next sewage treatment plant or main gravity sewer.\n* vacuum sewerage systems are only capable for the collection of wastewater within a separated system (not for the collection of storm water)\n* the lines can only reach up to 3\u20134&nbsp;km laid in flat area (restrictions of the system due to headlosses (3-4.5 m) (friction and static))\n* systems should be designed with help of an experienced manufacturer (concepts are usually free of charge)\n* external energy is required at the central vacuum station; an emergency power supply, such as a backup generator, is needed for power outages.<ref>See {{harv|Gibbs|2015}}: \"He notes that vacuum stations have emergency generators that kick in when power is lost\"</ref>\n* odours close to the vacuum station can occur, a biofilter may be necessary\n* integrity of the pipe joints is paramount\n* grease can clog the sensor tube (if set up incorrectly) thus requiring preventative maintenance cleaning\n* vacuum valves can get stuck open leading to pressure drops in the entire system. However, a monitoring system can help identifying stuck open valves immediately\n\n==Applications==\nVacuum sewer systems may be the preferred system in the case of particular circumstances, such as:\n\n===Transport===\n[[File:Samara - Moscow \"Zhiguli\" train (\u041f\u043e\u0435\u0437\u0434 \u0421\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0440\u0430 - \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430 \"\u0416\u0438\u0433\u0443\u043b\u0438\").jpg|thumb|Vacuum toilet on a train]]\nTrains, aircraft, busses, and many ships with plumbing generally have vacuum systems with vacuum toilets.

Vacuum systems save water.\n\n===Boggy, rocky, or permafrost terrain===\nFlat [[terrain]], unfavorable soil (rocky or swampy ground), or a high groundwater table (which requires dewatering trenches) can make gravity sewerage systems much more expensive. Vacuum sewers are small in diameter and leak inwards, and in frost-free areas, they can be laid close to the surface in small trenches.\n\n===Water protection areas, environmental use===\nVacuum sewers can pass through water protection areas and areas with sensitive high ground water tables, because there is no danger of spoiling groundwater resources (vacuum sewers have a high leak tightness due to their material; and if they leak, they leak inwards). Vacuum systems are used in many environmentally sensitive areas such as the Couran Cove Eco Resort close to the Barrier Reef in Australia. They've also been used to replace septic tanks to reduce nitrogen levels in ground/surface water.<ref>See {{harv|Gibbs|2015}}: \"An important step in the Kings Bay restoration effort was a two-phase vacuum-sewer installation. The project\u2019s goal was to rid the area of nearly 600 aging septic tanks that were contaminating groundwater and contributing to nitrogen buildup in the bay.\"</ref>\n\nVacuum systems have also been applied to collect toxic wastewater from the environment.\n\n===Seasonally sub-freezing climates===\nIf the temperatures in an area dip below freezing in winter, the vacuum line is buried below the [[frost line]], in ground that stays unfrozen year-round (as are conventional gravity sewers). Valves, collection pits, intake vents, and control systems need to be designed to keep functioning despite cold, snow and ice. Temperature-monitoring sensors are also standard, so problems can be noticed early.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aqseptence.com/en/|title=Global supplier for filtration & separation and water technology|website=Aqseptence|language=en|access-date=2020-01-27}}</ref>{{Better source|date=January 2020|reason=Commercial vendor}}\n\nIn the case of [[Plum Island (Massachusetts)]], the island was prone to freezing temperature and excessive snowfall that initially made it difficult to locate a potential problem. They have updated their existing vacuum system since, using the newest and most modern technologies. In their case, they have installed Strategic Monitoring for Advanced Remote Transfer (S.M.A.R.T.) and monitoring systems. The S.M.A.R.T. system utilizes artificial intelligence to identify and correct system imbalances before they occur and monitoring to pinpoint problems if they do occur. Now, Plum Island has the most modern and innovative vacuum sewer system in the world.\u201d\n\n===Low or seasonal population density===\nWith lower population densities, the costs for the collection chambers and vacuum stations are less important than the costs of installing pipe and, for gravity sewers, pumping stations, etc.. Pneumatic pipes are generally smaller than gravity-drained hydraulic ones {{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In frost-free climates, the pipes for a vacuum system can also be buried more shallowly than a gravity system.\n\nHigh specific conduit lengths, where the required pipe length is longer than ~4 metres per inhabitant{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}, will tend to make a vacuum system cheaper.\n\nIn seasonal settlements (recreation areas, camping sites etc.) with conventional gravity sewer systems, sedimentation problems can easily occur as automatic flushing by daily waste water does not take place. High flow velocities within vacuum sewers prevent such sedimentation problems. The Formula 1 race tracks in Shanghai and Abu Dhabi are using a vacuum sewer system for that reason.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Historic sites===\n[[File:Une ruelle de Flavigny - panoramio.jpg|thumb|A sideroad in [[Flavigny-sur-Ozerain]] where it would be difficult to install a conventional gravity sewer.]]\nHistoric sites may have old buildings, narrow streets, and steep terrain. Tourism may also cause strong seasonal fluctuations in population density. Vacuum sewer systems may be selected for their fast (avoiding conflicts with traffic and tourism), cost-effective and flexible installation. Examples include [[Flavigny-sur-Ozerain]], [[France]], and [[Khasab]] and [[Al Seeb]] in [[Oman]].\n\n==Treatment==\nVacuum sewer systems can be set up so that they collect concentrated [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] (toilet wastewater) only, with the [[greywater]] from sinks and baths being collected separately (it is much easier to treat greywater than blackwater). The biosolids from a vacuum system need not be diluted with flushing water.\n\nSewage systems usually [[compost|thermophillically compost]] [[biosolids]] which have been separated and dewatered from a standard gravity sewer.<ref>http://infohouse.p2ric.org/ref/12/11513.pdf</ref><ref name=wwdmag>{{cite web|url=https://www.wwdmag.com/waste-treatment-disposal-services/recent-advancements-wastewater-sludge-composting|title=Recent Advancements in Wastewater Sludge Composting |publisher= Water & Wastes Digest |last1= Turovskiy |first1= Izrail S. |last2= Westbrook |first2= Jeffrey D. |date= 1 October 2002 |website=www.wwdmag.com}}</ref> This process is simpler if the biosolids are never watered.\n\nComposting at high temperatures kills pathogens and seeds.<ref name=wwdmag/><ref>http://www.blockislandwater.org/Biosolids-WaterOpsdata/Simmons-Composting%20Biosolids-July2010.pdf{{Dead link |date=December 2019}} {{Dead link |date=December 2019}}</ref> Biosolids compost is required to be composted at high temperatures.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdaid.org/158/departments/wastewater/biosolids-composting|publisher=City of Coeur d'Alene Idaho |title= BioSolids Composting |website= www.cdaid.org}}</ref>\n\nSewage can also  be treated in an [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic]] process with the production of [[biogas]].

It has therefore installed a vacuum sewer system. Approx. 23,000 people (or 2000 buildings) will be connected to this vacuum sewer system. The system has only one central vacuum station serving 40&nbsp;km of sewer line. The vacuum station is considered to be the biggest vacuum station in the world.<ref name=palm>{{cite|website=sswm.info|publisher=Corodex Electromechanic|title=Vacuum Sewerage System - Palm Jumeirah, Dubai|url=https://sswm.info/sites/default/files/reference_attachments/CE%20ny%20Vacuum%20Sewerage%20System%20Palm%20Jumeirag%20Dubai.pdf}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=December 2019}}\n* The eco-city of [[Masdar City|Masdar]], U.A.E., uses a vacuum sewer system as well to separate grey from black water.\n* Lately, vacuum sewer systems become popular for industrial and commercial projects as well, where only little domestic waste water occurs and where the flexibility of a vacuum sewer system allows easy coordination with usually plenty of other utilities in the ground. Good examples can be found again in the Middle East, such as some small industrial areas in the Emirate of Ras al Khaimah or the newly built Qatalum Aluminium Plant in Qatar, the world's largest primary aluminium plant.\n* Vacuum sewer systems are not only used in the Europe or Middle East but even in low developed third world countries. Several vacuum sewer systems have been already built or are currently under construction in Africa (South Africa, Botswana, Namibia) for townships and rural areas where the benefit of fast construction time, cost saving trenching and high flexibility have come to full effect.\n* Australia has been one of the largest users of vacuum sewer systems due to the low installation and operational costs. The largest system to-date has been at the Tea Gardens development in New South Wales, which will ultimately handle over 4,500 houses. The [[Water Corporation]] in Western Australia is considered the largest single owner of vacuum systems in the world with over 30 schemes now under their operational control.\n\n===High water table areas===\n* The United Kingdom is well served by vacuum sewerage systems. The region most extensively served is the low lying fenlands of the East of England. High water tables (in some cases less than 1 metre below the surface) and poor ground conditions have meant that the local water company, Anglian Water, has embraced the use of vacuum sewerage, taking advantage of the system's requirement for small bore sewer pipes laid in shallow trenches, dramatically reducing the requirement for pumping stations as would be required by conventional gravity sewer systems. The largest vacuum sewerage scheme in this region serves the villages of Outwell and Upwell; four vacuum collection stations serve some 1500 homes in this agglomeration. On initial costings for a conventional gravity sewer to serve the area, previously served by domestic septic settlement tanks the site would have required the installation of 32 pumping stations. Using a vacuum sewer system, this number of pumping stations was reduced to four vacuum stations. Other companies in the UK such as Southern Water operate vacuum sewer systems, too.\n* In northern Germany, several hundred systems have been operating since the 1970s.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} More are planned.<ref>{{cite|last= Herbst |first= Heinrich |title= \u00d6konomische Bewertung von  Abwasserinfrastruktursystemen |url= https://f-origin.hypotheses.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/146/files/2010/02/Herbst_IBA_Vortrag-11-09finaL.pdf |language= German |date= November 2009}}</ref> [[Hamburg]]'s 770-unit Jenfelder Au development was planned with vacuum sewers.<ref name=hamburg/>\n* The city of [[Ocean Shores, Washington]] makes a good case for vacuum sewer reliability and endurance.

It maintains a [[partial vacuum]], with an [[air pressure]] below [[atmospheric pressure]] inside the pipe network and vacuum station collection vessel. Valves open and reseal automatically when the system is used, so [[differential pressure]] can be maintained without expending much energy pumping. A single central vacuum station can collect the [[wastewater]] of several thousand individual homes, depending on terrain and the local situation.<ref name=palm/>{{Better source|date=January 2020|reason=Commercial vendor}}\n\nVacuum sewers were first installed in Europe in 1882. Dutch engineer [[Charles Liernur]] first applied negative pressure drainage to sewers in the second half of the 19th century.<ref>{{cite|url=http://www.sewerhistory.org/images/aus/aus4/1892_482439.pdf |last=Liernur |first= C.T. |title=Pneumatic Sewerage system |website=sewerhistory.org}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=December 2019}}  Technical implementations of vacuum sewerage systems began in 1959 in Sweden.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nHistorically, vacuum sewers have been a [[niche product]], used only in [[train toilet|trains]], [[airplane toilet|airplanes]], and flat areas with sandy soils and high [[ground water table]]s. [[Gravity sewer]]s were used for most applications, because although vacuum sewers were cheaper to install, they were more expensive to maintain. In the 20th century, vacuum sewer technology has improved significantly: fault-locating sensors have reduced [[operation and maintenance]] costs, and some operators now consider that vacuum sewers can be cheaper to run than conventional gravity sewers.<ref>See {{harv|Gibbs|2016}}: \"'When we did the pilot project study in 1993, we calculated that the present value estimate comparison for vacuum sewers and gravity sewers would intersect in 20 years,' he notes. 'At that point, we predicted that vacuum sewers would be more expensive due to maintenance and upkeep. This was based largely on data known at that time. It has been 23 years now, and we\u2019re still not close to seeing the O&M costs that were originally estimated,' Beach continues. 'We have not crossed the present worth value line, and it will likely be another 10 years before these lines intersect.'\"</ref>\n\n==Basic elements==\n{{multiple image\n| image1 = 3 in valve 2.jpg\n| caption1 = A [[Cutaway (industrial)|cutaway]] of a vacuum valve\n| image2= Vakuumventil Flovac 78 mm.webm\n| caption2 = A similar vacuum valve opening and closing\n}}\n[[File:The vacuum station (3212352359).jpg|thumb|A vacuum station for a student [[dorm]] in [[Norway]], providing suction for all the vacuum toilets in the dorm]]\n[[File:Hooper Utah Vacuum Station.jpg|alt=|thumb|Vacuum station in Hooper, Utah.]]\nThe main components of a vacuum sewer system are a collection chambers and vacuum valve parts, sewers, a central vacuum station and monitoring and control components.\n\nSome vacuum systems have [[vacuum toilet]]s are connected directly to a vacuum line, which requires less water for flushing (less than a quarter of a liter per flush).<ref name=ofworld/> Others use standard gravity drainage for the first phase of collection; sewage flows by means of gravity from each house, as in a standard system. It discharges into a collection [[sump]] that might collect sewage from 2-6 houses and is located in a public area.\n\nVacuum technology is based on differential air pressure. Rotary vane vacuum pumps generate an operation pressure of -0.4 to -0.6 bar at the vacuum station, which is also the only element of the vacuum sewerage system that must be supplied with electricity.\n\nInterface valves are installed inside the collection chambers. They work pneumatically. After a certain fill level inside this sump is reached, the interface valve opens. The impulse to open the valve is transferred by a pneumatically mechanical controlled controller unit. No electricity is needed to open or close the valve. The energy is provided by the vacuum itself.\n\nWhile the valve is open, the resulting differential pressure between atmosphere and vacuum becomes the driving force and transports the wastewater and air towards the vacuum station. Besides these collection chambers, no other manholes, neither for changes in direction, nor for inspection or connection of branch lines, are necessary. High flow velocities keep the system free of any blockages or sedimentation.\n\nLarge systems with numerous collection chambers benefit from the provision of a monitoring system for remote monitoring of the vacuum valves and sump pits. Such systems allow much faster troubleshooting and easier preventive maintenance of collection chambers and valves. However, monitoring systems are optional systems and not required for operation of vacuum sewer systems.\n\nVacuum sewer systems are considered to be free of ex- and infiltration which allows their use even in water protection areas. For this reason, vacuum sewer lines may even be laid in the same trench as potable water lines (depending on local guidelines).\n\nIn order to ensure reliable transport, the vacuum sewer line is laid in a saw-tooth (length-) profile.<ref name=Gibbs2015_sawtooth>See {{harv|Gibbs|2015}}: \"'One of the interesting things I learned about vacuum sewers is that they are gravity assisted,' Garri notes. 'The collection lines have a sawtooth profile. Vacuum pressure in the lines assists gravity to help move sewage slugs along to the treatment plant. This type of innovative design allows for the vacuum sewer mains to be installed at a much shallower depth than gravity sewers.'\"</ref> The whole vacuum sewers are filled with air at a pressure of -0.4 to -0.6 bar. The most important aspect for a reliable operation is the air-to-liquid ratio. When a system is well designed, the sewers contain only very small amounts of sewage. The air-to-liquid ratio is usually maintained by collecting liquid/air simultaneously or controller units that adjust their opening times according to the pressure in the system.\n\nSewers can be laid in flat terrain, and parts may flow uphill (within limits). A saw-tooth profile keeps sewer lines shallow;<ref name=Gibbs2015_sawtooth/> in frost-free climates, trench depth can be about 1.0 \u2013 1.2&nbsp;m. By contrast, [[gravity sewer]]s need a [[monotonic]]ally falling slope of at least 0.5 - 1.0%, which can mean that expensive trenching and pumping stations are needed.\n\nOnce the wastewater arrives in the vacuum collection tank at the vacuum station, it is pumped to the discharge point, which could be either a gravity sewer or the treatment station. As the dwell time of the wastewater inside the system is very short and the wastewater is continuously mixed with air, the sewage is kept fresh and any fouling inside the system is avoided (less H<sub>2</sub>S).\n\n==Advantages==\n[[File:Vacuum sewer system installation.jpg|alt=|thumb|Minimal disruption for vacuum sewers]]\n\n* closed, mechanical/pneumatical controlled system with a central vacuum station. Electrical energy is only needed at this central station\n* no sedimentation due to self-cleansing high velocities\n* spooling and maintenance of the sewer lines is not necessary\n* manholes are not required\n* Usually only a single vacuum pump station is required rather than multiple stations found in gravity and low pressure networks. This frees up land, reduces energy costs and reduces operational costs.\n* investment costs can be reduced up to 50% due to simple trenching at shallow depths, close to surface\n* flexibility of piping, obstacles (as open channels) can be over- or underpassed\n* reduced installation time\n* small diameter sewer pipes of HDPE, PVC materials; savings of material costs\n* aeration of sewage, less development of H<sub>2</sub>S, with its dangers for workers, inhabitants, as well as corrosion of the pipes may be avoided; sewage is kept fresh\n* no odours along the closed vacuum sewers\n* no stormwater infiltration, therefore less hydraulic load at the [[Wastewater treatment|wastewater treatment plant]]\n* no sewage leakages (vacuum avoids exfiltration), which is not only an ecological/public health benefit, but also makes repairs to the pipes easier and more sanitary for repair workers<ref>See {{harv|Gibbs|2016}}: \"Leaks in a vacuum main or lateral likewise are rare... 'That\u2019s one of the things we appreciate about vacuum sewers; if there is a leak in the line, vacuum pressure sucks in whatever is around the hole rather than sewage pouring out into the environment,' notes Read. 'We don\u2019t have to do a line repair standing in sewage.'\"</ref>\n* sewers may be laid in the same trench with other mains, also with potable water or storm-water, as well as in water protection areas\n* Lower cost to maintain in the long term due to shallow trenching and easy identification of problems<ref>See {{harv|Gibbs|2016}}: \"Read said his team can detect the location of small leaks by looking at the diagnostic data at the vacuum station to determine the specific area, then listening for the sucking sound of air rushing in... 'We can usually locate a leak in less than 30 minutes. If you can\u2019t find it in 30 minutes, it must be a very small hole'... Vacuum sewer line repair usually is quick and easy, because collection lines are buried only 3 to 4 feet deep. A small backhoe typically is all that\u2019s required to excavate a leaky pipe.\"</ref>\n* In combination of vacuum toilets it creates concentrated waste streams, which makes it feasible to use different waste water treatment techniques, like anaerobic treatment\n\n==Disadvantages==\n[[File:Hinweisschild-Abwasser_May-2009_clip_SL272651.JPG|thumb|Sign indicating a buried vacuum sewer in [[Germany]].]]\n\n* vacuum systems are not capable of transporting sewage over very long distances, but can pump long distances from the vacuum station to the next sewage treatment plant or main gravity sewer.\n* vacuum sewerage systems are only capable for the collection of wastewater within a separated system (not for the collection of storm water)\n* the lines can only reach up to 3\u20134&nbsp;km laid in flat area (restrictions of the system due to headlosses (3-4.5 m) (friction and static))\n* systems should be designed with help of an experienced manufacturer (concepts are usually free of charge)\n* external energy is required at the central vacuum station; an emergency power supply, such as a backup generator, is needed for power outages.<ref>See {{harv|Gibbs|2015}}: \"He notes that vacuum stations have emergency generators that kick in when power is lost\"</ref>\n* odours close to the vacuum station can occur, a biofilter may be necessary\n* integrity of the pipe joints is paramount\n* grease can clog the sensor tube (if set up incorrectly) thus requiring preventative maintenance cleaning\n* vacuum valves can get stuck open leading to pressure drops in the entire system. However, a monitoring system can help identifying stuck open valves immediately\n\n==Applications==\nVacuum sewer systems may be the preferred system in the case of particular circumstances, such as:\n\n===Transport===\n[[File:Samara - Moscow \"Zhiguli\" train (\u041f\u043e\u0435\u0437\u0434 \u0421\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0440\u0430 - \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430 \"\u0416\u0438\u0433\u0443\u043b\u0438\").jpg|thumb|Vacuum toilet on a train]]\nTrains, aircraft, busses, and many ships with plumbing generally have vacuum systems with vacuum toilets.

Vacuum systems save water.\n\n===Boggy, rocky, or permafrost terrain===\nFlat [[terrain]], unfavorable soil (rocky or swampy ground), or a high groundwater table (which requires dewatering trenches) can make gravity sewerage systems much more expensive. Vacuum sewers are small in diameter and leak inwards, and in frost-free areas, they can be laid close to the surface in small trenches.\n\n===Water protection areas, environmental use===\nVacuum sewers can pass through water protection areas and areas with sensitive high ground water tables, because there is no danger of spoiling groundwater resources (vacuum sewers have a high leak tightness due to their material; and if they leak, they leak inwards). Vacuum systems are used in many environmentally sensitive areas such as the Couran Cove Eco Resort close to the Barrier Reef in Australia. They've also been used to replace septic tanks to reduce nitrogen levels in ground/surface water.<ref>See {{harv|Gibbs|2015}}: \"An important step in the Kings Bay restoration effort was a two-phase vacuum-sewer installation. The project\u2019s goal was to rid the area of nearly 600 aging septic tanks that were contaminating groundwater and contributing to nitrogen buildup in the bay.\"</ref>\n\nVacuum systems have also been applied to collect toxic wastewater from the environment.\n\n===Seasonally sub-freezing climates===\nIf the temperatures in an area dip below freezing in winter, the vacuum line is buried below the [[frost line]], in ground that stays unfrozen year-round (as are conventional gravity sewers). Valves, collection pits, intake vents, and control systems need to be designed to keep functioning despite cold, snow and ice. Temperature-monitoring sensors are also standard, so problems can be noticed early.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aqseptence.com/en/|title=Global supplier for filtration & separation and water technology|website=Aqseptence|language=en|access-date=2020-01-27}}</ref>{{Better source|date=January 2020|reason=Commercial vendor}}\n\nIn [[Plum Island (Massachusetts)]], a vacuum sewer was installed without these precautions, despite the [[Newburyport, Massachusetts#Geography|local climate]], which has sub-freezing temperatures and significant snowfall in winter. The system worked in summer, but in winter the pipes and valves froze, the air intakes became buried in snowdrifts, and sewage backed up into homes. 60 households had to be rehoused in hotels until the thaw.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newburyportnews.com/news/local_news/on-plum-island-justice-sought-for-sewer-woes/article_e75acdd8-e7f0-504b-a033-c006650b8ea5.html|title=On Plum Island, 'justice' sought for sewer woes|date=14 March 2015|website=newburyportnews.com|publisher=[[The Daily News of Newburyport]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite|url=http://www.acton-ma.gov/DocumentCenter/Home/View/585|website=action-ma.gov|title=Problems plague Plum Island sewer |publisher= [[Acton, Massachusetts|Town of Acton Massachusetts]]}}</ref> They have since updated their existing vacuum system.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Low or seasonal population density===\nWith lower population densities, the costs for the collection chambers and vacuum stations are less important than the costs of installing pipe and, for gravity sewers, pumping stations, etc.. Pneumatic pipes are generally smaller than gravity-drained hydraulic ones {{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In frost-free climates, the pipes for a vacuum system can also be buried more shallowly than a gravity system.\n\nHigh specific conduit lengths, where the required pipe length is longer than ~4 metres per inhabitant{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}, will tend to make a vacuum system cheaper.\n\nIn seasonal settlements (recreation areas, camping sites etc.) with conventional gravity sewer systems, sedimentation problems can easily occur as automatic flushing by daily waste water does not take place. High flow velocities within vacuum sewers prevent such sedimentation problems. The Formula 1 race tracks in Shanghai and Abu Dhabi are using a vacuum sewer system for that reason.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Historic sites===\n[[File:Une ruelle de Flavigny - panoramio.jpg|thumb|A sideroad in [[Flavigny-sur-Ozerain]] where it would be difficult to install a conventional gravity sewer.]]\nHistoric sites may have old buildings, narrow streets, and steep terrain. Tourism may also cause strong seasonal fluctuations in population density. Vacuum sewer systems may be selected for their fast (avoiding conflicts with traffic and tourism), cost-effective and flexible installation. Examples include [[Flavigny-sur-Ozerain]], [[France]], and [[Khasab]] and [[Al Seeb]] in [[Oman]].\n\n==Treatment==\nVacuum sewer systems can be set up so that they collect concentrated [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] (toilet wastewater) only, with the [[greywater]] from sinks and baths being collected separately (it is much easier to treat greywater than blackwater). The biosolids from a vacuum system need not be diluted with flushing water.\n\nSewage systems usually [[compost|thermophillically compost]] [[biosolids]] which have been separated and dewatered from a standard gravity sewer.<ref>http://infohouse.p2ric.org/ref/12/11513.pdf</ref><ref name=wwdmag>{{cite web|url=https://www.wwdmag.com/waste-treatment-disposal-services/recent-advancements-wastewater-sludge-composting|title=Recent Advancements in Wastewater Sludge Composting |publisher= Water & Wastes Digest |last1= Turovskiy |first1= Izrail S. |last2= Westbrook |first2= Jeffrey D. |date= 1 October 2002 |website=www.wwdmag.com}}</ref> This process is simpler if the biosolids are never watered.\n\nComposting at high temperatures kills pathogens and seeds.<ref name=wwdmag/><ref>http://www.blockislandwater.org/Biosolids-WaterOpsdata/Simmons-Composting%20Biosolids-July2010.pdf{{Dead link |date=December 2019}} {{Dead link |date=December 2019}}</ref> Biosolids compost is required to be composted at high temperatures.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdaid.org/158/departments/wastewater/biosolids-composting|publisher=City of Coeur d'Alene Idaho |title= BioSolids Composting |website= www.cdaid.org}}</ref>\n\nSewage can also  be treated in an [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic]] process with the production of [[biogas]].

It has therefore installed a vacuum sewer system. Approx. 23,000 people (or 2000 buildings) will be connected to this vacuum sewer system. The system has only one central vacuum station serving 40&nbsp;km of sewer line. The vacuum station is considered to be the biggest vacuum station in the world.<ref name=palm>{{cite|website=sswm.info|publisher=Corodex Electromechanic|title=Vacuum Sewerage System - Palm Jumeirah, Dubai|url=https://sswm.info/sites/default/files/reference_attachments/CE%20ny%20Vacuum%20Sewerage%20System%20Palm%20Jumeirag%20Dubai.pdf}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=December 2019}}\n* The eco-city of [[Masdar City|Masdar]], U.A.E., uses a vacuum sewer system as well to separate grey from black water.\n* Lately, vacuum sewer systems become popular for industrial and commercial projects as well, where only little domestic waste water occurs and where the flexibility of a vacuum sewer system allows easy coordination with usually plenty of other utilities in the ground. Good examples can be found again in the Middle East, such as some small industrial areas in the Emirate of Ras al Khaimah or the newly built Qatalum Aluminium Plant in Qatar, the world's largest primary aluminium plant.\n* Vacuum sewer systems are not only used in the Europe or Middle East but even in low developed third world countries. Several vacuum sewer systems have been already built or are currently under construction in Africa (South Africa, Botswana, Namibia) for townships and rural areas where the benefit of fast construction time, cost saving trenching and high flexibility have come to full effect.\n* Australia has been one of the largest users of vacuum sewer systems due to the low installation and operational costs. The largest system to-date has been at the Tea Gardens development in New South Wales, which will ultimately handle over 4,500 houses. The [[Water Corporation]] in Western Australia is considered the largest single owner of vacuum systems in the world with over 30 schemes now under their operational control.\n\n===High water table areas===\n* The United Kingdom is well served by vacuum sewerage systems. The region most extensively served is the low lying fenlands of the East of England. High water tables (in some cases less than 1 metre below the surface) and poor ground conditions have meant that the local water company, Anglian Water, has embraced the use of vacuum sewerage, taking advantage of the system's requirement for small bore sewer pipes laid in shallow trenches, dramatically reducing the requirement for pumping stations as would be required by conventional gravity sewer systems. The largest vacuum sewerage scheme in this region serves the villages of Outwell and Upwell; four vacuum collection stations serve some 1500 homes in this agglomeration. On initial costings for a conventional gravity sewer to serve the area, previously served by domestic septic settlement tanks the site would have required the installation of 32 pumping stations. Using a vacuum sewer system, this number of pumping stations was reduced to four vacuum stations. Other companies in the UK such as Southern Water operate vacuum sewer systems, too.\n* In northern Germany, several hundred systems have been operating since the 1970s.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} More are planned.<ref>{{cite|last= Herbst |first= Heinrich |title= \u00d6konomische Bewertung von  Abwasserinfrastruktursystemen |url= https://f-origin.hypotheses.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/146/files/2010/02/Herbst_IBA_Vortrag-11-09finaL.pdf |language= German |date= November 2009}}</ref> [[Hamburg]]'s 770-unit Jenfelder Au development was planned with vacuum sewers.<ref name=hamburg/>\n* The city of [[Ocean Shores, Washington]] makes a good case for vacuum sewer reliability and endurance.
