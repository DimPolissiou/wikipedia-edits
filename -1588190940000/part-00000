Jansen discusses chapter by chapter the depictions in the prophet's biography by [[Ibn Ishaq]] by way of [[Ibn Hisham]] (d.833) which is an important text for traditional Islam. Jansen reveals self-contradictions, contradictions to other historical sources, embellishments by later authors, politically or theologically motivated distortions of the depiction, symbolic meanings of allegedly historical names, literary construction of the depiction according e.g. to biblical models, and chronological and calendrical incredibilities.\n\nSome examples:<ref>Cf. Jansen, ''De Historische Mohammed'', 2005/7</ref>\n\n* The most accurate dating of so many events by an author who writes 150 years later lacks credibility.\n* Although there were [[leap month]]s at the time of Muhammad which had to be intercalated frequently into the moon calendar and which only later became abandoned (allegedly by Muhammad), not a single of the many most accurately dated events depicted by Ibn Ishaq is in a leap month.\n* The depiction of a close relationship between Muhammad and his wife Aisha has a strong  political and theological motivation: [[Aisha]] was the daughter of [[Abu Bakr]], who became Muhammad's successor against the claims of his rival, [[Ali]]. In order to legitimate this succession against the [[Shia Islam|Shia]], who were in favour of Ali, the relationship of Abu Bakr's daughter to Muhammad became emphasized: That Aisha allegedly was the favourite wife of Muhammad, and that various ahadith state that Aisha was either nine or ten years old when the prophet consummated the marriage.\n* The depiction of slaughtering the Jewish tribe of the [[Banu Qurayza]] also has a strong  political and theological motivation: As the \"[[Constitution of Medina|treaty of Medina]]\" shows, the Jews were initially part of the [[Umma]] and were addressed as \"believers\"; cf. the research of Prof. [[Fred Donner]]. When Islam later separated from Judaism, [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] readings of the past came into being. The threefold treason of Muhammad by three Jewish tribes is a literary construction according to biblical models, e.g. the threefold treason of Jesus by the apostle Peter, and thus is historically questionable. There are other traditions about the same event which tell that only the leaders of the tribe had been punished but not each single member of the tribe. The names of the three Jewish tribes do not occur in the \"treaty of Medina\". Finally, such a mass slaughtering would not have gone unnoticed, even not in Muhammad's time, and especially not considering that the victims were Jews: Jews used to live in international trading networks, and Jews are known to write down their history. Most likely, the slaughtering of the Banu Quraiza never happened.\n* The depictions of Ibn Ishaq are generally known to give questionable accounts of the capacities of the prophet -- for example by satisfying all his wives in one night and killing more enemies than similar hadith stories.  Of the same category is the depiction of Muhammad as an illiterate person. The [[revelation]] of the [[Quran]]ic text is all the more miraculous and the capacity of the prophet is all the more astonishing if Muhammad was an illiterate person.\n* The account of [[Muhammad's letters to the Heads-of-State]] (according to traditional Islamic historiography, sent ambassadors with such letters to [[Heraclius]] the [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]], [[Chosroes II]] the [[Khosrow I|Khosrau]] of [[Sasanian Empire|Persia]], the [[Negus]] of [[Kingdom of Aksum|Abyssinia]], [[Muqawqis]] the ruler of [[Egypt]], [[Harith Gassani]] the governor of [[Syria]], [[Munzir ibn Sawa Al Tamimi|Munzir ibn Sawa]] and to the ruler of [[Bahrain]]){{#tag:ref|For example, [[Sigismund Koelle]] reports that \"Ibn Ishak also mentions the names of nine different messengers who had to carry Mohammed's letters to the following potentates: (1) to the Emperor of the Greeks; (2) to Chosroes, the king of Persia; (3) to Najashi, the prince of Abyssinia; (4) to Mokawkas, the prince of Alexandria; (5) to Jeifar and Iyaz, the princes of Oman; (6) to Thumama and Hawza, the princes of Yemama; (7) to Munzir, the prince of Bahrein; (8) to El Harith, the prince of the border districts of Syria; and (9) to the Himyarite Harith Ibn Abd Kulal, the prince of Yemen.\" [[Sigismund Koelle|Koelle, S. W.]] (1889). Mohammed and Mohammedanism Critically Considered (p. 194). London: Rivingtons.|group=Note}}  that they should convert to Islam, retrospectively justifies the Arabic expansion as a religious, Islamic expansion.\n\nJansen points out that because of the cryptic nature of the Quran, which usually alludes to events rather than describing them and seldom describes the situation for which a revelation was made, the historically questionable traditions are of great importance for the interpretation and understanding of the Quran.  Many Islamic traditions came into being long after Muhammad on the basis of mere guesses for what situation a Quranic verse had been revealed. Because these historically questionable traditions, the interpretation of the Quran has been restricted ever since.\n\nIn her work ''[[Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam]]'' Patricia Crone gives a general examination of the credibility of Islamic traditions. This work is often cited in literature and discusses a few aspects of Muhammad's biography, which are intended to illustrate the nature of Islamic traditions. Concerning the encounter of the young Muhammad with Jews who recognize him as a prophet, and other stories, Patricia Crone writes: ''\"These stories are no different from those on Muhammad's encounter with Jews and others. Being non-miraculous, they do not violate any laws of nature, of course, and in that sense they could be true. In fact, they are clearly not. [...] We cannot even tell whether there ''was'' an original event: in the case of Muhammad's encounter with the Jews and others there was not. Either a fictitious theme has acquired reality thanks to the activities of storytellers or else a historical event has been swamped by these activities.\"''<ref name=\"crone-encounter\">Patricia Crone: [[Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam]],1987, p. 222</ref>\n\n== The new theses about the beginnings of Islam ==\nThe events in early Islamic times have to be newly researched and reconstructed with the help of the historical-critical method. In the following the theses of the revisionists in broad outline:\n\n* The Quranic text as is in use today shows many differences to the earliest existing manuscripts. A core part of the Quran may derive from Muhammad's annunciations, yet some parts of the Quran were definitively added later or were reworked later. In addition to this, many small deviations came into the text as with other ancient texts which were manually copied and copied again.<ref>John Wansbrough: ''Quranic Studies: Sources and Methods of Scriptural Interpretation'' (1977) pp. 43 ff.; Gerd-R\u00fcdiger Puin: ''Observations on Early Qur'an Manuscripts in San\u2019a\u2019'', in: Stefan Wild (Hrsg.): The Qur\u2019an as Text. Brill, Leiden 1996; pp. 107-111</ref>\n* The existence and significance of the prophet Muhammad as a historical person depends especially on the question whether any, and if so, how many, parts of the Quran can be attributed to his time, or whether all or most parts of the Quran came into being only after Muhammad's time. The researchers' opinions differ over this question.<ref>Yehuda D. Nevo: ''Crossroads to Islam: The Origins of the Arab Religion and the Arab State'' (2003); Karl-Heinz Ohlig (Hrsg.): ''Der fr\u00fche Islam.

This could be a possible explanation of why a fifth of the Quranic text is difficult to understand.<ref>Karl-Heinz Ohlig (Hrsg.): ''Der fr\u00fche Islam.

The \"infidels\" were no pagan polytheists but monotheists who were polemically considered to deviate slightly from monotheism.<ref>G. R.

They rather point to a place somewhere in north-western Arabia, e.g. Petra in Jordan.<ref>Patricia Crone / Michael Cook: ''Hagarism'' (1977) pp. 22-24; Patricia Crone: ''Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam'' (1987); and the private researcher Dan Gibson: ''Quranic Geography'' (2011)</ref>\n* The connection  between Muslims and Jews was very close in the early times of Islam. Jews too were called \"believers\" and were part of the umma. Antijewish texts such as, for example, the account of the slaughter of the Jewish tribe of [[Banu Qurayza]] came into being long after Muhammad when Islam had separated from Judaism.<ref>Fred Donner: ''Muhammad and the Believers. At the Origins of Islam'' (2010) pp. 68 ff.; cf. also Hans Jansen: Mohammed (2005/7) pp. 311-317 (German edition 2008)</ref>\n* In the beginning, secular and spiritual power were united in the person of the caliph. There were no special religious scholars. Religious scholars came into being only later and conquered the spiritual power from the caliphs.<ref>Patricia Crone / Martin Hinds: ''God's Caliph: Religious Authority in the First Centuries of Islam'' (1986)</ref>\n* The Islamic expansion was probably not Islamic, religiously motivated, expansion, but a secular, Arab expansion. The expansion did not yet result in oppression of the non-Muslim population.<ref>Robert G. Hoyland: ''In God's Path. The Arab Conquests and the Creation of an Islamic Empire'' (2015)</ref>\n* After Muhammad there were at least two phases which were of major importance for the formation of Islam in its later shape:\n** Under the Umayyad caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem was built. There the word \"Islam\" appears for the first time. Until this moment the Muslims called themselves simply \"believers\", and coins were minted in the Arabic empire showing Christian symbols. Abd al-Malik also plays a major role in the reworking of the Quranic text.<ref>Patricia Crone / Michael Cook: ''Hagarism'' (1977) p. 29; Yehuda D. Nevo: ''Crossroads to Islam: The Origins of the Arab Religion and the Arab State'' (2003) pp. 410-413; Karl-Heinz Ohlig (Hrsg.): ''Der fr\u00fche Islam. Eine historisch-kritische Rekonstruktion anhand zeitgen\u00f6ssischer Quellen'' (2007) pp. 336 ff.</ref>\n** It was during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] that practically all Islamic traditional texts about Islam's beginnings were written. The Abbasids as the victorious party in the conflict with the Umayyads had great interest in legitimizing their rule. This motivation obviously crept into the traditional texts.<ref>Patricia Crone: ''Slaves on Horses. The Evolution of the Islamic Polity'' (1980) pp. 7, 12, 15; auch Hans Jansen: ''Mohammed'' (2005/7)</ref>\n\n== Criticism of Revisionism ==\n\nThe consequent historical-critical analysis of early Islam met severe resistance in the beginning since then provocative theses with far-reaching meaning were published without sufficient evidence. Especially Patricia Crone's and Michael Cook's book ''Hagarism'' (1977) stirred up a lot of harsh criticism. Important representatives of Revisionism like Patricia Crone or Michael Cook meanwhile distanced themselves from such radical theses and uncautious publications.\n<ref>Cf. e.g. Toby Lester: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/ ''What is the Koran?''], in: The Atlantic, issue January 1999</ref>\n\nCriticism is expressed by researchers like [[Tilman Nagel]], who aims at the speculative nature of some theses and shows that some revisionists lack some scholarly standards. On the other hand, Nagel accepts the basic impulse of the new movement, to put more emphasis on the application of the historical-critical method.<ref>Cf. e.g. Tilman Nagel: [http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/buecher/rezensionen/sachbuch/islamwissenschaft-befreit-den-propheten-aus-seiner-religioesen-umklammerung-1464313.html Befreit den Propheten aus seiner religi\u00f6sen Umklammerung!] in: Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 21 September 2009</ref> \nA certain tendency to take revisionists seriously becomes obvious e.g. by the fact that opponents address their criticism not any longer to \"revisionism\" alone but to \"extreme revisionism\" or \"ultra-revisionism\".<ref>Cf. e.g. Marion Holmes Katz: [https://books.google.de/books?id=xI_7uosa4FMC&lpg=PA27&ots=EMLqEHO3nI&pg=PA27#v=onepage&q&f=false Body of Text: The Emergence of the Sunni Law of Ritual Purity] (2012), p. 27</ref>\n\n[[Gregor Schoeler]] discusses the revisionist school and depicts the early controversies. Schoeler considers revisionism to be too radical yet welcomes the general impulse: \"To have made us thinking about this all and much more remarkable things for the first time -- or again, is without any doubt a merit of the new generation of the 'skeptics'.\"<ref>Gregor Schoeler, ''Charakter und Authentie der muslimischen \u00dcberlieferung \u00fcber das Leben Mohammeds'', de Gruyter 1996. pp. 18 f., 23 f. 142 f.; original citation p. 24: \"dies alles und noch manches Beachtenswerte mehr uns zum ersten Mal -- oder erneut -- zu bedenken gegeben zu haben, ist zweifellos ein Verdienst der neuen Generation der 'Skeptiker'.\"</ref>\n\nFran\u00e7ois de Blois rejects the application of the historical-critical method to Islamic texts. He argues that this method was developed for Christian texts and thus there is no reason to apply this method to Islamic texts, too.<ref>Cf. e.g. Fran\u00e7ois de Blois, [https://books.google.de/books?id=GcgCErhKGrAC&lpg=PA615&pg=PA615#v=onepage&q&f=false Islam in its Arabian Context, p. 615], in: The Qur'an in Context, ed. by Angelika Neuwirth etc., 2010</ref>\n\n== A challenge for reflection and reform to Islam ==\n{{POV check|section|date=October 2016}}\nThe [[relationship between religion and science]] had always been shaped by conflicts...{{Attribution needed|date=October 2016}} It is always a painful process for any religion to realize that parts of its teachings were wrong: at the beginning, new scientific results are often considered to be an attack on religion itself; only later is it realized that religion can live with the new findings, so long as the religion's core is not affected, and things are sorted out in the way of religious [[reform]]s.<ref>Peter Harrison (ed.): The Cambridge Companion to Science and Religion (2010) pp. 292 f. - Karl-Heinz Ohlig: [http://inarah.de/bereits-veroeffentlichte-artikel/islam-und-islamismus-zur-gegenwaertigen-diskussion/ Islam und Islamismus], in: imprimatur No. 48, 2015, pp. 48-53</ref>\n\nBy nature new findings about the early times of Islam touch the identity of the Islamic religion. Thus it is a justified claim of religious people that any research concerning their religion has to progress with high diligence and cautiousness in order to avoid unnecessary irritations. At the same time it is a justified claim by academics that they can do their research freely and without any restraint, even if the results run contrary to religious teachings.<ref>Cf. Karl-Heinz Ohlig: [http://inarah.de/bereits-veroeffentlichte-artikel/wissenschaftliches-arbeiten-in-der-islamwissenschaft/ Wissenschaftliches Arbeiten in der Islamwissenschaft], in: imprimatur No. 41, 2008</ref>\n\nThe gravity of irritation provided to Islam depends on the question whether core teachings of Islam are touched or not, especially the historicity of Muhammad and the attribution of the Quran to Muhammad.{{Attribution needed|date=October 2016}} According to this question, the historical-critical school can roughly be divided into two groups (for details see the researchers' articles):\n* As far as the research results do not deny the historicity of Muhammad and assume the Quran to have come into being mainly in Muhammad's time, the core essence of the Islamic religion is left untouched. This is the case e.g. for the following representatives of revisionism: [[Patricia Crone]], [[Michael Cook (historian)|Michael Cook]], [[Fred Donner]], [[Tom Holland (author)|Tom Holland]], [[G\u00fcnter L\u00fcling]].\n* As far as the research results do deny the historicity of Muhammad and assume the Quran to have come into being mainly after Muhammad's time, the core essence of the Islamic religion is put into question. This is the case e.g. for the following representatives of revisionism: [[John Wansbrough]], [[Hans Jansen]], [[Karl-Heinz Ohlig]], [[Yehuda D. Nevo]].\n\nBesides the discussion of the historicity of Muhammad as a historical person and the Quranic text attributed to him, Islam faces the following debates:<ref>Salwa Ismail: The Politics of Historical Revisionism: New Re-Readings of the Early Islamic Period, in: Michaelle Browers, Charles Kurzman (ed).: An Islamic Reformation?, Lexington Books (2004), pp. 101-124; especially p. 114 and footnotes 43, 44.

[[Fred Donner]], reviewing the book, notes that by favoring Wansbrough's school of revisionism, the author presents a \"one-sided selection\" that fails to consider the challenges to this line of revisionism.

Jansen discusses chapter by chapter the depictions in the prophet's biography by [[Ibn Ishaq]] by way of [[Ibn Hisham]] (d.833) which is an important text for traditional Islam. Jansen reveals self-contradictions, contradictions to other historical sources, embellishments by later authors, politically or theologically motivated distortions of the depiction, symbolic meanings of allegedly historical names, literary construction of the depiction according e.g. to biblical models, and chronological and calendrical incredibilities.\n\nSome examples:<ref>Cf. Jansen, ''De Historische Mohammed'', 2005/7</ref>\n\n* The most accurate dating of so many events by an author who writes 150 years later lacks credibility.\n* Although there were [[leap month]]s at the time of Muhammad which had to be intercalated frequently into the moon calendar and which only later became abandoned (allegedly by Muhammad), not a single of the many most accurately dated events depicted by Ibn Ishaq is in a leap month.\n* The depiction of a close relationship between Muhammad and his wife Aisha has a strong  political and theological motivation: [[Aisha]] was the daughter of [[Abu Bakr]], who became Muhammad's successor against the claims of his rival, [[Ali]]. In order to legitimate this succession against the [[Shia Islam|Shia]], who were in favour of Ali, the relationship of Abu Bakr's daughter to Muhammad became emphasized: That Aisha allegedly was the favourite wife of Muhammad, and that various ahadith state that Aisha was either nine or ten years old when the prophet consummated the marriage.\n* The depiction of slaughtering the Jewish tribe of the [[Banu Qurayza]] also has a strong  political and theological motivation: As the \"[[Constitution of Medina|treaty of Medina]]\" shows, the Jews were initially part of the [[Umma]] and were addressed as \"believers\"; cf. the research of Prof. [[Fred Donner]]. When Islam later separated from Judaism, [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] readings of the past came into being. The threefold treason of Muhammad by three Jewish tribes is a literary construction according to biblical models, e.g. the threefold treason of Jesus by the apostle Peter, and thus is historically questionable. There are other traditions about the same event which tell that only the leaders of the tribe had been punished but not each single member of the tribe. The names of the three Jewish tribes do not occur in the \"treaty of Medina\". Finally, such a mass slaughtering would not have gone unnoticed, even not in Muhammad's time, and especially not considering that the victims were Jews: Jews used to live in international trading networks, and Jews are known to write down their history. Most likely, the slaughtering of the Banu Quraiza never happened.\n* The depictions of Ibn Ishaq are generally known to give questionable accounts of the capacities of the prophet -- for example by satisfying all his wives in one night and killing more enemies than similar hadith stories.  Of the same category is the depiction of Muhammad as an illiterate person. The [[revelation]] of the [[Quran]]ic text is all the more miraculous and the capacity of the prophet is all the more astonishing if Muhammad was an illiterate person.\n* The account of [[Muhammad's letters to the Heads-of-State]] (according to traditional Islamic historiography, sent ambassadors with such letters to [[Heraclius]] the [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]], [[Chosroes II]] the [[Khosrow I|Khosrau]] of [[Sasanian Empire|Persia]], the [[Negus]] of [[Kingdom of Aksum|Abyssinia]], [[Muqawqis]] the ruler of [[Egypt]], [[Harith Gassani]] the governor of [[Syria]], [[Munzir ibn Sawa Al Tamimi|Munzir ibn Sawa]] and to the ruler of [[Bahrain]]){{#tag:ref|For example, [[Sigismund Koelle]] reports that \"Ibn Ishak also mentions the names of nine different messengers who had to carry Mohammed's letters to the following potentates: (1) to the Emperor of the Greeks; (2) to Chosroes, the king of Persia; (3) to Najashi, the prince of Abyssinia; (4) to Mokawkas, the prince of Alexandria; (5) to Jeifar and Iyaz, the princes of Oman; (6) to Thumama and Hawza, the princes of Yemama; (7) to Munzir, the prince of Bahrein; (8) to El Harith, the prince of the border districts of Syria; and (9) to the Himyarite Harith Ibn Abd Kulal, the prince of Yemen.\" [[Sigismund Koelle|Koelle, S. W.]] (1889). Mohammed and Mohammedanism Critically Considered (p. 194). London: Rivingtons.|group=Note}}  that they should convert to Islam, retrospectively justifies the Arabic expansion as a religious, Islamic expansion.\n\nJansen points out that because of the cryptic nature of the Quran, which usually alludes to events rather than describing them and seldom describes the situation for which a revelation was made, the historically questionable traditions are of great importance for the interpretation and understanding of the Quran.  Many Islamic traditions came into being long after Muhammad on the basis of mere guesses for what situation a Quranic verse had been revealed. Because these historically questionable traditions, the interpretation of the Quran has been restricted ever since.\n\nIn her work ''[[Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam]]'' Patricia Crone gives a general examination of the credibility of Islamic traditions. This work is often cited in literature and discusses a few aspects of Muhammad's biography, which are intended to illustrate the nature of Islamic traditions. Concerning the encounter of the young Muhammad with Jews who recognize him as a prophet, and other stories, Patricia Crone writes: ''\"These stories are no different from those on Muhammad's encounter with Jews and others. Being non-miraculous, they do not violate any laws of nature, of course, and in that sense they could be true. In fact, they are clearly not. [...] We cannot even tell whether there ''was'' an original event: in the case of Muhammad's encounter with the Jews and others there was not. Either a fictitious theme has acquired reality thanks to the activities of storytellers or else a historical event has been swamped by these activities.\"''<ref name=\"crone-encounter\">Patricia Crone: [[Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam]],1987, p. 222</ref>\n\n== The new theses about the beginnings of Islam ==\nThe events in early Islamic times have to be newly researched and reconstructed with the help of the historical-critical method. In the following the theses of the revisionists in broad outline:\n\n* The Quranic text as is in use today shows many differences to the earliest existing manuscripts. A core part of the Quran may derive from Muhammad's annunciations, yet some parts of the Quran were definitively added later or were reworked later. In addition to this, many small deviations came into the text as with other ancient texts which were manually copied and copied again.<ref>John Wansbrough: ''Quranic Studies: Sources and Methods of Scriptural Interpretation'' (1977) pp. 43 ff.; Gerd-R\u00fcdiger Puin: ''Observations on Early Qur'an Manuscripts in San\u2019a\u2019'', in: Stefan Wild (Hrsg.): The Qur\u2019an as Text. Brill, Leiden 1996; pp. 107-111</ref>\n* The existence and significance of the prophet Muhammad as a historical person depends especially on the question whether any, and if so, how many, parts of the Quran can be attributed to his time, or whether all or most parts of the Quran came into being only after Muhammad's time.

Jews too were called \"believers\" and were part of the umma. Antijewish texts such as, for example, the account of the slaughter of the Jewish tribe of [[Banu Qurayza]] came into being long after Muhammad when Islam had separated from Judaism.<ref>Fred Donner: ''Muhammad and the Believers.

There were no special religious scholars. Religious scholars came into being only later and conquered the spiritual power from the caliphs.<ref>Patricia Crone / Martin Hinds: ''God's Caliph: Religious Authority in the First Centuries of Islam'' (1986)</ref>\n* The Islamic expansion was probably not Islamic, religiously motivated, expansion, but a secular, Arab expansion.

There the word \"Islam\" appears for the first time. Until this moment the Muslims called themselves simply \"believers\", and coins were minted in the Arabic empire showing Christian symbols. Abd al-Malik also plays a major role in the reworking of the Quranic text.<ref>Patricia Crone / Michael Cook: ''Hagarism'' (1977) p. 29; Yehuda D.

Eine historisch-kritische Rekonstruktion anhand zeitgen\u00f6ssischer Quellen'' (2007) pp. 336 ff.</ref>\n** It was during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] that practically all Islamic traditional texts about Islam's beginnings were written. The Abbasids as the victorious party in the conflict with the Umayyads had great interest in legitimizing their rule. This motivation obviously crept into the traditional texts.<ref>Patricia Crone: ''Slaves on Horses. The Evolution of the Islamic Polity'' (1980) pp. 7, 12, 15; auch Hans Jansen: ''Mohammed'' (2005/7)</ref>\n\n== Criticism of Revisionism ==\n\nThe consequent historical-critical analysis of early Islam met severe resistance in the beginning since then provocative theses with far-reaching meaning were published without sufficient evidence. Especially Patricia Crone's and Michael Cook's book ''Hagarism'' (1977) stirred up a lot of harsh criticism. Important representatives of Revisionism like Patricia Crone or Michael Cook meanwhile distanced themselves from such radical theses and uncautious publications.\n<ref>Cf. e.g. Toby Lester: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/ ''What is the Koran?''], in: The Atlantic, issue January 1999</ref>\n\nCriticism is expressed by researchers like [[Tilman Nagel]], who aims at the speculative nature of some theses and shows that some revisionists lack some scholarly standards. On the other hand, Nagel accepts the basic impulse of the new movement, to put more emphasis on the application of the historical-critical method.<ref>Cf. e.g. Tilman Nagel: [http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/buecher/rezensionen/sachbuch/islamwissenschaft-befreit-den-propheten-aus-seiner-religioesen-umklammerung-1464313.html Befreit den Propheten aus seiner religi\u00f6sen Umklammerung!] in: Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 21 September 2009</ref> \nA certain tendency to take revisionists seriously becomes obvious e.g. by the fact that opponents address their criticism not any longer to \"revisionism\" alone but to \"extreme revisionism\" or \"ultra-revisionism\".<ref>Cf. e.g. Marion Holmes Katz: [https://books.google.de/books?id=xI_7uosa4FMC&lpg=PA27&ots=EMLqEHO3nI&pg=PA27#v=onepage&q&f=false Body of Text: The Emergence of the Sunni Law of Ritual Purity] (2012), p. 27</ref>\n\n[[Gregor Schoeler]] discusses the revisionist school and depicts the early controversies. Schoeler considers revisionism to be too radical yet welcomes the general impulse: \"To have made us thinking about this all and much more remarkable things for the first time -- or again, is without any doubt a merit of the new generation of the 'skeptics'.\"<ref>Gregor Schoeler, ''Charakter und Authentie der muslimischen \u00dcberlieferung \u00fcber das Leben Mohammeds'', de Gruyter 1996. pp. 18 f., 23 f. 142 f.; original citation p. 24: \"dies alles und noch manches Beachtenswerte mehr uns zum ersten Mal -- oder erneut -- zu bedenken gegeben zu haben, ist zweifellos ein Verdienst der neuen Generation der 'Skeptiker'.\"</ref>\n\nFran\u00e7ois de Blois rejects the application of the historical-critical method to Islamic texts. He argues that this method was developed for Christian texts and thus there is no reason to apply this method to Islamic texts, too.<ref>Cf. e.g. Fran\u00e7ois de Blois, [https://books.google.de/books?id=GcgCErhKGrAC&lpg=PA615&pg=PA615#v=onepage&q&f=false Islam in its Arabian Context, p. 615], in: The Qur'an in Context, ed. by Angelika Neuwirth etc., 2010</ref>\n\n== A challenge for reflection and reform to Islam ==\n{{POV check|section|date=October 2016}}\nThe [[relationship between religion and science]] had always been shaped by conflicts...{{Attribution needed|date=October 2016}} It is always a painful process for any religion to realize that parts of its teachings were wrong: at the beginning, new scientific results are often considered to be an attack on religion itself; only later is it realized that religion can live with the new findings, so long as the religion's core is not affected, and things are sorted out in the way of religious [[reform]]s.<ref>Peter Harrison (ed.): The Cambridge Companion to Science and Religion (2010) pp. 292 f. - Karl-Heinz Ohlig: [http://inarah.de/bereits-veroeffentlichte-artikel/islam-und-islamismus-zur-gegenwaertigen-diskussion/ Islam und Islamismus], in: imprimatur No. 48, 2015, pp. 48-53</ref>\n\nBy nature new findings about the early times of Islam touch the identity of the Islamic religion. Thus it is a justified claim of religious people that any research concerning their religion has to progress with high diligence and cautiousness in order to avoid unnecessary irritations. At the same time it is a justified claim by academics that they can do their research freely and without any restraint, even if the results run contrary to religious teachings.<ref>Cf. Karl-Heinz Ohlig: [http://inarah.de/bereits-veroeffentlichte-artikel/wissenschaftliches-arbeiten-in-der-islamwissenschaft/ Wissenschaftliches Arbeiten in der Islamwissenschaft], in: imprimatur No. 41, 2008</ref>\n\nThe gravity of irritation provided to Islam depends on the question whether core teachings of Islam are touched or not, especially the historicity of Muhammad and the attribution of the Quran to Muhammad.{{Attribution needed|date=October 2016}} According to this question, the historical-critical school can roughly be divided into two groups (for details see the researchers' articles):\n* As far as the research results do not deny the historicity of Muhammad and assume the Quran to have come into being mainly in Muhammad's time, the core essence of the Islamic religion is left untouched. This is the case e.g. for the following representatives of revisionism: [[Patricia Crone]], [[Michael Cook (historian)|Michael Cook]], [[Fred Donner]], [[Tom Holland (author)|Tom Holland]], [[G\u00fcnter L\u00fcling]].\n* As far as the research results do deny the historicity of Muhammad and assume the Quran to have come into being mainly after Muhammad's time, the core essence of the Islamic religion is put into question. This is the case e.g. for the following representatives of revisionism: [[John Wansbrough]], [[Hans Jansen]], [[Karl-Heinz Ohlig]], [[Yehuda D. Nevo]].\n\nBesides the discussion of the historicity of Muhammad as a historical person and the Quranic text attributed to him, Islam faces the following debates:<ref>Salwa Ismail: The Politics of Historical Revisionism: New Re-Readings of the Early Islamic Period, in: Michaelle Browers, Charles Kurzman (ed).: An Islamic Reformation?, Lexington Books (2004), pp. 101-124; especially p. 114 and footnotes 43, 44. Karl-Heinz Ohlig: [http://inarah.de/bereits-veroeffentlichte-artikel/islam-und-islamismus-zur-gegenwaertigen-diskussion/ Islam und Islamismus], in: imprimatur No. 48, 2015, pp. 48-53</ref>\n* Traditional texts which had shaped Islam for centuries - yet ''not'' from the beginning - are not true.\n* The Quranic text has not been handed down to our times unchanged.\n* Even in the Quran, God's word is in many respects clothed in human words.\n* Muhammad did not live in Mecca.\n* The relationship between Muhammad and Jews and Christians was different than always thought it had been.\n\n==Revisionism by non-specialists==\n[[Ibn Warraq]], an author known for his criticism of Islam, has compiled several revisionist essays in his book, ''[[The Quest for the Historical Muhammad (Ibn Warraq)|The Quest for the Historical Muhammad]].'' [[Fred Donner]], reviewing the book, notes that by favoring Wansbrough's school of revisionism, the author presents a \"one-sided selection\" that fails to consider the challenges to this line of revisionism. The result is \"a book that is likely to mislead many an unwary general reader.\"<ref>Fred Donner: [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/review-of-middle-east-studies/article/the-quest-for-the-historical-muhammad-edited-and-translated-by-warraqibn-554-pages-glossary-list-of-tribes-and-individuals-chronology-amherst-ny-prometheus-books-2000-3495-cloth-isbn-1-57392-787-2/4C3D7FD138EF645D933ADDB0BCB33D6B Review of: The Quest for the Historical Muhammad, by Ibn Warraq],  Middle East Studies Association Bulletin, 35(1), pp. 75\u201376.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Historicity of Muhammad]]\n* [[History of the Quran]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography===\n* {{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=Michael|title=The Koran : A Very Short Introduction|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://archive.org/details/koranveryshorti00cook |url-access=registration|quote=The Koran : A Very Short Introduction.|isbn=0192853449 |ref=MCKaVSI2000}}\n*{{cite book |last=Crone |first1=Patricia | title=Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam |year=1987 |publisher=Princeton University Press |url=http://www.almuslih.org/Library/Crone,%20P%20-%20Meccan%20Trade%20and%20the%20Rise%20of%20Islam.pdf | ref=PCMTatRoI1987}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Crone |first1=Patricia |title=Slaves on Horses |url=https://delong.typepad.com/files/slaves_on_horses.pdf  |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1980 | accessdate=23 November 2019 |ref=PCSoH1980}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Crone |first1=Patricia |last2=Hinds |first2=Martin  |url=https://ahadithstudies.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/crone-gods-caliph.pdf |title=God's Caliph: Religious Authority In the First Centuries of Islam |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1986 |accessdate=24 November 2019 | ref=PCMHGCRA1986}}\n*Fred Donner: ''Muhammad and the Believers.
