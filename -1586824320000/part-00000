Her introduction to Americans came in the English-language remake of ''[[Intermezzo (1939 film)|Intermezzo]]'' (1939).  In addition to the classic and Best-Picture-Academy-Award winning ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942) opposite [[Humphrey Bogart]], her notable performances from the 1940s include the dramas ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' (1943), ''[[Gaslight (1944 film)|Gaslight]]'' (1944), ''[[The Bells of St. Mary's]]'' (1945), and ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'' (1948), all of which earned her nominations for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]; she won the award for ''Gaslight''. She made three films with [[Alfred Hitchcock]] including'' [[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), with [[Gregory Peck]], and ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946), opposite [[Cary Grant]].\n\nIn 1950, she starred in [[Roberto Rossellini]]'s ''[[Stromboli (film)|Stromboli]]'', following the revelation that she was having an extramarital affair with the director. The affair and then marriage to Rossellini created a scandal in the United States that forced her to remain in Europe for several years, during which she starred in Rossellini's ''[[Journey to Italy]]'' (1954), now critically acclaimed.  She made a successful return to working for a Hollywood studio in ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), the debut film for Yul Brynner, winning her second Academy Award for Best Actress. In 1958, she starred for a second time with Cary Grant, this time in the popular romantic comedy ''[[Indiscreet (1958 film)|Indiscreet]]''.\n\nIn her later years, she won her third Academy Award, this one for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]], for her small performance in ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'' (1974). In 1978, she worked with director [[Ingmar Bergman]] (no relation) in ''[[Autumn Sonata]]'', for which she received her sixth Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. In her final acting role, she portrayed the late-Israeli Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] in the television mini-series ''[[A Woman Called Golda]]'' (1982) for which she posthumously won her second [[Emmy Award]] for Best Actress. She died on her sixty-seventh birthday (29 August 1982) from breast cancer.\n\nAccording to the ''[[St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture]]'', Bergman quickly became \"the ideal of American womanhood\" and a contender for Hollywood's greatest leading actress.<ref name=James>{{cite book|first1=Tom|last1=Pendergast|first2=Sara|last2=Pendergast|title=St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture|publisher=[[Gale Publishing]]|location=Farmington Hills, Michigan|date=2000|isbn=1-55862-405-8|title-link=St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture}}</ref> In the United States, she is considered to have brought a \"Nordic freshness and vitality\" to the screen, along with exceptional beauty and intelligence; [[David O.

He had wanted Ingrid to become an opera star and, during his lifetime, had her take voice lessons for three years. But she said she always \"knew from the beginning that she wanted to be an actress,\" sometimes wearing her mother's clothes and staging plays in her father's empty studio. Her father documented all her birthdays with a borrowed camera.<ref name=LifeMag/>\n[[File:Bergman first role.jpg|thumb|upright|Her first film, ''Munkbrogreven'' (1934), at age 19]]\nAfter her father's death, she was sent to live with his sister, Ellen Bergman, who died of heart disease only six months later. Ingrid then moved in with her Aunt Hulda and Uncle Otto, who had five children. She would also visit with another aunt, Elsa Adler, whom the young girl called \"Mutti,\" according to family legend.<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|294}}\n\nLater, Bergman received a scholarship to the state-sponsored [[Royal Dramatic Theatre School]], where [[Greta Garbo]] had some years earlier earned a similar scholarship. After several months, she was given a part in a new play, ''Ett Brott'' (''A Crime''), written by Sigfrid Siwertz. Chandler notes that this was \"totally against procedure\" at the school, where girls were expected to complete three years of study before getting such acting roles.<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|33}} During her first summer break, Bergman was hired by a Swedish film studio, which led to her leaving the Royal Dramatic Theatre after just one year, to work in films full-time. Her first film role after leaving the Royal Dramatic Theatre was a small part in ''[[Munkbrogreven]]'' (1935), although she reportedly had previously been an extra in the 1932 film ''Landskamp''). She went on to act in a dozen films in [[Sweden]], including ''[[Intermezzo]]'' (1936) which is graced by a leading performance by Ingrid Bergman (her first), in a role created especially for her, and ''[[En kvinnas ansikte]]'', which was later remade as ''[[A Woman's Face]]'' with [[Joan Crawford]], and one film in [[Germany]], ''Die vier Gesellen'' (''[[The Four Companions (film)|The Four Companions]]'') (1938).\n\n==Hollywood period: 1939\u20131949==\n===''Intermezzo: A Love Story'' (1939)===\nBergman's first acting role in the United States came when [[Hollywood]] producer [[David O. Selznick]] brought her to America to star in ''[[Intermezzo (1939 film)|Intermezzo: A Love Story]]'' (1939), an English language remake of her earlier Swedish film ''[[Intermezzo (1936 film)|Intermezzo]]'' (1936). Unable to speak English, and uncertain about her acceptance by the American audience, she expected to complete this one film and return home to Sweden. Her husband, Dr. Petter Aron Lindstr\u00f6m, remained in Sweden with their daughter Pia (born 1938).<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|63}} In ''Intermezzo'', she played the role of a young piano accompanist opposite [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] as a famous violin virtuoso. She arrived in [[Los Angeles]] on 6 May 1939, and stayed at the Selznick home until she could find another residence. According to Selznick's son Danny, who was a child at the time, his father had concerns about Ingrid: \"She didn't speak English, she was too tall, her name sounded too German, and her eyebrows were too thick.\"\n\nBergman was soon accepted without having to modify her looks or name, despite some early suggestions by Selznick.<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|6}} \"He let her have her way\", notes a story in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. Selznick understood her fear of Hollywood make-up artists, who might turn her into someone she wouldn't recognize, and \"instructed them to lay off\". He was also aware that her natural good looks would compete successfully with Hollywood's \"synthetic razzle-dazzle\".<ref name=LifeMag/> During the following weeks, while ''Intermezzo'' was being filmed, Selznick was also filming ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''. In a letter to William Hebert, his publicity director, Selznick described a few of his early impressions of Bergman:{{quote|Miss Bergman is the most completely conscientious actress with whom I have ever worked, in that she thinks of absolutely nothing but her work before and during the time she is doing a picture&nbsp;... She practically never leaves the studio, and even suggested that her dressing room be equipped so that she could live here during the picture. She never for a minute suggests quitting at six o'clock or anything of the kind&nbsp;... Because of having four stars acting in ''Gone with the Wind'', our star dressing-room suites were all occupied and we had to assign her a smaller suite. She went into ecstasies over it and said she had never had such a suite in her life&nbsp;... All of this is completely unaffected and completely unique and I should think would make a grand angle of approach to her publicity&nbsp;... so that her natural sweetness and consideration and conscientiousness become something of a legend&nbsp;... and is completely in keeping with the fresh and pure personality and appearance which caused me to sign her.<ref name=Selznick>Selznick, David O. ''Memo from David O. Selznick\", Selected and edited by [[Rudy Behlmer]], Viking Press (1972), in letter dated 22 June 1939</ref>{{rp|135\u2013136}}}}\n\n''Intermezzo'' became an enormous success and as a result Bergman became a star. The film's director, [[Gregory Ratoff]], said \"She is sensational\", as an actress. This was the \"sentiment of the entire set\", writes ''Life'', adding that workmen go out of their way to do things for her, and the cast and crew \"admired the quick, alert concentration she gave to direction and to her lines\".<ref name=LifeMag/> Film historian [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] notes that this became \"the start of an astonishing impact on Hollywood and America\", where her lack of make-up contributed to an \"air of nobility\". According to ''Life'', the impression that she left on Hollywood, after she returned to Sweden, was of a tall (5&nbsp;ft. 9 in.) girl \"with light brown hair and blue eyes who was painfully shy, but friendly, with a warm, straight, quick smile\".<ref name=LifeMag/> Selznick appreciated her uniqueness, and with his wife [[Irene Selznick|Irene]], they remained important friends throughout her career.<ref name=Thomson/>{{rp|76}}\n\n===''Casablanca'' (1942)===\n[[File:Casablanca, Trailer Screenshot.JPG|thumb|With Humphrey Bogart in ''Casablanca'']]\nAfter the onset of World War II, Bergman \"felt guilty because she had so misjudged the situation in Germany\" while she was there filming ''Die vier Gesellen'' (The Four Companions). According to one of her biographers, Charlotte Chandler (2007), she had at first considered the [[Nazi]]s only a \"temporary aberration, 'too foolish to be taken seriously'. She believed Germany would not start a war.\" Bergman felt that \"the good people there would not permit it\". Chandler adds, \"Ingrid felt guilty all the rest of her life because when she was in Germany at the end of the war, she had been afraid to go with the others to witness the atrocities of the [[Nazi concentration camp|Nazi extermination camps]]\".<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|293\u2013295}} In 1945, she and her first husband, Dr. Petter Aron Lindstr\u00f6m, who wed on 10 July 1937 in [[St\u00f6de]],<ref name=\"auto2\"/> became United States citizens.<ref name=\"auto2\"/><ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nAfter completing a final film in Sweden and appearing in three moderately successful films (''[[Adam Had Four Sons]]'', ''[[Rage in Heaven]]'', and ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1941 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'', all 1941) in the United States, Bergman co-starred with [[Humphrey Bogart]] in the classic film ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942), which remains her best-known role. In this film, she played the role of Ilsa, the beautiful Norwegian wife of Victor Laszlo, played by [[Paul Henreid]], an \"anti-Nazi underground hero\" who is in [[Casablanca]], a haven from the Nazis.<ref name=Chandler/> Bergman did not consider ''Casablanca'' to be one of her favorite performances. \"I made so many films which were more important, but the only one people ever want to talk about is that one with Bogart.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ingridbergman.com/|title=Ingrid Bergman - The Official Licensing Website of Ingrid Bergman|website=Ingrid Bergman|accessdate=22 February 2019}}</ref> In later years, she stated, \"I feel about ''Casablanca'' that it has a life of its own. There is something mystical about it. It seems to have filled a need, a need that was there before the film, a need that the film filled\".<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|88}}\n\n===''For Whom the Bell Tolls'' (1943)===\nAfter ''Casablanca'', with \"Selznick's steady boosting\", she played the part of Maria in ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' (1943), which was also her first color film. For the role, she received her first Academy Award nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. The film was taken from [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s novel of the [[For Whom the Bell Tolls|same title]] and co-starred [[Gary Cooper]]. When the book was sold to [[Paramount Pictures]], Hemingway stated that, \"Miss Bergman, and no one else, should play the part\". His opinion came from seeing her in her first American role, ''Intermezzo'', although he hadn't yet met her. A few weeks later, they did meet, and after studying her, he said, \"You ''are'' Maria!\".<ref name=LifeMag>Carlile, Thomas, and Speiser, Jean.

Bergman had championed the role since her arrival in Hollywood, which was one of the reasons she had played it on the Broadway stage in Anderson's play. The film was not a big hit with the public, partly because of the scandal of Bergman's affair with [[Italian people|Italian]] film director [[Roberto Rossellini]], which broke while the film was still in theatres. Even worse, it received disastrous reviews, and, although nominated for several Academy Awards, did not receive a Best Picture nomination. It was subsequently cut by 45 minutes, but restored to full length in 1998, and released in 2004 on [[DVD]].\n\nBetween motion pictures, Bergman had appeared in the stage plays ''[[Liliom]]'', ''[[Anna Christie]]'', and ''Joan of Lorraine''. During a press conference in [[Washington, D.C.]] for the promotion of ''Joan of Lorraine'', she protested against [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] after seeing it first hand at the theater she was acting in. This led to a lot of publicity and some hate mail. Bergman went to [[Alaska]] during World War II to entertain [[US Army]] troops. Soon after the war ended, she also went to [[Europe]] for the same purpose, where she was able to see the devastation caused by the war. {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n==Italian period with Rossellini: 1949\u20131957==\n[[File:Ingrid Bergman - 1954.JPG|thumb|left|In ''Fear'' (1954)]]\nBergman strongly admired two films by Italian [[Film director|director]] [[Roberto Rossellini]] that she had seen in the United States. In 1949, Bergman wrote to Rossellini, expressing this admiration and suggesting that she make a film with him. This led to her being cast in his film ''[[Stromboli (film)|Stromboli]]'' (1950). During production, Bergman fell in love with Rossellini, they began an affair, and Bergman became pregnant with their son, Renato Roberto Ranaldo Giusto Giuseppe (\"Robin\") Rossellini (born 2 February 1950).<ref name=Bondanella>Bondanella, Peter E.

She had played a nun in ''[[The Bells of St. Mary's]]'' (1945), and a virgin saint in ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'' (1948).

She married producer Lars Schmidt, a fellow Swede, on 21 December 1958. This marriage ended in divorce in 1975.  After a long hiatus, Bergman made the film ''[[Cactus Flower (film)|Cactus Flower]]'' (1969), with [[Walter Matthau]] and [[Goldie Hawn]]. In this movie, she played a dental nurse-receptionist who is secretly in love with her boss, the dentist, played by Matthau. The ''New York Times'' wrote \"The teaming of Matthau, whose dour, craggy virility now supplants the easy charm of [[Barry Nelson]], and the ultra-feminine Miss Bergman, in a rare comedy venture, was inspirational on somebody's part.

Director [[Sidney Lumet]] offered Bergman the important part of Princess Dragomiroff, with which he felt she could win an Oscar. She insisted on playing the much smaller role of Greta Ohlsson, the old Swedish missionary. Lumet discussed Bergman's role:\n{{quote|She had chosen a very small part, and I couldn't persuade her to change her mind. She was sweetly stubborn. But stubborn she was ... Since her part was so small, I decided to film her one big scene, where she talks for almost five minutes, straight, all in one long take. A lot of actresses would have hesitated over that.

She acted in each of these languages at various times. Fellow actor Sir [[John Gielgud]], who had acted with her in ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'', and who had directed her in the play ''[[The Constant Wife]]'', playfully commented: \"She speaks five languages, and can't act in any of them.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2002/Aug-26-Mon-2002/news/19489130.html|title=The Punch Line|newspaper=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]|date=26 August 2002|accessdate=22 October 2006}}</ref> (This is from a [[Dorothy Parker]] quote which became a [[snowclone]], \"That woman speaks eighteen languages, and can't say 'No' in any of them.\")\n\nAlthough known chiefly as a film star, Bergman strongly admired the great English stage actors and their craft.

This was her final performance on the big screen. In the film, Bergman plays a celebrity pianist who travels to [[Norway]] to visit her neglected daughter, played by [[Liv Ullmann]]. The film was shot in Norway.

It was to be her final acting role and she was honored posthumously with a second [[Emmy Award]] for Best Actress. Her daughter Isabella described Bergman's surprise at being offered the part and the producer trying to explain to her, \"People believe you and trust you, and this is what I want, because Golda Meir had the trust of the people.\" Isabella adds, \"Now, ''that'' was interesting to Mother.\" She was also persuaded that Golda was a \"grand-scale person\", one that people would assume was much taller than she actually was.

The couple had one child, a daughter, [[Pia Lindstr\u00f6m|Friedel Pia Lindstr\u00f6m]] (born 20 September 1938). After returning to the United States in 1940, she acted on Broadway before continuing to do films in Hollywood. The following year, her husband arrived from Sweden with Pia. Lindstr\u00f6m stayed in [[Rochester, New York]], where he studied medicine and surgery at the [[University of Rochester]]. Bergman traveled to New York and stayed at their small rented stucco house between films, her visits lasting from a few days to four months. According to an article in ''Life'' magazine, the \"doctor regards himself as the undisputed head of the family, an idea that Ingrid accepts cheerfully\". He insisted she draw the line between her film and personal life, as he has a \"professional dislike for being associated with the tinseled glamor of Hollywood\". Lindstr\u00f6m later moved to [[San Francisco]], California, where he completed his internship at a private hospital, and they continued to spend time together when she could travel between filming.<ref name=LifeMag/>\n\nOn 27 August 1945, two days before her 30th birthday, as Ingrid Lindstrom, she and her husband both filed \"[[Declaration of Intention]]\" forms with the United States District Court, Southern District of California. <ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=https://ancestrylibrary.proquest.com/aleweb/ale/do/login|title=Ancestry Library Edition|website=Ancestrylibrary.proquest.com|accessdate=22 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nDuring her marriage with Lindstr\u00f6m, Bergman had a brief affair with ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' co-star [[Gregory Peck]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Haney|first=Lynn|title=''Gregory Peck: A Charmed Life''|url={{Google books|YGqLGiJl69oC|page=PT31|keywords=ingrid%20bergman%20gregory%20peck|text=|plainurl=yes}}|year=2009|isbn=9780786737819|publisher=De Capo Press}}</ref> Unlike her later affair with Rossellini, the affair with Peck was kept private until he confessed it to Brad Darrach of ''[[People (American magazine)|People]]'' in an interview five years after Bergman's death.

After her American film debut in the film ''[[Intermezzo (1939 film)|Intermezzo: A Love Story]]'' (1939), co-starring [[Leslie Howard]], Hollywood saw her as a unique actress who was completely natural in style and without need of make-up.

Swedish actress who starred in a variety of European and American films, television movies, and plays.<ref name=\"WVobit\">Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', 1 September 1982.</ref> She won [[List of awards and nominations received by Ingrid Bergman|many accolades]], including three [[Academy Awards]], two [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, a [[Tony Award]], four [[Golden Globe Award]]s, and a [[BAFTA Award]].\n\nBergman was born in [[Stockholm]] to a Swedish father and a German mother, and started her acting career in Swedish and German films. Her introduction to Americans came in the English-language remake of ''[[Intermezzo (1939 film)|Intermezzo]]'' (1939).  In addition to the classic and Best-Picture-Academy-Award winning ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942) opposite [[Humphrey Bogart]], her notable performances from the 1940s include the dramas ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' (1943), ''[[Gaslight (1944 film)|Gaslight]]'' (1944), ''[[The Bells of St. Mary's]]'' (1945), and ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'' (1948), all of which earned her nominations for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]; she won the award for ''Gaslight''. She made three films with [[Alfred Hitchcock]] including'' [[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), with [[Gregory Peck]], and ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946), opposite [[Cary Grant]].\n\nIn 1950, she starred in [[Roberto Rossellini]]'s ''[[Stromboli (film)|Stromboli]]'', following the revelation that she was having an extramarital affair with the director. The affair and then marriage to Rossellini created a scandal in the United States that forced her to remain in Europe for several years, during which she starred in Rossellini's ''[[Journey to Italy]]'' (1954), now critically acclaimed.  She made a successful return to working for a Hollywood studio in ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), the debut film for Yul Brynner, winning her second Academy Award for Best Actress. In 1958, she starred for a second time with Cary Grant, this time in the popular romantic comedy ''[[Indiscreet (1958 film)|Indiscreet]]''.\n\nIn her later years, she won her third Academy Award, this one for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]], for her small performance in ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'' (1974). In 1978, she worked with director [[Ingmar Bergman]] (no relation) in ''[[Autumn Sonata]]'', for which she received her sixth Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. In her final acting role, she portrayed the late-Israeli Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] in the television mini-series ''[[A Woman Called Golda]]'' (1982) for which she posthumously won her second [[Emmy Award]] for Best Actress. She died on her sixty-seventh birthday (29 August 1982) from breast cancer.\n\nAccording to the ''[[St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture]]'', Bergman quickly became \"the ideal of American womanhood\" and a contender for Hollywood's greatest leading actress.<ref name=James>{{cite book|first1=Tom|last1=Pendergast|first2=Sara|last2=Pendergast|title=St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture|publisher=[[Gale Publishing]]|location=Farmington Hills, Michigan|date=2000|isbn=1-55862-405-8|title-link=St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture}}</ref> In the United States, she is considered to have brought a \"Nordic freshness and vitality\" to the screen, along with exceptional beauty and intelligence; [[David O. Selznick]] once called her \"the most completely conscientious actress\" he had ever worked with. In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked Bergman as the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|fourth-greatest female screen legend]] of [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Classic Hollywood Cinema]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/stars.aspx|title=AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Stars|work=[[American Film Institute]]|accessdate=23 October 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020084914/http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/stars.aspx|archivedate=20 October 2006}}</ref>\n\n==Early years==\n[[File:Ingrid Bergman at age 14.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bergman at around the age of 16.

He wanted Ingrid to become an opera star and, during his lifetime, had her take voice lessons for three years. But she said she always \"knew from the beginning that she wanted to be an actress,\" sometimes wearing her mother's clothes and staging plays in her father's empty studio. Her father documented all her birthdays with a borrowed camera.<ref name=LifeMag/>\n[[File:Bergman first role.jpg|thumb|upright|Her first film, ''Munkbrogreven'' (1934), at age 19]]\nAfter her father's death, she was sent to live with his sister, Ellen Bergman, who died of heart disease only six months later. Ingrid then moved in with her Aunt Hulda and Uncle Otto, who had five children. She would also visit with another aunt, Elsa Adler, whom the young girl called \"Mutti,\" according to family legend.<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|294}}\n\nLater, Bergman received a scholarship to the state-sponsored [[Royal Dramatic Theatre School]], where [[Greta Garbo]] had some years earlier earned a similar scholarship. After several months, she was given a part in a new play, ''Ett Brott'' (''A Crime''), written by Sigfrid Siwertz. Chandler notes that this was \"totally against procedure\" at the school, where girls were expected to complete three years of study before getting such acting roles.<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|33}} During her first summer break, Bergman was hired by a Swedish film studio, which led to her leaving the Royal Dramatic Theatre after just one year, to work in films full-time. Her first film role after leaving the Royal Dramatic Theatre was a small part in ''[[Munkbrogreven]]'' (1935), although she reportedly had previously been an extra in the 1932 film ''Landskamp''). She went on to act in a dozen films in [[Sweden]], including ''[[Intermezzo]]'' (1936) which is graced by a leading performance by Ingrid Bergman (her first), in a role created especially for her, and ''[[En kvinnas ansikte]]'', which was later remade as ''[[A Woman's Face]]'' with [[Joan Crawford]], and one film in [[Germany]], ''Die vier Gesellen'' (''[[The Four Companions (film)|The Four Companions]]'') (1938).\n\n==Hollywood period: 1939\u20131949==\n===''Intermezzo: A Love Story'' (1939)===\nBergman's first acting role in the United States came when [[Hollywood]] producer [[David O. Selznick]] brought her to America to star in ''[[Intermezzo (1939 film)|Intermezzo: A Love Story]]'' (1939), an English language remake of her earlier Swedish film ''[[Intermezzo (1936 film)|Intermezzo]]'' (1936). Unable to speak English, and uncertain about her acceptance by the American audience, she expected to complete this one film and return home to Sweden. Her husband, Dr. Petter Aron Lindstr\u00f6m, remained in Sweden with their daughter Pia (born 1938).<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|63}} In ''Intermezzo'', she played the role of a young piano accompanist opposite [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] as a famous violin virtuoso. She arrived in [[Los Angeles]] on 6 May 1939, and stayed at the Selznick home until she could find another residence. According to Selznick's son Danny, who was a child at the time, his father had concerns about Ingrid: \"She didn't speak English, she was too tall, her name sounded too German, and her eyebrows were too thick.\"\n\nBergman was soon accepted without having to modify her looks or name, despite some early suggestions by Selznick.<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|6}} \"He let her have her way\", notes a story in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. Selznick understood her fear of Hollywood make-up artists, who might turn her into someone she wouldn't recognize, and \"instructed them to lay off\". He was also aware that her natural good looks would compete successfully with Hollywood's \"synthetic razzle-dazzle\".<ref name=LifeMag/> During the following weeks, while ''Intermezzo'' was being filmed, Selznick was also filming ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''. In a letter to William Hebert, his publicity director, Selznick described a few of his early impressions of Bergman:{{quote|Miss Bergman is the most completely conscientious actress with whom I have ever worked, in that she thinks of absolutely nothing but her work before and during the time she is doing a picture&nbsp;... She practically never leaves the studio, and even suggested that her dressing room be equipped so that she could live here during the picture. She never for a minute suggests quitting at six o'clock or anything of the kind&nbsp;... Because of having four stars acting in ''Gone with the Wind'', our star dressing-room suites were all occupied and we had to assign her a smaller suite. She went into ecstasies over it and said she had never had such a suite in her life&nbsp;... All of this is completely unaffected and completely unique and I should think would make a grand angle of approach to her publicity&nbsp;... so that her natural sweetness and consideration and conscientiousness become something of a legend&nbsp;... and is completely in keeping with the fresh and pure personality and appearance which caused me to sign her.<ref name=Selznick>Selznick, David O. ''Memo from David O. Selznick\", Selected and edited by [[Rudy Behlmer]], Viking Press (1972), in letter dated 22 June 1939</ref>{{rp|135\u2013136}}}}\n\n''Intermezzo'' became an enormous success and as a result Bergman became a star. The film's director, [[Gregory Ratoff]], said \"She is sensational\", as an actress. This was the \"sentiment of the entire set\", writes ''Life'', adding that workmen go out of their way to do things for her, and the cast and crew \"admired the quick, alert concentration she gave to direction and to her lines\".<ref name=LifeMag/> Film historian [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] notes that this became \"the start of an astonishing impact on Hollywood and America\", where her lack of make-up contributed to an \"air of nobility\". According to ''Life'', the impression that she left on Hollywood, after she returned to Sweden, was of a tall (5&nbsp;ft. 9 in.) girl \"with light brown hair and blue eyes who was painfully shy, but friendly, with a warm, straight, quick smile\".<ref name=LifeMag/> Selznick appreciated her uniqueness, and with his wife [[Irene Selznick|Irene]], they remained important friends throughout her career.<ref name=Thomson/>{{rp|76}}\n\n===''Casablanca'' (1942)===\n[[File:Casablanca, Trailer Screenshot.JPG|thumb|With Humphrey Bogart in ''Casablanca'']]\nAfter the onset of World War II, Bergman \"felt guilty because she had so misjudged the situation in Germany\" while she was there filming ''Die vier Gesellen'' (The Four Companions). According to one of her biographers, Charlotte Chandler (2007), she had at first considered the [[Nazi]]s only a \"temporary aberration, 'too foolish to be taken seriously'. She believed Germany would not start a war.\" Bergman felt that \"the good people there would not permit it\". Chandler adds, \"Ingrid felt guilty all the rest of her life because when she was in Germany at the end of the war, she had been afraid to go with the others to witness the atrocities of the [[Nazi concentration camp|Nazi extermination camps]]\".<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|293\u2013295}} In 1945, she and her first husband, Dr. Petter Aron Lindstr\u00f6m, who wed on 10 July 1937 in [[St\u00f6de]],<ref name=\"auto2\"/> became United States citizens.<ref name=\"auto2\"/><ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nAfter completing a final film in Sweden and appearing in three moderately successful films (''[[Adam Had Four Sons]]'', ''[[Rage in Heaven]]'', and ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1941 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'', all 1941) in the United States, Bergman co-starred with [[Humphrey Bogart]] in the classic film ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942), which remains her best-known role. In this film, she played the role of Ilsa, the beautiful Norwegian wife of Victor Laszlo, played by [[Paul Henreid]], an \"anti-Nazi underground hero\" who is in [[Casablanca]], a haven from the Nazis.<ref name=Chandler/> Bergman did not consider ''Casablanca'' to be one of her favorite performances. \"I made so many films which were more important, but the only one people ever want to talk about is that one with Bogart.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ingridbergman.com/|title=Ingrid Bergman - The Official Licensing Website of Ingrid Bergman|website=Ingrid Bergman|accessdate=22 February 2019}}</ref> In later years, she stated, \"I feel about ''Casablanca'' that it has a life of its own. There is something mystical about it. It seems to have filled a need, a need that was there before the film, a need that the film filled\".<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|88}}\n\n===''For Whom the Bell Tolls'' (1943)===\nAfter ''Casablanca'', with \"Selznick's steady boosting\", she played the part of Maria in ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' (1943), which was also her first color film. For the role, she received her first Academy Award nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. The film was taken from [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s novel of the [[For Whom the Bell Tolls|same title]] and co-starred [[Gary Cooper]]. When the book was sold to [[Paramount Pictures]], Hemingway stated that, \"Miss Bergman, and no one else, should play the part\". His opinion came from seeing her in her first American role, ''Intermezzo'', although he hadn't yet met her. A few weeks later, they did meet, and after studying her, he said, \"You ''are'' Maria!\".<ref name=LifeMag>Carlile, Thomas, and Speiser, Jean.

The film, according to Thomson, \"was the peak of her Hollywood glory\".<ref name=Thomson/>{{rp|77}} Bergman next played a nun in ''[[The Bells of St. Mary's]]'' (1945), opposite [[Bing Crosby]], for which she received her third consecutive nomination for Best Actress.\n\n===''Saratoga Trunk'' (1945)===\nBergman also starred in ''[[Saratoga Trunk]]'' (1945), though the film was originally shot in 1943 but not released until 1945.<ref name=\"Bogle\">{{citation|last=Bogle|first=Donald|title=Heat Wave: The Life and Career of Ethel Waters|authorlink=Donald Bogle|year=2011|isbn=978-0-06-124173-4|publisher=Harper-Collins|page=[https://archive.org/details/heatwavelifecare2011bogl/page/369 369]|url=https://archive.org/details/heatwavelifecare2011bogl/page/369}}</ref>\n\n===Hitchcock films===\nBergman starred in the [[Alfred Hitchcock]] films ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946), and ''[[Under Capricorn]]'' (1949). She was a student of the acting coach [[Michael Chekhov]] during the 1940s.

Ledger|accessdate=6 March 2007}}</ref>\n\n===''Joan of Arc'' (1948)===\nBergman received another Best Actress nomination for ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'' (1948), an independent film based on the Maxwell Anderson play ''[[Joan of Lorraine]]'', produced by [[Walter Wanger]], and initially released through [[RKO]]. Bergman had championed the role since her arrival in Hollywood, which was one of the reasons she had played it on the Broadway stage in Anderson's play. The film was not a big hit with the public, partly because of the scandal of Bergman's affair with [[Italian people|Italian]] film director [[Roberto Rossellini]], which broke while the film was still in theatres. Even worse, it received disastrous reviews, and, although nominated for several Academy Awards, did not receive a Best Picture nomination. It was subsequently cut by 45 minutes, but restored to full length in 1998, and released in 2004 on [[DVD]].\n\nBetween motion pictures, Bergman had appeared in the stage plays ''[[Liliom]]'', ''[[Anna Christie]]'', and ''Joan of Lorraine''. During a press conference in [[Washington, D.C.]] for the promotion of ''Joan of Lorraine'', she protested against [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] after seeing it first hand at the theater she was acting in. This led to a lot of publicity and some hate mail. Bergman went to [[Alaska]] during World War II to entertain [[US Army]] troops. Soon after the war ended, she also went to [[Europe]] for the same purpose, where she was able to see the devastation caused by the war. {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n==Italian period with Rossellini: 1949\u20131957==\n[[File:Ingrid Bergman - 1954.JPG|thumb|left|In ''Fear'' (1954)]]\nBergman strongly admired two films by Italian [[Film director|director]] [[Roberto Rossellini]] that she had seen in the United States. In 1949, Bergman wrote to Rossellini, expressing this admiration and suggesting that she make a film with him. This led to her being cast in his film ''[[Stromboli (film)|Stromboli]]'' (1950). During production, Bergman fell in love with Rossellini, they began an affair, and Bergman became pregnant with their son, Renato Roberto Ranaldo Giusto Giuseppe (\"Robin\") Rossellini (born 2 February 1950).<ref name=Bondanella>Bondanella, Peter E. ''The Films of Robert Rossellini\", Cambridge University Press (1993)</ref>{{rp|18}}\n\nThis affair caused a huge scandal in the United States, where it led to Bergman being denounced on the floor of the [[United States Senate]]. [[Ed Sullivan]] chose not to have her on his show, despite a poll indicating that the public wanted her to appear.<ref name=Sullivan>{{Cite web|title=Steve Allen: The Mike Wallace Interview|url=http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/multimedia/video/2008/wallace/allen_steve_t.html|website = Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas at Austin|accessdate=5 November 2015|date=7 July 1957}}</ref> However, [[Steve Allen]], whose show was equally popular, did have her as a guest, later explaining \"the danger of trying to judge artistic activity through the prism of one's personal life\".<ref name=Sullivan/> Spoto notes that Bergman had, by virtue of her roles and screen persona, placed herself \"above all that\". She had played a nun in ''[[The Bells of St. Mary's]]'' (1945), and a virgin saint in ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'' (1948). Bergman later said, \"People saw me in ''Joan of Arc'', and declared me a saint. I'm not. I'm just a woman, another human being.\"<ref name=Spoto>Spoto, Donald.

Lindstr\u00f6m stayed in [[Rochester, New York]], where he studied medicine and surgery at the [[University of Rochester]]. Bergman traveled to New York and stayed at their small rented stucco house between films, her visits lasting from a few days to four months. According to an article in ''Life'' magazine, the \"doctor regards himself as the undisputed head of the family, an idea that Ingrid accepts cheerfully\". He insisted she draw the line between her film and personal life, as he has a \"professional dislike for being associated with the tinseled glamor of Hollywood\".

As a result, Barney is caught between siding with his mother and brother or Robin (who defeats Loretta in a round of [[strip poker]] and gets her special blouse).

This prompts Barney to declare that he's severing his ties to James and Loretta after realizing that they're both selfish, but claims Robin ordered it so.\n\nLily is visibly displeased at Ted's plans to give Barney and Robin three wedding gifts.

When Ted is questioned about the present, he insists that he sent them a [[coffeemaker]] as his gift but also dropped his own hints for Marshall to acknowledge it. Lily discovers that Ted never got a thank-you note because Stuart passed it off as his present; he claims the item further strengthened his marriage to Claudia. Ted reconciles with Marshall by placing an order with their old [[Chicago]] pizza haunt ''[[Duel Citizenship|Gazzola's]]'' and having a delivery man send it to Marshall as he and Daphne pass through Chicago.

For example: John said: \"I saw Mary today\". Quotations in oral speech may also be introduced using special [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]]. In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French |url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2014). On indirect reports and language games: Evidence from Persian. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 8(2), 26-42.</ref><ref>Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2015). The secret life of slurs from the perspective of reported speech. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common quotation sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.

They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other interlocutors. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example: while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example: two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said.

Thus, Japanese fails to distinguish between direct and indirect speech as shown in the above examples.\n<ref name=\"Coulmas p164\"/>\n\n===Syntax of quotation===\n====Nested quotations====\n====Crosslinguisic variations====\n=====Quotative verbs=====\n\n=====Quotative particles=====\nQuotative or hearsay particles are markers equivalent to full verbs with meanings ''say, speak, mention, tell, etc.''\n<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5-25 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty.

Richard plays staccato eighth notes while Palmer plays a fast [[shuffle note|shuffle]]. The shuffle was the most common rhythm and blues beat; Richard added the eighth notes, much less common in that time, although now standard for rock music. Together this created an ambiguity in the ride rhythm\u2014known to musicians as \"playing in the crack\" that came to characterize New Orleans rock and roll.

Although this meant an unexpected cash income for the Specialty publishing firm, [[artists and repertoire|A&R]] man and producer \"Bumps\" Blackwell and a proud Richard decided to write a song that was so up-tempo and the lyrics so fast that Boone would not be able to handle it (Boone eventually did record his own version, however, getting it to No. 18<ref>{{cite web |url=https://top40weekly.com/1956-all-charts/ |title=All US Top 40 Singles for 1956 |publisher=Top40Weekly.com |accessdate=January 7, 2019}}</ref>).<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/>\n\nAccording to Blackwell, he was introduced to a little girl by Honey Chile, a popular [[disc-jockey]].

The song, actually a few lines on a piece of paper, went like this:\n{{poemquote|\nSaw Uncle John with Long Tall Sally\nThey saw Aunt Mary comin'\nSo they ducked back in the alley}}\n\nNot wishing to upset an influential disc-jockey, Blackwell accepted the offer and took the idea to Richard, who was reluctant at first.

Richard plays staccato eighth notes while Palmer plays a fast [[shuffle note|shuffle]]. The shuffle was the most common rhythm and blues beat; Richard added the eighth notes, much less common in that time, although now standard for rock music. Together this created an ambiguity in the ride rhythm\u2014known to musicians as \"playing in the crack\" that came to characterize New Orleans rock and roll.
