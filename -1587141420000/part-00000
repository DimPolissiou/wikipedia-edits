They are the first installments in the eighth generation of the [[Pok\u00e9mon (video game series)|''Pok\u00e9mon'' video game series]] and the second in the series, after [[Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!|''Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu!'' and ''Let's Go, Eevee!'']], to be released on a [[home game console]]. Originally teased at [[E3 2017]] and announced in February 2019, ''Pok\u00e9mon Sword'' and ''Shield'' were released on November 15, 2019.\n\n''Sword'' and ''Shield''{{'s}} concept planning began immediately following the completion of [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon'']] in 2016, while full production began a year later in September 2017. Like previous installments, they chronicle the journey of a young Pok\u00e9mon trainer aiming to become the Pok\u00e9mon Champion, this time in the new Galar region, which is based on the [[United Kingdom]]. The main objective of the games is to dethrone the Pok\u00e9mon League Champion, Leon, in a tournament that various other Gym Leaders and rivals also take part in, whilst dealing with Team Yell and a nefarious conspiracy within the League. ''Sword'' and ''Shield'' introduce [[List of generation VIII Pok\u00e9mon|81 new Pok\u00e9mon]] alongside [[List of generation VIII Pok\u00e9mon#Galarian Forms|13 regional variants]] of pre-existing Pok\u00e9mon; Dynamaxing, which increases the size of Pok\u00e9mon under certain conditions; Gigantamaxing, which additionally changes the form of certain Pok\u00e9mon; and the Wild Area, which is a large, open-world area with free camera movement that contains co-op raid battles. The two games also reintroduce features previously seen in ''Sun'' and ''Moon'' and ''Let's Go, Pikachu!'' and ''Let's Go, Eevee!'', such as regional variants and roaming Pok\u00e9mon depicted in the overworld. The games will receive two [[expansion pack]]s in 2020, ''The Isle of Armor'' and ''The Crown Tundra''.\n\nThe decision to not include all pre-existing Pok\u00e9mon in ''Sword'' and ''Shield'' was met with backlash from a segment of the fan community, resulting in trends such as \"Dexit\" and \"Bring Back National Dex\" and calls for a [[boycott]] months ahead of their release. Despite this, ''Sword'' and ''Shield'' received generally positive reviews from critics. Particular praise was aimed at the creature design, new features, and the emphasis on simplicity, player freedom, and streamlined encounters, although some criticized the game's smaller Pok\u00e9dex and a perceived lack of polish or depth. By the end of 2019, ''Sword'' and ''Shield'' had sold more than sixteen million copies worldwide, becoming the fastest-selling games on the Switch. \n\n==Gameplay==\n{{see also|Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon}}\n''Pok\u00e9mon Sword'' and ''Shield'' are [[role-playing video game]]s with [[adventure game|adventure]] elements,<ref name=\"introduction\">{{cite web |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/pokemon-sword-shield-release-date-trailer-details-2019-2 |title=Everything we know about 'Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield,' the newly released Pok\u00e9mon games for Nintendo Switch |last=Webb |first=Kevin |work=[[Business Insider]] |date=November 15, 2019 |accessdate=March 14, 2020}}</ref> and in most cases it is presented in a [[Virtual camera system#Fixed|fixed camera]], [[third-person (video games)|third-person]] perspective; in certain instances [[Virtual camera system#Interactive|free camera movement]] is available.<ref name=\"introduction\"/> The player controls a young trainer who goes on a quest to catch and train creatures known as Pok\u00e9mon, and win [[Pok\u00e9mon battle|battles]] against other trainers. By defeating opposing Pok\u00e9mon in turn-based battles, the player's Pok\u00e9mon gains [[experience points|experience]], allowing them to level up and increase their battle statistics, learn new battle techniques, and in some cases, [[Pok\u00e9mon evolution|evolve]] into more powerful Pok\u00e9mon. Players can capture wild Pok\u00e9mon, found during wild encounters, by weakening them in battle and catching them with [[Pok\u00e9 Ball]]s, allowing them to be added to their [[party (role-playing games)|party]]. Players are also able to battle and [[Pok\u00e9mon trading|trade]] Pok\u00e9mon with other human players using the Nintendo Switch connectivity features. As with previous games in the series, certain Pok\u00e9mon are only obtainable in either ''Sword'' or ''Shield'', with players encouraged to trade with others in order to obtain all Pok\u00e9mon from both versions.<ref name=\"introduction\"/>\n\n''Sword'' and ''Shield'' takes place in the Galar region, based on the [[United Kingdom]]. As with all regions, Galar consists of a number of cities and towns connected by \"Routes\"; however, there is also an [[open world]] area in the center of the region known as the \"Wild Area\", a concept new to the series. [[Random encounter]]s with wild Pok\u00e9mon may take place in tall grass or in bodies of water along routes or in the Wild Area. Wild Pok\u00e9mon may also be encountered outside of tall grass and elsewhere in the environment, and may chase or run away from the player depending on their disposition. The player occasionally battles Trainers in cities, towns, along routes, and in the Wild Area. The driving force bringing the player to travel around the Galar region is to take part in the \"Gym Challenge\", an open-tournament to decide the greatest Pok\u00e9mon Trainer in the region, dubbed the Champion. Eight of the game's cities and towns are homes to stadiums housing \"Gym Leaders\", powerful Trainers specializing in certain types of Pok\u00e9mon; beating a Gym Leader gives the player a \"Badge\".<ref name=\"introduction\"/> After attaining eight Badges the player will be able to take part in the \"Champion Cup\", where they will face off in a [[single-elimination tournament]] against the previously faced Gym Leaders and other Trainers remaining in the Gym Challenge. After emerging victorious the player will face the Champion of the Galar region.<ref name=\"introduction\"/>\n\n===New features===\n{{see also|List of generation VIII Pok\u00e9mon}}\n[[File:Pokemon Sword and Shield Max Raid.jpg|thumb|Here, the player and three [[Non-player character|NPCs]] work together to take down a Dynamaxed Pok\u00e9mon|alt=]]\nSeveral new features for the games are also firsts for the series, including cooperative [[raid (video gaming)|raid]] encounters, akin to those seen in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Go]]''; the Wild Area, a fully explorable [[open world]] area with free camera movement and dynamic weather, which has implications on which Pok\u00e9mon species appear at a given time;<ref name=\"Wild Area\">{{cite web|publisher=The Pok\u00e9mon Company|year=2019|accessdate=July 14, 2019|title=Check Out the Natural Beauty of the Wild Area|url=https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/gameplay/wild-area/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190708173055/https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/gameplay/wild-area/|archive-date=July 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> and \"Dynamaxing\" and \"Gigantamaxing\", both of which temporarily allow Pok\u00e9mon to grow to larger sizes.<ref name=kotaku-june5>{{cite web |url=https://kotaku.com/pokemon-sword-and-shield-will-have-co-op-raids-and-eve-1835266586 |title=Pok\u00e9mon Sword And Shield Will Have Co-Op Raids (And Everything Else We Learned Today) |website=[[Kotaku]] |date=June 5, 2019 |access-date=June 6, 2019 |first=Gita |last=Jackson |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190605222216/https://kotaku.com/pokemon-sword-and-shield-will-have-co-op-raids-and-eve-1835266586 |archive-date=June 5, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-sword-and-shield-reveal-more-new-gen-8-pok/1100-6467390/ |title=Pokemon Sword And Shield Reveal More New Gen 8 Pokemon |website=[[Gamespot]] |date=June 6, 2019 |access-date=June 6, 2019 |first=Kevin |last=Knezevic |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190606151943/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-sword-and-shield-reveal-more-new-gen-8-pok/1100-6467390/ |archive-date=June 6, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Gigantamaxing is limited to select Pok\u00e9mon and feature different forms from the Pok\u00e9mon's normal appearance.<ref name=\"TV_0708\"/> A new mechanic called \"Pok\u00e9 Jobs\" tasks the player's Pok\u00e9mon with completing requests, such as assisting in construction or cooking, to gain experience or rare items.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=The Pok\u00e9mon Company|date=August 7, 2019|accessdate=August 7, 2019|series=''Pok\u00e9mon Sword'' and ''Shield'' Gameplay|title=Pok\u00e9 Jobs|url=https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/gameplay/pokejobs/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190807153659/https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/gameplay/pokejobs/|archive-date=August 7, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In addition, Pok\u00e9mon native to the game's region can be transferred to the games from the [[Nintendo 3DS]] app ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Bank]]'', ''Pok\u00e9mon Go'', and [[Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu!

The player and their best friend, Hop, receive one of three [[starter Pok\u00e9mon]]: Grookey, Scorbunny, or Sobble from Leon, Champion of the Galar region and Hop's older brother. Afterward, the two explore a forest called the Slumbering Weald but are driven off by a powerful Pok\u00e9mon. During their subsequent visit to the region's Pok\u00e9mon Professor, Magnolia, they convince Leon to endorse them to take part in the Gym Challenge. After traveling to the next city to register for the Gym Challenge, they encounter rivals Bede and Marnie along with Team Yell, a devout group of hooligans who act as Marnie's unintentional fanbase and are determined to stop anyone else from completing the Challenge.\n\n[[File:Westminster (59295502).jpeg|left|thumb|The Galar region was heavily inspired by the United Kingdom, with the main city\u2014Wyndon\u2014being a representation of [[London]] (pictured). The in-game city has the Rose of the Rondelands, a building inspired by the [[Houses of Parliament]].|alt=]]\nAs their quest continues, the player and Hop learn about two Legendary Pok\u00e9mon who saved Galar from an ancient crisis called the Darkest Day and deduce that they are the same Pok\u00e9mon they encountered in the Slumbering Weald. After beating the 8 Gym Leaders, including the leader of Team Yell, the player makes their way to Wyndon where they compete in the Champion's Cup for the opportunity to fight Leon. After winning the tournament, the player and Leon agree to have their battle the next day and decide to go have dinner together with Hop. They meet at the hotel, but Leon doesn't show up. The player and Hop find him discussing something with Chairman Rose. The next day, before the battle between the player and Leon can commence, Chairman Rose awakens the Pok\u00e9mon Eternatus in an attempt to harness its power to provide energy to Galar, triggering a second Darkest Day. The player and Hop return to the Slumbering Weald and secure the aid of the legendary Pok\u00e9mon, Zacian and Zamazenta, to defeat Chairman Rose and Eternatus, after which the player catches Eternatus. The player then faces and defeats Leon in a battle and becomes the new Champion of the Galar region.\n\nAfter defeating Leon, the player and Hop return to the Slumbering Weald to return Zacian and Zamazenta's artifacts to their rightful place. However, they are confronted by Sordward and Shielbert, two brothers claiming to be descendants of ancient Galarian kings. The two steal one of the relics and begin forcing innocent Pok\u00e9mon to Dynamax. The player and Hop work with the Gym Leaders to subdue the Dynamax Pok\u00e9mon and then track down and confront the brothers. They use Dynamax energy to drive Zamazenta (in ''Sword'') or Zacian (in ''Shield'') berserk, and the player drives them off with the help of Zacian (in ''Sword'') or Zamazenta (in ''Shield''). They then are challenged to a battle by the Legendary Pok\u00e9mon and allowed to catch it, while Hop follows Zamazenta/Zacian back to the Slumbering Weald and calms it down, being chosen by it as its Trainer. The player and Hop have a final battle, after which Hop decides to become a Pok\u00e9mon Professor.\n\n==Development==\n{{see also|List of generation VIII Pok\u00e9mon#Design and development}}\nDevelopment of ''Pok\u00e9mon Sword'' and ''Shield'' began immediately following the development of ''Sun'' and ''Moon'' in autumn 2016. Shigeru Ohmori, who previosuly directed Sun and Moon, formed a team who begun thinking about ideas for the title. Kazumasa Iwao, director of [[Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon]] later joined the project as planning director and full production started in September 2017. One of the first ideas the team had was making Pok\u00e9mon giant because you now could play Pok\u00e9mon in the TV in a big screen, so then Ohmori thought about having a sword and a shield Pok\u00e9mon to defeat the giant Pok\u00e9mon; that's how the games titles were decided.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamefreak.co.jp/recruit/projectstory-pokemon/|title=\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc1\uff5c\u63a1\u7528\u60c5\u5831\uff5cGAME FREAK \u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30af|website=\u63a1\u7528\u60c5\u5831\uff5cGAME FREAK \u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30af|language=ja|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref><ref name=\"pokemon.com2019-06-13\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/we-interview-junichi-masuda-and-shigeru-ohmori-about-pokemon-sword-and-pokemon-shield/ |title=We Interview Junichi Masuda and Shigeru Ohmori about Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Pok\u00e9mon Shield |publisher=The Pok\u00e9mon Company |date=June 13, 2019 |access-date=June 16, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190616081647/https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/we-interview-junichi-masuda-and-shigeru-ohmori-about-pokemon-sword-and-pokemon-shield/ |archive-date=June 16, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nApproximately 1,000&nbsp;people from multiple companies were involved in the development, marketing, and public relations associated with ''Sword'' and ''Shield''.

potential.\n\nBrian Shea from ''[[Game Informer]]'' particularly praised the new Dynamax feature for being visually and strategically exciting without being overused: \"while the Dynamax mechanic has the potential to disrupt the flow of any battle, it doesn't factor into most encounters, since it can only be used in Gym battles and select other situations\".<ref name=\"GameInformer\" /> Casey

complicated back-end systems or hoops to jump through; from the outset, you can start wandering the Galar region, seeing its new Pok\u00e9mon, and trying out its new battle strategies with very little in your way.\"\n\nConversely, Chris Tapsell for ''[[Eurogamer]]'' criticized the games, commenting that it lacked substance and did not live up to previous titles in the series. Tapsell commented \"this is a new generation of ''Pok\u00e9mon'' games that promises much, with brilliant new Pok\u00e9mon, a raft of intricate system-tinkering for long-term fans and a series-first stab at an 'open-world' area.

They are the first installments in the eighth generation of the [[Pok\u00e9mon (video game series)|''Pok\u00e9mon'' video game series]] and the second in the series, after [[Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!|''Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu!'' and ''Let's Go, Eevee!'']], to be released on a [[home game console]]. Originally teased at [[E3 2017]] and announced in February 2019, ''Pok\u00e9mon Sword'' and ''Shield'' were released on November 15, 2019.\n\n''Sword'' and ''Shield''{{'s}} concept planning began immediately following the completion of [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon'']] in 2016, while full production began a year later in September 2017. Like previous installments, they chronicle the journey of a young Pok\u00e9mon trainer aiming to become the Pok\u00e9mon Champion, this time in the new Galar region, which is based on the [[United Kingdom]]. The main objective of the games is to dethrone the Pok\u00e9mon League Champion, Leon, in a tournament that various other Gym Leaders and rivals also take part in, whilst dealing with Team Yell and a nefarious conspiracy within the League. ''Sword'' and ''Shield'' introduce [[List of generation VIII Pok\u00e9mon|81 new Pok\u00e9mon]] alongside [[List of generation VIII Pok\u00e9mon#Galarian Forms|13 regional variants]] of pre-existing Pok\u00e9mon; Dynamaxing, which increases the size of Pok\u00e9mon under certain conditions; Gigantamaxing, which additionally changes the form of certain Pok\u00e9mon; and the Wild Area, which is a large, open-world area with free camera movement that contains co-op raid battles. The two games also reintroduce features previously seen in ''Sun'' and ''Moon'' and ''Let's Go, Pikachu!'' and ''Let's Go, Eevee!'', such as regional variants and roaming Pok\u00e9mon depicted in the overworld. The games will receive two [[expansion pack]]s in 2020, ''The Isle of Armor'' and ''The Crown Tundra''.\n\nThe decision to not include all pre-existing Pok\u00e9mon in ''Sword'' and ''Shield'' was met with backlash from a segment of the fan community, resulting in trends such as \"Dexit\" and \"Bring Back National Dex\" and calls for a [[boycott]] months ahead of their release. Despite this, ''Sword'' and ''Shield'' received generally positive reviews from critics. Particular praise was aimed at the creature design, new features, and the emphasis on simplicity, player freedom, and streamlined encounters, although some criticized the game's smaller Pok\u00e9dex and a perceived lack of polish or depth. By the end of 2019, ''Sword'' and ''Shield'' had sold more than sixteen million copies worldwide, becoming the fastest-selling games on the Switch. \n\n==Gameplay==\n{{see also|Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon}}\n''Pok\u00e9mon Sword'' and ''Shield'' are [[role-playing video game]]s with [[adventure game|adventure]] elements,<ref name=\"introduction\">{{cite web |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/pokemon-sword-shield-release-date-trailer-details-2019-2 |title=Everything we know about 'Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield,' the newly released Pok\u00e9mon games for Nintendo Switch |last=Webb |first=Kevin |work=[[Business Insider]] |date=November 15, 2019 |accessdate=March 14, 2020}}</ref> and in most cases it is presented in a [[Virtual camera system#Fixed|fixed camera]], [[third-person (video games)|third-person]] perspective; in certain instances [[Virtual camera system#Interactive|free camera movement]] is available.<ref name=\"introduction\"/> The player controls a young trainer who goes on a quest to catch and train creatures known as Pok\u00e9mon, and win [[Pok\u00e9mon battle|battles]] against other trainers. By defeating opposing Pok\u00e9mon in turn-based battles, the player's Pok\u00e9mon gains [[experience points|experience]], allowing them to level up and increase their battle statistics, learn new battle techniques, and in some cases, [[Pok\u00e9mon evolution|evolve]] into more powerful Pok\u00e9mon. Players can capture wild Pok\u00e9mon, found during wild encounters, by weakening them in battle and catching them with [[Pok\u00e9 Ball]]s, allowing them to be added to their [[party (role-playing games)|party]]. Players are also able to battle and [[Pok\u00e9mon trading|trade]] Pok\u00e9mon with other human players using the Nintendo Switch connectivity features. As with previous games in the series, certain Pok\u00e9mon are only obtainable in either ''Sword'' or ''Shield'', with players encouraged to trade with others in order to obtain all Pok\u00e9mon from both versions.<ref name=\"introduction\"/>\n\n''Sword'' and ''Shield'' takes place in the Galar region, based on the [[United Kingdom]]. As with all regions, Galar consists of a number of cities and towns connected by \"Routes\"; however, there is also an [[open world]] area in the center of the region known as the \"Wild Area\", a concept new to the series. [[Random encounter]]s with wild Pok\u00e9mon may take place in tall grass or in bodies of water along routes or in the Wild Area. Wild Pok\u00e9mon may also be encountered outside of tall grass and elsewhere in the environment, and may chase or run away from the player depending on their disposition. The player occasionally battles Trainers in cities, towns, along routes, and in the Wild Area. The driving force bringing the player to travel around the Galar region is to take part in the \"Gym Challenge\", an open-tournament to decide the greatest Pok\u00e9mon Trainer in the region, dubbed the Champion. Eight of the game's cities and towns are homes to stadiums housing \"Gym Leaders\", powerful Trainers specializing in certain types of Pok\u00e9mon; beating a Gym Leader gives the player a \"Badge\".<ref name=\"introduction\"/> After attaining eight Badges the player will be able to take part in the \"Champion Cup\", where they will face off in a [[single-elimination tournament]] against the previously faced Gym Leaders and other Trainers remaining in the Gym Challenge.

The player and their best friend, Hop, receive one of three [[starter Pok\u00e9mon]]: Grookey, Scorbunny, or Sobble from Leon, Champion of the Galar region and Hop's older brother. Afterward, the two explore a forest called the Slumbering Weald but are driven off by a powerful Pok\u00e9mon. During their subsequent visit to the region's Pok\u00e9mon Professor, Magnolia, they convince Leon to endorse them to take part in the Gym Challenge. After traveling to the next city to register for the Gym Challenge, they encounter rivals Bede and Marnie along with Team Yell, a devout group of hooligans who act as Marnie's unintentional fanbase and are determined to stop anyone else from completing the Challenge.\n\n[[File:Westminster (59295502).jpeg|left|thumb|The Galar region was heavily inspired by the United Kingdom, with the main city\u2014Wyndon\u2014being a representation of [[London]] (pictured). The in-game city has the Rose of the Rondelands, a building inspired by the [[Houses of Parliament]].|alt=]]\nAs their quest continues, the player and Hop learn about two Legendary Pok\u00e9mon who saved Galar from an ancient crisis called the Darkest Day and deduce that they are the same Pok\u00e9mon they encountered in the Slumbering Weald. After beating the 8 Gym Leaders, including the leader of Team Yell, the player makes their way to Wyndon where they compete in the Champion's Cup for the opportunity to fight Leon. After winning the tournament, the player and Leon agree to have their battle the next day and decide to go have dinner together with Hop. They meet at the hotel, but Leon doesn't show up. The player and Hop find him discussing something with Chairman Rose. The next day, before the battle between the player and Leon can commence, Chairman Rose awakens the Pok\u00e9mon Eternatus in an attempt to harness its power to provide energy to Galar, triggering a second Darkest Day. The player and Hop return to the Slumbering Weald and secure the aid of the legendary Pok\u00e9mon, Zacian and Zamazenta, to defeat Chairman Rose and Eternatus, after which the player catches Eternatus. The player then faces and defeats Leon in a battle and becomes the new Champion of the Galar region.\n\nAfter defeating Leon, the player and Hop return to the Slumbering Weald to return Zacian and Zamazenta's artifacts to their rightful place. However, they are confronted by Sordward and Shielbert, two brothers claiming to be descendants of ancient Galarian kings. The two steal one of the relics and begin forcing innocent Pok\u00e9mon to Dynamax. The player and Hop work with the Gym Leaders to subdue the Dynamax Pok\u00e9mon and then track down and confront the brothers. They use Dynamax energy to drive Zamazenta (in ''Sword'') or Zacian (in ''Shield'') berserk, and the player drives them off with the help of Zacian (in ''Sword'') or Zamazenta (in ''Shield''). They then are challenged to a battle by the Legendary Pok\u00e9mon and allowed to catch it, while Hop follows Zamazenta/Zacian back to the Slumbering Weald and calms it down, being chosen by it as its Trainer. The player and Hop have a final battle, after which Hop decides to become a Pok\u00e9mon Professor.\n\n==Development==\n{{see also|List of generation VIII Pok\u00e9mon#Design and development}}\nDevelopment of ''Pok\u00e9mon Sword'' and ''Shield'' began immediately following the development of ''Sun'' and ''Moon'' in autumn 2016. Shigeru Ohmori, who previosuly directed Sun and Moon, formed a team who begun thinking about ideas for the title. Kazumasa Iwao, director of [[Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon]] later joined the project as planning director and full production started in September 2017. One of the first ideas the team had was making Pok\u00e9mon giant because you now could play Pok\u00e9mon in the TV in a big screen, so then Ohmori thought about having a sword and a shield Pok\u00e9mon to defeat the giant Pok\u00e9mon; that's how the games titles were decided.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamefreak.co.jp/recruit/projectstory-pokemon/|title=\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc1\uff5c\u63a1\u7528\u60c5\u5831\uff5cGAME FREAK \u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30af|website=\u63a1\u7528\u60c5\u5831\uff5cGAME FREAK \u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30af|language=ja|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref><ref name=\"pokemon.com2019-06-13\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/we-interview-junichi-masuda-and-shigeru-ohmori-about-pokemon-sword-and-pokemon-shield/ |title=We Interview Junichi Masuda and Shigeru Ohmori about Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Pok\u00e9mon Shield |publisher=The Pok\u00e9mon Company |date=June 13, 2019 |access-date=June 16, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190616081647/https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/we-interview-junichi-masuda-and-shigeru-ohmori-about-pokemon-sword-and-pokemon-shield/ |archive-date=June 16, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nApproximately 1,000&nbsp;people from multiple companies were involved in the development, marketing, and public relations associated with ''Sword'' and ''Shield''.

''Pok\u00e9mon Sword'' and ''Pok\u00e9mon Shield'' received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].<ref name=\"MetaSword\" /><ref name=\"MetaShield\" /> Critics praised the games' simplicity, new elements such as Dynamaxing, and streamlined battle encounters but criticized the incomplete Pok\u00e9dex and not taking full advantage of the games' potential.\n\nBrian Shea from ''[[Game Informer]]'' particularly praised the new Dynamax feature for being visually and strategically exciting without being overused: \"while the Dynamax mechanic has the potential to disrupt the flow of any battle, it doesn't factor into most encounters, since it can only be used in Gym battles and select other situations\".<ref name=\"GameInformer\" /> Casey DeFreitas for ''[[IGN]]'' also praised ''Sword'' and ''Shield'' for their fun gameplay and lack of monotonous activities, while criticizing aspects such as cutscenes and lack of a full Pok\u00e9dex.<ref name=\"IGN\" /> Writing for ''[[GameSpot]]'', Kallie Plagge also praised the pair for easy-to-understand game systems and a sense of freedom stating, \"you're not held back by overly complicated back-end systems or hoops to jump through; from the outset, you can start wandering the Galar region, seeing its new Pok\u00e9mon, and trying out its new battle strategies with very little in your way.\"\n\nConversely, Chris Tapsell for ''[[Eurogamer]]'' criticized the games, commenting that it lacked substance and did not live up to previous titles in the series. Tapsell commented \"this is a new generation of ''Pok\u00e9mon'' games that promises much, with brilliant new Pok\u00e9mon, a raft of intricate system-tinkering for long-term fans and a series-first stab at an 'open-world' area. But all that's new seems to have come at a cost \u2013 and the cost is almost everything else in the game.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tapsell |first1=Chris |title=Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield review \u2013 a shadow of a former great |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-13-pokemon-sword-and-shield-review-a-shadow-of-a-former-great |website=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=November 13, 2019 |date=November 13, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191113142048/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-13-pokemon-sword-and-shield-review-a-shadow-of-a-former-great |archive-date=November 13, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> James Grebey and Tom Philip of ''[[GQ]]'' also felt somewhat underwhelmed, praising the Wild Area but stating that the games were \"satisfying but pedestrian\" and feel like \"proof of concept [with] another stage of evolution left for console ''Pok\u00e9mon'' games\".

Meanwhile, the Kishiryu were placed in a deep sleep as a failsafe should the Druidon return. The chosen knights choose to live in peace while passing their mantle down across generations.

He came to the service of his country by working on the ''Director Project'' at Bell Labs  <ref name=\"Mindell\">Mindell, David A., \"Automation's Finest Hour: Bell Labs and Automatic Control in World War II\", [[IEEE]] Control Systems, December 1995, pp. 72-80.</ref> (funded by [[National Defense Research Committee]] (NDRC) Section D-2), developing automatic [[anti-aircraft]] control systems,  whereby [[radar]] information was used to provide data about the location of the enemy aircraft, which was then fed back to the anti-aircraft artillery [[servomechanism]]s  enabling automatic, radar-augmented enemy aircraft [[ballistics|ballistic]] tracking,<ref name=\"servos\">{{cite web|url=http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/mithistory/histories-offices/servo.html |title=History of the MIT Servomechanisms Laboratory |accessdate=2006-02-08 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311162855/http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/mithistory/histories-offices/servo.html |archivedate=March 11, 2010 |df=mdy-all }} from MIT Institute Archives and Special Collections</ref> in other words,  automatic shooting down of enemy aircraft with the help of radar.

Its function required to process data that was wirelessly transmitted to its sensors and make a decision based on the data received using its onboard computer about its output defined as its angular position and the timing of its firing mechanism. In  this model we can see all the elements of later concepts such as [[data processing]], [[automation]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[cybernetics]], [[robotics]] etc.\n\n===Working on Director Studies===\nBode, in addition, applied  his extensive skills with feedback amplifiers to design the target data smoothing and position  predictor networks of an improved model of Director T-10, called the ''Director T-15''. The work on Director T-15 was undertaken under a new project at Bell Labs called ''Fundamental Director Studies'' in cooperation with the NDRC under the directorship of Walter McNair.<ref name=\"Mindell\"/>\n\nNDRC, the funding agency of this project, was operating under the aegis of the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] ([[OSRD]]).<ref name=\"osrd\">{{cite web|url=http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/WW2Timeline/OSRD.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-02-22 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520212523/http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/WW2Timeline/OSRD.html |archivedate=May 20, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nHis NDRC-funded research at Bell Labs under the section D-2 (Control Systems section) contract eventually led to other important developments in related fields and laid the cornerstone for many present-day inventions.  In the field of [[control theory]], for example, it  aided in the further development of servomechanism design and control, a crucial component of modern [[robotics]]. The development of Wireless Data Communications theory by Bode led to later inventions such as mobile phones and [[wireless networking]].\n\nThe reason for the new project was that Director T-10 encountered difficulties in calculating the target velocity by differentiating the target position. Due to [[discontinuity (mathematics)|discontinuities]], variations and noise in the radar signal, the position [[derivative]]s sometimes fluctuated wildly and this caused erratic motion in the servomechanisms of the gun because their control signal was based on the value of the derivatives.<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> This could be mitigated by smoothing or averaging out the data but this caused delays in the feedback loop that enabled the target to escape.<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> As well, the algorithms of Director T-10 required a number of transformations from [[Cartesian coordinate system|cartesian]] (rectangular) to [[polar coordinates]] and back to Cartesian, a process that introduced additional tracking [[Approximation error|errors]].<ref name=\"Mindell\"/>\n\nBode designed the [[velocity]] computing networks of Director T-15 by applying a [[finite difference method]] instead of [[Derivative|differentiation]].<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> Under this scheme the target positional [[coordinates]] were stored in a mechanical memory, usually a [[potentiometer]] or a [[cam]].<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> The velocity was then calculated by taking the difference between the coordinates of the current position and the coordinates of the previous reading that were stored in memory and dividing by the difference of their respective times.<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> This method was more robust than the differentiation method and it also smoothed out signal disturbances since the finite time-step size was less sensitive to [[random]] [[Impulse response|signal impulses]] ([[Voltage spike|spikes]]).<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> It also introduced for the first time an algorithm better suited to modern [[Discrete signal|digital]] [[Digital signal processing|signal processing]] theory rather than to the classical [[Calculus]]-based [[analog signal processing]] approach that was followed then. Not coincidentally it is an integral part of modern digital control theory and digital signal processing and it is known as the backward difference algorithm.<ref name=\"backward difference\">[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BackwardDifference.html Eric W. Weisstein. \"Backward Difference.\" From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource.]</ref> In addition the Director T-15 operated only in rectangular coordinates thus eliminating [[Coordinate system#coordinate transformation|coordinate transformation]]-based errors. These design innovations paid performance dividends and the Director T-15 was twice as accurate as its predecessor and it converged on a target twice as fast.<ref name=\"Mindell\"/>\n\nThe fire control [[algorithm]] implementation of his artillery design research and his extensive work with feedback amplifiers advanced the state of the art in computational methods and led to the eventual development of the [[analog computer|electronic analog computer]],<ref name=\"analog comp.\">[http://dcoward.best.vwh.net/analog/ Analog Computer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208232216/http://dcoward.best.vwh.net/analog/ |date=February 8, 2006 }}</ref> the [[operational amplifier]] based alternative of today's [[digital computers]].\n\nInventions such as these, despite their military research origins, have had a profound and lasting impact in the civilian domain.\n\n===Military uses===\n\n====Anzio and Normandy====\nThe automated anti-aircraft guns that Bode helped develop were successfully used in numerous instances during the war. In February 1944 the automated fire control system, based on the earlier version of the Director T-15, called the Director T-10 by Bell Labs or Director M-9 by the military, saw action for the first time in [[Operation Shingle|Anzio]], Italy where it helped down over one hundred enemy aircraft. On [[D-day]] thirty nine units were deployed in [[operation Overlord|Normandy]] to protect the [[Allies of World War II|allied]] invading force against [[Hitler|Hitler's]] [[Luftwaffe]].<ref name=\"Mindell\"/>\n\n====Use against the V-1 flying bomb====\nPerhaps the menace best suited for the design specifications of such an automated artillery system appeared in June 1944. Not surprisingly it was another robot. The German Aeronautical Engineers aided by [[Wernher von Braun]] produced a robot of their own; the [[V-1 flying bomb]], an automatically guided bomb and widely considered a precursor of the [[cruise missile]].<ref name=\"The Telegraph.\">[http://cndyorks.gn.apc.org/yspace/articles/vonbraun.htm Germans at last learn truth about von Braun's 'space research' base.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228045555/http://cndyorks.gn.apc.org/yspace/articles/vonbraun.htm |date=February 28, 2007 }} Article on [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] by Tony Paterson in Peenemunde, June 10, 2001 Quote: \"...missile research centre run by Wernher von Braun, who later worked on the American space programme...\" . Retrieved March 9, 2007.</ref><ref name=\"IEEE Global History network on Wernher\">[http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Wernher_von_Braun IEEE Global History Network] Quote: \"Von Braun soon went to work at a secret laboratory called Peenem\u00fcnde near the Baltic Sea, working on the V-1 missile, which would terrorize Londoners\". Retrieved January 14, 2009.</ref> Its flight specifications almost perfectly suited the target design criteria of Director T-10, that of an aircraft flying straight and level at constant velocity,<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> in other words a target nicely fitting the computing capabilities of a linear predictor model such as the Director T-10. Although the Germans did have a trick up their engineering sleeve by making the bomb fly fast and low to evade radar, a technique widely adopted even today. During the [[London Blitz]] one hundred Director T-10 assisted 90&nbsp;mm automated gun units were set up in a perimeter south of London, at the special request of [[Winston Churchill]]. The [[Anti-aircraft warfare|AA]] units included the SCR-584 radar unit produced by the [[Radiation Lab]] at [[MIT]] and the proximity [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]] mechanism, developed by [[Merle Tuve]] and his special ''Division T'' at NDRC,<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> that detonated near the target using a [[microwave]] controlled fuse called the VT or variable time fuse, enabling a larger detonation reach envelope and increasing the chances of a successful outcome. Between June 18 and July 17, 1944, 343 V-1 bombs were shot down or 10% of the total V-1 number sent by the Germans and about 20% of the total V-1 bombs shot down. From July 17 to August 31 the automated gun kills rose to 1286 V-1 rockets or 34%  of the total V-1 number dispatched from Germany and 50% of the V-1 actually shot down over London.<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> From these statistics it can be seen that the automated systems that Bode helped design had a considerable impact on crucial battles of [[World War II]].<ref name=\"Nelson2010\"/> It can also be seen that London at the time of the [[Blitzkrieg|Blitz]] became, among other things, the original robot [[battle]]field.\n\n===Synergy with Shannon===\nIn 1945, as the war was winding down, the NDRC was issuing a summary of technical reports as the prelude to its eventual closing down. Inside the volume on Fire Control a special essay titled ''Data Smoothing and Prediction in Fire-Control Systems'', coauthored by [[Ralph Beebe Blackman]], Hendrik Bode, and [[Claude Shannon]], formally introduced the problem of fire control as a special case of ''transmission, manipulation and utilization of intelligence'',<ref name=\"Mindell\"/><ref name=\"cybernetics in sov. union\"/> in other words it modeled the problem in terms of [[Data processing|data]] and [[signal processing]] and thus heralded the coming of the [[information age]]. Shannon, considered to be the father of [[information theory]], was greatly influenced by this work.<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> It is clear that the [[technological convergence]]\nof the information age was preceded by the [[synergy]] between these scientific minds and their collaborators.\n\n===Further wartime achievements===\nIn 1944, Bode was placed in charge of the Mathematical Research Group at Bell Laboratories.<ref name=\"math group history\">[http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/center/history.html Mathematical Research Group History] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130118060203/http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/center/history.html |date=January 18, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nHis work on electronic communications, especially on filter and equalizer design,<ref name=\"filter design\">[http://www.rane.com/note122.html Equalizers]</ref>\ncontinued during this time.

Its function required to process data that was wirelessly transmitted to its sensors and make a decision based on the data received using its onboard computer about its output defined as its angular position and the timing of its firing mechanism. In  this model we can see all the elements of later concepts such as [[data processing]], [[automation]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[cybernetics]], [[robotics]] etc.\n\n===Working on Director Studies===\nBode, in addition, applied  his extensive skills with feedback amplifiers to design the target data smoothing and position  predictor networks of an improved model of Director T-10, called the ''Director T-15''. The work on Director T-15 was undertaken under a new project at Bell Labs called ''Fundamental Director Studies'' in cooperation with the NDRC under the directorship of Walter McNair.<ref name=\"Mindell\"/>\n\nNDRC, the funding agency of this project, was operating under the aegis of the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] ([[OSRD]]).<ref name=\"osrd\">{{cite web|url=http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/WW2Timeline/OSRD.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-02-22 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520212523/http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/WW2Timeline/OSRD.html |archivedate=May 20, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nHis NDRC-funded research at Bell Labs under the section D-2 (Control Systems section) contract eventually led to other important developments in related fields and laid the cornerstone for many present-day inventions.  In the field of [[control theory]], for example, it  aided in the further development of servomechanism design and control, a crucial component of modern [[robotics]]. The development of Wireless Data Communications theory by Bode led to later inventions such as mobile phones and [[wireless networking]].\n\nThe reason for the new project was that Director T-10 encountered difficulties in calculating the target velocity by differentiating the target position. Due to [[discontinuity (mathematics)|discontinuities]], variations and noise in the radar signal, the position [[derivative]]s sometimes fluctuated wildly and this caused erratic motion in the servomechanisms of the gun because their control signal was based on the value of the derivatives.<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> This could be mitigated by smoothing or averaging out the data but this caused delays in the feedback loop that enabled the target to escape.<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> As well, the algorithms of Director T-10 required a number of transformations from [[Cartesian coordinate system|cartesian]] (rectangular) to [[polar coordinates]] and back to Cartesian, a process that introduced additional tracking [[Approximation error|errors]].<ref name=\"Mindell\"/>\n\nBode designed the [[velocity]] computing networks of Director T-15 by applying a [[finite difference method]] instead of [[Derivative|differentiation]].<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> Under this scheme the target positional [[coordinates]] were stored in a mechanical memory, usually a [[potentiometer]] or a [[cam]].<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> The velocity was then calculated by taking the difference between the coordinates of the current position and the coordinates of the previous reading that were stored in memory and dividing by the difference of their respective times.<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> This method was more robust than the differentiation method and it also smoothed out signal disturbances since the finite time-step size was less sensitive to [[random]] [[Impulse response|signal impulses]] ([[Voltage spike|spikes]]).<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> It also introduced for the first time an algorithm better suited to modern [[Discrete signal|digital]] [[Digital signal processing|signal processing]] theory rather than to the classical [[Calculus]]-based [[analog signal processing]] approach that was followed then. Not coincidentally it is an integral part of modern digital control theory and digital signal processing and it is known as the backward difference algorithm.<ref name=\"backward difference\">[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BackwardDifference.html Eric W. Weisstein. \"Backward Difference.\" From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource.]</ref> In addition the Director T-15 operated only in rectangular coordinates thus eliminating [[Coordinate system#coordinate transformation|coordinate transformation]]-based errors. These design innovations paid performance dividends and the Director T-15 was twice as accurate as its predecessor and it converged on a target twice as fast.<ref name=\"Mindell\"/>\n\nThe fire control [[algorithm]] implementation of his artillery design research and his extensive work with feedback amplifiers advanced the state of the art in computational methods and led to the eventual development of the [[analog computer|electronic analog computer]],<ref name=\"analog comp.\">[http://dcoward.best.vwh.net/analog/ Analog Computer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208232216/http://dcoward.best.vwh.net/analog/ |date=February 8, 2006 }}</ref> the [[operational amplifier]] based alternative of today's [[digital computers]].\n\nInventions such as these, despite their military research origins, have had a profound and lasting impact in the civilian domain.\n\n===Military uses===\n\n====Anzio and Normandy====\nThe automated anti-aircraft guns that Bode helped develop were successfully used in numerous instances during the war. In February 1944 the automated fire control system, based on the earlier version of the Director T-15, called the Director T-10 by Bell Labs or Director M-9 by the military, saw action for the first time in [[Operation Shingle|Anzio]], Italy where it helped down over one hundred enemy aircraft. On [[D-day]] thirty nine units were deployed in [[operation Overlord|Normandy]] to protect the [[Allies of World War II|allied]] invading force against [[Hitler|Hitler's]] [[Luftwaffe]].<ref name=\"Mindell\"/>\n\n====Use against the V-1 flying bomb====\nPerhaps the menace best suited for the design specifications of such an automated artillery system appeared in June 1944. Not surprisingly it was another robot. The German Aeronautical Engineers aided by [[Wernher von Braun]] produced a robot of their own; the [[V-1 flying bomb]], an automatically guided bomb and widely considered a precursor of the [[cruise missile]].<ref name=\"The Telegraph.\">[http://cndyorks.gn.apc.org/yspace/articles/vonbraun.htm Germans at last learn truth about von Braun's 'space research' base.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228045555/http://cndyorks.gn.apc.org/yspace/articles/vonbraun.htm |date=February 28, 2007 }} Article on [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] by Tony Paterson in Peenemunde, June 10, 2001 Quote: \"...missile research centre run by Wernher von Braun, who later worked on the American space programme...\" .

Retrieved January 14, 2009.</ref> Its flight specifications almost perfectly suited the target design criteria of Director T-10, that of an aircraft flying straight and level at constant velocity,<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> in other words a target nicely fitting the computing capabilities of a linear predictor model such as the Director T-10. Although the Germans did have a trick up their engineering sleeve by making the bomb fly fast and low to evade radar, a technique widely adopted even today. During the [[London Blitz]] one hundred Director T-10 assisted 90&nbsp;mm automated gun units were set up in a perimeter south of London, at the special request of [[Winston Churchill]]. The [[Anti-aircraft warfare|AA]] units included the SCR-584 radar unit produced by the [[Radiation Lab]] at [[MIT]] and the proximity [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]] mechanism, developed by [[Merle Tuve]] and his special ''Division T'' at NDRC,<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> that detonated near the target using a [[microwave]] controlled fuse called the VT or variable time fuse, enabling a larger detonation reach envelope and increasing the chances of a successful outcome. Between June 18 and July 17, 1944, 343 V-1 bombs were shot down or 10% of the total V-1 number sent by the Germans and about 20% of the total V-1 bombs shot down. From July 17 to August 31 the automated gun kills rose to 1286 V-1 rockets or 34%  of the total V-1 number dispatched from Germany and 50% of the V-1 actually shot down over London.<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> From these statistics it can be seen that the automated systems that Bode helped design had a considerable impact on crucial battles of [[World War II]].<ref name=\"Nelson2010\"/> It can also be seen that London at the time of the [[Blitzkrieg|Blitz]] became, among other things, the original robot [[battle]]field.\n\n===Synergy with Shannon===\nIn 1945, as the war was winding down, the NDRC was issuing a summary of technical reports as the prelude to its eventual closing down. Inside the volume on Fire Control a special essay titled ''Data Smoothing and Prediction in Fire-Control Systems'', coauthored by [[Ralph Beebe Blackman]], Hendrik Bode, and [[Claude Shannon]], formally introduced the problem of fire control as a special case of ''transmission, manipulation and utilization of intelligence'',<ref name=\"Mindell\"/><ref name=\"cybernetics in sov. union\"/> in other words it modeled the problem in terms of [[Data processing|data]] and [[signal processing]] and thus heralded the coming of the [[information age]]. Shannon, considered to be the father of [[information theory]], was greatly influenced by this work.<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> It is clear that the [[technological convergence]]\nof the information age was preceded by the [[synergy]] between these scientific minds and their collaborators.\n\n===Further wartime achievements===\nIn 1944, Bode was placed in charge of the Mathematical Research Group at Bell Laboratories.<ref name=\"math group history\">[http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/center/history.html Mathematical Research Group History] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130118060203/http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/center/history.html |date=January 18, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nHis work on electronic communications, especially on filter and equalizer design,<ref name=\"filter design\">[http://www.rane.com/note122.html Equalizers]</ref>\ncontinued during this time.

In 1935 Aeroput operated three times weekly the non-stop route Belgrade \u2013 Sarajevo, which was extended to [[Dubrovnik]] a year later. In 1937 Aeroput included regular flights linking Sarajevo to Zagreb, and 1938 was the year when first international flights were introduced when Aeroput extended the route Dubrovnik \u2013 Sarajevo \u2013 Zagreb to Vienna, Brno, and Prague.<ref name=\"aeroput\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sarajevotimes.com/aeroput-first-airline-landed-sarajevo/|title=Aeroput, the First Airline that Landed in Sarajevo|date=21 April 2014|website=Sarajevotimes.com|accessdate=24 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe airfield in Butmir remained in use all the way until 1969. The need for a new airport in Sarajevo, with an asphalt-concrete runway, was acknowledged in the mid-1960s when JAT, Yugoslav national carrier at that time, began acquiring jet planes. The construction of the airport began in 1966 at its present location, not far from the old one.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nSarajevo Airport opened on 2 June 1969 for domestic traffic. In 1970 [[Frankfurt]] became the first international destination served. Most of the time the airport was a 'feeder' airport where passengers embarked for flights to [[Zagreb]] and [[Belgrade]] on their way to international destinations. Over time the traffic volume steadily grew from 70,000 to 600,000 passengers a year. The first renovation came for the [[1984 Winter Olympics]], when the runway was extended by 200 meters, the navigation system was improved, and a new terminal building was built, designed for 1 million passengers a year.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nAt the beginning of the [[Bosnian War]] the airport was put under control of [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA). When the regular flights were stopped the JNA evacuated some 30,000 people, mostly women and children, who were spouses and children of JNA officers fleeing the [[siege of Sarajevo]]; the first humanitarian aid from the US and France arrived in this period too.<ref name=\"Two Days Till Peace - A Sarajevo Airport Story\">{{Cite web |url=http://twodaystillpeace.com/book.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=19 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831162049/http://twodaystillpeace.com/book.html |archive-date=31 August 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> After JNA left, the airport was for a while under control of Bosnian Serb forces and in June 1992 they handed over the airport to the UN to use it for humanitarian purposes (UN Security Council Resolution 757). In the biggest humanitarian operation in history of the UN that followed, during the Bosnian war, some 13,000 flights were carried out and over 160,000 tons of international humanitarian aid was delivered to the besieged city of Sarajevo.<ref name=\"Two Days Till Peace - A Sarajevo Airport Story\"/>\n\nThe airport re-opened to civilian air traffic on 16 August 1996 and has since been renovated and slowly restored.

Current work is undergoing on expansion of arrival area, adding more passport control check stands and rearranging whole arrival area to make it more passenger friendly. Next to follow is expansion of check in area which will include three more check in counters making it total of 15 check in counters. By the end of the year the airport will begin with platform expansion and the construction of rapid exit taxiway with scheduled completion by mid of the next year. 2017 should be the year in which airport will enter into the reconstruction of the runway and the maneuvering areas. Expansion of the airport at the current level is financed by Sarajevo Airport own funds.

About 40% of flights were canceled which impacted passengers growth and financial loss to the airport. Airport handled only 28.167 passengers of 50.000 planned (last year in December 43.079 passengers were handled). For Sarajevo International Airport one of major restrictions is a mountain terrain that requires a high approach precision and a big inclination angle in a procedure of unsuccessful approach and landing. Mr Vlado Juri\u0107, Head of the Office for aviation safety at Bosnia and Herzegovina Air Navigation Services Agency (BHANSA), presented the information about problems caused by reduced minimums at Sarajevo Airport. For the implementation of ILS categories (CAT II or CAT III), the terrain in front of the runway start should be free of obstacles for at least 1000 meters. It means that the RWY 12 threshold should be moved for additional 200 meters which would reduce the runway length and as such is unacceptable. From the point of view of procedure design, the reduction of minimums is not an option and therefor it is necessary to find other solutions for improvement of landing conditions at Sarajevo Airport. The biggest problem at Sarajevo Airport is fog. The representative of Sarajevo Airport, Mr Nermin Zijadi\u0107 informed that there is a relevant plan regarding this problem. He also presented the information about future projects of Sarajevo Airport among which the most important one is a reconstruction of the runway including its lighting system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sarajevo-airport.ba/vijest.php?id=426&lang=eng|title=Sarajevo-Airport.ba - Me\u0111unarodni aerodrom Sarajevo|website=Sarajevo-airport.ba}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, [[Qatar Airways]] announced a new route from [[Doha]] to Sarajevo.

Nobody was injured in the accident, nor was there any damage. By next Monday afternoon, the aircraft had been recovered and was parked on the apron.

The airport snow plough had just cleared the runway, a 20-minute job, when an HB-IXH from Z\u00fcrich requested authorization to land.\" In those circumstances, the air traffic controller cannot give authorization.

In 1935 Aeroput operated three times weekly the non-stop route Belgrade \u2013 Sarajevo, which was extended to [[Dubrovnik]] a year later. In 1937 Aeroput included regular flights linking Sarajevo to Zagreb, and 1938 was the year when first international flights were introduced when Aeroput extended the route Dubrovnik \u2013 Sarajevo \u2013 Zagreb to Vienna, Brno, and Prague.<ref name=\"aeroput\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sarajevotimes.com/aeroput-first-airline-landed-sarajevo/|title=Aeroput, the First Airline that Landed in Sarajevo|date=21 April 2014|website=Sarajevotimes.com|accessdate=24 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe airfield in Butmir remained in use all the way until 1969. The need for a new airport in Sarajevo, with an asphalt-concrete runway, was acknowledged in the mid-1960s when JAT, Yugoslav national carrier at that time, began acquiring jet planes. The construction of the airport began in 1966 at its present location, not far from the old one.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nSarajevo Airport opened on 2 June 1969 for domestic traffic. In 1970 [[Frankfurt]] became the first international destination served. Most of the time the airport was a 'feeder' airport where passengers embarked for flights to [[Zagreb]] and [[Belgrade]] on their way to international destinations. Over time the traffic volume steadily grew from 70,000 to 600,000 passengers a year. The first renovation came for the [[1984 Winter Olympics]], when the runway was extended by 200 meters, the navigation system was improved, and a new terminal building was built, designed for 1 million passengers a year.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nAt the beginning of the [[Bosnian War]] the airport was put under control of [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA). When the regular flights were stopped the JNA evacuated some 30,000 people, mostly women and children, who were spouses and children of JNA officers fleeing the [[siege of Sarajevo]]; the first humanitarian aid from the US and France arrived in this period too.<ref name=\"Two Days Till Peace - A Sarajevo Airport Story\">{{Cite web |url=http://twodaystillpeace.com/book.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=19 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831162049/http://twodaystillpeace.com/book.html |archive-date=31 August 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> After JNA left, the airport was for a while under control of Bosnian Serb forces and in June 1992 they handed over the airport to the UN to use it for humanitarian purposes (UN Security Council Resolution 757). In the biggest humanitarian operation in history of the UN that followed, during the Bosnian war, some 13,000 flights were carried out and over 160,000 tons of international humanitarian aid was delivered to the besieged city of Sarajevo.<ref name=\"Two Days Till Peace - A Sarajevo Airport Story\"/>\n\nThe airport re-opened to civilian air traffic on 16 August 1996 and has since been renovated and slowly restored. Since the [[Dayton Agreement]] in 1996, the airport has a commercial flight business which includes [[Austrian Airlines]], [[Lufthansa]], [[Air Serbia]], [[Croatia Airlines]], [[Turkish Airlines]], [[Germanwings]], and others.\n\n===Development since the 2000s===\n\nOn 18 October 2005, [[Paddy Ashdown]], the High Representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina, suspended a decision by Bosnian authorities to name the airport after [[Alija Izetbegovi\u0107]], the first President of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Current work is undergoing on expansion of arrival area, adding more passport control check stands and rearranging whole arrival area to make it more passenger friendly. Next to follow is expansion of check in area which will include three more check in counters making it total of 15 check in counters. By the end of the year the airport will begin with platform expansion and the construction of rapid exit taxiway with scheduled completion by mid of the next year. 2017 should be the year in which airport will enter into the reconstruction of the runway and the maneuvering areas. Expansion of the airport at the current level is financed by Sarajevo Airport own funds. On 6 June 2015 Pope Francis visited Sarajevo arriving on an [[Alitalia]] [[Airbus A320 family#A320|Airbus A320-200]] from [[Leonardo da Vinci\u2013Fiumicino Airport|Rome]].

About 40% of flights were canceled which impacted passengers growth and financial loss to the airport. Airport handled only 28.167 passengers of 50.000 planned (last year in December 43.079 passengers were handled). For Sarajevo International Airport one of major restrictions is a mountain terrain that requires a high approach precision and a big inclination angle in a procedure of unsuccessful approach and landing. Mr Vlado Juri\u0107, Head of the Office for aviation safety at Bosnia and Herzegovina Air Navigation Services Agency (BHANSA), presented the information about problems caused by reduced minimums at Sarajevo Airport. For the implementation of ILS categories (CAT II or CAT III), the terrain in front of the runway start should be free of obstacles for at least 1000 meters. It means that the RWY 12 threshold should be moved for additional 200 meters which would reduce the runway length and as such is unacceptable. From the point of view of procedure design, the reduction of minimums is not an option and therefor it is necessary to find other solutions for improvement of landing conditions at Sarajevo Airport. The biggest problem at Sarajevo Airport is fog. The representative of Sarajevo Airport, Mr Nermin Zijadi\u0107 informed that there is a relevant plan regarding this problem. He also presented the information about future projects of Sarajevo Airport among which the most important one is a reconstruction of the runway including its lighting system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sarajevo-airport.ba/vijest.php?id=426&lang=eng|title=Sarajevo-Airport.ba - Me\u0111unarodni aerodrom Sarajevo|website=Sarajevo-airport.ba}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, [[Qatar Airways]] announced a new route from [[Doha]] to Sarajevo.

Nobody was injured in the accident, nor was there any damage. By next Monday afternoon, the aircraft had been recovered and was parked on the apron. The French Air Detachment (DETAIR) and local aeronautical authorities have opened an investigation to determine the cause of the accident. It was snowing on the afternoon of 23 Dec.. The airport snow plough had just cleared the runway, a 20-minute job, when an HB-IXH from Z\u00fcrich requested authorization to land.\" In those circumstances, the air traffic controller cannot give authorization. He only informs the pilot and the pilot is the one who has the responsibility to take the decision to land,\" said Maj. Olivier Mrowiki, air deputy commander. \"The pilot (captain) decided to land and began the IFR approach procedure. The maneuver was correct and the touch down (landing) was perfect. The problem arose when the aircraft did not stop on the runway and went beyond it and stopped just in front of the ILS (instrumental landing system) antennas more than 100 meters beyond the end of the runway,\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.fortunecity.ws/oasis/tropicana/533/CROSSAIR-HB-IXH.html|title=Crossair aircraft has slid off the runway of Sarajevo airport|website=Community.fortunecity.ws|accessdate=6 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of airports in Bosnia and Herzegovina]]\n* [[Tuzla International Airport]]\n* [[Mostar International Airport]]\n* [[Banja Luka International Airport]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category-inline|Sarajevo International Airport}}\n* [http://www.sarajevo-airport.ba/?lang=eng Official website]\n* [http://www.khl.com/news/detail/item55324/Sarajevo-International-Airport-upgrade/ Sarajevo International Airport upgrade 2010]\n* {{NWS-current|LQSA}}\n* {{ASN|SJJ}}\n\n{{Portalbar|Bosnia and Herzegovina|Aviation}}\n{{Airports in Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\n{{Sarajevo}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Airports in Bosnia and Herzegovina]]\n[[Category:Airports established in 1969]]\n[[Category:Transport in Sarajevo]]\n[[Category:Grad Sarajevo]]\n", "name_user": "Jellysandwich0", "label": "safe", "comment": "defunct", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarajevo_International_Airport"}
