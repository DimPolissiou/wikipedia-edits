A common misconception is that the affected communities usually hold pride in their labeling as the model minority. The model minority stereotype is considered detrimental to relevant minority communities because it is used to justify the exclusion of minorities in the distribution of assistance programs, both public and private, as well as to understate or slight the achievements of individuals within that minority. Furthermore, the idea of the model minority pits minority groups against each other by implying that non-model groups are at fault for falling short of the model minority level of achievement and assimilation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Choi|first=Yoonsun|last2=Lahey|first2=Benjamin B.|date=2006-09-01|title=Testing the Model Minority Stereotype: Youth Behaviors across Racial and Ethnic Groups|journal=The Social Service Review|volume=80|issue=3|pages=419\u2013452|doi=10.1086/505288|issn=0037-7961|pmc=3093248|pmid=21572913}}</ref> \n\nThe concept has also been criticized by outlets such as NPR for potentially homogenizing the experiences of Asian Americans on one side and Hispanics and African Americans on the other, despite the different groups experiencing racism in different ways.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2017/04/19/524571669/model-minority-myth-again-used-as-a-racial-wedge-between-asians-and-blacks|title='Model Minority' Myth Again Used As A Racial Wedge Between Asians And Blacks|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-09-21}}</ref> It has been argued that the idea perpetuates the belief that any minority has the capability to rise economically without assistance and ignores the differences between the history of Asian Americans and African Americans, and sometimes Hispanics, in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.inheritancemag.com/article/the-model-minority-myth-and-the-wedge-between-black-and-white-america|title=The Model Minority Myth and the Wedge Between Black and White America [Updated] {{!}} Inheritance|work=Inheritance|access-date=2018-11-06}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of \"model minority\" is heavily associated with U.S. culture and is not extensively used outside the U.S., though many European countries have concepts of classism that stereotype ethnic groups in a similar manner to model minority.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.news18.com/news/india/sikhs-hindus-now-part-of-middle-class-britain-354653.html|title=Sikhs, Hindus now part of middle-class Britain|work=News18|access-date=2017-08-02}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nOne of the earliest uses of the term ''model minority'' was in the 9 January 1966 edition of ''The New York Times Magazine'' by sociologist William Petersen to describe Asian Americans as ethnic minorities who, despite [[marginalization]], have achieved success in the United States. In his essay called \"Success Story: Japanese American Style\", he wrote that the Japanese cultures have strong work ethics and family values. Furthermore, he wrote that those values prevent them from becoming a \"problem minority\".

This led many even within the Asian American community at the time to view it either as a welcomed positive stereotype in contrast to years of negative stereotypes, or as a euphemistic stereotype that was no more than a mere annoyance. They did not foresee the negative repercussions to come from this stereotype. Many critics point out that there are more positives than negatives that come with this stereotype while many others believe that there are just as many negatives that come with this stereotype as there are positives and that no stereotype regardless of how positive they try to be or how positive their connotations are should be regarded as a good stereotype. Scientific studies have revealed that positive stereotypes have many negative and damaging consequences both socially and psychologically.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fuqua.duke.edu/news_events/news-releases/aaron-kay-positive-stereotypes/#.Uc4I4Ubn_IU|title=Fuqua Research Sheds Light on the Dangers of Positive Stereotypes|author=Aaron Kay|date=17 January 2013 |publisher=[[Duke University]]|accessdate=28 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ulterior-motives/201302/the-pain-positive-stereotypes|title=The Pain of Positive Stereotypes|author=Art Markman, Ph.D. |date=February 15, 2013|magazine=Psychology Today|accessdate=28 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/oliver-burkemans-blog/2012/dec/12/stereotypes-bad-even-when-good|title=Why stereotypes are bad even when they're 'good'|author=Oliver Burkemandate|date=12 December 2012|magazine=Psychology Today|accessdate=28 July 2013|location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/2005/12/16/the-negative-impact-of-positiv/|title=The negative impact of positive stereotypes|author=Dave Munger|date=December 16, 2005|publisher=Scienceblogs|accessdate=28 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513022852/http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/2005/12/16/the-negative-impact-of-positiv/|archive-date=2013-05-13|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\nA few years after the article on Asian Americans being the model minority was published, Asian Americans formed their own movement that fought for their own equal rights and resolution of their own specific social issues, modeling it after the Civil Rights Movement thus effectively challenging White America and the [[social construct]] of racial discrimination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aam1968.blogspot.com/|title=Asian American Movement 1968|year=2008|accessdate=24 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n==United States==\nIn the United States, the term was coined to first describe the socioeconomic success of [[Japanese Americans]], although it has eventually evolved to become associated with [[American Jews]] and [[Asian Americans]],<ref>{{cite journal|title=Project MUSE - Transgressions of a Model Minority|journal=Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies|volume=23|issue=4|pages=69\u201397|doi=10.1353/sho.2005.0147|year=2005|last1=Freedman|first1=Jonathan}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2010/02/08/do_colleges_redline_asian_americans/|title=Do colleges redline Asian-Americans?|last=Miller|first=Kara|date=8 February 2010|work=The Boston Globe|accessdate=10 January 2013}}</ref> but more specifically with East Asians (Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans)<ref name=\"LiWang2008\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G2jHy9gv3M0C|title=Model Minority Myth Revisited: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Demystifying Asian American Educational Experiences (Hc)|author1=Guofang Li|author2=Lihshing Wang|date=15 August 2008|publisher=IAP|isbn=978-1-59311-951-5|page=21|accessdate=12 January 2013}}</ref> and Indians.<ref name=\"Kramer2003\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x9-yOGSyKrYC&pg=PA213|title=The Emerging Monoculture: Assimilation and the \"Model Minority\"|author=Eric Mark Kramer|date=28 February 2003|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-97312-4|pages=213\u2013|accessdate=12 January 2013}}</ref> The concept of a model minority has faced backlash from the Asian American community.

While 50 percent of Chinese immigrants in the U.S. have a bachelor's degree, only 5 percent of the population does in their native China.<ref name=\"YananWang\"/> Lastly, if Confucian culture played a vital part of Asian culture, Chinese immigrant children would perform consistently around the world, yet second-generation Chinese immigrants are the lowest academic achievers among immigrant groups in Spain, less than half are expected to graduate from middle school.<ref name=\"YananWang\"/>\n\n====Asian American status in affirmative action====\n{{See also|Affirmative action|Asian quota}}\n\nIn the 1980s, one [[Ivy League]] school found evidence it had limited admissions of Asian American students. Because of their high degree of success as a group and over-representation in many areas such as [[college admissions]], most Asian Americans are not granted preferential treatment by [[affirmative action]] policies as are other minority groups.<ref name=\"Asian over-representation Washington Post\"/>\n\nSome schools choose lower-scoring applicants from other [[Race (human classification)|racial]] groups over Asian Americans in an attempt to promote racial [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] and to maintain some [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]] to the society's racial [[Demographics of the United States|demographics]].<ref name=\"Asian over-representation Washington Post\">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A55160-2005Mar21.html|title=Learning to Stand Out Among the Standouts|work=The Washington Post|date=March 22, 2005|accessdate=December 10, 2010|first=Jay|last=Mathews}}</ref><ref name=\"asianstudies3\">{{Cite book|last=Ancheta|first=Angelo N.|authorlink=|title=Race, Rights, and the Asian American Experience|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2006|location=|pages=|url=|doi=|id=|isbn= 978-0-8135-3902-7\n}}</ref>{{rp|165}}\n\nIn 2014, American business schools began a process to sort candidates based on their country of origin and region of the world they come from.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stacyblackman.com/2014/11/14/separate-gmat-rankings-for-u-s-and-asian-applicants/|title=Separate GMAT Rankings for U.S. and Asian Applicants|website=Stacy Blackman Consulting - MBA Admissions Consulting|access-date=2017-01-13}}</ref>\n\n===Effects of the stereotype ===\nAccording to Gordon H. Chang: The reference to Asian Americans as model minorities has to do with the work ethic, respect for elders, and high valuation of education, family and elders present in their culture. The model minority stereotype also comes with an underlying notion of their apoliticality. Such a label one-dimensionalizes Asian Americans as having only traits based around stereotypes and no other human qualities, such as vocal leadership, negative emotions (e.g. anger or sadness), sociopolitical activeness, risk taking, ability to learn from mistakes, desire for creative expression, intolerance towards oppression or being overlooked of their acknowledgements and successes. Asian Americans are labeled as model minorities because they have not been as much of a \"threat\" to the U.S. political establishment as blacks, due to a smaller population and less political advocacy. This label seeks to suppress potential political activism through euphemistic stereotyping.<ref>{{cite book |last=Chang |first=Gordon |date=2002 |title=Asian Americans and Politics: Perspectives, Experiences, Prospects |url=https://archive.org/details/asianamericanspo00chan |url-access=registration |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=9780804742016 }}</ref>\n\nAnother effect of the stereotype is that American society may tend to ignore the racism and discrimination Asian Americans still face. Complaints are dismissed with the claim that the racism which occurs to Asian Americans is less important than or not as bad as the racism faced by other minority races, thus establishing a systematic [[racial hierarchy]].  Believing that due to their success and that they possess so-called \"positive\" stereotypes, many{{who|date=June 2013}} assume they face no forms of racial discrimination or social issues in the greater American society, and that their community is fine, having \"gained\" social and economic equality.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yellow Face: The documentary part 4 - Asian Americans do face racism|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TOYT4JTea4|publisher=Youtube.com|accessdate=24 February 2013|date=5 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Asians, Blacks, Stereotypes and the Media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqShFjk6BoE|publisher=Youtube.com|accessdate=24 February 2013|date=5 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Racial Microaggressions and the Asian American Experience|url=http://psy6129.alliant.wikispaces.net/file/view/Sue,+Bucerri+et+al.+2007.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112140608/http://psy6129.alliant.wikispaces.net/file/view/Sue,+Bucerri+et+al.+2007.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=12 January 2012|publisher=Psy6129.alliant.wikispaces.net|accessdate=11 November 2013|date=5 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nRacial discrimination can take subtle forms such as through [[microaggression]].

For instance, discrimination and model minority stereotyping are linked to Asian American students' lower valuing of school, lower self-esteem, and higher depressive symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kiang|first1=Lisa|title=Model Minority Stereotyping, Perceived Discrimination, and Adjustment Among Adolescents from Asian American Backgrounds.|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|date=2016|volume=45|issue=7|pages=1366\u20131379|doi=10.1007/s10964-015-0336-7|pmid=26251100}}</ref> Furthermore, the psychological distress of failing to meet the model minority image, such as feelings of inadequacy, self-doubt, shame, and embarrassment, is exacerbated due to the differential treatment associated with being stereotyped as a model minority and [[perpetual foreigner]].\n\nFurthermore, the model minority image can be a threat to underachieving Asian American students' academic experience and educational advancement. It promotes invisibility and disguises the academic barriers and psychological problems students may encounter. This is problematic because it creates a barrier for educators to better understand and assist struggling students' educational and mental health needs in order to optimize students' academic experience and social emotional development.\n\nAsian Americans may also be commonly stereotyped by the general public as being studious, intelligent, successful, elitist, brand name conscious, yet paradoxically passive. As a result, higher and unreasonable expectations are often associated with Asian Americans.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Also due to the model minority image, Asian American students are viewed as \"problem-free\" and academically competent students who can succeed with little support and without special services.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Guofang|title=Other People's Success: Impact of the \"Model Minority\" Myth on Underachieving Asian Students in North America|journal=KEDI Journal of Educational Policy|date=2005|volume=2|issue=1|pages=69\u201386}}</ref> This emphasis that Asian Americans are being denial by their racial reality because of the assumption that \"Asians are the new Whites\"; therefore, they are being dismissed by their intelligence and experiences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/ethnicity-health/asian-american/microaggressions-asians.pdf|title=Racial Microaggressions and the Asian American Experience|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Thus, educators may overlook the instructional needs and psychological concerns of underachieving Asian American students. The model minority stereotype can also contribute to teachers' having a \"blaming the victims\" perspective. This means that teachers blame students, their culture, or their families for students' poor performance or misbehavior in school. This is problematic because it shifts responsibility away from schools and teachers and misdirects attention away from finding a solution to improve students' learning experience and alleviate the situation. Furthermore, the model minority stereotype has a negative impact on the home environment. Parents' expectations place high pressure on students to achieve, creating a stressful, school-like home environment. Parents' expressed worry and frustration can also place emotional burdens and psychological stress on students.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nSome educators hold Asian students to a higher standard.<ref name=\"asianamericanissues1\"/> This deprives those students with [[learning disabilities]] from being given attention that they need.

It is a threat to Asian American students' academic experience and can disguise students' educational and mental health needs. Psychological distress from model minority stereotyping is related to the stressors associated with the pressure to succeed, differential treatment, and embarrassment or shame to seek help. With this information, a recommendation for schools is to promote a more inclusive and less competitive learning environment, so students will not be ashamed and afraid to ask for help. Administrators can also improve school climate by monitoring incidents of racial harassment and discrimination. Additionally, to better address struggling students' educational and mental health needs, educators can regularly check in with students and engage in culturally responsive teaching, aimed to understand students' unique circumstances and educational needs.\n\n===Invisible model minority: Africans ===\n[[African immigration to the United States|African immigrants and Americans born to African immigrants]] have been described as an \"Invisible Model Minority\" mainly due to their high degree of success in the United States, but due to misconceptions and stereotypes{{clarify|date=September 2015}} of them, their success has not been acknowledged by the greater American society and other Western societies and thus they are \"invisible\".<ref name=BlackModelMinority3>{{cite web|title=Black Immigrants, An Invisible 'Model Minority'|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/03/black_immigrants_an_invisible.html|publisher=Realclearpolitics.com|accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref><ref name=BlackInvisibleModel4>{{cite web|title=Black African Migration to the United States| url=http://www.migrationpolicy.org/pubs/africanmigrationus.pdf|publisher=Migrationpolicy.org|accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref>  The invisibility of the success of Africans was touched upon by Dr. Kefa M.

In 2007, 27 percent of the U.S. population aged 25 and older had a four-year degree or more; 10 percent had a master's, doctorate, or professional degree. Immigrants from several Anglophone African countries were among the best educated: a majority of Black Immigrants from Nigeria, Cameroon, Uganda, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe had at least a four-year degree. Immigrants from Egypt, where the official language is Arabic, were also among the best educated.<ref name=BlackAfricanMigration2/> The overrepresentation of the highly skilled among U.S. immigrants is particularly striking for several of\nAfrica's largest source countries. The United States was the destination for 59 percent of Nigeria's highly skilled immigrants along with 47 percent of those from Ghana and 29 percent from Kenya.<ref name=BlackAfricanMigration2/>\n\nThe average annual personal income of African immigrants is about $26,000, nearly $2,000 more than that of workers born in the U.S. This might be because 71 percent of the Africans 16 years and older are working, compared to 64 percent of Americans. This is believed to be due larger percentage of African immigrants have higher educational qualifications than Americans, which results in higher per capita incomes for African immigrants and Americans born to African immigrants.<ref name=AfricanImmigrantSuccess4/>\n\nOutside of educational success specific groups have found economic success and have made many contributions to American society such as [[Ugandan American]]s.

For example, it is claimed they often integrate into American society more successfully and at higher rates than other immigrants groups due to social factors. One being that many African immigrants have strong English skills even before entering the U.S., many African nations, particularly former [[British colonies]], use English as a [[lingua franca]].<ref name=BlackAfricanMigration2/> Because of this, many African immigrants to the U.S. are bilingual. Overall, 70 percent of Black African immigrants either speak English as their primary language or speak another language but are also fluent in English. Compare this to 48% ''proficiency'' in English for other immigrant groups.\n\nKefa M. Otiso has proposed another reason for the success of African immigrants, saying that they have a \"high work ethic, focus and a drive to succeed that is honed and crafted by the fact that there are limited socioeconomic opportunities in their native African countries,\" says Otiso.<ref name=AfricanImmigrantSuccess4>{{cite web|title=Study Examines Success of African Immigrans|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/mc/news/2008/news48744.html|publisher=Bgsu.edu|accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Selective immigration====\nAnother possible cause of the higher performance of African immigrants as a group is that they represent a small population here in America so those who are chosen to come here often come from a selective group of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African people]]. The relative difficulty of emigrating and immigrating into the United States has created a selective nature of the process with the U.S. often choosing the wealthier and more educated out of those with less resources, motivation or ability to immigrate.<ref name=BlackAfricanMigration2/>\n\n====Americans born to African immigrants====\nDespite African immigrants being highly educated many often find it hard to become employed in high level occupations. Most instead have to work in labor jobs to subsist and maintain a decent life. {{citation needed | reason = This claim requires evidence. | date = May 2016 }} Often it is left to their children to take up these higher positions. This desire to succeed is then transferred onto second generation African immigrants. These Americans often report that their families pushed them very hard to strive for [https://web.archive.org/web/20130726181401/http://success/ success] and overachieve in many aspects of society, especially education. African immigrants put a premium on education because of the limited socioeconomic opportunities they experienced in their native countries.

Indos formed the vast majority of the European legal class in the colony. When in the second half of the 20th century the independent [[Republic of Indonesia]] was established, the majority of Europeans, including the Indo-Europeans,<ref>{{cite book|author=Gouda, Frances |title=Dutch Culture Overseas: Colonial Practice in the Netherlands Indies 1900-1942.|publisher=Equinox|date=2008|isbn=978-979-3780-62-7|page=173|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nN6G-lMk_DEC|accessdate=2015-02-24}}</ref> were expelled from the newly established country.\n\n===Repatriation===\nFrom 1945 to 1949 the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] turned the former Dutch East Indies into an increasingly hostile environment for Indo-Europeans. Violence aimed towards Indo-Europeans during its early [[Bersiap]] period (1945\u20131946) accumulated in almost 20,000 deaths.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tongtong.nl/indische-school/contentdownloads/bussemaker_bersiap.pdf |title=Geschiedenis : Dr. H.

Even though most Indos had never set foot in the Netherlands before, this  emigration was named ''repatriation''.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that Indos in the former colony of the Dutch East Indies were officially part of the European legal class and were formally considered to be Dutch nationals, the Dutch government practiced an official policy of discouragement with regard to the post-WWII repatriation of Indos to the Netherlands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geschiedenis24.nl/speler.program.7028352.html |title=Spijtoptanten - NPO Geschiedenis |publisher=Geschiedenis24.nl |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}</ref> While Dutch policy was in fact aimed at stimulating Indos to give up Dutch citizenship and opt for Indonesian citizenship, simultaneously the young Indonesian Republic implemented policies increasingly intolerant towards anything remotely reminiscent of Dutch influence. Even though actual aggression against Indos decreased after the extreme violence of the [[Bersiap]] period, all Dutch (language) institutions, schools and businesses were gradually eliminated and public discrimination and racism against Indos in the Indonesian job market continued. In the end 98% of the original Indo community repatriated to their distant fatherland in Europe.<ref name=\"vanstockum.nl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vanstockum.nl/product/12299438/Van-Pasar-Malam-tot-'I-love-Indo'.html |title=Van Pasar Malam tot I love Indo |publisher=Vanstockum.nl |date=2010-01-01 |accessdate=2015-02-24}}</ref>\n\n===Integration===\nIn the 1990s and early 21st century the Netherlands was confronted with ethnic tension in a now [[Multiculturalism|multi-cultural]] society. Ethnic tensions, rooted in the perceived lack of social integration and rise of crime rates of several ethnic minorities, climaxed with the murders of politician [[Pim Fortuyn]] in 2002 and film director [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]] in 2004. In 2006 statistics show that in [[Rotterdam]], the second largest city in the country, close to 50% of the inhabitants were of foreign descent. The Indo community however is considered the best integrated ethnic and cultural minority in the Netherlands. Statistical data compiled by the CBS shows that Indos belong to the group with the lowest crime rates in the country.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120805075827/http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a741617440]</ref>\n\nA CBS study of 1999 reveals that of all foreign born groups living in the Netherlands, only the Indos have an average income similar to that of citizens born in the Netherlands. Job participation in government, education and health care is similar as well. Another recent CBS study, among foreign born citizens and their children living in the Netherlands in 2005, shows that on average, Indos own the largest number of independent enterprises. A 2007 CBS study shows that already over 50% of first-generation Indos have married a native born Dutch person.

Furthermore, the idea of the model minority pits minority groups against each other by implying that non-model groups are at fault for falling short of the model minority level of achievement and assimilation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Choi|first=Yoonsun|last2=Lahey|first2=Benjamin B.|date=2006-09-01|title=Testing the Model Minority Stereotype: Youth Behaviors across Racial and Ethnic Groups|journal=The Social Service Review|volume=80|issue=3|pages=419\u2013452|doi=10.1086/505288|issn=0037-7961|pmc=3093248|pmid=21572913}}</ref> \n\nThe concept has also been criticized by outlets such as NPR for potentially homogenizing the experiences of Asian Americans on one side and Hispanics and African Americans on the other, despite the different groups experiencing racism in different ways.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2017/04/19/524571669/model-minority-myth-again-used-as-a-racial-wedge-between-asians-and-blacks|title='Model Minority' Myth Again Used As A Racial Wedge Between Asians And Blacks|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-09-21}}</ref> It has been argued that the idea perpetuates the belief that any minority has the capability to rise economically without assistance and ignores the differences between the history of Asian Americans and African Americans, and sometimes Hispanics, in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.inheritancemag.com/article/the-model-minority-myth-and-the-wedge-between-black-and-white-america|title=The Model Minority Myth and the Wedge Between Black and White America [Updated] {{!}} Inheritance|work=Inheritance|access-date=2018-11-06}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of \"model minority\" is heavily associated with U.S. culture and is not extensively used outside the U.S., though many European countries have concepts of classism that stereotype ethnic groups in a similar manner to model minority.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.news18.com/news/india/sikhs-hindus-now-part-of-middle-class-britain-354653.html|title=Sikhs, Hindus now part of middle-class Britain|work=News18|access-date=2017-08-02}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nOne of the earliest uses of the term ''model minority'' was in the 9 January 1966 edition of ''The New York Times Magazine'' by sociologist William Petersen to describe Asian Americans as ethnic minorities who, despite [[marginalization]], have achieved success in the United States. In his essay called \"Success Story: Japanese American Style\", he wrote that the Japanese cultures have strong work ethics and family values. Furthermore, he wrote that those values prevent them from becoming a \"problem minority\". A similar article about Chinese Americans was published in ''U.S. News and World Report'' in December 1966.<ref>[http://www-mcnair.berkeley.edu/97Journal/Chu.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212130042/http://www-mcnair.berkeley.edu/97Journal/Chu.html|date=December 12, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Vernellia R.

This led many even within the Asian American community at the time to view it either as a welcomed positive stereotype in contrast to years of negative stereotypes, or as a euphemistic stereotype that was no more than a mere annoyance. They did not foresee the negative repercussions to come from this stereotype. Many critics point out that there are more positives than negatives that come with this stereotype while many others believe that there are just as many negatives that come with this stereotype as there are positives and that no stereotype regardless of how positive they try to be or how positive their connotations are should be regarded as a good stereotype.

Model Minorities are used as a tool to discriminate against Black people with the mantra \"If they can do it, why can't you?\". This argument is often viewed as logical, because at the surface, there doesn't seem to be a clear cut explanation for why Jews, Asians, and Irish people are able to thrive after experiencing racism, but Blacks still seem to be disenfranchised.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2017/04/19/524571669/model-minority-myth-again-used-as-a-racial-wedge-between-asians-and-blacks|title='Model Minority' Myth Again Used As A Racial Wedge Between Asians And Blacks|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-11-06}}</ref> \u00a0What this argument often ignores, is the unique experience of Black people in America, namely, they are the only minority who had been enslaved on U.S. soil for centuries. Some scholars also explain the differing successes of Asian immigrants and Blacks on the specific types of racism they experience. Essentially racism in itself is not monolithic, and is perpetrated in different ways and different arenas of life, some arenas where anti-Black rhetoric exist prove to be more harmful to Black personhood than situations in which anti-Asian discrimination exists.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Media portrayal===\nMedia coverage of the increasing success of Asian Americans as a group began in the 1960s, reporting high average test scores and marks in school, winning national [[spelling bee]]s, and high levels of university attendance.\n\nIn 1988, the writer Philip K. Chiu identified the prevalence of the model minority stereotype in American media reports on Chinese Americans, and noted the contrast between that stereotype and what he observed as the reality of the Chinese American population, which was much more varied than the model minority stereotype in the media typically presented.<ref>Philip K. Chiu, \"ROSTRUM:  The myth of the model minority.\" U.S. News and World Report. May 16, 1988. p. 7.</ref>\n<blockquote>I am fed up with being stereotyped as either a subhuman or superhuman creature.

Many worked for low wages in the harshest conditions. Confucian values were not seen as a key to success.

It also implies Asians are a monolithic group, and ignores the fact that the most educated group of Asian immigrants in the U.S. are Indians, for whom [[Confucius]] is non-existent in their upbringing.<ref name=\"YananWang\"/> It has also been argued that self-selecting immigrants do not represent the actual Asian American population as a whole, nor the populations of their home countries. While 50 percent of Chinese immigrants in the U.S. have a bachelor's degree, only 5 percent of the population does in their native China.<ref name=\"YananWang\"/> Lastly, if Confucian culture played a vital part of Asian culture, Chinese immigrant children would perform consistently around the world, yet second-generation Chinese immigrants are the lowest academic achievers among immigrant groups in Spain, less than half are expected to graduate from middle school.<ref name=\"YananWang\"/>\n\n====Asian American status in affirmative action====\n{{See also|Affirmative action|Asian quota}}\n\nIn the 1980s, one [[Ivy League]] school found evidence it had limited admissions of Asian American students.

Chang: The reference to Asian Americans as model minorities has to do with the work ethic, respect for elders, and high valuation of education, family and elders present in their culture. The model minority stereotype also comes with an underlying notion of their apoliticality. Such a label one-dimensionalizes Asian Americans as having only traits based around stereotypes and no other human qualities, such as vocal leadership, negative emotions (e.g. anger or sadness), sociopolitical activeness, risk taking, ability to learn from mistakes, desire for creative expression, intolerance towards oppression or being overlooked of their acknowledgements and successes. Asian Americans are labeled as model minorities because they have not been as much of a \"threat\" to the U.S. political establishment as blacks, due to a smaller population and less political advocacy. This label seeks to suppress potential political activism through euphemistic stereotyping.<ref>{{cite book |last=Chang |first=Gordon |date=2002 |title=Asian Americans and Politics: Perspectives, Experiences, Prospects |url=https://archive.org/details/asianamericanspo00chan |url-access=registration |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=9780804742016 }}</ref>\n\nAnother effect of the stereotype is that American society may tend to ignore the racism and discrimination Asian Americans still face. Complaints are dismissed with the claim that the racism which occurs to Asian Americans is less important than or not as bad as the racism faced by other minority races, thus establishing a systematic [[racial hierarchy]].  Believing that due to their success and that they possess so-called \"positive\" stereotypes, many{{who|date=June 2013}} assume they face no forms of racial discrimination or social issues in the greater American society, and that their community is fine, having \"gained\" social and economic equality.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yellow Face: The documentary part 4 - Asian Americans do face racism|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TOYT4JTea4|publisher=Youtube.com|accessdate=24 February 2013|date=5 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Asians, Blacks, Stereotypes and the Media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqShFjk6BoE|publisher=Youtube.com|accessdate=24 February 2013|date=5 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Racial Microaggressions and the Asian American Experience|url=http://psy6129.alliant.wikispaces.net/file/view/Sue,+Bucerri+et+al.+2007.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112140608/http://psy6129.alliant.wikispaces.net/file/view/Sue,+Bucerri+et+al.+2007.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=12 January 2012|publisher=Psy6129.alliant.wikispaces.net|accessdate=11 November 2013|date=5 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nRacial discrimination can take subtle forms such as through [[microaggression]].

For instance, discrimination and model minority stereotyping are linked to Asian American students' lower valuing of school, lower self-esteem, and higher depressive symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kiang|first1=Lisa|title=Model Minority Stereotyping, Perceived Discrimination, and Adjustment Among Adolescents from Asian American Backgrounds.|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|date=2016|volume=45|issue=7|pages=1366\u20131379|doi=10.1007/s10964-015-0336-7|pmid=26251100}}</ref> Furthermore, the psychological distress of failing to meet the model minority image, such as feelings of inadequacy, self-doubt, shame, and embarrassment, is exacerbated due to the differential treatment associated with being stereotyped as a model minority and [[perpetual foreigner]].\n\nFurthermore, the model minority image can be a threat to underachieving Asian American students' academic experience and educational advancement. It promotes invisibility and disguises the academic barriers and psychological problems students may encounter. This is problematic because it creates a barrier for educators to better understand and assist struggling students' educational and mental health needs in order to optimize students' academic experience and social emotional development.\n\nAsian Americans may also be commonly stereotyped by the general public as being studious, intelligent, successful, elitist, brand name conscious, yet paradoxically passive. As a result, higher and unreasonable expectations are often associated with Asian Americans.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Also due to the model minority image, Asian American students are viewed as \"problem-free\" and academically competent students who can succeed with little support and without special services.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Guofang|title=Other People's Success: Impact of the \"Model Minority\" Myth on Underachieving Asian Students in North America|journal=KEDI Journal of Educational Policy|date=2005|volume=2|issue=1|pages=69\u201386}}</ref> This emphasis that Asian Americans are being denial by their racial reality because of the assumption that \"Asians are the new Whites\"; therefore, they are being dismissed by their intelligence and experiences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/ethnicity-health/asian-american/microaggressions-asians.pdf|title=Racial Microaggressions and the Asian American Experience|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Thus, educators may overlook the instructional needs and psychological concerns of underachieving Asian American students. The model minority stereotype can also contribute to teachers' having a \"blaming the victims\" perspective. This means that teachers blame students, their culture, or their families for students' poor performance or misbehavior in school. This is problematic because it shifts responsibility away from schools and teachers and misdirects attention away from finding a solution to improve students' learning experience and alleviate the situation. Furthermore, the model minority stereotype has a negative impact on the home environment. Parents' expectations place high pressure on students to achieve, creating a stressful, school-like home environment. Parents' expressed worry and frustration can also place emotional burdens and psychological stress on students.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nSome educators hold Asian students to a higher standard.<ref name=\"asianamericanissues1\"/> This deprives those students with [[learning disabilities]] from being given attention that they need.

It is a threat to Asian American students' academic experience and can disguise students' educational and mental health needs. Psychological distress from model minority stereotyping is related to the stressors associated with the pressure to succeed, differential treatment, and embarrassment or shame to seek help. With this information, a recommendation for schools is to promote a more inclusive and less competitive learning environment, so students will not be ashamed and afraid to ask for help. Administrators can also improve school climate by monitoring incidents of racial harassment and discrimination.

In 2007, 27 percent of the U.S. population aged 25 and older had a four-year degree or more; 10 percent had a master's, doctorate, or professional degree. Immigrants from several Anglophone African countries were among the best educated: a majority of Black Immigrants from Nigeria, Cameroon, Uganda, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe had at least a four-year degree. Immigrants from Egypt, where the official language is Arabic, were also among the best educated.<ref name=BlackAfricanMigration2/> The overrepresentation of the highly skilled among U.S. immigrants is particularly striking for several of\nAfrica's largest source countries. The United States was the destination for 59 percent of Nigeria's highly skilled immigrants along with 47 percent of those from Ghana and 29 percent from Kenya.<ref name=BlackAfricanMigration2/>\n\nThe average annual personal income of African immigrants is about $26,000, nearly $2,000 more than that of workers born in the U.S. This might be because 71 percent of the Africans 16 years and older are working, compared to 64 percent of Americans. This is believed to be due larger percentage of African immigrants have higher educational qualifications than Americans, which results in higher per capita incomes for African immigrants and Americans born to African immigrants.<ref name=AfricanImmigrantSuccess4/>\n\nOutside of educational success specific groups have found economic success and have made many contributions to American society such as [[Ugandan American]]s. Recent statistics indicate that Ugandans have become one of the country's biggest contributors to the economy, their contribution, amounting to US$1 billion in annual remittances which are disproportionately large contributions despite a community and population of less than 13,000.<ref>{{cite news|author=Olivia Miller|date=November 26, 2008|url=http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Sr-Z/Ugandan-Americans.html|title=Everyculture:A Countries and Their Cultures: Ugandan Americans|publisher= Everyculture: Countries and their cultures|accessdate= May 25, 2010 <!--to 23:00-->}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Total ancestry categories tallied for people with one or more ancestry categories reported 2010 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_1YR_B04003&prodType=table|archive-url=https://archive.today/20150118121537/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_1YR_B04003&prodType=table|url-status=dead|archive-date=18 January 2015|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfrican immigrants like many other immigrant groups are likely to establish and find success in small businesses.

For example, it is claimed they often integrate into American society more successfully and at higher rates than other immigrants groups due to social factors. One being that many African immigrants have strong English skills even before entering the U.S., many African nations, particularly former [[British colonies]], use English as a [[lingua franca]].<ref name=BlackAfricanMigration2/> Because of this, many African immigrants to the U.S. are bilingual. Overall, 70 percent of Black African immigrants either speak English as their primary language or speak another language but are also fluent in English. Compare this to 48% ''proficiency'' in English for other immigrant groups.\n\nKefa M. Otiso has proposed another reason for the success of African immigrants, saying that they have a \"high work ethic, focus and a drive to succeed that is honed and crafted by the fact that there are limited socioeconomic opportunities in their native African countries,\" says Otiso.<ref name=AfricanImmigrantSuccess4>{{cite web|title=Study Examines Success of African Immigrans|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/mc/news/2008/news48744.html|publisher=Bgsu.edu|accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Selective immigration====\nAnother possible cause of the higher performance of African immigrants as a group is that they represent a small population here in America so those who are chosen to come here often come from a selective group of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African people]]. The relative difficulty of emigrating and immigrating into the United States has created a selective nature of the process with the U.S. often choosing the wealthier and more educated out of those with less resources, motivation or ability to immigrate.<ref name=BlackAfricanMigration2/>\n\n====Americans born to African immigrants====\nDespite African immigrants being highly educated many often find it hard to become employed in high level occupations. Most instead have to work in labor jobs to subsist and maintain a decent life. {{citation needed | reason = This claim requires evidence. | date = May 2016 }} Often it is left to their children to take up these higher positions. This desire to succeed is then transferred onto second generation African immigrants. These Americans often report that their families pushed them very hard to strive for [https://web.archive.org/web/20130726181401/http://success/ success] and overachieve in many aspects of society, especially education. African immigrants put a premium on education because of the limited socioeconomic opportunities they experienced in their native countries. Consequently, they often allocate more resources towards it.\n\nThis pushing of second generation African immigrants by their parents has proven to be the key factor in their success, and a combination of family support and the emphasis of family unit has given these citizens social and psychological stability which makes them strive even further for success in many aspects of their daily life and society.<ref name=AfricanAchieversUS7>{{cite web|title=Africans highest achievers in U.S. universities |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfZXZWF_kO8|publisher=Youtube.com|accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nMany of these American groups have thus transplanted high cultural emphasis on education and work ethic into their cultures which can be seen in the cultures<ref name=AfricanAchieversUS7/> of [[Algerian Americans]], [[Kenyan Americans]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Ha-La/Kenyan-Americans.html |title=Kenyan Americans - History, Modern era, Significant immigration waves, Acculturation and Assimilation |publisher=Everyculture.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}</ref> [[Sierra Leonean American]]s,<ref>{{cite web |author=Francesca Hampton |year=2010 |url=http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Pa-Sp/Sierra-Leonean-Americans.html |title=Sierra Leonean Americans |website=Countries and Their Cultures }}</ref> [[Ghanaian Americans]], [[Malawian American]]s,<ref>Dixon, D.

Indos formed the vast majority of the European legal class in the colony.

Violence aimed towards Indo-Europeans during its early [[Bersiap]] period (1945\u20131946) accumulated in almost 20,000 deaths.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tongtong.nl/indische-school/contentdownloads/bussemaker_bersiap.pdf |title=Geschiedenis : Dr. H.

Even though most Indos had never set foot in the Netherlands before, this  emigration was named ''repatriation''.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that Indos in the former colony of the Dutch East Indies were officially part of the European legal class and were formally considered to be Dutch nationals, the Dutch government practiced an official policy of discouragement with regard to the post-WWII repatriation of Indos to the Netherlands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geschiedenis24.nl/speler.program.7028352.html |title=Spijtoptanten - NPO Geschiedenis |publisher=Geschiedenis24.nl |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}</ref> While Dutch policy was in fact aimed at stimulating Indos to give up Dutch citizenship and opt for Indonesian citizenship, simultaneously the young Indonesian Republic implemented policies increasingly intolerant towards anything remotely reminiscent of Dutch influence. Even though actual aggression against Indos decreased after the extreme violence of the [[Bersiap]] period, all Dutch (language) institutions, schools and businesses were gradually eliminated and public discrimination and racism against Indos in the Indonesian job market continued. In the end 98% of the original Indo community repatriated to their distant fatherland in Europe.<ref name=\"vanstockum.nl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vanstockum.nl/product/12299438/Van-Pasar-Malam-tot-'I-love-Indo'.html |title=Van Pasar Malam tot I love Indo |publisher=Vanstockum.nl |date=2010-01-01 |accessdate=2015-02-24}}</ref>\n\n===Integration===\nIn the 1990s and early 21st century the Netherlands was confronted with ethnic tension in a now [[Multiculturalism|multi-cultural]] society. Ethnic tensions, rooted in the perceived lack of social integration and rise of crime rates of several ethnic minorities, climaxed with the murders of politician [[Pim Fortuyn]] in 2002 and film director [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]] in 2004. In 2006 statistics show that in [[Rotterdam]], the second largest city in the country, close to 50% of the inhabitants were of foreign descent. The Indo community however is considered the best integrated ethnic and cultural minority in the Netherlands. Statistical data compiled by the CBS shows that Indos belong to the group with the lowest crime rates in the country.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120805075827/http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a741617440]</ref>\n\nA CBS study of 1999 reveals that of all foreign born groups living in the Netherlands, only the Indos have an average income similar to that of citizens born in the Netherlands. Job participation in government, education and health care is similar as well. Another recent CBS study, among foreign born citizens and their children living in the Netherlands in 2005, shows that on average, Indos own the largest number of independent enterprises. A 2007 CBS study shows that already over 50% of first-generation Indos have married a native born Dutch person.

There was presumably a bath-house belonging to the 4th-century fort. The Roman baths incorporated a reused inscription of the Gallic Emperor [[Postumus]], dating from AD 262\u2013266. The 3rd-century fort was garrisoned by the ''ala Sebosiana'' and the ''numerus Barcariorum Tigrisiensium''.<ref>Birley, CW- XXXIX, p. 222.</ref>\n\nThe ancient ''Wery Wall'' was identified in 1950 as the north wall of the 4th-century fort, which constituted a drastic remodelling of the 3rd-century one, while retaining the same orientation. Exceptionally the later fort is the only example in north-west Britain of a 4th-century type, with massive curtain-wall and projecting bastions typical of the ''Saxon Shore'' or in Wales. The extension of this technique as far north as Lancaster shows that the coast between Cumberland and North Wales was not left defenceless after the attacks on the west coast and the disaster in the [[Carausian Revolt]] of AD 296, following on from those under [[Clodius Albinus|Albinus]] in AD 197.\n\nThe fort underwent a few more extensions, and at its largest area it was {{convert|9|-|10|acres|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>Shotter, p. 14.</ref> The evidence suggests that the fort remained active up to the end of [[Roman occupation of Britain]] in the early 5th century.<ref>Shotter, p. 27.</ref>\n\nLittle is known about Lancaster between the end of Roman rule in Britain in the early 5th century and the Norman Conquest in the late 11th century. Despite a lack of documentation from the period, it is likely that Lancaster was still inhabited. Lancaster was on the fringes of the kingdoms of [[Mercia]] and [[Northumbria]], and over time, control may have changed from one to the other.<ref>{{harvnb |White |2001 |p=33}}</ref> Archaeological evidence suggests there was a monastery on or near the site of today's [[Lancaster Priory]] by the 700s or 800s. For example, an Anglo-Saxon [[Runes|runic]] cross found at the Priory in 1807, known as \"Cynibald's cross\", is thought to have been made in the late 9th century. Lancaster was probably one of the numerous monasteries founded under [[Wilfrid]].<ref>White, p. 34.</ref>\n\n===Medieval===\n[[File:Lancaster in 1728.jpg|thumb|Lancaster in 1728]]\nFollowing the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066, Lancaster fell under the control of [[William the Conqueror|William I]], as stated in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, which is the earliest known mention of Lancaster in any document.

Lancaster Castle is well known as the site of the [[Pendle witch trials]] in 1612. It was said that the court based in the castle (the Lancaster [[Assizes]]) sentenced more people to be [[hanging|hanged]] than any other in the country outside [[London]], earning Lancaster the nickname, ''\"the Hanging Town\"''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/lancast.html |title=Lancaster Castle|publisher=}}</ref> Lancaster also figured prominently in the suppression of Catholicism during the reformation with the execution of at least eleven Catholic priests.

These names derive from the emblems of the Royal Duchies of [[Duchy of Lancaster|Lancaster]] and [[Duke of York|York]] in the 15th century. This erupted into a [[civil war]] over rival claims to the throne during the [[Wars of the Roses]].\n\nIn more recent times, the term ''\"Wars of the Roses\"'' has been applied to rivalry in sports between teams representing [[Lancashire]] and [[Yorkshire]], not just the cities of Lancaster and [[York]].

The former [[City]] and [[Municipal Borough]] of Lancaster and the [[Morecambe and Heysham|Municipal Borough of Morecambe and Heysham]] along with other authorities merged in 1974 to form the [[City of Lancaster|District of Lancaster]] within the [[shire county]] of Lancashire. This was given [[city status in the United Kingdom]] and Lancaster City Council is the local governing body for the district. Lancaster is an [[unparished area]] and has no separate council. It is divided into wards such as Bulk, Castle, Ellel, John O'Gaunt (named after [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster]]), [[Scotforth]] East, Scotforth West, [[Skerton]] East, Skerton West, and University and Scotforth Rural.\n\n===Political representation===\n<!-- Missing image removed: [[File:Lancaster, Lancs coa.png|thumb|right|Coat of arms of Lancaster City Council.]] -->\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nMost of the city lies in the [[Lancaster and Fleetwood]] constituency for elections of Members of Parliament to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. The current MP for [[Lancaster and Fleetwood]] is [[Cat Smith]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].

In 2003, their influence waned and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] became the largest party on the council. They formed a coalition with the LibDems and Greens. At the May 2007 local elections, Labour lost ground to the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green]]s in Lancaster and the MBIs in Morecambe, resulting in [[no overall control]], with all parties represented in a PR administration. The 2011 elections saw Labour emerge as the largest party. They reached a joint administrative arrangement with the Greens.\n\nThe [[2019 Lancaster City Council election]] result saw no party in overall control. The Council is run by a coalition of Labour, Green and Liberal Democrat parties with Conservatives and Independents in opposition. At 10 seats, Lancaster has one of the largest Green Party representations in the country.\n\n==Geography==\nLancaster is the most northerly city in Lancashire, lying three miles ({{convert|3|mi|abbr=on|disp=output only}}) inland from [[Morecambe Bay]] on the [[River Lune]] (from which it derives its name), and the [[Lancaster Canal]].

There was presumably a bath-house belonging to the 4th-century fort. The Roman baths incorporated a reused inscription of the Gallic Emperor [[Postumus]], dating from AD 262\u2013266. The 3rd-century fort was garrisoned by the ''ala Sebosiana'' and the ''numerus Barcariorum Tigrisiensium''.<ref>Birley, CW- XXXIX, p. 222.</ref>\n\nThe ancient ''Wery Wall'' was identified in 1950 as the north wall of the 4th-century fort, which constituted a drastic remodelling of the 3rd-century one, while retaining the same orientation. Exceptionally the later fort is the only example in north-west Britain of a 4th-century type, with massive curtain-wall and projecting bastions typical of the ''Saxon Shore'' or in Wales. The extension of this technique as far north as Lancaster shows that the coast between Cumberland and North Wales was not left defenceless after the attacks on the west coast and the disaster in the [[Carausian Revolt]] of AD 296, following on from those under [[Clodius Albinus|Albinus]] in AD 197.\n\nThe fort underwent a few more extensions, and at its largest area it was {{convert|9|-|10|acres|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>Shotter, p. 14.</ref> The evidence suggests that the fort remained active up to the end of [[Roman occupation of Britain]] in the early 5th century.<ref>Shotter, p. 27.</ref>\n\nLittle is known about Lancaster between the end of Roman rule in Britain in the early 5th century and the Norman Conquest in the late 11th century. Despite a lack of documentation from the period, it is likely that Lancaster was still inhabited. Lancaster was on the fringes of the kingdoms of [[Mercia]] and [[Northumbria]], and over time, control may have changed from one to the other.<ref>{{harvnb |White |2001 |p=33}}</ref> Archaeological evidence suggests there was a monastery on or near the site of today's [[Lancaster Priory]] by the 700s or 800s. For example, an Anglo-Saxon [[Runes|runic]] cross found at the Priory in 1807, known as \"Cynibald's cross\", is thought to have been made in the late 9th century. Lancaster was probably one of the numerous monasteries founded under [[Wilfrid]].<ref>White, p. 34.</ref>\n\n===Medieval===\n[[File:Lancaster in 1728.jpg|thumb|Lancaster in 1728]]\nFollowing the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066, Lancaster fell under the control of [[William the Conqueror|William I]], as stated in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, which is the earliest known mention of Lancaster in any document. The founding charter of the Priory, dated 1094, is the first known document which is specific to Lancaster.<ref name=\"White, p. 57\">White, p. 57.</ref> By this time William had given Lancaster and its surrounding region to [[Roger the Poitevin|Roger de Poitou]]. This document also suggests that the monastery had been refounded as a parish church at some point before 1066.<ref name=\"White, p. 57\"/>\n\nLancaster became a [[Ancient borough|borough]] in 1193 under [[Richard I of England|King Richard I]]. Its first [[Municipal charter|charter]], dated 12 June 1193, was from [[John, King of England|John]], [[List of counts of Mortain|Count of Mortain]], who later became King of England.<ref>White, p. 35.</ref>\n[[File:DV342 Lancaster from the south.png|thumb|Lancaster from the south in 1825]]\n[[Lancaster Castle]], partly built in the 13th century and enlarged by [[Elizabeth I]], stands on the site of a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[garrison]]. Lancaster Castle is well known as the site of the [[Pendle witch trials]] in 1612. It was said that the court based in the castle (the Lancaster [[Assizes]]) sentenced more people to be [[hanging|hanged]] than any other in the country outside [[London]], earning Lancaster the nickname, ''\"the Hanging Town\"''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/lancast.html |title=Lancaster Castle|publisher=}}</ref> Lancaster also figured prominently in the suppression of Catholicism during the reformation with the execution of at least eleven Catholic priests. A memorial to the [[Lancaster Martyrs]] is located close to the city centre.\n\n[[File:Lancaster from Lune Bank, Skerton.jpg|thumb|Lancaster in the 19th century]]\nThe traditional emblem for the [[House of Lancaster]] is a red rose, the [[Red Rose of Lancaster]], similar to that of the [[House of York]], which is a white rose. These names derive from the emblems of the Royal Duchies of [[Duchy of Lancaster|Lancaster]] and [[Duke of York|York]] in the 15th century. This erupted into a [[civil war]] over rival claims to the throne during the [[Wars of the Roses]].\n\nIn more recent times, the term ''\"Wars of the Roses\"'' has been applied to rivalry in sports between teams representing [[Lancashire]] and [[Yorkshire]], not just the cities of Lancaster and [[York]].

The former [[City]] and [[Municipal Borough]] of Lancaster and the [[Morecambe and Heysham|Municipal Borough of Morecambe and Heysham]] along with other authorities merged in 1974 to form the [[City of Lancaster|District of Lancaster]] within the [[shire county]] of Lancashire. This was given [[city status in the United Kingdom]] and Lancaster City Council is the local governing body for the district. Lancaster is an [[unparished area]] and has no separate council. It is divided into wards such as Bulk, Castle, Ellel, John O'Gaunt (named after [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster]]), [[Scotforth]] East, Scotforth West, [[Skerton]] East, Skerton West, and University and Scotforth Rural.\n\n===Political representation===\n<!-- Missing image removed: [[File:Lancaster, Lancs coa.png|thumb|right|Coat of arms of Lancaster City Council.]] -->\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nMost of the city lies in the [[Lancaster and Fleetwood]] constituency for elections of Members of Parliament to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. The current MP for [[Lancaster and Fleetwood]] is [[Cat Smith]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. The Skerton part of the city lies in the [[Morecambe and Lunesdale]] constituency represented by [[David Morris (Conservative politician)|David Morris]] of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].\n\nBefore [[Brexit]], it was in the [[North West England (European Parliament constituency)|North West England]] European Parliamentary Constituency.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early first decade of the 21st century, the city council was under the control of the [[Morecambe Bay Independents]] (MBIs), who campaigned for an independent Morecambe council. In 2003, their influence waned and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] became the largest party on the council. They formed a coalition with the LibDems and Greens. At the May 2007 local elections, Labour lost ground to the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green]]s in Lancaster and the MBIs in Morecambe, resulting in [[no overall control]], with all parties represented in a PR administration. The 2011 elections saw Labour emerge as the largest party. They reached a joint administrative arrangement with the Greens.\n\nThe [[2019 Lancaster City Council election]] result saw no party in overall control. The Council is run by a coalition of Labour, Green and Liberal Democrat parties with Conservatives and Independents in opposition. At 10 seats, Lancaster has one of the largest Green Party representations in the country.\n\n==Geography==\nLancaster is the most northerly city in Lancashire, lying three miles ({{convert|3|mi|abbr=on|disp=output only}}) inland from [[Morecambe Bay]] on the [[River Lune]] (from which it derives its name), and the [[Lancaster Canal]].

It also has [[Academy (English school)|academy]] status. Old students belong to The Old Lancastrians. It is one of England's 36 [[List of state boarding schools in England and Wales|state boarding schools]]. The school has a sixth form for girls, which commenced in 2019.<ref name=\"lrgs.org.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.lrgs.org.uk/news/2017/sixth-form-will-open-for-girls|title=Sixth Form will open for girls - LRGS|website=www.lrgs.org.uk|access-date=15 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216034429/https://www.lrgs.org.uk/news/2017/sixth-form-will-open-for-girls|archive-date=16 December 2017|url-status = live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> LRGS is also in the [[United Kingdom]]\u2019s thirty oldest schools.\n\n== History ==\nThe school was founded between 1235\u20131256, probably nearer to the former, and was later endowed as a free school by John Gardyner.<ref>A.L. Murray. The Royal Grammar School Lancaster. A History. Heffer 1951.</ref>\nThe first definite mention of the old grammar school is found in a deed dated 4 August 1469, when the Abbess of Syon granted to John Gardyner, of [[Bailrigg]] (near Lancaster), a lease of a water-mill on the [[River Lune]] and some land nearby for two hundred years to maintain a chaplain to celebrate worship in the Church of St. Mary, [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], and to instruct boys in grammar freely, \"unless perchance something shall be voluntarily offered by their friends\".\n\nIn 1472, John Gardyner's will made further provisions for the endowment of the school, and also for William Baxstonden to keep the school so long as he could teach the students. In 1682, the school was rebuilt and in 1852 was removed from the old site on the slopes by the priory to the outskirts of the city, where it now stands (though the city has expanded beyond it).\n\nThis building (now known as Old School House), which stands on the north side of East Road, was designed by the local architects [[Sharpe and Paley]] at a cost of \u00a38,000 ({{Inflation|UK|8000|1852|r=-4|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}<ref name=pev>{{Citation | last =Hartwell| first =Clare| authorlink = | last2 = Pevsner | first2 = Nikolaus | author2-link =Nikolaus Pevsner| series= The Buildings of England| title =Lancashire: North |edition= | publisher =[[Yale University Press]] | year =2009 | origyear=1969 | location = New Haven and London| pages = 410\u2013411|  isbn = 978-0-300-12667-9}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | last = Brandwood| first = Geoff| author-link = | last2 = Austin| first2 = Tim| last3 = Hughes| first3 = John| last4 = Price| first4 = James| year = 2012| title = The Architecture of Sharpe, Paley and Austin|  publication-place = Swindon| place = | publisher = [[English Heritage]]| pages = 215\u2013216| isbn = 978-1-84802-049-8}}</ref> The foundation stone was laid on 5 May 1851 by [[James Prince Lee|Rt&nbsp;Revd&nbsp;James Prince Lee]], the [[Bishop of Manchester]].<ref>{{Citation | last = Hughes| first = John M.| author-link = | publication-date = | date = | year = 2010| title = Edmund Sharpe: Man of Lancaster| edition = | volume = | series = | publication-place = | place = | publisher = John M.

The charities are selected by the Seward Committee where students propose and select which organisations to donate money to, generally two local, two national and two international charities. All students take part in a yearly set run and are encouraged to collect sponsorship donations, helping raise up to \u00a320,000 in a year. Not all the income comes from the run, though, as students organise a large variety of events amongst which are cake sales, raffles and even a teachers' version of the BBC Radio 4 panel show ''Just a Minute'', organised by the Whewell Society.\n\nWhen the national anthem is sung at events such as Founders' Day, the second line is changed to \"[[Long live our noble Duke]]\" in recognition of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]]. Duke is kept irrespective of whether the ruling Monarch is male or female; thus Queen Elizabeth II is known by tradition as the Duke of Lancaster, not Duchess.\n\nUntil September 2015, LRGS used the more traditional '1st year, 2nd year, 3rd year...' system for naming years, rather than the modern 'Year 7, 8, 9...' system - a tradition that had been in place since the 1973/74 academic year. The tradition came under threat in May 2015, when some of the school's teachers made it clear that they would rather use the modern system, to avoid confusion when communicating with other schools and organisations using that system. An online petition was set up, garnering over a thousand signatures from students, teachers and Old Lancastrians. The change was also opposed by the senior prefect team. However, at the start of the next academic year (2015/16), the school officially changed to the modern system, despite the considerable opposition.\n\nFor a period the school ran a preparatory department, which was located in Gardyner House as was officially \"Form 1\". Although this closed in the 1950s it was not until 1973 that the year groups were renumbered - prior to September that year year groups were numbered 2, 3, 4, Shell (abbreviated to \"Sh\") and 5 (followed by Lower, Middle and Upper Sixth). Other traditions that ended in the 1970s were the singing of the school song (before 1972 - but still sung at Old Lancastrian meetings. It was also temporarily sung in 2012 at the occasional first year assembly.), the requirement to wear a school cap (ended from 1972/3 - though they were still on sale until 1979), shorts for junior boarders (which was also abolished in September 1973), and houses for day-students (which were wound up sometime in the late 1970s, probably around 1978 or 1979, in fact somewhat petering out rather than being formally abolished.\n\n== Academic ==\n\nThe school is regularly one of the strongest state schools both regionally and nationally. In 2019,  students achieved top A and A* grades in more than half of all the A level exams that they sat. Over 75% of all results were graded A*, A or B.\n[http://www.education.gov.uk/cgi-bin/schools/performance/school.pl?urn=136742] Over 90% of students go on to further education and on average a dozen gain places at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] Universities.\n\nThe 2007 [[Ofsted]] report stated that \"this is an outstanding school that provides very good value for money. The overwhelming majority of parents value greatly the school and its impact on their children.\"\n\nIn 2005 just under three-quarters of A-level entries resulted in grades A or B (excluding General Studies) while at GCSE three-quarters of all grades were A* or A, with nearly all pupils gaining 10 passes and five pupils gaining a clean sweep of A* grades. In 2011 the A*-C grade was over 95%, only 1% below its counterpart Lancaster Girls' Grammar school.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/education/07/school_tables/secondary_schools/html/888_5401.stm |title=BBC league table |publisher=BBC News |date=10 January 2008 |accessdate=6 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115122005/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/education/07/school_tables/secondary_schools/html/888_5401.stm |archive-date=15 January 2009 |url-status = live|df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Boarding ==\n\nLRGS is a [[List of state boarding schools in England and Wales|state boarding school]] with four boarding houses (Storey, Frankland, Ashton and School Houses) and 170 boarders. The majority of boarders come from the northwest of England; others come from across the UK and overseas. Ofsted inspectors found boarding to be Outstanding in all categories in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boarding.org.uk/media/news/article/32/LRGS-boarding-is-Outstanding |title=LRGS boarding is outstanding |publisher=Boarding Schools Association |date=14 June 2013 |accessdate=8 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309030147/http://www.boarding.org.uk/media/news/article/32/LRGS-boarding-is-Outstanding |archive-date=9 March 2014 |url-status = live|df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== School Societies ==\n\nLRGS is home to a wide range of student run societies, including a Literature Society, History Society, Economics Society, STEM Club, Labour Students Society, Bad Boyz Baking Club, Warhammer Club, Conservative Club, Armchair Generals, Beginners\u2019 Mandarin, German Club, MFL Film Club, Duke of Edinburgh's award, and the Whewell Society (A more comprehensive list can be found [https://www.lrgs.org.uk/page/?title=Extra+Curricular+Activities%2C+Clubs+and+Societies&pid=184 here]). The Whewell Society, named in honour of [[William Whewell]], an old student, was founded in 1908 and is the oldest continuous society in the school. It was founded by the sixth form as a society to promote the arts, music and debate. Since the 1950s, the society has been purely a debating society and has enjoyed success in competitions. It debates a mixture of heavy motions (such as 'This House Would Criminalise Abortion in the UK') and lighter ones (for example, This House Believes Tea is Better Than Coffee'). It continues to thrive under student leadership.\n\n== Sport ==\nThe school offers a wide range of sporting activities to the students throughout their school careers including tennis, sailing, swimming, rowing, cross country running etc. but remains a bastion of rugby union. Achievement in this code is generally accorded more prominence in school life than other activities but the school has achieved more notable success in rowing and cross country running, especially when their far lower budgets are taken into account. Nonetheless, the school has produced some notable figures in rugby union such as the former England and Bath coach [[Brian Ashton (rugby player)|Brian Ashton]], former captain of Norway [[Erik Lund (rugby player)|Erik Lund]] and his brother the England international [[Magnus Lund]].\n\nFormer Pupils have achieved Olympic success. [[Jason Queally]], took track cycling gold in the 1&nbsp;km time trial at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] and [[Scott Durant]] won gold with the British Men's Eight in the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] (see [[#Boat Club|Boat Club]]).\n\nIn 2011, the LRGS lst XI won the Local Football Cup, beating Morecambe High School 1\u20130 at the Globe Arena with a fine performance from the entire squad.\n\nIn 2015 the U13s won  the Lancashire Cup Final against Audenshaw 20 points to 5\n\nIn 2012, the LRGS 1st XV reached the last 8 of the Rosslyn Park National 7s tournament and the U16s reached the last 32.\n\nIn 2010, the 1st XV, won the Lancashire Cup Final, and became champions in a hard-fought match against Merchant Taylor's Crosby, this achievement was followed by the U14s and the U15s who were victorious in finals against Merchant Taylor's Crosby and Manchester Grammar School, respectively.\n\nIn 2009, the U13s and U14s reached the finals of the Lancashire Cup, however both lost narrowly against Manchester Grammar School. In the 2008/2009 season, LRGS won the Lancashire schools cup in the U18s and the U13s as well as winning the Floodlit cup for Lancashire and Cheshire in the U16s. They also set a new record with four teams reaching the county finals. While, in 2007/2008 season, LRGS won the Lancashire Cup in the U15 and U16 age groups.\n\nIn recent years the school has enjoyed an improved reputation in cricket with recent highlights including the school's 1st XI Cricket team's narrow defeat in the Sir Garfield Sobers Tournament at The Kensington Oval Barbados in July 2011. The school achieved a victory over [[Charterhouse School]] in the final of the Lord's Taverners Cricketer Colts Trophy for Schools in 1999,<ref>[http://www.lordstaverners.org/whowehelp/ltcctrophy.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416081317/http://www.lordstaverners.org/whowehelp/ltcctrophy.asp |date=16 April 2007 }}</ref> and enjoyed a run to the semi final of the Daily Mail U18 Cup in 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lrgs.org.uk/?sp=1783 |title=Lancaster Royal Grammar School &#124; Boys' Grammar &#124; State Boarding |publisher=LRGS |date= |accessdate=6 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728135655/http://www.lrgs.org.uk/?sp=1783 |archive-date=28 July 2011 |url-status = live|df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, LRGS became the U19 and U16 district champions for table tennis.\n\n=== Boat Club ===\n\nLancaster Royal Grammar School Boat Club was founded in 1948.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = \n  | first = \n  | authorlink = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = British Rowing Almanack and ARA Year Book 2003\n  | publisher = The Amateur Rowing Association\n  | year = 2003\n  | location = Hammersmith, London\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/britishsportbibl0000coxr/page/369\n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | isbn = 978-0-7146-5251-1\n  | page = [https://archive.org/details/britishsportbibl0000coxr/page/369 369]\n  }}</ref>\nThey were tenants of [[Lancaster John O' Gaunt Rowing Club]] from 1985 to 2011.<ref name=\"lancasterrowing1\">{{cite web\n |last         = Sullivan\n |first        = Steven\n |coauthors    = \n |title        = History of Lancaster John O' Gaunt Rowing Club\n |work         = Lancaster John O'Gaunt Rowing Club website\n |pages        = \n |publisher    = \n |date         = \n |url          = http://lancasterrowing.co.uk/history.html\n |accessdate   = 8 April 2010\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100503045322/http://www.lancasterrowing.co.uk/history.html\n |archive-date = 3 May 2010\n |url-status   = live\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref> In 2011 the Boat Club relocated to Halton Army Training Camp.\n\nThe boat club  had 15 years of national success under Tim Lucas achieving medal success in either the [[Schools' Head of the River Race]], [[The National Schools Regatta]] or the [[National Rowing Championships]] for ten consecutive years from 1992 to 2002.<ref name=\"lancasterrowing1\"/> The club also made at least the final of a national event from 1992 to 2006.

However, the club has since obtained a new fleet of Kanghua boats and a larger boathouse.\n\n=== Cross Country Club===\n\nAlthough the school's main sports during the summer and winter are cricket and rugby respectively, in recent years, it is the school's cross country squad that has achieved the most recognition nationally. The school's rise to prominence began in the late 2000s under the coaching of Mr Andrew Yelland, with several LRGS athletes being chosen to represent Lancashire, at the English School's Cross Country. In 2009 for instance, the school had 6 County runners. In 2010 LRGS won the prestigious Northern School Cross Country Championships for the first time, and continued this feat in 2011 and 2012 \u2013 the latter being particularly special as LRGS were the victors in all 5 students' races. The school also won the famous Stonyhurst Invitation Race in 2011 and 2012, recorded a 5th-place finish in the National Schools Cross Country Relays in 2011, and a 3rd-place finish in the Intermediate Boys English Schools Cross Country Cup in the same year. The club also boasts the National Schools Senior Fell Running Champions from 2011, and several National medallists \u2013 Ben Akin was 2nd at the English Schools Intermediate Boys 800m in 2009, Beau Smith was 3rd at the English National Championships over 800m the following year, and Callum Mason was 3rd at the English Schools Mountain Running Championships in 2011.\n\n== Combined Cadet Force ==\n\nThe [[Combined Cadet Force]] (CCF) at LRGS comprises [[Royal Navy]], [[British Army|Army]] and [[Royal Air Force]] sections. Pupils in year nine and above are allowed to join. It parades on Tuesday afternoons after school and is voluntary. All sections participate in camps throughout the year, including an annual summer camp during the summer holidays, and an Easter camp involving adventurous training in which all three sections can participate. The Contingent, as of 2019 maintains around 200 members, and is led by a Cadet RSM, which can be drawn from any section.\nPast Regimental Sergeant Majors include:\nCadet RSM L. Wong (2014\u201315),\nCadet RSM B. Taylor (2015-2016),\nCadet RSM C. Tetlow (2016-2017),\nCadet RSM M. Blackett-Ord (2017-2018),\nCadet RSM E. Powell (2018-2019).\n\nThe School has had its own CCF since 1914, then known as the Officer Training Corps. Its roots, however, can be traced back further still, as there are \"references to the existence at Lancaster of a Cadet Volunteer Battalion in the early nineteenth century\".<ref name=\"Fidler\">Fidler, J., ''Lancaster Royal Grammar School: A History of the OTC & CCF''. York: G. H. Smith and Son, 2001. p. 1 {{ISBN|0-904775-27-5}}.</ref> and in 1861, the seventy-strong Battalion was presented with a silver bugle \"by Mrs Lee, wife of the Headmaster\".<ref name=\"Fidler\"/>\n\nThe Royal Navy Section consists of around 25 cadets, including girls from [[Lancaster Girls' Grammar School]], who have been participating since September 2012. The main activities offered are water-based, and the section often goes sailing on Marine Lake, Southport. Cadets in the Navy section also attend national camps and courses run by HQ CCF RN, on which cadets can gain nationally recognised qualifications in topics from power boating to first aid.<ref>http://www.hqccfrn.co.uk/courses.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523070451/http://www.hqccfrn.co.uk/courses.htm |date=23 May 2013 }} ''HQ CCF RN website''. Retrieved 7 January 2013.</ref>\n\nThe Army Section is approximately 60 students strong.  They participate in camps throughout the year including an annual camp that lasts over a week, and an Easter Camp where they take part in adventurous training activities, a range day where the cadets fire the  [[L98 Cadet Rifles|L98-A2]] Cadet GP Rifle, a field day where the cadets deploy on Manoeuvers for 24hours equipped with blank rounds and a night navigation exercise named Operation Night Owl. Annual Camp 2007 was at a CCF Central Camp at Wathgill, in [[North Yorkshire]]. Annual camp 2016 was in Warcop, Cumbria, with annual camp 2017 held at Nesscliffe training camp, Shropshire, with cadets winning both the inter-force gun run, tug of war and arm wrestling competitions, overall emerging as the best cadet force on camp.\n\nThe [[Royal Air Force]] section, similar to the Navy Section, contains female cadets. It is the most popular section with about 100 cadets, who receive flying lessons in the [[Grob Tutor]] T.1 aircraft and gliding lessons in the [[Grob Vigilant]] G 109 glider. Opportunities for flying and gliding scholarships, as well as various leadership courses, are also available to the most dedicated and talented cadets. The RAF section recently qualified for the national AST competition and has had multiple cadets complete the ACLC course at [[RAF Cranwell]]. The most recent RAF Easter camp was held at [[RAF Halton]], with the summer camp being held at [[RAF Valley]]. An inspection, known as the Bi-ennial inspection takes place every two years. In 2012 the inspection took place at Halton Training Camp. Former pupils have gone on to become commercial pilots.\n\nAll three sections of the CCF learn how to use the [[L98 Cadet Rifles|L98-A2]] Cadet GP Rifle. Various shooting activities take place for all three sections and new recruits in the Army section are tested on the GP Rifle during Easter at [[RAF Sealand|Sealand Ranges]]\n\n== Notable former pupils ==\n{{see also|Category:People educated at Lancaster Royal Grammar School}}\nFormer pupils are known as \"Old Lancastrians\" and there are several branches of the club in the UK and worldwide.

Murray. The Royal Grammar School Lancaster. A History. Heffer 1951.</ref>\nThe first definite mention of the old grammar school is found in a deed dated 4 August 1469, when the Abbess of Syon granted to John Gardyner, of [[Bailrigg]] (near Lancaster), a lease of a water-mill on the [[River Lune]] and some land nearby for two hundred years to maintain a chaplain to celebrate worship in the Church of St. Mary, [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], and to instruct boys in grammar freely, \"unless perchance something shall be voluntarily offered by their friends\".\n\nIn 1472, John Gardyner's will made further provisions for the endowment of the school, and also for William Baxstonden to keep the school so long as he could teach the students. In 1682, the school was rebuilt and in 1852 was removed from the old site on the slopes by the priory to the outskirts of the city, where it now stands (though the city has expanded beyond it).\n\nThis building (now known as Old School House), which stands on the north side of East Road, was designed by the local architects [[Sharpe and Paley]] at a cost of \u00a38,000 ({{Inflation|UK|8000|1852|r=-4|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}<ref name=pev>{{Citation | last =Hartwell| first =Clare| authorlink = | last2 = Pevsner | first2 = Nikolaus | author2-link =Nikolaus Pevsner| series= The Buildings of England| title =Lancashire: North |edition= | publisher =[[Yale University Press]] | year =2009 | origyear=1969 | location = New Haven and London| pages = 410\u2013411|  isbn = 978-0-300-12667-9}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | last = Brandwood| first = Geoff| author-link = | last2 = Austin| first2 = Tim| last3 = Hughes| first3 = John| last4 = Price| first4 = James| year = 2012| title = The Architecture of Sharpe, Paley and Austin|  publication-place = Swindon| place = | publisher = [[English Heritage]]| pages = 215\u2013216| isbn = 978-1-84802-049-8}}</ref> The foundation stone was laid on 5 May 1851 by [[James Prince Lee|Rt&nbsp;Revd&nbsp;James Prince Lee]], the [[Bishop of Manchester]].<ref>{{Citation | last = Hughes| first = John M.| author-link = | publication-date = | date = | year = 2010| title = Edmund Sharpe: Man of Lancaster| edition = | volume = | series = | publication-place = | place = | publisher = John M.

The charities are selected by the Seward Committee where students propose and select which organisations to donate money to, generally two local, two national and two international charities. All students take part in a yearly set run and are encouraged to collect sponsorship donations, helping raise up to \u00a320,000 in a year. Not all the income comes from the run, though, as students organise a large variety of events amongst which are cake sales, raffles and even a teachers' version of the BBC Radio 4 panel show ''Just a Minute'', organised by the Whewell Society.\n\nWhen the national anthem is sung at events such as Founders' Day, the second line is changed to \"[[Long live our noble Duke]]\" in recognition of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]]. Duke is kept irrespective of whether the ruling Monarch is male or female; thus Queen Elizabeth II is known by tradition as the Duke of Lancaster, not Duchess.\n\nUntil September 2015, LRGS used the more traditional '1st year, 2nd year, 3rd year...' system for naming years, rather than the modern 'Year 7, 8, 9...' system - a tradition that had been in place since the 1973/74 academic year. The tradition came under threat in May 2015, when some of the school's teachers made it clear that they would rather use the modern system, to avoid confusion when communicating with other schools and organisations using that system. An online petition was set up, garnering over a thousand signatures from students, teachers and Old Lancastrians. The change was also opposed by the senior prefect team. However, at the start of the next academic year (2015/16), the school officially changed to the modern system, despite the considerable opposition.\n\nFor a period the school ran a preparatory department, which was located in Gardyner House as was officially \"Form 1\". Although this closed in the 1950s it was not until 1973 that the year groups were renumbered - prior to September that year year groups were numbered 2, 3, 4, Shell (abbreviated to \"Sh\") and 5 (followed by Lower, Middle and Upper Sixth). Other traditions that ended in the 1970s were the singing of the school song (before 1972 - but still sung at Old Lancastrian meetings. It was also temporarily sung in 2012 at the occasional first year assembly.), the requirement to wear a school cap (ended from 1972/3 - though they were still on sale until 1979), shorts for junior boarders (which was also abolished in September 1973), and houses for day-students (which were wound up sometime in the late 1970s, probably around 1978 or 1979, in fact somewhat petering out rather than being formally abolished.\n\n== Academic ==\n\nThe school is regularly one of the strongest state schools both regionally and nationally. In 2019,  students achieved top A and A* grades in more than half of all the A level exams that they sat. Over 75% of all results were graded A*, A or B.\n[http://www.education.gov.uk/cgi-bin/schools/performance/school.pl?urn=136742] Over 90% of students go on to further education and on average a dozen gain places at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] Universities.\n\nThe 2007 [[Ofsted]] report stated that \"this is an outstanding school that provides very good value for money. The overwhelming majority of parents value greatly the school and its impact on their children.\"\n\nIn 2005 just under three-quarters of A-level entries resulted in grades A or B (excluding General Studies) while at GCSE three-quarters of all grades were A* or A, with nearly all pupils gaining 10 passes and five pupils gaining a clean sweep of A* grades. In 2011 the A*-C grade was over 95%, only 1% below its counterpart Lancaster Girls' Grammar school.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/education/07/school_tables/secondary_schools/html/888_5401.stm |title=BBC league table |publisher=BBC News |date=10 January 2008 |accessdate=6 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115122005/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/education/07/school_tables/secondary_schools/html/888_5401.stm |archive-date=15 January 2009 |url-status = live|df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Boarding ==\n\nLRGS is a [[List of state boarding schools in England and Wales|state boarding school]] with four boarding houses (Storey, Frankland, Ashton and School Houses) and 170 boarders. The majority of boarders come from the northwest of England; others come from across the UK and overseas. Ofsted inspectors found boarding to be Outstanding in all categories in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boarding.org.uk/media/news/article/32/LRGS-boarding-is-Outstanding |title=LRGS boarding is outstanding |publisher=Boarding Schools Association |date=14 June 2013 |accessdate=8 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309030147/http://www.boarding.org.uk/media/news/article/32/LRGS-boarding-is-Outstanding |archive-date=9 March 2014 |url-status = live|df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== School Societies ==\n\nLRGS is home to a wide range of student run societies, including a Literature Society, History Society, Economics Society, STEM Club, Labour Students Society, Bad Boyz Baking Club, Warhammer Club, Conservative Club, Armchair Generals, Beginners\u2019 Mandarin, German Club, MFL Film Club, Duke of Edinburgh's award, and the Whewell Society (A more comprehensive list can be found [https://www.lrgs.org.uk/page/?title=Extra+Curricular+Activities%2C+Clubs+and+Societies&pid=184 here]). The Whewell Society, named in honour of [[William Whewell]], an old student, was founded in 1908 and is the oldest continuous society in the school. It was founded by the sixth form as a society to promote the arts, music and debate. Since the 1950s, the society has been purely a debating society and has enjoyed success in competitions. It debates a mixture of heavy motions (such as 'This House Would Criminalise Abortion in the UK') and lighter ones (for example, This House Believes Tea is Better Than Coffee'). It continues to thrive under student leadership.\n\n== Sport ==\nThe school offers a wide range of sporting activities to the students throughout their school careers including tennis, sailing, swimming, rowing, cross country running etc. but remains a bastion of rugby union. Achievement in this code is generally accorded more prominence in school life than other activities but the school has achieved more notable success in rowing and cross country running, especially when their far lower budgets are taken into account. Nonetheless, the school has produced some notable figures in rugby union such as the former England and Bath coach [[Brian Ashton (rugby player)|Brian Ashton]], former captain of Norway [[Erik Lund (rugby player)|Erik Lund]] and his brother the England international [[Magnus Lund]].\n\nFormer Pupils have achieved Olympic success. [[Jason Queally]], took track cycling gold in the 1&nbsp;km time trial at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] and [[Scott Durant]] won gold with the British Men's Eight in the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] (see [[#Boat Club|Boat Club]]).\n\nIn 2011, the LRGS lst XI won the Local Football Cup, beating Morecambe High School 1\u20130 at the Globe Arena with a fine performance from the entire squad.\n\nIn 2015 the U13s won  the Lancashire Cup Final against Audenshaw 20 points to 5\n\nIn 2012, the LRGS 1st XV reached the last 8 of the Rosslyn Park National 7s tournament and the U16s reached the last 32.\n\nIn 2010, the 1st XV, won the Lancashire Cup Final, and became champions in a hard-fought match against Merchant Taylor's Crosby, this achievement was followed by the U14s and the U15s who were victorious in finals against Merchant Taylor's Crosby and Manchester Grammar School, respectively.\n\nIn 2009, the U13s and U14s reached the finals of the Lancashire Cup, however both lost narrowly against Manchester Grammar School. In the 2008/2009 season, LRGS won the Lancashire schools cup in the U18s and the U13s as well as winning the Floodlit cup for Lancashire and Cheshire in the U16s. They also set a new record with four teams reaching the county finals. While, in 2007/2008 season, LRGS won the Lancashire Cup in the U15 and U16 age groups.\n\nIn recent years the school has enjoyed an improved reputation in cricket with recent highlights including the school's 1st XI Cricket team's narrow defeat in the Sir Garfield Sobers Tournament at The Kensington Oval Barbados in July 2011. The school achieved a victory over [[Charterhouse School]] in the final of the Lord's Taverners Cricketer Colts Trophy for Schools in 1999,<ref>[http://www.lordstaverners.org/whowehelp/ltcctrophy.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416081317/http://www.lordstaverners.org/whowehelp/ltcctrophy.asp |date=16 April 2007 }}</ref> and enjoyed a run to the semi final of the Daily Mail U18 Cup in 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lrgs.org.uk/?sp=1783 |title=Lancaster Royal Grammar School &#124; Boys' Grammar &#124; State Boarding |publisher=LRGS |date= |accessdate=6 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728135655/http://www.lrgs.org.uk/?sp=1783 |archive-date=28 July 2011 |url-status = live|df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, LRGS became the U19 and U16 district champions for table tennis.\n\n=== Boat Club ===\n\nLancaster Royal Grammar School Boat Club was founded in 1948.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = \n  | first = \n  | authorlink = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = British Rowing Almanack and ARA Year Book 2003\n  | publisher = The Amateur Rowing Association\n  | year = 2003\n  | location = Hammersmith, London\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/britishsportbibl0000coxr/page/369\n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | isbn = 978-0-7146-5251-1\n  | page = [https://archive.org/details/britishsportbibl0000coxr/page/369 369]\n  }}</ref>\nThey were tenants of [[Lancaster John O' Gaunt Rowing Club]] from 1985 to 2011.<ref name=\"lancasterrowing1\">{{cite web\n |last         = Sullivan\n |first        = Steven\n |coauthors    = \n |title        = History of Lancaster John O' Gaunt Rowing Club\n |work         = Lancaster John O'Gaunt Rowing Club website\n |pages        = \n |publisher    = \n |date         = \n |url          = http://lancasterrowing.co.uk/history.html\n |accessdate   = 8 April 2010\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100503045322/http://www.lancasterrowing.co.uk/history.html\n |archive-date = 3 May 2010\n |url-status   = live\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref> In 2011 the Boat Club relocated to Halton Army Training Camp.\n\nThe boat club  had 15 years of national success under Tim Lucas achieving medal success in either the [[Schools' Head of the River Race]], [[The National Schools Regatta]] or the [[National Rowing Championships]] for ten consecutive years from 1992 to 2002.<ref name=\"lancasterrowing1\"/> The club also made at least the final of a national event from 1992 to 2006.

Scott started rowing at Lancaster Royal Grammar School aged 15 with his twin brother Mason.\n\nIn 2015 [[Storm Desmond]] devastated the boathouse, destroying many boats from the fleet. However, the club has since obtained a new fleet of Kanghua boats and a larger boathouse.\n\n=== Cross Country Club===\n\nAlthough the school's main sports during the summer and winter are cricket and rugby respectively, in recent years, it is the school's cross country squad that has achieved the most recognition nationally. The school's rise to prominence began in the late 2000s under the coaching of Mr Andrew Yelland, with several LRGS athletes being chosen to represent Lancashire, at the English School's Cross Country. In 2009 for instance, the school had 6 County runners. In 2010 LRGS won the prestigious Northern School Cross Country Championships for the first time, and continued this feat in 2011 and 2012 \u2013 the latter being particularly special as LRGS were the victors in all 5 students' races. The school also won the famous Stonyhurst Invitation Race in 2011 and 2012, recorded a 5th-place finish in the National Schools Cross Country Relays in 2011, and a 3rd-place finish in the Intermediate Boys English Schools Cross Country Cup in the same year. The club also boasts the National Schools Senior Fell Running Champions from 2011, and several National medallists \u2013 Ben Akin was 2nd at the English Schools Intermediate Boys 800m in 2009, Beau Smith was 3rd at the English National Championships over 800m the following year, and Callum Mason was 3rd at the English Schools Mountain Running Championships in 2011.\n\n== Combined Cadet Force ==\n\nThe [[Combined Cadet Force]] (CCF) at LRGS comprises [[Royal Navy]], [[British Army|Army]] and [[Royal Air Force]] sections. Pupils in year nine and above are allowed to join. It parades on Tuesday afternoons after school and is voluntary. All sections participate in camps throughout the year, including an annual summer camp during the summer holidays, and an Easter camp involving adventurous training in which all three sections can participate. The Contingent, as of 2019 maintains around 200 members, and is led by a Cadet RSM, which can be drawn from any section.\nPast Regimental Sergeant Majors include:\nCadet RSM L. Wong (2014\u201315),\nCadet RSM B. Taylor (2015-2016),\nCadet RSM C. Tetlow (2016-2017),\nCadet RSM M. Blackett-Ord (2017-2018),\nCadet RSM E. Powell (2018-2019).\n\nThe School has had its own CCF since 1914, then known as the Officer Training Corps. Its roots, however, can be traced back further still, as there are \"references to the existence at Lancaster of a Cadet Volunteer Battalion in the early nineteenth century\".<ref name=\"Fidler\">Fidler, J., ''Lancaster Royal Grammar School: A History of the OTC & CCF''. York: G. H. Smith and Son, 2001. p. 1 {{ISBN|0-904775-27-5}}.</ref> and in 1861, the seventy-strong Battalion was presented with a silver bugle \"by Mrs Lee, wife of the Headmaster\".<ref name=\"Fidler\"/>\n\nThe Royal Navy Section consists of around 25 cadets, including girls from [[Lancaster Girls' Grammar School]], who have been participating since September 2012. The main activities offered are water-based, and the section often goes sailing on Marine Lake, Southport. Cadets in the Navy section also attend national camps and courses run by HQ CCF RN, on which cadets can gain nationally recognised qualifications in topics from power boating to first aid.<ref>http://www.hqccfrn.co.uk/courses.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523070451/http://www.hqccfrn.co.uk/courses.htm |date=23 May 2013 }} ''HQ CCF RN website''. Retrieved 7 January 2013.</ref>\n\nThe Army Section is approximately 60 students strong.  They participate in camps throughout the year including an annual camp that lasts over a week, and an Easter Camp where they take part in adventurous training activities, a range day where the cadets fire the  [[L98 Cadet Rifles|L98-A2]] Cadet GP Rifle, a field day where the cadets deploy on Manoeuvers for 24hours equipped with blank rounds and a night navigation exercise named Operation Night Owl. Annual Camp 2007 was at a CCF Central Camp at Wathgill, in [[North Yorkshire]]. Annual camp 2016 was in Warcop, Cumbria, with annual camp 2017 held at Nesscliffe training camp, Shropshire, with cadets winning both the inter-force gun run, tug of war and arm wrestling competitions, overall emerging as the best cadet force on camp.\n\nThe [[Royal Air Force]] section, similar to the Navy Section, contains female cadets. It is the most popular section with about 100 cadets, who receive flying lessons in the [[Grob Tutor]] T.1 aircraft and gliding lessons in the [[Grob Vigilant]] G 109 glider. Opportunities for flying and gliding scholarships, as well as various leadership courses, are also available to the most dedicated and talented cadets. The RAF section recently qualified for the national AST competition and has had multiple cadets complete the ACLC course at [[RAF Cranwell]]. The most recent RAF Easter camp was held at [[RAF Halton]], with the summer camp being held at [[RAF Valley]]. An inspection, known as the Bi-ennial inspection takes place every two years. In 2012 the inspection took place at Halton Training Camp. Former pupils have gone on to become commercial pilots.\n\nAll three sections of the CCF learn how to use the [[L98 Cadet Rifles|L98-A2]] Cadet GP Rifle. Various shooting activities take place for all three sections and new recruits in the Army section are tested on the GP Rifle during Easter at [[RAF Sealand|Sealand Ranges]]\n\n<br />\n\n== Notable former pupils ==\n{{see also|Category:People educated at Lancaster Royal Grammar School}}\nFormer pupils are known as \"Old Lancastrians\" and there are several branches of the club in the UK and worldwide.
