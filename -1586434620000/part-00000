It has been the setting of popular revolts and celebrations, bullfights and executions, and is now a preferred meeting place of Lisbon natives and tourists alike.\n\nThe current name of the Rossio pays [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to [[Pedro IV of Portugal|Pedro IV]], [[King of Portugal]]. The [[Column of Pedro IV]] is in the middle of the square.\n\n==History and highlights==\n\n{{wide image|File:Lisbon Pra\u00e7a Dom Pedro IV.jpg|800px|Panoramic view in 2019}}\n\n===Origins===\n[[Image:Rossio-Braun-1598.jpg|thumb|left|Drawing of the area around the Rossio from a 16th-century map. The square, in the middle of the image, is limited by the [[Esta\u00fas Palace]] (upper left corner of the square) and the large [[Hospital Real de Todos os Santos|All-Saints Hospital]] (right side).]]\n\nThe Rossio became an important place in the city during the 13th and 14th centuries, when the population of the city expanded to the lower area surrounding the [[Lisbon Castle]] hill. The name \"rossio\" is roughly equivalent to the word \"commons\" in English, and refers to a commonly owned terrain.\nAround 1450, the [[Esta\u00fas Palace|Palace of Estaus]], destined to house foreign dignitaries and noblemen visiting Lisbon, was built on the north side of the square. After the [[Inquisition]] was installed in Lisbon, the Palace of Estaus became its seat, and the Rossio was frequently used as setting for public executions. The first [[auto-da-f\u00e9]] took place in 1540.\n\nIn 1492, [[John II of Portugal|King John II]] ordered the building of one of the most important civil and charitative infrastructures in old Lisbon, the All-Saints Royal Hospital (''[[Hospital Real de Todos os Santos]]''). The Hospital was finished in 1504, during the reign of [[Manuel I of Portugal|King Manuel I]], and occupied the whole eastern side of the square. Old pictures show the fa\u00e7ade of the Hospital to consist of a long building with an arched gallery. The portal to the chapel of the Hospital, facing the Rossio, had a magnificent fa\u00e7ade in [[manueline]] style.\n\nNear the northeastern corner of the square, actually in the neighbouring St Domingo Square, is located the Palace of the Almadas, recognisable by its early 18th century red fa\u00e7ade. In 1640, this Palace was the meeting point of Portuguese noblemen who conspired against Spain and led to the [[Portuguese Restoration War|independence of Portugal from Spanish rule]]. The building is also called the Palace of the Independence for this reason.\nThe Convent of [[Dominican Order|St Dominic]] was established in the 13th century by the Rossio. Their church was greatly damaged by the 1755 earthquake and was rebuilt in baroque style. Its fa\u00e7ade dominates the small St Dominic square.\n\n===1755 earthquake and rebuilding===\n[[File:Rossio e Castelo de S.

Only the Palace of the Independence survived the catastrophic earthquake. The rebuilding of the Rossio was undertaken in the second half of the 18th century by architects [[Eug\u00e9nio dos Santos]] and [[Carlos Mardel]], responsible for the typical [[Pombaline style|Pombaline]] appearance of the buildings around the square.\n\nFrom the Pombaline reconstruction dates the Bandeira Arch (''Arco da Bandeira''), a building at the south side of the square with a [[baroque]] [[pediment]] and a big arch that communicates the Rossio with the Sapateiros Street. The Rossio became linked to the other main square of the city, the [[Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio]], by two straight streets: the \u00c1urea and the Augusta Streets.\n\nAfter a fire in 1836, the old Inquisition Palace was destroyed. Thanks to the efforts of writer [[Almeida Garrett]], it was decided to build a theatre in its place. The [[D. Maria II National Theatre |''Teatro Nacional D. Maria II'']], built in the 1840s, was designed by the [[Italy|Italian]] ''Fortunato Lodi'' in [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style. A statue of the [[renaissance]] Portuguese playwright [[Gil Vicente]] is located over the [[pediment]] of the theatre. Some of Gil Vicente's plays had been censured by the Inquisition back in the 16th century.\n\nIn the 19th century the Rossio was paved with typical [[Portuguese pavement|Portuguese mosaic]] and was adorned with bronze fountains imported from [[France]]. The [[Column of Pedro IV]] was erected in 1874. At this time the square received its current official name, never accepted by the people.\n\nBetween 1886 and 1887 another important landmark was built in the square: the [[Rossio Train Station]] (''Esta\u00e7\u00e3o de Caminhos de Ferro do Rossio''). The Station was built by architect ''Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds Monteiro'' and was an important addition to the infrastructure of the city. Its neo-[[manueline]] fa\u00e7ade dominates the northwest side of the square.\n\n==Significance==\nThe Rossio has been a meeting place for people of Lisbon for centuries. Some of the [[caf\u00e9s]] and shops of the square date from the 18th century, like the ''Caf\u00e9 Nicola'', where poet [[Manuel Maria Barbosa du Bocage]] used to meet friends. Other traditional shops include the ''Pastelaria Su\u00ed\u00e7a'' (1922\u20132018) and the ''[[Ginjinha]]'', where the typical Lisbon spirit ([[Ginjinha]]) can be tasted. The building of the Maria II Theatre and the Public Gardens to the north of the square only made the area more attended by Lisbon high society in the 19th century. Nowadays it is constantly populated by Lisboners and tourists.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Column of Pedro IV]]\n* [[Estaus Palace]]\n* [[Hospital Real de Todos os Santos]]\n* [[Pombaline Downtown]]\n* [[Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio]]\n* [[Rossio massacre]]\n* [[Rossio Train Station]]\n* [[Teatro Nacional D.

Miller]], eds. (1998) ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of World Slavery'', Vol. 2. New York: Simon & Schuster.</ref> This led to increased calls for the same ban in America, supported by members of the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] from both the North and the South as well as President [[Thomas Jefferson]].<ref>Schneider, Dorothy and Carl J. Schneider (2000). ''Slavery in America from Colonial Times to the Civil War''. New York: Facts on File, pp. 261-72.</ref>\n\nAt the same time that the importation of slaves from Africa was being restricted or eliminated, the United States was undergoing a rapid expansion of [[cotton]], [[sugar cane]] and [[rice]] production in the [[Deep South]] and the West. Invention of the cotton gin enabled the profitable cultivation of short-staple cotton, which could be produced more widely than other types; this led to [[King Cotton]] throughout the Deep South. Slaves were treated as a [[commodity]] by owners and traders alike, and were regarded as the crucial labor for the production of lucrative cash crops that fed the [[triangle trade]].<ref>Ira Berlin, ''Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America'', Cambridge, MA: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1998, pp. 95-101.</ref><ref>David W. Galenson, ''Traders, Planters, and Slaves: Market Behavior in Early English America'', 1986.</ref>\n\nThe slaves were managed as assets in the same way as [[Chattel slavery|chattel]]; slaveholders passed laws regulating slavery and the slave trade designed to protect their financial interests; there was little protection for the slaves.  On large plantations, slave families were separated for different types of labor. Men tended to be assigned to large field gangs. Workers were assigned to the task for which they were best physically suited according to the overseer.<ref>Dorothy Schneider and Carl J. Schneider, \"Slavery in America from Colonial Times to the Civil War\", ''Facts on File'', 2000. pp. 52-56</ref><ref>Ira Berlin, ''Many Thousands Gone'', 1998, pp. 40-41; 129-32.</ref>\n\n=== Breeding in response to end of slave imports ===\nThe [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|prohibition on the importation of slaves]] into the United States after 1808 limited the supply of slaves in the United States. This came at a time when the invention of the [[cotton gin]] enabled the expansion of cultivation in the uplands of short-staple cotton, leading to clearing lands cultivating cotton through large areas of the Deep South, especially the [[Black Belt (geological formation)|Black Belt]]. The demand for labor in the area increased sharply and led to an expansion of the internal slave market. At the same time, the [[Upland South|Upper South]] had an excess number of slaves because of a shift to mixed-crops agriculture, which was less labor-intensive than tobacco. To add to the supply of slaves, slaveholders looked at the fertility of slave women as part of their productivity, and intermittently forced the women to have large numbers of children. During this time period, the terms \"breeding slaves\", \"child bearing women\", \"breeding period\", and \"too old to breed\" became familiar.<ref>Smith, Julia Floyd (1991) ''Slavery and Rice Culture in Low Country Georgia, 1750-1860'' University of Tennessee Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bZzDDt3RPkoC&pg=PA104p. 104.]</ref>\n\nPlanters in the Upper South states started selling slaves to the [[Deep South]], generally through slave traders such as [[Franklin and Armfield Office|Franklin and Armfield]]. [[Louisville, Kentucky]], on the [[Ohio River]] was a major slave market and port for shipping slaves downriver by the Mississippi to the South. [[New Orleans]] had the largest slave market in the country and became the fourth largest city in the US by 1840 and the wealthiest, mostly because of its slave trade and associated businesses.<ref>Hornsby, Alton Jr. (2011) ''Black America: A State-by-State Historical Encyclopedia''. Santa Barbara CA: Greenwood Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fB3rQefP8wQC&pg=PA335 p. 335.]</ref>\n\n==Slave accounts==\n{{See also|Slave narrative}}\nIn the [[History of the United States (1789\u20131849)|antebellum]] years, numerous escaped slaves  wrote about their experiences in books called [[slave narratives]]. Many recounted that at least a portion of slave owners continuously interfered in the sexual lives of their slaves (usually the women). The slave narratives also testified that slave women were subjected to arranged marriages, forced matings, sexual violation by masters, their sons or overseers, and other forms of abuse. \n\nThe historian [[E. Franklin Frazier]], in his book ''The Negro Family'', stated that \"there were masters who, without any regard for the preferences of their slaves, mated their human chattel as they did their stock.\" Ex-slave Maggie Stenhouse remarked, \"Durin' slavery there were stockmen. They was weighed and tested. A man would rent the stockman and put him in a room with some young women he wanted to raise children from.\"<ref>Work Projects Administration, ''Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews with Former Slaves, Arkansas Narratives, Part 6'', Kessinger Publishing, 2004, p. 154.</ref>\n\n== Dynamics ==\n===Personhood to thinghood===\nSeveral factors coalesced to make the [[Animal husbandry|breeding]] of slaves a common practice by the end of the 18th century, chief among them the enactment of laws and practices that transformed the view of slaves from \"personhood\" into \"thinghood.\" In this way, slaves could be bought and sold as [[Chattel slavery|chattel]] without presenting a challenge to the [[Religion|religious beliefs]] and [[Mores|social mores]] of the society at large. All rights were to the owner of the slave, with the slave having no rights of self-determination either to his or her own person, spouse, or children.\n\nSlaveholders began to think that slavery was grounded in the [[Bible]]. This view was inspired in part by a reinterpretation of the [[Curse of Ham|Genesis passage]] \"Cursed be Canaan; The lowest of slaves shall he be to his brothers\" (Genesis 9); [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham, son of Noah]] and father of Canaan, was deemed the [[antediluvian]] progenitor of the African people. Some whites used the [[The Bible and slavery|Bible]] to justify the economic use of slave labor. The subjugation of slaves was taken as a natural right of the white slave owners. The second class position of the slave was not limited to his relationship with the slave master but was to be in relation to all whites. Slaves were considered subject to white persons.<ref name=\"Donoghue\">Eddie Donoghue, ''Black Breeding Machines: The Breeding of Negro Slaves in the Diaspora'', AuthorHouse, 2008, pp. 134-36.</ref>\n\n===Demographics===\nIn a study of 2,588 slaves in 1860 by the [[economist]] Richard Sutch, he found that on slave-holdings with at least one woman, the average ratio of women to men exceeded 2:1. The imbalance was greater in the \"selling states\", where the excess of women over men was 300 per thousand.<ref>Sutch, Richard, \"The Breeding of Slaves for Sale and the Westward Expansion of Slavery, 1850-1860\", in Stanley L. Engerman and Eugene Genovese (eds), ''Race and Slavery in the Western Hemishpere: Q Studies'', Princeton University Press, 1975, pp. 173-210.</ref>\n<!-- Another reason could be that more males were sold to the Deep South for field labor on the large plantations. -->\n\n===Natural increase ''vs'' systematic breeding===\n[[Ned Sublette]], co-author of ''The American Slave Coast'', states that the reproductive worth of \"breeding women\" was essential to the young country's expansion not just for labor but as merchandise and [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] stemming from a shortage of [[silver standard|silver]], [[gold standard|gold]], or sound [[Banknote|paper tender]]. He concludes that slaves and their descendants were used as human savings accounts with newborns serving as [[interest rate|interest]] that functioned as the basis of money and [[credit (finance)|credit]] in a [[market (economics)|market]] premised on the continual expansion of slavery.<ref>Sublette, Ned and Constance Sublette (2016). ''American Slave Coast: A History of the Slave-Breeding Industry''. Chicago IL: Chicago Review Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iwCKCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT49 p. 49.]</ref>\n\n[[Robert Fogel]] and [[Stanley Engerman]] reject the idea that ''systematic'' slave breeding was a major economic concern in their 1974 book ''[[Time on the Cross]]''.<ref>Fogel, Robert; Engerman, Stanley (1995). ''Time on the Cross: The Economics of American Negro Slavery''. New York: Norton, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ScpPBinpzwoC&pg=PA78 p. 78.]</ref> They argue that there is very meager evidence for the systematic breeding of slaves for sale in the market in the Upper South during the 19th century. They distinguish systematic breeding\u2014the interference in normal sexual patterns by masters with an aim to increase fertility or encourage desirable characteristics\u2014from [[Natalism|pro-natalist]] policies, the generalized encouragement of large families through a combination of rewards, improved living and working conditions for fertile women and their children, and other policy changes by masters. They point out that the demographic evidence is subject to a number of interpretations. Fogel argues that when planters intervened in the private lives of slaves it actually had a negative impact on population growth.<ref name=\"Davis2014\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Children of the plantation]]\n\n'''General:'''\n* [[Eugenics]]\n* [[History of slavery in the United States]]\n* [[Treatment of slaves in the United States#Sexual relations and rape|Sexual relations and rape of slaves]]\n* [[Treatment of slaves in the United States]]\n* [[White slave propaganda]]\n\n===Further reading===\n*Randall M.

Invention of the cotton gin enabled the profitable cultivation of short-staple cotton, which could be produced more widely than other types; this led to [[King Cotton]] throughout the Deep South. Slaves were treated as a [[commodity]] by owners and traders alike, and were regarded as the crucial labor for the production of lucrative cash crops that fed the [[triangle trade]].<ref>Ira Berlin, ''Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America'', Cambridge, MA: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1998, pp. 95-101.</ref><ref>David W. Galenson, ''Traders, Planters, and Slaves: Market Behavior in Early English America'', 1986.</ref>\n\nThe slaves were managed as assets in the same way as [[Chattel slavery|chattel]]; slaveholders passed laws regulating slavery and the slave trade designed to protect their financial interests; there was little protection for the slaves.  On large plantations, slave families were separated for different types of labor. Men tended to be assigned to large field gangs. Workers were assigned to the task for which they were best physically suited according to the overseer.<ref>Dorothy Schneider and Carl J. Schneider, \"Slavery in America from Colonial Times to the Civil War\", ''Facts on File'', 2000. pp. 52-56</ref><ref>Ira Berlin, ''Many Thousands Gone'', 1998, pp. 40-41; 129-32.</ref>\n\n=== Breeding in response to end of slave imports ===\nThe [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|prohibition on the importation of slaves]] into the United States after 1808 limited the supply of slaves in the United States. This came at a time when the invention of the [[cotton gin]] enabled the expansion of cultivation in the uplands of short-staple cotton, leading to clearing lands cultivating cotton through large areas of the Deep South, especially the [[Black Belt (geological formation)|Black Belt]]. The demand for labor in the area increased sharply and led to an expansion of the internal slave market. At the same time, the [[Upland South|Upper South]] had an excess number of slaves because of a shift to mixed-crops agriculture, which was less labor-intensive than tobacco. To add to the supply of slaves, slaveholders looked at the fertility of slave women as part of their productivity, and intermittently forced the women to have large numbers of children. During this time period, the terms \"breeding slaves\", \"child bearing women\", \"breeding period\", and \"too old to breed\" became familiar.<ref>Smith, Julia Floyd (1991) ''Slavery and Rice Culture in Low Country Georgia, 1750-1860'' University of Tennessee Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bZzDDt3RPkoC&pg=PA104p. 104.]</ref>\n\nPlanters in the Upper South states started selling slaves to the [[Deep South]], generally through slave traders such as [[Franklin and Armfield Office|Franklin and Armfield]]. [[Louisville, Kentucky]], on the [[Ohio River]] was a major slave market and port for shipping slaves downriver by the Mississippi to the South. [[New Orleans]] had the largest slave market in the country and became the fourth largest city in the US by 1840 and the wealthiest, mostly because of its slave trade and associated businesses.<ref>Hornsby, Alton Jr. (2011) ''Black America: A State-by-State Historical Encyclopedia''. Santa Barbara CA: Greenwood Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fB3rQefP8wQC&pg=PA335 p. 335.]</ref>\n\n==Slave accounts==\n{{See also|Slave narrative}}\nIn the [[History of the United States (1789\u20131849)|antebellum]] years, numerous escaped slaves  wrote about their experiences in books called [[slave narratives]]. Many recounted that at least a portion of slave owners continuously interfered in the sexual lives of their slaves (usually the women). The slave narratives also testified that slave women were subjected to arranged marriages, forced matings, sexual violation by masters, their sons or overseers, and other forms of abuse. Skeptics maintain that reports from witnesses were [[apocrypha]]l, and never specified a particular place in which breeding practices were alleged to have occurred.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe historian [[E. Franklin Frazier]], in his book ''The Negro Family'', stated that \"there were masters who, without any regard for the preferences of their slaves, mated their human chattel as they did their stock.\" Ex-slave Maggie Stenhouse remarked, \"Durin' slavery there were stockmen. They was weighed and tested. A man would rent the stockman and put him in a room with some young women he wanted to raise children from.\"<ref>Work Projects Administration, ''Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews with Former Slaves, Arkansas Narratives, Part 6'', Kessinger Publishing, 2004, p. 154.</ref>\n\n== Dynamics ==\n===Personhood to thinghood===\nSeveral factors coalesced to make the [[Animal husbandry|breeding]] of slaves a common practice by the end of the 18th century, chief among them the enactment of laws and practices that transformed the view of slaves from \"personhood\" into \"thinghood.\" In this way, slaves could be bought and sold as [[Chattel slavery|chattel]] without presenting a challenge to the [[Religion|religious beliefs]] and [[Mores|social mores]] of the society at large. All rights were to the owner of the slave, with the slave having no rights of self-determination either to his or her own person, spouse, or children.\n\nSlaveholders began to think that slavery was grounded in the [[Bible]]. This view was inspired in part by a reinterpretation of the [[Curse of Ham|Genesis passage]] \"Cursed be Canaan; The lowest of slaves shall he be to his brothers\" (Genesis 9); [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham, son of Noah]] and father of Canaan, was deemed the [[antediluvian]] progenitor of the African people. Some whites used the [[The Bible and slavery|Bible]] to justify the economic use of slave labor. The subjugation of slaves was taken as a natural right of the white slave owners. The second class position of the slave was not limited to his relationship with the slave master but was to be in relation to all whites. Slaves were considered subject to white persons.<ref name=\"Donoghue\">Eddie Donoghue, ''Black Breeding Machines: The Breeding of Negro Slaves in the Diaspora'', AuthorHouse, 2008, pp. 134-36.</ref>\n\n===Demographics===\nIn a study of 2,588 slaves in 1860 by the [[economist]] Richard Sutch, he found that on slave-holdings with at least one woman, the average ratio of women to men exceeded 2:1. The imbalance was greater in the \"selling states\", where the excess of women over men was 300 per thousand.<ref>Sutch, Richard, \"The Breeding of Slaves for Sale and the Westward Expansion of Slavery, 1850-1860\", in Stanley L. Engerman and Eugene Genovese (eds), ''Race and Slavery in the Western Hemishpere: Q Studies'', Princeton University Press, 1975, pp. 173-210.</ref>\n<!-- Another reason could be that more males were sold to the Deep South for field labor on the large plantations. -->\n\n===Natural increase ''vs'' systematic breeding===\n[[Ned Sublette]], co-author of ''The American Slave Coast'', states that the reproductive worth of \"breeding women\" was essential to the young country's expansion not just for labor but as merchandise and [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] stemming from a shortage of [[silver standard|silver]], [[gold standard|gold]], or sound [[Banknote|paper tender]]. He concludes that slaves and their descendants were used as human savings accounts with newborns serving as [[interest rate|interest]] that functioned as the basis of money and [[credit (finance)|credit]] in a [[market (economics)|market]] premised on the continual expansion of slavery.<ref>Sublette, Ned and Constance Sublette (2016). ''American Slave Coast: A History of the Slave-Breeding Industry''. Chicago IL: Chicago Review Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iwCKCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT49 p. 49.]</ref>\n\n[[Robert Fogel]] and [[Stanley Engerman]] reject the idea that ''systematic'' slave breeding was a major economic concern in their 1974 book ''[[Time on the Cross]]''.<ref>Fogel, Robert; Engerman, Stanley (1995). ''Time on the Cross: The Economics of American Negro Slavery''. New York: Norton, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ScpPBinpzwoC&pg=PA78 p. 78.]</ref> They argue that there is very meager evidence for the systematic breeding of slaves for sale in the market in the Upper South during the 19th century. They distinguish systematic breeding\u2014the interference in normal sexual patterns by masters with an aim to increase fertility or encourage desirable characteristics\u2014from [[Natalism|pro-natalist]] policies, the generalized encouragement of large families through a combination of rewards, improved living and working conditions for fertile women and their children, and other policy changes by masters. They point out that the demographic evidence is subject to a number of interpretations. Fogel argues that when planters intervened in the private lives of slaves it actually had a negative impact on population growth.<ref name=\"Davis2014\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Children of the plantation]]\n\n'''General:'''\n* [[Eugenics]]\n* [[History of slavery in the United States]]\n* [[Treatment of slaves in the United States#Sexual relations and rape|Sexual relations and rape of slaves]]\n* [[Treatment of slaves in the United States]]\n* [[White slave propaganda]]\n\n===Further reading===\n*Randall M.

He developed the land by encouraging tenants to settle it, and granting them perpetual [[leasing|leases]] at moderate rates, which enabled the tenants to use more of their capital to make their farms and businesses productive.\n\nActive in politics as a [[Federalist Party|Federalist]], Van Rensselaer served in the [[New York State Assembly]] and [[New York State Senate]], and as [[Lieutenant Governor of New York]].  After the demise of the Federalist Party, Van Rensselaer was a [[National Republican Party|John Quincy Adams supporter]], and served in the [[United States House of Representatives]] for one partial term and three full ones.\n\nVan Rensselaer was a supporter of higher education; he served on the board of trustees for several schools and colleges, and was the founder of the [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]].  He was also a civic activist and philanthropist, and was a founder of Albany's public library and the city's Institute of History & Arts.\n\nLong active in the militia, Van Rensselaer attained the rank of [[Major general (United States)|major general]]; he commanded troops on the New York-[[Canada]] border during the [[War of 1812]], but resigned his commission after defeat at the [[Battle of Queenston Heights]].\n\nAfter Van Rensselaer's 1839 death, efforts by his sons to collect past due lease payments led to the [[Anti-Rent War]], and the break up and sale of the manor.

House members voted first individually by state, and then each state cast one ballot for the candidate who received a majority of the state's House delegation; a candidate had to carry 13 state delegations to win the election. Van Rensselaer had intended to vote for Crawford, but changed his mind and voted for Adams.

When war was declared on Great Britain in June 1812, Van Rensselaer was a leading [[United States Federalist Party|Federalist]] candidate for [[Governor of New York]]. [[Democratic-Republican Party]] leaders, including President [[James Madison]] and incumbent New York Governor [[Daniel D. Tompkins]] devised a way to remove Van Rensselaer from the campaign by offering him command of the Army of the Centre\u2014U.S. militia and regular Army troops massing in upstate New York for an invasion of Canada. If Van Rensselaer declined a military leadership role during a time of war, he would lose esteem in the eyes of the voters. If he accepted, he would likely be unable to run for governor.\n\nVan Rensselaer accepted; despite having held high rank in the militia, he was largely inexperienced at leading large bodies of troops.  As a condition of his acceptance, his cousin [[Solomon van Rensselaer|Solomon]], who had more military experience, was appointed his [[aide-de-camp]]. But the Army of the Centre consisted largely of untrained, inexperienced militiamen; under the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], which stressed that the role of the militia was to enforce laws, prevent insurrection, and repel invasion, they did not have to cross into [[Canada]] to fight.\n\nThe [[United Kingdom|British]] were in the process of fortifying the [[Queenston Heights]] that Van Rensselaer would have to attack, and his officers were itching for action despite their general's desire to delay until his troops were better trained and organized. To make matters worse, [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Alexander Smyth]], Van Rensselaer's subordinate, had a large force of regular Army troops that was theoretically under Van Rensselaer's command, but Smyth refused to subordinate himself to a militia officer. With some of his officers planning to try and force him from command, Van Rensselaer decided to act without Smyth.\n\nOn October 13, 1812, Van Rensselaer launched an attack on the British position that would evolve into the [[Battle of Queenston Heights]].  Though initially successful, Van Rensselaer's inadequate preparations and his plan of attack were clearly main reasons for what became a major defeat. He was unable to secure the element of surprise, he did not procure enough boats for his men to cross the [[Niagara River]] easily, and he was even unable to supply his soldiers with sufficient ammunition. Despite significantly outnumbering the British in the early stages of the battle, the American soldiers, untried and untrained, sometimes refused to cross to the Canadian side of the river. Once the tide of the battle turned, Van Rensselaer was not even able to coax the boatmen into going back over to rescue the doomed attack force.  His forces were badly beaten by British troops under generals [[Isaac Brock]] and, after Brock's death, [[Roger Hale Sheaffe]].\n\nThe defeat at Queenston Heights spelled the end to Van Rensselaer's active military career; after the battle he resigned his post.  He continued to serve in the militia, and was the senior major general in the state at the time of his death.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Urban |first=Sylvanus |date=June 1, 1839 |title=Obituary, General Van Rensselaer |volume=11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HMUhAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA660 |magazine=The Gentleman's Magazine |location=London, UK |publisher=William Pickering, John Bowyer Nichols and Son |page=660}}</ref>  Despite his military setback, Van Rensselaer was still the Federalist candidate for governor in April 1813; he lost to Tompkins 43,324 votes to 39,713.<ref name=\"Horace Greeley\"/>\n\n==Later career==\n[[File:Stephen Van Rensselaer (1828).jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Van Rensselaer by [[Chester Harding (painter)|Chester Harding]], 1828]]\n[[File:Stephen van Rensselaer III.png|thumb|right|Engraving of Van Rensselaer by G.

After the demise of the Federalist Party, Van Rensselaer was a [[National Republican Party|John Quincy Adams supporter]], and served in the [[United States House of Representatives]] for one partial term and three full ones.\n\nVan Rensselaer was a supporter of higher education; he served on the board of trustees for several schools and colleges, and was the founder of the [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]].

Crawford]].  House members voted first individually by state, and then each state cast one ballot for the candidate who received a majority of the state's House delegation; a candidate had to carry 13 state delegations to win the election. Van Rensselaer had intended to vote for Crawford, but changed his mind and voted for Adams.  His vote gave Adams a majority of the New York delegation; winning New York gave Adams 13 states in the House vote, to seven for Jackson and four for Crawford.<ref name=\"Bassett2006\">{{cite book|last1=Bassett|first1=John Spencer|title=The Life of Andrew Jackson|date=2006|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=9781428650558|page=364|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3pOlEwfIFcsC&pg=PA364&lpg=PA364|accessdate=9 February 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Military career==\nIn 1786, Van Rensselaer was appointed a [[Major (United States)|major]] in the Albany County Regiment of the [[New York Army National Guard|New York Militia]].<ref>{{cite book |last=New York State Legislature |date=1902 |title=Documents of the Senate of the State of New York |volume=9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LKIlAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA145 |location=Albany, NY |publisher=J.

When war was declared on Great Britain in June 1812, Van Rensselaer was a leading [[United States Federalist Party|Federalist]] candidate for [[Governor of New York]]. [[Democratic-Republican Party]] leaders, including President [[James Madison]] and incumbent New York Governor [[Daniel D. Tompkins]] devised a way to remove Van Rensselaer from the campaign by offering him command of the Army of the Centre\u2014U.S. militia and regular Army troops massing in upstate New York for an invasion of Canada. If Van Rensselaer declined a military leadership role during a time of war, he would lose esteem in the eyes of the voters. If he accepted, he would likely be unable to run for governor.\n\nVan Rensselaer accepted; despite having held high rank in the militia, he was largely inexperienced at leading large bodies of troops.  As a condition of his acceptance, his cousin [[Solomon van Rensselaer|Solomon]], who had more military experience, was appointed his [[aide-de-camp]]. But the Army of the Centre consisted largely of untrained, inexperienced militiamen; under the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], which stressed that the role of the militia was to enforce laws, prevent insurrection, and repel invasion, they did not have to cross into [[Canada]] to fight.\n\nThe [[United Kingdom|British]] were in the process of fortifying the [[Queenston Heights]] that Van Rensselaer would have to attack, and his officers were itching for action despite their general's desire to delay until his troops were better trained and organized. To make matters worse, [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Alexander Smyth]], Van Rensselaer's subordinate, had a large force of regular Army troops that was theoretically under Van Rensselaer's command, but Smyth refused to subordinate himself to a militia officer. With some of his officers planning to try and force him from command, Van Rensselaer decided to act without Smyth.\n\nOn October 13, 1812, Van Rensselaer launched an attack on the British position that would evolve into the [[Battle of Queenston Heights]].  Though initially successful, Van Rensselaer's inadequate preparations and his plan of attack were clearly main reasons for what became a major defeat. He was unable to secure the element of surprise, he did not procure enough boats for his men to cross the [[Niagara River]] easily, and he was even unable to supply his soldiers with sufficient ammunition. Despite significantly outnumbering the British in the early stages of the battle, the American soldiers, untried and untrained, sometimes refused to cross to the Canadian side of the river. Once the tide of the battle turned, Van Rensselaer was not even able to coax the boatmen into going back over to rescue the doomed attack force.  His forces were badly beaten by British troops under generals [[Isaac Brock]] and, after Brock's death, [[Roger Hale Sheaffe]].\n\nThe defeat at Queenston Heights spelled the end to Van Rensselaer's active military career; after the battle he resigned his post.  He continued to serve in the militia, and was the senior major general in the state at the time of his death.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Urban |first=Sylvanus |date=June 1, 1839 |title=Obituary, General Van Rensselaer |volume=11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HMUhAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA660 |magazine=The Gentleman's Magazine |location=London, UK |publisher=William Pickering, John Bowyer Nichols and Son |page=660}}</ref>  Despite his military setback, Van Rensselaer was still the Federalist candidate for governor in April 1813; he lost to Tompkins 43,324 votes to 39,713.<ref name=\"Horace Greeley\"/>\n\n==Later career==\n[[File:Stephen Van Rensselaer (1828).jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Van Rensselaer by [[Chester Harding (painter)|Chester Harding]], 1828]]\n[[File:Stephen van Rensselaer III.png|thumb|right|Engraving of Van Rensselaer by G.

The corps was raised during the expansion of the [[Volunteer Force|Volunteer movement]] in the 1850s and then served with the [[Territorial Force]] during [[World War I]]. It converted to an anti-aircraft role just prior to [[World War II]], and continued to serve until it was amalgamated in 1950.\n\n== Volunteer Force ==\nThe enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs) composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular [[British Army]] in time of need.<ref>Beckett.</ref><ref>Westlake, ''Rifle Volunteers''.</ref> One of these new corps was the 1st Northumberland RVC (also known as the Northumberland Rifles) formed in [[North Shields]] and [[Tynemouth]] on 16 August 1859 by coal-owner Edward Potter of [[Cramlington]]. It took some moral courage to appear in the street in Volunteer uniform: members of the 1st Northumberland RVC were sneered at as 'noodles'. However, the movement continued to grow: in February 1860 the 1st absorbed the 2nd Northumberland RVC of three companies, also formed at Tynemouth on 4 January that year. In August 1861 it split to form the 1st (Tynemouth), 8th (three companies at [[Walker-on-Tyne]]) and 9th (Cramlington) Northumberland RVCs, which were all placed in the '''2nd Administrative Battalion of Northumberland Rifle Volunteers'''. The 1st disbanded in October 1862 and the 9th in December 1864, but the '''8th (Walker) Northumberland RVC''' thrived. The HQ of the 2nd Admin Battalion moved to Walker after the disbandment of the 1st; it was disbanded in 1865 and the 8th continued as an independent corps with James Anderson, a former [[Ensign_(rank)#United_Kingdom|ensign]] in the [[30th Foot]], as [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant-colonel]] in command.

When German forces crossed into [[Belgium]], the [[United Kingdom]] declared war on [[Germany]] and later the rest of the [[Central Powers]]. At the time the units of the Northumbrian Division were at their annual training camp in [[North Wales]]. On 3 August they were ordered to return to their respective headquarters, where at 17.00 next day they received orders to [[Mobilization|mobilise]]. The units went to their war stations along the coast, where there were numerous alerts. In October the division became part of [[Central Force]] in Home Defence and manned the [[River Tyne|Tyne]] Defences.<ref name = Becke50/><ref name=\":52\"/><ref>Wyrall, p.4.</ref>\n\nOn the outbreak of war, TF units were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service. The large majority of the Northumbrian Division accepted. On 15 August the [[War Office]] (WO) issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units.

The corps was raised during the expansion of the [[Volunteer Force|Volunteer movement]] in the 1850s and then served with the [[Territorial Force]] during [[World War I]]. It converted to an anti-aircraft role just prior to [[World War II]], and continued to serve until it was amalgamated in 1950.\n\n== Volunteer Force ==\nThe enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs) composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular [[British Army]] in time of need.<ref>Beckett.</ref><ref>Westlake, ''Rifle Volunteers''.</ref> One of these new corps was the 1st Northumberland RVC (also known as the Northumberland Rifles) formed in [[North Shields]] and [[Tynemouth]] on 16 August 1859 by coal-owner Edward Potter of [[Cramlington]]. It took some moral courage to appear in the street in Volunteer uniform: members of the 1st Northumberland RVC were sneered at as 'noodles'. However, the movement continued to grow: in February 1860 the 1st absorbed the 2nd Northumberland RVC of three companies, also formed at Tynemouth on 4 January that year. In August 1861 it split to form the 1st (Tynemouth), 8th (three companies at [[Walker-on-Tyne]]) and 9th (Cramlington) Northumberland RVCs, which were all placed in the '''2nd Administrative Battalion of Northumberland Rifle Volunteers'''. The 1st disbanded in October 1862 and the 9th in December 1864, but the '''8th (Walker) Northumberland RVC''' thrived. The HQ of the 2nd Admin Battalion moved to Walker after the disbandment of the 1st; it was disbanded in 1865 and the 8th continued as an independent corps with James Anderson, a former [[Ensign_(rank)#United_Kingdom|ensign]] in the [[30th Foot]], as [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant-colonel]] in command.

When German forces crossed into [[Belgium]], the [[United Kingdom]] declared war on [[Germany]] and later the rest of the [[Central Powers]]. At the time the units of the Northumbrian Division were at their annual training camp in [[North Wales]]. On 3 August they were ordered to return to their respective headquarters, where at 17.00 next day they received orders to [[Mobilization|mobilise]]. The units went to their war stations along the coast, where there were numerous alerts.

The large majority of the Northumbrian Division accepted. On 15 August the [[War Office]] (WO) issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix.

On 1 January 1947 most of these regiments were reconstituted and many new regiments were formed as part of the reformed and re-organised TA, with new numbers according to the renumbering plan for the complete re-designation of all RA units, both regular and territorial.  In accordance with this, the light anti-aircraft (LAA) regiments were assigned numbers between 512 and 588. The 5th Btn was reformed as '''588th (Royal Northumberland Fusiliers) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery''', and followed the new standard RA organisation, which consisted of RHQ, P, Q, and R Batteries, all of which were based in Walker on Tyne. The regiment provided the LAA component of the TA's [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division]].<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":4\" /><ref name = FarnM/><ref name=\":6\">Litchfield, pp. 5-6.</ref><ref>Frederick, Volume II, p. 1024.</ref><ref>[http://www.orbat.info/history/historical/uk/ta47.html  Watson, ''TA 1947''.]</ref><ref>Litchfield, Appendix 5.</ref><ref name = 45on>[http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/territorial-army-royal-artillery/564-591-regiments.html 564\u2013591 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.]</ref>\n\nOn 1 September 1950 the regiment was converted back to infantry and simultaneously merged with the 4th Btn to form the '''4th/5th Battalion, The Royal Northumberland Fusiliers'''.

At least 36,417 deaths are attributed to the eruption and the [[tsunami]]s it created.\n\nSignificant additional effects were also felt around the world in the days and weeks after the volcano's eruption. Additional [[seismic]] activity continued until February 1884; reports of seismic activity after October 1883 were later dismissed by [[Rogier Verbeek]]'s investigation into the eruption.\n\n==Early phase==\n\nIn the years before the 1883 eruption, seismic activity around the [[Krakatoa]] volcano was intense, with [[earthquake]]s felt as far away as Australia. Beginning on 19 May 1883, steam venting began to occur regularly from [[Perboewatan]], the northernmost of the island's three cones. Eruptions of ash reached an estimated altitude of 6&nbsp;km (20,000&nbsp;ft) and explosions could be heard in New Batavia ([[Jakarta]]) {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on}} away.<ref name=\"thornton\">{{cite book |last1=Thornton |first1=Ian W.

On 24 June, a prevailing east wind cleared the cloud, and two ash columns could be seen issuing from Krakatoa. The seat of the eruption is believed to have been a new vent or vents that formed between Perboewatan and [[Danan]]. The violence of the ongoing eruptions caused tides in the vicinity to be unusually high, and ships at anchor had to be moored with chains. Earthquakes were felt at [[Anyer]], [[Banten]], and ships began to report large [[pumice]] masses to the west in the [[Indian Ocean]].<ref name=\"thornton\"/>\n\nIn early August, a Dutch topographical engineer, Captain H. J. G. Ferzenaar, investigated the Krakatoa islands.<ref name=\"thornton\"/> He noted three major ash columns (the newer from Danan), which obscured the western part of the island, and steam plumes from at least eleven other vents, mostly between Danan and [[Rakata]]. When he landed, he noted an ash layer about {{convert|0.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}} thick, and the destruction of all vegetation, leaving only tree stumps. He advised against any further landings.<ref name=\"thornton\"/>\n\n==Climactic phase==\nBy 25 August, the Krakatoa eruptions intensified. At about 1:00 pm on 26 August, the volcano went into its [[Volcanic Explosivity Index#Classification|paroxysmal]] phase. By 2:00 pm, a black cloud of ash could be seen 27 kilometres high. At this point, the eruption was almost continuous and explosions could be heard every ten minutes or so. Ships within {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the volcano reported heavy ash fall, with pieces of hot pumice up to {{convert|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter landing on their decks. Between 7:00 pm and 8:00 pm, a small tsunami hit the shores of [[Java (island)|Java]] and [[Sumatra]], {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} away.\n\nOn 27 August, four enormous explosions occurred, which marked the climax of the eruption. At 5:30 am, the first explosion was at Perboewatan, triggering a tsunami heading to [[Telukbetung|Telok Betong]], now known as Bandar Lampung. At 6:44{{nbsp}}am, Krakatoa exploded again at Danan, with the resulting tsunami propagating eastward and westward. The third and largest explosion, at 10:02 am, was so violent that it was heard {{convert|3110|km|abbr=on}} away in [[Perth]], Western Australia and the Indian Ocean island of [[Rodrigues (island)|Rodrigues]] near [[Mauritius]], {{convert|4800|km|abbr=on}} away, where the blast was thought to have been cannon fire from a nearby ship.

White moonbeams shining through the clouds emerged blue, and sometimes green. People also saw lavender suns and, for the first time, recorded [[noctilucent cloud]]s.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Possible causes==\nThe fate of northern Krakatoa has been the subject of some dispute among geologists. It was originally proposed that the island had been blown apart by the force of the eruption. Most of the material deposited by the volcano is clearly magmatic in origin, and the caldera formed by the eruption is not extensively filled with deposits from the 1883 eruption. This indicates that the island subsided into an empty [[magma chamber]] at the end of the eruption sequence, rather than having been destroyed during the eruptions.\n\nThe established hypotheses \u2013 based on the findings of contemporary investigators \u2013 assume that part of the island subsided before the first explosions on the morning of 27 August. This forced the volcano's vents to be below sea level, causing:\n*major flooding which created a series of [[Phreatic eruption|phreatic explosions]] (interaction of ground water and magma).\n*seawater to cool the [[magma]] enough for it to crust over and produce a \"pressure cooker\" effect that was relieved only when explosive pressures were reached.\n\nThere is geological evidence which does not support the assumption that only subsidence before the explosion was the cause. For instance, the pumice and ignimbrite deposits are not of a kind consistent with a magma-seawater interaction. These findings have led to other hypotheses: \n*an underwater land slump or partial subsidence suddenly exposed the highly pressurized magma chamber, opening a pathway for seawater to enter the magma chamber and setting the stage for a magma-seawater interaction.\n*the final explosions may have been caused by [[Igneous differentiation#Magma mixing|magma mixing]]: a sudden infusion of hot basaltic magma into the cooler and lighter magma in the chamber below the volcano. This would have resulted in a rapid and unsustainable increase in pressure, leading to a cataclysmic explosion. Evidence for this theory is the existence of pumice consisting of light and dark material, the dark material being of much hotter origin. Such material reportedly is less than five per cent of the content of the Krakatoa ignimbrite and some investigators have rejected this as a prime cause of the 27 August explosions.\n[[File:KrakatoaHV.webm|thumb|Numerical model of hydrovolcanic explosion of Krakatoa and Tsunami generation]]\nA numerical model for a Krakatoa hydrovolcanic explosion and the resulting tsunami was described by [[Charles L.

One of the earliest duties of Verbeek's committee was to determine if this was true and also verify reports of other volcanoes erupting on Java and Sumatra. In general, these were found to be false, and Verbeek discounted any claims of Krakatoa still erupting after mid-October as due to steaming of hot material, landslides due to heavy monsoon rains that season, and \"hallucinations due to electrical activity\" seen from a distance.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nNo signs of further activity were seen until 1913, when an eruption was reported. Investigation could find no evidence the volcano was awakening, and it was determined that what had been mistaken for renewed activity had actually been a major landslide (possibly the one which formed the second arc to Rakata's cliff).\n\nExaminations after 1930 of [[bathymetric]] charts made in 1919 show evidence of a bulge indicative of [[magma]] near the surface at the site that became [[Krakatoa#Anak Krakatau|Anak Krakatau]].\n\n==Comparison of selected volcanic eruptions==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|+ <big>Comparison of selected volcanic eruptions {{citation needed|date = December 2018}}</big>\n|-\n!

At least 36,417 deaths are attributed to the eruption and the [[tsunami]]s it created.\n\nSignificant additional effects were also felt around the world in the days and weeks after the volcano's eruption. Additional [[seismic]] activity continued until February 1884; reports of seismic activity after October 1883 were later dismissed by [[Rogier Verbeek]]'s investigation into the eruption.\n\n==Early phase==\n\nIn the years before the 1883 eruption, seismic activity around the [[Krakatoa]] volcano was intense, with [[earthquake]]s felt as far away as Australia. Beginning on 19 May 1883, steam venting began to occur regularly from [[Perboewatan]], the northernmost of the island's three cones. Eruptions of ash reached an estimated altitude of 6&nbsp;km (20,000&nbsp;ft) and explosions could be heard in New Batavia ([[Jakarta]]) {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on}} away.<ref name=\"thornton\">{{cite book |last1=Thornton |first1=Ian W.

On 24 June, a prevailing east wind cleared the cloud, and two ash columns could be seen issuing from Krakatoa. The seat of the eruption is believed to have been a new vent or vents that formed between Perboewatan and [[Danan]]. The violence of the ongoing eruptions caused tides in the vicinity to be unusually high, and ships at anchor had to be moored with chains. Earthquakes were felt at [[Anyer]], [[Banten]], and ships began to report large [[pumice]] masses to the west in the [[Indian Ocean]].<ref name=\"thornton\"/>\n\nIn early August, a Dutch topographical engineer, Captain H. J. G. Ferzenaar, investigated the Krakatoa islands.<ref name=\"thornton\"/> He noted three major ash columns (the newer from Danan), which obscured the western part of the island, and steam plumes from at least eleven other vents, mostly between Danan and [[Rakata]]. When he landed, he noted an ash layer about {{convert|0.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}} thick, and the destruction of all vegetation, leaving only tree stumps. He advised against any further landings.<ref name=\"thornton\"/>\n\n==Climactic phase==\nBy 25 August, the Krakatoa eruptions intensified. At about 1:00 pm on 26 August, the volcano went into its [[Volcanic Explosivity Index#Classification|paroxysmal]] phase. By 2:00 pm, a black cloud of ash could be seen 27 kilometres high. At this point, the eruption was almost continuous and explosions could be heard every ten minutes or so. Ships within {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the volcano reported heavy ash fall, with pieces of hot pumice up to {{convert|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter landing on their decks. Between 7:00 pm and 8:00 pm, a small tsunami hit the shores of [[Java (island)|Java]] and [[Sumatra]], {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} away.\n\nOn 27 August, four enormous explosions occurred, which marked the climax of the eruption. At 5:30 am, the first explosion was at Perboewatan, triggering a tsunami heading to [[Telukbetung|Telok Betong]], now known as Bandar Lampung. At 6:44{{nbsp}}am, Krakatoa exploded again at Danan, with the resulting tsunami propagating eastward and westward. The third and largest explosion, at 10:02 am, was so violent that it was heard {{convert|3110|km|abbr=on}} away in [[Perth]], Western Australia and the Indian Ocean island of [[Rodrigues (island)|Rodrigues]] near [[Mauritius]], {{convert|4800|km|abbr=on}} away, where the blast was thought to have been cannon fire from a nearby ship.

White moonbeams shining through the clouds emerged blue, and sometimes green. People also saw lavender suns and, for the first time, recorded [[noctilucent cloud]]s.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Possible causes==\nThe fate of northern Krakatoa has been the subject of some dispute among geologists. It was originally proposed that the island had been blown apart by the force of the eruption. Most of the material deposited by the volcano is clearly magmatic in origin, and the caldera formed by the eruption is not extensively filled with deposits from the 1883 eruption. This indicates that the island subsided into an empty [[magma chamber]] at the end of the eruption sequence, rather than having been destroyed during the eruptions.\n\nThe established hypotheses \u2013 based on the findings of contemporary investigators \u2013 assume that part of the island subsided before the first explosions on the morning of 27 August. This forced the volcano's vents to be below sea level, causing:\n*major flooding which created a series of [[Phreatic eruption|phreatic explosions]] (interaction of ground water and magma).\n*seawater to cool the [[magma]] enough for it to crust over and produce a \"pressure cooker\" effect that was relieved only when explosive pressures were reached.\n\nThere is geological evidence which does not support the assumption that only subsidence before the explosion was the cause. For instance, the pumice and ignimbrite deposits are not of a kind consistent with a magma-seawater interaction. These findings have led to other hypotheses: \n*an underwater land slump or partial subsidence suddenly exposed the highly pressurized magma chamber, opening a pathway for seawater to enter the magma chamber and setting the stage for a magma-seawater interaction.\n*the final explosions may have been caused by [[Igneous differentiation#Magma mixing|magma mixing]]: a sudden infusion of hot basaltic magma into the cooler and lighter magma in the chamber below the volcano. This would have resulted in a rapid and unsustainable increase in pressure, leading to a cataclysmic explosion. Evidence for this theory is the existence of pumice consisting of light and dark material, the dark material being of much hotter origin. Such material reportedly is less than five per cent of the content of the Krakatoa ignimbrite and some investigators have rejected this as a prime cause of the 27 August explosions.\n[[File:KrakatoaHV.webm|thumb|Numerical model of hydrovolcanic explosion of Krakatoa and Tsunami generation]]\nA numerical model for a Krakatoa hydrovolcanic explosion and the resulting tsunami was described by [[Charles L. Mader|Mader]] & Gittings, in 2006.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mader|first=Charles L.|last2=Gittings|first2=Michael L.|year=2006|title= Numerical model for the Krakatoa hydrovolcanic explosion and tsunami|journal = Science of Tsunami Hazards|volume=24|issue=3|pages=174\u2013182|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38105928 }}</ref> A high wall of water is formed that is initially higher than 100 metres driven by the shocked water, basalt and air.\n\n==Verbeek investigation==\nAlthough the violent phase of the 1883 eruption was over by late afternoon of 27 August, after light returned by 29 August, reports continued for months that Krakatoa was still in eruption. One of the earliest duties of Verbeek's committee was to determine if this was true and also verify reports of other volcanoes erupting on Java and Sumatra. In general, these were found to be false, and Verbeek discounted any claims of Krakatoa still erupting after mid-October as due to steaming of hot material, landslides due to heavy monsoon rains that season, and \"hallucinations due to electrical activity\" seen from a distance.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nNo signs of further activity were seen until 1913, when an eruption was reported. Investigation could find no evidence the volcano was awakening, and it was determined that what had been mistaken for renewed activity had actually been a major landslide (possibly the one which formed the second arc to Rakata's cliff).\n\nExaminations after 1930 of [[bathymetric]] charts made in 1919 show evidence of a bulge indicative of [[magma]] near the surface at the site that became [[Krakatoa#Anak Krakatau|Anak Krakatau]].\n\n==Comparison of selected volcanic eruptions==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|+ <big>Comparison of selected volcanic eruptions {{citation needed|date = December 2018}}</big>\n|-\n!

The cumbersome 150cm Searchlights were abandoned and disabled as there was no means of bringing them back in time due to the rapidness of the German advance.  By 21 May the 9th, 10th, and 11th S/L batteries were finally moved into the city of [[Dunkirk]] where the 12th had been based since moving to [[France]].  Except for the 12th, the batteries helped the infantry for defence of the city except for a small group which provided a rear guard. By 27 May, the 9th, 10th, and 11th S/L were all moved to the beaches in preparation for their evacuation while the 12th battery was still engaged in air defence duties.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>Brayley, ''North-West Europe'', pp. 5-6.</ref>\n\n=== Uxem ===\nThe next week became an especially tense period for the regiment.  On the 27th the 11th battery was driven back by small arms fire, on the 28th the 10th battery was driven back by tanks and artillery, and then the 11th battery was driven back further by more tanks and a failed French artillery support mission.  When the 12th battery was attacked, they moved towards [[Uxem]] (north-east of the city) were they were tasked with holding the canal entrance bridge and manned a small number of S/L projectors to illuminate the front against night attacks. During this small engagement with the 12th battery, searchlights were used to project the defensive area on land, and this became the first known example of searchlights being used to support or defend against ground attacks.  On the 27th the 9th, 10th, and 11th batteries were relieved by infantry and pulled back to the beaches and in turn destroying their left-over equipment.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Evacuation ===\nOn the 27th while the other three (9th, 10th, and 11th batteries) retreated towards the beaches, the fourth (12th) battery was still in the middle of the city manning AA defences, despite being heavily shelled and manning a stubborn resistance.  While the other three batteries were being embarked between the 28th-30th, the 12th was ordered to send a detachment<ref group=\"Notes\">By this time the battery had been depleted smaller then battery size</ref> to the border town of [[Veurne|Furnes]], about ten miles from the Belgian border, to hold it against ground attack.  Despite the detachment being less than battery strength, they were able to hold Furnes for 36 hours until a company of the 2nd Battalion [[Coldstream Guards]] took over.  The battery then moved along the coast back towards [[Dunkirk]] where they were evacuated during the late hours of the 31st.  During their three weeks of combat, the regiment suffered a fairly small amount of casualties; 28 men killed, 41 wounded, and three taken prisoner.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Battle of Britain ===\n[[File:8th AA div.svg|thumb|Formation sign of the [[8th Anti-Aircraft Division (United Kingdom)|8th Anti-Aircraft Division]]]]\nAfter evacuating from [[France]], the regiment was assigned to home duties and concurrently joined the new [[8th Anti-Aircraft Division (United Kingdom)|8th Anti-Aircraft Division]].  The 8th AA division was formed in mid-1940 as part of the expansion of AA Command just after the beginning of the [[Battle of France]] and during the [[Phoney War]], and tasked with defending the south coast as far east as [[Bournemouth]].  Within the division, the [[64th Anti-Aircraft Brigade]] was formed to control the regiments which were tasked with defending the south-west airfields<ref group=\"Notes\">For the South-West airfields see; [https://www.southwestairfields.co.uk/page8.html Airfields, the South West Airfields Hertage Trust]</ref>.

As a result of these reforms, the number of searchlight units was reduced to just ten batteries.  As a result of these re-organisations, on 21 January 1942, the regiment was re-organised and renamed to become the '''4th (Ulster) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery'''.  By February the regiment was done converting and assigned again to [[Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces#The Second World War|Home Forces]].

This invasion would be spear-headed by the [[British Army]], [[United States Army]], [[Canadian Army]], and forces from many now Nazi controlled nations.  Just a few months after the entrance of the [[United States of America]] into the war, on the allies' side, the Nazis began construction on the [[Atlantic Wall#Creation|Atlantik Wall]] which was created in order to be able to hold, or at minimum delay, an enemy landing.<ref>Brayley, ''North-West Europe'', p. 11.</ref><ref>Ellis, ''Volume I'', p. 120.</ref>\n\nWhen the initial landings in [[Normandy]] were launched, the regiment was still based in [[England]], and would join the main forces in mid-June after a beachhead had been established.  On 7 and 14 August [[Operation Totalise]] and [[Operation Tractable]] were launched towards the area of [[Caen]] which was key for the Allies to capture if they were to maintain a foothold in the area.  During these two operations the regiment participated in the push acting in the ground-support role.

These cities provided rear lines of communication and maintained the supply dep\u00f4ts for the [[21st Army Group]] which was preparing to cross the [[Rhine]] into the [[Rhineland]] and [[Westphalia]].  As a result of these increasing threats from the [[V1 (missile)|V-1]], [[Operation Diver]] was put into effect.  As far as the mainland Europe theatre was concerned, the allies were to try and take over all, or most, of the launch sites or air bases from which they were launched.  Once [[21st Army Group]] had captured [[Brussels]] and [[Antwerp]], these cities became targets for V-1s launched from within [[Germany]], and anti-Diver or 'X' defences had to be established.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>Routledge, pp. 408-10.</ref><ref>Collier, ''Chapter XXIII The Flying Bomb:Part One (1939-1944)'', pp. 353-65.</ref>\n\nAfter the first V-1s had launched, GHQ<ref group=\"Notes\">General Headquarters</ref> AA Troops launched their plan which deployed the [[101st Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|101st Anti-Aircraft Brigade]], which had been stationed in [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]], moved to [[Brussels]] in September along with a small vanguard of the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]].  The 101st AA brigade began deployment on the 12th September with the; [[105th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|105th HAA]], [[116th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|116th HAA]], 4th (Ulster) LAA, and 367th Bty, (from 42nd (7th (Robin Hood) Btn, The Sherwood Foresters S/L Regt) under its command.  After arriving in the area of [[Brussels]], the AA defences amounted to; 5 HAA regiments, 2 LAA regiments, and 2 S/L batteries.  [[Brussels]] at this point was only covered by the British 101 AA Bgd, and [[Antwerp]] by the US [[50th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Brigade (United States)|50th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Brigade]].<ref name=\":5\">Routledge, p. 336-8.</ref>\n\nTo deal not only with conventional air raids but also the threat of V-1 flying bombs (code-named 'Divers'), the planners envisaged a large Gun Defence Area (GDA) integrated into a system ('Brussels X' ) of warning stations and observation posts, supported by radar and searchlights.  On 21 October the first bombs were launched against [[Brussels]].<ref name=\":5\" />  The organisation of these posts and lines were organised into three 'lines';<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n* (1st) Wireless Observation Units (WOUs) line; sited 40 to 50 miles in front of the guns to give eight minutes' warning by radio of a missile's<ref group=\"Notes\">At this point the term 'missile' wasn't being used, but will be said for simplicity.</ref> approach.  At first, these covered south-east to east but were extended round to north.  WOUs were grouped in fives and each groups had a LW radar manned by the [[RAF]].\n* (2nd) Local Warning Stations (LWS) line; in an intermediate zone at about half the distance of the WOUs, each containing one Radar No.4 Mark V and two No.4 Mark IIIs, working in mutual support to track individual missile courses which could be passed to gun positions by way of an AAOR.  Four such stations formed a troops, and missile tracks given a code number to identify them for engagement.\n* (3rd) An inner belt of observation posts, about 20,000 yards in front of the guns, to give visual confirmation that the tracked target was a missile.  Up to 12 such posts were groups as a troop.\n\nSometime before the end of the year, the regiment was replaced by the [[30th (Suffolk) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|30th (Suffolk) LAA]] and [[73rd Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|73rd LAA]] regiments.  In March 1945 the regiment was moved towards the banks of the [[Rhine]] where it divided some batteries to protect the [[Rhine]] bridges and crossings.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref>Routledge, p. 360.</ref><ref>Routledge, ''Table LVII'', p. 366</ref>\n\n== Post War ==\nFollowing the end of hostilities, by 1946 most territorial artillery regiments had been either disbanded or placed in suspended animation.  On 1 January 1947 many of these regiments were reconstituted and many new regiments were formed as part of the reformed and re-organised [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA), with new numbers according to the renumbering plan for the complete re-designation of all [[Royal Artillery]] units, both regular and territorial.  There were at that time several territorial artillery units still on operational deployments in various theatres overseas.  Thus, on 31 December 1946 these regiments were disbanded and then reformed one day after, on 1 January 1947.  RHQ & the btys were placed in [[suspended animation]] on 1 January 1947 at [[Lydd Camp]], [[Kent]] and personnel moved to form new units of the RA with the same numbers.  Following reformation the TA regiments of the [[Royal Artillery]] adopted a 'standard' organisation which consisted of; RHQ, P, Q, and R Batteries all of which were based in [[Belfast]].<ref name=\":6\">Litchfield, pp. 5-6.</ref><ref>Frederick, p. 820.</ref><ref name=\":11\">Frederick, p. 996.</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Royal Artillery|Royal Artillery's]] renumbering system, light anti-aircraft regiments were granted numbers between 512 and 558, but due to the regiment being part of the [[Militia#The Special Reserve|Supplementary Reserve]], they were granted a number between 201-255.  As a result of this re-organisation, the regiment was re-formed into two regiments numbered as the '''247th (Ulster) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery''' now reformed into the [[Territorial Army (UK)|Territorial Army]] and the '''248th (Ulster) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery''' newly formed and based in [[Belfast]].  In 1949 the regiment was re-organised into a mixed searchlight and LAA unit, becoming the '''247th (Ulster) Light Anti-Aircraft/Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery'''.  Finally, in 1955 following extensive reviews, AA defence (as far as AA guns) was deemed 'obsolete' with the coming of the missile age, so following a [[War Office]] decision, all regiments of [[Anti-Aircraft Command]] were disbanded or merged/converted.  As a result of these re-organisations, the regiment was merged with the other four [[Northern Ireland]] AA regiments to form the new [[245th (Ulster) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery]] which was eventually amalgamated with the [[445th (Lowland) Light Air Defence Regiment, Royal Artillery]] to form the [[102nd (Ulster and Scottish) Light Air Defence Regiment, Royal Artillery|102nd (Ulster & Scottish) Light Air Defence Regiment]], which was later reduced to [[206 (Ulster) Battery Royal Artillery|206 (Ulster) Battery]] in 1992, which continues to be based in [[Belfast]] under the [[105th Regiment Royal Artillery|105th Regiment, Royal Artillery]] (V).<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref>Routledge, pp. 441.</ref><ref>Wienand Drenth & T.

They were then preparing their regular home defence role, in addition to working in participation with the local [[8th (Belfast) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|8th (Belfast)]], [[9th (Londonderry) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|9th (Londonderry)]] and [[102nd Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|102nd (Ulster)]] Heavy AA regiments.  In October as the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) began forming, the [[War Office]] (WO) became increasingly worried by the lack of AA units<ref group=\"Notes\">Searchlight (S/L) are considered AA along with the HAA, LAA, and MG-AA units</ref> assigned to the soon to form BEF.  As a result of the this, the war office announced the movement of; three HAA ([[8th (Belfast) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|8th (Belfast)]], [[79th (Hertfordshire Yeomanry) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|79th (Hertfordshire Yeomanry)]], and [[85th (Tees) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|85th (Tees)]]), two S/L regiments ([[2nd Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery|2nd (Militia)]] and 3rd (Ulster)), and one LAA ([[38th (West Yorkshire) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|38th (West Yorkshire)]]) along with an independent battery attached from the [[37th (Tyne Electrical Engineers) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery|37th (Tyne Electrical Engineers) S/L Regt]], to join the BEF.  In November the regiment was assigned to the Home Forces Command, moved to [[Bordon]] near [[Aldershot Garrison|Aldershot]], and in December moved to [[France]] to join the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]].<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":17\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":8\">Routledge, p. 116.</ref>\n\n=== Battle of France ===\n[[File:The British Army in the United Kingdom 1939-45 H35912.jpg|thumb|150cm Searchlight with AA Radar No.2 attached.]]\nDue to the recent expansion of AA units in [[France]], the [[4th Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|4th]] and [[5th Searchlight Brigade (United Kingdom)|5th (Searchlight) Anti-Aircraft Brigades]]' headquarters were moved to [[France]] and took control of these newly assigned units.  As a result of these moves, the regiment was assigned to the [[5th Searchlight Brigade (United Kingdom)|5th (Searchlight) Anti-Aircraft Brigade]] along with the [[1st Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery|1st (Regular) S/L]] and [[2nd Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery|2nd (Militia) S/L]] regiments.  In May 1940 the regiment manned forward gun zones along with their regular colleagues from the 1st and 2nd searchlight regiments, and tasked with defending and supporting the HAA batteries during night raids and assist them when needed<ref group=\"Notes\">LAA units controlled some LMGs during this time.</ref>.  During this period, the 9th, 10th, and 11th S/L batteries were in the area between [[Lille]] and [[Bethune]], while the 12th S/L Bty was in [[Dunkirk]].  On 8 May 1940, the regiment was renamed, in accordance with the re-organisation of the [[Royal Artillery]], to become the '''3rd (Ulster) Searchlight Regiment, RA (SR)''' to distinguish itself as a SR unit as apposed to the regular regiments based in the area.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":17\" /><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":8\" /><ref>Routledge, ''Table XVIII'', p. 126.</ref><ref>Joslen, p. 462.</ref><ref name=\":1\">Routledge, pp. 121-2.</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Battle of France]] and concurrent Invasion of the Low Countries launched, the regiment supported HAA units during their defence against heavy German fighter attacks and took special advantage of illuminating bombers during the night time raids.  During the initial attacks on the night of the 10th, [[Dukirk|Dunkirk]] was heavily attacked, and the 12th S/L battery was involved by assisting the HAA batteries there with both searchlights and machine-guns. After three days, the [[Luftwaffe (Wehrmacht)|Luftwaffe]] concentrated on attacking the airfields manned by the [[Royal Air Force]]'s [[RAF Advanced Air Striking Force|Advanced Air Striking Force]] which were based in the [[Somme (department)|Somme]] area.  As these attacks increased, the regiment's three batteries based near [[Lille]] were separated to the RAF bases in the area, equipped with more machine-guns, and given a duel LAA/ground support role.<ref name=\":1\" />\n[[File:The British Army in France 1940 F4186.jpg|left|thumb|Searchlight of the 12th S/L Bty in [[Dunkirk]] (1940)]]\n\n=== Dunkirk ===\nWhen the German [[Army Group B]] moved through the [[Ardennes]] and pushed through the south of the BEF, 9th S/L battery was rushed to [[Arras]] to defend the area by digging-in and defending its perimeter. By the time of the push in the south, the regiment was scattered from [[Vimy Ridge]] to [[Arras]], but on 19 May was order back to [[Dunkirk]] in independent groups as part of [[Operation Dynamo]].  The cumbersome 150cm Searchlights were abandoned and disabled as there was no means of bringing them back in time due to the rapidness of the German advance.  By 21 May the 9th, 10th, and 11th S/L batteries were finally moved into the city of [[Dunkirk]] where the 12th had been based since moving to [[France]].  Except for the 12th, the batteries helped the infantry for defence of the city except for a small group which provided a rear guard. By 27 May, the 9th, 10th, and 11th S/L were all moved to the beaches in preparation for their evacuation while the 12th battery was still engaged in air defence duties.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>Brayley, ''North-West Europe'', pp. 5-6.</ref>\n\n=== Uxem ===\nThe next week became an especially tense period for the regiment.  On the 27th the 11th battery was driven back by small arms fire, on the 28th the 10th battery was driven back by tanks and artillery, and then the 11th battery was driven back further by more tanks and a failed French artillery support mission.  When the 12th battery was attacked, they moved towards [[Uxem]] (north-east of the city) were they were tasked with holding the canal entrance bridge and manned a small number of S/L projectors to illuminate the front against night attacks. During this small engagement with the 12th battery, searchlights were used to project the defensive area on land, and this became the first known example of searchlights being used to support or defend against ground attacks.  On the 27th the 9th, 10th, and 11th batteries were relieved by infantry and pulled back to the beaches and in turn destroying their left-over equipment.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Evacuation ===\nOn the 27th while the other three (9th, 10th, and 11th batteries) retreated towards the beaches, the fourth (12th) battery was still in the middle of the city manning AA defences, despite being heavily shelled and manning a stubborn resistance.  While the other three batteries were being embarked between the 28th-30th, the 12th was ordered to send a detachment<ref group=\"Notes\">By this time the battery had been depleted smaller then battery size</ref> to the border town of [[Veurne|Furnes]], about ten miles from the Belgian border, to hold it against ground attack.  Despite the detachment being less than battery strength, they were able to hold Furnes for 36 hours until a company of the 2nd Battalion [[Coldstream Guards]] took over.  The battery then moved along the coast back towards [[Dunkirk]] where they were evacuated during the late hours of the 31st.  During their three weeks of combat, the regiment suffered a fairly small amount of casualties; 28 men killed, 41 wounded, and three taken prisoner.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Battle of Britain ===\n[[File:8th AA div.svg|thumb|Formation sign of the [[8th Anti-Aircraft Division (United Kingdom)|8th Anti-Aircraft Division]]]]\nAfter evacuating from [[France]], the regiment was assigned to home duties and concurrently joined the new [[8th Anti-Aircraft Division (United Kingdom)|8th Anti-Aircraft Division]].  The 8th AA division was formed in mid-1940 as part of the expansion of AA Command just after the beginning of the [[Battle of France]] and during the [[Phoney War]], and tasked with defending the south coast as far east as [[Bournemouth]].  Within the division, the [[64th Anti-Aircraft Brigade]] was formed to control the regiments which were tasked with defending the south-west airfields<ref group=\"Notes\">For the South-West airfields see; [https://www.southwestairfields.co.uk/page8.html Airfields, the South West Airfields Hertage Trust]</ref>.

As a result of these reforms, the number of searchlight units was reduced to just ten batteries.  As a result of these re-organisations, on 21 January 1942, the regiment was re-organised and renamed to became the '''4th (Ulster) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery'''.  By February the regiment was done converting and assigned again to [[Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces#The Second World War|Home Forces]].

This invasion would be spear-headed by the [[British Army]], [[United States Army]], [[Canadian Army]], and forces from many now Nazi controlled nations.  Just a few months after the entrance of the [[United States of America]] into the war, on the allies' side, the Nazis began construction on the [[Atlantic Wall#Creation|Atlantik Wall]] which was created in order to be able to hold, or at minimum delay, an enemy landing.<ref>Brayley, ''North-West Europe'', p. 11.</ref><ref>Ellis, ''Volume I'', p. 120.</ref>\n\nWhen the initial landings in [[Normandy]] were launched, the regiment was still based in [[England]], and would join the main forces in mid-June after a beachhead had been established.  On 7 and 14 August [[Operation Totalise]] and [[Operation Tractable]] were launched towards the area of [[Caen]] which was key for the Allies to capture if they were to maintain a foothold in the area.

These cities provided rear lines of communication and maintained the supply dep\u00f4ts for the [[21st Army Group]] which was preparing to cross the [[Rhine]] into the [[Rhineland]] and [[Westphalia]].  As a result of these increasing threats from the [[V1 (missile)|V-1]], [[Operation Diver]] was put into effect.  As far as the mainland Europe theatre was concerned, the allies were to try and take over all, or most, of the launch sites or air bases from which they were launched.  Once [[21st Army Group]] had captured [[Brussels]] and [[Antwerp]], these cities became targets for V-1s launched from within [[Germany]], and anti-Diver or 'X' defences had to be established.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>Routledge, pp. 408-10.</ref><ref>Collier, ''Chapter XXIII The Flying Bomb:Part One (1939-1944)'', pp. 353-65.</ref>\n\nAfter the first V-1s had launched, GHQ<ref group=\"Notes\">General Headquarters</ref> AA Troops launched their plan which deployed the [[101st Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|101st Anti-Aircraft Brigade]], which had been stationed in [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]], moved to [[Brussels]] in September along with a small vanguard of the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]].  The 101st AA brigade began deployment on the 12th September with the; [[105th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|105th HAA]], [[116th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|116th HAA]], 4th (Ulster) LAA, and 367th Bty, (from 42nd (7th (Robin Hood) Btn, The Sherwood Foresters S/L Regt) under its command.  After arriving in the area of [[Brussels]], the AA defences amounted to; 5 HAA regiments, 2 LAA regiments, and 2 S/L batteries.  [[Brussels]] at this point was only covered by the British 101 AA Bgd, and [[Antwerp]] by the US [[50th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Brigade (United States)|50th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Brigade]].<ref name=\":5\">Routledge, p. 336-8.</ref>\n\nTo deal not only with conventional air raids but also the threat of V-1 flying bombs (code-named 'Divers'), the planners envisaged a large Gun Defence Area (GDA) integrated into a system ('Brussels X' ) of warning stations and observation posts, supported by radar and searchlights.  On 21 October the first bombs were launched against [[Brussels]].<ref name=\":5\" />  The organisation of these posts and lines were organised into three 'lines';<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n* (1st) Wireless Observation Units (WOUs) line; sited 40 to 50 miles in front of the guns to give eight minutes' warning by radio of a missile's<ref group=\"Notes\">At this point the term 'missile' wasn't being used, but will be said for simplicity.</ref> approach.  At first, these covered south-east to east but were extended round to north.  WOUs were grouped in fives and each groups had a LW radar manned by the [[RAF]].\n* (2nd) Local Warning Stations (LWS) line; in an intermediate zone at about half the distance of the WOUs, each containing one Radar No.4 Mark V and two No.4 Mark IIIs, working in mutual support to track individual missile courses which could be passed to gun positions by way of an AAOR.  Four such stations formed a troops, and missile tracks given a code number to identify them for engagement.\n* (3rd) An inner belt of observation posts, about 20,000 yards in front of the guns, to give visual confirmation that the tracked target was a missile.  Up to 12 such posts were groups as a troop.\n\nSometime before the end of the year, the regiment was replaced by the [[30th (Suffolk) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|30th (Suffolk) LAA]] and [[73rd Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|73rd LAA]] regiments.  In March 1945 the regiment was moved towards the banks of the [[Rhine]] where it divided some batteries to protect the [[Rhine]] bridges and crossings.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref>Routledge, p. 360.</ref><ref>Routledge, ''Table LVII'', p. 366</ref>\n\n== Post War ==\nFollowing the end of hostilities, by 1946 most territorial artillery regiments had been either disbanded or placed in suspended animation.  On 1 January 1947 many of these regiments were reconstituted and many new regiments were formed as part of the reformed and re-organised [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA), with new numbers according to the renumbering plan for the complete re-designation of all [[Royal Artillery]] units, both regular and territorial.  There were at that time several territorial artillery units still on operational deployments in various theatres overseas.  Thus, on 31 December 1946 these regiments were disbanded and then reformed one day after, on 1 January 1947.  RHQ & the btys were placed in [[suspended animation]] on 1 January 1947 at [[Lydd Camp]], [[Kent]] and personnel moved to form new units of the RA with the same numbers.  Following reformation the TA regiments of the [[Royal Artillery]] adopted a 'standard' organisation which consisted of; RHQ, P, Q, and R Batteries all of which were based in [[Belfast]].<ref name=\":6\">Litchfield, pp. 5-6.</ref><ref>Frederick, p. 820.</ref><ref name=\":11\">Frederick, p. 996.</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Royal Artillery|Royal Artillery's]] renumbering system, light anti-aircraft regiments were granted numbers between 512 and 558, but due to the regiment being part of the [[Militia#The Special Reserve|Supplementary Reserve]], they were granted a number between 201-255.  As a result of this re-organisation, the regiment was re-formed into two regiments numbered as the '''247th (Ulster) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery''' now reformed into the [[Territorial Army (UK)|Territorial Army]] and the '''248th (Ulster) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery''' newly formed and based in [[Belfast]].  In 1949 the regiment was re-organised into a mixed searchlight and LAA unit, becoming the '''247th (Ulster) Light Anti-Aircraft/Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery'''.  Finally, in 1955 following extensive reviews, AA defence (as far as AA guns) was deemed 'obsolete' with the coming of the missile age, so following a [[War Office]] decision, all regiments of [[Anti-Aircraft Command]] were disbanded or merged/converted.  As a result of these re-organisations, the regiment was merged with the other four [[Northern Ireland]] AA regiments to form the new [[245th (Ulster) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery]] which was eventually amalgamated with the [[445th (Lowland) Light Air Defence Regiment, Royal Artillery]] to form the [[102nd (Ulster and Scottish) Light Air Defence Regiment, Royal Artillery|102nd (Ulster & Scottish) Light Air Defence Regiment]], which was later reduced to [[206 (Ulster) Battery Royal Artillery|206 (Ulster) Battery]] in 1992, which continues to be based in [[Belfast]] under the [[105th Regiment Royal Artillery|105th Regiment, Royal Artillery]] (V).<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref>Routledge, pp. 441.</ref><ref>Wienand Drenth & T.
