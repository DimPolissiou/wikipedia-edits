Helicopter reporter Ken Loney calls in with a report about a riot at the office of Dr. Joe Mendez that has resulted in numerous deaths. After Ken is unexpectedly cut off, the group tries to confirm his report, but their witnesses are disconnected before being put on the airwaves. After they are contacted by the [[BBC]] for [[Breaking news|breaking the story]], Ken calls back and says he has taken refuge in a grain silo. He describes the rioters as trying to eat one another or even themselves. When one of the rioters attacks the silo, Ken's call is interrupted by an audio transmission in French.\n\nLaurel-Ann translates the transmission, which is an instruction to remain indoors, not to use [[terms of endearment]], rhetorical discourse, or the English language and not to translate the message. Pontypool is declared to be under quarantine. Ken calls back again and gets his phone close enough to his attacker so that his murmurs of \"Help me\" are audible. A horde of people attack the radio station, and Grant, Sydney, and Laurel-Ann lock themselves inside. Meanwhile, Laurel-Ann begins repeating the word \"missing\" and imitates the sound of a tea kettle. \n\nDr. Mendez arrives at the radio station through a window and hides with Grant and Sydney in the soundproof booth. Ken calls in and, while on the air, succumbs to the virus. Laurel-Ann begins to slam her head against the sound booth's window and chews off her lower lip. Mendez hypothesizes that a virus has infected certain words in the English language; only certain words infect certain people who then find another infected person to kill themselves with. Sydney manages to call her children, only to hear them becoming infected. Outside the booth, Laurel-Ann vomits a large amount of blood and falls down, dead. Mendez suspects this has happened since she failed to find a victim.\n\nThe horde then breaks into the radio station, attacking the sound booth. Sydney draws the mob outside with a looped recording of Grant's voice. When he fears that he is about to succumb to the virus, Dr. Mendez begins to speak in Armenian upon realizing that the virus is exclusive to the English language, which prevents the virus from taking over. When the recording fails, the mob returns but Mendez lures them away, saving Sydney and Grant, who now lock themselves in the equipment room.\n\nWhile Grant tries to figure out how to reverse the symptom, Sydney begins to succumb to the word \"kill\". Grant convinces her that the word \"kill\" now means \"kiss\" and her symptoms subside. Hoping to stop the virus, the pair go on the air, spouting a series of self-contradicting and confusing phrases to help their infected listeners, ignoring warnings from the authorities who are trying to get them off the air. While an amplified voice from outside counts down from ten, Sydney joins Grant in the booth and they kiss. An explosion can be heard when the film cuts to black. \n\nOver the black, news reports of further outbreaks of the virus suggest that the quarantine failed, spread by the news itself and eventually reaching [[England]], the source of its targeted language. In a [[post-credits scene]], Sydney and Grant survive the virus and continue speaking English by maintaining a system of improvisational roleplay as the screen shifts from black and white to color.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Stephen McHattie]] as Grant Mazzy\n* Lisa Houle as Sydney Briar\n* [[Georgina Reilly]] as Laurel-Ann Drummond\n* [[Hrant Alianak]] as Dr. Mendez\n* [[Rick Roberts (actor)|Rick Roberts]] as Ken Loney\n* [[Boyd Banks]] as Jay (Osama)\n* [[Tony Burgess (author)|Tony Burgess]] as Tony (Lawrence)\n* Rachel Burns as Colin (Daud)\n\n==Production==\n''Pontypool'' is based on Tony Burgess' novel ''[[Pontypool Changes Everything]]''.

After launching a campaign to raise the money for an operation to resolve the problem, for which he raised only $2,000, he underwent surgery in April 2013 after visiting Dr. Joel Gelman of the University of California, Irvine's Center for Reconstructive Urology, who was aware that Warren could not afford the surgery and so performed it for free. Warren's struggles with his condition and his subsequent operation were filmed by a British television crew for a documentary ''The Man with the 10-Stone Testicles'', which aired on [[Channel 4]] in the United Kingdom on June 24, 2013. He died of complications from [[diabetes]] on March 14, 2014.\n\n==Onset of Warren's condition==\nBorn in [[Orange, New Jersey]] on June 23, 1963,<ref name=\"C4\">''The Man with the 10-Stone Testicles''. Channel June 4, 24, 2013</ref> Warren was a former resident of [[New York City]], where he worked in security and as a messenger. He moved to Las Vegas in the 1990s and worked on commission to find locations for [[automated teller machine]]s in the [[Las Vegas Valley]]. He fell ill in late 2008 and attributed the onset of his condition to accidentally striking his testicles while sleeping. He said: \"I had never felt such pain. It was like a shooting pain through my entire body. When it stopped, it was like a huge tractor trailer went off the top of me. I think it ruined my lymph nodes down there\".<ref name=\"100 pound scrotum\">{{cite news|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/health/las-vegas-man-100-pound-scrotum-seeks-money-surgery|title=Las Vegas man with 100-pound scrotum seeks money for surgery|last=Harasim|first=Paul|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=October 16, 2011|accessdate=June 20, 2013}}</ref> The following morning he found that his scrotum had swelled to \"the size of a soccer ball\".<ref name=\"100 pound scrotum\" />\n\nWarren's condition was not unknown in the tropics, but is very rare in the United States. In tropical regions, it is caused by parasites that are spread by mosquitoes, causing an infection called lymphatic filariasis. Parasitic worms block the body's [[lymphatic system]] and cause fluids to collect, resulting in a swelling called [[lymphedema]]. In Warren's case, however, doctors found no trace of an infection and suggested that it may have resulted from trauma.<ref name=\"100 pound scrotum\" />\n\nHe underwent a two-week course of antibiotics, but this had little effect and a series of doctors, including a lymphedema specialist, were unable to find a solution. The swelling continued to grow to such a size that he became unable to work. In early 2010 he underwent an eight-week course of treatment at [[University Medical Center of Southern Nevada|University Medical Center]] in Las Vegas. They were unable to determine the cause of the swelling, writing up 20 different documentations in the process. He was given multiple courses of antibiotics and anti-viral medications, which failed to resolve the condition.<ref name=\"100 pound scrotum\" />\n\nThe lymphedema had a severe effect on Warren's personal life and health. He already weighed {{convert|300|lb}} before the onset of the condition and he suffered from high blood pressure and asthma. The swelling increased his weight to about {{convert|450|lb}}. Because his penis and testicles were enclosed by his gigantic scrotum, he was unable to urinate normally or to have sex. Simply keeping his scrotum under cover was a challenge in itself, which he eventually solved by wearing an upside-down full-size [[hooded sweatshirt]] over it with his legs in the sleeves. Traveling on buses required him to bring along a milk crate and a cushion on which to rest his scrotum during the journey.<ref name=\"100 pound scrotum\" /> As travel was so difficult, he would spend most of his time in his apartment's living room watching television while propping his scrotum on top of the milk crate.<ref name=\"Scrotum surgery\" />\n\nWarren's doctor advised him to seek surgery on [[Medicaid]], which would involve cutting away the swollen tissue and performing reconstructive surgery, including skin grafts to restore his penis and testicles. However, Warren was advised that they might have to be removed along with the tissue. This was not welcome news: \"Basically, he was telling me there was a good chance that I would be castrated and have to go to the bathroom through a tube for the rest of my life. I really would like to have a relationship with a woman. I should be in the prime of my life right now.\"<ref name=\"100 pound scrotum\" />\n\n==Fund-raising campaign==\nAt a further evaluation at the [[Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center]] in California, he was advised that there was a better chance of saving his penis and testicles, but that the procedure would cost a seven-figure sum, which he did not have. In the hope of raising the money, he went public in a segment on [[Howard Stern]]'s radio and TV show and set up an address to receive offers of help or financial support. He said: \"I don't like being a freak, who would? But I figured that the Stern show is listened to by millions of people and they might want to help me. I hope some millionaire or billionaire will want to help me.\"<ref name=\"100 pound scrotum\" /> He acknowledged that the choice of address was not the classiest, but it was at least memorable, and noted that ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' was a good platform for him to make an appearance as its audience is predominantly male.<ref name=\"Man has surgery\">{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/man-surgery-134-pound-scrotum/story?id=19091787|title=Man Has Surgery for 134-Pound Scrotum|last=Moisse|first=Katie|publisher=ABC News|date=May 7, 2013|accessdate=June 20, 2013}}</ref>\n\nWarren's appearance attracted widespread media interest.

However, he was said to be \"worried he's too big to get in the airplane bathroom for the flight.\" Dr. Joel Gelman of the [[University of California, Irvine]]'s [https://centerforreconstructiveurology.org Center for Reconstructive Urology] also offered to carry out the surgery and waive his normal fee if the use of the hospital's facilities was paid for by Nevada Medicaid. He told the ''Las Vegas Review-Journal'' that to date, he had \"never lost a patient or a testicle.\"<ref name=\"Giant scrotum\" />\n\nThe operation was carried out on April 8, 2013, by Gelman and three other surgeons who had donated their expertise.<ref name=\"Scrotum surgery\" /> Warren's weight by this stage had increased to {{convert|552|lb}} and his penis was buried {{convert|1|ft|cm}} inside his testicle sac.<ref name=\"C4\" /> The 13-hour operation required all four surgeons to cut away Warren's engorged scrotum simultaneously while carrying out [[skin graft]]s to cover Warren's newly exposed penis and testicles. Warren's severe [[anemia]] complicated the task<ref name=\"Scrotum surgery\" /> and the surgeons discovered that some of the veins in the mass were as much as quarter of an inch (6&nbsp;mm) wide. According to Gelman, \"With the fluid and other tissues, I would say the total weight he was carrying around probably exceeded 160 pounds [72 kg].\"<ref name=\"Man has surgery\" /> The operation, which was recorded by a British film crew, was followed by a program of physical therapy which began a week afterwards. He was released from hospital in late April and was reportedly recuperating in nearby housing.<ref name=\"Scrotum surgery\">{{cite news|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/las-vegas/scrotum-surgery-leaves-las-vegas-man-132-pounds-lighter|title=Scrotum surgery leaves Las Vegas man 132 pounds lighter|last=Harasim|first=Paul|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=April 30, 2013|accessdate=June 20, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe operation went ahead, even though Gelman had not yet received authorization from Nevada Medicaid, as he felt that it was unfair to Warren to \"endure a cancellation.\" Gelman was critical of Nevada Medicaid's stance, saying that it's \"terrible that Nevada isn't handling this the right way. When there's no expertise in a state to handle something, it doesn't seem right that Nevada can't pay the hospital when the doctors work for free.\" He commented that he and the other surgeons had donated their expertise not only to help Warren, but to show to other sufferers from scrotal elephantiasis that something could be done for them as well. He was optimistic about Warren's future: \"There are a lot of shows about makeovers, but this is a real makeover. He's basically a new man.\"<ref name=\"Scrotum surgery\" />\n\n==Documentary==\nFirecracker Films' documentary film, titled ''The Man with the 10-Stone Testicles'', was aired on the British television network [[Channel 4]] on June 24, 2013, as part of their [[anthology series]] ''[[Body Shock]]''.<ref name=\"C4 prog 28\">{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/bodyshock/episode-guide/series-28/episode-1|title=The Man with the 10-Stone Testicles|publisher=Channel 4|accessdate=June 20, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from the British media.

When there's no expertise in a state to handle something, it doesn't seem right that Nevada can't pay the hospital when the doctors work for free.\" He commented that he and the other surgeons had donated their expertise not only to help Warren, but to show to other sufferers from scrotal elephantiasis that something could be done for them as well.

In 2010, [[Alyson Hannigan]] won the [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for Favorite TV Comedy Actress. In 2012, seven years after its premiere, the series won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Network TV Comedy, and Neil Patrick Harris won the award for Favorite TV Comedy Actor.\n\n==Premise==\nThe series follows the adventures of [[Ted Mosby]] (played by [[Josh Radnor]]), who narrates the story of how he met the mother of his children. The story goes into a flashback and starts in 2005 with the 27-year-old Ted Mosby living in New York City and working as an architect. The narrative deals primarily with his best friends, including the long-lasting couple [[Marshall Eriksen]] ([[Jason Segel]]) and [[Lily Aldrin]] ([[Alyson Hannigan]]), [[womanizing]] playboy [[Barney Stinson]] ([[Neil Patrick Harris]]), and Canadian news reporter [[Robin Scherbatsky]] ([[Cobie Smulders]]); all of the characters' lives are entwined. The series explores many storylines, including a \"will they or won't they\" relationship between Robin and each of the two single male friends, Marshall and Lily's relationship, and the ups and downs of the characters' careers.\n\nThe show's [[frame story]] depicts Ted (voice of [[Bob Saget]], uncredited) verbally retelling the story to his son Luke ([[David Henrie]]) and daughter Penny ([[Lyndsy Fonseca]]) as they sit on the couch in the year 2030. This future-set frame is officially the show's \"present day\", and ''How I Met Your Mother'' exploits this framing device in numerous ways: to depict and re-depict events from multiple points of view; to set up jokes using quick and sometimes multiple [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] nested within the oral retelling; to substitute visual, verbal, or aural euphemisms for activities Ted does not want to talk about with his children (sexual practices, use of illicit substances, vulgar language, etc.); and even to add some elements of humor: in the episode \"[[How I Met Everyone Else]]\", Ted describes his dates with a girlfriend whose name he has forgotten, leading all characters to act as though her given name were \"Blah-Blah\"; later in the series, Ted remembers her name is Carol.\n\nWhile the traditional love story structure begins when the romantic leads first encounter each other, ''How I Met Your Mother'' does not introduce Ted's wife ([[Cristin Milioti]]) until the eighth-season finale and only announces her name ([[List of How I Met Your Mother characters#The Mother (Tracy McConnell)|Tracy McConnell]]) during the series finale. The show instead focuses on Ted's prior relationships and his dissatisfaction with those women, thus setting the stage for his eventual happiness with Tracy. Finally in present 2030, six years after Tracy's death, Ted gets back with Robin, which viewers may have assumed at the series finale when Ted is standing outside Robin's window. Ted's children were the ones to realize first that Ted was still in love with Robin, through the stories he told.\n\n==Production==\n''How I Met Your Mother'' was inspired by Carter Bays and Craig Thomas' idea to \"write about our friends and the stupid stuff we did in New York\", where they previously worked as writers for ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', among others.<ref name=eonline/> The two drew from their friendship in creating the characters. Ted is based loosely on Bays, and Marshall and Lily are based loosely on Thomas and his wife.<ref name=\"casting\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whedon.info/Alyson-Hannigan-How-I-Met-Your,14745.html| title= Alyson Hannigan&nbsp;\u2013 \"How I Met Your Mother\" Sitcom&nbsp;\u2013 William S.

This story is told by the Older Ted Mosby, and narrator of the series, [[Bob Saget]]. Ted moved to [[New York City]] with his friends Marshall and Lily after graduating from [[Wesleyan University]]. In New York, he met Barney at the urinal of MacLaren's and Robin, to whom he was immediately attracted. Ted is on a quest for happiness and \"The One\", the woman he will marry.

He goes to great lengths to profess his love to the women in his life, but they all falter eventually. Despite these qualities, Ted often acts immaturely, such as partaking in wild activities with Barney. In the show's finale, he says, that, in Tracy, he had met the love of his life (the titular Mother), but only after he was finished telling the story he realized that Robin was the love of his life.\n* [[Jason Segel]] as [[Marshall Eriksen]], Ted Mosby's best friend. Marshall and Ted are assigned to be roommates at Wesleyan University, and remained living together when they move to New York City. In season 2 Marshall marries Lily, with whom he has been in love since his freshman year of college; they have a child during season 7. Marshall was born in [[St. Cloud, Minnesota]], where his family and culture are the foundation to major conflicts he faces in the series. He has an interest in the paranormal phenomenon, and mythical creatures, particularly [[Sasquatch]]. His dream to be an environmental lawyer, conflicts with his immediate need for money, such as for his wedding and to raise his children.\n* [[Cobie Smulders]] as [[Robin Scherbatsky]], a news anchor who is trying to make it as a journalist and dates both Ted and Barney. Robin emigrated from Canada to take a job in a news station and met Ted at MacLaren's; her Canadian background is a source of many jokes from her friends, for instance, \u2018Robin Sparkles\u2019. She is shown to be very career-centric and rejects traditional roles, such as getting married and having kids. Robin often drinks scotch and smokes cigars, and she is an avid gun fan. She and Barney get engaged and later marry in the first part of the series finale, but divorce in the second part, three years later. Smulders' husband [[Taran Killam]] appeared in six episodes as Gary Blauman. \n* [[Neil Patrick Harris]] as [[Barney Stinson]] is a serial playboy, using his relative wealth and an array of outrageous strategies to seduce women with no intention of engaging in a relationship. His catchphrases include 'Suit Up' and 'Legend-wait-for-it-Dary'. He is Ted's other best friend. Abandoned by his father at a young age, Barney has [[Abandonment (emotional)|abandonment issues]] and clings to his friends. Barney tells his friends extravagant lies about events in his life as a defence mechanism for his substandard childhood. He marries Robin in the series finale but they divorce after three years. In 2020, a failed one-night stand gives him a daughter, Ellie. Harris' husband [[David Burtka]] has appeared in seven episodes as Scooter. \n* [[Alyson Hannigan]] as [[Lily Aldrin]], a kindergarten teacher, an aspiring artist, and Marshall's wife. She is terrible at keeping secrets and can be manipulative at times. She marries Marshall in season 2 and gives birth to Marvin in season 7. Though appearing sweet and cute, Lily can be quite unexpectedly fierce. Lily Aldrin's best girl friend is Robin Scherbatsky, who she met through Ted as he dated Robin. Hannigan's husband [[Alexis Denisof]] appeared in ten episodes as Sandy Rivers. \n* [[Cristin Milioti]] as [[Tracy McConnell]] ({{small|guest - season 8; main - season 9}}),<ref name=TVLine20130517/> (although only appearing occasionally, 28 episodes out of 208, she plays an integral part in the show in the build-up to the finale) the future wife of Ted Mosby, The Mother. Tracy McConnell is first seen in the finale of season 8, though her name is hinted at in season 1 (01x09 \"Belly full of Turkey\") and officially revealed in the series finale. Ted falls madly in love with her, but in 2024 she passes away.\n* [[Bob Saget]] as Future Ted Mosby ({{small|voice only, uncredited}}) in the year 2030 telling his children the story of how he met their mother.\n\n==Season synopsis==\n{{Main|List of How I Met Your Mother episodes}}\n{{:List of How I Met Your Mother episodes}}\n{{Anchor|Plot}}\n\n===Season 1===\n{{Main|How I Met Your Mother (season 1)}}\nIn the year 2030, [[Ted Mosby]] (voiced by [[Bob Saget]]) sits his daughter and son down to tell them the story of how he met their mother.\n\nThe series begins in September 2005 with Ted ([[Josh Radnor]]) as a single, 27-year-old architect living with his two best friends from his college years: Marshall Eriksen ([[Jason Segel]]), a law student, and [[Lily Aldrin]] ([[Alyson Hannigan]]), a [[kindergarten]] teacher and an aspiring artist. Lily and Marshall have been dating for almost nine years when Marshall finally proposes. Their engagement causes Ted to think about marriage and finding his soul mate, much to the disgust of his self-appointed best friend [[Barney Stinson]] ([[Neil Patrick Harris]]), whom he met in the restroom at a bar four years earlier. Barney is a serial [[womanizing|womanizer]] who concocts elaborate con games, usually involving costumes and fake identities, designed to bed women, only to lose interest in them immediately afterward.\n\nTed begins his search for his perfect soul mate and meets an ambitious young reporter from Canada, [[Robin Scherbatsky]] ([[Cobie Smulders]]), with whom he quickly falls in love. Robin, however, does not want to rush into a relationship and the two decide to be friends. Future Ted reveals that Robin is not the mother after referring to her as \"[[Fictive kinship|Aunt]] Robin\".\n\nTed begins dating a baker, Victoria ([[Ashley Williams (actress)|Ashley Williams]]), whom he meets at [[Claudia and Stuart Bowers|Stuart and Claudia]]'s wedding, causing Robin to become jealous, and realize she does have feelings for Ted. Victoria is offered a fellowship in pastry-making, moves to Germany and she and Ted try a [[long-distance relationship]]. Once Ted learns Robin has feelings for him, he tells her he broke up with Victoria, even though he has not. They almost have sex when Victoria calls and Robin answers, mistaking Ted's phone for her own. Ted and Victoria then break up and an angry Robin distances herself from Ted, but they eventually reconcile and decide to date.\n\nMeanwhile, Lily begins to wonder if she has missed any opportunities because of her relationship with Marshall, and decides to pursue an art fellowship in [[San Francisco]], breaking up with Marshall in the process. The season ends with Ted returning to the apartment, the morning after spending the night with Robin for the first time, to find Marshall sitting in the rain with Lily's engagement ring, devastated by their sudden break-up after nine years. Marshall must then call off their wedding.\n\n===Season 2===\n{{Main|How I Met Your Mother (season 2)}}\nTed and Robin are now a couple; meanwhile, a heartbroken Marshall tries to continue his life without Lily. After enduring numerous emotional breakdowns, Marshall's friends step in, and Barney, using sly catchphrases and pick-up lines, tries to get Marshall back in the dating game. Marshall becomes Barney's new \u2018wingman\u2019 as Ted is now in a relationship with Robin. Barney mentors Marshall in the art of flirting with women. Marshall fails at impressing women, but he finally obtains a barista's number. Later, Lily, after finally realizing she is not meant to be an artist, returns to New York. They remain separated as Marshall begins to date another girl, described by the gang as having 'crazy eyes'. The date with the girl does not end well and eventually leads to Lily and Marshall becoming reunited, and their engagement eventually resumes. When Robin refuses to go to the mall or explain why, Marshall suspects she is married, and Barney suspects she has performed in adult films. They bet on it, appointing Lily as \"Slap Bet Commissioner.\" Lily oversees the search for the truth, as they discover that Robin was a teenage pop star named \"Robin Sparkles\", and Marshall eventually earns the right to slap Barney five times whenever he wishes. He uses one slap immediately and another later in the season. It is revealed that Barney has a [[homosexual|gay]] [[African American]] half-brother named James ([[Wayne Brady]]) and, unaware that his mother lied to him, believes that [[Bob Barker]] is his father. As a result of this he takes a trip to California to be a contestant on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' to meet his \"father\". While on the show, Barney wins all the prizes and gives them to Lily and Marshall as a 'happy early wedding' present.\n\nIn the season finale, Ted reveals to Barney that he and Robin have been broken up for some time due to their conflicting views on marriage and children. They did not tell anyone, in order to avoid taking attention away from Lily and Marshall's wedding. The season ends with Barney's excitement by the prospect of being an unfettered single man with Ted again. Barney's final words are \"this is going to be legen- wait for it...\".\n\n===Season 3===\n{{Main|How I Met Your Mother (season 3)}}\nBarney begins the season with the word, \"-dary!\" Robin returns from a trip to [[Argentina]] with her new boyfriend, Gael ([[Enrique Iglesias]]), and Ted must adjust to life as just her friend, while watching Robin and Gael fawning over each other. Marshall and Lily decide to move out on their own, falling in love with a place they cannot afford. Marshall is fighting his temptation to take a corporate job with high pay and focusing instead to follow his dream of becoming an environmental lawyer to protect the world from pollution. Robin learns of Lily's bad credit rating due to her compulsive shopping for designer brands, and forces Lily to tell Marshall. Despite this, they are able to finally secure their dream apartment, in Dowisetrepla, only to discover it is in a bad location (DOwnWInd of the SEwage TREatment PLAnt) and more poorly constructed than they thought (the floor is tilted). Barney is slapped for the third time on [[Thanksgiving]], which Marshall dubs \"[[Slapsgiving]].\"\n\nTed tells his children he met their mother through a story concerning her yellow umbrella. He finds the umbrella at a club and takes it home after attending a [[St. Patrick's Day]] party where his future wife was, although they did not meet. Ted attempts to woo Stella ([[Sarah Chalke]]), a dermatologist he sees to remove an embarrassing butterfly [[Lower-back tattoo|tattoo]]. This culminates in a memorable \"two-minute date,\" which incorporates small talk, dinner, a movie, coffee, two cab rides, and a goodnight kiss, all within two minutes. Robin sleeps with Barney after he comforts her following a break-up with a past Canadian love; Ted is infuriated, and decides to stop being friends with Barney. Meanwhile, an unknown woman begins to sabotage Barney's attempts to [[wikt:hook up|hook up]]. His [[saboteur]] is revealed to be Abby ([[Britney Spears]]), Stella's receptionist, with a vendetta against him for not calling her after they had sex.\n\nIn the season finale, Ted gets into a car accident and ends up in hospital after breaking up with Stella. Subsequently, Barney is hit by a bus while he is on his way to visit Ted and receives treatment in the same hospital. Ted realizes Barney really cares about him and they renew their friendship. Barney's true feelings for Robin are revealed while Ted proposes to Stella in an arcade with a toy kangaroo.\n\n===Season 4===\n{{Main|How I Met Your Mother (season 4)}}\n\nStella says yes to Ted's proposal. Robin takes a new job in [[Japan]], but quickly resigns and returns to New York to attend Ted's wedding, after realizing how much she misses her friends. Stella leaves Ted at the altar to get back together with Tony ([[Jason Jones (actor)|Jason Jones]]), the father of her daughter. Barney struggles with his feelings for Robin as his company shifts him to the management team of a new acquisition, Goliath National Bank (GNB), where Marshall has accepted a position.\n\nMarshall and Lily move to their new apartment and debate over whether or not they are ready to have children. Robin is threatened to be deported for not having a job in her field, which opens an opportunity for Barney to spend time with Robin. Robin becomes roommates with Ted and gets a job as an anchor for a 4 AM news show after Barney submits her video resume. Ted and Robin decide to sleep together constantly so they will not fight over each other's bad co-living habits. Barney attempts to make them stop fighting to prevent this, revealing to Ted his love for Robin.\n\nTed finds out Lily has sabotaged all of his relationships with anyone she does not approve of and indirectly may have inspired his breakup with Robin. Robin and Ted end up talking about it, causing their friendship to begin moving toward a positive note. After Barney finally sleeps with his 200th woman (and rubs it in the face of the childhood bully who taunted him into pursuing it), he begins to question the purpose of the remainder of his life, leaving him more certain of his feelings for Robin. Ted starts his own architectural design company, Mosbius Designs, after getting laid off. He is too afraid of failing so refuses to call clients. Barney finds him a job to design the new Goliath National Bank headquarters. When the company suspends the project, Marshall and Barney try to hide this fact from Ted.\n\nTed, while carrying the yellow umbrella, bumps into Stella and Tony. Tony later decides to visit him, sympathizing with Ted over his loss of Stella. He offers him a job as a professor of architecture, which Ted initially turns down.\n\nIn the season finale Robin finds out that Barney loves her, and initially refuses to commit to anything but a sex-only relationship; they seemingly end up together anyway. Ted decides that being an architect is leading nowhere, and finally decides instead to become a college professor. The finale ends with Ted preparing to teach his first class and Future Ted revealing to his children that one of the women in the class is their mother.\n\n===Season 5===\n{{Main|How I Met Your Mother (season 5)}}\nTed begins his job as a professor of architecture, standing in the middle of a classroom&nbsp;\u2013 although the mother was present, it turns out to be an economics class as he's in the wrong lecture hall. Barney and Robin have had a sexual relationship throughout the summer and Lily locks them in a room, forcing them to come to terms with their relationship. After a rough patch they decide to break up. Robin describes it instead as \"two friends getting back together.\" Barney immediately goes back to his old ways, using [[The Playbook (How I Met Your Mother)|the playbook]] to score with women. Throughout the season Barney and Robin show feelings of regret over their break-up.\n\nTed dates a graduate student named Cindy ([[Rachel Bilson]]) and it is revealed her roommate is his future wife. Robin meets Don Frank ([[Benjamin Koldyke]]), her new co-anchor on her 4 AM TV show. Though she initially dislikes him, the two start dating and eventually she moves in with him. At the end of the season they break up when Don takes a job in [[Chicago]] \u2014 a job which Robin had previously turned down to stay in New York with Don. Robin moves back into Ted's apartment. Lily's father, Mickey ([[Chris Elliott]]), who was absent during her childhood, makes an appearance at Thanksgiving. Mickey and Lily are able to mend their relationship at the end of the meal, where Marshall uses his fourth slap on Barney. Ted discovered that Tony, who stole Stella away from Ted at the altar, wrote a movie on Ted and Stella's relationship. The movie, \u201cThe Wedding Bride,\u201d portrays Tony as the hero and Ted as the villain. The movie becomes popular and Ted unexpectedly sees it while on a date with another girl. He is infuriated by how he is portrayed in the movie, and views the actual story as the complete opposite. Ted [[Home Wreckers|buys a house]], which needs to be fixed up badly, but is later revealed to be the future home for him and his children.\n\nLily and Marshall are still unsure about having children. After watching four [[Doppelg\u00e4nger|doppelgangers]] of their group ([[Lesbian]] Robin, [[Moustache]] Marshall, [[Stripper]] Lily and [[Luchador|Mexican Wrestler]] Ted) they decide to leave the big decision to the universe's \"infinite wisdom\" and start trying when they have seen Barney's doppelganger.\n\nIn the season finale, Barney disguises himself to have sex with a girl from every country in the world, and Lily and Marshall mistake him for the final doppelganger. When Marshall finds out, he decides not to tell Lily, fearing she will want to wait even longer to have children. Lily eventually finds out and decides to wait. In the season finale, Lily thinks she sees Barney's doppelganger as a hot dog vendor, which causes the group to realize she is seeing what she wants to see, and play along. Eventually Barney agrees having babies is not a stupid idea and Lily and Marshall should go forth. The season ends with Lily asking Marshall to \"put a baby in my belly\".\n\n===Season 6===\n{{Main|How I Met Your Mother (season 6)}}\nIn the season opening, Ted sees Cindy again with a girl who he thinks to be her roommate, but she turns out to be Cindy's girlfriend whom she later marries. After prodding by Barney, Ted is eventually hired by GNB once more as the architect of the bank's new headquarters, which was originally scrapped in Season 4. However, he encounters opposition when he meets Zoey Pierson ([[Jennifer Morrison]]), a woman who is protesting against GNB for selecting a decrepit hotel, the Arcadian, to be torn down for the headquarters. Over the season, Ted's encounters with Zoey eventually blossom into a relationship after she divorces her rich husband, the Captain ([[Kyle MacLachlan]]), but they break up as he puts his career and friends over love, leading to the Arcadian's demolition. Ted also resolves not to get back with Zoey.\n\nHaving agreed to conceive a baby at the end of the previous season, Lily and Marshall keep having sex, hoping she will get pregnant. Around Christmas, they have a false alarm and later seek fertility testing. The fertility specialist, Dr. Stangel, turns out to be Barney's doppelg\u00e4nger, fulfilling their promise with the universe in regard to their decision to have a child. However, tragedy strikes when Marshall's father passes away, leaving him devastated and the gang comforting him. Marshall tries to get over his father's death and live again. Despite a pledge to Lily to work harder for their future, Marshall resigns from GNB and follows his dream of being an environmental lawyer. Zoey also hires him as her lawyer in what became a futile battle to save the Arcadian. At the end of the season, Lily reveals that she is pregnant.\n\nBarney finally admits to the gang that Bob Barker is not his real father, especially when his mother decides to sell the house he grew up in and his brother, James, meets his own father. Loretta offers the identity of Barney's father on a sheet of paper, but Barney tears this up after realizing her efforts as a single mother. At the funeral of Marshall's father, Barney tells Loretta that he wants to see his father at last. The man, Jerry Whittaker ([[John Lithgow]]), is eventually revealed to be someone whom Barney thought was his uncle. Barney, who remembers Jerry as a fun-loving man, is disappointed after learning how Jerry has grown out of his free-wheeling ways. Although he tries to bring back Jerry's old behaviors, Barney admits that he wants to settle down someday. He is also introduced to Nora ([[Nazanin Boniadi]]), a co-worker of Robin, for whom he develops feelings. After an initial falling out, the two reconcile at the end of the season after Barney asks her for coffee.\n\nRobin continues to work at her talk show, ''Come On, Get Up, New York!'', but the presence of a new hyperactive co-host forces her to leave. She is accepted as a researcher in another network, ''World Wide News''. The gang also discovers more of her past as the Canadian pop star Robin Sparkles. Robin also encounters a man ([[Michael Trucco]]) she has had a secret crush on since first seeing him when she and Ted were dating, and Future Ted hints that they will see more of him later.\n\nIn the season finale, Ted makes the decision that he wants to get back with Zoey. Robin and Barney try to stop them from getting back together. Marshall's interview goes wrong as food poisoning hits him during the meeting. Barney and Robin get closure by helping Ted not get back together with Zoey. Short scenes during the season premiere and finale feature a wedding set sometime in the future, where Ted will meet his future wife. In the final scene of the season, the groom is revealed to be Barney.\n\n===Season 7===\n{{Main|How I Met Your Mother (season 7)}}\nSeason seven opens with another flash forward, in which Ted is helping Barney get ready for his wedding to a still-unknown bride. In the present, Marshall gets a job in environmental law while Lily's pregnancy progresses. Barney proves to Nora that he can be a good boyfriend to her, while Robin is revealed to still have feelings for Barney. After a court case for assault, Robin receives mandated therapy. Robin meets a therapist Kevin ([[Kal Penn]]) and they start to date. Meanwhile, after a period of unemployment since leaving GNB, Marshall finally manages to land his dream job at a top environmental law firm. After losing a bet, Barney is forced to wear a tie with a duck pattern on it (nicknamed the 'Ducky Tie') which he hates. Marshall allows him to take it off when meeting Nora's parents on the condition that Barney has three slaps added to the one still remaining from the Slap Bet. Marshall uses two slaps immediately, leaving two left.\n\nWhile reminiscing about [[Hurricane Irene (2011)|Hurricane Irene]], Lily and Marshall reveal that they conceived their baby in Barney's apartment, and Barney and Robin end up sleeping together. Barney and Robin decide to break up with their partners, but Robin reneges on the deal, returning to Kevin and leaving Barney alone and heartbroken. Robin has a pregnancy scare at Thanksgiving and tells Barney the child is his, since she and Kevin had not yet slept together. However, Robin's doctor informs her that she cannot have children at all. Kevin, who wants children, proposes to Robin, who decides that they must break up. Ted comforts Robin and reveals he still loves her, but the gesture is unrequited. Eventually, she moves out to give him some space.\n\nMarshall and Lily decide they want to move to Long Island, after Lily's paternal grandparents offer them their house there. Eventually, they move back to the old apartment in New York City after realizing suburban life is not for them. Ted gives them his apartment because he believes he cannot move on from Robin while living there, while he and Robin become estranged and do not speak for several weeks. Robin is eventually offered a news anchor job and subsequently achieves recognition after preventing a helicopter she is flying in from crashing.\n\nBarney starts dating a stripper named Quinn, to the group's initial apprehension. The gang begins to meddle in their relationship, but Barney and Quinn outsmart their attempts and win their approval. Quinn moves in with Barney, while Ted buys Quinn's old apartment. Lily goes into labor and frantically calls Barney and Marshall, who are out at a casino. After many attempts to escape, Barney helps Marshall arrive in time for Lily's delivery and chooses the middle name for the baby, Marvin Waitforit Eriksen.

Barney proposes to Quinn performing an extravagant magic trick in airport security. Ted contacts his old girlfriend Victoria; unhappy with her own impending wedding, she leaves her fianc\u00e9 for Ted and the pair drive off into the sunset. A final flash forward shows the day of Barney's wedding, where Robin is revealed as the bride.\n\n===Season 8===\n{{main|How I Met Your Mother (season 8)}}\nTed visits Robin on the day of her wedding to Barney, causing him to remember how he and Victoria ran away from her wedding to be together. The summer is spent with Ted, Barney, and Robin enjoying their current relationships; however, all subsequently break up with their partners.

Victoria splits up with Ted over his friendship with Robin, Barney and Quinn break up due to their inability to trust each other, and Robin breaks up with Nick realizing his immaturity. Robin and Barney kiss but decide not to get together, despite Barney's wishes. Barney then begins dating Robin's hated co-worker Patrice ([[Ellen D. Williams]]), a relationship later exposed as a ruse to make Robin realize her true feelings for him. In a culminating scene Barney proposes to Robin, who says yes.\n\nMarshall and Lily attempt to get used to being parents, which causes a brief estrangement from the gang as Baby Marvin takes up the majority of their time. Lily's father Mickey becomes Marvin's nanny, freeing the two up to spend more time with their friends. The Captain, ex-husband of Ted's old girlfriend Zoey, offers Lily a job as an art consultant after she identifies a painting that made a huge profit for him. Lily accepts, happy to finally achieve her dream of having a job in the art industry, while Marshall decides to apply to become a judge. The Captain offers Lily a year's work in Rome, which she accepts with Marshall's blessing. However, just before Barney and Robin's wedding, Marshall is informed that his application to become a judge has been granted, a development that would require them to stay in the US.\n\nTed briefly dates Jeanette ([[Abby Elliott]]), a girl who stalked him after he appeared on the cover of ''New York Magazine'' for designing GNB headquarters. He quickly realizes he's made a mistake and breaks up with her. Ted's feelings of loneliness grow, especially as he is now the only single member of the group, and he decides he is truly ready to settle down. He argues with Lily over hiring a DJ or a band for Barney and Robin's wedding, but is forced to provide a band at short notice when Lily concedes the argument. During a chance meeting on the subway, Cindy offers the services of her roommate's wedding band. This roommate is Ted's future wife.\n\nAs the week of the wedding approaches, Robin has doubts about marrying Barney and shares an emotional moment with Ted.

The season concludes with everyone traveling to Barney and Robin's wedding, including the mother of Ted's children (revealed on screen for the first time and portrayed by [[Cristin Milioti]]), who is seen buying a train ticket to the venue and holding her yellow umbrella.\n\n===Season 9===\n{{main|How I Met Your Mother (season 9)}}\nWith the exception of the very last episode, the entirety of season nine takes place in the 56 hours leading up to Barney and Robin's wedding.\n\nMarshall, who is stuck in Minnesota, desperately tries to find a way to get to the wedding in time. Meanwhile, in Farhampton, the time is slowly counting down to the wedding, with a new problem arising in almost every episode. It is revealed that Lily is pregnant and that she and Marshall will have a daughter. It is also revealed that Ted's children are named Penny and Luke. In the 200th episode, the Mother's eight years before meeting Ted are revealed, while later episodes give viewers a glimpse of Ted and the Mother together in flash forward scenes. Also, Marshall uses his final two slaps from the slap bet: the first being used as an apology present for missing the rehearsal dinner, and the second when Barney begins to panic just before the beginning of the wedding ceremony.\n\nIn the series finale, it is revealed that after three years of marriage, Barney and Robin decided to divorce. Barney ends up fathering a child during a one-night stand. Marshall eventually becomes a judge, and he and Lily have three children. Ted's wife, whose name is revealed to be Tracy, dies of an unknown illness in 2024, six years prior to the time of Ted telling his children the full story of how they met. Upon finishing the story, at the urging of his kids, Ted decides to ask Robin out. Alluding to the first episode (pilot), the finale ends with Robin looking out her apartment window to see Ted on the street holding the blue French horn.\n\nFollowing backlash from fans over the ending of the series, an alternate ending was cut together and released on the Season 9 DVD, in which future Ted narrates over the scene in which Ted and Tracy meet at the train station, recapping all major events from the series. He delivers the final line \"and that kids is how I met your mother\", and the episode ends, completely cutting the final scene with Penny and Luke.\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe first season was met with generally favorable reviews from critics, although some compared the series unfavorably to ''[[Friends]]''.

Michelle Zoromski of [[IGN]] gave Season 4 an overall rating of 8.5 out of 10, stating that \"This fourth season seemed to settle down the chase for the titular mother. While Ted was busy dating Stella, the gang settled into many stand alone episodes which were every bit as entertaining as episodes devoted to Ted's love life\".

In 2010, [[Alyson Hannigan]] won the [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for Favorite TV Comedy Actress. In 2012, seven years after its premiere, the series won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Network TV Comedy, and Neil Patrick Harris won the award for Favorite TV Comedy Actor.\n\n==Premise==\nThe series follows the adventures of [[Ted Mosby]] (played by [[Josh Radnor]]), who narrates the story of how he met the mother of his children. The story goes into a flashback and starts in 2005 with the 27-year-old Ted Mosby living in New York City and working as an architect. The narrative deals primarily with his best friends, including the long-lasting couple [[Marshall Eriksen]] ([[Jason Segel]]) and [[Lily Aldrin]] ([[Alyson Hannigan]]), [[womanizing]] playboy [[Barney Stinson]] ([[Neil Patrick Harris]]), and Canadian news reporter [[Robin Scherbatsky]] ([[Cobie Smulders]]); all of the characters' lives are entwined. The series explores many storylines, including a \"will they or won't they\" relationship between Robin and each of the two single male friends, Marshall and Lily's relationship, and the ups and downs of the characters' careers.\n\nThe show's [[frame story]] depicts Ted (voice of [[Bob Saget]], uncredited) verbally retelling the story to his son Luke ([[David Henrie]]) and daughter Penny ([[Lyndsy Fonseca]]) as they sit on the couch in the year 2030. This future-set frame is officially the show's \"present day\", and ''How I Met Your Mother'' exploits this framing device in numerous ways: to depict and re-depict events from multiple points of view; to set up jokes using quick and sometimes multiple [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] nested within the oral retelling; to substitute visual, verbal, or aural euphemisms for activities Ted does not want to talk about with his children (sexual practices, use of illicit substances, vulgar language, etc.); and even to add some elements of humor: in the episode \"[[How I Met Everyone Else]]\", Ted describes his dates with a girlfriend whose name he has forgotten, leading all characters to act as though her given name were \"Blah-Blah\"; later in the series, Ted remembers her name is Carol.\n\nWhile the traditional love story structure begins when the romantic leads first encounter each other, ''How I Met Your Mother'' does not introduce Ted's wife ([[Cristin Milioti]]) until the eighth-season finale and only announces her name ([[List of How I Met Your Mother characters#The Mother (Tracy McConnell)|Tracy McConnell]]) during the series finale. The show instead focuses on Ted's prior relationships and his dissatisfaction with those women, thus setting the stage for his eventual happiness with Tracy. Finally in present 2030, six years after Tracy's death, Ted gets back with Robin, which viewers may have assumed at the series finale when Ted is standing outside Robin's window.

He is the main protagonist since he tells the story of his adult years from his late twenties to his early thirties and about all the obstacles he has to overcome before he meets \"The One\" aka the Mother. This story is told by the Older Ted Mosby, and narrator of the series, [[Bob Saget]]. Ted moved to [[New York City]] with his friends Marshall and Lily after graduating from [[Wesleyan University]]. In New York, he met Barney at the urinal of MacLaren's and Robin, to whom he was immediately attracted. Ted is on a quest for happiness and \"The One\", the woman he will marry. Ted experiences many relationships, one of them being Robin, that reveal the qualities he wants in his future wife. At the end of each relationship Ted, with levity, reflects upon what went wrong. Although hope to find \u201cthe one\u201d diminishes with each failed relationship, Ted does not give up. Ted prefers more elegant and high-class interests than his friends have. He goes to great lengths to profess his love to the women in his life, but they all falter eventually. Despite these qualities, Ted often acts immaturely, such as partaking in wild activities with Barney. In the show's finale, he says, that, in Tracy, he had met the love of his life (the titular Mother), but only after he was finished telling the story he realized that Robin was the love of his life.\n* [[Jason Segel]] as [[Marshall Eriksen]], Ted Mosby's best friend. Marshall and Ted are assigned to be roommates at Wesleyan University, and remained living together when they move to New York City. In season 2 Marshall marries Lily, with whom he has been in love since his freshman year of college; they have a child during season 7. Marshall was born in [[St. Cloud, Minnesota]], where his family and culture are the foundation to major conflicts he faces in the series. He has an interest in the paranormal phenomenon, and mythical creatures, particularly [[Sasquatch]]. His dream to be an environmental lawyer, conflicts with his immediate need for money, such as for his wedding and to raise his children.\n* [[Cobie Smulders]] as [[Robin Scherbatsky]], a news anchor who is trying to make it as a journalist and dates both Ted and Barney. Robin emigrated from Canada to take a job in a news station and met Ted at MacLaren's; her Canadian background is a source of many jokes from her friends, for instance, \u2018Robin Sparkles\u2019. She is shown to be very career-centric and rejects traditional roles, such as getting married and having kids. Robin often drinks scotch and smokes cigars, and she is an avid gun fan. She and Barney get engaged and later marry in the first part of the series finale, but divorce in the second part, three years later. Smulders' husband [[Taran Killam]] appeared in six episodes as Gary Blauman. \n* [[Neil Patrick Harris]] as [[Barney Stinson]] is a serial playboy, using his relative wealth and an array of outrageous strategies to seduce women with no intention of engaging in a relationship. His catchphrases include 'Suit Up' and 'Legend-wait-for-it-Dary'. He is Ted's other best friend. Abandoned by his father at a young age, Barney has [[Abandonment (emotional)|abandonment issues]] and clings to his friends. Barney tells his friends extravagant lies about events in his life as a defence mechanism for his substandard childhood. He marries Robin in the series finale but they divorce after three years. In 2020, a failed one-night stand gives him a daughter, Ellie. Harris' husband [[David Burtka]] has appeared in seven episodes as Scooter. \n* [[Alyson Hannigan]] as [[Lily Aldrin]], a kindergarten teacher, an aspiring artist, and Marshall's wife. She is terrible at keeping secrets and can be manipulative at times. She marries Marshall in season 2 and gives birth to Marvin in season 7. Though appearing sweet and cute, Lily can be quite unexpectedly fierce. Lily Aldrin's best girl friend is Robin Scherbatsky, who she met through Ted as he dated Robin. Hannigan's husband [[Alexis Denisof]] appeared in ten episodes as Sandy Rivers. \n* [[Cristin Milioti]] as [[Tracy McConnell]] ({{small|guest - season 8; main - season 9}}),<ref name=TVLine20130517/> (although only appearing occasionally, 28 episodes out of 208, she plays an integral part in the show in the build-up to the finale) the future wife of Ted Mosby, The Mother. Tracy McConnell is first seen in the finale of season 8, though her name is hinted at in season 1 (01x09 \"Belly full of Turkey\") and officially revealed in the series finale. Ted falls madly in love with her, but in 2024 she passes away.\n* [[Bob Saget]] as Future Ted Mosby ({{small|voice only, uncredited}}) in the year 2030 telling his children the story of how he met their mother.\n\n==Season synopsis==\n{{Main|List of How I Met Your Mother episodes}}\n{{:List of How I Met Your Mother episodes}}\n{{Anchor|Plot}}\n\n===Season 1===\n{{Main|How I Met Your Mother (season 1)}}\nIn the year 2030, [[Ted Mosby]] (voiced by [[Bob Saget]]) sits his daughter and son down to tell them the story of how he met their mother.\n\nThe series begins in September 2005 with Ted ([[Josh Radnor]]) as a single, 27-year-old architect living with his two best friends from his college years: Marshall Eriksen ([[Jason Segel]]), a law student, and [[Lily Aldrin]] ([[Alyson Hannigan]]), a [[kindergarten]] teacher and an aspiring artist. Lily and Marshall have been dating for almost nine years when Marshall finally proposes. Their engagement causes Ted to think about marriage and finding his soul mate, much to the disgust of his self-appointed best friend [[Barney Stinson]] ([[Neil Patrick Harris]]), whom he met in the restroom at a bar four years earlier. Barney is a serial [[womanizing|womanizer]] who concocts elaborate con games, usually involving costumes and fake identities, designed to bed women, only to lose interest in them immediately afterward.\n\nTed begins his search for his perfect soul mate and meets an ambitious young reporter from Canada, [[Robin Scherbatsky]] ([[Cobie Smulders]]), with whom he quickly falls in love. Robin, however, does not want to rush into a relationship and the two decide to be friends. Future Ted reveals that Robin is not the mother after referring to her as \"[[Fictive kinship|Aunt]] Robin\".\n\nTed begins dating a baker, Victoria ([[Ashley Williams (actress)|Ashley Williams]]), whom he meets at [[Claudia and Stuart Bowers|Stuart and Claudia]]'s wedding, causing Robin to become jealous, and realize she does have feelings for Ted. Victoria is offered a fellowship in pastry-making, moves to Germany and she and Ted try a [[long-distance relationship]]. Once Ted learns Robin has feelings for him, he tells her he broke up with Victoria, even though he has not. They almost have sex when Victoria calls and Robin answers, mistaking Ted's phone for her own. Ted and Victoria then break up and an angry Robin distances herself from Ted, but they eventually reconcile and decide to date.\n\nMeanwhile, Lily begins to wonder if she has missed any opportunities because of her relationship with Marshall, and decides to pursue an art fellowship in [[San Francisco]], breaking up with Marshall in the process. The season ends with Ted returning to the apartment, the morning after spending the night with Robin for the first time, to find Marshall sitting in the rain with Lily's engagement ring, devastated by their sudden break-up after nine years. Marshall must then call off their wedding.\n\n===Season 2===\n{{Main|How I Met Your Mother (season 2)}}\nTed and Robin are now a couple; meanwhile, a heartbroken Marshall tries to continue his life without Lily. After enduring numerous emotional breakdowns, Marshall's friends step in, and Barney, using sly catchphrases and pick-up lines, tries to get Marshall back in the dating game. Marshall becomes Barney's new \u2018wingman\u2019 as Ted is now in a relationship with Robin. Barney mentors Marshall in the art of flirting with women. Marshall fails at impressing women, but he finally obtains a barista's number. Later, Lily, after finally realizing she is not meant to be an artist, returns to New York. They remain separated as Marshall begins to date another girl, described by the gang as having 'crazy eyes'. The date with the girl does not end well and eventually leads to Lily and Marshall becoming reunited, and their engagement eventually resumes. When Robin refuses to go to the mall or explain why, Marshall suspects she is married, and Barney suspects she has performed in adult films. They bet on it, appointing Lily as \"Slap Bet Commissioner.\" Lily oversees the search for the truth, as they discover that Robin was a teenage pop star named \"Robin Sparkles\", and Marshall eventually earns the right to slap Barney five times whenever he wishes. He uses one slap immediately and another later in the season. It is revealed that Barney has a [[homosexual|gay]] [[African American]] half-brother named James ([[Wayne Brady]]) and, unaware that his mother lied to him, believes that [[Bob Barker]] is his father. As a result of this he takes a trip to California to be a contestant on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' to meet his \"father\". While on the show, Barney wins all the prizes and gives them to Lily and Marshall as a 'happy early wedding' present.\n\nIn the season finale, Ted reveals to Barney that he and Robin have been broken up for some time due to their conflicting views on marriage and children. They did not tell anyone, in order to avoid taking attention away from Lily and Marshall's wedding. The season ends with Barney's excitement by the prospect of being an unfettered single man with Ted again. Barney's final words are \"this is going to be legen- wait for it...\".\n\n===Season 3===\n{{Main|How I Met Your Mother (season 3)}}\nBarney begins the season with the word, \"-dary!\" Robin returns from a trip to [[Argentina]] with her new boyfriend, Gael ([[Enrique Iglesias]]), and Ted must adjust to life as just her friend, while watching Robin and Gael fawning over each other. Marshall and Lily decide to move out on their own, falling in love with a place they cannot afford. Marshall is fighting his temptation to take a corporate job with high pay and focusing instead to follow his dream of becoming an environmental lawyer to protect the world from pollution. Robin learns of Lily's bad credit rating due to her compulsive shopping for designer brands, and forces Lily to tell Marshall. Despite this, they are able to finally secure their dream apartment, in Dowisetrepla, only to discover it is in a bad location (DOwnWInd of the SEwage TREatment PLAnt) and more poorly constructed than they thought (the floor is tilted). Barney is slapped for the third time on [[Thanksgiving]], which Marshall dubs \"[[Slapsgiving]].\"\n\nTed tells his children he met their mother through a story concerning her yellow umbrella. He finds the umbrella at a club and takes it home after attending a [[St. Patrick's Day]] party where his future wife was, although they did not meet. Ted attempts to woo Stella ([[Sarah Chalke]]), a dermatologist he sees to remove an embarrassing butterfly [[Lower-back tattoo|tattoo]]. This culminates in a memorable \"two-minute date,\" which incorporates small talk, dinner, a movie, coffee, two cab rides, and a goodnight kiss, all within two minutes. Robin sleeps with Barney after he comforts her following a break-up with a past Canadian love; Ted is infuriated, and decides to stop being friends with Barney. Meanwhile, an unknown woman begins to sabotage Barney's attempts to [[wikt:hook up|hook up]]. His [[saboteur]] is revealed to be Abby ([[Britney Spears]]), Stella's receptionist, with a vendetta against him for not calling her after they had sex.\n\nIn the season finale, Ted gets into a car accident and ends up in hospital after breaking up with Stella. Subsequently, Barney is hit by a bus while he is on his way to visit Ted and receives treatment in the same hospital. Ted realizes Barney really cares about him and they renew their friendship. Barney's true feelings for Robin are revealed while Ted proposes to Stella in an arcade with a toy kangaroo.\n\n===Season 4===\n{{Main|How I Met Your Mother (season 4)}}\n\nStella says yes to Ted's proposal. Robin takes a new job in [[Japan]], but quickly resigns and returns to New York to attend Ted's wedding, after realizing how much she misses her friends. Stella leaves Ted at the altar to get back together with Tony ([[Jason Jones (actor)|Jason Jones]]), the father of her daughter. Barney struggles with his feelings for Robin as his company shifts him to the management team of a new acquisition, Goliath National Bank (GNB), where Marshall has accepted a position.\n\nMarshall and Lily move to their new apartment and debate over whether or not they are ready to have children. Robin is threatened to be deported for not having a job in her field, which opens an opportunity for Barney to spend time with Robin. Robin becomes roommates with Ted and gets a job as an anchor for a 4 AM news show after Barney submits her video resume. Ted and Robin decide to sleep together constantly so they will not fight over each other's bad co-living habits. Barney attempts to make them stop fighting to prevent this, revealing to Ted his love for Robin.\n\nTed finds out Lily has sabotaged all of his relationships with anyone she does not approve of and indirectly may have inspired his breakup with Robin. Robin and Ted end up talking about it, causing their friendship to begin moving toward a positive note. After Barney finally sleeps with his 200th woman (and rubs it in the face of the childhood bully who taunted him into pursuing it), he begins to question the purpose of the remainder of his life, leaving him more certain of his feelings for Robin. Ted starts his own architectural design company, Mosbius Designs, after getting laid off. He is too afraid of failing so refuses to call clients. Barney finds him a job to design the new Goliath National Bank headquarters. When the company suspends the project, Marshall and Barney try to hide this fact from Ted.\n\nTed, while carrying the yellow umbrella, bumps into Stella and Tony. Tony later decides to visit him, sympathizing with Ted over his loss of Stella. He offers him a job as a professor of architecture, which Ted initially turns down.\n\nIn the season finale Robin finds out that Barney loves her, and initially refuses to commit to anything but a sex-only relationship; they seemingly end up together anyway. Ted decides that being an architect is leading nowhere, and finally decides instead to become a college professor. The finale ends with Ted preparing to teach his first class and Future Ted revealing to his children that one of the women in the class is their mother.\n\n===Season 5===\n{{Main|How I Met Your Mother (season 5)}}\nTed begins his job as a professor of architecture, standing in the middle of a classroom&nbsp;\u2013 although the mother was present, it turns out to be an economics class as he's in the wrong lecture hall. Barney and Robin have had a sexual relationship throughout the summer and Lily locks them in a room, forcing them to come to terms with their relationship. After a rough patch they decide to break up. Robin describes it instead as \"two friends getting back together.\" Barney immediately goes back to his old ways, using [[The Playbook (How I Met Your Mother)|the playbook]] to score with women. Throughout the season Barney and Robin show feelings of regret over their break-up.\n\nTed dates a graduate student named Cindy ([[Rachel Bilson]]) and it is revealed her roommate is his future wife. Robin meets Don Frank ([[Benjamin Koldyke]]), her new co-anchor on her 4 AM TV show. Though she initially dislikes him, the two start dating and eventually she moves in with him. At the end of the season they break up when Don takes a job in [[Chicago]] \u2014 a job which Robin had previously turned down to stay in New York with Don. Robin moves back into Ted's apartment. Lily's father, Mickey ([[Chris Elliott]]), who was absent during her childhood, makes an appearance at Thanksgiving. Mickey and Lily are able to mend their relationship at the end of the meal, where Marshall uses his fourth slap on Barney. Ted discovered that Tony, who stole Stella away from Ted at the altar, wrote a movie on Ted and Stella's relationship. The movie, \u201cThe Wedding Bride,\u201d portrays Tony as the hero and Ted as the villain. The movie becomes popular and Ted unexpectedly sees it while on a date with another girl. He is infuriated by how he is portrayed in the movie, and views the actual story as the complete opposite. Ted [[Home Wreckers|buys a house]], which needs to be fixed up badly, but is later revealed to be the future home for him and his children.\n\nLily and Marshall are still unsure about having children. After watching four [[Doppelg\u00e4nger|doppelgangers]] of their group ([[Lesbian]] Robin, [[Moustache]] Marshall, [[Stripper]] Lily and [[Luchador|Mexican Wrestler]] Ted) they decide to leave the big decision to the universe's \"infinite wisdom\" and start trying when they have seen Barney's doppelganger.\n\nIn the season finale, Barney disguises himself to have sex with a girl from every country in the world, and Lily and Marshall mistake him for the final doppelganger. When Marshall finds out, he decides not to tell Lily, fearing she will want to wait even longer to have children. Lily eventually finds out and decides to wait. In the season finale, Lily thinks she sees Barney's doppelganger as a hot dog vendor, which causes the group to realize she is seeing what she wants to see, and play along. Eventually Barney agrees having babies is not a stupid idea and Lily and Marshall should go forth. The season ends with Lily asking Marshall to \"put a baby in my belly\".\n\n===Season 6===\n{{Main|How I Met Your Mother (season 6)}}\nIn the season opening, Ted sees Cindy again with a girl who he thinks to be her roommate, but she turns out to be Cindy's girlfriend whom she later marries. After prodding by Barney, Ted is eventually hired by GNB once more as the architect of the bank's new headquarters, which was originally scrapped in Season 4. However, he encounters opposition when he meets Zoey Pierson ([[Jennifer Morrison]]), a woman who is protesting against GNB for selecting a decrepit hotel, the Arcadian, to be torn down for the headquarters. Over the season, Ted's encounters with Zoey eventually blossom into a relationship after she divorces her rich husband, the Captain ([[Kyle MacLachlan]]), but they break up as he puts his career and friends over love, leading to the Arcadian's demolition. Ted also resolves not to get back with Zoey.\n\nHaving agreed to conceive a baby at the end of the previous season, Lily and Marshall keep having sex, hoping she will get pregnant. Around Christmas, they have a false alarm and later seek fertility testing. The fertility specialist, Dr. Stangel, turns out to be Barney's doppelg\u00e4nger, fulfilling their promise with the universe in regard to their decision to have a child. However, tragedy strikes when Marshall's father passes away, leaving him devastated and the gang comforting him. Marshall tries to get over his father's death and live again. Despite a pledge to Lily to work harder for their future, Marshall resigns from GNB and follows his dream of being an environmental lawyer. Zoey also hires him as her lawyer in what became a futile battle to save the Arcadian. At the end of the season, Lily reveals that she is pregnant.\n\nBarney finally admits to the gang that Bob Barker is not his real father, especially when his mother decides to sell the house he grew up in and his brother, James, meets his own father. Loretta offers the identity of Barney's father on a sheet of paper, but Barney tears this up after realizing her efforts as a single mother. At the funeral of Marshall's father, Barney tells Loretta that he wants to see his father at last. The man, Jerry Whittaker ([[John Lithgow]]), is eventually revealed to be someone whom Barney thought was his uncle. Barney, who remembers Jerry as a fun-loving man, is disappointed after learning how Jerry has grown out of his free-wheeling ways. Although he tries to bring back Jerry's old behaviors, Barney admits that he wants to settle down someday. He is also introduced to Nora ([[Nazanin Boniadi]]), a co-worker of Robin, for whom he develops feelings. After an initial falling out, the two reconcile at the end of the season after Barney asks her for coffee.\n\nRobin continues to work at her talk show, ''Come On, Get Up, New York!'', but the presence of a new hyperactive co-host forces her to leave. She is accepted as a researcher in another network, ''World Wide News''. The gang also discovers more of her past as the Canadian pop star Robin Sparkles. Robin also encounters a man ([[Michael Trucco]]) she has had a secret crush on since first seeing him when she and Ted were dating, and Future Ted hints that they will see more of him later.\n\nIn the season finale, Ted makes the decision that he wants to get back with Zoey. Robin and Barney try to stop them from getting back together. Marshall's interview goes wrong as food poisoning hits him during the meeting. Barney and Robin get closure by helping Ted not get back together with Zoey. Short scenes during the season premiere and finale feature a wedding set sometime in the future, where Ted will meet his future wife. In the final scene of the season, the groom is revealed to be Barney.\n\n===Season 7===\n{{Main|How I Met Your Mother (season 7)}}\nSeason seven opens with another flash forward, in which Ted is helping Barney get ready for his wedding to a still-unknown bride. In the present, Marshall gets a job in environmental law while Lily's pregnancy progresses. Barney proves to Nora that he can be a good boyfriend to her, while Robin is revealed to still have feelings for Barney. After a court case for assault, Robin receives mandated therapy. Robin meets a therapist Kevin ([[Kal Penn]]) and they start to date. Meanwhile, after a period of unemployment since leaving GNB, Marshall finally manages to land his dream job at a top environmental law firm. After losing a bet, Barney is forced to wear a tie with a duck pattern on it (nicknamed the 'Ducky Tie') which he hates. Marshall allows him to take it off when meeting Nora's parents on the condition that Barney has three slaps added to the one still remaining from the Slap Bet. Marshall uses two slaps immediately, leaving two left.\n\nWhile reminiscing about [[Hurricane Irene (2011)|Hurricane Irene]], Lily and Marshall reveal that they conceived their baby in Barney's apartment, and Barney and Robin end up sleeping together. Barney and Robin decide to break up with their partners, but Robin reneges on the deal, returning to Kevin and leaving Barney alone and heartbroken. Robin has a pregnancy scare at Thanksgiving and tells Barney the child is his, since she and Kevin had not yet slept together. However, Robin's doctor informs her that she cannot have children at all. Kevin, who wants children, proposes to Robin, who decides that they must break up. Ted comforts Robin and reveals he still loves her, but the gesture is unrequited. Eventually, she moves out to give him some space.\n\nMarshall and Lily decide they want to move to Long Island, after Lily's paternal grandparents offer them their house there. Eventually, they move back to the old apartment in New York City after realizing suburban life is not for them. Ted gives them his apartment because he believes he cannot move on from Robin while living there, while he and Robin become estranged and do not speak for several weeks. Robin is eventually offered a news anchor job and subsequently achieves recognition after preventing a helicopter she is flying in from crashing.\n\nBarney starts dating a stripper named Quinn, to the group's initial apprehension. The gang begins to meddle in their relationship, but Barney and Quinn outsmart their attempts and win their approval. Quinn moves in with Barney, while Ted buys Quinn's old apartment. Lily goes into labor and frantically calls Barney and Marshall, who are out at a casino. After many attempts to escape, Barney helps Marshall arrive in time for Lily's delivery and chooses the middle name for the baby, Marvin Waitforit Eriksen. Ted and Robin's friendship also recovers as a result of Marvin's birth. As the season concludes, Marshall and Lily begin a new family with their baby, Marvin. Barney proposes to Quinn performing an extravagant magic trick in airport security. Ted contacts his old girlfriend Victoria; unhappy with her own impending wedding, she leaves her fianc\u00e9 for Ted and the pair drive off into the sunset. A final flash forward shows the day of Barney's wedding, where Robin is revealed as the bride.\n\n===Season 8===\n{{main|How I Met Your Mother (season 8)}}\nTed visits Robin on the day of her wedding to Barney, causing him to remember how he and Victoria ran away from her wedding to be together. The summer is spent with Ted, Barney, and Robin enjoying their current relationships; however, all subsequently break up with their partners. The breakups with all four couples happen in this season; future Ted (Bob Saget) refers to this period as the \u2018autumn of breakups\u2019. Victoria splits up with Ted over his friendship with Robin, Barney and Quinn break up due to their inability to trust each other, and Robin breaks up with Nick realizing his immaturity. Robin and Barney kiss but decide not to get together, despite Barney's wishes. Barney then begins dating Robin's hated co-worker Patrice ([[Ellen D. Williams]]), a relationship later exposed as a ruse to make Robin realize her true feelings for him. In a culminating scene Barney proposes to Robin, who says yes.\n\nMarshall and Lily attempt to get used to being parents, which causes a brief estrangement from the gang as Baby Marvin takes up the majority of their time. Lily's father Mickey becomes Marvin's nanny, freeing the two up to spend more time with their friends. The Captain, ex-husband of Ted's old girlfriend Zoey, offers Lily a job as an art consultant after she identifies a painting that made a huge profit for him. Lily accepts, happy to finally achieve her dream of having a job in the art industry, while Marshall decides to apply to become a judge. The Captain offers Lily a year's work in Rome, which she accepts with Marshall's blessing. However, just before Barney and Robin's wedding, Marshall is informed that his application to become a judge has been granted, a development that would require them to stay in the US.\n\nTed briefly dates Jeanette ([[Abby Elliott]]), a girl who stalked him after he appeared on the cover of ''New York Magazine'' for designing GNB headquarters. He quickly realizes he's made a mistake and breaks up with her. Ted's feelings of loneliness grow, especially as he is now the only single member of the group, and he decides he is truly ready to settle down. He argues with Lily over hiring a DJ or a band for Barney and Robin's wedding, but is forced to provide a band at short notice when Lily concedes the argument. During a chance meeting on the subway, Cindy offers the services of her roommate's wedding band. This roommate is Ted's future wife.\n\nAs the week of the wedding approaches, Robin has doubts about marrying Barney and shares an emotional moment with Ted. Guilty, Ted realizes he cannot be around Barney and Robin after they are married and decides to move to Chicago the day after the wedding. The season concludes with everyone traveling to Barney and Robin's wedding, including the mother of Ted's children (revealed on screen for the first time and portrayed by [[Cristin Milioti]]), who is seen buying a train ticket to the venue and holding her yellow umbrella.\n\n===Season 9===\n{{main|How I Met Your Mother (season 9)}}\nWith the exception of the very last episode, the entirety of season nine takes place in the 56 hours leading up to Barney and Robin's wedding.\n\nMarshall, who is stuck in Minnesota, desperately tries to find a way to get to the wedding in time. Meanwhile, in Farhampton, the time is slowly counting down to the wedding, with a new problem arising in almost every episode. It is revealed that Lily is pregnant and that she and Marshall will have a daughter. It is also revealed that Ted's children are named Penny and Luke. In the 200th episode, the Mother's eight years before meeting Ted are revealed, while later episodes give viewers a glimpse of Ted and the Mother together in flash forward scenes. Also, Marshall uses his final two slaps from the slap bet: the first being used as an apology present for missing the rehearsal dinner, and the second when Barney begins to panic just before the beginning of the wedding ceremony.\n\nIn the series finale, it is revealed that after three years of marriage, Barney and Robin decided to divorce. Barney ends up fathering a child during a one-night stand. Marshall eventually becomes a judge, and he and Lily have three children. Ted's wife, whose name is revealed to be Tracy, dies of an unknown illness in 2024, six years prior to the time of Ted telling his children the full story of how they met. Upon finishing the story, at the urging of his kids, Ted decides to ask Robin out. Alluding to the first episode (pilot), the finale ends with Robin looking out her apartment window to see Ted on the street holding the blue French horn.\n\nFollowing backlash from fans over the ending of the series, an alternate ending was cut together and released on the Season 9 DVD, in which future Ted narrates over the scene in which Ted and Tracy meet at the train station, recapping all major events from the series. He delivers the final line \"and that kids is how I met your mother\", and the episode ends, completely cutting the final scene with Penny and Luke.\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe first season was met with generally favorable reviews from critics, although some compared the series unfavorably to ''[[Friends]]''.

Michelle Zoromski of [[IGN]] gave Season 4 an overall rating of 8.5 out of 10, stating that \"This fourth season seemed to settle down the chase for the titular mother. While Ted was busy dating Stella, the gang settled into many stand alone episodes which were every bit as entertaining as episodes devoted to Ted's love life\". Zoromski went on to say: \"A stellar Robin-Marshall episode, titled '[[Little Minnesota]]', makes it clear that these two do not get enough screen time together.

Alan Sepinwall gave the season a mixed review and criticized the flash-forwards throughout the season, saying that \"the show is just much, much stronger when its stories dwell on matters of the present or the past, and where the writers don't have to act like magicians trying to keep the audience from figuring out how the trick works. And the finale affirmed that belief for me.
