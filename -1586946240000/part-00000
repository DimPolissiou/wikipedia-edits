Each town is built like a castle; the houses, themselves, form the wall, equipped with one or two easily defensible doors. Constructed from sandstone and basalt, the buildings are integrated into the landscape and it is difficult to tell where the rock and the village begins or ends.

On these terraced fields grow alfalfa for livestock, millet, lentils, large areas for coffee and [[Khat|qat]].\n\nWithin a day's journey are [[Bani Murrah]] and other villages located on the ridge overlooking [[Manakhah]]. Manakhah is the heart of mountain range, a large town whose market attracts villagers from the entire neighbourhood. [[Al Hajjara]], to the west of Manakhah, is a walled village whose citadel was founded in the 12th century by the Sulayhids. From there, other villages are accessible, such as [[Bayt al-Qamus]]  and [[Bayt Shimran]]. The village of [[Hutaib]] is built on a platform of red sandstone, facing a view of terraced hills which host a score of villages.
