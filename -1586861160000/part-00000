The signal appeared to come from the direction of the constellation [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] and bore the expected hallmarks of [[Extraterrestrial intelligence|extraterrestrial]] origin.\n\nAstronomer Jerry R. Ehman discovered the anomaly a few days later while reviewing the recorded data. He was so impressed by the result that he circled the reading on the computer printout, \"6EQUJ5\", and wrote the comment ''\"Wow!\"'' on its side, leading to the event's widely used name.<ref name=\"npr\">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126510251|title=Aliens Found In Ohio?

Many hypotheses have been advanced on the origin of the emission, including natural and human-made sources, but none of them adequately explain the signal.<ref name=Skeptoid/>\n\nAlthough the Wow! signal had no detectable [[modulation]]\u2014a technique used to transmit information over radio waves\u2014it remains the strongest candidate for an alien radio transmission ever detected.<ref name=Skeptoid/>\n\n== Background ==\nIn a 1959 paper, [[Cornell University]] physicists [[Philip Morrison]] and [[Giuseppe Cocconi]] had speculated that any [[extraterrestrial civilization]] attempting to communicate via radio signals might do so using a frequency of {{val|1420}} [[megahertz]] ({{val|21}} [[centimeters]]), which is [[Hydrogen line|naturally emitted by hydrogen]], the most common element in the universe and therefore likely familiar to all technologically advanced civilizations.<ref name=\"Nat Geo\">{{cite web|url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/chasing-ufos/articles/what-is-the-wow-signal/|title=What is the Wow! signal?|last=Kiger|first=Patrick J.|date=2012-06-21|website=National Geographic Channel|accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref>\n\nIn 1973, after completing an extensive [[Ohio Sky Survey|survey of extragalactic radio sources]], Ohio State University assigned the now-defunct [[Ohio State University Radio Observatory]] (nicknamed \"Big Ear\") to the scientific [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI), in the longest-running program of its kind in history. The radio telescope was located near the [[Perkins Observatory]] on the campus of [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] in [[Delaware, Ohio]].\n\nBy 1977, Ehman was working at the SETI project as a volunteer; his job involved analyzing by hand large amounts of data processed by an [[IBM 1130]] computer and recorded on [[line printer]] paper. While perusing data collected on August 15 at 22:16&nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (02:16&nbsp;[[UTC]]), he spotted a series of values of signal intensity and frequency that left him and his colleagues astonished.<ref name=\"Nat Geo\" />\nThe event was later documented in technical detail by the observatory's director.<ref name=Kraus>John Kraus, Director, Ohio State Radio Observatory 31, January 1994, [http://jump2.nrao.edu/dbtw-wpd/textbase/Documents/kraus-wow-unpublished-30jan1994.pdf \"The Tantalizing WOW!

The signal was [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampled]] for 10 seconds and then processed by the computer, which took 2 seconds. Therefore, every 12 seconds the result for each frequency channel was outputted on the printout as a single character, representing the 10-second average intensity, minus the baseline, expressed as a [[dimensionless]] multiple of the signal's [[standard deviation]].<ref name=\"code\">{{cite web | first = Jerry | last = Ehman | title = Explanation of the Code \"6EQUJ5\" On the Wow!

An [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]], which became the first [[local oscillator]], was ordered for the frequency of {{val|1450.4056|u=MHz}}. However, the university's purchasing department made a [[typographical error]] in the order and wrote {{val|1450.5056|u=MHz}} (i.e., {{val|0.1|u=MHz}} higher than desired). The software used in the experiment was then written to adjust for this error. When Ehman computed the frequency of the Wow! signal, he took this error into account.\n\n=== Bandwidth ===\nThe Wow! signal was a [[narrowband]] emission: its [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] was less than {{val|10|u=kHz}}. The Big Ear telescope was equipped with a receiver capable of measuring fifty {{val|10|u=kHz}}-wide channels. The output from each channel was represented in the computer printout as a column of alphanumeric intensity values. The Wow! signal is essentially confined to one column.<ref name=\"Big Ear 97\"/>\n\n=== Time variation ===\nAt the time of the observation, the Big Ear radio telescope was only adjustable for [[Horizontal coordinate system|altitude]] (or height above the horizon), and relied instead on the [[rotation of the Earth]] to scan across the sky. Given the speed of Earth's rotation and the spatial width of the telescope's observation window, the Big Ear could observe any given point for just 72 seconds.<ref name=Skeptoid>{{Skeptoid|id=4342|number=342|title=Was the Wow!

The radio telescope was located near the [[Perkins Observatory]] on the campus of [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] in [[Delaware, Ohio]].\n\nBy 1977, Ehman was working at the SETI project as a volunteer; his job involved analyzing by hand large amounts of data processed by an [[IBM 1130]] computer and recorded on [[line printer]] paper.

An [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]], which became the first [[local oscillator]], was ordered for the frequency of {{val|1450.4056|u=MHz}}. However, the university's purchasing department made a [[typographical error]] in the order and wrote {{val|1450.5056|u=MHz}} (i.e., {{val|0.1|u=MHz}} higher than desired). The software used in the experiment was then written to adjust for this error. When Ehman computed the frequency of the Wow! signal, he took this error into account.\n\n=== Bandwidth ===\nThe Wow! signal was a [[narrowband]] emission: its [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] was less than {{val|10|u=kHz}}. The Big Ear telescope was equipped with a receiver capable of measuring fifty {{val|10|u=kHz}}-wide channels. The output from each channel was represented in the computer printout as a column of alphanumeric intensity values.

This has three pairs of [[appendage]]s, all emerging from the young animal's head, and a single naupliar eye. In most groups, there are further larval stages, including the [[zoea]] (pl. zoe\u00e6 or zoeas<ref>{{OED|Zoea}}</ref>).

As a senior, he was an [[All-America]]n selection, and had 6.5 sacks and 67 [[Tackle (football move)|tackle]]s. As a junior, he was an Honorable Mention All-American selection and garnered 7.5 sacks. He graduated from Notre Dame in 1994 with a major in marketing\n\n==Professional career==\nHe was drafted by the 49ers in the 1st round (7th overall) in the [[1994 NFL Draft]].

Young had his finest statistical season in 1996 recording 84 tackles, 11.5 sacks, 4 passes defensed and 2 safeties, while earning his first trip to the [[Pro Bowl]]. In 1997, although Young's sack total dropped to just 4 on the season, he was still a dominant presence on the interior line, helping San Francisco finish first overall in the NFL in total defense that season. Despite his drop in statistical production, he was still widely considered by many to be the best all-around DT in the NFL, despite teammate DT [[Dana Stubblefield]] being named the [[NFL Defensive Player of the Year]] that same season. Young was leading the entire NFL at the DT position in sacks with 9.5 prior to his season-ending injury suffered on a [[Monday Night Football|Monday Night]] match-up against the [[New York Giants]] in week 13 of the 1998 season. The injury to Young's leg was so severe that he needed a metal rod to be inserted in the broken leg. Despite Young's devastating injury coming late in the 1998 season, he came back fully recovered in time for the 1999 season and recorded over 70 tackles, 11 sacks and a safety which earned him his second Pro Bowl. Young also received the [[NFL Comeback Player of the Year]] Award for his fantastic play that same season. Bryant Young had 89.5 career sacks in his 14-year career with the 49ers, ranking him at 6th all-time in the NFL in career sacks for a player at the DT position, trailing only [[Trevor Pryce]], [[Steve McMichael]], [[Henry Thomas]], and Hall of Famers [[John Randle]] and [[Warren Sapp]]. He also ranks third on the team's all-time career sacks list placing him behind only DE [[Tommy Hart]] and DE [[Cedric Hardman]]. Bryant Young also owns the 49ers' franchise record for career safeties, with 3.\n\nYoung is a member of the NFL's All-Decade Team of the 1990s. Young is the oldest active player in the NFL and does not plan to retire until after the 49ers win the super bowl in 2020, and became eligible for the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2013.
