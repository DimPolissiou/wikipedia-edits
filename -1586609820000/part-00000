It manufactured brakes, exhausts, compressors and various other automotive parts. The company set up a plant at [[Hosur]] in 1976, to manufacture [[moped]]s as part of their new division. In 1980, TVS 50, India's first two-seater moped rolled out of the factory at Hosur in Tamil Nadu, Southern India. A technical collaboration with the Japanese auto giant Suzuki Ltd. resulted in the joint-venture between Sundaram Clayton Ltd and Suzuki Motor Corporation, in 2017.

Re-christened TVS-Suzuki, the company brought out several models such as the Suzuki Supra, Suzuki Samurai, Suzuki Shogun and Suzuki Shaolin. In 2001, after separating ways with Suzuki, the company was renamed TVS Motor, relinquishing its rights to use the Suzuki name.

The family exhibits considerable [[Biodiversity|diversity]] and includes the '''crakes''', '''coots''', and '''gallinules'''. Many [[species]] are associated with [[wetland]]s, although the family is found in every [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] [[habitat]] except dry [[desert]]s, [[Polar climate|polar]] regions, and [[Alpine climate|alpine]] areas above the [[snow line]]. Members of the Rallidae occur on every continent except [[Antarctica]]. Numerous island species are known. The most common rail habitats are [[marsh]]land and dense forest. They are especially fond of dense vegetation.<ref name=h&r2003-206-7>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): pp.&nbsp;206\u2013207</ref>\n\n==Name==\n\n\"Rail\" is derived from French ''r\u00e2le'', from Old French ''rasle''.

They vary in length from {{convert|12|to|63|cm|in|abbr=on}} and in weight from {{convert|20|to|3000|g|oz|abbr=on}}. Some species have long necks and in many cases are laterally compressed.\n\nThe [[beak|bill]] is the most variable feature within the family. In some species, it is longer than the head (like the [[clapper rail]] of [[the Americas]]); in others, it may be short and wide (as in the [[coot]]s), or massive (as in the [[Porphyrio|purple gallinules]]).<ref name=h&r2003-208>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): p. 208</ref> A few coots and gallinules have a [[frontal shield]], which is a fleshy, rearward extension of the upper bill. The most complex frontal shield is found in the [[horned coot]].<ref name=h&r2003-210>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): p. 210</ref>\n\nRails exhibit very little [[sexual dimorphism]] in either [[plumage]] or size.\n\n===Flight and flightlessness===\nThe wings of all rails are short and rounded. The [[bird flight|flight]] of those Rallidae able to fly, while not powerful, can be sustained for long periods of time, and many species [[bird migration|migrate]] annually. The weakness of their flight, however, means they are easily blown off course, thus are common [[Vagrancy (biology)|vagrants]], a characteristic that has led them to colonize many isolated oceanic islands. Furthermore, these birds often prefer to run rather than fly, especially in dense habitat. Some are also flightless at some time during their [[moult]] periods.<ref name=h&r2003-209>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): p. 209</ref>\n\nFlightlessness in rails is one of the best examples of [[parallel evolution]] in the animal kingdom. Of the roughly 150 historically known rail species, 31 extant or recently extinct species evolved flightlessness from volant (flying) ancestors.<ref>Kirchman (2012)</ref> This process created the endemic populations of flightless rails seen on Pacific islands today.\n\nMany island rails are flightless because small island habitats without mammalian predators eliminate the need to fly or move long distances. [[Bird flight|Flight]] makes intense demands, with the [[keel (bird)|keel]] and flight muscles taking up to a quarter of a bird's weight in flying Rallidae species. Reducing the flight muscles, with a corresponding lowering of [[metabolism|metabolic]] demands, reduces the flightless rail's energy expenditures.<ref>McNab & Ellis (2006)</ref> For this reason, flightlessness makes it easier to survive and colonize an island where resources may be limited.<ref name=\"McNab 1994\">McNab (1994)</ref> This also allows for the evolution of multiple sizes of flightless rails on the same island as the birds diversify to find niches.<ref>Trewick (1997)</ref>\n\nIn addition to energy conservation, certain morphological traits also affect rail evolution. Rails have relatively shortened wings to begin with, which in combination with their terrestrial habits and behavioral flightlessness, lends speed to the evolution of flightlessness, making it remarkably fast;<ref>Livezey 2003</ref> as few as 125,000 years were needed for the [[Laysan rail]] to lose the power of flight and evolve the reduced, stubby wings only useful to keep balance when running quickly.<ref>Slikas ''et al.'' (2002)</ref> Indeed, some argue that measuring the evolution of flightlessness in rails in generations rather than millennia might be possible.<ref name=\"McNab 1994\"/>\n\nAnother factor that contributes to the occurrence of the flightless state is a climate that does not necessitate seasonal long-distance migration; this is evidenced by the tendency to evolve flightlessness at a much greater occurrence in tropical islands than in temperate or polar islands.<ref name=\"McNab 2002\">McNab 2002</ref>\n[[File:American Coot skeleton.jpg|thumb|[[American coot]] (Fulica americana) skeleton on display at the [[Museum of Osteology]].]]\nIt is paradoxical, since rails appear loath to fly, that the evolution of flightless rails would necessitate high dispersal to isolated islands.<ref name=\"McNab and Ellis 2006\">McNab and Ellis 2006</ref> Nonetheless, three species of small-massed rails, ''[[buff-banded rail|Gallirallus philippensis]]'', ''[[purple swamphen|Porphyrio porphyrio]]'', and ''[[spotless crake|Porzana tabuensis]]'', exhibit a persistently high ability to disperse long distances among tropic Pacific islands,<ref name=\"McNab and Ellis 2006\"/> though only the latter two gave rise to flightless endemic species throughout the Pacific Basin.<ref name=\"Kirchman 2012\">Kirchman 2012</ref> In examining the phylogeny of ''G. philippensis'', although the species is clearly polyphyletic (it has more than one ancestral species), it is not the ancestor of most of its flightless descendants, revealing that the flightless condition evolved in rails before speciation was complete.<ref name=\"Kirchman 2012\"/>\n\nA consequence of lowered energy expenditure in flightless island rails has also been associated with evolution of their \"tolerance\" and \"approachability\".<ref name=\"McNab 2002\"/> For example, the (non-Rallidae) Corsican [[blue tit]]s exhibit lower aggression and reduced territorial defense behaviors than do their mainland European counterparts,<ref>Perret and Blondel 1993</ref> but this tolerance may be limited to close relatives.<ref>Granjon and Cheylan 1989</ref> The resulting kin-selecting altruistic phenomena reallocate resources to produce fewer young that are more competitive and would benefit the population as an entirety, rather than many young that would exhibit less fitness.<ref name=\"McNab 2002\"/> Unfortunately, with the human occupation of most islands in the past 5,000 to 35,000 years, selection has undoubtedly reversed the tolerance into a wariness of humans and predators, causing species unequipped for the change to become susceptible to extinction.<ref name=\"McNab 2002\"/>\n\n==Behaviour and ecology==\nIn general, members of the Rallidae are omnivorous generalists. Many species eat [[invertebrate]]s, as well as fruit or seedlings. A few species are primarily [[Herbivore|herbivorous]].<ref name=h&r2003-206-7 /> The [[bird song|calls]] of Rallidae species vary and are often quite loud. Some are whistle-like or squeak-like, while others seem unbirdlike.<ref name=\"Perrins p207\">Horsfall & Robinson (2003): p.&nbsp;207</ref> Loud calls are useful in dense vegetation, or at night where seeing another member of the species is difficult. Some calls are [[Territory (animal)|territorial]].<ref name=h&r2003-208 />\n\nThe most typical family members occupy dense [[vegetation]] in damp environments near [[lake]]s, [[swamp]]s, or [[river]]s. [[Reed bed]]s are a particularly favoured habitat. Those that [[bird migration|migrate]] do so at night.\n\nMost [[bird nest|nest]] in dense vegetation. In general, they are shy, secretive, and difficult to observe. Most species walk and run vigorously on strong legs, and have long toes that are well adapted to soft, uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings, and although they are generally weak [[Bird flight|fliers]], they are, nevertheless, capable of covering long distances. Island species often become [[Flightless bird|flightless]], and many of them are now [[Extinction|extinct]] following the introduction of terrestrial [[Predation|predators]] such as [[cat]]s, [[rat]]s, and [[pig]]s.\n\nMany reedbed species are secretive (apart from loud calls), [[crepuscular]], and have laterally flattened bodies. In the [[Old World]], long-billed species tend to be called rails and short-billed species crakes. [[North America]]n species are normally called rails irrespective of bill length. The smallest of these is [[Swinhoe's rail]], at {{convert|13|cm|in|abbr=on}} and 25&nbsp;g. The larger species are also sometimes given other names.

The family exhibits considerable [[Biodiversity|diversity]] and includes the '''crakes''', '''coots''', and '''gallinules'''. Many [[species]] are associated with [[wetland]]s, although the family is found in every [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] [[habitat]] except dry [[desert]]s, [[Polar climate|polar]] regions, and [[Alpine climate|alpine]] areas above the [[snow line]]. Members of the Rallidae occur on every continent except [[Antarctica]]. Numerous island species are known. The most common rail habitats are [[marsh]]land and dense forest. They are especially fond of dense vegetation.<ref name=h&r2003-206-7>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): pp.&nbsp;206\u2013207</ref>\n\n==Name==\n\n\"Rail\" is derived from French ''r\u00e2le'', from Old French ''rasle''.  It is named from its harsh cry, in [[Vulgar Latin]] *''rascula'', from [[Latin]] ''r\u0101dere'' ('to scrape').<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=p-q6DAAAQBAJ&pg=PT132&dq=rasculum+rail#v=onepage|title=Lapwings, Loons and Lousy Jacks: The How and Why of Bird Names|first=Ray|last=Reedman|date=15 August 2016|publisher=Pelagic Publishing Ltd|isbn=9781784270933|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n==Morphology==\n[[File:Takahe.jpg|thumb|right|180px|South Island [[takahe]] (''Porphyrio hochstetteri'') from behind, showing the short, soft, and fluffy [[Flight feather|remiges]] typical of flightless rails]]\nThe rails are a family of small to medium-sized, ground-living birds. They vary in length from {{convert|12|to|63|cm|in|abbr=on}} and in weight from {{convert|20|to|3000|g|oz|abbr=on}}. Some species have long necks and in many cases are laterally compressed.\n\nThe [[beak|bill]] is the most variable feature within the family. In some species, it is longer than the head (like the [[clapper rail]] of [[the Americas]]); in others, it may be short and wide (as in the [[coot]]s), or massive (as in the [[Porphyrio|purple gallinules]]).<ref name=h&r2003-208>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): p. 208</ref> A few coots and gallinules have a [[frontal shield]], which is a fleshy, rearward extension of the upper bill. The most complex frontal shield is found in the [[horned coot]].<ref name=h&r2003-210>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): p. 210</ref>\n\nRails exhibit very little [[sexual dimorphism]] in either [[plumage]] or size.\n\n===Flight and flightlessness===\nThe wings of all rails are short and rounded. The [[bird flight|flight]] of those Rallidae able to fly, while not powerful, can be sustained for long periods of time, and many species [[bird migration|migrate]] annually. The weakness of their flight, however, means they are easily blown off course, thus are common [[Vagrancy (biology)|vagrants]], a characteristic that has led them to colonize many isolated oceanic islands. Furthermore, these birds often prefer to run rather than fly, especially in dense habitat. Some are also flightless at some time during their [[moult]] periods.<ref name=h&r2003-209>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): p. 209</ref>\n\nFlightlessness in rails is one of the best examples of [[parallel evolution]] in the animal kingdom. Of the roughly 150 historically known rail species, 31 extant or recently extinct species evolved flightlessness from volant (flying) ancestors.<ref>Kirchman (2012)</ref> This process created the endemic populations of flightless rails seen on Pacific islands today.\n\nMany island rails are flightless because small island habitats without mammalian predators eliminate the need to fly or move long distances. [[Bird flight|Flight]] makes intense demands, with the [[keel (bird)|keel]] and flight muscles taking up to a quarter of a bird's weight in flying Rallidae species. Reducing the flight muscles, with a corresponding lowering of [[metabolism|metabolic]] demands, reduces the flightless rail's energy expenditures.<ref>McNab & Ellis (2006)</ref> For this reason, flightlessness makes it easier to survive and colonize an island where resources may be limited.<ref name=\"McNab 1994\">McNab (1994)</ref> This also allows for the evolution of multiple sizes of flightless rails on the same island as the birds diversify to find niches.<ref>Trewick (1997)</ref>\n\nIn addition to energy conservation, certain morphological traits also affect rail evolution. Rails have relatively shortened wings to begin with, which in combination with their terrestrial habits and behavioral flightlessness, lends speed to the evolution of flightlessness, making it remarkably fast;<ref>Livezey 2003</ref> as few as 125,000 years were needed for the [[Laysan rail]] to lose the power of flight and evolve the reduced, stubby wings only useful to keep balance when running quickly.<ref>Slikas ''et al.'' (2002)</ref> Indeed, some argue that measuring the evolution of flightlessness in rails in generations rather than millennia might be possible.<ref name=\"McNab 1994\"/>\n\nAnother factor that contributes to the occurrence of the flightless state is a climate that does not necessitate seasonal long-distance migration; this is evidenced by the tendency to evolve flightlessness at a much greater occurrence in tropical islands than in temperate or polar islands.<ref name=\"McNab 2002\">McNab 2002</ref>\n[[File:American Coot skeleton.jpg|thumb|[[American coot]] (Fulica americana) skeleton on display at the [[Museum of Osteology]].]]\nIt is paradoxical, since rails appear loath to fly, that the evolution of flightless rails would necessitate high dispersal to isolated islands.<ref name=\"McNab and Ellis 2006\">McNab and Ellis 2006</ref> Nonetheless, three species of small-massed rails, ''[[buff-banded rail|Gallirallus philippensis]]'', ''[[purple swamphen|Porphyrio porphyrio]]'', and ''[[spotless crake|Porzana tabuensis]]'', exhibit a persistently high ability to disperse long distances among tropic Pacific islands,<ref name=\"McNab and Ellis 2006\"/> though only the latter two gave rise to flightless endemic species throughout the Pacific Basin.<ref name=\"Kirchman 2012\">Kirchman 2012</ref> In examining the phylogeny of ''G. philippensis'', although the species is clearly polyphyletic (it has more than one ancestral species), it is not the ancestor of most of its flightless descendants, revealing that the flightless condition evolved in rails before speciation was complete.<ref name=\"Kirchman 2012\"/>\n\nA consequence of lowered energy expenditure in flightless island rails has also been associated with evolution of their \"tolerance\" and \"approachability\".<ref name=\"McNab 2002\"/> For example, the (non-Rallidae) Corsican [[blue tit]]s exhibit lower aggression and reduced territorial defense behaviors than do their mainland European counterparts,<ref>Perret and Blondel 1993</ref> but this tolerance may be limited to close relatives.<ref>Granjon and Cheylan 1989</ref> The resulting kin-selecting altruistic phenomena reallocate resources to produce fewer young that are more competitive and would benefit the population as an entirety, rather than many young that would exhibit less fitness.<ref name=\"McNab 2002\"/> Unfortunately, with the human occupation of most islands in the past 5,000 to 35,000 years, selection has undoubtedly reversed the tolerance into a wariness of humans and predators, causing species unequipped for the change to become susceptible to extinction.<ref name=\"McNab 2002\"/>\n\n==Behaviour and ecology==\nIn general, members of the Rallidae are omnivorous generalists. Many species eat [[invertebrate]]s, as well as fruit or seedlings. A few species are primarily [[Herbivore|herbivorous]].<ref name=h&r2003-206-7 /> The [[bird song|calls]] of Rallidae species vary and are often quite loud. Some are whistle-like or squeak-like, while others seem unbirdlike.<ref name=\"Perrins p207\">Horsfall & Robinson (2003): p.&nbsp;207</ref> Loud calls are useful in dense vegetation, or at night where seeing another member of the species is difficult. Some calls are [[Territory (animal)|territorial]].<ref name=h&r2003-208 />\n\nThe most typical family members occupy dense [[vegetation]] in damp environments near [[lake]]s, [[swamp]]s, or [[river]]s. [[Reed bed]]s are a particularly favoured habitat. Those that [[bird migration|migrate]] do so at night.\n\nMost [[bird nest|nest]] in dense vegetation. In general, they are shy, secretive, and difficult to observe. Most species walk and run vigorously on strong legs, and have long toes that are well adapted to soft, uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings, and although they are generally weak [[Bird flight|fliers]], they are, nevertheless, capable of covering long distances. Island species often become [[Flightless bird|flightless]], and many of them are now [[Extinction|extinct]] following the introduction of terrestrial [[Predation|predators]] such as [[cat]]s, [[rat]]s, and [[pig]]s.\n\nMany reedbed species are secretive (apart from loud calls), [[crepuscular]], and have laterally flattened bodies. In the [[Old World]], long-billed species tend to be called rails and short-billed species crakes. [[North America]]n species are normally called rails irrespective of bill length. The smallest of these is [[Swinhoe's rail]], at {{convert|13|cm|in|abbr=on}} and 25&nbsp;g. The larger species are also sometimes given other names. The black coots are more adapted to open water than their relatives, and some other large species are called gallinules and swamphens. The largest of this group is the [[takahe]], at {{convert|65|cm|in|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2.7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe rails have suffered disproportionally from human changes to the environment, and an estimated<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Magnitude and variation of prehistoric bird extinctions in the Pacific|first1=Richard P.|last1=Duncan|first2=Alison G.|last2=Boyer|first3=Tim M.|last3=Blackburn|year=2013|journal=PNAS|volume=110|issue=16|pages=6436\u20136441|doi=10.1073/pnas.1216511110|pmid=23530197|pmc=3631643}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://therevelator.org/memorial-day-wake-island-rail/|title=Memorializing the Wake Island Rail: An Extinction Caused by War|last=Platt|first=John R.|date=May 2018|website=TheRevelator.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Extinction and Biogeography of Tropical Pacific Birds|last=Steadman|first=David W.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2006|isbn=9780226771427|location=|pages=296}}</ref> several hundred species of island rails have become extinct because of this. Several island species of rails remain [[endangered species|endangered]], and [[bird conservation|conservation]] organisations and governments continue to work to prevent their extinction.\n\n===Reproduction===\nThe breeding behaviors of many Rallidae species are poorly understood or unknown. Most are thought to be [[Monogamy|monogamous]], although [[polygyny]] and [[polyandry]] have been reported.<ref name=h&r2003-209-10>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): pp.&nbsp;209\u2013210</ref> Most often, they lay five to 10 [[egg (biology)|eggs]]. [[Clutch (eggs)|Clutch]]es as small as one or as large as 15 eggs are known.<ref name=h&r2003-209-10 /> Egg clutches may not always hatch at the same time. Chicks become mobile after a few days. They often depend on their parents until fledging, which happens around 1 month old.<ref name=h&r2003-210 />\n\n==Rallidae and humans==\n[[File:GuamRail02.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Guam rail]] is an example of an island species that has been badly affected by [[introduced species]].]]\n\nSome larger, more abundant rails are [[hunting|hunted]] and their eggs collected for food.<ref name=h&r2003-211>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): p. 211</ref> The [[Wake Island rail]] was hunted to extinction by the starving Japanese garrison after the island was cut off from supply during [[World War II]].<ref>BLI (2007)</ref> At least two species, the [[common moorhen]] and the [[American purple gallinule]], have been considered [[Pest (organism)|pests]].<ref name=h&r2003-211 />\n\n===Threats and conservation===\nDue to their tendencies towards flightlessness, many island species have been unable to cope with introduced species. The most dramatic human-caused extinctions occurred in the [[Pacific Ocean]] as people colonised the islands of [[Melanesia]], [[Polynesia]], and [[Micronesia]], during which an estimated 750\u20131800 species of birds became extinct, half of which were rails.<ref>Steadman (2006)</ref> Some species that came close to extinction, such as the [[Lord Howe woodhen]], and the takahe, have made modest recoveries due to the efforts of conservation organisations. The [[Guam rail]] came perilously close to extinction when [[brown tree snake]]s were introduced to [[Guam]], but some of the last remaining individuals were taken into captivity and are breeding well, though attempts at reintroduction have met with mixed results.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/GUAM-BROWN-TREE-SNAKE-RESPONSIBLE-FOR-EXTINCTION-OF-5-SPECIES/4b735e75e7fe9b8d2ef464b66ecaaa0c?searchfilter=Compilations%2Furl%2FAnimal+Attacks%2F46|title=GUAM: BROWN TREE SNAKE RESPONSIBLE FOR EXTINCTION OF 5 SPECIES|last=|first=|date=February 1996|website=AP Archive|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/guam-rail|title=Guam Rail Gallirallus owstoni|last=|first=|date=|website=San Diego Zoo.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/news/guam-bird-coming-back-extinction-wild|title=Is this Guam bird coming back from extinction in the wild?|last=Hurrell|first=Shaun|date=|website=BirdLife International.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Systematics and evolution==\nThe family Rallidae was introduced (as Rallia) by the French [[polymath]] [[Constantine Samuel Rafinesque]] in 1815.<ref>{{ cite book | last=Rafinesque | first=Constantine Samuel | author-link=Constantine Samuel Rafinesque | year=1815 | title=Analyse de la nature ou, Tableau de l'univers et des corps organis\u00e9s | publisher=Self-published | place=Palermo | language=French | page=70 | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/48310148 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Bock | first=Walter J. | year=1994 | title=History and Nomenclature of Avian Family-Group Names | series=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History | volume= Number 222 | publisher=American Museum of Natural History | place=New York | pages=136, 252 | hdl=2246/830 }}<!--Linked page allows download of the 48MB pdf--></ref>\nThe family has traditionally been grouped with two families of larger birds, the [[crane (bird)|cranes]] and [[bustard]]s, as well as several smaller families of usually \"primitive\" midsized amphibious birds, to make up the order [[Gruiformes]].

However, such a group would probably also include the [[Heliornithidae]] (finfoots and sungrebes), an exclusively [[Tropics|tropical]] group that is somewhat [[convergent evolution|convergent]] with [[grebe]]s, and usually united with the rails in the Ralli.\n\n===Extant and recently extinct genera===\n[[File:Red-Legged Crake.jpg|thumb|right|[[Red-legged crake]], ''Rallina fasciata'']]\n[[File:Rallus aquaticus 1 (Marek Szczepanek).jpg|thumb|right|[[Water rail]], ''Rallus aquaticus'']]\n[[File:Porzana porzana 5 (Marek Szczepanek).jpg|thumb|right|Immature [[spotted crake]] (''Porzana porzana'')]]\nThe list maintained by [[Frank Gill (ornithologist)|Frank Gill]] and David Donsker on behalf of the [[International Ornithological Committee]] (IOC) contains 156 species divided into 41 genera.<ref name=ioc>{{cite web| editor1-last=Gill | editor1-first=Frank | editor1-link=Frank Gill (ornithologist) | editor2-last=Donsker | editor2-first=David | year=2019 | title=Flufftails, finfoots, rails, trumpeters, cranes, limpkin | work=World Bird List Version 9.2 | url=https://www.worldbirdnames.org/bow/flufftails/ | publisher=International Ornithologists' Union | accessdate=8 July 2019 }}</ref> For more detail, see [[List of rail species]].\n\n* ''Himantornis'' \u2013 [[Nkulengu rail]]\n* ''Canirallus'' \u2013 [[grey-throated rail]]\n* ''[[Coturnicops]]'' (3 species)\n* ''Micropygia'' \u2013 [[ocellated crake]]\n* ''[[Rallicula]]'' \u2013 forest rails (4 species)\n* ''[[Rallina]]'' (4 species)\n* ''Anurolimnas'' \u2013 [[chestnut-headed crake]]\n* ''[[Laterallus]]'' (11 species)\n* ''[[Nesoclopeus]]'' (1 living species, 1 recently extinct)\n* ''[[Gallirallus]]'' \u2013 Austropacific rails (including ''Tricholimnas''; 11 living species, four recently extinct)\n* ''Diaphorapteryx'' \u2013 [[Hawkins's rail]] (recently extinct)\n* ''[[Rallus]]'' \u2013 typical rails (14 species)\n* ''[[Lewinia]]'' (3 species)\n* ''[[Dryolimnas]]'' (1 living species, 1 recently extinct)\n* ''Aphanapteryx'' \u2013 [[red rail]] (recently extinct)\n* ''Erythromachus'' \u2013 [[Rodrigues rail]] (recently extinct)\n* ''[[Crex]]'' (2 species)\n* ''Rougetius'' \u2013 [[Rouget's rail]]\n* ''Aramidopsis'' \u2013 [[snoring rail]]\n* ''Mundia'' \u2013 [[Ascension crake]] (recently extinct)\n* ''Aphanocrex'' \u2013 [[Saint Helena Rail]] (recently extinct)\n* ''Atlantisia'' \u2013 [[Inaccessible Island rail]]\n* ''[[Aramides]]'' \u2013 wood rails (8 species)\n* ''Amaurolimnas'' \u2013 [[uniform crake]]\n* ''[[Gymnocrex]]'' (3 species)\n* ''[[Amaurornis]]'' \u2013 bush-hens (8 species)\n* ''[[Porzana]]'' \u2013 typical crakes (14 living species, 5 recently extinct)\n* ''Aenigmatolimnas'' \u2013 [[striped crake]]\n* ''Cyanolimnas'' \u2013 [[Zapata rail]]\n* ''[[Neocrex]]'' (2 species)\n* ''[[Pardirallus]]'' (3 species)\n* ''Eulabeornis'' \u2013 [[chestnut rail]]\n* ''Habroptila'' \u2013 [[invisible rail]]\n* ''Megacrex'' \u2013 [[New Guinea flightless rail]]\n* ''Gallicrex'' \u2013 [[watercock]]\n* ''[[Porphyrio]]'' \u2013 swamphens and purple gallinules (10 living species, 2 recently extinct)\n* ''[[Moorhen|Gallinula]]'' \u2013 typical gallinules (5 living species, 2 recently extinct)\n* ''Paragallinula'' \u2013 [[lesser moorhen]]\n* ''Porphyriops'' \u2013 [[spot-flanked gallinule]]\n* ''[[Tribonyx]]'' \u2013 nativehens (2 living species)\n* ''[[Coot|Fulica]]'' \u2013 coots (10 living species, one recently extinct)\n* ''[[Mustelirallus]]'' (three species)\n\nAdditionally, many prehistoric rails of extant genera are known only from [[fossil]] or subfossil remains, such as the [[Ibiza rail]] (''Rallus eivissensis'').

A reported azide-free Roche synthesis of tamiflu is summarised graphically below:<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 11300898 | volume=66 | title=New, azide-free transformation of epoxides into 1,2-diamino compounds: synthesis of the anti-influenza neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu) | date=March 2001 | journal=J.

The 3,4-pentylidene acetal [[mesylate]] is prepared in three steps: [[esterification]] with [[ethanol]] and [[thionyl chloride]]; [[ketal]]ization with [[P-Toluenesulfonic acid|''p''-toluenesulfonic acid]] and [[3-pentanone]]; and mesylation with [[triethylamine]] and [[methanesulfonyl chloride]].

The corresponding [[epoxide]] is formed under basic conditions with [[potassium bicarbonate]].  Using the inexpensive [[Lewis acid]] magnesium bromide diethyl etherate (commonly prepared fresh by the addition of [[magnesium]]\nturnings to [[1,2-Dibromoethane|1,2-dibromoethane]] in [[benzene]]:[[diethyl ether]]), the epoxide is opened with [[allyl amine]] to yield the corresponding 1,2-amino alcohol.  The water-immiscible [[solvent]]s [[methyl tert-butyl ether]] and [[acetonitrile]] are used to simplify the workup procedure, which involved stirring with 1&nbsp;M aqueous [[ammonium sulfate]].  Reduction on [[palladium]], promoted by [[ethanolamine]], followed by acidic workup yielded the deprotected 1,2-aminoalcohol.  The aminoalcohol was converted directly to the corresponding allyl-diamine in an interesting cascade sequence that commences with the unselective [[imination]] of [[benzaldehyde]] with [[azeotropic]] water removal in methyl tert-butyl ether.  Mesylation, followed by removal of the solid byproduct [[triethylamine]] [[hydrochloride]], results in an intermediate that was poised to undergo [[aziridination]] upon [[transimination]] with another equivalent of allylamine.  With the librated [[methanesulfonic acid]], the\n[[aziridine]] opens cleanly to yield a diamine that immediately undergoes a second transimination.  Acidic [[hydrolysis]] then removed the [[imine]].  Selective [[acylation]] with [[acetic anhydride]] (under [[buffer solution|buffered]] conditions, the 5-amino group is [[Protonation|protonated]] owing to a considerable difference in [[acid dissociation constant|p''K''<sub>a</sub>]], 4.2 vs 7.9, preventing [[acetylation]]) yields the desired ''N''-acetylated product in crystalline form upon extractive workup.  Finally, [[deallylation]] as above, yielded the [[Freebase (chemistry)|freebase]] of oseltamivir, which was converted to the desired oseltamivir phosphate by treatment with [[phosphoric acid]].  The final product is obtained in high purity (99.7%) and an overall yield of 17-22% from (\u2212)-shikimic acid.  It is noted that the synthesis avoids the use of potentially explosive [[azide]] reagents and intermediates; however, the synthesis actually used by Roche uses azides.  Roche has other routes to\noseltamivir that do not involve the use of (\u2212)-shikimic acid as a chiral pool starting material, such as a Diels-Alder route involving furan and [[ethyl acrylate]] or an [[isophthalic acid]] route, which involves catalytic hydrogenation and enzymatic desymmetrization.\n\n==Corey synthesis==\nIn 2006 the group of [[E.J. Corey]] published a novel route bypassing shikimic acid starting from [[butadiene]] and [[acrylic acid]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Yeung | first1 = Ying-Yeung | last2 = Hong | first2 = Sungwoo | last3 = Corey | first3 = E.

The corresponding [[epoxide]] is formed under basic conditions with [[potassium bicarbonate]].  Using the inexpensive [[Lewis acid]] magnesium bromide diethyl etherate (commonly prepared fresh by the addition of [[magnesium]]\nturnings to [[1,2-Dibromoethane|1,2-dibromoethane]] in [[benzene]]:[[diethyl ether]]), the epoxide is opened with [[allyl amine]] to yield the corresponding 1,2-amino alcohol.  The water-immiscible [[solvent]]s [[methyl tert-butyl ether]] and [[acetonitrile]] are used to simplify the workup procedure, which involved stirring with 1&nbsp;M aqueous [[ammonium sulfate]].  Reduction on [[palladium]], promoted by [[ethanolamine]], followed by acidic workup yielded the deprotected 1,2-aminoalcohol.  The aminoalcohol was converted directly to the corresponding allyl-diamine in an interesting cascade sequence that commences with the unselective [[imination]] of [[benzaldehyde]] with [[azeotropic]] water removal in methyl tert-butyl ether.  Mesylation, followed by removal of the solid byproduct [[triethylamine]] [[hydrochloride]], results in an intermediate that was poised to undergo [[aziridination]] upon [[transimination]] with another equivalent of allylamine.  With the librated [[methanesulfonic acid]], the\n[[aziridine]] opens cleanly to yield a diamine that immediately undergoes a second transimination.  Acidic [[hydrolysis]] then removed the [[imine]].  Selective [[acylation]] with [[acetic anhydride]] (under [[buffer solution|buffered]] conditions, the 5-amino group is [[Protonation|protonated]] owing to a considerable difference in [[acid dissociation constant|p''K''<sub>a</sub>]], 4.2 vs 7.9, preventing [[acetylation]]) yields the desired ''N''-acetylated product in crystalline form upon extractive workup.  Finally, [[deallylation]] as above, yielded the [[Freebase (chemistry)|freebase]] of oseltamivir, which was converted to the desired oseltamivir phosphate by treatment with [[phosphoric acid]].  The final product is obtained in high purity (99.7%) and an overall yield of 17-22% from (\u2212)-shikimic acid.  It is noted that the synthesis avoids the use of potentially explosive [[azide]] reagents and intermediates; however, the synthesis actually used by Roche uses azides.  Roche has other routes to\noseltamivir that do not involve the use of (\u2212)-shikimic acid as a chiral pool starting material, such as a Diels-Alder route involving furan and [[ethyl acrylate]] or an [[isophthalic acid]] route, which involves catalytic hydrogenation and enzymatic desymmetrization.\n\n==Corey synthesis==\nIn 2006 the group of [[E.J.

It is on the east coast of the [[Gulf of Thailand]], about {{convert|100|km}} southeast of [[Bangkok]], within, but not part of, [[Bang Lamung District]] in the province of [[Chonburi Province|Chonburi]]. Pattaya City ({{lang-th|\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e1e\u0e31\u0e17\u0e22\u0e32}}, {{RTGS|''Mueang Phatthaya''}}) is a self-governing municipal area which covers [[tambon]]s Nong Prue and Na Klua and parts of Huai Yai and Nong Pla Lai. The city is in the industrial [[Eastern Seaboard of Thailand|Eastern Seaboard]] zone, along with [[Si Racha]], [[Laem Chabang]], and [[Chonburi (city)|Chonburi]]. Pattaya is at the center of the Pattaya-Chonburi Metropolitan Area\u2014a [[wikt:conurbation|conurbation]] in Chonburi Province\u2014with a population of roughly 1,000,000.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Pattaya,_Thailand_Skyline.jpg|thumb|left|Pattaya skyline]]\n\nThe name ''Pattaya'' evolved from the march of [[Phraya]] Tak (later [[King Taksin]]) and his army from [[Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Province|Ayutthaya]] to [[Chanthaburi Province|Chanthaburi]], which took place before the fall of the former capital to [[Burma|Burmese]] invaders in 1767. When his army arrived in the vicinity of what is now Pattaya, Phraya Tak encountered the troops of a local leader named Nai Klom, who tried to intercept him. When the two met face to face, Nai Klom was impressed by Phraya Tak's dignified manner and his army's strict discipline. He surrendered without a fight and joined his forces. The place the armies confronted each other was thereafter known as \"Thap Phraya\", which means the \"army of the Phraya\". This later became Pattaya, the name of the wind blowing from the south-west to the north-east at the beginning of the rainy season.\n\nPattaya was a fishing village until the 1960s. Tourism began during the [[Vietnam War]], when American servicemen began arriving on [[R&R (military)|R&R]] (rest and relaxation). One large group who arrived from a base in [[Nakhon Ratchasima|Korat]] on 29 June 1959 and rented houses from Phraya Sunthorn at the south end of the beach, on what is now known as the \"Strip\", are credited with recommending Pattaya, whose fame spread by [[word of mouth]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schauseil|first1=Jan|title=Sattahip and the history of GIs coming to

census 2010 (National Statistics Office).<ref>http://citypopulation.de/Thailand-MunAreas.html</ref> Most of these people counted are Thai, with most migrant populations not recognized, although the details are quite complex as there are even indigenous Thais without nationality, and migrant workers have since been largely regularized (albeit with due foreign pressure).  Therefore, the census population even does not represent the total figure.  As for Thai nationals and legal permanent residents (very few) registering the city as their hometown, the provincial authority logged population was 107,944 in 2010, modestly rising to 119,530 by 2019.<ref name=\"TDD\"/> As with the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Region]], registered population figure issued by a different agency than the National Statistics Office hardly captures the scope of the urban transformation that has occurred over the time span \u2013 the economy is dependent on the large numbers of casual Thai workers who work in the city yet remain registered in their hometowns, there is much employment turnover and to and from the capital, as well as seasonal farm migration.  Migrant workers from neighboring nations, and many long-term [[expatriate]]s who reside in the city as retirees or self-employed or contracted are traditionally not counted.  There has never been a reliably published figure for total population, but its thought to be quite large (on the order of half a million people) given the ubiquity and sheer number of migrant workers taking place of Thai labor.  Pattaya city excludes some nearby areas like [[Nong Prue]] (73,901 people in 2010 census) and Huay Yai.\n\nPattaya additionally has massive population inflow from short stay tourism, with its 2000 hotels and 136,000 rooms available as of 2015.<ref>{{cite news | newspaper=Bangkok Post | url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/archive/chinese-put-squeeze-on-pattaya-hotels/622728 | title=Chinese put squeeze on Pattaya's hotels  | date=15 July 2015 | accessdate=12 March 2018 |url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\nDue to the tourist industry, many people from the north-east (known as [[Isan]], the poorest region of Thailand) have come to work in Pattaya, and are counted for census purposes in their hometowns. A majority of these northeast workers fulfill positions in the Go-Go bar industry, the pay they can earn is far more than that in their home region of Isaan.\n\nA growing community of foreign [[Pensioner|retirees]] live in Pattaya. Thailand immigration has a special visa category for foreigners over age 50 who wish to retire in Thailand. Pattaya is attractive to many retirees from other countries not only because of its climate and lifestyle, but also because living costs are lower than in many countries.{{citation needed|date=February 2020 }}\n{{wide image|File:Pattaya Panorama.jpg|1024px|align-cap=center|Pattaya from Pratumnak Hill}}\n\n== Physical geography ==\n[[File:AmphoePattaya 2004.PNG|thumb|left|Mueang Pattaya, Bang Lamung District]]\n\nPattaya, on the Gulf of Thailand, is approximately {{convert|160|km}} south of the city of Bangkok in [[Bang Lamung District]], [[Chonburi Province]].\n\nThe city of Pattaya is a special municipal area which covers the whole ''tambon'' [[Nong Prue]] (Nongprue) and [[Na Kluea]] (Naklua) and parts of [[Huai Yai]] and [[Nong Pla Lai]].  [[Bang Lamung township]] which forms the northern border of Pattaya covers parts of the ''tambon'' Bang Lamung (Banglamung), [[Nong Pla Lai]] and [[Takhian Tia]]. Bang Sali is on the southern border of Pattaya.\n\n\"Greater Pattaya\" occupies most of the coastline of Banglamung (one of the eleven districts that make up Chonburi Province). It is divided into a larger northern section which spans the areas to the east of Naklua Beach (the most northern beach) and Pattaya Beach (the main beach) plus Pratamnak Hill (often called \"Buddha Hill\" because of the temples on top of the hill) headland immediately south of Pattaya Beach, and a smaller southern section covering the area to the east of Jomtien Beach (directly south of Pratamnak Hill).\n\n=== Beaches and islands ===\n{{wide image|Pattaya_Bay_Panorama.jpg|1050px|align-cap=center|The Pattaya Bay area is one of Asia's largest beach resorts and the second most visited city in Thailand, after Bangkok.

Pattaya Beach lies parallel to the city centre, and runs from Pattaya Nuea south to [[Walking Street, Pattaya|Walking Street]], about 2.7&nbsp;km long. The beach, which used to be 35&nbsp;m wide, suffers from erosion and in some places was reduced to a width of only two to three meters. A 429 million [[Thai baht|baht]] beach restoration scheme was implemented in 2018. It will take 360,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup> of sand from Ko Rang Kwian offshore to increase the beach width to 50&nbsp;m.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Pupattanapong |first1=Chaiyot |title=Restored Pattaya beach lures tourists |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1516086/restored-pattaya-beach-lures-tourists |accessdate=5 August 2018 |work=Bangkok Post |date=5 August 2018}}</ref> Without intervention Pattaya will likely see its beaches disappear in roughly ten years according to [[Chulalongkorn University]] researchers. Within a month of the completion of the restoration of the first 400&nbsp;m of Pattaya Beach, the work was \"seriously damaged\" by flooding.

They deemed sea water quality near central Pattaya beaches as \"poor\" and deteriorating. They judged water quality near Na Klua in North Pattaya, South Pattaya, Ko Lan, and Jomtien Beach as \"fairly good\". The city has considered expanding two water management plants to increase capacity for better treatment of wastewater prior to discharge into the ocean. The water treatment plant in Soi Wat Nongyai after expansion would be able to treat around 130,000 cubic metres of waste water a day, up from 80,000 cubic metres at present.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pupattanapong|first1=Chaiyot|title=Pattaya sea water quality gets 'poor' grade|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1015553/pattaya-sea-water-quality-gets-poor-grade|accessdate=26 April 2018|work=Bangkok Post|date=2016-06-21}}</ref> The expansion was never implemented.<ref name=BP-20181123/>\n\nIn November 2018, the Pattaya City Council approved 188 million [[Thai baht|baht]] for the repair of its six wastewater treatment plants.

Investments totaling more than 1.5 trillion baht (US$45 billion) are flowing into EEC infrastructure projects: airports, deep-sea ports, high-speed railways, autoroutes. The result will enhance Pattaya's accessibility. According to the [[Thai Chamber of Commerce]] (TCC) the EEC investments, the [[U-Tapao International Airport]] and the [[High-speed rail in Thailand|high-speed train]] that will link three major airports to Pattaya, will make Pattaya the heart of the eastern region. The TCC view is that, \"Plenty of attractions...will lure lots more foreign and domestic tourists in the future.\" Better connectivity will reduce both the cost and time to travel to Pattaya, with the TCC estimating the number of tourists visiting the EEC region to rise to 46.7 million over the next few years, one and half times the current 29.8 million visitors. Pattaya projects include developing a tram in the city and building a bigger cruise terminal, as well as new tourist attractions: a water park, an ice dome, cultural markets, Thai boxing gyms, theaters, and conference halls. All are under development. \"We aimed to get rid of the previous [seedy] image of Pattaya and try to promote a new image to show that Pattaya is a place for everyone with diversity of new tourist attractions,\" said an official of the [[Tourism Authority of Thailand]] (TAT). He said that the EEC would make Pattaya more competitive compared with other popular Thai beach destinations such as [[Phuket Province|Phuket]] and [[Ko Samui]], with cheaper transport costs.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Phoonphongphiphat |first1=Apornrath |title=Thai businesses to revitalize Pattaya tourism via economic zone |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-Trends/Thai-businesses-to-revitalize-Pattaya-tourism-via-economic-zone |accessdate=7 August 2018 |work=Nikkei Asian Review |date=6 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pattaya-11.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Shopping mall in Pattaya]]\n[[File:Pattaya in daytime June 2017.jpg|thumb|right|Central Pattaya]]\nFourteen million visitors in 2018 contributed 239 billion [[Thai baht|baht]] to the city's treasury.

When his army arrived in the vicinity of what is now Pattaya, Phraya Tak encountered the troops of a local leader named Nai Klom, who tried to intercept him. When the two met face to face, Nai Klom was impressed by Phraya Tak's dignified manner and his army's strict discipline. He surrendered without a fight and joined his forces. The place the armies confronted each other was thereafter known as \"Thap Phraya\", which means the \"army of the Phraya\". This later became Pattaya, the name of the wind blowing from the south-west to the north-east at the beginning of the rainy season.\n\nPattaya was a fishing village until the 1960s. Tourism began during the [[Vietnam War]], when American servicemen began arriving on [[R&R (military)|R&R]] (rest and relaxation). One large group who arrived from a base in [[Nakhon Ratchasima|Korat]] on 29 June 1959 and rented houses from Phraya Sunthorn at the south end of the beach, on what is now known as the \"Strip\", are credited with recommending Pattaya, whose fame spread by [[word of mouth]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schauseil|first1=Jan|title=Sattahip and the history of GIs coming to

census 2010 (National Statistics Office).<ref>http://citypopulation.de/Thailand-MunAreas.html</ref> Most of these people counted are Thai, with most migrant populations not recognized, although the details are quite complex as there are even indigenous Thais without nationality, and migrant workers have since been largely regularized (albeit with due foreign pressure).  Therefore, the census population even does not represent the total figure.  As for Thai nationals and legal permanent residents (very few) registering the city as their hometown, the provincial authority logged population was 107,944 in 2010, modestly rising to 119,530 by 2019.<ref name=\"TDD\"/> As with the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Region]], registered population figure issued by a different agency than the National Statistics Office hardly captures the scope of the urban transformation that has occurred over the time span \u2013 the economy is dependent on the large numbers of casual Thai workers who work in the city yet remain registered in their hometowns, there is much employment turnover and to and from the capital, as well as seasonal farm migration.  Migrant workers from neighboring nations, and many long-term [[expatriate]]s who reside in the city as retirees or self-employed or contracted are traditionally not counted.  There has never been a reliably published figure for total population, but its thought to be quite large (on the order of half a million people) given the ubiquity and sheer number of migrant workers taking place of Thai labor.  Pattaya city excludes some nearby areas like [[Nong Prue]] (73,901 people in 2010 census) and Huay Yai.\n\nPattaya additionally has massive population inflow from short stay tourism, with its 2000 hotels and 136,000 rooms available as of 2015.<ref>{{cite news | newspaper=Bangkok Post | url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/archive/chinese-put-squeeze-on-pattaya-hotels/622728 | title=Chinese put squeeze on Pattaya's hotels  | date=15 July 2015 | accessdate=12 March 2018 |url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\nDue to the tourist industry, many people from the north-east (known as [[Isan]], the poorest region of Thailand) have come to work in Pattaya, and are counted for census purposes in their hometowns. A majority of these northeast workers fulfill positions in the Go-Go bar industry, the pay they can earn is far more than that in their home region of Isaan.\n\nA growing community of foreign [[Pensioner|retirees]] live in Pattaya. Thailand immigration has a special visa category for foreigners over age 50 who wish to retire in Thailand. Pattaya is attractive to many retirees from other countries not only because of its climate and lifestyle, but also because living costs are lower than in many countries.{{citation needed|date=February 2020 }}\n{{wide image|File:Pattaya Panorama.jpg|1024px|align-cap=center|Pattaya from Pratumnak Hill}}\n\n== Physical geography ==\n[[File:AmphoePattaya 2004.PNG|thumb|left|Mueang Pattaya, Bang Lamung District]]\n\nPattaya, on the Gulf of Thailand, is approximately {{convert|160|km}} south of the city of Bangkok in [[Bang Lamung District]], [[Chonburi Province]].\n\nThe city of Pattaya is a special municipal area which covers the whole ''tambon'' [[Nong Prue]] (Nongprue) and [[Na Kluea]] (Naklua) and parts of [[Huai Yai]] and [[Nong Pla Lai]].  [[Bang Lamung township]] which forms the northern border of Pattaya covers parts of the ''tambon'' Bang Lamung (Banglamung), [[Nong Pla Lai]] and [[Takhian Tia]]. Bang Sali is on the southern border of Pattaya.\n\n\"Greater Pattaya\" occupies most of the coastline of Banglamung (one of the eleven districts that make up Chonburi Province). It is divided into a larger northern section which spans the areas to the east of Naklua Beach (the most northern beach) and Pattaya Beach (the main beach) plus Pratamnak Hill (often called \"Buddha Hill\" because of the temples on top of the hill) headland immediately south of Pattaya Beach, and a smaller southern section covering the area to the east of Jomtien Beach (directly south of Pratamnak Hill).\n\n=== Beaches and islands ===\n{{wide image|Pattaya_Bay_Panorama.jpg|1050px|align-cap=center|The Pattaya Bay area is one of Asia's largest beach resorts and the second most visited city in Thailand, after Bangkok.

Pattaya Beach lies parallel to the city centre, and runs from Pattaya Nuea south to [[Walking Street, Pattaya|Walking Street]], about 2.7&nbsp;km long. The beach, which used to be 35&nbsp;m wide, suffers from erosion and in some places was reduced to a width of only two to three meters. A 429 million [[Thai baht|baht]] beach restoration scheme was implemented in 2018. It will take 360,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup> of sand from Ko Rang Kwian offshore to increase the beach width to 50&nbsp;m.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Pupattanapong |first1=Chaiyot |title=Restored Pattaya beach lures tourists |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1516086/restored-pattaya-beach-lures-tourists |accessdate=5 August 2018 |work=Bangkok Post |date=5 August 2018}}</ref> Without intervention Pattaya will likely see its beaches disappear in roughly ten years according to [[Chulalongkorn University]] researchers. Within a month of the completion of the restoration of the first 400&nbsp;m of Pattaya Beach, the work was \"seriously damaged\" by flooding. The beach is the first in the country to use imported sand to compensate for coastal erosion.

Pattaya Park and Pattaya tower are at the south end of Pratumnak and the Pattaya Exhibition And Convention Hall (P.E.A.C.H), is positioned at the north end of Pratumnak. In recent years, Pratumnak has gained in popularity because of its more natural environment, nicer beaches, and its convenient location between Jomtien and Pattaya city.\n\n[[Jomtien]] is divided from Pattaya by Thepprasit Road, the southern route into Pattaya city. It consists of high-rise condominiums, beach side hotels, bungalow complexes, shops, bars, and restaurants.\n\n[[File:US Navy 020528-N-0401E-003 Cobra Gold - amphibious landing.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Ko Khram]]'s shore and adjacent islets during a combined amphibious landing force exercise [[Cobra Gold]].]]\nOffshore islands include three \"near islands\": [[Ko Lan]] (main island), [[Ko Lan|Ko Sak]], and [[Ko Lan|Ko Krok]], {{convert|7|km}} from the shore of Pattaya.

City officials blamed the incident on broken pumps and Pattaya's poorly maintained sewage-treatment plant. The environmental ministry declared it would step up enforcement of pollution laws and push Pattaya for better wastewater-treatment efficiency. According to the ministry, Pattaya has 1,047 identified sources of sewage and garbage pollution, the number increasing as the city grows.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Homklin|first1=Jetsada|title=Pattaya sewage problem in government crosshairs| url=http://www.pattayamail.com/news/pattaya-sewage-problem-government-crosshairs-186138|accessdate=26 April 2018|work=Pattaya Mail|date=2017-09-16}}</ref> The sea water along central Pattaya beaches is of poor quality even in the absence of sewage spills and \"could endanger human and marine life\", the regional environmental office has said. They deemed sea water quality near central Pattaya beaches as \"poor\" and deteriorating. They judged water quality near Na Klua in North Pattaya, South Pattaya, Ko Lan, and Jomtien Beach as \"fairly good\". The city has considered expanding two water management plants to increase capacity for better treatment of wastewater prior to discharge into the ocean. The water treatment plant in Soi Wat Nongyai after expansion would be able to treat around 130,000 cubic metres of waste water a day, up from 80,000 cubic metres at present.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pupattanapong|first1=Chaiyot|title=Pattaya sea water quality gets 'poor' grade|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1015553/pattaya-sea-water-quality-gets-poor-grade|accessdate=26 April 2018|work=Bangkok Post|date=2016-06-21}}</ref> The expansion was never implemented.<ref name=BP-20181123/>\n\nIn November 2018, the Pattaya City Council approved 188 million [[Thai baht|baht]] for the repair of its six wastewater treatment plants. Installed in 2000, the plants can accommodate 65,000 m<sup>3</sup> of wastewater per day. More than a third of plant equipment was found to be 40\u201350 percent worn out. The system treats waste from a 36&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> portion of Pattaya, or 68 percent of its urban area. Earlier plans to increase treatment capacity to 135,000 m<sup>3</sup> were never implemented and existing plants were allowed to fall into disrepair. Pattaya uses more than 200,000 m<sup>3</sup> of water a day, but claims to only discharge about 70,000 m<sup>3</sup> a day. The discrepancy is unexplained. Once treated, there are no tests to measure water quality before it is dumped back into the sea, which may account for foul water discharges.<ref name=BP-20181123>{{cite news |last1=Pupattanapong |first1=Chaiyot |title=Wastewater stations to get B188m |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1580522/wastewater-stations-to-get-b188m |accessdate=2018-11-26 |work=Bangkok Post |date=2018-11-23}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Hilton Pattaya Pool dusk view 201801.jpg|thumb|Hotel overlooking Pattaya Bay]]\n\nPattaya is at the center of Thailand's [[Eastern Economic Corridor]] (EEC). Investments totaling more than 1.5 trillion baht (US$45 billion) are flowing into EEC infrastructure projects: airports, deep-sea ports, high-speed railways, autoroutes. The result will enhance Pattaya's accessibility. According to the [[Thai Chamber of Commerce]] (TCC) the EEC investments, the [[U-Tapao International Airport]] and the [[High-speed rail in Thailand|high-speed train]] that will link three major airports to Pattaya, will make Pattaya the heart of the eastern region. The TCC view is that, \"Plenty of attractions...will lure lots more foreign and domestic tourists in the future.\" Better connectivity will reduce both the cost and time to travel to Pattaya, with the TCC estimating the number of tourists visiting the EEC region to rise to 46.7 million over the next few years, one and half times the current 29.8 million visitors. Pattaya projects include developing a tram in the city and building a bigger cruise terminal, as well as new tourist attractions: a water park, an ice dome, cultural markets, Thai boxing gyms, theaters, and conference halls. All are under development. \"We aimed to get rid of the previous [seedy] image of Pattaya and try to promote a new image to show that Pattaya is a place for everyone with diversity of new tourist attractions,\" said an official of the [[Tourism Authority of Thailand]] (TAT). He said that the EEC would make Pattaya more competitive compared with other popular Thai beach destinations such as [[Phuket Province|Phuket]] and [[Ko Samui]], with cheaper transport costs.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Phoonphongphiphat |first1=Apornrath |title=Thai businesses to revitalize Pattaya tourism via economic zone |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-Trends/Thai-businesses-to-revitalize-Pattaya-tourism-via-economic-zone |accessdate=7 August 2018 |work=Nikkei Asian Review |date=6 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pattaya-11.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Shopping mall in Pattaya]]\n[[File:Pattaya in daytime June 2017.jpg|thumb|right|Central Pattaya]]\nFourteen million visitors in 2018 contributed 239 billion [[Thai baht|baht]] to the city's treasury.
