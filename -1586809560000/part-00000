Eastings are on the top/bottom. Northings are on the right/left.]]\n'''Irish Transverse Mercator''' ('''ITM''') is the [[geographic coordinate system]] for Ireland. It was implemented jointly by the [[Ordnance Survey Ireland]] (OSi) and the [[Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland]] (OSNI) in 2001. The name is derived from the [[Transverse Mercator]] projection it uses and the fact that it is optimised for the island of Ireland.\n\n==History==\nThe older [[Irish grid reference system]] required GPS measurements to be \"translated\" (using [[Coordinate system#Transformations|co-ordinate transformations]]). The more precise the GPS measurements were, the more the translation process introduced inaccuracies.\n\nWhile the existing [[Universal Transverse Mercator|UTM]] co-ordinate system partly fulfilled the requirement for direct GPS compatibility it had some drawbacks, including varying levels of distortion across the island due to the central meridian being at the west coast of Ireland.\n\nThe new system needed to satisfy various criteria: GPS compatibility, map distortion for the whole island of Ireland had to be minimal, it was to be [[Map projection#Conformal|conformal]] and backward compatible with existing mapping. A customised Transverse Mercator projection was chosen.\n\nITM and the older more established Irish Grid will (initially at least) be used in parallel. As a result ITM coordinates had to be obviously different so users would not confuse the two. This was done by shifting the ITM false origin further into the Atlantic and thereby creating substantially different co-ordinate numbers for any given location.\n\nWhile OSi and OSNI intend to supply map information in the older Irish Grid format into the future, the Irish Institution of Surveyors has recommended that ITM be adopted as soon as possible as the preferred official co-ordinate system for Ireland.\n\n==Examples==\n\nAn ITM co-ordinate is generally given as a pair of two six-digit numbers (excluding any digits behind a [[decimal point]] which may be used in very precise surveying). The first number is always the [[easting]] and the second is the [[northing]]. The easting and northing are in metres from the false [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]].\n\nThe ITM co-ordinate for the [[Spire of Dublin]] on [[O'Connell Street]] is:\n\n:715830, 734697\n\nThe first figure is the easting and means that the location is 715,830 metres east from the false origin (along the [[X axis]]). The second figure is the northing and puts the location 734,697 metres north of the false origin (along the [[Y axis]])\n\nThe equivalent Irish Grid co-ordinate for the same location is:\n\n:315904, 234671\n\nThe Spire of Dublin example provides a [[Position fixing|fix]] for a location that is accurate to 1 metre. With ITM it is possible to give a more accurate co-ordinate for a given location by using a decimal point after the initial six figure easting and northing.\n\nThe ITM co-ordinate for the passive GPS station at the OSi office is:\n\n:E 709885.081m, N 736167.699m\n\nThis ITM co-ordinate has three digits behind the decimal point which gives a fix for a location with millimetre accuracy. Also notice how the easting in this example is indicated with an \u201cE\u201d and likewise an \u201cN\u201d for the northing. The fact that the co-ordinate is in metres is indicated by the lowercase m.\n\nWith ITM there is no provision for using [[Myriad (unit of area)|myriad]] letters and truncated coordinates as there is with the Irish Grid.\nEvery co-ordinate must be given with at least a six-digit easting and northing from the false origin.\n\n==Comparison of ITM, Irish Grid and UTM==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!

Massage techniques are commonly applied with hands, fingers, [[elbow]]s, [[knee]]s, [[forearm]]s, feet, or a device. The purpose of massage is generally for the treatment of body stress or pain. A person who was [[professionally]] trained to give massages was traditionally known as a '''masseur''' (male) or a '''masseuse''' (female), but those titles are outmoded{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}, and carry some negative connotations. In the United States, the title '''massage therapist''' has been recognized as a business norm for those who have been professionally trained to give massages.\n\nIn professional settings, clients are treated while lying on a [[massage table]], sitting in a [[massage chair]], or lying on a mat on the floor. In amateur settings, a general purpose surface like a bed or the floor is more common. ''Aquatic'' massage and [[Bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]] is performed with recipients submersed or floating in a warm-water [[therapy]] pool.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word comes from the French ''massage'' \"friction of kneading\", which, in turn, comes from the Arabic word \u0645\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0651 ''massa'' meaning \"to touch, feel\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/massage|title=Definition of MASSAGE | date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}<br>{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/massage|title=the definition of massage | date=|website=www.dictionary.com}}\n<br>{{cite web|url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=massage|title=The American Heritage Dictionary entry: massage|last=Company|first=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing|date=|website=www.ahdictionary.com}} \n</ref>\n\nOthers claim an origin from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''amassar'' \"knead\", from the [[Latin]] ''[[wiktionary:massa#Latin|massa]]'' meaning \"mass, dough\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=massage |title=Online Etymology Dictionary, massage |publisher=Etymonline.com |access-date=26 February 2013}}</ref> from the [[Greek language|Greek]] verb [[wiktionary:\u03bc\u03ac\u03c3\u03c3\u03c9|\u03bc\u03ac\u03c3\u03c3\u03c9]] (''mass\u014d'') \"to handle, touch, to work with the hands, to knead dough\".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dma%2Fssw \u03bc\u03ac\u03c3\u03c3\u03c9], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> In distinction the ancient [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word for massage was ''[[wiktionary:anatripsis|anatripsis]]'',<ref name=Noah>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=KEyOi-KN0rgC&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2&dq=massage+etymology| title = The History of Massage: An Illustrated Survey from Around the World | vauthors = Calvert R | publisher = Healing Arts Press| date = 1 April 2002}}</ref> and the Latin was ''[[wiktionary:frictio|frictio]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal |last=Iorio |first=Silvia |last2=Gazzaniga |first2=Valentina |last3=Marinozz i|first3=Silvia | name-list-format = vanc |date=2018-08-30|title=Healing bodies: the ancient origins of massages and Roman practices |url= http://mattioli1885journals.com/index.php/MedHistor/article/view/7473 |journal=Medicina Historica |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=58\u201362 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Thai massage.jpg|thumb|right|Drawings of [[acupressure]] points on [[Sen line]]s at [[Wat Pho]] temple in [[Thailand]]]]\n\n=== Ancient times ===\nArchaeological evidence of massage has been found in many ancient civilizations including [[China]], [[India]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], [[Greece]], and [[Mesopotamia]].\n\nBC 2330: The Tomb of Akmanthor<ref>{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Akmanthor.jpg |title=File:Akmanthor.jpg&nbsp;\u2014 Wikimedia Commons |publisher=Commons.wikimedia.org |access-date=15 August 2012}}</ref> (also known as \"The Tomb of the Physician\") in [[Saqqara]], Egypt, depicts two men having work done on their feet and hands, possibly massage.\n[[File:Akmanthor.jpg|thumb|Akmanthor]]\n\nBC 722-481: ''[[Huangdi Neijing]]'' is composed during the Chinese [[Spring and Autumn period]].

Later in the 11th century copies were translated back into Latin, and again in the 15th and 16th centuries, when they helped enlighten European scholars as to the achievements of the Ancient Greeks. This renewal of the Galenic tradition during the Renaissance played a very important part in the rise of modern science.\n\nOne of the greatest Persian medics was [[Avicenna]], also known as Ibn Sina, who lived from 980AD to 1037AD. His works included a comprehensive collection and systematisation of the fragmentary and unorganised Greco-Roman medical literature that had been translated Arabic by that time, augmented by notes from his own experiences. One of his books, ''Al-Q\u0101n\u016bn f\u012b a\u1e6d-\u1e6cibb'' (The Canon of Medicine) has been called the most famous single book in the history of medicine in both East and West. Avicenna excelled in the logical assessment of conditions and comparison of symptoms and took special note of analgesics and their proper use as well as other methods of relieving pain, including massage.\n\nAD 1150: Evidence of massage abortion, involving the application of pressure to the pregnant [[abdomen]], can be found in one of the [[bas relief]]s decorating the temple of [[Angkor Wat]] in [[Cambodia]]. It depicts a [[demon]] performing such an abortion upon a woman who has been sent to the [[underworld]].

A typical commercial massage table has an easily cleaned, heavily padded surface, and a horseshoe-shaped head support that allows the client to breathe easily while lying face down and can be stationary or portable, while home versions are often lighter weight or designed to fold away easily. An [[orthopedic pillow]] or bolster can be used to correct body positioning.\n\nErgonomic chairs serve a similar function as a massage table. Chairs may be either stationary or portable models. Massage chairs are easier to transport than massage tables, and recipients do not need to disrobe to receive a chair massage. Due to these two factors, chair massage is often performed in settings such as corporate offices, outdoor festivals, shopping malls, and other public locations.\n\n=== Warm-water therapy pools ===\nTemperature-controlled warm-water therapy pools are used to perform aquatic bodywork.<ref name=Osinski2011>Osinski, A. 2011.

These tables differ from a Vichy shower in that the client usually stays dry. Two common types are one in which the client lies on a waterbed-like mattress which contains warm water and jets of water and air bubbles and one in which the client lies on a foam pad and is covered by a plastic sheet and is then sprayed by jets of warm water, similar to a Vichy shower.<ref name=\"amiaspa\">{{cite web|url=http://www.circlesoflight.com/alternative/water-jet-machine.html |title=Using a Water Massage Machine |publisher=Circlesoflight.com |date=16 March 2007 |access-date=26 February 2013}}</ref> The first type is sometimes seen available for use in malls and shopping centers for a small fee.\n\n=== Vichy showers ===\nA [[Vichy shower]] is a form of hydrotherapy which uses a series of shower nozzles which spray large quantities of water over the client while they lie in a shallow wet bed, similar to a massage table, but with drainage for the water. The nozzles may usually be adjusted for height, direction, and temperature to suit the client's needs.\n\n=== Cremes, lotions, gels, and oils ===\nMany different types of massage cremes, lotions, gels, and oils are used to lubricate and moisturize the skin and reduce the friction between skin (hands of technician and client).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Capellini|first1=Steve|last2=Welden|first2=Michel Van|title=Massage For Dummies|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9780470642757|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KgFnbJ7E90IC&pg=PA20|date=2010-05-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Massage tools ===\nThese instruments or devices are sometimes used during massages.  Some tools are for use by individuals, others by the therapist.\n\n====Tools used by massage therapists====\nInstrument-assisted soft-tissue massage can deploy stainless-steel devices to manipulate tissue in a way that augments hands-on work. \n\nA body rock is a serpentine-shaped tool, usually carved out of stone. It is used to amplify the therapist's strength and focus pressure on certain areas. It can be used directly on the skin with a lubricant such as oil or corn starch or directly over clothing.\n\n[[Bamboo massage|Bamboo]] and [[rosewood]] tools are also commonly used. They originate from practices in southeast Asia, Thailand, Cambodia, and Burma.  Some of them may be heated, oiled, or wrapped in cloth.\n\n====Tools used by both individuals and massagers====\nHand-held battery-operated massaging and vibrating instruments are available, including devices for massaging the scalp following a [[haircut]].\n\nVibrating massage pads come in a range of sizes, some with the option of heating.\n\nVibrating [[massage chair]]s can provide an alternative for therapy at home.\n\nThere is a widespread market in [[erotic massage]] instruments, including electric [[dildos]] and [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrators]] such as the [[massage wand]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Trout|first1=Christopher|title=The 46-year-old sex toy Hitachi won't talk about|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/08/27/history-of-the-hitachi-magic-wand/|accessdate=30 August 2014|work=[[Engadget]]|date=28 August 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827183517/http://www.engadget.com/2014/08/27/history-of-the-hitachi-magic-wand/|archivedate=27 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Medical and therapeutic use ==\nThe main professionals that provide therapeutic massage are massage therapists, [[athletic trainer]]s, [[Physical therapy|physical therapists]] and practitioners of many [[traditional Chinese medicine|traditional Chinese and other eastern medicines]].

Massage therapists may obtain a certification with one of various associations operating. There is the Professional Association of Specialized Massage Therapists of Quebec, also named Mon R\u00e9seau Plus, which represents 6,300 massage therapists (including orthotherapists, naturotherapists and others), the Quebec Federation of massage therapists (FMQ), and the Association qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise des th\u00e9rapeutes naturels; however, none of these are regulated by provincial law.\n\nCanadian educational institutions are undergoing a formal accreditation process through the Canadian Massage Therapy Council for Accreditation (CMTCA).\n\n==== China ====\nMost types of massage, with the exception of some [[traditional Chinese medicine]] are not regulated in China. Although illegal in China, some of the smaller businesses are fronts for prostitution. J.K., anti-prostitution operation has established sting operations to combat the situation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gochina.about.com/od/tripplanning/a/prostitution.htm |title=About.com&nbsp;\u2014 Traveler Warning: Prostitution in China |publisher=Gochina.about.com |date=10 April 2012 |access-date=26 February 2013}}</ref> These are called [[Prostitution in China#Types and venues|falangmei]] (\u53d1\u5eca\u59b9 \"hairdressing salon sisters\").\n\n==== France ====\nFrance requires three years of study and two final exams in order to apply for a license.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=7F4C787EF6BFD7F0C51286E82C217E0F.tpdjo09v_1?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000020567935&categorieLien=id |title=D\u00e9cret n\u00b0 2009-494 du 29 avril 2009 relatif aux \u00e9tudes pr\u00e9paratoires et au dipl\u00f4me d'Etat de masseur-kin\u00e9sith\u00e9rapeute |language=fr |publisher=Legifrance |date= |access-date=26 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n==== Germany ====\nIn Germany massage is regulated by the government on a federal and national level.  Only someone who has completed 3,200 hours of training (theoretical and practical) can use the professional title \"Masseur und Medizinischer Bademeister\" or Medical Masseur and Spa Therapist.  This person can prolong his training depending on the length of professional experience to a Physiotherapist (1 year to 18 months additional training).  The Masseur is trained in Classical Massage, Myofascial Massage, Exercise and Movement Therapy.  During the training they will study: Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology, Gynecology, Podiatry, Psychiatry, Psychology, Surgery, and probably most importantly Dermiatry and Orthopedics.  They are trained in [[Electrotherapy]], and Hydrotherapy.  Hydrotherapy includes: Kneipp, Wraps, underwater Massage, therapeutic washing, Sauna and Steambath.  A small part of their training will include special forms of massage which are decided by the local college, for example: Foot reflex zone massage, Thai Massage etc.  Finally a graduate is allowed to treat patients under the direction of a doctor.  He is regulated by the professional body which regulates Physiotherapists.  This includes the restriction on advertising and oath of confidentiality to clients.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n==== India ====\nIn India, massage therapy is licensed by The Department of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) under the [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (India)]] in March 1995. Massage therapy is based on Ayurveda, the ancient medicinal system that evolved around 600 BC. In [[ayurveda]], massage is part of a set of holistic medicinal practices, contrary to the independent massage system popular in some other systems. In Siddha, Tamil traditional medicine from south India, massage is termed as \"Thokkanam\" and is classified in to nine types, each for specific variety of disease.\n\n==== Japan ====\n[[File:Adolfo Farsari - Blind Shampoonier.JPG|thumb|Traditional Japanese blind massage]]\n{{see also|ja:\u3042\u3093\u6469\u30de\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u30b8\u6307\u5727\u5e2b|Anma}}\n\nIn Japan, [[shiatsu]] is regulated but oil massage and [[Thai massage]] are not.

There are two levels of registration with Massage New Zealand, the professional body for massage therapists within New Zealand, although neither of these levels are government recognised.  Registration at the Certified Massage Therapist level denotes competency in the practice of relaxation massage.  Registration at the Remedial massage therapist denotes competency in the practice of remedial or orthopedic massage.  Both levels of registration are defined by agreed minimum competencies and minimum hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.massagenewzealand.org.nz/Site/membership/levels.aspx |title=Levels of Membership |publisher=Massage New Zealand |access-date=27 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== South Africa ====\nIn South Africa, massage is regulated, but enforcement is poor.  The minimum legal requirement to be able to practice as a professional massage therapist is a 2-year diploma in Therapeutic Massage and registration with The Allied Health Professions Council of SA (AHPCSA). The 2 year qualification includes 240 credits, about 80 case studies, and about 100 hours community service.\n\n==== South Korea ====\nIn [[South Korea]],  blind and visually impaired people can become licensed masseurs.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7699114.stm | work=BBC News | title=Blind S Korea masseurs win case | date=30 October 2008 | access-date=5 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n==== Thailand ====\nIn [[Thailand]], [[Thai massage]] is officially listed as one of the branches of [[traditional Thai medicine]], recognized and regulated by the government.

Massage techniques are commonly applied with hands, fingers, [[elbow]]s, [[knee]]s, [[forearm]]s, feet, or a device. The purpose of massage is generally for the treatment of body stress or pain. A person who was [[professionally]] trained to give massages was traditionally known as a '''masseur''' (male) or a '''masseuse''' (female), but those titles are outmoded{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}, and carry some negative connotations. In the United States, the title '''massage therapist''' has been recognized as a business norm for those who have been professionally trained to give massages.\n\nIn professional settings, clients are treated while lying on a [[massage table]], sitting in a [[massage chair]], or lying on a mat on the floor.

Later in the 11th century copies were translated back into Latin, and again in the 15th and 16th centuries, when they helped enlighten European scholars as to the achievements of the Ancient Greeks. This renewal of the Galenic tradition during the Renaissance played a very important part in the rise of modern science.\n\nOne of the greatest Persian medics was [[Avicenna]], also known as Ibn Sina, who lived from 980AD to 1037AD. His works included a comprehensive collection and systematisation of the fragmentary and unorganised Greco-Roman medical literature that had been translated Arabic by that time, augmented by notes from his own experiences. One of his books, ''Al-Q\u0101n\u016bn f\u012b a\u1e6d-\u1e6cibb'' (The Canon of Medicine) has been called the most famous single book in the history of medicine in both East and West. Avicenna excelled in the logical assessment of conditions and comparison of symptoms and took special note of analgesics and their proper use as well as other methods of relieving pain, including massage.\n\nAD 1150: Evidence of massage abortion, involving the application of pressure to the pregnant [[abdomen]], can be found in one of the [[bas relief]]s decorating the temple of [[Angkor Wat]] in [[Cambodia]].

A typical commercial massage table has an easily cleaned, heavily padded surface, and a horseshoe-shaped head support that allows the client to breathe easily while lying face down and can be stationary or portable, while home versions are often lighter weight or designed to fold away easily. An [[orthopedic pillow]] or bolster can be used to correct body positioning.\n\nErgonomic chairs serve a similar function as a massage table. Chairs may be either stationary or portable models. Massage chairs are easier to transport than massage tables, and recipients do not need to disrobe to receive a chair massage. Due to these two factors, chair massage is often performed in settings such as corporate offices, outdoor festivals, shopping malls, and other public locations.\n\n=== Warm-water therapy pools ===\nTemperature-controlled warm-water therapy pools are used to perform aquatic bodywork.<ref name=Osinski2011>Osinski, A. 2011.

These tables differ from a Vichy shower in that the client usually stays dry. Two common types are one in which the client lies on a waterbed-like mattress which contains warm water and jets of water and air bubbles and one in which the client lies on a foam pad and is covered by a plastic sheet and is then sprayed by jets of warm water, similar to a Vichy shower.<ref name=\"amiaspa\">{{cite web|url=http://www.circlesoflight.com/alternative/water-jet-machine.html |title=Using a Water Massage Machine |publisher=Circlesoflight.com |date=16 March 2007 |access-date=26 February 2013}}</ref> The first type is sometimes seen available for use in malls and shopping centers for a small fee.\n\n=== Vichy showers ===\nA [[Vichy shower]] is a form of hydrotherapy which uses a series of shower nozzles which spray large quantities of water over the client while they lie in a shallow wet bed, similar to a massage table, but with drainage for the water. The nozzles may usually be adjusted for height, direction, and temperature to suit the client's needs.\n\n=== Cremes, lotions, gels, and oils ===\nMany different types of massage cremes, lotions, gels, and oils are used to lubricate and moisturize the skin and reduce the friction between skin (hands of technician and client).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Capellini|first1=Steve|last2=Welden|first2=Michel Van|title=Massage For Dummies|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9780470642757|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KgFnbJ7E90IC&pg=PA20|date=2010-05-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Massage tools ===\nThese instruments or devices are sometimes used during massages.  Some tools are for use by individuals, others by the therapist.\n\n====Tools used by massage therapists====\nInstrument-assisted soft-tissue massage can deploy stainless-steel devices to manipulate tissue in a way that augments hands-on work. \n\nA body rock is a serpentine-shaped tool, usually carved out of stone. It is used to amplify the therapist's strength and focus pressure on certain areas. It can be used directly on the skin with a lubricant such as oil or corn starch or directly over clothing.\n\n[[Bamboo massage|Bamboo]] and [[rosewood]] tools are also commonly used. They originate from practices in southeast Asia, Thailand, Cambodia, and Burma.  Some of them may be heated, oiled, or wrapped in cloth.\n\n====Tools used by both individuals and massagers====\nHand-held battery-operated massaging and vibrating instruments are available, including devices for massaging the scalp following a [[haircut]].\n\nVibrating massage pads come in a range of sizes, some with the option of heating.\n\nVibrating [[massage chair]]s can provide an alternative for therapy at home.\n\nThere is a widespread market in [[erotic massage]] instruments, including electric [[dildos]] and [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrators]] such as the [[massage wand]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Trout|first1=Christopher|title=The 46-year-old sex toy Hitachi won't talk about|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/08/27/history-of-the-hitachi-magic-wand/|accessdate=30 August 2014|work=[[Engadget]]|date=28 August 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827183517/http://www.engadget.com/2014/08/27/history-of-the-hitachi-magic-wand/|archivedate=27 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Medical and therapeutic use ==\nThe main professionals that provide therapeutic massage are massage therapists, [[athletic trainer]]s, [[Physical therapy|physical therapists]] and practitioners of many [[traditional Chinese medicine|traditional Chinese and other eastern medicines]]. Massage practitioners work in a variety of medical settings and may travel to private residences or businesses.<ref name=nccam/> [[Contraindication]]s to massage include [[deep vein thrombosis]], [[bleeding disorders]] or taking blood thinners such as [[Warfarin]], damaged blood vessels, weakened bones from [[cancer]], [[osteoporosis]], or [[fractures]], and [[fever]].<ref name=nccam/>\n\n=== Practitioner associations and official recognition of professionals ===\nThe US based National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine recognizes over eighty different massage techniques.<ref name=\"nccam\"/> The most cited reasons for introducing massage as therapy have been client demand and perceived clinical effectiveness.<ref name=\"policy\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Myklebust M, Iler J | title = Policy for therapeutic massage in an academic health center: a model for standard policy development | journal = Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 471\u20135 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17532742 | doi = 10.1089/acm.2007.6323 | hdl = 2027.42/63197 | url = https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/63197/1/acm.2007.6323.pdf }}</ref>\n\n=== Associated methods ===\nMany types of practices are associated with massage and include [[Bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]], [[manual therapy]], [[energy medicine]], neural mobilization and [[breathwork]]. Other names for massage and related practices include hands-on work, body/somatic therapy, and somatic movement education. Body-mind integration techniques stress self-awareness and movement over physical manipulations by a practitioner. Therapies related to movement awareness/education are closer to [[Dance therapy|dance and movement therapies]].

Only someone who has completed 3,200 hours of training (theoretical and practical) can use the professional title \"Masseur und Medizinischer Bademeister\" or Medical Masseur and Spa Therapist.  This person can prolong his training depending on the length of professional experience to a Physiotherapist (1 year to 18 months additional training).  The Masseur is trained in Classical Massage, Myofascial Massage, Exercise and Movement Therapy.  During the training they will study: Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology, Gynecology, Podiatry, Psychiatry, Psychology, Surgery, and probably most importantly Dermiatry and Orthopedics.  They are trained in [[Electrotherapy]], and Hydrotherapy.  Hydrotherapy includes: Kneipp, Wraps, underwater Massage, therapeutic washing, Sauna and Steambath.  A small part of their training will include special forms of massage which are decided by the local college, for example: Foot reflex zone massage, Thai Massage etc.  Finally a graduate is allowed to treat patients under the direction of a doctor.  He is regulated by the professional body which regulates Physiotherapists.  This includes the restriction on advertising and oath of confidentiality to clients.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n==== India ====\nIn India, massage therapy is licensed by The Department of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) under the [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (India)]] in March 1995. Massage therapy is based on Ayurveda, the ancient medicinal system that evolved around 600 BC. In [[ayurveda]], massage is part of a set of holistic medicinal practices, contrary to the independent massage system popular in some other systems. In Siddha, Tamil traditional medicine from south India, massage is termed as \"Thokkanam\" and is classified in to nine types, each for specific variety of disease.\n\n==== Japan ====\n[[File:Adolfo Farsari - Blind Shampoonier.JPG|thumb|Traditional Japanese blind massage]]\n{{see also|ja:\u3042\u3093\u6469\u30de\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u30b8\u6307\u5727\u5e2b|Anma}}\n\nIn Japan, [[shiatsu]] is regulated but oil massage and [[Thai massage]] are not.

These businesses are often confined to a specific area of the city, such as the [[Zona Norte (Tijuana)|Zona Norte]] in [[Tijuana]].\n\n==== New Zealand ====\nIn New Zealand, massage is unregulated.  There are two levels of registration with Massage New Zealand, the professional body for massage therapists within New Zealand, although neither of these levels are government recognised.  Registration at the Certified Massage Therapist level denotes competency in the practice of relaxation massage.  Registration at the Remedial massage therapist denotes competency in the practice of remedial or orthopedic massage.

It was produced by [[Grant Heslov]], Affleck and [[George Clooney]].\n\n''Argo'' was praised for the acting (particularly Arkin and Goodman's), Affleck's direction, Terrio's screenplay, the editing, and Desplat's score. The film received seven nominations at the [[85th Academy Awards]] and won three, for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]]. The film also earned five [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations: it won [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and was nominated for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture]] for Alan Arkin. It won [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture|Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture]] at the [[19th Screen Actors Guild Awards]], and Arkin was nominated for [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role|Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role]]. It also won [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Editing|Best Editing]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Direction|Best Director]] at the [[66th British Academy Film Awards]], and [[Hochi Film Award|37th Hochi Film Award]] for Best International Picture.\n\nDespite its praise, ''Argo'' has been criticized for some specific inaccuracies, in particular for minimizing the role of the Canadian embassy in the rescue, for falsely showing that the Americans were turned away by the British and New Zealand embassies, and for exaggerating the danger the group faced during events preceding their escape from the country.\n\n== Plot ==\nOn November 4, 1979, Iranian [[Islamism|Islamists]] storm the [[Embassy of the United States, Tehran|United States embassy in Tehran]] in retaliation for President [[Jimmy Carter]] giving the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]] asylum in the U.S. during the [[Iranian Revolution]]. Sixty of the embassy staff are taken as hostages, but six avoid capture and are sheltered in the home of Canadian ambassador [[Kenneth D. Taylor|Ken Taylor]]. With the escapees' situation kept secret, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] begins to explore options for [[Extraction (military)|exfiltrating]] them from Iran. [[Tony Mendez]], a U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] exfiltration specialist, is brought in for a consultation. He criticizes the proposals but is at a loss when asked for an alternative. While on the phone with his son, he is inspired by watching [[Battle for the Planet of the Apes|''Battle for the Planet of the Apes'']] and begins plans for creating a cover story for the escapees: that they are Canadian filmmakers who are in Iran scouting exotic locations for a science-fiction film.\n\nMendez contacts [[John Chambers (make-up artist)|John Chambers]], a Hollywood make-up artist who had previously worked for the CIA. Chambers puts Mendez in touch with film producer Lester Siegel. Together, they set up a phony film production company, publicize their plans, and successfully establish the pretense of developing ''Argo'', a \"science fantasy adventure\" in the style of [[Star Wars (film)|''Star Wars'']], to lend credibility to the cover story. Meanwhile, the escapees grow restless. The revolutionaries reassemble embassy photographs shredded before the takeover and finally realize that some personnel are unaccounted for.\n\nPosing as a producer for ''Argo'', Mendez enters Iran under the alias Kevin Harkins and meets with the six escapees. He provides them with [[Canadian passports]] and fake identities. Although afraid to trust Mendez's scheme, they reluctantly go along, knowing that he is risking his own life too. A scouting visit to the [[Grand Bazaar, Tehran|bazaar]] to maintain their cover story takes a bad turn when they are harassed by a hostile shopkeeper, but their Iranian culture contact hustles them away from the hostile crowd.\n\nMendez is told that the operation has been canceled to avoid conflicting with a [[Operation Eagle Claw|planned military rescue of the hostages]]. He pushes ahead anyway, forcing his boss Jack O'Donnell to hastily re-obtain authorization for the mission and confirm their tickets on a [[Swissair]] flight. Tensions rise at the airport, where the escapees' ticket reservations are confirmed at the last minute, and the head guard's call to the fake production company in Hollywood is answered only at the last second. The group boards the airliner, which takes off just as the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guards]] at the airport are informed of the ruse and try to stop them.\n\nTo protect the hostages remaining in Tehran from retaliation, all U.S. involvement in the rescue is suppressed, and full credit is given to the Canadian government and its ambassador (who shuts down the embassy and leaves Iran with his wife as the operation is underway). The ambassador's Iranian housekeeper, who had known about the Americans and lied to the revolutionaries to protect them, escapes to [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]]. Mendez is awarded the [[Intelligence Star]], but due to the mission's classified nature, he receives the medal in secret and has to return it afterward. The award is restored to him after the [[Canadian Caper]] is declassified in 1997.\n<br />\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Ben Affleck by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg|thumb|Actor, producer, and director Ben Affleck.]]\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ben Affleck]] as [[Tony Mendez]]\n* [[Bryan Cranston]] as Jack O'Donnell\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as Lester Siegel\n* [[John Goodman]] as [[John Chambers (make-up artist)|John Chambers]]\n* [[Tate Donovan]] as Robert Anders\n* [[Clea DuVall]] as Cora Lijek\n* [[Christopher Denham]] as Mark Lijek\n* [[Scoot McNairy]] as Joe Stafford\n* [[Kerry Bish\u00e9]] as Kathy Stafford\n* [[Rory Cochrane]] as Lee Schatz\n* [[Victor Garber]] as [[Kenneth D.

It was produced by [[Grant Heslov]], Affleck and [[George Clooney]].\n\n''Argo'' was praised for the acting (particularly Arkin and Goodman's), Affleck's direction, Terrio's screenplay, the editing, and Desplat's score. The film received seven nominations at the [[85th Academy Awards]] and won three, for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]]. The film also earned five [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations: it won [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and was nominated for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture]] for Alan Arkin. It won [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture|Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture]] at the [[19th Screen Actors Guild Awards]], and Arkin was nominated for [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role|Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role]]. It also won [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Editing|Best Editing]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Direction|Best Director]] at the [[66th British Academy Film Awards]], and [[Hochi Film Award|37th Hochi Film Award]] for Best International Picture.\n\nDespite its praise, ''Argo'' has been criticized for some specific inaccuracies, in particular for minimizing the role of the Canadian embassy in the rescue, for falsely showing that the Americans were turned away by the British and New Zealand embassies, and for exaggerating the danger the group faced during events preceding their escape from the country.\n\n== Plot ==\nOn November 4, 1979, Iranian [[Islamism|Islamists]] storm the [[Embassy of the United States, Tehran|United States embassy in Tehran]] in retaliation for President [[Jimmy Carter]] giving the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]] asylum in the U.S. during the [[Iranian Revolution]]. Sixty of the embassy staff are taken as hostages, but six avoid capture and are sheltered in the home of Canadian ambassador [[Kenneth D. Taylor|Ken Taylor]]. With the escapees' situation kept secret, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] begins to explore options for [[Extraction (military)|exfiltrating]] them from Iran. [[Tony Mendez]], a U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] exfiltration specialist, is brought in for a consultation. He criticizes the proposals but is at a loss when asked for an alternative. While on the phone with his son, he is inspired by watching [[Battle for the Planet of the Apes|''Battle for the Planet of the Apes'']] and begins plans for creating a cover story for the escapees: that they are Canadian filmmakers who are in Iran scouting exotic locations for a science-fiction film.\n\nMendez contacts [[John Chambers (make-up artist)|John Chambers]], a Hollywood make-up artist who had previously worked for the CIA. Chambers puts Mendez in touch with film producer Lester Siegel. Together, they set up a phony film production company, publicize their plans, and successfully establish the pretense of developing ''Argo'', a \"science fantasy adventure\" in the style of [[Star Wars (film)|''Star Wars'']], to lend credibility to the cover story. Meanwhile, the escapees grow restless. The revolutionaries reassemble embassy photographs shredded before the takeover and finally realize that some personnel are unaccounted for.\n\nPosing as a producer for ''Argo'', Mendez enters Iran under the alias Kevin Harkins and meets with the six escapees. He provides them with [[Canadian passports]] and fake identities. Although afraid to trust Mendez's scheme, they reluctantly go along, knowing that he is risking his own life too. A scouting visit to the [[Grand Bazaar, Tehran|bazaar]] to maintain their cover story takes a bad turn when they are harassed by a hostile shopkeeper, but their Iranian culture contact hustles them away from the hostile crowd.\n\nMendez is told that the operation has been canceled to avoid conflicting with a [[Operation Eagle Claw|planned military rescue of the hostages]]. He pushes ahead anyway, forcing his boss Jack O'Donnell to hastily re-obtain authorization for the mission and confirm their tickets on a [[Swissair]] flight. Tensions rise at the airport, where the escapees' ticket reservations are confirmed at the last minute, and the head guard's call to the fake production company in Hollywood is answered only at the last second. The group boards the airliner, which takes off just as the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guards]] at the airport are informed of the ruse and try to stop them.\n\nTo protect the hostages remaining in Tehran from retaliation, all U.S. involvement in the rescue is suppressed, and full credit is given to the Canadian government and its ambassador (who shuts down the embassy and leaves Iran with his wife as the operation is underway). The ambassador's Iranian housekeeper, who had known about the Americans and lied to the revolutionaries to protect them, escapes to [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]]. Mendez is awarded the [[Intelligence Star]], but due to the mission's classified nature, he receives the medal in secret and has to return it afterward. The award is restored to him after the [[Canadian Caper]] is declassified in 1997.\n<br />\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Ben Affleck by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg|thumb|Actor, producer, and director Ben Affleck.]]\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ben Affleck]] as [[Tony Mendez]]\n* [[Bryan Cranston]] as Jack O'Donnell\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as Lester Siegel\n* [[John Goodman]] as [[John Chambers (make-up artist)|John Chambers]]\n* [[Tate Donovan]] as Robert Anders\n* [[Clea DuVall]] as Cora Lijek\n* [[Christopher Denham]] as Mark Lijek\n* [[Scoot McNairy]] as Joe Stafford\n* [[Kerry Bish\u00e9]] as Kathy Stafford\n* [[Rory Cochrane]] as Lee Schatz\n* [[Victor Garber]] as [[Kenneth D.
