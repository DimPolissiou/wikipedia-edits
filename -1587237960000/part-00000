Risk Point is the eastern extreme and southward of it there is a sand bank, nearly dry at low water, which extends nearly {{convert|3|miles}} off the southeast side of the island. The island is covered with tall mangroves.{{sfn|Great Britain. Hydrographic Dept|1908|p=38}}{{sfn|McKinnon|Carillet|Starnes|2008|p=201}}\n\nThe island is a formation at the delta of the [[Kikori River|Kikori]] and [[Omati River]]s. Its highest point is about {{convert|1|m}} above sea level; it consists of mud formation, sedimentary in nature. During very high tides (king tides during storm events), parts of the island become inundated. This has caused some deltaic villages to be relocated to higher ground.{{sfn|Haberle|2012|p=164}}\n\n==History==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 =  James Chalmers missionary.jpg \n| width1 = 165\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 =  \nOliver Fellows Tomkins.png\n| width2 = 155\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = [[James Chalmers (missionary)|James Chalmers]] (left) and [[Oliver Fellows Tomkins|Oliver Tomkins]] (right), missionaries who were murdered on the island\n}}\nOn 8 April 1901, the Revs. [[James Chalmers (missionary)|James Chalmers]] and [[Oliver Fellows Tomkins]] (1873\u20131901), together with ten missionary students, were murdered with stone implements and cannibalized by the natives of this island,<ref name=\"Prendergast\"/> at Dopima village when they tried to preach to the natives and convert them; their bones were hung as trophies.{{sfn|McKinnon|Carillet|Starnes|2008|p=201}}{{sfn|Morrissey|2012|p=83}}\n[[File:Memorial for James Chalmers.jpg|thumb|left|Memorial for James Chalmers]]\nFollowing the massacre of the white missionaries, an [[List of Australian Royal Commissions|Australian Royal Commission]] was called in 1904 to inquire into the scandal.{{sfn|Keller|2008|p=126}} This mission was led by Judge Christopher Stansfield Robinson. The object was to apprehend a native called Lake who was allegedly involved in the murders and who had refused to return the mortal remains of the missionaries for a Christian burial.{{sfn|Morrissey|2012|p=83}}\n\nThe mission also wanted to train a few natives as a police force to serve the island. A clash ensued between the natives who stormed the Australian ship ''Merrie England''. The clash was implemented without forethought, turning violent. Guns were used on the natives. As many as eight were killed and many were injured. There were no major injuries to the Australians.{{sfn|Keller|2008|pp=126\u201328}}\n\nDuring this reprisal raid, missionary Rev. [[Harry Moore Dauncey]] reported that between 4 and 700 skulls were found in various village houses, and nearly 10,000 skulls were counted in the longhouse and burnt during this raid.{{sfn|Goldman|1999|p=19}} The mission considered the natives to be savages as they greased their body for cover instead of wearing clothing. Professor Matthew R. Keller believes the commission viewed the population of the island as a different biological species.{{sfn|Keller|2008|p=120}} As a consequence of the villagers' massacre, Robinson shot himself and was replaced as Chief Judicial Officer by [[Hubert Murray]].\n\n=== 1924 floods ===\nIn 1924, floods and erosion of large tracts of coastal land resulted in the people of Kirawa village abandoning their homes and shifting to other villages in the Goaribari district. As a result, there are only two villages that remain on the island&nbsp;\u2013 Goare in the west (pop. 38) and Dopima in the east (pop. 62), which are also subject to frequent flooding. Some archaeological remains of Otoia village remain, while parts have been eroded by the Kikori River's delta channel.{{sfn|Haberle|2012|p=164}} [[Papua New Guinea stilt house|Pile dwellings]] are common as most of the land is barely above high water (of [[spring tide]]s) which makes most of the island almost uninhabitable.\n\n==Culture==\nThe Kerewo people live in the northwestern region of the island.{{sfn|Haberle|2012|p=158}} The language spoken by the people is linked to [[Kiwai language|Kiwai]]. Their ethnic identity is similar to those of the [[Fly River]] delta.{{sfn|Riesenfeld|1950|p=459}} Men have worn pubic protection crafted from a [[Melo (gastropod)|Melo]] shell.{{sfn|Neich|Pereira|2004|p=82}}\n\nThe Muguru ceremony that natives of the island conduct is similar to the one held by Kiwai people which is conducted at the club house decorated by [[Dracaena (plant)|dracaena]] leaves and a dracaena branch is stuck into the waist bands of the novices. When a skull is captured then also the dracaena is hung on the club house. On the top of the hill growth of [[Croton (plant)|crotons]] is noted.{{sfn|Riesenfeld|1950|p=459}}\n\n==Flora==\nThe wildlife is dominated by a tropical wet rainforest.

The vegetation is thick rainforest.\n\n[[Headhunting]] was evidenced by the discovery of thousands of skulls in village houses and the [[longhouse]] in the early 20th century.{{sfn|Goldman|1999|p=19}} In 1901, two ministers and ten missionary students were murdered and cannibalized by island natives.<ref name=Prendergast>{{cite web|last=Prendergast|first=Patricia A.|title=Chalmers, James (1841\u20131901)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/chalmers-james-3187|work=An initiative of the National Centre of Biography at the Australian National University|publisher=Australian Dictionary of Biography}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nGoaribari Island measures about {{convert|5.8|miles}} in east-west direction. Risk Point is the eastern extreme and southward of it there is a sand bank, nearly dry at low water, which extends nearly {{convert|3|miles}} off the southeast side of the island. The island is covered with tall mangroves.{{sfn|Great Britain. Hydrographic Dept|1908|p=38}}{{sfn|McKinnon|Carillet|Starnes|2008|p=201}}\n\nThe island is a formation at the delta of the [[Kikori River|Kikori]] and [[Omati River]]s. Its highest point is about {{convert|1|m}} above sea level; it consists of mud formation, sedimentary in nature. During very high tides (king tides during storm events), parts of the island become inundated. This has caused some deltaic villages to be relocated to higher ground.{{sfn|Haberle|2012|p=164}}\n\n==History==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 =  James Chalmers missionary.jpg \n| width1 = 165\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 =  \nOliver Fellows Tomkins.png\n| width2 = 155\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = [[James Chalmers (missionary)|James Chalmers]] (left) and [[Oliver Fellows Tomkins|Oliver Tomkins]] (right), missionaries who were murdered on the island\n}}\nOn 8 April 1901, the Revs. [[James Chalmers (missionary)|James Chalmers]] and [[Oliver Fellows Tomkins]] (1873\u20131901), together with ten missionary students, were murdered with stone implements and cannibalized by the natives of this island,<ref name=\"Prendergast\"/> at Dopima village when they tried to preach to the natives and convert them; their bones were hung as trophies.{{sfn|McKinnon|Carillet|Starnes|2008|p=201}}{{sfn|Morrissey|2012|p=83}}\n[[File:Memorial for James Chalmers.jpg|thumb|left|Memorial for James Chalmers]]\nFollowing the massacre of the white missionaries, an [[List of Australian Royal Commissions|Australian Royal Commission]] was called in 1904 to inquire into the scandal.{{sfn|Keller|2008|p=126}} This mission was led by Judge Christopher Stansfield Robinson. The object was to apprehend a native called Lake who was allegedly involved in the murders and who had refused to return the mortal remains of the missionaries for a Christian burial.{{sfn|Morrissey|2012|p=83}}\n\nThe mission also wanted to train a few natives as a police force to serve the island. A clash ensued between the natives who stormed the Australian ship ''Merrie England''. The clash was implemented without forethought, turning violent. Guns were used on the natives. As many as eight were killed and many were injured. There were no major injuries to the Australians.{{sfn|Keller|2008|pp=126\u201328}}\n\nDuring this reprisal raid, missionary Rev. [[Harry Moore Dauncey]] reported that between 4 and 700 skulls were found in various village houses, and nearly 10,000 skulls were counted in the longhouse and burnt during this raid.{{sfn|Goldman|1999|p=19}} The mission considered the natives to be savages as they greased their body for cover instead of wearing clothing. Professor Matthew R. Keller believes the commission viewed the population of the island as a different biological species.{{sfn|Keller|2008|p=120}} As a consequence of the villagers' massacre, Robinson shot himself and was replaced as Chief Judicial Officer by [[Hubert Murray]].\n\n=== 1924 floods ===\nIn 1924, floods and erosion of large tracts of coastal land resulted in the people of Kirawa village abandoning their homes and shifting to other villages in the Goaribari district. As a result, there are only two villages that remain on the island&nbsp;\u2013 Goare in the west (pop. 38) and Dopima in the east (pop. 62), which are also subject to frequent flooding. Some archaeological remains of Otoia village remain, while parts have been eroded by the Kikori River's delta channel.{{sfn|Haberle|2012|p=164}} [[Papua New Guinea stilt house|Pile dwellings]] are common as most of the land is barely above high water (of [[spring tide]]s) which makes most of the island almost uninhabitable.\n\n==Culture==\nThe Kerewo people live in the northwestern region of the island.{{sfn|Haberle|2012|p=158}} The language spoken by the people is linked to [[Kiwai language|Kiwai]]. Their ethnic identity is similar to those of the [[Fly River]] delta.{{sfn|Riesenfeld|1950|p=459}} Men have worn pubic protection crafted from a [[Melo (gastropod)|Melo]] shell.{{sfn|Neich|Pereira|2004|p=82}}\n\nThe Muguru ceremony that natives of the island conduct is similar to the one held by Kiwai people which is conducted at the club house decorated by [[Dracaena (plant)|dracaena]] leaves and a dracaena branch is stuck into the waist bands of the novices. When a skull is captured then also the dracaena is hung on the club house. On the top of the hill growth of [[Croton (plant)|crotons]] is noted.{{sfn|Riesenfeld|1950|p=459}}\n\n==Flora==\nThe wildlife is dominated by a tropical wet rainforest. Flora includes [[Nypa fruticans|Nipa]] and [[coconut]] palms.{{sfn|Haberle|2012|p=164}}\n\n== Governance ==\nGoaribari is part of ''West Kikori Rural'' LLG (Local Level Government) Area in [[Kikori District]] of [[Gulf Province]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|author=Great Britain.

At halftime the Old Etonians lead 5-1, however Darwen recover with a progressive adjustment (spreading out their formation and focusing on passing) to draw 5 all.

Workers go to the guild to demand a 5 per cent wage cut and fewer hours to help fight the oversupply that has caused the price of goods to fall. The guild refuses. Workers riot. Kinnaird is saved from the riot by Stokes. Against Kinnaird\u2019s wishes, Stokes goes in his place to warn Colonel Jackson (the guild leader) that the mob is coming for him. Police show up and arrest Stokes and kill his dog. Stokes is put on trial and sentenced to 15 years in prison. Kinnaird testifies on behalf of Stokes and saves him from prison and gives him his loan. Walsh agrees to the 5 per cent wage cut and to work five days a week if the team plays their upcoming match.
