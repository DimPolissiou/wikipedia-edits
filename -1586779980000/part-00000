{"title_page": "State legislature (United States)", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{One source|date=June 2018}}\n{{Primary sources|date=June 2018}}\n}}\n{{about||the documentary film|State Legislature (film)|a list of US state legislatures|List of United States state legislatures}}\n{{Politics of the United States}}\n\nA '''state legislature''' in the [[United States]] is the [[Legislature|legislative]] body of any of the 50 [[U.S. state]]s. The formal name varies from state to state. In 27 states, the legislature is simply called the ''Legislature'', or the ''State Legislature'', while in 19 states the legislature is called the ''General Assembly''. In [[Massachusetts]] and [[New Hampshire]], the legislature is called the ''General Court'', while [[North Dakota]] and [[Oregon]] designate the legislature the ''Legislative Assembly''.\n\n==Composition==\nEvery state except [[Nebraska]] has a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] legislature, meaning that the legislature consists of two separate legislative chambers or houses. In each case the smaller chamber is called the Senate and is usually referred to as the upper house. This chamber typically, but not always, has the exclusive power to confirm appointments made by the [[Governor (United States)|governor]] and to try articles of impeachment. (In a few states, a separate Executive Council, composed of members elected from large districts, performs the confirmation function.) Members of the smaller chamber represent more citizens and usually serve for longer terms than members of the larger chamber, generally four years. In 41 states, the larger chamber is called the House of Representatives. Five states designate the larger chamber the Assembly and three states call it the House of Delegates. Members of the larger chamber usually serve for terms of two years. The larger chamber customarily has the exclusive power to initiate taxing legislation and [[articles of impeachment]].\n\nPrior to the [[United States Supreme Court]] decisions  ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' (1962) and ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964), the basis of representation in most state legislatures was modeled on that of the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]]: the state senators represented geographical units, while members of the larger chamber represented population. In ''Reynolds v. Sims'' the Supreme Court decided upon the [[One man, one vote#United States|one man, one vote]] standard for state legislatures and invalidated representation based on geographical units regardless of population. (The ruling does not affect the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], because that chamber's makeup is prescribed by the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]].)\n\nNebraska originally had a bicameral legislature like the other states, but the lower house was abolished following a referendum, effective with the 1936 elections. The remaining [[unicameral]] (one-chamber) legislature is called the [[Nebraska Legislature]], but its members are called state senators.\n\n==Duties and influence==\n[[Image:Iowa capitol.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Iowa State Capitol]] building, where the [[Iowa General Assembly]] convenes]]\nAs a [[legislative branch]] of [[government]], a legislature generally performs state duties for a state in the same way that the [[United States Congress]] performs national duties at the [[Federal Government of the United States|national]] level. Generally, the same system of [[Separation of powers#Checks_and_balances|checks and balances]] that exists at the Federal level also exists between the state legislature, the state executive officer (governor) and the state [[judiciary]], though the degree to which this is so varies from one state to the next.\n\nDuring a legislative session, the legislature considers matters introduced by its members or submitted by the governor. Businesses and other special interest organizations often [[lobbying|lobby]] the legislature to obtain beneficial legislation, defeat unfavorably perceived measures, or influence other legislative action. A legislature also approves the state's operating and capital budgets, which may begin as a legislative proposal or a submission by the governor.\n\nUnder the terms of [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V]] of the U.S. Constitution, state lawmakers retain the power to ratify Constitutional amendments which have been proposed by both houses of Congress and they also retain the ability to call for a [[Convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution|national convention]] to propose amendments to the U.S. Constitution. After the convention has concluded its business 75% of the states will then be required to ratify what the convention has proposed. Under [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article II]], state legislatures choose the manner of appointing the state's [[United States Electoral College|presidential electors]]. Formerly, state legislatures appointed the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senators]] from their respective states until the ratification of the [[17th Amendment to the United States Constitution|17th Amendment]] in 1913 required the direct election of Senators by the state's voters.\n\n===Lawmaking process===\nGenerally, the legislative bodies and their committees use either ''[[Mason's Manual of Legislative Procedure]]'' or an amended form thereof.<ref name=\"National Conference of State Legislatures\">[http://www.ncsl.org/research/about-state-legislatures/2010-masons-manual.aspx National Conference of State Legislatures]</ref> During official meetings, a professional [[National Association of Parliamentarians|parliamentarian]] is available to ensure that legislation and accompanying discussion proceed as orderly as possible without bias.\n\n====Beginnings====\nThe lawmaking process begins with the introduction of a bill in either the House of Representatives or the Senate. Bills may be introduced in either house, sometimes with the exception of bills increasing or decreasing revenue, which must originate in the House of Representatives. The order of business in each house provides a proper time for the introduction of bills.\n\nBills are usually assigned consecutive numbers, given in the order of their introduction, to facilitate identification. Usually a bill cannot become enacted until it has been read on a certain number of days in each house. Upon introduction, a bill is usually read by its title only, constituting the first reading of the bill. Because a bill is usually read by title only, it is important that the title give the members notice of the subject matter contained in the bill.\n\n====Committees====\n\n=====General information=====\nAs with other legislative bodies throughout the world, U. S. state legislatures operate mainly through committees when considering proposed bills. Thus, committee action is probably the most important phase of the legislative process. Most bills cannot be enacted into law until it has been referred to, acted upon by, and returned from, a standing committee in each house. Reference to committee usually follows the first reading of the bill.\n\nEach committee is set up to consider bills relating to a particular subject.\n\nStanding committees are charged with the important responsibility of examining bills and recommending action to the Senate or House. Often on days when a legislature is not in session, the committees of each house meet and consider the bills that have been referred to them to decide if the assigned bills should be reported for further action.\n\nFor most bills, the recommendations of the committee are followed, although either house is free to accept or reject the action of the committee. Bills reported favorably by a committee may be placed on a regular calendar (the agenda of the deliberative body).\n\nMost of the work of the legislature is done by committees. The legislature as a whole relies on its committees to report out only those bills deserving the consideration of the entire house.\n\nThrough standing committees, each bill is addressed by a group of members who have special knowledge of its subject. Some members of the legislature have expert knowledge of particular subjects of legislation, and these members are usually placed on committees to take full advantage of this specialized knowledge. For this reason, the legislature often accepts the final recommendations of its standing committees. As has been noted, however, the legislature does not completely abdicate its responsibility for the consideration of pending bills. If the need arises, the members of either house can force a committee to take action on a bill, or they can ignore the committee's recommendations.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n===== Pocket veto and discharge petitions =====\nAcross the country, [[pocket veto]] powers are not uncommon in state legislatures, which allows a committee to \"kill\" a bill, sometimes without even a public vote; in Colorado, the power was notably repealed in a citizen initiative constitutional amendment in 1988 driven by various reform groups.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=Gary W.|last2=Kousser|first2=Thad|last3=McCubbins|first3=Mathew D.|date=2010|title=Party Power or Preferences?

The specifics vary from state to state; for example, in 2004, a report found that New York State \"places more restrictions than any other state legislature on motions to discharge a bill from a committee\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brennancenter.org/publication/new-york-state-legislative-process-evaluation-and-blueprint-reform|title=The New York State Legislative Process: An Evaluation and Blueprint for Reform {{!}} Brennan Center for Justice|website=www.brennancenter.org|language=en|access-date=2019-06-09}}</ref> which led to subsequent reforms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/testimony-lawrence-norden-regarding-new-york-state-senate-rules-reform|title=Testimony of Lawrence Norden Regarding New York State Senate Rules Reform {{!}} Brennan Center for Justice|website=www.brennancenter.org|language=en|access-date=2019-06-09}}</ref>\n\n====Post-committee====\n\n=====Reports of Committee=====\nAfter a committee has completed work on a bill, it reports the bill to the appropriate house during the \"reports of committees\" in the daily order of business. Reported bills are immediately given a second reading. The houses do not vote on a bill at the time it is reported; however, reported bills are placed on the calendar for the next legislative day. This second reading is made by title only.\n\nThe regular calendar is a list of bills that have been favorably reported from committee and are ready for consideration by the membership of the entire house.\n\n=====Third reading=====\nRegardless of how a bill is placed on the calendar, once the bill is considered and adopted, this is called the third reading. It is at this third reading of the bill that the entire legislature gives consideration to its passage. At this time, the bill may be studied in detail, debated, amended, and read at length before final passage.\n\nIf the majority vote in favor of the bill, it is recorded as passed.\n\n=====Transmission to second house=====\nA bill that is passed in one house is transmitted, along with a formal message, to the other house. If the bill is not reported from committee or is not considered by the full house, the bill is defeated.\n\nThe house of origin, upon return of its amended bill, may take any one of several courses of action. It may concur in the amendment by the adoption of a motion to that effect; then the bill, having been passed by both houses in identical form, is ready for enrollment. Another possibility is that the house of origin may adopt a motion to non-concur in the amendment, at which point the bill dies. Finally, the house of origin may refuse to accept the amendment but request that a conference committee be appointed. The other house usually agrees to the request, and the presiding officer of each house appoints members to the conference committee.\n\n=====Conference committees=====\nA conference committee is often empaneled to discuss the points of difference between the two houses' versions of the same bill, and tries to reach an agreement between them so that the identical bill can be passed by both houses. If an agreement is reached and if both houses adopt the conference committee's report, the bill is passed. If either house refuses to adopt the report of the conference committee, a motion may be made for further conference. If a conference committee is unable to reach an agreement, it may be discharged, and a new conference committee may be appointed. Some highly controversial bills may be referred to several different conference committees. If an agreement is never reached in conference prior to the end of the legislative session, the bill is lost.\n\nWhen a bill has passed both houses in identical form, it is then ready for transmittal to the governor.\n\n=====Presentation to the governor=====\nOnce a bill reaches the governor, he or she may sign it, which completes its enactment into law. From this point, the bill becomes an act, and remains the law of the state unless repealed by legislative action or overturned by a court decision. If the governor does not approve of the bill, he or she may veto it. In the event of a veto, the governor returns the bill to the house in which it originated with a message explaining his or her objections and suggesting any amendments (if applicable) which might remove those objections. The bill is then reconsidered, and if a simple majority of the members of both houses agrees to the proposed executive amendments, it is returned to the governor, as he or she revised it, for his or her signature.\n\nOn the other hand, a simple majority of the members of each house can choose to approve a vetoed bill precisely as the legislature originally passed it, in which case it becomes a law over the governor's veto. This is in contrast to the practice in most states and the federal government, which require a two-thirds majority in both houses to override a governor's veto.\n\nIf the governor fails to return a bill to the legislative house in which it originated within a specified number of days after it was presented to him or her, it becomes a law without their signature.\n\nThe bills that reach the governor less than a specified number of days before the end of the session may be approved by him or her within ten days after adjournment. The bills not approved within that time do not become law. This is known as a \"[[pocket veto]]\". This is the most conclusive form of veto, for the legislature (having adjourned) has no chance to reconsider the vetoed measure.\n\n====Constitutional amendments====\nSometimes what the legislature wishes to accomplish cannot be done simply by the passage of a bill, but rather requires amending the state constitution. Each state has specified steps intended to make it difficult to alter the constitution without the sufficient support of either the legislature, or the people, or both.\n\n== Aspects of the career of the state legislator ==\nIn most states, a new state [[legislature]] convenes in January of the odd-numbered year after the election of members to the larger chamber. The period during which the legislature remains in session varies. In states where the legislature is considered part-time, a session may last several months; where the legislature is considered full-time, the session may last all year, with periodic breaks for district work.\n\nCurrently, there are 7,383 state legislators in the United States. They are usually assisted by staff aides to help prepare and analyze legislation, to review and amend submitted budgets, and to help solve constituents' grievances with the state government.\n\nMany state legislators meet every year at the National Conference of The Council of State Governments (CSG), headquartered in Lexington, Kentucky, with offices in Washington, DC; New York City; Chicago; Atlanta; and Sacramento, and at the annual meetings of CSG's regions, The Southern Legislative Conference, The Midwestern Legislative Conference, the Eastern Regional Conference and CSG West, and at the Legislative Summit of the [[National Conference of State Legislatures]], which is headquartered in [[Denver|Denver, Colorado]] and has a lobbying office in [[Washington, D.C.]] The [[American Legislative Exchange Council]] (ALEC), a conservative organization funded by the private sector focusing on state legislatures, also has an annual meeting attracting many legislators.\n\n== Bill introduction limits ==\nAs of 2017, 24 of 99 chambers have limits on the number of bills that a legislator can introduce per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/about-state-legislatures/limiting-bill-introductions.aspx|title=Limiting Bill Introductions|website=www.ncsl.org|access-date=2019-09-04}}</ref>\n\n== Roll rates ==\nWhen a bill passes based on votes mostly from the minority party and \"moderate\" members of a majority party, it is referred to as the majority being \"rolled\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Anzia|first=Sarah F.|last2=Jackman|first2=Molly C.|date=2013-01-01|title=Legislative Organization and the Second Face of Power: Evidence from U.S. State Legislatures|journal=The Journal of Politics|language=en|volume=75|issue=1|pages=210\u2013224|doi=10.1017/S0022381612000977|issn=0022-3816}}</ref> Political scientists study \"roll rates\" as a measure of the ability of the majority party to avoid votes on bills which a majority of the majority oppose.<ref name=\":0\" /> An empirical analysis of state legislatures found that of the 99 studied, 53 had roll rates below 5% and 83 have roll rates below 10%.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== History ==\nThe first American legislature was formed in 1619 by the Virginia House of Burgesses.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.ncsl.org/Portals/1/documents/aslcs/Jrn2005_Fall.pdf|title=JUDGING LEGISLATURES|last=Hodson|first=Tim|last2=Tucker|first2=Harvey J.|last3=Garrett|first3=John|last4=Vanlandingham|first4=Gary R.|last5=Mo|first5=Stephen Davis|last6=Nv|first6=Kathy Fosnaugh|last7=Mo|first7=Jackie Hord|last8=Va|first8=Bruce Jamerson|publisher=Journal of the American Society of Legislative Clerks and Secretaries|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of United States state legislatures]]\n*[[List of current U.S. state legislators]]\n*[[Comparison of U.S. state governments]]\n*[[United States state legislatures' partisan trend]]\n*[[Legislative Assemblies of Canada's provinces and territories]]\n*[[Parliaments of the Australian states and territories]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ncsl.org/ National Conference of State Legislatures]\n* [http://www.ncsl.org/LegislaturesElections/WomensNetwork/WomeninStateLegislatures2011/tabid/21606/Default.aspx Women in State Legislatures]\n\n{{united States legislatures}}\n{{USCensus Geography}}\n{{United States topics}}\n\n[[Category:State legislatures of the United States|*]]\n[[Category:State government in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{One source|date=June 2018}}\n{{Primary sources|date=June 2018}}\n}}\n{{about||the documentary film|State Legislature (film)|a list of US state legislatures|List of United States state legislatures}}\n{{Politics of the United States}}\n\nA '''state legislature''' in the [[United States]] is the [[Legislature|legislative]] body of any of the 50 [[U.S. state]]s.

This is in contrast to the practice in most states and the federal government, which require a two-thirds majority in both houses to override a governor's veto.\n\nIf the governor fails to return a bill to the legislative house in which it originated within a specified number of days after it was presented to him or her, it becomes a law without their signature.\n\nThe bills that reach the governor less than a specified number of days before the end of the session may be approved by him or her within ten days after adjournment. The bills not approved within that time do not become law. This is known as a \"[[pocket veto]]\". This is the most conclusive form of veto, for the legislature (having adjourned) has no chance to reconsider the vetoed measure.\n\n====Constitutional amendments====\nSometimes what the legislature wishes to accomplish cannot be done simply by the passage of a bill, but rather requires amending the state constitution. Each state has specified steps intended to make it difficult to alter the constitution without the sufficient support of either the legislature, or the people, or both.\n\n== Aspects of the career of the state legislator ==\nIn most states, a new state [[legislature]] convenes in January of the odd-numbered year after the election of members to the larger chamber. The period during which the legislature remains in session varies. In states where the legislature is considered part-time, a session may last several months; where the legislature is considered full-time, the session may last all year, with periodic breaks for district work.\n\nCurrently, there are 7,383 state legislators in the United States. They are usually assisted by staff aides to help prepare and analyze legislation, to review and amend submitted budgets, and to help solve constituents' grievances with the state government.\n\nMany state legislators meet every year at the National Conference of The Council of State Governments (CSG), headquartered in Lexington, Kentucky, with offices in Washington, DC; New York City; Chicago; Atlanta; and Sacramento, and at the annual meetings of CSG's regions, The Southern Legislative Conference, The Midwestern Legislative Conference, the Eastern Regional Conference and CSG West, and at the Legislative Summit of the [[National Conference of State Legislatures]], which is headquartered in [[Denver|Denver, Colorado]] and has a lobbying office in [[Washington, D.C.]] The [[American Legislative Exchange Council]] (ALEC), a conservative organization funded by the private sector focusing on state legislatures, also has an annual meeting attracting many legislators.\n\n== Bill introduction limits ==\nAs of 2017, 24 of 99 chambers have limits on the number of bills that a legislator can introduce per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/about-state-legislatures/limiting-bill-introductions.aspx|title=Limiting Bill Introductions|website=www.ncsl.org|access-date=2019-09-04}}</ref>\n\n== Roll rates ==\nWhen a bill passes based on votes mostly from the minority party and \"moderate\" members of a majority party, it is referred to as the majority being \"rolled\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Anzia|first=Sarah F.|last2=Jackman|first2=Molly C.|date=2013-01-01|title=Legislative Organization and the Second Face of Power: Evidence from U.S. State Legislatures|journal=The Journal of Politics|language=en|volume=75|issue=1|pages=210\u2013224|doi=10.1017/S0022381612000977|issn=0022-3816}}</ref> Political scientists study \"roll rates\" as a measure of the ability of the majority party to avoid votes on bills which a majority of the majority oppose.<ref name=\":0\" /> An empirical analysis of state legislatures found that of the 99 studied, 53 had roll rates below 5% and 83 have roll rates below 10%.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== History ==\nThe first American legislature was formed in 1619 by the Virginia House of Burgesses.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.ncsl.org/Portals/1/documents/aslcs/Jrn2005_Fall.pdf|title=JUDGING LEGISLATURES|last=Hodson|first=Tim|last2=Tucker|first2=Harvey J.|last3=Garrett|first3=John|last4=Vanlandingham|first4=Gary R.|last5=Mo|first5=Stephen Davis|last6=Nv|first6=Kathy Fosnaugh|last7=Mo|first7=Jackie Hord|last8=Va|first8=Bruce Jamerson|publisher=Journal of the American Society of Legislative Clerks and Secretaries|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of United States state legislatures]]\n*[[List of current U.S. state legislators]]\n*[[Comparison of U.S. state governments]]\n*[[United States state legislatures' partisan trend]]\n*[[Legislative Assemblies of Canada's provinces and territories]]\n*[[Parliaments of the Australian states and territories]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ncsl.org/ National Conference of State Legislatures]\n* [http://www.ncsl.org/LegislaturesElections/WomensNetwork/WomeninStateLegislatures2011/tabid/21606/Default.aspx Women in State Legislatures]\n\n{{united States legislatures}}\n{{USCensus Geography}}\n{{United States topics}}\n\n[[Category:State legislatures of the United States|*]]\n[[Category:State government in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Tohaomg", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_legislature_(United_States)"}

In life and death, several media outlets including [[CNN]], [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']], [[Fox News]], and ''[[The New York Times]]'' have labeled her as the most important female figure and top selling female artist in [[Regional Mexican]] music. [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'' magazine]] named her the \"top Latin artist of 2013\", and the \"best selling Latin artist of 2013\".\n\nRivera began recording music in 1992. Her recordings often had themes of social issues, infidelity, and relationships. Rivera released her first studio album, ''[[Si Quieres Verme Llorar]]'', in the late 1990s, failing to attain commercial success; however, she rose to prominence in the United States and Mexico with her major-label debut, ''[[Parrandera, Rebelde y Atrevida]]''. In the early 2000s, she was often criticized and was refused bookings at venues across California for performing [[Banda (music)|Banda]] music\u2014a male-dominated music genre. However, her popularity grew after she won the [[Lo Nuestro Award for Regional Mexican Female Artist of the Year]] in 2007, which she won nine consecutive times. Her tenth studio album, ''[[Jenni (album)|Jenni]]'' (2008) became her first No.1 record on the [[Top Latin Albums|''Billboard'' Top Latin Albums chart]] in the United States. In 2010, she appeared in and produced the reality TV show ''Jenni Rivera Presents: Chiquis & Raq-C''. She also appeared in and produced ''[[I Love Jenni]]'' starting in 2011 through 2013 and ''Chiquis 'n Control'' in 2012. Her acting debut was in the film ''[[Filly Brown]]'', which was released in 2013.\n\nOver the course of her career, Rivera was awarded two [[Premios Oye!|Oye! Awards]] (Mexico's equivalent to the United States' [[Grammy Awards]]), two [[Billboard Music Awards|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], twenty-two [[Billboard Latin Music Awards|''Billboard'' Latin Music Awards]], eleven ''Billboard'' Mexican Music Awards and eighteen [[Lo Nuestro Awards]]. She received four [[Latin Grammy]] nominations. She has a star on the [[Las Vegas Walk of Stars]], and she is one of the best-selling regional Mexican artists of all time, having sold more than 20&nbsp;million records worldwide, also making her the highest-earning banda singer of all time.\n\nAside from music, she was active in her community and donated her time to civic causes. The [[National Coalition Against Domestic Violence]] appointed her its spokesperson in the United States. A proclamation was given officially naming August 6 \u201cJenni Rivera Day\u201d by the [[Los Angeles City Council]] for all her charity work and community involvement.\n\nRivera, along with six others, [[2012 Mexico Learjet 25 crash|died in a plane crash]] near [[Monterrey]], on December 9, 2012.

Rivera's estate subsequently had the lawsuit moved out of a state court and into federal court, but in September 2014, U.S. District Judge George Wu granted Lucio's request to have the case moved back to state court. She then published the materials and Rivera's estate are now claiming they are the rightful owners of them. The lawsuit reads, \"Defendant even falsely listed herself as the author of these copyrighted works, created by Jenni Rivera and/or owned by Jenni Rivera Enterprises, in a registration of a manuscript titled Jenni Rivera, Mi Vida Loca (My Crazy Life) as told to Laura Lucio; with the Writer's Guild of America's Intellectual Property Registry.<ref name=\"book lawsuits\">{{cite web|last=Sheperd|first=Julianne|title=Jenni Rivera's Family and Friends Continue to Fight Over Her Legacy|url=http://jezebel.com/jenni-riveras-family-and-friends-continue-to-fight-over-1642878633|work=Jezebel|accessdate=October 8, 2014}}</ref> Rivera's Estate and Lucio settled the case out of court in September 2015.

The case is also against the companies that serviced the aircraft, Bombardier Inc. and Learjet Inc. Rivera's parents and five of her children, two of whom are still minors, are plaintiffs in the case. The suit seeks unspecified damages on their behalf.
