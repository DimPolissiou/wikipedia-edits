The son of a famous Armenian writer, scientist, and public figure [[Perch Proshian]]. After graduating from high school in 1902 he entered the law faculty at [[Odessa University]], where in [[1903]] he joined the [[Party of Socialist Revolutionaries]].\n\nIn [[1905]], he was sentenced to 6 years of hard labor for attempting to release political prisoners from an Odessa prison, which he served in [[Akatuy katorga]]. In [[1910]], when he went out to the settlement, he hid from officials and fled to [[Kazan]], [[Tblisi]], and [[Baku]]. In the end he was arrested in [[Moscow]] and sentenced a second time to three years of hard labor, which he served in [[Butyrskaya prison]]. In [[1913]] he was exiled to [[Eastern Siberia]], from where he fled abroad. During the [[First World War]], he published [[Internationalist\u2013defencist schism|internationalist]] propaganda.\n\nHe returned to Russia after the [[February Revolution]] and began activist work. At the 3rd Congress of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, he became one of the leaders of the [[Left SRs|left opposition]]. At party forums and in the press, he sharply opposed the imperialist war, coalitions with the bourgeoisie, and demanded an early convocation of the [[Russian Constituent Assembly]].\n\nHe was a member of the Regional Executive Committee in [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Finland]], head of the [[Left Socialist-Revolutionary]] Committee and faction of the Left Social Revolutionaries in the [[Helsinki]] Soviet, editor-publisher of the Socialist-Revolutionary newspaper, was the initiator of concerted action with the Bolsheviks during the [[July Days]]. He was arrested by order of the [[Russian Provisional Government]] and released after the failure of [[Kornilov affair|Kornilov's coup]]. He took an active part in the preparation of [[October Revolution]], but considered it undesirable to overthrow the Provisional Government before convening the [[All-Russian Congress of Soviets]]. By decision of the SR Central Committee, the Left SRs were expelled from the party.\n\nAt the [[Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies]], Proshian was elected to the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]]. On November 2, he was elected to the Commission which negotiated with the other socialist parties on the formation of a coalition government. He opposed Bolshevik one-party rule of the [[Council of People's Commissars]], and insisted on the creation of a \"ministry\" of all Soviet parties. At the Left SR congress, Proshian was elected to the Left SR Central Committee. He was a participant in the negotiations between the Left Socialist Revolutionaries and the Bolsheviks, on the unification of the Soviets of Workers 'and Soldiers' Deputies and the Soviets of Peasant Deputies, on the reform of the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]], on the conditions for the formation of a \u201cUniform Socialist Government\u201d and the distribution of positions within it.\n\nOn December 23, 1917, Proshian headed the [[People's Commissariat for Posts and Telegraphs of the RSFSR|People's Commissariat for Posts and Telegraphs]]. During his tenure as Commissar (until March 1918) he managed to achieve an end to sabotage of employees; paid great attention to the use of the defense industry in the interests of the development of the industry, the normalization of communications, financial matters and raising wages for the lower categories of employees. Along with his work in the People\u2019s Commissariat, he participated in the development of a decree on the organization of the [[Red Army]] and the Treaty between [[RSFSR|Russia]] and the [[Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic]]. In the process of preparing the treaty, he traveled to Finland; on January 16, 1918 he reported to the [[Sovnarkom]] on the results of his mission. On February 20, 1918 he was elected to the Provisional Executive Committee of the Council of People's Commissars, amid the [[Ukrainian War of Independence#German intervention and Hetmanate, 1918|invasion of the Austro-German forces]]. On March 4, 1918, by decree of the Council of People's Commissars, he was appointed political commissar to the [[Revolutionary Military Council]], the organ of strategic leadership of the armed forces of the Soviet Republic <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agentura.ru/dossier/russia/gru/imperia/rogdenie/|title=Birth of Soviet military intelligence| archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6FxDSbpTj?url=http://www.agentura.ru/dossier/russia/gru/imperia/rogdenie/ |language=ru| archive-date = April 17, 2013}} </ref>.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the [[Brest-Litovsk treaty]], Proshian left the Sovnarkom in protest, along with other Left Socialist Revolutionaries, while continuing to remain in other Soviet posts.\n\nAt the 2nd Left SR Congress (April 17\u201325, 1918, Moscow), Proshian strove for a breakdown of the world, unleashing a guerrilla-insurgent struggle against [[German Empire|German imperialism]]. At the 3rd Left SR Congress (June 28 - July 1, 1918, Moscow) he was elected to the Central Committee.

The son of a famous Armenian writer, scientist, and public figure [[Perch Proshian]]. After graduating from high school in 1902 he entered the law faculty at [[Odessa University]], where in [[1903]] he joined the [[Party of Socialist Revolutionaries]].\n\nIn [[1905]], he was sentenced to 6 years of hard labor for attempting to release political prisoners from an Odessa prison, which he served in [[Akatuy katorga]]. In [[1910]], when he went out to the settlement, he hid from officials and fled to [[Kazan]], [[Tiflis]], and [[Baku]]. In the end he was arrested in [[Moscow]] and sentenced a second time to three years of hard labor, which he served in [[Butyrskaya prison]]. In [[1913]] he was exiled to [[Eastern Siberia]], from where he fled abroad. During the [[First World War]], he published [[Internationalist\u2013defencist schism|internationalist]] propaganda.\n\nHe returned to Russia after the [[February Revolution]] and began activist work. At the 3rd Congress of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, he became one of the leaders of the [[Left SRs|left opposition]]. At party forums and in the press, he sharply opposed the imperialist war, coalitions with the bourgeoisie, and demanded an early convocation of the [[Russian Constituent Assembly]].\n\nHe was a member of the Regional Executive Committee in [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Finland]], head of the [[Left Socialist-Revolutionary]] Committee and faction of the Left Social Revolutionaries in the [[Helsinki]] Soviet, editor-publisher of the Socialist-Revolutionary newspaper, was the initiator of concerted action with the Bolsheviks during the [[July Days]]. He was arrested by order of the [[Russian Provisional Government]] and released after the failure of [[Kornilov affair|Kornilov's coup]]. He took an active part in the preparation of [[October Revolution]], but considered it undesirable to overthrow the Provisional Government before convening the [[All-Russian Congress of Soviets]]. By decision of the SR Central Committee, the Left SRs were expelled from the party.\n\nAt the [[Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies]], Proshian was elected to the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]]. On November 2, he was elected to the Commission which negotiated with the other socialist parties on the formation of a coalition government. He opposed Bolshevik one-party rule of the [[Council of People's Commissars]], and insisted on the creation of a \"ministry\" of all Soviet parties. At the Left SR congress, Proshian was elected to the Left SR Central Committee. He was a participant in the negotiations between the Left Socialist Revolutionaries and the Bolsheviks, on the unification of the Soviets of Workers 'and Soldiers' Deputies and the Soviets of Peasant Deputies, on the reform of the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]], on the conditions for the formation of a \u201cUniform Socialist Government\u201d and the distribution of positions within it.\n\nOn December 23, 1917, Proshian headed the [[People's Commissariat for Posts and Telegraphs of the RSFSR|People's Commissariat for Posts and Telegraphs]]. During his tenure as Commissar (until March 1918) he managed to achieve an end to sabotage of employees; paid great attention to the use of the defense industry in the interests of the development of the industry, the normalization of communications, financial matters and raising wages for the lower categories of employees. Along with his work in the People\u2019s Commissariat, he participated in the development of a decree on the organization of the [[Red Army]] and the Treaty between [[RSFSR|Russia]] and the [[Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic]]. In the process of preparing the treaty, he traveled to Finland; on January 16, 1918 he reported to the [[Sovnarkom]] on the results of his mission. On February 20, 1918 he was elected to the Provisional Executive Committee of the Council of People's Commissars, amid the [[Ukrainian War of Independence#German intervention and Hetmanate, 1918|invasion of the Austro-German forces]]. On March 4, 1918, by decree of the Council of People's Commissars, he was appointed political commissar to the [[Revolutionary Military Council]], the organ of strategic leadership of the armed forces of the Soviet Republic <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agentura.ru/dossier/russia/gru/imperia/rogdenie/|title=Birth of Soviet military intelligence| archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6FxDSbpTj?url=http://www.agentura.ru/dossier/russia/gru/imperia/rogdenie/ |language=ru| archive-date = April 17, 2013}} </ref>.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the [[Brest-Litovsk treaty]], Proshian left the Sovnarkom in protest, along with other Left Socialist Revolutionaries, while continuing to remain in other Soviet posts.\n\nAt the 2nd Left SR Congress (April 17\u201325, 1918, Moscow), Proshian strove for a breakdown of the world, unleashing a guerrilla-insurgent struggle against [[German Empire|German imperialism]]. At the 3rd Left SR Congress (June 28 - July 1, 1918, Moscow) he was elected to the Central Committee. According to [[Maria Spiridonova]], Proshian was \"an internal builder, the main spring, the core of the Left Socialist Revolutionary party\" <ref>{{cite book|last=Spiridonova|first=Maria|title=Prosh Proshian, \u201cPenal servitude and exile\u201d|date=1924|page=177}}</ref>.\n\nHe was among the leaders of the [[Left SR uprising]], after the suppression of which he went underground.

Cady and her parents have moved to a Chicago suburb from Kenya, but Cady soon realizes that her high school classmates do not readily accept others who differ from them, yet she is ready to accept the challenge of friendship at the High School (\"It Roars\"). Cady is excited by the prospect of making new friends, but no one seems to like her or even acknowledge her (\"It Roars (Reprise)\"). Janis and Damian decide to help Cady as she tries to find her social group (\"Where Do You Belong?\"). Janis and Damian describe the clique of high school social royalty dubbed \"the Plastics.\" The trio is led by Regina George, the \"Queen Bee\"; Gretchen Wieners, Regina's nervous, eager-to-please second-in-command; and Karen Smith, the stereotypical dumb blonde. Regina and her fellow Plastics decide that the new girl will eat lunch with them for the rest of the week. (\"Meet the Plastics\"). When Cady tells her new friends Damian and Janis about the invite, Janis asks Cady to say yes to the Plastics and tell them everything they say. Damian tries to explain why they hate Regina, but Janis won't let him.\n\nIn AP Calculus class, Cady meets the dreamy Aaron Samuels and immediately falls for him (\"Stupid with Love\"). Kevin, head of the Mathletes, is impressed with Cady's performance in class and asks Cady to join Mathletes. Gretchen warns Cady that joining the Mathletes is social suicide and Regina is mean to Kevin to get him to go away. Cady thinks Regina is nice for 'protecting' her, but Janis warns her that Regina is dangerous. However, amazed and intoxicated by her newfound power, Cady doesn't pay attention to Janis' words (\"Apex Predator\"). At the mall, Gretchen asks Cady if she's met any boys she likes. When Cady tells her about Aaron Samuels, Gretchen is horrified because Aaron is Regina's ex-boyfriend, which makes him off-limits to Cady, as Regina's friend. The Plastics and Cady then hang out at Regina's house, where they meet her \"cool mom\". Gretchen and Karen show Cady their old Burn Book, where they put photos of their classmates and write mean comments about them. When they come across Janis' photo in the book, Gretchen explains that Janis and Regina used to be best friends. Regina tells Cady that Janis freaked out when Regina couldn't invite her to her thirteenth birthday party, and ended up in art therapy. Later, Gretchen confides in Cady that, because of the state of her friendship with Regina, she has lost all confidence in herself (\"What's Wrong With Me?\").\n\nThe next day Aaron discusses his previous relationship with Regina, and how she made him feel like not-himself, telling Cady he has sworn off dating. After an awkwardly concealed verbal slip-up results in him explaining a math problem to her, Cady believes that if she acts stupid, Aaron will help her with her work, and therefore talk to her more (\"Stupid with Love (Reprise)\"). After using this tactic, Aaron invites Cady to his Halloween party. Karen explains that in high school, Halloween revolves around looking sexy: the costume must be hot (\"Sexy\"). Cady doesn't know this and shows up at the party in a 'scary' costume, embarrassing herself. Later at the party, Gretchen, in order to gain Regina's approval, tells Regina about Cady's crush on Aaron. Spitefully, Regina decides to flirt with Aaron until he agrees to get back together with her (\"Someone Gets Hurt\"). Cady sees Aaron kissing Regina and is devastated.\n\nFurious, Cady shows up at Damian's house and tells her friends what happened. Damian tells Cady the real reason Regina and Janis stopped being friends- in 8th grade, Regina accused Janis of being a lesbian and when Janis was unable to deny it, classmates bullied Janis until she left school. The three friends decide that they will work together to get revenge on Regina, giving her K\u00e4lteen Bars so that she will gain weight. They also trick Gretchen by sending a fake Candy Cane Gram to Cady from \"Regina\" saying that they are now best friends. This leads Gretchen to reveal Regina's secret hook-ups with Shane Oman, among other vengeful acts (\"Revenge Party\"). After the Plastics' \"Rockin' Around the Pole\" dance at the school talent show is disastrous, people start noticing Regina's weight gain. Later, when Regina breaks one of the Plastics' artificial clothing rules, Cady stands up to her, banning her from sitting at their table. Everyone is relieved to be freed from Regina's rule (\"Fearless\"). Cady tries to apologize to Regina for kicking her from the lunch table, but Regina insinuates that her reign is far from over (\"Someone Gets Hurt (Reprise)\").\n\n===Act Two===\n\nAfter winter break, Cady has undergone a complete makeover befitting of her new \"Queen Bee\" status leading Karen and Gretchen. (\"A Cautionary Tale (Reprise)\"). Cady tells Janis she cannot attend her art show because of a trip with her parents and Damian and Janis dislike her new, Plastic-like behavior. Damian and the other girls of North Shore High School try to hamper Cady's ever-growing social obsessions and to stop acting dumb for Aaron by telling her about their own negative past experiences with obsessive behavior (\"Stop\"). Gretchen and Karen convince Cady to lie to her parents and throw a 'small' party while her parents are gone that weekend. Gretchen starts to notice similarities between her friendship with Regina, and her friendship with the new Queen Bee Cady, while Regina's mother wonders why her daughter won't confide in her. She reminisces about the old days when Regina was a child while Gretchen is contemplating being friends with Cady. (\"What's Wrong With Me? (Reprise)\").\n\nFollowing Gretchen and Karen's advice, Cady throws a party in an attempt to get Aaron to come over. She becomes intoxicated as the party goes on and gets crazier (\"Whose House is This?\"). When Aaron shows up, they sneak off to her bedroom. Cady tells Aaron the \"funny\" story about how she pretended that she was dumb to make him like her. Aaron explains that he really liked who Cady was before she became a Plastic (\"More is Better\"). Aaron leaves, angry at Cady's transformation, and Cady chases after him. Outside, Cady runs into Janis and Damian, who came to confront Cady after the art show. They tell Cady that she betrayed their trust, lied to them, and has gone full Plastic. Cady accuses Janis of being in love with her, just as Regina did years ago. Janis and Damian are disgusted by Cady's behavior. Janis throws the picture that she submitted to her art show at Cady, revealing the winning painting was of the three of them (\"Someone Gets Hurt (Reprise 2)\").\n\nWhen Regina discovers that she was not invited to Cady's party and that the K\u00e4lteen Bars given to her by Cady are what made her gain weight, she decides to get revenge by releasing the Burn Book, after adding \"Regina is a Fugly Cow\" to the book in order to take the blame off of herself. She throws copies of the Burn Book pages all over the school, revealing the insults about everyone they know, except Karen, Gretchen and Cady. (\"World Burn\"). All of the junior class girls begin fist fighting over the insults. Janis and Damian see an insult in the book that only Cady could have written about Damian. At a required assembly about the Burn Book, Ms. Norbury tries to bring the girls together. Janis explains her philosophy to the school, referencing her failed friendships with both Cady and Regina empowering the girls to stand up for themselves (\"I'd Rather Be Me\"). When Regina storms out in anger and disbelief, Cady tries to apologize, but Regina is distracted and is hit by a passing school bus.\n\nRegina's bus accident prompts Cady to reevaluate herself and realize what a monster she has become. Cady decides to take the full blame for the Burn Book, despite having not written the entire thing herself, because Ms. Norbury is about to be fired due to the things Cady wrote. She is suspended for three weeks and banned from the Spring Fling (\"Fearless (Reprise)\"). When Cady returns to school, Ms. Norbury offers her a way to earn some extra credit and save her grade: Cady must join the Mathletes at the state championships. The team wins, and Cady feels redeemed (\"Do This Thing\"). She then sneaks into Spring Fling with Aaron's help, after kissing him. There, she runs into Regina, and they have a heart-to-heart conversation and make up.\n\nCady is elected as Spring Fling Queen but notices how fragile and cheap the plastic crown is, breaking it into many pieces, and gives a piece to each girl at Spring Fling while complimenting each one - telling them they are all \"real, and rare\". She apologizes to Janis and Damian, and they move forward as friends once more. Cady, Damian, Janis, Gretchen, Karen, Aaron, and Regina join together, finally accepting each other (\"I See Stars\").\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Original cast===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

Every one of the principals gets a musical moment that tells us who they are, both the protective outer shell developed to survive the savage jungle of high school, and the tender human core, yearning to connect... While the show's book outshines the score, the songs pack in their share of wit, both in Benjamin's nimble lyrics (recalling her work on the Legally Blonde musical) and Richmond's buoyant tunes, which borrow with a wink from a variety of styles.\"<ref>Rooney, David.

They're the next-door versions of those cosmetically perfect pop and movie stars whose public vanities and follies we savor with such glee. Ms. Fey is an ace student of this universal prurience.

Cady and her parents have moved to a Chicago suburb from Kenya, but Cady soon realizes that her high school classmates do not readily accept others who differ from them, yet she is ready to accept the challenge of friendship at the High School (\"It Roars\"). Cady is excited by the prospect of making new friends, but no one seems to like her or even acknowledge her (\"It Roars (Reprise)\"). Janis and Damian decide to help Cady as she tries to find her social group (\"Where Do You Belong?\"). Janis and Damian describe the clique of high school social royalty dubbed \"the Plastics.\" The trio is led by Regina George, the \"Queen Bee\"; Gretchen Wieners, Regina's nervous, eager-to-please second-in-command; and Karen Smith, the stereotypical dumb blonde. Regina and her fellow Plastics decide that the new girl will eat lunch with them for the rest of the week. (\"Meet the Plastics\"). When Cady tells her new friends Damian and Janis about the invite, Janis asks Cady to say yes to the Plastics and tell them everything they say. Damian tries to explain why they hate Regina, but Janis won't let him.\n\nIn AP Calculus class, Cady meets the dreamy Aaron Samuels and immediately falls for him (\"Stupid with Love\"). Kevin, head of the Mathletes, is impressed with Cady's performance in class and asks Cady to join Mathletes. Gretchen warns Cady that joining the Mathletes is social suicide and Regina is mean to Kevin to get him to go away. Cady thinks Regina is nice for 'protecting' her, but Janis warns her that Regina is dangerous. However, amazed and intoxicated by her newfound power, Cady doesn't pay attention to Janis' words (\"Apex Predator\"). At the mall, Gretchen asks Cady if she's met any boys she likes. When Cady tells her about Aaron Samuels, Gretchen is horrified because Aaron is Regina's ex-boyfriend, which makes him off-limits to Cady, as Regina's friend. The Plastics and Cady then hang out at Regina's house, where they meet her \"cool mom\". Gretchen and Karen show Cady their old Burn Book, where they put photos of their classmates and write mean comments about them. When they come across Janis' photo in the book, Gretchen explains that Janis and Regina used to be best friends. Regina tells Cady that Janis freaked out when Regina couldn't invite her to her thirteenth birthday party, and ended up in art therapy. Later, Gretchen confides in Cady that, because of the state of her friendship with Regina, she has lost all confidence in herself (\"What's Wrong With Me?\").\n\nThe next day Aaron discusses his previous relationship with Regina, and how she made him feel like not-himself, telling Cady he has sworn off dating. After an awkwardly concealed verbal slip-up results in him explaining a math problem to her, Cady believes that if she acts stupid, Aaron will help her with her work, and therefore talk to her more (\"Stupid with Love (Reprise)\"). After using this tactic, Aaron invites Cady to his Halloween party. Karen explains that in high school, Halloween revolves around looking sexy: the costume must be hot (\"Sexy\"). Cady doesn't know this and shows up at the party in a 'scary' costume, embarrassing herself. Later at the party, Gretchen, in order to gain Regina's approval, tells Regina about Cady's crush on Aaron. Spitefully, Regina decides to flirt with Aaron until he agrees to get back together with her (\"Someone Gets Hurt\"). Cady sees Aaron kissing Regina and is devastated.\n\nFurious, Cady shows up at Damian's house and tells her friends what happened. Damian tells Cady the real reason Regina and Janis stopped being friends- in 8th grade, Regina accused Janis of being a lesbian and when Janis was unable to deny it, classmates bullied Janis until she left school. The three friends decide that they will work together to get revenge on Regina, giving her K\u00e4lteen Bars so that she will gain weight. They also trick Gretchen by sending a fake Candy Cane Gram to Cady from \"Regina\" saying that they are now best friends. This leads Gretchen to reveal Regina's secret hook-ups with Shane Oman, among other vengeful acts (\"Revenge Party\"). After the Plastics' \"Rockin' Around the Pole\" dance at the school talent show is disastrous, people start noticing Regina's weight gain. Later, when Regina breaks one of the Plastics' artificial clothing rules, Cady stands up to her, banning her from sitting at their table. Everyone is relieved to be freed from Regina's rule (\"Fearless\"). Cady tries to apologize to Regina for kicking her from the lunch table, but Regina insinuates that her reign is far from over (\"Someone Gets Hurt (Reprise)\").\n\n===Act Two===\n\nAfter winter break, Cady has undergone a complete makeover befitting of her new \"Queen Bee\" status leading Karen and Gretchen. (\"A Cautionary Tale (Reprise)\"). Cady tells Janis she cannot attend her art show because of a trip with her parents and Damian and Janis dislike her new, Plastic-like behavior. Damian and the other girls of North Shore High School try to hamper Cady's ever-growing social obsessions and to stop acting dumb for Aaron by telling her about their own negative past experiences with obsessive behavior (\"Stop\"). Gretchen and Karen convince Cady to lie to her parents and throw a 'small' party while her parents are gone that weekend. Gretchen starts to notice similarities between her friendship with Regina, and her friendship with the new Queen Bee Cady, while Regina's mother wonders why her daughter won't confide in her. She reminisces about the old days when Regina was a child while Gretchen is contemplating being friends with Cady. (\"What's Wrong With Me? (Reprise)\").\n\nFollowing Gretchen and Karen's advice, Cady throws a party in an attempt to get Aaron to come over. She becomes intoxicated as the party goes on and gets crazier (\"Whose House is This?\"). When Aaron shows up, they sneak off to her bedroom. Cady tells Aaron the \"funny\" story about how she pretended that she was dumb to make him like her. Aaron explains that he really liked who Cady was before she became a Plastic (\"More is Better\"). Aaron leaves, angry at Cady's transformation, and Cady chases after him. Outside, Cady runs into Janis and Damian, who came to confront Cady after the art show. They tell Cady that she betrayed their trust, lied to them, and has gone full Plastic. Cady accuses Janis of being in love with her, just as Regina did years ago. Janis and Damian are disgusted by Cady's behavior. Janis throws the picture that she submitted to her art show at Cady, revealing the winning painting was of the three of them (\"Someone Gets Hurt (Reprise 2)\").\n\nWhen Regina discovers that she was not invited to Cady's party and that the K\u00e4lteen Bars given to her by Cady are what made her gain weight, she decides to get revenge by releasing the Burn Book, after adding \"Regina is a Fugly Cow\" to the book in order to take the blame off of herself. She throws copies of the Burn Book pages all over the school, revealing the insults about everyone they know, except Karen, Gretchen and Cady. (\"World Burn\"). All of the junior class girls begin fist fighting over the insults. Janis and Damian see an insult in the book that only Cady could have written about Damian. At a required assembly about the Burn Book, Ms. Norbury tries to bring the girls together. Janis explains her philosophy to the school, referencing her failed friendships with both Cady and Regina empowering the girls to stand up for themselves (\"I'd Rather Be Me\"). When Regina storms out in anger and disbelief, Cady tries to apologize, but Regina is distracted and is hit by a passing school bus.\n\nRegina's bus accident prompts Cady to reevaluate herself and realize what a monster she has become. Cady decides to take the full blame for the Burn Book, despite having not written the entire thing herself, because Ms. Norbury is about to be fired due to the things Cady wrote. She is suspended for three weeks and banned from the Spring Fling (\"Fearless (Reprise)\"). When Cady returns to school, Ms. Norbury offers her a way to earn some extra credit and save her grade: Cady must join the Mathletes at the state championships. The team wins, and Cady feels redeemed (\"Do This Thing\"). She then sneaks into Spring Fling with Aaron's help, after kissing him. There, she runs into Regina, and they have a heart-to-heart conversation and make up.\n\nCady is elected as Spring Fling Queen but notices how fragile and cheap the plastic crown is, breaking it into many pieces, and gives a piece to each girl at Spring Fling while complimenting each one - telling them they are all \"real, and rare\". She apologizes to Janis and Damian, and they move forward as friends once more. Cady, Damian, Janis, Gretchen, Karen, Aaron, and Regina join together, finally accepting each other (\"I See Stars\").\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Original cast===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

Every one of the principals gets a musical moment that tells us who they are, both the protective outer shell developed to survive the savage jungle of high school, and the tender human core, yearning to connect... While the show's book outshines the score, the songs pack in their share of wit, both in Benjamin's nimble lyrics (recalling her work on the Legally Blonde musical) and Richmond's buoyant tunes, which borrow with a wink from a variety of styles.\"<ref>Rooney, David.

Some of the movie\u2019s best jokes don\u2019t fully land in their delivery...It\u2019s not shocking that 'Mean Girls' is a fast-paced fancy fun time, but it\u2019s a real treat to find that it\u2019s still witty, worldly, and wise.\"<ref>Holdren, Sara.

Mr. Richmond and Ms. Benjamin\u2019s many (many) musical numbers are passable by middle-of-the-road Broadway standards, yet they rarely capture either the tone or the time of being a certain age in a certain era... the show weighs in at two and a half hours, as opposed to the movie\u2019s zippy 97 minutes.\" However, he ultimately stated he enjoyed parts of the performance, saying: \"There\u2019s a reason the show is called 'Mean Girls.' They're the next-door versions of those cosmetically perfect pop and movie stars whose public vanities and follies we savor with such glee. Ms. Fey is an ace student of this universal prurience.

He was a student at [[National University of Singapore#Beginnings|Raffles College]] and the [[London School of Economics|London School of Economics and Political Science]], and his interest in politics began during his time in London, where he met fellow students seeking independence for [[British Malaya]] (which covered modern [[Malaysia]] and Singapore).\n\nFrom 1945 onwards he worked for the Department of Social Welfare, eventually rising to become its director. In 1958 he resigned from the Civil Service to work full-time for the [[People's Action Party]] (PAP), becoming a key member and later vice-chairman of its Central Executive Committee. The following year he successfully contested the Kreta Ayer seat in the [[1959 Singapore general election|1959 general election]] for the [[Legislative Assembly of Singapore|Legislative Assembly]], and joined the first [[Government of Singapore|government]] of [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]] Lee Kuan Yew as [[Ministry of Finance (Singapore)|Minister for Finance]]. Upon Singapore's independence on 9 August 1965, Goh became the nation's first [[Minister for the Interior and Defence]].

He was also made the first Distinguished Fellow of the Economic Development Board Society in 1991.\n\nGoh was diagnosed with bladder cancer in September 1983 and he retired from politics in December 1984. He kept a low profile but remained active with various organisations where he served on the board or as an adviser. After he married Phua Swee Liang in 1991, the couple travelled widely to places such as Australia and Hawaii. However, a series of strokes in the late 1990s and early 2000s took a heavy toll on him.

Divisions existed within the PAP as well, with a pro-Communist faction working to wrest control of the party from the moderate wing, of which Goh and Lee Kuan Yew were key members. A key source of division was the issue of merger with Malaya to form a new state of Malaysia. Goh and his fellow moderates believed this was a necessary condition for Singapore's economic development because Malaya was a key economic hinterland; merger would also provide an alternate vision against Communism for Singapore's Chinese majority. In July 1961, 16 members of the pro-Communist faction broke away from the PAP to form the [[Barisan Sosialis]], and captured control of the main trade unions.\n\n===Federation of Malaysia===\nThe Singaporean government won approval from [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] for a merger in 1961, with the Tunku being motivated by a desire to stabilise the security situation in Singapore, and notably to neutralise the perceived communist threat. Singapore merged with Malaya and the [[British Borneo]] states in 1963 to form the Federation of Malaysia. Merger, however, proved to be problematic for the Singaporean leaders. There was a clash of fundamental principles, both political and economic, notably on the issue of Malay dominance. Communitarian violence in 1964 was inflamed in Singapore by Malay and Chinese activists. According to Lee Kuan Yew, Goh fought to protect Singapore's interests against the Federal Minister of Finance, his cousin [[Tan Siew Sin]], \"who was out to spite Singapore\". Goh played a crucial role in orchestrating the subsequent secession of Singapore from the Federation on 9 August 1965. After two difficult years, Lee asked him to negotiate with the Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister [[Tun Abdul Razak]] and Minister for External Affairs Tun Dr. [[Ismail Abdul Rahman]] in July 1965 for Singapore to have a looser arrangement with Malaysia within the Federation. However, following the discussions, Goh decided on his own that it would be better for Malaysia and Singapore to have a clean break.<ref>{{citation|author=Lee Kuan Yew|authorlink=Lee Kuan Yew|title=He made the greatest difference: Eulogy by Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=24 May 2010|page=A6}}.</ref>\n\n===Post-independence===\n====Minister of the Interior and Defence (1965\u20131967) ====\n[[File:Operation Tiger Balm 09 Singapore infantry soldiers.jpg|thumb|right|Infantry soldiers of the [[Singapore Army]] awaiting the arrival of the deputy commanding general of the [[Army National Guard]], [[United States Army Pacific]], for a joint training exercise in July 2009.

He was a student at [[National University of Singapore#Beginnings|Raffles College]] and the [[London School of Economics|London School of Economics and Political Science]], and his interest in politics began during his time in London, where he met fellow students seeking independence for [[British Malaya]] (which covered modern [[Malaysia]] and Singapore).\n\nFrom 1945 onwards he worked for the Department of Social Welfare, eventually rising to become its director. In 1958 he resigned from the Civil Service to work full-time for the [[People's Action Party]] (PAP), becoming a key member and later vice-chairman of its Central Executive Committee. The following year he successfully contested the Kreta Ayer seat in the [[1959 Singapore general election|1959 general election]] for the [[Legislative Assembly of Singapore|Legislative Assembly]], and joined the first [[Government of Singapore|government]] of [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]] Lee Kuan Yew as [[Ministry of Finance (Singapore)|Minister for Finance]]. Upon Singapore's independence on 9 August 1965, Goh became the nation's first [[Minister for the Interior and Defence]].

Following his retirement from politics, in 1985 Goh was awarded the ''[[Darjah Utama Temasek]]'' (Order of Temasek), First Class, Singapore's highest civilian honour. He was also made the first Distinguished Fellow of the Economic Development Board Society in 1991.\n\nGoh was diagnosed with bladder cancer in September 1983 and he retired from politics in December 1984. He kept a low profile but remained active with various organisations where he served on the board or as an adviser. After he married Phua Swee Liang in 1991, the couple travelled widely to places such as Australia and Hawaii. However, a series of strokes in the late 1990s and early 2000s took a heavy toll on him.

Divisions existed within the PAP as well, with a pro-Communist faction working to wrest control of the party from the moderate wing, of which Goh and Lee Kuan Yew were key members. A key source of division was the issue of merger with Malaya to form a new state of Malaysia. Goh and his fellow moderates believed this was a necessary condition for Singapore's economic development because Malaya was a key economic hinterland; merger would also provide an alternate vision against Communism for Singapore's Chinese majority. In July 1961, 16 members of the pro-Communist faction broke away from the PAP to form the [[Barisan Sosialis]], and captured control of the main trade unions.\n\n===Federation of Malaysia===\nThe Singaporean government won approval from [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] for a merger in 1961, with the Tunku being motivated by a desire to stabilise the security situation in Singapore, and notably to neutralise the perceived communist threat. Singapore merged with Malaya and the [[British Borneo]] states in 1963 to form the Federation of Malaysia. Merger, however, proved to be problematic for the Singaporean leaders. There was a clash of fundamental principles, both political and economic, notably on the issue of Malay dominance. Communitarian violence in 1964 was inflamed in Singapore by Malay and Chinese activists. According to Lee Kuan Yew, Goh fought to protect Singapore's interests against the Federal Minister of Finance, his cousin [[Tan Siew Sin]], \"who was out to spite Singapore\". Goh played a crucial role in orchestrating the subsequent secession of Singapore from the Federation on 9 August 1965. After two difficult years, Lee asked him to negotiate with the Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister [[Tun Abdul Razak]] and Minister for External Affairs Tun Dr. [[Ismail Abdul Rahman]] in July 1965 for Singapore to have a looser arrangement with Malaysia within the Federation. However, following the discussions, Goh decided on his own that it would be better for Malaysia and Singapore to have a clean break.<ref>{{citation|author=Lee Kuan Yew|authorlink=Lee Kuan Yew|title=He made the greatest difference: Eulogy by Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=24 May 2010|page=A6}}.</ref>\n\n===Post-independence===\n====Minister of the Interior and Defence (1965\u20131967) ====\n[[File:Operation Tiger Balm 09 Singapore infantry soldiers.jpg|thumb|right|Infantry soldiers of the [[Singapore Army]] awaiting the arrival of the deputy commanding general of the [[Army National Guard]], [[United States Army Pacific]], for a joint training exercise in July 2009.
