He represented Ward 40 Scarborough\u2014Agincourt for the years 2000-2018 and was a City of Scarborough Councillor for the years 1974-1980 and 1988-2000. Kelly served as acting Mayor of Toronto for the period November 18, 2013 to July 1, 2014.\n\n==Background==\n\nKelly is a trained historian. He studied Canadian political history at the [[University of Western Ontario]] and attended [[Carleton University]] and [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]]. Among his most important accomplishments, Kelly undertook a two-year research project for the two best-selling books in the field of Canadian history: ''The National Dream'' and ''The Last Spike'', written by [[Pierre Berton]].\n\nKelly won the Governor General's Award for his work in ''The National Dream'',<ref>[https://www.thestar.com/federalelection/candidates/ridingprofile/492624 thestar.com], retrieved June 8, 2009</ref> which was transferred to television by the CBC as a popular, award-winning documentary series of the same name.<ref>[http://www.metrolinx.com/en/bioNormKelly.aspx Metrolinx]; retrieved June 8, 2009</ref> Kelly was also a history teacher at [[Upper Canada College]], a private school and A. Y. Jackson Secondary School, in [[Toronto]].\n\n==Early political career==\nWhen he first entered politics as an [[alderman]] for Ward 3 on the borough council of [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]], then a suburb of [[Toronto]]. Kelly served from 1974 to 1980.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bio and Timeline: Who Is Deputy Mayor Norm Kelly|url=http://www.citynews.ca/2013/11/19/bio-timeline-who-is-deputy-mayor-norm-kelly/|website=City News|publisher=Rogers Digital Media|accessdate=22 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Federal politics==\nHe was elected as a federal [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Scarborough Centre (electoral district)|Scarborough Centre]] in the [[1980 Canadian federal election|1980 election]], defeating [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] (PC) incumbent [[Diane Stratas]]. Kelly was twice appointed Parliamentary Secretary: first, to the Ministry of Supply and Services and then to the President of the Treasury Board. In this latter capacity, Kelly was given the responsibility of guiding the Government\u2019s reorganization of its Crown Corporations, Bill C-124, through the House of Commons and its Committees. Kelly was also appointed in 1983 to the Special Committee on Visible Minorities in Canadian Society. This Committee was charged with the responsibility of doing research on the status of visible minorities in Canadian society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toronto.ca/councillors/kelly1.htm|title=Councillor Norm Kelly|first=City of|last=Toronto|date=22 August 2017|publisher=|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe report, ''Equality Now'', contained 80 ground breaking recommendations aimed at protecting visible minority cultures in Canada while integrating their members into the Canadian mainstream.<ref>Squires, Judith. \"Is Mainstreaming Transformative?

He attempted to win the Liberal nomination prior to the [[1988 Canadian federal election|1988 election]], but quit the race when Odysseus Katsaitis emerged as the front runner. Prior to the [[1993 Canadian federal election|1993 federal election]], he again tried for a Liberal nomination, but this time lost to [[John Cannis]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n==Campaign for mayor==\nIn 1985, he ran for mayor of Scarborough, but lost to incumbent [[Gus Harris]]. Out of office, he worked as a real estate agent, first for [[Royal LePage]] and then for his own company. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}} In 1988, he decided to again run for mayor, but this time lost by over 4,000 votes to [[Joyce Trimmer]], the first woman elected mayor of Scarborough.\n\n==Return to council==\nIn the 1994 municipal elections, he was elected to the [[Metro Toronto]] council from ward Scarborough/Wexford, defeating [[Michael Thompson (Canadian politician)|Michael Thompson]]. He emerged as one of the most right-wing members of the council, most noted for his attempt to eliminate all funding for [[multiculturalism]] programs during a mock council. Kelly took this stance as he views multicultural programs to further segregate rather than integrate diverse members of the Canadian community. The ''[[National Post]]'' newspaper once endorsed him, perhaps somewhat in jest, as \"a solid anti-communist. Toronto needs his representation as a bulwark against the left.\" He also became one of the earliest advocates for merging the City of Toronto with five of its suburbs, an idea he pushed as Chair of the Intergovernmental Affairs Committee. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nWhen the \"megacity\" was created, he was elected to the new Toronto city council. In the [[2000 Toronto municipal election|2000 municipal election]], redistricting merged Kelly and Tzekas' wards, leading to a bitter election battle between the two, which Kelly easily won. A firm ally of the new city's first mayor, [[Mel Lastman]], his relations with Lastman's successor, [[David Miller (mayor of Toronto)|David Miller]], were less friendly.

His mother worked as a journalist in Poland.<ref>{{cite news |title=Councillor's mother dies; Maria Teresa Milczyn was a groundbreaking journalist |last=Lavoie |first=Joanna |publisher=Etobicoke Guardian |date=13 November 2005}}</ref> He attended [[Etobicoke Collegiate Institute]] and the [[University of Toronto]] where he obtained a degree in architecture.

This decision overrode his association's recommendation of Mary Sopta as the candidate. The Liberal party felt that Sopta's Serbo-Croatian background would create tension. Milczyn characterized that as \"racist\". Milczyn complained that Augustine was being appointed as the Liberal candidate only because she was black. He said, \"It's only a factor with me inasmuch as it upsets me that they're using it (color) as a factor.\"<ref name=\"Augustine\"/>\n  \nWith the merger of Etobicoke and other municipalities to form the new City of Toronto, he ran, but failed to win a seat on Toronto city council in 1997.

There was a family precedent for creative work, as the grandfather was a decorative stonemason<ref>askart.com</ref> while his father and uncle had studied at [[Ecole des Beaux Arts]] at Abbeville.<ref>[[J. P. Hodin|Hodin, J.P.]], ''Manessier'', 1972 Praeger Publishers</ref>  The \"father gave the young man permission to go to Paris on condition that he studied architecture, which was a safer occupation than that of painter.  It was not until his father, then a wholesale wine merchant in Amiens, suddenly died that he was able to change over\" to his preferred art studies. He had enrolled in architecture in 1929, switched to art with [[Roger Bissiere]] at Academie Ranson in 1935 just prior to the father's death in 1936.<ref>''20th Century Art'', 1996 Taschen Publishers</ref>\n\nIn 1937 at the Paris International Exposition, the French government appointed [[Sonia Delaunay]] and [[Robert Delaunay]] to represent avant-garde art in Paris transportation centers such as Air Palace and Railways Palace.<ref>Ferrier, JL, ''Art of our Century'', 1999 Chene-Hechette Publishers</ref>  The couple was given the task to employ and reside with 50 unemployed artists for March and April to create a substantial project of {{convert|19,000|sqft|m2}} of artwork.  Among the artists were Bissiere, [[Jean Bertholle]], and Manessier, who worked on four murals.  The following year he married painter Therese Simonnet.  In 1939 Manessier was called into military conscription, as a technical draftsman.<ref>Hodin, JP, ''Manessier'', 1972 Prager Publishers</ref>  In 1940, expecting the birth of his son, he found work as a farmhand to support the growing family<ref>Hodin, JP, ''Manessier'', 1972 Praeger Publishers</ref> but by 1941 he returned to Paris to exhibit in the Gallery Braun show \"20 Young Painters\" that ushered into France the non-figurative movement.<ref>Hodin, JP, ''Manessier'', 1972 Praeger Publishers</ref>  Despite the abstract style centered in what the occupying Germans deemed \"degenerate\" modes, and despite Manessier's teaching at the anti-authority and anti-indoctrination organization Young France, the painter was not censored or molested<ref>Ferrier, JL, ''Art of Our Century'', 1999, Chene-Hechette Publishers</ref>  The Young France organization prepared youth for work at the end of the German Occupation, with a teaching staff that also included [[Jean Bazaine]], [[Jean Vilar]], [[Jean Desailly]], Andre Clement.<ref>Hodin, JP, ''Manessier'', 1972 Praeger Publishers</ref>\n\nManessier left teaching in 1943 for painting full-time.  During this year he made a 3-day visit to the Trappist monastery in Orne.  Demoralized by the Occupation and war, at the monastery he was deeply moved by the ancient garb and art, chants and worship, rhythms of work and silence by the monks.  \"I felt profoundly the cosmic link between sacred chanting and the world of nature all around.

P. Hodin|Hodin, J.P.]], ''Manessier'', 1972 Praeger Publishers</ref>  The \"father gave the young man permission to go to Paris on condition that he studied architecture, which was a safer occupation than that of painter.  It was not until his father, then a wholesale wine merchant in Amiens, suddenly died that he was able to change over\" to his preferred art studies. He had enrolled in architecture in 1929, switched to art with [[Roger Bissiere]] at Academie Ranson in 1935 just prior to the father's death in 1936.<ref>''20th Century Art'', 1996 Taschen Publishers</ref>\n\nIn 1937 at the Paris International Exposition, the French government appointed [[Sonia Delaunay]] and [[Robert Delaunay]] to represent avant-garde art in Paris transportation centers such as Air Palace and Railways Palace.<ref>Ferrier, JL, ''Art of our Century'', 1999 Chene-Hechette Publishers</ref>  The couple was given the task to employ and reside with 50 unemployed artists for March and April to create a substantial project of {{convert|19,000|sqft|m2}} of artwork.  Among the artists were Bissiere, [[Jean Bertholle]], and Manessier, who worked on four murals.  The following year he married painter Therese Simonnet.

During this year he made a 3-day visit to the Trappist monastery in Orne.  Demoralized by the Occupation and war, at the monastery he was deeply moved by the ancient garb and art, chants and worship, rhythms of work and silence by the monks.  \"I felt profoundly the cosmic link between sacred chanting and the world of nature all around.

Bernard]].\n\nThe UPCI emphasizes [[Outward holiness|holy living]] in all aspects of one's life. It derives its [[soteriology]] in part from Acts 2:37-39 and John 3:3\u20135 (Other key texts include Acts 2:4; Romans 6:3-4; 1 Corinthians 15:1-4; 2 Thessalonians 1:8; 1 Peter 4:17) It believes that in order to receive biblical [[salvation]], a person must obey the gospel by being spiritually [[born again (Christianity)|born again]]. This is accomplished through [[repentance]] (death to [[sin]]), water [[baptism]] in the name of [[Jesus Christ]] (burial), and receiving the baptism of the Holy Spirit with the initial sign of speaking in tongues as the Spirit gives the utterance (resurrection). The UPCI believes that you are saved by grace through faith and that your good works are a byproduct of that faith, you are saved only by the grace of God through faith and that works do not save you but show your faithfulness, the concept of salvation that the UPCI adheres to could be closely resembled to the ROSES concept of salvation brought fourth by the Molinists.\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2014}}\nThe UPCI emerged from the Pentecostal Movement, which traces its origins to the teachings of [[Charles Parham]] in [[Topeka, Kansas]], and the [[Azusa Street Revival]] led by [[William J. Seymour]] in 1906. The UPCI traces its organizational roots to 1916, when a large group of Pentecostal ministers began to unite around the teaching of the oneness of God and water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ.<ref>{{Cite web|title = UPCI {{!}} About the UPCI|url = http://www.upci.org/about/about-the-upci|website = www.upci.org|access-date = 2016-02-09|last = UPCI}}</ref> Several Oneness ministers met in [[Eureka Springs, Arkansas]], and on January 2, 1917, formed a Oneness Pentecostal organization called the General Assembly of the Apostolic Assemblies.\n\nThe General Assembly of the Apostolic Assemblies merged with another church, the [[Pentecostal Assemblies of the World]] (PAW) and accepted the leadership of [[Garfield Thomas Haywood|G. T. Haywood]], an African-American. This group held the first meeting in Eureka Springs in 1918. This interracial organization adopted the PAW name and remained the only Oneness Pentecostal body until late 1924. Southern [[Jim Crow laws]] and racial hatred resulted in many white leaders withdrawing from the PAW rather than remaining under African-American leadership. Many local congregations in the South, however, remained integrated while attempting to comply with local segregation laws.\n\nIn 1925, three new Oneness churches were formed: the Apostolic Churches of Jesus Christ, the Pentecostal Ministerial Alliance, and Emmanuel's Church in Jesus Christ. In 1927, steps were taken toward reunifying these organizations. Meeting in a joint convention in [[Guthrie, Oklahoma]], Emmanuel's Church in Jesus Christ and the Apostolic Churches of Jesus Christ merged, taking the name the Apostolic Church of Jesus Christ. This merger united about 400 Oneness Pentecostal ministers. In 1931, a unity conference with representatives from four Oneness organizations met in [[Columbus, Ohio]] attempting to bring all Oneness Pentecostals together. The Pentecostal Ministerial Alliance voted to merge with the Apostolic Church of Jesus Christ, but the terms of the proposed merger were rejected by that body. Nevertheless, a union between the Apostolic Church of Jesus Christ and the PAW was consummated in November 1931. The new body retained the name of the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World.\n\nIn 1932, the Pentecostal Ministerial Alliance changed its name to the Pentecostal Church, Incorporated to reflect its organizational structure. In 1936, Pentecostal Church, Incorporated ministers voted to work toward an amalgamation with the Pentecostal Assemblies of Jesus Christ. Final union, however, proved elusive until 1945 when these two Oneness Pentecostal organizations combined to form the United Pentecostal Church International. The merger of these two Oneness Pentecostal bodies brought together 521 churches.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bernard|first1=David|title=A History of Christian Doctrine, Volume Three: The Twentieth Century A.D. 1900\u20132000|date=1999|publisher=Word Aflame Press|location=Hazelwood, MO|page=98}}</ref>\n\nIn global missions the UPCI has long followed a dual strategy of inclusion and targeted outreach. Consequently, the UPCI has believers in 212 nations and territories, and the vast majority of its total constituency is nonwhite. It has multicultural, multiracial churches in large cities around the world.\n\nIn the U.S. and Canada the UPCI has traditionally reflected the majority culture with the majority of its constituency being Caucasian and Anglo-American. In the last quarter of the twentieth century, however, the UPCI became more intentional about the inclusion of every race and culture in North America. Consequently, over the years the UPCI of the U.S. and Canada has established several important ministries that focus on the evangelism of minority groups. As of 2013 these ministries have made significant progress and are led by representatives of the various ethnicities. Spanish Evangelism Ministry reported over 700 Spanish-speaking ministers and about 350 Spanish-language congregations. Building the Bridge Ministry develops strategies for cross-cultural ministry, urban ministry, and particularly evangelism into the African-American community. Its leaders estimated that the UPCI had about 500 Black ministers and 250 Black pastors. Multicultural Ministries coordinates outreach to eighteen language and ethnic groups, encompassing 186 ministers and 195 works. Based on these statistics in 2013 about 1,400 ministers were from minority groups, or fifteen percent of the total, and about 800 churches were ministering primarily to ethnic minorities, or eighteen percent of the total. In addition, most UPCI churches have significant involvement by ethnic minorities, especially larger churches, growing churches, and churches in urban areas. This involvement was an estimated ten to fifteen percent of constituency. In sum, as of 2013 an estimated twenty-five to thirty percent of UPCI constituency in the U.S. and Canada was nonwhite.<ref name=\"UPCI Members\">{{cite web|url=http://www.upci.org/members|title=UPCI {{!}} Members|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThis diversity is increasingly reflected in leadership. For example, according to a 2012 survey of the fifty-five districts in the U.S. and Canada, thirty-one had minorities as department heads and thirty-nine had minorities in some leadership position. Of these, eleven had African-American or black board members; five had Asian, Pacific Island, or Native American board members; and five had Hispanic board members. The Board of General Presbyters (General Board), which is the governing body under the General Conference, has African-American or black, Hispanic, and Asian members. The work of the organization is conducted by eight general divisions (major ministries), and each of them has minority representation on its general committee or board. For several divisions such as Youth, Sunday School, and North American Missions, the participation is twenty percent or more. Significantly, these leaders were not chosen on the basis of ethnicity, but they have risen through the ranks and have been elected by their peers based on involvement, qualifications, and abilities.<ref name=\"UPCI Members\"/>\n\n==Beliefs==\n{{Main|Oneness Pentecostalism}}\n\n===Godhead===\nThe UPCI adheres to a \"oneness\" concept of the Godhead, in contrast to [[Orthodoxy#Orthodox in Christianity|orthodox]] belief in the [[Trinity]]. Hence, an understanding of Oneness doctrine over against Trinitarian doctrine is critical in any analysis of UPCI beliefs. \n\nThe [[Christianity|Christian]] [[doctrine]] of the [[Trinity]] defines [[God in Christianity|God]] as three consubstantial [[person]]s,<ref>The Family Bible Encyclopedia, 1972 p. 3790</ref> or ''[[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostases]]''<ref name=\"Catholic_Encyclopedia\">See discussion in {{CathEncy|wstitle=Person}}</ref>\u2014the [[God the Father|Father]], the [[God the Son|Son]] ([[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]] [[Christ]]), and the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]]; \"one God in three persons\".

They also affirm that in Jesus dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily and that Jesus is the only name given for salvation (Colossians 2:9). The [[Jesus Christ the Father|Father was revealed to the world]] in the name of Jesus, the Son was given the name of Jesus at birth, and the Holy Spirit comes to believers in the name of Jesus. Thus they believe the apostles correctly fulfilled Christ's command to baptize \u201cin the name [singular] of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost\u201d by baptizing all converts with the invocation of the name of Jesus (Matthew 28:19; Acts 2:38; 8:16; 10:48; 19:5; 22:16).<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Apostolic Life|last=Bernard|first=David K.|publisher=Word Aflame Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=Hazelwood, Missouri|pages=99}}</ref>\n\nOneness believers affirm that God has revealed Himself as Father (in parental relationship to humanity), in the Son (in human flesh), and as the Holy Spirit (in spiritual action). They acknowledge that the one God existed as Father, Word, and Holy Spirit before His incarnation as Jesus Christ, the Son of God; and that while Jesus walked on earth as God Himself incarnate, the Spirit of God continued to be omnipresent.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Apostolic Life|last=Bernard|first=David K.|publisher=Word Aflame Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=Hazelwood, Missouri|pages=99\u2013100}}</ref>\n\n===Soteriology===\nThe UPCI derives its [[soteriology]] in part from Acts 2:37-39 and John 3:3\u20135 (Other key texts include Acts 2:4; Romans 6:3-4; 1 Corinthians 15:1-4; 2 Thessalonians 1:8; 1 Peter 4:17).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.upci.org|title=Our Beliefs|last=|first=|date=|website=UPCI|publisher=United Pentecostal Church International|access-date=April 20, 2016}}</ref> Defining the gospel as \"the good news that Jesus died for our sins, was buried, and rose again,\"<ref name=\":0\" /> it believes that in order to receive biblical [[salvation]], a person must obey the gospel by being spiritually [[born again (Christianity)|born again]].

Although many Evangelicals would characterize this as \"works salvation\",<ref>See, for instance, Thomas A. Fudge: Christianity Without the Cross: A History of Salvation in Oneness Pentecotalism''.  Universal Publishers, 2003.</ref> the UPCI insists that \"salvation comes by [[Divine grace|grace]] through faith based on the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Repentance===\nThe UPCI believes that repentance is essential to salvation, as indicated in Luke 13:5 and Acts 2:38. Repentance is defined as a complete turning away from sin and toward God. According to the UPCI, repentance requires the repentant sinner to take the next biblical steps toward forgiveness and reconciliation to God: water baptism and the baptism of the Holy Ghost.<ref>See under headings \"Repentance and Emotion\" and \"Relationship to Water and Spirit Baptism\" in Bernard, David K.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=July 2010}} Furthermore, repentance must be accompanied by \"Godly sorrow\". This is not merely regret, but a genuine inward taste of God's displeasure over one's sinful lifestyle,we are all sinners and come short of the glory of God Romans 3:23, which in turn breaks his or her heart and leads to a determination to utterly forsake sin with no regrets or second thoughts.<ref>See under heading \"Contrition for Sin\" in Bernard, David K.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nRepentance is also a prerequisite for receiving the Holy Ghost. UPCI sources emphasize that no one can repent on his or her own power; it requires a supernatural gift of God's grace.<ref>See under heading \"The Source of Repentance\" in Bernard, David K.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=July 2010}} It does not bring by itself the full power of salvation, and unless it is followed up with baptism in water in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and baptism of the Holy Ghost with the evidence of tongues, it may be lost. Also, a child may not be baptized until the child knows right from wrong, because the child can not repent of the sins they have as a baby. Being that all are born into sin, we all have sin when we are born.<ref>See under heading \"Relationship to Water and Spirit Baptism\" in Bernard, David K.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=July 2010}} Furthermore, the ability to repent is temporary and may only be accomplished while one is alive.<ref>{{cite web |publisher= United Pentecostal Church International|url=http://www.upci.org/doctrine/repent.asp|title=Except Ye Repent|accessdate=2006-06-21}}</ref> Luke 13:3\n\n===Jesus' Name Baptism===\nBaptism is a second essential component of UPCI doctrine. Members of the UPCI affirm an indispensable need for baptism, citing John 3:5, Mark 16:16, Acts 2:38 and Matthew 28:19. They point to Matthew 3:13\u201316 as evidence that even Jesus himself was baptized. The UPCI mode of baptism is complete immersion in water, completed in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins.\n\nThis [[Jesus' Name doctrine]] is a point of contention between the UPCI and Trinitarian Christians. Like other Oneness believers, the UPCI baptizes \"in the Name of Jesus Christ\", while Trinitarians use \"in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit\". Both sides utilize Matthew 28:19 to support their claims, with the UPCI holding that the ''name'' of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit is Jesus. They insist that the word ''name'' in the scripture is singular, and that implies all three titles refer to Jesus. Other Oneness believers assert that Matthew 28:19 was changed to the traditional Triune formula by the [[Catholic Church]] in 325 AD in the council of Nicaea. The Jesus' Name belief originates from Acts 2:38, and members also stress Acts 8:16, Acts 10:48, Acts 19:5, and Acts 22:16, and 1 John 2:12, claiming that these are the only scriptures showing how the early Church performed baptisms, and that there is no scripture in the Word that shows anyone ever being baptized in the titles of God, and that the Bible authorizes no departure from that formula.<ref>See Chapter 7, \"Baptismal Formula: In the Name of Jesus\", in Bernard, David K.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=July 2010}}Even that the early priest state that the early church only baptized in Jesus name and the latter formula was applied after 325AD by the Catholic church.\n\n===Speaking in tongues===\nThe UPCI embraces the view that speaking in tongues is the immediate, outward, observable, and audible evidence of the initial infilling of the Holy Ghost (spirit), 1 Cor. 14:22, Acts 2:33, and is the fulfillment of Jesus' commandment to be \"born of the Spirit\" in John 3:5. As defined by the church, speaking in tongues constitutes speaking in a language that one has never learned before, as the spirit gives them utterance, Acts 2:4,<ref>See under heading \"Speaking in Tongues Defined\" in Bernard, David K.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=July 2010}} UPCI beliefs on this subject are derived from Acts 2:4, 17, 38\u201339; 10:46; 19:6; and I Corinthians 12:13, Mark 16:17, 1 Cor. 14:18, 1 Cor. 14:22.\n\nIn UPCI theology, the tongue becomes the device of expression for the Holy Ghost (James 3), and symbolizes God's complete control over the believer. Joel 2:28, Isa. 28:11. UPCI doctrine distinguishes between the initial act of speaking in tongues that accompanies one's baptism in the Spirit, and the gift of \"divers kinds of tongues\" spoken of by Paul. While the former is considered indispensable evidence of one's baptism by the Holy Ghost (as spoken of in Isaiah 28:11, John 3:5; also Matthew 3:11, Acts 1:5, 2:4, 10:45\u201346 and 19:6, according to UPCI doctrine), the latter gift is not necessarily held by all believers once they have initially spoken in tongues, it is the interpretation of tongues.<ref>See under heading \"After the Baptism of the Spirit\" in Bernard, David K.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=July 2010}} The incidents of tongues speaking described in Acts,are different in operation and purpose than the tongues spoken of in I Corinthians 12\u201314. The latter are given to selected believers as the Spirit decides. Acts 2:3, Acts 2:11, 1 Cor. 12:10, 12:28,1 Cor. 14:21, James 3:8.\n\nUPCI doctrine also distinguishes between the [[fruit of the Spirit]], as mentioned in Galatians 5:22\u201323, and the initial act of speaking in tongues. The fruit of the Spirit takes time to develop or cultivate and therefore does not qualify as an immediate, outward and identifiable sign of receiving the Holy Ghost. Speaking in other tongues, on the other hand, does serve as that sign and is therefore considered an indispensable part of any person's salvation process. Acts 10:44-48, they knew they had the Holy Ghost because they could hear them speak with tongues. 1 Cor. 14:22, tongues is for a sign, not to them that believe but to them that believe not.\n\n===Holiness living===\n{{Main|Outward holiness}}\nThe UPCI emphasizes that salvation is accomplished by grace through faith in Christ (Ephesians 2:8-9). This faith is coupled with obedience to his command to be \"born of water and of the Spirit\" (John 3:5). Even though no amount of obedience to laws saves anyone (Ephesians 2:8\u20139, Titus 3:5), the Scriptures also state that those who are saved have been created in order to do good works (Ephesians 2:10).<ref>See Essential Doctrines of the Bible, \"New Testament Salvation\", subheading \"Salvation by grace through faith\", Word Aflame Press, 1979.</ref>\n\nGiven this Scriptural principle, the UPCI teaches that one should live a life that demonstrates Christ's attributes.<ref>See ''An Overview of Basic Doctrines'', Section IV \"Holiness and Christian Living,\" Word Aflame Press, 1979. Contains numerous scriptural references for specific UPCI standards.</ref> Inward holiness, such as demonstration of the fruits of the Spirit in the Christian's life, is to be accompanied by outward signs of holiness, according to the UPCI. The UPCI also maintains the teaching of gender roles, including a belief that women should not cut their hair (1 Corinthians 11:3-15) or wear pants. Inward and outward modesty applies to women and men alike, though UPCI men have fewer dress codes than their female counterparts. Members are discouraged from adorning themselves outwardly with cosmetics or jewelry, biblically defined as \"gold, or pearls, or costly array,\" and should instead show their beauty by their actions (I Timothy 2:8-10).\n\n==Organization==\nThe basic governmental structure of the UPCI is [[congregational]] at the local church level and presbyterian at higher organizational levels. Local churches are autonomous, electing their own [[pastor]]s and other leaders, owning their own property, deciding their own budgets, establishing their membership, and conducting all necessary local business.<ref>[http://www.upci.org/printVersions/about_printVersion.asp. Retrieved on 17 July 2008.]</ref> The central organization embraces a modified presbyterian system: ministers meet in sectional, district, and general conferences to elect officers and to conduct the church's affairs. The annual General Conference is the highest authority in the UPCI, with power to determine [[articles of faith]], elect officers and determine policy. A General Superintendent is elected to preside over the church as a whole. On October 1, 2009, David K. Bernard was announced as the new General Superintendent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unitedpentecostal.net/gc2009/news.asp|title=gc2009 - News|website=www.unitedpentecostal.net|access-date=2016-09-30}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the UPCI, in the United States and Canada it has grown from 521 member churches in 1945 to 4,819 churches (including daughter works and preaching points) 10,627 ministers, and 750,000 constituents in the United States and Canada in 2019. Outside the U.S. and Canada it has 34,779 churches and preaching points, 25,292 licensed ministers, 970 missionaries, and a constituency of 3.25 million in 195 nations and 35 territories.

Bernard]].\n\nThe UPCI emphasizes [[Outward holiness|holy living]] in all aspects of one's life. It derives its [[soteriology]] in part from Acts 2:37-39 and John 3:3\u20135 (Other key texts include Acts 2:4; Romans 6:3-4; 1 Corinthians 15:1-4; 2 Thessalonians 1:8; 1 Peter 4:17) It believes that in order to receive biblical [[salvation]], a person must obey the gospel by being spiritually [[born again (Christianity)|born again]]. This is accomplished through [[repentance]] (death to [[sin]]), water [[baptism]] in the name of [[Jesus Christ]] (burial), and receiving the baptism of the Holy Spirit with the initial sign of speaking in tongues as the Spirit gives the utterance (resurrection). The UPCI believes that you are saved by grace through faith and that your good works are a byproduct of that faith, you are saved only by the grace of God through faith and that works do not save you but show your faithfulness, the concept of salvation that the UPCI adheres to could be closely resembled to the ROSES concept of salvation brought fourth by the Molinists.\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2014}}\nThe UPCI emerged from the Pentecostal Movement, which traces its origins to the teachings of [[Charles Parham]] in [[Topeka, Kansas]], and the [[Azusa Street Revival]] led by [[William J. Seymour]] in 1906. The UPCI traces its organizational roots to 1916, when a large group of Pentecostal ministers began to unite around the teaching of the oneness of God and water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ.<ref>{{Cite web|title = UPCI {{!}} About the UPCI|url = http://www.upci.org/about/about-the-upci|website = www.upci.org|access-date = 2016-02-09|last = UPCI}}</ref> Several Oneness ministers met in [[Eureka Springs, Arkansas]], and on January 2, 1917, formed a Oneness Pentecostal organization called the General Assembly of the Apostolic Assemblies.\n\nThe General Assembly of the Apostolic Assemblies merged with another church, the [[Pentecostal Assemblies of the World]] (PAW) and accepted the leadership of [[Garfield Thomas Haywood|G. T. Haywood]], an African-American. This group held the first meeting in Eureka Springs in 1918. This interracial organization adopted the PAW name and remained the only Oneness Pentecostal body until late 1924. Southern [[Jim Crow laws]] and racial hatred resulted in many white leaders withdrawing from the PAW rather than remaining under African-American leadership. Many local congregations in the South, however, remained integrated while attempting to comply with local segregation laws.\n\nIn 1925, three new Oneness churches were formed: the Apostolic Churches of Jesus Christ, the Pentecostal Ministerial Alliance, and Emmanuel's Church in Jesus Christ. In 1927, steps were taken toward reunifying these organizations. Meeting in a joint convention in [[Guthrie, Oklahoma]], Emmanuel's Church in Jesus Christ and the Apostolic Churches of Jesus Christ merged, taking the name the Apostolic Church of Jesus Christ. This merger united about 400 Oneness Pentecostal ministers. In 1931, a unity conference with representatives from four Oneness organizations met in [[Columbus, Ohio]] attempting to bring all Oneness Pentecostals together. The Pentecostal Ministerial Alliance voted to merge with the Apostolic Church of Jesus Christ, but the terms of the proposed merger were rejected by that body. Nevertheless, a union between the Apostolic Church of Jesus Christ and the PAW was consummated in November 1931. The new body retained the name of the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World.\n\nIn 1932, the Pentecostal Ministerial Alliance changed its name to the Pentecostal Church, Incorporated to reflect its organizational structure. In 1936, Pentecostal Church, Incorporated ministers voted to work toward an amalgamation with the Pentecostal Assemblies of Jesus Christ. Final union, however, proved elusive until 1945 when these two Oneness Pentecostal organizations combined to form the United Pentecostal Church International. The merger of these two Oneness Pentecostal bodies brought together 521 churches.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bernard|first1=David|title=A History of Christian Doctrine, Volume Three: The Twentieth Century A.D. 1900\u20132000|date=1999|publisher=Word Aflame Press|location=Hazelwood, MO|page=98}}</ref>\n\nIn global missions the UPCI has long followed a dual strategy of inclusion and targeted outreach. Consequently, the UPCI has believers in 212 nations and territories, and the vast majority of its total constituency is nonwhite. It has multicultural, multiracial churches in large cities around the world.\n\nIn the U.S. and Canada the UPCI has traditionally reflected the majority culture with the majority of its constituency being Caucasian and Anglo-American. In the last quarter of the twentieth century, however, the UPCI became more intentional about the inclusion of every race and culture in North America. Consequently, over the years the UPCI of the U.S. and Canada has established several important ministries that focus on the evangelism of minority groups. As of 2013 these ministries have made significant progress and are led by representatives of the various ethnicities. Spanish Evangelism Ministry reported over 700 Spanish-speaking ministers and about 350 Spanish-language congregations. Building the Bridge Ministry develops strategies for cross-cultural ministry, urban ministry, and particularly evangelism into the African-American community. Its leaders estimated that the UPCI had about 500 Black ministers and 250 Black pastors. Multicultural Ministries coordinates outreach to eighteen language and ethnic groups, encompassing 186 ministers and 195 works. Based on these statistics in 2013 about 1,400 ministers were from minority groups, or fifteen percent of the total, and about 800 churches were ministering primarily to ethnic minorities, or eighteen percent of the total. In addition, most UPCI churches have significant involvement by ethnic minorities, especially larger churches, growing churches, and churches in urban areas. This involvement was an estimated ten to fifteen percent of constituency. In sum, as of 2013 an estimated twenty-five to thirty percent of UPCI constituency in the U.S. and Canada was nonwhite.<ref name=\"UPCI Members\">{{cite web|url=http://www.upci.org/members|title=UPCI {{!}} Members|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThis diversity is increasingly reflected in leadership. For example, according to a 2012 survey of the fifty-five districts in the U.S. and Canada, thirty-one had minorities as department heads and thirty-nine had minorities in some leadership position. Of these, eleven had African-American or black board members; five had Asian, Pacific Island, or Native American board members; and five had Hispanic board members. The Board of General Presbyters (General Board), which is the governing body under the General Conference, has African-American or black, Hispanic, and Asian members. The work of the organization is conducted by eight general divisions (major ministries), and each of them has minority representation on its general committee or board. For several divisions such as Youth, Sunday School, and North American Missions, the participation is twenty percent or more. Significantly, these leaders were not chosen on the basis of ethnicity, but they have risen through the ranks and have been elected by their peers based on involvement, qualifications, and abilities.<ref name=\"UPCI Members\"/>\n\n==Beliefs==\n{{Main|Oneness Pentecostalism}}\n\n===Godhead===\nThe UPCI adheres to a \"oneness\" concept of the Godhead, in contrast to [[Orthodoxy#Orthodox in Christianity|orthodox]] belief in the [[Trinity]]. Hence, an understanding of Oneness doctrine over against Trinitarian doctrine is critical in any analysis of UPCI beliefs. \n\nThe [[Christianity|Christian]] [[doctrine]] of the [[Trinity]] defines [[God in Christianity|God]] as three consubstantial [[person]]s,<ref>The Family Bible Encyclopedia, 1972 p. 3790</ref> or ''[[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostases]]''<ref name=\"Catholic_Encyclopedia\">See discussion in {{CathEncy|wstitle=Person}}</ref>\u2014the [[God the Father|Father]], the [[God the Son|Son]] ([[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]] [[Christ]]), and the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]]; \"one God in three persons\".

They also affirm that in Jesus dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily and that Jesus is the only name given for salvation (Colossians 2:9). The [[Jesus Christ the Father|Father was revealed to the world]] in the name of Jesus, the Son was given the name of Jesus at birth, and the Holy Spirit comes to believers in the name of Jesus. Thus they believe the apostles correctly fulfilled Christ's command to baptize \u201cin the name [singular] of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost\u201d by baptizing all converts with the invocation of the name of Jesus (Matthew 28:19; Acts 2:38; 8:16; 10:48; 19:5; 22:16).<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Apostolic Life|last=Bernard|first=David K.|publisher=Word Aflame Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=Hazelwood, Missouri|pages=99}}</ref>\n\nOneness believers affirm that God has revealed Himself as Father (in parental relationship to humanity), in the Son (in human flesh), and as the Holy Spirit (in spiritual action). They acknowledge that the one God existed as Father, Word, and Holy Spirit before His incarnation as Jesus Christ, the Son of God; and that while Jesus walked on earth as God Himself incarnate, the Spirit of God continued to be omnipresent.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Apostolic Life|last=Bernard|first=David K.|publisher=Word Aflame Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=Hazelwood, Missouri|pages=99\u2013100}}</ref>\n\n===Soteriology===\nThe UPCI derives its [[soteriology]] in part from Acts 2:37-39 and John 3:3\u20135 (Other key texts include Acts 2:4; Romans 6:3-4; 1 Corinthians 15:1-4; 2 Thessalonians 1:8; 1 Peter 4:17).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.upci.org|title=Our Beliefs|last=|first=|date=|website=UPCI|publisher=United Pentecostal Church International|access-date=April 20, 2016}}</ref> Defining the gospel as \"the good news that Jesus died for our sins, was buried, and rose again,\"<ref name=\":0\" /> it believes that in order to receive biblical [[salvation]], a person must obey the gospel by being spiritually [[born again (Christianity)|born again]].

Repentance is defined as a complete turning away from sin and toward God. According to the UPCI, repentance requires the repentant sinner to take the next biblical steps toward forgiveness and reconciliation to God: water baptism and the baptism of the Holy Ghost.<ref>See under headings \"Repentance and Emotion\" and \"Relationship to Water and Spirit Baptism\" in Bernard, David K.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=July 2010}} Furthermore, repentance must be accompanied by \"Godly sorrow\". This is not merely regret, but a genuine inward taste of God's displeasure over one's sinful lifestyle,we are all sinners and come short of the glory of God Romans 3:23, which in turn breaks his or her heart and leads to a determination to utterly forsake sin with no regrets or second thoughts.<ref>See under heading \"Contrition for Sin\" in Bernard, David K.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nRepentance is also a prerequisite for receiving the Holy Ghost. UPCI sources emphasize that no one can repent on his or her own power; it requires a supernatural gift of God's grace.<ref>See under heading \"The Source of Repentance\" in Bernard, David K.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=July 2010}} It does not bring by itself the full power of salvation, and unless it is followed up with baptism in water in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and baptism of the Holy Ghost with the evidence of tongues, it may be lost. Also, a child may not be baptized until the child knows right from wrong, because the child can not repent of the sins they have as a baby. Being that all are born into sin, we all have sin when we are born.<ref>See under heading \"Relationship to Water and Spirit Baptism\" in Bernard, David K.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=July 2010}} Furthermore, the ability to repent is temporary and may only be accomplished while one is alive.<ref>{{cite web |publisher= United Pentecostal Church International|url=http://www.upci.org/doctrine/repent.asp|title=Except Ye Repent|accessdate=2006-06-21}}</ref> Luke 13:3\n\n===Jesus' Name Baptism===\nBaptism is a second essential component of UPCI doctrine. Members of the UPCI affirm an indispensable need for baptism, citing John 3:5, Mark 16:16, Acts 2:38 and Matthew 28:19. They point to Matthew 3:13\u201316 as evidence that even Jesus himself was baptized. The UPCI mode of baptism is complete immersion in water, completed in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins.\n\nThis [[Jesus' Name doctrine]] is a point of contention between the UPCI and Trinitarian Christians. Like other Oneness believers, the UPCI baptizes \"in the Name of Jesus Christ\", while Trinitarians use \"in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit\". Both sides utilize Matthew 28:19 to support their claims, with the UPCI holding that the ''name'' of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit is Jesus. They insist that the word ''name'' in the scripture is singular, and that implies all three titles refer to Jesus. Other Oneness believers assert that Matthew 28:19 was changed to the traditional Triune formula by the [[Catholic Church]] in 325 AD in the council of Nicaea. The Jesus' Name belief originates from Acts 2:38, and members also stress Acts 8:16, Acts 10:48, Acts 19:5, and Acts 22:16, and 1 John 2:12, claiming that these are the only scriptures showing how the early Church performed baptisms, and that there is no scripture in the Word that shows anyone ever being baptized in the titles of God, and that the Bible authorizes no departure from that formula.<ref>See Chapter 7, \"Baptismal Formula: In the Name of Jesus\", in Bernard, David K.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=July 2010}}Even that the early priest state that the early church only baptized in Jesus name and the latter formula was applied after 325AD by the Catholic church.\n\n===Speaking in tongues===\nThe UPCI embraces the view that speaking in tongues is the immediate, outward, observable, and audible evidence of the initial infilling of the Holy Ghost (spirit), 1 Cor. 14:22, Acts 2:33, and is the fulfillment of Jesus' commandment to be \"born of the Spirit\" in John 3:5. As defined by the church, speaking in tongues constitutes speaking in a language that one has never learned before,as the spirit gives them utterance, Acts 2:4,<ref>See under heading \"Speaking in Tongues Defined\" in Bernard, David K.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=July 2010}} UPCI beliefs on this subject are derived from Acts 2:4, 17, 38\u201339; 10:46; 19:6; and I Corinthians 12:13, Mark 16:17, 1 Cor. 14:18, 1 Cor. 14:22.\n\nIn UPCI theology, the tongue becomes the device of expression for the Holy Ghost (James 3), and symbolizes God's complete control over the believer. Joel 2:28, Isa. 28:11. UPCI doctrine distinguishes between the initial act of speaking in tongues that accompanies one's baptism in the Spirit, and the gift of \"divers kinds of tongues\" spoken of by Paul. While the former is considered indispensable evidence of one's baptism by the Holy Ghost (as spoken of in Isaiah 28:11, John 3:5; also Matthew 3:11, Acts 1:5, 2:4, 10:45\u201346 and 19:6, according to UPCI doctrine), the latter gift is not necessarily held by all believers once they have initially spoken in tongues, it is the interpretation of tongues.<ref>See under heading \"After the Baptism of the Spirit\" in Bernard, David K.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=July 2010}} The incidents of tongues speaking described in Acts,are different in operation and purpose than the tongues spoken of in I Corinthians 12\u201314. The latter are given to selected believers as the Spirit decides. Acts 2:3, Acts 2:11, 1 Cor. 12:10, 12:28,1 Cor. 14:21, James 3:8.\n\nUPCI doctrine also distinguishes between the [[fruit of the Spirit]], as mentioned in Galatians 5:22\u201323, and the initial act of speaking in tongues. The fruit of the Spirit takes time to develop or cultivate and therefore does not qualify as an immediate, outward and identifiable sign of receiving the Holy Ghost. Speaking in other tongues, on the other hand, does serve as that sign and is therefore considered an indispensable part of any person's salvation process. Acts 10:44-48, they knew they had the Holy Ghost because they could hear them speak with tongues. 1 Cor. 14:22, tongues is for a sign, not to them that believe but to them that believe not.\n\n===Holiness living===\n{{Main|Outward holiness}}\nThe UPCI emphasizes that salvation is accomplished by grace through faith in Christ (Ephesians 2:8-9). This faith is coupled with obedience to his command to be \"born of water and of the Spirit\" (John 3:5). Even though no amount of obedience to laws saves anyone (Ephesians 2:8\u20139, Titus 3:5), the Scriptures also state that those who are saved have been created in order to do good works (Ephesians 2:10).<ref>See Essential Doctrines of the Bible, \"New Testament Salvation\", subheading \"Salvation by grace through faith\", Word Aflame Press, 1979.</ref>\n\nGiven this Scriptural principle, the UPCI teaches that one should live a life that demonstrates Christ's attributes.<ref>See ''An Overview of Basic Doctrines'', Section IV \"Holiness and Christian Living,\" Word Aflame Press, 1979. Contains numerous scriptural references for specific UPCI standards.</ref> Inward holiness, such as demonstration of the fruits of the Spirit in the Christian's life, is to be accompanied by outward signs of holiness, according to the UPCI. The UPCI also maintains the teaching of gender roles, including a belief that women should not cut their hair (1 Corinthians 11:3-15) or wear pants. Inward and outward modesty applies to women and men alike, though UPCI men have fewer dress codes than their female counterparts. Members are discouraged from adorning themselves outwardly with cosmetics or jewelry, biblically defined as \"gold, or pearls, or costly array,\" and should instead show their beauty by their actions (I Timothy 2:8-10).\n\n==Organization==\nThe basic governmental structure of the UPCI is [[congregational]] at the local church level and presbyterian at higher organizational levels. Local churches are autonomous, electing their own [[pastor]]s and other leaders, owning their own property, deciding their own budgets, establishing their membership, and conducting all necessary local business.<ref>[http://www.upci.org/printVersions/about_printVersion.asp. Retrieved on 17 July 2008.]</ref> The central organization embraces a modified presbyterian system: ministers meet in sectional, district, and general conferences to elect officers and to conduct the church's affairs. The annual General Conference is the highest authority in the UPCI, with power to determine [[articles of faith]], elect officers and determine policy. A General Superintendent is elected to preside over the church as a whole. On October 1, 2009, David K. Bernard was announced as the new General Superintendent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unitedpentecostal.net/gc2009/news.asp|title=gc2009 - News|website=www.unitedpentecostal.net|access-date=2016-09-30}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the UPCI, in the United States and Canada it has grown from 521 member churches in 1945 to 4,819 churches (including daughter works and preaching points) 10,627 ministers, and 750,000 constituents in the United States and Canada in 2019. Outside the U.S. and Canada it has 34,779 churches and preaching points, 25,292 licensed ministers, 970 missionaries, and a constituency of 3.25 million in 195 nations and 35 territories. The international fellowship consists of national organizations that are united as the Global Council of the UPCI, which is chaired by the general superintendent of the UPCI, David K. Bernard. Total worldwide membership, including North America, is at more than 5 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://christianity.about.com/od/United-Pentecostal-Church/a/United-Pentecostal-Church.htm|title=United Pentecostal Church International|author=Jack Zavada|work=About.com Religion & Spirituality|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nMinisters at all levels are allowed to marry and have children.
