In 1827, an argument between [[Hussein Dey]], the ruler of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Regency of Algiers]], and the French [[consul (representative)|consul]] escalated into a [[naval blockade]], following which [[July Monarchy|France]] invaded and quickly seized [[Algiers]] in 1830, and rapidly took control of other coastal communities. Amid internal political strife in France, decisions were repeatedly taken to retain control over the territory, and additional military forces were brought in over the following years to quell resistance in the interior of the country.\n\nAlgerian resistance forces were divided between forces under [[Ahmed Bey ben Mohamed Ch\u00e9rif]] at [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]], primarily in the east, and nationalist forces in [[Kabylie]] and the west. Treaties with the nationalists under [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|`Abd al-Q\u0101dir]] enabled the French to first focus on the elimination of the remaining Ottoman threat, achieved with the 1837 capture of Constantine. Abd Al-Q\u0101dir continued to give stiff resistance in the west. Finally driven into [[Morocco]] in 1842, by large-scale and heavy-handed French military action, he continued to wage a [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] until the [[Moroccan government]], under French diplomatic pressure following its defeat in the [[First Franco-Moroccan War]], drove him out of Morocco. He surrendered to French forces in 1847.\n\n== Background information ==\n\nThe territory now known as [[Algeria]] was only partially under the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s control in 1830. The [[dey]] ruled the entire [[Regency of Algiers]], but only exercised direct control in and around [[Algiers]], with [[Bey]]liks established in a few outlying areas, including [[Oran]] and [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]]. The remainder of the territory (including much of the interior), while nominally Ottoman, was effectively under the control of local Arab leaders. The dey acted largely independently of the Ottoman Emperor, although he was supported by (or controlled by, depending on historical perspective) Turkish [[Janissary]] troops stationed in Algiers. The territory was bordered to the west by the [[Sultanate of Morocco]] and to the east by the Ottoman [[History of Ottoman-era Tunisia|Regency of Tunis]]. The western border, the {{ILL|Tafna|fr}} River, was particularly porous since there were shared tribal connections that crossed it.\n\nThe Regency of Algiers was one of the main bases of the [[Barbary pirate]]s and [[Barbary Slave Trade]]rs who attacked Christian ships and coastal settlements in the [[Mediterranean]] and North [[Atlantic (ocean)|Atlantic]]. Like the rest of the [[Barbary Coast]], the Regency of Algiers lived from the trade of slaves or goods captured from [[Europe]], [[United States|America]] and [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. The European powers bombarded Algiers on different occasions in retaliation and the United States provoked the [[Barbary Wars]] in order to put an end to Algerian privateering against Christian shipping.<ref>{{Cite news | first=Robert | last=Carver| title=Not so easy alliances: ''Two Faiths, One Banner: When Muslims Marched with Christians Across Europe\u2019s Battlegrounds'' |type= Book review | url=http://www.thetablet.co.uk/review/442| work= Tablet | location= | page= 24 | date=25 April 2009 |url-status= dead |archive-date= 29 June 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629033728/http://www.thetablet.co.uk/review/442}}</ref>\n\nThe conquest of Algeria began in the last days of the [[Bourbon Restoration]] by [[Charles X of France]]. It aimed to put a definite end to Barbary privateering and increase the king's popularity among the French people, particularly in Paris, where many veterans of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] lived. Algerian slave trade and piracy immediately ceased after the French conquered Algiers.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Barbary Pirates}}</ref>\n\n=== Fan Affair ===\n<!-- This section is referenced in the Algeria article. Don't change the title without updating links. -->\nIn 1795\u201396, the French Republic contracted to purchase wheat for the French army from two Jewish merchants in Algiers, and Charles X was apparently uninterested in paying the Republic's debt. The merchants, who had debts to [[Hussein Dey]], the Ottoman ruler of Algiers, claimed inability to pay those debts until France paid its debts to them. The dey unsuccessfully negotiated with [[Pierre Deval (diplomat)|Pierre Deval]], the French consul, to rectify this situation, and suspected Deval of collaborating with the merchants against him, especially since the French government made no provision to pay the merchants in 1820.  Deval's nephew Alexandre, the consul in [[B\u00f4ne]], further angered the dey by fortifying French storehouses in B\u00f4ne and [[El Kala|La Calle]] despite prior agreements.{{sfnp|Abun-Nasr|1987|p=249}}\n\n[[File:Le coup d eventail 1827.jpg|thumb|left|The \"Fan Affair\", which escalated into the invasion.]]\nAfter a contentious meeting on 29 April 1827 in which Deval refused to provide satisfactory answers, the dey struck Deval with his [[fly-whisk]] (then called a [[Hand fan|fan]]). Charles X used this slight against his diplomatic representative to first demand an apology from the dey, and then to initiate a blockade against the port of Algiers. The blockade lasted for three years, and was primarily to the detriment of French merchants who were unable to do business with Algiers, while Barbary pirates were still able to evade the blockade.  When France in 1829 sent an ambassador to the dey with a proposal for negotiations, he responded with cannon fire directed toward one of the blockading ships. The French then decided that more forceful action was required.{{sfnp|Abun-Nasr|1987|p=250}}\n\nFollowing the failure of the ambassador's visit, Charles appointed as President [[Jules, Prince de Polignac]], a hardline conservative. This outraged the liberal French opposition, which then had a majority in the [[Chamber of Deputies of France|Chamber of Deputies]]. Polignac opened negotiations with [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] to essentially divide up North Africa. Ali, although nominally a vassal of the Ottomans, eventually rejected this idea. As popular opinion continued to rise against Polignac and the King, they decided that a foreign policy victory such as the capture of Algiers would turn opinion in their favour again.{{sfnp|Ruedy|2005|p=47}}\n\n==Invasion of Algiers==\n{{main|Invasion of Algiers in 1830}}\n[[Image:D\u00e9barquement en Alg\u00e9rie 09665.jpg|thumb|At Sidi-Ferruch by [[Pierre-Julien Gilbert]].]]\n[[File:Bombardementd alger-1830.jpg|thumb|The attack of [[Admiral Duperr\u00e9]] during the taking of Algiers in 1830.]]\n[[File:Ottoman cannon end of 16th century length 385cm cal 178mm weight 2910 stone projectile founded 8 October 1581 Alger seized 1830.jpg|thumb|Ornate [[Ottoman weapons|Ottoman cannon]], length: 385cm, cal:178mm, weight: 2910, stone projectile, founded 8 October 1581 in Algiers, seized by France at Algiers in 1830.

Following a plan for the invasion of Algeria originally developed under [[Napoleon]] in 1808, [[General de Bourmont]] then landed 34,000 soldiers {{convert|27|km|mi}} west of Algiers, at [[Sidi Ferruch]], on 14 June 1830. To face the French, the dey sent 7,000 [[Janissary|janissaries]], 19,000 troops from the beys of Constantine and Oran, and about 17,000 [[Kabyles]].{{sfnp|Ruedy|2005|p=48}} The French established a strong beachhead and pushed toward Algiers, thanks in part to superior artillery and better organization. On 19 June the French defeated the dey's army at the battle of [[Staou\u00e9li]], and entered Algiers on 5 July after a three-week campaign.{{sfnp|Ruedy|2005|p=49}} The dey accepted capitulation in exchange for his freedom and the offer to retain possession of his personal wealth. Five days later, he went into exile in [[Naples]] with his family. The Turkish Janissaries also quit the territory, leaving for Turkey.<ref name=R50>{{harvp|Ruedy|2005|p=50}}</ref> The dey's departure ended 313 years of Ottoman rule of the territory.\n\nWhile the French command had nominally agreed to preserve the liberties, properties, and religious freedoms of the inhabitants, French troops immediately began plundering the city, arresting and killing people for arbitrary reasons, seizing property, and desecrating religious sites. By mid-August, the last remnants of Turkish authority were summarily deported without opportunity to liquidate significant assets.<ref name=R50/> One estimate indicates that more than fifty million francs in assets were diverted into private hands during the plunder.{{sfnp|Ruedy|2005|p=52}} This activity had a profound effect on future relations between the French occupiers and the natives.  A French commission in 1833 wrote that \"we have sent to their deaths on simple suspicion and without trial people whose guilt was always doubtful ... we massacred people carrying safe conducts ... we have outdone in barbarity the barbarians\".<ref name=R50/>  One important side effect of the expulsion of the Turks was that it created a power vacuum in significant parts of the territory, from which resistance to French occupation immediately began to arise.{{sfnp|Wagner|1854|p=235}}\nThe methods used to establish French hegemony reached [[Genocide|genocidal proportions]] and war, famine and disease led to the death of between 500,000 and 1 million of an estimated 3 million Algerians.<ref>{{cite book |first= Dominik J. |last= Schaller |editor1-first= Donald |editor1-last= Bloxham |editor2-first= A.

The new government, composed of [[French liberalism|liberal opponents]] of the Algiers expedition, was reluctant to pursue the conquest begun by the old regime.  However, the victory was enormously popular, and the new government of Louis-Philippe only withdrew a portion of the invasion force.  General Bourmont, who had sent troops to occupy B\u00f4ne and Oran, withdrew them from those places with the idea of returning to France to restore Charles to the throne.  When it was clear that his troops were not supportive of this effort, he resigned and went into exile in Spain.  Louis-Philippe replaced him with [[Bertrand Clauzel]] in September 1830.\n\nThe bey of Titteri, who had participated in the battle at Staou\u00e9li, attempted to coordinate resistance against the French with the beys of Oran and Constantine, but they were unable to agree on leadership.  Clauzel in November led a French column of 8,000 to [[M\u00e9d\u00e9a]], Titteri's capital, losing 200 men in skirmishes.  After leaving 500 men at [[Blida]] he occupied M\u00e9d\u00e9a without resistance, as the bey had retreated.  After installing a supportive bey and a garrison, he returned toward Algiers.  On arrival at Blida, he learned that the garrison there had been attacked by the Kabyles, and in resisting them, had killed some women and children, causing the town's population to rise against them.  Clauzel decided to withdraw that garrison as the force returned to Algiers.{{sfnp|Wagner|1854|pp=237-9}}\n\n==Colonization begins==\n[[File:Alg\u00e9rie fr.jpg|thumb|1877 map of the three French departments of Alger, Oran and Constantine]]\n[[File:French Algeria evolution 1830-1962 map-fr.svg|thumb|Chronological map of the French conquest.]]\nClauzel introduced a formal civil administration in Algiers, and began recruiting [[zouave]]s, or native auxiliaries to the French forces, with the goal of establishing a proper colonial presence.  He and others formed a company to acquire agricultural land and to subsidize its settlement by European farmers, triggering a [[land run|land rush]]. Clauzel recognized the farming potential of the [[Mitidja Plain]] and envisioned the production there of [[cotton]] on a large scale. During his second term as governor general (1835&ndash;36), he used his office to make private investments in land and encouraged army officers and bureaucrats in his administration to do the same. This development created a vested interest among government officials in greater French involvement in Algeria. Commercial interests with influence in the government also began to recognize the prospects for profitable land speculation in expanding the French zone of occupation. Over a ten-year period they created large agricultural tracts, built factories and businesses, and bought cheap local labor.\n\nClauzel also attempted to extend French influence into Oran and Constantine by negotiating with the bey of Tunis to supply \"local\" rulers that would operate under French administration.  The bey refused, seeing the obvious conflicts inherent in the idea.  The French foreign ministry objected to negotiations Clauzel conducted with Morocco over the establishment of a Moroccan bey in Oran, and in early 1831 replaced him with [[Pierre Berthe\u00e9ne, Baron Berthez\u00e8ne|Baron Berthez\u00e8ne]].\n\nBerthez\u00e8ne was a weak administrator opposed to colonisation.{{sfnp|Wagner|1854|p= 240}}  His worst military failure came when he was called to support the bey at M\u00e9d\u00e9a, whose support for the French and corruption had turned the population there against him. Berthez\u00e8ne led troops to M\u00e9d\u00e9a in June 1831 to extract the bey and the French garrison.  On their way back to Algiers they were continually harassed by Kabyle resistance, and driven into a panicked retreat that Berthez\u00e8ne failed to control.  French casualties during this retreat were significant (nearly 300), and the victory fanned the flames of resistance, leading to attacks on colonial settlements.{{sfnp|Wagner|1854|pp= 241-3}} The growing colonial financial interests began insisting on a stronger hand, which Louis-Philippe provided in [[Anne Jean Marie Ren\u00e9 Savary|Duke Rovigo]] at the end of 1831.\n\nRovigo regained control of [[B\u00f4ne]] and Bougie (present-day [[B\u00e9ja\u00efa]]), cities that Clauzel had taken and then lost due to resistance by the [[Kabyle people]]. He continued policies of colonisation of the land and expropriation of properties.  His suppression of resistance in Algiers was brutal, with the military presence extended into its neighborhoods.  He was recalled in 1833 due to the overtly violent nature of the repression, and replaced by [[Th\u00e9ophile Voirol, Baron Voirol|Baron Voirol]].  Voirol successfully established French occupation in Oran, and another French general, [[Louis Alexis Desmichels]], was given an independent command that gained control over [[Arzew]] and [[Mostaganem]].\n\nOn 22 June 1834, France formally annexed the occupied areas of Algeria, which had an estimated Muslim population of about two million, as a military [[colony]].  The colony was run by a military governor who had both civilian and military authority, including the power of executive decree. His authority was nominally over an area of \"limited occupation\" near the coast, but the realities of French colonial expansion beyond those areas ensured continued resistance from the local population.  The policy of limited occupation was formally abandoned in 1840 for one of complete control.\n\nVoirol was replaced in 1834 by [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon]], who became the first governor of the colony, and who was given the task of dealing with the rising threat of [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|`Abd al-Q\u0101dir]] and continuing French failures to subdue [[Ahmed Bey]], Constantine's ruler.\n\n==Rise of Abdul Kader==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}\nThe superior of a religious brotherhood, [[Muhyi ad Din]], who had spent time in Ottoman jails for opposing the bey's rule, launched attacks against the French and their [[makhzen]] allies at Oran in 1832. In the same year, tribal elders in the territories near [[Mascara, Algeria|Mascara]] chose Muhyi ad Din's son, twenty-five-year-old `Abd al-Q\u0101dir, to take his place leading the [[jihad]]. Abd al-Q\u0101dir, who was recognized as [[Amir al-Muminin]] (commander of the faithful), quickly gained the support of tribes in the western territories.  In 1834 he concluded a [[Treaty of Desmichels|treaty with General Desmichels]], who was then military commander of the province of Oran.  In the treaty, which was reluctantly accepted by the French administration, France recognized Abd al-Q\u0101dir as the sovereign of territories in Oran province not under French control, and authorized Abd al-Q\u0101dir to send consuls to French-held cities.  The treaty did not require Abd al-Q\u0101dir to recognize French rule, something glossed over in its French text.  Abd al-Q\u0101dir used the peace provided by this treaty to widen his influence with tribes throughout western and central Algeria.\n\nWhile d'Erlon was apparently unaware of the danger posed by Abd al-Q\u0101dir's activities, General [[Camille Alphonse Tr\u00e9zel]], then in command at Oran, did see it, and attempted to separate some of the tribes from Abd al-Q\u0101dir.  When he succeeded in convincing two tribes near Oran to acknowledge French supremacy, Abd al-Q\u0101dir dispatched troops to move those tribes to the interior, away from French influence.  Tr\u00e9zel countered by marching a column of troops out from Oran to protect the territory of those tribes on 16 June 1835.  After exchanging threats, Abd al-Q\u0101dir withdrew his consul from Oran and ejected the French consul from Mascara, a ''de facto'' declaration of war.  The two forces clashed in a bloody but inconclusive engagement near the [[Sig River]].  However, when the French, who were short on provisions, began withdrawing toward Arzew, Abd al-Q\u0101dir led 20,000 men against the beleaguered column, and in the [[Battle of Macta]] routed the force, killing 500 men.  The debacle led to the recall of Comte d'Erlon.\n\nGeneral Clausel was appointed a second time to replace d'Erlon.  He led an attack against [[Mascara, Algeria|Mascara]] in December of that year, which Abd al-Q\u0101dir, with advance warning, had evacuated.  In January 1836 Clausel occupied [[Tlemcen]], and established a garrison there before return to Algiers to plan an attack against [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]].  Abd al-Q\u0101dir continued to harry the French at Tlemcen, so additional troops under [[Thomas Robert Bugeaud]], a veteran of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] who was experienced in irregular warfare, were sent from Oran to secure control up to the [[Tafna]] River and to resupply the garrison.  Abd al-Q\u0101dir retreated before Bugeaud, but decided to make a stand on the banks of the [[Sikkak]] River.  On July 6, 1836, Bugeaud decisively defeated al-Q\u0101dir in the [[Battle of Sikkak]], losing less than fifty men to more than 1,000 casualties suffered by Abd al-Q\u0101dir.  The battle was one of the few formal battles al-Q\u0101dir engaged in; after this defeat he restricted his actions as much as possible to guerrilla-style attacks.\n\n==Constantine==\n[[File:Expeditionconstantine.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Constantine]] in November 1836]]\nAhmed Bey had continuously resisted any attempts by the French or others to subjugate Constantine, and continued to play a role in resistance against French rule, in part because he hoped to eventually become the next dey.  Clausel and Ahmed had tangled diplomatically over Ahmed's refusal to recognize French authority over B\u00f4ne, which he considered to still be Ottoman territory, and Clausel decided to move against him.  In November 1836 Clausel led 8,700 men into the Constantine beylik, but was repulsed in the [[Battle of Constantine]]; the failure led to Clausel's recall.  He was replaced by [[Charles Marie Denys, comte de Damr\u00e9mont|the Comte de Damr\u00e9mont]], who led an expedition that successfully [[Capture of Constantine|captured Constantine]] the following year, although he was killed during the siege and replaced by [[Sylvain Charles Val\u00e9e|Sylvain Charles, comte Val\u00e9e]].\n\n==Abd Al-Q\u0101dir's resistance renewed==\n{{Main|Pacification of Algeria}}\n[[File:D\u00e9fense de Mazagran.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Mazagran]] in 1840]]\n[[File:Bataille de sidi brahim 1845 26 septembre.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Sidi Brahim]] in 1845]]\nIn May 1837, General [[Thomas Robert Bugeaud]], then in command of Oran, negotiated the [[Treaty of Tafna]] with Abd al-Q\u0101dir, in which he effectively recognized Abd al-Q\u0101dir's control over much of the interior of what is now Algeria. Abd Al-Q\u0101dir used the treaty to consolidate his power over tribes throughout the interior, establishing new cities far from French control. He worked to motivate the population under French control to resist by peaceful and military means.  Seeking to again face the French, he laid claim under the treaty to territory that included the main route between Algiers and Constantine.  When French troops contested this claim in late 1839 by marching through a mountain defile known as the Iron Gates, Abd al-Q\u0101dir claimed a breach of the treaty, and renewed calls for jihad.  Throughout 1840 he waged guerrilla war against the French in the provinces of Algiers and Oran.  Val\u00e9e's failures to end the war led to his replacement in December 1840 by General Bugeaud.\n\nBugeaud instituted a strategy of [[scorched earth]], combined with fast-moving cavalry columns not unlike those used by Abd al-Q\u0101dir to progressively take territory from Abd al-Q\u0101dir.  The troops' tactics were heavy-handed, and the population suffered significantly. Abd Al-Q\u0101dir was eventually forced to establish a mobile headquarters that was known as a ''smala'' or ''zmelah''.  In 1843 French forces successfully [[Battle of the Smala|raided this camp]] while he was away from it, capturing more than 5,000 fighters and Abd al-Q\u0101dir's warchest.\n\nAbd Al-Q\u0101dir was forced to retreat into Morocco, from which he had been receiving some support, especially from tribes in the border areas.  When French diplomatic efforts to convince Morocco to expel Abd al-Q\u0101dir failed, the French resorted to military means with the [[First Franco-Moroccan War]] in 1844 to compel the sultan to change his policy.\n\nEventually hemmed between French and Moroccan troops on the border in December 1847, Abd al-Q\u0101dir chose to surrender to the French, under terms that he be allowed to enter exile in the Middle East.  The French violated these terms, holding him in France until 1852, when he was allowed to go to [[Damascus]].\n\nThe Ottomans lodged a formal protest over the invasion of Algeria, but they never conceded the loss of the province. A map of \"Ottoman Africa\" from 1905 still shows the empire as possessing a border with Morocco to the west of the \"region\" (''hitta'', a term for a territory with vague borders) of Algeria.<ref name=\"Hanio\u011flu2010\">{{cite book|last=Hanio\u011flu|first=M. \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc|title=A Brief History of the Late Ottoman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nK5ZDKf3JgkC|year=2010|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=1-4008-2968-2|pages=9\u201310, 69|ref= harv}}</ref>\n\n{{wide image|Prise de la smalah d Abd-El-Kader a Taguin 16 mai 1843 Horace Vernet.jpg|800px|''[[Battle of the Smala|Capture of the Smala of Abd El-Kader]], 16 May 1843'' by [[Horace Vernet]]}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=notes}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|title=A history of the Maghrib in the Islamic period|first=Jamil|last=Abun-Nasr|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1987|isbn=978-0-521-33767-0|ref= harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Greenhalgh|first=Michael|title=The Military and Colonial Destruction of the Roman Landscape of North Africa, 1830-1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5pCfAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA366|year=2014|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-27163-0|ref= harv}}\n*{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BOopmtvrsOAC&lpg=PA33&dq=Berthezene%20Rovigo&pg=PA34#v=onepage&q=Berthezene%20Rovigo&f=false|title=France Overseas: a Study of Modern Imperialism |first=Herbert Ingram |last=Priestley|publisher=Routledge|year=1966|isbn=978-0-7146-1024-5 |ref= harv}}\n*{{cite book|title=Modern Algeria: The Origins and Development of a Nation|first=John Douglas|last=Ruedy|year=2005|edition=2nd|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|location=Bloomington, Indiana|isbn=978-0-253-21782-0|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Tucker|first=Spencer C.|title=A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h5_tSnygvbIC|date= 2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-672-5 |ref= harv}}\n*{{cite book|title=The Tricolor on the Atlas: or, Algeria and the French conquest|first=Moritz|last=Wagner|translator=Pulszky, Francis |publisher=T.

In 1827, an argument between [[Hussein Dey]], the ruler of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Regency of Algiers]], and the French [[consul (representative)|consul]] escalated into a [[naval blockade]], following which [[July Monarchy|France]] invaded and quickly seized [[Algiers]] in 1830, and rapidly took control of other coastal communities. Amid internal political strife in France, decisions were repeatedly taken to retain control over the territory, and additional military forces were brought in over the following years to quell resistance in the interior of the country.\n\nAlgerian resistance forces were divided between forces under [[Ahmed Bey ben Mohamed Ch\u00e9rif]] at [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]], primarily in the east, and nationalist forces in [[Kabylie]] and the west. Treaties with the nationalists under [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|`Abd al-Q\u0101dir]] enabled the French to first focus on the elimination of the remaining Ottoman threat, achieved with the 1837 capture of Constantine. Abd Al-Q\u0101dir continued to give stiff resistance in the west. Finally driven into [[Morocco]] in 1842, by large-scale and heavy-handed French military action, he continued to wage a [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] until the [[Moroccan government]], under French diplomatic pressure following its defeat in the [[First Franco-Moroccan War]], drove him out of Morocco. He surrendered to French forces in 1847.\n\n== Background information ==\n\nThe territory now known as [[Algeria]] was only partially under the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s control in 1830. The [[dey]] ruled the entire [[Regency of Algiers]], but only exercised direct control in and around [[Algiers]], with [[Bey]]liks established in a few outlying areas, including [[Oran]] and [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]]. The remainder of the territory (including much of the interior), while nominally Ottoman, was effectively under the control of local Arab leaders. The dey acted largely independently of the Ottoman Emperor, although he was supported by (or controlled by, depending on historical perspective) Turkish [[Janissary]] troops stationed in Algiers. The territory was bordered to the west by the [[Sultanate of Morocco]] and to the east by the Ottoman [[History of Ottoman-era Tunisia|Regency of Tunis]]. The western border, the {{ILL|Tafna|fr}} River, was particularly porous since there were shared tribal connections that crossed it.\n\nThe Regency of Algiers was one of the main bases of the [[Barbary pirate]]s and [[Barbary Slave Trade]]rs who attacked Christian ships and coastal settlements in the [[Mediterranean]] and North [[Atlantic (ocean)|Atlantic]]. Like the rest of the [[Barbary Coast]], the Regency of Algiers lived from the trade of slaves or goods captured from [[Europe]], [[United States|America]] and [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. The European powers bombarded Algiers on different occasions in retaliation and the United States provoked the [[Barbary Wars]] in order to put an end to Algerian privateering against Christian shipping.<ref>{{Cite news | first=Robert | last=Carver| title=Not so easy alliances: ''Two Faiths, One Banner: When Muslims Marched with Christians Across Europe\u2019s Battlegrounds'' |type= Book review | url=http://www.thetablet.co.uk/review/442| work= Tablet | location= | page= 24 | date=25 April 2009 |url-status= dead |archive-date= 29 June 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629033728/http://www.thetablet.co.uk/review/442}}</ref>\n\nThe conquest of Algeria began in the last days of the [[Bourbon Restoration]] by [[Charles X of France]]. It aimed to put a definite end to Barbary privateering and increase the king's popularity among the French people, particularly in Paris, where many veterans of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] lived. Algerian slave trade and piracy immediately ceased after the French conquered Algiers.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Barbary Pirates}}</ref>\n\n=== Fan Affair ===\n<!-- This section is referenced in the Algeria article. Don't change the title without updating links. -->\nIn 1795\u201396, the French Republic contracted to purchase wheat for the French army from two Jewish merchants in Algiers, and Charles X was apparently uninterested in paying the Republic's debt. The merchants, who had debts to [[Hussein Dey]], the Ottoman ruler of Algiers, claimed inability to pay those debts until France paid its debts to them. The dey unsuccessfully negotiated with [[Pierre Deval (diplomat)|Pierre Deval]], the French consul, to rectify this situation, and suspected Deval of collaborating with the merchants against him, especially since the French government made no provision to pay the merchants in 1820.  Deval's nephew Alexandre, the consul in [[B\u00f4ne]], further angered the dey by fortifying French storehouses in B\u00f4ne and [[El Kala|La Calle]] despite prior agreements.{{sfnp|Abun-Nasr|1987|p=249}}\n\n[[File:Le coup d eventail 1827.jpg|thumb|left|The \"Fan Affair\", which escalated into the invasion.]]\nAfter a contentious meeting on 29 April 1827 in which Deval refused to provide satisfactory answers, the dey struck Deval with his [[fly-whisk]] (then called a [[Hand fan|fan]]). Charles X used this slight against his diplomatic representative to first demand an apology from the dey, and then to initiate a blockade against the port of Algiers. The blockade lasted for three years, and was primarily to the detriment of French merchants who were unable to do business with Algiers, while Barbary pirates were still able to evade the blockade.  When France in 1829 sent an ambassador to the dey with a proposal for negotiations, he responded with cannon fire directed toward one of the blockading ships. The French then decided that more forceful action was required.{{sfnp|Abun-Nasr|1987|p=250}}\n\nFollowing the failure of the ambassador's visit, Charles appointed as President [[Jules, Prince de Polignac]], a hardline conservative. This outraged the liberal French opposition, which then had a majority in the [[Chamber of Deputies of France|Chamber of Deputies]]. Polignac opened negotiations with [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] to essentially divide up North Africa. Ali, although nominally a vassal of the Ottomans, eventually rejected this idea. As popular opinion continued to rise against Polignac and the King, they decided that a foreign policy victory such as the capture of Algiers would turn opinion in their favour again.{{sfnp|Ruedy|2005|p=47}}\n\n==Invasion of Algiers==\n{{main|Invasion of Algiers in 1830}}\n[[Image:D\u00e9barquement en Alg\u00e9rie 09665.jpg|thumb|At Sidi-Ferruch by [[Pierre-Julien Gilbert]].]]\n[[File:Bombardementd alger-1830.jpg|thumb|The attack of [[Admiral Duperr\u00e9]] during the taking of Algiers in 1830.]]\n[[File:Ottoman cannon end of 16th century length 385cm cal 178mm weight 2910 stone projectile founded 8 October 1581 Alger seized 1830.jpg|thumb|Ornate [[Ottoman weapons|Ottoman cannon]], length: 385cm, cal:178mm, weight: 2910, stone projectile, founded 8 October 1581 in Algiers, seized by France at Algiers in 1830.

Following a plan for the invasion of Algeria originally developed under [[Napoleon]] in 1808, [[General de Bourmont]] then landed 34,000 soldiers {{convert|27|km|mi}} west of Algiers, at [[Sidi Ferruch]], on 14 June 1830. To face the French, the dey sent 7,000 [[Janissary|janissaries]], 19,000 troops from the beys of Constantine and Oran, and about 17,000 [[Kabyles]].{{sfnp|Ruedy|2005|p=48}} The French established a strong beachhead and pushed toward Algiers, thanks in part to superior artillery and better organization. On 19 June the French defeated the dey's army at the battle of [[Staou\u00e9li]], and entered Algiers on 5 July after a three-week campaign.{{sfnp|Ruedy|2005|p=49}} The dey accepted capitulation in exchange for his freedom and the offer to retain possession of his personal wealth. Five days later, he went into exile in [[Naples]] with his family. The Turkish Janissaries also quit the territory, leaving for Turkey.<ref name=R50>{{harvp|Ruedy|2005|p=50}}</ref> The dey's departure ended 313 years of Ottoman rule of the territory.\n\nWhile the French command had nominally agreed to preserve the liberties, properties, and religious freedoms of the inhabitants, French troops immediately began plundering the city, arresting and killing people for arbitrary reasons, seizing property, and desecrating religious sites. By mid-August, the last remnants of Turkish authority were summarily deported without opportunity to liquidate significant assets.<ref name=R50/> One estimate indicates that more than fifty million francs in assets were diverted into private hands during the plunder.{{sfnp|Ruedy|2005|p=52}} This activity had a profound effect on future relations between the French occupiers and the natives.

The new government, composed of [[French liberalism|liberal opponents]] of the Algiers expedition, was reluctant to pursue the conquest begun by the old regime.  However, the victory was enormously popular, and the new government of Louis-Philippe only withdrew a portion of the invasion force.  General Bourmont, who had sent troops to occupy B\u00f4ne and Oran, withdrew them from those places with the idea of returning to France to restore Charles to the throne.  When it was clear that his troops were not supportive of this effort, he resigned and went into exile in Spain.  Louis-Philippe replaced him with [[Bertrand Clauzel]] in September 1830.\n\nThe bey of Titteri, who had participated in the battle at Staou\u00e9li, attempted to coordinate resistance against the French with the beys of Oran and Constantine, but they were unable to agree on leadership.  Clauzel in November led a French column of 8,000 to [[M\u00e9d\u00e9a]], Titteri's capital, losing 200 men in skirmishes.  After leaving 500 men at [[Blida]] he occupied M\u00e9d\u00e9a without resistance, as the bey had retreated.  After installing a supportive bey and a garrison, he returned toward Algiers.  On arrival at Blida, he learned that the garrison there had been attacked by the Kabyles, and in resisting them, had killed some women and children, causing the town's population to rise against them.  Clauzel decided to withdraw that garrison as the force returned to Algiers.{{sfnp|Wagner|1854|pp=237-9}}\n\n==Colonization begins==\n[[File:Alg\u00e9rie fr.jpg|thumb|1877 map of the three French departments of Alger, Oran and Constantine]]\n[[File:French Algeria evolution 1830-1962 map-fr.svg|thumb|Chronological map of the French conquest.]]\nClauzel introduced a formal civil administration in Algiers, and began recruiting [[zouave]]s, or native auxiliaries to the French forces, with the goal of establishing a proper colonial presence.  He and others formed a company to acquire agricultural land and to subsidize its settlement by European farmers, triggering a [[land run|land rush]]. Clauzel recognized the farming potential of the [[Mitidja Plain]] and envisioned the production there of [[cotton]] on a large scale. During his second term as governor general (1835&ndash;36), he used his office to make private investments in land and encouraged army officers and bureaucrats in his administration to do the same. This development created a vested interest among government officials in greater French involvement in Algeria. Commercial interests with influence in the government also began to recognize the prospects for profitable land speculation in expanding the French zone of occupation. Over a ten-year period they created large agricultural tracts, built factories and businesses, and bought cheap local labor.\n\nClauzel also attempted to extend French influence into Oran and Constantine by negotiating with the bey of Tunis to supply \"local\" rulers that would operate under French administration.  The bey refused, seeing the obvious conflicts inherent in the idea.  The French foreign ministry objected to negotiations Clauzel conducted with Morocco over the establishment of a Moroccan bey in Oran, and in early 1831 replaced him with [[Pierre Berthe\u00e9ne, Baron Berthez\u00e8ne|Baron Berthez\u00e8ne]].\n\nBerthez\u00e8ne was a weak administrator opposed to colonisation.{{sfnp|Wagner|1854|p= 240}}  His worst military failure came when he was called to support the bey at M\u00e9d\u00e9a, whose support for the French and corruption had turned the population there against him. Berthez\u00e8ne led troops to M\u00e9d\u00e9a in June 1831 to extract the bey and the French garrison.  On their way back to Algiers they were continually harassed by Kabyle resistance, and driven into a panicked retreat that Berthez\u00e8ne failed to control.  French casualties during this retreat were significant (nearly 300), and the victory fanned the flames of resistance, leading to attacks on colonial settlements.{{sfnp|Wagner|1854|pp= 241-3}} The growing colonial financial interests began insisting on a stronger hand, which Louis-Philippe provided in [[Anne Jean Marie Ren\u00e9 Savary|Duke Rovigo]] at the end of 1831.\n\nRovigo regained control of [[B\u00f4ne]] and Bougie (present-day [[B\u00e9ja\u00efa]]), cities that Clauzel had taken and then lost due to resistance by the [[Kabyle people]]. He continued policies of colonisation of the land and expropriation of properties.  His suppression of resistance in Algiers was brutal, with the military presence extended into its neighborhoods.  He was recalled in 1833 due to the overtly violent nature of the repression, and replaced by [[Th\u00e9ophile Voirol, Baron Voirol|Baron Voirol]].  Voirol successfully established French occupation in Oran, and another French general, [[Louis Alexis Desmichels]], was given an independent command that gained control over [[Arzew]] and [[Mostaganem]].\n\nOn 22 June 1834, France formally annexed the occupied areas of Algeria, which had an estimated Muslim population of about two million, as a military [[colony]].  The colony was run by a military governor who had both civilian and military authority, including the power of executive decree. His authority was nominally over an area of \"limited occupation\" near the coast, but the realities of French colonial expansion beyond those areas ensured continued resistance from the local population.  The policy of limited occupation was formally abandoned in 1840 for one of complete control.\n\nVoirol was replaced in 1834 by [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon]], who became the first governor of the colony, and who was given the task of dealing with the rising threat of [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|`Abd al-Q\u0101dir]] and continuing French failures to subdue [[Ahmed Bey]], Constantine's ruler.\n\n==Rise of Abdul Kader==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}\nThe superior of a religious brotherhood, [[Muhyi ad Din]], who had spent time in Ottoman jails for opposing the bey's rule, launched attacks against the French and their [[makhzen]] allies at Oran in 1832. In the same year, tribal elders in the territories near [[Mascara, Algeria|Mascara]] chose Muhyi ad Din's son, twenty-five-year-old `Abd al-Q\u0101dir, to take his place leading the [[jihad]]. Abd al-Q\u0101dir, who was recognized as [[Amir al-Muminin]] (commander of the faithful), quickly gained the support of tribes in the western territories.  In 1834 he concluded a [[Treaty of Desmichels|treaty with General Desmichels]], who was then military commander of the province of Oran.  In the treaty, which was reluctantly accepted by the French administration, France recognized Abd al-Q\u0101dir as the sovereign of territories in Oran province not under French control, and authorized Abd al-Q\u0101dir to send consuls to French-held cities.  The treaty did not require Abd al-Q\u0101dir to recognize French rule, something glossed over in its French text.  Abd al-Q\u0101dir used the peace provided by this treaty to widen his influence with tribes throughout western and central Algeria.\n\nWhile d'Erlon was apparently unaware of the danger posed by Abd al-Q\u0101dir's activities, General [[Camille Alphonse Tr\u00e9zel]], then in command at Oran, did see it, and attempted to separate some of the tribes from Abd al-Q\u0101dir.  When he succeeded in convincing two tribes near Oran to acknowledge French supremacy, Abd al-Q\u0101dir dispatched troops to move those tribes to the interior, away from French influence.  Tr\u00e9zel countered by marching a column of troops out from Oran to protect the territory of those tribes on 16 June 1835.  After exchanging threats, Abd al-Q\u0101dir withdrew his consul from Oran and ejected the French consul from Mascara, a ''de facto'' declaration of war.  The two forces clashed in a bloody but inconclusive engagement near the [[Sig River]].  However, when the French, who were short on provisions, began withdrawing toward Arzew, Abd al-Q\u0101dir led 20,000 men against the beleaguered column, and in the [[Battle of Macta]] routed the force, killing 500 men.  The debacle led to the recall of Comte d'Erlon.\n\nGeneral Clausel was appointed a second time to replace d'Erlon.  He led an attack against [[Mascara, Algeria|Mascara]] in December of that year, which Abd al-Q\u0101dir, with advance warning, had evacuated.  In January 1836 Clausel occupied [[Tlemcen]], and established a garrison there before return to Algiers to plan an attack against [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]].  Abd al-Q\u0101dir continued to harry the French at Tlemcen, so additional troops under [[Thomas Robert Bugeaud]], a veteran of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] who was experienced in irregular warfare, were sent from Oran to secure control up to the [[Tafna]] River and to resupply the garrison.  Abd al-Q\u0101dir retreated before Bugeaud, but decided to make a stand on the banks of the [[Sikkak]] River.  On July 6, 1836, Bugeaud decisively defeated al-Q\u0101dir in the [[Battle of Sikkak]], losing less than fifty men to more than 1,000 casualties suffered by Abd al-Q\u0101dir.  The battle was one of the few formal battles al-Q\u0101dir engaged in; after this defeat he restricted his actions as much as possible to guerrilla-style attacks.\n\n==Constantine==\n[[File:Expeditionconstantine.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Constantine]] in November 1836]]\nAhmed Bey had continuously resisted any attempts by the French or others to subjugate Constantine, and continued to play a role in resistance against French rule, in part because he hoped to eventually become the next dey.  Clausel and Ahmed had tangled diplomatically over Ahmed's refusal to recognize French authority over B\u00f4ne, which he considered to still be Ottoman territory, and Clausel decided to move against him.  In November 1836 Clausel led 8,700 men into the Constantine beylik, but was repulsed in the [[Battle of Constantine]]; the failure led to Clausel's recall.  He was replaced by [[Charles Marie Denys, comte de Damr\u00e9mont|the Comte de Damr\u00e9mont]], who led an expedition that successfully [[Capture of Constantine|captured Constantine]] the following year, although he was killed during the siege and replaced by [[Sylvain Charles Val\u00e9e|Sylvain Charles, comte Val\u00e9e]].\n\n==Abd Al-Q\u0101dir's resistance renewed==\n{{Main|Pacification of Algeria}}\n[[File:D\u00e9fense de Mazagran.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Mazagran]] in 1840]]\n[[File:Bataille de sidi brahim 1845 26 septembre.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Sidi Brahim]] in 1845]]\nIn May 1837, General [[Thomas Robert Bugeaud]], then in command of Oran, negotiated the [[Treaty of Tafna]] with Abd al-Q\u0101dir, in which he effectively recognized Abd al-Q\u0101dir's control over much of the interior of what is now Algeria. Abd Al-Q\u0101dir used the treaty to consolidate his power over tribes throughout the interior, establishing new cities far from French control. He worked to motivate the population under French control to resist by peaceful and military means.  Seeking to again face the French, he laid claim under the treaty to territory that included the main route between Algiers and Constantine.  When French troops contested this claim in late 1839 by marching through a mountain defile known as the Iron Gates, Abd al-Q\u0101dir claimed a breach of the treaty, and renewed calls for jihad.  Throughout 1840 he waged guerrilla war against the French in the provinces of Algiers and Oran.  Val\u00e9e's failures to end the war led to his replacement in December 1840 by General Bugeaud.\n\nBugeaud instituted a strategy of [[scorched earth]], combined with fast-moving cavalry columns not unlike those used by Abd al-Q\u0101dir to progressively take territory from Abd al-Q\u0101dir.  The troops' tactics were heavy-handed, and the population suffered significantly. Abd Al-Q\u0101dir was eventually forced to establish a mobile headquarters that was known as a ''smala'' or ''zmelah''.  In 1843 French forces successfully [[Battle of the Smala|raided this camp]] while he was away from it, capturing more than 5,000 fighters and Abd al-Q\u0101dir's warchest.\n\nAbd Al-Q\u0101dir was forced to retreat into Morocco, from which he had been receiving some support, especially from tribes in the border areas.  When French diplomatic efforts to convince Morocco to expel Abd al-Q\u0101dir failed, the French resorted to military means with the [[First Franco-Moroccan War]] in 1844 to compel the sultan to change his policy.\n\nEventually hemmed between French and Moroccan troops on the border in December 1847, Abd al-Q\u0101dir chose to surrender to the French, under terms that he be allowed to enter exile in the Middle East.  The French violated these terms, holding him in France until 1852, when he was allowed to go to [[Damascus]].\n\nThe Ottomans lodged a formal protest over the invasion of Algeria, but they never conceded the loss of the province. A map of \"Ottoman Africa\" from 1905 still shows the empire as possessing a border with Morocco to the west of the \"region\" (''hitta'', a term for a territory with vague borders) of Algeria.<ref name=\"Hanio\u011flu2010\">{{cite book|last=Hanio\u011flu|first=M. \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc|title=A Brief History of the Late Ottoman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nK5ZDKf3JgkC|year=2010|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=1-4008-2968-2|pages=9\u201310, 69|ref= harv}}</ref>\n\n{{wide image|Prise de la smalah d Abd-El-Kader a Taguin 16 mai 1843 Horace Vernet.jpg|800px|''[[Battle of the Smala|Capture of the Smala of Abd El-Kader]], 16 May 1843'' by [[Horace Vernet]]}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=notes}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|title=A history of the Maghrib in the Islamic period|first=Jamil|last=Abun-Nasr|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1987|isbn=978-0-521-33767-0|ref= harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Greenhalgh|first=Michael|title=The Military and Colonial Destruction of the Roman Landscape of North Africa, 1830-1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5pCfAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA366|year=2014|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-27163-0|ref= harv}}\n*{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BOopmtvrsOAC&lpg=PA33&dq=Berthezene%20Rovigo&pg=PA34#v=onepage&q=Berthezene%20Rovigo&f=false|title=France Overseas: a Study of Modern Imperialism |first=Herbert Ingram |last=Priestley|publisher=Routledge|year=1966|isbn=978-0-7146-1024-5 |ref= harv}}\n*{{cite book|title=Modern Algeria: The Origins and Development of a Nation|first=John Douglas|last=Ruedy|year=2005|edition=2nd|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|location=Bloomington, Indiana|isbn=978-0-253-21782-0|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Tucker|first=Spencer C.|title=A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h5_tSnygvbIC|date= 2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-672-5 |ref= harv}}\n*{{cite book|title=The Tricolor on the Atlas: or, Algeria and the French conquest|first=Moritz|last=Wagner|translator=Pulszky, Francis |publisher=T.

The cruisers departed Japanese-held territory on 1&nbsp;March with the support of other IJN vessels and aircraft. On 9&nbsp;March, they encountered and sank the British [[Steamboat|steamer]] ''Behar'', with the heavy cruiser {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Tone|1937|2}} picking up over 100 survivors. Fearing detection, the Japanese force subsequently returned to the [[Netherlands East Indies]] (NEI), arriving on 16&nbsp;March. Two days later, most of ''Behar''{{'}}s crew and passengers were murdered on board ''Tone''.

The appearance of a powerful Japanese naval force at Singapore concerned the Allies, as it was feared that these ships could potentially conduct raids in the Indian Ocean and against [[Western Australia]].<ref>Odgers (1968), pp. 134\u2013135</ref> In response, the Allies strengthened their naval and air forces in the area by transferring two British [[light cruiser]]s from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] as well as several [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] warships from the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. The number of air units in [[Ceylon]] and the [[Bay of Bengal]] region was also increased.<ref>Gill (1968), p. 387</ref> Admiral [[James Somerville]], the commander of the British [[Eastern Fleet]], feared that the Japanese would repeat their devastating [[Indian Ocean raid]] of early 1942, and on 25&nbsp;February requested permission to withdraw his fleet from its base at [[Trincomalee]] so that it was not at risk from the larger Japanese force. The [[Admiralty]] rejected this request, and directed that the fleet should remain at Trincomalee unless it was threatened by a superior Japanese force as its withdrawal would affect morale and harm Britain's prestige in the region. It was agreed, however, that the Eastern Fleet should not engage superior Japanese forces and could withdraw if Somerville judged this necessary.<ref name=\"Gill_388\">Gill (1968), p. 388</ref>\n\nIn late February, Vice-Admiral [[Shiro Takasu]]\u2014the Commander in Chief, [[Southwest Area Fleet]]\u2014ordered the heavy cruisers {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Aoba||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese cruiser |Chikuma|1938|2}}, and {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Tone|1937|2}} to raid Allied shipping on the main route between [[Aden]] and [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]]. This force was commanded by Rear Admiral Naomasa Sakonju on board ''Aoba''. In his instructions to Sakonju, Vice Admiral Takasu directed that if the force captured Allied merchant seamen all prisoners, other than radio operators and other personnel who might possess useful information, were to be killed.<ref name=\"Gill_388\"/> Sakonju did not question this order.

In this message Sakonju ordered that the survivors be killed. Mayuzumi was unwilling to do so, however, as he felt that this would violate his Christian religious beliefs. His executive officer, Commander Junsuke Mii, also opposed killing the prisoners. Mayuzumi radioed a request to Sakonju that the prisoners be put ashore, but this was rejected. The captain then visited ''Aoba'' to argue his case, but Sakonju remained unmoved and told Mayuzumi to \"obey my orders\".

The raid failed to disrupt Allied traffic in the region as the diversions ordered by Somerville on 8 March were rescinded by the 16th. The only tangible result was the sinking of one ship,  the ''Behar''; by contrast Axis submarines [[Indian Ocean in World War II#1944|sank three ships]] in the Indian Ocean during the same period. The raid was also less successful than comparable raids by surface ships in the region, such as that of the [[German cruiser Admiral Scheer|''Admiral Scheer'']] in 1941. The Japanese made no attempt to capitalize on their numerical superiority in the region and by the end of the month it had vanished; reinforcements to the Eastern Fleet enabled Somerville to start  a series of carrier raids, commencing with the [[Operation Cockpit|attack on Sabang]] on 19 April 1944.<ref>Roskill (1960), p. 354-6</ref>\n\nThe party of ''Behar'' survivors who had been landed at Tanjung Priok were initially interned in [[prisoner of war]] camps in Java; the male prisoners were sent to a camp near [[Jakarta|Batavia]] and the women were held in a female camp nearby.

The cruisers departed Japanese-held territory on 1&nbsp;March with the support of other IJN vessels and aircraft. On 9&nbsp;March, they encountered and sank the British [[Steamboat|steamer]] ''Behar'', with the heavy cruiser {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Tone|1937|2}} picking up over 100 survivors. Fearing detection, the Japanese force subsequently returned to the [[Netherlands East Indies]] (NEI), arriving on 16&nbsp;March. Two days later, most of ''Behar''{{'}}s crew and passengers were murdered on board ''Tone''. Following the war the commander of the raid, Rear Admiral [[Naomasa Sakonju]], was executed for this [[war crime]] and ''Tone''{{'}}s captain Haruo Mayuzumi ([[:ja:\u9edb\u6cbb\u592b]]) was sentenced to seven years imprisonment.\n\n==Background==\nIn February 1944, the Japanese [[Combined Fleet]] withdrew from its base at [[Chuuk State|Truk]] in the Central [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] to [[Palau]] and [[Singapore]]. The appearance of a powerful Japanese naval force at Singapore concerned the Allies, as it was feared that these ships could potentially conduct raids in the Indian Ocean and against [[Western Australia]].<ref>Odgers (1968), pp. 134\u2013135</ref> In response, the Allies strengthened their naval and air forces in the area by transferring two British [[light cruiser]]s from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] as well as several [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] warships from the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. The number of air units in [[Ceylon]] and the [[Bay of Bengal]] region was also increased.<ref>Gill (1968), p. 387</ref> Admiral [[James Somerville]], the commander of the British [[Eastern Fleet]], feared that the Japanese would repeat their devastating [[Indian Ocean raid]] of early 1942, and on 25&nbsp;February requested permission to withdraw his fleet from its base at [[Trincomalee]] so that it was not at risk from the larger Japanese force. The [[Admiralty]] rejected this request, and directed that the fleet should remain at Trincomalee unless it was threatened by a superior Japanese force as its withdrawal would affect morale and harm Britain's prestige in the region. It was agreed, however, that the Eastern Fleet should not engage superior Japanese forces and could withdraw if Somerville judged this necessary.<ref name=\"Gill_388\">Gill (1968), p. 388</ref>\n\nIn late February, Vice-Admiral [[Shiro Takasu]]\u2014the Commander in Chief, [[Southwest Area Fleet]]\u2014ordered the heavy cruisers {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Aoba||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese cruiser |Chikuma|1938|2}}, and {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Tone|1937|2}} to raid Allied shipping on the main route between [[Aden]] and [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]]. This force was commanded by Rear Admiral Naomasa Sakonju on board ''Aoba''. In his instructions to Sakonju, Vice Admiral Takasu directed that if the force captured Allied merchant seamen all prisoners, other than radio operators and other personnel who might possess useful information, were to be killed.<ref name=\"Gill_388\"/> Sakonju did not question this order. The Japanese cruisers embarked specialised boarding parties for this operation as it was hoped that they could capture merchant ships to alleviate Japan's shipping shortage.<ref>Royal Navy Historical Section (1957), pp. 183\u2013184</ref>\n\n==Raid==\nThe three Japanese heavy cruisers departed from the Combined Fleet's anchorage in the [[Lingga Islands]] on 27&nbsp;February.<ref name=\"Aoba_TROM\">{{cite web|url=http://www.combinedfleet.com/aoba_t.htm|title=HIJMS Aoba: Tabular Record of Movement|last=Hackett|first=Bob|author2=Kingsepp, Sander|year=2007|publisher=Combinedfleet.com|accessdate=28 June 2009}}</ref> The light cruisers {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Kinu||2}} and {{ship|Japanese cruiser|\u014ci||2}} and three destroyers escorted the force through the [[Sunda Strait]] on 1&nbsp;March. The raiders were supported by 10 medium bombers and three or four [[seaplane]]s based in [[Sumatra]] and west [[Java]] which conducted patrols in the direction of Ceylon. Three or four submarines from the 8th&nbsp;Flotilla also monitored Allied shipping movements near [[Ceylon]], the [[Maldive Islands]] and [[Chagos Archipelago]].<ref name= \"Gill_388\"/> The Allies did not detect the Japanese force's departure, but [[Western Australian emergency of March 1944|reinforced their forces in Western Australia]] after an American submarine encountered ''Kinu'' and ''\u014ci'' operating near the [[Lombok Strait]] on 6&nbsp;March. The presence of these ships was taken to indicate that a hostile force had possibly been dispatched into the Indian Ocean.<ref name=\"Gill_390\">Gill (1968), p. 390</ref> On 8&nbsp;March, Somerville directed all Allied ships travelling between 80 and 100\u00b0 east to divert to the south or west.<ref name=\"RN_184\"/>\n\nAfter leaving the Sunda Strait, the Japanese heavy cruisers sailed south-west for the main route between Aden and Fremantle.

''Tone''{{'}}s signals room picked up this message, and the cruiser opened fire on ''Behar''.<ref>Lamont-Brown (2002), pp. 110\u2013111</ref> The Japanese cruiser did not attempt to capture the steamer, as it was judged too risky to sail her back to Japanese territory.<ref name= \"RN_184\"/> ''Tone''{{'}}s gunners scored hits on ''Behar''{{'}}s prow and stern which killed three of her crew.

Japanese sailors forced the survivors to hand over all their personal belongings of any value, and then used ropes to tie the survivors in painful positions which caused them to have difficulty breathing.

The film tells the story of a bullied 12-year-old boy who develops a friendship with a [[vampire]] child in [[Blackeberg]], a suburb of [[Stockholm]], in the early 1980s. Alfredson, unconcerned with the [[Horror film|horror]] and [[Vampire films|vampire conventions]], decided to tone down many elements of the novel and focus primarily on the relationship between the two main characters and explore the darker side of humanity. Selecting the lead actors involved a year-long process with open castings held all over Sweden. In the end, the 11-year-olds [[K\u00e5re Hedebrant]] and [[Lina Leandersson]] were chosen for the leading roles. They were subsequently commended by both Alfredson and film reviewers for their performances.\n\nThe film received critical acclaim and won several awards, including the \"Founders Award for Best Narrative Feature\" at the 2008 [[Tribeca Film Festival]] and the [[European Fantastic Film Festivals Federation]]'s 2008 M\u00e9li\u00e8s d'Or (Golden [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s|M\u00e9li\u00e8s]]) for the \"Best European Fantastic Feature Film\", as well as four [[Guldbagge Award]]s from the [[Swedish Film Institute]] and the [[Saturn Award for Best International Film]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Eli's gender is intentionally ambiguous. See the talk page before attempting to correct this.-->\nOskar, a meek 12-year-old boy, resides with his mother Yvonne in the western Stockholm suburb of Blackeberg in 1981. His classmates regularly [[Bullying|bully]] him, and he spends his evenings imagining revenge, collecting clippings from newspapers and magazines about grisly murders. One night he meets Eli, who appears to be a pale girl of his age. Eli has recently moved into the next-door apartment with an older man, H\u00e5kan. Eli initially informs Oskar that they cannot be friends. Over time, however, they begin to form a close relationship, with Oskar lending his [[Rubik's Cube]] to Eli, and the two exchanging [[Morse code]] messages through their adjoining wall. H\u00e5kan requests that Eli stop seeing Oskar. After questioning Oskar about a cut on his cheek, Eli learns that the boy is being bullied by schoolmates and encourages him to stand up for himself. This inspires Oskar to enroll for weight-training classes after school.\n\nEarlier, H\u00e5kan stops and kills a passerby on a busy footpath near a main road to harvest fresh blood for Eli, but he fails to return with any when he is interrupted by an approaching dog walker. Eli is prompted to waylay and kill a local man, Jocke, making his way home from a bar after having said goodnight to his best friend, Lacke. A local cat-loving recluse, G\u00f6sta, witnesses the attack from his flat. He does not believe what he has seen and decides not to report the incident. H\u00e5kan hides Jocke's body in an ice-hole in the local lake. H\u00e5kan later makes another well-prepared but incompetently executed effort to obtain blood for Eli by trapping a teenage boy in a changing room after school. The boy's friends are waiting for him to emerge, and go to see what is holding him up. Before he is discovered, H\u00e5kan pours concentrated [[hydrochloric acid]] onto his own face, disfiguring it to prevent the authorities from identifying him. Eli learns that H\u00e5kan has been taken to the hospital and scales the building to access his restricted room. H\u00e5kan opens the window for Eli and offers his neck for feeding; drained of blood, H\u00e5kan falls out of the window onto the snow and dies. Now alone, Eli goes to Oskar's apartment and spends the night with him, during which time they agree to \"go steady\". While Eli states, \"I'm not a girl\", Oskar (ambiguously) either ignores this or accepts the unclear nature of the relationship.\n\nDuring an ice skating [[field trip]] at the lake, some of Oskar's fellow students discover Jocke's body. At the same time, Oskar finally stands up to his tormentors and strikes the leader of the bullies, Conny, on the side of the head with a pole, splitting his ear. Some time later, Oskar shows Eli a private place he knows. Unaware that Eli is a vampire, Oskar suggests that they form a [[Blood brother|blood bond]], and cuts his hand, asking Eli to do the same. Eli, thirsting for blood but not wanting to harm Oskar, laps up his spilled blood before running away. Lacke's girlfriend, Virginia, is subsequently attacked by Eli. Lacke turns up in time to interrupt the attack. Virginia survives, but soon discovers that she has become painfully sensitive to sunlight. Seeking Lacke, Virginia visits G\u00f6sta, only to be fiercely attacked by G\u00f6sta's cats. In the hospital, Virginia, who has realized what she has become, asks an orderly to open the blinds in her room. When the sunlight streams in, she bursts into flames.\n\nRealizing the situation, Oskar confronts Eli, who admits to being a vampire. Oskar is initially upset by Eli's need to kill people for survival. However, Eli insists that their bloodthirsty natures are alike, in that Oskar wants to kill and Eli needs to kill, and encourages Oskar to \"be me, for a little while.\"\n\nLacke, who has lost both his best friend and girlfriend to the attacks, tracks Eli down to the closed-off apartment. Breaking in, he discovers Eli asleep in the bathtub. He prepares to kill Eli, but Oskar, who was hiding inside the apartment, interferes; Eli immediately wakes up, jumps on Lacke and kills him, feeding on his blood. Eli thanks Oskar and kisses him in gratitude. However, an upstairs neighbor is angrily knocking on the ceiling due to the disturbance the fight has caused. Eli realizes that it is no longer safe to stay and leaves the same night.\n\nThe next morning, Oskar receives a phone call from Conny's friend, Martin, who lures Oskar out to resume the after-school fitness program at the local swimming pool. The bullies, led by Conny and his [[wikt:sadism|sadistic]] older brother Jimmy, start a fire to draw Mr \u00c1vila, the teacher in charge, outside, and enter the pool area, ordering the other children to clear out. This leaves Oskar trapped alone in the pool. Jimmy forces Oskar under the water, threatening to stab his eye out if he does not hold his breath for three minutes. While Oskar is being held underwater, Eli arrives and rescues him by killing and dismembering the bullies, except for the most reluctant of their number, Andreas, who is left sobbing on a bench.\n\nLater, Oskar is traveling on a train with Eli in a box beside him, safe from sunlight. From inside, Eli taps the word \"kiss\" to Oskar in Morse code, to which he taps back \"''puss''\" (small kiss in Swedish).\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Let the Right One In characters}}\n{{castlist|\n* [[K\u00e5re Hedebrant]] as [[List of characters from Let the Right One In and Let Me In#Oskar or Owen|Oskar]]\n* [[Lina Leandersson]] as [[List of characters from Let the Right One In and Let Me In#Eli or Abby|Eli]]\n** [[Elif Ceylan]] as Eli (Voice)\n** Susanne Ruben as Aged Eli\n* [[Per Ragnar]] as [[List of characters from Let the Right One In and Let Me In#H\u00e5kan or \"The Father\"|H\u00e5kan]]\n* [[Henrik Dahl (actor)|Henrik Dahl]] as Erik\n* Karin Bergquist as Yvonne\n* [[Peter Carlberg]] as [[List of characters from Let the Right One In and Let Me In#Lacke|Lacke]]\n* [[Ika Nord]] as [[List of characters from Let the Right One In and Let Me In#Virginia|Virginia]]\n* [[Mikael Rahm]] as Jocke\n* Karl Robert Lindgren as G\u00f6sta\n* Anders T.

The film tells the story of a bullied 12-year-old boy who develops a friendship with a [[vampire]] child in [[Blackeberg]], a suburb of [[Stockholm]], in the early 1980s. Alfredson, unconcerned with the [[Horror film|horror]] and [[Vampire films|vampire conventions]], decided to tone down many elements of the novel and focus primarily on the relationship between the two main characters and explore the darker side of humanity. Selecting the lead actors involved a year-long process with open castings held all over Sweden. In the end, the 11-year-olds [[K\u00e5re Hedebrant]] and [[Lina Leandersson]] were chosen for the leading roles. They were subsequently commended by both Alfredson and film reviewers for their performances.\n\nThe film received critical acclaim and won several awards, including the \"Founders Award for Best Narrative Feature\" at the 2008 [[Tribeca Film Festival]] and the [[European Fantastic Film Festivals Federation]]'s 2008 M\u00e9li\u00e8s d'Or (Golden [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s|M\u00e9li\u00e8s]]) for the \"Best European Fantastic Feature Film\", as well as four [[Guldbagge Award]]s from the [[Swedish Film Institute]] and the [[Saturn Award for Best International Film]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Eli's gender is intentionally ambiguous. See the talk page before attempting to correct this.-->\nOskar, a meek 12-year-old boy, resides with his mother Yvonne in the western Stockholm suburb of Blackeberg in 1981. His classmates regularly [[Bullying|bully]] him, and he spends his evenings imagining revenge, collecting clippings from newspapers and magazines about grisly murders. One night he meets Eli, who appears to be a pale girl of his age. Eli has recently moved into the next-door apartment with an older man, H\u00e5kan. Eli initially informs Oskar that they cannot be friends. Over time, however, they begin to form a close relationship, with Oskar lending his [[Rubik's Cube]] to Eli, and the two exchanging [[Morse code]] messages through their adjoining wall. H\u00e5kan requests that Eli stop seeing Oskar. After questioning Oskar about a cut on his cheek, Eli learns that the boy is being bullied by schoolmates and encourages him to stand up for himself. This inspires Oskar to enroll for weight-training classes after school.\n\nEarlier, H\u00e5kan stops and kills a passerby on a busy footpath near a main road to harvest fresh blood for Eli, but he fails to return with any when he is interrupted by an approaching dog walker. Eli is prompted to waylay and kill a local man, Jocke, making his way home from a bar after having said goodnight to his best friend, Lacke. A local cat-loving recluse, G\u00f6sta, witnesses the attack from his flat. He does not believe what he has seen and decides not to report the incident. H\u00e5kan hides Jocke's body in an ice-hole in the local lake. H\u00e5kan later makes another well-prepared but incompetently executed effort to obtain blood for Eli by trapping a teenage boy in a changing room after school. The boy's friends are waiting for him to emerge, and go to see what is holding him up. Before he is discovered, H\u00e5kan pours concentrated [[hydrochloric acid]] onto his own face, disfiguring it to prevent the authorities from identifying him. Eli learns that H\u00e5kan has been taken to the hospital and scales the building to access his restricted room. H\u00e5kan opens the window for Eli and offers his neck for feeding; drained of blood, H\u00e5kan falls out of the window onto the snow and dies. Now alone, Eli goes to Oskar's apartment and spends the night with him, during which time they agree to \"go steady\". While Eli states, \"I'm not a girl\", Oskar (ambiguously) either ignores this or accepts the unclear nature of the relationship.\n\nDuring an ice skating [[field trip]] at the lake, some of Oskar's fellow students discover Jocke's body. At the same time, Oskar finally stands up to his tormentors and strikes the leader of the bullies, Conny, on the side of the head with a pole, splitting his ear. Some time later, Oskar shows Eli a private place he knows. Unaware that Eli is a vampire, Oskar suggests that they form a [[Blood brother|blood bond]], and cuts his hand, asking Eli to do the same. Eli, thirsting for blood but not wanting to harm Oskar, laps up his spilled blood before running away. Lacke's girlfriend, Virginia, is subsequently attacked by Eli. Lacke turns up in time to interrupt the attack. Virginia survives, but soon discovers that she has become painfully sensitive to sunlight. Seeking Lacke, Virginia visits G\u00f6sta, only to be fiercely attacked by G\u00f6sta's cats. In the hospital, Virginia, who has realized what she has become, asks an orderly to open the blinds in her room. When the sunlight streams in, she bursts into flames.\n\nRealizing the situation, Oskar confronts Eli, who admits to being a vampire. Oskar is initially upset by Eli's need to kill people for survival. However, Eli insists that their bloodthirsty natures are alike, in that Oskar wants to kill and Eli needs to kill, and encourages Oskar to \"be me, for a little while.\"\n\nLacke, who has lost both his best friend and girlfriend to the attacks, tracks Eli down to the closed-off apartment. Breaking in, he discovers Eli asleep in the bathtub. He prepares to kill Eli, but Oskar, who was hiding inside the apartment, interferes; Eli immediately wakes up, jumps on Lacke and kills him, feeding on his blood. Eli thanks Oskar and kisses him in gratitude. However, an upstairs neighbor is angrily knocking on the ceiling due to the disturbance the fight has caused. Eli realizes that it is no longer safe to stay and leaves the same night.\n\nThe next morning, Oskar receives a phone call from Conny's friend, Martin, who lures Oskar out to resume the after-school fitness program at the local swimming pool. The bullies, led by Conny and his [[wikt:sadism|sadistic]] older brother Jimmy, start a fire to draw Mr \u00c1vila, the teacher in charge, outside, and enter the pool area, ordering the other children to clear out. This leaves Oskar trapped alone in the pool. Jimmy forces Oskar under the water, threatening to stab his eye out if he does not hold his breath for three minutes. While Oskar is being held underwater, Eli arrives and rescues him by killing and dismembering the bullies, except for the most reluctant of their number, Andreas, who is left sobbing on a bench.\n\nLater, Oskar is traveling on a train with Eli in a box beside him, safe from sunlight. From inside, Eli taps the word \"kiss\" to Oskar in Morse code, to which he taps back \"''puss''\" (small kiss in Swedish).\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Let the Right One In characters}}\n{{castlist|\n* [[K\u00e5re Hedebrant]] as [[List of characters from Let the Right One In and Let Me In#Oskar or Owen|Oskar]]\n* [[Lina Leandersson]] as [[List of characters from Let the Right One In and Let Me In#Eli or Abby|Eli]]\n** [[Elif Ceylan]] as Eli (Voice)\n** Susanne Ruben as Aged Eli\n* [[Per Ragnar]] as [[List of characters from Let the Right One In and Let Me In#H\u00e5kan or \"The Father\"|H\u00e5kan]]\n* [[Henrik Dahl (actor)|Henrik Dahl]] as Erik\n* Karin Bergquist as Yvonne\n* [[Peter Carlberg]] as [[List of characters from Let the Right One In and Let Me In#Lacke|Lacke]]\n* [[Ika Nord]] as [[List of characters from Let the Right One In and Let Me In#Virginia|Virginia]]\n* [[Mikael Rahm]] as Jocke\n* Karl Robert Lindgren as G\u00f6sta\n* Anders T.

Fred is the husband of [[Wilma Flintstone]] and father of [[Pebbles Flintstone]]. His best friend is his next door neighbor, [[Barney Rubble|Barney]], who has a wife named [[Betty Rubble|Betty]] and an adopted son, named [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble|Bamm-Bamm]].<ref>[http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=flintstones The Flintstones] ''[[The Museum of Broadcast Communications]]''</ref>\n\nFred lives in the fictional [[prehistoric]] town of [[Bedrock (The Flintstones)|Bedrock]], a world where dinosaurs coexist with modernized [[caveman|cavepeople]] and the cavepeople enjoy \"primitive\" versions of [[modern conveniences]] such as [[telephone]]s, [[automobile]]s, and [[washing machine]]s. Fred's trademark catchphrase yell is \"yabba dabba doo!\", a phrase that was originally his club's cheer, and later adopted as part of the theme song from the third season on and used in the [[The Flintstones (film)|1994 live-action ''Flintstones'' movie]].\n\nSince the original series' run, Fred has appeared in various other cartoon spinoffs, live action adaptations, music videos, and [[television commercial|commercial]]s.\n\n==Biography==\nWhile the mid-1980s [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series ''[[The Flintstone Kids]]'' depicts Fred as a child, the series may be [[apocryphal]] due to its presenting Wilma as a childhood friend of Fred and Barney; the original series asserts that they first met as young adults.<ref name=\"bachelor\">\"Bachelor Daze,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 4</ref> Still, the series' depictions that Fred is the only child of Ed and Edna Flintstone (a handyman and a [[housewife|homemaker]], respectively) might be taken as [[Canon (fiction)|canon]]. In the long-running Flintstones newspaper comic strip by [[Gene Hazelton]], Fred's father, '''Pops Flintstone''', was a recurring character.<ref>https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uixhK3mS6Yw/VwQXPSOzfBI/AAAAAAABj9A/ypZWn57gvkk750lJj5CtofFfQyRLU6Uag/s1600/Flintstones-1967-08-26.jpg</ref>\n\nAs young adults, Fred and Barney worked as bellhops at a resort. There, they meet and fall in love with Wilma and Betty, who were working there as [[cigarette girl]]s. Fred and Wilma's mother, [[Pearl Slaghoople]], also met and took an instant dislike to each other, starting a long-lasting rivalry between the two.<ref name=\"bachelor\"/> An unspecified amount of time later, Fred married Wilma.\n\nFred is a typical [[blue-collar worker]], who works as a \"[[Brontosaurus|bronto]] crane operator\" at Slate Rock and Gravel Company (also known as Rockhead and Quarry Cave Construction Company in earlier episodes). Fred's job title in the second-season episode \"Divided We Sail\" is \"geological engineer\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0580165/|title=Divided We Sail|via=www.imdb.com|accessdate=2019-12-08}}</ref>\n\nDuring the original series' third season, Wilma gives birth to the couple's daughter, Pebbles. Years later, when Pebbles is a teenager, Fred and Barney join the Bedrock [[police]] force for a time as part-time [[police officer]]s.<ref name=\"comedyshow\" /> Eventually, Fred becomes a [[grandfather]] to the adult Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm's twins, Chip and Roxy. Fred's family grew again in ''[[A Flintstone Family Christmas]]'', when he and Wilma adopted an orphaned caveboy named Stony, and despite a rough start, Fred and his new son bonded well.\n\n==Relatives==\nThe Flintstone family's paternal side originally came from the prehistoric state of Arkanstone, where they had been engaged in a feud similar to the [[Hatfield-McCoy feud]]. The feud was originally started by an ancestor of Fred's making a joke about a Hatrock family portrait (\"I don't know what the artist got for doing that painting, but he should've gotten life!\"). In the fourth-season episode \"Bedrock Hillbillies,\" the feud is ended when Fred helps rescue Pebbles and a Hatrock baby, only to start up again when Fred makes the same joke as his ancestor. The Hatrocks later appear in the follow-up fifth-season episode \"The Hatrocks and the Gruesomes\", where they visit Bedrock. The last of the Arkanstone Flintstones was Fred's great-great-uncle Zeke Flintstone who lived to 102.\n\nOther relatives of Fred include: Rockbottom \"Rocky/Stony\" Flintstone, Fred's grandfather, who was a veteran of Stone World War One;<ref name=\"raiders\" />; Uncle Giggles Flintstone, a rich, eccentric practical joker whose jokes drive Fred into a mad rage;<ref name=\"haunted\" /> James Hardrock, Edna's father; Uncle Tex Hardrock, Fred's rich Texan uncle;<ref name=\"tex\" /> Tumbleweed and Mary Lou Jim, Fred's rich Texan cousins;<ref name=\"droop\" />  .\n[[File:Jackie Gleason - 1966.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Flintstones'' character was based on the character [[Ralph Kramden]] ([[Jackie Gleason]]) from ''[[The Honeymooners]]'']]\n\n==Personality==\nFred's personality was based on that of [[Ralph Kramden]] of the 1950s television series ''[[The Honeymooners]]'' and Chester A. Riley from ''[[The Life of Riley]]'', both of whom were originally portrayed on television by [[Jackie Gleason]] (Riley was originally portrayed on radio, film and later television episodes by [[William Bendix]]). Much like Ralph, Fred tends to be loud-mouthed, aggressive, and constantly scheming ways to improve his family's working class lot in life, often with unintended results. Also like Ralph, despite his harshness, he is friendly, and has a loving heart, who is very devoted to his family and cares a lot about his best friend and next door neighbor [[Barney Rubble]]. Fred loses his temper easily and is very impatient, but he seems free of malice and never holds a grudge. Although his loudness irritates the people around him, Fred proves friendly, often going out of his way to help others. Also, although Fred often annoys Wilma with his immaturity, he is known to go to great lengths to please his family and apologize when he goes too far. Other known characters from other programs may also be known to have personalities based on Fred Flintstone including [[Archie Bunker]] from ''[[All In The Family]]'' and ''[[Archie Bunker's Place]]'' (both played by [[Carroll OConnor]]), [[George Jefferson]] from ''[[The Jeffersons]]'' (played by [[Sherman Hemsley]]), [[Mel Sharples]] from ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'' (played by [[Vic Tayback]]) and Frank DeFazio from ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' (played by [[Phil Foster]]).\n\nFred's interests include [[bowling]], playing [[Billiards|pool]], [[golf]], [[poker]] and lounging around the house. Fred has won championships with his bowling skills; in one episode, he goes so far as to take [[ballet]] lessons in order to improve his game.<ref>\"Bowling Ballet,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 3</ref> The nickname of \"Twinkletoes\" stuck with him when Fred attended a local university and became eligible to play on their football team, and it became his [[call sign]].<ref>\"Flintstone of Prinstone,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 2</ref> Fred is also an excellent golfer. Fred is a member of the Loyal Order of Water Buffalos Lodge (named \"the Loyal Order of Dinosaurs\" in an early episode).<ref name=\"hotlips\">\"Hot Lips Hannigan,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 1</ref> Fred also has a serious [[gambling problem]]; the mere mention of the word \"bet\" causes Fred to stammer \"bet\" over and over again (sounding like a clucking chicken) and go on gambling binges.<ref>\"The Gambler,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 2</ref> Fred is also an avid driver. In the fifth-season episode \"Indianrockolis 500,\" Fred entered the [[Indianapolis 500|famed prehistoric auto race]] under the [[pseudonym]] \"Goggles Paisano\".<ref>{{YouTube|GmQoWQb4tx0}}</ref>\n\nFred's [[catchphrase]] is \"Yabba-Dabba-Doo!\"; [[Alan Reed]], voice actor who provided Fred's voice from 1960\u20131977, reportedly said that the inspiration for the phrase came from his mother, who used to say, \"A little dab'll do ya,\" probably borrowed from a Brylcreem commercial. When the script called for a simple 'Yahoo!' Alan either asked if he could alter the phrase or he ad-libbed. It inspired, in the 1970s a short-lived fruit drink called \"Yabba Dabba Dew\" and may or may not have also inspired [[George Jetson]]'s similar-sounding catchphrase, \"Hooba-dooba-dooba\" (or \"Hooba-Dooba\"). It does, however, become the subject of a song by [[Hoagy Carmichael]] that the singer-songwriter performs in an episode of ''The Flintstones''<ref>. In \"The Hit Song Writers,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 2</ref> Fred's ability to carry a tune was quite good in his younger years. One early episode<ref name=\"hotlips\" /> sees Fred (with Barney, who is a skilled [[drummer]]) perform at a nightclub with his musician friend \"Hot Lips Hannigan\" where his singing caused teenage girls to swoon over him; on this occasion, he was nicknamed \"the [[Mel Torme|Golden Smog]]\". In another first-season episode, \"Girls' Night Out\", Fred recorded a demo record at a [[carnival]] of the song \"[[Listen to the Mockingbird|Listen to the Rocking Bird]]\", which ended up making him a teenage singing idol named \"Hi Fye.\" As the series progressed, however, his voice became worse and worse (even during his success as a singer, Wilma was never impressed by Fred's voice), eventually to the point that a temporary maid the Flintstones hired quit rather than having to hear Fred sing.<ref>\"Wilma, the Maid,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 3</ref>\n\nDue to his impulsive and short-tempered behavior and stubborn and somewhat selfish nature, Fred seems to be accident-prone. Even his most innocent and mundane actions often cause widespread confusion. At the end of the closing credits, Fred begins to knock the door of his house and starts yelling \"Wilma\", to open the door.\n\nAccording to the original series' third-season episode \"The Birthday Party\" (originally aired April 5, 1963), Fred's birthday is February 2. Fred's address has varied through the series' run, with addresses given for the Flintstone residence including 345 Cave Stone Road, and 1313 Cobblestone Way. Fred's address was cited as \"55 Cobblestone Rd\" in the 1961 episode \"The X-Ray Story\".\n\n==Animated media==\n===Television shows===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|Series number\n!style=\"width:250px;\"|Title\n!style=\"width:100px;\"|Broadcast run\n!style=\"width:150px;\"|Original channel\n!style=\"width:175px;\"|Total # episodes\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|Total # seasons\n|-\n|1\n|''[[The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show]]''\n|1971\u20131972\n|rowspan=\"3\" | [[CBS]]\n|16 episodes\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 1\n|-\n|2\n|''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour]]''\n|1972\u20131973\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 18 episodes\n|-\n|3\n|''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour|The Flintstone Comedy Show]]''{{Efn|A re-titled second season of reruns featuring repackaged segments from ''The Flintstone Comedy Hour''.}}\n|1973\u20131974\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3;\"|\n|-\n|4\n|''[[Fred Flintstone and Friends]]''{{Efn|A 30-minute weekday animated series which aired in first-run syndication.}}\n|1977\u20131978\n|[[Broadcast syndication|Syndication]]\n|95 episodes\n|1\n|-\n|5\n|''[[The New Fred and Barney Show]]''\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 1979\n|rowspan=\"5\" | [[NBC]]\n|17 episodes\n|2\n|-\n|6\n|''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Thing]]''\n|13 episodes\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 1\n|-\n|7\n|''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'' {{Efn|This 90-minute series featured reruns of ''Fred and Barney Meet the Thing'' combined with episodes of ''[[The New Shmoo]]''.}}\n|1979\u20131980\n|17 episodes\n|-\n|8\n|''[[The Flintstone Comedy Show]]''\n|1980\u20131982\n|18 episodes\n|rowspan=\"3\" | 2\n|-\n|9\n|''[[The Flintstone Funnies]]''{{Efn|A compilation series featuring repackaged segments from ''The Flintstone Comedy Show''.}}\n|1982\u20131984\n|26 episodes\n|-\n|10\n|''[[The Flintstone Kids]]''\n|1986\u20131988\n|[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]\n|[[List of The Flintstone Kids episodes|34 episodes]]\n|-\n|11\n|''[[Dino: Stay Out!]]''{{Efn|A 7-minute short cartoon featuring Dino originally aired as part of the animated showcase series ''[[What a Cartoon!]]''.}}\n|1995\n|[[Cartoon Network]]\n|1 episode\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3;\"|\n|-\n|12\n|''[[Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs]]''\n|2020<!-- Do NOT link this title to \"Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs!

After extolling the virtues of the Winston brand cigarette, Fred lit up his cigarette and delivered the catch phrase: \"[[Winston tastes good like a cigarette should]]\". Another similar ad for the cigarettes featured Wilma and Betty as well; the women were working hard mowing the lawn and beating dust out of a rug while Fred and Barney smoked behind the house. Vignettes also aired in which Fred lit Wilma's Winston cigarette, and the couple shared a smoke. By the original series' third season, Winston had been dropped as a sponsor in favor of [[Welch's]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://legendsrevealed.com/entertainment/2012/12/09/did-the-flintstones-do-commercials-for-winston-cigarettes/|title=Did the Flintstones Do Commercials for Winston Cigarettes?|date=2012-12-09|accessdate=2019-12-09}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Flintstones Chewable Vitamins]]\n*[[Pebbles Cereal]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*''Yabba Dabba Doo!

Fred is the husband of [[Wilma Flintstone]] and father of [[Pebbles Flintstone]]. His best friend is his next door neighbor, [[Barney Rubble|Barney]], who has a wife named [[Betty Rubble|Betty]] and an adopted son, named [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble|Bamm-Bamm]].<ref>[http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=flintstones The Flintstones] ''[[The Museum of Broadcast Communications]]''</ref>\n\nFred lives in the fictional [[prehistoric]] town of [[Bedrock (The Flintstones)|Bedrock]], a world where dinosaurs coexist with modernized [[caveman|cavepeople]] and the cavepeople enjoy \"primitive\" versions of [[modern conveniences]] such as [[telephone]]s, [[automobile]]s, and [[washing machine]]s. Fred's trademark catchphrase yell is \"yabba dabba doo!\", a phrase that was originally his club's cheer, and later adopted as part of the theme song from the third season on and used in the [[The Flintstones (film)|1994 live-action ''Flintstones'' movie]].\n\nSince the original series' run, Fred has appeared in various other cartoon spinoffs, live action adaptations, music videos, and [[television commercial|commercial]]s.\n\n==Biography==\nWhile the mid-1980s [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series ''[[The Flintstone Kids]]'' depicts Fred as a child, the series may be [[apocryphal]] due to its presenting Wilma as a childhood friend of Fred and Barney; the original series asserts that they first met as young adults.<ref name=\"bachelor\">\"Bachelor Daze,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 4</ref> Still, the series' depictions that Fred is the only child of Ed and Edna Flintstone (a handyman and a [[housewife|homemaker]], respectively) might be taken as [[Canon (fiction)|canon]]. In the long-running Flintstones newspaper comic strip by [[Gene Hazelton]], Fred's father, '''Pops Flintstone''', was a recurring character.<ref>https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uixhK3mS6Yw/VwQXPSOzfBI/AAAAAAABj9A/ypZWn57gvkk750lJj5CtofFfQyRLU6Uag/s1600/Flintstones-1967-08-26.jpg</ref>\n\nAs young adults, Fred and Barney worked as bellhops at a resort. There, they meet and fall in love with Wilma and Betty, who were working there as [[cigarette girl]]s. Fred and Wilma's mother, [[Pearl Slaghoople]], also met and took an instant dislike to each other, starting a long-lasting rivalry between the two.<ref name=\"bachelor\"/> An unspecified amount of time later, Fred married Wilma.\n\nFred is a typical [[blue-collar worker]], who works as a \"[[Brontosaurus|bronto]] crane operator\" at Slate Rock and Gravel Company (also known as Rockhead and Quarry Cave Construction Company in earlier episodes). Fred's job title in the second-season episode \"Divided We Sail\" is \"geological engineer\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0580165/|title=Divided We Sail|via=www.imdb.com|accessdate=2019-12-08}}</ref>\n\nDuring the original series' third season, Wilma gives birth to the couple's daughter, Pebbles. Years later, when Pebbles is a teenager, Fred and Barney join the Bedrock [[police]] force for a time as part-time [[police officer]]s.<ref name=\"comedyshow\" /> Eventually, Fred becomes a [[grandfather]] to the adult Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm's twins, Chip and Roxy. Fred's family grew again in ''[[A Flintstone Family Christmas]]'', when he and Wilma adopted an orphaned caveboy named Stony, and despite a rough start, Fred and his new son bonded well.\n\n==Relatives==\nThe Flintstone family's paternal side originally came from the prehistoric state of Arkanstone, where they had been engaged in a feud similar to the [[Hatfield-McCoy feud]]. The feud was originally started by an ancestor of Fred's making a joke about a Hatrock family portrait (\"I don't know what the artist got for doing that painting, but he should've gotten life!\"). In the fourth-season episode \"Bedrock Hillbillies,\" the feud is ended when Fred helps rescue Pebbles and a Hatrock baby, only to start up again when Fred makes the same joke as his ancestor. The Hatrocks later appear in the follow-up fifth-season episode \"The Hatrocks and the Gruesomes\", where they visit Bedrock. The last of the Arkanstone Flintstones was Fred's great-great-uncle Zeke Flintstone who lived to 102.\n\nOther relatives of Fred include: Rockbottom \"Rocky/Stony\" Flintstone, Fred's grandfather, who was a veteran of Stone World War One;<ref name=\"raiders\" />; Uncle Giggles Flintstone, a rich, eccentric practical joker whose jokes drive Fred into a mad rage;<ref name=\"haunted\" /> James Hardrock, Edna's father; Uncle Tex Hardrock, Fred's rich Texan uncle;<ref name=\"tex\" /> Tumbleweed and Mary Lou Jim, Fred's rich Texan cousins;<ref name=\"droop\" />  .\n[[File:Jackie Gleason - 1966.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Flintstones'' character was based on the character [[Ralph Kramden]] ([[Jackie Gleason]]) from ''[[The Honeymooners]]'']]\n\n==Personality==\nFred's personality was based on that of [[Ralph Kramden]] of the 1950s television series ''[[The Honeymooners]]'' and Chester A. Riley from ''[[The Life of Riley]]'', both of whom were originally portrayed on television by [[Jackie Gleason]] (Riley was originally portrayed on radio, film and later television episodes by [[William Bendix]]). Much like Ralph, Fred tends to be loud-mouthed, aggressive, and constantly scheming ways to improve his family's working class lot in life, often with unintended results. Also like Ralph, despite his harshness, he is friendly, and has a loving heart, who is very devoted to his family and cares a lot about his best friend and next door neighbor [[Barney Rubble]]. Fred loses his temper easily and is very impatient, but he seems free of malice and never holds a grudge. Although his loudness irritates the people around him, Fred proves friendly, often going out of his way to help others. Also, although Fred often annoys Wilma with his immaturity, he is known to go to great lengths to please his family and apologize when he goes too far. Other known characters from other programs may also be known to have personalities based on Fred Flintstone including [[Archie Bunker]] from ''[[All In The Family]]'' and ''[[Archie Bunker's Place]]'' (both played by [[Carroll OConnor]]), [[George Jefferson]] from ''[[The Jeffersons]]'' (played by [[Sherman Hemsley]]), [[Mel Sharples]] from ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'' (played by [[Vic Tayback]]) and Frank DeFazio from ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' (played by [[Phil Foster]]).\n\nFred's interests include [[bowling]], playing [[Billiards|pool]], [[golf]], [[poker]] and lounging around the house. Fred has won championships with his bowling skills; in one episode, he goes so far as to take [[ballet]] lessons in order to improve his game.<ref>\"Bowling Ballet,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 3</ref> The nickname of \"Twinkletoes\" stuck with him when Fred attended a local university and became eligible to play on their football team, and it became his [[call sign]].<ref>\"Flintstone of Prinstone,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 2</ref> Fred is also an excellent golfer. Fred is a member of the Loyal Order of Water Buffalos Lodge (named \"the Loyal Order of Dinosaurs\" in an early episode).<ref name=\"hotlips\">\"Hot Lips Hannigan,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 1</ref> Fred also has a serious [[gambling problem]]; the mere mention of the word \"bet\" causes Fred to stammer \"bet\" over and over again (sounding like a clucking chicken) and go on gambling binges.<ref>\"The Gambler,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 2</ref> Fred is also an avid driver. In the fifth-season episode \"Indianrockolis 500,\" Fred entered the [[Indianapolis 500|famed prehistoric auto race]] under the [[pseudonym]] \"Goggles Paisano\".<ref>{{YouTube|GmQoWQb4tx0}}</ref>\n\nFred's [[catchphrase]] is \"Yabba-Dabba-Doo!\"; [[Alan Reed]], voice actor who provided Fred's voice from 1960\u20131977, reportedly said that the inspiration for the phrase came from his mother, who used to say, \"A little dab'll do ya,\" probably borrowed from a Brylcreem commercial. When the script called for a simple 'Yahoo!' Alan either asked if he could alter the phrase or he ad-libbed. It inspired, in the 1970s a short-lived fruit drink called \"Yabba Dabba Dew\" and may or may not have also inspired [[George Jetson]]'s similar-sounding catchphrase, \"Hooba-dooba-dooba\" (or \"Hooba-Dooba\"). It does, however, become the subject of a song by [[Hoagy Carmichael]] that the singer-songwriter performs in an episode of ''The Flintstones''<ref>. In \"The Hit Song Writers,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 2</ref> Fred's ability to carry a tune was quite good in his younger years. One early episode<ref name=\"hotlips\" /> sees Fred (with Barney, who is a skilled [[drummer]]) perform at a nightclub with his musician friend \"Hot Lips Hannigan\" where his singing caused teenage girls to swoon over him; on this occasion, he was nicknamed \"the [[Mel Torme|Golden Smog]]\". In another first-season episode, \"Girls' Night Out\", Fred recorded a demo record at a [[carnival]] of the song \"[[Listen to the Mockingbird|Listen to the Rocking Bird]]\", which ended up making him a teenage singing idol named \"Hi Fye.\" As the series progressed, however, his voice became worse and worse (even during his success as a singer, Wilma was never impressed by Fred's voice), eventually to the point that a temporary maid the Flintstones hired quit rather than having to hear Fred sing.<ref>\"Wilma, the Maid,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 3</ref>\n\nDue to his impulsive and short-tempered behavior and stubborn and somewhat selfish nature, Fred seems to be accident-prone. Even his most innocent and mundane actions often cause widespread confusion. At the end of the closing credits, Fred begins to knock the door of his house and starts yelling \"Wilma\", to open the door.\n\nAccording to the original series' third-season episode \"The Birthday Party\" (originally aired April 5, 1963), Fred's birthday is February 2. Fred's address has varied through the series' run, with addresses given for the Flintstone residence including 345 Cave Stone Road, and 1313 Cobblestone Way. Fred's address was cited as \"55 Cobblestone Rd\" in the 1961 episode \"The X-Ray Story\".\n\n==Animated media==\n===Television shows===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|Series number\n!style=\"width:250px;\"|Title\n!style=\"width:100px;\"|Broadcast run\n!style=\"width:150px;\"|Original channel\n!style=\"width:175px;\"|Total # episodes\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|Total # seasons\n|-\n|1\n|''[[The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show]]''\n|1971\u20131972\n|rowspan=\"3\" | [[CBS]]\n|16 episodes\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 1\n|-\n|2\n|''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour]]''\n|1972\u20131973\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 18 episodes\n|-\n|3\n|''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour|The Flintstone Comedy Show]]''{{Efn|A re-titled second season of reruns featuring repackaged segments from ''The Flintstone Comedy Hour''.}}\n|1973\u20131974\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3;\"|\n|-\n|4\n|''[[Fred Flintstone and Friends]]''{{Efn|A 30-minute weekday animated series which aired in first-run syndication.}}\n|1977\u20131978\n|[[Broadcast syndication|Syndication]]\n|95 episodes\n|1\n|-\n|5\n|''[[The New Fred and Barney Show]]''\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 1979\n|rowspan=\"5\" | [[NBC]]\n|17 episodes\n|2\n|-\n|6\n|''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Thing]]''\n|13 episodes\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 1\n|-\n|7\n|''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'' {{Efn|This 90-minute series featured reruns of ''Fred and Barney Meet the Thing'' combined with episodes of ''The New Shmoo''.}}\n|1979\u20131980\n|17 episodes\n|-\n|8\n|''[[The Flintstone Comedy Show]]''\n|1980\u20131982\n|18 episodes\n|rowspan=\"3\" | 2\n|-\n|9\n|''[[The Flintstone Funnies]]''{{Efn|A compilation series featuring repackaged segments from ''The Flintstone Comedy Show''.}}\n|1982\u20131984\n|26 episodes\n|-\n|10\n|''[[The Flintstone Kids]]''\n|1986\u20131988\n|[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]\n|[[List of The Flintstone Kids episodes|34 episodes]]\n|-\n|11\n|''[[Dino: Stay Out!]]''\n|1995\n|[[Cartoon Network]]\n|1 episode\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3;\"|\n|-\n|12\n|''[[Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs]]''\n|2020<!-- Do NOT link this title to \"Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs!

{"title_page": "Relativistic angular momentum", "text_new": "{{Short description|Angular momentum in special and general relativity}}\n{{spacetime}}\n{{main|Angular Momentum}}\n\nIn [[physics]], '''relativistic angular momentum''' refers to the mathematical formalisms and physical concepts that define [[angular momentum]] in [[special relativity]] (SR) and [[general relativity]] (GR). The relativistic quantity is subtly different from the [[three-dimensional]] quantity in [[classical mechanics]].\n\nAngular momentum is an important dynamical quantity derived from position and momentum. It is a measure of an object's rotational motion and resistance to stop rotating. Also, in the same way momentum conservation corresponds to translational symmetry, angular momentum conservation corresponds to rotational symmetry \u2013 the connection between [[symmetry (physics)|symmetries]] and [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]]s is made by [[Noether's theorem]]. While these concepts were originally discovered in [[classical mechanics]], they are also true and significant in special and general relativity. In terms of abstract algebra, the invariance of angular momentum, four-momentum, and other symmetries in spacetime, are described by the [[Lorentz group]], or more generally the [[Poincar\u00e9 group]].\n\n[[Physical quantity|Physical quantities]] that remain separate in classical physics are ''naturally combined'' in SR and GR by enforcing the postulates of relativity. Most notably, the space and time coordinates combine into the [[Four-vector#Four-position|four-position]], and energy and momentum combine into the [[four-momentum]]. The components of these [[four-vector]]s depend on the [[frame of reference]] used, and change under [[Lorentz transformation]]s to other [[inertial frame]]s or [[Non-inertial reference frame|accelerated frame]]s.\n\nRelativistic angular momentum is less obvious. The classical definition of angular momentum is the [[cross product]] of position '''x''' with momentum '''p''' to obtain a [[pseudovector]] {{nowrap|'''x''' \u00d7 '''p'''}}, or alternatively as the [[exterior product]] to obtain a second order [[antisymmetric tensor]] {{nowrap|'''x''' \u2227 '''p'''}}. What does this combine with, if anything? There is another vector quantity not often discussed \u2013 it is the time-varying moment of mass polar-vector (''not'' the [[moment of inertia]]) related to the boost of the [[centre of mass]] of the system, and this combines with the classical angular momentum pseudovector to form an [[antisymmetric tensor]] of second order, in exactly the same way as the electric field polar-vector combines with the magnetic field pseudovector to form the electromagnetic field antisymmetric tensor. For rotating mass\u2013energy distributions (such as [[gyroscopes]], [[planet]]s, [[star]]s, and [[black hole]]s) instead of point-like particles, the '''angular momentum tensor''' is expressed in terms of the [[stress\u2013energy tensor]] of the rotating object.\n\nIn special relativity alone, in the [[rest frame]] of a spinning object, there is an intrinsic angular momentum analogous to the \"spin\" in [[quantum mechanics]] and [[relativistic quantum mechanics]], although for an extended body rather than a point particle. In relativistic quantum mechanics, [[elementary particle]]s have ''[[spin (physics)|spin]]'' and this is an additional contribution to the ''orbital'' angular momentum operator, yielding the ''total'' angular momentum tensor operator. In any case, the intrinsic \"spin\" addition to the orbital angular momentum of an object can be expressed in terms of the [[Pauli\u2013Lubanski pseudovector]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Geometry and quantum field theory|edition=2nd|author1=D.S.A.

It is related to the boost ([[relative velocity]]) of the [[centre of mass]] (COM) of the particle or system of particles, as measured in the [[lab frame]]. There is no universal symbol, nor even a universal name, for this quantity. Different authors may denote it by other symbols if any (for example '''\u03bc'''), may designate other names, and may define '''N''' to be the negative of what is used here. The above form has the advantage that it resembles the familiar [[Galilean transformation]] for position, which in turn is the non-relativistic boost transformation between inertial frames.\n\nThis vector is also additive: for a system of particles, the vector sum is the resultant\n\n:<math>\\sum_n \\mathbf{N}_n = \\sum_n m_n \\left(\\mathbf{x}_n - t \\mathbf{u}_n \\right) = \\left(\\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{COM}\\sum_n m_n - t \\sum_n m_n \\mathbf{u}_n \\right)= M_{\\mathrm{TOT}}(\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathrm{COM}}-\\mathbf{u}_{\\mathrm{COM}}t)</math>\n\nwhere the system's [[centre of mass]] position and velocity and total mass are respectively\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{COM} = \\frac{\\sum_n m_n\\mathbf{x}_n}{\\sum_n m_n}</math>, <math>\\mathbf{u}_\\mathrm{COM}=\\frac{\\sum_n m_n \\mathbf{u}_n}{\\sum_n m_n}</math>, <math>M_{\\mathrm{TOT}} = \\sum_n m_n</math>.\n\nFor an isolated system, '''N''' is conserved in time, which can be seen by differentiating with respect to time. The angular momentum '''L''' is a pseudovector, but '''N''' is an \"ordinary\" (polar) vector, and is therefore invariant under rotations.\n\nThe resultant '''N'''<sub>total</sub> for a multiparticle system has the physical visualization that, whatever the complicated motion of all the particles are, they move in such a way that the system's COM moves in a straight line. This does not necessarily mean all particles \"follow\" the COM, nor that all particles all move in almost the same direction simultaneously, only that the motion of all the particles are constrained in relation to the centre of mass.\n\nIn special relativity, if the particle moves with velocity '''u''' relative to the lab frame, then\n\n:<math>E = \\gamma(\\mathbf{u})m_0c^2, \\quad \\mathbf{p} = \\gamma(\\mathbf{u})m_0\\mathbf{u}</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>\\gamma (\\mathbf{u}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{u}}{c^2}}}</math>\n\nis the [[Lorentz factor]] and ''m''<sub>0</sub> the rest mass of the particle. Some authors use [[relativistic mass]]\n\n:<math>m = \\gamma(\\mathbf{u})m_0</math>\n\nor [[proper velocity]]\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{w} = \\gamma(\\mathbf{u})\\mathbf{u}</math>\n\nThe corresponding relativistic mass moment in terms of ''m''<sub>0</sub>, ''m'', '''u''', '''p''', ''E'', in the same lab frame is\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{N} = m\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{p}t = \\frac{E}{c^2}\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{p}t = \\gamma(\\mathbf{u})m_0(\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{u}t)</math>\n\ndefined here so that the relativistic equation in terms of the relativistic mass, and classical definition, have the same form. The Cartesian components are\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  N_x = mx - p_xt &= \\frac{E}{c^2}x - p_xt = \\gamma(u)m_0(x - u_x t) \\\\\n  N_y = my - p_yt &= \\frac{E}{c^2}y - p_yt = \\gamma(u)m_0(y - u_y t) \\\\\n  N_z = mz - p_zt &= \\frac{E}{c^2}z - p_zt = \\gamma(u)m_0(z - u_z t)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nExpressing '''N''' in terms of relativistic mass-energy and momentum, rather than rest mass and velocity, avoids extra Lorentz factors. However, relativistic mass is discouraged by some authors since it can be a misleading quantity to apply in certain equations.\n\n==Special relativity==\n\n===Coordinate transformations for a boost in the x direction===\n\nConsider a coordinate frame F&prime; which moves with velocity '''v''' = (''v'', 0, 0) relative to another frame F, along the direction of the coincident ''xx&prime;'' axes. The origins of the two coordinate frames coincide at times ''t'' = ''t''&prime; = 0. The mass\u2013energy ''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup> and momentum components '''p''' = (''p<sub>x</sub>'', ''p<sub>y</sub>'', ''p<sub>z</sub>'') of an object, as well as position coordinates '''x''' = (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') and time ''t'' in frame F are transformed to ''E''&prime; = ''m''&prime;''c''<sup>2</sup>, '''p'''&prime; = (''p<sub>x</sub>''&prime;, ''p<sub>y</sub>''&prime;, ''p<sub>z</sub>''&prime;), '''x'''&prime; = (''x''&prime;, ''y''&prime;, ''z''&prime;), and ''t''&prime; in F&prime; according to the [[Lorentz transformation]]s\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  t' &= \\gamma(v) \\left(t - \\frac{vx}{c^2}\\right) \\,,\\quad & E'   &= \\gamma(v) \\left(E - vp_x \\right) \\\\ \n  x' &= \\gamma(v) (x - vt) \\,,\\quad                        & p_x' &= \\gamma(v) \\left(p_x - \\frac{vE}{c^2}\\right) \\\\ \n  y' &= y \\,,\\quad                                         & p_y' &= p_y \\\\ \n  z' &= z \\,,\\quad                                         & p_z' &= p_z \\\\ \n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe Lorentz factor here applies to the velocity '''v''', the relative velocity between the frames.

If the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] is expressed with respect to angular variables as the [[generalized coordinates]], then the angular momenta are the [[functional derivative]]s of the Lagrangian with respect to the [[angular velocity|angular velocities]].  Referred to Cartesian coordinates, these are typically given by the off-diagonal shear terms of the spacelike part of the [[stress\u2013energy tensor]].  If the spacetime supports a [[Killing vector field]] tangent to a circle, then the angular momentum about the axis is conserved.\n\nOne also wishes to study the effect of a compact, rotating mass on its surrounding spacetime.  The prototype solution is of the [[Kerr metric]], which describes the spacetime around an axially symmetric [[black hole]].  It is obviously impossible to draw a point on the event horizon of a Kerr black hole and watch it circle around.  However, the solution does support a constant of the system that acts mathematically similar to an angular momentum.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Thomas precession]]\n*[[Angular momentum of light]]\n*[[Two-body problem in general relativity]]\n*[[Kepler problem in general relativity]]\n*[[Relativistic mechanics]]\n*[[Center of mass (relativistic)]]\n*[[Mathisson\u2013Papapetrou\u2013Dixon equations]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal|title=Center of mass in special and general relativity and its role in an effective description of spacetime|author1=C.

The relativistic quantity is subtly different from the [[three-dimensional]] quantity in [[classical mechanics]].\n\nAngular momentum is an important dynamical quantity derived from position and momentum. It is a measure of an object's rotational motion and resistance to stop rotating. Also, in the same way momentum conservation corresponds to translational symmetry, angular momentum conservation corresponds to rotational symmetry \u2013 the connection between [[symmetry (physics)|symmetries]] and [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]]s is made by [[Noether's theorem]]. While these concepts were originally discovered in [[classical mechanics]], they are also true and significant in special and general relativity. In terms of abstract algebra, the invariance of angular momentum, four-momentum, and other symmetries in spacetime, are described by the [[Lorentz group]], or more generally the [[Poincar\u00e9 group]].\n\n[[Physical quantity|Physical quantities]] that remain separate in classical physics are ''naturally combined'' in SR and GR by enforcing the postulates of relativity. Most notably, the space and time coordinates combine into the [[Four-vector#Four-position|four-position]], and energy and momentum combine into the [[four-momentum]]. The components of these [[four-vector]]s depend on the [[frame of reference]] used, and change under [[Lorentz transformation]]s to other [[inertial frame]]s or [[Non-inertial reference frame|accelerated frame]]s.\n\nRelativistic angular momentum is less obvious. The classical definition of angular momentum is the [[cross product]] of position '''x''' with momentum '''p''' to obtain a [[pseudovector]] {{nowrap|'''x''' \u00d7 '''p'''}}, or alternatively as the [[exterior product]] to obtain a second order [[antisymmetric tensor]] {{nowrap|'''x''' \u2227 '''p'''}}. What does this combine with, if anything? There is another vector quantity not often discussed \u2013 it is the time-varying moment of mass polar-vector (''not'' the [[moment of inertia]]) related to the boost of the [[centre of mass]] of the system, and this combines with the classical angular momentum pseudovector to form an [[antisymmetric tensor]] of second order, in exactly the same way as how the electric field polar-vector combines with the magnetic field pseudovector to form the electromagnetic field antisymmetric tensor. For rotating mass\u2013energy distributions (such as [[gyroscopes]], [[planet]]s, [[star]]s, and [[black hole]]s) instead of point-like particles, the '''angular momentum tensor''' is expressed in terms of the [[stress\u2013energy tensor]] of the rotating object.\n\nIn special relativity alone, in the [[rest frame]] of a spinning object; there is an intrinsic angular momentum analogous to the \"spin\" in [[quantum mechanics]] and [[relativistic quantum mechanics]], although for an extended body rather than a point particle. In relativistic quantum mechanics, [[elementary particle]]s have ''[[spin (physics)|spin]]'' and this is an additional contribution to the ''orbital'' angular momentum operator, yielding the ''total'' angular momentum tensor operator. In any case, the intrinsic \"spin\" addition to the orbital angular momentum of an object can be expressed in terms of the [[Pauli\u2013Lubanski pseudovector]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Geometry and quantum field theory|edition=2nd|author1=D.S.A.

It is related to the boost ([[relative velocity]]) of the [[centre of mass]] (COM) of the particle or system of particles, as measured in the [[lab frame]]. There is no universal symbol, nor even a universal name, for this quantity. Different authors may denote it by other symbols if any (for example '''\u03bc'''), may designate other names, and may define '''N''' to be the negative of what is used here. The above form has the advantage that it resembles the familiar [[Galilean transformation]] for position, which in turn is the non-relativistic boost transformation between inertial frames.\n\nThis vector is also additive: for a system of particles, the vector sum is the resultant\n\n:<math>\\sum_n \\mathbf{N}_n = \\sum_n m_n \\left(\\mathbf{x}_n - t \\mathbf{u}_n \\right) = \\left(\\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{COM}\\sum_n m_n - t \\sum_n m_n \\mathbf{u}_n \\right)= M_{\\mathrm{TOT}}(\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathrm{COM}}-\\mathbf{u}_{\\mathrm{COM}}t)</math>\n\nwhere the system's [[centre of mass]] position and velocity and total mass are respectively\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{COM} = \\frac{\\sum_n m_n\\mathbf{x}_n}{\\sum_n m_n}</math>, <math>\\mathbf{u}_\\mathrm{COM}=\\frac{\\sum_n m_n \\mathbf{u}_n}{\\sum_n m_n}</math>, <math>M_{\\mathrm{TOT}} = \\sum_n m_n</math>.\n\nFor an isolated system, '''N''' is conserved in time, which can be seen by differentiating with respect to time. The angular momentum '''L''' is a pseudovector, but '''N''' is an \"ordinary\" (polar) vector, and is therefore invariant under rotations.\n\nThe resultant '''N'''<sub>total</sub> for a multiparticle system has the physical visualization that, whatever the complicated motion of all the particles are, they move in such a way that the system's COM moves in a straight line. This does not necessarily mean all particles \"follow\" the COM, nor that all particles all move in almost the same direction simultaneously, only that the motion of all the particles are constrained in relation to the centre of mass.\n\nIn special relativity, if the particle moves with velocity '''u''' relative to the lab frame, then\n\n:<math>E = \\gamma(\\mathbf{u})m_0c^2, \\quad \\mathbf{p} = \\gamma(\\mathbf{u})m_0\\mathbf{u}</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>\\gamma (\\mathbf{u}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{u}}{c^2}}}</math>\n\nis the [[Lorentz factor]] and ''m''<sub>0</sub> the rest mass of the particle. Some authors use [[relativistic mass]]\n\n:<math>m = \\gamma(\\mathbf{u})m_0</math>\n\nor [[proper velocity]]\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{w} = \\gamma(\\mathbf{u})\\mathbf{u}</math>\n\nThe corresponding relativistic mass moment in terms of ''m''<sub>0</sub>, ''m'', '''u''', '''p''', ''E'', in the same lab frame is\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{N} = m\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{p}t = \\frac{E}{c^2}\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{p}t = \\gamma(\\mathbf{u})m_0(\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{u}t)</math>\n\ndefined here so that the relativistic equation in terms of the relativistic mass, and classical definition, have the same form. The Cartesian components are\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  N_x = mx - p_xt &= \\frac{E}{c^2}x - p_xt = \\gamma(u)m_0(x - u_x t) \\\\\n  N_y = my - p_yt &= \\frac{E}{c^2}y - p_yt = \\gamma(u)m_0(y - u_y t) \\\\\n  N_z = mz - p_zt &= \\frac{E}{c^2}z - p_zt = \\gamma(u)m_0(z - u_z t)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nExpressing '''N''' in terms of relativistic mass-energy and momentum, rather than rest mass and velocity, avoids extra Lorentz factors. However, relativistic mass is discouraged by some authors since it can be a misleading quantity to apply in certain equations.\n\n==Special relativity==\n\n===Coordinate transformations for a boost in the x direction===\n\nConsider a coordinate frame F&prime; which moves with velocity '''v''' = (''v'', 0, 0) relative to another frame F, along the direction of the coincident ''xx&prime;'' axes. The origins of the two coordinate frames coincide at times ''t'' = ''t''&prime; = 0. The mass\u2013energy ''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup> and momentum components '''p''' = (''p<sub>x</sub>'', ''p<sub>y</sub>'', ''p<sub>z</sub>'') of an object, as well as position coordinates '''x''' = (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') and time ''t'' in frame F are transformed to ''E''&prime; = ''m''&prime;''c''<sup>2</sup>, '''p'''&prime; = (''p<sub>x</sub>''&prime;, ''p<sub>y</sub>''&prime;, ''p<sub>z</sub>''&prime;), '''x'''&prime; = (''x''&prime;, ''y''&prime;, ''z''&prime;), and ''t''&prime; in F&prime; according to the [[Lorentz transformation]]s\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  t' &= \\gamma(v) \\left(t - \\frac{vx}{c^2}\\right) \\,,\\quad & E'   &= \\gamma(v) \\left(E - vp_x \\right) \\\\ \n  x' &= \\gamma(v) (x - vt) \\,,\\quad                        & p_x' &= \\gamma(v) \\left(p_x - \\frac{vE}{c^2}\\right) \\\\ \n  y' &= y \\,,\\quad                                         & p_y' &= p_y \\\\ \n  z' &= z \\,,\\quad                                         & p_z' &= p_z \\\\ \n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe Lorentz factor here applies to the velocity '''v''', the relative velocity between the frames.

If the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] is expressed with respect to angular variables as the [[generalized coordinates]], then the angular momenta are the [[functional derivative]]s of the Lagrangian with respect to the [[angular velocity|angular velocities]].  Referred to Cartesian coordinates, these are typically given by the off-diagonal shear terms of the spacelike part of the [[stress\u2013energy tensor]].  If the spacetime supports a [[Killing vector field]] tangent to a circle, then the angular momentum about the axis is conserved.\n\nOne also wishes to study the effect of a compact, rotating mass on its surrounding spacetime.  The prototype solution is of the [[Kerr metric]], which describes the spacetime around an axially symmetric [[black hole]].  It is obviously impossible to draw a point on the event horizon of a Kerr black hole and watch it circle around.  However, the solution does support a constant of the system that acts mathematically similar to an angular momentum.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Thomas precession]]\n*[[Angular momentum of light]]\n*[[Two-body problem in general relativity]]\n*[[Kepler problem in general relativity]]\n*[[Relativistic mechanics]]\n*[[Center of mass (relativistic)]]\n*[[Mathisson\u2013Papapetrou\u2013Dixon equations]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal|title=Center of mass in special and general relativity and its role in an effective description of spacetime|author1=C.

At the age of 14, Vereen enrolled at the [[High School of Performing Arts]], where he studied under world-renowned choreographers [[Martha Graham]], [[George Balanchine]], and [[Jerome Robbins]]. Upon his graduation, he struggled to find suitable stage work and was often forced to take odd jobs to supplement his income. \n\n==Career==\n===Stage===\nWhen Vereen was 18 years old he made his New York stage bow [[off-off Broadway]] in ''The Prodigal Son'' at the Greenwich Mews Theater.

He returned to New York City to play Claude in ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' in the Broadway production, before joining the national touring company.\n\nThe following year, he was cast opposite Davis in the film adaptation of ''[[Sweet Charity (film)|Sweet Charity]]''.

Lee\".\n\nIn 1981, Vereen performed at [[Ronald Reagan]]'s first inauguration. The performance generated controversy as Vereen performed the first part of the show in [[blackface]]. Before the finale, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] cut the live performance, generating confusion and anger from viewers at home.<ref name=\"ReaganPerformance\">{{cite news|last1=L\u2019Official|first1=Pete|title=When Ben Vereen Wore Blackface to Reagan's Inaugural Gala|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/revisiting-ben-vereens-misunderstood-blackface-inaugural-performance|accessdate=November 23, 2017|work=The New Yorker|date=January 6, 2017}}</ref> According to video artist [[Edgar Arcenaux]], what TV viewers didn\u2019t see was the second part of the performance, in which Vereen mimicked being refused service because of his color while trying to buy the [[Republican_Party_(United_States)|Republican]] elite a congratulatory drink.
