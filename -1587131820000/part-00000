She is one of Finland's most-cherished modernist painters. She is most widely known for her [[Realism (arts)|realist]] works and self-portraits, and less well known for her landscapes and still lifes. Throughout her long life, her work changed dramatically beginning with French-influenced realism and plein air painting. It gradually evolved towards portraits and still life paintings.  At the beginning of her career she often produced historical paintings, such as the ''Wounded Warrior in the Snow'' (1880), ''At the Door of Link\u00f6ping Jail in 1600'' (1882) and ''The Death of Wilhelm von Schwerin'' (1886). Historical paintings were usually the realm of male painters, as was the experimentation with modern influences and French radical naturalism. As a result, her works produced mostly in the 1880s did not receive a favourable reception until later in her life.<ref name=\"KB\">{{cite web |url= https://kansallisbiografia.fi/english/person/4115 | author =Konttinen, Riitta |title= Schjerfbeck, Helene (1862\u20131946)  |date= 16 September 1997 |website= Biografiakeskus |publisher= Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura | language = English | access-date=16 October 2015 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>''Her work starts with a dazzlingly skilled, somewhat melancholic version of late-19th-century academic realism\u2026it ends with distilled, nearly abstract images in which pure paint and cryptic description are held in perfect balance.''

Her fees were paid by [[Adolf von Becker]], who saw promise in her.<ref>Ahtola-Moorhouse, Lena: 'Schjerfbeck, Helene [Helena] (Sofia)'</ref> At this school  Schjerfbeck met [[Helena Westermarck]].

A little over a year after her father's death, Schjerfbeck graduated from the Finnish Art Society drawing school. She continued her education, with Westermarck, at a private academy run by Adolf von Becker, which utilised the [[University of Helsinki]] drawing studio. Professor G. Asp paid for her tuition to Becker's private academy. There, Becker himself taught her French [[oil painting]] techniques.\n\nIn 1879, at the age of 17, Schjerfbeck won third prize in a competition organised by the Finnish Art Society, and in 1880 her work was displayed in an annual Finnish Art Society exhibition. That summer Schjerfbeck spent time at a manor owned by her aunt on her mother's side, Selma Printz, and Selma's husband Thomas Adlercreutz. There she spent time drawing and painting her cousins. Schjerfbeck became particularly close to her cousin Selma Adlercreutz, who was her age. In 1880, she set off to [[Paris]] later that year after receiving a travel grant from the Imperial Russian Senate.\n\n==Career==\nIn Paris, Schjerfbeck painted with Helena Westermarck, then left to study with [[L\u00e9on Bonnat]] at Mme Tr\u00e9lat de Vigny's studio. In 1881 she moved to the [[Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi]], where she studied once again with Westermarck. The Imperial Senate gave her another scholarship, which she used to spend a couple of months in [[Meudon]], and then a few more months in [[Pont-Aven]] a small fishing in [[Concarneau]], Brittany. She then went back to the Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi briefly, before returning to the Adlercreutz family manor in Finland. Schjerfbeck continued to move around frequently, painting and studying with various people. Schjerfbeck made money by continuing to put her paintings in the Art Society's exhibitions, and she also did illustrations for books. After returning to Finland in 1882, in 1884 she was back in Paris at the Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi with Westermarck, but this time they were working there. During this time she participated in Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts\u2019 The Salon and painted again in Brittany. In the chapel of Tr\u00e8molo near the village of Pont-Aven Schjerfbeck produced the painting ''The Door'' (1884).\n\nDuring late Autumn 1883, Schjerfbeck got engaged to an unknown painter. According to Lena Holger's investigations and research, the fianc\u00e9 was a Swedish painter Otto Hagborg who also lived in Pont-Aven in the winter and spring of 1883\u20131884. The engagement, however, came to an end in 1885 when a problem with Schjerfbeck's hip lead the groom's family to suspect tuberculosis. In reality the issue was a result of her fall during childhood. Schjerfbeck never married.<ref name=\"KB\"/>\n\nAfter spending a year in Finland, Schjerfbeck travelled again to Paris in the autumn of 1886. Schjerfbeck was given more money to travel by a man from the Finnish Art Society and in 1887 she travelled to [[St Ives, Cornwall]], in Britain.<ref name=\"KB\"/> There she painted''The Bakery'' (1887) and ''The Convalescent'', the latter winning the bronze medal at the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|1889 Paris World Fair]]. The painting was later bought by the Finnish Art Society. During this period Schjerfbeck was painting in a naturalistic plein-air style.\n\nIn the 1890s Schjerfbeck started teaching regularly in Finland at the Art Society drawing school, but in 1901 she became too ill to teach and in 1902 she resigned from her post. She moved to [[Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4]], which was known for it's sanatorium, all while taking care of her mother who lived with her (the mother died in 1923). While living in Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4, she continued to paint and exhibit.<ref name=\"NY\"/> \"Schjerfbeck\u2019s sole contact with the art world was through magazines sent by friends.\"<ref>[[Facos, Michelle]].

Her work has been compared to that of artists such as [[James McNeill Whistler]] and [[Edvard Munch]],<ref name=\"NY\"/> but from 1905 her paintings took on a character that was hers alone. She continued experimenting with various techniques such as using different types of [[underpainting]].\n\nIn 1913 Schjerfbeck met the art-dealer G\u00f6sta Stenman, with whose encouragement she exhibited at [[Malm\u00f6]] in 1914, [[Stockholm]] in 1916 and [[St Petersburg]] in 1917. In 1917 Stenman organised her first solo exhibition and in that year Einar Reuter (alias H. Ahtela) published the first Schjerfbeck monograph. Later she exhibited at Copenhagen (1919), Gothenburg (1923) and Stockholm (1934). In 1937 Stenman organised another solo exhibition for her in Stockholm,<ref name=\"NY\"/> and in 1938 he began paying her a monthly stipend. Her paintings were successfully displayed in several exhibitions in Sweden in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\n== Later years and death ==\nAs the years passed, Schjerfbeck travelled less. When a family matter arose, such as a death, she would travel back to her home city of Helsinki and she spent most of 1920 in [[Eken\u00e4s (Finland)|Eken\u00e4s]], but by 1921 she was back living in Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4.\n\nFor about a year, Schjerfbeck moved to a farm in [[Tenala]] to get away from the [[Winter War]], but went back to Eken\u00e4s in the middle of 1940. She later moved into a nursing home, where she resided for less than a year before moving to the Luontola sanatorium. In 1944 she moved into the [[Saltsj\u00f6baden]] spa hotel in [[Sweden]], where she continued to paint actively even during her last years; e.g. the series of self-portraits.<ref name=\"KB\"/>\nShe died on January 23, 1946 and was buried at the [[Hietaniemi Cemetery]] in Helsinki.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hietaniemen hautausmaa\u2013 merkitt\u00e4vi\u00e4 vainajia|url=https://www.helsinginseurakunnat.fi/material/attachments/hautausmaat/hietaniemi/w8GZkM0y7/Hietaniemen_merkittavia_vainajia.pdf |publisher= Kirkko Helsingiss\u00e4 |access-date= November 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Work ==\n[[File:Tanssiaiskengat iso by Helena Schjerfbeck 1882.jpg|thumb|''Dancing Shoes''.

She is one of Finland\u2019s most-cherished modernist painters. She is most widely known for her [[Realism (arts)|realist]] works and self-portraits, and less well known for her landscapes and still lifes. Throughout her long life, her work changed dramatically beginning with French-influenced realism and plein air painting. It gradually evolved towards portraits and still life paintings.  At the beginning of her career she often produced historical paintings, such as the ''Wounded Warrior in the Snow'' (1880), ''At the Door of Link\u00f6ping Jail in 1600'' (1882) and ''The Death of Wilhelm von Schwerin'' (1886). Historical paintings were usually the realm of male painters, as was the experimentation with modern influences and French radical naturalism. As a result, her works produced mostly in the 1880s did not receive a favourable reception until later in her life. <ref name=\"KB\">{{cite web |url= https://kansallisbiografia.fi/english/person/4115 | author =Konttinen, Riitta |title= Schjerfbeck, Helene (1862\u20131946)  |date= 16 September 1997 |website= Biografiakeskus |publisher= Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura | language = English | access-date=16 October 2015 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>''Her work starts with a dazzlingly skilled, somewhat melancholic version of late-19th-century academic realism\u2026it ends with distilled, nearly abstract images in which pure paint and cryptic description are held in perfect balance.''

A little over a year after her father's death, Schjerfbeck graduated from the Finnish Art Society drawing school. She continued her education, with Westermarck, at a private academy run by Adolf von Becker, which utilised the [[University of Helsinki]] drawing studio. Professor G. Asp paid for her tuition to Becker's private academy. There, Becker himself taught her French [[oil painting]] techniques.\n\nIn 1879, at the age of 17, Schjerfbeck won third prize in a competition organised by the Finnish Art Society, and in 1880 her work was displayed in an annual Finnish Art Society exhibition. That summer Schjerfbeck spent time at a manor owned by her aunt on her mother's side, Selma Printz, and Selma's husband Thomas Adlercreutz. There she spent time drawing and painting her cousins. Schjerfbeck became particularly close to her cousin Selma Adlercreutz, who was her age.

Thus, the key feature that allows hemoglobin F to bind more strongly to oxygen is by having \u03b3 subunits (instead of \u03b2, for example). In fact, some naturally existing molecules in our body can bind to hemoglobin and change its binding affinity for oxygen. One of the molecules is [[2,3-bisphosphoglycerate|2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG)]] and it enhances hemoglobin\u2019s ability to release oxygen.<ref name=\"Gerald 2018\">{{Cite book | authors= Litwack G| title= Human Biochemistry | year=2018 | chapter=Chapter 8 \u2013 Glycolysis and Glocuneogenesis | publisher=Academic press| isbn = 978-0-12-383864-3}}</ref> 2,3-BPG interacts much more with hemoglobin A than hemoglobin F. This is because the adult \u03b2 subunit has more positive charges than the fetal \u03b3 subunit, which attract the negative charges from 2,3-BPG.

As a consequence, less hemoglobin is available and this affects oxygen supply to the tissues. \nHemoglobin Barts syndrome manifests when all four genes coding for \u03b1 subunit are deleted. This is often fatal for the fetus carrying the disorder, as in the absence of \u03b1 subunits, a form of hemoglobin with four \u03b3 subunits, hemoglobin Barts, is produced. This form of hemoglobin isn\u2019t fit for oxygen exchange precisely due to its very high affinity for oxygen.

Firstly, the presence of hemoglobin F in the fetus allows a stronger binding to oxygen than maternal hemoglobin (see section ''Why hemoglobin F has high oxygen affinity''). Secondly, the mother\u2019s bloodstream is richer in oxygen that the fetus\u2019, so oxygen naturally flows towards the fetal circulation by diffusion.<ref name=\"Metcalfe1967\">{{cite journal | authors=Metcalfe J, Bartels H and Moll W |title= Gas exchange in the pregnant uterus.  |journal= Physiological reviews |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=782-838 |date=1967 |doi= 10.1152/physrev.1967.47.4.782 }}</ref> The final factor is related to the effects of pH on maternal and fetal hemoglobin. As the maternal blood acquires more carbon dioxide, it becomes more acidic and this favours the release of oxygen by the maternal hemoglobin.

Dyre Avenue-bound 5 trains would start running local along the White Plains Road Line, while 2 trains would run express. Nereid Avenue-bound 5 trains would continue to run express in the Bronx. As part of the change, the frequency of service at White Plains Road Line local station would decrease from 12 trains per hour to 7 trains per hour.

Dyre Avenue-bound '''5''' trains would start running local along the White Plains Road Line, while '''2''' trains would run express. Nereid Avenue-bound '''5''' trains would continue to run express in the Bronx. As part of the change, the frequency of service at White Plains Road Line local station would decrease from 12 trains per hour to 7 trains per hour.
