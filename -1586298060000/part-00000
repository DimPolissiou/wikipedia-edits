Many factors contributed to the success of this series.

It then moves into a flashback to Kin's childhood years.\n\n===1960s===\nThe young Kin (played by Gregory Lee) was born into a poor and struggling family. Kin's parents are always fighting over money because his father, Ting Wing Cheung (also played by Felix Wong) is addicted to gambling and has used up the family's savings, much to the displeasure of his wife, Mui Fan Fong (Yammie Nam). However, despite Ting Wing Cheung's weak personality and lack of self-control, he is still a caring and loving father.\n\nDesperate for money to spend for the new year, Fong, an ex-thief, pick-pockets a high-ranking official who is murdered shortly after the theft by another hand. Fond is framed for the murder, and is forced through a humiliating trial, helped by the elderly lawyer Martin Chu Siu-shan (Cheng Gwan Min) who defends her against the ruthless prosecutor, Fung Sai Bong (Ngok Wah). \n\nFong nearly wins her freedom but there are complications with a false witness statement. Even when that is revoked, Martin becomes the sole witness to the true murderer's deathbed confession and he has to recuse himself. His colleague ends up losing the appeal, and Fong is sentenced to hang once her son, Ding Yau Hong is born. Before Fong dies, she makes Kin promise to always protect Hong.\n\nUpon his wife's death, Cheung goes mad and tries to jump off a building with his children, and luckily is stopped by his childless ex-boss, Lee Ho Cheun (Wu Fung), who takes in the two children after Cheung is admitted to a mental asylum. His wife, Yip Sau Wan (So Hung Shuen) is ecstatic even though she already has two other adopted children, Chow Zhi Mun and Chan Siu Ling.\n\nCheun dies suddenly from a brain haemorrhage following a stroke, and the family is bankrupted. Gossips tell Wan that it is all because of Hong, who is a jinx. Wan is shocked, but refuses to abandon Hong.\n\nTaking her four children, Wan travels to Macau to seek help from her brother-in-law (Kong Ngai), who insults her and tells her to become a prostitute. She leaves angrily and works very hard menial jobs to support all four kids.\n\n===1980s===\n\nIn 1982{{ref|a}}, Wan is working as a cleaner in a hospital with Nurse Lan, whose daughter is Chiu Kar Mun (Maggie Shiu).\n\nThe four children she had taken in are all grown up. Kin (Felix Wong) works multiple jobs over the years from a young age to help Wan support the family. Hong (Deric Wan) has just finished high school and is seeking a place at the law faculty of the University of Hong Kong. Chan Siu Ling (Carrie Ho) works as a bank teller, and Zhou Zhi Mun (Spencer Leung) is still in Form Six of high school.\n\nAfter the years of hardship, Wan has grown cold, distant and very moody, leading to communication barriers with the children. Luckily, Kin is there as the glue to stick the family together.\n\nWan's brother-in-law has now fallen into hard times, and begs lowly for Wan to take in his daughter, Lee Wah (Kathy Chow). Wan forgives him and takes the nerdy, timid Wah in. Wah quickly gains a place in everyone's hearts.\n\nNot content to live in cheap accommodations forever, Hong wants to apply for a law degree. Wan opposes this plan, believing that Hong should stick to his class and find a job like Kin. But Hong wants to prove his self-worth, and Kin supports him all the way, and he is accepted at the university. Hong may be ambitious, but he sees Wan's hardship and sacrifice, as well as her dislike of him, so he wants to prove to her that he will not be a liability and gain her praise. Kin works in the university cafeteria.\n\nOnce in university, Hong is immediately singled out as an outsider by his rich classmates (Frankie Lam and Evergreen Mak), as well as the snobbish Sam Fung  (Ng Kai Ming), who Hong sucks up to in order to fit in.\n\nHong finds out that Sam's father is the prosecutor turned immensely wealthy businessman Fung Sai Bong, who is chairman of Kai Mei Holdings. Bong is also on the board of Ngai Holdings, along with his eldest son Michael. Casting old grudges and nervousness aside, Hong tries to get close to him to gain job opportunities. Bong takes an instant liking to the diligent Hong. This angers Kin, who hates the whole Fung family. Hong won't let go of this opportunity to work in Bong's company and quarrels with Kin. Hong moves out of the apartment, and into the university hostel.\n\nOnce exposed to the upper class, Hong becomes more and more obsessed with money and status, and manipulates Wah, who has a crush on him, to do all his projects while he is out socializing with the upper class. Hong later quarrels with Kin over Wah while the latter is driving, resulting in an accident in which Hong suffers permanent leg damage. He then sets his sights on pretty, intelligent medical student, Chiu Kar Mun (Maggie Shiu), who already has a doctor boyfriend, Lau Wai Gong, when she saves his life at the accident site.  By using his jealous tendencies, Hong makes Dr. Lau go mad and claims Kar Mun as his own.\n\nHe finally fails his course once Wah realizes that he is a jerk and stops helping him, and he drops out, seeing a brighter future working under Bong. Kin and Hong quarrel over this issue.\n\nKin has always had a crush on Wah, but she only had eyes for Hong. Kin is approached by his best friend who works in a TV station, to appear on a TV show where the lives of three people with the same birthdates are compared. The other two are the mighty and wealthy heiress Ngai Chor Gwan (Carina Lau), and an arrogant fashion designer, Yeung Pak Kai (Gilbert Lam).\n\nMr. Yeung is an orphan. Similar to Kin, his parents died at an early age. He worked hard, juggling his studies and work and was soon recognized as Asia's top fashion designer.\n\nGwan is the elder daughter of tycoon and Ngai Holdings chairman Ngai Kwan (Kwan Hoi San), who is Bong's business rival and elder cousin-in-law. Her mother died when Gwan was only six. Gwan has a younger half-brother, [[general manager]] Francis Ngai Chun Kit (Canti Lau) who is highly intelligent, responsible, mature and has a flair for business. Tired of being constantly over-shadowed, Gwan does not even try to gain her father's approval. She becomes increasingly lazy and distant from her family, which causes her father to criticize her even more. She thinks Kwan doesn't love her at all, but in fact he does. She also keeps a close relationship with Kit, who helps her out a lot.\n\nGwan and Kin gradually become friends despite their large social differences, and she secretly falls for Kin. However, Kin ends up with Wah, when she finally realizes the love he has for her. Kin supports Wah through her advertising course, and Gwan remains a friend to both, hiding her feelings inside.\n\nDepressed after Hong and Wah start going out, Gwan considers dating a rich man (Gallen Lo) and even agrees to his proposal, but chickens out at the last minute. Kwan is angered, and Gwan moves out and realizes that her past idol life was too boring. She starts becoming independent with the help of Kin. She finds a job as a magazine journalist, and is happy her with her boss(Michael Tao) who likes her.\n\nHong works for Sai Bong's eldest son, general manager Michael (Lee Shing-cheong). Bong attempts a [[hostile takeover]] of Ngai Holdings with Michael's underhanded help, but Kit gains evidence of Michael's illegal dealings and attempts to stop the takeover. An explosive confrontation leads to Michael running Kit over in Hong's [[Subaru Leone|car]], with Hong at the steering wheel. Michael refuses to take responsibility for the murder; Hong manipulates Kin into taking the rap for him, using Kin's love for him as well as his promise to his dying mother to always protect Hong. Hong genuinely feels sorry, and tries to make up for it by giving more money to Wan, who throws it in his face and kicks him out. Once Kin finds out it was Kit who was killed in the car accident, he falls out with Gwan, who fails to persuade him to let Hong take responsibility for his own actions.\n\nKin is sentenced to jail for two years, and in jail he forms a close friendship with several men, each of whom has his own story to tell. Kwun, who has also been arrested for corruption charges, eventually meets Kin in jail, and his dislike for Kin gradually lessens and he learns to appreciate him. Even after reconciling with her father, Gwan still refuses to return to the family company, so her stepmother takes over.\n\nLing tries out for TVB acting classes, and gets promoted. Wan is very against this, but relents when she sees Ling's sincerity and interest. She is also persuaded by Kin's best friend, Fook, who loves Ling. She explains her concerns as stemming from the fact that Ling's biological mother was a famous actress and singer, who became someone's mistress and abandoned her child to marry rich in Thailand. Wan is worried that the pressures in the entertainment field will soon push Ling into following her mother's path.\n\nAll is well until Ling's biological mother, Fong Hung (Chan Lai See) returns to Hong Kong. Ling is disappointed to find her a manipulative and materialistic person, but soon understands the pressures that her teenage mother had to endure and forgives her. But it turns out that Hung is a heavy gambler, and owes loan sharks a lot of money. Under Hong's guidance, Ling becomes Michael's mistress to pay off her mother's continuing debts, ending her sweet-budding romance with Fook. Wan is enraged and disowns her.\n\nMeanwhile, the youngest brother, Mun, finds his biological parents, who have become rich over the years, but his newfound siblings look down on him. To prove himself, he becomes Michael's personal assistant, a high-paying but humiliating job. Wan disowns him too.\n\nKin returns to a relieved Wan and happy Wah, who is finishing off her course. He is still working multiple jobs to make ends meet, and runs back into Gwan. They become friends again. Gwan still has a crush on Kin. Kin meets up with his friends from prison and start up a food stall which becomes very successful. Wah becomes jealous of Gwan's closeness with Kin.\n\nOver time, Hong has lost his interest in Kar Mun and seeks to woo Bong's daughter Cindy for the ulterior motive of climbing the corporate ladder. They visit Nurse Lan in Malaysia. Kar Mun uses her uncle, a Malaysian general (Chu Tit Wo), to pressure Hong into marriage. Desperate, Hong plans the perfect murder, and pushes Kar Mun off a moving train, framing it as a suicide over her guilt for a fictional affair. Unknown to him, Kar Mun attempted suicide some days earlier and left a suicide note in her second clothes.\n\nHong happily returns to propose to Cindy, and the two scale the corporate ladder, overtaking Michael's position in the company. This causes Michael to become increasingly abusive towards Ling and Mun.\n\nKin and Wah grow apart as her career grows more successful. Afraid that she might change, Wah proposes to Kin, but on the eve of the wedding, Kin discovers a letter by Wah to her friend saying that she only wants to marry Kin to repay him for his help, and also highlights other concerns for their future. Kin wants Wah to be happy, so he cancels the wedding. Wah goes off to Malaysia to work.\n\nLing gets pregnant and is dumped by Michael. She tries to commit suicide, but Gwan persuades her to live on. Supported by both mothers, she quits acting and opens a shop. Fook, who still loves Ling proposes to her repeatedly, and even wants to take her son as his own, but out of guilt and shame, she refuses. Mun meets a girlfriend (Carol Yeung). Building up his self-confidence and dignity, he quits his job and helps Kin out.\n\nKin and Gwan get drunk and sleep together, causing both of them to feel awkward afterwards. Gwan's boss tells Kin that Gwan has been in love with him for a long time. Moved, Kin chases after Gwan, who rejects him, feeling that he is only pursuing her out of obligation after sleeping with her. But eventually, he convinces her that his feelings are sincere, and they get together.\n\nKin and his friends move onto opening a restaurant, but his chefs bail out on him, so they have to resort to using Chinese steam-bowl to save the business which strangely, attracts a lot of customers. Gwan supports him all the way, and Kwun gradually accepts Kin. Kin and his friends become rich.\n\nCindy proves to be a good wife, as she successfully patches up the relationship between Hong and the rest of his family. Hong is moved by her actions, and his siblings all like her, but they still continue to hate her father and brother.\n\nWan visits the ailing Nurse Lan in Malaysia, and finds Kar Mun's genuine suicide note; the note reveals Hong's infidelity and his plan to marry Cindy. Hong attempts to claim the note back, but when Wan cannot produce it Hong strangles her to death in a fit of rage.\n\nKin gets a call from Nurse Lan and hears that Wan had left Malaysia that day, but realizes that she had yet to return. He rushes off to Malaysia with Wah to find Wan. Based on eyewitness accounts, the discovery of the suicide note and the discovery of Wan's body, Kin concludes that Hong killed Wan. Kin attempts to have Hong extradited for the two murders, but he is not charged due to a technicality; however, Hong will be executed if he sets foot in Malaysia.\n\nMun confronts Hong in his office. In a fit of anger, he stabs Hong with a letter opener and holds him hostage. He is arrested and thrown into prison hospital, having sustained an injury.\n\nCindy is horrified and upon close observation, she sees Hong's true colours. Cindy requests a divorce from Hong, which is supported by her father, even though she finds herself pregnant. Hong desperately tries to get Cindy back, but she remains determined and strong-willed. Hong loses his position in Kai Mei, and his failed attempt to start his own business is compounded by major stock market losses. During this time, Hong continually extorts money from Cindy to feed his vices.\n\nCindy is very depressed and resorts to drinking. Hong uses her alcoholism to threaten to challenge her for custody of their son and blackmails her for millions of dollars. Just when Cindy aims to quit drinking, she dies from a heart attack, a congenital condition. As they are not properly divorced yet, Hong inherits all her money.\n\nWah eventually returns to Macau to pick up her parents, and meanwhile, tries to get Kin back. She sees Gwan as a third wheel and Kin as hers, but Kin asserts that he only loves Gwan. Wah leaves for Malaysia with her parents and Kin for the Middle East, but the plane crashes and she is the sole survivor, paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nWah uses her disability to cling to Kin. Kin feels guilty and tries to satisfy all her demands, giving Wah new hope that they can be together. Wah becomes increasingly possessive of Kin and hostile towards Gwan, who just wants to help. Kin does nothing to reassure her, and Gwan finally calls him on it, throwing their wedding invitations in his face.\n\nHong, still in financial trouble, kidnaps his own son (under Bong's custody) for ransom, but his accomplice is arrested and the ransom money is marked with a dye pack. Desperate to escape Hong Kong but without the money for the fare, he robs Kin, Wah and Ling at knifepoint but is caught after fighting with Kin and sent to prison hospital.\n\nKin finally confronts Wah about his feelings. He confidently says that he only loves Gwan, and will only marry her. Wah gives him her blessing, and attends the wedding. But that night, she gets depressed and slits her wrists, bleeding to death.\n\nKin helps out Kwan in the company. After letting go of his hatred, he even helped out Bong, causing reconciliation between the Ngai, Ting and Fung families. Kwan is very happy.\n\n===1990s===\nYears later, Kwan dies, and leaves his fortune and possessions to Kin and Gwan. The couple have a son, and a happy marriage.\n\nKin spots the destitute Hong on the streets. He discovers that Hong has been secretly visiting his own son, and pities him. He gives him a lowly job at one of his restaurants, and otherwise ignores him, as Gwan still hates him for killing Kit.\n\nHong is enraged that Kin enjoys a happy life. Plotting revenge, he poisons Kin's family while he is out for dinner at the restaurant where he works, framing it on a mentally unstable colleague. His plan is to murder them all, so that the family fortune would pass to the next blood relative, which would be him.\n\nKin and Gwan both survive, but their young son and six others don't make it. Kin finds electronic bugs in his study and phone and after talking to his lawyer, deduces that it was Hong behind the poisoning. He is deeply conflicted.\n\nKin offers Hong an executive position, much to the dislike of his partners, and they slowly plot against him, not knowing that this is all a ploy to trap Hong into thinking that he has Kin's absolute trust. Gwan is enraged because she doesn't know what is going on, but finds solace in volunteering for the local church. Meanwhile, Hong bonds with his son and plans to challenge Bong for custody. He is happy when the kid calls him \"Father.\"\n\nKin sets a ploy to trap Hong into thinking all is well again. But Gwan and his partners, who don't know what's really going on, are enraged. Once Hong believes he has Kin's absolute trust, Kin sets him up to be arrested in Malaysia. Hong is sentenced to death for the murders of Wan and Kar Mun.\n\nHong repents in prison and begs Kin to bring his son to see him one last time before his execution. Michael has been diagnosed with terminal [[oesophageal cancer]], and is suffering greatly. Kin has a conversation with a broken Bong about karma, and Bong lets Kin take Hong's son to see Hong after much persuasion.\n\nHong cries desperately upon seeing his son, who doesn't understand what is going on. Hong begs Kin to save him, but Kin tells him that it is time he stopped protecting him, and let him walk alone. Hong is disappointed but does not seem to have much hatred left. He is led to the gallows - just like his mother.\n\nGwan separates from Kin upon finding out that he did not consult her on such a serious matter. She wants a divorce, but Kin doesn't. She leaves for Ethiopia to do volunteer work. Kin says he will wait for her at the church where they got married, ten years later, on their shared birthday.\n\nFook approaches Kin again to do a ten-year reunion of the old show. Mr. Yeung has been bankrupted since but is a much more sensitive and caring person now, and Kin cries on air, begging Gwan to return.\n\nThe story comes out of the flashback, returning to the first scene where Kin is sitting by the telephone. Gwun calls him and tells him that she is coming home. But that day, both he and Mr. Yeung are involved in a crash. Ethiopia also has a serious earthquake and related landslides, killing hundreds. They have lost contact with Gwan. Mr. Yeung dies, but Kin survives. He still clings to the hope that Gwan is alive and will return to him.\n\nTen years later, there is still no news of Gwan. But Kin still has high hopes and is ecstatic when the tenth shared birthday comes. He gets ready to go down to the church. Man and wife are married, and after so many years of waiting, Fook finally gets a nod to his marriage proposal from Ling, with the help of her son who sees him as a father.\n\nKin happily waits in the church, getting more anxious as the clock ticks closer to midnight and his hope slowly dies. He waits past midnight, and eventually falls asleep on a pew.\n\nA lady in red appears at the door. She approaches the sleeping Kin, touching his face lovingly. Her tears drop onto his face, and she leaves. Kin wakes up and finds a note saying Gwan has died. But he refuses to believe it and calls out for her to come back.\n\n===Ending===\nMany people believe it was Kin's sister who came to drop off a note so he will move on with his life.\n\nSome sources say it is Gwan's ghost who came to visit him, assuming she had died from the landslides. The fact that she touched his face lovingly could imply she has forgiven him.\n\nSome sources also state that it was possible Gwan survived, but she was upset after the demise of Fei, and wanted to start life afresh.\n\n25 years after the series finale aired, lead actor Felix Wong who played Kin finally reveals that producer Wai Ka Fai himself stated it was really Kin's sister who came to drop off the note as Gwan had already died in Ethiopia. But they used Carina Lau who played Gwan for the ending scene because she has 'prettier legs' and the scene will not be showing the face of the actress. This also ended up making the ending scene more surreal.\n\n==Filming==\nPrincipal filming occurred in Hong Kong with some scenes set in Macau.

Many factors contributed to the success of this series.

It then moves into a flashback to Kin's childhood years.\n\n===1960s===\nThe young Kin (played by Gregory Lee) was born into a poor and struggling family. Kin's parents are always fighting over money because his father, Ting Wing Cheung (also played by Felix Wong) is addicted to gambling and has used up the family's savings, much to the displeasure of his wife, Mui Fan Fong (Yammie Nam). However, despite Ting Wing Cheung's weak personality and lack of self-control, he is still a caring and loving father.\n\nDesperate for money to spend for the new year, Fong, an ex-thief, pick-pockets a high-ranking official who is murdered shortly after the theft by another hand. Fond is framed for the murder, and is forced through a humiliating trial, helped by the elderly lawyer Martin Chu Siu-shan (Cheng Gwan Min) who defends her against the ruthless prosecutor, Fung Sai Bong (Ngok Wah). \n\nFong nearly wins her freedom but there are complications with a false witness statement. Even when that is revoked, Martin becomes the sole witness to the true murderer's deathbed confession and he has to recuse himself. His colleague ends up losing the appeal, and Fong is sentenced to hang once her son, Ding Yau Hong is born. Before Fong dies, she makes Kin promise to always protect Hong.\n\nUpon his wife's death, Cheung goes mad and tries to jump off a building with his children, and luckily is stopped by his childless ex-boss, Lee Ho Cheun (Wu Fung), who takes in the two children after Cheung is admitted to a mental asylum. His wife, Yip Sau Wan (So Hung Shuen) is ecstatic even though she already has two other adopted children, Chow Zhi Mun and Chan Siu Ling.\n\nCheun dies suddenly from a brain haemorrhage following a stroke, and the family is bankrupted. Gossips tell Wan that it is all because of Hong, who is a jinx. Wan is shocked, but refuses to abandon Hong.\n\nTaking her four children, Wan travels to Macau to seek help from her brother-in-law (Kong Ngai), who insults her and tells her to become a prostitute. She leaves angrily and works very hard menial jobs to support all four kids.\n\n===1980s===\n\nIn 1982{{ref|a}}, Wan is working as a cleaner in a hospital with Nurse Lan, whose daughter is Chiu Kar Mun (Maggie Shiu).\n\nThe four children she had taken in are all grown up. Kin (Felix Wong) works multiple jobs over the years from a young age to help Wan support the family. Hong (Deric Wan) has just finished high school and is seeking a place at the law faculty of the University of Hong Kong. Chan Siu Ling (Carrie Ho) works as a bank teller, and Zhou Zhi Mun (Spencer Leung) is still in Form Six of high school.\n\nAfter the years of hardship, Wan has grown cold, distant and very moody, leading to communication barriers with the children. Luckily, Kin is there as the glue to stick the family together.\n\nWan's brother-in-law has now fallen into hard times, and begs lowly for Wan to take in his daughter, Lee Wah (Kathy Chow). Wan forgives him and takes the nerdy, timid Wah in. Wah quickly gains a place in everyone's hearts.\n\nNot content to live in cheap accommodations forever, Hong wants to apply for a law degree. Wan opposes this plan, believing that Hong should stick to his class and find a job like Kin. But Hong wants to prove his self-worth, and Kin supports him all the way, and he is accepted at the university. Hong may be ambitious, but he sees Wan's hardship and sacrifice, as well as her dislike of him, so he wants to prove to her that he will not be a liability and gain her praise. Kin works in the university cafeteria.\n\nOnce in university, Hong is immediately singled out as an outsider by his rich classmates (Frankie Lam and Evergreen Mak), as well as the snobbish Sam Fung  (Ng Kai Ming), who Hong sucks up to in order to fit in.\n\nHong finds out that Sam's father is the prosecutor turned immensely wealthy businessman Fung Sai Bong, who is chairman of Kai Mei Holdings. Bong is also on the board of Ngai Holdings, along with his eldest son Michael. Casting old grudges and nervousness aside, Hong tries to get close to him to gain job opportunities. Bong takes an instant liking to the diligent Hong. This angers Kin, who hates the whole Fung family. Hong won't let go of this opportunity to work in Bong's company and quarrels with Kin. Hong moves out of the apartment, and into the university hostel.\n\nOnce exposed to the upper class, Hong becomes more and more obsessed with money and status, and manipulates Wah, who has a crush on him, to do all his projects while he is out socializing with the upper class. Hong later quarrels with Kin over Wah while the latter is driving, resulting in an accident in which Hong suffers permanent leg damage. He then sets his sights on pretty, intelligent medical student, Chiu Kar Mun (Maggie Shiu), who already has a doctor boyfriend, Lau Wai Gong, when she saves his life at the accident site.  By using his jealous tendencies, Hong makes Dr. Lau go mad and claims Kar Mun as his own.\n\nHe finally fails his course once Wah realizes that he is a jerk and stops helping him, and he drops out, seeing a brighter future working under Bong. Kin and Hong quarrel over this issue.\n\nKin has always had a crush on Wah, but she only had eyes for Hong. Kin is approached by his best friend who works in a TV station, to appear on a TV show where the lives of three people with the same birthdates are compared. The other two are the mighty and wealthy heiress Ngai Chor Gwan (Carina Lau), and an arrogant fashion designer, Yeung Pak Kai (Gilbert Lam).\n\nMr. Yeung is an orphan. Similar to Kin, his parents died at an early age. He worked hard, juggling his studies and work and was soon recognized as Asia's top fashion designer.\n\nGwan is the elder daughter of tycoon and Ngai Holdings chairman Ngai Kwan (Kwan Hoi San), who is Bong's business rival and elder cousin-in-law. Her mother died when Gwan was only six. Gwan has a younger half-brother, [[general manager]] Francis Ngai Chun Kit (Canti Lau) who is highly intelligent, responsible, mature and has a flair for business. Tired of being constantly over-shadowed, Gwan does not even try to gain her father's approval. She becomes increasingly lazy and distant from her family, which causes her father to criticize her even more. She thinks Kwan doesn't love her at all, but in fact he does. She also keeps a close relationship with Kit, who helps her out a lot.\n\nGwan and Kin gradually become friends despite their large social differences, and she secretly falls for Kin. However, Kin ends up with Wah, when she finally realizes the love he has for her. Kin supports Wah through her advertising course, and Gwan remains a friend to both, hiding her feelings inside.\n\nDepressed after Hong and Wah start going out, Gwan considers dating a rich man (Gallen Lo) and even agrees to his proposal, but chickens out at the last minute. Kwan is angered, and Gwan moves out and realizes that her past idol life was too boring. She starts becoming independent with the help of Kin. She finds a job as a magazine journalist, and is happy her with her boss(Michael Tao) who likes her.\n\nHong works for Sai Bong's eldest son, general manager Michael (Lee Shing-cheong). Bong attempts a [[hostile takeover]] of Ngai Holdings with Michael's underhanded help, but Kit gains evidence of Michael's illegal dealings and attempts to stop the takeover. An explosive confrontation leads to Michael running Kit over in Hong's [[Subaru Leone|car]], with Hong at the steering wheel. Michael refuses to take responsibility for the murder; Hong manipulates Kin into taking the rap for him, using Kin's love for him as well as his promise to his dying mother to always protect Hong. Hong genuinely feels sorry, and tries to make up for it by giving more money to Wan, who throws it in his face and kicks him out. Once Kin finds out it was Kit who was killed in the car accident, he falls out with Gwan, who fails to persuade him to let Hong take responsibility for his own actions.\n\nKin is sentenced to jail for two years, and in jail he forms a close friendship with several men, each of whom has his own story to tell. Kwun, who has also been arrested for corruption charges, eventually meets Kin in jail, and his dislike for Kin gradually lessens and he learns to appreciate him. Even after reconciling with her father, Gwan still refuses to return to the family company, so her stepmother takes over.\n\nLing tries out for TVB acting classes, and gets promoted. Wan is very against this, but relents when she sees Ling's sincerity and interest. She is also persuaded by Kin's best friend, Fook, who loves Ling. She explains her concerns as stemming from the fact that Ling's biological mother was a famous actress and singer, who became someone's mistress and abandoned her child to marry rich in Thailand. Wan is worried that the pressures in the entertainment field will soon push Ling into following her mother's path.\n\nAll is well until Ling's biological mother, Fong Hung (Chan Lai See) returns to Hong Kong. Ling is disappointed to find her a manipulative and materialistic person, but soon understands the pressures that her teenage mother had to endure and forgives her. But it turns out that Hung is a heavy gambler, and owes loan sharks a lot of money. Under Hong's guidance, Ling becomes Michael's mistress to pay off her mother's continuing debts, ending her sweet-budding romance with Fook. Wan is enraged and disowns her.\n\nMeanwhile, the youngest brother, Mun, finds his biological parents, who have become rich over the years, but his newfound siblings look down on him. To prove himself, he becomes Michael's personal assistant, a high-paying but humiliating job. Wan disowns him too.\n\nKin returns to a relieved Wan and happy Wah, who is finishing off her course. He is still working multiple jobs to make ends meet, and runs back into Gwan. They become friends again. Gwan still has a crush on Kin. Kin meets up with his friends from prison and start up a food stall which becomes very successful. Wah becomes jealous of Gwan's closeness with Kin.\n\nOver time, Hong has lost his interest in Kar Mun and seeks to woo Bong's daughter Cindy for the ulterior motive of climbing the corporate ladder. They visit Nurse Lan in Malaysia. Kar Mun uses her uncle, a Malaysian general (Chu Tit Wo), to pressure Hong into marriage. Desperate, Hong plans the perfect murder, and pushes Kar Mun off a moving train, framing it as a suicide over her guilt for a fictional affair. Unknown to him, Kar Mun attempted suicide some days earlier and left a suicide note in her second clothes.\n\nHong happily returns to propose to Cindy, and the two scale the corporate ladder, overtaking Michael's position in the company. This causes Michael to become increasingly abusive towards Ling and Mun.\n\nKin and Wah grow apart as her career grows more successful. Afraid that she might change, Wah proposes to Kin, but on the eve of the wedding, Kin discovers a letter by Wah to her friend saying that she only wants to marry Kin to repay him for his help, and also highlights other concerns for their future. Kin wants Wah to be happy, so he cancels the wedding. Wah goes off to Malaysia to work.\n\nLing gets pregnant and is dumped by Michael. She tries to commit suicide, but Gwan persuades her to live on. Supported by both mothers, she quits acting and opens a shop. Fook, who still loves Ling proposes to her repeatedly, and even wants to take her son as his own, but out of guilt and shame, she refuses. Mun meets a girlfriend (Carol Yeung). Building up his self-confidence and dignity, he quits his job and helps Kin out.\n\nKin and Gwan get drunk and sleep together, causing both of them to feel awkward afterwards. Gwan's boss tells Kin that Gwan has been in love with him for a long time. Moved, Kin chases after Gwan, who rejects him, feeling that he is only pursuing her out of obligation after sleeping with her. But eventually, he convinces her that his feelings are sincere, and they get together.\n\nKin and his friends move onto opening a restaurant, but his chefs bail out on him, so they have to resort to using Chinese steam-bowl to save the business which strangely, attracts a lot of customers. Gwan supports him all the way, and Kwun gradually accepts Kin. Kin and his friends become rich.\n\nCindy proves to be a good wife, as she successfully patches up the relationship between Hong and the rest of his family. Hong is moved by her actions, and his siblings all like her, but they still continue to hate her father and brother.\n\nWan visits the ailing Nurse Lan in Malaysia, and finds Kar Mun's genuine suicide note; the note reveals Hong's infidelity and his plan to marry Cindy. Hong attempts to claim the note back, but when Wan cannot produce it Hong strangles her to death in a fit of rage.\n\nKin gets a call from Nurse Lan and hears that Wan had left Malaysia that day, but realizes that she had yet to return. He rushes off to Malaysia with Wah to find Wan. Based on eyewitness accounts, the discovery of the suicide note and the discovery of Wan's body, Kin concludes that Hong killed Wan. Kin attempts to have Hong extradited for the two murders, but he is not charged due to a technicality; however, Hong will be executed if he sets foot in Malaysia.\n\nMun confronts Hong in his office. In a fit of anger, he stabs Hong with a letter opener and holds him hostage. He is arrested and thrown into prison hospital, having sustained an injury.\n\nCindy is horrified and upon close observation, she sees Hong's true colours. Cindy requests a divorce from Hong, which is supported by her father, even though she finds herself pregnant. Hong desperately tries to get Cindy back, but she remains determined and strong-willed. Hong loses his position in Kai Mei, and his failed attempt to start his own business is compounded by major stock market losses. During this time, Hong continually extorts money from Cindy to feed his vices.\n\nCindy is very depressed and resorts to drinking. Hong uses her alcoholism to threaten to challenge her for custody of their son and blackmails her for millions of dollars. Just when Cindy aims to quit drinking, she dies from a heart attack, a congenital condition. As they are not properly divorced yet, Hong inherits all her money.\n\nWah eventually returns to Macau to pick up her parents, and meanwhile, tries to get Kin back. She sees Gwan as a third wheel and Kin as hers, but Kin asserts that he only loves Gwan. Wah leaves for Malaysia with her parents and Kin for the Middle East, but the plane crashes and she is the sole survivor, paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nWah uses her disability to cling to Kin. Kin feels guilty and tries to satisfy all her demands, giving Wah new hope that they can be together. Wah becomes increasingly possessive of Kin and hostile towards Gwan, who just wants to help. Kin does nothing to reassure her, and Gwan finally calls him on it, throwing their wedding invitations in his face.\n\nHong, still in financial trouble, kidnaps his own son (under Bong's custody) for ransom, but his accomplice is arrested and the ransom money is marked with a dye pack. Desperate to escape Hong Kong but without the money for the fare, he robs Kin, Wah and Ling at knifepoint but is caught after fighting with Kin and sent to prison hospital.\n\nKin finally confronts Wah about his feelings. He confidently says that he only loves Gwan, and will only marry her. Wah gives him her blessing, and attends the wedding. But that night, she gets depressed and slits her wrists, bleeding to death.\n\nKin helps out Kwan in the company. After letting go of his hatred, he even helped out Bong, causing reconciliation between the Ngai, Ting and Fung families. Kwan is very happy.\n\n===1990s===\nYears later, Kwan dies, and leaves his fortune and possessions to Kin and Gwan. The couple have a son, and a happy marriage.\n\nKin spots the destitute Hong on the streets. He discovers that Hong has been secretly visiting his own son, and pities him. He gives him a lowly job at one of his restaurants, and otherwise ignores him, as Gwan still hates him for killing Kit.\n\nHong is enraged that Kin enjoys a happy life. Plotting revenge, he poisons Kin's family while he is out for dinner at the restaurant where he works, framing it on a mentally unstable colleague. His plan is to murder them all, so that the family fortune would pass to the next blood relative, which would be him.\n\nKin and Gwan both survive, but their young son and six others don't make it. Kin finds electronic bugs in his study and phone and after talking to his lawyer, deduces that it was Hong behind the poisoning. He is deeply conflicted.\n\nKin offers Hong an executive position, much to the dislike of his partners, and they slowly plot against him, not knowing that this is all a ploy to trap Hong into thinking that he has Kin's absolute trust. Gwan is enraged because she doesn't know what is going on, but finds solace in volunteering for the local church. Meanwhile, Hong bonds with his son and plans to challenge Bong for custody. He is happy when the kid calls him \"Father.\"\n\nKin sets a ploy to trap Hong into thinking all is well again. But Gwan and his partners, who don't know what's really going on, are enraged. Once Hong believes he has Kin's absolute trust, Kin sets him up to be arrested in Malaysia. Hong is sentenced to death for the murders of Wan and Kar Mun.\n\nHong repents in prison and begs Kin to bring his son to see him one last time before his execution. Michael has been diagnosed with terminal [[oesophageal cancer]], and is suffering greatly. Kin has a conversation with a broken Bong about karma, and Bong lets Kin take Hong's son to see Hong after much persuasion.\n\nHong cries desperately upon seeing his son, who doesn't understand what is going on. Hong begs Kin to save him, but Kin tells him that it is time he stopped protecting him, and let him walk alone. Hong is disappointed but does not seem to have much hatred left. He is led to the gallows - just like his mother.\n\nGwan separates from Kin upon finding out that he did not consult her on such a serious matter. She wants a divorce, but Kin doesn't. She leaves for Ethiopia to do volunteer work. Kin says he will wait for her at the church where they got married, ten years later, on their shared birthday.\n\nFook approaches Kin again to do a ten-year reunion of the old show. Mr. Yeung has been bankrupted since but is a much more sensitive and caring person now, and Kin cries on air, begging Gwan to return.\n\nThe story comes out of the flashback, returning to the first scene where Kin is sitting by the telephone. Gwun calls him and tells him that she is coming home. But that day, both he and Mr. Yeung are involved in a crash. Ethiopia also has a serious earthquake and related landslides, killing hundreds. They have lost contact with Gwan. Mr. Yeung dies, but Kin survives. He still clings to the hope that Gwan is alive and will return to him.\n\nTen years later, there is still no news of Gwan. But Kin still has high hopes and is ecstatic when the tenth shared birthday comes. He gets ready to go down to the church. Man and wife are married, and after so many years of waiting, Fook finally gets a nod to his marriage proposal from Ling, with the help of her son who sees him as a father.\n\nKin happily waits in the church, getting more anxious as the clock ticks closer to midnight and his hope slowly dies. He waits past midnight, and eventually falls asleep on a pew.\n\nA lady in red appears at the door. She approaches the sleeping Kin, touching his face lovingly. Her tears drop onto his face, and she leaves. Kin wakes up and finds a note saying Gwan has died. But he refuses to believe it and calls out for her to come back.\n\n===Ending===\nMany people believe it was Kin's sister who came to drop off a note so he will move on with his life.\n\nSome sources say it is Gwan's ghost who came to visit him, assuming she had died from the landslides. The fact that she touched his face lovingly could imply she has forgiven him.\n\nSome sources also state that it was possible Gwan survived, but she was upset after the demise of Fei, and wanted to start life afresh.\n\n25 years after the series finale aired, lead actor Felix Wong who played Kin finally reveals that producer Wai Ka Fai himself stated it was really Kin's sister who came to drop off the note as Gwan had already died in Ethiopia. But they used Carina Lau who played Gwan for the ending scene because she has 'prettier legs' and the scene will not be showing the face of the actress. This also ended up making the ending scene more surreal.\n\n==Filming==\nPrincipal filming occurred in Hong Kong with some scenes set in Macau. Extensive filming also took place in Malaysia; notable locations filmed include [[Kuala Lumpur railway station]], [[Chin Swee Caves Temple]], [[Genting Highlands]], and [[Christ Church (Melaka)|Christ Church Malacca]].\n\n==Notes==\n:1.{{note|a}} A passing reference to the [[murder of Vincent Chin]] is made as having occurred months ago in the US.\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0843238|Looking Back In Anger}}\n\n{{1989 TVB}}\n\n{{List of TVB series}}\n\n[[Category:TVB dramas]]\n[[Category:1989 Hong Kong television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1989 Hong Kong television series endings]]\n[[Category:Cantonese-language television programs]]\n", "name_user": "Cardiffbear88", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looking_Back_in_Anger"}
{"title_page": "Tassos Mantzavinos", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|{{No footnotes|BLP=yes|date=January 2014}}{{orphan|date=January 2014}}}}\n\n'''Tassos Mantzavinos''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: \u03a4\u03ac\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 \u039c\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b6\u03b1\u03b2\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2; born March 2, 1958) is a Greek [[painter]] who graduated from the [[Athens School of Fine Arts]]. His work has been exhibited in many museums and galleries in [[Greece]] and abroad and he has also worked on various book illustrations.\n\n==Life==\nTassos Mantzavinos was born in Athens on 2 March 1958. His first painting instructors were Manos Sofianos and Mimis Kontos. He studied painting at the [[Athens School of Fine Arts]] in 1979 and graduated with distinction in 1984. Among his teachers was [[Yiannis Moralis]]. In 1984 he held his first solo exhibition in Athens at Gallery 7. Tassos Mantzavinos continued with numerous solo exhibitions in Greece and participated in group exhibitions in Greece and abroad. He also participated in the 2nd and 3rd [[Biennale]] of Young Artists from Europe and the Mediterranean in Thessaloniki and Barcelona, as well as the 16th [[Biennale]] of Alexandria in 1987.  Along with his artistic career, Tassos Mantzavinos taught drawing at the Vakalo Art & Design College in Athens and worked on various book illustrations.\n\n==Work==\nSince his early period, the key elements of his painting were the anti-naturalistic, [[expressionistic]] intensity in the drawing style of his forms and an [[existential]] exploration through particular themes, but also through the act of painting itself. After the mid 1990s, the largest part of his work features narrative elements, referring to personal memories, experiences and dreams, clearly autobiographical, or strongly symbolic folk tales and traditions. Tassos Mantzavinos\u2019 themes sometimes acquire a [[surrealistic]] dimension, as they are presented in unexpected combinations. The frequent presence of the artist's figure in the paintings, and his fascination with certain thematic motifs  reveal a deep, empathetic link between the artist and his work.

It was released in [[2002 in video gaming|2002]] for the [[Neo Geo (system)|Neo-Geo MVS]] arcade platform, and is the fourth game in the [[Metal Slug (series)|''Metal Slug'' series]].  Two years later, Playmore published Metal Slug 4. This was also the only ''Metal Slug'' game that was produced during SNK's bankruptcy, until [[Metal Slug 5|its sequel]] released after SNK was \"resurrected\" as [[SNK|SNK Playmore]]. It was developed via reverse engineering the Neo Geo cartridge of ''Metal Slug X''.\n\n''Metal Slug 4'' retains the same game-play as previous titles, with the addition of some new enemies, bosses, weapons, several new vehicles and a new bonus combo system. It was later ported to [[Microsoft]] [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] (not compatible with Xbox 360) and [[Sony]] [[PlayStation 2]] as a stand-alone game in Japan and Europe, and along with ''Metal Slug 5'' as a [[compilation (games)|compilation]] in North America and South Korea. [[Nintendo Switch]] version was released in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|title=Metal Slug 4 returns today, so grab your Hevveee Machine-gun|url=https://www.destructoid.com/metal-slug-4-returns-today-so-grab-your-hevveee-machine-gun-516425.phtml|accessdate=14 Aug 2018|publisher=Destructoid.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Hamster's Neo Geo Hot Streak On The Switch eShop Continues With Six New Confirmed Games|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/07/hamsters_neo_geo_hot_streak_on_the_switch_eshop_continues_with_six_new_confirmed_games|accessdate=14 Aug 2018|publisher=NintendoLife.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180814232840/http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/07/hamsters_neo_geo_hot_streak_on_the_switch_eshop_continues_with_six_new_confirmed_games|archive-date=14 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:NEOGEO Metal Slug 4.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot.]]\nA bonus scoring system was added that allows the player to be rewarded depending on how many enemies are killed in the time allotted. The time allotted is determined from the type of emblem that is picked up. A time meter will appear on the top of the screen, and if the player lives through the end of the level, they will be awarded bonus points for badges that represent feats accomplished. Eri and Tarma were replaced with Nadia and Trevor.\n\n==Plot==\nOne year after the events of [[Metal Slug 3]] (timeline wise, also after [[Metal Slug 6]], which takes place after 3) the world is trembling under the new threat of a mysterious but deadly cyber virus that threatens to attack and destroy any nation's military computer system. With Tarma and Eri unable to help due to their own assignments in the matter, Marco Rossi and Fiolina Germi are called in to investigate the situation and are joined by two newcomers, Nadia Cassel and Trevor Spacey. In their investigation, the group discovers that a rich terrorist organization known as the Amadeus Syndicate is behind the nefarious plot and has allied with General Morden's Rebel Army. They head into battle against Amadeus' forces, hoping to destroy the cyber virus before it gets the chance to wipe out the entire world's military computer system.\n\nHalfway through the game's story mode, the player is confronted by who they presume to be General Morden, however in the final stage they find an underground facility where android doubles of Morden are being manufactured. Allen O' Neil (who has appeared numerous times throughout the series) fights the player in this stage for the very last time, and is also revealed to be a machine replica. Finally, the player confronts the leader of the syndicate, Dr. Amadeus himself, who attacks with a series of powerful robots, but he is defeated and is trapped in his own devices as the base self-destructs, presumably killing him. If the player safely escapes the base's bonus explosion stage, the credits will show the main cast eating a feast of food, but if the player gets caught in the explosion, the player character(s) will appear in the hospital, bandaged and bed-ridden, being brought get-well gifts of food from Eri Kasamoto and Tarma Roving. After the credits, a single computer monitor is seen transmitting data to an unknown location before shutting down.\n\n==New features==\n*Double Heavy Machine Guns [2H]: The stronger version of the Heavy Machine Gun [H] in the previous series. Allow players to carry two submachine guns which causes 1 damage per shot and fires more rapidly than the Heavy Machine Gun. However, the 2Hs are very rare in the game and have only 200 shots like the Heavy Machine Gun and can only fire in four directions.\n*Monkey Transformation: In the underground path of stage 1 and the final stage, there are scientists with rifles. These aren't loaded with bullets but a special chemical shot, that transforms characters into gibbons which are like the monkey Utan in Metal Slug 3. Although this transformation is new, the sprites used for it are not, they are recycled from Metal Slug 3. Players gain a much stronger jumping ability and the ability to hang on the bars over their heads, which saves them from most of the attacks from the enemy, although they are unable to shoot upward while on the bars (they can still shoot in horizontal directions and directly downwards). But they can only fire a small gun which is similar to the Heavy Machine Gun, walk very slowly, and takes longer to throw grenades. Players can be transformed back into human form by picking up an antidote dropped by scientists. This transformation is the only one in the series with an animation for returning to human form, in which the player falls asleep as a monkey then promptly wakes up as a human. Players who are hit by the chemical shot while in the monkey form will die.\n\n===New Slugs===\n*Bradley: First appeared in Metal Slug 2 as an enemy rocket shooting vehicle, it is equipped with powerful rocket shots and a vulcan cannon like the slugs, players can use it after killing the enemy soldier inside it. However, this vehicle has a very short jumping range and crouches much slower than the other vehicles, and will not become temporarily invincible after receiving an attack from the enemy.\n*Metal Claw: First appeared in Metal Slug as the \"Melty Honey\" under the control of the Rebel soldiers. It will appear with Bradley in stage 2 on a two-player game. It is equipped with a blade-covered shield that shreds enemies, and also enables it to take five shots before it is destroyed. Also in stage 5.\n*Crawler: A mechanical version of the sub-human mutants from Metal Slug 2/X which appears in stage 4. Much like the Camel Slug in the previous two games, it provides no protection to the player, but has a slightly better jumping ability and also does not harm the player if it touches a rolling bomb.\n*Forklift Truck: Appears in stage 5 along with the Metal Claw. Like the Drill Slug from Metal Slug 3, it can \"jack up\" if the player presses the jump button while on board the Forklift Truck. It will stab the enemy with the fork at the front if the player presses the bomb button. Its fork can shred enemies too. The Forklift Truck does not have a vulcan cannon; rather, the player uses whatever weapon they have. The player is always exposed to enemy attacks.\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{Empty section|date=December 2014}}\n''Metal Slug 4'' was mixed to positive received by players with users scores of 7.8 for PS2, 7.3 for Xbox, 8.1 for Neo Geo and 8.3 for the arcade versions.

4''||lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[Run and gun (video game)|run and gun]] [[video game]] for the [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo-Geo]] console/arcade platform created by [[Mega Enterprise]] along with [[Noise Factory]]. It was released in [[2002 in video gaming|2002]] for the [[Neo Geo (system)|Neo-Geo MVS]] arcade platform, and is the fourth game in the [[Metal Slug (series)|''Metal Slug'' series]].  Two years later, Playmore published Metal Slug 4. This was also the only ''Metal Slug'' game that was produced during SNK's bankruptcy, until [[Metal Slug 5|its sequel]] released after SNK was \"resurrected\" as [[SNK|SNK Playmore]]. It was developed via reverse engineering the Neo Geo cartridge of ''Metal Slug X''.\n\n''Metal Slug 4'' retains the same game-play as previous titles, with the addition of some new enemies, bosses, weapons, several new vehicles and a new bonus combo system. It was later ported to [[Microsoft]] [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] (not compatible with Xbox 360) and [[Sony]] [[PlayStation 2]] as a stand-alone game in Japan and Europe, and along with ''Metal Slug 5'' as a [[compilation (games)|compilation]] in North America and South Korea. [[Nintendo Switch]] version was released in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|title=Metal Slug 4 returns today, so grab your Hevveee Machine-gun|url=https://www.destructoid.com/metal-slug-4-returns-today-so-grab-your-hevveee-machine-gun-516425.phtml|accessdate=14 Aug 2018|publisher=Destructoid.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Hamster's Neo Geo Hot Streak On The Switch eShop Continues With Six New Confirmed Games|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/07/hamsters_neo_geo_hot_streak_on_the_switch_eshop_continues_with_six_new_confirmed_games|accessdate=14 Aug 2018|publisher=NintendoLife.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180814232840/http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/07/hamsters_neo_geo_hot_streak_on_the_switch_eshop_continues_with_six_new_confirmed_games|archive-date=14 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:NEOGEO Metal Slug 4.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot.]]\nA bonus scoring system was added that allows the player to be rewarded depending on how many enemies are killed in the time allotted. The time allotted is determined from the type of emblem that is picked up. A time meter will appear on the top of the screen, and if the player lives through the end of the level, they will be awarded bonus points for badges that represent feats accomplished. Eri and Tarma were replaced with Nadia and Trevor.\n\n==Plot==\nOne year after the events of [[Metal Slug 3]] (timeline wise, also after [[Metal Slug 6]], which takes place after 3) the world is trembling under the new threat of a mysterious but deadly cyber virus that threatens to attack and destroy any nation's military computer system. With Tarma and Eri unable to help due to their own assignments in the matter, Marco Rossi and Fiolina Germi are called in to investigate the situation and are joined by two newcomers, Nadia Cassel and Trevor Spacey. In their investigation, the group discovers that a rich terrorist organization known as the Amadeus Syndicate is behind the nefarious plot and has allied with General Morden's Rebel Army. They head into battle against Amadeus' forces, hoping to destroy the cyber virus before it gets the chance to wipe out the entire world's military computer system.\n\nHalfway through the game's story mode, the player is confronted by who they presume to be General Morden, however in the final stage they find an underground facility where android doubles of Morden are being manufactured. Allen O' Neil (who has appeared numerous times throughout the series) fights the player in this stage for the very last time, and is also revealed to be a machine replica. Finally, the player confronts the leader of the syndicate, Dr. Amadeus himself, who attacks with a series of powerful robots, but he is defeated and is trapped in his own devices as the base self-destructs, presumably killing him. If the player safely escapes the base's bonus explosion stage, the credits will show the main cast eating a feast of food, but if the player gets caught in the explosion, the player character(s) will appear in the hospital, bandaged and bed-ridden, being brought get-well gifts of food from Eri Kasamoto and Tarma Roving. After the credits, a single computer monitor is seen transmitting data to an unknown location before shutting down.\n\n==New features==\n*Double Heavy Machine Guns [2H]: The stronger version of the Heavy Machine Gun [H] in the previous series. Allow players to carry two submachine guns which causes 1 damage per shot and fires more rapidly than the Heavy Machine Gun. However, the 2Hs are very rare in the game and have only 200 shots like the Heavy Machine Gun and can only fire in four directions.\n*Monkey Transformation: In the underground path of stage 1 and the final stage, there are scientists with rifles. These aren't loaded with bullets but a special chemical shot, that transforms characters into gibbons which are like the monkey Utan in Metal Slug 3. Although this transformation is new, the sprites used for it are not, they are recycled from Metal Slug 3. Players gain a much stronger jumping ability and the ability to hang on the bars over their heads, which saves them from most of the attacks from the enemy, although they are unable to shoot upward while on the bars (they can still shoot in horizontal directions and directly downwards). But they can only fire a small gun which is similar to the Heavy Machine Gun, walk very slowly, and takes longer to throw grenades. Players can be transformed back into human form by picking up an antidote dropped by scientists. This transformation is the only one in the series with an animation for returning to human form, in which the player falls asleep as a monkey then promptly wakes up as a human. Players who are hit by the chemical shot while in the monkey form will die.\n\n===New Slugs===\n*Bradley: First appeared in Metal Slug 2 as an enemy rocket shooting vehicle, it is equipped with powerful rocket shots and a vulcan cannon like the slugs, players can use it after killing the enemy soldier inside it. However, this vehicle has a very short jumping range and crouches much slower than the other vehicles, and will not become temporarily invincible after receiving an attack from the enemy.\n*Metal Claw: First appeared in Metal Slug as the \"Melty Honey\" under the control of the Rebel soldiers. It will appear with Bradley in stage 2 on a two-player game. It is equipped with a blade-covered shield that shreds enemies, and also enables it to take five shots before it is destroyed. Also in stage 5.\n*Crawler: A mechanical version of the sub-human mutants from Metal Slug 2/X which appears in stage 4. Much like the Camel Slug in the previous two games, it provides no protection to the player, but has a slightly better jumping ability and also does not harm the player if it touches a rolling bomb.\n*Forklift Truck: Appears in stage 5 along with the Metal Claw. Like the Drill Slug from Metal Slug 3, it can \"jack up\" if the player presses the jump button while on board the Forklift Truck. It will stab the enemy with the fork at the front if the player presses the bomb button. Its fork can shred enemies too. The Forklift Truck does not have a vulcan cannon; rather, the player uses whatever weapon they have. The player is always exposed to enemy attacks.\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{Empty section|date=December 2014}}\n''Metal Slug 4'' was mixed to positive received by players with users scores of 7.8 for PS2, 7.3 for Xbox, 8.1 for Neo Geo and 8.3 for the arcade versions.

Most food waste is combined with general waste at the source. Separate collections, also known as [[Source Separated Organics|source-separated organics]], have the advantage that food wastes can be disposed of in ways not applicable to other wastes. In the United States, companies find higher and better uses for large commercial generators of food and beverage waste.\n\nFrom the end of the 19th century through the middle of the 20th century, many municipalities collected food waste (called \"garbage\" as opposed to \"trash\") separately. This was typically disinfected by steaming and fed to pigs, either on private farms or in municipal piggeries.<ref>\"Most of the smaller cities in this country dispose of a part or all their garbage by feeding to swine, but ... only four maintain municipal piggeries.\" Capes and Carpenter, 1918, p. 169</ref>\n\nSeparate curbside collection of food waste is now being revived in some areas. To keep collection costs down and raise the rate of food waste segregation, some local authorities, especially in Europe, have introduced \"alternate weekly collections\" of biodegradable waste (including, e.g., garden waste), which enable a wider range of recyclable materials to be collected at reasonable cost, and improve their collection rates. However, they result in a two-week wait before the waste will be collected. The criticism is that particularly during hot weather, food waste rots and stinks, and attracts [[vermin]]. Waste container design is therefore essential to making such operations feasible. Curbside collection of food waste is also done in the U.S., some ways by combining food scraps and yard waste together. Several states in the U.S. have introduced a yard waste ban, not accepting leaves, brush, trimmings, etc. in landfills. Collection of food scraps and yard waste combined is then recycled and composted for reuse.\n\n==Disposal==\nAs alternatives to [[landfill]], food waste can be [[composting|composted]] to produce soil and fertilizer, fed to animals or insects, or used to produce energy or [[biofuel|fuel]]. Some wasted fruit parts, ... can also be [[Biorefinery|biorefined]] to extract useful substances for the industry (i.e. succinic acid from orange peels, lycopene from tomato peels, ...).\n\n===Landfills and greenhouse gases===\nDumping food waste in a landfill causes odour as it decomposes, attracts flies and vermin, and has the potential to add [[biological oxygen demand]] (BOD) to the leachate. The European Union [[Landfill Directive]] and Waste Regulations, like regulations in other countries,{{which|date=July 2014}} enjoin diverting organic wastes away from landfill disposal for these reasons. Starting in 2015, organic waste from New York City restaurants will be banned from landfills.<ref>{{cite news|title=Turning Food Waste Into Fuel Takes Gumption And Trillions Of Bacteria|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=287310897|agency=NPR|author=Joel Rose|date=2014-03-11}}</ref>\n\nIn countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, food scraps constitute around 19% of the waste buried in landfills, where it biodegrades very easily and produces methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.<ref name=\"From Farm to Fridge to Garbage Can\">[http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/01/from-farm-to-fridge-to-garbage-can/?ref=science From Farm to Fridge to Garbage Can]. // The New York Times, 1.11.2010</ref>\n\nMethane, or CH<sub>4</sub>, is the second most prevalent greenhouse gas that is released into the air, also produced by landfills in the U.S. Although methane spends less time in the atmosphere (12 years) than CO<sub>2</sub>, it's more efficient at trapping radiation.

The feeding of '''food scraps''' to [[domesticated animal]]s such as pigs or chickens is, historically, the most common way of dealing with household food waste.

In order to keep the worms alive, the environment has to be kept below 35\u00b0 Celsius, therein making this compost ineligible for use in agriculture according to the EPA standards. The product of vermicomposting is homogenous and generally contains lower levels of contaminants than traditional composting. Some look to integrate vermicomposting and traditional composting in an effort to maximize efficiency while producing a high quality organic product that can be used in agriculture.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nComposting food waste leads to a decrease in the quantity of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. In landfills, organic food waste decomposes anaerobically, producing methane gas that is emitted into the atmosphere. When this biodegradable waste is composted, it decomposes aerobically and does not produce methane, but instead produces organic compost that can then be utilized in agriculture.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite journal |first1=Robin |last1=Meadows |date=August 2009 |title=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment |journal=Compulsory Composting |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=292 |jstor=25595163 }}</ref> Recently, the city of New York has begun to require that restaurants and food-producing companies begin to compost their leftover food.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NY-Require-Restaurants|title=NY Will Require More Restaurants to Put Waste to Good Use|date=15 February 2018|website=NBC New York|accessdate=20 February 2018}}</ref> Another instance of composting progress is a Wisconsin-based company called WasteCap, who is dedicated towards aiding local communities create composting plans.<ref>{{Cite book|title=American Wasteland: How America Throws Away Nearly Half of Its Food (and What We Can Do about It)|last=Bloom|first=Jonathan|publisher=1st Da Capo Press|year=2010|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=140}}</ref>\n\nMunicipal Food Waste (MFW) can be composted to create this product of organic fertilizer, and many municipalities choose to do this citing environmental protection and economic efficiency as reasoning.

The city's economic reasoning for this controversial mandate is supported by their estimate that one business can save up to $30000 annually on garbage disposal costs with the implementation of the required composting.<ref name=\":5\" /> Composting is an economical and environmentally conscious step many homeowners could take to reduce their impact on landfill waste. Instead of food scraps and spoiled food taking up space in trashcans or stinking up the kitchen before the bag is full, it could be put outside and broken down by worms and added to garden beds.\n\n===Anaerobic digestion===\n\n[[Anaerobic digestion]] produces both useful gaseous products and a solid fibrous \"compostable\" material. Anaerobic digestion plants can provide energy from waste by burning the methane created from food and other organic wastes to generate electricity, defraying the plants' costs and reducing [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] states that the use of anaerobic composting allows for large amounts of food waste to avoid the landfills. Instead of producing these greenhouse gasses into the environment from being in a landfill, the gasses can alternatively be harnessed in these facilities for reuse.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/anaerobic-digestion/benefits-anaerobic-digestion-food-waste-wastewater-treatment-facilities|title=The Benefits of Anaerobic Digestion of Food Waste At Wastewater Treatment Facilities {{!}} US EPA|last=03|first=US EPA,REG|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref>\n\nSince this process of composting produces high volumes of biogas, there are potential safety issues such as explosion and poisoning.

Most food waste is combined with general waste at the source. Separate collections, also known as [[Source Separated Organics|source-separated organics]], have the advantage that food wastes can be disposed of in ways not applicable to other wastes. In the United States, companies find higher and better uses for large commercial generators of food and beverage waste.\n\nFrom the end of the 19th century through the middle of the 20th century, many municipalities collected food waste (called \"garbage\" as opposed to \"trash\") separately. This was typically disinfected by steaming and fed to pigs, either on private farms or in municipal piggeries.<ref>\"Most of the smaller cities in this country dispose of a part or all their garbage by feeding to swine, but ... only four maintain municipal piggeries.\" Capes and Carpenter, 1918, p. 169</ref>\n\nSeparate curbside collection of food waste is now being revived in some areas. To keep collection costs down and raise the rate of food waste segregation, some local authorities, especially in Europe, have introduced \"alternate weekly collections\" of biodegradable waste (including, e.g., garden waste), which enable a wider range of recyclable materials to be collected at reasonable cost, and improve their collection rates. However, they result in a two-week wait before the waste will be collected. The criticism is that particularly during hot weather, food waste rots and stinks, and attracts [[vermin]]. Waste container design is therefore essential to making such operations feasible. Curbside collection of food waste is also done in the U.S., some ways by combining food scraps and yard waste together. Several states in the U.S. have introduced a yard waste ban, not accepting leaves, brush, trimmings, etc. in landfills. Collection of food scraps and yard waste combined is then recycled and composted for reuse.\n\n==Disposal==\nAs alternatives to [[landfill]], food waste can be [[composting|composted]] to produce soil and fertilizer, fed to animals or insects, or used to produce energy or [[biofuel|fuel]]. Some wasted fruit parts, ... can also be [[Biorefinery|biorefined]] to extract useful substances for the industry (i.e. succinic acid from orange peels, lycopene from tomato peels, ...).\n\n===Landfills and greenhouse gases===\nDumping food waste in a landfill causes odour as it decomposes, attracts flies and vermin, and has the potential to add [[biological oxygen demand]] (BOD) to the leachate. The European Union [[Landfill Directive]] and Waste Regulations, like regulations in other countries,{{which|date=July 2014}} enjoin diverting organic wastes away from landfill disposal for these reasons. Starting in 2015, organic waste from New York City restaurants will be banned from landfills.<ref>{{cite news|title=Turning Food Waste Into Fuel Takes Gumption And Trillions Of Bacteria|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=287310897|agency=NPR|author=Joel Rose|date=2014-03-11}}</ref>\n\nIn countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, food scraps constitute around 19% of the waste buried in landfills, where it biodegrades very easily and produces methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.<ref name=\"From Farm to Fridge to Garbage Can\">[http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/01/from-farm-to-fridge-to-garbage-can/?ref=science From Farm to Fridge to Garbage Can]. // The New York Times, 1.11.2010</ref>\n\nMethane, or CH<sub>4</sub>, is the second most prevalent greenhouse gas that is released into the air, also produced by landfills in the U.S. Although methane spends less time in the atmosphere (12 years) than CO<sub>2</sub>, it's more efficient at trapping radiation.

The feeding of '''food scraps''' to [[domesticated animal]]s such as pigs or chickens is, historically, the most common way of dealing with household food waste.

In order to keep the worms alive, the environment has to be kept below 35\u00b0 Celsius, therein making this compost ineligible for use in agriculture according to the EPA standards. The product of vermicomposting is homogenous and generally contains lower levels of contaminants than traditional composting. Some look to integrate vermicomposting and traditional composting in an effort to maximize efficiency while producing a high quality organic product that can be used in agriculture.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nComposting food waste leads to a decrease in the quantity of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. In landfills, organic food waste decomposes anaerobically, producing methane gas that is emitted into the atmosphere. When this biodegradable waste is composted, it decomposes aerobically and does not produce methane, but instead produces organic compost that can then be utilized in agriculture.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite journal |first1=Robin |last1=Meadows |date=August 2009 |title=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment |journal=Compulsory Composting |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=292 |jstor=25595163 }}</ref> Recently, the city of New York has begun to require that restaurants and food-producing companies begin to compost their leftover food.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NY-Require-Restaurants|title=NY Will Require More Restaurants to Put Waste to Good Use|date=15 February 2018|website=NBC New York|accessdate=20 February 2018}}</ref> Another instance of composting progress is a Wisconsin-based company called WasteCap, who is dedicated towards aiding local communities create composting plans.<ref>{{Cite book|title=American Wasteland: How America Throws Away Nearly Half of Its Food (and What We Can Do about It)|last=Bloom|first=Jonathan|publisher=1st Da Capo Press|year=2010|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=140}}</ref>\n\nMunicipal Food Waste (MFW) can be composted to create this product of organic fertilizer, and many municipalities choose to do this citing environmental protection and economic efficiency as reasoning.  Transporting and dumping waste in landfills requires both money and room in the landfills that have very limited available space.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.agee.2007.07.004 |title=A review of the use of composted municipal solid waste in agriculture |journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment |volume=123 |issue=1\u20133 |pages=1\u201314 |year=2008 |last1=Hargreaves |first1=J |last2=Adl |first2=M |last3=Warman |first3=P }}</ref> One municipality who chose to regulate MFW is San Francisco, who requires citizens to separate compost from trash on their own, instituting fines for non-compliance at $100 for individual homes and $500 for businesses. The city's economic reasoning for this controversial mandate is supported by their estimate that one business can save up to $30000 annually on garbage disposal costs with the implementation of the required composting.<ref name=\":5\" /> Composting is an economical and environmentally conscious step many homeowners could take to reduce their impact on landfill waste. Instead of food scraps and spoiled food taking up space in trashcans or stinking up the kitchen before the bag is full, it could be put outside and broken down by worms and added to garden beds.\n\n===Anaerobic digestion===\n\n[[Anaerobic digestion]] produces both useful gaseous products and a solid fibrous \"compostable\" material. Anaerobic digestion plants can provide energy from waste by burning the methane created from food and other organic wastes to generate electricity, defraying the plants' costs and reducing [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] states that the use of anaerobic composting allows for large amounts of food waste to avoid the landfills. Instead of producing these greenhouse gasses into the environment from being in a landfill, the gasses can alternatively be harnessed in these facilities for reuse.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/anaerobic-digestion/benefits-anaerobic-digestion-food-waste-wastewater-treatment-facilities|title=The Benefits of Anaerobic Digestion of Food Waste At Wastewater Treatment Facilities {{!}} US EPA|last=03|first=US EPA,REG|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref>\n\nSince this process of composting produces high volumes of biogas, there are potential safety issues such as explosion and poisoning.

This often foul-smelling waste contains both organic and inorganic waste ([[chemical cleaner]]s, etc.) and may also contain hazardous [[hydrogen sulfide]] gases. It is referred to as fats, oils, and grease (FOG) waste or more commonly \"brown grease\" (versus \"yellow grease\", which is fryer oil that is easily collected and processed into biodiesel) and is an overwhelming problem, especially in the US, for the aging sewer systems.

His professional career began when he and his twin sister, as teenagers, provided the voices and operated puppets on a local children's television show, \"Through Magic Doorways\".<ref name=\"quote\">[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3225194/ Allen Morris IMDb profile]</ref> This experience led to a job at a small market station in [[Lufkin, Texas]], KTRE-Channel 9, owned by the Buford brothers of [[Tyler, Texas]].   His varied experiences there included sweeping the studio and running a studio camera; shooting and editing news film; learning production techniques on local television commercials; obtaining a 1st Class FCC Engineering license; and finally, directing the nightly newscast.  Still in his teens, this was the first step on a professional journey across the globe.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nAllen Morris was born in Dallas, Texas in April 1954, the son of the late Robert Leonard Morris (August 29, 1920 \u2013 October 17, 2010) and Ora Lee (n\u00e9e Marlin, born May 9, 1921).  He was born eight minutes before his sister Myra, who often says she gave Allen his first big push in the world, because she \"was tired of being womb mates\".<ref name=\"quote\" />\nOther siblings include an older brother (Dalton) and a younger sister (Brenda).  The children grew up in Glen Oaks, then a new neighborhood of the Oak Cliff section of Dallas.  Their family was one of the first to move in.  The children attended Mark Twain Elementary, located directly across the street from the Morris' house.\n\n<blockquote>It was like having an enormous playground in our front yard. A few blocks away were 'The Woods,' an undeveloped area where we neighborhood boys created bike trails in the hills among the cedar trees.  Crystal Creek wound its way through the neighborhood, providing a place for all sorts of childhood adventures.  We played Tarzan swinging from ropes tied to the oak trees, pretended to be explorers cutting fossils out of the quartz and limestone walls surrounding the creek, or went skinny-dipping in the large pond formed at the base of the 'Twin Falls.'  It was a different time.  The neighborhood was our private world, and our imaginations turned it into whatever we wanted it to be.  Our parents never worried about their children's safety.  It was a time when they didn't need to.<ref name=\"quote\" /></blockquote>\n\nMorris' interest in television started as a child growing up during the Golden Age of Television.  His earliest television memories are of [[Howdy Doody]].  At the young age of six, he paid attention to the [[1960 United States presidential election|Kennedy-Nixon]] debates when the networks pre-empted regular programming.  He had nightmares about missiles from [[Cuban Missile Crisis|Cuba]] obliterating his world.  Later, the coverage of the [[Kennedy assassination]] fascinated the nine-year-old to the point that he credits that tragic event with his becoming a lifelong \"news junkie.\"  Throughout the decade, television continued bringing the events of the world into his home \u2013 [[The Ed Sullivan Show|The Beatles on Ed Sullivan]], [[1964 United States presidential election|Goldwater vs. Johnson]], [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], the [[Watts Riots|Watts]] race riots in the summer of 1965, [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King]], [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Bobby Kennedy]], and [[Apollo 11|one small step]] for man.\n\nIn 1968, prompted by the desire to retire from the rat race and facilitated by an offer for his father to open a store selling stereos and sewing machines and to build a coin-operated car wash, the family moved to Lufkin, a small town in East Texas.\n\n:\"At the time, it was like moving to [[Mayberry]].  The town had a slower pace and friendly people.  It proved to be an auspicious move, providing the opportunity to spend more time with my father.\" <ref name=\"quote\" />\n\nMorris spent his formative adolescent years attending [[Lufkin High School]] and working in his father's store after school.  From his father, he learned the fine art of salesmanship.  On the weekends, he worked at the car wash cleaning the bays, making change and frequently sitting on a rail sunning while reading a book.  He has often said his childhood was like growing up in Disneyland.\n\n:\"I saw my parents argue once.  It lasted about fifteen seconds; the most terrifying fifteen seconds of my life.\" <ref name=\"quote\" />\n\nMorris graduated Lufkin High School in 1972 among the top ten percent of his class.\n\n== College ==\n\nThe original plan was to attend [[Baylor University]] on a music scholarship.  However, planning to major in chemistry and go into pre-med, Morris did not have time in his freshman schedule for music and neglected to sign up for any music courses.  Instead, he enrolled in [[Angelina College|Angelina Junior College]], where he could keep his job at [[KTRE]], studying the sciences and becoming involved with the theatre department.\n\nAs a college student, Morris was able to take advantage of his early broadcasting experience by supervising a practicum course in radio/TV/film, for which he received full course credit.  This course entailed students from nearby [[Stephen F. Austin State University]] doing their coursework at the Channel 9 studios, using the facilities there to develop the film and edit a five program wildlife series under the tutelage of their professor Paul Potter.   It was during the second year of college that Morris produced an hour-long television special featuring music and theatre students from SFASU entitled \"A Journey Through Christmas\".   The program aired two years consecutively on two of the Buford-owned television stations in Tyler and Lufkin.\n\nIn the fall of 1974, Morris entered SFASU and graduated in 1975 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Theatre and Communications.\n\n== Going to the Majors ==\n'''KDOG'''\n\nAfter graduating college, Morris' [[General radiotelephone operator license|First Class FCC]] license helped him get a job at [[KRIV (TV)|KDOG-TV]] in Houston.  With the license, he could sign on the transmitter log and edit using the [http://www.vtoldboys.com/editingmuseum/rca.htm RCA TEP] Editor because both the editor and the transmitter monitor were located in the main control room.  At KDOG, he edited national television commercials for Ford, Ultrabrite Toothpaste, and others.  [[File:Roger Gray, Allen Morris and Eddie Bracken - PAWS FOR THE NIGHT 001.jpg|thumb|Roger Gray, Allen Morris & Eddie Bracken on the set of PAWS FOR THE NIGHT]]\nThe first national spot he edited for J. Walter Thompson's client, Ford Trucks, eventually won the Grand Prix at the Houston Advertising Awards and ultimately went on to win a Clio Award.\nIn his second year with KDOG, Morris became the producer of the all-night show, ''Paws for the Night'' and hired Houston radio personality Roger Gray as the host.  The show was primarily an all night movie showcase that also featured celebrity interviews, trivia games and performances by local bands and comedians.\nMorris used the programs to create performance opportunities for theatre students from the University of Houston.  Among the students appearing in the comedy skits for ''Paws for the Night'' (who went on to achieve success in theatre, broadcasting or film) were [[Brett Cullen]], Tim Arrington and Robin Mosley.\n\nA second program was an early-morning children's show called ''#26 Morning Place'', which was hosted by rotating pairs of eight children.  Primarily a showcase for cartoons, the program used segments between the cartoons for the hosts to perform educational skits, read mail from viewers and show film clips from \"field trips\" featuring all of the hosts together on location.  These trips highlighted places of interest to children throughout the viewing area: a visit to the zoo or a trip to Galveston or to the San Jacinto Monument.\n\n'''Sitcom'''\n\nIn 1977, Morris co-wrote, produced and acted in a pilot for a situation comedy entitled [https://web.archive.org/web/20120807035546/http://www.dramaticpublishing.com/p1529/They'd-Hang-You-in-Nashville/product_info.html ''They'd Hang you in Nashville''], based on the play by college classmate William K. Gleason.  He managed to get an appointment with [[Grant Tinker]] at MTM to show this project.\n[[File:Charlie Cudd and Allen Morris in THEY'D HANG YOU IN NASHVILLE 001.jpg|left|thumb|Charlie Cudd & Allen Morris in THEY'D HANG YOU IN NASHVILLE 1977]]\nAfter watching about five minutes of the program, Tinker asked, \"How did you get an appointment with me?\" and then advised Morris to throw it in the Los Angeles River on his way out of town.  Tinker then proceeded to give advice about the business of developing programs for television.<ref name=\"quote\" />\n\nDespite Tinker not liking the pilot, he told Morris to keep the appointments he had with other producers in town; then, report back to him with their reactions.\n:\"It was one of the most productive weeks I ever had because I was learning first-hand from pros about what the networks were looking for, and I learned the number one rule of producing:  Never use your own money!\"\n'''KRIV'''\n\n[[Metromedia]] bought KDOG and renamed it KRIV.  Morris began working as the Interim Program Director, responsible for acquiring syndicated programming and doing ratings analysis for the station.  To increase the station's profile among the minority community, he initiated two public affairs programs for Metromedia: ''Herencia'', a weekly Spanish language program that explored issues of relevance to Houston's growing Hispanic community; and ''The Black Voice'', a panel discussion format focused on issues concerning Houston's black community and involvement in city government.<ref name=\"quote\" />\n\nDuring the 1979-81 baseball seasons, Metromedia contracted Morris as road producer for the Houston Astros.  He traveled with the team producing the road games and learned the intricacies of directing baseball for television from industry veterans Joe O'Rourke from Boston and Bob Hiestand from Los Angeles.  The play-by-play announcers were [[Gene Elston]] and [[Dewayne Staats]].  Morris' first season with the team was also the first season former Astros pitcher [[Larry Dierker]] was in the booth as color commentator for the games.  Morris and Dierker became friends while traveling on the road together.\n\n== Tyler ==\n'''KLTV'''\n\nWhen his baseball contract with Metromedia expired, Morris was invited by future Mayor of Jackson, Mississippi,  (an old friend and former colleague at KTRE)  to re-join Buford Television at KLTV-Channel 7 in Tyler, Texas, as Operations Manager and Director of Creative Services.  Morris made a mark there by developing a commercial production department for the station, winning the first of more than a hundred Telly Awards and getting recognition from The Clio Awards for a United Way campaign.  He also developed local programming: \"THE 5 O'CLOCK SHOW,\" and a series of live broadcast specials for the Annual Rose Festival Parade, local college and high school sports and a political rally during the 1980 elections.  In 1982, Morris was called in as a last-minute replacement to direct the live camera feed of a production of \"MOVIE STAR,\" a musical review produced by [[Bob Mackie]] and Ray Aghayan.  The production was mounted at the Studios at Las Colinas in Irving, Texas, and was a charity fund-raising event hosted by [[Larry Hagman]].  At this event, Morris was reunited with college acquaintance [[Brad Maule]] who was a member of the cast.\n\n'''Renard Group'''\n\nIn 1984, Morris joined The Renard Group Advertising agency as Executive Vice President and Creative Director.  He was responsible for developing communications, marketing and advertising plans for the agency's clients.\n\nAt the same time, he began Fox Group Productions.  From 1984 until 1992, his production company produced the ''Garner Ted Armstrong Show'', a weekly evangelistic television program shown in 75 markets across the United States and Canada.  The company also developed and produced thirty-nine installments of ''Young Country'', a weekly country music program shot live on locations ranging from Billy Bob's in Fort Worth to The Oil Palace in Tyler.  The format featured interviews with current country singing stars and the week's top music videos.\n\n== Back to the Majors ==\n'''Richard Kidd Productions'''\n\nThe next move blended his broadcasting background with the business community.  He joined Richard Kidd Productions (RKP) in Dallas as Executive Producer and Creative Director.  In this role, Morris developed formats for satellite-delivered programs for corporate clients.  During his tenure with RKP, he continued to produce and direct television commercials for clients and continued to develop documentary projects.  He also began producing live events for corporations; developing the staging and directing \"corporate theatre\" for incentive programs, sales conventions and customer appreciation events.\n\n'''Caribiner'''\n\nWhen RKP sold in 1995 to Caribiner International, at the time the world's largest corporate communications company, Morris stayed on as Executive Creative Director and Executive Producer for their Houston and Dallas offices.\n\n'''Extreme'''\n\nIn 1998, Morris and two colleagues broke away from Caribiner and formed Extreme Corporate Communications in Houston.  The company was a partnership with Bill Young Productions and had soundstage and editing facilities in the Studios at the Lakes Complex.  During this time, Morris produced three Emmy-winning projects.  Two were documentaries ''The Faces of Arthritis''   and ''Hannah Morris: Kids Get Arthritis, Too'' and a public service spot \"Don't Say No Tonight-Aids Awareness\".\n\n'''Belay'''\n\nThe success of Extreme led to the creation of Belay Media Solutions, a WBEA certified company specializing in Corporate Communications activities for clients including those in the energy sector, insurance and finance, and computer manufacturing.  Working with Danny Ward and [[Nancy Ames]] of Ward & Ames Special Events, and with producer Rick Cortright at Texas Video & Post, a rival production company, Morris co-directed, wrote and produced \"One Houston united: The Night the Rains Came\",  a short feature detailing the devastation brought about by Tropical Storm Allison and its effect on people in the community.\nThe feature was used in the opening segment and to promote the \"ONE HOUSTON UNITED\" telethon hosted by [[Clint Black]] and [[Lisa Hartman Black]] (both Houston-area natives) and included performances from [[Pat Green]], [[Lyle Lovett]], [[Rodney Crowell]], [[La Mafia]] and others.  The event, under the auspices of United Way of The Texas Gulf Coast, was simulcast on local affiliates of ABC, CBS, NBC, WB and Telemundo, raising over $3.5 million for the benefit of storm victims. The feature won the 2002 National Public and Community Service Emmy Award.\n\n'''VT2'''\n\nBelay Media went into partnership with Houston's VT2 Media and Design in 2002, becoming one of the largest production and post-production facilities in Houston.  As a partner in the venture, Morris served as the VP of Production and Operations for VT2's Corporate Communications projects, managing all budgets and personnel.\n\nVT2 Studios was involved in the development of television programming, commercial production for ad agencies, development of music direct marketing with major recording labels, creative design for 3D animation and print.  Among other productions, the company produced television commercials and opening sequences for sporting event broadcasts and network and local station identification packages.  A significant project was the facility's use by CBS Sports as their local home base for producing coverage of [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]].\n\nVT2 Studios and Belay Media co-produced a reality pilot for Music World Entertainment entitled ''Project Popstar''.  As Producer and Director, Morris worked closely with Executive Producer [[Mathew Knowles]] (Beyonc\u00e9's father) on this project.\n\n'''Notable Documentaries'''\n\nIn 2009, Morris finished ''The Re-Enactors of San Jacinto,'' a project started in 2001 that follows the people who bring the reenactment of the Battle of San Jacinto to life for the benefit of visitors to the San Jacinto Monument.  The eighteen-minute battle won Texas independence from Mexico in 1836.  This project was originally shown on KUHT, the first PBS station in the United States and is sold at the bookstore located at the San Jacinto Monument.  The documentary was nominated for an Emmy in the category of Sound Editing.<ref name=quote/>\n\n2013 saw the release of \"An American Rhapsody,\" a short-subject documentary that is a visual history of the United States from its founding up to the election of Barack Obama as the 44th President.  The soundtrack for the film is Gershwin's iconic RHAPSODY IN BLUE from a 1976 New York Philharmonic concert in London, conducted by [[Leonard Bernstein]] and featuring Bernstein playing the piano solo of concerto.<ref name=quote/>\n\nIn 2015, he completed the first installment of the series ''People who make a difference: Dr. Emil J Freireich, Father of Clinical Cancer Research'', about a doctor who along with Dr. Emil Frei helped discover the cure for childhood leukemia and developed the first successful multiple combination drug therapy for treatment of cancer (Chemotherapy).  This project was initially released on the Internet through YouTube.<ref name=quote/>\n\n''William J. Morgan: One Man, Four Lives'' hit the theatrical circuit in 2017.    The documentary tells the story of William J. Morgan, who survived the Holocaust by adopting different identities, ultimately immigrating to the United States where he became a successful businessman.  Morgan was the founder of the Houston Holocaust Museum.<ref name=quote/>\n\n== Over There ==\n'''Egypt'''\n\nHis career has afforded Morris the opportunity to work all over the world.  He has produced projects in Europe, the Middle East, the South Pacific and South America.  On location in Egypt in 1986, Morris produced and directed a documentary for the Texas Endowment for Humanities entitled, ''Alexandria:  Monument to Civilization.''  As they chronicled the influence of the ancient city of Alexandria on the cultural development of western civilization, Morris and crew received unprecedented access to archaeological sites throughout the country.\n\n'''Gulf War'''\n\nIn 1991, during the Gulf War, Allen Morris and crew traveled to Israel with evangelist [[Garner Ted Armstrong]].  They came back with one of the first American media interviews in which [[Yitzhak Rabin]] said he would consider a \"land for peace\" initiative. They conducted interviews with both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\n'''South America'''\n\nHe wrote and produced two South American projects in the mid 1990s.  One was a documentary about the global effort involved in building the world's largest methane plant at Punta Arenas, located at the southernmost tip of Chile.  The other was a chronicle about the efforts taken to preserve the pristine and fragile ecosystem of the Bolivian rain forest while drilling for oil.\n\n== Selected projects ==\n===Live events and television===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

He first became involved in community service projects through a program called \"Teens aid the retarded\" as a junior high school student.  This led to a lifelong involvement with community service organizations.\n\n===Beneficiary Organizations===\n\nAmong the boards and organizations he has served are:  United Way, YMCA, Crime Stoppers, and Arthritis Foundation; has been an advisor to organizations including The Boy Scouts of America, Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation, The Texas State School System and the Foster Grandparents Program; has been a sponsor and counselor for Explorer's Scouting and Junior Achievement.\n\n[[File:Directing young actors for Children's Assessment Center.jpg|left|thumb|Directing young actors for the Children's Assessment Center]]\nIn addition to this service, he has frequently produced marketing materials, broadcast public service announcements and various fund raising projects in support of Aids Foundation, Arthritis Foundation, United Way, Spay-Neuter Assistance Program, Camp Fire, Boy Scouts of America, Variety Club, YMCA and dozens of other organizations.  In February 2010, he directed the live camera coverage of the [https://archive.is/20121221031000/http://blog.scoutingmagazine.org/2010/02/sam-houston-area-council-celebrates-100th-anniversary-of-the-bsa.html 100th Anniversary] Celebration of the Boy Scouts in America, sponsored by the Sam Houston Area Council of the Boy Scouts.  The event was staged at the Minute Maid Park baseball stadium and was attended by some 30,000 scouts and their families.\n\nDuring his 40+-year career, Morris estimates his pro bono work creating live events, films and videos helped generate over $50 million for various community organizations.\n:\"I can't prove it, but I think somewhere around $50 million is probably an accurate amount of money raised on the many pro bono projects I have helped with over the years.\" <ref name=\"quote\" />\n\n===Boards Served===\n\nAs of November 2013, Morris still serves on the board of the [[Lone Star Emmy Awards|Lone Star Chapter]] of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, and produces and directs their annual awards presentation.\n\nHe is also serving as the Co-Chair for the Visual Communications Curriculum Advisory Board for the [[Lone Star College System]], which has seven campuses and is the fastest-growing junior college system in Texas.  A significant project with the college district was developing a student internship program in which students participate in the development and production of a monthly television program for the City of Houston.  The program covers news and features about the airports and transportation industry in Houston, a program that is web cast on fly2houston.com and shown on the city's [[Public-access television]] [[cable TV]] channel.\n\nA great believer in mentorship, Morris established internship programs at every company where he has worked and has been involved in developing the skills and talents of the young people at those organizations.  He is a frequent guest presenter at high school career days and a guest lecturer and project advisor for college classes in the fields of theatre, communications and radio/TV/film.\n\n== Honors and awards ==\nMorris' work has been honored with Emmy Awards five times;  one national Emmy Award and 4 regional Emmy's.\n\n[[File:AllenMorrisNationalEmmyCCBYSA4.jpg|left|thumb|Allen Morris accepting Emmy Award 2003 \n(Photo by Marc Bryan-Brown, used with permission CC-BY-SA-4.0)]]\n\nNext to those awards on his mantle are Addy Awards, awards from The American Marketing Association, The Associated Press, The Broadcast Marketing Association, The Clio Awards, The Country Music Association of America, The Dallas Press Club Katie Awards, The International Association of Business Communicators, The National Association of Television Programming Executives, The New York Festivals, The Telly Awards, The Texas Public Relations Society and others.\n\nIn 2009, he was named Humanitarian of the Year for his devoted work with Houston's Children's Assessment Center.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lone Star Emmy Awards]]\n*[[Lone Star College System]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3225194/bio Allen Morris IMDb Biography]\n\n\"Caribiner International, Inc.,\" New York Times, December 21, 1996, p.&nbsp;39.\nDenitto, Emily, \"Meeting the Street: Little-Known Planning Firm's IPO Stars,\" Crain's New York Business, April 14, 1997, pp.&nbsp;3\u20134.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Morris, Allen R.}}\n[[Category:1954 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American television directors]]\n[[Category:Television producers from Texas]]\n[[Category:Emmy Award winners]]\n[[Category:People from Dallas]]\n[[Category:Stephen F.

His professional career began when he and his twin sister, as teenagers, provided the voices and operated puppets on a local children's television show, \"Through Magic Doorways\".<ref name=\"quote\">[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3225194/ Allen Morris IMDb profile]</ref> This experience led to a job at a small market station in [[Lufkin, Texas]], KTRE-Channel 9, owned by the Buford brothers of [[Tyler, Texas]].   His varied experiences there included sweeping the studio and running a studio camera; shooting and editing news film; learning production techniques on local television commercials; obtaining a 1st Class FCC Engineering license; and finally, directing the nightly newscast.  Still in his teens, this was the first step on a professional journey across the globe.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nAllen Morris was born in Dallas, Texas in April 1954, the son of the late Robert Leonard Morris (August 29, 1920 \u2013 October 17, 2010) and Ora Lee (n\u00e9e Marlin, born May 9, 1921).  He was born eight minutes before his sister Myra, who often says she gave Allen his first big push in the world, because she \"was tired of being womb mates\".<ref name=\"quote\" />\nOther siblings include an older brother (Dalton) and a younger sister (Brenda).  The children grew up in Glen Oaks, then a new neighborhood of the Oak Cliff section of Dallas.  Their family was one of the first to move in.  The children attended Mark Twain Elementary, located directly across the street from the Morris' house.\n\n<blockquote>It was like having an enormous playground in our front yard. A few blocks away were 'The Woods,' an undeveloped area where we neighborhood boys created bike trails in the hills among the cedar trees.  Crystal Creek wound its way through the neighborhood, providing a place for all sorts of childhood adventures.  We played Tarzan swinging from ropes tied to the oak trees, pretended to be explorers cutting fossils out of the quartz and limestone walls surrounding the creek, or went skinny-dipping in the large pond formed at the base of the 'Twin Falls.'  It was a different time.  The neighborhood was our private world, and our imaginations turned it into whatever we wanted it to be.  Our parents never worried about their children's safety.  It was a time when they didn't need to.<ref name=\"quote\" /></blockquote>\n\nMorris' interest in television started as a child growing up during the Golden Age of Television.  His earliest television memories are of [[Howdy Doody]].  At the young age of six, he paid attention to the [[1960 United States presidential election|Kennedy-Nixon]] debates when the networks pre-empted regular programming.  He had nightmares about missiles from [[Cuban Missile Crisis|Cuba]] obliterating his world.  Later, the coverage of the [[Kennedy assassination]] fascinated the nine-year-old to the point that he credits that tragic event with his becoming a lifelong \"news junkie.\"  Throughout the decade, television continued bringing the events of the world into his home \u2013 [[The Ed Sullivan Show|The Beatles on Ed Sullivan]], [[1964 United States presidential election|Goldwater vs. Johnson]], [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], the [[Watts Riots|Watts]] race riots in the summer of 1965, [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King]], [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Bobby Kennedy]], and [[Apollo 11|one small step]] for man.\n\nIn 1968, prompted by the desire to retire from the rat race and facilitated by an offer for his father to open a store selling stereos and sewing machines and to build a coin-operated car wash, the family moved to Lufkin, a small town in East Texas.\n\n:\"At the time, it was like moving to [[Mayberry]].  The town had a slower pace and friendly people.  It proved to be an auspicious move, providing the opportunity to spend more time with my father.\" <ref name=\"quote\" />\n\nMorris spent his formative adolescent years attending [[Lufkin High School]] and working in his father's store after school.  From his father, he learned the fine art of salesmanship.  On the weekends, he worked at the car wash cleaning the bays, making change and frequently sitting on a rail sunning while reading a book.  He has often said his childhood was like growing up in Disneyland.\n\n:\"I saw my parents argue once.  It lasted about fifteen seconds; the most terrifying fifteen seconds of my life.\" <ref name=\"quote\" />\n\nMorris graduated Lufkin High School in 1972 among the top ten percent of his class.\n\n== College ==\n\nThe original plan was to attend [[Baylor University]] on a music scholarship.  However, planning to major in chemistry and go into pre-med, Morris did not have time in his freshman schedule for music and neglected to sign up for any music courses.  Instead, he enrolled in [[Angelina College|Angelina Junior College]], where he could keep his job at [[KTRE]], studying the sciences and becoming involved with the theatre department.\n\nAs a college student, Morris was able to take advantage of his early broadcasting experience by supervising a practicum course in radio/TV/film, for which he received full course credit.  This course entailed students from nearby [[Stephen F. Austin State University]] doing their coursework at the Channel 9 studios, using the facilities there to develop the film and edit a five program wildlife series under the tutelage of their professor Paul Potter.   It was during the second year of college that Morris produced an hour-long television special featuring music and theatre students from SFASU entitled \"A Journey Through Christmas\".   The program aired two years consecutively on two of the Buford-owned television stations in Tyler and Lufkin.\n\nIn the fall of 1974, Morris entered SFASU and graduated in 1975 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Theatre and Communications.\n\n== Going to the Majors ==\n'''KDOG'''\n\nAfter graduating college, Morris' [[General radiotelephone operator license|First Class FCC]] license helped him get a job at [[KRIV (TV)|KDOG-TV]] in Houston.  With the license, he could sign on the transmitter log and edit using the [http://www.vtoldboys.com/editingmuseum/rca.htm RCA TEP] Editor because both the editor and the transmitter monitor were located in the main control room.  At KDOG, he edited national television commercials for Ford, Ultrabrite Toothpaste, and others.  [[File:Roger Gray, Allen Morris and Eddie Bracken - PAWS FOR THE NIGHT 001.jpg|thumb|Roger Gray, Allen Morris & Eddie Bracken on the set of PAWS FOR THE NIGHT]]\nThe first national spot he edited for J. Walter Thompson's client, Ford Trucks, eventually won the Grand Prix at the Houston Advertising Awards and ultimately went on to win a Clio Award.\nIn his second year with KDOG, Morris became the producer of the all-night show, ''Paws for the Night'' and hired Houston radio personality Roger Gray as the host.  The show was primarily an all night movie showcase that also featured celebrity interviews, trivia games and performances by local bands and comedians.\nMorris used the programs to create performance opportunities for theatre students from the University of Houston.  Among the students appearing in the comedy skits for ''Paws for the Night'' (who went on to achieve success in theatre, broadcasting or film) were [[Brett Cullen]], Tim Arrington and Robin Mosley.\n\nA second program was an early-morning children's show called ''#26 Morning Place'', which was hosted by rotating pairs of eight children.  Primarily a showcase for cartoons, the program used segments between the cartoons for the hosts to perform educational skits, read mail from viewers and show film clips from \"field trips\" featuring all of the hosts together on location.  These trips highlighted places of interest to children throughout the viewing area: a visit to the zoo or a trip to Galveston or to the San Jacinto Monument.\n\n'''Sitcom'''\n\nIn 1977, Morris co-wrote, produced and acted in a pilot for a situation comedy entitled [https://web.archive.org/web/20120807035546/http://www.dramaticpublishing.com/p1529/They'd-Hang-You-in-Nashville/product_info.html ''They'd Hang you in Nashville''], based on the play by college classmate William K. Gleason.  He managed to get an appointment with [[Grant Tinker]] at MTM to show this project.\n[[File:Charlie Cudd and Allen Morris in THEY'D HANG YOU IN NASHVILLE 001.jpg|left|thumb|Charlie Cudd & Allen Morris in THEY'D HANG YOU IN NASHVILLE 1977]]\nAfter watching about five minutes of the program, Tinker asked, \"How did you get an appointment with me?\" and then advised Morris to throw it in the Los Angeles River on his way out of town.  Tinker then proceeded to give advice about the business of developing programs for television.<ref name=\"quote\" />\n\nDespite Tinker not liking the pilot, he told Morris to keep the appointments he had with other producers in town; then, report back to him with their reactions.\n:\"It was one of the most productive weeks I ever had because I was learning first-hand from pros about what the networks were looking for, and I learned the number one rule of producing:  Never use your own money!\"\n'''KRIV'''\n\n[[Metromedia]] bought KDOG and renamed it KRIV.  Morris began working as the Interim Program Director, responsible for acquiring syndicated programming and doing ratings analysis for the station.  To increase the station's profile among the minority community, he initiated two public affairs programs for Metromedia: ''Herencia'', a weekly Spanish language program that explored issues of relevance to Houston's growing Hispanic community; and ''The Black Voice'', a panel discussion format focused on issues concerning Houston's black community and involvement in city government.<ref name=\"quote\" />\n\nDuring the 1979-81 baseball seasons, Metromedia contracted Morris as road producer for the Houston Astros.  He traveled with the team producing the road games and learned the intricacies of directing baseball for television from industry veterans Joe O'Rourke from Boston and Bob Hiestand from Los Angeles.  The play-by-play announcers were [[Gene Elston]] and [[Dewayne Staats]].  Morris' first season with the team was also the first season former Astros pitcher [[Larry Dierker]] was in the booth as color commentator for the games.  Morris and Dierker became friends while traveling on the road together.\n\n== Tyler ==\n'''KLTV'''\n\nWhen his baseball contract with Metromedia expired, Morris was invited by future Mayor of Jackson, Mississippi,  (an old friend and former colleague at KTRE)  to re-join Buford Television at KLTV-Channel 7 in Tyler, Texas, as Operations Manager and Director of Creative Services.  Morris made a mark there by developing a commercial production department for the station, winning the first of more than a hundred Telly Awards and getting recognition from The Clio Awards for a United Way campaign.  He also developed local programming: \"THE 5 O'CLOCK SHOW,\" and a series of live broadcast specials for the Annual Rose Festival Parade, local college and high school sports and a political rally during the 1980 elections.  In 1982, Morris was called in as a last-minute replacement to direct the live camera feed of a production of \"MOVIE STAR,\" a musical review produced by [[Bob Mackie]] and Ray Aghayan.  The production was mounted at the Studios at Las Colinas in Irving, Texas, and was a charity fund-raising event hosted by [[Larry Hagman]].  At this event, Morris was reunited with college acquaintance [[Brad Maule]] who was a member of the cast.\n\n'''Renard Group'''\n\nIn 1984, Morris joined The Renard Group Advertising agency as Executive Vice President and Creative Director.  He was responsible for developing communications, marketing and advertising plans for the agency's clients.\n\nAt the same time, he began Fox Group Productions.  From 1984 until 1992, his production company produced the ''Garner Ted Armstrong Show'', a weekly evangelistic television program shown in 75 markets across the United States and Canada.  The company also developed and produced thirty-nine installments of ''Young Country'', a weekly country music program shot live on locations ranging from Billy Bob's in Fort Worth to The Oil Palace in Tyler.  The format featured interviews with current country singing stars and the week's top music videos.\n\n== Back to the Majors ==\n'''Richard Kidd Productions'''\n\nThe next move blended his broadcasting background with the business community.  He joined Richard Kidd Productions (RKP) in Dallas as Executive Producer and Creative Director.  In this role, Morris developed formats for satellite-delivered programs for corporate clients.  During his tenure with RKP, he continued to produce and direct television commercials for clients and continued to develop documentary projects.  He also began producing live events for corporations; developing the staging and directing \"corporate theatre\" for incentive programs, sales conventions and customer appreciation events.\n\n'''Caribiner'''\n\nWhen RKP sold in 1995 to Caribiner International, at the time the world's largest corporate communications company, Morris stayed on as Executive Creative Director and Executive Producer for their Houston and Dallas offices.\n\n'''Extreme'''\n\nIn 1998, Morris and two colleagues broke away from Caribiner and formed Extreme Corporate Communications in Houston.  The company was a partnership with Bill Young Productions and had soundstage and editing facilities in the Studios at the Lakes Complex.  During this time, Morris produced three Emmy-winning projects.  Two were documentaries ''The Faces of Arthritis''   and ''Hannah Morris: Kids Get Arthritis, Too'' and a public service spot \"Don't Say No Tonight-Aids Awareness\".\n\n'''Belay'''\n\nThe success of Extreme led to the creation of Belay Media Solutions, a WBEA certified company specializing in Corporate Communications activities for clients including those in the energy sector, insurance and finance, and computer manufacturing.  Working with Danny Ward and [[Nancy Ames]] of Ward & Ames Special Events, and with producer Rick Cortright at Texas Video & Post, a rival production company, Morris co-directed, wrote and produced \"One Houston united: The Night the Rains Came\",  a short feature detailing the devastation brought about by Tropical Storm Allison and its effect on people in the community.\nThe feature was used in the opening segment and to promote the \"ONE HOUSTON UNITED\" telethon hosted by [[Clint Black]] and [[Lisa Hartman Black]] (both Houston-area natives) and included performances from [[Pat Green]], [[Lyle Lovett]], [[Rodney Crowell]], [[La Mafia]] and others.  The event, under the auspices of United Way of The Texas Gulf Coast, was simulcast on local affiliates of ABC, CBS, NBC, WB and Telemundo, raising over $3.5 million for the benefit of storm victims. The feature won the 2002 National Public and Community Service Emmy Award.\n\n'''VT2'''\n\nBelay Media went into partnership with Houston's VT2 Media and Design in 2002, becoming one of the largest production and post-production facilities in Houston.  As a partner in the venture, Morris served as the VP of Production and Operations for VT2's Corporate Communications projects, managing all budgets and personnel.\n\nVT2 Studios was involved in the development of television programming, commercial production for ad agencies, development of music direct marketing with major recording labels, creative design for 3D animation and print.  Among other productions, the company produced television commercials and opening sequences for sporting event broadcasts and network and local station identification packages.  A significant project was the facility's use by CBS Sports as their local home base for producing coverage of [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]].\n\nVT2 Studios and Belay Media co-produced a reality pilot for Music World Entertainment entitled ''Project Popstar''.  As Producer and Director, Morris worked closely with Executive Producer [[Mathew Knowles]] (Beyonc\u00e9's father) on this project.\n\n'''Notable Documentaries'''\n\nIn 2009, Morris finished ''The Re-Enactors of San Jacinto,'' a project started in 2001 that follows the people who bring the reenactment of the Battle of San Jacinto to life for the benefit of visitors to the San Jacinto Monument.  The eighteen-minute battle won Texas independence from Mexico in 1836.  This project was originally shown on KUHT, the first PBS station in the United States and is sold at the bookstore located at the San Jacinto Monument.  The documentary was nominated for an Emmy in the category of Sound Editing.<ref name=quote/>\n\n2013 saw the release of \"An American Rhapsody,\" a short-subject documentary that is a visual history of the United States from its founding up to the election of Barack Obama as the 44th President.  The soundtrack for the film is Gershwin's iconic RHAPSODY IN BLUE from a 1976 New York Philharmonic concert in London, conducted by [[Leonard Bernstein]] and featuring Bernstein playing the piano solo of concerto.<ref name=quote/>\n\nIn 2015, he completed the first installment of the series ''People who make a difference: Dr. Emil J Freireich, Father of Clinical Cancer Research'', about a doctor who along with Dr. Emil Frei helped discover the cure for childhood leukemia and developed the first successful multiple combination drug therapy for treatment of cancer (Chemotherapy).  This project was initially released on the Internet through YouTube.<ref name=quote/>\n\n''William J. Morgan: One Man, Four Lives'' hit the theatrical circuit in 2017.    The documentary tells the story of William J. Morgan, who survived the Holocaust by adopting different identities, ultimately immigrating to the United States where he became a successful businessman.  Morgan was the founder of the Houston Holocaust Museum.<ref name=quote/>\n\n== Over There ==\n'''Egypt'''\n\nHis career has afforded Morris the opportunity to work all over the world.  He has produced projects in Europe, the Middle East, the South Pacific and South America.  On location in Egypt in 1986, Morris produced and directed a documentary for the Texas Endowment for Humanities entitled, ''Alexandria:  Monument to Civilization.''  As they chronicled the influence of the ancient city of Alexandria on the cultural development of western civilization, Morris and crew received unprecedented access to archaeological sites throughout the country.\n\n'''Gulf War'''\n\nIn 1991, during the Gulf War, Allen Morris and crew traveled to Israel with evangelist [[Garner Ted Armstrong]].  They came back with one of the first American media interviews in which [[Yitzhak Rabin]] said he would consider a \"land for peace\" initiative. They conducted interviews with both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\n'''South America'''\n\nHe wrote and produced two South American projects in the mid 90's.  One was a documentary about the global effort involved in building the world's largest methane plant at Punta Arenas, located at the southernmost tip of Chile.  The other was a chronicle about the efforts taken to preserve the pristine and fragile ecosystem of the Bolivian rain forest while drilling for oil.\n\n== Selected projects ==\n===Live events and television===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

He first became involved in community service projects through a program called \"Teens aid the retarded\" as a junior high school student.  This led to a lifelong involvement with community service organizations.\n\n===Beneficiary Organizations===\n\nAmong the boards and organizations he has served are:  United Way, YMCA, Crime Stoppers, and Arthritis Foundation; has been an advisor to organizations including The Boy Scouts of America, Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation, The Texas State School System and the Foster Grandparents Program; has been a sponsor and counselor for Explorer's Scouting and Junior Achievement.\n\n[[File:Directing young actors for Children's Assessment Center.jpg|left|thumb|Directing young actors for the Children's Assessment Center]]\nIn addition to this service, he has frequently produced marketing materials, broadcast public service announcements and various fund raising projects in support of Aids Foundation, Arthritis Foundation, United Way, Spay-Neuter Assistance Program, Camp Fire, Boy Scouts of America, Variety Club, YMCA and dozens of other organizations.  In February 2010, he directed the live camera coverage of the [https://archive.is/20121221031000/http://blog.scoutingmagazine.org/2010/02/sam-houston-area-council-celebrates-100th-anniversary-of-the-bsa.html 100th Anniversary] Celebration of the Boy Scouts in America, sponsored by the Sam Houston Area Council of the Boy Scouts.  The event was staged at the Minute Maid Park baseball stadium and was attended by some 30,000 scouts and their families.\n\nDuring his 40+-year career, Morris estimates his pro bono work creating live events, films and videos helped generate over $50 million for various community organizations.\n:\"I can't prove it, but I think somewhere around $50 million is probably an accurate amount of money raised on the many pro bono projects I have helped with over the years.\" <ref name=\"quote\" />\n\n===Boards Served===\n\nAs of November 2013, Morris still serves on the board of the [[Lone Star Emmy Awards|Lone Star Chapter]] of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, and produces and directs their annual awards presentation.\n\nHe is also serving as the Co-Chair for the Visual Communications Curriculum Advisory Board for the [[Lone Star College System]], which has seven campuses and is the fastest-growing junior college system in Texas.  A significant project with the college district was developing a student internship program in which students participate in the development and production of a monthly television program for the City of Houston.  The program covers news and features about the airports and transportation industry in Houston, a program that is web cast on fly2houston.com and shown on the city's [[Public-access television]] [[cable TV]] channel.\n\nA great believer in mentorship, Morris established internship programs at every company where he has worked and has been involved in developing the skills and talents of the young people at those organizations.  He is a frequent guest presenter at high school career days and a guest lecturer and project advisor for college classes in the fields of theatre, communications and radio/TV/film.\n\n== Honors and awards ==\nMorris' work has been honored with Emmy Awards five times;  one national Emmy Award and 4 regional Emmy's.\n\n[[File:AllenMorrisNationalEmmyCCBYSA4.jpg|left|thumb|Allen Morris accepting Emmy Award 2003 \n(Photo by Marc Bryan-Brown, used with permission CC-BY-SA-4.0)]]\n\nNext to those awards on his mantle are Addy Awards, awards from The American Marketing Association, The Associated Press, The Broadcast Marketing Association, The Clio Awards, The Country Music Association of America, The Dallas Press Club Katie Awards, The International Association of Business Communicators, The National Association of Television Programming Executives, The New York Festivals, The Telly Awards, The Texas Public Relations Society and others.\n\nIn 2009, he was named Humanitarian of the Year for his devoted work with Houston's Children's Assessment Center.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lone Star Emmy Awards]]\n*[[Lone Star College System]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3225194/bio Allen Morris IMDb Biography]\n\n\"Caribiner International, Inc.,\" New York Times, December 21, 1996, p.&nbsp;39.\nDenitto, Emily, \"Meeting the Street: Little-Known Planning Firm's IPO Stars,\" Crain's New York Business, April 14, 1997, pp.&nbsp;3\u20134.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Morris, Allen R.}}\n[[Category:1954 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American television directors]]\n[[Category:Television producers from Texas]]\n[[Category:Emmy Award winners]]\n[[Category:People from Dallas]]\n[[Category:Stephen F.

Recordings with [[Charlie Barnet]]'s orchestra in 1936 did not interest the public but brought them greater industry exposure, and in 1937 they joined the [[George Hall (musician)|George Hall]] band, soon moving on to the [[Paul Whiteman]] radio show. They recorded many of the classic songs of that era, a few with [[Jack Teagarden]], as part of the Whiteman orchestra in 1938.\n\nIn October 1940, [[Glenn Miller]] engaged them to record ''It's Make Believe Ballroom Time'', a sequel to the original ''Make Believe Ballroom,'' which they had recorded earlier for [[Martin Block]]'s [[big band]] show of the same name, on [[WBBR|WNEW]] New York. In January 1941, Miller made The Modernaires an important part of one of the most popular big bands of all time. [[Paula Kelly (singer)|Paula Kelly]] was added to the Miller band between March\u2013August 1941; she and Modernaire Hal Dickinson had married in 1939. The group had ten chart hits in 1941 after appearing with Miller's orchestra in the movie ''[[Sun Valley Serenade]]''. The group became a quintet when Kelly became a permanent member of the group after Miller joined the [[U.S. Army]], and for the next few decades they toured internationally with the [[Glenn Miller Orchestra]]. Johnny Drake replaced Chuck Goldstein (who left the Modernaires the day after the Miller band broke up in 1942), and Fran Scott replaced Bill Conway (who by fall 1943 was performing with the newly-formed \"Double Daters\" quartet<ref>Kaplan, Ben. \"For the Love of Mike.\" Richmond (VA) Times-Dispatch, 14 September 1943.</ref>).\n\nSongs made popular by Miller and The Modernaires included \"[[Perfidia]],\" \"[[Chattanooga Choo-Choo]],\" with [[Tex Beneke]] (the first-ever \"gold record\" with over one million copies sold), \"I Know Why,\" \"Elmer's Tune,\" \"[[Serenade In Blue]],\" \"Connecticut,\" and \"Kalamazoo\" with Beneke, among others.\n\nIn 1945, \"[[There!
