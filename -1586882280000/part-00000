She said, the reason why one third of the church would turn away from Joseph was, because that he was in transgression himself; and would fall from his office on account of the same; that David Whitmer or Martin Harris would fill Joseph\u2019s place: and that the one, who did not succeed him, would be councillor to him who did. This girl soon became an object of great attention among those who were disaffected. Dr. Williams, the ex justice of the peace, became her scribe; and wrote her revelations for her. Jared Carter, who lived in the same house with David Whitmer, soon imbibed the same spirit; and I was informed, that he said in one of their meetings, that he had 'power to raise Joe. Smith to the highest heaven, or Sink him down to the lowest hell.' ... his confession was received, and he was forgiven.

She said, the reason why one third of the church would turn away from Joseph was, because that he was in transgression himself; and would fall from his office on account of the same; that David Whitmer or Martin Harris would fill Joseph\u2019s place: and that the one, who did not succeed him, would be councillor to him who did. This girl soon became an object of great attention among those who were disaffected. Dr. Williams, the ex justice of the peace, became her scribe; and wrote her revelations for her. Jared Carter, who lived in the same house with David Whitmer, soon imbibed the same spirit; and I was informed, that he said in one of their meetings, that he had 'power to raise Joe. Smith to the highest heaven, or Sink him down to the lowest hell.' ... his confession was received, and he was forgiven. But the rest of his party continued obstinate They still held their secret meetings at David Whitmer\u2019s; and when the young woman, who was their instructress was through giving what revelations she intended for the evening, she would jump out of her chair and dance over the floor, boasting of her power until she was perfectly exhausted.

The [[Washington Crossing State Park]], dedicated to George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River in 1776, is adjacent to the community. \n\n==History==\nTitusville's central feature is a small village that sits on a bluff overlooking a picturesque stretch of the [[Delaware River]] with stairwells connecting the village to private docks on the river. The Feeder Canal for the [[Delaware and Raritan Canal]] runs parallel to the river just to the east of the village, which is connected to River Road ([[New Jersey Route 29|Route 29]]) by several two-lane bridges. A biking/walking trail follows the canal, constructed when the former [[Belvidere-Delaware Railroad]] line was removed in the early 1980s. Opposite the canal from the river, extending eastward, are a number of small residential streets, a county park centered about Baldpate Mountain, and the homes ringing the base of the mountain and county park.\n\nTitusville is just north of the [[Johnson Ferry House (New Jersey)|Johnson Ferry House]] in adjacent [[Washington Crossing, New Jersey|Washington Crossing]], the scene of [[George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River]] during the [[American Revolution]]. In 1831, the ferry was replaced by the [[Washington Crossing Bridge]], linking it with [[Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania|Washington Crossing]] in [[Pennsylvania]].\n\nTitusville is home to Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc., a division of Johnson and Johnson.\n\nIn 1851, the [[Belvidere-Delaware Railroad]] opened to Titusville and a station was built in the town.

The [[Washington Crossing State Park]], dedicated to George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River in 1776, is adjacent to the community. \n\n==History==\nTitusville's central feature is a small village that sits on a bluff overlooking a picturesque stretch of the [[Delaware River]] with stairwells connecting the village to private docks on the river. The Feeder Canal for the [[Delaware and Raritan Canal]] runs parallel to the river just to the east of the village, which is connected to River Road ([[New Jersey Route 29|Route 29]]) by several two-lane bridges. A biking/walking trail follows the canal, constructed when the former [[Belvidere-Delaware Railroad]] line was removed in the early 1980s. Opposite the canal from the river, extending eastward, are a number of small residential streets, a county park centered about Baldpate Mountain, and the homes ringing the base of the mountain and county park.\n\nTitusville is just north of the [[Johnson Ferry House (New Jersey)|Johnson Ferry House]] in adjacent [[Washington Crossing, New Jersey|Washington Crossing]], the scene of [[George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River]] during the [[American Revolution]]. In 1831, the ferry was replaced by the [[Washington Crossing Bridge]], linking it with [[Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania|Washington Crossing]] in [[Pennsylvania]].\n\nTitusville is home to Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc., a division of Johnson and Johnson.\n\nIn 1851, the [[Belvidere-Delaware Railroad]] opened to Titusville and a station was built in the town. Passenger service ceased at Titusville in April 1952 but passenger trains to other towns continued operating until October 1960. Freight continued to run on this portion of the line until 1976.

In yet others, the infection may still be in the incubation period, when it is asymptomatic and may not yet be detectable even by testing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/03/200309110456.htm|title=COVID-19 infections in U.S. may be much higher, new estimates show|date=|website=sciencedaily.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=18 March 2020}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n<div class=\"toccolours\" style=\"width:800px; margin:1em 0;\"><center>'''COVID19 Epidemic curve selected countries (Logarithmic scale / from the 100th case)'''</center>\n{{Graph:Chart\n|type=line\n|linewidth=3\n|width=600\n|height=600\n|xAxisTitle= Day \n|xAxisAngle=-40\n|yAxisTitle= No. of new cases\n|legend= Legend \n<!-- PLease clipboard copy the \"}x=...\" and \"y1=...\" lines from the log plot of total cases when you update these charts -->\n\n<!-- Search string CASES_X -->\n|x=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55,\n<!-- Search string CASES_Y -->\n|y1Title=Italy\n|y1=100,229,322,445,650,888,1128,1694,2036,2502,3089,3858,4636,5883,7375,9172,10149,12462,15113,17660,21157,24747,27980,31506,35713,41035,47021,53578,59138,63927,69176,74386,80539,86498,92472,97889,101739,105793,110574,115242,119827,124632,128948,132547,135586,139422,143626,147577,152271,156363,159516,\n|y4Title=China\n|y4=100,198,270,300,400,547,639,916,1399,2062,2863,5494,6070,8125,9783,11871,16607,19693,23680,27409,30553,34075,36778,39790,42306,44699,59832,66292,68347,70446,72364,74158,75002,75891,76288,76936,77150,77658,78064,78824,79251,79824,80026,80151,80270,80409,80552,80651,80695,80735,80754,80778,80793,80813,80824,80844,80860,80881,\n|y3Title=Czech Rep.\n|y3=100,116,141,189,198,383,450,560,765,889,1047,1161,1287,1472,1763,2022,2395,2657,2817,3001,3308,3589,3858,4190,4472,4587,4822,5017,5312,5569,5732,5902,5991,6059,\n|y2Title=Netherlands\n|y2=100,128,188,264,321,382,503,614,804,959,1135,1413,1705,2051,2460,2994,3631,4204,4749,5560,6412,7431,8603,9762,10866,11750,12595,13614,14697,15723,16627,17851,18803,19580,20549,21762,23097,24413,25587,26551,\n|y5Title=S.Korea\n|y5=100,204,433,602,833,977,1261,1766,2337,3150,3736,4335,5186,5621,6088,6593,7041,7314,7478,7513,7755,7869,7979,8086,8162,8236,8320,8413,8565,8652,8799,8897,8961,9037,9137,9241,9332,9478,9583,9661,9786,9887,9976,10062,10156,10237,10284,10331,10384,10423,10450,10480,10512,10537,10564,\n|y10Title=Slovakia\n|y10=100,105,123,138,179,186,204,216,226,269,292,314,336,363,400,426,450,471,485,534,581,682,701,715,728,742,769,\n|y7Title=Germany\n|y7=100,151,188,240,349,534,684,847,1112,1565,1966,2745,3675,4585,5813,6012,7156,8198,10999,13957,16662,18610,22672,27436,31554,36508,42228,48582,52547,57298,61913,67336,73522,79696,85778,91714,95391,99225,103228,108202,113525,117658,120479,123016,125098,\n|y8Title=Japan\n|y8=100,132,144,157,164,186,210,230,239,254,268,284,317,349,408,455,488,514,568,620,675,716,780,814,829,873,914,950,1007,1054,1086,1128,1193,1291,1387,1499,1693,1866,1953,2178,2384,2617,2920,3139,3654,3906,4257,4667,5347,6005,6748,7370,\n|y9Title=Sweden\n|y9=100,137,161,203,260,356,500,687,814,941,1032,1121,1196,1292,1439,1639,1770,1934,2046,2286,2824,3069,3447,3700,4028,4435,4947,5466,6131,6443,6830,7206,7693,8419,9141,9685,10151,10446,10865,10948,\n|y6Title=United States\n|y6=100,175,252,353,497,645,936,1205,1598,2163,2825,3501,4373,5664,8074,12022,17439,23710,32341,42751,52690,64916,81966,101012,121105,140223,160686,186082,212814,241626,273808,307876,333593,362955,393602,425746,459989,493567,525436,553493,578178,\n|yGrid= |xGrid=\n|yScaleType=log<!-- This is the line that makes this plot have a log axis -->\n|yAxisMin = 100 <!-- Needed to avoid trying to show the values y2, y3 of 0, impossible on log scale because log(0)=-infinity -->\n}}</div>\n<small>*Datasource: Wikipedia</small>\n\n<small>Czech restriction actions:/ '''Day0''': Schools closed / '''Day2''': State of Emergency: close of sport facilities&amp;close restaurants&amp;bars at 8pm,border control,travel restrictions,ban 30+events /'''Day3''': Criminalize spreading virus on purpose/'''Day4''': Complete closure all shops restaurants&amp;bars ex:food shops,petrol,pharmacies/'''Day5''': Nationwide quarantine ex: shopping, employment need/ '''Day6''': Borders closed&amp;closure municipalities in Olomouc region/ '''Day8''': Mandatory nose&amp;mouth cover / '''Day9''': Special 7\u20139 shop-opening hours for seniors.\n</small>\n\n==Basic reproduction number==\nIn epidemiology, [[Basic reproduction number|the basic reproduction number]] (sometimes called basic reproductive ratio, or incorrectly basic reproductive rate, and denoted R<sub>0</sub>, pronounced R nought or R zero<ref>Milligan, Gregg N.; Barrett, Alan D.

The second-placed team enters a play-off against the runner-up of [[London 1 North]]. Three teams are relegated into a mixture of [[London 2 South East]] and [[London 2 South West]]. \n\n==Structure and format==\nThe fourteen teams play home and away matches from September through to April, making a total of twenty-six matches each. The results of the matches contribute points to the league as follows:\n*    4 points are awarded for a win\n*    2 points are awarded for a draw\n*    0 points are awarded for a loss, however\n*    1 losing (bonus) point is awarded to a team that loses a match by 7 points or fewer\n*    1 additional (bonus) point is awarded to a team scoring 4 tries or more in a match\n\nThere is one automatic promotion place, one play-off place for promotion and (usually) three relegation places. The first-placed team at the end of season wins promotion to [[London & South East Premier]] while the runner-up plays the second-placed team from [[London 1 North]], with the winner also being promoted. The last three placed clubs are usually relegated to either [[London 2 South East]] or [[London 2 South West]] depending on location.<ref>{{cite

The second-placed team enters a play-off against the runner-up of [[London 1 North]]. Three teams are relegated into a mixture of [[London 2 South East]] and [[London 2 South West]]. \n\n==Structure and format==\nThe fourteen teams play home and away matches from September through to April, making a total of twenty-six matches each. The results of the matches contribute points to the league as follows:\n*    4 points are awarded for a win\n*    2 points are awarded for a draw\n*    0 points are awarded for a loss, however\n*    1 losing (bonus) point is awarded to a team that loses a match by 7 points or fewer\n*    1 additional (bonus) point is awarded to a team scoring 4 tries or more in a match\n\nThere is one automatic promotion place, one play-off place for promotion and (usually) three relegation places. The first-placed team at the end of season wins promotion to [[London & South East Premier]] while the runner-up plays the second-placed team from [[London 1 North]], with the winner also being promoted. The last three placed clubs are usually relegated to either [[London 2 South East]] or [[London 2 South West]] depending on location.<ref>{{cite
