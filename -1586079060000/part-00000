''''' is a 2019 American [[superhero film]] based on the [[DC Comics]] [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|character]]. Produced by [[New Line Cinema]] and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], it is the seventh installment in the [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU). Directed by [[David F. Sandberg]] from a screenplay by Henry Gayden, and a story by Gayden and [[Darren Lemke]], the film stars [[Asher Angel]] as Billy Batson, a teenage boy who can transform into an adult superhero, played by [[Zachary Levi]]. [[Mark Strong]], [[Jack Dylan Grazer]], [[Adam Brody]], and [[Djimon Hounsou]] also star. The plot follows Billy Batson, who is chosen by the ancient wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]] as his new champion and receives various superpowers. Billy and his best friend [[Captain Marvel, Jr.|Freddy Freeman]] (Grazer) must discover Billy's new powers in order to stop the evil [[Doctor Sivana|Dr. Thaddeus Sivana]] (Strong) and the [[Seven Deadly Enemies of Man]].\n\nDevelopment of a live-action ''Shazam!'' film began at New Line in the early 2000s but was delayed for many years. The film went into pre-production in 2009 with director [[Peter Segal]] and writer [[John August]] and [[Dwayne Johnson]] considered to star as the villain [[Black Adam]], but the project fell through; Dwayne Johnson acts as an executive producer on ''Shazam!''. [[William Goldman]], [[Alec Sokolow]], [[Joel Cohen (writer)|Joel Cohen]], Bill Birch, and [[Geoff Johns]], among others, were all attached to the project as writers at various points. The film was officially announced in 2014, with Johnson attached to star as either Shazam or Black Adam. He would later be cast in January 2017 to lead a solo ''Black Adam'' development project, currently targeted for a December 2021 release.<ref name=\"BlackAdamRelease\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/black-adam-release-date-set-2021-1254807 |title=Dwayne Johnson's 'Black Adam' Sets 2021 Release Date |website=The Hollywood Reporter |language=en |access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref> Sandberg signed on to direct ''Shazam!'' in February 2017 and Levi was cast that October, with Angel joining the following month. [[Principal photography]] began in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada on January 29, 2018, with most of the film shot at [[Pinewood Toronto Studios]], and [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on May 11, 2018.\n\n''Shazam!'' was released in the United States by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] in [[RealD 3D]], [[Dolby Cinema]], [[IMAX 3D]], [[4DX]] and [[ScreenX]] <!--no IMAX 2D prints--> on April 5, 2019. The film grossed over $366 million worldwide, making it  a box office success. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for Sandberg's direction and the performances of Levi, Grazer, and Angel, as well as its light tone and sense of fun.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/shazam-reviews-what-critics-are-saying-1196688|title='Shazam!': What the Critics Are Saying|author=Katie Kilkenny|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=March 23, 2019|accessdate=March 23, 2019}}</ref> A sequel is set for release on April 1, 2022.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the word count in this section should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1974, young [[Doctor Sivana|Thaddeus Sivana]] is riding in a car with his father and brother when he is suddenly transported to the [[Rock of Eternity]], a magical temple in another dimension. There, the ancient wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]] has spent centuries searching for someone pure of heart on whom to bestow his power and name as champion, after the previous champion released the [[Seven Deadly Enemies of Man|Seven Deadly Sins]] which killed the rest of the Council of Wizards. Thaddeus is tempted by the Eye of Sin, through which he hears the voices of the Sins, trapped in stone statues, promising him power if he will free them. The wizard deems Thaddeus unworthy and magically returns him to the car, where he makes a scene that leads to a car accident, crippling his father. The Sins send Thaddeus a message telling him to find them.\n\nIn present-day [[Philadelphia]], 14-year-old foster child [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Billy Batson]] continually runs away from foster homes to search for his birth mother, from whom he became separated while at a carnival ten years prior. He is placed in a group home run by Victor and Rosa Vasquez, with five other foster children: [[Mary Marvel|Mary Bromfield]], Pedro Pe\u00f1a, Eugene Choi, Darla Dudley, and superhero enthusiast [[Captain Marvel Jr.|Freddy Freeman]]. Meanwhile, the embittered Sivana succeeds in his lifelong quest to find a way back to the Rock of Eternity. He steals the Eye of Sin, becoming the Sins' vessel, bests the wizard, and uses his newfound power to kill his father, brother, and Sivana Industries' board of directors.\n\nAt school, Billy defends Freddy from bullies and is chased into a subway, where he is transported to the Rock of Eternity. The wizard chooses Billy to be his new champion: By saying the name \"Shazam\", Billy is transformed into an adult superhero. The wizard turns to dust, leaving his magical staff behind. At home, Freddy is taken into Billy's confidence and helps him explore his newfound powers, which include super strength, speed, near-invulnerability, and electricity manipulation. By saying \"Shazam\" again, he can transform back into his normal body. Freddy posts [[viral video]]s of the new superhero, and Billy starts skipping school to use his powers to [[street performance|busk]] for money and fame, straining his friendship with Freddy. When Billy accidentally endangers and then saves a bus full of people, Sivana confronts him, demanding that he surrender his powers. Billy discovers that he can fly, and manages to escape. His foster siblings deduce that he is the superhero, and complete his search for his mother, who lives nearby. Billy rushes to see her, but is disheartened to learn that she abandoned him, having felt inadequate to raise him as a single teenage mother.\n\nSivana deduces Billy's identity and takes his foster siblings hostage. Billy agrees to transfer his powers to Sivana in exchange for their safety. They go to the Rock of Eternity to use the wizard's staff to effect the transfer, but the children follow and attack Sivana. Billy observes that Sivana becomes vulnerable when all seven Sins leave his body. Sivana pursues them to a winter carnival and unleashes the Sins upon the crowd. Remembering the wizard's words, Billy uses the staff to share his powers with his siblings, transforming them into [[Marvel Family|adult superheroes like him]]. He then breaks the staff, and his siblings battle the Sins while Billy faces down Sivana. By luring out the final Sin, Envy, Billy makes Sivana vulnerable and yanks the Eye of Sin out of his head, recapturing all the Sins.\n\nBilly and his siblings are hailed as heroes, return the Eye and the Sins to their prison, and realize they can use the Rock of Eternity as their superhero lair. Billy finally accepts his foster parents and siblings as his \"real\" family. In his superhero form, he has lunch with his siblings at school, revealing to Freddy's surprise that he has also invited [[Superman]]. In a [[post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], the imprisoned Sivana is approached by a talking caterpillar,{{efn|Identified offscreen as [[Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil|Mister Mind]].}} who proposes an alliance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|Marvel Family}}\n* [[Asher Angel]] as [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Billy Batson]], a troubled orphan searching for his biological mother, who is chosen by the ancient wizard Shazam as his champion.

Four major sequences take place here, including the opening scene when a young Thad enters and is rejected as the new hero; when he returns as the older Dr. Sivana; when Billy enters and becomes Shazam; and the final showdown between Shazam and Sivana. VFX Supervisor Aaron Weintraub and the team at Mr. X were brought on board three months before shooting began in Toronto \u2013 where the town was abuzz with this exciting project and the mayor talked it up frequently. Weintraub found working with Sandberg and the filmmaking team to be an open, inviting, and collaborative experience.\n\nWhile the first level of the Rock of Eternity was an elaborately built set, everything above 20 feet was a digital environment extension, and within that was every type of visual effect \u2013 from bringing Shazam's chest bolt to life; to stunts with digi-doubles, people melting and statues crumbling; to the Orb and the Seven Deadly Sins flying in and out of it. the final showdown between Shazam and Sivana, in which the latter lets loose his gang of monsters, a 360 shot where seven creatures form from smoke unleashed from within.\n\nRodeo FX team deliver more than 130 shots to DC's latest entry, Shazam!. RodeoFX team recreate the city backdrop for the boardroom sequence. Using photographs of Pittsburgh, They built matte paintings of the city as seen from the boardroom, adding buildings and bustlings streets.\n\nFor the title sequence, They delivered the compositing of the company logos in the opening credits and built and animated the magic 8 ball in CG, adding frost and rays of light beam along matching the effects from the key subway scene from the film.\n\nDigital Domain worked on 26 VFX shots for the movie. Additionally Rise FX and DNEG provide visual effects for the film and the 3D conversion.\n\n==Music==\n{{main|Shazam!

''''' is a 2019 American [[superhero film]] based on the [[DC Comics]] [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|character]]. Produced by [[New Line Cinema]] and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], it is the seventh installment in the [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU). Directed by [[David F. Sandberg]] from a screenplay by Henry Gayden, and a story by Gayden and [[Darren Lemke]], the film stars [[Asher Angel]] as Billy Batson, a teenage boy who can transform into an adult superhero, played by [[Zachary Levi]]. [[Mark Strong]], [[Jack Dylan Grazer]], [[Adam Brody]], and [[Djimon Hounsou]] also star. The plot follows Billy Batson, who is chosen by the ancient wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]] as his new champion and receives various superpowers. Billy and his best friend [[Captain Marvel, Jr.|Freddy Freeman]] (Grazer) must discover Billy's new powers in order to stop the evil [[Doctor Sivana|Dr. Thaddeus Sivana]] (Strong) and the [[Seven Deadly Enemies of Man]].\n\nDevelopment of a live-action ''Shazam!'' film began at New Line in the early 2000s but was delayed for many years. The film went into pre-production in 2009 with director [[Peter Segal]] and writer [[John August]] and [[Dwayne Johnson]] considered to star as the villain [[Black Adam]], but the project fell through; Dwayne Johnson acts as an executive producer on ''Shazam!''. [[William Goldman]], [[Alec Sokolow]], [[Joel Cohen (writer)|Joel Cohen]], Bill Birch, and [[Geoff Johns]], among others, were all attached to the project as writers at various points. The film was officially announced in 2014, with Johnson attached to star as either Shazam or Black Adam. He would later be cast in January 2017 to lead a solo ''Black Adam'' development project, currently targeted for a December 2021 release.<ref name=\"BlackAdamRelease\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/black-adam-release-date-set-2021-1254807 |title=Dwayne Johnson's 'Black Adam' Sets 2021 Release Date |website=The Hollywood Reporter |language=en |access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref> Sandberg signed on to direct ''Shazam!'' in February 2017 and Levi was cast that October, with Angel joining the following month. [[Principal photography]] began in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada on January 29, 2018, with most of the film shot at [[Pinewood Toronto Studios]], and [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on May 11, 2018.\n\n''Shazam!'' was released in the United States by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] in [[RealD 3D]], [[Dolby Cinema]], [[IMAX 3D]], [[4DX]] and [[ScreenX]] <!--no IMAX 2D prints--> on April 5, 2019. The film grossed over $366 million worldwide, making it  a box office success. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for Sandberg's direction and the performances of Levi, Grazer, and Angel, as well as its light tone and sense of fun.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/shazam-reviews-what-critics-are-saying-1196688|title='Shazam!': What the Critics Are Saying|author=Katie Kilkenny|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=March 23, 2019|accessdate=March 23, 2019}}</ref> A sequel is set for release on April 1, 2022.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the word count in this section should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1974, young [[Doctor Sivana|Thaddeus Sivana]] is riding in a car with his father and brother when he is suddenly transported to the [[Rock of Eternity]], a magical temple in another dimension. There, the ancient wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]] has spent centuries searching for someone pure of heart on whom to bestow his power and name as champion, after the previous champion released the [[Seven Deadly Enemies of Man|Seven Deadly Sins]] which killed the rest of the Council of Wizards. Thaddeus is tempted by the Eye of Sin, through which he hears the voices of the Sins, trapped in stone statues, promising him power if he will free them. The wizard deems Thaddeus unworthy and magically returns him to the car, where he makes a scene that leads to a car accident, crippling his father. The Sins send Thaddeus a message telling him to find them.\n\nIn present-day [[Philadelphia]], 14-year-old foster child [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Billy Batson]] continually runs away from foster homes to search for his birth mother, from whom he became separated while at a carnival ten years prior. He is placed in a group home run by Victor and Rosa Vasquez, with five other foster children: [[Mary Marvel|Mary Bromfield]], Pedro Pe\u00f1a, Eugene Choi, Darla Dudley, and superhero enthusiast [[Captain Marvel Jr.|Freddy Freeman]]. Meanwhile, the embittered Sivana succeeds in his lifelong quest to find a way back to the Rock of Eternity. He steals the Eye of Sin, becoming the Sins' vessel, bests the wizard, and uses his newfound power to kill his father, brother, and Sivana Industries' board of directors.\n\nAt school, Billy defends Freddy from bullies and is chased into a subway, where he is transported to the Rock of Eternity. The wizard chooses Billy to be his new champion: By saying the name \"Shazam\", Billy is transformed into an adult superhero. The wizard turns to dust, leaving his magical staff behind. At home, Freddy is taken into Billy's confidence and helps him explore his newfound powers, which include super strength, speed, near-invulnerability, and electricity manipulation. By saying \"Shazam\" again, he can transform back into his normal body. Freddy posts [[viral video]]s of the new superhero, and Billy starts skipping school to use his powers to [[street performance|busk]] for money and fame, straining his friendship with Freddy. When Billy accidentally endangers and then saves a bus full of people, Sivana confronts him, demanding that he surrender his powers. Billy discovers that he can fly, and manages to escape. His foster siblings deduce that he is the superhero, and complete his search for his mother, who lives nearby. Billy rushes to see her, but is disheartened to learn that she abandoned him, having felt inadequate to raise him as a single teenage mother.\n\nSivana deduces Billy's identity and takes his foster siblings hostage. Billy agrees to transfer his powers to Sivana in exchange for their safety. They go to the Rock of Eternity to use the wizard's staff to effect the transfer, but the children follow and attack Sivana. Billy observes that Sivana becomes vulnerable when all seven Sins leave his body. Sivana pursues them to a winter carnival and unleashes the Sins upon the crowd. Remembering the wizard's words, Billy uses the staff to share his powers with his siblings, transforming them into [[Marvel Family|adult superheroes like him]]. He then breaks the staff, and his siblings battle the Sins while Billy faces down Sivana. By luring out the final Sin, Envy, Billy makes Sivana vulnerable and yanks the Eye of Sin out of his head, recapturing all the Sins.\n\nBilly and his siblings are hailed as heroes, return the Eye and the Sins to their prison, and realize they can use the Rock of Eternity as their superhero lair. Billy finally accepts his foster parents and siblings as his \"real\" family. In his superhero form, he has lunch with his siblings at school, revealing to Freddy's surprise that he has also invited [[Superman]]. In a [[post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], the imprisoned Sivana is approached by a talking caterpillar,{{efn|Identified offscreen as [[Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil|Mister Mind]].}} who proposes an alliance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|Marvel Family}}\n* [[Asher Angel]] as [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Billy Batson]], a troubled orphan searching for his biological mother, who is chosen by the ancient wizard Shazam as his champion.

Four major sequences take place here, including the opening scene when a young Thad enters and is rejected as the new hero; when he returns as the older Dr. Sivana; when Billy enters and becomes Shazam; and the final showdown between Shazam and Sivana. VFX Supervisor Aaron Weintraub and the team at Mr. X were brought on board three months before shooting began in Toronto \u2013 where the town was abuzz with this exciting project and the mayor talked it up frequently. Weintraub found working with Sandberg and the filmmaking team to be an open, inviting, and collaborative experience.\n\nWhile the first level of the Rock of Eternity was an elaborately built set, everything above 20 feet was a digital environment extension, and within that was every type of visual effect \u2013 from bringing Shazam's chest bolt to life; to stunts with digi-doubles, people melting and statues crumbling; to the Orb and the Seven Deadly Sins flying in and out of it. the final showdown between Shazam and Sivana, in which the latter lets loose his gang of monsters, a 360 shot where seven creatures form from smoke unleashed from within.\n\nRodeo FX team deliver more than 130 shots to DC's latest entry, Shazam!. RodeoFX team recreate the city backdrop for the boardroom sequence. Using photographs of Pittsburgh, They built matte paintings of the city as seen from the boardroom, adding buildings and bustlings streets.\n\nFor the title sequence, They delivered the compositing of the company logos in the opening credits and built and animated the magic 8 ball in CG, adding frost and rays of light beam along matching the effects from the key subway scene from the film.\n\nDigital Domain worked on 26 VFX shots for the movie. Additionally Rise FX and DNEG provide visual effects for the film and the 3D conversion.\n\n==Music==\n{{main|Shazam!

She is the founder and executive director of [[Reelworld Film Festival]].\n\n==Early life==\nWilliams was born in London, England to [[Jamaican people|Jamaican]] parents. She lived in London and [[Kingston, Jamaica]] as a young child. At age five, she contracted [[rheumatic fever]]; she and her mother then moved to [[Birmingham]]. In 1969 she and her family settled in [[Oshawa]], [[Ontario]], Canada.

Appearances on the television series ''[[Check It Out! (Canadian TV series)|Check it Out!]]'' and ''[[Generations (U.S. TV series)|Generations]]'' followed. Her involvement on ''Generations'' snagged her a role on ''The Young and the Restless'', and has become her most lucrative role. Williams won the [[NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Daytime Drama Series]] in 2000 and 2002.\n\nWilliams appeared on ''[[A Very Brady Christmas]]'' as Cindy's roommate.\n\nIn March 2004, Williams hosted the special event program ''Tonya Lee Williams: Gospel Jubilee'' on [[CBC Television]].

Sometimes credited as '''Tonya Lee Williams''', she is best known for her role as Dr. [[Olivia Barber]] Winters on the American daytime drama ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' from 1990 to 2011. She is the founder and executive director of [[Reelworld Film Festival]].\n\n==Early life==\nWilliams was born in London, England to [[Jamaican people|Jamaican]] parents. She lived in London and [[Kingston, Jamaica]] as a young child. At age five, she contracted [[rheumatic fever]]; she and her mother then moved to [[Birmingham]]. In 1969 she and her family settled in [[Oshawa]], [[Ontario]], Canada. As a teenager she modeled in [[Eaton's]] catalogues and danced on a television series called ''Boogie!'' which ran on [[Citytv]]. In 1977 Williams was crowned Miss Black Ontario.\n\nWilliams was married to Robert Simpson from 1983 to 1991, but she has not remarried.\n\n==Career==\nWilliams' television debut was as a host of the Canadian children's show ''[[Polka Dot Door]]'', from 1980 to 1983, after graduating from [[Ryerson Polytechnical Institute]] in 1979. Appearances on the television series ''[[Check It Out! (Canadian TV series)|Check it Out!]]'' and ''[[Generations (U.S. TV series)|Generations]]'' followed. Her involvement on ''Generations'' snagged her a role on ''The Young and the Restless'', and has become her most lucrative role. Williams won the [[NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Daytime Drama Series]] in 2000 and 2002.\n\nWilliams appeared on ''[[A Very Brady Christmas]]'' as Cindy's roommate.\n\nIn March 2004, Williams hosted the special event program ''Tonya Lee Williams: Gospel Jubilee'' on [[CBC Television]]. She is a member of [[Sigma Gamma Rho]] sorority.\n\nWilliams is the founder, executive and artistic director of the [[Reelworld Film Festival]], an annual film festival in [[Toronto]] that features talent from ethnically diverse communities.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film and television appearances===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

It was classified for a while but was obtained by researchers in the early 1990s. \n\n== Findings ==\nThe basic thesis of the memorandum was that [[population growth]] in the [[least developed countries]] (LDCs) is a concern to US national security, because it would tend to risk [[civil unrest]] and political instability in countries that had a high potential for economic development. The policy gives \"paramount importance\" to population control measures and the promotion of contraception among 13 populous countries to control rapid population growth which the US deems inimical to the socio-political and economic growth of these countries and to the national interests of the United States since the \"U.S. economy will require large and increasing amounts of minerals from abroad\" and the countries can produce destabilizing opposition forces against the US.\n\nIt recommends for US leadership to \"influence national leaders\" and that \"improved world-wide support for population-related efforts should be sought through increased emphasis on mass media and other population education and motivation programs by the UN, USIA, and USAID.\"\n\n=== Named countries ===\nThirteen countries are named in the report as particularly problematic with respect to US security interests: [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], [[Indonesia]], [[Thailand]], the [[Philippines]], [[Turkey]], [[Nigeria]], [[Egypt]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]], and [[Brazil]]. The countries are projected to create 47 percent of all [[world population]] growth.\n\nIt also raises the question of whether the US should consider preferential allocation of surplus food supplies to states deemed constructive in use of population control measures.\n\n=== General oversight ===\nThe paper takes a look at worldwide demographic population trends as projected in 1974.\n\nIt is divided into two major sections: an analytical section and policy recommendations.\n\nThe analytical section discusses projected world demographic trends and their influence on world food supply, minerals, and fuel. It looks at the relation between economic development in the least developed nations and investigates the implications of world population pressures on US national security.\n\nThe policy recommendations is divided into two sections. A US population strategy and action to create conditions for fertility decline. A major concern reiterated in the paper concerns the effect of population on starvation and famine.\n\n\"Growing populations will have a serious impact on the need for food especially in the poorest, fastest growing LDCs.[least developed countries] While under normal weather conditions and assuming food production growth in line with recent trends, total world agricultural production could expand faster than population, there will nevertheless be serious problems in food distribution and financing, making shortages, even at today's poor nutrition levels, probable in many of the larger more populous LDC regions. Even today 10 to 20 million people die each year due, directly or indirectly, to malnutrition. Even more serious is the consequence of major crop failures which are likely to occur from time to time.\n\n\"The most serious consequence for the short and middle term is the possibility of massive famines in certain parts of the world, especially the poorest regions. World needs for food rise by 2.5 percent or more per year (making a modest allowance for improved diets and nutrition) at a time when readily available fertilizer and well-watered land is already largely being utilized. Therefore, additions to food production must come mainly from higher yields.\n\n\"Countries with large population growth cannot afford constantly growing imports, but for them to raise food output steadily by 2 to 4 percent over the next generation or two is a formidable challenge.\"\n\n=== Key insights ===\n*\"The U.S. economy will require large and increasing amounts of minerals from abroad, especially from less developed countries [see National Commission on Materials Policy, Towards a National Materials Policy: Basic Data and Issues, April 1972]. That fact gives the U.S. enhanced interest in the political, economic, and social stability of the supplying countries. Wherever a lessening of population pressures through reduced birth rates can increase the prospects for such stability, population policy becomes relevant to resource supplies and to the economic interests of the United States.... The location of known reserves of higher grade ores of most minerals favors increasing dependence of all industrialized regions on imports from less developed countries. The real problems of mineral supplies lie, not in basic physical sufficiency, but in the politico-economic issues of access, terms for exploration and exploitation, and division of the benefits among producers, consumers, and host country governments\" [Chapter III, \"Minerals and Fuel\"]. I say God will panfish you for the crime you do against humanity. Alzara\n*\"Whether through government action, labor conflicts, sabotage, or civil disturbance, the smooth flow of needed materials will be jeopardized. Although population pressure is obviously not the only factor involved, these types of frustrations are much less likely under conditions of slow or zero population growth\" [Chapter III, \"Minerals and Fuel\"].\n*\"Populations with a high proportion of growth. The young people, who are in much higher proportions in many LDCs, are likely to be more volatile, unstable, prone to extremes, alienation and violence than an older population. These young people can more readily be persuaded to attack the legal institutions of the government or real property of the 'establishment,' 'imperialists,' multinational corporations, or other -- often foreign -- influences blamed for their troubles\" [Chapter V, \"Implications of Population Pressures for National Security\"].\n*\"We must take care that our activities should not give the appearance to the LDCs of an industrialized country policy directed against the LDCs. Caution must be taken that in any approaches in this field we support in the LDCs are ones we can support within this country. \"Third World\" leaders should be in the forefront and obtain the credit for successful programs. In this context it is important to demonstrate to LDC leaders that such family planning programs have worked and can work within a reasonable period of time.\" [Chapter I, \"World Demographic Trends\"]\n*\"In these sensitive relations, however, it is important in style as well as substance to avoid the appearance of coercion.\"\n*Abortion as a geopolitical strategy is mentioned several dozen times in the report with suggestive implications: \"No country has reduced its population growth without resorting to abortion.... under developing country conditions foresight methods not only are frequently unavailable but often fail because of ignorance, lack of preparation, misuse and non-use. Because of these latter conditions, increasing numbers of women in the developing world have been resorting to abortion....\n\n== External links ==\n* {{cite web\n| url=http://www.population-security.org/28-APP2.html\n| title=National Security Study Memorandum 200 (NSSM 200)\n| date=April 1974}}\n\n* {{cite web\n| url=https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PCAAB500.pdf\n| title=National Security Study Memorandum -NSSM 200\n| date=1974-12-10\n| publisher=[[USAID]]}}\n\n* {{cite web\n| url=http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/virtuallibrary/documents/nssm/nssm_200.pdf\n| title=National Security Study Memorandum 200\n| date=1974-04-24\n| publisher=[[Nixon Library]]}}\n\n* {{cite web\n| url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76ve14p1/d118\n| title=Foreign Relations of the United States, 1969\u20131976\n| work=Volume E\u201314, Part 1, Documents on the United Nations, 1973\u20131976, Document 118\n| publisher=[[Department of State]]\n| others=[[Robert S.

A major concern reiterated in the paper concerns the effect of population on starvation and famine.\n\n\"Growing populations will have a serious impact on the need for food especially in the poorest, fastest growing LDCs.[least developed countries] While under normal weather conditions and assuming food production growth in line with recent trends, total world agricultural production could expand faster than population, there will nevertheless be serious problems in food distribution and financing, making shortages, even at today's poor nutrition levels, probable in many of the larger more populous LDC regions. Even today 10 to 20 million people die each year due, directly or indirectly, to malnutrition. Even more serious is the consequence of major crop failures which are likely to occur from time to time.\n\n\"The most serious consequence for the short and middle term is the possibility of massive famines in certain parts of the world, especially the poorest regions. World needs for food rise by 2.5 percent or more per year (making a modest allowance for improved diets and nutrition) at a time when readily available fertilizer and well-watered land is already largely being utilized. Therefore, additions to food production must come mainly from higher yields.\n\n\"Countries with large population growth cannot afford constantly growing imports, but for them to raise food output steadily by 2 to 4 percent over the next generation or two is a formidable challenge.\"\n\n=== Key insights ===\n*\"The U.S. economy will require large and increasing amounts of minerals from abroad, especially from less developed countries [see National Commission on Materials Policy, Towards a National Materials Policy: Basic Data and Issues, April 1972]. That fact gives the U.S. enhanced interest in the political, economic, and social stability of the supplying countries. Wherever a lessening of population pressures through reduced birth rates can increase the prospects for such stability, population policy becomes relevant to resource supplies and to the economic interests of the United States.... The location of known reserves of higher grade ores of most minerals favors increasing dependence of all industrialized regions on imports from less developed countries. The real problems of mineral supplies lie, not in basic physical sufficiency, but in the politico-economic issues of access, terms for exploration and exploitation, and division of the benefits among producers, consumers, and host country governments\" [Chapter III, \"Minerals and Fuel\"].\n*\"Whether through government action, labor conflicts, sabotage, or civil disturbance, the smooth flow of needed materials will be jeopardized. Although population pressure is obviously not the only factor involved, these types of frustrations are much less likely under conditions of slow or zero population growth\" [Chapter III, \"Minerals and Fuel\"].\n*\"Populations with a high proportion of growth. The young people, who are in much higher proportions in many LDCs, are likely to be more volatile, unstable, prone to extremes, alienation and violence than an older population. These young people can more readily be persuaded to attack the legal institutions of the government or real property of the 'establishment,' 'imperialists,' multinational corporations, or other -- often foreign -- influences blamed for their troubles\" [Chapter V, \"Implications of Population Pressures for National Security\"].\n*\"We must take care that our activities should not give the appearance to the LDCs of an industrialized country policy directed against the LDCs. Caution must be taken that in any approaches in this field we support in the LDCs are ones we can support within this country. \"Third World\" leaders should be in the forefront and obtain the credit for successful programs. In this context it is important to demonstrate to LDC leaders that such family planning programs have worked and can work within a reasonable period of time.\" [Chapter I, \"World Demographic Trends\"]\n*\"In these sensitive relations, however, it is important in style as well as substance to avoid the appearance of coercion.\"\n*Abortion as a geopolitical strategy is mentioned several dozen times in the report with suggestive implications: \"No country has reduced its population growth without resorting to abortion.... under developing country conditions foresight methods not only are frequently unavailable but often fail because of ignorance, lack of preparation, misuse and non-use. Because of these latter conditions, increasing numbers of women in the developing world have been resorting to abortion....\n\n== External links ==\n* {{cite web\n| url=http://www.population-security.org/28-APP2.html\n| title=National Security Study Memorandum 200 (NSSM 200)\n| date=April 1974}}\n\n* {{cite web\n| url=https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PCAAB500.pdf\n| title=National Security Study Memorandum -NSSM 200\n| date=1974-12-10\n| publisher=[[USAID]]}}\n\n* {{cite web\n| url=http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/virtuallibrary/documents/nssm/nssm_200.pdf\n| title=National Security Study Memorandum 200\n| date=1974-04-24\n| publisher=[[Nixon Library]]}}\n\n* {{cite web\n| url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76ve14p1/d118\n| title=Foreign Relations of the United States, 1969\u20131976\n| work=Volume E\u201314, Part 1, Documents on the United Nations, 1973\u20131976, Document 118\n| publisher=[[Department of State]]\n| others=[[Robert S.

All T cells begin as [[CD4]]-[[CD8]]-[[T cell receptor|TCR]]- cells at the DN (double-negative) stage, where an individual cell will rearrange its T cell receptor genes to form a unique, functional molecule, which they, in turn, test against cells in the thymic cortex for a minimal level of interaction with self-[[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC]]. If they receive these signals, they proliferate and express both CD4 and CD8, becoming double-positive cells. The selection of Tregs occurs on radio-resistant hematopoietically-derived MHC class II-expressing cells in the medulla or [[Hassall's corpuscles|Hassal\u2019s corpuscles]] in the thymus. At the DP (double-positive) stage, they are selected by their interaction with the cells within the thymus, begin the transcription of Foxp3, and become Treg cells, although they may not begin to express Foxp3 until the single-positive stage, at which point they are functional Tregs. Tregs do not have the limited [[T cell receptor|TCR]] expression of NKT or \u03b3\u03b4 T cells; Tregs have a larger TCR diversity than effector T cells, biased towards self-peptides.\n\nThe process of Treg selection is determined by the affinity of interaction with the self-peptide MHC complex.

Treg cells require [[CD28]] [[co-stimulation]] and [[CD86|B7.2]] expression is largely restricted to the medulla, the development of which seems to parallel the development of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells. It has been suggested that the two are linked, but no definitive link between the processes has yet been shown.

When self/non-self discrimination fails, the immune system destroys cells and tissues of the body and as a result causes [[autoimmune diseases]]. Regulatory T cells actively suppress activation of the immune system and prevent pathological self-reactivity, i.e. autoimmune disease.  The critical role regulatory T cells play within the immune system is evidenced by the severe autoimmune syndrome that results from a genetic deficiency in regulatory T cells ([[IPEX syndrome]] \u2013 see also below).\n\n[[File:Mechanisms of suppression by regulatory T cells.png|thumb|Diagram of regulatory T cell, effector T cells and dendritic cell showing putative mechanisms of suppression by regulatory T cells.]]\n\nThe molecular mechanism by which regulatory T cells exert their suppressor/regulatory activity has not been definitively characterized and is the subject of intense research.

While the immunosuppressive function of regulatory T cells prevents the development of autoimmune disease, it is not desirable during immune responses to infectious microorganisms. Current hypotheses suggest that, upon encounter with infectious microorganisms, the activity of regulatory T cells may be downregulated, either directly or indirectly, by other cells to facilitate elimination of the infection. Experimental evidence from mouse models suggests that some pathogens may have evolved to manipulate regulatory T cells to immunosuppress the host and so potentiate their own survival. For example, regulatory T cell activity has been reported to increase in several infectious contexts, such as [[retroviral]] infections (the most well-known of which is [[HIV]]), mycobacterial infections (like [[tuberculosis]]), and various parasitic infections including ''[[Leishmania]]'' and [[malaria]].\n\nTregs play major roles during HIV infection. They suppress the immune system, thus limiting target cells and reducing inflammation, but this simultaneously disrupts the clearance of virus by the cell-mediated immune response and enhances the reservoir by pushing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to a resting state, including infected cells. Additionally, Tregs can be infected by HIV, increasing the size of the HIV reservoir directly. Thus, Tregs are being investigated as targets for HIV cure research.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kleinman AJ, Sivanandham R, Pandrea I, Chougnet CA, Apetrei C | title = Regulatory T Cells As Potential Targets for HIV Cure Research | journal = Frontiers in Immunology | volume = 9 | pages = 734 | date = 2018 | pmid = 29706961 | pmc = 5908895 | doi = 10.3389/fimmu.2018.00734 }}</ref>\n\nRegulatory T cells have a large role in the pathology of [[visceral leishmaniasis]] and in preventing excess inflammation in patients cured of visceral leishmaniasis.\n\nCD4<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells are often associated with solid tumours in both humans and murine models.

The latest research suggests that regulatory T cells are defined by expression of the forkhead family [[transcription factor]] [[Foxp3]] (forkhead box p3).

Originally, high expression of CD25 and CD4 surface markers was used (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> cells). This is problematic as CD25 is also expressed on non-regulatory T cells in the setting of immune activation such as during an immune response to a pathogen. As defined by CD4 and CD25 expression, regulatory T cells comprise about 5\u201310% of the mature CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subpopulation in mice and humans, while about 1\u20132% of Treg can be measured in whole blood. The additional measurement of cellular expression of Foxp3 protein allowed a more specific analysis of Treg cells (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells). However, Foxp3 is also transiently expressed in activated human effector T cells, thus complicating a correct Treg analysis using CD4, CD25 and Foxp3 as markers in humans. Therefore, some research groups use another marker, the absence or low-level expression of the surface protein CD127 in combination with the presence of CD4 and CD25. Several additional markers have been described, e.g., high levels of CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated molecule-4) and [[GITR]] (glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor) are also expressed on regulatory T cells, however the functional significance of this expression remains to be defined.  There is a great interest in identifying cell surface markers that are uniquely and specifically expressed on all Foxp3-expressing regulatory T cells.  However, to date no such molecule has been identified.\n\nIn addition to the search for novel protein markers, a different method to analyze and monitor Treg cells more accurately has been described in the literature. This method is based on [[DNA methylation]] analysis. Only in Treg cells, but not in any other cell type, including activated effector T cells, a certain region within the Foxp3 gene (TSDR, Treg-specific-demethylated region) is found demethylated, which allows to monitor Treg cells through a PCR reaction or other DNA-based analysis methods.<ref name=\"pmid19147574\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wieczorek G, Asemissen A, Model F, Turbachova I, Floess S, Liebenberg V, Baron U, Stauch D, Kotsch K, Pratschke J, Hamann A, Loddenkemper C, Stein H, Volk HD, Hoffm\u00fcller U, Gr\u00fctzkau A, Mustea A, Huehn J, Scheibenbogen C, Olek S | title = Quantitative DNA methylation analysis of FOXP3 as a new method for counting regulatory T cells in peripheral blood and solid tissue | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 69 | issue = 2 | pages = 599\u2013608 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19147574 | doi = 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-2361 }}</ref>\nInterplay between the Th17 cells and regulatory T cells are important in many diseases like respiratory diseases.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Agarwal A, Singh M, Chatterjee BP, Chauhan A, Chakraborti A | title = Interplay of T Helper 17 Cells with CD4(+)CD25(high) FOXP3(+) Tregs in Regulation of Allergic Asthma in Pediatric Patients | journal = International Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 2014 | pages = 636238 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24995020 | pmc = 4065696 | doi = 10.1155/2014/636238 }}</ref>\n\nRecent evidence suggests that [[mast cells]] may be important mediators of Treg-dependent peripheral tolerance.<ref name=\"pmid16921386\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lu LF, Lind EF, Gondek DC, Bennett KA, Gleeson MW, Pino-Lagos K, Scott ZA, Coyle AJ, Reed JL, Van Snick J, Strom TB, Zheng XX, Noelle RJ | title = Mast cells are essential intermediaries in regulatory T-cell tolerance | journal = Nature | volume = 442 | issue = 7106 | pages = 997\u20131002 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16921386 | doi = 10.1038/nature05010 | bibcode = 2006Natur.442..997L }}</ref>\n\n===Epitopes===\nRegulatory T cell epitopes ('Tregitopes') were discovered in 2008 and consist of linear sequences of amino acids contained within monoclonal antibodies and immunoglobulin G (IgG).

All T cells begin as [[CD4]]-[[CD8]]-[[T cell receptor|TCR]]- cells at the DN (double-negative) stage, where an individual cell will rearrange its T cell receptor genes to form a unique, functional molecule, which they, in turn, test against cells in the thymic cortex for a minimal level of interaction with self-[[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC]]. If they receive these signals, they proliferate and express both CD4 and CD8, becoming double-positive cells.

At the DP (double-positive) stage, they are selected by their interaction with the cells within the thymus, begin the transcription of Foxp3, and become Treg cells, although they may not begin to express Foxp3 until the single-positive stage, at which point they are functional Tregs. Tregs do not have the limited [[T cell receptor|TCR]] expression of NKT or \u03b3\u03b4 T cells; Tregs have a larger TCR diversity than effector T cells, biased towards self-peptides.\n\nThe process of Treg selection is determined by the affinity of interaction with the self-peptide MHC complex.

Treg cells require [[CD28]] [[co-stimulation]] and [[CD86|B7.2]] expression is largely restricted to the medulla, the development of which seems to parallel the development of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells. It has been suggested that the two are linked, but no definitive link between the processes has yet been shown.

When self/non-self discrimination fails, the immune system destroys cells and tissues of the body and as a result causes [[autoimmune diseases]]. Regulatory T cells actively suppress activation of the immune system and prevent pathological self-reactivity, i.e. autoimmune disease.

While the immunosuppressive function of regulatory T cells prevents the development of autoimmune disease, it is not desirable during immune responses to infectious microorganisms. Current hypotheses suggest that, upon encounter with infectious microorganisms, the activity of regulatory T cells may be downregulated, either directly or indirectly, by other cells to facilitate elimination of the infection. Experimental evidence from mouse models suggests that some pathogens may have evolved to manipulate regulatory T cells to immunosuppress the host and so potentiate their own survival. For example, regulatory T cell activity has been reported to increase in several infectious contexts, such as [[retroviral]] infections (the most well-known of which is [[HIV]]), mycobacterial infections (like [[tuberculosis]]), and various parasitic infections including ''[[Leishmania]]'' and [[malaria]].\n\nTregs play major roles during HIV infection. They suppress the immune system, thus limiting target cells and reducing inflammation, but this simultaneously disrupts the clearance of virus by the cell-mediated immune response and enhances the reservoir by pushing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to a resting state, including infected cells.

High levels of Tregs in the tumor microenvironment are associated with<ref name=\":22\"/> poor prognosis in many cancers, such as ovarian, breast, renal, and pancreatic cancer.<ref name=\":0\" /> This indicates that Tregs suppress Teffector cells  and hinder the body's immune response against the cancer. However, in some types of cancer the opposite is true, and high levels of Tregs are associated with a positive prognosis. This trend is seen  in cancers such as colorectal carcinoma  and follicular lymphoma. This could be due to Treg's ability to suppress general inflammation which is known to trigger cell proliferation and metastasis .<ref name=\":0\" /> These opposite effects indicate that Treg's role in the development of cancer is highly dependent on both type and location of the tumor.\n\nAlthough it is still not entirely understood how Tregs are preferentially trafficked to the tumor microenvironment, the chemotaxis is probably driven by the production of chemokines by the tumor. Treg infiltration into the tumor microenvironment is facilitated by the binding of the chemokine receptor CCR4, which is expressed on Tregs, to its ligand CCL22, which is secreted by many types of tumor cells.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|title = Cytokine patterns in patients with cancer: a systematic review|journal = The Lancet Oncology|pages = e218\u2013e228|volume = 14|issue = 6|doi = 10.1016/s1470-2045(12)70582-x|pmid = 23639322|first = Bodo E|last = Lippitz|year=2013}}</ref> Treg expansion at the site of the tumor could also explain the increased levels of Tregs.

The latest research suggests that regulatory T cells are defined by expression of the forkhead family [[transcription factor]] [[Foxp3]] (forkhead box p3).  Expression of [[Foxp3]] is required for regulatory T cell development and appears to control a genetic program specifying this cell's fate.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Marson A, Kretschmer K, Frampton GM, Jacobsen ES, Polansky JK, MacIsaac KD, Levine SS, Fraenkel E, von Boehmer H, Young RA | title = Foxp3 occupancy and regulation of key target genes during T-cell stimulation | journal = Nature | volume = 445 | issue = 7130 | pages = 931\u20135 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17237765 | pmc = 3008159 | doi = 10.1038/nature05478 | bibcode = 2007Natur.445..931M }}</ref> The large majority of Foxp3-expressing regulatory T cells are found within the [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC) class II restricted [[Cluster of differentiation|CD]]4-expressing (CD4<sup>+</sup>) population and express high levels of the [[interleukin-2]] receptor alpha chain (CD25).  In addition to the Foxp3-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup>, there also appears to be a minor population of MHC class I restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> Foxp3-expressing regulatory T cells. These Foxp3-expressing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells do not appear to be functional in healthy individuals but are induced in autoimmune disease states by T cell receptor stimulation to suppress IL-17-mediated immune responses.<ref>Ellis SD, McGovern JL, van Maurik A, Howe D, Ehrenstein MR, Notley CA. \"Induced CD8+FoxP3+ Treg cells in rheumatoid arthritis are modulated by p38 phosphorylation and monocytes expressing membrane tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 and CD86.\". 2014.

Originally, high expression of CD25 and CD4 surface markers was used (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> cells). This is problematic as CD25 is also expressed on non-regulatory T cells in the setting of immune activation such as during an immune response to a pathogen. As defined by CD4 and CD25 expression, regulatory T cells comprise about 5\u201310% of the mature CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subpopulation in mice and humans, while about 1\u20132% of Treg can be measured in whole blood. The additional measurement of cellular expression of Foxp3 protein allowed a more specific analysis of Treg cells (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells). However, Foxp3 is also transiently expressed in activated human effector T cells, thus complicating a correct Treg analysis using CD4, CD25 and Foxp3 as markers in humans. Therefore, some research groups use another marker, the absence or low-level expression of the surface protein CD127 in combination with the presence of CD4 and CD25. Several additional markers have been described, e.g., high levels of CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated molecule-4) and [[GITR]] (glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor) are also expressed on regulatory T cells, however the functional significance of this expression remains to be defined.  There is a great interest in identifying cell surface markers that are uniquely and specifically expressed on all Foxp3-expressing regulatory T cells.  However, to date no such molecule has been identified.\n\nIn addition to the search for novel protein markers, a different method to analyze and monitor Treg cells more accurately has been described in the literature. This method is based on [[DNA methylation]] analysis. Only in Treg cells, but not in any other cell type, including activated effector T cells, a certain region within the Foxp3 gene (TSDR, Treg-specific-demethylated region) is found demethylated, which allows to monitor Treg cells through a PCR reaction or other DNA-based analysis methods.<ref name=\"pmid19147574\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wieczorek G, Asemissen A, Model F, Turbachova I, Floess S, Liebenberg V, Baron U, Stauch D, Kotsch K, Pratschke J, Hamann A, Loddenkemper C, Stein H, Volk HD, Hoffm\u00fcller U, Gr\u00fctzkau A, Mustea A, Huehn J, Scheibenbogen C, Olek S | title = Quantitative DNA methylation analysis of FOXP3 as a new method for counting regulatory T cells in peripheral blood and solid tissue | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 69 | issue = 2 | pages = 599\u2013608 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19147574 | doi = 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-2361 }}</ref>\nInterplay between the Th17 cells and regulatory T cells are important in many diseases like respiratory diseases.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Agarwal A, Singh M, Chatterjee BP, Chauhan A, Chakraborti A | title = Interplay of T Helper 17 Cells with CD4(+)CD25(high) FOXP3(+) Tregs in Regulation of Allergic Asthma in Pediatric Patients | journal = International Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 2014 | pages = 636238 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24995020 | pmc = 4065696 | doi = 10.1155/2014/636238 }}</ref>\n\nRecent evidence suggests that [[mast cells]] may be important mediators of Treg-dependent peripheral tolerance.<ref name=\"pmid16921386\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lu LF, Lind EF, Gondek DC, Bennett KA, Gleeson MW, Pino-Lagos K, Scott ZA, Coyle AJ, Reed JL, Van Snick J, Strom TB, Zheng XX, Noelle RJ | title = Mast cells are essential intermediaries in regulatory T-cell tolerance | journal = Nature | volume = 442 | issue = 7106 | pages = 997\u20131002 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16921386 | doi = 10.1038/nature05010 | bibcode = 2006Natur.442..997L }}</ref>\n\n===Epitopes===\nRegulatory T cell epitopes ('Tregitopes') were discovered in 2008 and consist of linear sequences of amino acids contained within monoclonal antibodies and immunoglobulin G (IgG).
