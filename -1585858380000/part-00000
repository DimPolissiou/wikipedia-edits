It is, however, legal in some rural counties within the state of [[Prostitution in Nevada|Nevada]]. Prostitution nevertheless occurs elsewhere in the country.\n\nThe regulation of prostitution in the country is not among the [[enumerated powers]] of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]. It is therefore exclusively the domain of the [[U.S. state|states]] to permit, prohibit, or otherwise regulate [[commercial sex]] under the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]], except insofar as Congress may regulate it as part of [[Commerce Clause|interstate commerce]] with laws such as the [[Mann Act]]. In most states, prostitution is considered a [[misdemeanor]] in the category of [[public order crime]]\u2013crime that disrupts the order of a community.  Prostitution was at one time considered a [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] crime.\n\nCurrently, Nevada is the only U.S. jurisdiction to allow legal prostitution \u2013 in the form of regulated [[list of brothels in Nevada|brothel]]s \u2013 the terms of which are stipulated in the ''Nevada Revised Statutes''. Only eight counties currently contain active brothels. All forms of prostitution are illegal in these counties: [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark]] (which contains the [[Las Vegas\u2013Paradise, NV MSA|Las Vegas\u2013Paradise metropolitan area]]), [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe]] (which contains [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]]), [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]], [[Douglas County, Nevada|Douglas]], [[Eureka County, Nevada|Eureka]], [[Lincoln County, Nevada|Lincoln]] & [[Pershing County, Nevada|Pershing]]. The other counties theoretically allow brothel prostitution, but three of these counties currently have no active brothels. [[Street prostitution]], \"pandering\", and [[Pimping|living off of the proceeds of a prostitute]] remain illegal under Nevada law, as is the case elsewhere in the country.\n\nAccording to the [[National Institute of Justice]], a study conducted in 2008 found that approximately 15-20 percent of men in the country have engaged in commercial sex.<ref>{{cite web|title=Percentage of Men (by Country) Who Paid for Sex at Least Once: The Johns Chart|url=http://prostitution.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=004119|date=June 1, 2011|website=ProCon.org}}</ref>\n\nAs with other countries, prostitution in the U.S. can be divided into three broad categories: street prostitution, brothel prostitution, and escort prostitution.\n\n{{Anchor|History}}\n\n==History==\n{{Anchor|18th Century}}\n{{Further|Sexuality in the United States}}\n{{see also|Prostitution in Harlem Renaissance}}\n\n===18th century===\nSome of the [[women in the American Revolution]] who followed the Continental Army served the soldiers and officers as sexual partners. Prostitutes were a worrisome presence to army leadership, particularly because of the possible spread of venereal diseases.\n\n===19th century===\nIn the 19th century, [[parlor]] house [[brothel]]s catered to upper class clientele, while [[bawdy]] houses catered to the lower class. At [[concert saloon]]s, men could eat, listen to music, watch a fight, or pay women for sex. Over 200 brothels existed in lower [[Manhattan]]. Prostitution was illegal under the vagrancy laws, but was not well-enforced by police and city officials, who were bribed by brothel owners and madams. Attempts to regulate prostitution were struck down on the grounds that regulation would be counter to the public good.\n\nThe [[gold rush]] profits of the 1840s to 1900 attracted gambling, crime, saloons, and prostitution to the mining towns of the [[American frontier|wild west]]. A brothel-keeper, [[Julia Bulette]], who was active in the mining town of [[Virginia City]], [[Nevada]], was murdered in 1867. Thirty years before, in 1836, the New York City courtesan [[Helen Jewett]] was murdered by one of her customers, gaining prostitution considerable attention. The [[Lorette Ordinance]] of 1857 prohibited prostitution on the first floor of buildings in [[New Orleans]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prostitution.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000117|title=Prostitution: Historical Timeline|publisher=ProCon.org|accessdate=January 20, 2013}}</ref> Nevertheless, prostitution continued to grow rapidly in the U.S., becoming a $6.3 million business in 1858, more than the [[shipping]] and [[brewing industry|brewing industries]] combined.\n\nSome army officers, however, encouraged the presence of prostitutes during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] to keep troop morale high. In August 20, 1863, the U.S. military commander Brig. General [[Robert S. Granger]] legalized prostitution in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in order to curb venereal disease among [[Union Army|Union soldiers]]. The move was successful and venereal disease rates fell from forty percent to just four percent due to a stringent  program of health checks which required all prostitutes to register and be examined by a board certified physician every two weeks for which they were charged five dollars registration fee plus 50 cents each time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-curious-case-of-nashvilles-frail-sisterhood-7766757/|title=The Curious Case of Nashville's Frail Sisterhood|last1=Serratore|first1=Angela|date=July 8, 2013|website=Smithsonian|language=en|accessdate=April 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Child brothel worker - C Street NW Washington DC - April 1912.jpg|thumb|This area of Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. was known from the mid-1800s to the 1920s as \"Murder Bay,\" home to numerous brothels.

Street prostitution tends to be clustered in certain areas known for solicitation. For instance, statistics on official arrests from the Chicago Police Department from August 19, 2005, to May 1, 2007, suggest that prostitution activity is highly concentrated: nearly half of all prostitution arrests occur in a tiny one-third of one percent of all blocks in the entire city of Chicago.<ref>{{cite web|author=Chicago Booth |url=http://www.chicagobooth.edu/capideas/apr09/4.aspx |title=Capital Ideas: Selected Papers on Chicago Price Theory - April 2009 - Trading Tricks |publisher=Chicagobooth.edu |accessdate=March 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\nA study of violence against women engaged in street prostitution found that 68% reported having been raped and 82% reported having been physically assaulted.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Farley|first1=Melissa|last2=Kelly|first2=Vanessa|title=Prostitution|journal=Women & Criminal Justice|volume=11|issue=4|year=2008|pages=29\u201364|issn=0897-4454|doi=10.1300/J012v11n04_04 }}</ref>\n\nA variation of street prostitution is that which occurs at [[truck stops]] along Interstate highways in rural areas.  Called \"lot lizards\", these prostitutes solicit at truck stop parking lots and may use CB radios to communicate.\n\nIn today's society there is a hierarchy amongst prostitutes and an even greater distinction between indoor workers and outdoor workers. The indoor prostitutes occupy the top tier to include independent call girls, and workers in brothels and massage parlors. The outdoor street walkers occupy the lowest level and are more likely to experience abuse.<ref>Weitzer, R. (2005). New directions in research on prostitution. Crime, Law and Social Change,43(4-5), 211-235. {{doi|10.1007/s10611-005-1735-6}}</ref>\nTwo hundred and forty prostitutes, one hundred and fifteen outdoor and one hundred twenty-five indoor, were interviewed for a study about victimization.

Cunningham & Kendall (2011) report that only 20% of prostitutes work on the streets. The indoor workers have more freedom to choose their clients and set boundaries that contribute to their safety. The above numbers contribute to the arguments against prostitution, which clearly affect one type of sex worker.<ref>Cunningham, & Kendall. (2011). Prostitution 2.0: The changing face of sex work.

Both freelancers and agencies may advertise under the term \"[[Bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]]\" in the back of [[alternative newspaper]]s, although some of these bodywork professionals are straightforward massage professionals.\n\nThe amount of money made by an escort differs depending on race, appearance, age, experience (e.g., pornography and magazine work), gender, services rendered, and location. Generally, [[male prostitute|male escorts]] command less on an hourly basis than women; white women quote higher rates than non-white women; and youth is at a premium. In the gay community, one escort agency in [[Washington, D.C.]], charges $150 an hour for male escorts and $250 an hour for transgender escorts. That agency takes $50 an hour from the escort. In larger metropolitan areas such as [[New York City]], extremely attractive [[Caucasian race|white American]] female escorts can charge $1,000\u2013$2,000 per hour, with the agency taking 40%-50%.<ref name=\"14 October 2016\">{{cite web|last1=Celizic|first1=Mike|title=Former call girl opens up about the industry|url=https://www.today.com/news/former-call-girl-opens-about-industry-2D80555180|website=TODAY.com|accessdate=April 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nTypically, an agency will charge its escorts either a flat fee for each client connection or a percentage of the prearranged rate. In San Francisco, it is usual for typical heterosexual-market agencies to negotiate for as little as $100 up to a full 50% of a woman's reported earnings (not counting any gratuity received). Most transactions occur in cash, and optional tipping of escorts by clients in most major U.S. cities is customary but not compulsory. [[Credit card]] processing offered by larger scale agencies is often available for a service charge.<ref>{{cite web|title=Philadelphia female escorts service in New Jersey|url=https://www.executivechoiceescorts.com/expense.html|website=Escorts Philadelphia|accessdate=April 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nEscorts and escort agencies have historically advertised through [[classified ads]], [[yellow pages]] advertising, or [[word-of-mouth]], but in more recent years, much of the advertising and soliciting of indoor prostitution has shifted to [[internet]] sites. Sites may represent individual escorts, agencies, or may run ads for many escorts. There are also a number of sites in which customers can discuss and post reviews of the sexual services offered by prostitutes and other [[sex workers]]. Many sites allow potential buyers to search for sex workers by physical characteristics and types of services offered.\n\nInternet advertising of sexual services is offered not only by specialty sites, but in many cases by more mainstream advertising sites.

It is, however, legal in some rural counties within the state of [[Prostitution in Nevada|Nevada]]. Prostitution nevertheless occurs elsewhere in the country.\n\nThe regulation of prostitution in the country is not among the [[enumerated powers]] of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]. It is therefore exclusively the domain of the [[U.S. state|states]] to permit, prohibit, or otherwise regulate [[commercial sex]] under the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]], except insofar as Congress may regulate it as part of [[Commerce Clause|interstate commerce]] with laws such as the [[Mann Act]]. In most states, prostitution is considered a [[misdemeanor]] in the category of [[public order crime]]\u2013crime that disrupts the order of a community.  Prostitution was at one time considered a [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] crime.\n\nCurrently, Nevada is the only U.S. jurisdiction to allow legal prostitution \u2013 in the form of regulated [[list of brothels in Nevada|brothel]]s \u2013 the terms of which are stipulated in the ''Nevada Revised Statutes''. Only eight counties currently contain active brothels. All forms of prostitution are illegal in these counties: [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark]] (which contains the [[Las Vegas\u2013Paradise, NV MSA|Las Vegas\u2013Paradise metropolitan area]]), [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe]] (which contains [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]]), [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]], [[Douglas County, Nevada|Douglas]], [[Eureka County, Nevada|Eureka]], [[Lincoln County, Nevada|Lincoln]] & [[Pershing County, Nevada|Pershing]]. The other counties theoretically allow brothel prostitution, but three of these counties currently have no active brothels. [[Street prostitution]], \"pandering\", and [[Pimping|living off of the proceeds of a prostitute]] remain illegal under Nevada law, as is the case elsewhere in the country.\n\nAccording to the [[National Institute of Justice]], a study conducted in 2008 found that approximately 15-20 percent of men in the country have engaged in commercial sex.<ref>{{cite web|title=Percentage of Men (by Country) Who Paid for Sex at Least Once: The Johns Chart|url=http://prostitution.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=004119|date=June 1, 2011|website=ProCon.org}}</ref>\n\nAs with other countries, prostitution in the U.S. can be divided into three broad categories: street prostitution, brothel prostitution, and escort prostitution.\n\n{{Anchor|History}}\n\n==History==\n{{Anchor|18th Century}}\n{{Further|Sexuality in the United States}}\n{{see also|Prostitution in Harlem Renaissance}}\n\n===18th century===\nSome of the [[women in the American Revolution]] who followed the Continental Army served the soldiers and officers as sexual partners. Prostitutes were a worrisome presence to army leadership, particularly because of the possible spread of venereal diseases.\n\n===19th century===\nIn the 19th century, [[parlor]] house [[brothel]]s catered to upper class clientele, while [[bawdy]] houses catered to the lower class. At [[concert saloon]]s, men could eat, listen to music, watch a fight, or pay women for sex. Over 200 brothels existed in lower [[Manhattan]]. Prostitution was illegal under the vagrancy laws, but was not well-enforced by police and city officials, who were bribed by brothel owners and madams. Attempts to regulate prostitution were struck down on the grounds that regulation would be counter to the public good.\n\nThe [[gold rush]] profits of the 1840s to 1900 attracted gambling, crime, saloons, and prostitution to the mining towns of the [[American frontier|wild west]]. A brothel-keeper, [[Julia Bulette]], who was active in the mining town of [[Virginia City]], [[Nevada]], was murdered in 1867. Thirty years before, in 1836, the New York City courtesan [[Helen Jewett]] was murdered by one of her customers, gaining prostitution considerable attention. The [[Lorette Ordinance]] of 1857 prohibited prostitution on the first floor of buildings in [[New Orleans]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prostitution.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000117|title=Prostitution: Historical Timeline|publisher=ProCon.org|accessdate=January 20, 2013}}</ref> Nevertheless, prostitution continued to grow rapidly in the U.S., becoming a $6.3 million business in 1858, more than the [[shipping]] and [[brewing industry|brewing industries]] combined.\n\nSome army officers, however, encouraged the presence of prostitutes during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] to keep troop morale high. In August 20, 1863, the U.S. military commander Brig. General [[Robert S. Granger]] legalized prostitution in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in order to curb venereal disease among [[Union Army|Union soldiers]]. The move was successful and venereal disease rates fell from forty percent to just four percent due to a stringent  program of health checks which required all prostitutes to register and be examined by a board certified physician every two weeks for which they were charged five dollars registration fee plus 50 cents each time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-curious-case-of-nashvilles-frail-sisterhood-7766757/|title=The Curious Case of Nashville's Frail Sisterhood|last1=Serratore|first1=Angela|date=July 8, 2013|website=Smithsonian|language=en|accessdate=April 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Child brothel worker - C Street NW Washington DC - April 1912.jpg|thumb|This area of Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. was known from the mid-1800s to the 1920s as \"Murder Bay,\" home to numerous brothels.

It included a brothel in the basement and 14 cribs suspended from the ceiling, called cages.

Street prostitution tends to be clustered in certain areas known for solicitation. For instance, statistics on official arrests from the Chicago Police Department from August 19, 2005, to May 1, 2007, suggest that prostitution activity is highly concentrated: nearly half of all prostitution arrests occur in a tiny one-third of one percent of all blocks in the entire city of Chicago.<ref>{{cite web|author=Chicago Booth |url=http://www.chicagobooth.edu/capideas/apr09/4.aspx |title=Capital Ideas: Selected Papers on Chicago Price Theory - April 2009 - Trading Tricks |publisher=Chicagobooth.edu |accessdate=March 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\nA study of violence against women engaged in street prostitution found that 68% reported having been raped and 82% reported having been physically assaulted.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Farley|first1=Melissa|last2=Kelly|first2=Vanessa|title=Prostitution|journal=Women & Criminal Justice|volume=11|issue=4|year=2008|pages=29\u201364|issn=0897-4454|doi=10.1300/J012v11n04_04 }}</ref>\n\nA variation of street prostitution is that which occurs at [[truck stops]] along Interstate highways in rural areas.  Called \"lot lizards\", these prostitutes solicit at truck stop parking lots and may use CB radios to communicate.\n\nIn today's society there is a hierarchy amongst prostitutes and an even greater distinction between indoor workers and outdoor workers. The indoor prostitutes occupy the top tier to include independent call girls, and workers in brothels and massage parlors. The outdoor street walkers occupy the lowest level and are more likely to experience abuse.<ref>Weitzer, R. (2005). New directions in research on prostitution. Crime, Law and Social Change,43(4-5), 211-235. {{doi|10.1007/s10611-005-1735-6}}</ref>\nTwo hundred and forty prostitutes, one hundred and fifteen outdoor and one hundred twenty-five indoor, were interviewed for a study about victimization. Weitzer, R (2005) noted that indoor workers experienced less harm compared to outdoor workers: \n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Type of abuse !!Outdoor workers!!Indoor workers\n|-\n|Robbed||37%||10%\n|-\n|Beaten||27%||1%\n|-\n|Slapped, punched, kicked||47%||14%\n|-\n|Raped||22%||2%\n|-\n|Kidnapped||20%||2%\n|}\nThe outdoor prostitutes or streetwalkers are the most recognized sex workers, but they make up a very small number of workers. Cunningham & Kendall (2011) report that only 20% of prostitutes work on the streets. The indoor workers have more freedom to choose their clients and set boundaries that contribute to their safety. The above numbers contribute to the arguments against prostitution, which clearly affect one type of sex worker.<ref>Cunningham, & Kendall. (2011). Prostitution 2.0: The changing face of sex work.

Both freelancers and agencies may advertise under the term \"[[Bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]]\" in the back of [[alternative newspaper]]s, although some of these bodywork professionals are straightforward massage professionals.\n\nThe amount of money made by an escort differs depending on race, appearance, age, experience (e.g., pornography and magazine work), gender, services rendered, and location. Generally, [[male prostitute|male escorts]] command less on an hourly basis than women; white women quote higher rates than non-white women; and youth is at a premium. In the gay community, one escort agency in [[Washington, D.C.]], charges $150 an hour for male escorts and $250 an hour for transgender escorts. That agency takes $50 an hour from the escort. In larger metropolitan areas such as [[New York City]], extremely attractive [[Caucasian race|white American]] female escorts can charge $1,000\u2013$2,000 per hour, with the agency taking 40%-50%.<ref name=\"14 October 2016\">{{cite web|last1=Celizic|first1=Mike|title=Former call girl opens up about the industry|url=https://www.today.com/news/former-call-girl-opens-about-industry-2D80555180|website=TODAY.com|accessdate=April 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nTypically, an agency will charge its escorts either a flat fee for each client connection or a percentage of the prearranged rate. In San Francisco, it is usual for typical heterosexual-market agencies to negotiate for as little as $100 up to a full 50% of a woman's reported earnings (not counting any gratuity received). Most transactions occur in cash, and optional tipping of escorts by clients in most major U.S. cities is customary but not compulsory. [[Credit card]] processing offered by larger scale agencies is often available for a service charge.<ref>{{cite web|title=Philadelphia female escorts service in New Jersey|url=https://www.executivechoiceescorts.com/expense.html|website=Escorts Philadelphia|accessdate=April 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nEscorts and escort agencies have historically advertised through [[classified ads]], [[yellow pages]] advertising, or [[word-of-mouth]], but in more recent years, much of the advertising and soliciting of indoor prostitution has shifted to [[internet]] sites. Sites may represent individual escorts, agencies, or may run ads for many escorts. There are also a number of sites in which customers can discuss and post reviews of the sexual services offered by prostitutes and other [[sex workers]]. Many sites allow potential buyers to search for sex workers by physical characteristics and types of services offered.\n\nInternet advertising of sexual services is offered not only by specialty sites, but in many cases by more mainstream advertising sites.

[Lafayette, we are here!]\" Two days later, 6 July, Headquarters, First Expeditionary Division was redesignated as Headquarters, First Division, American Expeditionary Forces.\n\nOn 8 August 1917, the 1st Division adopted the \"square\" Table of Organization and Equipment (TO&E), which specified two organic infantry brigades of two infantry regiments each; one engineer regiment; one signal battalion; one machine gun battalion; one field artillery brigade of three field artillery regiments, and a complete division train. The total authorized strength of this new TO&E was 27,120 officers and enlisted men.\n\nOn the morning of 23 October, the first American shell of the war was fired toward German lines by a First Division artillery unit. Two days later, the 2nd Battalion of the 16th Infantry suffered the first American casualties of the war.\n\nBy April 1918, the German Army had pushed to within {{convert|40|mi|km}} of Paris. In reaction to this thrust, the division moved into the [[Picardy]] Sector to bolster the exhausted French First Army. To the division's front lay the small village of [[Cantigny]], situated on the high ground overlooking a forested countryside.

The last major World War I battle was fought in the [[Meuse-Argonne offensive|Meuse-Argonne Forest]]. The division advanced a total of seven kilometers and defeated, in whole or part, eight German divisions. This victory was mainly due to the efforts of [[George Marshall|George C. Marshall]], who began the war as the division's Deputy Chief of Staff before being elevated to G-3 for the entire AEF in July, 1918. Combat operations ended with the implementation of the terms of the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|Armistice]] on 11 November 1918. At the time the division was at [[Sedan, France|Sedan]], the farthest American penetration of the war, and was the first to cross the [[Rhine]] into occupied Germany.\n\nBy the end of the war, the division had suffered 4,964 killed in action, 17,201 wounded in action, and 1,056 missing or died of wounds. Five division soldiers received [[Medal of Honor|Medals of Honor]].\n\nThe division's dog-mascot was a mixed breed terrier known as [[Rags (dog)|Rags]].

This was the organization that existed in the Second Corps Area for the duration of the [[Interbellum]] period.\n\n1st Division adopted a new peacetime TO&E in preparation for war on 8 January 1940, which included three infantry regiments, one military police company, one engineer battalion, one signal company, one light field artillery regiment of three field artillery battalions and one medium field artillery regiment of two field artillery battalions, one medical battalion, and one quartermaster battalion. The authorized strength of this TO&E was 9,057 officers and enlisted men. 1st Infantry Division reorganized again on 1 November 1940 to a new TO&E, which added a reconnaissance troop, and organized the two field artillery regiments into a division artillery command, and beefed up the strength to a total authorized strength of 15,245 officers and enlisted men.\n\n==World War II==\n\n===Order of battle===\n\n* Headquarters, 1st Infantry Division\n*[[16th Infantry Regiment (United States)|16th Infantry Regiment]]\n*[[18th Infantry Regiment (United States)|18th Infantry Regiment]]\n*[[26th Infantry Regiment (United States)|26th Infantry Regiment]]\n* Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 1st Infantry Division Artillery\n** 5th Field Artillery Battalion (155&nbsp;mm)\n** 7th Field Artillery Battalion (105&nbsp;mm)\n** 32nd Field Artillery Battalion (105&nbsp;mm)\n** 33rd Field Artillery Battalion (105&nbsp;mm)\n* 1st Engineer Combat Battalion\n* 1st Medical Battalion\n* 1st Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop (Mechanized)\n* Headquarters, Special Troops, 1st Infantry Division\n** Headquarters Company, 1st Infantry Division\n** 701st Ordnance Light Maintenance Company\n** 1st Quartermaster Company\n** 1st Signal Company\n** Military Police Platoon\n** Band\n* 1st Counterintelligence Corps Detachment\n*103rd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion (Automatic Weapons)\n\n===Combat chronicle===\n[[File:1st Division monument on Omaha Beach.jpg|thumb|Monument to the 1st Infantry Division on Omaha Beach.]]\n\nShortly after the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[invasion of Poland]], beginning [[European theatre of World War II|World War II in Europe]], the 1st Infantry Division, under Major General [[Walter Short]], was moved to [[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], on 19 November 1939 where it supported the [[United States Army Infantry School|U.S. Army Infantry School]] as part of American mobilization preparations. It then moved to the [[Sabine Parish, Louisiana|Sabine Parish]], [[Louisiana]] area on 11 May 1940 to participate in the [[Louisiana Maneuvers]]. The division next relocated to [[Fort Hamilton]], [[Brooklyn]] on 5 June 1940, where it spent over six months before moving to [[Fort Devens]], [[Massachusetts]], on 4 February 1941. As part of its training that year, the division participated in both [[Carolina Maneuvers]] of October and November before returning to Fort Devens, Massachusetts on 6 December 1941.\n\nA day later, on 7 December 1941, the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]] and, four days later, Germany [[German declaration of war against the United States (1941)|declared war on the United States]], thus bringing the United States into the conflict.

The division, now under Major General [[Donald C. Cubbison]], was there reorganized and refurbished with new equipment, being re-designated as the 1st Infantry Division on 15 May 1942. Within a week, the division was returned to its former post at Fort Benning, Georgia, from where it was expedited on 21 June 1942 to [[Fort Indiantown Gap|Indiantown Gap Military Reservation]] for wartime overseas deployment final preparation.

They were partnered with the 6th and 17th IA Divisions. 5th Squadron, 4th Cavalry, commanded by LTC Mathew Moore was located at JSS Falcon. They were partnered with the 2nd and 4th FP Divisions. The Special Troops Battalion, commanded by LTC Shilisa Geter, was located at VBC (Victory Base Complex) and partnered with the Baghdad Police Directorate. Meanwhile, due to the drawdown of US forces and the redeployment of theater-level sustainment brigades, the 299th BSB, commanded by LTC Dale Farrand, assumed the area support mission for all DOD and DOS elements within the province of Baghdad in addition to supporting the Dagger Brigade.\n\nSignificant events during this deployment included the resumption of attacks by the Sadrist movement and other Iranian-backed militia, the subsequent operations that stopped those attacks, the rearward passage of lines of USD-North as they redeployed through Baghdad, the organization and training of divisional field artillery regiments for the IA divisions, the fielding of M1 tanks for the 9th IA Division, and the hand-over of all US facilities within Baghdad to the Government of Iraq or elements of the US State Department. During this deployment the brigade simultaneously trained ISF units to the point of conducting Iraqi-led battalion CALFEXs, advised ISF units as they conducted hundreds of Iraqi-led raids which disrupted the attacks of Iranian-backed militia, while also conducting unilateral and combined force protection operations to ensure the security of US bases and redeploying US forces. The brigade experienced nine KIAs during this deployment, the majority of which resulted from a single IRAM attack (improvised rocket-assisted munition) conducted against JSS Loyalty by Iranian-backed militia on 6 June 2011. The brigade departed Iraq in November 2011 after having turned the majority of the city of Baghdad over to complete Iraqi control.\n\n===Afghanistan 2011\u20132012===\nFrom 1st Heavy Brigade Combat Team, 1st Battalion, 16th Infantry (CAB) and 4th Squadron, 4th Cavalry deployed to Afghanistan in the winter of 2011, with 2nd Battalion, 34th Armor (CAB) later deploying in the spring of 2011. 1\u201316 IN (CAB) was assigned to support the combined joint special task force, the Iron Rangers were deployed to 58 remote locations across Afghanistan.

There are two theories as to how the idea of the patch came about. The first theory states that the 1st Division supply trucks were manufactured in England. To make sure the 1st Division's trucks were not confused with other allies, the drivers would paint a huge \"1\" on the side of each truck. Later, the division engineers would go even farther and put a red number one on their sleeves.<ref name=\"big_red_one\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1stid.org/patch.php|title=The Big Red One Patch|work=Society of the First Infantry Division|accessdate=19 October 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122114437/http://www.1stid.org/patch.php|archive-date=22 January 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe second theory claims that a general of the division decided the unit should have a shoulder insignia. He decided to cut a red numeral \"1\" from his flannel underwear. When he showed his prototype to his men, one lieutenant said, \"the general's underwear is showing!\" Offended, the general challenged the young lieutenant to come up with something better. So, the young officer cut a piece of gray cloth from the uniform of a captured soldier, and placed the red \"1\" on top.<ref name=\"big_red_one\"/>\n\n==Song==\n{{poemquote|\nToast of the Army,\nFavorite Son!

Sibert]], from Army units then in service on the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]] and at various Army posts throughout the United States. The original [[table of organization and equipment]] (TO&E) included two [[Organic (military)|organic]] infantry brigades of two infantry regiments each, one engineer battalion; one signal battalion; one trench mortar battery; one field artillery brigade of three field artillery regiments; one air squadron; and a full division train. The total authorized strength of this TO&E was 18,919 officers and enlisted men. [[George S. Patton]], who served as the first headquarters commandant for the [[American Expeditionary Forces]], oversaw much of the arrangements for the movement of the 1st Division to France, and their organization in-country. [[Frank W. Coe]], who later served as Chief of [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps|Coast Artillery]], was the division's first chief of staff.\n\nThe first units sailed from [[New York City]] and [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], on 14 June 1917.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web|url=http://64.78.33.72/history/index.cfm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617065216/http://64.78.33.72/history/index.cfm |archivedate=17 June 2008 |title=History |accessdate=8 October 2019}}</ref> Throughout the remainder of the year, the rest of the division followed, landing at [[St. Nazaire]], France, and [[Liverpool]], England. After a brief stay in rest camps, the troops in England proceeded to France, landing at [[Le Havre]]. The last unit arrived in St. Nazaire 22 December. Upon arrival in France, the division, less its artillery, was assembled in the First (Gondrecourt) training area, and the artillery was at Le Valdahon.\n\nOn 4 July, the 2nd Battalion, [[U.S. 16th Infantry Regiment|16th Infantry]],<ref name=\"2nd Battalion 16th Infantry\">{{cite web|url=http://www.riley.army.mil/Units/4IBCT1ID/2BN16IN.asp |title=2nd Battalion 16th Infantry on Ft.

An apocryphal story holds that at [[Marquis de la Fayette|Lafayette]]'s tomb, to the delight of the attending Parisians, Captain [[C.E. Stanton]] of the division's 16th Infantry Regiment stepped forward and declared, \"Lafayette, nous sommes ici! [Lafayette, we are here!]\" Two days later, 6 July, Headquarters, First Expeditionary Division was redesignated as Headquarters, First Division, American Expeditionary Forces.\n\nOn 8 August 1917, the 1st Division adopted the \"square\" Table of Organization and Equipment (TO&E), which specified two organic infantry brigades of two infantry regiments each; one engineer regiment; one signal battalion; one machine gun battalion; one field artillery brigade of three field artillery regiments, and a complete division train. The total authorized strength of this new TO&E was 27,120 officers and enlisted men.\n\nOn the morning of 23 October, the first American shell of the war was fired toward German lines by a First Division artillery unit. Two days later, the 2nd Battalion of the 16th Infantry suffered the first American casualties of the war.\n\nBy April 1918, the German Army had pushed to within {{convert|40|mi|km}} of Paris. In reaction to this thrust, the division moved into the [[Picardy]] Sector to bolster the exhausted French First Army. To the division's front lay the small village of [[Cantigny]], situated on the high ground overlooking a forested countryside.

The last major World War I battle was fought in the [[Meuse-Argonne offensive|Meuse-Argonne Forest]]. The division advanced a total of seven kilometers and defeated, in whole or part, eight German divisions. This victory was mainly due to the efforts of [[George Marshall|George C. Marshall]], who began the war as the division's Deputy Chief of Staff before being elevated to G-3 for the entire AEF in July, 1918. Combat operations ended with the implementation of the terms of the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|Armistice]] on 11 November 1918. At the time the division was at [[Sedan, France|Sedan]], the farthest American penetration of the war, and was the first to cross the [[Rhine]] into occupied Germany.\n\nBy the end of the war, the division had suffered 4,964 killed in action, 17,201 wounded in action, and 1,056 missing or died of wounds. Five division soldiers received [[Medal of Honor|Medals of Honor]].\n\nThe division's dog-mascot was a mixed breed terrier known as [[Rags (dog)|Rags]].

However, a fight occurs, resulting in Runeard's death and enraging the [[Classical element|elemental spirits]] of [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], [[Water (classical element)|Water]], and [[Air (classical element)|Air]] of the forest. The spirits disappear and a wall of mist traps everyone in the Enchanted Forest. Young Agnarr barely escapes due to the help of an unknown savior.\n\nThree years after her coronation,{{efn|name=Timeline|As depicted in the 2013 film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.}} Elsa celebrates autumn in the kingdom with Anna, [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]] the snowman, [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]] the ice harvester, and Kristoff's reindeer [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]]. One night, when Elsa hears a mysterious voice [[Kulning|calling out]] to her, she follows it and unintentionally awakens the elemental spirits, which forces everyone in the kingdom to evacuate. Grand Pabbie and the Trolls colony arrive at Arendelle and Pabbie informs that they must set things right by discovering the truth about the kingdom's past.\n\nElsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven embark to the Enchanted Forest, following the mysterious voice. After the mist parts at Elsa's touch, the Air spirit, in the form of a [[tornado]], appears and sweeps everyone in its vortex. Elsa stops it, forming a set of ice sculptures. The sisters discover the sculptures are images from their father's past. They encounter the Northuldra and a troop of Arendellian soldiers who are still in conflict with one another. When the Fire spirit appears, Elsa discovers the spirit to be an agitated magical [[Salamanders in folklore|salamander]], and calms it down. Elsa and Anna arrange a truce between the soldiers and the Northuldra after discovering that their mother, Queen Iduna, was a Northuldra who had saved Agnarr, an Arendellian. They later learn the existence of a fifth spirit who will unite people and the magic of nature.\n\nElsa, Anna and Olaf continue to head north, leaving Kristoff and Sven behind. They find their parents' wrecked ship and a map with a route to Ahtohallan, a mythical river told by their mother to contain all explanations of the past. Elsa sends Anna and Olaf away to safety and continues alone. She encounters and tames the [[Neck (water spirit)|N\u00f8kk]], the Water spirit who guards the sea to Ahtohallan. Reaching Ahtohallan, a [[glacier]], Elsa discovers that the voice calling to her was the memory of young Iduna's call; that her powers were given to her by nature because of Iduna's selfless act of saving Agnarr; and that Elsa herself is the fifth spirit.\n\nElsa then learns that the dam was built as a ruse to reduce the Northuldra's resources because of King Runeard's dislike of the tribe's connection with magic and his intention to incorporate the region into his kingdom. She also learns he was the one who initiated the conflict by killing the unarmed leader of the Northuldra. Elsa sends this information to Anna before becoming frozen due to venturing into the most dangerous part of Ahtohallan. This in turn causes Olaf to fade away.\n\nAnna receives Elsa's message and concludes that the dam must be destroyed for peace to be restored. Anna finds and awakens the [[Giant|gigantic Earth spirits]] and lures them towards the dam. The giants hurl boulders aimed at Anna which destroy the dam, sending a flood down the [[fjord]] to the kingdom. Elsa thaws out and returns to Arendelle, diverting the flood and saving the kingdom.\n\nAs the mist disappears, Elsa reunites with Anna and revives Olaf. Kristoff asks Anna to marry him and she accepts. Elsa explains that she and Anna are now the bridge between the people and the magical spirits. Anna becomes the Queen of Arendelle while Elsa becomes the protector of the Enchanted Forest, who regularly visits Arendelle as peace has been restored.\n\nIn a [[post-credit scene]], Olaf visits Elsa's ice palace and recounts the events he experienced to Marshmallow and the Snowgies.{{efn|As depicted in the 2015 short ''[[Frozen Fever]]''.}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kristen Bell]] as [[Anna (Frozen)|Anna]], Princess of Arendelle, and Elsa's younger sister<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n** Hadley Gannaway and Livvy Stubenrauch (archived sound) as Young Anna<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Idina Menzel]] as [[Elsa (Frozen)|Elsa]], Queen of Arendelle and Anna's elder sister who possesses magical ice powers<ref name=\"Frozen2cast\">{{cite news|last1=Sharf|first1=Zack|title='Frozen 2' First Trailer: Elsa and Anna Return in Dazzling New Footage|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|work=[[IndieWire]]|date=February 13, 2019|access-date=February 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216153103/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|archive-date=February 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n** Mattea Conforti and [[Eva Bella]] (archived sound) as Young Elsa<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Josh Gad]] as [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]], a sentient snowman created by Elsa's magic<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n* [[Jonathan Groff]] as [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]], an ice harvester and Anna's boyfriend\n** Groff also provides the voices of [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]] and the reindeer.<ref name=\"PressKit\" />\n* [[Sterling K.

However, a fight occurs, resulting in Runeard's death and enraging the [[Classical element|elemental spirits]] of [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], [[Water (classical element)|Water]], and [[Air (classical element)|Air]] of the forest. The spirits disappear and a wall of mist traps everyone in the Enchanted Forest. Young Agnarr barely escapes due to the help of an unknown savior.\n\nThree years after her coronation,{{efn|name=Timeline|As depicted in the 2013 film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.}} Elsa celebrates autumn in the kingdom with Anna, [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]] the snowman, [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]] the ice harvester, and Kristoff's reindeer [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]]. One night, when Elsa hears a mysterious voice [[Kulning|calling out]] to her, she follows it and unintentionally awakens the elemental spirits, which forces everyone in the kingdom to evacuate. Grand Pabbie and the Trolls colony arrive at Arendelle and Pabbie informs that they must set things right by discovering the truth about the kingdom's past.\n\nElsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven embark to the Enchanted Forest, following the mysterious voice. After the mist parts at Elsa's touch, the Air spirit, in the form of a [[tornado]], appears and sweeps everyone in its vortex. Elsa stops it, forming a set of ice sculptures. The sisters discover the sculptures are images from their father's past. They encounter the Northuldra and a troop of Arendellian soldiers who are still in conflict with one another. When the Fire spirit appears, Elsa discovers the spirit to be an agitated magical [[Salamanders in folklore|salamander]], and calms it down. Elsa and Anna arrange a truce between the soldiers and the Northuldra after discovering that their mother, Queen Iduna, was a Northuldra who had saved Agnarr, an Arendellian. They later learn the existence of a fifth spirit who will unite people and the magic of nature.\n\nElsa, Anna and Olaf continue to head north, leaving Kristoff and Sven behind. They find their parents' wrecked ship and a map with a route to Ahtohallan, a mythical river told by their mother to contain all explanations of the past. Elsa sends Anna and Olaf away to safety and continues alone. She encounters and tames the [[Neck (water spirit)|N\u00f8kk]], the Water spirit who guards the sea to Ahtohallan. Reaching Ahtohallan, a [[glacier]], Elsa discovers that the voice calling to her was the memory of young Iduna's call; that her powers were given to her by nature because of Iduna's selfless act of saving Agnarr; and that Elsa herself is the fifth spirit.\n\nElsa then learns that the dam was built as a ruse to reduce the Northuldra's resources because of King Runeard's dislike of the tribe's connection with magic and his intention to incorporate the region into his kingdom. She also learns he was the one who initiated the conflict by killing the unarmed leader of the Northuldra. Elsa sends this information to Anna before becoming frozen due to venturing into the most dangerous part of Ahtohallan. This in turn causes Olaf to fade away.\n\nAnna receives Elsa's message and concludes that the dam must be destroyed for peace to be restored. Anna finds and awakens the [[Giant|gigantic Earth spirits]] and lures them towards the dam. The giants hurl boulders aimed at Anna which destroy the dam, sending a flood down the [[fjord]] to the kingdom. Elsa thaws out and returns to Arendelle, diverting the flood and saving the kingdom.\n\nAs the mist disappears, Elsa reunites with Anna and revives Olaf. Kristoff asks Anna to marry him and she accepts. Elsa explains that she and Anna are now the bridge between the people and the magical spirits. Anna becomes the Queen of Arendelle while Elsa becomes the protector of the Enchanted Forest, who regularly visits Arendelle as peace has been restored.\n\nIn a [[post-credit scene]], Olaf visits Elsa's ice palace and recounts the events he experienced to Marshmallow and the Snowgies.{{efn|As depicted in the 2015 short ''[[Frozen Fever]]''.}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kristen Bell]] as [[Anna (Frozen)|Anna]], Princess of Arendelle, and Elsa's younger sister<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n** Hadley Gannaway and Livvy Stubenrauch (archived sound) as Young Anna<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Idina Menzel]] as [[Elsa (Frozen)|Elsa]], Queen of Arendelle and Anna's elder sister who possesses magical ice powers<ref name=\"Frozen2cast\">{{cite news|last1=Sharf|first1=Zack|title='Frozen 2' First Trailer: Elsa and Anna Return in Dazzling New Footage|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|work=[[IndieWire]]|date=February 13, 2019|access-date=February 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216153103/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|archive-date=February 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n** Mattea Conforti and [[Eva Bella]] (archived sound) as Young Elsa<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Josh Gad]] as [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]], a sentient snowman created by Elsa's magic<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n* [[Jonathan Groff]] as [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]], an ice harvester and Anna's boyfriend\n** Groff also provides the voices of [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]] and the reindeer.<ref name=\"PressKit\" />\n* [[Sterling K.
