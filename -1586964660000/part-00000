The car was designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and stood out for its [[gull-wing door]]s and brushed stainless-steel outer body panels, as well as an innovative fiberglass body structure with a steel backbone chassis. It became widely known for its disappointing lack of power and performance, which did not match the expectations created by its looks and price tag, but it became iconic for its appearances as the [[DeLorean time machine|time machine]] in the [[Back to the Future (franchise)|''Back to the Future'' media franchise]] after 1985.\n\nThroughout production, the car was generally unchanged, although minor modifications were made to such parts as the hood and wheels. The first production car was completed on January 21, 1981. About 9,000 DeLoreans were made before production halted in late December 1982 shortly after DMC had filed for bankruptcy.\n\n==History==\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 (9979) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A DeLorean with the gull-wing doors closed]]\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 with doors open.jpg|thumb|A DeLorean from the front with the gull-wing doors open]]\nIn October 1976, the first prototype DeLorean was completed by American automotive chief engineer William T. Collins, formerly chief engineer at [[Pontiac]].  Originally, the car was intended to have a centrally-mounted [[Wankel engine|Wankel rotary engine]].  The engine selection was reconsidered when [[Comotor]] production ended, and the favored engine became the [[Ford Cologne V6 engine]].  Eventually the French/Swedish [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] [[V6 PRV engine]] ([[Peugeot]]-[[Renault]]-[[Volvo]]) was selected.  Also the engine location moved from the mid-engined location in the prototype to a rear-engined installation in the production car.  The [[chassis]] was initially planned to be produced from a new and untested manufacturing technology known as elastic reservoir moulding (ERM), which would lighten the car while presumably lowering its production costs.  This new technology, for which DeLorean had purchased patent rights, was eventually found to be unsuitable.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nThese and other changes to the original concept led to considerable schedule pressures.  The entire car was deemed to require almost complete re-engineering, which was turned over to engineer [[Colin Chapman]], founder of [[Lotus Cars]].  Chapman replaced most of the unproven material and manufacturing techniques with those then employed by Lotus, like the steel backbone chassis.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003| pages = 71\u201375}}</ref>\n\nThe first prototype appeared in October 1976 and was known as the DSV-1, or DeLorean Safety Vehicle.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 23}}</ref> As development continued, the model was referred to as the DSV-12<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 28}}</ref> and later the DMC-12 since DMC was targeting a list price of US$12,000 ({{Inflation|US|12000|1976|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) at release.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |title=DeLorean DMC-12 |access-date=February 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204065904/https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |archive-date=February 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>[https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html How an immigrant mechanic used $5 million to bring DeLoreans back to the future] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204014534/https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html |date=February 4, 2019 }} Zack Guzman. 3:52 PM ET Wed, November 9, 2016</ref>\n\nIn an interview with James Espey of the new incarnation of the DeLorean Motor Company of [[Texas]], a drawing surfaced showing that the car originally had the potential to be named \"Z Tavio\".

Approximately 100 partially assembled DeLoreans on the production line were completed by [[Big Lots|Consolidated International]].  About 9,000 cars were produced in total.  The remaining parts from the factory stock, the parts from the US Warranty Parts Center, as well as parts from the original suppliers that had not yet been delivered to the factory were all shipped to [[Columbus, Ohio]] in 1983\u201384.  A company called KAPAC sold these parts to retail and [[wholesaling|wholesale]] customers by mail order.

October 1981 was the highest month of sales for DMC with 720 vehicles sold but by December, the US was falling into recession and interest rates were rising which further negatively impacted sales.  Despite this, instead of reducing production, John DeLorean doubled production output, further adding to the backlog of unsold cars.   By the end of 1981, DMC had produced 7,500 cars but had only sold 3,000.  By this point, DMC was in a financial hardship and in February 1982, DMC was placed into receivership. <ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 130}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1982, unsold 1981 model year cars were \u201cpriced for immediate clearance\u201d in hopes to make room for the more expensive 1982 model year cars.  In March, telegrams were sent to all 343 dealerships requesting each buy six cars to help save the company;  none of the dealers responded with a sales order.  By this point, dealers were sitting on unsold inventory as were the quality assurance centers and hundreds more sitting on the  docks in [[Long Beach]], California.  By the end of May 1982, production at the factory was shut down.  Another attempt in July 1982 was made to revive sales by offering discounts to dealerships and offering a 5-year/{{convert|50000|mi|adj=on}} warranty with the first year or {{convert|12000|mi|adj=on}} portion secured by a major insurance carrier but this was not successful. \n\nBruce McWilliams, VP of Marketing for DMC and later acting President for DMC America, after resigning his position said, \u201cThe car could never be sold in the numbers John DeLorean predicted\u2026\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 133-141}}</ref>\n\n===Production===\nProduction information was lost or scattered upon the [[DeLorean Motor Company#Downturn and bankruptcy|shutdown of DMC]] and production figures for the DeLorean have never been verified based on official factory records.  Despite some unexplained VIN gaps, based upon VIN information, owners have been able to piece together the approximate quantity of DeLoreans produced.\n\nIn February 1982, DMC was placed into [[receivership]] and the factory continued to operate at a reduced production rate until the end of May.  When Consolidated International acquired the unsold and partially assembled cars in November 1982, it brought back workers to complete the cars remaining on the assembly line. It was decided to make the remaining completed 1982 model year cars into 1983 models. The remaining cars VINs were re-VINed into 1983 cars by taking the original VIN number and adding 5000 to it and changing the \"CD\" in the middle of the VIN to \"DD\" thus making a 1983 model.\n\nFor the 1981 model year, there were 6,700 DeLoreans produced (VIN 500-7199).  For the 1982 model year, there were 1,999 DeLoreans produced (VIN 10001-11999).  For the 1983 model year, there were 276 DeLoreans (VIN 17000-17170 and 20001-20105) bringing the total estimated production to 8,975 cars.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9| pages = 115-117}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2007, about 6,500 DeLorean cars were thought to still exist.<ref>{{cite news |first= Martin |last= Zimmerman |url= https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-garage28jul28,0,7786124.story?coll=la-home-center |title= For the DeLorean, it's back to the present |accessdate= January 7, 2013 |work= Los Angeles Times |date= July 28, 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130228154343/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-garage28jul28,0,7786124.story?coll=la-home-center |archive-date= February 28, 2013 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\n==Construction==\nThe DeLorean features a number of unusual construction details, including gull-wing doors, unpainted [[stainless-steel]] body panels, and a rear-mounted engine.\n\n===Body===\n[[File:De Lorean DMC-12 at Wollaton Park, Nottingham, England.jpg|thumb|The gull-wing doors on the DeLorean were a distinctive feature.]]\nThe body design of the DeLorean was a product of [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] of [[Italdesign Giugiaro|Ital Design]] and is panelled in brushed [[AISI steel grades#Stainless steel|SS304]] stainless steel.

The underbody is affixed to a steel double-Y frame chassis, inspired by the [[Lotus Esprit]] platform.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe unpainted stainless body creates challenges during [[Automotive restoration|restoration]] of the cars. In traditional automotive body repair, the panel is repaired to be as original (\"straight\") as possible, and imperfections are sculpted back to form with polyester body filler like [[Bondo (putty)|Bondo]] or lead (body [[solder]]). This poses no problem (aside from originality) with most cars, as the filler will be hidden by the car's paint (for example, most new cars have filler hiding the seam where the roof meets the [[quarter panel]]). With an unpainted stainless body, the stainless steel must be reworked to exactly the original shape, contour, and grain, which is a tremendously difficult job on regular steel (a dented or bent panel is stretched, and a shrinking hammer or other techniques must be used to unstretch the metal) and even more difficult with stainless due to its tendency to [[Work hardening|work-harden]]. Furthermore, it is exceedingly difficult to paint stainless steel due to difficulties with paint adhesion. DeLorean envisioned that damaged panels would simply be replaced rather than repaired.\n\nAnother distinctive feature of the DeLorean is its [[gull-wing door]]s. The common problem of supporting the weight of gull-wing doors was solved by other manufacturers with lightweight doors in the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL]] and a hydraulic pump in the [[Bricklin SV-1]], although these designs had structural or convenience disadvantages. The DeLorean features heavy doors supported by [[Cryogenics|cryogenically]] preset [[Torsion bar suspension|torsion bars]] and gas-charged [[strut]]s.<ref>{{US patent|4,378,658}}</ref> These torsion bars were developed by [[Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation|Grumman Aerospace]] (and built by Unbrako in the UK, a division of SPS Technologies of Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, US) to withstand the stresses of supporting the doors.<ref>{{cite web |first= Knut |last= Grimsrud |url= http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |work= DeLorean FAQ |title= Exotic Technology |publisher= Dmcnews.com |date=  |accessdate= December 4, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110511091013/http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |archive-date= May 11, 2011 |url-status= live }}</ref> Much like the [[scissor doors|doors]] fitted to the [[Lamborghini Countach]], the DeLorean doors featured small cutout windows, because full-sized windows would not be fully retractable within the short door panels.

All of them noted disappointing performance, especially those that performed comparative tests against other vehicles but were otherwise impressed with the car noting commendable gas mileage and most of them noting that the DeLorean is more of a [[grand tourer|GT]] car rather than a sports car or racecar.\n\nHowever, more recent reviews of the car have been much more harsh.  [[Time Magazine]] included the DeLorean on its list of 50 worst cars of all time in 2017.<ref>https://time.com/4723114/50-worst-cars-of-all-time/</ref>  In his book ''Naff Motors: 101 Automotive Lemons'', Tony Davis described the build quality as \"woeful\".

Early production cars needed as much as 140-200 hours of work at DMC Quality Assurance Centers prior to being shipped to dealerships for delivery. DMC eventually sent 30 factory workers to the quality centers in the US to learn about the issues and how to fix them.  Quality issues did improve over time and by 1982 many of the quality issues had been resolved.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 83 - 84}}</ref>\n\nA total of four recalls were issued by the factory to correct issues such as a sticking throttle, front suspension issues and an inertia switch. <ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nOther quality issues that plagued the car included other issues surrounding the front suspension, clutch pedal adjustment (or lack thereof), brake rotors, instruments; in particular the [[speedometer]], power door locks and weak alternators.  Many early DeLoreans were delivered with an incorrect alignment with the toe-in incorrectly set leading to premature tire wear. \n\nIn addition, many dealers were reluctant to perform warranty work on DeLoreans since DMC owed them money for past warranty claims that were still unpaid.  Some dealerships were not able to perform repair work properly as DMC never issued a proper service manual.  The lack of quality service at dealerships was a point of frustration for many DeLorean owners at the time, particularly those who paid over sticker price to purchase one of the first cars.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 111\u2013112}}</ref>\n\n==Pricing and options==\n[[File:1982 De Lorean DMC12 coupe (8453073488).jpg|thumb|1982 DeLorean grey interior]]\nUpon release in 1981, a DeLorean had a suggested retail price of US$25,000 ($650 more when equipped with an [[automatic transmission]]); this is equivalent to approximately US${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|25000|1981}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}.{{inflation-fn|US}}.

This resulted in no clear distinction between the 1981, 1982, and 1983 model years, but with subtle changes taking place almost continuously throughout the life cycle of the DeLorean.\n\n===Hood styles===\nThe original [[hood (vehicle)|hood]] of the DeLorean had [[Groove (machining)|grooves]] running down both sides. It included a tank flap to simplify [[Filling station|fuel filling]]. These cars typically had a locking cap to prevent fuel theft by [[siphon]]ing. In August 1981, the hood flap was removed from the hood of the cars (although the hood creases remained). This style was retained well into 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |title=The DeLorean |publisher=Babb Technology |date=April 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035413/http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> Based on production numbers for all three years, this hood style is probably the most common. After the supply of locking caps was exhausted, the company switched to a non-locking version (resulting in at least 500 cars with no flap, but with locking caps). The final styling for the hood included the addition of a DeLorean name badge and the removal of the grooves, resulting in a completely flat hood. According to senior personnel who worked at the Dunmurry factory, initial elimination of flapped hoods has a simple if unglamorous explanation; Chuck Benington, managing director, did not like the design.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nick Sutton, Purchasing Manager, Dunmurry factory|url=http://dmctalk.org/showthread.php?1412-How-DeLoreans-Were-Originally-Built-Stainless-Panel-Discussion&p=20354&viewfull=1#post20354|accessdate=September 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402132250/http://dmctalk.org/showthread.php?1412-How-DeLoreans-Were-Originally-Built-Stainless-Panel-Discussion&p=20354&viewfull=1#post20354|archive-date=April 2, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>{{multiple image |align=left |direction=horizontal |total_width=600 |image1=Early 1981 De Lorean hood.jpg |width1=387 |height1=142 |alt1=Early 1981 hood |image2=1983 De Lorean hood.jpg |width2=414 |height2=162 |alt2=1983 hood |footer_align=center |footer=Side-by-side comparison of an early 1981 hood (left) vs. a later model 1983 hood (right)}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Other changes===\n[[File:De Lorean add-on Pull strap.jpg|thumb|Early pull strap]]\n[[File:Delorean dmc-12 later style side bolster.jpg|thumb|Later-style one-piece bolster]]\n[[File:mid 1981 De Lorean silver wheel.JPG|thumb|Mid-1981 silver wheel]]\n\nJohn DeLorean was {{height|ft=6|in=4}} tall, and he designed the car to comfortably fit someone of his stature.<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-19/the-deloreans-time-leap|title= The DeLorean's Time Leap|author= Claire Suddath|publisher= [[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|date= April 19, 2012|access-date= July 14, 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140706011419/http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-19/the-deloreans-time-leap|archive-date= July 6, 2014|url-status= live}}</ref> For shorter people, the addition of a pull strap made closing the doors much easier from the inside.

In cars with this construction, is a tendency to place pressure on this piece when entering and exiting the vehicle, which eventually causes the bolstering to separate from the trim panel. To solve this problem, cars built in and after late 1981 have one solid trim piece with the bolster permanently attached.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nAs an addition to later cars, a foot rest, or [[dead pedal]], was added to help prevent [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] while driving. This is one of the few changes that is directly tied to a model year. These were built into only a few of the late-1981 vehicles and were added to all cars starting with 1982 production.<ref name=\"babbtechnology.com\"/>\n\nAlthough the styling of the DeLorean's wheels remained unchanged, the wheels of early-model 1981 vehicles were painted grey. These wheels sported matching grey centre caps with an embossed DMC logo. Early into the 1981 production run, these were changed to a polished silver look, with a contrasting black center cap. The embossed logo on the center caps was painted silver to add contrast.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 25\u201326}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, the DeLorean came with an AM/FM stereo radio with cassette made by Craig. Since the Craig radio did not have a built-in clock, one was installed in front of the [[gear shift]] on the console. DeLorean switched to an ASI stereo in the middle of the 1982 production run. Since the ASI radio featured an on-board clock, the clock on the console was removed at the same time.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 44\u201345}}</ref>\n\nThe first 2,200 cars produced used a windshield-embedded [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. This type of antenna proved to be unsuitable with poor radio reception. Oftentimes the radio would continually \"seek\", attempting to find a signal. A standard whip antenna, which was later changed to a manually retractable antenna, was added to the outside of the front right fender. While improving radio reception, this resulted in a hole in the stainless steel, and an unsightly antenna. As a result, the antenna was again moved. The final antenna was an automatic retractable version installed under the rear induction grill behind the rear driver's-side window.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 28\u201329}}</ref>\n\nThe small [[visor|sun visors]] on the DeLorean have [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] on one side and headliner [[Textile|fabric]] on the other side. Originally these were installed such that the headliner side would be on the bottom when not in use. Later on in 1981, they were reversed so that the vinyl side would be on the bottom.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9| pages = 40}}</ref>\n\nThe original 80 amp Ducellier [[Alternator (auto)|alternator]] supplied with the early-production DeLoreans could not provide enough [[electric current|current]] to supply the car when all lights and electrical options were on; as a result, the [[battery (electricity)|battery]] would gradually discharge, leaving the driver stranded on the road. Beginning with cars built in late 1981, DeLoreans were fitted from the factory with a 90 amp [[Motorola]] alternator, which solved this problem. Additional battery drainage problems were caused by faulty or improperly adjusted door jamb switches. This switch activated the \"safety\" lights located around the door perimeter when it was open. When the door was closed, the door seals prevented the light from being seen. Due to the faulty switches the lights remained on, draining the battery. This happened to DeLorean owner [[Johnny Carson]] shortly after he was presented with the vehicle.\n\n==Notable and unique DeLoreans==\n\n===Prototypes and pilot cars===\nOnly one of two DeLorean prototypes still exists.<ref>{{cite web |author=PJ Grady Europe |url=http://www.pjgrady.co.uk/GenericContent.aspx?PageType=Delorean_Repairs&ShowContent=Prototype_Restoration.html |publisher=DeLorean PJ Grady Europe |title=Delorean Repairs |accessdate=January 13, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421053458/http://www.pjgrady.co.uk/GenericContent.aspx?PageType=Delorean_Repairs&ShowContent=Prototype_Restoration.html |archivedate=April 21, 2014  }}</ref> Prototype 1 sold at the bankruptcy auction in 1984 for $37,000.<ref name=\"upi.com\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/11/25/DeLorean-prototype-cars-sell-at-auction-for-total-58000/3565470206800/ |title=DeLorean prototype cars sell at auction for total $58,000 |access-date=June 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190602233213/https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/11/25/DeLorean-prototype-cars-sell-at-auction-for-total-58000/3565470206800/ |archive-date=June 2, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>  The car remained in a private collection until 2005 when it was sold to the owner of DeLorean Motor Company of Florida (DMCFL) where it received a complete restoration.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/4041986_1587-1976-delorean-dmc-12-original-prototype |title=1587: 1976 DeLorean DMC-12 Original Prototype |access-date=June 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190602234250/https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/4041986_1587-1976-delorean-dmc-12-original-prototype |archive-date=June 2, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Proto 1 is now on display at DMCFL.

The car was designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and stood out for its [[gull-wing door]]s and brushed stainless-steel outer body panels, as well as an innovative fiberglass body structure with a steel backbone chassis. It became widely known for its disappointing lack of power and performance, which did not match the expectations created by its looks and price tag, but it became iconic for its appearances as the [[DeLorean time machine|time machine]] in the [[Back to the Future (franchise)|''Back to the Future'' media franchise]] after 1985.\n\nThroughout production, the car was generally unchanged, although minor modifications were made to such parts as the hood and wheels. The first production car was completed on January 21, 1981. About 9,000 DeLoreans were made before production halted in late December 1982 shortly after DMC had filed for bankruptcy.\n\n==History==\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 (9979) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A DeLorean with the gull-wing doors closed]]\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 with doors open.jpg|thumb|A DeLorean from the front with the gull-wing doors open]]\nIn October 1976, the first prototype DeLorean was completed by American automotive chief engineer William T. Collins, formerly chief engineer at [[Pontiac]].  Originally, the car was intended to have a centrally-mounted [[Wankel engine|Wankel rotary engine]].  The engine selection was reconsidered when [[Comotor]] production ended, and the favored engine became the [[Ford Cologne V6 engine]].  Eventually the French/Swedish [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] [[V6 PRV engine]] ([[Peugeot]]-[[Renault]]-[[Volvo]]) was selected.  Also the engine location moved from the mid-engined location in the prototype to a rear-engined installation in the production car.  The [[chassis]] was initially planned to be produced from a new and untested manufacturing technology known as elastic reservoir moulding (ERM), which would lighten the car while presumably lowering its production costs.  This new technology, for which DeLorean had purchased patent rights, was eventually found to be unsuitable.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nThese and other changes to the original concept led to considerable schedule pressures.  The entire car was deemed to require almost complete re-engineering, which was turned over to engineer [[Colin Chapman]], founder of [[Lotus Cars]].  Chapman replaced most of the unproven material and manufacturing techniques with those then employed by Lotus, like the steel backbone chassis.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003| pages = 71\u201375}}</ref>\n\nThe first prototype appeared in October 1976 and was known as the DSV-1, or DeLorean Safety Vehicle.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 23}}</ref> As development continued, the model was referred to as the DSV-12<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 28}}</ref> and later the DMC-12 since DMC was targeting a list price of US$12,000 ({{Inflation|US|12000|1976|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) at release.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |title=DeLorean DMC-12 |access-date=February 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204065904/https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |archive-date=February 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>[https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html How an immigrant mechanic used $5 million to bring DeLoreans back to the future] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204014534/https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html |date=February 4, 2019 }} Zack Guzman. 3:52 PM ET Wed, November 9, 2016</ref>\n\nIn an interview with James Espey of the new incarnation of the DeLorean Motor Company of [[Texas]], a drawing surfaced showing that the car originally had the potential to be named \"Z Tavio\".

Approximately 100 partially assembled DeLoreans on the production line were completed by [[Big Lots|Consolidated International]].  About 9,000 cars were produced in total.  The remaining parts from the factory stock, the parts from the US Warranty Parts Center, as well as parts from the original suppliers that had not yet been delivered to the factory were all shipped to [[Columbus, Ohio]] in 1983\u201384.  A company called KAPAC sold these parts to retail and [[wholesaling|wholesale]] customers by mail order.

October 1981 was the highest month of sales for DMC with 720 vehicles sold but by December, the US was falling into recession and interest rates were rising which further negatively impacted sales.  Despite this, instead of reducing production, John DeLorean doubled production output, further adding to the backlog of unsold cars.   By the end of 1981, DMC had produced 7,500 cars but had only sold 3,000.  By this point, DMC was in a financial hardship and in February 1982, DMC was placed into receivership. <ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 130}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1982, unsold 1981 model year cars were \u201cpriced for immediate clearance\u201d in hopes to make room for the more expensive 1982 model year cars.  In March, telegrams were sent to all 343 dealerships requesting each buy six cars to help save the company;  none of the dealers responded with a sales order.  By this point, dealers were sitting on unsold inventory as were the quality assurance centers and hundreds more sitting on the  docks in [[Long Beach]], California.  By the end of May 1982, production at the factory was shut down.  Another attempt in July 1982 was made to revive sales by offering discounts to dealerships and offering a 5-year/{{convert|50000|mi|adj=on}} warranty with the first year or {{convert|12000|mi|adj=on}} portion secured by a major insurance carrier but this was not successful. \n\nBruce McWilliams, VP of Marketing for DMC and later acting President for DMC America, after resigning his position said, \u201cThe car could never be sold in the numbers John DeLorean predicted\u2026\u201d<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 133-141}}</ref>\n\n===Production===\nProduction information was lost or scattered upon the [[DeLorean Motor Company#Downturn and bankruptcy|shutdown of DMC]] and production figures for the DeLorean have never been verified based on official factory records.  Despite some unexplained VIN gaps, based upon VIN information, owners have been able to piece together the approximate quantity of DeLoreans produced.\n\nIn February 1982, DMC was placed into [[receivership]] and the factory continued to operate at a reduced production rate until the end of May.  When Consolidated International acquired the unsold and partially assembled cars in November 1982, it brought back workers to complete the cars remaining on the assembly line. It was decided to make the remaining completed 1982 model year cars into 1983 models.

The underbody is affixed to a steel double-Y frame chassis, inspired by the [[Lotus Esprit]] platform.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe unpainted stainless body creates challenges during [[Automotive restoration|restoration]] of the cars. In traditional automotive body repair, the panel is repaired to be as original (\"straight\") as possible, and imperfections are sculpted back to form with polyester body filler like [[Bondo (putty)|Bondo]] or lead (body [[solder]]). This poses no problem (aside from originality) with most cars, as the filler will be hidden by the car's paint (for example, most new cars have filler hiding the seam where the roof meets the [[quarter panel]]). With an unpainted stainless body, the stainless steel must be reworked to exactly the original shape, contour, and grain, which is a tremendously difficult job on regular steel (a dented or bent panel is stretched, and a shrinking hammer or other techniques must be used to unstretch the metal) and even more difficult with stainless due to its tendency to [[Work hardening|work-harden]]. Furthermore, it is exceedingly difficult to paint stainless steel due to difficulties with paint adhesion. DeLorean envisioned that damaged panels would simply be replaced rather than repaired.\n\nAnother distinctive feature of the DeLorean is its [[gull-wing door]]s. The common problem of supporting the weight of gull-wing doors was solved by other manufacturers with lightweight doors in the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL]] and a hydraulic pump in the [[Bricklin SV-1]], although these designs had structural or convenience disadvantages. The DeLorean features heavy doors supported by [[Cryogenics|cryogenically]] preset [[Torsion bar suspension|torsion bars]] and gas-charged [[strut]]s.<ref>{{US patent|4,378,658}}</ref> These torsion bars were developed by [[Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation|Grumman Aerospace]] (and built by Unbrako in the UK, a division of SPS Technologies of Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, US) to withstand the stresses of supporting the doors.<ref>{{cite web |first= Knut |last= Grimsrud |url= http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |work= DeLorean FAQ |title= Exotic Technology |publisher= Dmcnews.com |date=  |accessdate= December 4, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110511091013/http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |archive-date= May 11, 2011 |url-status= live }}</ref> Much like the [[scissor doors|doors]] fitted to the [[Lamborghini Countach]], the DeLorean doors featured small cutout windows, because full-sized windows would not be fully retractable within the short door panels.

All of them noted disappointing performance, especially those that performed comparative tests against other vehicles but were otherwise impressed with the car noting commendable gas mileage and most of them noting that the DeLorean is more of a [[grand tourer|GT]] car rather than a sports car or racecar.\n\nHowever, more recent reviews of the car have been much more harsh.  [[Time Magazine]] included the DeLorean on its list of 50 worst cars of all time in 2017.<ref>https://time.com/4723114/50-worst-cars-of-all-time/</ref>  In his book ''Naff Motors: 101 Automotive Lemons'', Tony Davis described the build quality as \"woeful\".

Early production cars needed as much as 140-200 hours of work at DMC Quality Assurance Centers prior to being shipped to dealerships for delivery. DMC eventually sent 30 factory workers to the quality centers in the US to learn about the issues and how to fix them.  Quality issues did improve over time and by 1982 many of the quality issues had been resolved.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 83 - 84}}</ref>\n\nA total of four recalls were issued by the factory to correct issues such as a sticking throttle, front suspension issues and an inertia switch. <ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nOther quality issues that plagued the car included other issues surrounding the front suspension, clutch pedal adjustment (or lack thereof), brake rotors, instruments; in particular the [[speedometer]], power door locks and weak alternators.  Many early DeLoreans were delivered with an incorrect alignment with the toe-in incorrectly set leading to premature tire wear. \n\nIn addition, many dealers were reluctant to perform warranty work on DeLoreans since DMC owed them money for past warranty claims that were still unpaid.  Some dealerships were not able to perform repair work properly as DMC never issued a proper service manual.  The lack of quality service at dealerships was a point of frustration for many DeLorean owners at the time, particularly those who paid over sticker price to purchase one of the first cars.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 111\u2013112}}</ref>\n\n==Pricing and options==\n[[File:1982 De Lorean DMC12 coupe (8453073488).jpg|thumb|1982 DeLorean grey interior]]\nUpon release in 1981, a DeLorean had a suggested retail price of US$25,000 ($650 more when equipped with an [[automatic transmission]]); this is equivalent to approximately US${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|25000|1981}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}.{{inflation-fn|US}}.

It included a tank flap to simplify [[Filling station|fuel filling]]. These cars typically had a locking cap to prevent fuel theft by [[siphon]]ing. In August 1981, the hood flap was removed from the hood of the cars (although the hood creases remained). This style was retained well into 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |title=The DeLorean |publisher=Babb Technology |date=April 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035413/http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> Based on production numbers for all three years, this hood style is probably the most common. After the supply of locking caps was exhausted, the company switched to a non-locking version (resulting in at least 500 cars with no flap, but with locking caps). The final styling for the hood included the addition of a DeLorean name badge and the removal of the grooves, resulting in a completely flat hood.

In cars with this construction, is a tendency to place pressure on this piece when entering and exiting the vehicle, which eventually causes the bolstering to separate from the trim panel.

Since the Craig radio did not have a built-in clock, one was installed in front of the [[gear shift]] on the console. DeLorean switched to an ASI stereo in the middle of the 1982 production run. Since the ASI radio featured an on-board clock, the clock on the console was removed at the same time.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 44\u201345}}</ref>\n\nThe first 2,200 cars produced used a windshield-embedded [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. This type of antenna proved to be unsuitable with poor radio reception. Oftentimes the radio would continually \"seek\", attempting to find a signal. A standard whip antenna, which was later changed to a manually retractable antenna, was added to the outside of the front right fender. While improving radio reception, this resulted in a hole in the stainless steel, and an unsightly antenna. As a result, the antenna was again moved. The final antenna was an automatic retractable version installed under the rear induction grill behind the rear driver's-side window.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 28\u201329}}</ref>\n\nThe small [[visor|sun visors]] on the DeLorean have [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] on one side and headliner [[Textile|fabric]] on the other side.

Beginning with cars built in late 1981, DeLoreans were fitted from the factory with a 90 amp [[Motorola]] alternator, which solved this problem. Additional battery drainage problems were caused by faulty or improperly adjusted door jamb switches. This switch activated the \"safety\" lights located around the door perimeter when it was open. When the door was closed, the door seals prevented the light from being seen. Due to the faulty switches the lights remained on, draining the battery.

Following the demolition of old [[Beijing-Hankou Railway]], the city of [[Wuhan]] planned to utilize the corridor to construct the city's first rapid transit rail line. In September 1992, the [[Wuhan Metro Construction Group]] was established by [[Wuhan Municipal Construction Commission]] and a supervision group, led by the mayor [[Qian Yunlu]], was subsequently formed in 1993 to facilitate the project's funding, planning, logistics, and organization. Yet, it was seven years before the city was able to fund construction.\n\nIn October 1999, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|National Planning Commission]] (predecessor of the National Development and Reform Commission) approved the Wuhan \"Light Rail\" project (Line 1, phase 1), signaling the start of serious work on the rail transit project. On October 2, 2000, the [[Wuhan|Wuhan Municipal Government]] ratified the establishment of the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]]., and contracted construction, operation, administration and related real estate development to the corporation.\n\nIn December 2000, the National Planning Commission accepted a feasibility report on the project and approved construction on phase 1 of Line 1. On December 23, 2000, the project broke ground and comprehensive construction began.\n\nIn 2002, with the anticipation of an economic boom and increasing demand for urban rail transit, Wuhan Municipal Government approved the city's first long-term rail transit master plan. On July 28, 2004, the ten-station long \"light rail\" line was opened to the public and entered revenue service in August. However, low ridership discouraged the city from funding the extension project, for which ground had been broken on December 15, 2005, and a 4-year delay in construction ensued. In April, 2006, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|NDRC]] ratified a six-year construction/operation plan, but it was not until a year later on April 9, 2007 that NDRC accepted the feasibility report for line 1, phase 2 (the extension project) and approved construction on the project.\n\nIn the interim, construction began on the [[Fanhu station]] of the fully underground line 2 on November 16, 2006, as a response to the six-year plan adopted by NDRC earlier. Construction also began on the underground line 4 stations of [[Wuchang railway station]] in June, and [[Wuhan railway station]] in September, as parts of the integral capital project to revamp and construct the [[Wuhan Railway Hub System|Wuhan Railway Hub]].\n\nIn May 2007, the [[Hubei Provincial Development and Reform Commission]] (HDRC) approved preliminary designs on the Line 1, phase 2, and comprehensive construction subsequently commenced in June. On May 15, the city government approved the establishment of [[Wuhan Metro Co., Ltd]]., which would replace the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]] and assume its responsibilities and benefits.\n\nOn September 12, 2007, the NDRC accepted the feasibility report to Line 2, phase 1, and preliminary designs were approved by the HDRC in December 2007. However, it was not until September 2008 that land purchases and funding were facilitated and comprehensive construction began to take place. In October 2009, drilling of the [[Yangtze River]] tunnel started.\n\nOn March 13, 2009, the NDRC accepted feasibility report to Line 4, phase 1. On May 13, 2009, the HDRC ratified preliminary designs on Line 4, phase 1. Comprehensive construction ensued on the [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] segment of Line 4. A more ambitious urban rapid transit plan was submitted for NDRC review in October, 2009, and in late November, on-site panel investigations were conducted by [[China International Engineering Consulting Corporation]].\n\nIn February 2010 (Wuhan Metro)'s first commercial property topped out in [[Hanxi 1st Road station]]. On July 29, Line 1 phase 2 entered revenue service from [[Dijiao station|Dijiao]] to [[Dongwu Boulevard station|Dongwu Boulevard]]. Despite plans to extend the westernmost terminus to [[Jinshan Avenue]] in [[Dongxihu District]], the station was never built. A short stub with crossover tracks was constructed behind Dongwu Boulevard. [[Zhuyehai]], a station in [[Qiaokou District]], remained non-operational in spite of the existence of complete platforms. Neither exits nor staircases had been built yet. It was due to open when the Wuhan [[IKEA]] store was completed in late 2014.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:\u8f7b\u8f68\u4e8c\u671f\u589e\u8bbe\u7af9\u53f6\u6d77\u7ad9 |url=http://hb.qq.com/a/20090531/000131.htm |language=Chinese}}</ref>\n\nA revised and more detailed construction plan was accepted by the NDRC on January 31, 2011.

Following the demolition of old [[Beijing-Hankou Railway]], the city of [[Wuhan]] planned to utilize the corridor to construct the city's first rapid transit rail line. In September 1992, the [[Wuhan Metro Construction Group]] was established by [[Wuhan Municipal Construction Commission]] and a supervision group, led by the mayor [[Qian Yunlu]], was subsequently formed in 1993 to facilitate the project's funding, planning, logistics, and organization. Yet, it was seven years before the city was able to fund construction.\n\nIn October 1999, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|National Planning Commission]] (predecessor of the National Development and Reform Commission) approved the Wuhan \"Light Rail\" project (Line 1, phase 1), signaling the start of serious work on the rail transit project. On October 2, 2000, the [[Wuhan|Wuhan Municipal Government]] ratified the establishment of the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]]., and contracted construction, operation, administration and related real estate development to the corporation.\n\nIn December 2000, the National Planning Commission accepted a feasibility report on the project and approved construction on phase 1 of Line 1. On December 23, 2000, the project broke ground and comprehensive construction began.\n\nIn 2002, with the anticipation of an economic boom and increasing demand for urban rail transit, Wuhan Municipal Government approved the city's first long-term rail transit master plan. On July 28, 2004, the ten-station long \"light rail\" line was opened to the public and entered revenue service in August. However, low ridership discouraged the city from funding the extension project, for which ground had been broken on December 15, 2005, and a 4-year delay in construction ensued. In April, 2006, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|NDRC]] ratified a six-year construction/operation plan, but it was not until a year later on April 9, 2007 that NDRC accepted the feasibility report for line 1, phase 2 (the extension project) and approved construction on the project.\n\nIn the interim, construction began on the [[Fanhu station]] of the fully underground line 2 on November 16, 2006, as a response to the six-year plan adopted by NDRC earlier. Construction also began on the underground line 4 stations of [[Wuchang railway station]] in June, and [[Wuhan railway station]] in September, as parts of the integral capital project to revamp and construct the [[Wuhan Railway Hub System|Wuhan Railway Hub]].\n\nIn May 2007, the [[Hubei Provincial Development and Reform Commission]] (HDRC) approved preliminary designs on the Line 1, phase 2, and comprehensive construction subsequently commenced in June. On May 15, the city government approved the establishment of [[Wuhan Metro Co., Ltd]]., which would replace the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]] and assume its responsibilities and benefits.\n\nOn September 12, 2007, the NDRC accepted the feasibility report to Line 2, phase 1, and preliminary designs were approved by the HDRC in December 2007. However, it was not until September 2008 that land purchases and funding were facilitated and comprehensive construction began to take place. In October 2009, drilling of the [[Yangtze River]] tunnel started.\n\nOn March 13, 2009, the NDRC accepted feasibility report to Line 4, phase 1. On May 13, 2009, the HDRC ratified preliminary designs on Line 4, phase 1. Comprehensive construction ensued on the [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] segment of Line 4. A more ambitious urban rapid transit plan was submitted for NDRC review in October, 2009, and in late November, on-site panel investigations were conducted by [[China International Engineering Consulting Corporation]].\n\nIn February 2010 (Wuhan Metro)'s first commercial property topped out in [[Hanxi 1st Road station]]. On July 29, Line 1 phase 2 entered revenue service from [[Dijiao station|Dijiao]] to [[Dongwu Boulevard station|Dongwu Boulevard]]. Despite plans to extend the westernmost terminus to [[Jinshan Avenue]] in [[Dongxihu District]], the station was never built. A short stub with crossover tracks was constructed behind Dongwu Boulevard. [[Zhuyehai]], a station in [[Qiaokou District]], remained non-operational in spite of the existence of complete platforms. Neither exits nor staircases had been built yet. It was due to open when the Wuhan [[IKEA]] store was completed in late 2014.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:\u8f7b\u8f68\u4e8c\u671f\u589e\u8bbe\u7af9\u53f6\u6d77\u7ad9 |url=http://hb.qq.com/a/20090531/000131.htm |language=Chinese}}</ref>\n\nA revised and more detailed construction plan was accepted by the NDRC on January 31, 2011. The plan specified the city's plan to complete construction on Line 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 before 2017. Beginning on March 1, Line 1 subdivided its fare zones from 3 to 5 and lowered maximum fare from 5 CNY / ride to 4 CNY / ride.

A feasibility report to Line 6\u2014the second Hankou-Hanyang connection\u2014was also approved by the NDRC on December 21, 2012. Seven days later, line 2 entered revenue service, connecting some of the most populated areas of Hankou, Wuchang, and the [[Optics Valley of China|Optics Valley]].\n\nOn April 12, 2013, the NDRC granted acceptance to a feasibility report of Line 8, phase 1, which connects Hankou and Wuchang via the [[Second Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge|Second Yangtze River Bridge]] corridor. Construction began in June 2013 and was completed in December 2017.\n\n===Timeline of service expansion===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Segment description\n!Date opened\n!Station(s)\n!# of new stations\n!Length (km)\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 1\n|{{date|2004-7-28}}\n|Zongguan \u2014 Huangpu Road\n|10{{NoteTag|in which Taipingyang Station was postponed to open on {{date|2006-4-8}}.}}\n|9.769\n|-\n|Phase \u2161 of Line 1\n|{{date|2010-7-29}}\n| Dongwu Boulevard \u2014 Zongguan;<br> Huangpu Road \u2014 Dijiao\n|16{{NoteTag|in which Zhuyehai Station was postponed to open on {{date|2014-9-17}}.<ref>[http://qzgh.qiaokou.gov.cn/qkxw/bmdt/201409/t20140917_139172.shtml \u8f7b\u8f68\u7af9\u53f6\u6d77\u7ad9\u5b9c\u5bb6\u8054\u5eca\u6865\u6295\u5165\u4f7f\u7528 (Zhuyehai station opened)]</ref>}}\n|18.494\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 2\n|{{date|2012-12-28}}\n| Jinyintan \u2014 Optics Valley Square\n|21\n|27.152\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 4<ref>[http://cjweek.cjn.cn/html/2013-12/27/content_5269051.htm Section one of Metro Line 4 opens]</ref>\n|{{date|2013-12-28}}\n| Wuchang Railway Station \u2014 Wuhan Railway Station\n|15\n|17.974\n|-\n|Hankou North extension of Line 1\n|{{date|2014-5-28}}\n|  Dijiao \u2014 Hankou North\n|3\n|5.555 \n|-\n|Phase \u2161 of Line 4\n|{{date|2014-12-28}}\n| Huangjinkou \u2014 Wuchang Railway Station\n|13\n|15.429\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 3<ref name=\"Line 3\">{{cite news|script-title=zh:\u6b66\u6c49\u5373\u5c06\u5730\u94c1\u6210\u73af \"\u73af\u91d1\u65f6\u4ee3\"\u91cd\u6784\u5546\u4e1a\u5730\u7406  |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/house/wh/2015-12/24/c_1117562445.htm |work=\u957f\u6c5f\u65e5\u62a5 |language=Chinese |date=2015-12-24 |accessdate=2015-12-24 }}</ref>\n|{{date|2015-12-28}}\n|Zhuanyang Boulevard \u2014 Hongtu Boulevard\t\n|24\n|29.660\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 6\n| rowspan=\"2\"|{{date|2016-12-28}}<ref name=\"\u6b66\u6c49\u5730\u94c1\u673a\u573a\u7ebf\u53ca6\u53f7\u7ebf\u4eca\u65e5\u5f00\u901a \u6e56\u5317\u79fb\u52a8\u5168\u9762\u5e03\u5c40\u7f51\u7edc\u8986\u76d6\">[http://tech.cnr.cn/techgd/20161228/t20161228_523405232.shtml  \u6b66\u6c49\u5730\u94c1\u673a\u573a\u7ebf\u53ca6\u53f7\u7ebf\u4eca\u65e5\u5f00\u901a \u6e56\u5317\u79fb\u52a8\u5168\u9762\u5e03\u5c40\u7f51\u7edc\u8986\u76d6]</ref>\n|Jinyinhu Park \u2014 Dongfeng Motor Corporation\t\n|27\n|35.512\n|-\n|Northern extension of Line 2{{NoteTag|also known as Airport Line }}\n|Tianhe International Airport \u2014 Jinyintan\t\n|7\n|19.957\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 8\n| rowspan=\"3\"|{{date|2017-12-26}}\n|Jintan Road \u2014 Liyuan\t\n|12\n|16.204\n|-\n|Yangluo Line\n|Houhu Boulevard \u2014 Jintai\n|16\n|34.575\n|-\n|Jinghe extension of Line 1\n|Dongwu Boulevard \u2014 Jinghe\n|3\n|4.118\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 7\n| rowspan=\"2\"|{{date|2018-10-1}}<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=http://hb.qq.com/a/20181001/003195.htm#p=1|website=www.xinhuanet.com|script-title=zh:\u6b66\u6c49\u957f\u6c5f\u516c\u94c1\u96a7\u9053\u4eca\u65e5\u5f00\u901a 7\u53f7\u7ebf\u300111\u53f7\u7ebf\u8bd5\u8fd0\u8425|access-date=2017-12-26}}</ref>\n|Garden Expo North \u2014 Yezhihu\n|19\n|30.413\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 11\n|Optics Valley Railway Station \u2014 Zuoling\n|13\n|18.744\n|-\n|Southern extension of Line 7\n|{{date|2018-12-28}}\n|Yezhihu \u2014 Qinglongshan Ditiexiaozhen\n|7\n|16.550\n|-\n|Southern extension of Line 2\n|{{date|2019-2-19}}\n|Optics Valley Square \u2014 Fozuling\n|10\n|13.195\n|-\n|Wsetern extension of Line 4<ref name=cjn201909>{{cite web|url=http://news.cjn.cn/sywh/201909/t3460424.htm|title=\u5b9a\u4e86\uff01\u5730\u94c1\u8521\u7538\u7ebf25\u65e5\u4e0a\u53489\u65f6\u5f00\u901a|date=2019-09-23}}</ref>\n|{{date|2019-9-25}}\n|Bailin \u2014 Huangjinkou\n|9\n|16.288\n|-\n|Phase \u2162 of Line 8<ref name=Wuhan8-3>{{cite web|url=https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/3LnB6Rl_lBp71IWU5fBITA|title=\u660e\u65e59\u70b9\uff0c\u6b66\u6c49\u8f68\u9053\u4ea4\u901a8\u53f7\u7ebf\u4e09\u671f\u5de5\u7a0b\u5f00\u901a\u8bd5\u8fd0\u8425|work=Wuhan Metro Operation|date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n|{{date|2019-11-6}}\n|Yezhihu \u2014 Military Athletes' Village\n|3\n|4.832\n|}\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n==Lines==\n{{center|[[File:Wuhan Metro System Map.svg|750px]]}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;text-align:center\"\n|-\n! class=\"unsortable\" colspan=\"100\" style=\"width:450px; \"|Current system\n|-\n! data-sort-type=\"text\"|Line Name\n! class=\"unsortable\" colspan=\"2\"|Termini\n!

S. Bhaskar]]) is a strict father who uses the [[whip]] abundantly on anyone who disobeys him. His wife Lakshmy ([[Lakshmy Ramakrishnan]]) is bedridden, he has two good-for-nothing sons Rama ([[Mayilsamy]]) and Krishna ([[Lollu Sabha Balaji]]), two daughters-in-law, and two daughters. He is against love marriages since his own sister Eshwari ([[Kalpana (Malayalam actress)|Kalpana]]) ran away with the sorcerer Vikramadithyan ([[Thyagu (actor)|Thyagu]]), who is now his archenemy. His younger daughter Divya ([[Sunu Lakshmi]]) is in love with Siddhu (Sathya), the son of the family manager ([[Manobala]]). The night, the lovers secretly meet without the authoritarian Boopathy Pandian knowing. Boopathy Pandian then suspects Vikramadithyan's son Purushothaman ([[Sathyan (Tamil actor)|Sathyan]]) of stalking his daughter. When Boopathy Pandian warns Vikramadithyan to whip again him as he did when Vikramadithyan married his sister, Vikramadithyan swears that his son will marry his younger daughter Divya at any cost.\n\nOne day, Boopathy Pandian finds out an unsigned love letter to Divya. Boopathy Pandian whips his daughter and suspects Purushothaman for writing it, but Purushothaman claims that he has never gone to school and that he is illiterate. Boopathy Pandian decides to hire rowdies to protect his daughter. Therefore, the four clumsy rowdies - Maaja ([[Mahanadi Shankar]]), Goda Govindan ([[Crane Manohar]]), Karadi ([[Bonda Mani]]), and Bruce Lee (Velmurugan) - come to his house. Boopathy Pandian then learns that Siddhu is Divya's lover and feels betrayed by Siddhu, for whom he had high regard. Thereafter, Boopathy Pandian meets his old friend Thangaraj ([[Shanmugarajan]]), and Boopathy Pandian accepts for Divya to get married with Thangaraj's [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|NRI]] son Rajendran (Kovai Babu). Later, Rajendran comes back home with his newlywed wife. The greedy Thangaraj, who wants all of Boopathy Pandian's wealth, drives his newly-wed daughter-in-law away, and Rajendran accepts for the marriage. In the meantime, Boopathy Pandian's daughter Viji ([[Ansiba Hassan]]) elopes with the rowdy Maaja, and they secretly get married.\n\nThe day of the wedding - with Purushothama his parents on one side and Siddhu with the four rowdies on the other - decide to stop the wedding between Divya and the greedy Rajendran. Divya pleaded with her sisters and mother to let her marry Siddhu. They accept and help her elope with Siddhu. Later, Lakshmy convinces Purushothaman to forget Divya. Therefore, Purushothaman decides to help Divya and Siddhu, but Boopathy Pandian, Thangaraj, and Rajendran are hell bent on stopping this elopement. Boopathy Pandian then realises that Thangaraj and Rajendran tried to cheat him and cancels the wedding.\n\nMany months later, Divya is happily married to Siddhu and is pregnant. Boopathy Pandian becomes a nice person and makes peace with Vikramadithyan.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*Sathya as Siddhu\n*[[Sunu Lakshmi]] as Divya\n*[[M. S.

S. Bhaskar]]) is a strict father who uses the [[whip]] abundantly on anyone who disobeys him. His wife Lakshmy ([[Lakshmy Ramakrishnan]]) is bedridden, he has two good-for-nothing sons Rama ([[Mayilsamy]]) and Krishna ([[Lollu Sabha Balaji]]), two daughters-in-law, and two daughters. He is against love marriages since his own sister Eshwari ([[Kalpana (Malayalam actress)|Kalpana]]) ran away with the sorcerer Vikramadithyan ([[Thyagu (actor)|Thyagu]]), who is now his archenemy. His younger daughter Divya ([[Sunu Lakshmi]]) is in love with Siddhu (Sathya), the son of the family manager ([[Manobala]]). The night, the lovers secretly meet without the authoritarian Boopathy Pandian knowing. Boopathy Pandian then suspects Vikramadithyan's son Purushothaman ([[Sathyan (Tamil actor)|Sathyan]]) of stalking his daughter. When Boopathy Pandian warns Vikramadithyan to whip again him as he did when Vikramadithyan married his sister, Vikramadithyan swears that his son will marry his younger daughter Divya at any cost.\n\nOne day, Boopathy Pandian finds out an unsigned love letter to Divya. Boopathy Pandian whips his daughter and suspects Purushothaman for writing it, but Purushothaman claims that he has never gone to school and that he is illiterate. Boopathy Pandian decides to hire rowdies to protect his daughter. Therefore, the four clumsy rowdies - Maaja ([[Mahanadi Shankar]]), Goda Govindan ([[Crane Manohar]]), Karadi ([[Bonda Mani]]), and Bruce Lee (Velmurugan) - come to his house. Boopathy Pandian then learns that Siddhu is Divya's lover and feels betrayed by Siddhu, for whom he had high regard. Thereafter, Boopathy Pandian meets his old friend Thangaraj ([[Shanmugarajan]]), and Boopathy Pandian accepts for Divya to get married with Thangaraj's [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|NRI]] son Rajendran (Kovai Babu). Later, Rajendran comes back home with his newlywed wife. The greedy Thangaraj, who wants all of Boopathy Pandian's wealth, drives his newly-wed daughter-in-law away, and Rajendran accepts for the marriage. In the meantime, Boopathy Pandian's daughter Viji ([[Ansiba Hassan]]) elopes with the rowdy Maaja, and they secretly get married.\n\nThe day of the wedding - with Purushothama his parents on one side and Siddhu with the four rowdies on the other - decide to stop the wedding between Divya and the greedy Rajendran. Divya pleaded with her sisters and mother to let her get married to Siddhu. They accept and help her elope with Siddhu. Later, Lakshmy convinces Purushothaman to forget Divya. Therefore, Purushothaman decides to help Divya and Siddhu, but Boopathy Pandian, Thangaraj, and Rajendran are hell bent on stopping this elopement. Boopathy Pandian then realises that Thangaraj and Rajendran tried to cheat him and cancels the wedding.\n\nMany months later, Divya is happily married to Siddhu and is pregnant. Boopathy Pandian becomes a nice person and makes peace with Vikramadithyan.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*Sathya as Siddhu\n*[[Sunu Lakshmi]] as Divya\n*[[M. S.

The county comprises part of the [[Cotswold Hills]], part of the flat fertile valley of the [[River Severn]], and the entire [[Forest of Dean]].\n\nThe [[county town]] is the [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] of [[Gloucester]], and other principal towns include [[Cheltenham]], [[Stroud]], [[Tewkesbury]], [[Cirencester]] and [[Dursley]].\n\nGloucestershire borders [[Herefordshire]] to the north west, [[Wiltshire]] to the south, [[Bristol]] and [[Somerset]] to the south west, [[Worcestershire]] to the north, [[Oxfordshire]] to the east, [[Warwickshire]] to the north east, and the [[Wales|Welsh]] county of [[Monmouthshire]] to the west.\n\nThe current county does not have the same geographical boundaries as the historical county. Some northern parts of the county, including [[Long Marston, Warwickshire|Long Marston]] and [[Welford-on-Avon]], were transferred to Warwickshire in 1931. Following the [[Local Government Act 1972]], parts of the southern county were transferred to the new county of [[Avon (county)|Avon]], which ceased to exist on 1 April 1996. After 1996, the city of [[Bristol]] and [[South Gloucestershire]] became separate [[Unitary authority|unitary authorities]]. \n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Gloucestershire}}\nGloucestershire is a historic county mentioned in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' in the 10th century, though the areas of [[Winchcombe]] and the [[Forest of Dean]] were not added until the late 11th century. Gloucestershire originally included Bristol, then a small town. The local rural community moved to the port city (as Bristol was to become), and Bristol's population growth accelerated during the industrial revolution. Bristol became a county in its own right, separate from Gloucestershire and Somerset in 1373. It later became part of the administrative [[County of Avon]] from 1974 to 1996.\n\nUpon the abolition of Avon in 1996, the region north of Bristol became a [[unitary authority]] area of [[South Gloucestershire]] and is now part of the [[ceremonial county]] of Gloucestershire.\n\nThe official former postal county abbreviation was \"Glos.\", rather than the frequently used but erroneous \"Gloucs.\" or \"Glouc\".\n\nIn [[2007 United Kingdom floods|July 2007, Gloucestershire suffered the worst flooding]] in recorded British history, with tens of thousands of residents affected. The [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] conducted the largest peacetime domestic operation in its history to rescue over 120 residents from flood affected areas.

There are 42 state secondary schools, not including [[sixth form college]]s, and 12 independent schools, including [[Cheltenham Ladies' College]], [[Cheltenham College]] and [[Dean Close School]]. All but about two schools in each district have a sixth form, but the Forest of Dean only has two schools with sixth forms. All schools in South Gloucestershire have sixth forms.\n\n===Higher and further education===\n[[File:Oxstalls.JPG|thumb|A campus of the [[University of Gloucestershire]]]]\nGloucestershire has two universities, the [[University of Gloucestershire]] and the [[Royal Agricultural University]], and four higher and further education colleges, [[Gloucestershire College]], [[Cirencester College]], [[South Gloucestershire and Stroud College]] and the [[Royal Forest of Dean College]]. Each has campuses at multiple locations throughout the county.  \n\nThe [[University of the West of England]] also has three locations in Gloucestershire; an associate faculty ([[Hartpury College]]) specialising in animal behaviour and welfare, agricultural and sports-related courses in [[Hartpury, Gloucestershire]]; a regional centre at the [[Gloucester Docks]], Alexandra Warehouse, specialising in Adult and Mental Health Nursing; and [[Frenchay|Frenchay Campus]] in [[South Gloucestershire]].\n\n==Towns and cities==\n{{Main|List of places in Gloucestershire}}\n{{see also|List of settlements in Gloucestershire by population}}\n\nGloucestershire has one city and 33 towns:\n\n===Cities===\n*[[Gloucester]]\n\n===Towns===\nThe towns in Gloucestershire are:\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]]\n*[[Bradley Stoke]]\n*[[Cheltenham]]\n*[[Chipping Campden]]\n*[[Chipping Sodbury]]\n*[[Cinderford]]\n*[[Cirencester]]\n*[[Coleford, Gloucestershire|Coleford]]\n*[[Dursley]]\n*[[Emersons Green]]\n*[[Fairford]]\n*[[Filton]]\n*[[Kingswood, South Gloucestershire|Kingswood]]\n*[[Lechlade]]\n*[[Lydney]]\n*[[Minchinhampton]]\n*[[Mitcheldean]]\n*[[Moreton-in-Marsh]]\n*[[Nailsworth]]\n*[[Newent]]\n*[[Northleach]]\n*[[Painswick]]\n*[[Patchway]]\n*[[Quedgeley]]\n*[[Stonehouse, Gloucestershire|Stonehouse]]\n*[[Stow-on-the-Wold]]\n*[[Stroud]]\n*[[Tetbury]]\n*[[Tewkesbury]]\n*[[Thornbury, South Gloucestershire|Thornbury]]\n*[[Winchcombe]]\n*[[Wotton-under-Edge]]\n*[[Yate]]\n{{div col end}}\n\nTown in [[Monmouthshire]] with suburbs in Gloucestershire:\n*[[Chepstow]]\n\n=== Green belt ===\n{{main|Avon Green Belt|Gloucester and Cheltenham Green Belt}}\nThe county has two green belt areas, the first covers the southern area in the South Gloucestershire district, to protect outlying villages and towns between Thornbury and Chipping Sodbury from the [[urban sprawl]] of the [[Bristol Built-up Area|Bristol conurbation]]. The second belt lies around Gloucester, Cheltenham, and Bishop's Cleeve, to afford those areas and villages in between a protection from urban sprawl and further convergence. Both belts intersect with the boundaries of the Cotswolds [[AONB]].\n\n==Antiquities==\nThere are a variety of religious buildings across the county, notably the cathedral of [[Gloucester Cathedral|Gloucester]], the [[Tewkesbury Abbey|abbey church]] of [[Tewkesbury]] (which is over 500 years old and has the tallest Norman tower in England), and the church of [[Cirencester]]. Of the abbey of [[Hailes Abbey|Hailes]] near [[Winchcombe]], founded by [[Richard, Earl of Cornwall]], in 1246, little more than the foundations are left, but these have been excavated and fragments have been brought to light.\n\n[[File:October plenty.jpg|thumb|Parish Church of St. Mary, Fairford]]\nMost of the old [[market town]]s have [[parish church]]es. At [[Deerhurst]] near Tewkesbury and [[Bishop's Cleeve]] near [[Cheltenham]], there are churches of special interest on account of the pre-Norman work they retain. There is also a [[Perpendicular Period|Perpendicular]] church in [[Lechlade]], and that at [[Fairford]] was built (c. 1500), according to tradition, to contain a series of [[stained-glass windows]] which are said to have been brought from the [[Netherlands]]. These are, however, adjudged to be of English workmanship.\n\nOther notable buildings include [[Calcot Manor|Calcot Barn]] in Calcot, a relic of [[Kingswood Abbey]]. [[Thornbury Castle]] is a [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] country house, the pretensions of which evoked the jealousy of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Thomas Wolsey|Wolsey]] against its builder, [[Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham|Edward Stafford, duke of Buckingham]], who was [[decapitation|beheaded]] in 1521.

[[Berkeley Castle]] at over 800 years old and the ruins of [[Great Witcombe Roman Villa|Witcombe Roman Villa]] at Great Witcombe are also notable heritage features.\n\nThere are several [[royal residence]]s in Gloucestershire, including [[Highgrove House]], [[Gatcombe Park]], and (formerly) [[Nether Lypiatt Manor]].\n\nAn annual \"[[Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake|cheese-rolling]]\" event takes place at Cooper's Hill, near [[Brockworth, Gloucestershire|Brockworth]] and the [[Cotswold Games]] occurred within the county.\n\n==Places of interest==\n{{EngPlacesKey|align=right}}\n[[File:Gloucester Cathedral exterior front.jpg|thumb|Gloucester Cathedral]]\n[[File:Aerial photo of Sudeley Castle.jpg|thumb|Aerial photo of Sudeley Castle]]\nPlaces of interest in Gloucestershire include:\n\n*[[Badminton House]], residence of the [[Duke of Beaufort|Dukes of Beaufort]] [[File:HH icon.svg|Historic house]]\n*[[Berkeley Castle]], an example of a feudal stronghold.

The local rural community moved to the port city (as Bristol was to become), and Bristol's population growth accelerated during the industrial revolution. Bristol became a county in its own right, separate from Gloucestershire and Somerset in 1373. It later became part of the administrative [[County of Avon]] from 1974 to 1996.\n\nUpon the abolition of Avon in 1996, the region north of Bristol became a [[unitary authority]] area of [[South Gloucestershire]] and is now part of the [[ceremonial county]] of Gloucestershire.\n\nThe official former postal county abbreviation was \"Glos.\", rather than the frequently used but erroneous \"Gloucs.\" or \"Glouc\".\n\nIn [[2007 United Kingdom floods|July 2007, Gloucestershire suffered the worst flooding]] in recorded British history, with tens of thousands of residents affected. The [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] conducted the largest peacetime domestic operation in its history to rescue over 120 residents from flood affected areas. The damage was estimated at over \u00a32&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6911226.stm |title=Flood crisis grows as rivers rise |work=BBC News |date=23 July 2007 |accessdate=15 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903224122/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6911226.stm |archive-date=3 September 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Geography and environment==\nGloucestershire has three main landscape areas, a large part of the Cotswolds, the Royal Forest of Dean and the Severn Vale. The Cotswolds take up a large portion of the east and south of the county, The Forest of Dean taking up the west, with the Severn and its valley running between these features. The Daffodil Way in the [[River Leadon|Leadon]] Valley, on the border of Gloucestershire and Herefordshire surrounding the village of [[Dymock]], is known for its many spring flowers, orchards, and woodland, which attracts many walkers.\n\n==Economy==\nThis is a chart of trend of regional [[gross value added]] of Gloucestershire at current basic prices [https://web.archive.org/web/20110728091019/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_economy/RegionalGVA.pdf published] (pp.&nbsp;240\u2013253) by ''Office for National Statistics'' with figures in millions of British Pounds Sterling.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

There are 42 state secondary schools, not including [[sixth form college]]s, and 12 independent schools, including [[Cheltenham Ladies' College]], [[Cheltenham College]] and [[Dean Close School]]. All but about two schools in each district have a sixth form, but the Forest of Dean only has two schools with sixth forms. All schools in South Gloucestershire have sixth forms.\n\n===Higher and further education===\n[[File:Oxstalls.JPG|thumb|A campus of the [[University of Gloucestershire]]]]\nGloucestershire has two universities, the [[University of Gloucestershire]] and the [[Royal Agricultural University]], and four higher and further education colleges, [[Gloucestershire College]], [[Cirencester College]], [[South Gloucestershire and Stroud College]] and the [[Royal Forest of Dean College]].

The second belt lies around Gloucester, Cheltenham, and Bishop's Cleeve, to afford those areas and villages in between a protection from urban sprawl and further convergence. Both belts intersect with the boundaries of the Cotswolds [[AONB]].\n\n==Antiquities==\nThere are a variety of religious buildings across the county, notably the cathedral of [[Gloucester Cathedral|Gloucester]], the [[Tewkesbury Abbey|abbey church]] of [[Tewkesbury]] (which is over 500 years old and has the tallest Norman tower in England), and the church of [[Cirencester]]. Of the abbey of [[Hailes Abbey|Hailes]] near [[Winchcombe]], founded by [[Richard, Earl of Cornwall]], in 1246, little more than the foundations are left, but these have been excavated and fragments have been brought to light.\n\n[[File:October plenty.jpg|thumb|Parish Church of St. Mary, Fairford]]\nMost of the old [[market town]]s have [[parish church]]es. At [[Deerhurst]] near Tewkesbury and [[Bishop's Cleeve]] near [[Cheltenham]], there are churches of special interest on account of the pre-Norman work they retain. There is also a [[Perpendicular Period|Perpendicular]] church in [[Lechlade]], and that at [[Fairford]] was built (c. 1500), according to tradition, to contain a series of [[stained-glass windows]] which are said to have been brought from the [[Netherlands]]. These are, however, adjudged to be of English workmanship.\n\nOther notable buildings include [[Calcot Manor|Calcot Barn]] in Calcot, a relic of [[Kingswood Abbey]]. [[Thornbury Castle]] is a [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] country house, the pretensions of which evoked the jealousy of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Thomas Wolsey|Wolsey]] against its builder, [[Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham|Edward Stafford, duke of Buckingham]], who was [[decapitation|beheaded]] in 1521.

The mansion contains a tiled floor from [[Hailes Abbey]]. At Great Badminton is the mansion and vast domain of the Beauforts (formerly of the Botelers and others), on the south-eastern boundary of the county. [[Berkeley Castle]] at over 800 years old and the ruins of [[Great Witcombe Roman Villa|Witcombe Roman Villa]] at Great Witcombe are also notable heritage features.\n\nThere are several [[royal residence]]s in Gloucestershire, including [[Highgrove House]], [[Gatcombe Park]], and (formerly) [[Nether Lypiatt Manor]].\n\nAn annual \"[[Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake|cheese-rolling]]\" event takes place at Cooper's Hill, near [[Brockworth, Gloucestershire|Brockworth]] and the [[Cotswold Games]] occurred within the county.\n\n==Places of interest==\n{{EngPlacesKey|align=right}}\n[[File:Gloucester Cathedral exterior front.jpg|thumb|Gloucester Cathedral]]\n[[File:Aerial photo of Sudeley Castle.jpg|thumb|Aerial photo of Sudeley Castle]]\nPlaces of interest in Gloucestershire include:\n\n*[[Badminton House]], residence of the [[Duke of Beaufort|Dukes of Beaufort]] [[File:HH icon.svg|Historic house]]\n*[[Berkeley Castle]], an example of a feudal stronghold.

Collection of [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]], Glasgow, Scotland.]]\n'''Migration to New Zealand''' began with [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] settlement in [[New Zealand]], then uninhabited, about 1250 to 1280. European migration provided a major influx following the signing of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] in 1840. Subsequent immigration has been chiefly from the British Isles, but also from continental Europe, the Pacific, the Americas and Asia.\n\n==Polynesian settlement==\nPolynesians in the South Pacific were the first to discover the landmass of New Zealand. Eastern [[Polynesia]]n explorers had settled in New Zealand by approximately the thirteenth century CE with most evidence pointing to an arrival date of about 1280. Their arrival gave rise to the [[M\u0101ori culture]] and the [[M\u0101ori language]], both unique to New Zealand, although very closely related to analogues in other parts of Eastern Polynesia. Evidence from [[Wairau Bar]] and the [[Chatham Islands]] shows that the Polynesian colonists maintained many parts of their east Polynesian culture such as burial customs for at least 50 years. Especially strong resemblances link M\u0101ori to the languages and cultures of the [[Cook Islands|Cook]] and [[Society Islands]], which are regarded as the most likely places of origin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.otago.ac.nz/research/hekitenga2009/historyunearthed.html|title=History unearthed|first=University of|last=Otago|website=Otago.ac.nz}}</ref> [[Moriori people|Moriori]] settld the [[Chatham Islands]] during the 15th century from SE South Island of New Zealand.\n\n==Europeun settlement==\nDue to New Zealand's geographic isolation, several centuries passed before the next phase of settlement, the arrival of Europeans (beginning with [[Abel Tasman]]'s visit in 1642). Only then did the original inhabitants need to distinguish themselves from the new arrivals, using the adjective \"m\u0101ori\" which means \"ordinary\" or \"indigenous\" which later became a noun although the term New Zealand native was common until about 1890. M\u0101ori thought of their tribe (iwi) as a nation.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} \n\n[[James Cook]] claimed New Zealand for Britain on his arrival in 1769. The establishment of British colonies in [[Australia]] from 1788 and the boom in [[whaling]] and [[seal hunting|sealing]] in the [[Southern Ocean]] brought many Europeans to the vicinity of New Zealand, with some deciding to settle. Whalers and sealers were often itinerant and the first real settlers were missionaries and traders in the [[Bay of Islands]] area from 1809. By 1830 there was a population of about 800 non M\u0101ori which included a total of about 200 runaway convicts and seamen who often married into the M\u0101ori community.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The seamen often lived in New Zealand for a short time before joining another ship a few months later. In 1839 there were 1100 Europeans living in the North Island. Regular outbreaks of extreme violence mainly between M\u0101ori hapu, known as the Musket Wars, resulted in the deaths of between 20,000 and 50,000 M\u0101ori up until 1843.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Violence against European shipping, cannibalism  and the lack of established law and order made settling in New Zealand a risky prospect. By the late 1830s many M\u0101ori were nominally Christian and had freed many of the M\u0101ori slaves that had been captured during the Musket Wars. By this time, many M\u0101ori, especially in the north, could read and write M\u0101ori and to a lesser extent English.\n\n==Migration from 1840==\n[[File:Shaw-Savill-Line-United-Tribes-Flag.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A poster of the [[Shaw, Savill & Albion Line]] promoting immigration to New Zealand in the 1850s, featuring the flag of the [[United Tribes of New Zealand]].]]\nEuropean migration has resulted in a deep legacy being left on the social and political structures of New Zealand. Early visitors to New Zealand included whalers, sealers, missionaries, mariners, and merchants, attracted to natural resources in abundance. \n\nNew Zealand was administered from [[New South Wales]] from 1788{{dubious|date=November 2017}} and the first permanent settlers were Australians. Some were escaped convicts, and others were ex-convicts that had completed their sentences. Smaller numbers came directly from Great Britain, Ireland, Germany (forming the next biggest immigrant group after the British and Irish),<ref>[http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealanders/NewZealandPeoples/Germans/1/en Germans: First Arrivals] (from the [[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]])</ref> France, Portugal, the Netherlands, Sweden, The United States, and Canada.\n\nIn 1840 representatives of the British Crown signed the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] with 240 M\u0101ori chiefs throughout New Zealand, motivated by plans for a French colony at [[Akaroa]] and land purchases by the [[New Zealand Company]] in 1839. British [[sovereignty]] was then proclaimed over New Zealand in May 1840 and by 1841 New Zealand had ceased being an Australian colony.\n\nFollowing the formalising of sovereignty, organised and structured flow of migrants from Great Britain and Ireland began. Government-chartered ships like the clipper  [[Gananoque (ship)|Gananoque]] and the [[Glentanner (ship)|Glentanner]] carried immigrants to New Zealand. Typically clipper ships left British ports such as London and travelled south through the central Atlantic to about 43 degrees south to pick up the strong westerly winds that carried the clippers  well south of Africa and Australia. Ships would then head north onse in the vicinity of New Zealand. The Glentanner migrant ship of 610 tonnes made two runs to New Zealand and several to Australia carrying 400 tonne of passengers and cargo. Travel time was about 3 to 3 1/2 months to New Zealand. Cargo carried on the Glentanner for New Zealand included coal, slate, lead sheet, wine, beer, cart components, salt, soap and passengers' personal goods. On the 1857 passage the ship carried 163 official passengers, most of them government assisted. On the return trip the ship carried a wool cargo worth 45,000 pounds.<ref>Glentanner. B. Lansley. Dornie Publishing. Invercargill 2013.</ref>  In the 1860s discovery of gold started a gold rush in Otago. By 1860 more than 100,000 British and Irish settlers lived throughout New Zealand. The [[Otago Association]] actively recruited settlers from Scotland, creating a definite Scottish influence in that region, while the [[Canterbury Association]] recruited settlers from the south of England, creating a definite English influence over that region.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/20672|title=4. \u2013 History of immigration \u2013 Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|first=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|last=Taonga|website=Teara.govt.nz}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1860s most migrants settled in the northIsland due to gold discoveries and the availability of flat grass covered land for pastoral farming. The low number of M\u0101ori (about 2,000) and the absence of warfare gave the South Island many advantages. It was only when the New Zealand wars ended that the North Island again became an attractive destination.  In order to attract settlers to the North Island the Government and Auckland Provisional government initiated the Waikato Immigration Scheme which ran from 1864 and 1865.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archives.govt.nz/|title=Archives New Zealand &#124;&#124; Migration|website=Archives.govt.nz}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/20693|title=6. \u2013 History of immigration \u2013 Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|first=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|last=Taonga|website=Teara.govt.nz}}</ref> The central government originally intended to bring about 20,000 immigrants to the Waikato from the British Isles and the Cape Colony in South Africa to consolidate the government position after the wars and develop the Waikato area for European settlement.

They were required to work on and improve the sections for two years after which a Crown Grant would be issued, giving them ownership.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pokenocommunity.nz/history.html|title=Pokeno Community Committee \u2013 Our Place|website=Pokenocommunity.nz}}</ref> In all, 13 ships travelled to New Zealand under the scheme, arriving from London, Glasgow and Cape Town.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://freepages.rootsweb.com/~shipstonz/genealogy/waikatoimmi.html|title=Waikato Immigration Scheme|website=Freepages.rootsweb.com}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1870s, Premier [[Julius Vogel]] borrowed millions of dollars from Britain to help fund capital development such as a nationwide rail system, lighthouses, ports and bridges, and encouraged mass migration from Britain. By 1870 the non-M\u0101ori population reached over 250,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/20686|title=5. \u2013 History of immigration \u2013 Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|first=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|last=Taonga|website=Teara.govt.nz}}</ref>\n\nOther smaller groups of settlers came from Germany, Scandinavia, and other parts of Europe as well as from China and India, but British, Scottish and Irish settlers made up the vast majority, and did so for the next 150 years. Today, the majority of New Zealanders have some sort of British, Scottish, Welsh and Irish ancestry. This comes with last names (mainly British, Irish, and Scottish) as well.\n[[File:Canterbury province plaque Whitehall London.jpg|thumb|Plaque commemorating the first meeting of the [[Canterbury Association]] in [[Charing Cross]], London.

New Zealand finally abolished the poll tax in 1944. Large numbers of Dalmatians fled from the Austro- Hungarian empire to settle in New Zealand around 1900. They settled mainly in west Auckland and often worked to establish vineyards and orchards or worked on gum fields in Northland.\n\nAn influx of Jewish refugees from central Europe came in the 1930s.\n\nMany of the persons of Polish desent in New Zealand arrived as orfans via Siberia and Iran during World War II.\n\n==Post World War II migration==\nWith the various agencies of the [[United Nations]] dealing with humanitarian efforts following the Second World War, New Zealand accepted about 5,000 refugees and displaced persons from Europe, and more than 1,100 [[Hungarians]] between 1956 and 1959 (see [[Refugees in New Zealand]]). The post-WWII immigration included more people from Greece, Italy, Poland and the former [[Yugoslavia]].\n\nNew Zealand limited immigration to those who would meet a labour shortage in New Zealand. To encourage those to come, the government introduced free and assisted passages in 1947, a scheme expanded by the National Party administration in 1950. However, when it became clear that not enough skilled migrants would come from the British Isles alone, recruitment began in Northern European countries. New Zealand signed a bilateral agreement for skilled migrants with the Netherlands, and a large number{{Clarify|date=July 2012}} of Dutch immigrants arrived in New Zealand. Others came in the 1950s from Denmark, Germany, Switzerland and Austria to meet needs in specialised occupations.\n\nBy the 1960s, the policy of exsluding people based on nationality yielded a population overwhelmingly European in origin. By the mid-1960s, a desire for cheap unskilled labour led to ethnic diversification. In the 1950s and 1960s, New Zealand encouraged migrants from the South Pacific. The country had a large demand for unskilled labour in the manufacturing sector. As long as this demand continued, migration was accepted from the South Pacific, and many temporary workers overstayed their visas. Consequently, the Pacific Island population in New Zealand had grown to 45,413 by 1971.{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=28\u201329}} The economic crisis of the early 1970s led to increased [[crime]], [[unemployment]] and other social ailments, which disproportionately affected the Pacific Islander community.{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=64\u201365}}\nFrom 1974 to 1979 [[Robert_Muldoon#The_Dawn_Raids|Dawn Raids]] were carried out by police to remove overstayers, most of whom were Pacific Islanders. \n\nIn april 2005, [[Massey University]] economist Dr Greg Clydesdale released to the news media an extract of a report, ''Growing Pains, Evaluations and the Cost of Human Capital'', which saw Pacific Islanders as \"forming an underclass\".<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/4553798a6000.html] {{dead link|date=July 2019}}</ref>\nThe report, written by Dr Clydesdale for the [http://academyofworldbusiness.com/conf2008.html Academy of World Business, Marketing & Management Development 2008 Conference] in Brazil, and based on data from various government departments, provoked highly controversial debate.

This would end the preference for migrants from Britain, Europe or Northern America based on their race, and instead classify migrants on their skills, personal qualities, and potential contribution to New Zealand economy and society. The introduction of the points-based system came under the National government, which pursued this policy-change even more than the previous [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] administration. This system resembled that of Canada, and came into effect in 1991. Effectively the New Zealand Immigration Service ranks the qualities sought in the migrants and gives them a priority using a points-based scale.

Overall though, New Zealand has one of the highest populations of foreign born citizens. In 2005, almost 20% of [[New Zealanders]] were born overseas, one of the highest percentages of any country in the world. The Department of Labour's sixth annual ''Migration Trends'' report shows a 21 per cent rise in work permits issued in the 2005/06 year compared with the previous year. Nearly 100,000 people were issued work permits to work in sectors ranging from IT to horticulture in the 2005/06 year. This compares with around 35,000 work permits issued in 1999\u20132000.

The introduction of mandatory licensing for New Zealand-based immigration advisers was designed to protect migrants from unscrupulous operators and provide support for licensed advisers.\n\nThe licensing managed by the Immigration Advisers Authority [http://www.iaa.govt.nz Official website] establishes and monitors industry standards and sets requirements for continued [[professional development]]. As an independent body, the Authority can prosecute unlicensed immigration advisers.

Collection of [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]], Glasgow, Scotland.]]\n'''Migration to New Zealand''' began with [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] settlement in [[New Zealand]], then uninhabited, about 1250 to 1280. European migration provided a major influx following the signing of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] in 1840. Subsequent immigration has been chiefly from the British Isles, but also from continental Europe, the Pacific, the Americas and Asia.\n\n==Polynesian settlement==\nPolynesians in the South Pacific were the first to discover the landmass of New Zealand. Eastern [[Polynesia]]n explorers had settled in New Zealand by approximately the thirteenth century CE with most evidence pointing to an arrival date of about 1280. Their arrival gave rise to the [[M\u0101ori culture]] and the [[M\u0101ori language]], both unique to New Zealand, although very closely related to analogues in other parts of Eastern Polynesia. Evidence from [[Wairau Bar]] and the [[Chatham Islands]] shows that the Polynesian colonists maintained many parts of their east Polynesian culture such as burial customs for at least 50 years. Especially strong resemblances link M\u0101ori to the languages and cultures of the [[Cook Islands|Cook]] and [[Society Islands]], which are regarded as the most likely places of origin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.otago.ac.nz/research/hekitenga2009/historyunearthed.html|title=History unearthed|first=University of|last=Otago|website=Otago.ac.nz}}</ref> [[Moriori people|Moriori]] settled the [[Chatham Islands]] during the 15th century from SE South Island of New Zealand.\n\n==European settlement==\nDue to New Zealand's geographic isolation, several centuries passed before the next phase of settlement, the arrival of Europeans (beginning with [[Abel Tasman]]'s visit in 1642). Only then did the original inhabitants need to distinguish themselves from the new arrivals, using the adjective \"m\u0101ori\" which means \"ordinary\" or \"indigenous\" which later became a noun although the term New Zealand native was common until about 1890. M\u0101ori thought of their tribe (iwi) as a nation.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} \n\n[[James Cook]] claimed New Zealand for Britain on his arrival in 1769. The establishment of British colonies in [[Australia]] from 1788 and the boom in [[whaling]] and [[seal hunting|sealing]] in the [[Southern Ocean]] brought many Europeans to the vicinity of New Zealand, with some deciding to settle. Whalers and sealers were often itinerant and the first real settlers were missionaries and traders in the [[Bay of Islands]] area from 1809. By 1830 there was a population of about 800 non M\u0101ori which included a total of about 200 runaway convicts and seamen who often married into the M\u0101ori community.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The seamen often lived in New Zealand for a short time before joining another ship a few months later. In 1839 there were 1100 Europeans living in the North Island. Regular outbreaks of extreme violence mainly between M\u0101ori hapu, known as the Musket Wars, resulted in the deaths of between 20,000 and 50,000 M\u0101ori up until 1843.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Violence against European shipping, cannibalism  and the lack of established law and order made settling in New Zealand a risky prospect. By the late 1830s many M\u0101ori were nominally Christian and had freed many of the M\u0101ori slaves that had been captured during the Musket Wars. By this time, many M\u0101ori, especially in the north, could read and write M\u0101ori and to a lesser extent English.\n\n==Migration from 1840==\n[[File:Shaw-Savill-Line-United-Tribes-Flag.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A poster of the [[Shaw, Savill & Albion Line]] promoting immigration to New Zealand in the 1850s, featuring the flag of the [[United Tribes of New Zealand]].]]\nEuropean migration has resulted in a deep legacy being left on the social and political structures of New Zealand. Early visitors to New Zealand included whalers, sealers, missionaries, mariners, and merchants, attracted to natural resources in abundance. \n\nNew Zealand was administered from [[New South Wales]] from 1788{{dubious|date=November 2017}} and the first permanent settlers were Australians. Some were escaped convicts, and others were ex-convicts that had completed their sentences. Smaller numbers came directly from Great Britain, Ireland, Germany (forming the next biggest immigrant group after the British and Irish),<ref>[http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealanders/NewZealandPeoples/Germans/1/en Germans: First Arrivals] (from the [[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]])</ref> France, Portugal, the Netherlands, Denmark, The United States, and Canada.\n\nIn 1840 representatives of the British Crown signed the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] with 240 M\u0101ori chiefs throughout New Zealand, motivated by plans for a French colony at [[Akaroa]] and land purchases by the [[New Zealand Company]] in 1839. British [[sovereignty]] was then proclaimed over New Zealand in May 1840 and by 1841 New Zealand had ceased being an Australian colony.\n\nFollowing the formalising of sovereignty, organised and structured flow of migrants from Great Britain and Ireland began. Government-chartered ships like the clipper  [[Gananoque (ship)|Gananoque]] and the [[Glentanner (ship)|Glentanner]] carried immigrants to New Zealand. Typically clipper ships left British ports such as London and travelled south through the central Atlantic to about 43 degrees south to pick up the strong westerly winds that carried the clippers  well south of South Africa and Australia. Ships would then head north once in the vicinity of New Zealand. The Glentanner migrant ship of 610 tonnes made two runs to New Zealand and several to Australia carrying 400 tonne of passengers and cargo. Travel time was about 3 to 3 1/2 months to New Zealand. Cargo carried on the Glentanner for New Zealand included coal, slate, lead sheet, wine, beer, cart components, salt, soap and passengers' personal goods.

The low number of M\u0101ori (about 2,000) and the absence of warfare gave the South Island many advantages. It was only when the New Zealand wars ended that the North Island again became an attractive destination.  In order to attract settlers to the North Island the Government and Auckland Provisional government initiated the Waikato Immigration Scheme which ran from 1864 and 1865.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archives.govt.nz/|title=Archives New Zealand &#124;&#124; Migration|website=Archives.govt.nz}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/20693|title=6. \u2013 History of immigration \u2013 Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|first=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|last=Taonga|website=Teara.govt.nz}}</ref> The central government originally intended to bring about 20,000 immigrants to the Waikato from the British Isles and the Cape Colony in South Africa to consolidate the government position after the wars and develop the Waikato area for European settlement. The immigration scheme settlers were allocated quarter-acre town sections and ten-acre rural sections. They were required to work on and improve the sections for two years after which a Crown Grant would be issued, giving them ownership.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pokenocommunity.nz/history.html|title=Pokeno Community Committee \u2013 Our Place|website=Pokenocommunity.nz}}</ref> In all, 13 ships travelled to New Zealand under the scheme, arriving from London, Glasgow and Cape Town.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://freepages.rootsweb.com/~shipstonz/genealogy/waikatoimmi.html|title=Waikato Immigration Scheme|website=Freepages.rootsweb.com}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1870s, Premier [[Julius Vogel]] borrowed millions of pounds from Britain to help fund capital development such as a nationwide rail system, lighthouses, ports and bridges, and encouraged mass migration from Britain.

Today, the majority of New Zealanders have some sort of British, Scottish, Welsh and Irish ancestry. This comes with last names (mainly British, Irish, and Scottish) as well.\n[[File:Canterbury province plaque Whitehall London.jpg|thumb|Plaque commemorating the first meeting of the [[Canterbury Association]] in [[Charing Cross]], London.

New Zealand finally abolished the poll tax in 1944. Large numbers of Dalmatians fled from the Austro- Hungarian empire to settle in New Zealand around 1900. They settled mainly in west Auckland and often worked to establish vineyards and orchards or worked on gum fields in Northland.\n\nAn influx of Jewish refugees from central Europe came in the 1930s.\n\nMany of the persons of Polish descent in New Zealand arrived as orphans via Siberia and Iran during World War II.\n\n==Post World War II migration==\nWith the various agencies of the [[United Nations]] dealing with humanitarian efforts following the Second World War, New Zealand accepted about 5,000 refugees and displaced persons from Europe, and more than 1,100 [[Hungarians]] between 1956 and 1959 (see [[Refugees in New Zealand]]). The post-WWII immigration included more people from Greece, Italy, Poland and the former [[Yugoslavia]].\n\nNew Zealand limited immigration to those who would meet a labour shortage in New Zealand. To encourage those to come, the government introduced free and assisted passages in 1947, a scheme expanded by the National Party administration in 1950. However, when it became clear that not enough skilled migrants would come from the British Isles alone, recruitment began in Northern European countries. New Zealand signed a bilateral agreement for skilled migrants with the Netherlands, and a large number{{Clarify|date=July 2012}} of Dutch immigrants arrived in New Zealand. Others came in the 1950s from Denmark, Germany, Switzerland and Austria to meet needs in specialised occupations.\n\nBy the 1960s, the policy of excluding people based on nationality yielded a population overwhelmingly European in origin. By the mid-1960s, a desire for cheap unskilled labour led to ethnic diversification. In the 1950s and 1960s, New Zealand encouraged migrants from the South Pacific. The country had a large demand for unskilled labour in the manufacturing sector. As long as this demand continued, migration was accepted from the South Pacific, and many temporary workers overstayed their visas. Consequently, the Pacific Island population in New Zealand had grown to 45,413 by 1971.{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=28\u201329}} The economic crisis of the early 1970s led to increased [[crime]], [[unemployment]] and other social ailments, which disproportionately affected the Pacific Islander community.{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=64\u201365}}\nFrom 1974 to 1979 [[Robert_Muldoon#The_Dawn_Raids|Dawn Raids]] were carried out by police to remove overstayers, most of whom were Pacific Islanders. \n\nIn May 2008, [[Massey University]] economist Dr Greg Clydesdale released to the news media an extract of a report, ''Growing Pains, Evaluations and the Cost of Human Capital'', which saw Pacific Islanders as \"forming an underclass\".<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/4553798a6000.html] {{dead link|date=July 2019}}</ref>\nThe report, written by Dr Clydesdale for the [http://academyofworldbusiness.com/conf2008.html Academy of World Business, Marketing & Management Development 2008 Conference] in Brazil, and based on data from various government departments, provoked highly controversial debate.

This would end the preference for migrants from Britain, Europe or Northern America based on their race, and instead classify migrants on their skills, personal qualities, and potential contribution to New Zealand economy and society. The introduction of the points-based system came under the National government, which pursued this policy-change even more than the previous [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] administration. This system resembled that of Canada, and came into effect in 1991. Effectively the New Zealand Immigration Service ranks the qualities sought in the migrants and gives them a priority using a points-based scale. In 2010 the new Immigration Act replaced all existing protocols and procedures.\n\nThe Government published the results of an immigration review in December 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.beehive.govt.nz/ViewDocument.aspx?DocumentID=27894 |title=Comprehensive immigration law closer|publisher=New Zealand Government|date=5 December 2006|accessdate=6 November 2007}}</ref>\n\nRegulations provide that immigrants must be of good character.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas|title=New Zealand Visas &#124; Immigration New Zealand|website=Immigration.govt.nz}}</ref>\n\n===New migrant groups===\n[[Image:NZ residency by country of nationality 2004-5FY.PNG|right|thumb|400px|Acquisition of New Zealand residency by citizenship, 2004/05 (fy).<br>Source: [[New Zealand Department of Labour]]<ref>[http://www.immigration.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/E05EABDB-9F88-4B68-9104-20D6D86C07EC/0/MigrationTrends200405.pdf Home New Zealand Department of Labour \u2013 Migration Trends 2004/05] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410225714/http://www.immigration.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/E05EABDB-9F88-4B68-9104-20D6D86C07EC/0/MigrationTrends200405.pdf |date=10 April 2008 }}, accessed 8 December 2007</ref>]]\n\nThis policy resulted in a wide variety of ethnicities in New Zealand, with people from over 120 countries represented.

However, the net effect was a population decline, since more left than arrived. 48,815 arrived, and overall the population was 10,000 or 0.25% less than the previous year. Overall though, New Zealand has one of the highest populations of foreign born citizens. In 2005, almost 20% of [[New Zealanders]] were born overseas, one of the highest percentages of any country in the world. The Department of Labour's sixth annual ''Migration Trends'' report shows a 21 per cent rise in work permits issued in the 2005/06 year compared with the previous year. Nearly 100,000 people were issued work permits to work in sectors ranging from IT to horticulture in the 2005/06 year. This compares with around 35,000 work permits issued in 1999\u20132000. Around 52,000 people were approved for [[New Zealand permanent residency|permanent New Zealand residence]] in 2005/06.

The introduction of mandatory licensing for New Zealand-based immigration advisers was designed to protect migrants from unscrupulous operators and provide support for licensed advisers.\n\nThe licensing managed by the Immigration Advisers Authority [http://www.iaa.govt.nz Official website] establishes and monitors industry standards and sets requirements for continued [[professional development]]. As an independent body, the Authority can prosecute unlicensed immigration advisers. Penalties include up to seven years imprisonment and/or fines up to $NZ100,000 for offenders, as well as the possibility of court-ordered reparation payments. It can refer complaints made against licensed advisers to an Independent Tribunal, i.e. [https://www.justice.govt.nz/tribunals/immigration/advisers-complaints-disciplinary/ Immigration Advisers Complaints & Disciplinary Tribunal]. \n\nThe Immigration Advisers Authority does not handle immigration applications or inquiries.

For the [[Illinois House of Representatives]], the county is located in the 93rd district and is currently represented by Republican [[Norine Hammond]]. The county is located in the 47th district of the [[Illinois Senate]], and is currently represented by Republican [[Jil Tracy]].\n\nBrown County is part of the German-settled area of western [[Central Illinois]] and the [[Missouri Rhineland]] centred on the St. Louis metropolitan area. This region was opposed both to southern [[planter (American South)|plantation owners]] and socially liberal [[Yankee]]s and consequently voted against the majority of people in their state. Brown County voted for the Democratic candidate in every presidential election from at least [[1840 United States presidential election|1840]] through [[1948 United States presidential election|1948]], with the sole exception of the [[1928 United States presidential election|1928 election]] when the county voted for the Republican candidate [[Herbert Hoover]]. From 1952 to 2016, Democrats have carried Brown County only three times (1964, 1976, and 1992) and have won a majority of the vote only once (1964).\n\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential election results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential election results'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|last=Leip|first=David|website=uselectionatlas.org|access-date=2018-10-29}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

This region was opposed both to southern [[planter (American South)|plantation owners]] and socially liberal [[Yankee]]s and consequently voted against the majority of people in their state. Brown County voted for the Democratic candidate in every presidential election from at least [[1840 United States presidential election|1840]] through [[1948 United States presidential election|1948]], with the sole exception of the [[1928 United States presidential election|1928 election]] when the county voted for the Republican candidate [[Herbert Hoover]]. From 1952 to 2016, Democrats have carried Brown County only three times (1964, 1976, and 1992) and have won a majority of the vote only once (1964).\n\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential election results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential election results'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|last=Leip|first=David|website=uselectionatlas.org|access-date=2018-10-29}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!
