She is only one of two verified people to have reached age 116 in the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]].\n\n==Biography==\nBorn as Mar\u00eda Esther Heredia Lecaro in [[Guayaquil]], she was the daughter of a colonel, and lived a life among the upper-class elite, attending social functions and art classes. She never smoked or drank hard liquor.\n\nIn 1917, she married Antonio Capovilla (1864\u20131949), who was a military officer. An ethnic Italian, Antonio was born in Pola, [[Austria-Hungary]] (now [[Pula]], Croatia). He moved to [[Chile]] in 1894 and then to Ecuador in 1910. After his first wife died, he married Mar\u00eda. Together they had five children, three of whom were still living at the time of Mar\u00eda's death: Hilda (age 81), Irma (age 79) and son Anibal (age 77). She also had twelve grandchildren, twenty great-grandchildren and two great-great-grandchildren.<ref>{{cite news|title=116-Year-Old Ecuadorean Woman is Oldest Living Person |agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=2005-12-16 |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/12/16/116-year-old-ecuadorean-woman-is-oldest-living-person/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HRXnWmv4?url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/12/16/116-year-old-ecuadorean-woman-is-oldest-living-person/ |archivedate=2013-06-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAt age 100, Capovilla nearly died and was given [[anointing of the sick|last rites]], but had been free of health problems since then. In December 2005, at the age of 116, Maria was in good health for someone of her age and watched TV, read the paper and walked without the aid of a stick (though she was helped by an aide). Capovilla was unable to leave her home in the two years before her death and she shared her home with her eldest daughter Hilda, and her son-in-law. In a media interview Capovilla stated her dislike of the fact that women nowadays are permitted to court men, rather than the reverse.\n\nIn March 2006, however, Capovilla's health had declined, and she was not able to read the newspaper any more. She had nearly stopped talking and no longer walked except when helped by two people. Still, Capovilla was able to sit in her chair and fan herself, and had been doing fine until she succumbed to a bout of [[pneumonia]] in the last week of August 2006, 18 days before she would have celebrated her 117th birthday.<ref>{{cite web|last1=BBC|title=World's oldest person dies at 116|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5293436.stm|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Age records==\nCapovilla's records were submitted to Guinness on 27 August 2005, exactly one year before her death at the age of {{age in years and days|1889|9|14|2005|8|27}}, and was named the World's Oldest Person by Guinness World Records on 9 December 2005 at the age of {{age in years and days|1889|9|14|2005|12|9}}, thus superseding both [[Hendrikje van Andel-Schipper]] of the Netherlands thought to be the world's oldest person from 29 May 2004 to 30 August 2005, when she died, and [[Elizabeth Bolden]] of the United States, thought to be the world's oldest person from 30 August 2005 to 9 December 2005.<ref name=Maier>{{cite book |title= Supercentenarians|last= Maier|first= Heiner|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2010|publisher= Springer|location= |isbn= 3-642-11519-5|page= |pages= 256|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0Fjkhcn3oeIC|ref= S2010}} ([http://www.demogr.mpg.de/books/drm/007/3-3.pdf pdf])</ref> Capovilla was added to the Guinness website on 12 April 2006 at the age of {{age in years and days|1889|9|14|2006|4|12|sep=and}}.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ecuadorian Usurps Tennessean as World's Oldest Person (Update2) |first=Alex |last=Morales |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] |date=2005-12-14 |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=abIJjQtBtd8g |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HRYEnHjd?url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=abIJjQtBtd8g |archivedate=2013-06-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAt the time of her death at age 116 years, 347 days, Capovilla was the fifth-oldest verified person to have ever lived.

She is only one of two verified people to have reached age 116 in the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]].\n\n==Biography==\nBorn as Mar\u00eda Esther Heredia Lecaro in [[Guayaquil]], she was the daughter of a colonel, and lived a life among the upper-class elite, attending social functions and art classes. She never smoked or drank hard liquor.\n\nIn 1917, she married Antonio Capovilla (1864\u20131949), who was a military officer. An ethnic Italian, Antonio was born in Pola, [[Austria-Hungary]] (now [[Pula]], Croatia). He moved to [[Chile]] in 1894 and then to Ecuador in 1910. After his first wife died, he married Mar\u00eda. Together they had five children, three of whom were still living at the time of Mar\u00eda's death: Hilda (age 81), Irma (age 79) and son Anibal (age 77). She also had twelve grandchildren, twenty great-grandchildren and two great-great-grandchildren.<ref>{{cite news|title=116-Year-Old Ecuadorean Woman is Oldest Living Person |agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=2005-12-16 |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/12/16/116-year-old-ecuadorean-woman-is-oldest-living-person/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HRXnWmv4?url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/12/16/116-year-old-ecuadorean-woman-is-oldest-living-person/ |archivedate=2013-06-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAt age 100, Capovilla nearly died and was given [[anointing of the sick|last rites]], but had been free of health problems since then. In December 2005, at the age of 116, Maria was in good health for someone of her age and watched TV, read the paper and walked without the aid of a stick (though she was helped by an aide). Capovilla was unable to leave her home in the two years before her death and she shared her home with her eldest daughter Hilda, and her son-in-law. In a media interview Capovilla stated her dislike of the fact that women nowadays are permitted to court men, rather than the reverse.\n\nIn March 2006, however, Capovilla's health had declined, and she was not able to read the newspaper any more. She had nearly stopped talking and no longer walked except when helped by two people. Still, Capovilla was able to sit in her chair and fan herself, and had been doing fine until she succumbed to a bout of [[pneumonia]] in the last week of August 2006, 18 days before she would have celebrated her 117th birthday.<ref>{{cite web|last1=BBC|title=World's oldest person dies at 116|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5293436.stm|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Age records==\nCapovilla's records were submitted to Guinness on 27 August 2005, exactly one year before her death at the age of {{age in years and days|1889|9|14|2005|8|27}}, and was named the World's Oldest Person by Guinness World Records on 9 December 2005 at the age of {{age in years and days|1889|9|14|2005|12|9}}, thus superseding both [[Hendrikje van Andel-Schipper]] of the Netherlands thought to be the world's oldest person from 29 May 2004 to 30 August 2005, when she died, and [[Elizabeth Bolden]] of the United States, thought to be the world's oldest person from 30 August 2005 to 9 December 2005.<ref name=Maier>{{cite book |title= Supercentenarians|last= Maier|first= Heiner|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2010|publisher= Springer|location= |isbn= 3-642-11519-5|page= |pages= 256|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0Fjkhcn3oeIC|ref= S2010}} ([http://www.demogr.mpg.de/books/drm/007/3-3.pdf pdf])</ref> Capovilla was added to the Guinness website on 12 April 2006 at the age of {{age in years and days|1889|9|14|2006|4|12|sep=and}}.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ecuadorian Usurps Tennessean as World's Oldest Person (Update2) |first=Alex |last=Morales |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] |date=2005-12-14 |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=abIJjQtBtd8g |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HRYEnHjd?url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=abIJjQtBtd8g |archivedate=2013-06-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAt the time of her death at age 116 years, 347 days, Capovilla was the fifth-oldest verified person to have ever lived.

A month later, he scored his first league goal.\n\n====Loan to Jablonec====\nIn the 2007\u201308 season, Necid made his debut in the [[UEFA Champions League]], however, he was loaned to [[FK Jablonec]] for the second half of the season. Despite playing only 14 matches (of 30), he was Jablonec's top scorer of the season with five goals. When Necid came to FK Jablonec they were in 15th place (out of 16), which means relegation to a lower league. Nevertheless, the team finished the season in 12th place, and therefore survived, with Necid being one of the heroes of the team. When his loan came to an end, he stated he wanted to return to Slavia and did not want to play for Jablonec again.\n\nAt the end of the season, in his first match for Slavia after his return from Jablonec, he scored a goal against [[FC Slovan Liberec|Liberec]]. Slavia Prague won the [[2007\u201308 Gambrinus liga]]. In 2008, he won the Talent of the Year award at the [[Czech Footballer of the Year]] awards.<ref>{{in lang|cs}} [http://nv.fotbal.cz/fotbalista-roku/historie/index.php Historie ankety Fotbalista roku] at [[\u010cMFS]] website</ref>\n\n===CSKA Moscow===\nIn August 2008 [[PFC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]], who were interested in Necid since 2006,<ref>http://www.sports.ru/football/6507613.html</ref> signed a deal with Slavia Prague according to which Necid would stay at Slavia until the end of the year and would join CSKA in January 2009.<ref>http://www.sports.ru/football/5596400.html</ref> He played his first competitive match for CSKA Moscow on 7 March 2009 in the [[Russian Super Cup 2009]] where he came on as a substitute on the 78th minute and scored the winning goal for his team in extra time in the 113th minute.
