The Soviet Union proclaimed itself a socialist state and proclaimed its commitment to building a [[socialist economy]] in its [[1936 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1936 constitution]] and a subsequent [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]]. It was governed by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] as a single-party state ostensibly with a [[democratic centralism]] organization, with [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] remaining its [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|official guiding ideology]] until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union's dissolution]] on 26 December 1991. The political systems of these Marxist\u2013Leninist socialist states revolve around the central role of the party which holds ultimate authority. Internally, the [[communist party]] practices a form of democracy called [[democratic centralism]].<ref name=\"Furtak, Robert K. 1986\"/> During the [[22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1961, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] announced the completion of socialist construction and declared the optimistic goal of achieving [[Communism in 20 years|communism in twenty years]]. The [[Eastern Bloc]] was a political and economic bloc of [[Satellite state#Soviet satellite states|Soviet-aligned socialist states]] in Eastern and Central Europe which adhered to Marxism\u2013Leninism, Soviet-style [[Eastern Bloc politics|governance]] and [[Soviet-type economic planning|command economy]].\n\nThe [[China|People's Republic of China]] was founded on 1 October 1949 and proclaims itself to be a socialist state in its [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|1982 constitution]]. The [[North Korea|Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] (North Korea) used to be a [[communist state|Marxist\u2013Leninist state]]. In 1972, the country adopted a new [[Constitution of North Korea|constitution]] which changed the official state ideology to ''[[Juche]]'' which is held to be a distinct Korean re-interpretation of the former ideology.<ref name=\"freemediaproductions.info\">{{cite web|url=http://www.freemediaproductions.info/Editorials/2009/08/30/juche-is-third-position-ideology-built-on-marx-not-marxist-leninism/|title=Juche is Third Position ideology built on Marx \u2013 Not Marxist-Leninism|publisher=Free Media Productions \u2013 Editorials|date=30 August 2009|accessdate=25 December 2015}}</ref> Similarly, direct references to [[communism]] in the [[Laos|Lao People's Democratic Republic]] are not included in its [[Constitution of Laos|founding documents]], although it gives direct power to the governing ruling party, the Marxist\u2013Leninist [[Lao People's Revolutionary Party]]. The preamble to the [[Constitution of Vietnam|constitution]] of the [[Vietnam|Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] states that Vietnam only entered a transition stage between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]] after the country was [[Vietnamese reunification|re-unified]] under the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] in 1976.<ref>[http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/politics/constitution/ \"VN Embassy \u2013 Constitution of 1992\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709162321/http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/politics/constitution/|date=9 July 2011}} From the Preamble: \"On 2 July 1976, the National Assembly of reunified Vietnam decided to change the country's name to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam; the country entered a period of transition to socialism, strove for national construction, and unyieldingly defended its frontiers while fulfilling its internationalist duty.\"</ref>\n\nThe [[Constitution of Cuba|1992 constitution]] of the [[Cuba|Republic of Cuba]] states that the role of the [[Communist Party of Cuba]] is to \"guide the common effort toward the goals and construction of socialism (and the progress toward a communist society)\".<ref>[http://www.cubanet.org/ref/dis/const_92_e.htm \"Constitution of the Republic of Cuba, 1992\"].

In most cases, these are constitutional references to the building of a socialist society and political principles that have little to no bearing on the structure and guidance of these country's [[machinery of government]] and [[economic system]]. The preamble to the 1976 [[Constitution of Portugal]] states that the Portuguese state has as one of its goals opening \"the way to socialist society\".<ref>The [http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/po00000_.html \"Preamble to the 1976 Constitution of Portugal\"] stated: \"The Constituent Assembly affirms the Portuguese people's decision to defend their national independence, safeguard the fundamental rights of citizens, establish the basic principles of democracy, secure the primacy of the rule of law in a democratic state, and open the way to socialist society.\"</ref> [[Algeria]], the [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]] have directly used the term socialist in their official constitution and name. [[Croatia]], [[Hungary]] and [[Poland]] directly denounce \"Communism\" in their founding documents in reference to their past regimes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/hr00000_.html|title=Croatia Constitution|last=Tschentscher|first=Axel|website=Servat.unibe.ch|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/hu__indx.html|title=Hungary Index|last=Tschentscher|first=Axel|website=Servat.unibe.ch|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/pl00000_.html|title=Poland - Constitution|last=Tschentscher|first=Axel|website=Servat.unibe.ch|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn these cases, the intended meaning of socialism can vary widely and sometimes the constitutional references to socialism are left over from a previous period in the country's history. In the case of many Middle Eastern states, the term socialism was often used in reference to an [[Arab socialism|Arab socialist]]/[[Arab nationalism|nationalist]] philosophy adopted by specific regimes such as that of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and that of the various [[Ba'ath parties]]. Examples of countries directly using the term socialist in their names include the [[Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka]] and the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] while a number of countries make references to socialism in their constitutions, but not in their names. These include India<ref>The Preamble of the Constitution of India reads: \"We, the people of India, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic, republic [...]\". See [[Preamble to the Constitution of India]].</ref> and [[Portugal]]. In addition, countries like [[Belarus]], [[Colombia]], [[France]], [[Russia]] and [[Spain]] use the varied term social state, leaving a more ambiguous meaning. In the constitutions of Croatia, Hungary and Poland, direct condemnation is made to the respective past socialist regimes. The [[autonomous region]] of [[Rojava]] which operates under the principles of [[democratic confederalism]] has been described as a socialist state.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wall|first=Derek|url=http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-fe30-Rojava-a-beacon-of-hope-fighting-Isis|title=Rojava: a beacon of hope fighting Isis|newspaper=Morning Star|date=25 August 2014|accessdate=25 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105163107/http://morningstaronline.co.uk/a-fe30-Rojava-a-beacon-of-hope-fighting-Isis|archive-date=5 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Other uses ===\n{{social democracy sidebar}}\nDuring the [[post-war consensus]], [[nationalization]] of large industries was relatively widespread and it was not uncommon for commentators to describe some European countries as democratic socialist states seeking to move their countries toward a [[socialist economy]].<ref name=\"Dissident 1991\">Heilbroner, Robert L.

Marxists trace the formation of the contemporary form of the [[sovereign state]] to the emergence of capitalism as a dominant mode of production, with its organizational precepts and functions designed specifically to manage and regulate the affairs of a capitalist economy. Because this involves governance and laws passed in the interest of the [[bourgeoisie]] as a whole and because government officials either come from the bourgeoisie or are dependent upon their interests, Marx characterized the [[capitalist state]] as a [[dictatorship of the bourgeoisie]]. Extrapolating from this, Marx described a post-revolutionary government on the part of the working class or proletariat as a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] because the economic interests of the proletariat would have to guide state affairs and policy during a transitional state. Alluding further to the establishment of a socialist and communist economy where [[social ownership]] displaces [[private ownership]], and thus class distinctions on the basis of private property ownership are eliminated, the modern state would have no function and would gradually \"wither away\" or be transformed into a new form of governance.<ref>{{cite book|language=de|last=Engels|first=Friedrich|title=Die Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe|series=Karl Marx-Friedrich Engels: Welke|volume=20|editor=Institut f\u00fcr Marxismus-Leninismus bein ZK der SED|publisher=Dietz Verlag|location=Berlin|year=1962}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|language=de|last=Engels|first=Friedrich|title=Die Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe|series=Karl Marx-Friedrich Engels: Welke|volume=21|editor=Institut f\u00fcr Marxismus-Leninismus bein ZK der SED|publisher=Dietz Verlag|location=Berlin|year=1962}}</ref>\n\nInfluenced by the pre-Marxist [[utopian socialist]] philosopher [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], [[Friedrich Engels]] theorized the nature of the state would change during the transition to socialism.

The dictatorship of the proletariat would represent this transitional state and would involve working class interests dominating government policy in the same manner that capitalist class interests dominate government policy under capitalism (the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie). Engels argued that as socialism developed, the state would change in form and function. Under socialism, it is not a \"government of people, but the administration of things\", thereby ceasing to be a state by the traditional definition.<ref>\"Withering away of the state\".

In order not to be overthrown once having conquered power, Engels argues that the working class \"must, on the one hand, do away with all the old repressive machinery previously used against it itself, and, on the other, safeguard itself against its own deputies and officials, by declaring them all, without exception, subject to recall at any moment\".

Bernstein stated: \"The socialist movement is everything to me while what people commonly call the goal of Socialism is nothing\".<ref>[[Manfred Steger|Steger, Manfred]] (1996). ''Selected Writings Of Eduard Bernstein, 1920\u20131921''. New Jersey: Humanities Press.</ref> Following Marx, [[revolutionary socialists]] instead take the view that the working class grows stronger through its battle for reforms (such as in Marx's time the ten-hours bill). In 1848, Marx and Engels wrote: {{quote|Now and then the workers are victorious, but only for a time. The real fruit of their battles lies, not in the immediate result, but in the ever expanding union of the workers. [...] [I]t ever rises up again, stronger, firmer, mightier.

Retrieved 30 December 2019.</ref>}}\n\nAccording to the [[orthodox Marxist]] conception, these battles eventually reach a point where a revolutionary movement arises. A revolutionary movement is required in the view of Marxists to sweep away the capitalist state and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie which must be abolished and replaced with a dictatorship of the proletariat in order to begin constructing a socialist society. In this view, only through revolution can a socialist state be established as written in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'': {{quote|In depicting the most general phases of the development of the proletariat, we traced the more or less veiled civil war, raging within existing society, up to the point where that war breaks out into open revolution, and where the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie lays the foundation for the sway of the proletariat.|Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels|''The Communist Manifesto''<ref name=\"auto\"/>}}\n\n=== Leninist theory of the state ===\n{{main|Leninism}}\nWhereas Marx, Engels and [[classical Marxist]] thinkers had little to say about the organization of the state in a socialist society, presuming the modern state to be specific to the capitalist mode of production, [[Vladimir Lenin]] pioneered the idea of a revolutionary state based on his theory of the revolutionary [[vanguard party]] and organizational principles of [[democratic centralism]]. Adapted to the conditions of semi-feudal Russia, Lenin's concept of the dictatorship of the proletariat involved a revolutionary vanguard party acting as representatives of the proletariat and its interests. According to Lenin's [[April Theses]], the goal of the revolution and vanguard party is not the introduction of socialism (it could only be established on a worldwide scale), but to bring production and the state under the control of the [[Soviet (council)|soviets]] of workers' deputies. Following the [[October Revolution]] in Russia, the [[Bolsheviks]] consolidated their power and sought to control and direct the social and economic affairs of the state and broader Russian society in order to safeguard against counterrevolutionary insurrection, foreign invasion and to promote socialist consciousness among the Russian population while simultaneously promoting economic development.<ref name=\"marxists1989\"/>\n\nThese ideas were adopted by Lenin in 1917 just prior to the October Revolution in Russia and published in ''[[The State and Revolution]]''. With the failure of the worldwide revolution, or at least European revolution, envisaged by Lenin and [[Leon Trotsky]], the [[Russian Civil War]] and finally Lenin's death, war measures that were deemed to be temporary such as forced requisition of food and the lack of democratic control became permanent and a tool to boost [[Joseph Stalin]]'s power, leading to the emergence of Marxism\u2013Leninism and [[Stalinism]] as well as the notion that [[Socialism in one country|socialism can be created and exist in a single state]].\n\nLenin argued that as socialism is replaced by communism, the state would \"[[Withering away of the state|wither away]]\"<ref>Lenin, Vladimir (1917). ''[[The State and Revolution]]''. p. 70. cf. \"Chapter V, The economic basis for the withering away of the state\".</ref> as strong centralized control progressively reduces as local communities gain more empowerment.

He regarded this structural paradox as the necessary preparation for and antithesis of the desired [[workers' state]] which he forecast would follow.\n\n=== Trotskyist theory of the state ===\n{{main|Trotskyism}}\nFollowing Stalin's consolidation of power in the [[Soviet Union]] and static centralization of political power, Trotsky condemned the Soviet government's policies for lacking widespread democratic participation on the part of the population and for suppressing [[Workers' self-management|workers' democratic participation]] in the management of the economy. Because these authoritarian political measures were inconsistent with the organizational precepts of socialism, Trotsky characterized the Soviet Union as a deformed workers' state that would not be able to effectively transition to socialism. Ostensibly socialist states where democracy is lacking, yet the economy is largely in the hands of the state, are termed by [[Orthodox Trotskyism|orthodox Trotskyist]] theories as [[Degenerated workers' state|degenerated]] or [[Deformed workers' state|deformed]] workers' states and not socialist states.<ref>Trotsky, Leon (1935).

They use the term [[state socialism]] in contrast with their own form of socialism which involves either [[collective ownership]] (in the form of [[worker cooperative]]s) or [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]] without [[Central planning|centralized state planning]]. Those libertarian socialists believe there is no need for a state in a socialist system because there would be no class to suppress and no need for an institution based on coercion and therefore regard the state being a remnant of capitalism.<ref name=\"Schumpeter\"/> Most also hold that [[statism]] is itself antithetical to true socialism, the goal of which is the eyes of libertarian socialists such as [[William Morris]], who wrote as follows in a ''Commonweal'' article: \"State Socialism? \u2014 I don't agree with it; in fact I think the two words contradict one another, and that it is the business of Socialism to destroy the State and put Free Society in its place\".<ref>William Morris (17 May 1890).

The Soviet Union proclaimed itself a socialist state and proclaimed its commitment to building a [[socialist economy]] in its [[1936 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1936 constitution]] and a subsequent [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]]. It was governed by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] as a single-party state ostensibly with a [[democratic centralism]] organization, with [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] remaining its [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|official guiding ideology]] until the [[Soviet Union dissolution|Soviet Union's dissolution]] on 26 December 1991. The political systems of these Marxist\u2013Leninist socialist states revolve around the central role of the party which holds ultimate authority. Internally, the [[communist party]] practices a form of democracy called [[democratic centralism]].<ref name=\"Furtak, Robert K. 1986\"/> During the [[22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1961, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] announced the completion of socialist construction and declared the optimistic goal of achieving [[Communism in 20 years|communism in twenty years]]. The [[Eastern Bloc]] was a political and economic bloc of [[Soviet satellite states|Soviet-aligned socialist states]] in Eastern and Central Europe which adhered to Marxism\u2013Leninism, Soviet-style [[Soviet Bloc politics|governance]] and [[Soviet-type economic planning|command economy]].\n\nThe [[People's Republic of China]] was founded on 1 October 1949 and proclaims itself to be a socialist state in its [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|1982 constitution]]. The [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] (North Korea) used to be a [[Marxist\u2013Leninist state]]. In 1972, the country adopted a new [[Constitution of North Korea|constitution]] which changed the official state ideology to ''[[Juche]]'' which is held to be a distinct Korean re-interpretation of the former ideology.<ref name=\"freemediaproductions.info\">{{cite web|url=http://www.freemediaproductions.info/Editorials/2009/08/30/juche-is-third-position-ideology-built-on-marx-not-marxist-leninism/|title=Juche is Third Position ideology built on Marx \u2013 Not Marxist-Leninism|publisher=Free Media Productions \u2013 Editorials|date=30 August 2009|accessdate=25 December 2015}}</ref> Similarly, direct references to [[communism]] in the [[Lao People's Democratic Republic]] are not included in its [[Constitution of Laos|founding documents]], although it gives direct power to the governing ruling party, the Marxist\u2013Leninist [[Lao People's Revolutionary Party]]. The preamble to the [[Constitution of Vietnam|constitution]] of the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] states that Vietnam only entered a transition stage between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]] after the country was [[Vietnamese reunification|re-unified]] under the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] in 1976.<ref>[http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/politics/constitution/ \"VN Embassy \u2013 Constitution of 1992\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709162321/http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/politics/constitution/|date=9 July 2011}} From the Preamble: \"On 2 July 1976, the National Assembly of reunified Vietnam decided to change the country's name to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam; the country entered a period of transition to socialism, strove for national construction, and unyieldingly defended its frontiers while fulfilling its internationalist duty.\"</ref>\n\nThe [[Constitution of Cuba|1992 constitution]] of the [[Republic of Cuba]] states that the role of the [[Communist Party of Cuba]] is to \"guide the common effort toward the goals and construction of socialism (and the progress toward a communist society)\".<ref>[http://www.cubanet.org/ref/dis/const_92_e.htm \"Constitution of the Republic of Cuba, 1992\"].

In most cases, these are constitutional references to the building of a socialist society and political principles that have little to no bearing on the structure and guidance of these country's [[machinery of government]] and [[economic system]]. The preamble to the 1976 [[Constitution of Portugal]] states that the Portuguese state has as one of its goals opening \"the way to socialist society\".<ref>The [http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/po00000_.html \"Preamble to the 1976 Constitution of Portugal\"] stated: \"The Constituent Assembly affirms the Portuguese people's decision to defend their national independence, safeguard the fundamental rights of citizens, establish the basic principles of democracy, secure the primacy of the rule of law in a democratic state, and open the way to socialist society.\"</ref> [[Algeria]], the [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]] have directly used the term socialist in their official constitution and name.

In the case of many Middle Eastern states, the term socialism was often used in reference to an [[Arab socialism|Arab socialist]]/[[Arab nationalism|nationalist]] philosophy adopted by specific regimes such as that of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and that of the various [[Ba'ath parties]]. Examples of countries directly using the term socialist in their names include the [[Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka]] and the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] while a number of countries make references to socialism in their constitutions, but not in their names. These include India<ref>The Preamble of the Constitution of India reads: \"We, the people of India, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic, republic [...]\". See [[Preamble to the Constitution of India]].</ref> and [[Portugal]]. In addition, countries like [[Belarus]], [[Colombia]], [[France]], [[Russia]] and [[Spain]] use the varied term social state, leaving a more ambiguous meaning. In the constitutions of Croatia, Hungary and Poland, direct condemnation is made to the respective past socialist regimes. The [[autonomous region]] of [[Rojava]] which operates under the principles of [[democratic confederalism]] has been described as a socialist state.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wall|first=Derek|url=http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-fe30-Rojava-a-beacon-of-hope-fighting-Isis|title=Rojava: a beacon of hope fighting Isis|newspaper=Morning Star|date=25 August 2014|accessdate=25 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105163107/http://morningstaronline.co.uk/a-fe30-Rojava-a-beacon-of-hope-fighting-Isis|archive-date=5 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Other uses ===\n{{social democracy sidebar}}\nDuring the [[post-war consensus]], [[nationalization]] of large industries was relatively widespread and it was not uncommon for commentators to describe some European countries as democratic socialist states seeking to move their countries toward a [[socialist economy]].<ref name=\"Dissident 1991\">Heilbroner, Robert L.

Marxists trace the formation of the contemporary form of the [[sovereign state]] to the emergence of capitalism as a dominant mode of production, with its organizational precepts and functions designed specifically to manage and regulate the affairs of a capitalist economy. Because this involves governance and laws passed in the interest of the [[bourgeoisie]] as a whole and because government officials either come from the bourgeoisie or are dependent upon their interests, Marx characterized the [[capitalist state]] as a [[dictatorship of the bourgeoisie]]. Extrapolating from this, Marx described a post-revolutionary government on the part of the working class or proletariat as a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] because the economic interests of the proletariat would have to guide state affairs and policy during a transitional state. Alluding further to the establishment of a socialist and communist economy where [[social ownership]] displaces [[private ownership]], and thus class distinctions on the basis of private property ownership are eliminated, the modern state would have no function and would gradually \"wither away\" or be transformed into a new form of governance.<ref>{{cite book|language=de|last=Engels|first=Friedrich|title=Die Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe|series=Karl Marx-Friedrich Engels: Welke|volume=20|editor=Institut f\u00fcr Marxismus-Leninismus bein ZK der SED|publisher=Dietz Verlag|location=Berlin|year=1962}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|language=de|last=Engels|first=Friedrich|title=Die Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe|series=Karl Marx-Friedrich Engels: Welke|volume=21|editor=Institut f\u00fcr Marxismus-Leninismus bein ZK der SED|publisher=Dietz Verlag|location=Berlin|year=1962}}</ref>\n\nInfluenced by the pre-Marxist [[utopian socialist]] philosopher [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], [[Friedrich Engels]] theorized the nature of the state would change during the transition to socialism.

The dictatorship of the proletariat would represent this transitional state and would involve working class interests dominating government policy in the same manner that capitalist class interests dominate government policy under capitalism (the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie). Engels argued that as socialism developed, the state would change in form and function.

''Selected Writings Of Eduard Bernstein, 1920\u20131921''. New Jersey: Humanities Press.</ref> Following Marx, [[revolutionary socialists]] instead take the view that the working class grows stronger through its battle for reforms (such as in Marx's time the ten-hours bill). In 1848, Marx and Engels wrote: {{quote|Now and then the workers are victorious, but only for a time. The real fruit of their battles lies, not in the immediate result, but in the ever expanding union of the workers. [...] [I]t ever rises up again, stronger, firmer, mightier.

Retrieved 30 December 2019.</ref>}}\n\nAccording to the [[orthodox Marxist]] conception, these battles eventually reach a point where a revolutionary movement arises. A revolutionary movement is required in the view of Marxists to sweep away the capitalist state and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie which must be abolished and replaced with a dictatorship of the proletariat in order to begin constructing a socialist society. In this view, only through revolution can a socialist state be established as written in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'': {{quote|In depicting the most general phases of the development of the proletariat, we traced the more or less veiled civil war, raging within existing society, up to the point where that war breaks out into open revolution, and where the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie lays the foundation for the sway of the proletariat.|Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels|''The Communist Manifesto''<ref name=\"auto\"/>}}\n\n=== Leninist theory of the state ===\n{{main|Leninism}}\nWhereas Marx, Engels and [[classical Marxist]] thinkers had little to say about the organization of the state in a socialist society, presuming the modern state to be specific to the capitalist mode of production, [[Vladimir Lenin]] pioneered the idea of a revolutionary state based on his theory of the revolutionary [[vanguard party]] and organizational principles of [[democratic centralism]]. Adapted to the conditions of semi-feudal Russia, Lenin's concept of the dictatorship of the proletariat involved a revolutionary vanguard party acting as representatives of the proletariat and its interests. According to Lenin's [[April Theses]], the goal of the revolution and vanguard party is not the introduction of socialism (it could only be established on a worldwide scale), but to bring production and the state under the control of the [[Soviet (council)|soviets]] of workers' deputies. Following the [[October Revolution]] in Russia, the [[Bolsheviks]] consolidated their power and sought to control and direct the social and economic affairs of the state and broader Russian society in order to safeguard against counterrevolutionary insurrection, foreign invasion and to promote socialist consciousness among the Russian population while simultaneously promoting economic development.<ref name=\"marxists1989\"/>\n\nThese ideas were adopted by Lenin in 1917 just prior to the October Revolution in Russia and published in ''[[The State and Revolution]]''. With the failure of the worldwide revolution, or at least European revolution, envisaged by Lenin and [[Leon Trotsky]], the [[Russian Civil War]] and finally Lenin's death, war measures that were deemed to be temporary such as forced requisition of food and the lack of democratic control became permanent and a tool to boost [[Joseph Stalin]]'s power, leading to the emergence of Marxism\u2013Leninism and [[Stalinism]] as well as the notion that [[Socialism in one country|socialism can be created and exist in a single state]].\n\nLenin argued that as socialism is replaced by communism, the state would \"[[Withering away of the state|wither away]]\"<ref>Lenin, Vladimir (1917). ''[[The State and Revolution]]''. p. 70. cf. \"Chapter V, The economic basis for the withering away of the state\".</ref> as strong centralized control progressively reduces as local communities gain more empowerment.

Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 371. {{ISBN|9780199585977}}.</ref> In this way, Lenin was thereby proposing a classically dynamic view of progressive social structure which during his own short period of governance emerged as a defensive and preliminary bureaucratic centralist stage. He regarded this structural paradox as the necessary preparation for and antithesis of the desired [[workers' state]] which he forecast would follow.\n\n=== Trotskyist theory of the state ===\n{{main|Trotskyism}}\nFollowing Stalin's consolidation of power in the [[Soviet Union]] and static centralization of political power, Trotsky condemned the Soviet government's policies for lacking widespread democratic participation on the part of the population and for suppressing [[Workers' self-management|workers' democratic participation]] in the management of the economy. Because these authoritarian political measures were inconsistent with the organizational precepts of socialism, Trotsky characterized the Soviet Union as a deformed workers' state that would not be able to effectively transition to socialism. Ostensibly socialist states where democracy is lacking, yet the economy is largely in the hands of the state, are termed by [[Orthodox Trotskyism|orthodox Trotskyist]] theories as [[Degenerated workers' state|degenerated]] or [[Deformed workers' state|deformed]] workers' states and not socialist states.<ref>Trotsky, Leon (1935).

They use the term [[state socialism]] in contrast with their own form of socialism which involves either [[collective ownership]] (in the form of [[worker cooperative]]s) or [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]] without [[Central planning|centralized state planning]]. Those libertarian socialists believe there is no need for a state in a socialist system because there would be no class to suppress and no need for an institution based on coercion and therefore regard the state being a remnant of capitalism.<ref name=\"Schumpeter\"/> Most also hold that [[statism]] is itself antithetical to true socialism, the goal of which is the eyes of libertarian socialists such as [[William Morris]], who wrote as follows in a ''Commonweal'' article: \"State Socialism? \u2014 I don't agree with it; in fact I think the two words contradict one another, and that it is the business of Socialism to destroy the State and put Free Society in its place\".<ref>William Morris (17 May 1890).

Libertarian communists, including [[Anarcho-communism|anarchists]], [[Council communism|councillists]], [[Left communism|leftists]] and [[Libertarian Marxism|Marxists]], also reject the concept of a socialist state for being antithetical to socialism, but they believe that socialism and communism can only be established through [[revolution]] and dissolving the existence of the state.

He is a strange, remote-controlled [[teddy bear]] who proclaims himself to be the headmaster of Hope's Peak Academy and initiates a life of mutual killing among the students. He has various copies of himself throughout the academy and will punish anyone that attempts to attack him or breaks the academy's rules.\n\nVisually, Monokuma is divided into two halves. Seen from the front his left half is a cute white teddy bear with black details and grey shading; his right half has black fur and adds red as a spot color applied to his eye\nto contribute to his sadistic appearance together with an evil smirk.\n\nThe identity of Monokuma's controller, as well as his motives for bringing the students together, are central to the mysteries that the students must investigate. It is revealed that Monokuma is actually a series of robots created by Monaca Towa for an army that Junko Enoshima used. In the first two games, Monokuma was used as a proxy for Junko in her trials; in ''Another Episode'', he is a series of different types of enemies; in ''Danganronpa 3'', he is under the control of Kazuo Tengan to force Ryota Mitarai into brainwashing the entire world for the sake of hope. He is the only returning character in ''Danganronpa V3'' as a part of the Ultimate Academy for Gifted Juveniles, now controlled by Tsumugi Shirogane and accompanied by the Monokuma Kubs.\n\n==''Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc''==\n<!-- The NIS America release uses \"Ultimate\" in place of \"Super High School Level\".

An ordinary high school student who was accepted to the academy by raffle. He has no spectacular talents, aside from his belief that he is a bit more optimistic than most people, and was given the title of {{nihongo|Ultimate Lucky Student|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e78\u904b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"K\u014dun\"|Super High School Level Good Luck}} due to winning the lottery. Ironically, he often falls prey to bad luck more often than not. It is revealed in a short story that Makoto's luck comes from the fact that his bad luck is so powerful that it cancels the good luck of anyone around him, to the point where he managed to get a fellow Lucky Student candidate eliminated just by standing near the mailman carrying her acceptance letter. However, it is also shown that though his good luck rarely manifests, it is immensely powerful in its own right, allowing outcomes that are nearly statistically impossible to occur, such as getting the Escape Switch from the item machine or surviving his near-execution. His talent also proves instrumental in undoing Junko's plans, as his bizarre luck completely throws off her analytical abilities. While having the tendency to panic or let his emotions get the better of him, he can remain focused under pressure and shows a keen logic when piecing together mysteries. He is instrumental in solving all of the murder mysteries, and foils Monokuma's plot, earning the title of {{nihongo|Ultimate Hope|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e0c\u671b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"Kib\u014d\"|Super High School Level Hope}}. He manages to escape from the academy alive and joins an organization called the Future Foundation, dedicated to rebuilding the world and fighting against Junko's legacy.\n\n:During the events of ''[[Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair|Danganronpa 2]]'', he and the other survivors attempt to rehabilitate some of the Remnants of Despair by placing them inside a virtual world which would rewrite their memories of being Ultimate Despair students. However, because of a virus containing Junko's Alter Ego, the world is turned into another killing game, prompting Makoto, Kyoko and Byakuya to eventually enter the virtual world themselves to help the surviving students activate a shutdown sequence to stop Junko once and for all. Makoto also appears in ''[[Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls|Danganronpa Another Episode]]''. He returns as the protagonist of ''[[Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School|Danganronpa 3]]'', where he becomes involved in Monokuma's Monokuma Hunter game. His forbidden action is \"running in the hallway.\" After surviving the Monokuma Hunter game, Makoto becomes the headmaster of the rebuilt Hope's Peak Academy.<ref name=\"anotherepappearance\">{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2014/08/19/danganronpa-another-episode-familiar-faces-murder-mystery-games/|title=Danganronpa: Another Episode Has Danganronpa 1's Hero, Makoto Naegi, In It - Siliconera|work=Siliconera|accessdate=2 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911230839/http://www.siliconera.com/2014/08/19/danganronpa-another-episode-familiar-faces-murder-mystery-games/|archive-date=2015-09-11|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n;{{nihongo|Kyoko Kirigiri|\u9727\u5207 \u97ff\u5b50|Kirigiri Ky\u014dko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u014dko Hikasa]]|[[Erika Harlacher]] (game), [[Caitlin Glass]] (anime)}}<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/ErikaHarlacher/status/357985813117665280|title=Erika Harlacher on Twitter|newspaper=Twitter|language=en|access-date=2017-01-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414012713/https://twitter.com/erikaharlacher/status/357985813117665280|archive-date=2016-04-14|url-status=live}}</ref>\n:The main heroine of the first game. Kyoko is a mysterious woman who seemingly has amnesia but also possesses a cool head and reasoning skills.

She always wears a pair of gloves, which is later revealed to be for hiding burns scars she received on her hands when she was younger.

It is soon revealed that she is actually the true mastermind behind the events of the game, who had erased the memories of all the students and put them in this death game. The one who was really killed was her twin sister, Mukuro Ikusaba. Her true personality is one that is constantly changing as she gets bored easily and thrives to drive people to despair. The strangeness of her true persona is also compounded by her having to play the role of Monokuma, who has a drastically different personality from her own, as well as the stress of running the Mutual Killing Game by herself without any kind of support.

When her plans are foiled by Makoto's dedication to never give up hope, she begins to revel in the ultimate form of despair and commits suicide by subjecting herself to a combination of the executions she inflicted on the other students.

However, with his investigative skills, he manages to help solve the murder mysteries, and even uncovers the truth behind Jabberwock Island being a simulated reality. He also discovers that he was originally part of the Reserve Course, a section of Hope's Peak Academy for students without Ultimate talents that was built to help save the school from its approaching bankruptcy through its exorbitant entry fees. Being heavily mocked and ridiculed for his lack of actual talent, combined with a bad incident involving Juzo Sakakura, led him to become a test subject in the Hope Cultivation Project. The experiment led to his memory and personality to be erased and replaced with one incorporating multiple Ultimate talents. Due to this combination of talents, Hajime's ability to empathize and take joy in the people around him was removed as well. Under his new persona Izuru Kamukura, the {{nihongo|Ultimate Hope|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e0c\u671b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"Kib\u014d\"|Super High School Level Hope}}, he grew bored with the world due to being unable to relate to anyone and was manipulated by Junko into being present at the prototype killing game, the killing of Hope's Peak Academy's student council, where the event was blamed on him to incite the events that destroyed human civilization. Despite learning of his past and Izuru, Hajime manages to think for himself and help the others delete Alter Ego Junko. He is one of the survivors that manages to escape to the real world, deciding to live on as Hajime and look for a way to try to restore those who had died within the virtual world. He is briefly seen during the epilogue of ''Danganronpa Another Episode'' as Izuru, ripping out parts of Kurokuma and Shirokuma before he is sent to Jabberwock Island. At the end of ''Danganronpa 3: Despair Arc'', it is revealed that Izuru, having never actually been part of Ultimate Despair, had been freed of Junko's manipulations by Chiaki's death which, when combined with being blamed for the prototype killing game, caused Izuru to enact a revenge scheme that would see Junko utterly erased from existence, which succeeds when Hajime deletes Alter Ego Junko. In ''Danganronpa 3: Hope Arc'',  Hajime is revealed to have retained his own memories and the talents he gained as Izuru and used them to revive everyone who died in the virtual world, managing to stop Ryota from using his hope video before taking him with everyone towards a new future. He and his friends then broadcast a video claiming responsibility for the final killing game, freeing the Future Foundation of suspicion.\n\n;{{nihongo|Chiaki Nanami|\u4e03\u6d77 \u5343\u79cb|Nanami Chiaki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Kana Hanazawa]]|[[Christine Marie Cabanos]]}}<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\"danganronpa3dubcast\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/ChristineMCVA/status/435879404586020864|title=Christine M.

She is a sleepy, laid-back student who is inexperienced in the ways of the world, but very skilled at video games. Along with Hajime, she becomes a central figure of the trials. She accidentally kills Nagito, falling into his trap which was meant to ensure her survival alone, but she thwarts his plans by confessing her identity and offering herself to be executed by getting crushed by a [[Tetris]] block in order to save the remaining students. It is learned during the graduation that she is actually an AI program designed to observe and protect the students during the Future Foundation's experiment. However, some of her consciousness remains, allowing her to help Hajime during his conflict.

Chiaki quickly befriended Hajime and was unanimously elected class representative after bringing video games to the class to help everyone bond. However, it was because of these traits that she was chosen to be executed by Junko in order to drive the rest of her class into becoming Remnants of Despair, forced to go through a dungeon filled with deadly traps before being skewered to death. It is her death that breaks Izuru free of Junko's control, causing the once-apathetic genius to begin planning his revenge.\n:Chiaki is the only student of Class 77-B who stays dead permanently, as she was physically killed by Junko, compared to the other victims who died within the simulation, fell into comas, and were subsequently revived by Hajime. The ending of ''Danganronpa 3'' shows Hajime finally bidding farewell to the AI version of Chiaki, as he embraces and chases his own future by joining Nagito and his other classmates.\n\n;{{nihongo|Nagito Komaeda|\u72db\u679d \u51ea\u6597|Komaeda Nagito}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Megumi Ogata]]|[[Bryce Papenbrook]]}}<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\"danganronpa3dubcast\" />\n:Nagito is a deliberate foil to the previous protagonist, Makoto. Like Makoto, Nagito is an optimistic, subservient student who was accepted to the academy by raffle and received the title of {{nihongo|Ultimate Lucky Student|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e78\u904b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"K\u014dun\"|Super High School Level Good Luck}}. Unlike Makoto, his title is more literal, as he experiences an extraordinary cycle of good and bad luck that ultimately works to his benefit when good or causes some sort of harm to him when bad. Initially thought to be a friendly, upbeat, somewhat meek young man, he is shown to be quite deranged in his pursuit of hope, believing it to be an absolute good that only his talented classmates can achieve. Because of his beliefs, he is completely willing to let his talented classmates walk over him, for he sees himself as inferior to them, all while keeping his cheerful, optimistic attitude and frequently referring to himself as a \"stepping stone for [their] hope.\" He remains cheerful and enthusiastic even in horrifying situations when someone has died, which results in his classmates fearing him and finding him creepy. He is highly unstable and suicidal, as the bad luck of his cycle causes catastrophes in his life that he believes are unavoidable; this is compounded by the fact that he has a degenerative brain disease that is slowly eating away at his ability to think rationally and which will soon kill him. He also feels deep self-loathing over his talent being, in his mind, lackluster compared to his classmates' talents. Despite his self-loathing, Nagito does still see himself as being superior to normal people, and has an intense hatred for the Reserve Course, seeing them as talentless parasites leeching off the academy. After learning that he and the other students (with the exception of Chiaki) are the members of Ultimate Despair who were responsible for the destruction of the world, he becomes aggressive and confrontational towards the others. In order to rid the island of the Ultimate Despair students, he sets up a trap for the others by setting up a scenario to looks like he committed suicide, while actually tricking Chiaki into inadvertently killing him with poison, hoping the end result will lead to the execution of all Ultimate Despair students and rescue Nanami alone. However, Hajime realizes what truly happened and Nanami takes responsibility for his death, saving the other students.\n:In ''Danganronpa Another Episode'', Nagito appears under the title of Servant (\u53ec\u4f7f\u3044 ''Meshitsukai''), serving under the Warriors of Hope who had captured him. The Warriors of Hope frequently abused him, though he took it all with a smile. It is later revealed that he was manipulating the Warriors of Hope, in order to allow Komaru to grow and defeat despair through her power of hope. Even though ''Danganronpa Another Episode'' took place during the 77th class's time as Ultimate Despair, Nagito was unique in that he still longed for hope, whereas the others were fighting for despair alone.\n:In ''Danganronpa 3'', Nagito appears with the rest of his classmates after having awoken from their comas to rescue Makoto. During the time skip between Nagito's death in the program and his appearance in ''Danganronpa 3'', he has changed his worldview and is no longer obsessed with talent or hope. He is also once again friendly with his other classmates, especially Hajime, although his fanboy-like tendencies remain, as seen in his excitement over finally meeting Makoto in person.\n\n;{{nihongo|Fuyuhiko Kuzuryu|\u4e5d\u982d\u9f8d \u51ac\u5f66|Kuzury\u016b Fuyuhiko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Daisuke Kishio]]|[[Derek Stephen Prince]] (game), [[Aaron Dismuke]] (anime)}}<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\"danganronpa3dubcast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.funimation.com/blog/2016/07/28/danganronpa-3-the-end-of-hopes-peak-high-school-broadcast-dub-cast-announcement/|title=Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School Broadcast Dub Cast Announcement|publisher=[[Funimation]].com|date=July 28, 2016|access-date=2016-07-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730004611/http://www.funimation.com/blog/2016/07/28/danganronpa-3-the-end-of-hopes-peak-high-school-broadcast-dub-cast-announcement/|archive-date=2016-07-30|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/steve.prince.5437/posts/10152212832069921|title=Steve Prince - Alright you Danga Rompa fans: Danga Rompa 2... {{!}} Facebook|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205224804/https://www.facebook.com/steve.prince.5437/posts/10152212832069921|archive-date=2016-02-05|url-status=live}}</ref>\n:A wary student who is the successor of the largest [[yakuza]] family in Japan.

In Chapter 6, it is revealed that Kaede's plan had actually failed to kill anyone, but that the Mastermind proceeded to kill Rantaro and have Kaede framed for the murder anyways. Prior to entering the game, much like everyone else, Kaede was an ordinary individual who willingly had her previous life's memories erased in order to compete on the killing show with a talent and fake background.

He does not get along with Kokichi, as Kokichi often teases Keebo due to his nature of not understanding jokes and sarcasm, and often ridicules his possibilities, which annoys Keebo to no end since he is a strong defender of robot rights and an opposer of robophobia. Throughout the game, he hears a voice in his head telling him what to do, and often listens to said voice. However, after his ahoge is destroyed in Chapter 5, he ponders the nature of hope and despair and notes the absence of the voice inside his head, subsequently going on a destructive rampage and leaving Shuichi and the remaining survivors with only until dawn to unearth the Mastermind of the killing game. Keebo is later revealed to be a creation of the Danganronpa reality show production team, with his past memories of Professor Iidabashi having all been lies. Keebo temporarily becomes the playable character in Chapter 6, before having his A.I. erased and replaced with the audience to vote on the fate of the killing game show at the end of the trial. Although he survives the final trial, he launches an attack on the school and self-destructs to destroy the dome surrounding the school and execute Tsumugi, effectively making him the final casualty of the game.\n\n;{{nihongo|Maki Harukawa|\u6625\u5ddd \u9b54\u59eb|Harukawa Maki}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Maaya Sakamoto]]}} (Japanese), [[Erica Mendez]] (English)<ref name=\":18\" /><ref name=\":19\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/tsunderica/status/881269561995087872|title=Got the okay to say that I'm Maki Harukawa in Danganronpa V3!

He has various copies of himself throughout the academy and will punish anyone that attempts to attack him or breaks the academy's rules.\n\nVisually, Monokuma is divided into two halves.

It is revealed that Monokuma is actually a series of robots created by Monaca Towa for an army that Junko Enoshima used. In the first two games, Monokuma was used as a proxy for Junko in her trials; in ''Another Episode'', he is a series of different types of enemies; in ''Danganronpa 3'', he is under the control of Kazuo Tengan to force Ryota Mitarai into brainwashing the entire world for the sake of hope.

It is revealed in a short story that Makoto's luck comes from the fact that his bad luck is so powerful that it cancels the good luck of anyone around him, to the point where he managed to get a fellow Lucky Student candidate eliminated just by standing near the mailman carrying her acceptance letter. However, it is also shown that though his good luck rarely manifests, it is immensely powerful in its own right, allowing outcomes that are nearly statistically impossible to occur, such as getting the Escape Switch from the item machine or surviving his near-execution. His talent also proves instrumental in undoing Junko's plans, as his bizarre luck completely throws off her analytical abilities. While having the tendency to panic or let his emotions get the better of him, he can remain focused under pressure and shows a keen logic when piecing together mysteries. He is instrumental in solving all of the murder mysteries, and foils Monokuma's plot, earning the title of {{nihongo|Ultimate Hope|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e0c\u671b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"Kib\u014d\"|Super High School Level Hope}}.

However, because of a virus containing Junko's Alter Ego, the world is turned into another killing game, prompting Makoto, Kyoko and Byakuya to eventually enter the virtual world themselves to help the surviving students activate a shutdown sequence to stop Junko once and for all. Makoto also appears in ''[[Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls|Danganronpa Another Episode]]''. He returns as the protagonist of ''[[Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School|Danganronpa 3]]'', where he becomes involved in Monokuma's Monokuma Hunter game.

It is soon revealed that she is actually the true mastermind behind the events of the game, who had erased the memories of all the students and put them in this death game. The one who was really killed was her twin sister, Mukuro Ikusaba. Her true personality is one that is constantly changing as she gets bored easily and thrives to drive people to despair. The strangeness of her true persona is also compounded by her having to play the role of Monokuma, who has a drastically different personality from her own, as well as the stress of running the Mutual Killing Game by herself without any kind of support.

When her plans are foiled by Makoto's dedication to never give up hope, she begins to revel in the ultimate form of despair and commits suicide by subjecting herself to a combination of the executions she inflicted on the other students.

However, with his investigative skills, he manages to help solve the murder mysteries, and even uncovers the truth behind Jabberwock Island being a simulated reality. He also discovers that he was originally part of the Reserve Course, a section of Hope's Peak Academy for students without Ultimate talents that was built to help save the school from its approaching bankruptcy through its exorbitant entry fees. Being heavily mocked and ridiculed for his lack of actual talent, combined with a bad incident involving Juzo Sakakura, led him to become a test subject in the Hope Cultivation Project. The experiment led to his memory and personality to be erased and replaced with one incorporating multiple Ultimate talents. Due to this combination of talents, Hajime's ability to empathize and take joy in the people around him was removed as well. Under his new persona Izuru Kamukura, the {{nihongo|Ultimate Hope|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e0c\u671b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"Kib\u014d\"|Super High School Level Hope}}, he grew bored with the world due to being unable to relate to anyone and was manipulated by Junko into being present at the prototype killing game, the killing of Hope's Peak Academy's student council, where the event was blamed on him to incite the events that destroyed human civilization. Despite learning of his past and Izuru, Hajime manages to think for himself and help the others delete Alter Ego Junko. He is one of the survivors that manages to escape to the real world, deciding to live on as Hajime and look for a way to try to restore those who had died within the virtual world. He is briefly seen during the epilogue of ''Danganronpa Another Episode'' as Izuru, ripping out parts of Kurokuma and Shirokuma before he is sent to Jabberwock Island. At the end of ''Danganronpa 3: Despair Arc'', it is revealed that Izuru, having never actually been part of Ultimate Despair, had been freed of Junko's manipulations by Chiaki's death which, when combined with being blamed for the prototype killing game, caused Izuru to enact a revenge scheme that would see Junko utterly erased from existence, which succeeds when Hajime deletes Alter Ego Junko. In ''Danganronpa 3: Hope Arc'',  Hajime is revealed to have retained his own memories and the talents he gained as Izuru and used them to revive everyone who died in the virtual world, managing to stop Ryota from using his hope video before taking him with everyone towards a new future. He and his friends then broadcast a video claiming responsibility for the final killing game, freeing the Future Foundation of suspicion.\n\n;{{nihongo|Chiaki Nanami|\u4e03\u6d77 \u5343\u79cb|Nanami Chiaki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Kana Hanazawa]]|[[Christine Marie Cabanos]]}}<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\"danganronpa3dubcast\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/ChristineMCVA/status/435879404586020864|title=Christine M.

She is a sleepy, laid-back student who is inexperienced in the ways of the world, but very skilled at video games. Along with Hajime, she becomes a central figure of the trials. She accidentally kills Nagito, falling into his trap which was meant to ensure her survival alone, but she thwarts his plans by confessing her identity and offering herself to be executed by getting crushed by a [[Tetris]] block in order to save the remaining students. It is learned during the graduation that she is actually an AI program designed to observe and protect the students during the Future Foundation's experiment. However, some of her consciousness remains, allowing her to help Hajime during his conflict.

Chiaki quickly befriended Hajime and was unanimously elected class representative after bringing video games to the class to help everyone bond. However, it was because of these traits that she was chosen to be executed by Junko in order to drive the rest of her class into becoming Remnants of Despair, forced to go through a dungeon filled with deadly traps before being skewered to death. It is her death that breaks Izuru free of Junko's control, causing the once-apathetic genius to begin planning his revenge.\n:Chiaki is the only student of Class 77-B who stays dead permanently, as she was physically killed by Junko, compared to the other victims who died within the simulation, fell into comas, and were subsequently revived by Hajime. The ending of ''Danganronpa 3'' shows Hajime finally bidding farewell to the AI version of Chiaki, as he embraces and chases his own future by joining Nagito and his other classmates.\n\n;{{nihongo|Nagito Komaeda|\u72db\u679d \u51ea\u6597|Komaeda Nagito}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Megumi Ogata]]|[[Bryce Papenbrook]]}}<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\"danganronpa3dubcast\" />\n:Nagito is a deliberate foil to the previous protagonist, Makoto. Like Makoto, Nagito is an optimistic, subservient student who was accepted to the academy by raffle and received the title of {{nihongo|Ultimate Lucky Student|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e78\u904b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"K\u014dun\"|Super High School Level Good Luck}}. Unlike Makoto, his title is more literal, as he experiences an extraordinary cycle of good and bad luck that ultimately works to his benefit when good or causes some sort of harm to him when bad. Initially thought to be a friendly, upbeat, somewhat meek young man, he is shown to be quite deranged in his pursuit of hope, believing it to be an absolute good that only his talented classmates can achieve. Because of his beliefs, he is completely willing to let his talented classmates walk over him, for he sees himself as inferior to them, all while keeping his cheerful, optimistic attitude and frequently referring to himself as a \"stepping stone for [their] hope.\" He remains cheerful and enthusiastic even in horrifying situations when someone has died, which results in his classmates fearing him and finding him creepy. He is highly unstable and suicidal, as the bad luck of his cycle causes catastrophes in his life that he believes are unavoidable; this is compounded by the fact that he has a degenerative brain disease that is slowly eating away at his ability to think rationally and which will soon kill him. He also feels deep self-loathing over his talent being, in his mind, lackluster compared to his classmates' talents. Despite his self-loathing, Nagito does still see himself as being superior to normal people, and has an intense hatred for the Reserve Course, seeing them as talentless parasites leeching off the academy. After learning that he and the other students (with the exception of Chiaki) are the members of Ultimate Despair who were responsible for the destruction of the world, he becomes aggressive and confrontational towards the others. In order to rid the island of the Ultimate Despair students, he sets up a trap for the others by setting up a scenario to looks like he committed suicide, while actually tricking Chiaki into inadvertently killing him with poison, hoping the end result will lead to the execution of all Ultimate Despair students and rescue Nanami alone. However, Hajime realizes what truly happened and Nanami takes responsibility for his death, saving the other students.\n:In ''Danganronpa Another Episode'', Nagito appears under the title of Servant (\u53ec\u4f7f\u3044 ''Meshitsukai''), serving under the Warriors of Hope who had captured him. The Warriors of Hope frequently abused him, though he took it all with a smile. It is later revealed that he was manipulating the Warriors of Hope, in order to allow Komaru to grow and defeat despair through her power of hope. Even though ''Danganronpa Another Episode'' took place during the 77th class's time as Ultimate Despair, Nagito was unique in that he still longed for hope, whereas the others were fighting for despair alone.\n:In ''Danganronpa 3'', Nagito appears with the rest of his classmates after having awoken from their comas to rescue Makoto. During the time skip between Nagito's death in the program and his appearance in ''Danganronpa 3'', he has changed his worldview and is no longer obsessed with talent or hope. He is also once again friendly with his other classmates, especially Hajime, although his fanboy-like tendencies remain, as seen in his excitement over finally meeting Makoto in person.\n\n;{{nihongo|Fuyuhiko Kuzuryu|\u4e5d\u982d\u9f8d \u51ac\u5f66|Kuzury\u016b Fuyuhiko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Daisuke Kishio]]|[[Derek Stephen Prince]] (game), [[Aaron Dismuke]] (anime)}}<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\"danganronpa3dubcast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.funimation.com/blog/2016/07/28/danganronpa-3-the-end-of-hopes-peak-high-school-broadcast-dub-cast-announcement/|title=Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School Broadcast Dub Cast Announcement|publisher=[[Funimation]].com|date=July 28, 2016|access-date=2016-07-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730004611/http://www.funimation.com/blog/2016/07/28/danganronpa-3-the-end-of-hopes-peak-high-school-broadcast-dub-cast-announcement/|archive-date=2016-07-30|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/steve.prince.5437/posts/10152212832069921|title=Steve Prince - Alright you Danga Rompa fans: Danga Rompa 2... {{!}} Facebook|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205224804/https://www.facebook.com/steve.prince.5437/posts/10152212832069921|archive-date=2016-02-05|url-status=live}}</ref>\n:A wary student who is the successor of the largest [[yakuza]] family in Japan.

He later survives the game alongside Maki and Himiko and resolves to discover whatever reality awaits him in the real world.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kaede Akamatsu|\u8d64\u677e \u6953|Akamatsu Kaede}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Sayaka Kanda]]}} (Japanese), [[Erika Harlacher]] (English)<ref name=\":18\" /><ref name=\":19\" /><ref>{{Citation|last=spikechunsoft|title=\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30c0\u30f3\u30ac\u30f3\u30ed\u30f3\u30d1V3\u3000\u8d64\u677e\u6953 \u5f79\u3000\u795e\u7530\u6c99\u4e5f\u52a0\u3055\u3093\u30b3\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc|date=2016-09-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKmflmHmAGA|accessdate=2017-01-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404222410/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKmflmHmAGA|archive-date=2017-04-04|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ErikaHarlacher/status/881287585833787392|title=Excited to announce that I play Kaede Akamatsu in Danganronpa v3  Come get autographs and see us on a panel tomorrow at AX!!!|last=Harlacher|first=Erika|website=@ErikaHarlacher|language=en|access-date=2017-12-06}}</ref>\n:The [[false protagonist]] of ''Danganronpa V3'' whose title is {{nihongo|\"Ultimate Pianist\"|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u30d4\u30a2\u30cb\u30b9\u30c8\u300d|Ch\u014d k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"Pianisuto\"}}.

While encouraging the other students to trust one another and work together, she strives to get them all out of the school, repeatedly reaffirming, \u201cOnce we get out, we\u2019ll all be friends.\u201d Kaede's desperation to end the killing game drives her to concoct a plan to murder the Mastermind, seemingly leading to the death of the innocent Rantaro and resulting in her execution by hanging. In Chapter 6, it is revealed that Kaede's plan had actually failed to kill anyone, but that the Mastermind proceeded to kill Rantaro and have Kaede framed for the murder anyways. Prior to entering the game, much like everyone else, Kaede was an ordinary individual who willingly had her previous life's memories erased in order to compete on the killing show with a talent and fake background.

He does not get along with Kokichi, as Kokichi often teases Keebo due to his nature of not understanding jokes and sarcasm, and often ridicules his possibilities, which annoys Keebo to no end since he is a strong defender of robot rights and an opposer of robophobia. Throughout the game, he hears a voice in his head telling him what to do, and often listens to said voice. However, after his ahoge is destroyed in Chapter 5, he ponders the nature of hope and despair and notes the absence of the voice inside his head, subsequently going on a destructive rampage and leaving Shuichi and the remaining survivors with only until dawn to unearth the Mastermind of the killing game. Keebo is later revealed to be a creation of the Danganronpa reality show production team, with his past memories of Professor Iidabashi having all been lies. Keebo temporarily becomes the playable character in Chapter 6, before having his A.I. erased and replaced with the audience to vote on the fate of the killing game show at the end of the trial. Although he survives the final trial, he launches an attack on the school and self-destructs to destroy the dome surrounding the school and execute Tsumugi, effectively making him the final casualty of the game.\n\n;{{nihongo|Maki Harukawa|\u6625\u5ddd \u9b54\u59eb|Harukawa Maki}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Maaya Sakamoto]]}} (Japanese), [[Erica Mendez]] (English)<ref name=\":18\" /><ref name=\":19\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/tsunderica/status/881269561995087872|title=Got the okay to say that I'm Maki Harukawa in Danganronpa V3!

The latter shows the birth of Bheeshma(Previously known as 'Devavrat', he was the eighth son of the Kuru King Shantanu and the river goddess Ganga) and his oath and birth of Pandavas and Kauravas. The story then focuses on the childhood of Lord Krishna and the death of [[Kansa]]. \n\nElsewhere, [[Dronacharya]] teaches Pandavas and Kauravas and asks to defeat [[Dhrupad(king of Panchal)]] as ''guru Dakshina''. Pandavas do so and give half of his kingdom to Drona. For revenge, Dhrupad obtains Dhrishthadhyumna and [[Draupadi]]. \n\nArjuna wins her in her ''swayamvara'' but the latter shows her marriage with all five Pandavas. Later, [[Yudhishthir]] is made the king of Indraprastha and Pandavas conduct ''Rajsuya Yagna'' where Draupadi insults [[Duryodhana]]. Latter, shows Duryodhana's revenge by trying to disrobe her and sending Pandavas along with Draupadi for an exile of 13 years. This sows the seed for the Mahabharata War. \n\n[[Indra]] in the disguise of a brahmin took Karna's armor and earrings. Krishna reveals Karna's true identity of being the eldest Pandava. \n\nBefore Mahabharata War, Shri Krishna enlightens Arjuna about [[Geeta]] and showed his ''Virata Swaroopa'' to Arjuna.  The latter shows the death of Bheeshma, Drona, Karna, 100 Kauravas in the war that lead to the victory of Pandavas over Kauravas. The show ends with Yudhistira's ''Rajyabhishek''.\n\n== Cast ==\n===Main===\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Nitish Bharadwaj]] as [[Shri Krishna]], Incarnation of Lord Vishnu/ Devaki-Vasudev's eighth son/ Foster

The latter shows the birth of [[Bheeshma]] and his oath and birth of Pandavas and Kauravas. The story then focuses on the childhood Lord Krishna and death of [[Kansa]]. \n\nElsewhere, [[Dronacharya]] teaches Pandavas and Kauravas and asks to defeat [[Dhrupad]] as ''guru dakshina''. Pandavas do so and gives half of his kingdom to Drona. For revenge, Dhrupad obtains Dhrishthadhyumna and [[Draupadi]]. \n\nArjuna wins her in her ''swayamvara'' but latter shows her marriage with all five Pandavas. Later, [[Yudhishthir]] is made the king of Indraprashta and Pandavas conduct ''Rajsuya Yagna'' where Draupadi insults [[Duryodhana]]. Latter, shows Duryodhana's revenge by trying to disrobe her and sending Pandavas along with Draupadi for an exile of 13 years. This sows the seed for the Mahabharata War. \n\n[[Indra]] in disguise of a brahmin took Karna's armour and earrings. Krishna reveals Karna's true identity of being the eldest Pandava. \n\nBefore Mahabharata War, Shri Krishna enlightens Arjuna about [[Geeta]] and showed his ''Virata Swaroopa'' to Arjuna.  The latter shows the death of Bheeshma, Drona, Karna, 100 Kauravas in the war that lead to the victory of Pandavas over Kauravas. The show ends with Yudhistira's ''Rajyabhishek''.\n\n== Cast ==\n===Main===\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Nitish Bharadwaj]] as [[Shri Krishna]], Incarnation of Lord Vishnu/ Devaki-Vasudev's eighth son/ Foster

The military operation resulted in the almost bloodless occupation of Portugal. The French and Spanish presence was challenged by the [[Portuguese people]] and by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] in 1808. The invasion marked the start of the [[Peninsular War]], part of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nThreatened by a humiliating ultimatum from [[Napoleon]], the Portuguese government acceded to most of the demands of the French emperor. Nevertheless, Napoleon ordered Junot to commence the invasion, with the cooperation of three divisions from the [[Kingdom of Spain]]. Paralyzed by fear and indecision, the Portuguese authorities offered no resistance. Junot occupied [[Lisbon]] on 30 November 1807 to find that Jo\u00e3o and many of the leading families had left for [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]] aboard the Portuguese fleet. The French quickly occupied the entire country and appropriated or disbanded the Portuguese army. The following year saw the Portuguese revolt against their occupiers. The next action was the [[Battle of \u00c9vora (1808)|Battle of \u00c9vora]] in July 1808.\n\n==Background==\nWhen the [[Treaties of Tilsit]] ended the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]], Emperor [[Napoleon]] of France had already expressed irritation that [[Portugal]] was open to trade with the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>Chandler (1966), 588</ref> Napoleon's ire was provoked because Portugal was Britain's oldest ally in Europe, Britain was finding new opportunities for trade with Portugal's colony in [[Brazil]], the [[Royal Navy]] often used [[Lisbon]]'s port in its operations against France, and he wished to seize Portugal's fleet. Furthermore, [[John VI of Portugal|Prince John of Braganza]], regent for his insane mother [[Maria I of Portugal|Queen Maria I]] had failed to comply with the emperor's [[Continental System]], a prohibition against British trade. In addition, the seizure of Portugal would fit neatly into Napoleon's future designs against Spain.<ref>Chandler (1966), 596</ref>\n\n[[File:Duroc.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|alt=Colored print of a clean-shaven man in a high-collared dark uniform coat with gold epaulettes and gold braid. He looks to the viewer's left.|G\u00e9raud Duroc]]\n\nOn 19 July 1807, Napoleon ordered his Portuguese ambassador to inform that country to close its ports to British shipping by 1 September. On 2 August the 1st Corps of the Gironde Army of Observation was officially brought into being, with [[General of Division]] [[Jean-Andoche Junot]] in command. Shortly afterward, the [[First French Empire]] placed all Portuguese shipping in its ports under embargo. On 23 September, the emperor made his intentions clear when he publicly threatened to depose the [[Braganza Dynasty|Braganzas]] in front of the Portuguese minister to [[France]].<ref>Chandler (1966), 597</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, on 12 August 1807 the French and Spanish ambassadors delivered their ultimata to the Prince Regent of Portugal. The notes required that John must declare war on Great Britain, put his fleet at France and Spain's disposal, seize all British trade in his ports, and put all British subjects under arrest. John agreed to suspend diplomatic relations with Britain and close his ports, but he shrank from seizing British merchants and their goods. This was deemed inadequate by Napoleon and the French and Spanish ambassadors requested their passports and left the country on 30 September.<ref name=Oman7>Oman (2010), I, 7</ref>\n\nOn 12 October, Junot's corps began crossing the [[Bidasoa]] River into Spain at [[Irun]].<ref name=Oman7/> Soon after this event, the secret [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1807)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]] was signed between France and Spain. The document was drawn up by Napoleon's marshal of the palace [[G\u00e9raud Duroc]] and {{ill|Eugenio Izquierdo|es}}, an agent for [[Manuel de Godoy, Prince of the Peace]].<ref name=Oman8>Oman (2010), I, 8</ref> The treaty proposed to carve up Portugal into three entities. [[Porto]] (Oporto) and the northern part was to become the [[Kingdom of Northern Lusitania]] under [[Charles Louis of Etruria]]. The southern portion would fall to Godoy as the Principality of the Algarves. The rump of the country, centered on Lisbon, was to be administered by the French.<ref>Oman (2010), I, 9</ref> It is probable that Napoleon never had any intention of carrying out the treaty's provisions. Aside from his desire to occupy Portugal, his real purpose may have been to introduce large French forces into Spain in order to facilitate its subsequent takeover.<ref>Oman (2010), I, 10</ref>\n\n==Forces==\n[[File:General Jean Andoche Junot.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|alt=Painting shows a man in a large bicorne hat and a dark blue uniform with his hands resting on a musket.|Jean-Andoche Junot as a young man in 1792]]\n\nJunot was selected because he had served as Portugal's ambassador in 1805. He was known as a good fighter and an active officer, but he possessed only ordinary talents as a strategist and a general. Napoleon promised his subordinate a dukedom and a [[Marshal's baton]] if his assignment was carried out with total success.<ref name=Oman8/>\n\nJunot's 24,918-man corps consisted of one cavalry division under General of Division [[Fran\u00e7ois \u00c9tienne de Kellermann]] and three infantry divisions under Generals of Division [[Henri Fran\u00e7ois Delaborde]], [[Louis Henri Loison]], and [[Jean-Pierre Travot]]. Junot's [[chief of staff]] was [[General of Brigade]] [[Paul Thi\u00e9bault]]. Kellermann's 1,754-strong division was made up of one squadron each of the 26th [[Chasseurs \u00e0 Cheval]] (244), 1st [[Dragoon]] (261), 3rd Dragoon (236), 4th Dragoon (262), 5th Dragoon (249), 9th Dragoon (257), and 15th Dragoon (245) Regiments. The cavalry was divided into two brigades under Generals of Brigade [[Pierre Margaron]] and [[Antoine Maurin]].<ref name=Oman612>Oman (2010), I, 612</ref>\n\n[[File:Kellermann, Francois Etienne.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|alt=Painting shows a head and shoulders view of a clean-shaven man with curly brown hair and long sideburns.

These were the 3rd Battalion of the 15th Line Infantry Regiment (1,033), the 2nd Battalion of the 47th Line (1,210), the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 70th Line (2,299), and the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 86th Line (2,116). Delaborde's brigades were led by Generals of Brigade [[Jean-Jacques Avril (general)|Jean-Jacques Avril]] and [[Antoine Fran\u00e7ois Brenier de Montmorand]]. Loison's 8,481-strong 2nd Division was made up of the 2nd Battalion of the 2nd Swiss Regiment (755) and the 3rd Battalions of the remaining six French units. These were the 2nd Light Infantry Regiment (1,255), 4th Light (1,196), 12th Light (1,302), 15th Light (1,314), 32nd Line (1,265), and 58th Line (1,394). Loison's brigadiers were Generals of Brigade [[Hugues Charlot]] and [[Jean Guillaume Barth\u00e9lemy Thomi\u00e8res]].<ref name=Oman612/>\n\nTravot's 5,538-man 3rd Division comprised the Hanoverian Legion (703) and seven French battalions. These were the 1st Battalion of the ''L\u00e9gion du Midi'' (797), the 3rd and 4th Battalions of the 66th Line Infantry Regiment (1,004), and the 3rd Battalions of the 31st Light (653), 32nd Light (983), 26th Line (537), and 82nd Line (861). Travot's two brigades were led by General of Brigade [[Louis Fuzier]] and [[Jean Fran\u00e7ois Graindorge]]. Artillerymen, sappers, train drivers, and other personnel numbered 1,297.<ref name=Oman612/> Out of the 30,000 men who eventually served in Junot's army, only about 17,000 were veterans.<ref>Gates (2002), 17</ref>\n\nAccording to the Treaty of Fontainebleau, Junot's invasion force was to be supported by 25,500 men in three Spanish columns. General Taranco and 6,500 troops were ordered to march from [[Vigo]] to seize Porto in the north. [[Captain General]] Solano would advance from [[Badajoz]] with 9,500 soldiers to capture [[Elvas Municipality|Elvas]] and its [[Elvas Castle|fortress]]. General Caraffa and 9,500 men were instructed to assemble at [[Salamanca]] and [[Ciudad Rodrigo]] and cooperate with Junot's main force.<ref name=Oman26>Oman (2010), I, 26</ref>\n\nIn 1807 the Portuguese infantry was organized into 27 regiments of which three were colonial. The remaining 24 were titled ''Lippe'', ''Albuquerque'', ''Minas'', ''1st Armada'', ''2nd Armada'', ''Cascaes'', ''Setubal'', ''Peniche'', ''1st Elvas'', ''2nd Elvas'', ''Serpa'', ''1st Oliven\u00e7a'', ''2nd Oliven\u00e7a'', ''Campo Major'', ''Castello de Vide'', ''Lagos'', ''Faro'', ''1st Oporto'', ''2nd Oporto'', ''Viana'', ''Valen\u00e7a'', ''Almeida'', ''Gena Major'', and ''Bragan\u00e7a''.<ref>Pivka (1979), 192</ref> There was an additional unit of light infantry known as the ''D'Alorna Legion''.<ref>Pivka (1979), 193</ref> The 12 regiments of Portuguese cavalry originally had [[cuirassier]] equipment. The regiments were named ''Ca\u00e9s'', ''Alcantara'', ''Mecklenburg'', ''Elvas'', ''\u00c9vora'', ''Moira'', ''Oliven\u00e7a'', ''Almeida'', ''Castello Branco'', ''Miranda'', ''Chaves'', and ''Bragan\u00e7a''. The ''D'Alorna Legion'' also had a cavalry contingent which was fitted out in [[hussar]] uniforms.<ref>Pivka (1979), 194\u2013195</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese army had been modernized in 1762 by [[William, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe]] but the army's administration soon became corrupt. Colonels and captains collected pay and supplies from the government for their soldiers. But the temptation to profit from this arrangement proved irresistible. The poorly paid officers often pocketed funds for soldiers who were on the muster rolls but absent or non-existent. [[Graft (politics)|Graft]] and [[embezzlement]] led to understrength units, cavalrymen without horses, and regimental depots without supplies.<ref>Oman (1995), II, 208\u2013210</ref>\n\nDuring the brief [[War of the Oranges]] in 1801 the weakness of the Portuguese army became manifest. In the wake of that conflict, each of the 24 line infantry regiments had a second battalion added. The number of companies per battalion was reduced from seven to five, but company strength was raised from 116 to 150 soldiers. The 12 regiments of line cavalry were each increased to 470 troopers and their cuirasses discarded. The number of 989-man artillery regiments was increased from three to four while ten fortress artillery companies were established. The Portuguese army's 48,396-man nominal strength included 36,000 line infantrymen, 5,640 line cavalrymen, 3,956 artillerists, 1,300 fortress gunners, and 1,500 legionnaires and engineers. But after 1801, the previous system of abuses continued so that the army may have numbered as few as 20,000 men in 1807.<ref>Oman (1995), II, 210</ref>\n\n==Invasion==\n[[File:DomJo\u00e3oVI-pintordesconhecido.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.6|alt=Painting of an overweight man with gray hair, bulging round eyes and a double-chin.

His left hand rests on a crown.|Prince Regent John]]\n\nOn 12 November 1807, Junot's corps entered Salamanca in western Spain after marching about {{convert|300|mi|km|0}} in 25 days. Unknown to their Spanish allies, the French engineers were secretly taking notes about all fortresses and strategic points on their line of march.<ref name=Oman26/> On that day, Junot received new orders urging him to hurry. The normal invasion route is a corridor {{convert|200|mi|km|0}} in length via [[Almeida, Portugal|Almeida]] and [[Coimbra]]. Instead, Junot was instructed to move west from [[Alc\u00e1ntara]] along the [[Tagus]] valley to Portugal, a distance of only {{convert|120|mi|km|0}}. Anxious that Britain might intervene in Portugal or that the Portuguese might resist, Napoleon decided to speed up the invasion timetable.<ref name=Oman27>Oman (2010), I, 27</ref>\n\nUnfortunately for Junot and his soldiers, the new route passed through an area with few inhabitants and very poor roads. Nevertheless, Napoleon declared, \"I will not have the march of the army delayed for a single day. 20,000 men can feed themselves anywhere, even in a desert.\" The march south from Ciudad Rodrigo to Alc\u00e1ntara via the [[Perales del Puerto|Perales Pass]] was accomplished in five days in the cold rain. On this rough road through hills and ravines, half of the army's horses died,<ref name=Oman27/> one-quarter of the soldiers straggled, and all but six artillery pieces were left behind. At Alc\u00e1ntara, Junot appropriated ammunition and provisions from the Spanish troops guarding the bridge across the Tagus.<ref name=Oman28>Oman (2010), I, 28</ref>\n\n[[File:Admiral Sir Sidney Smith (1764-1840) - Louis-Marie Autissier.png|thumb|left|upright=0.6|alt=Oval painting of a hatless man with curly hair and thick eyebrows.

As bad as the roads were on the Spanish side of the border, those in Portugal were worse. The road along the Tagus valley was a mere track through a rocky wilderness, with [[Castelo Branco, Portugal|Castelo Branco]] being the only substantial town in the area. Amid the continual rain, the advance guard limped into [[Abrantes Municipality|Abrantes]] on 23 November. The rear of the corps closed up on 26 November. By this time, the only guns with the column were four Spanish horse artillery pieces, while half of the soldiers were straggling or marauding.<ref name=Oman28>Oman (2010), I, 28</ref>\n\n[[File:Departure of H.R.H. the Prince Regent of Portugal for the Brazils (Campaigns of the British Army in Portugal, London, 1812) - Henry L'Ev\u00eaque, F.

At first, the Prince Regent had been convinced that Napoleon did not really want to depose him. As the emperor's hostile intentions became more clear, John declared war on the United Kingdom on 20 October and seized the few remaining British subjects on 8 November. Nevertheless, disturbing reports began to arrive in Lisbon of Junot's march across Spain. Despite these events, John's government failed to mobilize the Portuguese regular army or call out the [[militia]] to defend the realm. Soon after, Admiral [[Sidney Smith (Royal Navy officer)|Sidney Smith]] appeared off Lisbon with a British squadron and declared that the port was under blockade. The British were worried about the presence in Lisbon of a Russian squadron under Admiral [[Dmitry Senyavin]]<ref name=Oman29>Oman (2010), I, 29</ref> and alarmed that the Portuguese fleet in Lisbon might fall into Napoleon's hands, which would mean that 14 Ships of the line, 11 Frigates, and 7 smaller vessels would have joined the French Navy.<ref name=Oman30>Oman (2010), I, 30</ref>\n\nJunot was met at Abrantes by an emissary from the Prince Regent. Hoping to avert a French occupation, the diplomat offered to submit under various degrading terms. Understanding that the Portuguese were prostrate, Junot organized four battalions made up of his best remaining men and set out for Lisbon, which was still {{convert|75|mi|km|0}} away. Without a single cannon or cavalryman, 1,500 French troops staggered into Lisbon on 30 November, their cartridges soaked and their uniforms in tatters. There was no opposition.<ref name=Oman28/> It took ten days for all of Junot's infantry to arrive and even longer for his artillery to show up. His cavalrymen immediately began remounting themselves with horses seized from the local people.<ref name=Oman29/>\n\nThough the French occupied Lisbon without firing a shot, their quarry had escaped. As Junot's army loomed closer, the Prince Regent dithered between offering complete submission and fleeing to [[Brazil]]. Finally, Admiral Smith produced a 13 October edition of the Paris ''Moniteur'' which declared that the House of Braganza had been deposed. At this, John made up his mind to escape. He loaded his family, courtiers, state papers, and treasure aboard the fleet. He was joined in flight by many nobles, merchants, and others. With 15 warships and more than 20 transports, the fleet of refugees weighed anchor on 29 November and [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|set sail for the colony of Brazil]].<ref name=Oman30/> The flight had been so chaotic that 14 carts loaded with treasure were left behind on the docks.<ref>Chandler (1966), 599</ref>\n\n==Occupation==\n[[File:Francisco Goya - Portrait of the Duke of Wellington.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|alt=Painting shows a somber man with large round eyes. He wears a red military uniform with a large number of awards and decorations.|Arthur Wellesley]]\n\nSolano's Spanish column belatedly invaded Portugal on 2 December 1807 while Taranco occupied Porto on 13 December. The only resistance was offered by the governor of [[Valen\u00e7a Municipality, Portugal|Valen\u00e7a]], who refused to open his gates to the northern column. He only caved in when he found that Lisbon had fallen and the Prince Regent had fled. While the Portuguese civil authorities were generally subservient toward their occupiers, the common people were angry. When Junot raised the French flag on Lisbon's public buildings on 13 December, a riot broke out. Mounted troops were sent into the streets to disperse the mob with force. As one of his first acts, Junot disbanded the Portuguese army by discharging all its soldiers with less than one year and more than six years of service. The remainder were assigned to nine new units and most were marched to northern Germany to perform garrison duty.<ref name=Oman31>Oman (2010), I, 31</ref> Two Portuguese units were employed by the French in the 2 August 1808 assault during the [[First Siege of Zaragoza]]. They were 265 men of the 5th Infantry and 288 men of the Ca\u00e7adores.<ref>Oman (2010), I, 157</ref> The [[Portuguese Legion (Napoleonic Wars)|Portuguese Legion]] fought at the [[Battle of Wagram]] in July 1809 under the command of General Carc\u00f4me Lobo.

Few of these unlucky men survived the campaign.<ref name=Oman31/>\n\nJunot did his best to calm the situation by trying to keep his troops under control. However, his task was undercut by new orders from Napoleon. Junot was instructed to seize the property of the 15,000 persons who had fled to Brazil<ref name=Oman31/> and to levy a 100 million [[franc]] fine on the nation. As it happened, the refugees had carried off almost half of the specie in Portugal and the French were barely able to raise enough money to maintain the occupation army. Nevertheless, the harsh taxes caused bitter resentment among the population. By January 1808 there were executions of persons who resisted the exactions of the French. The situation was dangerous, but most of the country's leaders had gone to Brazil, leaving no one to lead an insurrection.<ref>Oman (2010), I, 32</ref>\n\nBy the following spring, the occupation army numbered 25,000 active soldiers, thanks to the approximately 4,000 reinforcements that arrived in early 1808. The situation changed after the Spanish [[Dos de Mayo Uprising]]. Junot soon found that all communications with Paris were cut off by the Spanish revolt.

The military operation resulted in the almost bloodless occupation of Portugal.  The French and Spanish presence was challenged by the [[Portuguese people]] and by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] in 1808.  The invasion marked the start of the [[Peninsular War]], part of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nThreatened by a humiliating ultimatum from [[Napoleon]], the Portuguese government acceded to most of the demands of the French emperor. Nevertheless, Napoleon ordered Junot to commence the invasion, with the cooperation of three divisions from the [[Kingdom of Spain]]. Paralyzed by fear and indecision, the Portuguese authorities offered no resistance. Junot occupied [[Lisbon]] on 30 November 1807 to find that Jo\u00e3o and many of the leading families had left for [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]] aboard the Portuguese fleet. The French quickly occupied the entire country and appropriated or disbanded the Portuguese army. The following year saw the Portuguese revolt against their occupiers. The next action was the [[Battle of \u00c9vora (1808)|Battle of \u00c9vora]] in July 1808.\n\n==Background==\nWhen the [[Treaties of Tilsit]] ended the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]], Emperor [[Napoleon]] of France had already expressed irritation that [[Portugal]] was open to trade with the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>Chandler (1966), 588</ref> Napoleon's ire was provoked because Portugal was Britain's oldest ally in Europe, Britain was finding new opportunities for trade with Portugal's colony in [[Brazil]], the [[Royal Navy]] often used [[Lisbon]]'s port in its operations against France, and he wished to seize Portugal's fleet. Furthermore, [[John VI of Portugal|Prince John of Braganza]], regent for his insane mother [[Maria I of Portugal|Queen Maria I]] had failed to comply with the emperor's [[Continental System]], a prohibition against British trade. In addition, the seizure of Portugal would fit neatly into Napoleon's future designs against Spain.<ref>Chandler (1966), 596</ref>\n\n[[File:Duroc.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|alt=Colored print of a clean-shaven man in a high-collared dark uniform coat with gold epaulettes and gold braid. He looks to the viewer's left.|G\u00e9raud Duroc]]\n\nOn 19 July 1807, Napoleon ordered his Portuguese ambassador to inform that country to close its ports to British shipping by 1 September. On 2 August the 1st Corps of the Gironde Army of Observation was officially brought into being, with [[General of Division]] [[Jean-Andoche Junot]] in command. Shortly afterward, the [[First French Empire]] placed all Portuguese shipping in its ports under embargo. On 23 September, the emperor made his intentions clear when he publicly threatened to depose the [[Braganza Dynasty|Braganzas]] in front of the Portuguese minister to [[France]].<ref>Chandler (1966), 597</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, on 12 August 1807 the French and Spanish ambassadors delivered their ultimata to the Prince Regent of Portugal. The notes required that John must declare war on Great Britain, put his fleet at France and Spain's disposal, seize all British trade in his ports, and put all British subjects under arrest. John agreed to suspend diplomatic relations with Britain and close his ports, but he shrank from seizing British merchants and their goods. This was deemed inadequate by Napoleon and the French and Spanish ambassadors requested their passports and left the country on 30 September.<ref name=Oman7>Oman (2010), I, 7</ref>\n\nOn 12 October, Junot's corps began crossing the [[Bidasoa]] River into Spain at [[Irun]].<ref name=Oman7/> Soon after this event, the secret [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1807)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]] was signed between France and Spain. The document was drawn up by Napoleon's marshal of the palace [[G\u00e9raud Duroc]] and {{ill|Eugenio Izquierdo|es}}, an agent for [[Manuel de Godoy, Prince of the Peace]].<ref name=Oman8>Oman (2010), I, 8</ref> The treaty proposed to carve up Portugal into three entities. [[Porto]] (Oporto) and the northern part was to become the [[Kingdom of Northern Lusitania]] under [[Charles Louis of Etruria]]. The southern portion would fall to Godoy as the Principality of the Algarves. The rump of the country, centered on Lisbon, was to be administered by the French.<ref>Oman (2010), I, 9</ref> It is probable that Napoleon never had any intention of carrying out the treaty's provisions. Aside from his desire to occupy Portugal, his real purpose may have been to introduce large French forces into Spain in order to facilitate its subsequent takeover.<ref>Oman (2010), I, 10</ref>\n\n==Forces==\n[[File:General Jean Andoche Junot.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|alt=Painting shows a man in a large bicorne hat and a dark blue uniform with his hands resting on a musket.|Jean-Andoche Junot as a young man in 1792]]\n\nJunot was selected because he had served as Portugal's ambassador in 1805. He was known as a good fighter and an active officer, but he possessed only ordinary talents as a strategist and a general. Napoleon promised his subordinate a dukedom and a [[Marshal's baton]] if his assignment was carried out with total success.<ref name=Oman8/>\n\nJunot's 24,918-man corps consisted of one cavalry division under General of Division [[Fran\u00e7ois \u00c9tienne de Kellermann]] and three infantry divisions under Generals of Division [[Henri Fran\u00e7ois Delaborde]], [[Louis Henri Loison]], and [[Jean-Pierre Travot]]. Junot's [[chief of staff]] was [[General of Brigade]] [[Paul Thi\u00e9bault]]. Kellermann's 1,754-strong division was made up of one squadron each of the 26th [[Chasseurs \u00e0 Cheval]] (244), 1st [[Dragoon]] (261), 3rd Dragoon (236), 4th Dragoon (262), 5th Dragoon (249), 9th Dragoon (257), and 15th Dragoon (245) Regiments. The cavalry was divided into two brigades under Generals of Brigade [[Pierre Margaron]] and [[Antoine Maurin]].<ref name=Oman612>Oman (2010), I, 612</ref>\n\n[[File:Kellermann, Francois Etienne.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|alt=Painting shows a head and shoulders view of a clean-shaven man with curly brown hair and long sideburns.

These were the 3rd Battalion of the 15th Line Infantry Regiment (1,033), the 2nd Battalion of the 47th Line (1,210), the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 70th Line (2,299), and the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 86th Line (2,116). Delaborde's brigades were led by Generals of Brigade [[Jean-Jacques Avril (general)|Jean-Jacques Avril]] and [[Antoine Fran\u00e7ois Brenier de Montmorand]]. Loison's 8,481-strong 2nd Division was made up of the 2nd Battalion of the 2nd Swiss Regiment (755) and the 3rd Battalions of the remaining six French units. These were the 2nd Light Infantry Regiment (1,255), 4th Light (1,196), 12th Light (1,302), 15th Light (1,314), 32nd Line (1,265), and 58th Line (1,394). Loison's brigadiers were Generals of Brigade [[Hugues Charlot]] and [[Jean Guillaume Barth\u00e9lemy Thomi\u00e8res]].<ref name=Oman612/>\n\nTravot's 5,538-man 3rd Division comprised the Hanoverian Legion (703) and seven French battalions. These were the 1st Battalion of the ''L\u00e9gion du Midi'' (797), the 3rd and 4th Battalions of the 66th Line Infantry Regiment (1,004), and the 3rd Battalions of the 31st Light (653), 32nd Light (983), 26th Line (537), and 82nd Line (861). Travot's two brigades were led by General of Brigade [[Louis Fuzier]] and [[Jean Fran\u00e7ois Graindorge]]. Artillerymen, sappers, train drivers, and other personnel numbered 1,297.<ref name=Oman612/> Out of the 30,000 men who eventually served in Junot's army, only about 17,000 were veterans.<ref>Gates (2002), 17</ref>\n\nAccording to the Treaty of Fontainebleau, Junot's invasion force was to be supported by 25,500 men in three Spanish columns. General Taranco and 6,500 troops were ordered to march from [[Vigo]] to seize Porto in the north. [[Captain General]] Solano would advance from [[Badajoz]] with 9,500 soldiers to capture [[Elvas Municipality|Elvas]] and its [[Elvas Castle|fortress]]. General Caraffa and 9,500 men were instructed to assemble at [[Salamanca]] and [[Ciudad Rodrigo]] and cooperate with Junot's main force.<ref name=Oman26>Oman (2010), I, 26</ref>\n\nIn 1807 the Portuguese infantry was organized into 27 regiments of which three were colonial. The remaining 24 were titled ''Lippe'', ''Albuquerque'', ''Minas'', ''1st Armada'', ''2nd Armada'', ''Cascaes'', ''Setubal'', ''Peniche'', ''1st Elvas'', ''2nd Elvas'', ''Serpa'', ''1st Oliven\u00e7a'', ''2nd Oliven\u00e7a'', ''Campo Major'', ''Castello de Vide'', ''Lagos'', ''Faro'', ''1st Oporto'', ''2nd Oporto'', ''Viana'', ''Valen\u00e7a'', ''Almeida'', ''Gena Major'', and ''Bragan\u00e7a''.<ref>Pivka (1979), 192</ref> There was an additional unit of light infantry known as the ''D'Alorna Legion''.<ref>Pivka (1979), 193</ref> The 12 regiments of Portuguese cavalry originally had [[cuirassier]] equipment. The regiments were named ''Ca\u00e9s'', ''Alcantara'', ''Mecklenburg'', ''Elvas'', ''\u00c9vora'', ''Moira'', ''Oliven\u00e7a'', ''Almeida'', ''Castello Branco'', ''Miranda'', ''Chaves'', and ''Bragan\u00e7a''. The ''D'Alorna Legion'' also had a cavalry contingent which was fitted out in [[hussar]] uniforms.<ref>Pivka (1979), 194\u2013195</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese army had been modernized in 1762 by [[William, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe]] but the army's administration soon became corrupt. Colonels and captains collected pay and supplies from the government for their soldiers. But the temptation to profit from this arrangement proved irresistible. The poorly paid officers often pocketed funds for soldiers who were on the muster rolls but absent or non-existent. [[Graft (politics)|Graft]] and [[embezzlement]] led to understrength units, cavalrymen without horses, and regimental depots without supplies.<ref>Oman (1995), II, 208\u2013210</ref>\n\nDuring the brief [[War of the Oranges]] in 1801 the weakness of the Portuguese army became manifest. In the wake of that conflict, each of the 24 line infantry regiments had a second battalion added. The number of companies per battalion was reduced from seven to five, but company strength was raised from 116 to 150 soldiers. The 12 regiments of line cavalry were each increased to 470 troopers and their cuirasses discarded. The number of 989-man artillery regiments was increased from three to four while ten fortress artillery companies were established. The Portuguese army's 48,396-man nominal strength included 36,000 line infantrymen, 5,640 line cavalrymen, 3,956 artillerists, 1,300 fortress gunners, and 1,500 legionnaires and engineers. But after 1801, the previous system of abuses continued so that the army may have numbered as few as 20,000 men in 1807.<ref>Oman (1995), II, 210</ref>\n\n==Invasion==\n[[File:DomJo\u00e3oVI-pintordesconhecido.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.6|alt=Painting of an overweight man with gray hair, bulging round eyes and a double-chin.

His left hand rests on a crown.|Prince Regent John]]\n\nOn 12 November 1807, Junot's corps entered Salamanca in western Spain after marching about {{convert|300|mi|km|0}} in 25 days. Unknown to their Spanish allies, the French engineers were secretly taking notes about all fortresses and strategic points on their line of march.<ref name=Oman26/> On that day, Junot received new orders urging him to hurry. The normal invasion route is a corridor {{convert|200|mi|km|0}} in length via [[Almeida, Portugal|Almeida]] and [[Coimbra]]. Instead, Junot was instructed to move west from [[Alc\u00e1ntara]] along the [[Tagus]] valley to Portugal, a distance of only {{convert|120|mi|km|0}}. Anxious that Britain might intervene in Portugal or that the Portuguese might resist, Napoleon decided to speed up the invasion timetable.<ref name=Oman27>Oman (2010), I, 27</ref>\n\nUnfortunately for Junot and his soldiers, the new route passed through an area with few inhabitants and very poor roads. Nevertheless, Napoleon declared, \"I will not have the march of the army delayed for a single day. 20,000 men can feed themselves anywhere, even in a desert.\" The march south from Ciudad Rodrigo to Alc\u00e1ntara via the [[Perales del Puerto|Perales Pass]] was accomplished in five days in the cold rain. On this rough road through hills and ravines, half of the army's horses died,<ref name=Oman27/> one-quarter of the soldiers straggled, and all but six artillery pieces were left behind. At Alc\u00e1ntara, Junot appropriated ammunition and provisions from the Spanish troops guarding the bridge across the Tagus.<ref name=Oman28>Oman (2010), I, 28</ref>\n\n[[File:Admiral Sir Sidney Smith (1764-1840) - Louis-Marie Autissier.png|thumb|left|upright=0.6|alt=Oval painting of a hatless man with curly hair and thick eyebrows.

As bad as the roads were on the Spanish side of the border, those in Portugal were worse. The road along the Tagus valley was a mere track through a rocky wilderness, with [[Castelo Branco, Portugal|Castelo Branco]] being the only substantial town in the area. Amid the continual rain, the advance guard limped into [[Abrantes Municipality|Abrantes]] on 23 November. The rear of the corps closed up on 26 November. By this time, the only guns with the column were four Spanish horse artillery pieces, while half of the soldiers were straggling or marauding.<ref name=Oman28>Oman (2010), I, 28</ref>\n\n[[File:Departure of H.R.H. the Prince Regent of Portugal for the Brazils (Campaigns of the British Army in Portugal, London, 1812) - Henry L'Ev\u00eaque, F.

At first, the Prince Regent had been convinced that Napoleon did not really want to depose him. As the emperor's hostile intentions became more clear, John declared war on the United Kingdom on 20 October and seized the few remaining British subjects on 8 November. Nevertheless, disturbing reports began to arrive in Lisbon of Junot's march across Spain. Despite these events, John's government failed to mobilize the Portuguese regular army or call out the [[militia]] to defend the realm. Soon after, Admiral [[Sidney Smith (Royal Navy officer)|Sidney Smith]] appeared off Lisbon with a British squadron and declared that the port was under blockade. The British were worried about the presence in Lisbon of a Russian squadron under Admiral [[Dmitry Senyavin]]<ref name=Oman29>Oman (2010), I, 29</ref> and alarmed that the Portuguese fleet in Lisbon might fall into Napoleon's hands, which would mean that 14 Ships of the line, 11 Frigates, and 7 smaller vessels would have joined the French Navy.<ref name=Oman30>Oman (2010), I, 30</ref>\n\nJunot was met at Abrantes by an emissary from the Prince Regent. Hoping to avert a French occupation, the diplomat offered to submit under various degrading terms. Understanding that the Portuguese were prostrate, Junot organized four battalions made up of his best remaining men and set out for Lisbon, which was still {{convert|75|mi|km|0}} away. Without a single cannon or cavalryman, 1,500 French troops staggered into Lisbon on 30 November, their cartridges soaked and their uniforms in tatters. There was no opposition.<ref name=Oman28/> It took ten days for all of Junot's infantry to arrive and even longer for his artillery to show up. His cavalrymen immediately began remounting themselves with horses seized from the local people.<ref name=Oman29/>\n\nThough the French occupied Lisbon without firing a shot, their quarry had escaped. As Junot's army loomed closer, the Prince Regent dithered between offering complete submission and fleeing to [[Brazil]]. Finally, Admiral Smith produced a 13 October edition of the Paris ''Moniteur'' which declared that the House of Braganza had been deposed. At this, John made up his mind to escape. He loaded his family, courtiers, state papers, and treasure aboard the fleet. He was joined in flight by many nobles, merchants, and others. With 15 warships and more than 20 transports, the fleet of refugees weighed anchor on 29 November and [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|set sail for the colony of Brazil]].<ref name=Oman30/> The flight had been so chaotic that 14 carts loaded with treasure were left behind on the docks.<ref>Chandler (1966), 599</ref>\n\n==Occupation==\n[[File:Francisco Goya - Portrait of the Duke of Wellington.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|alt=Painting shows a somber man with large round eyes. He wears a red military uniform with a large number of awards and decorations.|Arthur Wellesley]]\n\nSolano's Spanish column belatedly invaded Portugal on 2 December 1807 while Taranco occupied Porto on 13 December. The only resistance was offered by the governor of [[Valen\u00e7a Municipality, Portugal|Valen\u00e7a]], who refused to open his gates to the northern column. He only caved in when he found that Lisbon had fallen and the Prince Regent had fled. While the Portuguese civil authorities were generally subservient toward their occupiers, the common people were angry. When Junot raised the French flag on Lisbon's public buildings on 13 December, a riot broke out. Mounted troops were sent into the streets to disperse the mob with force. As one of his first acts, Junot disbanded the Portuguese army by discharging all its soldiers with less than one year and more than six years of service. The remainder were assigned to nine new units and most were marched to northern Germany to perform garrison duty.<ref name=Oman31>Oman (2010), I, 31</ref> Two Portuguese units were employed by the French in the 2 August 1808 assault during the [[First Siege of Zaragoza]]. They were 265 men of the 5th Infantry and 288 men of the Ca\u00e7adores.<ref>Oman (2010), I, 157</ref> The [[Portuguese Legion (Napoleonic Wars)|Portuguese Legion]] fought at the [[Battle of Wagram]] in July 1809 under the command of General Carc\u00f4me Lobo.

Few of these unlucky men survived the campaign.<ref name=Oman31/>\n\nJunot did his best to calm the situation by trying to keep his troops under control. However, his task was undercut by new orders from Napoleon. Junot was instructed to seize the property of the 15,000 persons who had fled to Brazil<ref name=Oman31/> and to levy a 100 million [[franc]] fine on the nation. As it happened, the refugees had carried off almost half of the specie in Portugal and the French were barely able to raise enough money to maintain the occupation army. Nevertheless, the harsh taxes caused bitter resentment among the population. By January 1808 there were executions of persons who resisted the exactions of the French. The situation was dangerous, but most of the country's leaders had gone to Brazil, leaving no one to lead an insurrection.<ref>Oman (2010), I, 32</ref>\n\nBy the following spring, the occupation army numbered 25,000 active soldiers, thanks to the approximately 4,000 reinforcements that arrived in early 1808. The situation changed after the Spanish [[Dos de Mayo Uprising]]. Junot soon found that all communications with Paris were cut off by the Spanish revolt. On 6 June 1808, news of the rebellion reached Porto where General [[Domingo Belest\u00e1|Belesta]] was stationed with 6,000 Spanish troops, Taranco having died during the winter.

The ferry departs from [[Takeshiba Pier]], near [[Hamamatsuch\u014d Station]], Tokyo at 22:30 and arrives at Miyakejima at 5:00. Depending on the wind and weather conditions, the ''Tachibana Maru'' will dock at one of three ports; Miike Port Pier (\u4e09\u6c60\u6e2f\u685f\u6a4b), T\u014dkai Kisen Igaya Port (\u6771\u6d77\u6c7d\u8239 \u4f0a\u30f6\u8c37), or Sabigahama Port (\u9306\u30f6\u6d5c\u6e2f). The port where the boat will dock is not predictable and changes on a daily basis. Generally, the boat will arrive at the port that is complimentary with the wind direction.<ref>https://www.tokaikisen.co.jp/en/</ref>  \n\nThere are flights connecting [[Miyakejima Airport]] and [[Haneda Airport]] with an approximate flying time of 50&nbsp;minutes. Flights are also operated from [[Chofu Airport]]. The area is prone to high volume of sulfuric gas and flights were suspended for almost eight years after the July 14, 2000 volcano eruption. Flights resumed during April 2008, after sulfuric gases in the air dropped to levels below 0.2ppm.<ref>[https://archive.is/20080426162442/http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/national/news/20080426-OYT1T00501.htm] </ref> There is a helicopter that arrives via [[Izu \u014cshima]]. There are also two helicopter flights operated by Tokyo Island Shuttle which originate in [[Aogashima]] and [[Izu \u014cshima]] and fly to [[Toshima Island|Toshima]], Miyake-jima, [[Mikura-jima]], [[Hachij\u014d-jima]] and [[Aogashima]].\n\nThere are two bus routes on the island. Both bus routes service the same stops, but one route goes clockwise and the other route goes counter-clockwise around the island. The time between each bus stop arrival can vary greatly from a few minutes to up to 3 hours.<ref>https://www.miyakejima.gr.jp/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/basjikokuhyou20180501.pdf</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Tokyo|Islands}}\n* [[List of volcanoes in Japan]]\n* [[List of islands of Japan]]\n* [[Izu Islands]]\n* [[Devil's Sea]]\n* [[Jack Moyer]] (1929-2004), former resident and marine biologist\n*[[Two Car]] (2017), an animated television series set in Miyake-jima\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* ''Teikoku's Complete Atlas of Japan'', Teikoku-Shoin., Ltd.

The mountain has been recorded to have erupted numerous times throughout history, and is mentioned as far back as [[Nara period]] written records. Over the past 500 years, it has erupted 13 times, including five times since the start of the [[Meiji period]]. A lava flow in 1940 killed 11&nbsp;people, and other eruptions occurred in 1962 and 1983.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/vwdocs/volc_images/north_asia/miyakejima/oyama.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-02-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050222084014/http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/vwdocs/volc_images/north_asia/miyakejima/oyama.html |archivedate=2005-02-22 }}</ref>\nOn July 14, 2000, Mount Oyama began another series of eruptions, and by September, the island was completely evacuated.  After a four-year period of volcanic emissions, residents were allowed to return permanently on February 1, 2005. After the eruption, there has been a constant flow of [[sulfur dioxide]] gas coming from Mount Oyama.\nThe residents of the island are required to carry [[gas mask]]s with them at all times{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}, but they do not need to be worn constantly.

Flights are also operated from [[Chofu Airport]]. The area is prone to high volume of sulfuric gas and flights were suspended for almost eight years after the July 14, 2000 volcano eruption. Flights resumed during April 2008, after sulfuric gases in the air dropped to levels below 0.2ppm.<ref>[https://archive.is/20080426162442/http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/national/news/20080426-OYT1T00501.htm] </ref> There is a helicopter that arrives via [[Izu \u014cshima]].
