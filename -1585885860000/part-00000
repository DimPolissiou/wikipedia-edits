The territory later called Masuria was then known as [[Galindia]] and was probably a peripheral, deeply forested and lightly populated area. Its inhabitants spoke a language now known as [[Old Prussian]] and had their own [[Prussian mythology|mythology]]. Although a 19th-century German political entity bore their name, they were not Germans. They were converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] in the 13th century, after [[Prussian Crusade|conquest]] by the [[Knights of the Teutonic Order]].\n\nEstimates range from about 170,000 to 220,000&nbsp;Old Prussians living in the whole of Prussia around 1200.<ref>Kossert, Andreas: Ostpreussen, page 28</ref> The wilderness was their natural barrier against attack by would-be invaders. During the [[Northern Crusades]] of the early 13th century, the Old Prussians used this wide forest as a brod zone of defence. They did so again against the Knights of the [[Teutonic Order]], who had been invited to Poland by [[Konrad I of Masovia]] in 1226.<ref name=\"britannica\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/589204/Teutonic-Order|title=Teutonic Order - religious order|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2018}}</ref>  The order's goal was to convert the native population to [[Christianity]] and baptise it by force if necessary.  In the subsequent conquest, which lasted over 50 years, the original population was partly  exterminated, particularly during the major Prussian rebellion of 1261\u201383.

In 1440 the anti-Teutonic [[Prussian Confederation]] was founded. In 1454 upon the Confederation's request King [[Casimir IV of Poland]] signed the act of incorporation of the entire region including Masuria to [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Poland]] and after the subsequent Thirteen Years' War Masuria came under the suzerainty of the Polish Crown, still ruled by the grand master of the Teutonic Order. Later assimilation of the German settlers as well as the Polish immigrants and native Prussian inhabitants created the new Prussian identity, although the subregional difference between the German- and Polish-speaking part remained.\n\n=== Ducal Prussia ===\n[[Image:\u015awi\u0119ta Lipka, Bazylika Nawiedzenia NMP.jpg|thumb|right|The [[\u015awi\u0119ta Lipka Sanctuary|Saint Mary's Sanctuary]] in [[\u015awi\u0119ta Lipka]] was consecrated by [[Jesuits]] in 1619.

The Knights untied their bonds to the Catholic Church and became land owning nobleman and the [[Duchy of Prussia]] was established as a vassal state of Poland. The [[Polish language]] predominated due to the many immigrants from [[Mazovia]], who additionally settled the southern parts of Ducal Prussia, till then virgin part of (later Masuria) in the 16th century. While the southern countryside was inhabited by these - meanwhile Protestant - Polish-speakers, who took refuge, the very small southern towns constituted German mixed with Polish-speaking population. The ancient [[Old Prussian language]] survived in parts of the countryside in the northern and central parts of Ducal Prussia until the early 18th century.

The territory later called Masuria was then known as [[Galindia]] and was probably a peripheral, deeply forested and lightly populated area. Its inhabitants spoke a language now known as [[Old Prussian]] and had their own [[Prussian mythology|mythology]]. Although a 19th-century German political entity bore their name, they were not Germans. They were converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] in the 13th century, after [[Prussian Crusade|conquest]] by the [[Knights of the Teutonic Order]].\n\nEstimates range from about 170,000 to 220,000&nbsp;Old Prussians living in the whole of Prussia around 1200.<ref>Kossert, Andreas: Ostpreussen, page 28</ref> The wilderness was their natural barrier against attack by would-be invaders. During the [[Northern Crusades]] of the early 13th century, the Old Prussians used this wide forest as a brod zone of defence. They did so again against the Knights of the [[Teutonic Order]], who had been invited to Poland by [[Konrad I of Masovia]] in 1226.<ref name=\"britannica\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/589204/Teutonic-Order|title=Teutonic Order - religious order|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2018}}</ref>  The order's goal was to convert the native population to [[Christianity]] and baptise it by force if necessary.  In the subsequent conquest, which lasted over 50 years, the original population was partly  exterminated, particularly during the major Prussian rebellion of 1261\u201383.

In 1440 the anti-Teutonic [[Prussian Confederation]] was founded. In 1454 upon the Confederation's request King [[Casimir IV of Poland]] signed the act of incorporation of the entire region including Masuria to [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Poland]] and after the subsequent Thirteen Years' War Masuria came under the suzerainty of the Polish Crown, still ruled by the grand master of the Teutonic Order. Later assimilation of the German settlers as well as the Polish immigrants and native Prussian inhabitants created the new Prussian identity, although the subregional difference between the German- and Polish-speaking part remained.\n\n=== Ducal Prussia ===\n[[Image:\u015awi\u0119ta Lipka, Bazylika Nawiedzenia NMP.jpg|thumb|right|The [[\u015awi\u0119ta Lipka Sancturary|Saint Mary's Sanctuary]] in [[\u015awi\u0119ta Lipka]] was consecrated by [[Jesuits]] in 1619.

The Knights untied their bonds to the Catholic Church and became land owning nobleman and the [[Duchy of Prussia]] was established as a vassal state of Poland. The [[Polish language]] predominated due to the many immigrants from [[Mazovia]], who additionally settled the southern parts of Ducal Prussia, till then virgin part of (later Masuria) in the 16th century. While the southern countryside was inhabited by these - meanwhile Protestant - Polish-speakers, who took refuge, the very small southern towns constituted German mixed with Polish-speaking population. The ancient [[Old Prussian language]] survived in parts of the countryside in the northern and central parts of Ducal Prussia until the early 18th century.

Masurians who expressed sympathy for Poland were deemed \"national traitors\" by German public opinion, especially after 1918 when the new Polish republic laid claims to, up to then German, areas inhabited by Polish speakers <ref name=Wang/> According to Stefan Berger, after 1871 the Masurians in the German Empire were seen in a view that while acknowledging their \"objective\" Polishness (in terms of culture and language) they felt \"subjectively\" German and thus should be tightly integrated into the German nation-state; Berger concludes that such arguments of German nationalists were aimed at integrating Mazurian (and Silesian) territory firmly into the German Reich.<ref name=Wang/>\n\nDuring the period of the German Empire, the Germanisation policies in Masuria became more widespread; children using Polish in playgrounds and classrooms were widely punished by corporal punishment, and authorities tried to appoint Protestant pastors who would use only German instead of bilinguality and this resulted in protests of local parishioners.<ref name=Wang/> According to Jerzy Mazurek the native Polish-speaking population, like in other areas with Polish inhabitants, faced discrimination of Polish language activities from Germanised local administration. In this climate a first resistance defending the rights of rural population was organized; according to Jerzy Mazurek usually by some teachers engaged in publishing Polish language newspapers.<ref>Kraj a emigracja: ruch ludowy wobec wychod\u017astwa ch\u0142opskiego do kraj\u00f3w Ameryki \u0141aci\u0144skiej (do 1939 roku) Jerzy Mazurek, page 281, Biblioteka Iberyjska, 2006</ref>\n\n[[File:K\u0119trzyn Widok og\u00f3lny miasta z ko\u015bcio\u0142em \u015aw.

In 1910, the German language was reported by German authorities as used by 197,060, Polish by 30,121 and Masurian by 171,413. Roman Catholics generally opted for the Polish language, Protestants appreciated Masurian. In 1925, German authorities reported 40,869 inhabitants as having declared Masurian as their native tongue and 2,297&nbsp; as Polish. However, the last result may have been a result of politics at the time, the desire of the population to be German after the trauma evoked by 1920 plebiscite. So the province could be presented as - so called - 'purely German'; in reality the Masurian dialect was among bilinguals still in use.<ref name=\"histclo.com\"/>\n\nThroughout [[industrialisation]] in the late 19th century about 10 percent of the Masurian populace emigrated to the [[Ruhr Area]], where about 180,000&nbsp;Masurians lived in 1914. [[Wattenscheid]], [[Wanne-Eickel|Wanne]] and [[Gelsenkirchen]] were the centers of Masurian emigration and Gelsenkirchen-[[Schalke]] was even called Klein (little)-[[Ortelsburg]] before 1914. Masurian newspapers like the ''Przyjaciel Ewangeliczny'' and the ''Gazeta Polska dla Ludu staropruskiego w Westfalii i na Mazurach'' but also the German language ''Altpreu\u00dfische Zeitung'' were published.<ref>Kossert, Andreas: Masuren, p. 219</ref>\n\n[[File:Arys Orzysz 011.jpg|thumb| Destructions of World War I at [[Orzysz|Arys]] (Orzysz)]]\n\nDuring [[World War I]], the [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Battle of Tannenberg]] and the [[First Battle of the Masurian Lakes|First]] and [[Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes]] between Imperial Germany and the [[Russian Empire]] took place within the borders of Masuria in 1914. After the war, the [[League of Nations]] held the [[East Prussian plebiscite]] on 11&nbsp;July 1920 to determine if the people of the southern districts of East Prussia wanted to remain within East Prussia or to join the [[Second Polish Republic]].

When it reached the area as planned, at 15:53 [[Eastern European Summer Time|local time]] (12:53&nbsp;UTC), [[Dnipropetrovsk]] Air Control (''Dnipro Control'') asked MH17 if they could climb to FL 350 as planned, and also to avoid a potential [[Conflict (air traffic control)|separation conflict]] with another flight, [[Singapore Airlines]] Flight 351 (SQ351), also at FL 330.

This request was also approved by ''Dnipro Control'' [[Air traffic control|ATC]].

At 16:19 local time (13:19 UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' noticed that the flight was {{convert|3.6|nmi|km}} north of the centreline of approved airway and instructed MH17 to return to the track. At 16:19 local time (13:19&nbsp;UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' contacted Russian ATC in [[Rostov-on-Don]] (''RND Control'') by telephone and requested clearance to transfer the flight to Russian [[airspace]]. After obtaining the permission, ''Dnipro Control'' attempted to contact MH17 for handing them off to ''RND Control'' at 16:20 local time (13:20&nbsp;UTC), but the aircraft did not respond.

The report concluded that the crash was caused by a [[Buk missile system|Buk 9M38-series surface-to-air missile]] with a 9N314M [[warhead]]. The warhead detonated outside and above the left-hand side of the cockpit. The impact killed the three people in the cockpit and caused structural damage to the airplane leading to an in-flight break-up resulting in a wreckage area of 50 square kilometres and loss of the lives of all 298 occupants.<ref name=\"DSB_Final_Report\"/> Based on evidence they were able to exclude meteor strikes, the airplane having technical defects, a bomb, and an air-to-air attack as causes of the crash.

When it reached the area as planned, at 15:53 [[Eastern European Summer Time|local time]] (12:53&nbsp;UTC), [[Dnipropetrovsk]] Air Control (''Dnipro Control'') asked MH17 if they could climb to FL 350 as planned, and also to avoid a potential [[Conflict (air traffic control)|separation conflict]] with another flight, [[Singapore Airlines]] Flight 351 (SQ351), also at FL 330.

This request was also approved by ''Dnipro Control'' [[Air traffic control|ATC]].

At 16:19 local time (13:19 UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' noticed that the flight was {{convert|3.6|nmi|km}} north of the centreline of approved airway and instructed MH17 to return to the track. At 16:19 local time (13:19&nbsp;UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' contacted Russian ATC in [[Rostov-on-Don]] (''RND Control'') by telephone and requested clearance to transfer the flight to Russian [[airspace]]. After obtaining the permission, ''Dnipro Control'' attempted to contact MH17 for handing them off to ''RND Control'' at 16:20 local time (13:20&nbsp;UTC), but the aircraft did not respond.

The report concluded that the crash was caused by a [[Buk missile system|Buk 9M38-series surface-to-air missile]] with a 9N314M [[warhead]]. The warhead detonated outside and above the left-hand side of the cockpit. The impact killed the three people in the cockpit and caused structural damage to the airplane leading to an in-flight break-up resulting in a wreckage area of 50 square kilometres and loss of the lives of all 298 occupants.<ref name=\"DSB_Final_Report\"/> Based on evidence they were able to exclude meteor strikes, the airplane having technical defects, a bomb, and an air-to-air attack as causes of the crash.

Having been the only [[Hollywood]] filmmaker to continue to make [[silent film]]s well into the period of [[sound film]]s, Chaplin made this his first true sound film.\n\nChaplin's film advanced a stirring condemnation of [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Benito Mussolini]], [[fascism]], [[antisemitism]], and the [[Nazism|Nazis]]. At the time of its first release, the United States was still formally at peace with [[Nazi Germany]]. Chaplin plays both leading roles: a ruthless fascist dictator and a persecuted Jewish barber.\n\n''The Great Dictator'' was popular with audiences, becoming Chaplin's most commercially successful film.<ref name=\"trampdict\"/> Modern critics have also praised it as an historically significant film and an important work of [[satire]], and in 1997, it was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\":0\"/> ''The Great Dictator'' was nominated for five [[Academy Awards]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Outstanding Production]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Writing (Original Screenplay)]], [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for [[Jack Oakie]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Music (Original Score)]].\n\nIn his 1964 autobiography, Chaplin stated that he could not have made the film if he had known about the true extent of the horrors of the [[Nazi concentration camps]] at the time.<ref name=\"ChaplinLager\">{{cite book |last=Chaplin|first=Charlie|authorlink=Charlie Chaplin|date=1964|title=My Autobiography|url=https://archive.org/details/myautobiography00chaprich|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/myautobiography00chaprich/page/392 392]|quote=Had I known of the actual horrors of the German concentration camps, I could not have made ''The Great Dictator'', I could not have made fun of the homicidal insanity of the Nazis.}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nOn the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in 1918, a Jewish Private ([[Charlie Chaplin]]) fighting for the [[Central Powers]] nation of Tomainia<ref>The spelling of the country's name is derived from the numerous local newspapers flashed onscreen between 14 and 15 minutes into the film that indicate the end of World War I, such as ''The Tomainian past', thus establishing the proper spelling.</ref> valiantly saves the life of a wounded pilot, Commander Schultz ([[Reginald Gardiner]]), who carries valuable documents that could secure a Tomainian victory. However, their plane crashes mid-flight, and the Private subsequently suffers memory loss. Upon being rescued, Schultz is informed that Tomainia has officially surrendered to the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Forces]], while the Private is carried off to a hospital.\n\n[[File:Dictator charlie2.jpg|thumb|left|Chaplin as Adenoid Hynkel.]]\nTwenty years later, still suffering from amnesia, the Private leaves the hospital to return to his previous profession as a [[barber]] in the [[Jewish ghettos in Europe|ghetto]]. The ghetto is now governed by Schultz, who has been promoted in the Tomainian regime under the ruthless dictator Adenoid Hynkel (also Chaplin).\n\nThe Barber falls in love with a neighbor, Hannah ([[Paulette Goddard]]), and together they try to resist persecution by military forces. The troops capture the Barber and are about to hang him, but Schultz recognizes him and restrains them. By recognizing him, and reminding him of World War I, Schultz helps the Barber regain his memory.\n\nMeanwhile, Hynkel tries to finance his ever-growing military forces by borrowing money from a Jewish banker called Hermann Epstein, but the banker refuses to lend him the money. Furious, Hynkel orders a purge of the Jews. Schultz protests this inhumane policy and is sent to a [[Internment|concentration camp]]. He escapes and hides in the ghetto with the Barber. Schultz tries to persuade the Jewish family to assassinate Hynkel in a [[suicide attack]], but they are dissuaded by Hannah. Troops search the ghetto, arrest Schultz and the Barber, and send both to a concentration camp. Hannah and her family flee to freedom at a vineyard in the neighboring country of Osterlich.\n\nHynkel has a dispute with the dictator of the nation of Bacteria, a man named Benzino Napaloni ([[Jack Oakie]]), over which country should invade Osterlich. The two dictators argue over a treaty to govern the invasion, while dining together at an elaborate buffet, which happens to provide a jar of \"English Mustard\". The quarrel becomes heated and descends into a food fight, which is only resolved when both men eat the hot mustard and are shocked into cooperating. After signing the treaty with Napaloni, Hynkel orders the invasion of Osterlich. Hannah and her family are trapped by the invading force and beaten by a squad of arriving soldiers. The squad leader strikes Hannah to the ground, stands over her, and cruelly eats her basket of grapes.\n\n[[File:Dictator charlie6.jpg|thumb|right|Chaplin as Adenoid Hynkel with [[Jack Oakie]] as Benzino Napaloni.]]\nEscaping from the camp in stolen uniforms, Schultz and the Barber, dressed as Hynkel, arrive at the Osterlich frontier, where a huge victory-parade is waiting to be addressed by Hynkel. The real Hynkel is mistaken for the Barber while out [[Waterfowl hunting|duck hunting]] in civilian clothes and is knocked out and taken to the camp. Schultz tells the Barber to go to the platform and impersonate Hynkel, as the only way to save their lives once they reach Osterlich's capital. The Barber has never given a public speech in his life, but he has no other choice.\n\nThe terrified Barber mounts the steps but is inspired to seize the initiative. Announcing that he (as Hynkel) has had a change of heart, he makes an impassioned plea for brotherhood and goodwill.\n\n<blockquote>\"I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible. Jew\u2014Gentile\u2014Black Man, White. We all want to help one another, human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness. Not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. And this world has room for everyone, and the good Earth is rich can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives us abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much, and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities life will be violent, and all will be lost. The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men\u2014cries out for universal brotherhood\u2014for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world\u2014millions of despairing men, women, and little children\u2014victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me, I say\u2014do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed\u2014the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish. ...\n\nSoldiers!-don't give yourselves to brutes\u2014men who despise you\u2014enslave you\u2014who regiment your lives\u2014tell you what to do\u2014what to think and what to feel! Who drill you\u2014diet you\u2014treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men\u2014machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don't hate! Only the unloved hate\u2014the unloved and the unnatural!\n\nSoldiers!-Don't fight for slavery! Fight for liberty! In the 17th Chapter of [[Gospel of Luke|St Luke]] it is written: \"the Kingdom of God is within man\"\u2014not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people have the power\u2014the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then\u2014in the name of democracy\u2014let us use that power\u2014let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world\u2014a decent world that will give men a chance to work\u2014that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfill that promise. They never will! Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people!

Willson's task was to re-record it with the full studio orchestra, fitting the music to the action.

How can the master's music simultaneously signify a desire for lost emotional integrity and for authoritative grandeur?\n\nChaplin's dual use of ''Lohengrin'' points towards unsettling conjunctions of Nazi culture and Hollywood entertainment. Like [[Adorno]], Chaplin understands Wagner as a signifier of both: the birth of [[fascism]] out of the spirit of the total work of art, and the origin of mass culture out of the spirit of the most arduous aesthetic program of the 19th century. Unlike Adorno [who identifies American mass culture and fascist spectacle], Chaplin wants his audience to make crucial distinctions between competing Wagnerianisms...Both...rely on the driving force of utopian desires, on...the promise of self-transcendence and authentic collectivity, but they channel these mythic longings in fundamentally different directions.

Having been the only [[Hollywood]] filmmaker to continue to make [[silent film]]s well into the period of [[sound film]]s, Chaplin made this his first true sound film.\n\nChaplin's film advanced a stirring condemnation of [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Benito Mussolini]], [[fascism]], [[antisemitism]], and the [[Nazism|Nazis]]. At the time of its first release, the United States was still formally at peace with [[Nazi Germany]]. Chaplin plays both leading roles: a ruthless fascist dictator and a persecuted Jewish barber.\n\n''The Great Dictator'' was popular with audiences, becoming Chaplin's most commercially successful film.<ref name=\"trampdict\"/> Modern critics have also praised it as an historically significant film and an important work of [[satire]], and in 1997, it was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\":0\"/> ''The Great Dictator'' was nominated for five [[Academy Awards]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Outstanding Production]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Writing (Original Screenplay)]], [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for [[Jack Oakie]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Music (Original Score)]].\n\nIn his 1964 autobiography, Chaplin stated that he could not have made the film if he had known about the true extent of the horrors of the [[Nazi concentration camps]] at the time.<ref name=\"ChaplinLager\">{{cite book |last=Chaplin|first=Charlie|authorlink=Charlie Chaplin|date=1964|title=My Autobiography|url=https://archive.org/details/myautobiography00chaprich|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/myautobiography00chaprich/page/392 392]|quote=Had I known of the actual horrors of the German concentration camps, I could not have made ''The Great Dictator'', I could not have made fun of the homicidal insanity of the Nazis.}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nOn the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in 1918, a Jewish Private ([[Charlie Chaplin]]) fighting for the [[Central Powers]] nation of Tomainia<ref>The spelling of the country's name is derived from the numerous local newspapers flashed onscreen between 14 and 15 minutes into the film that indicate the end of World War I, such as ''The Tomainian past', thus establishing the proper spelling.</ref> valiantly saves the life of a wounded pilot, Commander Schultz ([[Reginald Gardiner]]), who carries valuable documents that could secure a Tomainian victory. However, their plane crashes mid-flight, and the Private subsequently suffers memory loss. Upon being rescued, Schultz is informed that Tomainia has officially surrendered to the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Forces]], while the Private is carried off to a hospital.\n\n[[File:Dictator charlie2.jpg|thumb|left|Chaplin as Adenoid Hynkel.]]\nTwenty years later, still suffering from amnesia, the Private leaves the hospital to return to his previous profession as a [[barber]] in the [[Jewish ghettos in Europe|ghetto]]. The ghetto is now governed by Schultz, who has been promoted in the Tomainian regime under the ruthless dictator Adenoid Hynkel (also Chaplin).\n\nThe Barber falls in love with a neighbor, Hannah ([[Paulette Goddard]]), and together they try to resist persecution by military forces. The troops capture the Barber and are about to hang him, but Schultz recognizes him and restrains them. By recognizing him, and reminding him of World War I, Schultz helps the Barber regain his memory.\n\nMeanwhile, Hynkel tries to finance his ever-growing military forces by borrowing money from a Jewish banker called Hermann Epstein, but the banker refuses to lend him the money. Furious, Hynkel orders a purge of the Jews. Schultz protests this inhumane policy and is sent to a [[Internment|concentration camp]]. He escapes and hides in the ghetto with the Barber. Schultz tries to persuade the Jewish family to assassinate Hynkel in a [[suicide attack]], but they are dissuaded by Hannah. Troops search the ghetto, arrest Schultz and the Barber, and send both to a concentration camp. Hannah and her family flee to freedom at a vineyard in the neighboring country of Osterlich.\n\nHynkel has a dispute with the dictator of the nation of Bacteria, a man named Benzino Napaloni ([[Jack Oakie]]), over which country should invade Osterlich. The two dictators argue over a treaty to govern the invasion, while dining together at an elaborate buffet, which happens to provide a jar of \"English Mustard\". The quarrel becomes heated and descends into a food fight, which is only resolved when both men eat the hot mustard and are shocked into cooperating. After signing the treaty with Napaloni, Hynkel orders the invasion of Osterlich. Hannah and her family are trapped by the invading force and beaten by a squad of arriving soldiers. The squad leader strikes Hannah to the ground, stands over her, and cruelly eats her basket of grapes.\n\n[[File:Dictator charlie6.jpg|thumb|right|Chaplin as Adenoid Hynkel with [[Jack Oakie]] as Benzino Napaloni.]]\nEscaping from the camp in stolen uniforms, Schultz and the Barber, dressed as Hynkel, arrive at the Osterlich frontier, where a huge victory-parade is waiting to be addressed by Hynkel. The real Hynkel is mistaken for the Barber while out [[Waterfowl hunting|duck hunting]] in civilian clothes and is knocked out and taken to the camp. Schultz tells the Barber to go to the platform and impersonate Hynkel, as the only way to save their lives once they reach Osterlich's capital. The Barber has never given a public speech in his life, but he has no other choice.\n\nThe terrified Barber mounts the steps but is inspired to seize the initiative. Announcing that he (as Hynkel) has had a change of heart, he makes an impassioned plea for brotherhood and goodwill.\n\n<blockquote>\"I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible. Jew\u2014Gentile\u2014Black Man, White. We all want to help one another, human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness. Not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. And this world has room for everyone, and the good Earth is rich can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives us abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much, and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities life will be violent, and all will be lost. The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men\u2014cries out for universal brotherhood\u2014for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world\u2014millions of despairing men, women, and little children\u2014victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me, I say\u2014do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed\u2014the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish. ...\n\nSoldiers!-don't give yourselves to brutes\u2014men who despise you\u2014enslave you\u2014who regiment your lives\u2014tell you what to do\u2014what to think and what to feel!

You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don't hate! Only the unloved hate\u2014the unloved and the unnatural!\n\nSoldiers!-Don't fight for slavery! Fight for liberty! In the 17th Chapter of [[Gospel of Luke|St Luke]] it is written: \"the Kingdom of God is within man\"\u2014not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people have the power\u2014the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then\u2014in the name of democracy\u2014let us use that power\u2014let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world\u2014a decent world that will give men a chance to work\u2014that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfill that promise. They never will! Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people! Now let us fight to fulfill that promise! Let us fight to free the world\u2014to do away with national barriers\u2014to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness.\n\nSoldiers! In the name of democracy, let us all unite!\"</blockquote>\n\nFinally, he addresses a message of hope to Hannah, in case she can hear him.\n\n<blockquote>\"Look up, Hannah.

Filmmaker [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]] reports that Clair was horrified by the power of the film, crying out that this should never be shown or the West was lost. Chaplin, on the other hand, laughed uproariously at the film. He used it to inspire many elements of ''The Great Dictator'', and by repeatedly viewing this film, Chaplin could closely mimic Hitler's mannerisms.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/films/27605-the-great-dictator|title=The Great Dictator|website=The Criterion Collection}}</ref>\n\nTrimborn suggests that Chaplin decided to proceed with making ''The Great Dictator'' after viewing Riefenstahl's film.<ref>{{cite book |title=Leni Riefenstahl: A Life |last=Trimborn |first=J\u00fcrgen |year=2007 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-374-18493-3 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/leniriefenstahll00trim/page/123 123\u2013124] |url=https://archive.org/details/leniriefenstahll00trim/page/123 |accessdate= }}</ref> Hynkel's rally speech near the beginning of the film, delivered in German-sounding [[gibberish]], is a caricature of Hitler's oratory style, which Chaplin also studied carefully in newsreels.<ref>R.

Chaplin and [[Meredith Willson]] composed the music. Filming began in September 1939 (coincidentally soon after Germany invaded Poland, triggering World War II) and finished six months later.\n\nChaplin wanted to address the escalating violence and repression of Jews by the Nazis throughout the late 1930s, the magnitude of which was conveyed to him personally by his European Jewish friends and fellow artists. The [[Third Reich]]'s repressive nature and [[militarist]] tendencies were well-known at the time. [[Ernst Lubitsch]]'s 1942 ''[[To Be or Not to Be (1942 film)|To Be or Not To Be]]'' dealt with similar themes, and also used a mistaken-identity Hitler figure. But Chaplin later said that he would not have made the film had he known of the true extent of the Nazis' crimes.<ref name=\"trampdict\">[[Branagh, Kenneth]] (Narrator).

How can the master's music simultaneously signify a desire for lost emotional integrity and for authoritative grandeur?\n\nChaplin's dual use of ''Lohengrin'' points towards unsettling conjunctions of Nazi culture and Hollywood entertainment. Like [[Adorno]], Chaplin understands Wagner as a signifier of both: the birth of [[fascism]] out of the spirit of the total work of art, and the origin of mass culture out of the spirit of the most arduous aesthetic program of the 19th century. Unlike Adorno [who identifies American mass culture and fascist spectacle], Chaplin wants his audience to make crucial distinctions between competing Wagnerianisms...Both...rely on the driving force of utopian desires, on...the promise of self-transcendence and authentic collectivity, but they channel these mythic longings in fundamentally different directions. Although [Chaplin] exposes the puzzling modernity of Nazi politics, Chaplin is unwilling to write off either Wagner or industrial culture.

He was the husband of [[Nadezhda Mandelstam]] and one of the foremost members of the [[Acmeist poetry|Acmeist]] school of poets. He was arrested by [[Joseph Stalin]]'s government during the repression of the 1930s and sent into internal exile with his wife.\n\nGiven a reprieve of sorts, they moved to [[Voronezh]] in southwestern Russia. In 1938 Mandelstam was arrested again and sentenced to five years in a corrective-labour camp in the Soviet [[Far East]]. He died that year at a transit camp near Vladivostok.\n\n==Life and work==\nMandelstam was born in [[Warsaw]], [[Congress Poland]], [[Russian Empire]] to a wealthy [[Polish-Jewish]] family. His father, a leather merchant by trade, was able to receive a dispensation freeing the family from the [[Pale of Settlement]]. Soon after Osip's birth, they moved to [[Saint Petersburg]]. In 1900, Mandelstam entered the prestigious [[Tenishev School]]. His first poems were printed in 1907 in the school's almanac.\n\nIn April 1908, Mandelstam decided to enter the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in [[Paris]] to study literature and philosophy, but he left the following year to attend the [[University of Heidelberg]] in Germany. In 1911, he decided to continue his education at the [[University of Saint Petersburg]], from which Jews were excluded. He converted to [[Methodism]] and entered the university the same year.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://aalto.vbgcity.ru/node/72 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-08-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316142516/http://aalto.vbgcity.ru/node/72 |archive-date=2012-03-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He did not complete a formal degree.<ref name=Charny>[http://www.jewishgen.org/LITVAK/HTML/OnlineJournals/Mandelshtam.htm Vitaly Charny, \"Osip Emilyevich Mandelshtam (1889-1938) Russian Poet\"]</ref>\n\nMandelstam's poetry, acutely [[Populism|populist]] in spirit after the [[Russian Revolution of 1905|first Russian revolution]] in 1905, became closely associated with [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]] imagery.

At this time, his second book of poems, ''Tristia'', was published in [[Berlin]]. For several years after that, he almost completely abandoned poetry, concentrating on essays, literary criticism, memoirs ''The Noise Of Time'',  ''Feodosiya'' - both 1925; (''Noise of Time'' 1993 in English) and small-format prose ''The Egyptian Stamp'' (1928). As a day job, he translated literature into Russian (19 books in 6 years), then worked as a correspondent for a newspaper.\n\n[[File:Mandelstam, Chukovsky, Livshits & Annenkov 1914 Karl Bulla (with smile).jpg|thumb|right|[[Silver Age of Russian Poetry|Silver Age]] poets Mandelstam, [[Korney Chukovsky|Chukovsky]], [[Benedikt Livshits|Livshits]] and [[Yury Annenkov|Annenkov]] in 1914.

The poem was a sharp criticism of the \"Kremlin highlander\". Six months later, in 1934, Mandelstam was arrested. But, after interrogation about his poem, he was not immediately sentenced to death or the [[Gulag]], but to exile in [[Cherdyn, Perm Krai|Cherdyn]] in the Northern [[Ural (region)|Ural]], where he was accompanied by his wife.

In the next years, Mandelstam wrote a collection of poems known as the ''Voronezh Notebooks'', which included the cycle ''Verses on the Unknown Soldier''. He also wrote several poems that seemed to glorify Stalin (including \"Ode To Stalin\"). However, in 1937, at the outset of the [[Great Purge]], the literary establishment began to attack him in print, first locally, and soon after from Moscow, accusing him of harbouring anti-Soviet views.\n\n===Second arrest and death===\nEarly the following year, Mandelstam and his wife received a government voucher for a holiday not far from Moscow;{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} upon their arrival in May 1938, he was arrested on 5 May (ref. camp document of 12 October 1938, signed by Mandelstam) and charged with \"counter-revolutionary activities\". Four months later, on 2 August 1938,<ref>Extract from court protocol No. 19390/Ts</ref> Mandelstam was sentenced to five years in correction camps. He arrived at the Vtoraya Rechka (Second River) transit camp near [[Vladivostok]] in Russia's Far East and managed to get a note out to his wife asking for warm clothes; he never received them. He died from cold and hunger. His death was described later in a short story \"Sherry Brandy\" by [[Varlam Shalamov]].\n\nMandelstam's own prophecy was fulfilled: \"Only in Russia is poetry respected, it gets people killed.

He was the husband of [[Nadezhda Mandelstam]] and one of the foremost members of the [[Acmeist poetry|Acmeist]] school of poets. He was arrested by [[Joseph Stalin]]'s government during the repression of the 1930s and sent into internal exile with his wife [[Nadezhda Mandelstam|Nadezhda]].\n\nGiven a reprieve of sorts, they moved to [[Voronezh]] in southwestern Russia. In 1938 Mandelstam was arrested again and sentenced to five years in a corrective-labour camp in the Soviet [[Far East]]. He died that year at a transit camp near Vladivostok.\n\n==Life and work==\nMandelstam was born in [[Warsaw]], [[Congress Poland]], [[Russian Empire]] to a wealthy [[Polish-Jewish]] family. His father, a leather merchant by trade, was able to receive a dispensation freeing the family from the [[Pale of Settlement]]. Soon after Osip's birth, they moved to [[Saint Petersburg]]. In 1900, Mandelstam entered the prestigious [[Tenishev School]]. His first poems were printed in 1907 in the school's almanac.\n\nIn April 1908, Mandelstam decided to enter the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in [[Paris]] to study literature and philosophy, but he left the following year to attend the [[University of Heidelberg]] in Germany. In 1911, he decided to continue his education at the [[University of Saint Petersburg]], from which Jews were excluded. He converted to [[Methodism]] and entered the university the same year.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://aalto.vbgcity.ru/node/72 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-08-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316142516/http://aalto.vbgcity.ru/node/72 |archive-date=2012-03-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He did not complete a formal degree.<ref name=Charny>[http://www.jewishgen.org/LITVAK/HTML/OnlineJournals/Mandelshtam.htm Vitaly Charny, \"Osip Emilyevich Mandelshtam (1889-1938) Russian Poet\"]</ref>\n\nMandelstam's poetry, acutely [[Populism|populist]] in spirit after the [[Russian Revolution of 1905|first Russian revolution]] in 1905, became closely associated with [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]] imagery. In 1911, he and several other young Russian poets formed the \"Poets' Guild\", under the formal leadership of [[Nikolai Gumilyov]] and [[Sergei Gorodetsky]]. The nucleus of this group became known as [[Acmeist poetry|Acmeists]].

At this time, his second book of poems, ''Tristia'', was published in [[Berlin]]. For several years after that, he almost completely abandoned poetry, concentrating on essays, literary criticism, memoirs ''The Noise Of Time'',  ''Feodosiya'' - both 1925; (''Noise of Time'' 1993 in English) and small-format prose ''The Egyptian Stamp'' (1928). As a day job, he translated literature into Russian (19 books in 6 years), then worked as a correspondent for a newspaper.\n\n[[File:Mandelstam, Chukovsky, Livshits & Annenkov 1914 Karl Bulla (with smile).jpg|thumb|right|[[Silver Age of Russian Poetry|Silver Age]] poets Mandelstam, [[Korney Chukovsky|Chukovsky]], [[Benedikt Livshits|Livshits]] and [[Yury Annenkov|Annenkov]] in 1914.

The poem was a sharp criticism of the \"Kremlin highlander\". Six months later, in 1934, Mandelstam was arrested. But, after interrogation about his poem, he was not immediately sentenced to death or the [[Gulag]], but to exile in [[Cherdyn, Perm Krai|Cherdyn]] in the Northern [[Ural (region)|Ural]], where he was accompanied by his wife.

In the next years, Mandelstam wrote a collection of poems known as the ''Voronezh Notebooks'', which included the cycle ''Verses on the Unknown Soldier''. He also wrote several poems that seemed to glorify Stalin (including \"Ode To Stalin\"). However, in 1937, at the outset of the [[Great Purge]], the literary establishment began to attack him in print, first locally, and soon after from Moscow, accusing him of harbouring anti-Soviet views.\n\n===Second arrest and death===\nEarly the following year, Mandelstam and his wife received a government voucher for a holiday not far from Moscow;{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} upon their arrival in May 1938, he was arrested on 5 May (ref. camp document of 12 October 1938, signed by Mandelstam) and charged with \"counter-revolutionary activities\". Four months later, on 2 August 1938,<ref>Extract from court protocol No. 19390/Ts</ref> Mandelstam was sentenced to five years in correction camps. He arrived at the Vtoraya Rechka (Second River) transit camp near [[Vladivostok]] in Russia's Far East and managed to get a note out to his wife asking for warm clothes; he never received them. He died from cold and hunger. His death was described later in a short story \"Sherry Brandy\" by [[Varlam Shalamov]].\n\nMandelstam's own prophecy was fulfilled: \"Only in Russia is poetry respected, it gets people killed. Is there anywhere else where poetry is so common a motive for murder?\" [[Nadezhda Mandelstam]] wrote memoirs about her life and times with her husband in ''Hope against Hope'' (1970) <ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> and ''Hope Abandoned''.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> She also managed to preserve a significant part of Mandelstam's unpublished work.<ref name=ronen/>\n\n==Posthumous reputation and influence==\n*In 1956, during the [[Khrushchev thaw]], Mandelstam was [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] and exonerated from the charges brought against him in 1938.\n*The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation aired ''Hope Against Hope'', a radio dramatization about Mandelstam's poetry based on the book of the same title by Nadezhda Mandelstam, on 1 February 1972. The script was written by [[George Whalley]], a Canadian scholar and critic, and the broadcast was produced by [[John Reeves (composer)|John Reeves]].\n*In 1977, a [[minor planet]], [[3461 Mandelstam]], discovered by Soviet astronomer [[Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh]], was named after him.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?hl=ru&q=3461+Mandelshtam+1977 ''Dictionary of Minor Planet Names'', p. 290]</ref>\n*On 28 October 1987, during the administration of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], Mandelstam was also exonerated from the 1934 charges and thus fully rehabilitated.<ref name=\"rehab\">Kuvaldin, Y.

Southern planters and businessmen traveled there regularly and had their own favorite hotels.<ref name=\"stone\"/> \n\nIn 1799, New York passed a gradual abolition statute and in 1817, New York passed a law freeing all slaves in the state on July 4, 1827. The 1817 law stated:\n<blockquote>''No person held as a slave shall be imported, introduced, or brought into this State on any pretence whatever ... . Every such person shall be free. ...''<ref>Laws of 1817, 136, \u00a79; 20 N.Y., 601; 5 S.S.C., 681; 26 B., 272. ''See'' ''Statutes at Large'' (as of July 1, 1862) edited by John W.

The Lemmons had brought with them eight slaves belonging to Mrs. Lemmon. They made up two family groups, each headed by a young woman: the first was Emiline (age 23), Edward (age 13), brother of Emiline; and Amanda (age 2), daughter of Emiline. The second was Nancy (age 20); Lewis (age 16), brother of Nancy; Lewis and Edward (age 7), sons of Nancy; and Ann (age 5), daughter of Nancy. The older members of the groups served the Lemmons as domestic slaves. While the Lemmons awaited the ship to Texas, they placed their slaves in a boarding house at No. 3 Carlisle Street and booked another hotel for themselves.\n\nLouis Napoleon, a free African-American resident of New York and activist with the [[Underground Railroad]], was alerted to the arrival of the slaves by a black porter at the boarding house about the slaves who had been brought there. Black citizens of New York regularly aided slaves brought to the city to gain freedom by force of state law.\n\nOn 6 November 1852, Napoleon presented a petition to Judge Elijah Paine Jr., of the Superior Court of New York City, for a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' that would effectively emancipate the slaves. The petition was based on the 1841 New York law noted above that said any slave brought into the state was immediately free. \n\nMr. Lemmon's attorneys objected. They asserted that the Lemmons were transporting their slaves from Virginia to Texas, claiming this was an action of interstate commerce, as slaves were considered property in southern states. They cited the [[United States Supreme Court]]'s ruling in ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'' (1824) that states had no power to regulate interstate commerce, as that power was granted to the federal government.\n\nThe state of New York designated lawyers to appear in support of the petition, including [[John Jay (lawyer)|John Jay]], [[Erastus D. Culver]], and [[Chester Alan Arthur]]. They argued that the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] granted limited powers to the federal government, and those powers not granted were reserved for the states. The [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]] and the Supreme Court's precedent in ''Prigg v. Pennsylvania'' (1842)<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Finkelman |first1=Paul |title=[[Prigg v. Pennsylvania]]:  Understanding Justice Story's Pro-Slavery Nationalism |journal=Journal of Supreme Court History |date=1997 |volume=2 |page=51-64}}</ref> prohibited the states from interfering in the return of fugitive slaves. But New York argued that this explicit requirement implicitly excluded any requirement for states to return non-fugitive slaves, by the principle ''expressio unius exclusio alterius'' (\"the express mention of one thing excludes others\").\n\n==Proceedings==\nOn November 13, 1852, Judge Paine held that the Lemmons were not required to travel to Texas via New York.  Thus, they had chosen to bring their slaves to New York, knowing it was a free state. Thus, the slaves were free according to New York state law forbidding bringing slaves \"in transit\" into the state.  Paine relied on the English precedent set in ''[[Somersett's Case|Somersett v. Stewart]]'' (1772), where the [[Court of King's Bench]] declared that only positive law could uphold slavery and that, since England had no laws upholding slavery, slaves entering English territory became free.<ref>{{harvnb|Gordan|2006||pp=11\u201312}}</ref>\n\nAfter his decision, Judge Paine organized a subscription. He arranged to pay Lemmon the full value of the slaves. When the case reached the New York Court of Appeals, John Jay II, submitted an ''amicus curiae'' brief arguing that, inasmuch as Lemmon suffered no loss, he had no justiciable controversy.<ref name=NYT>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1860/04/16/news/law-intelligence-decision-in-the-lemmon-slave-case.html|title=Law Intelligence: Decision in the Lemmon Slave Case|work=New York Times|date=April 18, 1860|accessdate=March 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe State of Virginia assisted Lemmon in his appeal to the [[New York Supreme Court]] granted ''[[certiorari]]''.<ref name=NYT/> The court affirmed Justice Paine in December 1857 with one dissent. Lemmon appealed again, to the [[New York Court of Appeals]] (the state's highest appellate court). The Court of Appeals affirmed by a vote of 5-3 in March 1860, holding that the slaves were free.\n\nThe Lemmons assigned their rights to the State of Virginia, which had planned to appeal to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. By then the [[American Civil War]] had begun and the case was never heard.<ref>{{harvnb|Gordan|2006||page=12}}</ref>\n\n==Reaction==\n\nShortly after reporting the decision of the Court of Appeals, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an article criticizing the opinions of the two dissenting judges in the Lemmon case. First it addressed judicial decisions in general, including in the South, saying that the country's polarization on slavery was resulting in biased decisions by judges. It noted that cases were being decided against free blacks and against the ability of owners to free slaves by will, because opinions were overriding precedent. It said \n<blockquote>\"judges are gradually giving way to the pressure of one side or other, and ceasing even to pretend to administer the law as they find it, or to stand by the old rules of interpretation in any case in which the interests of slaveholders are involved.\" Although the piece noted that in the North, \"the evil has been less apparent,\" preferring errors that favored freedom rather than slavery, decisions based on the Fugitive Slave Law \"have at least rarely been illustrations of judicial wisdom, moderation, and impartiality.\"</blockquote> \n\nThe article reviewed the dissents of Chief Judge Comstock and Judge Selden in the Lemmon case. Both men had noted in their dissents that they had not the time to give the case a thorough consideration. But nonetheless they dissented, saying that the New York statute prohibiting slaveowners from bringing slaves in transit into the state, violated \"the rules of justice and comity\" that ought to regulate intercourse among the states. The ''Times'' said the judges had overstepped their bounds by creating a new standard: \"If this rule does not arm judges with legislative power, we should like to hear of some other plan which does it more effectually.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1860/04/26/news/the-lemmon-slave-case.html?pagewanted=all|title=The Lemmon Slave Case|work=New York Times|date=April 26, 1860|accessdate=March 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhile ''Lemmon'' was still pending, United States Supreme Court Justice [[Samuel Nelson]], from New York, \"had hinted at constitutional restraints upon State power over slavery\" in his concurrence to ''[[Dred Scott v. Sanford|Scott v. Sandford]]''.<ref>[[Allan Nevins]] (1950), ''Ordeal of the Union'', Vol. 3, ''The Emergence of Lincoln: Douglas, Buchanan, and Party Chaos'', New York: Scribner's, Ch. 13, \"Douglas under Challenge\", p. 362.</ref> Nelson noted that the question of slaveholders' right to take slaves into or through free states had not been under consideration in Dred Scott:  \n<blockquote>\"A question has been alluded to, on the argument, namely: the right of the master with his slave of transit into or through a free State, on business or commercial pursuits, or in the exercise of a Federal right, or the discharge of a Federal duty, being a citizen of the United States, which is not before us.  This question depends upon different considerations and principles from the one in hand, and turns upon the rights and privileges secured to a common citizen of the republic under the Constitution of the United States. When that question arises, we shall be prepared to decide it.\"<ref>''Scott v. Sandford'', 468.</ref></blockquote>Don E. Fehrenbaccher later suggested that Nelson thought the Supreme Court might be required to rule on the issue of slaves carried to free states..<ref>[[Don E. Fehrenbacher]] (1978), ''The Dred Scott Case: Its Significance in American Law and Politics'', 2001 reprint, New York:  Oxford, Part 2, \"A Decade of Litigation\", Ch. 17, \"Concurrence and Dissent\", p. 394, {{ISBN|978-0-19-514588-5}} .</ref>\n\n[[Lincoln's House Divided Speech]] on 1858 outlined the threat if the Supreme Court followed thinking related to Dred Scott when ruling on the right of states to regulate slavery:  \n<blockquote>\"The nearest approach to the point of declarating the power of a state over slavery, is made by Judge Nelson. He approaches it more than once, using the precise idea, and ''almost'' the language too, of the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act|Nebraska Act]]. On one occasion, his exact language is 'except in cases where the power is restrained by the Constitution of the United States, the law of the State is supreme over the subject of slavery within its jurisdiction.' In what cases the power of the ''states'' is so restrained by the U.S. Constitution, is left an ''open'' question, precisely as the question as to the power of the ''territories'' was left open in the Nebraska Act. Put ''that'' and ''that'' together, and we have a nice little niche, which we may, ere long, see filled with another Supreme Court decision, declaring that the Constitution of the United States does not permit a ''state'' to exclude slavery from its limits.\"<ref>[[Abraham Lincoln]], at the [[Illinois State Capitol]], Springfield, IL, June 16, 1858. [Lincoln's emphases].</ref></blockquote>As noted, the outbreak of war meant that the Supreme Court never heard Virginia's appeal of the Lemmon case.\n\nHistorian [[Paul Finkelman]] noted in his book<ref>{{cite book |last1=Finkelman |first1=Paul |title=An Imperfect Union: Slavery, Federalism, and Comity |date=1981 |publisher=Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press |isbn=978-1584770923 |edition=Reprint 2000}}</ref> on the history of slave transit in the North that \"Lemmon was the culmination of a long and intense conflict over the place of slavery within the legal framework of the Union.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Finkelman |first1=Paul |title=An Imperfect Union: Slavery, Federalism, and Comity |date=1981 |publisher=Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press |isbn=978-1584770923 |page=310 |edition=Reprint 2000}}</ref> Finkelman also noted that Lemmon was  \"part of the larger social and political movements that ultimately led to the Republican party, the Civil War, and Constitutional amendments ending slavery and making blacks full-fledged citizens.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Finkelman |first1=Paul |title=An Imperfect Union: Slavery, Federalism, and Comity |date=1981 |publisher=Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press |isbn=978-1584770923 |page=310-311 |edition=Reprint 2000}}</ref>The importance of Lemmon was clear to the South.  In explaining why it was leaving the Union, the South Carolina Secession Convention noted: \"In the State of New York even the right of transit for a slave has been denied by her tribunals.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union: and the Ordinance of Secession |date=1860 |publisher=Evans and Cogswell |location=Charlston, SC |page=8 |url=https://www.atlantahistorycenter.com/assets/documents/SCarolina-Secession-p1-13.pdf |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nYears later Chester A. Arthur took credit for promoting the rights of slaves (and the state) in this case. Historian Thomas C.

Southern planters and businessmen traveled there regularly and had their own favorite hotels.<ref name=\"stone\"/> \n\nIn 1799, New York passed a gradual abolition statute and in 1817, New York passed a law freeing all slaves in the state on July 4, 1827. The 1817 law stated:\n<blockquote>''No person held as a slave shall be imported, introduced, or brought into this State on any pretence whatever ... . Every such person shall be free. ...''<ref>Laws of 1817, 136, \u00a79; 20 N.Y., 601; 5 S.S.C., 681; 26 B., 272. ''See'' ''Statutes at Large'' (as of July 1, 1862) edited by John W.

The Lemmons had brought with them eight slaves belonging to Mrs. Lemmon. They made up two family groups, each headed by a young woman: the first was Emiline (age 23), Edward (age 13), brother of Emiline; and Amanda (age 2), daughter of Emiline. The second was Nancy (age 20); Lewis (age 16), brother of Nancy; Lewis and Edward (age 7), sons of Nancy; and Ann (age 5), daughter of Nancy. The older members of the groups served the Lemmons as domestic slaves. While the Lemmons awaited the ship to Texas, they placed their slaves in a boarding house at No. 3 Carlisle Street and booked another hotel for themselves.\n\nLouis Napoleon, a free African-American resident of New York and activist with the [[Underground Railroad]], was alerted to the arrival of the slaves by a black porter at the boarding house about the slaves who had been brought there. Black citizens of New York regularly aided slaves brought to the city to gain freedom by force of state law.\n\nOn 6 November 1852, Napoleon presented a petition to Judge Elijah Paine Jr., of the Superior Court of New York City, for a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' that would effectively emancipate the slaves. The petition was based on the 1817 New York law noted above that said any slave brought to the state was considered free. \n\nMr. Lemmon's attorneys objected. They asserted that the Lemmons were transporting their slaves from Virginia to Texas, claiming this was an action of interstate commerce, as slaves were considered property in southern states. They cited the [[United States Supreme Court]]'s ruling in ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'' (1824) that states had no power to regulate interstate commerce, as that power was granted to the federal government.\n\nThe state of New York designated lawyers to appear in support of the petition, including [[John Jay (lawyer)|John Jay]], [[Erastus D. Culver]], and [[Chester Alan Arthur]]. They argued that the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] granted limited powers to the federal government, and those powers not granted were reserved for the states. The [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]] and the Supreme Court's precedent in ''Prigg v. Pennsylvania'' (1842)<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Finkelman |first1=Paul |title=[[Prigg v. Pennsylvania]]:  Understanding Justice Story's Pro-Slavery Nationalism |journal=Journal of Supreme Court History |date=1997 |volume=2 |page=51-64}}</ref> prohibited the states from interfering in the return of fugitive slaves. But New York argued that this explicit requirement implicitly excluded any requirement for states to return non-fugitive slaves, by the principle ''expressio unius exclusio alterius'' (\"the express mention of one thing excludes others\").\n\n==Proceedings==\nOn November 13, 1852, Judge Paine held that the Lemmons were not required to travel to Texas via New York.  Thus, they had chosen to bring their slaves to New York, knowing it was a free state. Thus, the slaves were free according to New York state law forbidding bringing slaves \"in transit\" into the state.  Paine relied on the English precedent set in ''[[Somersett's Case|Somersett v. Stewart]]'' (1772), where the [[Court of King's Bench]] declared that only positive law could uphold slavery and that, since England had no laws upholding slavery, slaves entering English territory became free.<ref>{{harvnb|Gordan|2006||pp=11\u201312}}</ref>\n\nAfter his decision, Judge Paine organized a subscription. He arranged to pay Lemmon the full value of the slaves. When the case reached the New York Court of Appeals, John Jay II, submitted an ''amicus curiae'' brief arguing that, inasmuch as Lemmon suffered no loss, he had no justiciable controversy.<ref name=NYT>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1860/04/16/news/law-intelligence-decision-in-the-lemmon-slave-case.html|title=Law Intelligence: Decision in the Lemmon Slave Case|work=New York Times|date=April 18, 1860|accessdate=March 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe State of Virginia assisted Lemmon in his appeal to the [[New York Supreme Court]] granted ''[[certiorari]]''.<ref name=NYT/> The court affirmed Justice Paine in December 1857 with one dissent. Lemmon appealed again, to the [[New York Court of Appeals]] (the state's highest appellate court). The Court of Appeals affirmed by a vote of 5-3 in March 1860, holding that the slaves were free.\n\nThe Lemmons assigned their rights to the State of Virginia, which had planned to appeal to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. By then the [[American Civil War]] had begun and the case was never heard.<ref>{{harvnb|Gordan|2006||page=12}}</ref>\n\n==Reaction==\n\nShortly after reporting the decision of the Court of Appeals, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an article criticizing the opinions of the two dissenting judges in the Lemmon case. First it addressed judicial decisions in general, including in the South, saying that the country's polarization on slavery was resulting in biased decisions by judges. It noted that cases were being decided against free blacks and against the ability of owners to free slaves by will, because opinions were overriding precedent. It said \n<blockquote>\"judges are gradually giving way to the pressure of one side or other, and ceasing even to pretend to administer the law as they find it, or to stand by the old rules of interpretation in any case in which the interests of slaveholders are involved.\" Although the piece noted that in the North, \"the evil has been less apparent,\" preferring errors that favored freedom rather than slavery, decisions based on the Fugitive Slave Law \"have at least rarely been illustrations of judicial wisdom, moderation, and impartiality.\"</blockquote> \n\nThe article reviewed the dissents of Chief Judge Comstock and Judge Selden in the Lemmon case. Both men had noted in their dissents that they had not the time to give the case a thorough consideration. But nonetheless they dissented, saying that the New York statute prohibiting slaveowners from bringing slaves in transit into the state, violated \"the rules of justice and comity\" that ought to regulate intercourse among the states. The ''Times'' said the judges had overstepped their bounds by creating a new standard: \"If this rule does not arm judges with legislative power, we should like to hear of some other plan which does it more effectually.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1860/04/26/news/the-lemmon-slave-case.html?pagewanted=all|title=The Lemmon Slave Case|work=New York Times|date=April 26, 1860|accessdate=March 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhile ''Lemmon'' was still pending, United States Supreme Court Justice [[Samuel Nelson]], from New York, \"had hinted at constitutional restraints upon State power over slavery\" in his concurrence to ''[[Dred Scott v. Sanford|Scott v. Sandford]]''.<ref>[[Allan Nevins]] (1950), ''Ordeal of the Union'', Vol. 3, ''The Emergence of Lincoln: Douglas, Buchanan, and Party Chaos'', New York: Scribner's, Ch. 13, \"Douglas under Challenge\", p. 362.</ref> Nelson noted that the question of slaveholders' right to take slaves into or through free states had not been under consideration in Dred Scott:  \n<blockquote>\"A question has been alluded to, on the argument, namely: the right of the master with his slave of transit into or through a free State, on business or commercial pursuits, or in the exercise of a Federal right, or the discharge of a Federal duty, being a citizen of the United States, which is not before us.  This question depends upon different considerations and principles from the one in hand, and turns upon the rights and privileges secured to a common citizen of the republic under the Constitution of the United States. When that question arises, we shall be prepared to decide it.\"<ref>''Scott v. Sandford'', 468.</ref></blockquote>Don E. Fehrenbaccher later suggested that Nelson thought the Supreme Court might be required to rule on the issue of slaves carried to free states..<ref>[[Don E. Fehrenbacher]] (1978), ''The Dred Scott Case: Its Significance in American Law and Politics'', 2001 reprint, New York:  Oxford, Part 2, \"A Decade of Litigation\", Ch. 17, \"Concurrence and Dissent\", p. 394, {{ISBN|978-0-19-514588-5}} .</ref>\n\n[[Lincoln's House Divided Speech]] on 1858 outlined the threat if the Supreme Court followed thinking related to Dred Scott when ruling on the right of states to regulate slavery:  \n<blockquote>\"The nearest approach to the point of declarating the power of a state over slavery, is made by Judge Nelson. He approaches it more than once, using the precise idea, and ''almost'' the language too, of the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act|Nebraska Act]]. On one occasion, his exact language is 'except in cases where the power is restrained by the Constitution of the United States, the law of the State is supreme over the subject of slavery within its jurisdiction.' In what cases the power of the ''states'' is so restrained by the U.S. Constitution, is left an ''open'' question, precisely as the question as to the power of the ''territories'' was left open in the Nebraska Act. Put ''that'' and ''that'' together, and we have a nice little niche, which we may, ere long, see filled with another Supreme Court decision, declaring that the Constitution of the United States does not permit a ''state'' to exclude slavery from its limits.\"<ref>[[Abraham Lincoln]], at the [[Illinois State Capitol]], Springfield, IL, June 16, 1858. [Lincoln's emphases].</ref></blockquote>As noted, the outbreak of war meant that the Supreme Court never heard Virginia's appeal of the Lemmon case.\n\nHistorian [[Paul Finkelman]] noted in his book<ref>{{cite book |last1=Finkelman |first1=Paul |title=An Imperfect Union: Slavery, Federalism, and Comity |date=1981 |publisher=Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press |isbn=978-1584770923 |edition=Reprint 2000}}</ref> on the history of slave transit in the North that \"Lemmon was the culmination of a long and intense conflict over the place of slavery within the legal framework of the Union.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Finkelman |first1=Paul |title=An Imperfect Union: Slavery, Federalism, and Comity |date=1981 |publisher=Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press |isbn=978-1584770923 |page=310 |edition=Reprint 2000}}</ref> Finkelman also noted that Lemmon was  \"part of the larger social and political movements that ultimately led to the Republican party, the Civil War, and Constitutional amendments ending slavery and making blacks full-fledged citizens.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Finkelman |first1=Paul |title=An Imperfect Union: Slavery, Federalism, and Comity |date=1981 |publisher=Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press |isbn=978-1584770923 |page=310-311 |edition=Reprint 2000}}</ref>The importance of Lemmon was clear to the South.  In explaining why it was leaving the Union, the South Carolina Secession Convention noted: \"In the State of New York even the right of transit for a slave has been denied by her tribunals.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union: and the Ordinance of Secession |date=1860 |publisher=Evans and Cogswell |location=Charlston, SC |page=8 |url=https://www.atlantahistorycenter.com/assets/documents/SCarolina-Secession-p1-13.pdf |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nYears later Chester A. Arthur took credit for promoting the rights of slaves (and the state) in this case. Historian Thomas C.
