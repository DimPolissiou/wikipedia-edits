In the Philippines and Indonesia, it is commonly grown for its leaves which are used as food. Moringa is also actively cultivated by the [[World Vegetable Center]] in [[Taiwan]], a center for vegetable research.\n\nMore generally, moringa grows in the wild or is cultivated in Central America and the [[Caribbean]], northern countries of South America, Africa, Southeast Asia and various countries of [[Oceania]].\n\nAs of 2010, cultivation in Hawaii, for commercial distribution in the United States, was in its early stages.<ref name=\"ted\">{{cite journal\n | title=Farm and Forestry Production and Marketing Profile for Moringa (revised February 2011)\n | author=Ted Radovich\n | year=2011\n | journal=In: Specialty Crops for Pacific Island Agroforestry\n | editor=C.R. Elevitch\n | url=http://agroforestry.net/scps/Moringa_specialty_crop.pdf\n}}</ref>\n\n===Cultivation practice===\n====Soil preparations====\nIn tropical cultivation, [[soil erosion]] is a major problem. Therefore, the soil treatment has to be as shallow as possible. Plowing is required only for high planting densities. In low planting densities, \"it is better to dig pits and refill them with the soil. This ensures good root system penetration without causing too much land erosion. The pits must be 30 to 50 cm deep, and 20 to 40 cm wide.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n====Propagation====\nMoringa can be [[plant propagation|propagated]] from [[seed]] or [[cutting (plant)|cuttings]]. \nDirect seeding is possible because the [[germination rate]] of ''M. oleifera'' is high. Moringa seeds can be germinated year-round in well-draining soil. Cuttings of 1 m length and at least 4&nbsp;cm diameter can be used for [[vegetative propagation]].\n\n====Planting====\nFor intensive leaf production, \"the spacing of plants should be 15 x 15 cm or 20 x 10 cm, with conveniently spaced alleys (for example: every 4 m) to facilitate plantation management and harvests.\"<ref name=\"amaglo\"/> [[Weeding]] and [[disease prevention]] are difficult because of the high density. In a semi-intensive production, the plants are spaced 50&nbsp;cm to 1 m apart. This gives good results with less maintenance.\n\nMoringa trees can also be cultivated in alleys, as natural fences and associated with other crops. The distance between moringa rows in an agroforestry cultivation is usually between 2 and 4 m.\n\n==Breeding==\nIn India, from where moringa most likely originated, the diversity of wild types is large. This gives a good basis for breeding programs. In countries where moringa has been introduced, the diversity is usually much smaller among the cultivar types. Locally well-adapted wild types, though, can be found in most regions.\n\nBecause moringa is cultivated and used in different ways, there are different breeding aims. The breeding aims for an annual or a perennial plant are obviously different. The yield stability of fruits is an important breeding aim for the commercial cultivation in India, where moringa is cultivated as an annual. On less favorable locations, perennial cultivation has big advantages. Erosion is much smaller with perennial cultivation. In Pakistan, varieties have been tested for their nutritional composition of the leaves on different locations.<ref name=Rees3>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jfca.2005.05.001 |title=Effect of season and production location on antioxidant activity of Moringa oleifera leaves grown in Pakistan |year=2006 |last1=Iqbal |first1=Shahid |last2=Bhanger |first2=M.I. |journal=Journal of Food Composition and Analysis |volume=19 |issue=6\u20137 |pages=544\u2013551}}</ref> \nThe different breeding aims result in a different selection. India selects for a higher number of pods and dwarf or semidwarf varieties. Breeders in Tanzania, though, are selecting for higher oil content.\n\n==Yield and harvest==\n''M. oleifera'' can be cultivated for its leaves, pods, and/or its kernels for oil extraction and water purification. The yields vary widely, depending on season, variety, fertilization, and irrigation regimen. Moringa yields best under warm, dry conditions with some supplemental fertilizer and irrigation.<ref name=ted/> Harvest is done manually with knives, sickles, and stabs with hooks attached.<ref name=ted/> [[Pollarding]], [[coppicing]], and lopping or [[pruning]] are recommended to promote branching, increase production, and facilitate harvesting.<ref name=\"pollarding\">{{cite book |last=Grubben |first1=G |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6jrlyOPfr24C&lpg=PA394&dq=pollarding%20moringa&pg=PA394#v=onepage&q=pollarding%20moringa&f=false |title=Vegetables |volume=2 |edition=Plant resources of tropical Africa |editor-last=Grubben |editor-first= G.

Often, the fruits are not produced in the first year, and the yield is generally low during the first few years. By year two, it produces around 300 pods, by year three around 400\u2013500. A good tree can yield 1000 or more pods.<ref>Booth, F.E.M.; Wickens, G.E., 1988: Non-timber Uses of Selected Arid Zone Trees and Shrubs in Africa, p.98, FAO, Rome \"[http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/t0044e/T0044e16.htm]\".Retrieved 20-11-2013.</ref> In India, a hectare can produce 31 tons of pods per year.<ref name=ted/> Under North Indian conditions, the fruits ripen during the summer.

The budworms [[Noctuidae]] are known to cause serious defoliation. Damaging agents can also be [[aphid]]s, stem borers, and fruit flies. In some regions, termites can also cause minor damage. If termites are numerous in soils, insects management costs are not bearable.<ref name=parotta/>\n\nThe moringa tree is a host to ''[[Leveillula taurica]]'', a powdery [[mildew]] which causes damage in papaya crops in south India.

Elevitch\n | url=http://agroforestry.net/scps/Moringa_specialty_crop.pdf\n}}</ref>\n\n===Cultivation practice===\n====Soil preparations====\nIn tropical cultivation, [[soil erosion]] is a major problem. Therefore, the soil treatment has to be as shallow as possible. Plowing is required only for high planting densities. In low planting densities, \"it is better to dig pits and refill them with the soil. This ensures good root system penetration without causing too much land erosion. The pits must be 30 to 50 cm deep, and 20 to 40 cm wide.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n====Propagation====\nMoringa can be [[plant propagation|propagated]] from [[seed]] or [[cutting (plant)|cuttings]]. \nDirect seeding is possible because the [[germination rate]] of ''M. oleifera'' is high. Moringa seeds can be germinated year-round in well-draining soil. Cuttings of 1 m length and at least 4&nbsp;cm diameter can be used for [[vegetative propagation]].\n\n====Planting====\nFor intensive leaf production, \"the spacing of plants should be 15 x 15 cm or 20 x 10 cm, with conveniently spaced alleys (for example: every 4 m) to facilitate plantation management and harvests.\"<ref name=\"amaglo\"/> [[Weeding]] and [[disease prevention]] are difficult because of the high density. In a semi-intensive production, the plants are spaced 50&nbsp;cm to 1 m apart. This gives good results with less maintenance.\n\nMoringa trees can also be cultivated in alleys, as natural fences and associated with other crops. The distance between moringa rows in an agroforestry cultivation is usually between 2 and 4 m.\n\n==Breeding==\nIn India, from where moringa most likely originated, the diversity of wild types is large. This gives a good basis for breeding programs. In countries where moringa has been introduced, the diversity is usually much smaller among the cultivar types. Locally well-adapted wild types, though, can be found in most regions.\n\nBecause moringa is cultivated and used in different ways, there are different breeding aims. The breeding aims for an annual or a perennial plant are obviously different. The yield stability of fruits is an important breeding aim for the commercial cultivation in India, where moringa is cultivated as an annual. On less favorable locations, perennial cultivation has big advantages. Erosion is much smaller with perennial cultivation. In [[Pakistan]], varieties have been tested for their nutritional composition of the leaves on different locations.<ref name=Rees3>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jfca.2005.05.001 |title=Effect of season and production location on antioxidant activity of Moringa oleifera leaves grown in Pakistan |year=2006 |last1=Iqbal |first1=Shahid |last2=Bhanger |first2=M.I. |journal=Journal of Food Composition and Analysis |volume=19 |issue=6\u20137 |pages=544\u2013551}}</ref> \nThe different breeding aims result in a different selection. India selects for a higher number of pods and dwarf or semidwarf varieties. Breeders in Tanzania, though, are selecting for higher oil content.\n\n==Yield and harvest==\n''M. oleifera'' can be cultivated for its leaves, pods, and/or its kernels for oil extraction and water purification. The yields vary widely, depending on season, variety, fertilization, and irrigation regimen. Moringa yields best under warm, dry conditions with some supplemental fertilizer and irrigation.<ref name=ted/> Harvest is done manually with knives, sickles, and stabs with hooks attached.<ref name=ted/> [[Pollarding]], [[coppicing]], and lopping or [[pruning]] are recommended to promote branching, increase production, and facilitate harvesting.<ref name=\"pollarding\">{{cite book |last=Grubben |first1=G |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6jrlyOPfr24C&lpg=PA394&dq=pollarding%20moringa&pg=PA394#v=onepage&q=pollarding%20moringa&f=false |title=Vegetables |volume=2 |edition=Plant resources of tropical Africa |editor-last=Grubben |editor-first= G.

Often, the fruits are not produced in the first year, and the yield is generally low during the first few years. By year two, it produces around 300 pods, by year three around 400\u2013500. A good tree can yield 1000 or more pods.<ref>Booth, F.E.M.; Wickens, G.E., 1988: Non-timber Uses of Selected Arid Zone Trees and Shrubs in Africa, p.98, FAO, Rome \"[http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/t0044e/T0044e16.htm]\".Retrieved 20-11-2013.</ref> In India, a hectare can produce 31 tons of pods per year.<ref name=ted/> Under North Indian conditions, the fruits ripen during the summer.

In India, several insect pests are seen, including various caterpillars such as the bark-eating [[caterpillar]], the hairy caterpillar or the green leaf caterpillar. The budworms [[Noctuidae]] are known to cause serious defoliation. Damaging agents can also be [[aphid]]s, stem borers, and fruit flies. In some regions, termites can also cause minor damage. If termites are numerous in soils, insects management costs are not bearable.<ref name=parotta/>\n\nThe moringa tree is a host to ''[[Leveillula taurica]]'', a powdery [[mildew]] which causes damage in papaya crops in south India.

The [[Name of a biological genus|generic name]] is derived from the German name of the colony in which the fossils were found, ''Deutsch-Ostafrika,'' meaning \"German East Africa\", combined with the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] \u03c3\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (''{{lang|grc-Latn|sauros}}''), meaning \"lizard\" or \"reptile\".

Its tip has been rounded by [[erosion]] and the base is not fully preserved. The tooth [[Crown (tooth)|crown]] has well-defined carinae (cutting edges), with the front carina being curved and the back carina almost straight. There is only mild side-to-side curvature. Both carinae are [[serrated]], with rounded [[Denticle (tooth feature)|denticles]] perpendicular to the edge of the tooth. The serrations have no inderdenticle sulci, or grooves, in between them. They line the front carina from the base to its tip, and probably also did on the back carina, whose base has been largely eroded. Towards the tip of the tooth, these serrations are very worn down (especially on the front carina). On the front carina, there are two [[Denticle (tooth feature)|denticles]] per millimetre (0.04 in) near the tip of the tooth, and three to four per millimetre (0.04 in) as the denticles shrink towards the base of the crown. There are two denticles per millimetre (0.04 in) all along the back carina. The serrations are notably larger than in other known spinosaurids. \n\nThe [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] (outermost layer) of the tooth bears a series of lengthwise ridges on its surface - ten on the [[Glossary of dentistry#lingual|lingual]] side, which faced the inside of the mouth; and four fainter, less extensive ones on the [[Glossary of dentistry#labial|labial]] side, which faced the outside of the mouth. The gaps between ridges are {{Convert|1|mm||abbr=on}} wide at most. None of the ridges on either side reach the tip of the crown. There is a {{Convert|3|mm||abbr=on}} wide region at the front of the tooth on both sides that lacks ridges; a similar area on the rear of the tooth side diminishes in width, from {{Convert|8 to 4|mm||abbr=on}} as it approaches the tip of the crown. On both sides of the tooth, between the ridges and ridge-less parts of the teeth, the enamel surface is finely wrinkled.<ref name=\"Ostafrikasaurus3\">{{cite journal|last=Buffetaut|first=Eric|date=|year=2012|title=An early spinosaurid dinosaur from the Late Jurassic of Tendaguru (Tanzania) and the evolution of the spinosaurid dentition|url=http://www.dinosauria.org/documents/2017/buffetaut_2013.pdf|journal=Oryctos|volume=10|issue=|pages=1\u20138|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Baryonix_skull_43553.JPG|thumb|Skull of ''[[Baryonyx]]'', a [[spinosaurid]] from the [[Early Cretaceous]]]]\n\nIn 2008, Buffetaut suggested that MB R 1084 represented a new genus of spinosaurid, and that it differs from other teeth previously referred to ''L.? stechowi''.<ref name=\"Ostafrikasaurus\">{{cite journal|last=Buffetaut|first=Eric|year=2012|title=An early spinosaurid dinosaur from the Late Jurassic of Tendaguru (Tanzania) and the evolution of the spinosaurid dentition|url=http://www.dinosauria.org/documents/2017/buffetaut_2013.pdf|journal=Oryctos|volume=10|issue=|pages=1\u20138|via=}}</ref> In 2011, German palaeontologist Oliver Rauhut listed some of these differences: MB R 1084 has a much higher number of lingual ridges (up to eleven) and presents three ridges and grooves on the labial side. Furthermore, some of the lingual ridges extend over almost the entire length of the crown, leaving only the apicalmost 5 mm of the crown smooth, whereas others are restricted to the basal part, being intercalated with ridges that extend further apically. Additionally, ridges are present over almost the entire mesial (front) three-fifths of the crown, whereas the distal (back) two-fifths are devoid of any ornamentation. Mesially, the ridged area is slightly set off from the mesial carina by a slightly mesiodistally concave area. However, its general shape and serration density is very similar to the teeth from the Middle Dinosaur Marl, as all teeth have 10 denticles per 5 mm distally and 13 denticles per 5 mm mesially. Finally, Rauhut suggested that it is possible that this tooth represents the same taxon as the other teeth, or a closely related taxon.<ref name=\"Veterupristisaurus\">{{cite journal|last=Rauhut|first=Oliver W.

The [[Name of a biological genus|generic name]] is derived from the German name of the colony in which the fossils were found, ''Deutsch-Ostafrika,'' meaning \"German East Africa\", combined with the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] \u03c3\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (''{{lang|grc-Latn|sauros}}''), meaning \"lizard\" or \"reptile\".

Its tip has been rounded by [[erosion]] and the base is not fully preserved. The tooth [[Crown (tooth)|crown]] has well-defined carinae (cutting edges), with the front carina being curved and the back carina almost straight. There is only mild side-to-side curvature. Both carinae are [[serrated]], with rounded [[Denticle (tooth feature)|denticles]] perpendicular to the edge of the tooth. The serrations have no inderdenticle sulci, or grooves, in between them. They line the front carina from the base to its tip, and probably also did on the back carina, whose base has been largely eroded. Towards the tip of the tooth, these serrations are very worn down (especially on the front carina). On the front carina, there are two [[Denticle (tooth feature)|denticles]] per millimetre (0.04 in) near the tip of the tooth, and three to four per millimetre (0.04 in) as the denticles shrink towards the base of the crown. There are two denticles per millimetre (0.04 in) all along the back carina. The serrations are notably larger than in other known spinosaurids. \n\nThe [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] (outermost layer) of the tooth bears a series of lengthwise ridges on its surface - ten on the [[Glossary of dentistry#lingual|lingual]] side, which faced the inside of the mouth; and four fainter, less extensive ones on the [[Glossary of dentistry#labial|labial]] side, which faced the outside of the mouth.

Furthermore, some of the lingual ridges extend over almost the entire length of the crown, leaving only the apicalmost 5 mm of the crown smooth, whereas others are restricted to the basal part, being intercalated with ridges that extend further apically. Additionally, ridges are present over almost the entire mesial (front) three-fifths of the crown, whereas the distal (back) two-fifths are devoid of any ornamentation. Mesially, the ridged area is slightly set off from the mesial carina by a slightly mesiodistally concave area. However, its general shape and serration density is very similar to the teeth from the Middle Dinosaur Marl, as all teeth have 10 denticles per 5 mm distally and 13 denticles per 5 mm mesially. Finally, Rauhut suggested that it is possible that this tooth represents the same taxon as the other teeth, or a closely related taxon.<ref name=\"Veterupristisaurus\">{{cite journal|last=Rauhut|first=Oliver W.

With the reforms of the [[Meiji (era)|Meiji era]], the samurai class was abolished and a western-style national army was established, making Nakako Takeko one of the last samurai in history.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early years ===\nBorn in [[Edo]], Nakano Takeko was the firstborn daughter of [[Nakano Heinai]] (1810-1878), a samurai and official of Aizu, and of [[Nakano K\u014dko]] (1825-1872), daughter of [[Oinuma Kinai]], samurai in the service of Toda of the [[Ashikaga Domain|Ashikaga domain]]. She had a younger brother and sister: [[Nakano Toyoki]] and [[Nakano Y\u016bko]] (1853-1931). Their residence was in Beidai Ninocho, in the quarters of Tamogami Hyogo, a distant relative of her father. She was good-looking, well-educated, and came from a very powerful samurai family.\n\nFrom 1853 to 1863, she received a strict and complete training in martial arts, in the literary arts on Chinese [[Chinese classics|Confucian classics]] and in calligraphy, and was adopted by her own teacher, [[Akaoka Daisuke]], who was also the famous instructor of [[Matsudaira Teru]], adoptive younger sister of [[Matsudaira Katamori]], [[Aizu domain|daimy\u014d of Aizu]]. She taught students younger than her, like her sister, who also attended school. She loved to read the many stories of Japanese female warriors, generals and empresses, but the legend of [[Tomoe Gozen]] deeply affected her. From childhood, she recited the [[Ogura Hyakunin Isshu|Ogura Hyakunin isshu]].\n\nShe certification ([[menkyo]]) was in Hasso-Shoken, a branch of the major [[Itt\u014d-ry\u016b|Itto-ryu]] tradition. With this official acknowledgment of her ability, she found employment at the Itakura estate, lord of [[Niwase Domain|Niwase]], a secondary domain in today's [[Okayama Prefecture|Okayama prefecture]]. She taught [[naginata]] to the lord's wife and served her as her secretary. She left this position in 1863, when she was adopted by her master, who had been transferred to Osaka for a job of the Aizu domain and had forces deployed in Kyoto for security duties. He tried to get her to marry her nephew, but since the nation was shaken by social unrest, she refused and reunited with her Edo family.\n\nAfter working with the adoptive father as instructor of martial arts during the sixties of the ' nineteenth century, Nakano was in the region of Aizu for the first time in February 1868. During those spring and summer months he taught naginata to women and children in [[Aizuwakamatsu Castle|Aizuwakamatsu castle]], as well as capturing the voyeurs of the women's bathroom.\n\n=== The civil war ===\nHer martial figure is linked to the time of the [[Boshin War|Boshin war]], whose war events saw two adverse factions oppose in a civil conflict: the loyal supporters of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] and the advocates of the restoration of the [[Emperor Meiji|Meiji emperor]], whose results were favorable to the latter would have brought the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]] to the end of the 19th century .\n\nDuring the conflict, Nakano Takeko worked in defense of the sh\u014dgun [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]] and took part in the [[Battle of Aizu]], in which she distinguished herself by fighting against a white weapon, brandishing a naginata, a Japanese intaed weapon. In the clash with the overwhelming [[Japanese Imperial forces|imperial forces]], together with her mother and sister, she was head of an ''ad hoc'' body of female warriors.\n\nThe {{nihongo|[[J\u014dshitai]]|\u5a18\u5b50\u968a|Girls's Army}} was formed by these women: \n[[File:Hirata Kocho and onna-bugeisha.jpg|thumb|Hirata Koch\u014d and another [[Onna-bugeisha]].]]\n\n* The leader of the group, Nakano Takeko, she was 22 years old at this time.\n* Takeko's mother and sister, Kouko and Yuko. At this time Kouko was 40s and Yuko 16 years old.\n* Hirata Koch\u014d and younger sister Hirata Yoshi.\n* Yoda Kikuko and the mother or older sister Yoda Mariko.\n* The famous female warrior, [[Niijima Yae|Yamamoto Yaeko]].\n* Okamura Sakiko and older sister Okamura Makiko.\n* A unnamed woman who was Watashi's concubine.\n* Jinbo Yukiko.\n* The students of ''Monna naginata dojo'' Monna Rieko, Saigo Tomiko and Nagai Sadako.\n* The younger sister of Hara Gor\u014d.\n* Kawahara Asako and Koike Chiyoku.\n\nThrough rain and sleet, the women went into battle autonomously and independently, since the ancient officials of Aizu, in particular [[Kayano Gonbei]], did not allow them to wars, officially, as part of the army of domination. This unit was later retroactively given the name of a ''female army'' ( \u5a18\u5b50 \u968a ''J\u014dshitai'' <sup>?</sup> ). It was [[Furuya Sakuzaemon]], the commander of Aizu's troops, who designated her as the leader of the samurai women the day before her death.\n\n=== Death ===\nDuring the defense, at the [[Yanagi bridge]] in the area of Nishibata, in [[Fukushima Prefecture|Fukushima]], early in the morning she launched a charge to the firearm against the firearms of the huge troops of the Japanese imperial army of the domain of \u014cgaki, commanded by a shaguma . \u00a0When the adversaries realized, surprisingly, that they were female soldiers, an order was immediately given to keep the fire in order not to kill them. \u00a0This hesitation allowed the warriors to approach the enemies and face them with the white weapon: several were killed, before the fire resumed. The enemy was impressed by the lethal fury of the women of Aizu. Nakano Takeko herself killed five or six of them with naginata shots before succumbing, shot to the chest by a rifle shot that would have been fatal for her.\n\nDying, rather than letting the enemy take possession of her corpse to wreak havoc, cutting her head off to use it as a war trophy, she asked her sister Y\u016bko to behead her herself to prevent her capture and honorable burial. Y\u016bko requested the assistance of an Aizu soldier, [[Ueno Yoshisabur\u014d]], for the beheading. Hirata Koch\u014d, the foster younger sister who had studied naginata and calligraphy as Daisuke's foster daughter, was saved by Jinbo Yukiko in the battle and, being the vice-commander, assumed command of the troop to defend Aizuwakamatsu Castle after she was killed, while the deputy became Yamamoto Yaeko.

''Onnatachi no Aizusens\u014d''. Tokyo: Heibonsha. p. 80.</ref> This unit was later retroactively called the {{nihongo|[[J\u014dshitai]]|\u5a18\u5b50\u968a|Girls's Army}}. With the reforms of the [[Meiji (era)|Meiji era]], the samurai class was abolished and a western-style national army was established, making Nakako Takeko one of the last samurai in history.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early years ===\nBorn in [[Edo]], Nakano Takeko was the firstborn daughter of [[Nakano Heinai]] (1810-1878), a samurai and official of Aizu, and of [[Nakano K\u014dko]] (1825-1872), daughter of [[Oinuma Kinai]], samurai in the service of Toda of the [[Ashikaga Domain|Ashikaga domain]]. She had a younger brother and sister: [[Nakano Toyoki]] and [[Nakano Y\u016bko]] (1853-1931). Their residence was in Beidai Ninocho, in the quarters of Tamogami Hyogo, a distant relative of her father. She was good-looking, well-educated, and came from a very powerful samurai family.\n\nFrom 1853 to 1863, she received a strict and complete training in martial arts, in the literary arts on Chinese [[Chinese classics|Confucian classics]] and in calligraphy, and was adopted by her own teacher, [[Akaoka Daisuke]], who was also the famous instructor of [[Matsudaira Teru]], adoptive younger sister of [[Matsudaira Katamori]], [[Aizu domain|daimy\u014d of Aizu]]. She taught students younger than her, like her sister, who also attended school. She loved to read the many stories of Japanese female warriors, generals and empresses, but the legend of [[Tomoe Gozen]] deeply affected her. From childhood, she recited the [[Ogura Hyakunin Isshu|Ogura Hyakunin isshu]].\n\nShe certification ([[menkyo]]) was in Hasso-Shoken, a branch of the major [[Itt\u014d-ry\u016b|Itto-ryu]] tradition. With this official acknowledgment of her ability, she found employment at the Itakura estate, lord of [[Niwase Domain|Niwase]], a secondary domain in today's [[Okayama Prefecture|Okayama prefecture]]. She taught [[naginata]] to the lord's wife and served her as her secretary. She left this position in 1863, when she was adopted by her master, who had been transferred to Osaka for a job of the Aizu domain and had forces deployed in Kyoto for security duties. He tried to get her to marry her nephew, but since the nation was shaken by social unrest, she refused and reunited with her Edo family.\n\nAfter working with the adoptive father as instructor of martial arts during the sixties of the ' nineteenth century, Nakano was in the region of Aizu for the first time in February 1868. During those spring and summer months he taught naginata to women and children in [[Aizuwakamatsu Castle|Aizuwakamatsu castle]], as well as capturing the voyeurs of the women's bathroom.\n\n=== The civil war ===\nHer martial figure is linked to the time of the [[Boshin War|Boshin war]], whose war events saw two adverse factions oppose in a civil conflict: the loyal supporters of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] and the advocates of the restoration of the [[Emperor Meiji|Meiji emperor]], whose results were favorable to the latter would have brought the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]] to the end of the 19th century .\n\nDuring the conflict, Nakano Takeko worked in defense of the sh\u014dgun [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]] and took part in the [[Battle of Aizu]], in which she distinguished herself by fighting against a white weapon, brandishing a naginata, a Japanese intaed weapon. In the clash with the overwhelming [[Japanese Imperial forces|imperial forces]], together with her mother and sister, she was head of an ''ad hoc'' body of female warriors.\n\nThe {{nihongo|[[J\u014dshitai]]|\u5a18\u5b50\u968a|Girls's Army}} was formed by these women: \n[[File:Hirata Kocho and onna-bugeisha.jpg|thumb|Hirata Koch\u014d and an other [[Onna-bugeisha]].]]\n\n* The leader of the group, Nakano Takeko, she was 22 years old at this time.\n* Takeko's mother and sister, Kouko and Yuko. At this time Kouko was 40s and Yuko 16 years old.\n* Hirata Koch\u014d and younger sister Hirata Yoshi.\n* Yoda Kikuko and the mother or older sister Yoda Mariko.\n* The famous female warrior, [[Niijima Yae|Yamamoto Yaeko]].\n* Okamura Sakiko and older sister Okamura Makiko.\n* A unnamed woman who was Watashi's concubine.\n* Jinbo Yukiko.\n* The students of ''Monna naginata dojo'' Monna Rieko, Saigo Tomiko and Nagai Sadako.\n* The younger sister of Hara Gor\u014d.\n* Kawahara Asako and Koike Chiyoku.\n\nThrough rain and sleet, the women went into battle autonomously and independently, since the ancient officials of Aizu, in particular [[Kayano Gonbei]], did not allow them to wars, officially, as part of the army of domination. This unit was later retroactively given the name of a ''female army'' ( \u5a18\u5b50 \u968a ''J\u014dshitai'' <sup>?</sup> ). It was [[Furuya Sakuzaemon]], the commander of Aizu's troops, who designated her as the leader of the samurai women the day before her death.\n\n=== Death ===\nDuring the defense, at the [[Yanagi bridge]] in the area of Nishibata, in [[Fukushima Prefecture|Fukushima]], early in the morning she launched a charge to the firearm against the firearms of the huge troops of the Japanese imperial army of the domain of \u014cgaki, commanded by a shaguma . \u00a0When the adversaries realized, surprisingly, that they were female soldiers, an order was immediately given to keep the fire in order not to kill them. \u00a0This hesitation allowed the warriors to approach the enemies and face them with the white weapon: several were killed, before the fire resumed. The enemy was impressed by the lethal fury of the women of Aizu. Nakano Takeko herself killed five or six of them with naginata shots before succumbing, shot to the chest by a rifle shot that would have been fatal for her.\n\nDying, rather than letting the enemy take possession of her corpse to wreak havoc, cutting her head off to use it as a war trophy, she asked her sister Y\u016bko to behead her herself to prevent her capture and honorable burial. Y\u016bko requested the assistance of an Aizu soldier, [[Ueno Yoshisabur\u014d]], for the beheading. Hirata Koch\u014d, the foster younger sister who had studied naginata and calligraphy as Daisuke's foster daughter, was saved by Jinbo Yukiko in the battle and, being the vice-commander, assumed command of the troop to defend Aizuwakamatsu Castle after she was killed, while the deputy became Yamamoto Yaeko. After the battle K\u014dko and Y\u016bko entered [[Tsuruga Castle|Tsuruga castle]] and joined Yamamoto Yae.\n\nAfter the battle, detached from the body, the head of Nakano Takeko was thus moved by her sister to the nearby H\u014dkai temple of her family, modern Aizubange, in the prefecture of Fukushima, and buried with honor by the priest under a pine tree. Her weapon was donated to the temple.<ref name=\"yamakawa1\">Yamakawa Kenjir\u014d; Munekawa Toraji (1926). ''Hosh\u016b Aizu Byakkotai j\u016bky\u016bshi-den''.
