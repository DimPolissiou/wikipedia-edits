His notable films include ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961), ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), ''[[Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975), ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979), ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'' (1981), ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Congressman]]'' (2016). For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan. [[Bo Derek]] writes in her autobiography that \"there was an ongoing contest between [[John Derek|John]] [Derek] and George Hamilton as to who was tanner\".<ref>Derek, Bo (with Mark Seal) (2002), ''Riding Lessons: Everything That Matters in Life I Learned from Horses'', ReganBooks HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0060394374}}, p.212</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHamilton was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the middle of three boys with an older maternal half brother and a younger full brother, and lived in [[Blytheville, Arkansas]]. He is the eldest son of bandleader [[George Hamilton (musician)|George \"Spike\" Hamilton]].<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/43/George-Hamilton.html George Hamilton Biography (1939\u2013)<!-- Bot generated title -->] from filmreference.com</ref>\n\nHis stepfathers were Carleton Hunt and Jesse Spalding; his stepmother was June Howard, with whom Hamilton said he had an affair when he was 12 years old which was shortly after she married his father.<ref>Beifuss, John.

November 4, 2008</ref>\n\nHamilton attended the [[Hackley School]] in [[Tarrytown, New York]], graduating in 1957.<ref name=\"PAGESIX\">Burroni, Christine, [https://pagesix.com/20George Hamilton reminisces about his high school days\"], ''pagesix.com'', October 21, 2017</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Early appearances===\nHamilton's first roles were in TV. He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1966 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette (film)|Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (1978 film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, the Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (TV movie)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the mini series ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (film)|Amore]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''Bonnie'', ''Diagnosis Murder'', ''Hart to Hart'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.

His notable films include ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961), ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), ''[[Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975), ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979), ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'' (1981), ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Congressman]]'' (2016). For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan. [[Bo Derek]] writes in her autobiography that \"there was an ongoing contest between [[John Derek|John]] [Derek] and George Hamilton as to who was tanner\".<ref>Derek, Bo (with Mark Seal) (2002), ''Riding Lessons: Everything That Matters in Life I Learned from Horses'', ReganBooks HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0060394374}}, p.212</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHamilton was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the middle of three boys with an older maternal half brother and a younger full brother, and lived in [[Blytheville, Arkansas]]. He is the eldest son of bandleader [[George Hamilton (musician)|George \"Spike\" Hamilton]].<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/43/George-Hamilton.html George Hamilton Biography (1939\u2013)<!-- Bot generated title -->] from filmreference.com</ref>\n\nHis stepfathers were Carleton Hunt and Jesse Spalding; his stepmother was June Howard, with whom Hamilton said he had an affair when he was 12 years old which was shortly after she married his father.<ref>Beifuss, John.

He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1966 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette (film)|Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (1978 film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, the Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (TV movie)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the mini series ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (film)|Amore]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''Bonnie'', ''Diagnosis Murder'', ''Hart to Hart'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker.

Dunigan''' (born August 2, 1955) is an American actor who is best known for having played the lead role of Captain Jonathan Power in ''[[Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future]]''. He also played con-man 1st Lt. [[Templeton Peck|Templeton \"The Face-Man\" Peck]] in the pilot for the 1980s hit ''[[The A-Team]]'', but was replaced by [[Dirk Benedict]] for the series. The reason given was that Dunigan was too young for the role, although series creators [[Frank Lupo]] and [[Stephen J. Cannell]] had wanted Benedict from the start, but were overridden by the network executives.<ref>{{cite news|author=Jenny Cullen|title=Sex and politics as coonskin hero returns from the Alamo|publisher=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|Sunday Mail]] (AUS)|date=1988-12-11}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nDunigan was born in [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]] to the late Robert S.

Davis was a graduate of the [[United States Military Academy|U.S. Military Academy]], and colonel of a volunteer regiment during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. He had also been a [[United States Senator]] from [[Mississippi]] and [[United States Secretary of War|U.S. Secretary of War]] under President [[Franklin Pierce]]. On March 1, 1861, on behalf of the Confederate government, Davis assumed control of the military situation at [[Charleston, South Carolina]], where South Carolina state militia besieged [[Fort Sumter]] in Charleston harbor, held by a small [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] garrison. By March 1861, the Provisional Confederate Congress expanded the provisional forces and established a more permanent Confederate States Army.\n\nAn accurate count of the total number of individuals who served in the Confederate Army is not possible due to incomplete and destroyed Confederate records; estimates of the number of individual Confederate soldiers are between 750,000 and 1,000,000 men. This does not include an unknown number of [[slavery in the United States|slaves]] who were pressed into performing various tasks for the army, such as construction of fortifications and defenses or driving wagons.<ref>Records of the number of individuals who served in the [[United States Army]] are more extensive and reliable, but still are not entirely accurate. Estimates of the number of individual Union soldiers range between 1,550,000 and 2,400,000, with a number between 2,000,000 and 2,200,000 most likely. Union Army records show slightly more than 2,677,000 enlistments but this number apparently includes many re-enlistments. These numbers do not include sailors who served in [[United States Navy]] or [[United States Marine Corps]]. These figures represent the total number of individual soldiers who served at any time during the war, not the size of the army at any given date.</ref> Since these figures include estimates of the total number of individual soldiers who served at any time during the war, they do not represent the size of the army at any given date. These numbers do not include men who served in [[Confederate States Navy]].\n\nAlthough most of the soldiers who fought in the American Civil War were volunteers, both sides by 1862 resorted to conscription, primarily as a means to force men to register and to volunteer. In the absence of exact records, estimates of the percentage of Confederate soldiers who were draftees are about double the 6 percent of United States soldiers who were conscripts.<ref>Albert Burton Moore, ''Conscription and Conflict in the Confederacy'' (1924).</ref>\n\nConfederate casualty figures also are incomplete and unreliable. The best estimates of the number of deaths of Confederate soldiers are about 94,000 killed or mortally wounded in battle, 164,000 deaths from disease and between 26,000 and 31,000 deaths in United States prison camps. One estimate of the Confederate wounded, which is considered incomplete, is 194,026. These numbers do not include men who died from other causes such as accidents, which would add several thousand to the death toll.<ref>In comparison, the best estimates of the number of deaths of United States soldiers are 110,100 killed or mortally wounded in battle, 224,580 deaths from disease and 30,192 deaths in Confederate prison camps, although some historians also dispute these figures. The best conjecture for United States Army wounded is 275,175.</ref>\n\nThe main Confederate armies, the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] under [[General (CSA)|General]] [[Robert E. Lee]] and the remnants of the [[Army of Tennessee]] and various other units under General [[Joseph E. Johnston]], surrendered to the U.S. on April 9, 1865 (officially April 12), and April 18, 1865 (officially April 26). Other Confederate forces surrendered between April 16, 1865, and June 28, 1865.<ref>Confederate forces at [[Mobile, Alabama]], and [[Columbus, Georgia]], also had already surrendered on April 14, 1865, and April 16, 1865, respectively. U.S. and Confederate units fought a [[Battle of Columbus (1865)|battle at Columbus, Georgia]], before the surrender on April 16, 1865, and a small final battle at [[Battle of Palmito Ranch|Palmito Ranch]], Texas, on May 12, 1865. In areas more distant from the main theaters of operations, Confederate forces in Alabama and Mississippi under [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lieutenant General]] [[Richard Taylor (general)|Richard Taylor]], in Arkansas under [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brigadier General]] [[M. Jeff Thompson]], in Louisiana and Texas under General [[E. Kirby Smith]] and in [[Indian Territory in the American Civil War|Indian Territory]] under Brigadier General [[Stand Watie]] surrendered on May 4, 1865, May 12, 1865, May 26, 1865 (officially June 2, 1865), and June 28, 1865, respectively.</ref> By the end of the war, more than 100,000 Confederate soldiers had deserted,<ref>{{cite book|author=Eric Foner|title=Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863\u20131877|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cwVkgrvctCcC&pg=PA15|year=1988|page=15|isbn=9780062035868}}</ref> and some estimates put the number as high as one third of Confederate soldiers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hamner |first1=Christopher |title=Deserters in the Civil War {{!}} Teachinghistory.org |url=http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/23934 |website=teachinghistory.org |accessdate=3 August 2018 |ref=Historian Christopher Hamner teaches at George Mason University, serves as Editor-in-Chief of Papers of the War Department, 1784\u20131800, and is the author of Enduring Battle: American Soldiers in Three Wars, 1776\u20131945. |language=en}}</ref> The Confederacy's government effectively dissolved when it fled Richmond in April and exerted no control over the remaining armies.\n\n==Prelude==\nBy the time [[Abraham Lincoln]] took office as [[President of the United States]] on March 4, 1861, the seven seceding slave states had formed the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]].

It was to consist of a large provisional force to exist only in time of war and a small permanent regular army. The provisional, volunteer army was established by an act of the [[Provisional Confederate Congress]] passed on February 28, 1861, one week before the act which established the permanent regular army organization, passed on March 6. Although the two forces were to exist concurrently, little was done to organize the Confederate regular army.<ref name=\"Allardice2008\">{{cite book|author=Bruce S.

Virtually all regular, volunteer, and conscripted men preferred to enter this organization since officers could achieve a higher rank in the Provisional Army than they could in the Regular Army. If the war had ended successfully for them, the Confederates intended that the PACS would be disbanded, leaving only the ACSA.<ref name=\"Eicher7066\"/>\n* The '''Army of the Confederate States of America''' ('''ACSA''') was the regular army and was authorized to include 15,015 men, including 744 officers, but this level was never achieved. The men serving in the highest rank as Confederate States generals, such as [[Samuel Cooper (general)|Samuel Cooper]] and [[Robert E. Lee]], were enrolled in the ACSA to ensure that they outranked all militia officers.<ref name=Eicher7066/> ACSA ultimately existed only on paper. The organization of the ACSA did not proceed beyond the appointment and confirmation of some officers. Three state regiments were later denominated \"Confederate\" regiments but this appears to have had no practical effect on the organization of a regular Confederate Army and no real effect on the regiments themselves.\n\nMembers of all the [[military forces of the Confederate States]] (the army, the navy, and the marine corps) are often referred to as \"Confederates\", and members of the Confederate army were referred to as \"Confederate soldiers\". Supplementing the Confederate army were the various state militias of the Confederacy:\n* Confederate States '''State Militias''' were organized and commanded by the state governments, similar to those authorized by the United States' [[Militia Act of 1792]].\n\n===Control and conscription===\n{{Main|Confederate Conscription Acts 1862-1864}}\n[[File:Resistance to Confederate conscription.jpg|thumb|left|A cartoon from the war, showing the Confederates forcibly drafting a Unionist man into the Confederate army.

The Confederate Congress gave control over military operations, and authority for mustering state forces and volunteers to the President of the Confederate States of America on February 28, 1861, and March 6, 1861.

One instance occurred in late 1862 with Lee's invasion of [[Maryland]], coincident with two other actions: Bragg's invasion of [[Kentucky]] and [[Earl Van Dorn]]'s advance against [[Corinth, Mississippi]]. All three initiatives were unsuccessful, however. Georgia Governor [[Joseph E. Brown]] was an extreme case of a Southern States Rights advocate asserting control over Confederate soldiers: he defied the Confederate government's wartime policies and resisted the military draft.

Lee, [[Albert Sidney Johnston]], [[James Longstreet]]) and even President Jefferson Davis, were former U.S. Army and, in smaller numbers, U.S. Navy officers who had been opposed to, disapproved of, or were at least unenthusiastic about secession, but resigned their U.S. commissions upon hearing that their states had left the Union. They felt that they had no choice but to help defend their homes. President Abraham Lincoln was exasperated to hear of such men who professed to love their country but were willing to fight against it.\n\n===Personnel organization===\nAs in the [[Union Army|U.S. Army]], the Confederate Army's soldiers were organized by military specialty. The combat arms included infantry, cavalry, and artillery.\n\nAlthough fewer soldiers might comprise a squad or platoon, the smallest [[Infantry in the American Civil War|infantry maneuver unit]] in the Army was a company of 100 soldiers. Ten companies were organized into an infantry regiment, which theoretically had 1,000 men. In reality, as disease, desertions and casualties took their toll, and the common practice of sending replacements to form new regiments took hold, most regiments were greatly reduced in strength. By the mid-war, most regiments averaged 300\u2013400 men, with Confederate units slightly smaller on average than their U.S. counterparts. For example, at the pivotal [[Battle of Chancellorsville]], the average U.S. Army infantry regiment's strength was 433 men, versus 409 for Confederate infantry regiments.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/historicaltimesi00faus|title=Historical times illustrated encyclopedia of the Civil War|date=1986|publisher=Harper & Row|others=Faust, Patricia L., Delaney, Norman C., Frank and Virginia Williams Collection of Lincolniana (Mississippi State University.

They were generally referred by number and state, for example [[1st Texas Infantry|1st Texas]], [[12th Virginia Infantry|12th Virginia]]. To the extent the word \"[[battalion]]\" was used to describe a military unit, it referred to a multi-company task force of a regiment or a near-regimental size unit. Throughout the war, the Confederacy raised the equivalent of 1,010 regiments in all branches, including militias, versus 2,050 regiments for the U.S. Army.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Civil War dictionary|last=1921\u2013|first=Boatner, Mark Mayo|date=1959|publisher=D.

Occasionally, regiments would be transferred between brigades. Two to four brigades usually formed a [[Division (military)|division]]. Two to four divisions usually formed a [[corps]]. Two to four corps usually formed an army. Occasionally, a single corps might operate independently as if it were a small army. The Confederate States Army consisted of several field armies, named after their primary area of operation. The largest Confederate field army was the [[Army of Northern Virginia]], whose surrender at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox Courthouse]] in 1865 marked the end of major combat operations in the US Civil War.\n\n[[Company (military unit)|Companies]] were commanded by captains and had two or more lieutenants. Regiments were commanded by colonels. Lieutenant colonels were second in command. At least one major was next in command. Brigades were commanded by brigadier generals although casualties or other attrition sometimes meant that brigades would be commanded by senior colonels or even a lower grade officer. Barring the same type of circumstances which might leave a lower grade officer in temporary command, divisions were commanded by major generals and corps were commanded by lieutenant generals. A few corps commanders were never confirmed as lieutenant generals and exercised corps command for varying periods as major generals. Armies of more than one corps were commanded by (full) generals.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Corporal Artillery CS Army.jpg|Corporal of the Artillery division of the Confederate Army\nFile:AdamJSlemmerinConfederateBatteryAtWarringtonAcrossFromFortPickens1861.jpg|Confederate mortar crew at Warrington, Florida in 1861, across from Fort Pickens\nFile:ArtilleryCharleston1863.jpg|Confederate artillery at Charleston Harbor, 1863\nFile: History of the Doles-Cook brigade of northern Virginia, C.S.

General (CSA)|lieutenant general]], [[Maj. Gen. (CSA)|major general]], and [[Brigadier General (CSA)|brigadier general]]), but all wore the same insignia regardless of grade. This was a decision made early in the conflict. The Confederate Congress initially made the rank of brigadier general the highest rank. As the war progressed, the other general-officer ranks were quickly added, but no insignia for them was created. (Robert E. Lee was a notable exception to this. He chose to wear the rank insignia of a colonel.) Only seven men achieved the rank of (full) general;<ref name=\"confederate\"/> the highest-ranking (earliest date of rank) was [[Samuel Cooper (general)|Samuel Cooper]], Adjutant General and Inspector General of the Confederate States Army.\n\nOfficers' uniforms bore a braided design on the sleeves and [[kepi]], the number of adjacent strips (and therefore the width of the lines of the design) denoting rank. The color of the piping and kepi denoted the military branch. The braid was sometimes left off by officers since it made them conspicuous targets. The kepi was rarely used, the common slouch hat being preferred for its practicality in the Southern climate.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\"  style=\"margin:auto; width:100%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=11| '''Enlisted rank structure'''\n|-\n![[Sergeant Major]]\n![[Quartermaster Sergeant]]\n![[Ordnance Sergeant]]\n![[First Sergeant]]\n|-\n![[File:Confederate States of America Sergeant Major-Infantry.jpg|80px]]\n![[File:Confederate States of America Regimental Quartermaster Sergeant-Artillery.svg|80px]]\n![[File:Confederate States of America Ordnance Sergeant-Artillery.jpg|80px]]\n![[File:Confederate States of America First Sergeant.jpg|80px]]\n|-\n![[Sergeant]]\n![[Corporal]]\n![[Musician (rank)|Musician]]\n![[Private (rank)|Private]]\n|-\n![[File:Confederate States of America Sergeant-Artillery.svg|80px]]\n![[File:Confederate States of America Corporal-Cavalry.jpg|80px]]\n!no insignia\n!no insignia\n|}\n\nBranch colors were used for the color of chevrons\u2014blue for infantry, yellow for cavalry, and red for artillery. This could differ with some units, however, depending on available resources or the unit commander's desire. Cavalry regiments from Texas, for example, often used red insignia and at least one Texas infantry regiment used black.\n\nThe CSA differed from many contemporaneous armies in that all officers under the rank of [[brigadier general (CSA)|brigadier general]] were elected by the soldiers under their command. The Confederate Congress authorized the awarding of medals for courage and good conduct on October 13, 1862, but wartime difficulties prevented the procurement of the needed medals. To avoid postponing recognition for their valor, those nominated for the awards had their names placed on a [[Confederate Roll of Honor|Roll of Honor]], which would be read at the first dress parade after its receipt and be published in at least one newspaper in each state.\n\n===Armies and prominent leaders===\nThe C.S. Army was composed of independent armies and military departments that were constituted, renamed, and disbanded as needs arose, particularly in reaction to offensives launched by the [[Union (American Civil War)|United States]]. These major units were generally named after states or geographic regions (in comparison to the U.S. Army's custom of naming armies after rivers). Armies were usually commanded by [[Full General (CSA)#Major general|full generals]] (there were seven in the C.S. Army) or [[Lt. General (CSA)|lieutenant generals]].

F. Brandon<ref name=\"history-sites\"/>]]\n{{main|Confederate States of America#Transportation systems}}\n\nThe supply situation for most Confederate armies was dismal, even when they were victorious on the battlefield.  The central government was short of money so each state government had to supply its regiments.  The lack of central authority and the ineffective [[Confederate railroads in the American Civil War|railroads]], combined with the frequent unwillingness or inability of Southern state governments to provide adequate funding, were key factors in the Confederate army's demise. The Confederacy early on lost control of most of its major river and ocean ports to capture or blockade. The road system was poor, and it relied more and more on a heavily overburdened railroad system. U.S. forces destroyed track, engines, cars, bridges and telegraph lines as often as possible, knowing that new equipment was unavailable to the Confederacy.<ref>George Edgar Turner, ''Victory rode the rails: the strategic place of the railroads in the Civil War'' (1972)</ref> Occasional raids into the North were designed to bring back money and supplies. In 1864, the Confederates burned down [[Chambersburg]], a Pennsylvania city they had raided twice in the years before, due to its failure to pay an extortion demand.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 2163218|title = Chambersburg: Anatomy of a Confederate Reprisal|journal = The American Historical Review|volume = 96|issue = 2|pages = 432\u2013455|last1 = Smith|first1 = Everard H.|year = 1991|doi = 10.2307/2163218}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of severe supply problems, as well as the lack of textile factories in the Confederacy and the successful U.S. naval blockade of Southern ports, the typical Confederate soldier was rarely able to wear the standard regulation uniform, particularly as the war progressed. While on the march or in parade formation, Confederate armies often displayed a wide array of dress, ranging from faded, patched-together regulation uniforms; rough, homespun uniforms colored with homemade dyes such as [[Juglans cinerea|butternut]] (a yellow-brown color), and even soldiers in a hodgepodge of civilian clothing. After a successful battle, it was not unusual for victorious Confederate troops to procure [[U.S. Army]] uniform parts from captured supplies and dead U.S. soldiers; this would occasionally cause confusion in later battles and skirmishes.<ref>Steven G. Collins, \"System in the South: John W. Mallet, Josiah Gorgas, and uniform production at the confederate ordnance department.\" ''Technology and culture'' (1999) 40#3 pp: 517\u2013544 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/technology_and_culture/v040/40.3collins.html in Project MUSE].</ref>\n\nIndividual states were expected to supply their soldiers, which led to a lack of uniformity. Some states (such as North Carolina) were able to better supply their soldiers, while other states (such as Texas) were unable for various reasons to adequately supply their troops as the war continued.\n\nFurthermore, each state often had its uniform regulations and insignia, which meant that the \"standard\" Confederate uniform often featured a variety of differences based on the state the soldier came from. For example, uniforms for North Carolina regiments often featured a colored strip of cloth on their shoulders to designate what part of the service the soldier was in. Confederate soldiers also frequently suffered from inadequate supplies of shoes, tents, and other gear, and would be forced to innovate and make do with whatever they could scrounge from the local countryside. While Confederate officers were generally better-supplied and were normally able to wear a regulation officer's uniform, they often chose to share other hardships \u2013 such as the lack of adequate food \u2013 with their troops.\n\n[[File: Confederates marching through Frederick, MD in 1862.jpg|thumb|250px|Confederate troops marching south on N Market Street, [[Frederick, Maryland]], during the Civil War]]\n\nConfederate soldiers were also faced with inadequate food rations, especially as the war progressed. There was plenty of meat in the Confederacy. The unsolvable problem was shipping it to the armies, especially when Lee's army in Virginia was at the end of a long, tenuous supply line. United States victory at Vicksburg in 1863 shut off supplies from Texas and the west.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Vandiver | first1 = Frank E. | year = 1944 | title = Texas and the Confederate Army's Meat Problem | journal = Southwestern Historical Quarterly | volume = 47 | issue = 3| pages = 225\u2013233 | jstor=30236034}}</ref>\n\nBy 1863 Confederate generals such as [[Robert E. Lee]] often spent as much time and effort searching for food for their men as they did in planning strategy and tactics. Individual commanders often had to \"[[Foraging|beg, borrow or steal]]\" food and ammunition from whatever sources were available, including captured U.S. depots and encampments, and private citizens regardless of their loyalties. Lee's campaign against [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] and southern [[Pennsylvania]] (a rich agricultural region) was driven in part by his desperate need of supplies, especially food.<ref>Larry J. Daniel, ''Soldiering in the Army of Tennessee: A Portrait of Life in a Confederate Army'' (2003) ch 4 on inadequate rations</ref>\n\n[[William Tecumseh Sherman|General Sherman]]'s [[total warfare]] reduced the ability of the South to produce food and ship it to the armies or its cities. Coupled with the [[Union blockade|U.S. blockade of all ports]] the devastation of plantations, farms and railroads meant the Confederacy increasingly lost the capacity to feed its soldiers and civilians.\n\n==Native Americans and the Confederate army==\n{{main|Native Americans in the American Civil War}}\n\nNative Americans served in both the United States and Confederate military during the [[American Civil War]].<ref name=\"aa\"/><ref name=\"Native_American_Participation_Numbers\"/> They fought knowing they might jeopardize their freedom, unique cultures, and ancestral lands if they ended up on the losing side of the Civil War.<ref name=\"aa\"/><ref name=\"ac\"/> During the Civil War 28,693 Native Americans served in the U.S. and Confederate armies, participating in battles such as [[Battle of Pea Ridge|Pea Ridge]], [[Second Manassas]], [[Antietam]], [[Battle of Spotsylvania Courthouse|Spotsylvania]], [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]], and in Federal assaults on [[Siege of Petersburg|Petersburg]].<ref name=\"aa\"/><ref name=\"Native_American_Participation_Numbers\"/> Many Native American tribes, such as the Creek, the Cherokee, and the Choctaw, were slaveholders themselves, and thus, found a political and economic commonality with the Confederacy.<ref name=\"Native_American_Slave_Ownership\"/>\n\nAt the beginning of the war, [[Albert Pike]] was appointed as Confederate envoy to Native Americans. In this capacity he negotiated several treaties, one such treaty was the [[Treaty with Choctaws and Chickasaws]] conducted in July 1861. The treaty covered sixty-four terms covering many subjects like Choctaw and Chickasaw nation sovereignty, [[Confederate States of America]] citizenship possibilities, and an entitled delegate in the House of Representatives of the Confederate States of America. The [[Cherokee]], [[Choctaw]], [[Seminole]], [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]], and [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creek]] tribes were the only tribes to fight on the Confederate side. The [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] wanted to recruit Indians east of the Mississippi River in 1862, so they opened up a recruiting camp in [[Mobile, Alabama]] \"at the foot of Stone Street\".<ref name=\"j_matte1\"/> The ''Mobile Advertiser and Register'' would advertise for a chance at military service.\n\n{{quote|text=A Chance for Active Service.

Their zeal for the Confederate cause, however, began to evaporate when they found that neither arms nor pay had been arranged for them.

Maintaining the institution of slavery was the primary goal of the Confederacy's existence, and thus, using their slaves as soldiers was incongruous with that goal.  According to historian Paul D. Escott:\n\n{{quote|[F]or a great many of the most powerful southerners the idea of arming and freeing the slaves was repugnant because the protection of slavery had been and still remained the central core of Confederate purpose ... Slavery was the basis of the planter class's wealth, power, and position in society. The South's leading men had built their world upon slavery and the idea of voluntarily destroying that world, even in the ultimate crisis, was almost unthinkable to them.

At the end of the war 174,223 men of the Confederate forces surrendered to the [[Union Army]].<ref name=\"www1\"/><ref>Long, 1971, p. 711</ref>\n\nCompared to the Union Army at the time, the Confederate army was not very ethnically diverse. Ninety-one percent of Confederate soldiers were native-born white men and only 9% were foreign-born white men, Irishmen being the largest group with others including Germans, French, Mexicans, and British.  A small number of Asian men were forcibly inducted into the Confederate army against their will when they arrived in Louisiana from overseas.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Burke|last=Davis|title=Civil War: Strange and Fascinating Facts|publisher=Random House|date=1960}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Inglish |first=Patty |title=Chinese Soldiers Who Fought in the American Civil War for the Union and the Confederacy |date=July 8, 2015 |work=HubPages |quote=Interestingly, some Chinese were 'Shanghaied' into the Confederate Army in New Orleans when they disembarked ships coming into port.

Davis was a graduate of the [[United States Military Academy|U.S. Military Academy]], and colonel of a volunteer regiment during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. He had also been a [[United States Senator]] from [[Mississippi]] and [[United States Secretary of War|U.S. Secretary of War]] under President [[Franklin Pierce]]. On March 1, 1861, on behalf of the Confederate government, Davis assumed control of the military situation at [[Charleston, South Carolina]], where South Carolina state militia besieged [[Fort Sumter]] in Charleston harbor, held by a small [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] garrison. By March 1861, the Provisional Confederate Congress expanded the provisional forces and established a more permanent Confederate States Army.\n\nAn accurate count of the total number of individuals who served in the Confederate Army is not possible due to incomplete and destroyed Confederate records; estimates of the number of individual Confederate soldiers are between 750,000 and 1,000,000 men. This does not include an unknown number of [[slavery in the United States|slaves]] who were pressed into performing various tasks for the army, such as construction of fortifications and defenses or driving wagons.<ref>Records of the number of individuals who served in the [[United States Army]] are more extensive and reliable, but still are not entirely accurate. Estimates of the number of individual Union soldiers range between 1,550,000 and 2,400,000, with a number between 2,000,000 and 2,200,000 most likely. Union Army records show slightly more than 2,677,000 enlistments but this number apparently includes many re-enlistments. These numbers do not include sailors who served in [[United States Navy]] or [[United States Marine Corps]]. These figures represent the total number of individual soldiers who served at any time during the war, not the size of the army at any given date.</ref> Since these figures include estimates of the total number of individual soldiers who served at any time during the war, they do not represent the size of the army at any given date. These numbers do not include men who served in [[Confederate States Navy]].\n\nAlthough most of the soldiers who fought in the American Civil War were volunteers, both sides by 1862 resorted to conscription, primarily as a means to force men to register and to volunteer. In the absence of exact records, estimates of the percentage of Confederate soldiers who were draftees are about double the 6 percent of United States soldiers who were conscripts.<ref>Albert Burton Moore, ''Conscription and Conflict in the Confederacy'' (1924).</ref>\n\nConfederate casualty figures also are incomplete and unreliable. The best estimates of the number of deaths of Confederate soldiers are about 94,000 killed or mortally wounded in battle, 164,000 deaths from disease and between 26,000 and 31,000 deaths in United States prison camps. One estimate of the Confederate wounded, which is considered incomplete, is 194,026. These numbers do not include men who died from other causes such as accidents, which would add several thousand to the death toll.<ref>In comparison, the best estimates of the number of deaths of United States soldiers are 110,100 killed or mortally wounded in battle, 224,580 deaths from disease and 30,192 deaths in Confederate prison camps, although some historians also dispute these figures. The best conjecture for United States Army wounded is 275,175.</ref>\n\nThe main Confederate armies, the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] under [[General (CSA)|General]] [[Robert E. Lee]] and the remnants of the [[Army of Tennessee]] and various other units under General [[Joseph E. Johnston]], surrendered to the U.S. on April 9, 1865 (officially April 12), and April 18, 1865 (officially April 26). Other Confederate forces surrendered between April 16, 1865, and June 28, 1865.<ref>Confederate forces at [[Mobile, Alabama]], and [[Columbus, Georgia]], also had already surrendered on April 14, 1865, and April 16, 1865, respectively. U.S. and Confederate units fought a [[Battle of Columbus (1865)|battle at Columbus, Georgia]], before the surrender on April 16, 1865, and a small final battle at [[Battle of Palmito Ranch|Palmito Ranch]], Texas, on May 12, 1865. In areas more distant from the main theaters of operations, Confederate forces in Alabama and Mississippi under [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lieutenant General]] [[Richard Taylor (general)|Richard Taylor]], in Arkansas under [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brigadier General]] [[M. Jeff Thompson]], in Louisiana and Texas under General [[E. Kirby Smith]] and in [[Indian Territory in the American Civil War|Indian Territory]] under Brigadier General [[Stand Watie]] surrendered on May 4, 1865, May 12, 1865, May 26, 1865 (officially June 2, 1865), and June 28, 1865, respectively.</ref> By the end of the war, more than 100,000 Confederate soldiers had deserted,<ref>{{cite book|author=Eric Foner|title=Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863\u20131877|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cwVkgrvctCcC&pg=PA15|year=1988|page=15|isbn=9780062035868}}</ref> and some estimates put the number as high as one third of Confederate soldiers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hamner |first1=Christopher |title=Deserters in the Civil War {{!}} Teachinghistory.org |url=http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/23934 |website=teachinghistory.org |accessdate=3 August 2018 |ref=Historian Christopher Hamner teaches at George Mason University, serves as Editor-in-Chief of Papers of the War Department, 1784\u20131800, and is the author of Enduring Battle: American Soldiers in Three Wars, 1776\u20131945. |language=en}}</ref> The Confederacy's government effectively dissolved when it fled Richmond in April and exerted no control over the remaining armies.\n\n==Prelude==\nBy the time [[Abraham Lincoln]] took office as [[President of the United States]] on March 4, 1861, the seven seceding slave states had formed the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]].

It was to consist of a large provisional force to exist only in time of war and a small permanent regular army. The provisional, volunteer army was established by an act of the [[Provisional Confederate Congress]] passed on February 28, 1861, one week before the act which established the permanent regular army organization, passed on March 6.

The organization of the ACSA did not proceed beyond the appointment and confirmation of some officers.

Lee, [[Albert Sidney Johnston]], [[James Longstreet]]) and even President Jefferson Davis, were former U.S. Army and, in smaller numbers, U.S. Navy officers who had been opposed to, disapproved of, or were at least unenthusiastic about secession, but resigned their U.S. commissions upon hearing that their states had left the Union. They felt that they had no choice but to help defend their homes. President Abraham Lincoln was exasperated to hear of such men who professed to love their country but were willing to fight against it.\n\n===Personnel organization===\nAs in the [[Union Army|U.S. Army]], the Confederate Army's soldiers were organized by military specialty. The combat arms included infantry, cavalry, and artillery.\n\nAlthough fewer soldiers might comprise a squad or platoon, the smallest [[Infantry in the American Civil War|infantry maneuver unit]] in the Army was a company of 100 soldiers. Ten companies were organized into an infantry regiment, which theoretically had 1,000 men. In reality, as disease, desertions and casualties took their toll, and the common practice of sending replacements to form new regiments took hold, most regiments were greatly reduced in strength. By the mid-war, most regiments averaged 300\u2013400 men, with Confederate units slightly smaller on average than their U.S. counterparts. For example, at the pivotal [[Battle of Chancellorsville]], the average U.S. Army infantry regiment's strength was 433 men, versus 409 for Confederate infantry regiments.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/historicaltimesi00faus|title=Historical times illustrated encyclopedia of the Civil War|date=1986|publisher=Harper & Row|others=Faust, Patricia L., Delaney, Norman C., Frank and Virginia Williams Collection of Lincolniana (Mississippi State University.

They were generally referred by number and state, for example [[1st Texas Infantry|1st Texas]], [[12th Virginia Infantry|12th Virginia]]. To the extent the word \"[[battalion]]\" was used to describe a military unit, it referred to a multi-company task force of a regiment or a near-regimental size unit. Throughout the war, the Confederacy raised the equivalent of 1,010 regiments in all branches, including militias, versus 2,050 regiments for the U.S. Army.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Civil War dictionary|last=1921\u2013|first=Boatner, Mark Mayo|date=1959|publisher=D.

Occasionally, regiments would be transferred between brigades. Two to four brigades usually formed a [[Division (military)|division]]. Two to four divisions usually formed a [[corps]]. Two to four corps usually formed an army. Occasionally, a single corps might operate independently as if it were a small army. The Confederate States Army consisted of several field armies, named after their primary area of operation. The largest Confederate field army was the [[Army of Northern Virginia]], whose surrender at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox Courthouse]] in 1865 marked the end of major combat operations in the US Civil War.\n\n[[Company (military unit)|Companies]] were commanded by captains and had two or more lieutenants. Regiments were commanded by colonels. Lieutenant colonels were second in command. At least one major was next in command. Brigades were commanded by brigadier generals although casualties or other attrition sometimes meant that brigades would be commanded by senior colonels or even a lower grade officer. Barring the same type of circumstances which might leave a lower grade officer in temporary command, divisions were commanded by major generals and corps were commanded by lieutenant generals. A few corps commanders were never confirmed as lieutenant generals and exercised corps command for varying periods as major generals. Armies of more than one corps were commanded by (full) generals.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Corporal Artillery CS Army.jpg|Corporal of the Artillery division of the Confederate Army\nFile:AdamJSlemmerinConfederateBatteryAtWarringtonAcrossFromFortPickens1861.jpg|Confederate mortar crew at Warrington, Florida in 1861, across from Fort Pickens\nFile:ArtilleryCharleston1863.jpg|Confederate artillery at Charleston Harbor, 1863\nFile: History of the Doles-Cook brigade of northern Virginia, C.S.

General (CSA)|lieutenant general]], [[Maj. Gen. (CSA)|major general]], and [[Brigadier General (CSA)|brigadier general]]), but all wore the same insignia regardless of grade. This was a decision made early in the conflict. The Confederate Congress initially made the rank of brigadier general the highest rank. As the war progressed, the other general-officer ranks were quickly added, but no insignia for them was created. (Robert E. Lee was a notable exception to this. He chose to wear the rank insignia of a colonel.) Only seven men achieved the rank of (full) general;<ref name=\"confederate\"/> the highest-ranking (earliest date of rank) was [[Samuel Cooper (general)|Samuel Cooper]], Adjutant General and Inspector General of the Confederate States Army.\n\nOfficers' uniforms bore a braided design on the sleeves and [[kepi]], the number of adjacent strips (and therefore the width of the lines of the design) denoting rank. The color of the piping and kepi denoted the military branch. The braid was sometimes left off by officers since it made them conspicuous targets. The kepi was rarely used, the common slouch hat being preferred for its practicality in the Southern climate.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\"  style=\"margin:auto; width:100%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=11| '''Enlisted rank structure'''\n|-\n![[Sergeant Major]]\n![[Quartermaster Sergeant]]\n![[Ordnance Sergeant]]\n![[First Sergeant]]\n|-\n![[File:Confederate States of America Sergeant Major-Infantry.jpg|80px]]\n![[File:Confederate States of America Regimental Quartermaster Sergeant-Artillery.svg|80px]]\n![[File:Confederate States of America Ordnance Sergeant-Artillery.jpg|80px]]\n![[File:Confederate States of America First Sergeant.jpg|80px]]\n|-\n![[Sergeant]]\n![[Corporal]]\n![[Musician (rank)|Musician]]\n![[Private (rank)|Private]]\n|-\n![[File:Confederate States of America Sergeant-Artillery.svg|80px]]\n![[File:Confederate States of America Corporal-Cavalry.jpg|80px]]\n!no insignia\n!no insignia\n|}\n\nBranch colors were used for the color of chevrons\u2014blue for infantry, yellow for cavalry, and red for artillery. This could differ with some units, however, depending on available resources or the unit commander's desire. Cavalry regiments from Texas, for example, often used red insignia and at least one Texas infantry regiment used black.\n\nThe CSA differed from many contemporaneous armies in that all officers under the rank of [[brigadier general (CSA)|brigadier general]] were elected by the soldiers under their command. The Confederate Congress authorized the awarding of medals for courage and good conduct on October 13, 1862, but wartime difficulties prevented the procurement of the needed medals. To avoid postponing recognition for their valor, those nominated for the awards had their names placed on a [[Confederate Roll of Honor|Roll of Honor]], which would be read at the first dress parade after its receipt and be published in at least one newspaper in each state.\n\n===Armies and prominent leaders===\nThe C.S. Army was composed of independent armies and military departments that were constituted, renamed, and disbanded as needs arose, particularly in reaction to offensives launched by the [[Union (American Civil War)|United States]]. These major units were generally named after states or geographic regions (in comparison to the U.S. Army's custom of naming armies after rivers). Armies were usually commanded by [[Full General (CSA)#Major general|full generals]] (there were seven in the C.S. Army) or [[Lt. General (CSA)|lieutenant generals]].

The central government was short of money so each state government had to supply its regiments.  The lack of central authority and the ineffective [[Confederate railroads in the American Civil War|railroads]], combined with the frequent unwillingness or inability of Southern state governments to provide adequate funding, were key factors in the Confederate army's demise. The Confederacy early on lost control of most of its major river and ocean ports to capture or blockade. The road system was poor, and it relied more and more on a heavily overburdened railroad system. U.S. forces destroyed track, engines, cars, bridges and telegraph lines as often as possible, knowing that new equipment was unavailable to the Confederacy.<ref>George Edgar Turner, ''Victory rode the rails: the strategic place of the railroads in the Civil War'' (1972)</ref> Occasional raids into the North were designed to bring back money and supplies. In 1864, the Confederates burned down [[Chambersburg]], a Pennsylvania city they had raided twice in the years before, due to its failure to pay an extortion demand.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 2163218|title = Chambersburg: Anatomy of a Confederate Reprisal|journal = The American Historical Review|volume = 96|issue = 2|pages = 432\u2013455|last1 = Smith|first1 = Everard H.|year = 1991|doi = 10.2307/2163218}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of severe supply problems, as well as the lack of textile factories in the Confederacy and the successful U.S. naval blockade of Southern ports, the typical Confederate soldier was rarely able to wear the standard regulation uniform, particularly as the war progressed. While on the march or in parade formation, Confederate armies often displayed a wide array of dress, ranging from faded, patched-together regulation uniforms; rough, homespun uniforms colored with homemade dyes such as [[Juglans cinerea|butternut]] (a yellow-brown color), and even soldiers in a hodgepodge of civilian clothing. After a successful battle, it was not unusual for victorious Confederate troops to procure [[U.S. Army]] uniform parts from captured supplies and dead U.S. soldiers; this would occasionally cause confusion in later battles and skirmishes.<ref>Steven G. Collins, \"System in the South: John W. Mallet, Josiah Gorgas, and uniform production at the confederate ordnance department.\" ''Technology and culture'' (1999) 40#3 pp: 517\u2013544 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/technology_and_culture/v040/40.3collins.html in Project MUSE].</ref>\n\nIndividual states were expected to supply their soldiers, which led to a lack of uniformity. Some states (such as North Carolina) were able to better supply their soldiers, while other states (such as Texas) were unable for various reasons to adequately supply their troops as the war continued.\n\nFurthermore, each state often had its uniform regulations and insignia, which meant that the \"standard\" Confederate uniform often featured a variety of differences based on the state the soldier came from. For example, uniforms for North Carolina regiments often featured a colored strip of cloth on their shoulders to designate what part of the service the soldier was in. Confederate soldiers also frequently suffered from inadequate supplies of shoes, tents, and other gear, and would be forced to innovate and make do with whatever they could scrounge from the local countryside. While Confederate officers were generally better-supplied and were normally able to wear a regulation officer's uniform, they often chose to share other hardships \u2013 such as the lack of adequate food \u2013 with their troops.\n\n[[File: Confederates marching through Frederick, MD in 1862.jpg|thumb|250px|Confederate troops marching south on N Market Street, [[Frederick, Maryland]], during the Civil War]]\n\nConfederate soldiers were also faced with inadequate food rations, especially as the war progressed. There was plenty of meat in the Confederacy. The unsolvable problem was shipping it to the armies, especially when Lee's army in Virginia was at the end of a long, tenuous supply line. United States victory at Vicksburg in 1863 shut off supplies from Texas and the west.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Vandiver | first1 = Frank E. | year = 1944 | title = Texas and the Confederate Army's Meat Problem | journal = Southwestern Historical Quarterly | volume = 47 | issue = 3| pages = 225\u2013233 | jstor=30236034}}</ref>\n\nBy 1863 Confederate generals such as [[Robert E. Lee]] often spent as much time and effort searching for food for their men as they did in planning strategy and tactics. Individual commanders often had to \"[[Foraging|beg, borrow or steal]]\" food and ammunition from whatever sources were available, including captured U.S. depots and encampments, and private citizens regardless of their loyalties. Lee's campaign against [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] and southern [[Pennsylvania]] (a rich agricultural region) was driven in part by his desperate need of supplies, especially food.<ref>Larry J. Daniel, ''Soldiering in the Army of Tennessee: A Portrait of Life in a Confederate Army'' (2003) ch 4 on inadequate rations</ref>\n\n[[William Tecumseh Sherman|General Sherman]]'s [[total warfare]] reduced the ability of the South to produce food and ship it to the armies or its cities. Coupled with the [[Union blockade|U.S. blockade of all ports]] the devastation of plantations, farms and railroads meant the Confederacy increasingly lost the capacity to feed its soldiers and civilians.\n\n==Native Americans and the Confederate army==\n{{main|Native Americans in the American Civil War}}\n\nNative Americans served in both the United States and Confederate military during the [[American Civil War]].<ref name=\"aa\"/><ref name=\"Native_American_Participation_Numbers\"/> They fought knowing they might jeopardize their freedom, unique cultures, and ancestral lands if they ended up on the losing side of the Civil War.<ref name=\"aa\"/><ref name=\"ac\"/> During the Civil War 28,693 Native Americans served in the U.S. and Confederate armies, participating in battles such as [[Battle of Pea Ridge|Pea Ridge]], [[Second Manassas]], [[Antietam]], [[Battle of Spotsylvania Courthouse|Spotsylvania]], [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]], and in Federal assaults on [[Siege of Petersburg|Petersburg]].<ref name=\"aa\"/><ref name=\"Native_American_Participation_Numbers\"/> Many Native American tribes, such as the Creek, the Cherokee, and the Choctaw, were slaveholders themselves, and thus, found a political and economic commonality with the Confederacy.<ref name=\"Native_American_Slave_Ownership\"/>\n\nAt the beginning of the war, [[Albert Pike]] was appointed as Confederate envoy to Native Americans. In this capacity he negotiated several treaties, one such treaty was the [[Treaty with Choctaws and Chickasaws]] conducted in July 1861. The treaty covered sixty-four terms covering many subjects like Choctaw and Chickasaw nation sovereignty, [[Confederate States of America]] citizenship possibilities, and an entitled delegate in the House of Representatives of the Confederate States of America. The [[Cherokee]], [[Choctaw]], [[Seminole]], [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]], and [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creek]] tribes were the only tribes to fight on the Confederate side.

Webb Garrison, a Civil War historian, describes their response: when Confederate Brigadier General [[Albert Pike]] authorized the raising of regiments during the fall of 1860, Seminoles, Creeks, Chickasaws, Choctaws, and Cherokees responded with considerable enthusiasm. Their zeal for the Confederate cause, however, began to evaporate when they found that neither arms nor pay had been arranged for them.

Since these figures include estimates of the total number of individual soldiers who served in each army at any time during the war, they do not represent the size of the armies at any given date. Confederate casualty figures are as incomplete and unreliable as the figures on the number of Confederate soldiers. The best estimates of the number of deaths of Confederate soldiers appear to be about 94,000 killed or mortally wounded in battle, 164,000 deaths from disease and between 26,000 and 31,000 deaths in Union prison camps. In contrast, about 25,000 Union soldiers died as a result of accidents, drowning, murder, killed after capture, suicide, execution for various crimes, execution by the Confederates (64), sunstroke, other and not stated. Confederate casualties for all these reasons are unavailable. Since some Confederate soldiers would have died for these reasons, more total deaths and total casualties for the Confederacy must have occurred. One estimate of the Confederate wounded, which is considered incomplete, is 194,026; another is 226,000. At the end of the war 174,223 men of the Confederate forces surrendered to the [[Union Army]].<ref name=\"www1\"/><ref>Long, 1971, p. 711</ref>\n\nCompared to the Union Army at the time, the Confederate army was not very ethnically diverse. Ninety-one percent of Confederate soldiers were native-born white men and only 9% were foreign-born white men, Irishmen being the largest group with others including Germans, French, Mexicans, and British.  A small number of Asian men were forcibly inducted into the Confederate army against their will when they arrived in Louisiana from overseas.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Burke|last=Davis|title=Civil War: Strange and Fascinating Facts|publisher=Random House|date=1960}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Inglish |first=Patty |title=Chinese Soldiers Who Fought in the American Civil War for the Union and the Confederacy |date=July 8, 2015 |work=HubPages |quote=Interestingly, some Chinese were 'Shanghaied' into the Confederate Army in New Orleans when they disembarked ships coming into port.

It had a 9 hole golf course- eventually expanded to 18 holes. Within a year, the club went bankrupt. In 1911, the property was purchased and reopened as the current Glen Oak Country Club.<ref>http://www.greatthirdrail.org/stations/main/glenoak.html</ref>\n\nIn the past bordering the club to the north- which is the Prairie Path today, was an interurban train stop. Many members lived in Chicago and would take the train out of the city to this club. Upon exit, a carriage would take the members along Hill Ave to the club house.<ref>Document on wall of Glen Oak CC</ref>\n\nAlong with the golf course, it also has a swimming pool, and facility for trap shooting for member use on the club's south border. On the ninth hole, there is a Halfway House to refresh the players with drinks, beverages, and food. As the weather transitions from fall to winter many members change from golfing to The Skeet and Trap Club, which features a new remodeled Lodge area.\n\nOver the years, the club has been expanded and remodeled to the club it is today.\n\nSome of the famous people that have visited the club are famous athletes like MLB Players [[Jorge Soler]], [[Carlos Zambrano]], [[Michael Jordan]](basketball), [[Bobby Rahal]] (retired race car driver), [[Arnold Palmer]](golfer), and PGA Golfer [[Mark Wilson (golfer)|Mark Wilson]].\n\n==Golf==\n\nThe club mascot is Pinki - a former caddy of which there is a statue of in front of the club and a tournament named after him.

The Italian government tried to prosecute him for [[bigamy]], but failed because of his title.<ref>{{cite book |title=Itin\u00e9raire de l'ile de Sardaigne pour faire suite au Voyage en cette contr\u00e9e |publisher=Bocca |last=Ferrero della Marmora |first=Alberto |authorlink= |year=1860 |location=Turin |pages=[https://archive.org/details/itinrairedelile01dellgoog/page/n197 190]\u2013193 |url=https://archive.org/details/itinrairedelile01dellgoog }}</ref><ref>[[David Wallechinsky|Wallechinsky, David]], and [[Amy Wallace]] (2005), ''The New Book of Lists'', pp 383-384, {{ISBN|1-84195-719-4}}</ref>\nPassed kingdom to son Paolo in 1845; died 1849.<ref>{{cite book |title=Voyages en Corse, \u00e0 l'ile d'Elbe et en Sardaigne |last=Valery |first=Antoine-Claude Pasquin |authorlink= |year=1837 |location=Paris |volume=2 |page=9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iC4MAAAAYAAJ }}</ref><ref>\"The Island of Sardinia\", ''Blackwoods Edinburgh Magazine'', July 1849, p 43</ref><ref>Vuillier, Gaston (1896), ''The Forgotten Isles: Impressions of Travel in the Balearic Isles, Corsica and Sardinia'', trans.

FringeWare, an early attempt at [[ecommerce]] and [[online community]], published a popular \"[[magalog]]\" called [[FringeWare Review]], and a literary zine edited by Lebkowsky called [[Unshaved Truths]]. FringeWare's email list, called the FringeWare News Network, established an international following for the organization, which also opened a store in Austin, Texas.\n\nAlong with Nancy White, he co-hosts the ongoing Virtual Communities Conference, the Blog Conference, and the public Inkwell Conference at the seminal online community, the [[WELL (virtual community)|WELL]]. His weblog can be reached at [http://weblogsky.com Weblogsky.com]. He lives in [[Austin, Texas]].\n\n==Internet Advocacy==\nLebkowsky has a history of advocacy in support of a free and open Internet, and was a co-founder of [[EFF-Austin]], an organization formed to be a chapter of the national [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF). EFF-Austin became a separate organization with Lebkowsky as President. Lebkowsky coined the phrase \"Freedom to Connect,\" which became the name of an annual conference organized by [[David Isenberg]], as an alternative to the term \"network neutrality.\"\n\n==Early history==\nLebkowsky joined the WELL in 1990, and became a host or co-host of several forums on the conferencing system, including forums devoted to [[Factsheet Five]], where he had a brief stint as book review editor, and [[Mondo 2000]], where he wrote several articles and formed friendships with editors [[RU Sirius]] and [[Jude Milhon]]. Through the WELL, he also became associated with [[Howard Rheingold]] and [[Whole Earth Review]], the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], and [[boing boing]], where he was Associate Editor. He had early associations with staff at [[Wired Magazine]] and conducted a regular, weekly series of chats called [[Electronic Frontiers Forum]] at [[HotWired]]. He was a subdomain editor for the [[Millennium Whole Earth Catalog]] and, in 1996, became a community host at Howard Rheingold's [[Electric Minds]].\n\nHe has been interviewed about his pioneering work for the documentary [[Traceroute (film)|Traceroute]].\n\n==Whole Foods Market==\nIn 1997, he joined [[Whole Foods Market]] as its \"Internet guy,\" to evangelize internally for the Internet and help lead their web-based ecommerce efforts, which ended in 2000 with the collapse of the so-called \"Internet bubble.\" As Internet evangelist within the company, he advocated creation of online community at [[WholeFoods.com]], and was Interactive Community Director for the ecommerce site that launched in 1998 The community included [[WELL Engaged]] forums and regular realtime chats using the IRC-based [[Talk City]] system. When WholeFoods.com was replaced by the ambitious [[Whole People]], Lebkowsky moved to Colorado and helped manage technology for the new enterprise until the company ended the project following the \"[[dot-com bubble|dotcom bust]].\"\n\n==Web Development, Social Software, and Blogs==\nLebkowsky turned to web development, and formed [[Polycot Consulting]] with [[Jeff Kramer]] and [[Matt Sanders]] on September 12, 2001.

In 2005, with other members of the Digital Convergence Initiative, he worked on an installation intended for the then newly established [[South_by_Southwest]] Interactive trade show, which was referred to in planning stages as Futurama. Due to a lack of time and funds, the installation did not occur as planned, however from planning conversations, Lebkowsky had the idea for a think tank that produces ''events'' instead of white papers. With futurist Derek Woodgate and consultant David Demaris, he put this idea into practice, creating an installation called the DIY House of the Future for Maker Faire Austin in 2007. The installation was successful. \n\nIn a debriefing about the installation, a small group discussed the idea of doing more events focused on a future where everyone's home and experience could be self-configured. Lebkowsky tossed out the idea of \"pluralist utopias,\" which led to adoption of the portmanteau \"Plutopia.\"\n\nLebkowsky and Woodgate, partnering with Maggie Duval and Bon Davis, created an event company, Plutopia Productions. Plutopia produced four large events during SXSW Interactive in Austin, in 2008 at Scholz Garten, 2009 at Palmer Events Center, and 2010-2011 at the Mexican American Cultural Center.\n\nAligned with the 2011 event, Lebkowsky and producer Scoop Sweeney created a podcast called the Plutopia News Network.\n\nLebkowsky left Plutopia Productions, which later closed down.

He was a cofounder and an original board member of the [[Society for Participatory Medicine]], and currently manages the Society's social media presence. He formed an Austin-based social web consultancy, [[Social Web Strategies]], where he was principal from 2006 to 2009.

He has also been involved in Austin sustainability projects, including [[Austin EcoNetwork]], [[Austin Green Art]], [[Austin 350]], [[Solar Austin]], and the [[Center for Maximum Potential Building Systems]].\n\nIn 2009 he left Social Web Strategies and returned to web consulting and development.
