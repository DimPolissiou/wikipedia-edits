Gardner (boxer)|John L. Gardner]] and Noel Quarless, who held out the possibility of a future British heavyweight world champion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-41189207|title=Newport bench sleepover for boxer David Pearce statue bid|date=9 September 2017|publisher=|accessdate=20 November 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nDavid \"Bomber\" Pearce held the Welsh & British Heavyweight titles and secured a draw for the European Heavyweight Title [[EBU]]. In all, he won 17 (13 KO) of his 21 professional bouts, losing 3 with 1 drawn. He also won 2 (2 KO) of his 3 unsanctioned boxing bouts.\n\nPearce was seen as the first real Cruiserweight from Great Britain, but due to the BBBoC reluctance to recognise the division he was unable to fight for the WBA Cruiserweight title in 1983 after signing the contracts with Promoter [[Morgans Palle]].  Subsequently the BBBoC recognised the Cruiserweight division in 1985, 1 year after Pearce was forced to retire. Pearce was voted in the Ring Magazine Top Ten of unluckiest boxers never to win a World Title. \n\nPearce defeated a number of top heavyweights, by [[knockout]], in his career, including Mal Tetley, Bobby Hennessey, Winston Allen, Denton Ruddock, Theo Josephs, Larry McDonald, Ishaq Hussain, [[Dennis Andries]], [[Gordon Ferris]], Albert Syben, [[Neville Meade]] and [[John Tate (boxer)|John Tate]].\n\nThe tragedy of David \"Bomber\" Pearce is he was medically retired when just entering his physical prime.\n\n==Biographical details==\nPearce, born in [[Pillgwenlly]], [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], Gwent, was one of nine children: seven brothers, six of whom boxed professionally, and one who was a professional dancer, and two sisters.\n\nHe boxed out of St Josephs ABC in Pillgwenlly, Newport and coached junior and senior boxers at [[Alway]] ABC in Newport before his death.\n\nSoon after his final unsanctioned boxing fight in 1994, in [[California]], Pearce became seriously ill, in later years developing [[epilepsy]]. There was no specific evidence that this had been brought on by repeated blows to the head, but he immediately retired from boxing on medical advice. He died 7 years later, at the age of 41, due to SADS ([[Sudden Adult Death Syndrome]]). The ''[[South Wales Argus]]'' described him as \"Newport's most famous boxer.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/14949910.Pontypool_RFC_boss_slams_Newport_MP__39_s___39_misguided_view__39__over_dangers_of_concussion_in_rugby_and_boxing/|title=Pontypool RFC boss slams Newport MP's 'misguided view' over dangers of concussion in rugby and boxing|publisher=southwalesargus.co.uk|accessdate=14 January 2017}}</ref> Around 2,000 people attended his funeral in Newport at Stow Hill Cemetery.<ref>{{cite web| author=Martin Wade |url=http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/14719423.THE_LONG_VIEW__The_Newport_boxing_great_who_came_close_to_the_top_and_was_dubbed_the_city__39_s_own___39_Rocky__39_/|title=The Long View: The Newport boxing great who came close to the top and was dubbed the city's own 'Rocky'|publisher=southwalesargus.co.uk |date=3 September 2016 |accessdate=14 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Boxing career achievements==\n[[File:David Pearce Fight Picture.jpeg|thumb|right|[[List of British heavyweight boxing champions|British Heavyweight Title]], 1983]]\n\n* Pearce won the Welsh and British Heavyweight Boxing Titles in September 1983.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.johnnyowen.com/Recs/Hvy/david_pearce.html|title=David Pearce, British Heavyweight Champion|website=Johnnyowen.comBoxRec|accessdate=2016-07-18}}</ref>\n\n* David \"Bomber\" Pearce twice challenged for the prestigious [[EBU]] European Heavyweight Title.<ref name=\"boxrec.com1\">{{cite web|url=http://boxrec.com/boxer/2187|title=BoxRec - Lucien Rodriguez|publisher=BoxRec|accessdate=2016-07-18}}</ref>\n\n* Pearce was ranked as high as No.7 in the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] Heavyweight World rankings before his career was cut short.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=david+pearce+boxer&client=safari&hl=en-gb&prmd=inv&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjGs9DWqKPTAhXoI8AKHfbpAS4Q_AUIBygB&biw=320&bih=460&dpr=2#imgrc=Kg1bM-P4KFa7kM:|title=david pearce boxer - Google Search|website=www.google.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n* Pearce was ranked No.3 in the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] Cruiserweight Rankings after the Victory over Micheal \"Jack\" Johnson in 1984. <ref> https://boxrec.com/en/proboxer/24030 </ref>\n\n* Pearce was due to fight [[Buster Douglas]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]], USA but was pulled out whilst warming up in the changing room on 3 hrs notice [[Donnie Long]], replaced Pearce.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxrec.com/boxer/584 |title=James Douglas |website=BoxRec |date= |accessdate=2016-07-18}}</ref>\n\n*David Pearce Vs [[Leon Spinks]] was called off and a new opponent found on 24 hrs notice, even though contracts were signed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxrec.com/boxer/584 |title=James Douglas |publisher=BoxRec |date= |accessdate=2016-07-18}}</ref>\n\n* David Pearce was medically retired in 1984.

In all, he won 17 (13 KO) of his 21 professional bouts, losing 3 with 1 drawn. He also won 2 (2 KO) of his 3 unsanctioned boxing bouts.\n\nPearce was seen as the first real Cruiserweight from Great Britain, but due to the BBBoC reluctance to recognise the division he was unable to fight for the WBA Cruiserweight title in 1983 after signing the contracts with Promoter [[Morgans Palle]].  Subsequently the BBBoC recognised the Cruiserweight division in 1985, 1 year after Pearce was forced to retire. Pearce was voted in the Ring Magazine Top Ten of unluckiest boxers never to win a World Title. \n\nPearce defeated a number of top heavyweights, by [[knockout]], in his career, including Mal Tetley, Bobby Hennessey, Winston Allen, Denton Ruddock, Theo Josephs, Larry McDonald, Ishaq Hussain, [[Dennis Andries]], [[Gordon Ferris]], Albert Syben, [[Neville Meade]] and [[John Tate (boxer)|John Tate]].\n\nThe tragedy of David \"Bomber\" Pearce is he was medically retired when just entering his physical prime.\n\n==Biographical details==\nPearce, born in [[Pillgwenlly]], [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], Gwent, was one of nine children: seven brothers, six of whom boxed professionally, and one who was a professional dancer, and two sisters.\n\nHe boxed out of St Josephs ABC in Pillgwenlly, Newport and coached junior and senior boxers at [[Alway]] ABC in Newport before his death.\n\nSoon after his final unsanctioned boxing fight in 1994, in [[California]], Pearce became seriously ill, in later years developing [[epilepsy]]. There was no specific evidence that this had been brought on by repeated blows to the head, but he immediately retired from boxing on medical advice. He died 7 years later, at the age of 41, due to SADS ([[Sudden Adult Death Syndrome]]).

The mezzanine in what is now the southern half of the station was originally the northern one. A second southern mezzanine was isolated and closed off when the original southern half of the station was closed to make way for the West End Line.

One trackway merges with the southbound local track, and the other two trackways are south of the tracks that ramp up to the [[BMT West End Line]]. The triple trackway ramps down to a lower level, under the mainline tracks, and curves slightly east before ending. On the main track level, a [[Bellmouth (railroad terminology)|bellmouth]] going east is visible from a Manhattan-bound local train,<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPjuw5I22To ''The bellmouth can be seen at 58 seconds (0:58) into this video, just before the 36th Street Station.''</ref> just south of this station. When the subway was planned as part of the Triborough System, use of the South Brooklyn cut was not anticipated, and instead a four-track subway was to be built in 40th Street to reach the equivalent of the Culver and West End lines.

Situated in the region of [[South West England]], it is a maritime county. Like neighbouring [[Cornwall]] to the west, [[Devon]] is disadvantaged economically compared to other parts of southern England, owing to the decline of a number of core industries, notably fishing, mining and farming. Consequently, most of Devon has qualified for the [[European Community]]'s [[Objective 2]] status, particularly around [[Exmoor]], [[Bideford Bay]] and the [[Hartland Point]] peninsula which is somewhat cut off from industrial Britain due to poor road and rail transport links. These areas of North Devon are, however, only around {{convert|50|mi|km}} by boat from [[Swansea]] in Wales. A proposal which has the backing of both the [[Welsh Assembly Government]] and the [[South West Regional Assembly]], as well as [[Devon County Council]], is a year-round ferry service from either [[Ilfracombe]] or Bideford to Swansea, which it is hoped would stimulate economic growth in both South West Wales and the North coast of Devon and Cornwall.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nThe [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth crisis|2001 UK foot and mouth crisis]] harmed the farming community severely.<ref>''In Devon, the county council estimated that 1,200 jobs would be lost in agriculture and ancillary rural industries'' \u2014 [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200001/cmhansrd/vo010425/debtext/10425-17.htm#column_357 ''Hansard'', 25 April 2001]</ref>\n\nThe attractive lifestyle of the area is drawing in new industries which are not heavily dependent upon geographical location{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}; [[Dartmoor]], for instance, has recently seen a significant rise in the percentage of its inhabitants involved in the financial services sector. In 2003, the [[Met Office]], the UK's national and international weather service, moved to Exeter.\nDevon is one of the rural counties, with the advantages and challenges characteristic of these. Despite this, the county's economy is also heavily influenced by its two main urban centres, Plymouth and Exeter.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Nearly half of the holdings of the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] are in Devon, including a large area of farmland.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\n[[File:HMNB Devonport.jpg|250px|thumb|View of HMNB Devonport, the naval base in [[Plymouth, Devon|Plymouth]]]]\nSince the rise of seaside resorts with the arrival of the railways in the 19th century, Devon's economy has been heavily reliant on tourism.  The county's economy has followed the declining trend of British seaside resorts since the mid 20th century, with some recent revival.  This revival has been aided by the designation of much of Devon's countryside and coastline as the [[Dartmoor]] and [[Exmoor]] national parks, and the [[Jurassic Coast]] and [[Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape]] World Heritage Sites. In 2004 the county's tourist revenue was \u00a31.2 billion.<!-- Should try to put this in context of total Devon economy -- the GVA is around 9 billion, but I don't know enough about economic statistics to know if it's valid to compare the two? --><ref>Devon County Council, 2005.

The [[Wrigley Company]] (chewing gum) and [[HMNB Devonport]] (the largest naval base in western Europe) are in Plymouth. [[Torquay]] was home to [[Beverage Brands]], the producers of [[WKD Original Vodka]].

Situated in the region of [[South West England]], it is a maritime county. Like neighbouring [[Cornwall]] to the west, [[Devon]] is disadvantaged economically compared to other parts of southern England, owing to the decline of a number of core industries, notably fishing, mining and farming. Consequently, most of Devon has qualified for the [[European Community]]'s [[Objective 2]] status, particularly around [[Exmoor]], [[Bideford Bay]] and the [[Hartland Point]] peninsula which is somewhat cut off from industrial Britain due to poor road and rail transport links. These areas of North Devon are, however, only around {{convert|50|mi|km}} by boat from [[Swansea]] in Wales. A proposal which has the backing of both the [[Welsh Assembly Government]] and the [[South West Regional Assembly]], as well as [[Devon County Council]], is a year-round ferry service from either [[Ilfracombe]] or Bideford to Swansea, which it is hoped would stimulate economic growth in both South West Wales and the North coast of Devon and Cornwall.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nThe [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth crisis|2001 UK foot and mouth crisis]] harmed the farming community severely.<ref>''In Devon, the county council estimated that 1,200 jobs would be lost in agriculture and ancillary rural industries'' \u2014 [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200001/cmhansrd/vo010425/debtext/10425-17.htm#column_357 ''Hansard'', 25 April 2001]</ref>\n\nThe attractive lifestyle of the area is drawing in new industries which are not heavily dependent upon geographical location{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}; [[Dartmoor]], for instance, has recently seen a significant rise in the percentage of its inhabitants involved in the financial services sector. In 2003, the [[Met Office]], the UK's national and international weather service, moved to Exeter.\nDevon is one of the rural counties, with the advantages and challenges characteristic of these. Despite this, the county's economy is also heavily influenced by its two main urban centres, Plymouth and Exeter.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Nearly half of the holdings of the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] are in Devon, including a large area of farmland.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\n[[File:HMNB Devonport.jpg|250px|thumb|View of HMNB Devonport, the naval base in [[Plymouth, Devon|Plymouth]]]]\nSince the rise of seaside resorts with the arrival of the railways in the 19th century, Devon's economy has been heavily reliant on tourism.  The county's economy has followed the declining trend of British seaside resorts since the mid 20th century, with some recent revival.  This revival has been aided by the designation of much of Devon's countryside and coastline as the [[Dartmoor]] and [[Exmoor]] national parks, and the [[Jurassic Coast]] and [[Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape]] World Heritage Sites. In 2004 the county's tourist revenue was \u00a31.2 billion.<!-- Should try to put this in context of total Devon economy -- the GVA is around 9 billion, but I don't know enough about economic statistics to know if it's valid to compare the two? --><ref>Devon County Council, 2005.

In 1982, Filmation carried the show over to the [[United States]] for [[Television syndication|syndication]], and as a summer replacement in [[NBC]]'s Saturday morning children's programming.<ref>Lenburg, Jeff, ''Encyclopedia of Animated Cartoons'', Second Edition, 1999.</ref> It was the last first-run series produced by [[Filmation Associates]] to air on NBC.\n\n==Overview==\nSport Billy was originally a European [[comic]] character and it already had a presence in [[Europe]] and parts of [[Latin America]]. '''Sport Billy Productions''', owners of the Sport Billy franchise, licensed the property to the [[United States|American]] studio Filmation so it could create a cartoon based on the character. As a European character, Sport Billy's main sport was [[association football|soccer]], and this was reflected in the introductory sequence of the Filmation program.\n\nSport Billy was adopted by [[FIFA]] as the Fair Play Mascot for FIFA World Cups, and a [[trophy]] of the character was presented to the most sporting team at each [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]. The character was internationally used as a [[mascot]] in many sporting youth programs, for the purpose of promoting [[sportmanship|sportsmanship and fair play]] .\n\nThe series consisted of 26 episodes.

Sport Billy was voiced by Lane Scheimer, the son of producer [[Lou Scheimer]], who voiced the Master Sports Computer and Queen Vanda's Computer. Lilly and Queen Vanda were voiced by [[Joyce Bulifant]], Willy, Sporticus XI and Sipe were voiced by [[Frank Welker]], and Queen Pandusa was voiced by Jay Scheimer.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe story revolves around a young boy named Sport Billy who is from the planet Olympus (a [[Counter-Earth|twin of Earth]] on the opposite side of the Sun) which is populated by athletic god-like beings. Billy himself has a magic size-changing gym bag - the Omni-Sack - which produces various tools as he needs them. He travels to Earth on a mission to promote teamwork and sportsmanship. Described by the show's theme song as a \"hero from another planet\", Billy battles the evil Queen Vanda and her [[gnome]]-like [[henchman]], Sipe. Vanda's mission is to destroy all [[sports]] in the galaxy since fairness disgusts her.\n\nBilly is assisted by two faithful companions, a girl named Lilly and a talking dog named Willy. The trio travels around in a [[time travel]]ing [[spacecraft|spaceship]], which is mounted on two rocket engines and resembles a giant wind-up clock, complete with a ringing bell.
