The ad, which features a woman with a fair complexion being touched by a man, was accompanied by a headline which read, \"A skin you love to touch.\" The slogan became so popular that Woodbury used it until the 1940s. The body copy presented Woodbury Soap as a product which would beautify skin and foster charm. In addition to its utilization of sex appeal, the advertisement is also a prime example of Lansdowne Resor's innovative \"feature story\" writing style, in which advertisement copy came to closely resemble the editorial copy of the magazines in which the ads were placed, taking advantage of visual and textual appeals which related to the audience's emotions. Advertising executive Albert Lasker said the ad's use of sex appeal made it one of three great landmarks in advertising history.
