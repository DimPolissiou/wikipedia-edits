The townsfolk believed that the ongoing drought was a curse placed upon them for driving away a [[leper]] some years before.\n\nDuring a [[solar eclipse]], a local girl named Elsa (Aunor), reports seeing experiencing an [[Marian apparition|apparition]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] near a tree atop the barren hill where her [[adoptive]] mother ''Aling'' Sal\u00edng (Labalan) [[Child abandonment|found]] her as a baby. Elsa soon after engages in [[faith healing]] the local residents. She is assisted by her friends Chayong (Centeno), Sepa (Quiambao), and Baldo (Almeda) who eventually became part of her \"Seven Apostles\",<ref name=\"Ricardo\"/> which later includes the [[entrepreneur]] Mrs. Alba (Palileo). Word spreads, drawing [[pilgrims]] and the curious to Cupang and Elsa's house, which is marked with a large banner proclaiming \"Elsa Loves You\". At the same time, enterprising residents of Cupang begin selling religious articles, offering accommodation\u2013all capitalising on the sudden influx of local and foreign patients and tourists.\n\nA [[Metro Manila|Manila]]-based [[filmmaker]] named Orly (Manikan) arrives in town to make a documentary on Elsa, interviewing her and the people who personally know her. Around the same time, Elsa's childhood friend Nimia (Due\u00f1as), now a prostitute, has returned to Cupang. Nimia establishes a ''kabaret'' ([[nightclub]]/[[brothel]]) for tourists, which is later ordered closed by Elsa's Seven Apostles.\n\nOne day, Orly approaches the town's [[vicar]] (Lamangan) in the local church's [[confessional]]. He tells the priest that he saw two drugged youths from Manila [[rape|raping]] Elsa and Chayong on the hill of the apparitions. Orly tries to unburden himself of his tremendous guilt.\n\nA [[cholera]] epidemic spreads throughout Cupang, with Sepa's two children dying after eating tainted meat. A still-traumatised Chayong then hangs herself out of shame following the rape. As the townsfolk bring the three bodies to the graveyard, a fourth coffin follows; the deceased's mother chastises Elsa, accusing the seer of failing to heal her child. Authorities quarantine Elsa's house, closing it off from would-be patients, while Elsa blamed herself for all of the deaths and decided to stop healing. Eventually, the pilgrims and tourists stopped coming, returning the town to its sleepy state.\n\nElsa is seen throwing up from [[morning sickness]], indicating her pregnancy from the rape. Mrs. Alba erroneously concluded that it is an \"[[Immaculate Conception]]\" (when she really meant the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|Virgin birth]]), and then declares it proof of Elsa's sanctity. At that exact moment, thunder roars from the skies, followed by a sudden downpour. The townspeople rejoice, convinced that the miracle has returned and that the curse has finally been lifted. Mrs. Alba and the crowd rush to Elsa's house and called out to her while dancing in the rain. Elsa emerges at her window, and commands her devotees to assemble the townsfolk and pilgrims on the hill.\n\nSpeaking in front of an eager crowd, an initially apprehensive Elsa confesses that there were no miracles, no sightings of the Virgin, and that it is man who invents gods, miracles, and curses. In the middle of her passionate speech, a gun is fired at Elsa, mortally wounding her. A violent stampede ensues, with the old, the children, and the infirm being injured or killed in the [[mass hysteria]].\n\nEnsconced in her mother Sal\u00edng's arms, Elsa takes her last breath as she gazes at the sky as Orly and the media film her final moments. Baldo announces Elsa's death, eliciting wailing and weeping from the people who then rush towards the makeshift stage. To convey Elsa's corpse into a waiting ambulance, her followers lifted her lifeless body\u2013lying as though she was [[crucifixion|crucified]]\u2013above the heads of the crowd clambering to touch her. People scamper all over the hill to follow Elsa's ambulance as it speeds away. Against her husband's will, Sepa addresses the crowd, proclaiming Elsa a martyr whose devotion to the Virgin must continue. Sepa and the congregation then fall on their knees and creep up the hill while repeatedly reciting the [[Hail Mary]].<ref name=\"Ricardo\">Lee, Ricardo. \"Si Tatang at mga HImala ng Ating Panahon - Himala\", p. 54-93.

Ricky Lee (although requested to be uncredited), Gil Quito and Doy del Mundo together co-written ''[[Itim (film)|Itim]]''. Quito told Lee, about a female faith healer he and a friend visited in [[Malolos]], [[Bulacan]]. The faith healer was cured of cancer by another faith healer, leading her to be a faith healer herself. She insists that medicine is just as good as the faith of people, but soon her cancer came back and eventually took her life. This intrigued Lee, enough so that he began to think about writing a story revolving around a faith healer, and soon he and Quito visited another faith healer in [[Tondo, Manila]]. While they were visiting, Lee and Quito remembered the story of eleven-year-old Belinda Villas, who was living on [[Cabra Island]] in [[Lubang, Occidental Mindoro|Lubang]], [[Occidental Mindoro]]. In 1966, she and several friends reportedly began experiencing visions of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] dressed in white and blue. As the principal seer, Villas eventually began healing people and the island experienced a boom in commerce.

He entered the script to a contest by the Experimental Cinema of the Philippines where it became one of the selected scripts for production. Lee was given a month to come up with the final draft and was given \u20b140,000. Several aspects of the script was revised. One of the unchanged parts is the casting of Nora Aunor as Elsa.<ref name=\"sitatang\"/>\n\n====Alternate versions====\nLee came up with different endings for the script of ''Himala''. In one version, Elsa did not die; the townsfolk gradually stopped flocking to her and she reverted to being an ordinary person. Many years later, Orly chances upon Elsa drawing water from an old well, having fallen into obscurity along with her \"miracle\". In another ending, Elsa was [[Resurrection of Jesus Christ|resurrected]], similar to [[Jesus Christ]]. In the end and the beginning, Elsa's devotees are depicted awaiting her return to continue healing the sick townsfolk.<ref name=\"sitatang\"/>\n\n===Development===\nShooting began on 13 July 1982, with the arrival of the art department in [[Paoay]], [[Ilocos Norte]] led by production designer, Raquel Villavicencio. The production team needed a place to shoot that shall depict the main setting of the film-a barren and arid land where plants hardly grow and where the soil cracks. This is to suggest a setting where a slight rain would be considered as a miracle by its inhabitants. The problem encountered by the team is the shooting took place during the [[rainy season]] [[Climate of the Philippines|in the Philippines]], and the film was to premiere at the [[1982 Metro Manila Film Festival]]. The region of [[Ilocos]] was selected as shooting location of the film after scouting locations around the country for the driest place for the shoot.<ref name=\"sitatang\"/>\n\nBaryo Calayab was the venue of the set which was used to depict the town of Cupang. Ten carpenters were employed to prepare the set who worked for 24/7. Around 3,000 extras were employed for the film. Director Ishmael Bernal also asked people actually inflicted by disease to portray sick people within the film.<ref name=\"sitatang\"/>\n\nBernal also called for the film to be minimalist, direct to the point, and \"straight to the soul\" and discouraged unnecessary dramatic effects. For example, the characters of Elsa and Nimia stood still, with minimal gestures in the scene where they argued. The scene was focused on the dialogue.<ref name=\"sitatang\"/>\n\nAnother key element of the film was the bare tree where the Virgin Mary supposedly appeared. The tree was against the sky on top of a hill, but it was actually transplanted to the originally barren hilltop. The production team searched for the bare tree among green leafy trees near the area. The tree used in the production was discovered to be a [[hibiscus]] tree after it began to sprout leaves.<ref name=\"sitatang\"/>\n\nFor the final scene in Suba Beach, the 3,000 extras were called to participate which were divided into eight groups. Rain fell and the 6 August shooting had to be postponed, while several of the extras fell sick. By the end of August, shooting for the final scene was finished. Eight cameras were used with one placed below a [[Meralco]] crane. 3,000 extras were still used for the scene which was done in one take. Production costs for the film grew due to delays caused by rain and in at least one occasion, a sandstorm. The shooting for the film took two months.<ref name=\"sitatang\"/>\n\n==Subject and impact==\n''Himala'' is the story of Elsa, a [[barrio]] lass whose supposed visions of the [[Virgin Mary]] change her life, turning her into an overnight sensation and causing mass [[hysteria]] in a poor, isolated northern Philippine village suffering from a drought. The film is centred on the issues of religious [[faith]] and faithlessness, morality, and truth.<ref name=\"Philippine Daily Inquirer page 1\"/> As Elsa, Aunor delivered the film's most iconic line in the climax:\n\n{{cquote|\"''Wal\u00e1ng himal\u00e2! Ang himal\u00e2 ay nasa pus\u00f2 ng tao, nasa pus\u00f2 nating lahat! Tayo ang gumagaw\u00e2 ng mga himal\u00e2! Tayo ang gumagaw\u00e2 ng mga sump\u00e2 at ng mga diyos...''\" <br/>(\"There is no miracle! Miracles are in people's hearts, in all our hearts! We are the ones who make miracles! We are the ones who make curses, and gods...\")}}\n\n''Himala'' became a box-office hit, earning an impressive \u20b130 million, becoming one of the highest grossing [[Cinema of the Philippines|Filipino films]] in the [[Philippine films of the 1980s|1980s]].

It would have starred Nora Aunor in the role of Elsa, establishing her as surviving the gunshot.\n\nHowever, Aunor was not available and the team went on to produce a musical version of the movie. It was staged in the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines#Tanghalang Hus\u00e9ng Batut\u00e8|Hus\u00e9ng Batut\u00e8 Theatre]] (Studio Theater) of the CCP in 2003 in the 20th season of Tanghalang Pilipino. The [[libretto]] was by Ricky Lee, music and [[musical direction]] by [[Vincent de Jesus]], lyrics by Vincent de Jesus and Ricky Lee, direction by Soxie Topacio, set and [[costume design]] by Gino Gonzales, [[choreography]] by Jose Jay Cruz and lighting design by Benjamin Villareal, Jr. May Bayot played the role of Elsa together with Isay Alvarez as Nimia, Cynthia Culig-Guico as Chayong, Eladio Pamaran as Orly, and Dulce as Nanay Saling. Bayot won an [[Aliw Awards|Al\u00edw Award]] for Best Actress in a Musical that year.\n\nDue to popular demand, it was re-staged at the larger [[Cultural Center of the Philippines#Tanghalang Aur\u00e9lio Tolentino|Tanghalang Aur\u00e9lio Tolentino]] (Little Theater) in 2004 in the 21st season of TP with the same artistic team. It went to [[Shanghai, China]] in 2008 as the Philippine representative to the Shanghai International Theater Festival. ''Wal\u00e1ng Himala'', the final song in the musical, was featured in CCP's Gala 40th Anniversary Concert \"Rubies,\" performed by mezzo-soprano [[Clarissa Ocampo]] with the [[Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra]], [[musical arranger|arranged]] and [[conducting|conducted]] by [[Maestro]] Chino Toledo.\n\nThe original [[cast recording]], produced by de Jesus, was recorded in 2008 and was released independently.\n\nThe musical has been revived twice locally in 2013 and 2018. The first revival was a dramatized concert production performed in 2013 at the Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA) Theater Center in Quezon City. Majority of the original CCP cast and production team returned for this production, alongside new cast members.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/94491/may-himala-and-on-its-10th-year-as-a-musical-is-now-in-concert-form/|title=\u2018May \u2018Himala!\u2019\u2013and, on its 10th year as a musical, is now in concert form|last=de Jesus|first=Totel|date=2013-03-16|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en}}</ref> The second revival was performed in 2018 at the Power Mac Center Spotlight in [[Circuit Makati]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/arts-and-culture/theater/196681-himala-isang-musikal-review|title=Why \u2018Himala: Isang Musikal\u2019 is worth watching|last=Radovan|first=Jill Tan|date=2018-02-23|work=Rappler|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en}}</ref> This production was notable for its minimalist and [[immersive design]] (opting for a near-barren set designed by Ed Lacson, who also directed).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/arts-and-culture/theater/194079-himala-isang-musikal-fun-facts-aicelle-santos|title=6 things you need to know about 'Himala: Isang Musikal'|last=Del Valle|first=Precious|date=2018-01-22|work=Rappler|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en}}</ref> [[Aicelle Santos]] played the role of Elsa, with [[Bituin Escalante]] as Nanay Saling, Kakki Teodoro as Nimia, Neomi Gonzales as Chayong, Sandino Martin as Pilo, and David Ezra as Orly.\n\n==Restoration==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Himalarestored.png|thumb|right|2012 release poster]] -->\nIn 2012, ''Himala'' was restored and remastered by ABS-CBN Film Archives and Central Digital Lab.

The townsfolk believed that the ongoing drought was a curse placed upon them for driving away a [[leper]] some years before.\n\nDuring a [[solar eclipse]], a local girl named Elsa (Aunor), reports seeing experiencing an [[Marian apparition|apparition]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] near a tree atop the barren hill where her [[adoptive]] mother ''Aling'' Sal\u00edng (Labalan) [[Child abandonment|found]] her as a baby. Elsa soon after engages in [[faith healing]] the local residents. She is assisted by her friends Chayong (Centeno), Sepa (Quiambao), and Baldo (Almeda) who eventually became part of her \"Seven Apostles\",<ref name=\"Ricardo\"/> which later includes the [[entrepreneur]] Mrs. Alba (Palileo). Word spreads, drawing [[pilgrims]] and the curious to Cupang and Elsa's house, which is marked with a large banner proclaiming \"Elsa Loves You\". At the same time, enterprising residents of Cupang begin selling religious articles, offering accommodation\u2013all capitalising on the sudden influx of local and foreign patients and tourists.\n\nA [[Metro Manila|Manila]]-based [[filmmaker]] named Orly (Manikan) arrives in town to make a documentary on Elsa, interviewing her and the people who personally know her. Around the same time, Elsa's childhood friend Nimia (Due\u00f1as), now a prostitute, has returned to Cupang. Nimia establishes a ''kabaret'' ([[nightclub]]/[[brothel]]) for tourists, which is later ordered closed by Elsa's Seven Apostles.\n\nOne day, Orly approaches the town's [[vicar]] (Lamangan) in the local church's [[confessional]]. He tells the priest that he saw two drugged youths from Manila [[rape|raping]] Elsa and Chayong on the hill of the apparitions. Orly tries to unburden himself of his tremendous guilt.\n\n\nA [[cholera]] epidemic spreads throughout Cupang, with Sepa's two children dying after eating tainted meat. A still-traumatised Chayong then hangs herself out of shame following the rape. As the townsfolk bring the three bodies to the graveyard, a fourth coffin follows; the deceased's mother chastises Elsa, accusing the seer of failing to heal her child. Authorities quarantine Elsa's house, closing it off from would-be patients, while Elsa blamed herself for all of the deaths and decided to stop healing. Eventually, the pilgrims and tourists stopped coming, returning the town to its sleepy state.\n\nElsa is seen throwing up from [[morning sickness]], indicating her pregnancy from the rape. Mrs. Alba erroneously concluded that it is an \"[[Immaculate Conception]]\" (when she really meant the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|Virgin birth]]), and then declares it proof of Elsa's sanctity. At that exact moment, thunder roars from the skies, followed by a sudden downpour. The townspeople rejoice, convinced that the miracle has returned and that the curse has finally been lifted. Mrs. Alba and the crowd rush to Elsa's house and called out to her while dancing in the rain. Elsa emerges at her window, and commands her devotees to assemble the townsfolk and pilgrims on the hill.\n\nSpeaking in front of an eager crowd, an initially apprehensive Elsa confesses that there were no miracles, no sightings of the Virgin, and that it is man who invents gods, miracles, and curses. In the middle of her passionate speech, a gun is fired at Elsa, mortally wounding her. A violent stampede ensues, with the old, the children, and the infirm being injured or killed in the [[mass hysteria]].\n\nEnsconced in her mother Sal\u00edng's arms, Elsa takes her last breath as she gazes at the sky as Orly and the media film her final moments. Baldo announces Elsa's death, eliciting wailing and weeping from the people who then rush towards the makeshift stage. To convey Elsa's corpse into a waiting ambulance, her followers lifted her lifeless body\u2013lying as though she was [[crucifixion|crucified]]\u2013above the heads of the crowd clambering to touch her. People scamper all over the hill to follow Elsa's ambulance as it speeds away. Against her husband's will, Sepa addresses the crowd, proclaiming Elsa a martyr whose devotion to the Virgin must continue.

Ricky Lee (although requested to be uncredited), Gil Quito and Doy del Mundo together co-written ''[[Itim (film)|Itim]]''. Quito told Lee, about a female faith healer he and a friend visited in [[Malolos]], [[Bulacan]]. The faith healer was cured of cancer by another faith healer, leading her to be a faith healer herself. She insists that medicine is just as good as the faith of people, but soon her cancer came back and eventually took her life. This intrigued Lee, enough so that he began to think about writing a story revolving around a faith healer, and soon he and Quito visited another faith healer in [[Tondo, Manila]]. While they were visiting, Lee and Quito remembered the story of eleven-year-old Belinda Villas, who was living on [[Cabra Island]] in [[Lubang, Occidental Mindoro|Lubang]], [[Occidental Mindoro]]. In 1966, she and several friends reportedly began experiencing visions of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] dressed in white and blue. As the principal seer, Villas eventually began healing people and the island experienced a boom in commerce. This became the primary inspiration for Lee's screenplay.<ref name=Puso>{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ricky|editor1-last=Lee|editor1-first=Ricky|title=Sa Puso ng Himala|date=2012|publisher=Philippine Writers Studio Foundation, Inc.|location=Loyola Heights, Quezon City, Philippines|isbn=978-971-94307-3-5|language=Filipino, English}}{{rp|11\u201312}}</ref><ref name=\"sitatang\">{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ricky|title=Si Tatang at mga Himala ng Ating Panahon : Koleksyon ng mga Akda (Tatang and the Miracles of Our Time: A Collection of Works)|date=2009|publisher=Writers Studio Philippines|location=Quezon City|isbn=9789719430711|pages=1369146|edition=Special|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books/about/Si_tatang_at_mga_himala_ng_ating_panahon.html?id=zmogQwAACAAJ&redir_esc=y|accessdate=7 October 2015|ref=sitatang|language=Filipino|chapter=Ang Paggawa ng ''Himala'' (The Making of ''Himala'')}}</ref>\n\nWith the help of Bibsy Carballo, Lee approached several producers to promote the script but was rejected several times. He entered the script to a contest by the Experimental Cinema of the Philippines where it became one of the selected scripts for production. Lee was given a month to come up with the final draft and was given \u20b140,000. Several aspects of the script was revised. One of the unchanged parts is the casting of Nora Aunor as Elsa.<ref name=\"sitatang\"/>\n\n====Alternate versions====\nLee came up with different endings for the script of ''Himala''. In one version, Elsa did not die; the townsfolk gradually stopped flocking to her and she reverted to being an ordinary person. Many years later, Orly chances upon Elsa drawing water from an old well, having fallen into obscurity along with her \"miracle\". In another ending, Elsa was [[Resurrection of Jesus Christ|resurrected]], similar to [[Jesus Christ]]. In the end and the beginning, Elsa's devotees are depicted awaiting her return to continue healing the sick townsfolk.<ref name=\"sitatang\"/>\n\n===Development===\nShooting began on 13 July 1982, with the arrival of the art department in [[Paoay]], [[Ilocos Norte]] led by production designer, Raquel Villavicencio. The production team needed a place to shoot that shall depict the main setting of the film-a barren and arid land where plants hardly grow and where the soil cracks. This is to suggest a setting where a slight rain would be considered as a miracle by its inhabitants. The problem encountered by the team is the shooting took place during the [[rainy season]] [[Climate of the Philippines|in the Philippines]], and the film was to premiere at the [[1982 Metro Manila Film Festival]]. The region of [[Ilocos]] was selected as shooting location of the film after scouting locations around the country for the driest place for the shoot.<ref name=\"sitatang\"/>\n\nBaryo Calayab was the venue of the set which was used to depict the town of Cupang. Ten carpenters were employed to prepare the set who worked for 24/7. Around 3,000 extras were employed for the film. Director Ishmael Bernal also asked people actually inflicted by disease to portray sick people within the film.<ref name=\"sitatang\"/>\n\nBernal also called for the film to be minimalist, direct to the point, and \"straight to the soul\" and discouraged unnecessary dramatic effects. For example, the characters of Elsa and Nimia stood still, with minimal gestures in the scene where they argued. The scene was focused on the dialogue.<ref name=\"sitatang\"/>\n\nAnother key element of the film was the bare tree where the Virgin Mary supposedly appeared. The tree was against the sky on top of a hill, but it was actually transplanted to the originally barren hilltop. The production team searched for the bare tree among green leafy trees near the area. The tree used in the production was discovered to be a [[hibiscus]] tree after it began to sprout leaves.<ref name=\"sitatang\"/>\n\nFor the final scene in Suba Beach, the 3,000 extras were called to participate which were divided into eight groups. Rain fell and the 6 August shooting had to be postponed, while several of the extras fell sick. By the end of August, shooting for the final scene was finished. Eight cameras were used with one placed below a [[Meralco]] crane. 3,000 extras were still used for the scene which was done in one take. Production costs for the film grew due to delays caused by rain and in at least one occasion, a sandstorm. The shooting for the film took two months.<ref name=\"sitatang\"/>\n\n==Subject and impact==\n''Himala'' is the story of Elsa, a [[barrio]] lass whose supposed visions of the [[Virgin Mary]] change her life, turning her into an overnight sensation and causing mass [[hysteria]] in a poor, isolated northern Philippine village suffering from a drought. The film is centred on the issues of religious [[faith]] and faithlessness, morality, and truth.<ref name=\"Philippine Daily Inquirer page 1\"/> As Elsa, Aunor delivered the film's most iconic line in the climax:\n\n{{cquote|\"''Wal\u00e1ng himal\u00e2! Ang himal\u00e2 ay nasa pus\u00f2 ng tao, nasa pus\u00f2 nating lahat! Tayo ang gumagaw\u00e2 ng mga himal\u00e2! Tayo ang gumagaw\u00e2 ng mga sump\u00e2 at ng mga diyos...''\" <br/>(\"There is no miracle! Miracles are in people's hearts, in all our hearts! We are the ones who make miracles! We are the ones who make curses, and gods...\")}}\n\n''Himala'' became a box-office hit, earning an impressive \u20b130 million, becoming one of the highest grossing [[Cinema of the Philippines|Filipino films]] in the [[Philippine films of the 1980s|1980s]]. Aunor also won several awards for her performance. it is also considered as one of the [[List of films considered the best#Philippines|greatest Filipino films of all time]].\n\n==Awards==\n''Himala'' has won numerous awards and distinctions in the Philippines and abroad, including Best Picture from the 1982 Metro Manila Film Festival and the 1983 [[Catholic Mass Media Awards]].\n\nAt the Metro Manila Film Festival, the film swept nine of the eleven awards available. Aunor won the Best Actress award for her role in the film, and was nominated for other top acting awards in the Philippines. She was nominated for Best Actress at the [[33rd Berlin International Film Festival]], where ''Himala'' vied in the prestigious competition for the [[Golden Bear]] Award.<ref name=\"Berlinale\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1983/02_programm_1983/02_Programm_1983.html |title=Berlinale: 1983 Programme |accessdate=2010-11-17 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> The film was personally handpicked by Festival Director [[Moritz de Hadeln]] in the official selection.\n\nThe film's international honors also included the [[Bronze Hugo]] prize at the 1983 [[Chicago International Film Festival]]; it received a special religious citation in the 1983 Asia-Pacific Film Festival held in Taipei, Taiwan; and it was selected as the opening film for the 1983 [[Manila International Film Festival]].\n\n''Himala'' was the choice of the Filipino film critics' society ''[[Gawad Urian Awards|Manunuri ng Pelikulang Pilipino]]'' as one of the ten best films of the 1980s. In 2002, the same critics' group named ''Himala'' one of the best Filipino movies for the last three decades, from 1970 - 1999.\n\nBernal, the film's director, was conferred the [[Philippine National Artist|National Artist Award]] posthumously (he died in 1996). His body of work was accorded the high recognition of [[Gawad CCP para sa Sining]] in 1990, and the [[Centennial Honors for the Arts]], on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the [[Philippine Declaration of Independence]] and Nationhood in 1998.\n\n''Himala'' was the only Filipino film that made it to the shortlist of the Best Asian Films of All Time chosen by [[CNN International]] in 2008.<ref name=\"UK18\">[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/122020/PEP-Himala-is-one-of-CNN-UKs-top-18-Asian-films \"Himala is one of CNN-UK's top 18 Asian films\"]. gmanews.tv.</ref><ref>(2008-10-22).

It would have starred Nora Aunor in the role of Elsa, establishing her as surviving the gunshot.\n\nHowever, Aunor was not available and the team went on to produce a musical version of the movie. It was staged in the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines#Tanghalang Hus\u00e9ng Batut\u00e8|Hus\u00e9ng Batut\u00e8 Theatre]] (Studio Theater) of the CCP in 2003 in the 20th season of Tanghalang Pilipino. The [[libretto]] was by Ricky Lee, music and [[musical direction]] by [[Vincent de Jesus]], lyrics by Vincent de Jesus and Ricky Lee, direction by Soxie Topacio, set and [[costume design]] by Gino Gonzales, [[choreography]] by Jose Jay Cruz and lighting design by Benjamin Villareal, Jr. May Bayot played the role of Elsa together with Isay Alvarez as Nimia, Cynthia Culig-Guico as Chayong, Eladio Pamaran as Orly, and Dulce as Nanay Saling. Bayot won an [[Aliw Awards|Al\u00edw Award]] for Best Actress in a Musical that year.\n\nDue to popular demand, it was re-staged at the larger [[Cultural Center of the Philippines#Tanghalang Aur\u00e9lio Tolentino|Tanghalang Aur\u00e9lio Tolentino]] (Little Theater) in 2004 in the 21st season of TP with the same artistic team. It went to [[Shanghai, China]] in 2008 as the Philippine representative to the Shanghai International Theater Festival. ''Wal\u00e1ng Himala'', the final song in the musical, was featured in CCP's Gala 40th Anniversary Concert \"Rubies,\" performed by mezzo-soprano [[Clarissa Ocampo]] with the [[Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra]], [[musical arranger|arranged]] and [[conducting|conducted]] by [[Maestro]] Chino Toledo.\n\nThe original [[cast recording]], produced by de Jesus, was recorded in 2008 and was released independently.\n\nThe musical has been revived twice locally in 2013 and 2018. The first revival was a dramatized concert production performed in 2013 at the Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA) Theater Center in Quezon City. Majority of the original CCP cast and production team returned for this production, alongside new cast members.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/94491/may-himala-and-on-its-10th-year-as-a-musical-is-now-in-concert-form/|title=\u2018May \u2018Himala!\u2019\u2013and, on its 10th year as a musical, is now in concert form|last=de Jesus|first=Totel|date=2013-03-16|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en}}</ref> The second revival was performed in 2018 at the Power Mac Center Spotlight in [[Circuit Makati]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/arts-and-culture/theater/196681-himala-isang-musikal-review|title=Why \u2018Himala: Isang Musikal\u2019 is worth watching|last=Radovan|first=Jill Tan|date=2018-02-23|work=Rappler|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en}}</ref> This production was notable for its minimalist and [[immersive design]] (opting for a near-barren set designed by Ed Lacson, who also directed).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/arts-and-culture/theater/194079-himala-isang-musikal-fun-facts-aicelle-santos|title=6 things you need to know about 'Himala: Isang Musikal'|last=Del Valle|first=Precious|date=2018-01-22|work=Rappler|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en}}</ref> [[Aicelle Santos]] played the role of Elsa, with [[Bituin Escalante]] as Nanay Saling, Kakki Teodoro as Nimia, Neomi Gonzales as Chayong, Sandino Martin as Pilo, and David Ezra as Orly.\n\n==Restoration==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Himalarestored.png|thumb|right|2012 release poster]] -->\nIn 2012, ''Himala'' was restored and remastered by ABS-CBN Film Archives and Central Digital Lab.
