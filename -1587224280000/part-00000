The [[Economy of Hungary|Hungarian economy]] is fairly open and relies strongly on [[international trade]].\n\nHungary has been a member of the [[United Nations]] since December 1955 and member of [[European Union]], the [[NATO]], the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], the [[Visegr\u00e1d Group]], the [[WTO]], the [[World Bank]], the [[Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank|AIIB]] and the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]. Hungary took on the presidency of the [[Council of the European Union]] for half a year in 2011 and the next will be in 2024. In 2015, Hungary was the fifth largest [[OECD]] Non-[[Development Assistance Committee|DAC]] donor of [[development aid]] in the world, which represents [[List of development aid country donors|0.13% of its Gross National Income]], in this regard Hungary stands before [[Spain]], [[Israel]] or [[Russia]].\n\nHungary's capital city, [[Budapest]] is home to more than 100 [[embassy|embassies]] and representative bodies as an international political actor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.123embassy.com/city.php?c=Budapest|title=Embassies in Budapest|year=2014|publisher=123embassy.com|accessdate=20 November 2016}}</ref> Hungary hosts the main and regional headquarters of many international organizations as well, including [[European Institute of Innovation and Technology]], [[European Police College]], [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]], [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]], [[International Centre for Democratic Transition]], [[Institute of International Education]], [[International Labour Organization]], [[International Organization for Migration]], [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|International Red Cross]], [[Regional Environmental Center for Central and Eastern Europe]], [[Danube Commission (1948)|Danube Commission]] and even others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.hu/kum2005/Templates/alapsablon.aspx?NRMODE=Published&NRORIGINALURL=%2Fkum%2Fen%2Fbal%2Fforeign_policy%2Fun_sc%2Finternational_organisations.htm&NRNODEGUID=%7B45550E06-66FE-4183-A899-EDF5BD040EB5%7D&NRCACHEHINT=NoModifyGuest&printable=true |title=International organizations in Hungary |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=20 November 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313115736/http://www.mfa.gov.hu/kum2005/Templates/alapsablon.aspx?NRMODE=Published&NRORIGINALURL=%2Fkum%2Fen%2Fbal%2Fforeign_policy%2Fun_sc%2Finternational_organisations.htm&NRNODEGUID=%7B45550E06-66FE-4183-A899-EDF5BD040EB5%7D&NRCACHEHINT=NoModifyGuest&printable=true |archivedate=13 March 2016 }}</ref>\n\nSince 1989, Hungary's top foreign policy goal was achieving integration into Western economic and security organizations. Hungary joined the [[Partnership for Peace]] program in 1994 and has actively supported the [[IFOR]] and [[SFOR]] missions in Bosnia. Hungary since 1989 has also improved its often frosty neighborly relations by signing basic treaties with [[Ukraine]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Romania]]. These renounce all outstanding territorial claims and lay the foundation for constructive relations. However, the issue of [[Hungarian diaspora|ethnic Hungarian minority]] rights in Romania, Slovakia and Ukraine periodically causes bilateral tensions to flare up. Hungary since 1989 has signed all of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] documents, and served as the OSCE's Chairman-in-Office in 1997. Hungary's record of implementing [[Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe|CSCE]] ''Helsinki Final Act'' provisions, including those on reunification of divided families, remains among the best in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nExcept for the short-lived [[Neutral country|neutrality]] declared by the [[anti-Soviet]] leader [[Imre Nagy]] in November 1956, [[Hungary]]'s foreign policy generally followed the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] lead from 1947 to 1989. During the [[Communism|Communist]] period, Hungary maintained treaties of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance with the [[Soviet Union]], [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]], [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[German Democratic Republic]], [[People's Republic of Romania|Romania]], and [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]. It was one of the founding members of the Soviet-led [[Warsaw Pact]] and [[Comecon]], and it was the first central European country to withdraw from those organizations, now defunct. After 1989, Hungary oriented more towards the West, joined [[NATO]] in 1999 and the [[European Union]] in 2004. \n[[File:Necasmeeting.jpg|thumb|right|Meeting of [[Visegr\u00e1d Group]] leaders, plus Germany and France in 2013]]\n[[File:BIMUN 2012 opening 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[United Nations]] conference in the assembly hall of [[House of Magnates]] in the [[Hungarian Parliament Building|Hungarian Parliament]]]]\n\n==Overview==\nAs with any country, Hungarian security attitudes are shaped largely by history and geography. For Hungary, this is a history of more than 400 years of domination by great powers\u2014the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], the [[Habsburg]] dynasty, the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] during [[World War II]], and the Soviets during the [[Cold War]]\u2014and a geography of regional instability and separation from Hungarian minorities living in neighboring countries. Hungary's foreign policy priorities, largely consistent since 1990, represent a direct response to these factors. Since 1990, Hungary's top foreign policy goal has been achieving integration into Western economic and security organizations. Hungary joined the [[Partnership for Peace]] program in 1994 and has actively supported the [[IFOR]] and [[SFOR]] missions in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]. The [[Gyula Horn|Horn]] government achieved Hungary's most important foreign policy successes of the post-communist era by securing invitations to join both [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]] in 1997. Hungary became a member of NATO in 1999, and a member of the [[European Union|EU]] in 2004.\n\nHungary also has improved its often frosty neighborly relations by signing basic treaties with [[Romania]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Ukraine]]. These renounce all outstanding territorial claims and lay the foundation for constructive relations. However, the issue of ethnic Hungarian minority rights in Slovakia and Romania periodically causes bilateral tensions to flare up. Hungary was a signatory to the [[Helsinki Final Act]] in 1975, has signed all of the CSCE/[[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] follow-on documents since 1989, and served as the OSCE's Chairman-in-Office in 1997. Hungary's record of implementing CSCE '''Helsinki Final Act''' provisions, including those on reunification of divided families, remains among the best in eastern Europe. Hungary has been a member of the [[United Nations]] since December 1955.\n\n;The [[Gab\u010d\u00edkovo - Nagymaros Dams]] project\nThis involves Hungary and Czechoslovakia, and .was agreed on September 16, 1977 (\"Budapest Treaty\"). The treaty envisioned a [[cross-border]] barrage system between the towns Gab\u010d\u00edkovo, [[Czechoslovakia]] and Nagymaros, Hungary. After intensive campaign the project became widely hated as a symbol of the old [[communist]] regime. In 1989 the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] government decided to suspend it. In its sentence from September 1997, the [[International Court of Justice]] stated that both sides breached their obligation and that the 1977 Budapest Treaty is still valid. In 1998 the Slovak government turned to the International Court, demanding the Nagymaros part to be built. The international dispute is still not solved as of 2008.\n\n\nOn March 19, 2008 Hungary recognized [[Kosovo]] as an independent country.<ref>{{cite web|title=Croatia and Hungary recognize Kosovo|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/03/19/europe/kosovo.php|work=[[The Associated Press]]|publisher=International Herald Tribune|date=2008-03-19|accessdate=2008-09-21}}</ref>\n\n'''Disputes&nbsp;\u2013 international:'''\nOngoing [[Gab\u010d\u00edkovo - Nagymaros Dams]] dispute with [[Slovakia]]\n\n'''Illicit drugs:'''\nMajor trans-shipment point for [[Southwest Asia]]n [[heroin]] and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and transit point for [[South America]]n [[cocaine]] destined for [[Western Europe]]; limited producer of precursor [[chemical compound|chemicals]], particularly for [[amphetamine]]s and [[methamphetamine]]s\n\n'''Refugee protection:'''\nThe [[hungarian border barrier]] was built in 2015, and Hungary was criticized by other European countries for using tear gas and water cannons on [[refugees of the Syrian Civil War]] as they were \u2013 illegally \u2013 trying to pass the country.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/sep/16/first-refugees-head-for-croatia-after-hungarys-border-crackdown-live-updates Hungary border crackdown], The Guardian 16 September 2015</ref><ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hungarian-police-spray-tear-gas-water-cannons-at-migrants/ Hungarian police spary tear gas water cannons at migrants], CBS news 16 September 2015</ref>\n\nSince 2017, the Hungary\u2013Ukraine relations rapidly deteriorated over the issue of the [[Hungarians in Ukraine|Hungarian minority in Ukraine]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Ukraine defends education reform as Hungary promises \u2018pain\u2019 |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/ukraine-defends-education-reform-as-hungary-promises-pain-1.3235916 |work=The Irish Times |date=27 September 2017}}</ref><ref>\"[https://www.neweurope.eu/article/hungary-ukraine-relations-hit-new-low-troop-deployment/ Hungary-Ukraine relations hit new low over troop deployment]\".

Hungary joined the [[Partnership for Peace]] program in 1994 and has actively supported the [[IFOR]] and [[SFOR]] missions in Bosnia. Hungary since 1989 has also improved its often frosty neighborly relations by signing basic treaties with [[Ukraine]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Romania]]. These renounce all outstanding territorial claims and lay the foundation for constructive relations. However, the issue of [[Hungarian diaspora|ethnic Hungarian minority]] rights in Romania, Slovakia and Ukraine periodically causes bilateral tensions to flare up. Hungary since 1989 has signed all of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] documents, and served as the OSCE's Chairman-in-Office in 1997. Hungary's record of implementing [[Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe|CSCE]] ''Helsinki Final Act'' provisions, including those on reunification of divided families, remains among the best in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nExcept for the short-lived [[Neutral country|neutrality]] declared by the [[anti-Soviet]] leader [[Imre Nagy]] in November 1956, [[Hungary]]'s foreign policy generally followed the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] lead from 1947 to 1989. During the [[Communism|Communist]] period, Hungary maintained treaties of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance with the [[Soviet Union]], [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]], [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[German Democratic Republic]], [[People's Republic of Romania|Romania]], and [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]. It was one of the founding members of the Soviet-led [[Warsaw Pact]] and [[Comecon]], and it was the first central European country to withdraw from those organizations, now defunct. After 1989, Hungary oriented more towards the West, joined [[NATO]] in 1999 and the [[European Union]] in 2004. \n[[File:Necasmeeting.jpg|thumb|right|Meeting of [[Visegr\u00e1d Group]] leaders, plus Germany and France in 2013]]\n[[File:BIMUN 2012 opening 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[United Nations]] conference in the assembly hall of [[House of Magnates]] in the [[Hungarian Parliament Building|Hungarian Parliament]]]]\n\n==Overview==\nAs with any country, Hungarian security attitudes are shaped largely by history and geography. For Hungary, this is a history of more than 400 years of domination by great powers\u2014the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], the [[Habsburg]] dynasty, the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] during [[World War II]], and the Soviets during the [[Cold War]]\u2014and a geography of regional instability and separation from Hungarian minorities living in neighboring countries. Hungary's foreign policy priorities, largely consistent since 1990, represent a direct response to these factors. Since 1990, Hungary's top foreign policy goal has been achieving integration into Western economic and security organizations. Hungary joined the [[Partnership for Peace]] program in 1994 and has actively supported the [[IFOR]] and [[SFOR]] missions in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]. The [[Gyula Horn|Horn]] government achieved Hungary's most important foreign policy successes of the post-communist era by securing invitations to join both [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]] in 1997. Hungary became a member of NATO in 1999, and a member of the [[European Union|EU]] in 2004.\n\nHungary also has improved its often frosty neighborly relations by signing basic treaties with [[Romania]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Ukraine]]. These renounce all outstanding territorial claims and lay the foundation for constructive relations. However, the issue of ethnic Hungarian minority rights in Slovakia and Romania periodically causes bilateral tensions to flare up. Hungary was a signatory to the [[Helsinki Final Act]] in 1975, has signed all of the CSCE/[[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] follow-on documents since 1989, and served as the OSCE's Chairman-in-Office in 1997. Hungary's record of implementing CSCE '''Helsinki Final Act''' provisions, including those on reunification of divided families, remains among the best in eastern Europe. Hungary has been a member of the [[United Nations]] since December 1955.\n\n;The [[Gab\u010d\u00edkovo - Nagymaros Dams]] project\nThis involves Hungary and Czechoslovakia, and .was agreed on September 16, 1977 (\"Budapest Treaty\"). The treaty envisioned a [[cross-border]] barrage system between the towns Gab\u010d\u00edkovo, [[Czechoslovakia]] and Nagymaros, Hungary. After intensive campaign the project became widely hated as a symbol of the old [[communist]] regime. In 1989 [[Hungary|Hungarian]] government decided to suspend it. In its sentence from September 1997, the [[International Court of Justice]] stated that both sides breached their obligation and that the 1977 Budapest Treaty is still valid. In 1998 the Slovak government turned to the International Court, demanding the Nagymaros part to be built. The international dispute is still not solved as of 2008.\n\n\nOn March 19, 2008 Hungary recognized [[Kosovo]] as an independent country.<ref>{{cite web|title=Croatia and Hungary recognize Kosovo|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/03/19/europe/kosovo.php|work=[[The Associated Press]]|publisher=International Herald Tribune|date=2008-03-19|accessdate=2008-09-21}}</ref>\n\n'''Disputes&nbsp;\u2013 international:'''\nOngoing [[Gab\u010d\u00edkovo - Nagymaros Dams]] dispute with [[Slovakia]]\n\n'''Illicit drugs:'''\nMajor trans-shipment point for [[Southwest Asia]]n [[heroin]] and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and transit point for [[South America]]n [[cocaine]] destined for [[Western Europe]]; limited producer of precursor [[chemical compound|chemicals]], particularly for [[amphetamine]]s and [[methamphetamine]]s\n\n'''Refugee protection:'''\nThe [[hungarian border barrier]] was built in 2015, and Hungary was criticized by other European countries for using tear gas and water cannons on [[refugees of the Syrian Civil War]] as they were \u2013 illegally \u2013 trying to pass the country.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/sep/16/first-refugees-head-for-croatia-after-hungarys-border-crackdown-live-updates Hungary border crackdown], The Guardian 16 September 2015</ref><ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hungarian-police-spray-tear-gas-water-cannons-at-migrants/ Hungarian police spary tear gas water cannons at migrants], CBS news 16 September 2015</ref>\n\nSince 2017, the Hungary\u2013Ukraine relations rapidly deteriorated over the issue of the [[Hungarians in Ukraine|Hungarian minority in Ukraine]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Ukraine defends education reform as Hungary promises \u2018pain\u2019 |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/ukraine-defends-education-reform-as-hungary-promises-pain-1.3235916 |work=The Irish Times |date=27 September 2017}}</ref><ref>\"[https://www.neweurope.eu/article/hungary-ukraine-relations-hit-new-low-troop-deployment/ Hungary-Ukraine relations hit new low over troop deployment]\".

It is part of New England, although portions of it are often grouped with New York and [[New Jersey]] as the [[tri-state area]]. The state is named for the [[Connecticut River]] which approximately bisects the state. The word \"Connecticut\" is derived from various anglicized spellings of an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] word for \"long tidal river\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Trumbull|first=James Hammond|title=Indian Names of Places, Etc., in and on the Borders of Connecticut: With Interpretations of Some of Them|year=1881 |location=Harford, Connecticut |publisher=Press of the Case, Lockwood & Brainard Company |url={{google books|JS8TAAAAYAAJ|plainurl=yes|page=60}} |page=60}}</ref>\n\nConnecticut's first European settlers were Dutchmen who established a small, short-lived settlement called [[Fort Hoop]] in Hartford at the confluence of the [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park]] and Connecticut Rivers. Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River]]s, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which rejected British rule in the [[American Revolution]].\n\nConnecticut is the third smallest state by area,<ref name=\"census table 18\">{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 18, Area Measurements: 2010; and Population and Housing Unit Density: 1990 to 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=41 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> the 29th most populous,<ref>{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 19, Population by Urban and Rural and Type of Urban Area: 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=42 |access-date=May 16, 2014 }}</ref> and the fourth most densely populated<ref name=\"census table 18\" /> of the fifty states.

The coast of Connecticut sits on [[Long Island Sound]], which is an [[estuary]]. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the \"race\" near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when [[tropical cyclones]] pass off the upper East Coast.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.\n\n{{further|List of Connecticut rivers}}\n\nConnecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[Village green|green]], such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in New England), Milford Green (second largest in New England) and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or [[inn]], several [[American colonial architecture|colonial houses]], and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.\n\nThe northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately {{convert|2.5|mile|km}} square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick's]] residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/SouthwickMA_WebDocs/southwick_jog.pdf |title=The Southwick Jog |last=Dodge |first=Edward R. |website=Town of Southwick, Massachusetts |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929023040/http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog |publisher=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024224307/http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |archivedate=October 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], and parts of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]].

Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s \u00baF for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing.\n\nWinters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from {{convert|38|F|C}} in the coastal lowlands to {{convert|33|F|C}} in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about {{convert|60|in|mm}} in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only {{convert|20-25|in|mm}} along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton). Generally, any locale north or west of [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 84]] receives the most snow, during a storm, and throughout the season. Most of Connecticut has less than 60 days of snow cover. Snow usually falls from late November to late March in the northern part of the state, and from early December to mid-March in the southern and coastal parts of the state.\n\nConnecticut's record high temperature is {{convert|106|F|C}} which occurred in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] on July 15, 1995; the record low is {{convert|-32|F|C}} which occurred in the Northwest Hills [[Falls Village, Connecticut|Falls Village]] on February 16, 1943, and [[Coventry, Connecticut|Coventry]] on January 22, 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/getextreme.php?elem=ALL&state=CT| title = All-Time Climate Extremes for CT|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|Monthly normal high and low temperatures for various Connecticut cities (\u00b0F)\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000; height:17px;\"| City\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jan\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Feb\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Mar\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Apr\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| May\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jun\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jul\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Aug\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Sep\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Oct\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Nov\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Dec\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f8f3ca; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Bridgeport\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0ff; color:#000;\"| 37/23\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0fe; color:#000;\"| 40/25\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffae; color:#000;\"| 47/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff5e; color:#000;\"| 58/41\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f1; color:#000;\"| 68/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 77/60\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#7f0; color:#000;\"| 82/66\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#6eff00; color:#000;\"| 81/65\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#3f0; color:#000;\"| 74/58\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff2f; color:#000;\"| 63/46\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff7b; color:#000;\"| 53/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffd4; color:#000;\"| 42/28\n|-\n! style=\"background:#c5dfe1; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Hartford\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00d9ff; color:#000;\"| 35/16\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00f7ff; color:#000;\"| 39/19\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffc3; color:#000;\"| 47/27\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff62; color:#000;\"| 59/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff08; color:#000;\"| 70/48\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 79/57\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#73ff00; color:#000;\"| 84/63\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#62ff00; color:#000;\"| 82/61\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#1aff00; color:#000;\"| 74/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff48; color:#000;\"| 63/40\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f9; color:#000;\"| 52/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00fff7; color:#000;\"| 40/22\n|-\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Bridgeport, CT |publisher = [[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Hartford, CT |publisher=[[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref>\n|}\n\n===Flora===\n\n{{main|Flora of Connecticut}}\n{{see also|List of Connecticut tree species}}\n\nForests consist of a mix of [[Northeastern coastal forests]] of Oak in southern areas of the state, to the upland [[New England-Acadian forests]] in the northwestern parts of the state.

In the 19th century, oystering boomed in New Haven, Bridgeport, and Norwalk and achieved modest success in neighboring towns.

Before then, [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and Hartford alternated as capitals.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Constitutional history===\n\n{{Main|History of the Connecticut Constitution}}\n\nConnecticut is known as the \"Constitution State\". The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.\n\nThe nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638\u201339. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.\n\nSeparate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.\n\n===Executive===\n\nThe governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2019}}, [[Ned Lamont]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Portal.CT.gov | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref> and [[Susan Bysiewicz]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.<ref name=Pumont/>\n\nThere are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, [[Connecticut Department of Developmental Services|Developmental Services]], Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs.

The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years. There also must always be between 30 and 50 senators and 125 to 225 representatives.

Its capital is [[Hartford]] and its most populous city is [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]. It is part of New England, although portions of it are often grouped with New York and [[New Jersey]] as the [[tri-state area]]. The state is named for the [[Connecticut River]] which approximately bisects the state. The word \"Connecticut\" is derived from various anglicized spellings of an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] word for \"long tidal river\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Trumbull|first=James Hammond|title=Indian Names of Places, Etc., in and on the Borders of Connecticut: With Interpretations of Some of Them|year=1881 |location=Harford, Connecticut |publisher=Press of the Case, Lockwood & Brainard Company |url={{google books|JS8TAAAAYAAJ|plainurl=yes|page=60}} |page=60}}</ref>\n\nConnecticut's first European settlers were Dutchmen who established a small, short-lived settlement called [[Fort Hoop]] in Hartford at the confluence of the [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park]] and Connecticut Rivers. Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River]]s, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which rejected British rule in the [[American Revolution]].\n\nConnecticut is the third smallest state by area,<ref name=\"census table 18\">{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 18, Area Measurements: 2010; and Population and Housing Unit Density: 1990 to 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=41 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> the 29th most populous,<ref>{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 19, Population by Urban and Rural and Type of Urban Area: 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=42 |access-date=May 16, 2014 }}</ref> and the fourth most densely populated<ref name=\"census table 18\" /> of the fifty states.

The state also has a long history of hosting the financial services industry, including insurance companies in Hartford and hedge funds in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]].\n\n==Geography==\n\n{{Main|Geology of Connecticut}}\n{{Further|Geology of New England}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Landmarks and cities of Connecticut\" widths=\"120\" heights=\"120\">\nFile:BridgeportCityHall.jpg|[[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]\nFile:New Haven from East Rock.jpg|[[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]\nFile:Hartford Connecticut Skyline.JPG|[[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]\nFile:StamfordCTRRstaLookingNE11112007.jpg|[[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]]\nFile:NewLondon 2016 Cropped.jpg|[[New London, Connecticut|New London]]\nFile:Willimantic.JPG|[[Willimantic, Connecticut|Willimantic]]\nFile:Amtrak's Thames River Bridge.jpg|[[Gold Star Bridge]] and [[Amtrak Thames River Bridge]]\nFile:Highest Point here.JPG|[[Mount Frissell]] is the highest point in the state.\nFile:LakeMcdonoughFromTunxisTrail.jpg|[[Barkhamsted, Connecticut#Notable locations|Lake McDonough]] reservoir\nFile:NASACandlewoodLakeConnecticut.jpg|[[Candlewood Lake]], Connecticut's largest\nFile:Connecticut River, Connecticut LCCN2012631727.tif|The [[Connecticut River]] near [[Connecticut Route 82]]\n</gallery>\n\nConnecticut is bordered on the south by [[Long Island Sound]], on the west by [[New York (state)|New York]], on the north by [[Massachusetts]], and on the east by [[Rhode Island]]. The state capital and fourth largest city is [[Hartford]], and other major cities and towns (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of [[Montenegro]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.\n[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|upright=1.25|thumb| ]]\n\nThe highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42\u00b03\u2032 N, 73\u00b029\u2032 W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}</ref> At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet (6 m) above sea level.\n\nConnecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history\u2014yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on [[Long Island Sound]], which is an [[estuary]]. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the \"race\" near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when [[tropical cyclones]] pass off the upper East Coast.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.\n\n{{further|List of Connecticut rivers}}\n\nConnecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[Village green|green]], such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in New England), Milford Green (second largest in New England) and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or [[inn]], several [[American colonial architecture|colonial houses]], and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.\n\nThe northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately {{convert|2.5|mile|km}} square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick's]] residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/SouthwickMA_WebDocs/southwick_jog.pdf |title=The Southwick Jog |last=Dodge |first=Edward R. |website=Town of Southwick, Massachusetts |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929023040/http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog |publisher=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024224307/http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |archivedate=October 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], and parts of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]]. This irregularity in the boundary is the result of [[History of Connecticut#Territorial disputes|territorial disputes]] in the late 17th century, culminating with New York giving up its claim to the area, whose residents considered themselves part of Connecticut, in exchange for an equivalent area extending northwards from [[Ridgefield, Connecticut|Ridgefield]] to the Massachusetts border, as well as undisputed claim to [[Rye (town), New York|Rye, New York]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |title=Connecticut's \"Panhandle\" |website=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314055555/http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |archivedate=March 14, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n{{further|Connecticut panhandle}}\n\nAreas maintained by the [[National Park Service]] include [[Appalachian National Scenic Trail]], [[Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor]], and [[Weir Farm National Historic Site]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Connecticut |website=National Park Service |accessdate=July 15, 2008 |url=http://www.nps.gov/state/ct/index.htm}}</ref>\n\n{{Rivers of Connecticut}}\n{{Mountains of Connecticut}}\n{{Waterbodies of Connecticut}}\n{{Islands and Peninsulas of Connecticut}}\n\n===Climate===\n\n[[File:Connecticut K\u00f6ppen.png|upright=1.35|thumb|left|K\u00f6ppen climate types in Connecticut]]\n[[File:Barndoor Hills original.JPG|thumb|Scenery upon [[Barndoor Hills]] in [[Granby, Connecticut|Granby]] in autumn]]\n[[File:Stamford Harbor Point Marina.jpg|thumb|350x350px|Harbor Point Marina in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] during summer]]\n\nConnecticut lies at the rough transition zone between the southern end of the [[humid continental climate]], and the northern portion of the temperate zone (or [[subtropical]] in some climate classifications). Northern Connecticut generally experiences a climate with cold winters with moderate snowfall and hot, humid summers. Far southern and coastal Connecticut has a climate with cool winters with a mix or rain and infrequent snow, and the long hot and humid summers typical of the middle and lower [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].\n\nConnecticut sees a fairly even precipitation pattern with rainfall/snowfall spread throughout the 12 months. Connecticut averages 56% of possible sunshine (higher than the U.S. national average), averaging 2,400 hours of [[sunshine]] annually.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |title=United States Annual Sunshine Map |website=HowStuffWorks |access-date=March 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110429042722/http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |archive-date=April 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nEarly spring (April) can range from slightly cool (40s to low 50s F) to warm (65 to 70 F), while mid and late spring (late April/May) is warm. By late May, the building [[Bermuda High]] creates a southerly flow of warm and humid tropical air, bringing hot weather conditions throughout the state, with average highs in New London of {{convert|81|F|C}} and {{convert|85|F|C}} in Windsor Locks at the peak of summer in late July. On occasion, heat waves with highs from 90 to {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} occur across Connecticut. Although summers are sunny in Connecticut, quick moving summer thunderstorms can bring brief downpours with thunder and lightning. Occasionally these thunderstorms can be severe, and the state usually averages one tornado per year.<ref name=\"tornadoes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|title=Annual average number of tornadoes|publisher=NOAA National Climatic Data Center|format=[[GIF]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030012752/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|archive-date=October 30, 2008|url-status=|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> During hurricane season, the remains of tropical cyclones occasionally affect the region, though a direct hit is rare.\n\nWeather commonly associated with the fall season typically begins in October and lasts to the first days of December. Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s \u00baF for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing.\n\nWinters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from {{convert|38|F|C}} in the coastal lowlands to {{convert|33|F|C}} in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about {{convert|60|in|mm}} in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only {{convert|20-25|in|mm}} along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton). Generally, any locale north or west of [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 84]] receives the most snow, during a storm, and throughout the season. Most of Connecticut has less than 60 days of snow cover. Snow usually falls from late November to late March in the northern part of the state, and from early December to mid-March in the southern and coastal parts of the state.\n\nConnecticut's record high temperature is {{convert|106|F|C}} which occurred in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] on July 15, 1995; the record low is {{convert|-32|F|C}} which occurred in the Northwest Hills [[Falls Village, Connecticut|Falls Village]] on February 16, 1943, and [[Coventry, Connecticut|Coventry]] on January 22, 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/getextreme.php?elem=ALL&state=CT| title = All-Time Climate Extremes for CT|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|Monthly normal high and low temperatures for various Connecticut cities (\u00b0F)\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000; height:17px;\"| City\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jan\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Feb\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Mar\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Apr\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| May\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jun\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jul\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Aug\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Sep\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Oct\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Nov\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Dec\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f8f3ca; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Bridgeport\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0ff; color:#000;\"| 37/23\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0fe; color:#000;\"| 40/25\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffae; color:#000;\"| 47/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff5e; color:#000;\"| 58/41\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f1; color:#000;\"| 68/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 77/60\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#7f0; color:#000;\"| 82/66\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#6eff00; color:#000;\"| 81/65\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#3f0; color:#000;\"| 74/58\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff2f; color:#000;\"| 63/46\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff7b; color:#000;\"| 53/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffd4; color:#000;\"| 42/28\n|-\n! style=\"background:#c5dfe1; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Hartford\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00d9ff; color:#000;\"| 35/16\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00f7ff; color:#000;\"| 39/19\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffc3; color:#000;\"| 47/27\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff62; color:#000;\"| 59/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff08; color:#000;\"| 70/48\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 79/57\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#73ff00; color:#000;\"| 84/63\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#62ff00; color:#000;\"| 82/61\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#1aff00; color:#000;\"| 74/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff48; color:#000;\"| 63/40\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f9; color:#000;\"| 52/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00fff7; color:#000;\"| 40/22\n|-\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Bridgeport, CT |publisher = [[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Hartford, CT |publisher=[[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref>\n|}\n\n===Flora===\n\n{{main|Flora of Connecticut}}\n{{see also|List of Connecticut tree species}}\n\nForests consist of a mix of [[Northeastern coastal forests]] of Oak in southern areas of the state, to the upland [[New England-Acadian forests]] in the northwestern parts of the state.

In the 19th century, oystering boomed in New Haven, Bridgeport, and Norwalk and achieved modest success in neighboring towns.

Before then, [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and Hartford alternated as capitals.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Constitutional history===\n\n{{Main|History of the Connecticut Constitution}}\n\nConnecticut is known as the \"Constitution State\". The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.\n\nThe nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638\u201339. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.\n\nSeparate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.\n\n===Executive===\n\nThe governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2019}}, [[Ned Lamont]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Portal.CT.gov | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref> and [[Susan Bysiewicz]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.<ref name=Pumont/>\n\nThere are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, [[Connecticut Department of Developmental Services|Developmental Services]], Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs.

The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years.

They were first released in 1986. The Flutter Ponies may appear delicate, but in truth, they possess a powerful ability called the '''Utter Flutter''', which allows them to blow away everything in their path by flapping their wings in a rapid speed. They are rarely seen, preferring to live in seclusion, usually in Flutter Valley. Honeysuckle, Morning Glory and Rosedust were the only notable ones in the first My Little Pony series.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed sortable\" style= cellpadding=\"10\" \"background: #E5C300;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#E5C300;\"|Name\n!style=\"background:#E5C300;\"|Gender\n!style=\"background:#E5C300;\"|Body Color\n!style=\"background:#E5C300;\"|Hair Color\n!style=\"background:#E5C300;\"|Eye Color\n!style=\"background:#E5C300;\"|Cutie Mark\n!style=\"background:#E5C300;\"|Debut Year\n!style=\"background:#E5C300;\"|Animation Debut\n!style=\"background:#E5C300;\"|[[Voice acting|Voice Actor]]\n!style=\"background:#E5C300;\"|Incarnation(s)\n|-\n|'''Forget-Me-Not'''\n|Female\n|Purple\n|White\n|Blue (Toy version)<br/>Green (Animation)\n|[[Forget-me-not]] Flowers\n|1986\n|[[My Little Pony (TV series)]]\n|[[B.

She was so graceful, gliding about in the water, just like they learned in swimming class. \"What a wonderful swimmer!\" Splasher said out loud. The baby sea pony looked up in response to Splasher's voice. \"Can you teach me to swim like that?\" Splasher asked, joining her in the water. The two baby sea ponies swam and played together until it was time to go home. \"You swim so well that I'm going to call you Backstroke,\" Splasher laughed.

They appear as Earth Ponies with a few distinctive features. Their form changes depending on their mood.  When they're in a sad, depressed mood, their manes and tails are flat and unstyled, their ears are always folded down, and their coats have a greyish hue. When they're in a happy mood (without the Crystal Heart), their manes and tails revert to different styles, their ears are up as normal, and their coats have a brighter hue. Additionally, mares get their decorations on their heads/hair. When in a more jubilant mood (with the Crystal Heart fully powered), all the Crystal Ponies retain their \"happy mood\" form and their bodies magically transform into a translucent crystallized form. The Crystal Heart also crystallizes the Mane Six, Spike, Shining Armor, and Princess Cadance as well, albeit briefly (possibly reverting them back to their original forms as they exit the Crystal Empire).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed sortable\" style= cellpadding=\"10\" \"background: #B57EDC;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#00FF60;\"|Name\n!style=\"background:#00FF60;\"|Gender\n!style=\"background:#00FF60;\"|Coat Color\n!style=\"background:#00FF60;\"|Mane Color\n!style=\"background:#00FF60;\"|Eye Color\n!style=\"background:#00FF60;\"|Cutie Mark\n!style=\"background:#00FF60;\"|Episode debut\n!style=\"background:#00FF60;\"|[[Voice acting|Voice Actor]]\n|-\n|'''Agatha/Amethyst Maresbury'''\n|Female\n|Purple-grey\n|Crystal-Pink\n|Dark Purple\n|[[Scroll]]\n|[[The Crystal Empire]]\n|[[Cathy Weseluck]]\n|-\n|FFB8EF;\" colspan=\"14\"|The [[librarian]] of the Crystal Empire.

They are known for being kind and truthful, and their culture emphasizes theatrical and musical entertainment. When angered, they take on a beast-like form referred to as \"Nirik\" (\"kirin\" spelled backwards). They were formally introduced in the season eight episode \"Sounds of Silence\", where the Kirin character Autumn Blaze revealed that after their anger and bickering destroyed their own village, the elder Rain Shine forced them to bathe in an enchanted river that suppressed their ability to express emotions or speak (however, \"foal's-breath\" flowers are able to reverse the effects).\n\n===Other related pony types===\n;Pony Friends\nThe Pony Friends is a sub-line of [[My Little Pony]], first released in 1986. They are composed of animals bearing the same brushable hair and cutie marks as the ponies, such as a giraffe named Creamsicle, a lion named Kingsley, a zebra named Zig Zag, a camel named Spunky, a panda named Nectar, a sheep named Woolly, a cow calf named Leafy, a kangaroo named Hoppy, an elephant named Edgar, a moose named Oakly, a dinosaur named Cutesaurus, and a llama named Cha Cha. Each of the Pony Friends never made an appearance in the animated series, until [[Friendship is Magic|My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic]]. The first one in the show was a [[zebra]].\n\n;Fairy Tails\nThe Fairy Tails is a short-lived sub-line, consisting of My Little Pony-esque birds, which are the titular Fairy Tails. The line was in stores from 1986 to 1987, corresponding with Year Five of original toy line. This year saw the release of the Pony Friends in the My Little Pony line, making it a distinct possibility that they and Fairy Tails were part of the same investigation into an expansion of My Little Pony that offered more than only ponies.\n\n;Dream Beauties\nDream Beauties is another sub-line of My Little Pony, released in 1988. These were Hasbro's attempt at a more realistic version of My Little Pony.\n\n;Takara variants\n{{Anchor|Osharena Pony}}\n{{Anchor|Kawaii Pony}}\nIn 1984, [[Takara]] (Later merged with Tomy to form [[Takara Tomy]]) released a line of My Little Pony toys, which were released in two types: {{nihongo|'''Osharena Pony'''|\u304a\u3057\u3083\u308c\u306a\u30dd\u30cb\u30fc|Osharena pon\u012b}} and {{nihongo|'''Kawaii Pony'''|\u304b\u308f\u3044\u3044\u30dd\u30cb\u30fc|Kawa\u012b pon\u012b}}. Only released in Japan, [[Bushiroad]] would eventually acquire the property from Takara Tomy 27 years later.\n\n==non-''Pony'' characters==\n\n===Dragons===\nAs of Friendship is Magic, there are three, then four and now five [[dragon]] characters who appeared in the whole franchise.

In Friendship is Magic, he's been redesigned again, now closely resembling his original counterpart except in this version, he has purple skin and lime green scales. Spike also handles communications between Twilight and Princess Celestia, burning Twilight's written messages with his fire breath to send them and then burping up the scrolls Celestia sends back. He frequently displays a sarcastic streak and laughs at others' misfortune, but can be counted on to help Twilight and her friends when they need him. He also eats [[gemstone]]s and it is shown that he has a crush on Rarity. In the season 2 episode \"Secret of my Excess\" he admits his crush to her which she accepts. Always helpful, he's genuinely concerned about his friends' well-being. He is regarded as a national hero for saving the Crystal Empire.

He has a strong influence over Fluttershy's decisions in the series, as he is far more assertive than the timid pegasus. However, he does seem to genuinely care for Fluttershy, as several of his actions toward her are usually just a little push to get her to do something he knows she wants.\n|-\n|'''Gummy'''\n|[[Alligator]]\n|Male\n|Green\n|None\n|Pale Violet\n|None\n|2011\n|[[My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic|Friendship Is Magic]]\n|None\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom: 3px solid #ADD7FF;\" colspan=\"14\"|Gummy is Pinkie Pie's pet [[alligator]]. Gummy appears to be usually calm, showing little interest to whatever happens around him. However, he also has a tendency to try biting various things and to hide in the water. When he's first introduced in Feeling Pinkie Keen, he shows rather aggressive behavior for a pet, because after Pinkie sets him on the floor, he proceeds to try to bite the pink Earth Pony repeatedly; as he has no teeth, this does no damage and Pinkie doesn't even seem to notice. The episode Party of One shows that his behavior is usually more peaceful, although he still tends to bite whatever happens to be near him. Most of the time, Gummy is docile to the point of absurdity, and in direct contrast with Pinkie Pie's crazed antics; he shows little to no awareness of his surroundings, often just sitting and staring into space with the same unchanging expression on his face at all times. No matter what is happening, Gummy usually just sits in place and stares at nothing, although he will occasionally attempt to bite nearby objects or even ponies. He's also able to \"dance\" to the music with his tail to be the only part of his body actually moving. He also seems to favor a ball of wool as his favorite toy, happily pushing it along with his nose or riding it as it rolls along. Pinkie seems convinced that Gummy is much more complex and lively than he appears to be. At the end of Party of One, for example, she said that Gummy was \"pretty upset\" about his party being unattended, despite the fact that Gummy had shown no change in his behavior or mood whatsoever.\n|-\n|'''Opalescence'''\n|[[Persian (cat)|Persian cat]]\n|Female\n|White\n|None\n|Light Lime\n|None\n|2011\n|[[My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic|Friendship Is Magic]]\n|\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom: 3px solid #ADD7FF;\" colspan=\"14\"|Opalescence is Rarity's pet [[Persian (cat)|Persian cat]].

They were first released in 1986. The Flutter Ponies may appear delicate, but in truth, they possess a powerful ability called the '''Utter Flutter''', which allows them to blow away everything in their path by flapping their wings in a rapid speed. They are rarely seen, preferring to live in seclusion, usually in Flutter Valley. Honeysuckle, Morning Glory and Rosedust were the only notable ones in the first My Little Pony series.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed sortable\" style= cellpadding=\"10\" \"background: #E5C300;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#E5C300;\"|Name\n!style=\"background:#E5C300;\"|Gender\n!style=\"background:#E5C300;\"|Body Color\n!style=\"background:#E5C300;\"|Hair Color\n!style=\"background:#E5C300;\"|Eye Color\n!style=\"background:#E5C300;\"|Cutie Mark\n!style=\"background:#E5C300;\"|Debut Year\n!style=\"background:#E5C300;\"|Animation Debut\n!style=\"background:#E5C300;\"|[[Voice acting|Voice Actor]]\n!style=\"background:#E5C300;\"|Incarnation(s)\n|-\n|'''Forget-Me-Not'''\n|Female\n|Purple\n|White\n|Blue (Toy version)<br/>Green (Animation)\n|[[Forget-me-not]] Flowers\n|1986\n|[[My Little Pony (TV series)]]\n|[[B.

They appear as Earth Ponies with a few distinctive features. Their form changes depending on their mood.  When they're in a sad, depressed mood, their manes and tails are flat and unstyled, their ears are always folded down, and their coats have a greyish hue. When they're in a happy mood (without the Crystal Heart), their manes and tails revert to different styles, their ears are up as normal, and their coats have a brighter hue. Additionally, mares get their decorations on their heads/hair. When in a more jubilant mood (with the Crystal Heart fully powered), all the Crystal Ponies retain their \"happy mood\" form and their bodies magically transform into a translucent crystallized form. The Crystal Heart also crystallizes the Mane Six, Spike, Shining Armor, and Princess Cadance as well, albeit briefly (possibly reverting them back to their original forms as they exit the Crystal Empire).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed sortable\" style= cellpadding=\"10\" \"background: #B57EDC;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#00FF60;\"|Name\n!style=\"background:#00FF60;\"|Gender\n!style=\"background:#00FF60;\"|Coat Color\n!style=\"background:#00FF60;\"|Mane Color\n!style=\"background:#00FF60;\"|Eye Color\n!style=\"background:#00FF60;\"|Cutie Mark\n!style=\"background:#00FF60;\"|Episode debut\n!style=\"background:#00FF60;\"|[[Voice acting|Voice Actor]]\n|-\n|'''Agatha/Amethyst Maresbury'''\n|Female\n|Purple-grey\n|Crystal-Pink\n|Dark Purple\n|[[Scroll]]\n|[[The Crystal Empire]]\n|[[Cathy Weseluck]]\n|-\n|FFB8EF;\" colspan=\"14\"|The [[librarian]] of the Crystal Empire.

They are known for being kind and truthful, and their culture emphasizes theatrical and musical entertainment. When angered, they take on a beast-like form referred to as \"Nirik\" (\"kirin\" spelled backwards). They were formally introduced in the season eight episode \"Sounds of Silence\", where the Kirin character Autumn Blaze revealed that after their anger and bickering destroyed their own village, the elder Rain Shine forced them to bathe in an enchanted river that suppressed their ability to express emotions or speak (however, \"foal's-breath\" flowers are able to reverse the effects).\n\n===Other related pony types===\n;Pony Friends\nThe Pony Friends is a sub-line of [[My Little Pony]], first released in 1986. They are composed of animals bearing the same brushable hair and cutie marks as the ponies, such as a giraffe named Creamsicle, a lion named Kingsley, a zebra named Zig Zag, a camel named Spunky, a panda named Nectar, a sheep named Woolly, a cow calf named Leafy, a kangaroo named Hoppy, an elephant named Edgar, a moose named Oakly, a dinosaur named Cutesaurus, and a llama named Cha Cha. Each of the Pony Friends never made an appearance in the animated series, until [[Friendship is Magic|My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic]]. The first one in the show was a [[zebra]].\n\n;Fairy Tails\nThe Fairy Tails is a short-lived sub-line, consisting of My Little Pony-esque birds, which are the titular Fairy Tails. The line was in stores from 1986 to 1987, corresponding with Year Five of original toy line. This year saw the release of the Pony Friends in the My Little Pony line, making it a distinct possibility that they and Fairy Tails were part of the same investigation into an expansion of My Little Pony that offered more than only ponies.\n\n;Dream Beauties\nDream Beauties is another sub-line of My Little Pony, released in 1988. These were Hasbro's attempt at a more realistic version of My Little Pony.\n\n;Takara variants\n{{Anchor|Osharena Pony}}\n{{Anchor|Kawaii Pony}}\nIn 1984, [[Takara]] (Later merged with Tomy to form [[Takara Tomy]]) released a line of My Little Pony toys, which were released in two types: {{nihongo|'''Osharena Pony'''|\u304a\u3057\u3083\u308c\u306a\u30dd\u30cb\u30fc|Osharena pon\u012b}} and {{nihongo|'''Kawaii Pony'''|\u304b\u308f\u3044\u3044\u30dd\u30cb\u30fc|Kawa\u012b pon\u012b}}. Only released in Japan, [[Bushiroad]] would eventually acquire the property from Takara Tomy 27 years later.\n\n==non-''Pony'' characters==\n\n===Dragons===\nAs of Friendship is Magic, there are three, then four and now five [[dragon]] characters who appeared in the whole franchise.

In the UK comic book series, he has 2 teeth and is the pet dragon of Majesty. In the 2000 Animated Specials, he is shown to be knowledgeable on things and gives the ponies some advice. In Friendship is Magic, he's been redesigned again, now closely resembling his original counterpart except in this version, he has purple skin and lime green scales. Spike also handles communications between Twilight and Princess Celestia, burning Twilight's written messages with his fire breath to send them and then burping up the scrolls Celestia sends back. He frequently displays a sarcastic streak and laughs at others' misfortune, but can be counted on to help Twilight and her friends when they need him. He also eats [[gemstone]]s and it is shown that he has a crush on Rarity. In the season 2 episode \"Secret of my Excess\" he admits his crush to her which she accepts. Always helpful, he's genuinely concerned about his friends' well-being. He is regarded as a national hero for saving the Crystal Empire. He was initially wingless until the season 8 episode \"Molt Down\" when he gets a sudden development of molting resulting him to get wings like all the dragons in Equestria.\n|-\n|'''Whimsey Weatherbe'''\n|Female\n|Orange\n|Yellow\n|Black\n|Brown\n|2009\n|[[My Little Pony: Twinkle Wish Adventure|Twinkle Wish Adventure]]\n|[[Keegan Connor Tracy]]\n|3\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom: 3px solid #00FF60;\" colspan=\"14\"|Whimsey Weatherbe is a female winged dragon, described to live in Willy Nilly Mountain at the outskirts of Ponyville.

She \"kidnaps\" Twinkle Wish, the wishing star in Ponyville after Scootaloo accidentally opens its box, leading to the ponies going to the mountain to retrieve it from her. After the ponies failed to convince her, she decides to give it back with a changed heart at the night of the Winter Wishes Festival.

They were banished to the human world by Star Swirl the Bearded. In the final battle against the Rainbooms, the band was defeated, causing the [[ruby]] gem pendants with which they controlled the students to shatter and explode.

Gummy appears to be usually calm, showing little interest to whatever happens around him. However, he also has a tendency to try biting various things and to hide in the water. When he's first introduced in Feeling Pinkie Keen, he shows rather aggressive behavior for a pet, because after Pinkie sets him on the floor, he proceeds to try to bite the pink Earth Pony repeatedly; as he has no teeth, this does no damage and Pinkie doesn't even seem to notice. The episode Party of One shows that his behavior is usually more peaceful, although he still tends to bite whatever happens to be near him. Most of the time, Gummy is docile to the point of absurdity, and in direct contrast with Pinkie Pie's crazed antics; he shows little to no awareness of his surroundings, often just sitting and staring into space with the same unchanging expression on his face at all times. No matter what is happening, Gummy usually just sits in place and stares at nothing, although he will occasionally attempt to bite nearby objects or even ponies. He's also able to \"dance\" to the music with his tail to be the only part of his body actually moving. He also seems to favor a ball of wool as his favorite toy, happily pushing it along with his nose or riding it as it rolls along. Pinkie seems convinced that Gummy is much more complex and lively than he appears to be. At the end of Party of One, for example, she said that Gummy was \"pretty upset\" about his party being unattended, despite the fact that Gummy had shown no change in his behavior or mood whatsoever.\n|-\n|'''Opalescence'''\n|[[Persian (cat)|Persian cat]]\n|Female\n|White\n|None\n|Light Lime\n|None\n|2011\n|[[My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic|Friendship Is Magic]]\n|\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom: 3px solid #ADD7FF;\" colspan=\"14\"|Opalescence is Rarity's pet [[Persian (cat)|Persian cat]].

Opal also seems to have a sarcastic sense of humor, chopping off some of Sweetie Belle's hair and offering a smug look afterwards when Sweetie Belle suggested she might be good with animals. She shares her owner's tastes in fashion and begrudgingly assists her with her work.

Reese''' (born March 24, 1966) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] former professional [[ice hockey]] [[goaltender]] who played eleven seasons in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) for the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], [[Calgary Flames]], [[Hartford Whalers]], [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] and [[New Jersey Devils]]. He was the goaltending coach for the Lightning from 2001 to 2009 and of the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] from 2009 to March 2015.<ref>\"JEFF REESE DEPARTS FLYERS COACHING STAFF\", Philadelphia Flyers press release, March 6, 2015</ref>\n\n==Playing career==\nThe [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] drafted Reese in the fourth round, 67th overall, of the [[1984 NHL Entry Draft]] from the [[London Knights]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/player.htm?id=8450743 |title=Jeff Reese - Stats - NHL.com - Players |publisher=NHL.com |date=1966-03-24 |accessdate=2013-12-15}}</ref>  He spent four seasons with the Knights before turning pro with the Maple Leafs American Hockey League farm team the Newmarket Saints in 1986.\n\n==Toronto Maple Leafs==\nDuring his second season as a pro he made his NHL debut when he was called up to Toronto and appeared in five games.  The following year he doubled his totals playing ten games with the Leafs and 37 more with Newmarket. In 1989-90 he logged 21 games with the Maple Leafs sharing duties with Allan Bester and Mark Laforest.  The following season he upped his totals to 30 games backing up rookie Peter Ing who won the starting job in Toronto.  A year later, the Maple Leafs made a blockbuster trade to bring in Hall of Famer Grant Fuhr to handle the goaltending duties (with Ing part of the package leaving town) allowing Reese to apprentice in the crease behind Fuhr but it was a short lived arrangement because Reese himself was soon part of an enormous trade.  On January 2, 1992, Reese was included in a ten-player trade that also sent [[Craig Berube]], [[Alexander Godynyuk]], [[Gary Leeman]] and [[Michel Petit]] to the Calgary Flames in exchange for [[Doug Gilmour]], [[Jamie Macoun]], [[Kent Manderville]], [[Ric Nattress]] and [[Rick Wamsley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=641298 |title=looks at some of the biggest deals in hockey history - NHL.com - NHL Insider |publisher=NHL.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-15}}</ref>\n\n==Calgary Flames==\nWith the Flames, Reese became the backup to incumbent [[Mike Vernon (ice hockey)|Mike Vernon]] and parts of three seasons in Calgary and played 26 games in 1992-93 posting an impressive 14-4-1 record. The highlight of his time in Calgary came on February 10, 1993, when he entered the NHL record book by posting three assists in a 13-1 Flames victory.<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.nhldigest.com/tag/jeff-reese/ |title=Jeff Reese NHL Digest |publisher=Nhldigest.com |date=2010-02-02 |accessdate=2013-12-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216001730/http://www.nhldigest.com/tag/jeff-reese/ |archive-date=2013-12-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  With the emergence of first round draft pick Trevor Kidd in the Flames net, Reese was out of a job and found himself on the move early in the 1993-94 season when Calgary traded him to the Hartford Whalers in exchange for defenseman Keczmer.\n\n==Hartford Whalers==\nIn Hartford he was acquired to back up [[Sean Burke]] and when Burke struggled with back issues, Reese and goaltender Frank Pietrangelo each logged 19-games in the Hartford crease.  Much like in Calgary before, the emergence of a younger netminder - this time Jason Muzzatti - pushed him out and led to a trade to the Tampa Bay Lightning\n\n==Tampa Bay Lightning==\nTampa Bay had a solid starting goalie in [[Daren Puppa]] but his backup, Jean-Claude Bergeron was struggling for the Lightning so the veteran Reese took over the duties and acquitted himself well with a 7-7-1 record in 19 appearances. During the off-season, he was on the move again when he was sent to New Jersey in a swap for goaltender [[Corey Schwab]].\n\n==New Jersey Devils==\nWith the Devils, Reese was slotted behind [[Martin Brodeur]] but quickly lost his backup job to rookie [[Mike Dunham]] and instead spent the majority of the 1996-97 season with the [[Detroit Vipers]] of the [[International Hockey League (1945\u20132001)|International Hockey League]], splitting time with starting goaltender [[Rich Parent]]. The duo combined to win the [[James Norris Memorial Trophy (IHL)|James Norris Memorial Trophy]], allowing the fewest goals in the league. The Vipers went on to win the 1997 [[Turner Cup]]. Reese was the starting goaltender for the Vipers during the 1997-98 season. He was named to the All-IHL Second Team in both 1997 and 1998.<ref>{{cite web|author=35 Jeff Reese |url=http://www.goaliesarchive.com/devils/reese.html |title=New Jersey Devils goaltending history : Jeff Reese |publisher=Goaliesarchive.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-15}}</ref>\n\n==Return to the Toronto Maple Leafs==\n\nAs an unrestricted free agent in the summer of 1998, Reese's career went full-circle when he signed with the Toronto Maple Leafs organization.  The Maple Leafs signed goaltender [[Curtis Joseph]] that summer as well and had planned to deal incumbent [[Felix Potvin]] away, but when that trade didn't transpire, that started the season with both Joseph and Potvin on the roster pushing Reese down to the minors.  He would play his final two NHL games with the Maple Leafs while also playing 27 games with the [[St. John's Maple Leafs]] of the [[American Hockey League]].   He was traded back to Tampa Bay in the off-season so they would have a veteran goalie to expose in the 1999 NHL Expansion Draft.  He was not selected by the Atlanta Thrashers and retired that summer.\n\n==Coaching career==\nAfter retiring Reese worked as a goalie coach with the Lightning organization and won a Stanley Cup with them in 2004.<ref name=\"LOH\">{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=18365 |title=Jeff Reese player profile |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2010-01-24}}</ref> On June 25, 2009, he was hired by the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] as their goalie coach, replacing [[R\u00e9jean Lemelin]].  On March 6, 2015, Reese and the Flyers management mutually agreed to part ways. He now works for the [[Dallas Stars]] as their goaltending coach.\n\n==Career statistics==\n\n===Regular season and playoffs===\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:75%\"\n|- ALIGN=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n! align=\"center\" colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" |  \n! align=\"center\" rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" |  \n! align=\"center\" colspan=\"9\" bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" | [[Regular season]]\n! align=\"center\" rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" |  \n! align=\"center\" colspan=\"8\" bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" | [[Playoffs]]\n|- ALIGN=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n!

On January 2, 1992, Reese was included in a ten-player trade that also sent [[Craig Berube]], [[Alexander Godynyuk]], [[Gary Leeman]] and [[Michel Petit]] to the Calgary Flames in exchange for [[Doug Gilmour]], [[Jamie Macoun]], [[Kent Manderville]], [[Ric Nattress]] and [[Rick Wamsley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=641298 |title=looks at some of the biggest deals in hockey history - NHL.com - NHL Insider |publisher=NHL.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-15}}</ref>\n\n==Calgary Flames==\nWith the Flames, Reese became the backup to incumbent [[Mike Vernon]] and parts of three seasons in Calgary and played 26 games in 1992-93 posting an impressive 14-4-1 record. The highlight of his time in Calgary came on February 10, 1993, when he entered the NHL record book by posting three assists in a 13-1 Flames victory.<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.nhldigest.com/tag/jeff-reese/ |title=Jeff Reese NHL Digest |publisher=Nhldigest.com |date=2010-02-02 |accessdate=2013-12-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216001730/http://www.nhldigest.com/tag/jeff-reese/ |archive-date=2013-12-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  With the emergence of first round draft pick Trevor Kidd in the Flames net, Reese was out of a job and found himself on the move early in the 1993-94 season when Calgary traded him to the Hartford Whalers in exchange for defenseman Keczmer.\n\n==Hartford Whalers==\nIn Hartford he was acquired to back up [[Sean Burke]] and when Burke struggled with back issues, Reese and goaltender Frank Pietrangelo each logged 19-games in the Hartford crease.  Much like in Calgary before, the emergence of a younger netminder - this time Jason Muzzatti - pushed him out and led to a trade to the Tampa Bay Lightning\n\n==Tampa Bay Lightning==\nTampa Bay had a solid starting goalie in [[Daren Puppa]] but his backup, Jean-Claude Bergeron was struggling for the Lightning so the veteran Reese took over the duties and acquitted himself well with a 7-7-1 record in 19 appearances. During the off-season, he was on the move again when he was sent to New Jersey in a swap for goaltender [[Corey Schwab]].\n\n==New Jersey Devils==\nWith the Devils, Reese was slotted behind [[Martin Brodeur]] but quickly lost his backup job to rookie [[Mike Dunham]] and instead spent the majority of the 1996-97 season with the [[Detroit Vipers]] of the [[International Hockey League (1945\u20132001)|International Hockey League]], splitting time with starting goaltender [[Rich Parent]]. The duo combined to win the [[James Norris Memorial Trophy (IHL)|James Norris Memorial Trophy]], allowing the fewest goals in the league. The Vipers went on to win the 1997 [[Turner Cup]]. Reese was the starting goaltender for the Vipers during the 1997-98 season. He was named to the All-IHL Second Team in both 1997 and 1998.<ref>{{cite web|author=35 Jeff Reese |url=http://www.goaliesarchive.com/devils/reese.html |title=New Jersey Devils goaltending history : Jeff Reese |publisher=Goaliesarchive.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-15}}</ref>\n\n==Return to the Toronto Maple Leafs==\n\nAs an unrestricted free agent in the summer of 1998, Reese's career went full-circle when he signed with the Toronto Maple Leafs organization.  The Maple Leafs signed goaltender [[Curtis Joseph]] that summer as well and had planned to deal incumbent [[Felix Potvin]] away, but when that trade didn't transpire, that started the season with both Joseph and Potvin on the roster pushing Reese down to the minors.  He would play his final two NHL games with the Maple Leafs while also playing 27 games with the [[St. John's Maple Leafs]] of the [[American Hockey League]].   He was traded back to Tampa Bay in the off-season so they would have a veteran goalie to expose in the 1999 NHL Expansion Draft.  He was not selected by the Atlanta Thrashers and retired that summer.\n\n==Coaching career==\nAfter retiring Reese worked as a goalie coach with the Lightning organization and won a Stanley Cup with them in 2004.<ref name=\"LOH\">{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=18365 |title=Jeff Reese player profile |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2010-01-24}}</ref> On June 25, 2009, he was hired by the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] as their goalie coach, replacing [[R\u00e9jean Lemelin]].  On March 6, 2015, Reese and the Flyers management mutually agreed to part ways. He now works for the [[Dallas Stars]] as their goaltending coach.\n\n==Career statistics==\n\n===Regular season and playoffs===\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:75%\"\n|- ALIGN=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n! align=\"center\" colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" |  \n! align=\"center\" rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" |  \n! align=\"center\" colspan=\"9\" bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" | [[Regular season]]\n! align=\"center\" rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" |  \n! align=\"center\" colspan=\"8\" bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" | [[Playoffs]]\n|- ALIGN=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n!

The school was founded in 1924 by Sir [[Frederick Gordon Guggisberg]], Dr. [[James Emman Kwegyir Aggrey]] and the [[Rev. Alexander (Alec) Garden Fraser|Rev. Alec Garden Fraser]]. It was formally opened in 1927 by Sir Frederick Guggisberg, then Governor of the British [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] colony.

The stylised piano-key design of the Achimota School crest was described by Aggrey at the time: \"You can play a tune of sorts on the black keys only; and you can play a tune of sorts on the white keys only; but for perfect harmony, you must use both the black and the white keys.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110724221438/http://www.ac2010.org/about_achimota.html Achimota School Capital Campaign], 24 July 2011, Ac2010.org.

As Guggisberg put it, \"In spite of the existence of one or two educational institutions of a secondary nature, the intellectual gap between the African who had completed his education at an English University and the semi-educated African of our primary school is dangerously wide. No one is more ready than I to sympathize with the legitimate aspirations of the African for advancement and for a greater share in the Government of this country, but if we are to help him to do this, if we are to protect the masses from the hasty and ill-conceived schemes of possible local [[demagogue]]s, we must hasten as rapidly as our means will allow to fill up the gap between the two classes.\"<ref name=\"gquote\">[[Frederick Gordon Guggisberg]], quoted in Stephanie Newell, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=lr8ZB43nY4UC&pg=PA93 Literary Culture in Colonial Ghana: How to Play the Game of Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927111336/http://books.google.ca/books?id=lr8ZB43nY4UC&pg=PA93 |date=27 September 2013 }}'', 2002, [[Manchester University Press]], 256 pages, p. 93. {{ISBN|978-0719062742}}</ref>\n\nAchimota College was therefore established as part of Guggisberg's plan to reform the Gold Coast educational system. In August 1920, Guggisberg met and befriended native-born Dr. [[James Aggrey]] who was in the Gold Coast as a member of the [[Phelps Stokes Fund]]'s African Education Commission. In 1922, as a result of the Phelps-Stokes Commission's 1920 report on education, Guggisberg appointed a committee to review its recommendations for Gold Coast education reform. That committee recommended the establishment of a comprehensive institution at Achimota to provide general secondary education, teacher training and technical education for male students. Achimota College was then conceived, thanks to the effort and support of Chiefs such as Nene Sir [[Emmanuel Mate Kole]], Konor of Manya Krobo; [[Nana Sir Ofori Atta]], Omanhene of [[Akyem Abuakwa]] and Nana Amonoo V, Omanhene of [[Anomabo]], as well as prominent statesmen of the time such as the Hon. Dr. [[Benjamin W. Quartey Quaye Papafio]], the Hon. [[F. V. Nanka-Bruce]], both of Accra; the Hon. [[Thomas Hutton-Mills, Sr.]] of Accra, the Hon. E. J. P. Brown of [[Cape Coast]], and the Hon. [[J. E. Casely-Hayford]] of [[Sekondi]].\n\nThe Colonial government meant to carry out its policy to establish an excellent secondary institution where teachers as well as students would be trained. The Legislative Council went on to approve the 1923\u201324 budget for the establishment of the Prince of Wales College and School, and in March 1924, Guggisberg laid the foundation stone. Rev. Alexander G. Fraser was the first Principal (1924\u20131935), and Dr. [[James Aggrey]] was the first Vice-Principal (1924\u20131927). Fraser had previously been Principal of [[Trinity College, Kandy]], an elite school in [[Ceylon]], now [[Sri Lanka]], and was hailed as the greatest colonial headmaster of his day by the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''. Aggrey campaigned vigorously for women's education at a time when the idea was not popular, and held the belief that to educate a man was to educate an individual, while educating a woman had more far-reaching benefits to family and community. This led to an increase in the number of places offered to girls by the College.\n\nFrom 1924 until it opened on 28 January 1927, Guggisberg, Fraser and Aggrey worked together to realise Guggisberg's dream of establishing a first-class co-educational school and college.

Sandy spent his vacations touring towns and villages where Old Achimotans were working to explain the aims and objectives of the OAA. The OAA\u2019s first annual general meeting was held at the school on 23 December 1930, and then once a year thereafter. The participants spend three or four days on the school\u2019s campus.\n*'''Constitution''': The OAA is governed by a constitution, whose principal objective is \"the formation of a bond of union between Old Achimotans and the School to promote the maintenance of their interest in the School and their willingness to assist in its welfare, and to promote the ideals for which Achimota was founded\".\n*'''National Executive Committee''': The OAA's affairs and funds are managed by a National Executive Committee. The Committee consists of three officers of the Association, two ex-officio officers, the immediate past President of the Association and eight other members. The National Executive Committee is elected biennially at an Annual General Meeting.

The school was founded in 1924 by Sir [[Frederick Gordon Guggisberg]], Dr. [[James Emman Kwegyir Aggrey]] and the [[Rev. Alexander (Alec) Garden Fraser|Rev. Alec Garden Fraser]]. It was formally opened in 1927 by Sir Frederick Guggisberg, then Governor of the British [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] colony. Achimota, modelled on the [[Public school (United Kingdom)|British public school]] system, was the first [[Mixed-gender education|mixed-gender school]] to be established on the Gold Coast.\n\nThe school has educated many African leaders, including [[Kwame Nkrumah]], [[Edward Akufo-Addo]], [[Jerry Rawlings|Jerry John Rawlings]], and [[John Evans Atta Mills]] all of whom are former [[Heads of State of Ghana]].

An alumnus/alumna of Achimota is known as an \"Akora\".\n\nThe motto of the school is ''[[Ut Omnes Unum Sint]]'' meaning \"That they all may be one\", a reference to the founders' expressed philosophy that starting in the context of school life, black and white, male and female, everyone should integrate and combine synergistically for the good of all. The stylised piano-key design of the Achimota School crest was described by Aggrey at the time: \"You can play a tune of sorts on the black keys only; and you can play a tune of sorts on the white keys only; but for perfect harmony, you must use both the black and the white keys.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110724221438/http://www.ac2010.org/about_achimota.html Achimota School Capital Campaign], 24 July 2011, Ac2010.org.

As Guggisberg put it, \"In spite of the existence of one or two educational institutions of a secondary nature, the intellectual gap between the African who had completed his education at an English University and the semi-educated African of our primary school is dangerously wide. No one is more ready than I to sympathize with the legitimate aspirations of the African for advancement and for a greater share in the Government of this country, but if we are to help him to do this, if we are to protect the masses from the hasty and ill-conceived schemes of possible local [[demagogue]]s, we must hasten as rapidly as our means will allow to fill up the gap between the two classes.\"<ref name=\"gquote\">[[Frederick Gordon Guggisberg]], quoted in Stephanie Newell, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=lr8ZB43nY4UC&pg=PA93 Literary Culture in Colonial Ghana: How to Play the Game of Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927111336/http://books.google.ca/books?id=lr8ZB43nY4UC&pg=PA93 |date=27 September 2013 }}'', 2002, [[Manchester University Press]], 256 pages, p. 93. {{ISBN|978-0719062742}}</ref>\n\nAchimota College was therefore established as part of Guggisberg's plan to reform the Gold Coast educational system. In August 1920, Guggisberg met and befriended native-born Dr. [[James Aggrey]] who was in the Gold Coast as a member of the [[Phelps Stokes Fund]]'s African Education Commission. In 1922, as a result of the Phelps-Stokes Commission's 1920 report on education, Guggisberg appointed a committee to review its recommendations for Gold Coast education reform. That committee recommended the establishment of a comprehensive institution at Achimota to provide general secondary education, teacher training and technical education for male students. Achimota College was then conceived, thanks to the effort and support of Chiefs such as Nene Sir [[Emmanuel Mate Kole]], Konor of Manya Krobo; [[Nana Sir Ofori Atta]], Omanhene of [[Akyem Abuakwa]] and Nana Amonoo V, Omanhene of [[Anomabo]], as well as prominent statesmen of the time such as the Hon. Dr. [[Benjamin W. Quartey Quaye Papafio]], the Hon. [[F. V. Nanka-Bruce]], both of Accra; the Hon. [[Thomas Hutton-Mills, Sr.]] of Accra, the Hon. E. J. P. Brown of [[Cape Coast]], and the Hon. [[J. E. Casely-Hayford]] of [[Sekondi]].\n\nThe Colonial government meant to carry out its policy to establish an excellent secondary institution where teachers as well as students would be trained. The Legislative Council went on to approve the 1923\u201324 budget for the establishment of the Prince of Wales College and School, and in March 1924, Guggisberg laid the foundation stone. Rev. Alexander G. Fraser was the first Principal (1924\u20131935), and Dr. [[James Aggrey]] was the first Vice-Principal (1924\u20131927). Fraser had previously been Principal of [[Trinity College, Kandy]], an elite school in [[Ceylon]], now [[Sri Lanka]], and was hailed as the greatest colonial headmaster of his day by the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''. Aggrey campaigned vigorously for women's education at a time when the idea was not popular, and held the belief that to educate a man was to educate an individual, while educating a woman had more far-reaching benefits to family and community. This led to an increase in the number of places offered to girls by the College.\n\nFrom 1924 until it opened on 28 January 1927, Guggisberg, Fraser and Aggrey worked together to realise Guggisberg's dream of establishing a first-class co-educational school and college.

Members of the OAA are known as \"Akoras\".\n\n*'''History''': The OAA was started in 1929 by the first principal of the then Prince of Wales College, Rev. Alec G. Fraser, whose son Sandy Fraser, then a member of Achimota School\u2019s staff, was the first organising secretary. Sandy spent his vacations touring towns and villages where Old Achimotans were working to explain the aims and objectives of the OAA. The OAA\u2019s first annual general meeting was held at the school on 23 December 1930, and then once a year thereafter. The participants spend three or four days on the school\u2019s campus.\n*'''Constitution''': The OAA is governed by a constitution, whose principal objective is \"the formation of a bond of union between Old Achimotans and the School to promote the maintenance of their interest in the School and their willingness to assist in its welfare, and to promote the ideals for which Achimota was founded\".\n*'''National Executive Committee''': The OAA's affairs and funds are managed by a National Executive Committee. The Committee consists of three officers of the Association, two ex-officio officers, the immediate past President of the Association and eight other members. The National Executive Committee is elected biennially at an Annual General Meeting. The OAA Alumni Office assists the National Executive Committee in its work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldachimotan.net |title=Welcome to the Old Achimotan Web SIte |publisher=Oldachimotan.net |accessdate=31 August 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615034845/http://www.oldachimotan.net/ |archivedate=15 June 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://web.archive.org/web/20130723070314/http://www.achimota.edu.gh/}}\n* {{commons-inline|Category:Achimota School|Achimota School}}\n{{Accra}}\n{{High schools in Ghana}}\n[[Category:High schools in Ghana]]\n[[Category:Education in Accra]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1924]]\n[[Category:Boarding schools in Ghana]]\n[[Category:1924 establishments in Gold Coast (British colony)]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Achimota School]]\n[[Category:Christian schools in Ghana]]\n[[Category:Public schools]]\n[[Category:Public Schools in Ghana]]\n[[Category:Schools in Africa]]\n[[Category:Schools in Accra]]\n[[Category:Greater Accra Region]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Reword - you can't be \"among one\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achimota_School"}
