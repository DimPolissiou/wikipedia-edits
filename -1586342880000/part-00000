The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} to an easterly low Earth orbit or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} by {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} foot payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle, and in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle. NASA determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. In August 1972, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167, 170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding. Construction was completed on September 17, 1976, and ''Enterprise'' was moved to [[Edwards AFB]] to begin testing.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173}}<ref name=\"enterprise_overview\">{{cite web |last= Howell |first= Elizabeth |title= Enterprise: The Test Shuttle |publisher= Space.com |date= October 9, 2012 |url= https://www.space.com/17983-space-shuttle-enterprise.html |accessdate= April 24, 2019}}</ref> Rockwell constructed the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA)-098, which was a structural truss mounted to the ET with three RS-25 engines attached. It was tested at the [[Stennis Space Center|National Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL)]] to ensure that the engines could safely run through the launch profile.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II-163}} Rockwell conducted mechanical and thermal stress tests on Structural Test Article (STA)-099 to determine the effects of aerodynamic and thermal stresses during launch and reentry.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|38\u201339}}<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|I-415}}\n\nThe beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was delayed for nine months while [[Pratt & Whitney]] challenged the contract that had been issued to Rocketdyne. The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}}<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test, where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December 29, 1980. The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft. On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]]. During the two-day mission, Young and Crippen tested equipment on board the shuttle, and found several of the ceramic tiles had fallen off the top side of the ''Columbia''. NASA coordinated with the Air Force to use satellites to image the underside of ''Columbia'', and determined there was no damage. ''Columbia'' reentered the atmosphere on April 14, and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|48\u201352}}<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|177\u2013178}}\n\nNASA conducted three additional test flights with ''Columbia'' in 1981 and 1982. On July 4, 1982, [[STS-4]], flown by [[Ken Mattingly]] and [[Henry Hartsfield]], landed at Edwards AFB. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and his wife [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]] met the crew, and delivered a speech. After STS-4, NASA declared the Space Shuttle operational.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|178\u2013179}}\n\n==Description==\nThe Space Shuttle was the first operational orbital spacecraft designed for [[Reusable launch system|reuse]].

The KSC was responsible for launch, landing and turnaround operations for equatorial orbits (the only orbit profile actually used in the program), the U.S. Air Force at the [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] was responsible for launch, landing and turnaround operations for polar orbits (though this was never used), the [[Johnson Space Center]] (JSC) served as the central point for all Shuttle operations, the MSFC was responsible for the main engines, external tank, and solid rocket boosters, the [[John C. Stennis Space Center]] handled main engine testing, and the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] managed the global tracking network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/centers.html |title=NASA Centers And Responsibilities |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|last=Dumoulin|first=Jim |date=August 31, 2000 |accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Orbiter===\n{{main|Space Shuttle orbiter}}\n[[File:Shuttle profiles.jpg|center|thumb|upright=2.65|Shuttle launch profiles.

Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]]. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|64\u201368, 100, 124}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365, 382\u2013389, 408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

When the U.S. space station evolved into the International Space Station project, which suffered from long delays and design changes before it could be completed, the retirement of the Space Shuttle was delayed several times until 2011, serving at least 15 years longer than originally planned.

Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} to an easterly low Earth orbit or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} by {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} foot payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle, and in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle. NASA determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. In August 1972, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167, 170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding. Construction was completed on September 17, 1976, and ''Enterprise'' was moved to [[Edwards AFB]] to begin testing.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173}}<ref name=\"enterprise_overview\">{{cite web |last= Howell |first= Elizabeth |title= Enterprise: The Test Shuttle |publisher= Space.com |date= October 9, 2012 |url= https://www.space.com/17983-space-shuttle-enterprise.html |accessdate= April 24, 2019}}</ref> Rockwell constructed the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA)-098, which was a structural truss mounted to the ET with three RS-25 engines attached. It was tested at the [[Stennis Space Center|National Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL)]] to ensure that the engines could safely run through the launch profile.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II-163}} Rockwell conducted mechanical and thermal stress tests on Structural Test Article (STA)-099 to determine the effects of aerodynamic and thermal stresses during launch and reentry.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|38\u201339}}<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|I-415}}\n\nThe beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was delayed for nine months while [[Pratt & Whitney]] challenged the contract that had been issued to Rocketdyne. The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}}<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test, where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December 29, 1980. The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft. On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]]. During the two-day mission, Young and Crippen tested equipment on board the shuttle, and found several of the ceramic tiles had fallen off the top side of the ''Columbia''. NASA coordinated with the Air Force to use satellites to image the underside of ''Columbia'', and determined there was no damage. ''Columbia'' reentered the atmosphere on April 14, and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|48\u201352}}<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|177\u2013178}}\n\nNASA conducted three additional test flights with ''Columbia'' in 1981 and 1982. On July 4, 1982, [[STS-4]], flown by [[Ken Mattingly]] and [[Henry Hartsfield]], landed at Edwards AFB. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and his wife [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]] met the crew, and delivered a speech. After STS-4, NASA declared the Space Shuttle operational.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|178\u2013179}}\n\n==Description==\nThe Space Shuttle was the first operational orbital spacecraft designed for [[Reusable launch system|reuse]].

The KSC was responsible for launch, landing and turnaround operations for equatorial orbits (the only orbit profile actually used in the program), the U.S. Air Force at the [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] was responsible for launch, landing and turnaround operations for polar orbits (though this was never used), the [[Johnson Space Center]] (JSC) served as the central point for all Shuttle operations, the MSFC was responsible for the main engines, external tank, and solid rocket boosters, the [[John C. Stennis Space Center]] handled main engine testing, and the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] managed the global tracking network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/centers.html |title=NASA Centers And Responsibilities |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|last=Dumoulin|first=Jim |date=August 31, 2000 |accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Orbiter===\n{{main|Space Shuttle orbiter}}\n[[File:Shuttle profiles.jpg|center|thumb|upright=2.65|Shuttle launch profiles. From left: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''.]]\n\nThe orbiter had design elements and capabilities of both a rocket and an aircraft to allow it to launch vertically and then land as a glider. Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]]. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|64\u201368, 100, 124}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365, 382\u2013389, 408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

A struggle of wills begins between the authorities and the villagers, who resort to a variety of ways to prevent damage to the historic island. Harry Tilney ([[Niall MacGinnis]]) is all for taking on the government, but his compatriot, Sally ([[Muriel Pavlow]]) has a boyfriend stationed at the nearby [[Royal Air Force]] base, Corporal Bill Morris ([[John Gregson]]), so she goes to see him first.\n\nMeanwhile, Squadron Leader Parsons ([[Kieron Moore]]) is informed that his unit's mission is being changed to ground attack. The [[de Havilland Vampire]] jets have to be modified to mount rockets. Parsons is informed he will have three weeks for the conversion, then four weeks to get his men trained. His commanding officer is not at liberty to inform him that the unit will then be sent overseas, but he takes the hint.\n\nThe land acquisition is assigned to a bureaucrat, Mr. Wentworth ([[William Mervyn]]), which is rather awkward for him, as he is a prominent member of a bird watching society. He comes to discuss the situation with Harry, but Harry is drunk and drives him away. The villagers then learn that fishing rights to the area were granted to the people by Henry VIII. \"Soapy\" ([[Bartlett Mullins]]), the professional eel catcher, can squat on the land and use those rights to block the acquisition. However, Soapy receives a letter from the government stating that there is no evidence that such rights exist.\n\n\"Bookie\" ([[Charles Lloyd-Pack]]) then discovers that the land was given to the Church by Henry VIII for assistance in quelling a rebellion. The villagers present this information to Parsons. He agrees to pass it along to the Government, but in the meantime he insists on continuing with the training.\n\nIn desperation, the local people take to their boats and sail to the island, to occupy the target area and prevent the first attack run. However, the field telephone wire is broken as they come ashore, meaning the RAF controller on the range cannot get a message through to have the flight cancelled. Low cloud cover conceals the site from the approaching aircraft, which commence their attack run, but fortunately the protestors are spotted by the leading aircraft and the attack is aborted just in time to avoid a disaster.\n\nThe near miss means that there will have to be an official inquiry, which will take months or a year, by which time the unit will have been sent to Malaya.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[John Gregson]] as Cpl.

A struggle of wills begins between the authorities and the villagers, who resort to a variety of ways to prevent damage to the historic island. Harry Tilney ([[Niall MacGinnis]]) is all for taking on the government, but his compatriot, Sally ([[Muriel Pavlow]]) has a boyfriend stationed at the nearby [[Royal Air Force]] base, Corporal Bill Morris ([[John Gregson]]), so she goes to see him first.\n\nMeanwhile, Squadron Leader Parsons ([[Kieron Moore]]) is informed that his unit's mission is being changed to ground attack. The [[de Havilland Vampire]] jets have to be modified to mount rockets. Parsons is informed he will have three weeks for the conversion, then four weeks to get his men trained. His commanding officer is not at liberty to inform him that the unit will then be sent overseas, but he takes the hint.\n\nThe land acquisition is assigned to a bureaucrat, Mr. Wentworth ([[William Mervyn]]), which is rather awkward for him, as he is a prominent member of a bird watching society. He comes to discuss the situation with Harry, but Harry is drunk and drives him away. The villagers then learn that fishing rights to the area were granted to the people by Henry VIII. \"Soapy\" ([[Bartlett Mullins]]), the professional eel catcher, can squat on the land and use those rights to block the acquisition. However, Soapy receives a letter from the government stating that there is no evidence that such rights exist.\n\n\"Bookie\" ([[Charles Lloyd-Pack]]) then discovers that the land was given to the Church by Henry VIII for assistance in quelling a rebellion. The villagers present this information to Parsons. He agrees to pass it along to the Government, but in the meantime he insists on continuing with the training.\n\nIn desperation, the local people take to their boats and sail to the island, to occupy the target area and prevent the first attack run. However, the field telephone wire is broken as they come ashore, meaning the RAF controller on the range cannot get a message through to have the flight cancelled. Low cloud cover conceals the site from the approaching aircraft, which commence their attack run, but fortunately the protestors are spotted by the leading aircraft and the attack is aborted just in time to avoid a disaster.\n\nThe near miss means that there will have to be an official inquiry, which will take months or a year, by which time the unit will have been sent to Malaya.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[John Gregson]] as Cpl.

Also an author, Shaw wrote both fiction and non-fiction.\n\nWidely regarded as \"one of jazz's finest clarinetists\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/artie-shaw-p7522/discography/compilations |title=Artie Shaw |website=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=March 31, 2012}}</ref> Shaw led one of the United States' most popular [[big bands]] in the late 1930s through the early 1940s. Though he had numerous hit records, he was perhaps best known for his 1938 recording of [[Cole Porter]]'s \"[[Begin the Beguine]]\". Before the release of \"Beguine\", Shaw and his fledgling band had languished in relative obscurity for over two years and, after its release, he became a major pop artist within short order. The record eventually became one of the era's defining recordings. Musically restless, Shaw was also an early proponent of what became known much later as ''[[Third Stream]]'' music, which blended elements of classical and jazz forms and traditions. His music influenced other musicians, such as [[Monty Norman]] in England, with the vamp of the [[James Bond Theme]], possibly influenced by 1938's \"Nightmare\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jazziz.com/short-history-nightmare-artie-shaw-1936/|title=A short history of\u2026 \u201cNightmare\u201d (Artie Shaw, 1936)|last=Micucci|first=Matt|date=2017-07-18|website=JAZZIZ Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-10}}</ref>\n\nShaw also recorded with small jazz groups drawn from within the ranks of the various [[big band]]s he led. He served in the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] from 1942 to 1944, (during which time he led a morale-building band that toured the South Pacific amidst the chaos of [[World War II]]) and, following his discharge in 1944, he returned to lead a band through 1945. Following the breakup of that band, he began to focus on other interests and gradually withdrew from the world of being a professional musician and major celebrity, although he remained a force in popular music and jazz before retiring from music completely in 1954.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Artie Shaw, King of the Clarinet: His Life and Times|last = Nolan|first = Tom|publisher = W.

Shaw bought a saxophone by working in a grocery store and began learning the saxophone at 13. At 16, he switched to the clarinet and left home to tour with a band.\n\n==Career==\nReturning to New York, he became a session musician through the early 1930s. From 1925\u201336, Shaw performed with many bands and orchestras; from 1926 to 1929, he worked in [[Cleveland]] and established a lasting reputation as music director and arranger for an orchestra led by the violinist Austin Wylie. In 1929 and 1930, he played with [[Irving Aaronson]]'s Commanders, where he was exposed to symphonic music, which he would later incorporate in his arrangements. In 1932, Shaw joined the [[Roger Wolfe Kahn]] Orchestra and made several recordings with the outfit including \"[[It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)]]\" and [[Fit as a Fiddle (song)|\"Fit as a Fiddle\"]].\n\n===Leader of bands===\nIn 1935, he first gained attention with his \"Interlude in B-flat\" at a swing concert at the [[Imperial Theatre (Broadway)|Imperial Theater]] in New York.<ref name=\"white\">White, John.

Trumpeter [[Roy Eldridge]] became part of the group, succeeding [[Billy Butterfield]]. In 1940, the original Gramercy Five pressed eight records, then Shaw dissolved the band in early 1941. The Gramercy Five's biggest hit was \"Summit Ridge Drive\", one of Shaw's million-selling singles. His last prewar band, organized in September 1941, included Oran \"Hot Lips\" Page, Max Kaminsky, Georgie Auld, [[Dave Tough]], [[Jack Jenney]], [[Ray Conniff]] and Guarnieri.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/jazz/biography/artist_id_shaw_artie.htm|title=JAZZ A Film By Ken Burns: Selected Artist Biography \u2013 Artie Shaw|website=Pbs.org|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThroughout his career, Shaw had a habit of forming bands, developing them according to his immediate aspirations, making a quick series of records, and then disbanding. He generally did not stick around long enough to reap his bands' successes through live performances of their recorded hits. Following the breakup of what was already his second band in 1939, he rarely toured at all and, if he did, his personal appearances were usually limited to long-term engagements in a single venue or bookings that did not require much traveling, unlike many bands of the era that traveled great distances doing seemingly endless strings of one-night engagements. Apart from his interest in music, Shaw had a tremendous intellect and almost insatiable thirst for intellectual knowledge and literature. During his self-imposed \"sabbaticals\" from the music business, his interests included studying advanced mathematics, as cited in [[Karl Sabbagh]]'s ''The [[Riemann Hypothesis]]''.<ref name=\"Riemann\">Sabbagh, Karl. ''The Riemann Hypothesis: The Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics'', Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 2004; {{ISBN|0-374-52935-3}}</ref>\n\nThe long series of musical groups Shaw formed included [[Billie Holiday]], [[Lena Horne]], [[Helen Forrest]], [[Mel Torm\u00e9]], [[Buddy Rich]], [[Dave Tough]], [[Barney Kessel]], [[Jimmy Raney]], [[Tal Farlow]], [[Dodo Marmarosa]], and [[Ray Conniff]]. He used the morose \"Nightmare\", with its [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] nuances, as his theme rather than choosing a more accessible song. In a televised interview in the 1970s, Shaw derided the \"asinine\" songs of [[Tin Pan Alley]] that were the lifeblood of popular music and which bands, especially the most popular (such as his own) were compelled to play night after night. In 1994, he told Frank Prial (''[[The New York Times]]''), \"I thought that because I was Artie Shaw I could do what I wanted, but all they wanted was 'Begin the Beguine'\".<ref>Prial, Frank J. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DE5DD1F30F93BA2575BC0A962958260 \"At Home with: Artie Shaw; Literary Life, After Ending the Beguine\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 18, 1994.</ref>\n\n===Radio days===\n[[File:Artie Shaw Playing.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|right|Artie Shaw performs his \"[[Concerto for Clarinet (Shaw)|Concerto for Clarinet]]\" in 1940.]]\nShaw did many [[big band remote]] broadcasts. Throughout the autumn and winter of 1938, he was often heard from the Blue Room of the Hotel Lincoln in New York. After touring in 1939, he led the house band at the Cafe Rouge of the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York. He was the headliner of a radio series with comedian [[Robert Benchley]] as emcee.<ref name=\"white\"/> Shaw broadcast on CBS from November 20, 1938 until November 14, 1939. At the Cafe Rouge he quit his band that week and went to Mexico. The band continued without him into January but eventually broke up. After Shaw returned from Mexico in 1940, and still under contract to RCA Victor, he experimented with a group of session musicians in Hollywood, trying to combine strings and woodwinds with a jazz band. The result was the hit \"Frenesi\".\n\nHe was hired as bandleader for the ''Burns and Allen Show'' broadcast from Hollywood. He organized a band that was modeled after his swing band concept of the late 1930s with the addition of six violins, two violas, and one cello. The addition of a string section to a popular big band was not novel, as it had been done by [[Paul Whiteman]] and others since the 1920s. Shaw updated the idea with the music trends of the 1940s. Strings gave him a wider tonal palette and allowed him to concentrate on ballads rather than the fast dance songs of the swing era. Shaw was at or near the top of the list of virtuoso jazz bandleaders. The band was showcased on the Burns and Allen program every week.\n\nIn 1940, at the height of his popularity, the 30-year-old Shaw earned up to $60,000 per week.<ref name=\"white\"/> In contrast, [[George Burns]] and [[Gracie Allen]] were each making $5,000 per week during the year that Shaw and his orchestra provided the music for their radio show.<ref>\"Business & Finance: Nat & Googie\". ''Time''. January 30, 1933.</ref> He acted on the show as a love interest for Gracie Allen, although he disliked having to be a part of the celebrity culture of the period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dismuke.org/how/prev1-05.html|title=Dismuke's Hit Of The Week|website=Dismuke.org}}</ref>\n\nShaw's contract was renewed for another 13 weeks when the program was moved to New York. Shaw broke up the Hollywood band, keeping a nucleus of seven musicians in addition to himself, and filled out the ensemble with New York musicians until March 1941. While taking a few months vacation in the spring of 1941 to reassess what to do next, Shaw recorded in another small group format with three horns and a four-man rhythm section with the addition of a dozen strings and. By September, he formed a big band with seven brass, five saxes, four rhythm, and fifteen strings. Remote broadcasts noted the band performing in good form and Shaw dazzling the crowd with his clarinet. On December 7, three months into the tour, the 31-piece band was in the midst of a matinee performance in Providence, Rhode Island, when he was given a note about the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor. The note instructed him to tell military personnel to return to their bases. As the audience left, he knew the band was coming to an end.\n\n===War and after===\n[[File:Artie Shaw and the Rangers.jpg|thumb|Artie Shaw and The Rangers, 1943]]\nDuring World War II, Shaw enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] and shortly after formed a band, which served in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific theater]] (just as [[Glenn Miller]]'s wartime band served in the UK and Europe). After 18 months playing for Navy personnel, (sometimes as many as four concerts a day in battle zones, including [[Guadalcanal]]), Shaw returned to the U.S. in a state of physical exhaustion and received a medical discharge.<ref>Susman, Gary. \"Goodbye\", ''Entertainment Weekly''. January 3, 2005.</ref> After the war, the popularity of big bands declined, as [[Crooner|Crooners]] and [[Bebop]] began to dominate the charts.\n\n[[File:Artie Shaw (Gottlieb 07771).jpg|thumb|left|Artie Shaw, ca 1947. Photograph by [[William P. Gottlieb]]]]\n\nShaw credited his time in the Navy from 1942 to 1944 as a period of renewed introspection.<ref name=\"autobio\">{{Cite book|last=Shaw|first=Artie|title=The Trouble with Cinderella|year=1952|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Young|isbn=1-56474-020-X|url=https://archive.org/details/troublewithcinde00shaw}}</ref> After his discharge, he entered psychoanalysis and began to withdraw from music in favor of a writing career. His autobiography, ''The Trouble With Cinderella: An Outline of Identity'', was published in 1952 (with later reprint editions in 1992 and 2001). Revealing downbeat elements of the music business, Shaw explained that \"the trouble with Cinderella\" is \"nobody ever lives happily ever after.\"<ref name=\"autobio\"/> He turned to semi-autobiographical fiction with the three short novels in ''I Love You, I Hate You, Drop Dead!'' (1965, reprinted in 1997), which prompted [[Terry Southern]]'s comment: \"Here is a deeply probing examination of the American marital scene. I flipped over it!\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615221645/http://www.artieshaw.com/books-ily.html|title=Books by Artie Shaw- I Love You, I Hate You, Drop Dead!|date=June 15, 2008|website=Web.archive.org}}</ref> Shaw's short stories, including \"Snow White in Harlem\", were collected in ''The Best of Intentions and Other Stories'' (1989). He worked for years on his 1000-page autobiographical novel, ''The Education of Albie Snow'', but the three-volume work remained unpublished.\n\nAfter his discharge in 1944, he formed another band, this time what could be considered a modern big band in that it contained what is now considered the standard eight brass and five saxes. It did not include any strings and was based in Hollywood, California, where Shaw was living. He continued to record for RCA Victor, as he had before the war, and limited the band's personal appearances to military bases in California. In August 1945 his contract with RCA ended and he signed with an independent label, [[Musicraft]]. He made a few records for Musicraft before the band broke up, and all of the recordings for Musicraft from 1946 were staffed by top-notch session musicians. The big band was back in the studio, this time including strings. On these Musicraft recordings in 1946 Shaw featured the young singer Mel Torm\u00e9. On some of the sides, Torme was also featured with his vocal group the Meltones.\n\nIn July 1954, Shaw undertook a brief but historic Australian tour for promoter [[Lee Gordon (promoter)|Lee Gordon]] on which he shared the bill with drummer [[Buddy Rich]] and vocalist [[Ella Fitzgerald]]. After completing that tour Shaw stopped playing the clarinet, citing his own perfectionism, which, he later said, would have killed him. He explained to a reporter, \"In the world we live in, compulsive perfectionists finish last. You have to be [[Lawrence Welk]] or, on another level, [[Irving Berlin]], and write the same kind of music over and over again. I'm not able to do that, and I have taken the clarinet as far as anyone can possibly go. To continue playing would be a disservice.\"<ref>Freedland, Michael. \"'Jazz is like jumping off a cliff'\", ''The Telegraph'', March 15, 2001.</ref> He spent the rest of the 1950s living in Europe.\n\nIn 1983, after years of prodding by Williard Alexander, the 73-year-old Shaw organized a band and selected clarinetist [[Dick Johnson (clarinetist)|Dick Johnson]] as bandleader and soloist. The 58-year-old Johnson, an accomplished woodwind and saxophonist and native of Brockton, Massachusetts, was no stranger to jazz having recorded numerous albums of his own and had idolized Shaw's playing throughout his life. Shaw's music library, which was the product of his almost 20 years of activity in the music business, contained numerous arrangements of monumental status of popular music in addition to many original big band jazz compositions of the era. It was a collection of music arranged by some of the foremost composer/arrangers of the period, much of which was sketched out by Shaw himself and filled in and completed by his orchestrator/arranger collaborators, among them [[Jerry Gray]], [[William Grant Still]], [[Lennie Hayton]], Ray Conniff, [[Eddie Sauter]], and [[Jimmy Mundy]], to name a few. Shaw rehearsed his new band, (based out of Boston, Massachusetts), and the band made its official debut on New Year's Eve 1984 at the [[Glen Island Casino]] in [[New Rochelle]], New York, the same launching pad for many bands of the swing era decades earlier, when Shaw and his bands were in their prime. Shaw appeared with the band throughout its first few years, limiting his role to being its conductor and front man, while leaving the clarinet playing duties to Johnson. In 1985, another week-long series of strenuous rehearsals followed during which Shaw added more repertoire, including many arrangements and compositions that were from the later years of his career Shaw had never recorded. By 1987 though, Shaw was no longer touring with the band, quietly content that Johnson and the band kept true to Shaw's band spirit and vision. He would, however, show up on occasion \"just to hear how things sounded\".{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Films and television===\nShaw made several musical shorts in 1939 for [[Vitaphone]] and [[Paramount Pictures]]. He portrayed himself in the [[Fred Astaire]] film, ''[[Second Chorus]]'' (1940), which featured Shaw and his orchestra playing ''[[Concerto for Clarinet (Shaw)|Concerto for Clarinet]]'', and his 1940\u201341 Hollywood period ''Star Dust'' band can be heard throughout the soundtrack. The film garnered him two Oscar nominations for Best Score and Best Song (\"Love of My Life\").<ref>Wilson, Jeff. \"Artie Shaw, 94: Top bandleader of swing era\". ''Toronto Star''.

His 1940 recording of \"[[Stardust (1927 song)|Stardust]]\" was used in its entirety in the closing credits of the film ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth (film)|The Man Who Fell to Earth]]''. [[Martin Scorsese]] also used the Shaw theme song, \"Nightmare\", in his [[Academy Award]]-winning [[Howard Hughes]] biopic, ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]].''\n\nCanadian filmmaker Brigitte Berman interviewed [[Hoagy Carmichael]], [[Doc Cheatham]], and others including Shaw for her documentary film, ''Bix: Ain't None of Them Play Like Him Yet'' (1981) about [[Bix Beiderbecke]], and afterward she went on to create an [[Academy Award]]-winning documentary, ''Artie Shaw: Time Is All You've Got'' (1985), featuring extensive interviews with Shaw, Buddy Rich, Mel Torm\u00e9, Helen Forrest, and other musicians, in addition to Shaw's eighth wife, actress [[Evelyn Keyes]]. The documentary ends with Shaw rehearsing his new band with co-leader Johnson present and rolls to credits perhaps quite fittingly with the band taking a final segue to Shaw's theme song ''Nightmare.'' In 2000, filmmaker [[Ken Burns]] interviewed Shaw at his home for his PBS documentary/miniseries ''[[Jazz (TV series)|Jazz]]'' where Shaw appears in multiple segments. His last major interview was in 2003, when he was interviewed by [[Russell Davies]] for the [[BBC]] Television documentary, ''Artie Shaw \u2013 Quest for Perfection''. The documentary includes interviews with surviving members of his original bands, Johnson, and other music industry professionals.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==Personal life==\nA self-proclaimed \"very difficult man\",<ref>Wadler, Joyce. \"Artie Shaw, Without Music\".

Also an author, Shaw wrote both fiction and non-fiction.\n\nWidely regarded as \"one of jazz's finest clarinetists\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/artie-shaw-p7522/discography/compilations |title=Artie Shaw |website=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=March 31, 2012}}</ref> Shaw led one of the United States' most popular [[big bands]] in the late 1930s through the early 1940s. Though he had numerous hit records, he was perhaps best known for his 1938 recording of [[Cole Porter]]'s \"[[Begin the Beguine]]\". Before the release of \"Beguine\", Shaw and his fledgling band had languished in relative obscurity for over two years and, after its release, he became a major pop artist within short order. The record eventually became one of the era's defining recordings. Musically restless, Shaw was also an early proponent of what became known much later as ''[[Third Stream]]'' music, which blended elements of classical and jazz forms and traditions. His music influenced other musicians, such as [[Monty Norman]] in England, with the vamp of the [[James Bond Theme]], possibly influenced by 1938's \"Nightmare\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jazziz.com/short-history-nightmare-artie-shaw-1936/|title=A short history of\u2026 \u201cNightmare\u201d (Artie Shaw, 1936)|last=Micucci|first=Matt|date=2017-07-18|website=JAZZIZ Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-10}}</ref>\n\nShaw also recorded with small jazz groups drawn from within the ranks of the various [[big band]]s he led. He served in the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] from 1942 to 1944, (during which time he led a morale-building band that toured the South Pacific amidst the chaos of [[World War II]]) and, following his discharge in 1944, he returned to lead a band through 1945. Following the breakup of that band, he began to focus on other interests and gradually withdrew from the world of being a professional musician and major celebrity, although he remained a force in popular music and jazz before retiring from music completely in 1954.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Artie Shaw, King of the Clarinet: His Life and Times|last = Nolan|first = Tom|publisher = W.

Shaw bought a saxophone by working in a grocery store and began learning the saxophone at 13. At 16, he switched to the clarinet and left home to tour with a band.\n\n==Career==\nReturning to New York, he became a session musician through the early 1930s. From 1925\u201336, Shaw performed with many bands and orchestras; from 1926 to 1929, he worked in [[Cleveland]] and established a lasting reputation as music director and arranger for an orchestra led by the violinist Austin Wylie. In 1929 and 1930, he played with [[Irving Aaronson]]'s Commanders, where he was exposed to symphonic music, which he would later incorporate in his arrangements. In 1932, Shaw joined the [[Roger Wolfe Kahn]] Orchestra and made several recordings with the outfit including \"[[It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)]]\" and [[Fit as a Fiddle (song)|\"Fit as a Fiddle\"]].\n\n===Leader of bands===\nIn 1935, he first gained attention with his \"Interlude in B-flat\" at a swing concert at the [[Imperial Theatre (Broadway)|Imperial Theater]] in New York.<ref name=\"white\">White, John.

The Gramercy Five's biggest hit was \"Summit Ridge Drive\", one of Shaw's million-selling singles. His last prewar band, organized in September 1941, included Oran \"Hot Lips\" Page, Max Kaminsky, Georgie Auld, [[Dave Tough]], [[Jack Jenney]], [[Ray Conniff]] and Guarnieri.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/jazz/biography/artist_id_shaw_artie.htm|title=JAZZ A Film By Ken Burns: Selected Artist Biography \u2013 Artie Shaw|website=Pbs.org|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThroughout his career, Shaw had a habit of forming bands, developing them according to his immediate aspirations, making a quick series of records, and then disbanding. He generally did not stick around long enough to reap his bands' successes through live performances of their recorded hits. Following the breakup of what was already his second band in 1939, he rarely toured at all and, if he did, his personal appearances were usually limited to long-term engagements in a single venue or bookings that did not require much traveling, unlike many bands of the era that traveled great distances doing seemingly endless strings of one-night engagements. Apart from his interest in music, Shaw had a tremendous intellect and almost insatiable thirst for intellectual knowledge and literature. During his self-imposed \"sabbaticals\" from the music business, his interests included studying advanced mathematics, as cited in [[Karl Sabbagh]]'s ''The [[Riemann Hypothesis]]''.<ref name=\"Riemann\">Sabbagh, Karl. ''The Riemann Hypothesis: The Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics'', Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 2004; {{ISBN|0-374-52935-3}}</ref>\n\nThe long series of musical groups Shaw formed included [[Billie Holiday]], [[Lena Horne]], [[Helen Forrest]], [[Mel Torm\u00e9]], [[Buddy Rich]], [[Dave Tough]], [[Barney Kessel]], [[Jimmy Raney]], [[Tal Farlow]], [[Dodo Marmarosa]], and [[Ray Conniff]]. He used the morose \"Nightmare\", with its [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] nuances, as his theme rather than choosing a more accessible song. In a televised interview in the 1970s, Shaw derided the \"asinine\" songs of [[Tin Pan Alley]] that were the lifeblood of popular music and which bands, especially the most popular (such as his own) were compelled to play night after night. In 1994, he told Frank Prial (''[[The New York Times]]''), \"I thought that because I was Artie Shaw I could do what I wanted, but all they wanted was 'Begin the Beguine'\".<ref>Prial, Frank J. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DE5DD1F30F93BA2575BC0A962958260 \"At Home with: Artie Shaw; Literary Life, After Ending the Beguine\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 18, 1994.</ref>\n\n===Radio days===\n[[File:Artie Shaw Playing.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|right|Artie Shaw performs his \"[[Concerto for Clarinet (Shaw)|Concerto for Clarinet]]\" in 1940.]]\nShaw did many [[big band remote]] broadcasts. Throughout the autumn and winter of 1938, he was often heard from the Blue Room of the Hotel Lincoln in New York. After touring in 1939, he led the house band at the Cafe Rouge of the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York. He was the headliner of a radio series with comedian [[Robert Benchley]] as emcee.<ref name=\"white\"/> Shaw broadcast on CBS from November 20, 1938 until November 14, 1939. At the Cafe Rouge he quit his band that week and went to Mexico. The band continued without him into January but eventually broke up. After Shaw returned from Mexico in 1940, and still under contract to RCA Victor, he experimented with a group of session musicians in Hollywood, trying to combine strings and woodwinds with a jazz band. The result was the hit \"Frenesi\".\n\nHe was hired as bandleader for the ''Burns and Allen Show'' broadcast from Hollywood. He organized a band that was modeled after his swing band concept of the late 1930s with the addition of six violins, two violas, and one cello. The addition of a string section to a popular big band was not novel, as it had been done by [[Paul Whiteman]] and others since the 1920s. Shaw updated the idea with the music trends of the 1940s. Strings gave him a wider tonal palette and allowed him to concentrate on ballads rather than the fast dance songs of the swing era. Shaw was at or near the top of the list of virtuoso jazz bandleaders. The band was showcased on the Burns and Allen program every week.\n\nIn 1940, at the height of his popularity, the 30-year-old Shaw earned up to $60,000 per week.<ref name=\"white\"/> In contrast, [[George Burns]] and [[Gracie Allen]] were each making $5,000 per week during the year that Shaw and his orchestra provided the music for their radio show.<ref>\"Business & Finance: Nat & Googie\".

Shaw broke up the Hollywood band, keeping a nucleus of seven musicians in addition to himself, and filled out the ensemble with New York musicians until March 1941. While taking a few months vacation in the spring of 1941 to reassess what to do next, Shaw recorded in another small group format with three horns and a four-man rhythm section with the addition of a dozen strings and. By September, he formed a big band with seven brass, five saxes, four rhythm, and fifteen strings. Remote broadcasts noted the band performing in good form and Shaw dazzling the crowd with his clarinet. On December 7, three months into the tour, the 31-piece band was in the midst of a matinee performance in Providence, Rhode Island, when he was given a note about the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor. The note instructed him to tell military personnel to return to their bases. As the audience left, he knew the band was coming to an end.\n\n===War and after===\n[[File:Artie Shaw and the Rangers.jpg|thumb|Artie Shaw and The Rangers, 1943]]\nDuring World War II, Shaw enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] and shortly after formed a band, which served in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific theater]] (just as [[Glenn Miller]]'s wartime band served in the UK and Europe). After 18 months playing for Navy personnel, (sometimes as many as four concerts a day in battle zones, including [[Guadalcanal]]), Shaw returned to the U.S. in a state of physical exhaustion and received a medical discharge.<ref>Susman, Gary. \"Goodbye\", ''Entertainment Weekly''.

Gottlieb]]]]\n\nShaw credited his time in the Navy from 1942 to 1944 as a period of renewed introspection.<ref name=\"autobio\">{{Cite book|last=Shaw|first=Artie|title=The Trouble with Cinderella|year=1952|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Young|isbn=1-56474-020-X|url=https://archive.org/details/troublewithcinde00shaw}}</ref> After his discharge, he entered psychoanalysis and began to withdraw from music in favor of a writing career. His autobiography, ''The Trouble With Cinderella: An Outline of Identity'', was published in 1952 (with later reprint editions in 1992 and 2001). Revealing downbeat elements of the music business, Shaw explained that \"the trouble with Cinderella\" is \"nobody ever lives happily ever after.\"<ref name=\"autobio\"/> He turned to semi-autobiographical fiction with the three short novels in ''I Love You, I Hate You, Drop Dead!'' (1965, reprinted in 1997), which prompted [[Terry Southern]]'s comment: \"Here is a deeply probing examination of the American marital scene. I flipped over it!\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615221645/http://www.artieshaw.com/books-ily.html|title=Books by Artie Shaw- I Love You, I Hate You, Drop Dead!|date=June 15, 2008|website=Web.archive.org}}</ref> Shaw's short stories, including \"Snow White in Harlem\", were collected in ''The Best of Intentions and Other Stories'' (1989). He worked for years on his 1000-page autobiographical novel, ''The Education of Albie Snow'', but the three-volume work remained unpublished.\n\nAfter his discharge in 1944, he formed another band, this time what could be considered a modern big band in that it contained what is now considered the standard eight brass and five saxes. It did not include any strings and was based in Hollywood, California, where Shaw was living. He continued to record for RCA Victor, as he had before the war, and limited the band's personal appearances to military bases in California. In August 1945 his contract with RCA ended and he signed with an independent label, [[Musicraft]]. He made a few records for Musicraft before the band broke up, and all of the recordings for Musicraft from 1946 were staffed by top-notch session musicians. The big band was back in the studio, this time including strings. On these Musicraft recordings in 1946 Shaw featured the young singer Mel Torm\u00e9. On some of the sides, Torme was also featured with his vocal group the Meltones.\n\nIn July 1954, Shaw undertook a brief but historic Australian tour for promoter [[Lee Gordon (promoter)|Lee Gordon]] on which he shared the bill with drummer [[Buddy Rich]] and vocalist [[Ella Fitzgerald]]. After completing that tour Shaw stopped playing the clarinet, citing his own perfectionism, which, he later said, would have killed him. He explained to a reporter, \"In the world we live in, compulsive perfectionists finish last. You have to be [[Lawrence Welk]] or, on another level, [[Irving Berlin]], and write the same kind of music over and over again. I'm not able to do that, and I have taken the clarinet as far as anyone can possibly go. To continue playing would be a disservice.\"<ref>Freedland, Michael. \"'Jazz is like jumping off a cliff'\", ''The Telegraph'', March 15, 2001.</ref> He spent the rest of the 1950s living in Europe.\n\nIn 1983, after years of prodding by Williard Alexander, the 73-year-old Shaw organized a band and selected clarinetist [[Dick Johnson (clarinetist)|Dick Johnson]] as bandleader and soloist. The 58-year-old Johnson, an accomplished woodwind and saxophonist and native of Brockton, Massachusetts, was no stranger to jazz having recorded numerous albums of his own and had idolized Shaw's playing throughout his life. Shaw's music library, which was the product of his almost 20 years of activity in the music business, contained numerous arrangements of monumental status of popular music in addition to many original big band jazz compositions of the era. It was a collection of music arranged by some of the foremost composer/arrangers of the period, much of which was sketched out by Shaw himself and filled in and completed by his orchestrator/arranger collaborators, among them [[Jerry Gray]], [[William Grant Still]], [[Lennie Hayton]], Ray Conniff, [[Eddie Sauter]], and [[Jimmy Mundy]], to name a few. Shaw rehearsed his new band, (based out of Boston, Massachusetts), and the band made its official debut on New Year's Eve 1984 at the [[Glen Island Casino]] in [[New Rochelle]], New York, the same launching pad for many bands of the swing era decades earlier, when Shaw and his bands were in their prime. Shaw appeared with the band throughout its first few years, limiting his role to being its conductor and front man, while leaving the clarinet playing duties to Johnson. In 1985, another week-long series of strenuous rehearsals followed during which Shaw added more repertoire, including many arrangements and compositions that were from the later years of his career Shaw had never recorded. By 1987 though, Shaw was no longer touring with the band, quietly content that Johnson and the band kept true to Shaw's band spirit and vision. He would, however, show up on occasion \"just to hear how things sounded\".{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Films and television===\nShaw made several musical shorts in 1939 for [[Vitaphone]] and [[Paramount Pictures]]. He portrayed himself in the [[Fred Astaire]] film, ''[[Second Chorus]]'' (1940), which featured Shaw and his orchestra playing ''[[Concerto for Clarinet (Shaw)|Concerto for Clarinet]]'', and his 1940\u201341 Hollywood period ''Star Dust'' band can be heard throughout the soundtrack. The film garnered him two Oscar nominations for Best Score and Best Song (\"Love of My Life\").<ref>Wilson, Jeff. \"Artie Shaw, 94: Top bandleader of swing era\". ''Toronto Star''. December 30, 2004.</ref> He collaborated on the love song \"If It's You\", sung by [[Tony Martin (entertainer)|Tony Martin]] in the [[Marx Brothers]]' film ''[[The Big Store]]'' (1941). In 1950, he was a mystery guest on ''[[What's My Line?]]'' and on August 31, 1952, was part of the panel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0789600/|title=Artie Shaw|author=|date=|website=IMDb|accessdate=March 26, 2018}}</ref> During the 1970s he made appearances on ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' with [[Johnny Carson]].\n\nMany of his recordings have been used in motion pictures. His 1940 recording of \"[[Stardust (1927 song)|Stardust]]\" was used in its entirety in the closing credits of the film ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth (film)|The Man Who Fell to Earth]]''. [[Martin Scorsese]] also used the Shaw theme song, \"Nightmare\", in his [[Academy Award]]-winning [[Howard Hughes]] biopic, ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]].''\n\nCanadian filmmaker Brigitte Berman interviewed [[Hoagy Carmichael]], [[Doc Cheatham]], and others including Shaw for her documentary film, ''Bix: Ain't None of Them Play Like Him Yet'' (1981) about [[Bix Beiderbecke]], and afterward she went on to create an [[Academy Award]]-winning documentary, ''Artie Shaw: Time Is All You've Got'' (1985), featuring extensive interviews with Shaw, Buddy Rich, Mel Torm\u00e9, Helen Forrest, and other musicians, in addition to Shaw's eighth wife, actress [[Evelyn Keyes]]. The documentary ends with Shaw rehearsing his new band with co-leader Johnson present and rolls to credits perhaps quite fittingly with the band taking a final segue to Shaw's theme song ''Nightmare.'' In 2000, filmmaker [[Ken Burns]] interviewed Shaw at his home for his PBS documentary/miniseries ''[[Jazz (TV series)|Jazz]]'' where Shaw appears in multiple segments. His last major interview was in 2003, when he was interviewed by [[Russell Davies]] for the [[BBC]] Television documentary, ''Artie Shaw \u2013 Quest for Perfection''. The documentary includes interviews with surviving members of his original bands, Johnson, and other music industry professionals.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==Personal life==\nA self-proclaimed \"very difficult man\",<ref>Wadler, Joyce. \"Artie Shaw, Without Music\".

Two marriages were annulled; the others ended in divorce: Jane Cairns (1932\u201333; annulled); Margaret Allen (1934\u201337); actress [[Lana Turner]] (1940); Betty Kern, the daughter of songwriter [[Jerome Kern]] (1942\u201343); actress [[Ava Gardner]] (1945\u201346); ''[[Forever Amber (novel)|Forever Amber]]'' author [[Kathleen Winsor]] (1946\u201348; annulled); actress [[Doris Dowling]] (1952\u201356), and actress [[Evelyn Keyes]] (1957\u201385).<ref name=\"telobit\">\"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1480154/Artie-Shaw.html Artie Shaw]\", ''The Telegraph,'' January 1, 2005.</ref> He had two sons, Steven Kern (by Betty Kern) and Jonathan Shaw (by Doris Dowling).<ref name=\"telobit\"/> Both Lana Turner and Ava Gardner later described Shaw as being extremely emotionally abusive. His controlling nature and incessant verbal abuse drove Turner to have a nervous breakdown, soon after which she divorced him. In 1940, before eloping with [[Lana Turner]], Shaw briefly dated actress [[Judy Garland]]<ref name=Lana>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Lana|title=Lana: The Lady, The Legend, The Truth|year=1982|publisher=Dutton Adult; 1st edition|isbn=978-0525241065|pages=[https://archive.org/details/lanatheladylegen00turn/page/40 40\u201349]|url=https://archive.org/details/lanatheladylegen00turn/page/40}}</ref> and, according to Tom Nolan's biography, had an affair with [[Lena Horne]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn 1946, Shaw was present at a meeting of the Independent Citizens' Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions. [[Olivia de Havilland]] and [[Ronald Reagan]], part of a core group of actors and artists who were trying to sway the organization away from [[Communism]], presented an [[anti-Communist]] declaration which, if signed, was set to run in newspapers. There was bedlam as many rose to champion the communist cause, and Shaw began praising the democratic standards of the Soviet constitution.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115757993223555601|work=The Wall Street Journal|title=Olivia de Havilland Recalls Her Role &ndash; in the Cold War|first=John|last=Meroney|date=September 7, 2006}}</ref> In 1953, Shaw was forced to testify before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] for his [[collectivism|leftist]] activities. The committee was investigating a peace activist organization, the [[World Peace Council]], which it considered a Communist front.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nShaw was also a precision [[marksman]], ranking fourth in the United States in 1962,<ref name=\"white\"/> and an expert [[fly fisherman]]. In his later years, Shaw lived and wrote in the [[Newbury Park, California|Newbury Park]] section of [[Thousand Oaks, California]]. He died on December 30, 2004, aged 94. According to his publicist, he had been \"in ill health for some time, but I don't know the specific cause of death.\" In fact, Shaw had long been suffering from diabetes.<ref>\"Jazz giant Artie Shaw dies at age 94\". ''Associated Press''. December 31, 2004.</ref> In 2005, Shaw's eighth wife, [[Evelyn Keyes]], filed suit, claiming she was entitled to one-half of Shaw's estate, pursuant to a contract to make a will between them. In July 2006, a [[Ventura, California]], jury unanimously held that Keyes was entitled to almost one-half of Shaw's estate or $1,420,000.<ref>\"Artie Shaw's ex-wife gets half of estate\", ''USA Today''. July 25, 2006.</ref>\n\n==Awards and honors==\nIn 1980, Shaw donated his papers, most of which amounted to his music library of over 700 scores and parts and approximately 1,000 pieces of sheet music, to Boston University. In 1991, the collection was transferred to the School of Music of the [[University of Arizona]] in Tucson. In 2004, he received [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn 1938, ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazine readers voted Artie Shaw's the best swing band.<ref>{{cite web|title=1938 Down Beat Readers Poll|url=http://www.downbeat.com/default.asp?sect=stories&subsect=story_detail&sid=744| website=DownBeat.com|publisher=Maher Publications|accessdate=July 16, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021031170409/http://www.downbeat.com/default.asp?sect=stories&subsect=story_detail&sid=744|archivedate=October 31, 2002}}</ref>\n\nIn response to [[Benny Goodman]]'s nickname, the \"King of Swing\", Shaw's fans dubbed him the \"King of the Clarinet\".
