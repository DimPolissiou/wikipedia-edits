The term \"private\" refers to customer service rendered on a more personal basis than in mass-market [[retail banking]], usually via dedicated bank advisers. It does not refer to a [[private bank]], which is a non-incorporated banking institution.\n\nAt least until recently, it largely consisted of banking services (deposit taking and payments), [[Managed account|discretionary asset management]], brokerage, limited tax advisory services and some basic [[concierge]]-type services, offered by a single designated relationship manager.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe first private banks, the way we think of them today, were formed in Florence in the 14th century. It is commonly accepted that the first private Bank was established between 1348 and 1392 by Vieri di Cambio de\u2019 Medici of the Medici family of merchants.  Other family-owned private banks were established in Italy at that time, none of which still exists presently.  The oldest bank still in existence is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, headquartered in Siena, Italy (45 miles or 72 Km. away from Florence) which has been operating continuously since 1472 also in private banking.\n<ref>{{cite news| title =Private Banking History | publisher = Privatni Bankovnictvi| url =https://privatnibankovnictvi.eu/en/bank-guide/private-banking/history-private-banking/}}</ref>\n\nPrivate banks came to be known as \"private\" to stand out from the retail banking and [[savings bank]]s aimed at the new [[middle class]]. Traditionally, private banks were linked to families for several generations. They often advised and performed all financial and banking services for these families. Historically, private banking has developed in Europe (see the [[Private bank#List of private banks|List of private banks]]).

The assets of the [[Princely Family of Liechtenstein]] are managed by [[LGT Group]] (founded in 1920 and originally known as The Liechtenstein Global Trust).

An institution's private banking division provides services such as wealth management, savings, inheritance, and tax planning for their clients.

Some of the dimensions of value proposition of a private bank are parent brand, one-bank approach, unbiased advice, strong research and advisory team and unified platform.\nMany banks leverage the \u201cparent brand\u201d to gain a client\u2019s trust and confidence. These banks have a strong presence across the globe and present private bank offerings as a part of the parent group. \u201cOne Bank approach\u201d is where private banks offer an integrated proposition to meet clients personal and business needs. Since private banking concerns understanding a client\u2019s need and risk appetite, and tailoring the solution accordingly, few banks define their value proposition along this dimension. Most modern private banks follow an open product platform, and hence claim their advice is unbiased. They believe there is no incentive to push proprietary products, and the client gets the best of what they offer. A few banks claim to have a \u201cstrong advisory team\u201d that reflects in the products they offer the client. A couple of banks also define their value proposition on their unified platform, their ability to comply with all regulations, yet serve the client without restrictions.\n\n== Product platform ==\n'''[[Open architecture]]''' product platform is where a private bank distributes all the third party products and is not restricted to selling only its proprietary products. '''Closed architecture''' product platform is where the bank sells only its proprietary products and does not entertain any third party product. These days the needs of the clients are so diverse that it is practically impossible for a bank to cater to those needs by its proprietary products alone. Clients today demand the best of breed products and most banks have to follow an open architecture product platform where they distribute products of other banks to their clients in return for commission. Products offered to private banking clients include equities, fixed-income securities, structured products, foreign exchange, commodities, deposits and real-estate investments.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thebanks.eu/articles/private-banking|title=Private Banking|author=|date=|website=thebanks.eu|accessdate=30 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Fee structure ==\nDifferent banks charge their clients in different ways. There are banks that follow the transactional model where the client is not charged any advisory fee at all. The banks thrive totally on the commissions they get by distributing third party products. There are other private banks that follow a hybrid model. In this model, the bank charges a fixed fee for certain products and advisory fee for the rest. Some of the other banks are totally advisory driven  and charge the clients a percentage of AUM (e.g. 0.75% of entire AUM).\nA few banks offer both a transactional model and an advisory model. The clients choose what suits them. A recent industry trend is towards the advisory fee model, because margins on commissions may go down in the future.\n\n== Lead generation ==\n{{main|Lead generation}}\n'''Lead generation''' is a vital part of the private banking business. Various banks go about in different ways to acquire new clients. While some banks rely heavily on their wholesale banking referrals there are a few others that have strong tie-ups with their retail and corporate banking divisions. Most banks do have a revenue sharing mechanism in place within divisions. It is either a onetime charge to the division or an annuity that the division gets for a client referral. Many banks believe that the primary source of leads must be client referrals. A client would refer his/her friends when he/she is satisfied with the service provided by the private bank. Generating a good number of leads through client referrals shows the good health of the private bank.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Banks}}\n*[[Public bank]]\n*[[Family office]]\n*[[Multi-family office]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.swissworld.org/en/economy/swiss_financial_centre/a_mainstay_of_the_swiss_economy/ About Swiss Financial Centre] by Swissworld.org\n* [http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_37/b4194037934749.htm Businessweek: In the Battle of the Big Brokers, Merrill Is Winning]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Private Banking}}\n[[Category:Private banks| ]]\n[[Category:Banking]]\n[[Category:Distribution of wealth]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Banking services for very wealthy people}}{{Banking |terms}}\n'''Private banking''' is [[bank]]ing, [[investment]] and other [[financial services]] provided by banks and financial services firms primarily to [[high-net-worth individual]]s (HNWIs) with high levels of income or sizable assets and increasingly the Mass Affluent market as well. \n\nPrivate banking forms a more exclusive (for the especially affluent) subset of [[wealth management]].

Some of the dimensions of value proposition of a private bank are parent brand, one-bank approach, unbiased advice, strong research and advisory team and unified platform.\nMany banks leverage the \u201cparent brand\u201d to gain a client\u2019s trust and confidence. These banks have a strong presence across the globe and present private bank offerings as a part of the parent group. \u201cOne Bank approach\u201d is where private banks offer an integrated proposition to meet clients personal and business needs. Since private banking concerns understanding a client\u2019s need and risk appetite, and tailoring the solution accordingly, few banks define their value proposition along this dimension. Most modern private banks follow an open product platform, and hence claim their advice is unbiased. They believe there is no incentive to push proprietary products, and the client gets the best of what they offer. A few banks claim to have a \u201cstrong advisory team\u201d that reflects in the products they offer the client. A couple of banks also define their value proposition on their unified platform, their ability to comply with all regulations, yet serve the client without restrictions.\n\n== Product platform ==\n'''[[Open architecture]]''' product platform is where a private bank distributes all the third party products and is not restricted to selling only its proprietary products. '''Closed architecture''' product platform is where the bank sells only its proprietary products and does not entertain any third party product. These days the needs of the clients are so diverse that it is practically impossible for a bank to cater to those needs by its proprietary products alone. Clients today demand the best of breed products and most banks have to follow an open architecture product platform where they distribute products of other banks to their clients in return for commission. Products offered to private banking clients include equities, fixed-income securities, structured products, foreign exchange, commodities, deposits and real-estate investments.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thebanks.eu/articles/private-banking|title=Private Banking|author=|date=|website=thebanks.eu|accessdate=30 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Fee structure ==\nDifferent banks charge their clients in different ways. There are banks that follow the transactional model where the client is not charged any advisory fee at all. The banks thrive totally on the commissions they get by distributing third party products. There are other private banks that follow a hybrid model. In this model, the bank charges a fixed fee for certain products and advisory fee for the rest. Some of the other banks are totally advisory driven  and charge the clients a percentage of AUM (e.g. 0.75% of entire AUM).\nA few banks offer both a transactional model and an advisory model. The clients choose what suits them. A recent industry trend is towards the advisory fee model, because margins on commissions may go down in the future.\n\n== Lead generation ==\n{{main|Lead generation}}\n'''Lead generation''' is a vital part of the private banking business. Various banks go about in different ways to acquire new clients. While some banks rely heavily on their wholesale banking referrals there are a few others that have strong tie-ups with their retail and corporate banking divisions. Most banks do have a revenue sharing mechanism in place within divisions. It is either a onetime charge to the division or an annuity that the division gets for a client referral. Many banks believe that the primary source of leads must be client referrals. A client would refer his/her friends when he/she is satisfied with the service provided by the private bank. Generating a good number of leads through client referrals shows the good health of the private bank.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Banks}}\n*[[Public bank]]\n*[[Family office]]\n*[[Multi-family office]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.swissworld.org/en/economy/swiss_financial_centre/a_mainstay_of_the_swiss_economy/ About Swiss Financial Centre] by Swissworld.org\n* [http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_37/b4194037934749.htm Businessweek: In the Battle of the Big Brokers, Merrill Is Winning]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Private Banking}}\n[[Category:Private banks| ]]\n[[Category:Banking]]\n[[Category:Distribution of wealth]]\n", "name_user": "Philcroix91", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eOverview:add Private banks in Florence)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_banking"}

It is located in the southern portion known locally as \"[[Little Egypt (region)|Little Egypt]]\".\n\nThe western border of the county adjoins the [[Greater St. Louis]] consolidated metropolitan statistical area, the [[Metro-East]] region, and the St. Louis commuter region and market and viewing area.\n\n==History==\nThe first settler in Jefferson County is believed to have been Andrew Moore.  In 1810, he settled near the southeast corner of the county, near where the [[Goshen Road]] emerges from the forest of [[Hamilton County, Illinois|Hamilton County]] into what is now known as Moore's Prairie.  Moore arrived from the Goshen Settlement, near [[Edwardsville, Illinois|Edwardsville]].  His migration was therefore retrograde, from the west toward the interior of the State.\n\nIn 1814, Andrew Moore departed with his eight-year-old son for Jordan's settlement, a journey from which he never returned.  A skull that was believed to have been Moore's was found several years later about two miles from his cabin.  Jordan's Settlement, also called Jordan's Fort, was southeast of modern [[Thompsonville, Illinois|Thompsonville]], [[Illinois]], about twenty miles south of Moore's cabin.  This episode occurred during the [[War of 1812]] when many of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] tribes were allied with the British.\n\nIn 1816, Carter Wilkey, Daniel Crenshaw and Robert Cook settled in Moore's Prairie.  Daniel Crenshaw moved into Moore's cabin.  This settlement is believed to be the first permanent settlement in the County.\n\nJefferson County was organized in 1819, out of parts of [[White County, Illinois|White]], [[Edwards County, Illinois|Edwards]] and [[Franklin County, Illinois|Franklin Counties]].  It was named in honor of [[Thomas Jefferson]], principal draftsman of the [[Northwest Ordinance]], among other things.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

Opposition to the \u201c[[Yankee]]\u201d Republican Party and that party's [[American Civil War|Civil War]] meant that Jefferson County voted solidly Democratic until [[Theodore Roosevelt]] carried the county in his 1904 landslide. It was to again vote Republican in the greater landslides of 1920 and 1928, but otherwise was firmly Democratic until World War II.\n\nFollowing the New Deal, Jasper became something of a [[bellwether]] county, voting for every winning Presidential candidate between 1928 and 2004 except in the Catholicism-influenced 1960 election, and that of 1988 which was heavily influenced by [[1988\u201389 North American drought|a major Midwestern drought]].

It is located in the southern portion known locally as \"[[Little Egypt (region)|Little Egypt]]\".\n\nThe western border of the county adjoins the [[Greater St. Louis]] consolidated metropolitan statistical area, the [[Metro-East]] region, and the St. Louis commuter region and market and viewing area.\n\n==History==\nThe first settler in Jefferson County is believed to have been Andrew Moore.  In 1810, he settled near the southeast corner of the county, near where the [[Goshen Road]] emerges from the forest of [[Hamilton County, Illinois|Hamilton County]] into what is now known as Moore's Prairie.  Moore arrived from the Goshen Settlement, near [[Edwardsville, Illinois|Edwardsville]].  His migration was therefore retrograde, from the west toward the interior of the State.\n\nIn 1814, Andrew Moore departed with his eight-year-old son for Jordan's settlement, a journey from which he never returned.  A skull that was believed to have been Moore's was found several years later about two miles from his cabin.  Jordan's Settlement, also called Jordan's Fort, was southeast of modern [[Thompsonville, Illinois|Thompsonville]], [[Illinois]], about twenty miles south of Moore's cabin.  This episode occurred during the [[War of 1812]] when many of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] tribes were allied with the British.\n\nIn 1816, Carter Wilkey, Daniel Crenshaw and Robert Cook settled in Moore's Prairie.  Daniel Crenshaw moved into Moore's cabin.  This settlement is believed to be the first permanent settlement in the County.\n\nJefferson County was organized in 1819, out of parts of [[White County, Illinois|White]], [[Edwards County, Illinois|Edwards]] and [[Franklin County, Illinois|Franklin Counties]].  It was named in honor of [[Thomas Jefferson]], principal draftsman of the [[Northwest Ordinance]], among other things.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

Mountains and cliffs fill the background, and the sky is blue, filled with clouds.

''Minecraft'' was created by [[Markus \"Notch\" Persson]] in the [[Java programming language]] and was released as a [[public alpha]] for personal computers in 2009 before officially releasing in November 2011, with [[Jens Bergensten]] taking over development around then. It has since been ported to various platforms and is the [[bestselling video game of all time]], with over 180 million copies sold across all platforms and over 112 million monthly active players by 2019.\n\nIn ''Minecraft'', players explore a blocky, [[procedurally-generated]] [[3D computer graphics|3D]] world, and may discover and extract raw materials, [[Crafting (gaming)|craft]] tools, build structures or [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]], and depending on [[game mode]], can fight computer-controlled [[Mob (gaming)|\"mobs\"]], as well as either cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. These modes include a [[survival mode]], in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources. Players can [[Minecraft mods|modify the game]] to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.\n\n''Minecraft'' has been critically acclaimed, winning several awards and being cited of the most influential and [[greatest video games of all time]]. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual [[MineCon]] conventions played large roles in popularizing the game. It has also been used in educational environments, especially in the realm of computing systems, as virtual computers and hardware devices have been built in it. In 2014, Mojang and the ''Minecraft'' [[intellectual property]] were purchased by [[Microsoft]] for {{US$|2.5 billion}}. A number of spin-off games have also been produced, such as ''[[Minecraft: Story Mode]]'', ''[[Minecraft Dungeons]]'', and ''[[Minecraft Earth]]''.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Minecraft'' is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[sandbox game]] that has no specific goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game.<ref name=\"IGN review\">{{cite web |url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2011/11/24/minecraft-review |title=Minecraft Review&nbsp;\u2014 PC Review at IGN |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=18 December 2011 |first=Anthony |last=Gallegos |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106165908/http://uk.ign.com/articles/2011/11/24/minecraft-review |archivedate=6 November 2015 |date=23 November 2011}}</ref> However, there is an [[Achievement (video gaming)|achievement]] system,<ref>{{cite web |last=Meer |first=Alec |title=Minecraft:Wolves, Achievements, Mods, Merch |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/03/30/minecraft-mods/ |publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun, Ltd. |website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |date=30 March 2011 |accessdate=26 March 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402093516/http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/03/30/minecraft-mods/ |archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref> known as \"advancements\" in the ''Java Edition'' of the game.

Using ''Minecraft'', the community has helped reconstruct the areas of concern, and citizens are invited to enter the ''Minecraft'' servers and modify their own neighborhood.

The first pilot project began in [[Kibera]], one of [[Nairobi]]'s informal settlements, and is in the planning phase. The ''Block By Block'' project is based on an earlier initiative started in October 2011, ''Mina Kvarter'' (My Block), which gave young people in Swedish communities a tool to visualize how they wanted to change their part of town. According to Manneh, the project was a helpful way to visualize urban planning ideas without necessarily having a training in architecture.

''Minecraft'' was created by [[Markus \"Notch\" Persson]] in the [[Java programming language]] and was released as a [[public alpha]] for personal computers in 2009 before officially releasing in November 2011, with [[Jens Bergensten]] taking over development around then. It has since been ported to various platforms and is the [[bestselling video game of all time]], with over 180 million copies sold across all platforms and over 112 million monthly active players by 2019.\n\nIn ''Minecraft'', players explore a blocky, [[procedurally-generated]] [[3D computer graphics|3D]] world, and may discover and extract raw materials, [[Crafting (gaming)|craft]] tools, build structures or [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]], and depending on [[game mode]], can fight computer-controlled [[Mob (gaming)|\"mobs\"]], as well as either cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. These modes include a [[survival mode]], in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources. Players can [[Minecraft mods|modify the game]] to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.\n\n''Minecraft'' has been critically acclaimed, winning several awards and being cited of the most influential and [[greatest video games of all time]]. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual [[MineCon]] conventions played large roles in popularizing the game. It has also been used in educational environments, especially in the realm of computing systems, as virtual computers and hardware devices have been built in it. In 2014, Mojang and the ''Minecraft'' [[intellectual property]] were purchased by [[Microsoft]] for {{US$|2.5 billion}}. A number of spin-off games have also been produced, such as ''[[Minecraft: Story Mode]]'', ''[[Minecraft Dungeons]]'', and ''[[Minecraft Earth]]''.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Minecraft'' is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[sandbox game]] that has no specific goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game.<ref name=\"IGN review\">{{cite web |url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2011/11/24/minecraft-review |title=Minecraft Review&nbsp;\u2014 PC Review at IGN |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=18 December 2011 |first=Anthony |last=Gallegos |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106165908/http://uk.ign.com/articles/2011/11/24/minecraft-review |archivedate=6 November 2015 |date=23 November 2011}}</ref> However, there is an [[Achievement (video gaming)|achievement]] system,<ref>{{cite web |last=Meer |first=Alec |title=Minecraft:Wolves, Achievements, Mods, Merch |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/03/30/minecraft-mods/ |publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun, Ltd. |website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |date=30 March 2011 |accessdate=26 March 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402093516/http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/03/30/minecraft-mods/ |archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref> known as \"advancements\" in the ''Java Edition'' of the game.

The first pilot project began in [[Kibera]], one of [[Nairobi]]'s informal settlements, and is in the planning phase. The ''Block By Block'' project is based on an earlier initiative started in October 2011, ''Mina Kvarter'' (My Block), which gave young people in Swedish communities a tool to visualize how they wanted to change their part of town.

He proposed the abolition of extra allowances to large families, with the allowances proportional to the earnings of the father. He served in several official committees to promote eugenics.

He proposed the abolition of extra allowances to large families, with the allowances proportional to the earnings of the father. He served in several official committees to promote eugenics.
