Porkodi lives only for her brothers and would do anything for her brothers. Sindhu always hangs out with his friends and enjoys teasing the villagers. Tamizhselvi (Heera) is a hard-working and haughty plus two student who hates her cousin Sindhu. After successfully passing the exam, Sindhu and his friends decide to pursue a [[Bachelor of Science|bachelor's degree in science]] and apply to one of the colleges in the city.\n\nAt the college, his college mate Divya (Megha) fall in love with him, she is from a rich background.

Her sister wants her brother Santhosh to marry her cousin Thamizhselvi but Thamizhselvi refuses to marry him for not getting enough money and humiliates them. When Divya wanted to introduce her lover Sindhu to her parents, Sindhu stood them up for various reasons. The first time, he got an opportunity to sing in a concert, so Divya's parents were understanding. While the second time, it was the last of college, therefore, his friends and he celebrated and got drunk, Divya and her parents were disappointed that he did not come. Worried about Sindhu, Divya goes to his college dorm and she sees the drunk Sindhu talks ill about her. The next day, Sindhu realizes his mistake and apologizes to Divya. Divya, who sincerely loved him, tells him that he was too reckless and immature to be her life partner. Divya and her parents are about to move to the United States and before leaving, she tells Sindhu that he has missed an opportunity to make it big in life.\n\nThereafter, all his friends decide to pursue a [[Master of Science|master's degree in science]] while Sindhu has to clear all his arrears to complete his bachelor degree. Sindhu finds himself alone, isolated and mocked by the villagers. In the meantime, Thamizhselvi, who refused to marry grooms for not being rich enough, finally agrees to marry a doctor when she discovers that her mother (Rajini Nivetha) has [[cardiovascular disease]]. The day of the wedding, the groom demands a huge dowry but Thamizhselvi's mother tells them that she has not that much money and the wedding is cancelled.

Porkodi lives only for her brothers and would do anything for her brothers. Sindhu always hangs out with his friends and enjoys teasing the villagers. Tamizhselvi (Heera) is a hard-working and haughty plus two student who hates her cousin Sindhu.

Her sister wants her brother Santhosh to marry her cousin Thamizhselvi but Thamizhselvi refuses to marry him for not getting enough money and humiliates them. When Divya wanted to introduce her lover Sindhu to her parents, Sindhu stood them up for various reasons. The first time, he got an opportunity to sing in a concert, so Divya's parents were understanding. While the second time, it was the last of college, therefore, his friends and he celebrated and got drunk, Divya and her parents were disappointed that he did not come. Worried about Sindhu, Divya goes to his college dorm and she sees the drunk Sindhu talks ill about her. The next day, Sindhu realizes his mistake and apologizes to Divya. Divya, who sincerely loved him, tells him that he was too reckless and immature to be her life partner. Divya and her parents are about to leave the country to settle down to the [[United States|USA]] and before leaving, she tells Sindhu that he has missed an opportunity to make it big in life.\n\nThereafter, all his friends decide to pursue a [[Master of Science|master's degree in science]] while Sindhu has to clear all his arrears to complete his bachelor degree. Sindhu finds himself alone, isolated and mocked by the villagers. In the meantime, Thamizhselvi, who refused to marry grooms for not being rich enough, finally agrees to marry a doctor when she discovers that her mother (Rajini Nivetha) has [[cardiovascular disease]]. The day of the wedding, the groom demands a huge dowry but Thamizhselvi's mother tells them that she has not that much money and the wedding is cancelled.

The album reached #17 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was certified gold, both in the United States and Canada. The lead single, \"[[Help Me (Nick Carter song)|Help Me]]\" achieved considerable worldwide success while the other single, \"[[I Got You (Nick Carter song)|I Got You]]\" was a minor hit in Europe. He also launched a worldwide tour in support of the album. He was named ''[[Cosmogirl]]'' magazine's \"sexiest man in the world\" in 2002, beating out rival pop star [[Justin Timberlake]] for the title.\nNick began work on his second solo album in 2003, but the recordings were aborted when the [[Backstreet Boys]] returned to the studio. One of the tracks from the earlier recording sessions was used as the theme song to the television series ''[[House of Carters]]'' in 2006. \"Let It Go\" was written by Nick Carter, Matthew Gerrard, and Bridget Louise Benenate.\nCarter recorded a duet with [[pop singer]] [[Jennifer Paige]] called \"[[Beautiful Lie]]\" in 2009. In 2010, Nick Carter started recording new songs for his second solo album, working with Rami, Carl Falk, Toby Gad, Josh Hoge, Claude Kelly, and many others. The album, titled ''[[I'm Taking Off]]'', was released in Japan on February 2, 2011 in Japan, in Germany on June 3 and on the US [[iTunes Store]] on May 24.\n\n==Albums==\n\n===Studio albums===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Year\n!rowspan=2|Album details\n!colspan=9|Chart positions\n!rowspan=2 width=120|Certifications\n|-\n!width=30|<small>[[Billboard 200|US]]</small><br><ref name=usbillboard>\"[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=nick carter|chart=all}} US Billboard and CAN Chart history]\".

Tottenham Hotspur shrugged off a disappointing Champions League campaign to push Chelsea close for the title, though they ultimately missed out. However, they finished the season with statistically both the best attack and defence, with striker [[Harry Kane]] once again claiming the Golden Boot. Furthermore, the season marked the end of Tottenham's 118-year stay at the White Hart Lane stadium, temporarily using Wembley for the subsequent season, before a new stadium move.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sport.bt.com/football/premier-league-facts-2016-17-S11364181838117|title=Premier League facts 2016-17|last=|first=|date=21 May 2017|website=BT Sport|url-status=live|archive-url=|archivedate=|accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref> Manchester City finished one spot better than the previous season in [[Pep Guardiola]]'s first season in charge, though ended the season trophy-less, despite recording the third-best attack and reaching the semi-finals of the FA Cup. Liverpool made the Champions League for the first time in three years in [[J\u00fcrgen Klopp]]'s first full season, though they were prevented from finishing any higher than fourth by an inconsistent start to 2017, a consequence of both losing their \u00a335&nbsp;million signing [[Sadio Man\u00e9]] to international duty in January and February as well as suffering from several dropped points against bottom-half teams.\n\nDespite winning seven of their final eight games, Arsenal finished fifth and failed to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since 1997, as fan pressure on both manager [[Ars\u00e8ne Wenger]] and majority-shareholder [[Stan Kroenke]] grew. While they did win the FA Cup for the third time in four seasons, making Wenger the most successful manager in the competition's history, they endured yet another disappointing Champions League run, eliminated at the round of 16 for a seventh successive year. Manchester United finished sixth, one lower than the previous season, in [[Jos\u00e9 Mourinho]]'s first season in charge, with their failure to turn any one of their 15 draws \u2013 with 12 earned amidst the season-record 25 matches unbeaten run \u2013 into victories proving problematic. They did at least win the EFL Cup and won the [[2017 UEFA Europa League Final|Europa League final]]. The latter was the first Europa League title in their history, not only securing a place in the Champions League but also made them only the fifth club to [[UEFA club competition records and statistics#List of teams to have won the three main European club competitions|have won all three major European trophies]].\n\nIn only their second-ever top-flight season, AFC Bournemouth built on the success of the previous season as they secured a ninth-place finish and scored 55 goals, defying the critics who had tipped them to struggle from second-season syndrome. Much as Chelsea had the previous season, Leicester City made a poor defence of their title, despite having what turned out to be the best Champions League run of any English club this season. They were beaten by Hull City in the first match, the first time this has happened to a reigning Premier League champion. With the club struggling, manager [[Claudio Ranieri]] was sacked in February and replaced by coach [[Craig Shakespeare]], who steered the club to 12th. It broke the record of the lowest finish for Premier League title holders, previously set by Chelsea, but comfortably clear of relegation.\n\nSwansea City had looked dead and buried after early struggles under [[Francesco Guidolin]] and then a disastrous spell with [[Bob Bradley]] as manager, but were saved by a late improvement under [[Paul Clement (football manager)|Paul Clement]]'s management. Burnley fared the best of the promoted clubs, with only atrocious away form preventing them finishing higher as they made their home-ground of Turf Moor one of the hardest places to get a point from \u2013 and secured a second successive top-flight season for the first time in 40 years. Watford, in their first successive top-flight campaign for 30 years, successfully ensured a third consecutive Premier League season \u2013 however, as a result of poor away form, a disastrous end to the season and several spells of indifferent form throughout the campaign, the Hornets were unable to really build on the previous season despite recording their first league victories over Manchester United and at Arsenal since the 1980s.\n\nAfter several successive escapes from relegation, Sunderland's resilience finally broke and they dropped into the Championship after a decade, having spent virtually the entire season rooted to the bottom of the table. Middlesbrough also struggled through their first top-flight season in eight years, with a poor end to the season, the weakest goal-scoring record in the division and an inability to turn one of their 13 draws into victories dooming them. Hull City were the final relegated side, never quite recovering from a disastrous pre-season which saw manager [[Steve Bruce]] quit and next to no new players signed. Despite encouraging early season form under [[Mike Phelan]], a dismal run in the winter saw him sacked and replaced by [[Marco Silva]], who steered the club to a much better second half of the season, but it ultimately proved to be a case of too little, too late.\n\n==Teams==\nTwenty teams competed in the league&nbsp;\u2013 the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the [[2015\u201316 Football League Championship|Championship]]. The promoted teams were [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]]. Burnley and Hull City returned to the top flight after a season's absence while Middlesbrough returned after a seven-year absence. They replaced [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], ending their top flight spells of six, one and twenty-eight years respectively.\n\n===Stadiums and locations===\n{{location map+ |England |width=440 |float=right |caption=Locations of the 2016\u201317 Premier League teams |places=\n{{location map~ |England |lat=51.5155|long= -0.0922|label_size=80|label=London|mark=Blue pog.svg|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=50.735232 |long=-1.838287 |label_size=80|label=[[A.F.C.

Tottenham Hotspur shrugged off a disappointing Champions League campaign to push Chelsea close for the title, though they ultimately missed out. However, they finished the season with statistically both the best attack and defence, with striker [[Harry Kane]] once again claiming the Golden Boot. Furthermore, the season marked the end of Tottenham's 118-year stay at the White Hart Lane stadium, temporarily using Wembley for the subsequent season, before a new stadium move.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sport.bt.com/football/premier-league-facts-2016-17-S11364181838117|title=Premier League facts 2016-17|last=|first=|date=21 May 2017|website=BT Sport|url-status=live|archive-url=|archivedate=|accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref> Manchester City finished one spot better than the previous season in [[Pep Guardiola]]'s first season in charge, though ended the season trophy-less, despite recording the third-best attack and reaching the semi-finals of the FA Cup. Liverpool made the Champions League for the first time in three years in [[J\u00fcrgen Klopp]]'s first full season, though they were prevented from finishing any higher than fourth by an inconsistent start to 2017, a consequence of both losing their \u00a335&nbsp;million signing [[Sadio Man\u00e9]] to international duty in January and February as well as suffering from several dropped points against bottom-half teams.\n\nDespite winning seven of their final eight games, Arsenal finished fifth and failed to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since 1997, as fan pressure on both manager [[Ars\u00e8ne Wenger]] and majority-shareholder [[Stan Kroenke]] grew. While they did win the FA Cup for the third time in four seasons, making Wenger the most successful manager in the competition's history, they endured yet another disappointing Champions League run, eliminated at the round of 16 for a seventh successive year. Manchester United finished sixth, one lower than the previous season, in [[Jos\u00e9 Mourinho]]'s first season in charge, with their failure to turn any one of their 15 draws \u2013 with 12 earned amidst the season-record 25 matches unbeaten run \u2013 into victories proving problematic. They did at least win the EFL Cup and won the [[2017 UEFA Europa League Final|Europa League final]]. The latter was the first Europa League title in their history, not only securing a place in the Champions League but also made them only the fifth club to [[UEFA club competition records and statistics#List of teams to have won the three main European club competitions|have won all three major European trophies]].\n\nIn only their second-ever top-flight season, AFC Bournemouth built on the success of the previous season as they secured a ninth-place finish and scored 55 goals, defying the critics who had tipped them to struggle from second-season syndrome. Much as Chelsea had the previous season, Leicester City made a poor defence of their title, despite having what turned out to be the best Champions League run of any English club this season. They were beaten by Hull City in the first match, the first time this has happened to a reigning Premier League champion. With the club struggling, manager [[Claudio Ranieri]] was sacked in February and replaced by coach [[Craig Shakespeare]], who steered the club to 12th. It broke the record of the lowest finish for Premier League title holders, previously set by Chelsea, but comfortably clear of relegation.\n\nSwansea City had looked dead and buried after early struggles under [[Francesco Guidolin]] and then a disastrous spell with [[Bob Bradley]] as manager, but were saved by a late improvement under [[Paul Clement (football manager)|Paul Clement]]'s management. Burnley fared the best of the promoted clubs, with only atrocious away form preventing them finishing higher as they made their home-ground of Turf Moor one of the hardest places to get a point from \u2013 and secured a second successive top-flight season for the first time in 40 years. Watford, in their first successive top-flight campaign for 30 years, successfully ensured a third consecutive Premier League season \u2013 however, as a result of poor away form, a disastrous end to the season and several spells of indifferent form throughout the campaign, the Hornets were unable to really build on the previous season despite recording their first league victories over Manchester United and at Arsenal since the 1980s.\n\nAfter several successive escapes from relegation, Sunderland's resilience finally broke and they dropped into the Championship after a decade, having spent virtually the entire season rooted to the bottom of the table. Middlesbrough also struggled through their first top-flight season in eight years, with a poor end to the season, the weakest goal-scoring record in the division and an inability to turn one of their 13 draws into victories dooming them. Hull City were the final relegated side, never quite recovering from a disastrous pre-season which saw manager [[Steve Bruce]] quit and next to no new players signed. Despite encouraging early season form under [[Mike Phelan]], a dismal run in the winter saw him sacked and replaced by [[Marco Silva]], who steered the club to a much better second half of the season, but it ultimately proved to be a case of too little, too late.\n\n==Teams==\nTwenty teams competed in the league&nbsp;\u2013 the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the [[2015\u201316 Football League Championship|Championship]]. The promoted teams were [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]]. Burnley and Hull City returned to the top flight after a season's absence while Middlesbrough returned after a seven-year absence. They replaced [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], ending their top flight spells of six, one and twenty-eight years respectively.\n\n===Stadiums and locations===\n{{location map+ |England |width=440 |float=right |caption=Locations of the 2016\u201317 Premier League teams |places=\n{{location map~ |England |lat=51.5155|long= -0.0922|label_size=80|label=London|mark=Blue pog.svg|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=50.735232 |long=-1.838287 |label_size=80|label=[[A.F.C.

{"title_page": "Phyllis Wallbank", "text_new": "{{short description|British educationalist}}\n{{EngvarB|date=September 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2014}}\n[[File:Blason region fr Normandie.svg|thumb|right|190px| [[St Bartholomew the Great]] Priory Church's [[coat of arms]]]]\n\n'''Phyllis Wallbank''' <small>[[MBE]]</small> (1 September 1918 &ndash; 9 April 2020) was a British [[educationalist]] who, in 1948, founded the first all-age [[Montessori school]] in [[Great Britain]] and the [[Gatehouse School|Gatehouse Learning Centre]], which took its name from the [[gatehouse]] of the [[St Bartholomew the Great|Priory Church of St Bartholomew the Great]] in [[City of London|London]].\n\n== Life ==\nWallbank began as a [[Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel|Froebel]]-trained [[teacher]]. Working in juvenile courts as a children's officer in [[Buckinghamshire]], however, she realised that far fewer children would become delinquent if they could be educated to assume their own personal responsibilities and so take their rightful place in society. To do this, she trained under [[Maria Montessori]] and became a personal friend. In Montessori's later years, she served as her co-examiner for both the ordinary and the advanced courses. She served as Chairperson of the Montessori Association in England and as Vice-President of the International Montessori Association. She also organised the last International Montessori Congress, which met in London shortly before Montessori's death. William J. Codd, Professor of Education at [[Seattle University]], wrote of Wallbank: \"The one on whom the robe of Montessori should fall to carry on the living tradition.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nWallbank was married to the [[The Reverend|Revd]] [[Prebendary]] Newell Eddius Wallbank, a long-time [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of [[St Bartholomew-the-Great|St Bartholomew the Great]] in [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]],<ref>[http://www.raheresgarden.com/priors-rectors.html]{{dead link|date=December 2019}}</ref> and a noted musician and scholar of the [[pipe organ]]. It was in the priory church's gatehouse that Wallbank began the [[Gatehouse School]], becoming the Gatehouse Learning Centre, later expanding to [[Great Missenden]].\n\nThrough the educational philosophy of Montessori, Wallbank was drawn to the [[Catholic Church]]: she felt that Montessori's method naturally demanded the Catholic understanding of the [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Eucharist]]. She became a Catholic but was advised by her spiritual director to remain \"underground\" so as not to embarrass her husband.\n\nAfter retirement, Wallbank and her husband moved out of London to [[Dorney]] near [[Eton, Berkshire|Eton]], where they had a little house on the Common.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dorneycourt.co.uk/about/the-estate/dorney-common/|title=Dorney Common|website=Welcome to Dorney Court}}</ref> Both were involved in different ways with [[Eton College]], with her husband conducting services for BBC broadcasts and she coaching the weaker students and introducing them to her Slough Run.\n\nShortly before the death of her husband, Canon Timothy Russ<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/article/3rd-august-2013/38/obituary|title=Obit}}</ref> introduced Wallbank to the writings of the Canadian philosopher and theologian [[Bernard Lonergan|Fr Bernard Lonergan <small>SJ CC</small>]]. She found in Lonergan a [[philosophy]] that was deeply consonant with Montessori's educational practice and convictions. She was subsequently invited to lecture at the annual Lonergan Workshop at [[Boston College]]; some of her lectures have been published in the proceedings of the workshop.\n\nThe Phyllis Wallbank Educational Trust was founded to continue her educational thinking and expertise.<ref>[http://www.pwet.org.uk pwet.org.uk]{{dead link|date=December 2019}}</ref>\n\nWallbank remains retired in [[Dorney]], where she continues to be active, entertaining international [[scholar]]s at her home and communicating with a wide variety of people after having embraced the internet.\n\n== Educational activities ==\nThe [[Gatehouse School|Gatehouse Learning Centre]] was \"known for its distinguished graduates as well as its integration of exceptional students into the regular classroom.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Wallbank has lectured at a wide variety of colleges and conferences as well as university courses and lectures under various titles. In particular, she designed the distance learning course of the College of Modern Montessori. In retirement in Dorney, she was called upon by [[Eton College]] as a visiting teacher. In 2007 and 2008, in her late eighties, she went on Montessori World Tours giving lectures on [[Montessori education]].\n\n== Charitable and social activities ==\nBesides her innovations in the field of [[education]], Phyllis Wallbank has also been involved in creative charitable and social initiatives.

Working in juvenile courts as a children's officer in [[Buckinghamshire]], however, she realised that far fewer children would become delinquent if they could be educated to assume their own personal responsibilities and so take their rightful place in society. To do this, she trained under [[Maria Montessori]] and became a personal friend. In Montessori's later years, she served as her co-examiner for both the ordinary and the advanced courses. She served as Chairperson of the Montessori Association in England and as Vice-President of the International Montessori Association. She also organised the last International Montessori Congress, which met in London shortly before Montessori's death. William J. Codd, Professor of Education at [[Seattle University]], wrote of Wallbank: \"The one on whom the robe of Montessori should fall to carry on the living tradition.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nWallbank was married to the [[The Reverend|Revd]] [[Prebendary]] Newell Eddius Wallbank, a long-time [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of [[St Bartholomew-the-Great|St Bartholomew the Great]] in [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]],<ref>[http://www.raheresgarden.com/priors-rectors.html]{{dead link|date=December 2019}}</ref> and a noted musician and scholar of the [[pipe organ]]. It was in the priory church's gatehouse that Wallbank began the [[Gatehouse School]], becoming the Gatehouse Learning Centre, later expanding to [[Great Missenden]].\n\nThrough the educational philosophy of Montessori, Wallbank was drawn to the [[Catholic Church]]: she felt that Montessori's method naturally demanded the Catholic understanding of the [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Eucharist]]. She became a Catholic but was advised by her spiritual director to remain \"underground\" so as not to embarrass her husband.\n\nAfter retirement, Wallbank and her husband moved out of London to [[Dorney]] near [[Eton, Berkshire|Eton]], where they had a little house on the Common.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dorneycourt.co.uk/about/the-estate/dorney-common/|title=Dorney Common|website=Welcome to Dorney Court}}</ref> Both were involved in different ways with [[Eton College]], with her husband conducting services for BBC broadcasts and she coaching the weaker students and introducing them to her Slough Run.\n\nShortly before the death of her husband, Canon Timothy Russ<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/article/3rd-august-2013/38/obituary|title=Obit}}</ref> introduced Wallbank to the writings of the Canadian philosopher and theologian [[Bernard Lonergan|Fr Bernard Lonergan <small>SJ CC</small>]]. She found in Lonergan a [[philosophy]] that was deeply consonant with Montessori's educational practice and convictions. She was subsequently invited to lecture at the annual Lonergan Workshop at [[Boston College]]; some of her lectures have been published in the proceedings of the workshop.\n\nThe Phyllis Wallbank Educational Trust was founded to continue her educational thinking and expertise.<ref>[http://www.pwet.org.uk pwet.org.uk]{{dead link|date=December 2019}}</ref>\n\nWallbank remains retired in [[Dorney]], where she continues to be active, entertaining international [[scholar]]s at her home and communicating with a wide variety of people after having embraced the internet.\n\n== Educational activities ==\nThe [[Gatehouse School|Gatehouse Learning Centre]] was \"known for its distinguished graduates as well as its integration of exceptional students into the regular classroom.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Wallbank has lectured at a wide variety of colleges and conferences as well as university courses and lectures under various titles. In particular, she designed the distance learning course of the College of Modern Montessori. In retirement in Dorney, she was called upon by [[Eton College]] as a visiting teacher. In 2007 and 2008, in her late eighties, she went on Montessori World Tours giving lectures on [[Montessori education]].\n\n== Charitable and social activities ==\nBesides her innovations in the field of [[education]], Phyllis Wallbank has also been involved in creative charitable and social initiatives. In 1985 she began the London Run, a new ministry dedicated to helping homeless and destitute people living by the [[Thames Embankment]]. Some years later, she also began the Slough Run.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.justgiving.com:80/londonandsloughrun|title=The London and Slough Run|website=JustGiving}}</ref> Her London and Slough Runs continue to function, with people of all persuasions and faiths gathering together spontaneously on Mondays evenings on a street corner in [[Slough]], and offering food and drink with dignity to street people.

Magazines focusing specifically on voice acting are published in Japan, with ''[[Voice Animage]]'' being the longest running.\n\nThe term '''character voice''' (abbreviated '''CV'''), has been commonly used since the 1980s by such Japanese anime magazines as ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Animec|ja|3=\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30c3\u30af}}'' and ''[[Newtype]]'' to describe a voice actor associated with a particular anime or game character.\n\n==Actors and seiy\u016b==\nInitially, dubbing and voice-overs was a performance of actors who used only their voice and were called {{nihongo|\"voice actors\"|\u58f0\u306e\u4ff3\u512a|koe no haiy\u016b}}. For convenience, the term was shortened to a new compound consisting of the first and last [[kanji]] to make {{nihongo|seiy\u016b|\u58f0\u512a}}.\n\nIt was only after the voice acting booms, however, that the word became widespread. Elderly voice actors resent being called ''seiy\u016b'' because during their time, the term had a different (and minimizing) connotation. [[Chikao Ohtsuka]], who dubbed [[Charles Bronson]], was quoted in a special issue of ''Animage'' as saying, \"We are actors. Even if a performance only requires the use of our voice, we still remain actors, and it is therefore incorrect to refer to us as just voice actors, isn't and voice actors, even in the face of emerging voice actors like [[Genz\u014d Wakayama]], who learned how to act using their voice and never set foot in a theater.\n\nThere are three main factors that set voice actors and actors apart. \n* Their professional upbringing by the {{nihongo|Tokyo Broadcasting Drama Troupe|\u6771\u4eac\u653e\u9001\u5287\u56e3|T\u014dky\u014d H\u014ds\u014d Gekidan}}, formed by [[NHK]] and other private networks during the golden age of radio dramas.\n* The lack of Japan-made movies and dramas forced TV networks to air foreign shows, which raised demand for voice actors.\n* The boom in the anime world market, which produced a wave of young talents who wanted to become voice actors, rather than actors.\n\n==History==\nVoice acting has existed in Japan since the advent of radio. It was only in the 1970s that the term seiy\u016b entered popular usage because of the anime ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]''. According to a newspaper interview with a voice talent manager, \"Since the Yamato boom, the word 'seiy\u016b' has become instantly recognised; before that, actors and actresses who introduced themselves as seiy\u016b were often asked, 'You mean you work for [[Seiyu Group|Seiyu supermarket]]?'\"<ref name=\"Daily-Yomiuri\"/>\n\n===Radio drama era===\nIn 1925, the Tokyo Broadcasting Company (predecessor to the [[NHK]], Japan's public broadcasting system) started radio broadcasts. In that same year, twelve students who were specialising in voice-only performances became the first voice actors in Japan when a performance of a radio drama was broadcast. They referred to themselves as \"seiy\u016b\", but in those days the term {{nihongo|\"radio actor\"|\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u5f79\u8005|radio yakusha}} was used by newspapers to refer to the profession.\n\nIn 1941, NHK opened a training program to the public to prepare actors to specialise in radio dramas.This was called the {{nihongo|\"Tokyo Central Broadcasting Channel Actor Training Agency\"|\u6771\u4eac\u4e2d\u592e\u653e\u9001\u5c40\u5c02\u5c5e\u5287\u56e3\u4ff3\u512a\u990a\u6210\u6240|T\u014dky\u014d Ch\u016b\u014d H\u014ds\u014d Kyoku Senzoku Gekidan Haiy\u016b Y\u014dsei Sho}}. Then in 1942, the Tokyo Broadcasting Drama Troupe debuted its first performance. This was the second time that the term \"seiy\u016b\" was used to refer to voice actors.\n\nThere are several theories as to how the term \"seiy\u016b\" was coined. One theory is that Oyhashi Tokusaburo, a reporter for the Yomiuri Newspaper, coined the term. Another theory is that Tatsu Ooka, an entertainment programming managing producer for the NHK, came up with it.\n\nAt first, voice actors, like those at the Tokyo Radio Drama Troupe and similar companies specialised in radio dramas; with the advent of television, the term took on the additional meaning of one who does dubbing for animation. Television broadcasting aside, when radio was the leading mass medium, actors who played in radio dramas were not without their fans; for example, actors in the Nagoya Radio Drama troupe who played the lead love interest roles often received many fan letters.\n\n===1960s===\nIn 1961, during the early days of commercial television broadcasting, the [[Five-Company Agreement]] (Gosha Agreement) caused the supply of Japanese movies that were available to Japanese television stations to dry up. As a result, in the 1960s many foreign dramas and other foreign programming was imported and dubbed into Japanese language for television broadcast.\n\nAt first, the NHK subtitled most foreign shows; however, shows dubbed in the Japanese language soon became the standard. At the centre of the first voice acting boom were actors like [[Nachi Nozawa]], who dubbed the same foreign actors, in Nozawa's case [[Alain Delon]], [[Robert Redford]], and [[Giuliano Gemma]]. Because of problems with pay guarantees arising from the Gosha Agreement, cinema actors were prevented from dubbing foreign movies for television. Television actors were also prevented from dubbing because of a similar agreement. This caused studios to turn to actors from the radio age and actors from the ''Shingeki'' style of acting. Around this time dubbing of foreign animation was done by [[Rakugo]] story tellers, [[Asakusa]] comedians, and the like, and voice actors were called \"dubbing talents\" if they specialised in dubbing, while those giving voice to a character went under the name of \"''ateshi''\". It is during this golden age for dubbing that the [[Tokyo Actor's Consumer's Cooperative Society]] was founded. Later, Haikyo voice acting managers left and opened their own management agencies. Voice actors in Japan also voiced anime.\n\nThe first dubbed media broadcast in Japan was a film of the American animated film series ''[[Superman (1940s animated film series)|Superman]]'', on October 9, 1955, on KRT (today [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]]), and the first non-animated dubbed show broadcast was ''Cowboy G-Men'', again by KRT, in 1956. Both were dubbed live; the first show to be broadcast with pre-recorded dubbing was {{nihongo|''[[The Adventures of Television Boy]]''|\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u574a\u3084\u306e\u5192\u967a|Terebi B\u014dya no B\u014dken}} on April 8, 1956.\n\n===1970s===\nDuring the late 1970s, [[Akio Nojima]], [[Kazuyuki Sogabe]], [[Akira Kamiya]], [[T\u014dru Furuya]] and [[Toshio Furukawa]] were the first to unite into a band, [[:ja:\u30b9\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af (\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9)|Slapstick]], and perform live. Many other voice actors released their own albums. At around 1979 the first anime magazines began to be published. The then editor-in-chief of [[Animage]], [[Hideo Ogata]], was the first to publish editorials on the ongoing transformation of voice actors into [[Japanese idol|idols]]. Following his lead, the other magazines created \"seiy\u016b corners\" with information and gossip about voice actors; this was one of the main causes of young anime fans yearning to become voice actors. This led to a sudden increase in the number of students in voice acting schools. For the first time, anime voice actors were young people who grew up dreaming to become that, as opposed to being members of drama troupes or theatre actors who performed as a hobby. This boom lasted until the first half of the 1980s.\n\n===1980s===\nIn 1989, the voice actors of the five main stars of the animated television show ''[[Ronin Warriors]]'' ([[Nozomu Sasaki]], [[Takeshi Kusao]], [[Hiroshi Takemura]], [[Tomohiro Nishimura]] and [[Daiki Nakamura]]) formed an all-male singing group called \"NG5\". The group was featured as the subject of a special documentary program on [[Mainichi Broadcasting System|MBS]].\n\nDuring this period, voice acting production companies also began to provide specialised courses at on-site training schools specifically for training in animation dubbing.\n\n===1990s===\n[[File:Maria Yamamoto Fanime 2005 Meet the Guests reception.jpg|thumb|Voice actress [[Maria Yamamoto]] in 2005]] \nThe 1960s and 1970s booms were centered on media, such as the TV. In the 1990s, a new boom centred on more personal ways of communication, such as radio shows, [[Original Video Animation]], television quizzes, public events and the Internet, gave way to the publication of the first dedicated voice acting magazines, {{Interlanguage link multi|Seiy\u016b Grand Prix|ja|3=\u58f0\u512a\u30b0\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea}} and [[Voice Animage]]. Voice actors acquired many new fans thanks to the radio, and their CD sale figures increased. Concerts began to be held in the bigger halls. While the second boom also saw the voice actors become DJs, this time the recording houses backed the voice actor radio shows as sponsors, and large sums of money began to circulate. [[Megumi Hayashibara]], [[Hekiru Shiina]] and [[Mariko Kouda]] are the first examples of this new trend. Recording companies and voice acting schools began to devise new ways to raise young voice actors.\n\nWhen voice acting was introduced in television games, the same voice actors would perform in a series of events related to the television game world, making appearances and participating in radio programs based on the television games to attract the fanbase.\n\nIn the second half of the 1990s, the boom in the animation world led to the increase of anime shown in the Tokyo area. With the Internet, gathering information on their favourite voice actors became easy for fans, and voice actors began to appear in Internet-based radio shows.\n\nFrom {{start date|1994}} to {{end date|2000}}, the world's first digital [[satellite radio]] broadcaster, [[St.GIGA]], transmitted [[episodic video game]]s with voice acted overdubs in a separate and continually streaming vocal track (a technique called [[SoundLink]]), to be played in Japan on [[Nintendo]]'s [[Super Famicom]] video game console with its [[Satellaview]] peripheral.<ref>''[http://srad.jp/story/03/09/30/002224/ \u3055\u3088\u306a\u3089\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8\u30fb\u30ae\u30ac]''.

In Japan, the lines are usually performed before the anime has completed. The artist then draws in every expression to the key of the voice actors reading it off. This is the most common{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} way of prerecording in Japan. Young voice actors are used in both the anime and [[original video animation|OVAs]]. However, in fan-oriented productions and products they use voice actors because voice actors are often used as a selling point.\n\n====Dubbing into Japanese====\nIn the case of foreign dramas, movies, animations, news and documentaries, the localization voice-over requires more exact timing in relation to what appears on the screen. In order to perform voice-overs, the volume of the original language voice track is lowered, leaving only a faint sound remaining or, in some cases, no sound at all except for the music-and-effects tracks. Voice-over work is primarily performed for news and original foreign dramas. Auditions are held in order to determine who will take on the roles.\n\n====Video games====\n{{Main|Voice acting in video games}}\nUnlike in anime or dubbing roles, in a [[video game]] the voice tracks are often recorded separately due to the way individual voice tracks are selected and played depending on a player's progress. Typically a voice actor uses a script with only a single part's lines and matches it to the timing of the recording. Because of this, many collaborating voice actors in a production may never see each other in person. Popularity rankings may play a role in video game casting, but it is also possible to negotiate fees when a client requests a particular cast.\n\n===Radio drama or CD drama===\nWith a [[radio drama]] or CD drama there is more freedom given in voicing because there is no need to match a dub to the original actors, or to match an animated character. Because of this a voice actor's particular interpretation of an act or acting ability are considered. If the drama is based on an anime or [[manga]] then the voice actor from the anime are used. However, original drama or works based on literature rarely employ typical voice actors or younger voice actors. Auditions are rarely employed, and the cast is directly selected by the production staff.\n\n===Puppet and kigurumi shows===\nIn [[puppet show]]s, the voice actor must time the voice-over in relation to the puppet movements. While timing is of the essence in ''[[Costumed character#In Japan|kigurumi]]'' shows as well, in this case the voice actor's voice acting is recorded beforehand, and it is left to the ''kigurumi'' entertainer to move and act based on the spoken lines.\n\n===Narration===\nVoice actors are also commonly employed as [[narrator]]s in radio and television commercials, radio and television programs, [[press release]] videos and other kinds of media that require the voice actor to read text that clarifies what the program is about from a script. Even though the narration role falls within a voice actor's area of expertise, it is not uncommon for regular actors, young talents or [[announcer]]s to be chosen instead.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Matsuda |first1=Saki |title=\u58f0\u512a\u767d\u66f8 |date=2000 |publisher=Okura Publication |isbn=978-4872785647 |pages=121\u2013122 |language=ja|trans-title=Voice Actor White Paper}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=\u306a\u308a\u305f\u3044!!\u58f0\u512a |date=1998 |publisher=Daiei Publishing Co., Ltd. |isbn=978-4812513019 |language=ja|editor=Daiei Publishing Co., Ltd.}}</ref> The fee is proportional to the popularity of the person employed, and veterans are usually preferred for this role due to the high acting ability it requires; narration is a lot more expensive than any other voice acting because of this.<ref>{{cite book |title=\u306a\u308a\u305f\u3044!!\u58f0\u512a |date=1998 |publisher=Daiei Publishing Co., Ltd. |isbn=978-4812513019 |language=ja|editor=Daiei Publishing Co., Ltd.|page=152}}</ref> Candidates are required to send a short sample recording as a demonstration, and these samples play a large part in the selection process.\n\n===Theatre acting===\nIt is not uncommon for ''[[Shingeki]]'' actors and actors performing in small theatres to take a voice acting course in specialized schools and become voice actors, considering the small difference between actor and voice actor. Those who successfully become voice actors sometimes take stage acting roles of their own choosing, and the voice actor's agency takes no part unless the theatre management requires it.\n\n===Singing===\nSome voice actors branch into music, releasing albums, holding their concert in their own name and becoming full-time singers.\n\nHowever, it has become common for voice actors to sing the opening or closing themes of shows in which their character stars, or participate in non-animated side projects such as audio dramas (involving the same characters in new storylines) or image songs (songs sung in character that are not included in the anime but further develop the character), releasing CDs in the character's name rather than their own. Sometimes the singing style of an anime character is quite different from that of the voice actor, and tracks sung using the style of the character are often included in CDs the voice actors release in their own name. This made singing a central activity for many voice actors, especially those who do voice-overs for anime characters.\n\nThe limitations imposed on singer voice actors by their recording companies are also less strict than the ones imposed on regular singers. This allows voice actors to release CDs in their character's name with different companies.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\n===Radio personality===\nRadio talk shows are also called ''aniradio''. Initially the vast majority was aired by local broadcast stations only, but after the communication boom of the 1990s the metropolitan radio stations began to also employ them. Some such programs aired for over ten years. This was the result of fans who regard radio talks as a way to get to know the voice actors as human beings rather than just voices for the characters they play.\n\nDue to lower costs and the increase in the number of listeners, more and more of these radio talks are hosted on the [[Internet]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Seiyu Awards]]\n* [[Voice acting]]\n* [[Voice foley]]\n* [[:Category:Japanese voice actor management companies|Japanese voice actor management companies]]\n* [[List of Japanese voice actors of foreign descent]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.usagi.org/~doi/seiyuu/ Seiy\u016b (voice actor) database]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060411201835/http://sdb.noppo.com/ Miracle voice actors and magical voice actresses] Voice actor database {{in lang|ja}}\n*[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php Anime News Network Encyclopedia] Database of anime staff and cast members.\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Voice Acting In Japan}}\n[[Category:Japanese voice actors| ]]\n[[Category:Voice acting|Japan]]\n\n[[fi:\u00c4\u00e4nin\u00e4yttelij\u00e4#Japanissa]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Seiyu}}\n{{short description|Occupation in Japan}}\n{{Expand Japanese|\u58f0\u512a|date=December 2009}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{More footnotes|date=October 2009}}\n{{original research|date=April 2010}}\n}}\n{{Anime and manga}}\n<!-- Note to editors: Do not remove any of these until the points have been properly and utterly addressed and corrected.-->\n'''Voice acting in Japan''' (seiy\u016b) is acting as a [[narrator]] or as an actor in [[radio play]]s or as a [[character actor]] in [[anime]] and [[video game]]s.

Magazines focusing specifically on voice acting are published in Japan, with ''[[Voice Animage]]'' being the longest running.\n\nThe term '''character voice''' (abbreviated '''CV'''), has been commonly used since the 1980s by such Japanese anime magazines as ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Animec|ja|3=\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30c3\u30af}}'' and ''[[Newtype]]'' to describe a voice actor associated with a particular anime or game character.\n\n==Actors and seiy\u016b==\nInitially, dubbing and voice-overs was a performance of actors who used only their voice and were called {{nihongo|\"voice actors\"|\u58f0\u306e\u4ff3\u512a|koe no haiy\u016b}}. For convenience, the term was shortened to a new compound consisting of the first and last [[kanji]] to make {{nihongo|seiy\u016b|\u58f0\u512a}}.\n\nIt was only after the voice acting booms, however, that the word became widespread. Elderly voice actors resent being called ''seiy\u016b'' because during their time, the term had a different (and minimizing) connotation. [[Chikao Ohtsuka]], who dubbed [[Charles Bronson]], was quoted in a special issue of ''Animage'' as saying, \"We are actors. Even if a performance only requires the use of our voice, we still remain actors, and it is therefore incorrect to refer to us as just voice actors, isn't and voice actors, even in the face of emerging voice actors like [[Genz\u014d Wakayama]], who learned how to act using their voice and never set foot in a theater.\n\nThere are three main factors that set voice actors and actors apart. \n* Their professional upbringing by the {{nihongo|Tokyo Broadcasting Drama Troupe|\u6771\u4eac\u653e\u9001\u5287\u56e3|T\u014dky\u014d H\u014ds\u014d Gekidan}}, formed by [[NHK]] and other private networks during the golden age of radio dramas.\n* The lack of Japan-made movies and dramas forced TV networks to air foreign shows, which raised demand for voice actors.\n* The boom in the anime world market, which produced a wave of young talents who wanted to become voice actors, rather than actors.\n\n==History==\nVoice acting has existed in Japan since the advent of radio. It was only in the 1970s that the term seiy\u016b entered popular usage because of the anime ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]''. According to a newspaper interview with a voice talent manager, \"Since the Yamato boom, the word 'seiy\u016b' has become instantly recognised; before that, actors and actresses who introduced themselves as seiy\u016b were often asked, 'You mean you work for [[Seiyu Group|Seiyu supermarket]]?'\"<ref name=\"Daily-Yomiuri\"/>\n\n===Radio drama era===\nIn 1925, the Tokyo Broadcasting Company (predecessor to the [[NHK]], Japan's public broadcasting system) started radio broadcasts. In that same year, twelve students who were specialising in voice-only performances became the first voice actors in Japan when a performance of a radio drama was broadcast. They referred to themselves as \"seiy\u016b\", but in those days the term {{nihongo|\"radio actor\"|\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u5f79\u8005|radio yakusha}} was used by newspapers to refer to the profession.\n\nIn 1941, NHK opened a training program to the public to prepare actors to specialise in radio dramas.This was called the {{nihongo|\"Tokyo Central Broadcasting Channel Actor Training Agency\"|\u6771\u4eac\u4e2d\u592e\u653e\u9001\u5c40\u5c02\u5c5e\u5287\u56e3\u4ff3\u512a\u990a\u6210\u6240|T\u014dky\u014d Ch\u016b\u014d H\u014ds\u014d Kyoku Senzoku Gekidan Haiy\u016b Y\u014dsei Sho}}. Then in 1942, the Tokyo Broadcasting Drama Troupe debuted its first performance. This was the second time that the term \"seiy\u016b\" was used to refer to voice actors.\n\nThere are several theories as to how the term \"seiy\u016b\" was coined. One theory is that Oyhashi Tokusaburo, a reporter for the Yomiuri Newspaper, coined the term. Another theory is that Tatsu Ooka, an entertainment programming managing producer for the NHK, came up with it.\n\nAt first, voice actors, like those at the Tokyo Radio Drama Troupe and similar companies specialised in radio dramas; with the advent of television, the term took on the additional meaning of one who does dubbing for animation. Television broadcasting aside, when radio was the leading mass medium, actors who played in radio dramas were not without their fans; for example, actors in the Nagoya Radio Drama troupe who played the lead love interest roles often received many fan letters.\n\n===1960s===\nIn 1961, during the early days of commercial television broadcasting, the [[Five-Company Agreement]] (Gosha Agreement) caused the supply of Japanese movies that were available to Japanese television stations to dry up. As a result, in the 1960s many foreign dramas and other foreign programming was imported and dubbed into Japanese language for television broadcast.\n\nAt first, the NHK subtitled most foreign shows; however, shows dubbed in the Japanese language soon became the standard. At the centre of the first voice acting boom were actors like [[Nachi Nozawa]], who dubbed the same foreign actors, in Nozawa's case [[Alain Delon]], [[Robert Redford]], and [[Giuliano Gemma]]. Because of problems with pay guarantees arising from the Gosha Agreement, cinema actors were prevented from dubbing foreign movies for television. Television actors were also prevented from dubbing because of a similar agreement. This caused studios to turn to actors from the radio age and actors from the ''Shingeki'' style of acting. Around this time dubbing of foreign animation was done by [[Rakugo]] story tellers, [[Asakusa]] comedians, and the like, and voice actors were called \"dubbing talents\" if they specialised in dubbing, while those giving voice to a character went under the name of \"''ateshi''\". It is during this golden age for dubbing that the [[Tokyo Actor's Consumer's Cooperative Society]] was founded. Later, Haikyo voice acting managers left and opened their own management agencies. Voice actors in Japan also voiced anime.\n\nThe first dubbed show broadcast in Japan was an episode of the American cartoon ''[[Superman (1940s cartoons)|Superman]]'', on October 9, 1955, on KRT (today [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]]), and the first non-animated dubbed show broadcast was ''Cowboy G-Men'', again by KRT, in 1956. Both were dubbed live; the first show to be broadcast with pre-recorded dubbing was {{nihongo|''[[The Adventures of Television Boy]]''|\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u574a\u3084\u306e\u5192\u967a|Terebi B\u014dya no B\u014dken}} on April 8, 1956.\n\n===1970s===\nDuring the late 1970s, [[Akio Nojima]], [[Kazuyuki Sogabe]], [[Akira Kamiya]], [[T\u014dru Furuya]] and [[Toshio Furukawa]] were the first to unite into a band, [[:ja:\u30b9\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af (\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9)|Slapstick]], and perform live. Many other voice actors released their own albums. At around 1979 the first anime magazines began to be published. The then editor-in-chief of [[Animage]], [[Hideo Ogata]], was the first to publish editorials on the ongoing transformation of voice actors into [[Japanese idol|idols]]. Following his lead, the other magazines created \"seiy\u016b corners\" with information and gossip about voice actors; this was one of the main causes of young anime fans yearning to become voice actors. This led to a sudden increase in the number of students in voice acting schools. For the first time, anime voice actors were young people who grew up dreaming to become that, as opposed to being members of drama troupes or theatre actors who performed as a hobby. This boom lasted until the first half of the 1980s.\n\n===1980s===\nIn 1989, the voice actors of the five main stars of the animated television show ''[[Ronin Warriors]]'' ([[Nozomu Sasaki]], [[Takeshi Kusao]], [[Hiroshi Takemura]], [[Tomohiro Nishimura]] and [[Daiki Nakamura]]) formed an all-male singing group called \"NG5\". The group was featured as the subject of a special documentary program on [[Mainichi Broadcasting System|MBS]].\n\nDuring this period, voice acting production companies also began to provide specialised courses at on-site training schools specifically for training in animation dubbing.\n\n===1990s===\n[[File:Maria Yamamoto Fanime 2005 Meet the Guests reception.jpg|thumb|Voice actress [[Maria Yamamoto]] in 2005]] \nThe 1960s and 1970s booms were centered on media, such as the TV. In the 1990s, a new boom centred on more personal ways of communication, such as radio shows, [[Original Video Animation]], television quizzes, public events and the Internet, gave way to the publication of the first dedicated voice acting magazines, {{Interlanguage link multi|Seiy\u016b Grand Prix|ja|3=\u58f0\u512a\u30b0\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea}} and [[Voice Animage]]. Voice actors acquired many new fans thanks to the radio, and their CD sale figures increased. Concerts began to be held in the bigger halls. While the second boom also saw the voice actors become DJs, this time the recording houses backed the voice actor radio shows as sponsors, and large sums of money began to circulate. [[Megumi Hayashibara]], [[Hekiru Shiina]] and [[Mariko Kouda]] are the first examples of this new trend. Recording companies and voice acting schools began to devise new ways to raise young voice actors.\n\nWhen voice acting was introduced in television games, the same voice actors would perform in a series of events related to the television game world, making appearances and participating in radio programs based on the television games to attract the fanbase.\n\nIn the second half of the 1990s, the boom in the animation world led to the increase of anime shown in the Tokyo area.

In Japan, the lines are usually performed before the anime has completed. The artist then draws in every expression to the key of the voice actors reading it off. This is the most common{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} way of prerecording in Japan. Young voice actors are used in both the anime and [[original video animation|OVAs]]. However, in fan-oriented productions and products they use voice actors because voice actors are often used as a selling point.\n\n====Dubbing into Japanese====\nIn the case of foreign dramas, movies, cartoons, news and documentaries, the localization voice-over requires more exact timing in relation to what appears on the screen. In order to perform voice-overs, the volume of the original language voice track is lowered, leaving only a faint sound remaining or, in some cases, no sound at all except for the music-and-effects tracks. Voice-over work is primarily performed for news and original foreign dramas. Auditions are held in order to determine who will take on the roles.\n\n====Video games====\n{{Main|Voice acting in video games}}\nUnlike in anime or dubbing roles, in a [[video game]] the voice tracks are often recorded separately due to the way individual voice tracks are selected and played depending on a player's progress. Typically a voice actor uses a script with only a single part's lines and matches it to the timing of the recording. Because of this, many collaborating voice actors in a production may never see each other in person. Popularity rankings may play a role in video game casting, but it is also possible to negotiate fees when a client requests a particular cast.\n\n===Radio drama or CD drama===\nWith a [[radio drama]] or CD drama there is more freedom given in voicing because there is no need to match a dub to the original actors, or to match an animated character. Because of this a voice actor's particular interpretation of an act or acting ability are considered. If the drama is based on an anime or [[manga]] then the voice actor from the anime are used. However, original drama or works based on literature rarely employ typical voice actors or younger voice actors. Auditions are rarely employed, and the cast is directly selected by the production staff.\n\n===Puppet and kigurumi shows===\nIn [[puppet show]]s, the voice actor must time the voice-over in relation to the puppet movements. While timing is of the essence in ''[[Costumed character#In Japan|kigurumi]]'' shows as well, in this case the voice actor's voice acting is recorded beforehand, and it is left to the ''kigurumi'' entertainer to move and act based on the spoken lines.\n\n===Narration===\nVoice actors are also commonly employed as [[narrator]]s in radio and television commercials, radio and television programs, [[press release]] videos and other kinds of media that require the voice actor to read text that clarifies what the program is about from a script. Even though the narration role falls within a voice actor's area of expertise, it is not uncommon for regular actors, young talents or [[announcer]]s to be chosen instead.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Matsuda |first1=Saki |title=\u58f0\u512a\u767d\u66f8 |date=2000 |publisher=Okura Publication |isbn=978-4872785647 |pages=121\u2013122 |language=ja|trans-title=Voice Actor White Paper}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=\u306a\u308a\u305f\u3044!!\u58f0\u512a |date=1998 |publisher=Daiei Publishing Co., Ltd. |isbn=978-4812513019 |language=ja|editor=Daiei Publishing Co., Ltd.}}</ref> The fee is proportional to the popularity of the person employed, and veterans are usually preferred for this role due to the high acting ability it requires; narration is a lot more expensive than any other voice acting because of this.<ref>{{cite book |title=\u306a\u308a\u305f\u3044!!\u58f0\u512a |date=1998 |publisher=Daiei Publishing Co., Ltd. |isbn=978-4812513019 |language=ja|editor=Daiei Publishing Co., Ltd.|page=152}}</ref> Candidates are required to send a short sample recording as a demonstration, and these samples play a large part in the selection process.\n\n===Theatre acting===\nIt is not uncommon for ''[[Shingeki]]'' actors and actors performing in small theatres to take a voice acting course in specialized schools and become voice actors, considering the small difference between actor and voice actor. Those who successfully become voice actors sometimes take stage acting roles of their own choosing, and the voice actor's agency takes no part unless the theatre management requires it.\n\n===Singing===\nSome voice actors branch into music, releasing albums, holding their concert in their own name and becoming full-time singers.\n\nHowever, it has become common for voice actors to sing the opening or closing themes of shows in which their character stars, or participate in non-animated side projects such as audio dramas (involving the same characters in new storylines) or image songs (songs sung in character that are not included in the anime but further develop the character), releasing CDs in the character's name rather than their own. Sometimes the singing style of an anime character is quite different from that of the voice actor, and tracks sung using the style of the character are often included in CDs the voice actors release in their own name. This made singing a central activity for many voice actors, especially those who do voice-overs for anime characters.\n\nThe limitations imposed on singer voice actors by their recording companies are also less strict than the ones imposed on regular singers. This allows voice actors to release CDs in their character's name with different companies.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\n===Radio personality===\nRadio talk shows are also called ''aniradio''. Initially the vast majority was aired by local broadcast stations only, but after the communication boom of the 1990s the metropolitan radio stations began to also employ them. Some such programs aired for over ten years. This was the result of fans who regard radio talks as a way to get to know the voice actors as human beings rather than just voices for the characters they play.\n\nDue to lower costs and the increase in the number of listeners, more and more of these radio talks are hosted on the [[Internet]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Seiyu Awards]]\n* [[Voice acting]]\n* [[Voice foley]]\n* [[:Category:Japanese voice actor management companies|Japanese voice actor management companies]]\n* [[List of Japanese voice actors of foreign descent]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.usagi.org/~doi/seiyuu/ Seiy\u016b (voice actor) database]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060411201835/http://sdb.noppo.com/ Miracle voice actors and magical voice actresses] Voice actor database {{in lang|ja}}\n*[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php Anime News Network Encyclopedia] Database of anime staff and cast members.\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Voice Acting In Japan}}\n[[Category:Japanese voice actors| ]]\n[[Category:Voice acting|Japan]]\n\n[[fi:\u00c4\u00e4nin\u00e4yttelij\u00e4#Japanissa]]\n", "name_user": "2405:204:140c:e692:6432:3140:615a:7f67", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting_in_Japan"}
