It is the 279th overall episode of the show and the 24th episode of the eleventh and final season which aired on [[CBS]] on Wednesday, March 29, 1978 from 8:00 to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. EST.\n\nThe episode, directed by [[Dave Powers (director)|Dave Powers]] and written by a large number of collaborators, was videotaped in front of a live audience on March 17, 1978 at [[CBS Television City]]'s Studio 33 in [[Hollywood|Hollywood, California]].<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19780325&id=lPROAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cAIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6386,2976506&hl=en \"A Special Evening with Carol Burnett\"] at [[The Blade (Toledo, Ohio)|Toledo Blade]], retrieved July 4, 2016.</ref>\n\n==Summary==\n[[Carol Burnett]], [[Tim Conway]] and [[Vicki Lawrence]] reminisce about past shows and introduce excerpts spanning eleven seasons of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which include the following highlights: Burnett does her [[Tarzan yell]] and performs in duets with such guests as [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Perry Como]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Steve Lawrence]] and [[Eydie Gorm\u00e9]]; in comic skits, [[Burt Reynolds]] sings \"[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]]\"; [[Harvey Korman]] sings \"[[They Call the Wind Maria]]\"; and Burnett sings \"[[Come Rain or Come Shine]],\" \"[[The Lady Is a Tramp]],\" and \"[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]]\"; movie parodies include ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' and ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]''.\n\nAdditional highlights include Lawrence singing \"[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]\" and \"S-P-L-I-T\", a spoof of a country-and-western song; Bing Crosby and [[Bob Hope]] appear in a restaurant skit; Conway performs the role of a sports commentator in his very first sketch on the series; a ''[[Columbo]]'' parody titled \"Cobumble\" is featured and [[Dick Van Dyke]] appears with Burnett in the comic sketch \"Hand Insurance\"; a series of bloopers and outtakes are included from previous shows featuring the regular cast.\n\nAlso featured are new sketches of \"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\" and \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\". In the \"Mrs. Wiggins\" sketch titled ''Flashbacks'', Mr. Tudball (Conway) is moving his office to a new location and has a flashback of when he first met and interviewed Mrs. Wiggins (Burnett); and in \"The Family\" sketch ''The Psychiatrist'', [[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice]] (Burnett) and [[Thelma Harper|Mama]] (Lawrence) visit a psychiatrist ([[Craig Richard Nelson]]) as Eunice is trying to figure out what went wrong with her life. (Although these were the final sketches of ''The Carol Burnett Show'', the characters would end up being reprised one year later in a different four-week series, ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'').\n\nAs a special surprise for Burnett, Conway introduces a piano player and \u2013 when the curtain goes up \u2013 it is legendary screen actor [[James Stewart]] playing the piano and singing \"[[Ragtime Cowboy Joe]]\". Burnett, a lifelong fan of Stewart's, breaks down in tears and expresses how much she admires and loves him, and Stewart reciprocates by saying: \"Carol, I just feel so wonderful to be here, to be a part of all these millions of people to thank you for all the wonderful beautiful times you've given all of us, all of these eleven years. And I'm frankly speaking for all the millions of people\".\n\nIn the final moments of the show, Burnett, as the Charwoman, is backstage and waves goodbye to the show's staff and celebrities from the audience as they silently walk by to wish her farewell. Harvey Korman, who was appearing as a guest, stops and gives her a kiss; Lawrence comes out of a stage door, signs Burnett's autograph book, kisses and hugs her and leaves; Conway comes down the stairs and does the same.\n\nShe then walks across the empty stage towards a sign reading THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW and flips it over to read CLOSED. Sitting on her Charwoman's bucket, Burnett talks about how hard it is to leave and why she decided to end the show despite a season 12 renewal. She says it felt like the time to move on to do other things while the show was still doing well. She talks about the crew and each member of her cast and how much she loves and respects them. Finally, she thanks the audience and tearfully sings a soulful rendition of the show's closing theme-song \"I'm So Glad We Had This Time Together\".

It is the 279th overall episode of the show and the 24th episode of the eleventh and final season which aired on [[CBS]] on Wednesday, March 29, 1978 from 8:00 to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. EST.\n\nThe episode, directed by [[Dave Powers (director)|Dave Powers]] and written by a large number of collaborators, was videotaped in front of a live audience on March 17, 1978 at [[CBS Television City]]'s Studio 33 in [[Hollywood|Hollywood, California]].<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19780325&id=lPROAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cAIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6386,2976506&hl=en \"A Special Evening with Carol Burnett\"] at [[The Blade (Toledo, Ohio)|Toledo Blade]], retrieved July 4, 2016.</ref>\n\n==Summary==\n[[Carol Burnett]], [[Tim Conway]] and [[Vicki Lawrence]] reminisce about past shows and introduce excerpts spanning eleven seasons of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which include the following highlights: Burnett does her [[Tarzan yell]] and performs in duets with such guests as [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Perry Como]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Steve Lawrence]] and [[Eydie Gorm\u00e9]]; in comic skits, [[Burt Reynolds]] sings \"[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]]\"; [[Harvey Korman]] sings \"[[They Call the Wind Maria]]\"; and Burnett sings \"[[Come Rain or Come Shine]],\" \"[[The Lady Is a Tramp]],\" and \"[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]]\"; movie parodies include ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' and ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]''.\n\nAdditional highlights include Lawrence singing \"[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]\" and \"S-P-L-I-T\", a spoof of a country-and-western song; Bing Crosby and [[Bob Hope]] appear in a restaurant skit; Conway performs the role of a sports commentator in his very first sketch on the series; a ''[[Columbo]]'' parody titled \"Cobumble\" is featured and [[Dick Van Dyke]] appears in a comic sketch; a series of bloopers and outtakes are included from previous shows featuring the regular cast.\n\nAlso featured are new sketches of \"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\" and \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\". In the \"Mrs. Wiggins\" sketch titled ''Flashbacks'', Mr. Tudball (Conway) is moving his office to a new location and has a flashback of when he first met and interviewed Mrs. Wiggins (Burnett); and in \"The Family\" sketch ''The Psychiatrist'', [[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice]] (Burnett) and [[Thelma Harper|Mama]] (Lawrence) visit a psychiatrist ([[Craig Richard Nelson]]) as Eunice is trying to figure out what went wrong with her life. (Although these were the final sketches of ''The Carol Burnett Show'', the characters would end up being reprised one year later in a different four-week series, ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'').\n\nAs a special surprise for Burnett, Conway introduces a piano player and \u2013 when the curtain goes up \u2013 it is legendary screen actor [[James Stewart]] playing the piano and singing \"[[Ragtime Cowboy Joe]]\". Burnett, a lifelong fan of Stewart's, breaks down in tears and expresses how much she admires and loves him, and Stewart reciprocates by saying: \"Carol, I just feel so wonderful to be here, to be a part of all these millions of people to thank you for all the wonderful beautiful times you've given all of us, all of these eleven years. And I'm frankly speaking for all the millions of people\".\n\nIn the final moments of the show, Burnett, as the Charwoman, is backstage and waves goodbye to the show's staff and celebrities from the audience as they silently walk by to wish her farewell. Harvey Korman, who was appearing as a guest, stops and gives her a kiss; Lawrence comes out of a stage door, signs Burnett's autograph book, kisses and hugs her and leaves; Conway comes down the stairs and does the same.\n\nShe then walks across the empty stage towards a sign reading THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW and flips it over to read CLOSED. Sitting on her Charwoman's bucket, Burnett talks about how hard it is to leave and why she decided to end the show despite a season 12 renewal. She says it felt like the time to move on to do other things while the show was still doing well. She talks about the crew and each member of her cast and how much she loves and respects them. Finally, she thanks the audience and tearfully sings a soulful rendition of the show's closing theme-song \"I'm So Glad We Had This Time Together\". She blows a kiss to the audience, tugs at her ear one last time and says goodnight.<ref>[http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/the-carol-burnett-show/ ''The Carol Burnett Show'' TV series finale], retrieved July 4, 2016.</ref>\n\n==Production notes==\nAlthough [[CBS]] wanted to renew the show for another year, by this time, Burnett had grown tired of the weekly grind and wanted to explore acting roles outside of the comedy genre.

In 2011 Baghdad probably will increase oil exports above the current level of {{convert|1900000|oilbbl|m3|abbr=on}} per day as a result of new contracts with international oil companies, but is likely to fall short of the {{convert|2400000|oilbbl|m3}} per day it is forecasting in its budget. Iraq's recent contracts with major oil companies have the potential to greatly expand oil revenues, but Iraq will need to upgrade its oil processing, pipeline, and export infrastructure to enable these deals to reach their potential.\n\nAn improved security environment and an initial wave of foreign investment are helping to spur economic activity, particularly in the energy, construction, and retail sectors. Broader economic improvement, long-term fiscal health, and sustained increases in the standard of living still depend on the government passing major policy reforms and on continued development of Iraq's massive oil reserves. Although foreign investors viewed Iraq with increasing interest in 2010, most are still hampered by difficulties in acquiring land for projects and by other regulatory impediments.\n\n[[Inflation]] has decreased consistently since 2006 as the security situation has improved. However, Iraqi leaders remain hard pressed to translate macroeconomic gains into improved lives for ordinary Iraqis. Unemployment remains a problem throughout the country.\n\n==Recent history==\nNominal GDP grew by 213% in the 1960s, 1325% in the 1970s, 2% in the 1980s, \u221247% in the 1990s, and 317% in 2000s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&idim=country:IRQ&dl=en&hl=en&q=gdp+iraq|title=World Development Indicators - Google Public Data Explorer|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nReal GDP per capita (measured in 1990 $) increased significantly during the 1950s, 60s and 70s, which can be explained by both higher oil production levels as well as oil prices, which famously peaked in the 1970s due to the [[OPEC|OPEC's]] oil embargo, causing the [[1973 oil crisis]]. In following two decades however, GDP per capita in Iraq dropped substantially because of multiple wars, namely the 1980-88 war with Iran, the 1990-1991 Gulf War.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

Oil production had reached a level of 560,000 m\u00b3 (3.5 million barrels) per day in 1979, and oil revenues were 21 billion dollars in 1979 and 27 billion in 1980 due to record oil prices. At the outbreak of the war, Iraq had amassed an estimated 35 billion in [[foreign exchange reserves]].\n\nThe [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] and the [[1980s oil glut]] depleted Iraq's foreign exchange reserves, devastated its economy, and left the country saddled with a foreign debt of more than $40 billion. After the initial destruction of the war, oil exports gradually increased with the construction of new pipelines and the restoration of damaged facilities.\n\n===Sanctions===\nIraq's seizure of [[Invasion of Kuwait|Kuwait]] in August 1990, subsequent [[Iraq sanctions|international economic sanctions on Iraq]], and damage from military action by an international coalition beginning in January 1991, drastically reduced economic activity. The regime exacerbated shortages by supporting large military and internal security forces and by allocating resources to key supporters of the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Iraq Region|Ba'ath Party]]. The implementation of the [[United Nations|UN]]'s [[Oil for Food program]] in December 1996 helped improve economic conditions. For the first six six-month phases of the program, Iraq was allowed to export increasing amounts of oil in exchange for food, medicine, and other humanitarian goods. In December 1999, the UN Security Council authorized Iraq to export as much oil as required to meet humanitarian needs. Per capita food imports increased substantially, while medical supplies and health care services steadily improved, though per capita economic production and living standards were still well below their prewar level.\n\nIraq changed its oil [[reserve currency]] from the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]] to the [[euro]] in 2000. However, 28% of Iraq's export revenues under the program were deducted to meet UN Compensation Fund and UN administrative expenses. The drop in [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] in 2001 was largely the result of the global economic slowdown and lower oil prices.\n\n===After the fall of Saddam Hussein===\n{{main|Economic reform of Iraq}}\nThe removal of sanctions on 24 May 2003 and [[World oil market chronology from 2003|rising oil prices]] in the mid-to-late 2000s led to a doubling in oil production from a low of 1.3 mbpd during the turbulence of 2003 to a high of 2.6 mbpd in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/energy.aspx?country=iq&product=oil&graph=production|title=Iraq Crude Oil Production by Year|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref> Furthermore, reduced inflation<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG/countries/IQ?display=default|title=Inflation, consumer prices (annual %)|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref> and violence<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.law.harvard.edu/mesh/2009/04/measuring-iraq/|title=\u00bb Measuring Iraq Middle East Strategy at Harvard|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref> since 2007 have translated to real increases in living standards for Iraqis.\n\nOne of the key economic challenges was Iraq's immense foreign debt, estimated at $125 billion.  Although some of this debt was derived from normal export contracts that Iraq had failed to pay for, some was a result of military and financial support during Iraq's war with Iran.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/cfr/international/slot3_110703.html|title=Q&A: Iraq's Debt|access-date=2018-01-24}}</ref>\n\nThe Jubilee Iraq campaign<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jubileeiraq.org/odiousdebt.htm |title=Jubilee Iraq |accessdate=3 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306000652/http://www.jubileeiraq.org/odiousdebt.htm |archivedate=6 March 2011}}</ref> argued that much of these debts were [[odious debt|odious]] (illegitimate). However, as the concept of [[odious debt]] is not accepted {{citationneeded|date=January 2020}}, trying to deal with the debt on those terms would have embroiled Iraq in legal disputes for years. Iraq decided to deal with its debt more pragmatically and approached the [[Paris Club]] of official creditors.\n\nIn a December 2006 ''[[Newsweek International]]'' article, a study by [[Global Insight]] in [[London]] was reported to show \"that Civil war or not, Iraq has an economy, and\u2014mother of all surprises\u2014it's doing remarkably well.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce reports 34,000 registered companies in Iraq, up from 8,000 three years ago. Sales of secondhand cars, televisions and mobile phones have all risen sharply. Estimates vary, but one from Global Insight puts GDP growth at 17 percent last year and projects 13 percent for 2006. The World Bank has it lower: at 4 percent this year. But, given all the attention paid to deteriorating security, the startling fact is that Iraq is growing at all.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2006/12/24/blood-and-money.html | title=Blood and Money: In what might be called the mother of all surprises, Iraq's economy is growing strong, even booming in places | publisher=Newsweek International (In The Daily Beast) | author=Silvia Spring |date=2006-12-24}}</ref>\n\n==Industry==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}\nTraditionally, most of Iraq's manufacturing activity has been closely connected to the [[oil industry]]. The major industries in that category have been petroleum refining and the manufacture of chemicals and fertilizers. Before 2003, diversification was hindered by limitations on [[privatization]] and the effects of the international sanctions of the 1990s. Since 2003, security problems have blocked efforts to establish new enterprises. The construction industry is an exception; in 2000 cement was the only major industrial product not based on hydrocarbons. The construction industry has profited from the need to rebuild after Iraq's several wars. In the 1990s, the industry benefited from government funding of extensive infrastructure and housing projects and elaborate palace complexes.\n\n==Primary sectors==\n===Agriculture===\nAgriculture contributes just 3.3% to the [[gross national product]] and employs a fifth of the labor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/iz.html|title=Middle East :: Iraq \u2014 The World Factbook - Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, 50 to 60 percent of Iraq's arable land has been under cultivation.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZeGZBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA176&lpg=PA176&dq=Historically,+50+to+60+percent+of+Iraq%E2%80%99s+arable+land+has+been+under+cultivation.#v=onepage&q=Historically,%2050%20to%2060%20percent%20of%20Iraq%E2%80%99s%20arable%20land%20has%20been%20under%20cultivation.&f=false|title=Iraq Country Study Guide Volume 1 Strategic Information and Developments|last=Inc|first=IBP|date=2012-03-03|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781438774633|language=en}}{{self-published source}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}} Because of ethnic politics, valuable farmland in [[Kurdistan|Kurdish]] territory has not contributed to the national economy, and inconsistent agricultural policies under Saddam Hussein discouraged domestic market production. Despite its abundant land and water resources, Iraq is a net food importer. Under the UN [[Oil for Food program]], Iraq imported large quantities of grains, meat, poultry, and dairy products. The government abolished its [[collective farming|farm collectivization]] program in 1981, allowing a greater role for private enterprise in agriculture.\n\nIraqi agriculture suffered substantial physical disruption from the [[Gulf War]], and economic disruption from [[Economic sanctions|sanctions]] imposed by the United Nations (August 1990).  Sanctions curtailed imports by cutting off Iraq's petroleum exports, and embargoing those agricultural production inputs deemed to have potential military applications.  The Iraqi government responded by monopolizing grain and oilseed marketing, imposing production quotas, and instituting a [[Public Distribution System]] for basic foodstuffs.  By mid-1991 the government supplied a \"basket\" of foodstuffs that provided about one-third of the caloric daily requirement, and cost consumers about five percent of its market value.  With subsidies for agricultural inputs diminished, the prices that the government paid to farmers failed to cover their costs.  The implicit tax on agricultural production was estimated to reach 20 to 35 percent by the mid-1990s.  In October 1991 the Baghdad regime had withdrawn personnel from the northern region controlled by two Kurdish parties. [[Kurdistan Region]] was described as \"... a market economy essentially left alone by a very weak governing structure, but heavily influenced by substantial international humanitarian aid flows.\"<ref>Randy Schnepf, Iraq Agriculture and Food Supply:  Background and Issues, (Washington DC:  Congressional Research Service, Library of Congress, 7 June 2004) p 37.</ref>\n\nUnder an \"Oil for Food Program\" negotiated with the United Nations, in December 1996 Iraq started exporting petroleum, and used the proceeds to start importing foodstuffs three months later.  Grain imports averaged $828 million in the years 1997-2001, an increase of over 180 percent from the previous five-year period. Due to foreign competition, Iraqi production declined (29 percent for wheat, 31 percent for barley, and 52 percent for maize). Because the government had generally neglected the production of forage crops, fruits, vegetables, and livestock other than poultry, those sectors had remained more traditional and market-based, and less buffeted by international affairs. Nevertheless, severe drought, an outbreak of screwworm, and an epizootic of foot-and-mouth disease devastated production during this period.<ref>Beer, Sam.

Seeking to re-orient Iraq's economy toward private ownership and international competitiveness, the United States saw the dismantling of the Public Distribution System as essential for a market-driven agriculture.  Because of the great reliance of most Iraqis on government-subsidized food, this goal was never realized. Increased productivity became the focus of much of the US-funded agricultural reconstruction program.  Many of these projects were undertaken by the Agricultural Reconstruction and Development Iraq (ARDI)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/iraq-agriculture-reconstruction-and-development-program-iraq-ardi|title=Agriculture Reconstruction and Development Program for Iraq (ARDI)|website=DAI: International Development|accessdate=30 August 2018}}</ref> program run by Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI) of Bethesda, Maryland, under a contract with USAID signed on 15 October 2003.  While ARDI participated in limited ways, the restoration of Iraq's irrigation systems was mostly funded under USAID's contract with Bechtel International.\n\nARDI conducted demonstration trials of improved practices and varieties of many crops: winter cereals (wheat and barley), summer cereals (rice, maize, and sorghum), potatoes, and tomatoes. Feed supplements and veterinary treatments were demonstrated to increase ovulation, conception, and birth weights of livestock.  Surveys were conducted of poultry growers and apple farmers. Nurseries were established for date palms and grapes.  College buildings and farm tractors were rebuilt. ARDI had projects promoting trade associations and producers' co-ops, but also supported extension as an appropriate governmental function.  The contract eventually cost over $100 million and lasted through December 2006.  Under its Community Action Program, USAID also funded an analysis of markets for sheep and wool.  It awarded a contract to the University of Hawaii to revitalize higher education in agriculture.  It awarded a contract for $120 million to the Louis Berger Group to promote Iraq's private sector, including agriculture.<ref>Beer, Sam. [https://books.google.ca/books?id=ty5oDQAAQBAJ&lpg=PT16&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false ''The United States' Program for Agriculture in Post-Invasion Iraq'']. 2016.</ref>\n\nStarting in 2006, agricultural reconstruction was also conducted by Provincial Reconstruction Teams within the occupying military forces.  Intended to promote goodwill and sap the insurgency, \"PRTs\" allowed military commanders to identify local needs and, with few bureaucratic hurdles, to dispense up to $500,000. Civilians from many agencies within the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]], as well as [[USAID]], served tours on PRTs.  Some participants criticized the absence of a national agricultural strategy, or clear direction on the design of projects.  Others complained that projects emphasized \"American-style, 21st-century agricultural technologies and methodologies...\" that were inappropriate for Iraq.<ref>Bernard Carreau, ed. \u201cLessons from USDA in Iraq and Afghanistan,\u201d  ''Prism'' Vol. 1, No. 3, (September 2011): 139.</ref>\n\nAgricultural production has not rebounded noticeably from the reconstruction program.  According to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), between 2002 and 2013, production of wheat increased 11 percent and milled rice 8 percent, but barley had decreased 13 percent and maize 40 percent.  Scaled in \"international dollars\" (2004-2006 base equaling 100) Iraq's per capita food production was 135 in 2002, 96 in 2007, and 94 in 2012.  The agricultural sector shed workers.  In those same years, production per worker was 117, 106, and 130, respectively.<ref>\u201cFAOSTAT Country Profiles:  Iraq.\u201d  [http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/index/en/?iso3=IRQ FAO website]</ref>\n\nThe international [[Oil-for-Food program]] (1997\u20132003) further reduced farm production by supplying artificially priced foreign foodstuffs. The military action of 2003 did little damage to Iraqi agriculture; because of favorable weather conditions, in that year grain production was 22 percent higher than in 2002. Although growth continued in 2004, experts predicted that Iraq will be an importer of agricultural products for the foreseeable future. Long-term plans call for investment in agricultural machinery and materials and more prolific crop varieties\u2014improvements that did not reach Iraq's farmers under the Hussein regime. In 2004 the main agricultural crops were wheat, barley, corn, rice, vegetables, dates, and cotton, and the main livestock outputs were cattle and sheep.\n\nThe [[Agricultural Cooperative Bank of Iraq|Agricultural Cooperative Bank]], capitalized at nearly 1 G$ - by 1984, targets its low-interest, low-collateral loans to private farmers for mechanization, poultry projects, and orchard development. Large modern cattle, [[dairy farming|dairy]], and poultry farms are under construction. Obstacles to agricultural development include labour shortages, inadequate management and maintenance, salinization, [[urbanization|urban migration]], and dislocations resulting from previous land reform and collectivization programs.\n\nIn 2011, an agricultural adviser to the Iraqi government, [[Layth Mahdi]], summarized the forced United States agricultural reconstruction:<blockquote>Prior to 2003, Iraq had imported about 30 percent of its food needs annually. The decline in agricultural production after this period, created the need for importing 90 percent of the food at a cost estimated at more than $12 billion annually. Due to the sudden shift in the agricultural policy from subsidized assistance to an immediate shift to a free market policy, the outcomes led to a decline in production. The observed outcome resulted in many farmers abandoning the land and agriculture. The impact on natural resources results in an exploited and degraded environment leaving the land destitute and the people impoverished, unemployed [and] experiencing a sense of losing their human dignity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.iraq-businessnews.com/2011/06/08/agricultural-production-iraq%E2%80%99s-best-chance-for-restoring-food-security/|title=Agricultural Production: Iraq\u2019s Best Chance for Restoring Food Security|work=Iraq Business News|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en-US}}</ref></blockquote>Importation of foreign workers and increased entry of women into traditionally male labour roles have helped compensate for agricultural and industrial labour shortages exacerbated by the war.

The 17 private banks established during the 1990s were limited to domestic transactions and attracted few private depositors. Those banks and two main state banks were badly damaged by the international embargo of the 1990s. To further privatize and expand the system, in 2003 the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] removed restrictions on international bank transactions and freed the [[Central Bank of Iraq]] (CBI) from government control. In its first year of independent operation, the CBI received credit for limiting Iraq's inflation. In 2004 three foreign banks received licenses to do business in Iraq.\n\n===Private security===\nBecause of the danger posed by Iraq's ongoing insurgency, the security industry has been a uniquely prosperous part of the services sector. Often run by former US military personnel, in 2005 at least 26 companies offered personal and institutional protection, surveillance, and other forms of security.\n\n===Retail===\nIn the early post-Hussein period, a [[freewheel]]ing retail trade in all types of commodities straddled the line between legitimate and illegitimate commerce, taking advantage of the lack of income tax and import controls.\n\n===Tourism===\nThe [[Tourism in Iraq|Iraq tourism industry]], which in peaceful times has profited from Iraq's many places of cultural interest (earning US$14 million in 2001), has been dormant since 2003.

In 2003 oil accounted for about US$7.4 billion of Iraq's total US$7.6 billion of export value, and statistics for earlier years showed similar proportions. After the end of the trade embargo in 2003 expanded the range of exports, oil continued to occupy the dominant position: in 2004 Iraq's export income doubled (to US$16.5 billion), but oil accounted for all but US$340 million (2 percent) of the total. In late 2004, sabotage significantly reduced oil output, and experts forecast that output, hence exports, would be below capacity in 2005 as well. In 2004 the chief export markets were the United States (which accounted for nearly half), Italy, France, Jordan, Canada, and the Netherlands. In 2004 the value of Iraq's imports was US$21.7 billion, incurring a trade deficit of about US$5.2 billion. In 2003 the main sources of Iraq's imports were Turkey, Jordan, Vietnam, the United States, Germany, and Britain. Because of Iraq's inactive manufacturing sector, the range of imports was quite large, including food, fuels, medicines, and manufactured goods. By 2010, exports rose to US$50.8 billion and imports rose to US$45.2 billion.  Chief 2009 export partners were: U.S., India, Italy, South Korea, Taiwan, China, Netherlands, and Japan. Chief 2009 import partners were: Turkey, Syria, U.S., China, Jordan, Italy, and Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/6804.htm|title=Iraq|work=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{dmoz|Regional/Middle_East/Iraq/Business_and_Economy/Economic_Development|Iraq Economic Development}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091219131236/http://www.iauiraq.org/ Iraq Inter-Agency Information & Analysis Unit] Reports, Maps and Assessments of Iraq from the UN Inter-Agency Information & Analysis Unit\n*[http://www.oilandgasinfrastructure.com/home/oilandgasmiddleeast/iraq Map of Iraq's oil and gas infrastructure]\n\n{{Iraq topics}}\n{{Asia topic|Economy of}}\n{{OPEC}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Iraq, Economy of}}\n[[Category:Economy of Iraq| ]]\n[[Category:Economy of the Arab League]]\n[[Category:OPEC]]\n[[Category:Economy of the Middle East]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Economy of the country}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{POV check|date=February 2010}}\n{{Update|inaccurate=yes|date=October 2011}}\n}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{Infobox economy\n| country             = Iraq\n| image               = US Navy 090328-N-0803S-012 Sailors walk along Iraq's Khawr Al Amaya Oil Platform (KAAOT).

In 2011 Baghdad probably will increase oil exports above the current level of {{convert|1900000|oilbbl|m3|abbr=on}} per day as a result of new contracts with international oil companies, but is likely to fall short of the {{convert|2400000|oilbbl|m3}} per day it is forecasting in its budget. Iraq's recent contracts with major oil companies have the potential to greatly expand oil revenues, but Iraq will need to upgrade its oil processing, pipeline, and export infrastructure to enable these deals to reach their potential.\n\nAn improved security environment and an initial wave of foreign investment are helping to spur economic activity, particularly in the energy, construction, and retail sectors. Broader economic improvement, long-term fiscal health, and sustained increases in the standard of living still depend on the government passing major policy reforms and on continued development of Iraq's massive oil reserves. Although foreign investors viewed Iraq with increasing interest in 2010, most are still hampered by difficulties in acquiring land for projects and by other regulatory impediments.\n\n[[Inflation]] has decreased consistently since 2006 as the security situation has improved. However, Iraqi leaders remain hard pressed to translate macroeconomic gains into improved lives for ordinary Iraqis. Unemployment remains a problem throughout the country.\n\n==Recent history==\nNominal GDP grew by 213% in the 1960s, 1325% in the 1970s, 2% in the 1980s, \u221247% in the 1990s, and 317% in 2000s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&idim=country:IRQ&dl=en&hl=en&q=gdp+iraq|title=World Development Indicators - Google Public Data Explorer|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nReal GDP per capita (measured in 1990 $) increased significantly during the 1950s, 60s and 70s, which can be explained by both higher oil production levels as well as oil prices, which famously peaked in the 1970s due to the [[OPEC|OPEC's]] oil embargo, causing the [[1973 oil crisis]].

Oil production had reached a level of 560,000 m\u00b3 (3.5 million barrels) per day in 1979, and oil revenues were 21 billion dollars in 1979 and 27 billion in 1980 due to record oil prices. At the outbreak of the war, Iraq had amassed an estimated 35 billion in [[foreign exchange reserves]].\n\nThe [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] and the [[1980s oil glut]] depleted Iraq's foreign exchange reserves, devastated its economy, and left the country saddled with a foreign debt of more than $40 billion. After the initial destruction of the war, oil exports gradually increased with the construction of new pipelines and the restoration of damaged facilities.\n\n===Sanctions===\nIraq's seizure of [[Invasion of Kuwait|Kuwait]] in August 1990, subsequent [[Iraq sanctions|international economic sanctions on Iraq]], and damage from military action by an international coalition beginning in January 1991, drastically reduced economic activity. The regime exacerbated shortages by supporting large military and internal security forces and by allocating resources to key supporters of the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Iraq Region|Ba'ath Party]]. The implementation of the [[United Nations|UN]]'s [[Oil for Food program]] in December 1996 helped improve economic conditions. For the first six six-month phases of the program, Iraq was allowed to export increasing amounts of oil in exchange for food, medicine, and other humanitarian goods. In December 1999, the UN Security Council authorized Iraq to export as much oil as required to meet humanitarian needs. Per capita food imports increased substantially, while medical supplies and health care services steadily improved, though per capita economic production and living standards were still well below their prewar level.\n\nIraq changed its oil [[reserve currency]] from the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]] to the [[euro]] in 2000. However, 28% of Iraq's export revenues under the program were deducted to meet UN Compensation Fund and UN administrative expenses. The drop in [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] in 2001 was largely the result of the global economic slowdown and lower oil prices.\n\n===After the fall of Saddam Hussein===\n{{main|Economic reform of Iraq}}\nThe removal of sanctions on 24 May 2003 and [[World oil market chronology from 2003|rising oil prices]] in the mid-to-late 2000s led to a doubling in oil production from a low of 1.3 mbpd during the turbulence of 2003 to a high of 2.6 mbpd in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/energy.aspx?country=iq&product=oil&graph=production|title=Iraq Crude Oil Production by Year|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref> Furthermore, reduced inflation<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG/countries/IQ?display=default|title=Inflation, consumer prices (annual %)|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref> and violence<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.law.harvard.edu/mesh/2009/04/measuring-iraq/|title=\u00bb Measuring Iraq Middle East Strategy at Harvard|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref> since 2007 have translated to real increases in living standards for Iraqis.\n\nOne of the key economic challenges was Iraq's immense foreign debt, estimated at $125 billion.  Although some of this debt was derived from normal export contracts that Iraq had failed to pay for, some was a result of military and financial support during Iraq's war with Iran.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/cfr/international/slot3_110703.html|title=Q&A: Iraq's Debt|access-date=2018-01-24}}</ref>\n\nThe Jubilee Iraq campaign<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jubileeiraq.org/odiousdebt.htm |title=Jubilee Iraq |accessdate=3 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306000652/http://www.jubileeiraq.org/odiousdebt.htm |archivedate=6 March 2011}}</ref> argued that much of these debts were [[odious debt|odious]] (illegitimate). However, as the concept of [[odious debt]] is not accepted {{citationneeded|date=January 2020}}, trying to deal with the debt on those terms would have embroiled Iraq in legal disputes for years. Iraq decided to deal with its debt more pragmatically and approached the [[Paris Club]] of official creditors.\n\nIn a December 2006 ''[[Newsweek International]]'' article, a study by [[Global Insight]] in [[London]] was reported to show \"that Civil war or not, Iraq has an economy, and\u2014mother of all surprises\u2014it's doing remarkably well.

Estimates vary, but one from Global Insight puts GDP growth at 17 percent last year and projects 13 percent for 2006. The World Bank has it lower: at 4 percent this year. But, given all the attention paid to deteriorating security, the startling fact is that Iraq is growing at all.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2006/12/24/blood-and-money.html | title=Blood and Money: In what might be called the mother of all surprises, Iraq's economy is growing strong, even booming in places | publisher=Newsweek International (In The Daily Beast) | author=Silvia Spring |date=2006-12-24}}</ref>\n\n==Industry==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}\nTraditionally, most of Iraq's manufacturing activity has been closely connected to the [[oil industry]]. The major industries in that category have been petroleum refining and the manufacture of chemicals and fertilizers. Before 2003, diversification was hindered by limitations on [[privatization]] and the effects of the international sanctions of the 1990s. Since 2003, security problems have blocked efforts to establish new enterprises. The construction industry is an exception; in 2000 cement was the only major industrial product not based on hydrocarbons. The construction industry has profited from the need to rebuild after Iraq's several wars. In the 1990s, the industry benefited from government funding of extensive infrastructure and housing projects and elaborate palace complexes.\n\n==Primary sectors==\n===Agriculture===\nAgriculture contributes just 3.3% to the [[gross national product]] and employs a fifth of the labor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/iz.html|title=Middle East :: Iraq \u2014 The World Factbook - Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, 50 to 60 percent of Iraq's arable land has been under cultivation.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZeGZBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA176&lpg=PA176&dq=Historically,+50+to+60+percent+of+Iraq%E2%80%99s+arable+land+has+been+under+cultivation.#v=onepage&q=Historically,%2050%20to%2060%20percent%20of%20Iraq%E2%80%99s%20arable%20land%20has%20been%20under%20cultivation.&f=false|title=Iraq Country Study Guide Volume 1 Strategic Information and Developments|last=Inc|first=IBP|date=2012-03-03|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781438774633|language=en}}{{self-published source}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}} Because of ethnic politics, valuable farmland in [[Kurdistan|Kurdish]] territory has not contributed to the national economy, and inconsistent agricultural policies under Saddam Hussein discouraged domestic market production. Despite its abundant land and water resources, Iraq is a net food importer. Under the UN [[Oil for Food program]], Iraq imported large quantities of grains, meat, poultry, and dairy products. The government abolished its [[collective farming|farm collectivization]] program in 1981, allowing a greater role for private enterprise in agriculture.\n\nIraqi agriculture suffered substantial physical disruption from the [[Gulf War]], and economic disruption from [[Economic sanctions|sanctions]] imposed by the United Nations (August 1990).  Sanctions curtailed imports by cutting off Iraq's petroleum exports, and embargoing those agricultural production inputs deemed to have potential military applications.  The Iraqi government responded by monopolizing grain and oilseed marketing, imposing production quotas, and instituting a [[Public Distribution System]] for basic foodstuffs.  By mid-1991 the government supplied a \"basket\" of foodstuffs that provided about one-third of the caloric daily requirement, and cost consumers about five percent of its market value.  With subsidies for agricultural inputs diminished, the prices that the government paid to farmers failed to cover their costs.  The implicit tax on agricultural production was estimated to reach 20 to 35 percent by the mid-1990s.  In October 1991 the Baghdad regime had withdrawn personnel from the northern region controlled by two Kurdish parties. [[Kurdistan Region]] was described as \"... a market economy essentially left alone by a very weak governing structure, but heavily influenced by substantial international humanitarian aid flows.\"<ref>Randy Schnepf, Iraq Agriculture and Food Supply:  Background and Issues, (Washington DC:  Congressional Research Service, Library of Congress, 7 June 2004) p 37.</ref>\n\nUnder an \"Oil for Food Program\" negotiated with the United Nations, in December 1996 Iraq started exporting petroleum, and used the proceeds to start importing foodstuffs three months later.  Grain imports averaged $828 million in the years 1997-2001, an increase of over 180 percent from the previous five-year period. Due to foreign competition, Iraqi production declined (29 percent for wheat, 31 percent for barley, and 52 percent for maize). Because the government had generally neglected the production of forage crops, fruits, vegetables, and livestock other than poultry, those sectors had remained more traditional and market-based, and less buffeted by international affairs. Nevertheless, severe drought, an outbreak of screwworm, and an epizootic of foot-and-mouth disease devastated production during this period.<ref>Beer, Sam. [https://books.google.ca/books?id=ty5oDQAAQBAJ&lpg=PT16&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false The United States' Program for Agriculture in Post-Invasion Iraq]. 2016.</ref>  As the Oil for Food Program expanded to cover more agricultural inputs and machinery, the productivity of Iraqi agriculture stabilized around 2002.\n\nFollowing the invasion led by the United States in March 2003, with incomes of many Iraqis devastated, the market for foodstuffs shrunk. Seeking to re-orient Iraq's economy toward private ownership and international competitiveness, the United States saw the dismantling of the Public Distribution System as essential for a market-driven agriculture.  Because of the great reliance of most Iraqis on government-subsidized food, this goal was never realized. Increased productivity became the focus of much of the US-funded agricultural reconstruction program.  Many of these projects were undertaken by the Agricultural Reconstruction and Development Iraq (ARDI)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/iraq-agriculture-reconstruction-and-development-program-iraq-ardi|title=Agriculture Reconstruction and Development Program for Iraq (ARDI)|website=DAI: International Development|accessdate=30 August 2018}}</ref> program run by Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI) of Bethesda, Maryland, under a contract with USAID signed on 15 October 2003.  While ARDI participated in limited ways, the restoration of Iraq's irrigation systems was mostly funded under USAID's contract with Bechtel International.\n\nARDI conducted demonstration trials of improved practices and varieties of many crops: winter cereals (wheat and barley), summer cereals (rice, maize, and sorghum), potatoes, and tomatoes. Feed supplements and veterinary treatments were demonstrated to increase ovulation, conception, and birth weights of livestock.  Surveys were conducted of poultry growers and apple farmers. Nurseries were established for date palms and grapes.  College buildings and farm tractors were rebuilt. ARDI had projects promoting trade associations and producers' co-ops, but also supported extension as an appropriate governmental function.  The contract eventually cost over $100 million and lasted through December 2006.  Under its Community Action Program, USAID also funded an analysis of markets for sheep and wool.  It awarded a contract to the University of Hawaii to revitalize higher education in agriculture.  It awarded a contract for $120 million to the Louis Berger Group to promote Iraq's private sector, including agriculture.<ref>Beer, Sam. [https://books.google.ca/books?id=ty5oDQAAQBAJ&lpg=PT16&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false ''The United States' Program for Agriculture in Post-Invasion Iraq'']. 2016.</ref>\n\nStarting in 2006, agricultural reconstruction was also conducted by Provincial Reconstruction Teams within the occupying military forces.  Intended to promote goodwill and sap the insurgency, \"PRTs\" allowed military commanders to identify local needs and, with few bureaucratic hurdles, to dispense up to $500,000. Civilians from many agencies within the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]], as well as [[USAID]], served tours on PRTs.  Some participants criticized the absence of a national agricultural strategy, or clear direction on the design of projects.  Others complained that projects emphasized \"American-style, 21st-century agricultural technologies and methodologies...\" that were inappropriate for Iraq.<ref>Bernard Carreau, ed. \u201cLessons from USDA in Iraq and Afghanistan,\u201d  ''Prism'' Vol. 1, No. 3, (September 2011): 139.</ref>\n\nAgricultural production has not rebounded noticeably from the reconstruction program.  According to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), between 2002 and 2013, production of wheat increased 11 percent and milled rice 8 percent, but barley had decreased 13 percent and maize 40 percent.  Scaled in \"international dollars\" (2004-2006 base equaling 100) Iraq's per capita food production was 135 in 2002, 96 in 2007, and 94 in 2012.  The agricultural sector shed workers.  In those same years, production per worker was 117, 106, and 130, respectively.<ref>\u201cFAOSTAT Country Profiles:  Iraq.\u201d  [http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/index/en/?iso3=IRQ FAO website]</ref>\n\nThe international [[Oil-for-Food program]] (1997\u20132003) further reduced farm production by supplying artificially priced foreign foodstuffs. The military action of 2003 did little damage to Iraqi agriculture; because of favorable weather conditions, in that year grain production was 22 percent higher than in 2002. Although growth continued in 2004, experts predicted that Iraq will be an importer of agricultural products for the foreseeable future. Long-term plans call for investment in agricultural machinery and materials and more prolific crop varieties\u2014improvements that did not reach Iraq's farmers under the Hussein regime. In 2004 the main agricultural crops were wheat, barley, corn, rice, vegetables, dates, and cotton, and the main livestock outputs were cattle and sheep.\n\nThe [[Agricultural Cooperative Bank of Iraq|Agricultural Cooperative Bank]], capitalized at nearly 1 G$ - by 1984, targets its low-interest, low-collateral loans to private farmers for mechanization, poultry projects, and orchard development. Large modern cattle, [[dairy farming|dairy]], and poultry farms are under construction. Obstacles to agricultural development include labour shortages, inadequate management and maintenance, salinization, [[urbanization|urban migration]], and dislocations resulting from previous land reform and collectivization programs.\n\nIn 2011, an agricultural adviser to the Iraqi government, [[Layth Mahdi]], summarized the forced United States agricultural reconstruction:<blockquote>Prior to 2003, Iraq had imported about 30 percent of its food needs annually. The decline in agricultural production after this period, created the need for importing 90 percent of the food at a cost estimated at more than $12 billion annually. Due to the sudden shift in the agricultural policy from subsidized assistance to an immediate shift to a free market policy, the outcomes led to a decline in production. The observed outcome resulted in many farmers abandoning the land and agriculture. The impact on natural resources results in an exploited and degraded environment leaving the land destitute and the people impoverished, unemployed [and] experiencing a sense of losing their human dignity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.iraq-businessnews.com/2011/06/08/agricultural-production-iraq%E2%80%99s-best-chance-for-restoring-food-security/|title=Agricultural Production: Iraq\u2019s Best Chance for Restoring Food Security|work=Iraq Business News|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en-US}}</ref></blockquote>Importation of foreign workers and increased entry of women into traditionally male labour roles have helped compensate for agricultural and industrial labour shortages exacerbated by the war.

Most of the trees found in that region are not suitable for lumbering. In 2002 a total of 112,000 cubic meters of wood were harvested, nearly half of which was used as fuel.\n\nDespite its many rivers, Iraq's fishing industry has remained relatively small and based largely on marine species in the Persian Gulf. In 2001 the catch was 22,800 tons.\n\nAside from hydrocarbons, Iraq's mining industry has been confined to extraction of relatively small amounts of [[phosphates]] (at [[Akashat]]), salt, and sulfur (near [[Mosul]]). Since a productive period in the 1970s, the mining industry has been hampered by the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] (1980\u201388), the sanctions of the 1990s, and the economic collapse of 2003.\n\n===Energy===\n{{See also|Energy in Iraq|Petroleum industry in Iraq}}\n[[File:Map-of-countries-by-proven-oil-reserves-(in-millions-of-barrels)---2017---US-EIA---Jo-Di-graphics.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A map of world [[oil reserves]] according to U.S. EIA, 2017]]\n\nIraq is one of the most oil-rich countries in the world.

The 17 private banks established during the 1990s were limited to domestic transactions and attracted few private depositors. Those banks and two main state banks were badly damaged by the international embargo of the 1990s. To further privatize and expand the system, in 2003 the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] removed restrictions on international bank transactions and freed the [[Central Bank of Iraq]] (CBI) from government control. In its first year of independent operation, the CBI received credit for limiting Iraq's inflation.

In late 2004, most legitimate jobs were in the government, the army, the oil industry, and security-related enterprises.<ref>{{cite web |title=Iraq Living Conditions Survey 2004 |url=http://www.iq.undp.org/ILCS/labour.htm |website=UNDP in Iraq |publisher=United Nations Development Programme |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051104114450/http://www.iq.undp.org/ILCS/labour.htm |archive-date=2005-11-04}}</ref> Under Saddam Hussein Hussein, many of the highest-paid workers were employed by the greatly overstaffed government, whose overthrow disrupted the input of these people to the economy.

In 2003 oil accounted for about US$7.4 billion of Iraq's total US$7.6 billion of export value, and statistics for earlier years showed similar proportions. After the end of the trade embargo in 2003 expanded the range of exports, oil continued to occupy the dominant position: in 2004 Iraq's export income doubled (to US$16.5 billion), but oil accounted for all but US$340 million (2 percent) of the total. In late 2004, sabotage significantly reduced oil output, and experts forecast that output, hence exports, would be below capacity in 2005 as well. In 2004 the chief export markets were the United States (which accounted for nearly half), Italy, France, Jordan, Canada, and the Netherlands. In 2004 the value of Iraq's imports was US$21.7 billion, incurring a trade deficit of about US$5.2 billion. In 2003 the main sources of Iraq's imports were Turkey, Jordan, Vietnam, the United States, Germany, and Britain. Because of Iraq's inactive manufacturing sector, the range of imports was quite large, including food, fuels, medicines, and manufactured goods. By 2010, exports rose to US$50.8 billion and imports rose to US$45.2 billion.  Chief 2009 export partners were: U.S., India, Italy, South Korea, Taiwan, China, Netherlands, and Japan. Chief 2009 import partners were: Turkey, Syria, U.S., China, Jordan, Italy, and Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/6804.htm|title=Iraq|work=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{dmoz|Regional/Middle_East/Iraq/Business_and_Economy/Economic_Development|Iraq Economic Development}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091219131236/http://www.iauiraq.org/ Iraq Inter-Agency Information & Analysis Unit] Reports, Maps and Assessments of Iraq from the UN Inter-Agency Information & Analysis Unit\n*[http://www.oilandgasinfrastructure.com/home/oilandgasmiddleeast/iraq Map of Iraq's oil and gas infrastructure]\n\n{{Iraq topics}}\n{{Asia topic|Economy of}}\n{{OPEC}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Iraq, Economy of}}\n[[Category:Economy of Iraq| ]]\n[[Category:Economy of the Arab League]]\n[[Category:OPEC]]\n[[Category:Economy of the Middle East]]\n", "name_user": "80.6.153.22", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Iraq"}

In France, ''caf\u00e9 latte'' is mostly known from the original Italian name of the drink (caff\u00e8 latte or caffelatte); a combination of espresso and steamed milk equivalent to a \"latte\" is in French called ''grand cr\u00e8me'' and in German ''Milchkaffee'' or (in Austria) ''[[Wiener Melange]]''.\n\nVariants include the chocolate-flavored [[Caff\u00e8 mocha|mocha]] or replacing the coffee with another drink base such as [[masala chai]] (spiced Indian tea), [[Mate (drink)|mate]], [[matcha]], [[turmeric]] or [[rooibos]]; other types of milk, such as [[soy milk]] or [[almond milk]], are also used.\n\n==Origin and history==\n[[File:Latte at Doppio Ristretto Chiang Mai 01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Latte art]]]]\nCoffee and milk have been part of [[European cuisine]] since the 17th century. ''Caff\u00e8 e latte'', ''Milchkaffee'', ''caf\u00e9 au lait'' and ''caf\u00e9 con leche'' are domestic terms of traditional ways of drinking coffee, usually as part of breakfast in the home. Public caf\u00e9s in Europe and the US seem to have no mention of the terms until the 20th century, although ''Kapuziner'' is mentioned in Austrian coffee houses in [[Vienna]] and [[Trieste]] in the 2nd half of 1700s as \"coffee with cream, spices and sugar\" (being the origin of the Italian [[cappuccino]]).\n\nAccording to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the term ''caff\u00e8 e latte'' was first used in English in 1867 by [[William Dean Howells]] in his essay \"Italian Journeys\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00333261?query_type=word&queryword=latte&first=1&max_to_show=10&single=1&sort_type=alpha|title=Latte|edition=new online|work=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2011-11-22}}</ref> Kenneth Davids maintains that \"...breakfast drinks of this kind have existed in Europe for generations, but the (commercial) caff\u00e8 version of this drink is an American invention\".<ref name=\"Davids2001\">{{cite book|last=Davids|first=Kenneth|title=Coffee: A Guide to Buying, Brewing, and Enjoying, Fifth Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IqJsIcYOPcQC&pg=PA153|accessdate=18 January 2014|date=2001-05-04|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-24665-5|pages=153\u2013}}</ref>{{dubious|date=October 2018}} The [[French language|French]] term ''caf\u00e9 au lait'' was used in caf\u00e9s in several countries in western continental Europe from 1900 onward, while the French themselves started using the term ''caf\u00e9 cr\u00e8me'' for coffee with milk or cream.\n\nThe [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian-Hungarian empire]] (Central Europe) had its own terminology for the coffees being served in coffee houses, while in German homes it was still called ''Milchkaffee''. The Italians used the term ''caff\u00e8 latte'' domestically, but it is not known from caf\u00e9s like ''Florian'' in [[Venice]] or any other coffee houses or places where coffee was served publicly. Even when the Italian espresso bar culture bloomed in the years after WW2 both in Italy, and in cities like Vienna and London, ''[[espresso]]'' and ''cappuccino'' are the terms, ''latte'' is missing on coffee menus.\n\nIn Italian ''latte'' ({{IPA-it|\u02c8latte|pron}}) means \"[[milk]]\"\u2014so ordering a \"latte\" in Italy will get the customer a glass of milk.<ref>{{cite book|title=Espresso coffee|author-link=David Schomer|first=David|last=Schomer|edition=second|page=151|isbn=1-59404-031-1}}.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msadventuresinitaly.com/blog/2007/07/11/how-to-order-an-italian-coffee-in-italy/|title=Coffee traditions in Italy|publisher=Ms adventures in Italy|date=2007-07-11|accessdate=2011-11-22}}</ref>\n\nIn Spanish the phrase ''caf\u00e9 con leche'' (coffee with milk) is used, which is by default served in a medium or large cup whereas the similar ''cortado'' (coffee with less milk) is served in a small cup.\n\nIn English-speaking countries ''latte'' is shorthand for ''caffelatte'' or ''caffellatte'' (from ''caff\u00e8 e latte'', \"coffee and milk\"), which is similar to the French ''[[caf\u00e9 au lait]]'', the Spanish ''[[caf\u00e9 con leche]]'', the [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''caf\u00e8 amb llet'' or the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''[[gal\u00e3o]].''\n\nThe [[Caffe Mediterraneum]] in [[Berkeley, California]] claims Lino Meiorin, one of its early owners, \"invented\" and \"made the latte a standard drink\" in the 1950s.

''Caff\u00e8 latte'' started replacing this term around 1996\u201397, but both names exist side by side, more often more similar than different in preparation.\n\n==Spelling variations==\nCoffee menus worldwide use a number of spelling variations for words to indicate coffee and milk, often using incorrect accents or a combination of French and Italian terms. Italian is ''caffellatte'' (the standard form; ''caffelatte'' is a Northern Italian variation), contracted from ''caff\u00e8 latte'' (with a [[grave accent]] over the e), while French is ''caf\u00e9 au lait'' (with an [[acute accent]]); Spanish is ''caf\u00e9 con leche'' and Portuguese is ''caf\u00e9 com leite''. Variants such as ''caf\u00e9 latte'', ''caf\u00e9 latt\u00e9'' and ''caf\u00e9 latt\u00e8'' are commonly seen in English. A slang name for a caff\u00e8 latte is a 'lartay', although this spelling is considered informal and, in many places, impolite and disrespectful to Italian culture.\n\n==Current use==\n[[File:Caffe-Latte-Prague.JPG|thumb|Caff\u00e8 latte with latte art]]\nIn Italy, caff\u00e8 latte is almost always prepared at home, for breakfast only. The coffee is brewed with a stovetop [[moka pot]] and poured into a cup containing heated milk. (Unlike the 'international' latte drink, the milk in the Italian original is generally not foamed, and sugar is added by the drinker, if at all).\n\nOutside Italy, a caff\u00e8 latte is typically prepared in a {{convert|240|mL|usoz|0|abbr=on}} glass or cup with one standard shot of [[espresso]] (either single, {{convert|30|mL|usoz|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}, or double, {{convert|60|mL|usoz|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and filled with steamed milk, with a layer of foamed milk approximately {{convert|12|mm|in|abbr=on|frac=4}} thick on the top. In the US, a latte is often heavily sweetened, with 3% or even more sugar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starbucks.com/menu/drinks/espresso/caffe-latte|title=Caff\u00e8 Latte|work=starbucks.com}}</ref>\n[[File:A cup of latte with lunch at Merewether Beach,Australia.jpeg|thumb|A cup of latte with lunch at Merewether Beach, Australia]]\nThe drink is related to a [[cappuccino]], the difference being that a cappuccino consists of espresso and steamed milk with a {{convert|20|mm}} thick layer of milk foam. A variant found in Australia and New Zealand similar to the latte is the [[flat white]], which is served in a smaller ceramic cup with the micro-foamed milk.

In a latte macchiato, espresso is added to milk, rather than the reverse, and caff\u00e8 lattes have a stronger coffee flavour.\n\nThe latte macchiato is milk steamed to [[microfoam]], served in a glass with a half shot of [[espresso]] poured gently through the foamy top layer, creating a layered drink with a \"macchia\"\u2014a spot\u2014of espresso on the top. As with a [[caff\u00e8 macchiato]], which is espresso with a spot of milk atop, indicating there is a hint of milk underneath the espresso foam, a latte macchiato is the opposite, to indicate there is espresso in the milk.\n\nThe use of the term 'macchiato' has been widened to include a huge array of beverages and ice creams. In some countries (such as Germany), latte macchiato is the preferred term. The word \"macchiato\" itself is Italian for \"stained\" which refers to creating a coffee or milk \"stain\" in the drink.\n\nAlthough the term macchiato has been used to describe various types of espresso drinks, a caff\u00e8 macchiato is 3/4 espresso and 1/4 steamed milk. A caff\u00e8 macchiato is about {{convert|60|-|90|mL|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} and is usually served in a demi tasse. Although a traditional macchiato is small, there are still ways to pour art into the crema of drink. The only difference between pouring latte art and macchiato art is that for a macchiato, the milk has to be poured faster and through a much smaller stream.\n\n==Serving styles==\n[[File:Matcha Latte KF.JPG|thumb|A cup of latte made with matcha, called green tea latte.

In France, ''caf\u00e9 latte'' is mostly known from the original Italian name of the drink (caff\u00e8 latte or caffelatte); a combination of espresso and steamed milk equivalent to a \"latte\" is in French called ''grand cr\u00e8me'' and in German ''Milchkaffee'' or (in Austria) ''[[Wiener Melange]]''.\n\nVariants include the chocolate-flavored [[Caff\u00e8 mocha|mocha]] or replacing the coffee with another drink base such as [[masala chai]] (spiced Indian tea), [[Mate (drink)|mate]], [[matcha]], [[turmeric]] or [[rooibos]]; other types of milk, such as [[soy milk]] or [[almond milk]], are also used.\n\n==Origin and history==\n[[File:Latte at Doppio Ristretto Chiang Mai 01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Latte art]]]]\nCoffee and milk have been part of [[European cuisine]] since the 17th century. ''Caff\u00e8 e latte'', ''Milchkaffee'', ''caf\u00e9 au lait'' and ''caf\u00e9 con leche'' are domestic terms of traditional ways of drinking coffee, usually as part of breakfast in the home. Public caf\u00e9s in Europe and the US seem to have no mention of the terms until the 20th century, although ''Kapuziner'' is mentioned in Austrian coffee houses in [[Vienna]] and [[Trieste]] in the 2nd half of 1700s as \"coffee with cream, spices and sugar\" (being the origin of the Italian [[cappuccino]]).\n\nAccording to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the term ''caff\u00e8 e latte'' was first used in English in 1867 by [[William Dean Howells]] in his essay \"Italian Journeys\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00333261?query_type=word&queryword=latte&first=1&max_to_show=10&single=1&sort_type=alpha|title=Latte|edition=new online|work=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2011-11-22}}</ref> Kenneth Davids maintains that \"...breakfast drinks of this kind have existed in Europe for generations, but the (commercial) caff\u00e8 version of this drink is an American invention\".<ref name=\"Davids2001\">{{cite book|last=Davids|first=Kenneth|title=Coffee: A Guide to Buying, Brewing, and Enjoying, Fifth Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IqJsIcYOPcQC&pg=PA153|accessdate=18 January 2014|date=2001-05-04|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-24665-5|pages=153\u2013}}</ref>{{dubious|date=October 2018}} The [[French language|French]] term ''caf\u00e9 au lait'' was used in caf\u00e9s in several countries in western continental Europe from 1900 onward, while the French themselves started using the term ''caf\u00e9 cr\u00e8me'' for coffee with milk or cream.\n\nThe [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian-Hungarian empire]] (Central Europe) had its own terminology for the coffees being served in coffee houses, while in German homes it was still called ''Milchkaffee''. The Italians used the term ''caff\u00e8 latte'' domestically, but it is not known from caf\u00e9s like ''Florian'' in [[Venice]] or any other coffee houses or places where coffee was served publicly. Even when the Italian espresso bar culture bloomed in the years after WW2 both in Italy, and in cities like Vienna and London, ''[[espresso]]'' and ''cappuccino'' are the terms, ''latte'' is missing on coffee menus.\n\nIn Italian ''latte'' ({{IPA-it|\u02c8latte|pron}}) means \"[[milk]]\"\u2014so ordering a \"latte\" in Italy will get the customer a glass of milk.<ref>{{cite book|title=Espresso coffee|author-link=David Schomer|first=David|last=Schomer|edition=second|page=151|isbn=1-59404-031-1}}.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msadventuresinitaly.com/blog/2007/07/11/how-to-order-an-italian-coffee-in-italy/|title=Coffee traditions in Italy|publisher=Ms adventures in Italy|date=2007-07-11|accessdate=2011-11-22}}</ref>\n\nIn Spanish the phrase ''caf\u00e9 con leche'' (coffee with milk) is used, which is by default served in a medium or large cup whereas the similar ''cortado'' (coffee with less milk) is served in a small cup.\n\nIn English-speaking countries ''latte'' is shorthand for ''caffelatte'' or ''caffellatte'' (from ''caff\u00e8 e latte'', \"coffee and milk\"), which is similar to the French ''[[caf\u00e9 au lait]]'', the Spanish ''[[caf\u00e9 con leche]]'', the [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''caf\u00e8 amb llet'' or the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''[[gal\u00e3o]].''\n\nThe [[Caffe Mediterraneum]] in [[Berkeley, California]] claims Lino Meiorin, one of its early owners, \"invented\" and \"made the latte a standard drink\" in the 1950s.

''Caff\u00e8 latte'' started replacing this term around 1996\u201397, but both names exist side by side, more often more similar than different in preparation.\n\n==Spelling variations==\nCoffee menus worldwide use a number of spelling variations for words to indicate coffee and milk, often using incorrect accents or a combination of French and Italian terms. Italian is ''caffellatte'' (the standard form; ''caffelatte'' is a Northern Italian variation), contracted from ''caff\u00e8 latte'' (with a [[grave accent]] over the e), while French is ''caf\u00e9 au lait'' (with an [[acute accent]]); Spanish is ''caf\u00e9 con leche'' and Portuguese is ''caf\u00e9 com leite''. Variants such as ''caf\u00e9 latte'', ''caf\u00e9 latt\u00e9'' and ''caf\u00e9 latt\u00e8'' are commonly seen in English. A slang name for a caff\u00e8 latte is a 'lartay', although this spelling is considered informal and, in many places, impolite and disrespectful to Italian culture.\n\n==Current use==\n[[File:Caffe-Latte-Prague.JPG|thumb|Caff\u00e8 latte with latte art]]\nIn Italy, caff\u00e8 latte is almost always prepared at home, for breakfast only. The coffee is brewed with a stovetop [[moka pot]] and poured into a cup containing heated milk. (Unlike the 'international' latte drink, the milk in the Italian original is generally not foamed, and sugar is added by the drinker, if at all).\n\nOutside Italy, a caff\u00e8 latte is typically prepared in a {{convert|240|mL|usoz|0|abbr=on}} glass or cup with one standard shot of [[espresso]] (either single, {{convert|30|mL|usoz|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}, or double, {{convert|60|mL|usoz|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and filled with steamed milk, with a layer of foamed milk approximately {{convert|12|mm|in|abbr=on|frac=4}} thick on the top. In the US, a latte is often heavily sweetened, with 3% or even more sugar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starbucks.com/menu/drinks/espresso/caffe-latte|title=Caff\u00e8 Latte|work=starbucks.com}}</ref>\n[[File:A cup of latte with lunch at Merewether Beach,Australia.jpeg|thumb|A cup of latte with lunch at Merewether Beach, Australia]]\nThe drink is related to a [[cappuccino]], the difference being that a cappuccino consists of espresso and steamed milk with a {{convert|20|mm}} thick layer of milk foam. A variant found in Australia and New Zealand similar to the latte is the [[flat white]], which is served in a smaller ceramic cup with the micro-foamed milk. In the United States this beverage is sometimes referred to as a wet cappuccino.\n\n==Iced latte==\nIn the United States, an iced latte is usually espresso and chilled milk poured over ice.<ref name=starbucksicedlatte>{{cite web|title=Iced Caff\u00e8 Latte|url=http://www.starbucks.com/menu/drinks/espresso/iced-caffe-latte?foodZone=9999|work=Starbucks.com|accessdate=19 May 2014}}</ref> Unlike a hot latte, it does not usually contain steamed milk or foam.<ref>{{cite book|title=Coffee Cafe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6gwestJTfT8C&lpg=PA83&pg=PA83#v=onepage&f=false|first=Sherri|last=Johns|publisher=New Holland Publishers|year=2005|isbn=978-1-84537-037-4}}</ref> Iced lattes often have sugar or flavoring syrups added, though purists prefer them to consist simply of coffee and milk; they are always served blended with ice.<ref name=Laskin>{{cite book|last=Laskin|first=Avner|title=Coffee: More Than 65 Delicious & Healthy Recipes|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4027-4937-7|page=46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TB_Xu-SkJXQC&lpg=PA4&pg=PA46#v=onepage&f=false}}</ref> The espresso can be pre-chilled (sometimes as a mixture of espresso and milk) or frozen in advance to avoid warming up the drink.<ref name=moore>{{cite book|pages=144\u2013145|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WbLa7xGXxeIC&lpg=PA144&pg=PA144#v=onepage&f=false|last=Moore|first=Victoria|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|date=Apr 22, 2010|isbn=978-0-7407-9845-0|title=How to Drink}}</ref>\n\n==Caff\u00e8 latte vs. latte macchiato==\n[[File:Latte macchiato with coffee beans.jpg|thumb|left|140px|A glass of latte macchiato]]\nA caff\u00e8 latte differs from a [[latte macchiato]]. In a latte macchiato, espresso is added to milk, rather than the reverse, and caff\u00e8 lattes have a stronger coffee flavour.\n\nThe latte macchiato is milk steamed to [[microfoam]], served in a glass with a half shot of [[espresso]] poured gently through the foamy top layer, creating a layered drink with a \"macchia\"\u2014a spot\u2014of espresso on the top. As with a [[caff\u00e8 macchiato]], which is espresso with a spot of milk atop, indicating there is a hint of milk underneath the espresso foam, a latte macchiato is the opposite, to indicate there is espresso in the milk.\n\nThe use of the term 'macchiato' has been widened to include a huge array of beverages and ice creams. In some countries (such as Germany), latte macchiato is the preferred term. The word \"macchiato\" itself is Italian for \"stained\" which refers to creating a coffee or milk \"stain\" in the drink.\n\nAlthough the term macchiato has been used to describe various types of espresso drinks, a caff\u00e8 macchiato is 3/4 espresso and 1/4 steamed milk. A caff\u00e8 macchiato is about {{convert|60|-|90|mL|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} and is usually served in a demi tasse. Although a traditional macchiato is small, there are still ways to pour art into the crema of drink. The only difference between pouring latte art and macchiato art is that for a macchiato, the milk has to be poured faster and through a much smaller stream.\n\n==Serving styles==\n[[File:Matcha Latte KF.JPG|thumb|A cup of latte made with matcha, called green tea latte. Popular variation of latte found in Asian countries.]]\n*In some establishments, lattes are served in a glass on a saucer with a napkin to hold the (sometimes hot) glass.\n*A latte is sometimes served in a bowl; in Europe, particularly Scandinavia, this is referred to as a [[caf\u00e9 au lait]].\n*Increasingly common in the United States and Europe, [[latte art]] has led to the stylization of coffee making, and the creation of which is now a popular art form. Created by pouring steaming, and mostly frothed, milk into the coffee, that liquid is introduced into the beverage in such a way that patterns are distinguishable on the top of coffee. Popular patterns can include hearts, flowers, trees and other forms of simplistic representations of images and objects.\n*Iced latte is often served unstirred so that coffee appears to \"float\" on top of white milk in a glass cup.\n*A variation of the iced latte, known as the \"bootleg latte\", \"ghetto latte\", or \"poor man's latte\",<ref>Charles Leroux. 2006.
