{"title_page": "List of paintings by Hieronymus Bosch", "text_new": "[[Image:J. Bosch Adoration of the Magi Triptych (detail 3).jpg|thumb|right|Bosch's signature from the triptych ''Adoration of the Magi''. Only a few of the surviving paintings by the master are signed.]]\nThis article lists '''paintings by [[Hieronymus Bosch]]''', as well as paintings attributed to him or his school. For Bosch's drawings, see [[Hieronymus Bosch drawings]]. Since the precise chronology of Bosch's works is currently impossible to establish, paintings within sections are sorted alphabetically. The recent very thorough investigation by [http://boschproject.org/ The Bosch Research and Conservation Project] of a multitude of Bosch's paintings included dendrochronological research and made an approximate dating of the paintings possible. The findings of this investigation were published in a book in 2016.<ref>Luuk Hoogstede, Ron Spronk, Robert G. Erdmann, Rik Klein Gotink, Matthijs Ilsink, Jos Koldeweij, Hanneke Nap, and Daan Veldhuizen, Hieronymus Bosch, Painter and Draughtsman \u2013 Technical Studies, Yale University Press, New Haven, 2016.\n</ref> All dates given below are taken from this reference. The book describes the other findings of the investigation as well, such as painting technique, layer structure and pigment analyses. Illustrated pigment analyses of Bosch's paintings can also be found at ColourLex.<ref>[http://colourlex.com/ ColourLex: Art and Science]</ref>\n\nBosch's works are generally organized into three periods of his life dealing with the early works ({{circa|1470\u20131485}}), the middle period ({{circa|1485\u20131500}}), and the late period ({{circa|1500}} until his death). According to Stefan Fischer, thirteen of Bosch's surviving paintings were completed in the late period, with seven surviving paintings attributed to his middle period.<ref>Stefan Fischer. ''Bosch: The Complete Works.''</ref> Bosch's early period is studied in terms of his workshop activity and possibly some of his drawings. There are no surviving paintings attributed to before 1485.\n\nExamples of Bosch's work can be found in Austria, Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Serbia, Spain, the UK, and the US.\n\n==Triptychs==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;border:0px;text-align:left;line-height:150%;\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! width=250px class=\"unsortable\"| Image\n! class=\"unsortable\"| Details\n|-\n| [[Image:Hieronymus Bosch - Triptych of the Adoration of the Magi - WGA2606.jpg|Adoration of the Magi|250px]]\n| \n: '''''[[The Epiphany (Bosch triptych)|Adoration of the Magi]]'''''\n: {{circa|1491\u20131498}}\n: Oil on wood\n: 138 \u00d7 144 cm\n: Museo del Prado, Madrid, Spain\n: &nbsp;\n: The outer panels form a single image, '''''Saint Gregory's Mass''''', rendered in grisaille.\n|-\n| [[File:Hieronymus Bosch 062.jpg|Outside of Adoration of the Magi|150px]]\n| \n: '''''[[Saint Gregory's Mass]]'''''\n: {{circa|1491\u20131498}}\n: Oil on wood\n: 138 \u00d7 144 cm\n: Museo del Prado, Madrid, Spain \n: &nbsp;\n: The outer panels form a single image, '''''Saint Gregory's Mass''''', rendered in grisaille.\n|-\n| [[Image:El jard\u00edn de las Delicias, de El Bosco.jpg|The Garden of Earthly Delights|250px]]\n| \n: '''''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'''''\n: {{circa|1495\u20131505}}\n: Oil on wood\n: 220 \u00d7 389 cm\n: Museo del Prado, Madrid, Spain\n: &nbsp;\n: The outer panels form a single image, '''''The Creation of the World''''', rendered in grisaille.\n|-\n| [[File:Hieronymus Bosch - The Garden of Earthly Delights - The exterior (shutters).jpg|Outside panels of The Garden of Earthly Delights|250px]]\n| \n: '''''[[The Creation of the World]]'''''\n: {{circa|1495\u20131505}}\n: Oil on wood\n: 220 \u00d7 389 cm\n: Museo del Prado, Madrid, Spain \n: &nbsp;\n: The outer panels form a single image, '''''The Creation of the World''''', rendered in grisaille\n|-\n| [[Image:Hieronymus Bosch - Hermit Saints Triptych.jpg|Hermit Saints Triptych|250px]]\n| \n: '''''[[The Hermit Saints|Hermit Saints Triptych]]'''''\n: {{circa|1495\u20131505}}\n: Oil on wood\n: 86 \u00d7 100 cm\n: Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice\n|-\n| [[Image:Bosch laatste oordeel drieluik.jpg|The Last Judgment|250px]]\n| \n: '''''[[The Last Judgment (Bosch triptych, Bruges)|The Last Judgment]]'''''\n: {{circa|1495\u20131505}}\n: Oil on wood\n: 99.5 \u00d7 117.5 cm\n: [[Groeningemuseum]], Bruges, Belgium\n: &nbsp;\n: Attributed to Bosch and/or his workshop.

For Bosch's drawings, see [[Hieronymus Bosch drawings]]. Since the precise chronology of Bosch's works is currently impossible to establish, paintings within sections are sorted alphabetically. The recent very thorough investigation by [http://boschproject.org/ The Bosch Research and Conservation Project] of a multitude of Bosch's paintings included dendrochronological research and made an approximate dating of the paintings possible. The findings of this investigation were published in a book in 2016.<ref>Luuk Hoogstede, Ron Spronk, Robert G. Erdmann, Rik Klein Gotink, Matthijs Ilsink, Jos Koldeweij, Hanneke Nap, and Daan Veldhuizen, Hieronymus Bosch, Painter and Draughtsman \u2013 Technical Studies, Yale University Press, New Haven, 2016.\n</ref> All dates given below are taken from this reference. The book describes the other findings of the investigation as well, such as painting technique, layer structure and pigment analyses. Illustrated pigment analyses of Bosch's paintings can also be found at ColourLex.<ref>[http://colourlex.com/ ColourLex: Art and Science]</ref>\n\nBosch's works are generally organized into three periods of his life dealing with the early works ({{circa|1470\u20131485}}), the middle period ({{circa|1485\u20131500}}), and the late period ({{circa|1500}} until his death). According to Stefan Fischer, thirteen of Bosch's surviving paintings were completed in the late period, with seven surviving paintings attributed to his middle period.<ref>Stefan Fischer. ''Bosch: The Complete Works.''</ref> Bosch's early period is studied in terms of his workshop activity and possibly some of his drawings. There are no surviving paintings attributed to before 1485.\n\nExamples of Bosch's work can be found in Austria, Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Serbia, Spain, the UK, and the US.\n\n==Triptychs==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;border:0px;text-align:left;line-height:150%;\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! width=250px class=\"unsortable\"| Image\n! class=\"unsortable\"| Details\n|-\n| [[Image:Hieronymus Bosch - Triptych of the Adoration of the Magi - WGA2606.jpg|Adoration of the Magi|250px]]\n| \n: '''''[[The Epiphany (Bosch triptych)|Adoration of the Magi]]'''''\n: {{circa|1491\u20131498}}\n: Oil on wood\n: 138 \u00d7 144 cm\n: Museo del Prado, Madrid, Spain\n: &nbsp;\n: The outer panels form a single image, '''''Saint Gregory's Mass''''', rendered in grisaille.\n|-\n| [[File:Hieronymus Bosch 062.jpg|Outside of Adoration of the Magi|150px]]\n| \n: '''''[[Saint Gregory's Mass]]'''''\n: {{circa|1491\u20131498}}\n: Oil on wood\n: 138 \u00d7 144 cm\n: Museo del Prado, Madrid, Spain \n: &nbsp;\n: The outer panels form a single image, '''''Saint Gregory's Mass''''', rendered in grisaille.\n|-\n| [[Image:El jard\u00edn de las Delicias, de El Bosco.jpg|The Garden of Earthly Delights|250px]]\n| \n: '''''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'''''\n: {{circa|1495\u20131505}}\n: Oil on wood\n: 220 \u00d7 389 cm\n: Museo del Prado, Madrid, Spain\n: &nbsp;\n: The outer panels form a single image, '''''The Creation of the World''''', rendered in grisaille.\n|-\n| [[File:Hieronymus Bosch - The Garden of Earthly Delights - The exterior (shutters).jpg|Outside panels of The Garden of Earthly Delights|250px]]\n| \n: '''''[[The Creation of the World]]'''''\n: {{circa|1495\u20131505}}\n: Oil on wood\n: 220 \u00d7 389 cm\n: Museo del Prado, Madrid, Spain \n: &nbsp;\n: The outer panels form a single image, '''''The Creation of the World''''', rendered in grisaille\n|-\n| [[Image:Hieronymus Bosch - Hermit Saints Triptych.jpg|Hermit Saints Triptych|250px]]\n| \n: '''''[[The Hermit Saints|Hermit Saints Triptych]]'''''\n: {{circa|1495\u20131505}}\n: Oil on wood\n: 86 \u00d7 100 cm\n: Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice\n|-\n| [[Image:Bosch laatste oordeel drieluik.jpg|The Last Judgment|250px]]\n| \n: '''''[[The Last Judgment (Bosch triptych, Bruges)|The Last Judgment]]'''''\n: {{circa|1495\u20131505}}\n: Oil on wood\n: 99.5 \u00d7 117.5 cm\n: [[Groeningemuseum]], Bruges, Belgium\n: &nbsp;\n: Attributed to Bosch and/or his workshop.

The [[Janowska concentration camp]] near [[Lwow]] (now Lviv) in occupied eastern Poland implemented a selection process. Some prisoners were assigned to work before death.

Despite the lethal effects of carbon monoxide, this was seen as unsuitable for use in the East due to the cost of transporting the carbon monoxide in cylinders.<ref name = \"warning\"/>\n\nEach extermination camp operated differently, yet each had designs for quick and efficient industrialized killing. While H\u00f6ss was away on an official journey in late August 1941 his deputy, [[Karl Fritzsch]], tested out an idea. At Auschwitz clothes infested with lice were treated with crystallised prussic acid. The crystals were made to order by the [[IG Farben]] chemicals company for which the brand name was Zyklon-B. Once released from their container, Zyklon-B crystals in the air released a lethal cyanide gas. Fritzsch tried out the effect of [[Zyklon B]] on Soviet POWs, who were locked up in cells in the basement of the bunker for this experiment. H\u00f6ss on his return was briefed and impressed with the results and this became the camp strategy for extermination as it was also to be at Majdanek. Besides gassing, the camp guards continued killing prisoners via mass shooting, starvation, torture, etc.<ref>{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Borkin|title=The Crime and Punishment of IG Farben|url=https://archive.org/details/crimepunishmento0000bork|url-access=registration|location=New York City|publisher=Free Press|year=1978|isbn=978-0-02-904630-2}}</ref>\n\n=== Gassings ===\n{{See also|The Holocaust#Gas chambers|Gas chamber#Nazi Germany|Criticism of Holocaust denial#Use of gas chambers}}\nSS ''[[Obersturmf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Kurt Gerstein]], of the Institute for Hygiene of the Waffen-SS, told a Swedish diplomat during the war of life in a death camp.

The \"difficult\" prisoners were led to a site out of view to be killed off discreetly.\n\nA prisoner ''[[Sonderkommando]]'' (Special Detachment) effected in the processes of extermination; they encouraged the Jews to undress without a hint of what was about to happen. They accompanied them into the gas chambers outfitted to appear as shower rooms (with nonworking water nozzles, and tile walls); and remained with the victims until just before the chamber door closed. To psychologically maintain the \"calming effect\" of the delousing deception, an SS man stood at the door until the end. The ''Sonderkommando'' talked to the victims about life in the camp to pacify the suspicious ones, and hurried them inside; to that effect, they also assisted the aged and the very young in undressing.<ref>H\u00f6ss, pp. 164\u2013165, 321\u2013322.</ref>\n\nTo further persuade the prisoners that nothing harmful was happening, the ''Sonderkommando'' deceived them with small talk about friends or relations who had arrived in earlier transports. Many young mothers hid their infants beneath their piled clothes fearing that the delousing \"disinfectant\" might harm them. Camp Commandant H\u00f6ss reported that the \"men of the Special Detachment were particularly on the look-out for this\", and encouraged the women to take their children into the \"shower room\". Likewise, the ''Sonderkommando'' comforted older children who might cry \"because of the strangeness of being undressed in this fashion\".<ref>H\u00f6ss, pp. 164\u2013165, 322\u2013323.</ref>\n\nYet, not every prisoner was deceived by such [[psychological warfare|psychological]] tactics; Commandant H\u00f6ss spoke of Jews \"who either guessed, or knew, what awaited them, nevertheless&nbsp;...

A notable difference with the Usta\u0161e camps as compared to the German ''SS'' camps was the widespread use of manual methods in the mass killings. These involved instruments such as mallets and agricultural knives which were often used in a manner where victims were thrown off the end of a ramp into the Sava River while they were still alive .\n\nThe estimates for the [[Jadovno concentration camp]] generally offer a range of 10,000 \u2013 72,000 deaths at the camp over a period of 122 days (May to August 1941).<ref name=\"USHMM-J\">[http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/jasenovac/ US Holocaust Memorial Museum: Jasenovac] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030802193350/http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/jasenovac/ |date=2 August 2003 }}</ref> Most commonly Jadovno victims were bound together in a line and the first few victims were murdered with rifle butts or other objects.

While H\u00f6ss was away on an official journey in late August 1941 his deputy, [[Karl Fritzsch]], tested out an idea. At Auschwitz clothes infested with lice were treated with crystallised prussic acid. The crystals were made to order by the [[IG Farben]] chemicals company for which the brand name was Zyklon-B. Once released from their container, Zyklon-B crystals in the air released a lethal cyanide gas.

The rest were marched naked to the gas chambers, where:\n\n{{quote|''Unterscharf\u00fchrer'' [[Lorenz Hackenholt|Hackenholt]] was making great efforts to get the engine running. But it doesn't go.

They can be heard weeping, \"like in the synagogue\", says Professor Pfannenstiel, his eyes glued to a window in the wooden door.

The \"difficult\" prisoners were led to a site out of view to be killed off discreetly.\n\nA prisoner ''[[Sonderkommando]]'' (Special Detachment) effected in the processes of extermination; they encouraged the Jews to undress without a hint of what was about to happen. They accompanied them into the gas chambers outfitted to appear as shower rooms (with nonworking water nozzles, and tile walls); and remained with the victims until just before the chamber door closed. To psychologically maintain the \"calming effect\" of the delousing deception, an SS man stood at the door until the end. The ''Sonderkommando'' talked to the victims about life in the camp to pacify the suspicious ones, and hurried them inside; to that effect, they also assisted the aged and the very young in undressing.<ref>H\u00f6ss, pp. 164\u2013165, 321\u2013322.</ref>\n\nTo further persuade the prisoners that nothing harmful was happening, the ''Sonderkommando'' deceived them with small talk about friends or relations who had arrived in earlier transports. Many young mothers hid their infants beneath their piled clothes fearing that the delousing \"disinfectant\" might harm them. Camp Commandant H\u00f6ss reported that the \"men of the Special Detachment were particularly on the look-out for this\", and encouraged the women to take their children into the \"shower room\". Likewise, the ''Sonderkommando'' comforted older children who might cry \"because of the strangeness of being undressed in this fashion\".<ref>H\u00f6ss, pp. 164\u2013165, 322\u2013323.</ref>\n\nYet, not every prisoner was deceived by such [[psychological warfare|psychological]] tactics; Commandant H\u00f6ss spoke of Jews \"who either guessed, or knew, what awaited them, nevertheless&nbsp;... [they] found the courage to joke with the children, to encourage them, despite the mortal terror visible in their own eyes\". Some women would suddenly \"give the most terrible shrieks while undressing, or tear their hair, or scream like maniacs\"; the ''Sonderkommando'' immediately took them away for execution by shooting.<ref>H\u00f6ss, p. 323.</ref> In such circumstances, others, meaning to save themselves at the gas chamber's threshold, betrayed the identities and \"revealed the addresses of those members of their race still in hiding\".<ref>H\u00f6ss, p. 324.</ref>\n\nOnce the door of the filled gas chamber was sealed, pellets of [[Zyklon B]] were dropped through special holes in the roof. Regulations required that the Camp Commandant supervise the preparations, the gassing (through a peephole), and the aftermath looting of the corpses. Commandant H\u00f6ss reported that the gassed victims \"showed no signs of convulsion\"; the Auschwitz camp physicians attributed that to the \"paralyzing effect on the lungs\" of the Zyklon-B gas, which killed ''before'' the victim began suffering convulsions.<ref>H\u00f6ss, pp. 320, 328.</ref>\n{{multiple image | align=right | direction=horizontal\n| image1  = Remains of Crematorium II Birkenau.jpg\n| width1  = 210\n| caption1 = The remnants of \"Crematorium II\" used in Auschwitz-Birkenau between March 1943 and its destruction by the [[Schutzstaffel]] on 20 January 1945\n| image2  = Crematorium at Auschwitz I 2012.jpg\n| width2  = 230\n| caption2 = Fifty-two crematorium ovens, including these, were used to burn the bodies of up to 6,000 people every 24 hours during the operation of Auschwitz-Birkenau gas chambers.<ref name=\"USHMM/Gassing\">{{cite web | url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005220 | title=Gassing Operations | publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum | work=The means of mass murder at Auschwitz | date=20 June 2014 | accessdate=12 July 2015 | author=Holocaust Encyclopedia}}</ref>}}\n\nAs a matter of political training, some high-ranked [[Nazi Party]] leaders and SS officers were sent to Auschwitz\u2013Birkenau to witness the gassings; H\u00f6ss reported that, \"all were deeply impressed by what they saw&nbsp;...

The Jasenovac guards were also reported to have cremated living inmates in the crematorium. A notable difference with the Usta\u0161e camps as compared to the German ''SS'' camps was the widespread use of manual methods in the mass killings. These involved instruments such as mallets and agricultural knives which were often used in a manner where victims were thrown off the end of a ramp into the Sava River while they were still alive .\n\nThe estimates for the [[Jadovno concentration camp]] generally offer a range of 10,000 \u2013 72,000 deaths at the camp over a period of 122 days (May to August 1941).<ref name=\"USHMM-J\">[http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/jasenovac/ US Holocaust Memorial Museum: Jasenovac] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030802193350/http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/jasenovac/ |date=2 August 2003 }}</ref> Most commonly Jadovno victims were bound together in a line and the first few victims were murdered with rifle butts or other objects.
