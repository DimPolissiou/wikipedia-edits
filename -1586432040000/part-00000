This was a response to public concern over the increase in the number of mixed-descent children and sexual exploitation of young Aboriginal women by non-Indigenous men, as well as fears among non-Indigenous people of being outnumbered by a mixed-descent population.<ref name=\"Northern Territory\"/>\n\nUnder the ''[[Northern Territory Aboriginals Act 1910]]'', the Chief Protector of Aborigines was appointed the \"legal guardian of every Aboriginal and every half-caste child up to the age of 18 years\", thus providing the legal basis for enforcing segregation. After the Commonwealth took control of the Territory, under the ''[[Aboriginals Ordinance 1918]]'', the Chief Protector was given total control of all Indigenous women regardless of their age, unless married to a man who was \"substantially of European origin\", and his approval was required for any marriage of an Indigenous woman to a non-Indigenous man.<ref name=\"Northern Territory\"/>\n\n==Policy in practice==\nThe ''[[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] [[Aboriginal Protection Act 1869]]'' included the earliest legislation to authorise child removal from Aboriginal parents. The Central Board for the Protection of Aborigines had been advocating such powers since 1860. Passage of the Act gave the colony of Victoria a wide suite of powers over Aboriginal and \"half-caste\" persons, including the forcible removal of children, especially \"at risk\" girls.<ref>M.F. Christie, ''Aboriginal People in Colonial Victoria, 1835\u201386'', pp. 175\u2013176.</ref> Through the late 19th and early 20th century, similar policies and legislation were adopted by other states and territories, such as the ''[[Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897]]'' (Qld), the ''Aboriginals Ordinance 1918'' (NT), the ''Aborigines Act 1934'' (SA), and the ''1936 Native Administration Act'' (WA).<ref name=\"stolen62\"/>\n\nAs a result of such legislation, states arranged widespread removal of (primarily) mixed-race children from their Aboriginal mothers. In addition, appointed Aboriginal protectors in each state exercised wide-ranging [[Legal guardian|guardianship]] powers over Aboriginal people up to the age of 16 or 21, often determining where they could live or work. Policemen or other agents of the state (some designated as \"Aboriginal Protection Officers\") were given the power to locate and transfer babies and children of mixed descent from their mothers, families, and communities into institutions for care. In these Australian states and territories, institutions (both government and missionary) for half-caste children were established in the early decades of the 20th century to care and educate the mixed-race children taken from their families.<ref>[http://www.tim-richardson.net/joomla15/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=29:the-stolen-generations-robert-manne&catid=67:opinion&Itemid=72 Tim Richardson on ''The Stolen Generations: Robert Manne''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724105956/http://www.tim-richardson.net/joomla15/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=29%3Athe-stolen-generations-robert-manne&catid=67%3Aopinion&Itemid=72 |date=24 July 2011 }}.</ref> Examples of such institutions include [[Moore River Native Settlement]] in Western Australia, [[Doomadgee, Queensland|Doomadgee Aboriginal Mission]] in [[Queensland]], [[Ebenezer Mission]] in Victoria, and [[Wellington Valley Mission]] in [[New South Wales]], as well as Catholic missions such as [[Beagle Bay Community|Beagle Bay]] and [[Pirlangimpi|Garden Point]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/franklinmissions.pdf|author=J.

Estimates of numbers have been widely disputed. The ''[[Bringing Them Home]]'' report says that \"at least 100,000\" children were removed from their parents. This figure was estimated by multiplying the Aboriginal population in 1994 (303,000), by the report's maximum estimate of \"one in three\" Aboriginal persons separated from their families. The report stated that \"between one in three and one in ten\" children were separated from their families. Given differing populations over a long period of time, different policies at different times in different states (which also resulted in different definitions of target children), and incomplete records, accurate figures are difficult to establish.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} The academic [[Robert Manne]] has stated that the lower-end figure of one in 10 is more likely; he estimates that between 20,000 and 25,000 Aboriginal children were removed over six decades, based on a survey of self-identified Indigenous people by the television station [[ABS (TV station)|ABS]].<ref name=\"Flood 2006\">{{cite book |last=Flood |first=Josephine |title=The Original Australians: Story of the Aboriginal People |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h0Ph5GLwWOQC |year=2006 |publisher=Allen & Unwin |location=Crows Nest, NSW |isbn=978-1-74114-872-5}}</ref>{{rp|232}} According to the ''Bringing Them Home'' report: \n\n{{quote|In certain regions and in certain periods the figure was undoubtedly much greater than one in ten.

In some cases, families were required to sign legal documents to relinquish care to the state. In Western Australia, the ''Aborigines Act 1905'' removed the legal guardianship of Aboriginal parents.

This designated his position as the legal guardian of every Aboriginal child in South Australia, not only the so-called \"half-castes\".<ref name=stolen14/>\n\nThe ''Bringing Them Home'' report identified instances of official misrepresentation and deception, such as when caring and able parents were incorrectly described by Aboriginal Protection Officers as not being able to properly provide for their children. In other instances, parents were told by government officials that their child or children had died, even though this was not the case. One first-hand account referring to events in 1935 stated:\n\n<blockquote>I was at the post office with my Mum and Auntie [and cousin]. They put us in the police ute and said they were taking us to Broome. They put the mums in there as well. But when we'd gone [about {{convert|10|mi|km|spell=in}}] they stopped, and threw the mothers out of the car. We jumped on our mothers' backs, crying, trying not to be left behind. But the policemen pulled us off and threw us back in the car. They pushed the mothers away and drove off, while our mothers were chasing the car, running and crying after us. We were screaming in the back of that car. When we got to Broome they put me and my cousin in the Broome lock-up. We were only ten years old. We were in the lock-up for two days waiting for the boat to Perth.<ref name=\"Scope of Inquiry\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe report discovered that removed children were, in most cases, placed into institutional facilities operated by religious or charitable organisations. A significant number, particularly females, were \"fostered\" out. Children taken to such institutions were trained to be assimilated to Anglo-Australian culture. Policies included punishment for speaking their local Indigenous languages. The intention was to educate them for a different future and to prevent their being [[Socialization|socialised]] in [[Australian Aboriginal culture|Aboriginal cultures]]. The boys were generally trained as agricultural labourers and the girls as [[Domestic worker|domestic servants]]; these were the chief occupations of many Europeans at the time in the largely rural areas outside cities.<ref name=\"stolen62\">{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/IndigLRes/stolen/stolen62.html|title=Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission: Bringing them Home: Appendices|via=AustLII|date=1997|accessdate=25 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nA common aspect of the removals was the failure by these institutions to keep records of the actual parentage of the child, or such details as the date or place of birth. As is stated in the report:\n<blockquote>the physical infrastructure of missions, government institutions and children's homes was often very poor and resources were insufficient to improve them or to keep the children adequately clothed, fed and sheltered.<ref name=\"stolen18\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe children were taken into care purportedly to protect them from neglect and abuse.

Particularly in the areas of employment and post-secondary education, the removed children had about the same results as those who were not removed.

In cases where their files were available, individuals were sometimes allowed to view their own files.

The ''[[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)]]'' case (commonly known as the ''Mabo case'') attracted great media and public attention to itself and to all issues related to the government treatment of Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders in Australia, and most notably the Stolen Generations.\n\nIn early 1995, [[Rob Riley (Aboriginal activist)|Rob Riley]], an activist with the [[Aboriginal Legal Service]], published ''Telling Our Story.''

During the ensuing 17 months, the Inquiry visited every state and Territory in Australia, heard testimony from 535 Aboriginal Australians, and received submissions of evidence from more than 600 more. In April 1997, the Commission released its official ''Bringing Them Home'' report.\n\nBetween the commissioning of the National Inquiry and the release of the final report in 1997, the government of [[John Howard]] had replaced the [[Paul Keating]] government.

As public pressure continued to increase on the government, Howard drafted a motion of \"deep and sincere regret over the removal of Aboriginal children from their parents\", which was passed by the federal parliament in August 1999.

The idea expressed by [[A. O. Neville]], the [[Chief Protector of Aborigines]] for [[Western Australia]], and others as late as 1930 was that mixed-race children could be trained to work in white society, and over generations would marry white and be assimilated into the society.<ref>Neville, AO (1930).

This was a response to public concern over the increase in the number of mixed-descent children and sexual exploitation of young Aboriginal women by non-Indigenous men, as well as fears among non-Indigenous people of being outnumbered by a mixed-descent population.<ref name=\"Northern Territory\"/>\n\nUnder the ''[[Northern Territory Aboriginals Act 1910]]'', the Chief Protector of Aborigines was appointed the \"legal guardian of every Aboriginal and every half-caste child up to the age of 18 years\", thus providing the legal basis for enforcing segregation. After the Commonwealth took control of the Territory, under the ''[[Aboriginals Ordinance 1918]]'', the Chief Protector was given total control of all Indigenous women regardless of their age, unless married to a man who was \"substantially of European origin\", and his approval was required for any marriage of an Indigenous woman to a non-Indigenous man.<ref name=\"Northern Territory\"/>\n\n==Policy in practice==\nThe ''[[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] [[Aboriginal Protection Act 1869]]'' included the earliest legislation to authorise child removal from Aboriginal parents. The Central Board for the Protection of Aborigines had been advocating such powers since 1860. Passage of the Act gave the colony of Victoria a wide suite of powers over Aboriginal and \"half-caste\" persons, including the forcible removal of children, especially \"at risk\" girls.<ref>M.F. Christie, ''Aboriginal People in Colonial Victoria, 1835\u201386'', pp. 175\u2013176.</ref> Through the late 19th and early 20th century, similar policies and legislation were adopted by other states and territories, such as the ''[[Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897]]'' (Qld), the ''Aboriginals Ordinance 1918'' (NT), the ''Aborigines Act 1934'' (SA), and the ''1936 Native Administration Act'' (WA).<ref name=\"stolen62\"/>\n\nAs a result of such legislation, states arranged widespread removal of (primarily) mixed-race children from their Aboriginal mothers. In addition, appointed Aboriginal protectors in each state exercised wide-ranging [[Legal guardian|guardianship]] powers over Aboriginal people up to the age of 16 or 21, often determining where they could live or work. Policemen or other agents of the state (some designated as \"Aboriginal Protection Officers\") were given the power to locate and transfer babies and children of mixed descent from their mothers, families, and communities into institutions for care. In these Australian states and territories, institutions (both government and missionary) for half-caste children were established in the early decades of the 20th century to care and educate the mixed-race children taken from their families.<ref>[http://www.tim-richardson.net/joomla15/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=29:the-stolen-generations-robert-manne&catid=67:opinion&Itemid=72 Tim Richardson on ''The Stolen Generations: Robert Manne''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724105956/http://www.tim-richardson.net/joomla15/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=29%3Athe-stolen-generations-robert-manne&catid=67%3Aopinion&Itemid=72 |date=24 July 2011 }}.</ref> Examples of such institutions include [[Moore River Native Settlement]] in Western Australia, [[Doomadgee, Queensland|Doomadgee Aboriginal Mission]] in [[Queensland]], [[Ebenezer Mission]] in Victoria, and [[Wellington Valley Mission]] in [[New South Wales]], as well as Catholic missions such as [[Beagle Bay Community|Beagle Bay]] and [[Pirlangimpi|Garden Point]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/franklinmissions.pdf|author=J.

Estimates of numbers have been widely disputed. The ''[[Bringing Them Home]]'' report says that \"at least 100,000\" children were removed from their parents. This figure was estimated by multiplying the Aboriginal population in 1994 (303,000), by the report's maximum estimate of \"one in three\" Aboriginal persons separated from their families. The report stated that \"between one in three and one in ten\" children were separated from their families. Given differing populations over a long period of time, different policies at different times in different states (which also resulted in different definitions of target children), and incomplete records, accurate figures are difficult to establish.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} The academic [[Robert Manne]] has stated that the lower-end figure of one in 10 is more likely; he estimates that between 20,000 and 25,000 Aboriginal children were removed over six decades, based on a survey of self-identified Indigenous people by the television station [[ABS (TV station)|ABS]].<ref name=\"Flood 2006\">{{cite book |last=Flood |first=Josephine |title=The Original Australians: Story of the Aboriginal People |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h0Ph5GLwWOQC |year=2006 |publisher=Allen & Unwin |location=Crows Nest, NSW |isbn=978-1-74114-872-5}}</ref>{{rp|232}} According to the ''Bringing Them Home'' report: \n\n{{quote|In certain regions and in certain periods the figure was undoubtedly much greater than one in ten.

In other instances, parents were told by government officials that their child or children had died, even though this was not the case. One first-hand account referring to events in 1935 stated:\n\n<blockquote>I was at the post office with my Mum and Auntie [and cousin].

A significant number, particularly females, were \"fostered\" out. Children taken to such institutions were trained to be assimilated to Anglo-Australian culture. Policies included punishment for speaking their local Indigenous languages. The intention was to educate them for a different future and to prevent their being [[Socialization|socialised]] in [[Australian Aboriginal culture|Aboriginal cultures]].

According to the testimony of one Aboriginal person:\n\n<blockquote>I was requested to attend at the Sunshine Welfare Offices, where they formerly (sic) discharged me from State ward ship.

The ''[[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)]]'' case (commonly known as the ''Mabo case'') attracted great media and public attention to itself and to all issues related to the government treatment of Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders in Australia, and most notably the Stolen Generations.\n\nIn early 1995, [[Rob Riley (Aboriginal activist)|Rob Riley]], an activist with the [[Aboriginal Legal Service]], published ''Telling Our Story.''

During the ensuing 17 months, the Inquiry visited every state and Territory in Australia, heard testimony from 535 Aboriginal Australians, and received submissions of evidence from more than 600 more. In April 1997, the Commission released its official ''Bringing Them Home'' report.\n\nBetween the commissioning of the National Inquiry and the release of the final report in 1997, the government of [[John Howard]] had replaced the [[Paul Keating]] government.

As public pressure continued to increase on the government, Howard drafted a motion of \"deep and sincere regret over the removal of Aboriginal children from their parents\", which was passed by the federal parliament in August 1999.

It concerns the author's mother and two other mixed-race Aboriginal girls who ran away from Moore River Native Settlement, north of Perth, and returned to their Aboriginal families. In a subsequent interview with the ABC, Doris recalled her removal in 1931 from her mother at age three or four, and subsequent rearing at the settlement. She was not reunited with her mother until she was 25; all those years, she believed that her mother had given her away. When the two women were reunited, Doris was no longer able to speak her native language and had been taught to regard Indigenous culture as evil.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/message/tv/ms/s731524.htm|title=Doris Pilkington|publisher=abc.net.au|date=24 December 2002|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310114305/http://www.abc.net.au/message/tv/ms/s731524.htm|archivedate=10 March 2007}}</ref>\n*[[Baz Luhrmann]]'s 2008 film ''[[Australia (2008 film)|Australia]]'', starring [[Nicole Kidman]] and [[Hugh Jackman]], deals with the Stolen Generations.\n\n===Stage===\n*''[[Stolen (play)|Stolen]]'' (1998) is a play by Australian playwright [[Jane Harrison (playwright)|Jane Harrison]].

Benang follows Harley, a young man who has gone through the process of \"breeding out the colour\", as he pieces together his family history through documentation, such as photograph and his grandfather's notes, as well as memories and experiences.

At the time this was widely seen as a positive thing by society for both the mothers and the children. The term ''white stolen generations'' is now used to distinguish this group from the Indigenous stolen generations. The mothers were sometimes drugged, tied to beds, or told their babies had died. Many hospitals engaged in what is now known as institutionalised baby farming. These babies were often adopted into middle class families.<ref name=\"smh.com.au\">Liz Hannan, Liz (8 December 2010), [http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/politics/white-mothers-of-stolen-children-also-deserve-an-apology-20101207-18o7t.html \"White mothers of stolen children also deserve an apology\"], ''The Sydney Morning Herald''.</ref><ref name=\"m.brisbanetimes.com.au\">Calligeros, Marissa (24 December 2010), [http://m.brisbanetimes.com.au/lifestyle/your-son-is-gone-hes-with-his-adoptive-parents-20101222-1958a.html?page=1 \"'Your son is gone.

Gradually, a market developed at the bank and became a major place of economic activity. The bank was covered with stones to help dock ships and vessels, and the market was developed at a place that was fully covered with stones. People started to refer to the place as ''Shiler Chor'', meaning \"a bank of stones\". With the passage of time, ''Shiler Chor'' was simplified to ''Silchar'', and ultimately the British officials started to use the name ''Silchar'' in their official documents referring to the surrounding area of the market. Thus Silchar became the official name of the place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/544040/Silchar |title=Silchar (India) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia|publisher=Britannica.com |date=|accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> Sonu(Composer)\n\n==History==\n===Cachar district records===\nIn the 1850s, [[British East India Company|British]] tea planters re-discovered the game [[polo]] in [[Manipur]] on the Burmese border with India.

Gradually, a market developed at the bank and became a major place of economic activity. The bank was covered with stones to help dock ships and vessels, and the market was developed at a place that was fully covered with stones. People started to refer to the place as ''Shiler Chor'', meaning \"a bank of stones\". With the passage of time, ''Shiler Chor'' was simplified to ''Silchar'', and ultimately the British officials started to use the name ''Silchar'' in their official documents referring to the surrounding area of the market. Thus Silchar became the official name of the place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/544040/Silchar |title=Silchar (India) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia|publisher=Britannica.com |date=|accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> Sonu(Composer)\n\n==History==\n===Cachar district records===\nIn the 1850s, [[British East India Company|British]] tea planters re-discovered the game [[polo]] in [[Manipur]] on the Burmese border with India.

Therefore, an appropriate [[real-time computing]] language would need to be chosen.

As software architecture provides a fundamental structure of a software system, its evolution and maintenance would necessarily impact its fundamental structure. As such, architecture evolution is concerned with adding new functionality as well as maintaining existing functionality and system behavior.\n\nArchitecture requires critical supporting activities. These supporting activities take place throughout the core software architecture process. They include knowledge management and communication, design reasoning and decision making, and documentation.\n\n=== Architecture supporting activities ===\nSoftware architecture supporting activities are carried out during core software architecture activities. These supporting activities assist a software architect to carry out analysis, synthesis, evaluation, and evolution. For instance, an architect has to gather knowledge, make decisions and document during the analysis phase.\n\n* '''Knowledge management and communication''' is the act of exploring and managing knowledge that is essential to designing a software architecture. A software architect does not work in isolation. They get inputs, functional and non-functional requirements, and design contexts, from various stakeholders; and provides outputs to stakeholders. Software architecture knowledge is often tacit and is retained in the heads of stakeholders. Software architecture knowledge management activity is about finding, communicating, and retaining knowledge.

Valente, K. Czarnecki, and R.S. Bigonha, \"Recommending Refactorings to Reverse Software Architecture Erosion\",\n16th European Conference on Software Maintenance and Reengineering, 2012. \nhttp://gsd.uwaterloo.ca/sites/default/files/Full%20Text.pdf</ref> Software architecture erosion occurs when implementation decisions either do not fully achieve the architecture-as-planned or otherwise violate constraints or principles of that architecture.<ref name=\"PERRY1992\"/> The gap between planned and actual architectures is sometimes understood in terms of the notion of [[technical debt]].\n\nAs an example, consider a strictly [[Abstraction (computer science)#Layered architecture|layered]] system, where each layer can only use services provided by the layer immediately below it. Any source code component that does not observe this constraint represents an architecture violation. If not corrected, such violations can transform the architecture into a monolithic block, with adverse effects on understandability, maintainability, and evolvability.\n\nVarious approaches have been proposed to address erosion. \n\"These approaches, which include tools, techniques, and processes, are primarily classified into three general categories that attempt to minimize, prevent and repair architecture erosion. Within these broad categories, each approach is further broken down reflecting the high-level strategies adopted to tackle erosion. These are process-oriented architecture conformance, architecture evolution management, architecture design enforcement, architecture to implementation linkage, self-adaptation and architecture restoration techniques consisting of recovery, discovery, and reconciliation.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=de Silva |first1=L. |first2=D. |last2=Balasubramaniam |title=Controlling software architecture erosion: A survey |journal=Journal of Systems and Software |year=2012 |volume=85 |issue=1 |pages=132\u2013151 |doi=10.1016/j.jss.2011.07.036}}</ref>\n\nThere are two major techniques to detect architectural violations: reflexion models and domain-specific languages. Reflexion model (RM) techniques compare a high-level model provided by the system's architects with the source code implementation. There are also [[domain-specific language]]s with a focus on specifying and checking architectural constraints.\n\n=== Software architecture recovery ===\n{{main|Software architecture recovery}}\n\nSoftware architecture recovery (or reconstruction, or [[reverse engineering]]) includes the methods, techniques, and processes to uncover a software system's architecture from available information, including its implementation and documentation. Architecture recovery is often necessary to make informed decisions in the face of obsolete or out-of-date documentation and \n[[Software architecture#Software architecture erosion|architecture erosion]]: implementation and maintenance decisions diverging from the envisioned architecture.<ref>\nLungu, M. \"Software architecture recovery\", University of Lugano, 2008. \nhttp://www.slideshare.net/mircea.lungu/software-architecture-recovery-in-five-questions-presentation\n</ref> Practices exist to recover software architecture as [[Code analysis|static program analysis]].

During the 1990s there was a concerted effort to define and codify fundamental aspects of the discipline, with research work concentrating on architectural styles ([[patterns]]), [[architecture description language]]s, [[Software documentation#Architecture/Design documentation|architecture documentation]], and [[formal method]]s.<ref>{{cite web|author=Garlan & Shaw |title= An Introduction to Software Architecture |url= https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/able/ftp/intro_softarch/intro_softarch.pdf |year=1994|accessdate=2006-09-25}}</ref>\n\nResearch institutions have played a prominent role in furthering software architecture as a discipline. [[Mary Shaw (computer scientist)|Mary Shaw]] and David Garlan of [[Carnegie Mellon]] wrote a book titled ''Software Architecture: Perspectives on an Emerging Discipline'' in 1996, which promoted software architecture concepts such as [[software component|components]], connectors, and styles. The [[University of California, Irvine]]'s Institute for Software Research's efforts in software architecture research is directed primarily in architectural styles, architecture description languages, and dynamic architectures.\n\n[[IEEE 1471]]-2000, \"Recommended Practice for Architecture Description of Software-Intensive Systems\", was the first formal standard in the area of software architecture. It was adopted in 2007 by ISO as [[IEEE 1471|ISO/IEC 42010:2007]]. In November 2011, IEEE 1471\u20132000 was superseded by [[ISO/IEC 42010|ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011]], \"Systems and software engineering \u2013 Architecture description\" (jointly published by IEEE and ISO).<ref name=\"ISO42010\">{{cite web|author=ISO/IEC/IEEE|title=ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011 Systems and software engineering \u2013 Architecture description|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=50508|year=2011|accessdate=2012-09-12}}</ref>\n\nWhile in [[IEEE 1471]], software architecture was about the architecture of \"software-intensive systems\", defined as \"any system where software contributes essential influences to the design, construction, deployment, and evolution of the system as a whole\", the 2011 edition goes a step further by including the [[ISO/IEC 15288]] and [[ISO/IEC 12207]] definitions of a system, which embrace not only hardware and software, but also \"humans, processes, procedures, facilities, materials and naturally occurring entities\". This reflects the relationship between software architecture, [[enterprise architecture]] and [[solution architecture]].\n\n==Architecture activities==\n\nThere are many activities that a software architect performs. A software architect typically works with project managers, discusses [[architecturally significant requirements]] with stakeholders, designs a software architecture, evaluates a design, communicates with designers and stakeholders, documents the architectural design and more.<ref name=\"Kruchten 2008\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Kruchten | first1 = P. | title = What do software architects really do? | doi = 10.1016/j.jss.2008.08.025 | journal = Journal of Systems and Software | volume = 81 | issue = 12 | pages = 2413\u20132416 | year = 2008 }}</ref> There are four core activities in software architecture design.<ref name=\"hofmeister07\"/> These core architecture activities are performed iteratively and at different stages of the initial software development life-cycle, as well as over the evolution of a system.\n\n'''Architectural analysis''' is the process of understanding the environment in which a proposed system will operate and determining the requirements for the system. The input or requirements to the analysis activity can come from any number of stakeholders and include items such as:\n\n* what the system will do when operational (the functional requirements)\n* how well the system will perform runtime non-functional requirements such as reliability, operability, performance efficiency, security, compatibility defined in [[ISO/IEC 25010]]:2011 standard<ref name=\"ISO25010\">{{cite web|author=ISO/IEC|title=ISO/IEC 25010:2011 Systems and software engineering \u2013 Systems and software Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE) \u2013 System and software quality models|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=35733|year=2011|accessdate=2012-10-08}}</ref> \n* development-time non-functional requirements such as maintainability and transferability defined in ISO 25010:2011 standard<ref name=\"ISO25010\"/> \n* business requirements and environmental contexts of a system that may change over time, such as legal, social, financial, competitive, and technology concerns<ref>{{cite journal|author=Osterwalder and Pigneur| title = An Ontology for e-Business Models|pages=65\u201397|year=2004|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8513/9070e23b0b3278d73ea51b873acd99352e9c.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.9.6922}}</ref>\n\nThe outputs of the analysis activity are those requirements that have a measurable impact on a software system's architecture, called architecturally significant requirements.<ref name=\"ASR_Chen\">{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1109/MS.2012.174|title = Characterizing Architecturally Significant Requirements|journal = IEEE Software|volume = 30|issue = 2|pages = 38\u201345|year = 2013|last1 = Chen|first1 = Lianping|last2 = Ali Babar|first2 = Muhammad|last3 = Nuseibeh|first3 = Bashar|hdl = 10344/3061}}</ref>\n\n'''Architectural synthesis''' or design is the process of creating an architecture.

As software architecture provides a fundamental structure of a software system, its evolution and maintenance would necessarily impact its fundamental structure. As such, architecture evolution is concerned with adding new functionality as well as maintaining existing functionality and system behavior.\n\nArchitecture requires critical supporting activities. These supporting activities take place throughout the core software architecture process. They include knowledge management and communication, design reasoning and decision making, and documentation.\n\n=== Architecture supporting activities ===\nSoftware architecture supporting activities are carried out during core software architecture activities. These supporting activities assist a software architect to carry out analysis, synthesis, evaluation, and evolution. For instance, an architect has to gather knowledge, make decisions and document during the analysis phase.\n\n* '''Knowledge management and communication''' is the act of exploring and managing knowledge that is essential to designing a software architecture. A software architect does not work in isolation. They get inputs, functional and non-functional requirements, and design contexts, from various stakeholders; and provides outputs to stakeholders. Software architecture knowledge is often tacit and is retained in the heads of stakeholders. Software architecture knowledge management activity is about finding, communicating, and retaining knowledge. As software architecture design issues are intricate and interdependent, a knowledge gap in design reasoning can lead to incorrect software architecture design.<ref name=\"Kruchten 2008\" /><ref name=\"SAKM\">{{cite book|last1=Babar|first1=M.A.|last2=Dings\u00f8yr|first2=T.|last3=Lago|first3=P.|last4=Vliet|first4=H. van|title=Software Architecture Knowledge Management:Theory and Practice (eds.), First Edition|publisher = Springer|year=2009|isbn=978-3-642-02373-6}}</ref> Examples of knowledge management and communication activities include searching for design patterns, prototyping, asking experienced developers and architects, evaluating the designs of similar systems, sharing knowledge with other designers and stakeholders, and documenting experience in a wiki page.\n* '''Design reasoning and decision making''' is the activity of evaluating design decisions.

System design is described using several views that frequently include a static view showing the code structure of the system, a dynamic view showing the actions of the system during execution, and a deployment view showing how a system is placed on hardware for execution.

Each view addresses a set of system concerns, following the conventions of its ''viewpoint'', where a viewpoint is a specification that describes the notations, modeling, and analysis techniques to use in a view that expresses the architecture in question from the perspective of a given set of stakeholders and their concerns ([[ISO/IEC 42010|ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010]]). The viewpoint specifies not only the concerns framed (i.e., to be addressed) but the presentation, model kinds used, conventions used and any consistency (correspondence) rules to keep a view consistent with other views.\n\n=== Architecture frameworks ===\n{{main|Architecture framework}}\nAn architecture framework captures the \"conventions, principles and practices for the description of architectures established within a specific domain of application and/or community of stakeholders\" ([[ISO/IEC 42010|ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010]]).

A number of methods have been developed to balance the trade-offs of up-front design and agility,<ref name=\"Boehm2004\">{{cite book |title=Balancing Agility and Discipline |last1=Boehm|first1=Barry|last2=Turner|first2=Richard|year=2004|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=978-0-321-18612-6}}</ref> including the agile method [[dynamic systems development method|DSDM]] which mandates a \"Foundations\" phase during which \"just enough\" architectural foundations are laid.

Valente, K. Czarnecki, and R.S. Bigonha, \"Recommending Refactorings to Reverse Software Architecture Erosion\",\n16th European Conference on Software Maintenance and Reengineering, 2012. \nhttp://gsd.uwaterloo.ca/sites/default/files/Full%20Text.pdf</ref> Software architecture erosion occurs when implementation decisions either do not fully achieve the architecture-as-planned or otherwise violate constraints or principles of that architecture.<ref name=\"PERRY1992\"/> The gap between planned and actual architectures is sometimes understood in terms of the notion of [[technical debt]].\n\nAs an example, consider a strictly [[Abstraction (computer science)#Layered architecture|layered]] system, where each layer can only use services provided by the layer immediately below it. Any source code component that does not observe this constraint represents an architecture violation. If not corrected, such violations can transform the architecture into a monolithic block, with adverse effects on understandability, maintainability, and evolvability.\n\nVarious approaches have been proposed to address erosion. \n\"These approaches, which include tools, techniques, and processes, are primarily classified into three general categories that attempt to minimize, prevent and repair architecture erosion. Within these broad categories, each approach is further broken down reflecting the high-level strategies adopted to tackle erosion. These are process-oriented architecture conformance, architecture evolution management, architecture design enforcement, architecture to implementation linkage, self-adaptation and architecture restoration techniques consisting of recovery, discovery, and reconciliation.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=de Silva |first1=L. |first2=D. |last2=Balasubramaniam |title=Controlling software architecture erosion: A survey |journal=Journal of Systems and Software |year=2012 |volume=85 |issue=1 |pages=132\u2013151 |doi=10.1016/j.jss.2011.07.036}}</ref>\n\nThere are two major techniques to detect architectural violations: reflexion models and domain-specific languages. Reflexion model (RM) techniques compare a high-level model provided by the system's architects with the source code implementation. There are also [[domain-specific language]]s with a focus on specifying and checking architectural constraints.\n\n=== Software architecture recovery ===\n{{main|Software architecture recovery}}\n\nSoftware architecture recovery (or reconstruction, or [[reverse engineering]]) includes the methods, techniques, and processes to uncover a software system's architecture from available information, including its implementation and documentation. Architecture recovery is often necessary to make informed decisions in the face of obsolete or out-of-date documentation and \n[[Software architecture#Software architecture erosion|architecture erosion]]: implementation and maintenance decisions diverging from the envisioned architecture.<ref>\nLungu, M. \"Software architecture recovery\", University of Lugano, 2008. \nhttp://www.slideshare.net/mircea.lungu/software-architecture-recovery-in-five-questions-presentation\n</ref> Practices exist to recover software architecture as [[Code analysis|static program analysis]]. This is a part of subjects covered by the [[software intelligence]] practice.\n\n==Related fields==\n\n=== Design ===\n{{main|Software design}}\nArchitecture is [[Software design|design]] but not all design is architectural.<ref name=\"DSA2\"/> In practice, the architect is the one who draws the line between software architecture (architectural design) and detailed design (non-architectural design). There are no rules or guidelines that fit all cases, although there have been attempts to formalize the distinction. \nAccording to the ''Intension/Locality Hypothesis'',<ref name=\"edenkazman\">{{cite web |author1=Amnon H.
