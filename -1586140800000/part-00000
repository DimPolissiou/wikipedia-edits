Maximine Portas was born two and a half months [[Premature birth|premature]], weighing only 930 grams (2.05 pounds), and was not at first expected to live. She formed her political views early. From childhood and throughout her life, she was a passionate advocate for [[animal rights]]. Her earliest political affiliations were with [[Greek nationalism]].<ref name=\"Black Sun\"/>\n\nPortas studied philosophy and chemistry, earning two [[master's degree]]s and a [[Ph.D.]] in philosophy from the [[University of Lyon]].<ref name=TN /> She next traveled to Greece, and surveyed the legendary ruins. Here, she became familiar with [[Heinrich Schliemann]]'s discovery of [[swastika]]s in [[Anatolia]]. Her conclusion was that [[Ancient Greeks]] were [[Aryan]] in origin. Her first two books were her [[doctoral dissertation]]s: ''Essai-critique sur Th\u00e9ophile Ka\u00efris'' (''Critical Essay on [[Theophilos Kairis]]'') (Lyon: Maximine Portas, 1935) and ''La simplicit\u00e9 math\u00e9matique'' (''Mathematical Simplicity'') (Lyon: Maximine Portas, 1935). Sometime between 1929 and 1934, she was the French tutor of the philosopher [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] (1922\u20131997), as he revealed in a radio interview by Katherine von B\u00fclow (''France Culture'' 20/4/1996).<ref>[http://www.mourningtheancient.com/savitri.htm \"Savitri Devi: The Woman Against Time\"] by R. G. Fowler. ''Mourning the Ancient''.

Joining a [[pilgrimage]] to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] during [[Lent]] in 1929, Portas decided that she was a [[Nazism|National Socialist]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019|reason=Such a claim needs a source}}\n\nIn 1932, she travelled to India in search of a living [[Paganism|pagan]] Aryan culture. Formally adhering to [[Hinduism]], she took the name Savitri Devi (\"Sun-rays Goddess\" in [[Sanskrit]]). She volunteered at the Hindu Mission as an advocate against [[Judeo-Christianity]],<ref name=CF /> and wrote ''[[A Warning to the Hindus]]'' to offer her support for [[Hindu nationalism]] and independence, and to rally resistance to the spread of [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] in India.<ref name=HP /> During the 1930s, she distributed pro-Axis propaganda and engaged in intelligence gathering on the British in India.<ref name=TN /> She claimed that, during World War II, she enabled [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] (leader of the Axis-affiliated [[Indian National Army]]) to make contact with representatives of the [[Empire of Japan]].<ref name=\"rediff\">Shrabani Basu, [http://www.rediff.com/news/1999/mar/27hitler.htm  \"The spy who loved Hitler\"] ''Rediff News'' (first published in ''Sunday'' magazine), March 1999, retrieved 6 November 2012.</ref>\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Savitri Devi, July 1945.jpg|thumb|left|Devi in 1945]]\nDuring [[World War II]], Devi's connection to the [[Axis powers]] led to a clash with her mother, who served with the [[French Resistance]] during the German occupation of France.<ref name=nephews>[http://www.savitridevi.org/article-nephews.html Greg Johnson, 2006, \"Savitri Devi's Communist Nephews\", ''savitridevi.org'']; (6 November 2012).</ref> In 1940, Devi married [[Asit Krishna Mukherji]], a [[Bengal]]i [[Brahmin]] with National Socialist views who edited the pro-German newspaper ''New Mercury''. During 1941, Devi chose to interpret [[Operation Lustre|Allied military support]] for Greece, against Italian and German forces, as an invasion of Greece. Devi and Mukherji continued to gather intelligence for the Axis cause. This included entertaining Allied personnel, which gave Devi and Mukherji an opportunity to question them regarding military matters. The information gathered was passed on to Japanese intelligence officials and contributed to attacks on Allied airbases and army units.<ref name=\"rediff\" />\n\n==Post-war Nazi activism==\n{{Main|Neo-Nazism|Holocaust denial}}\nAfter [[World War II]], she travelled to Europe in late 1945<ref name=BS /> under the name Savitri Devi Mukherji as the wife of a British subject from India, under a [[British Indian passport]]. She stopped briefly in England, then visited her mother in France, and then travelled on to Iceland where she witnessed the [[volcanic eruption|eruption]] of [[Hekla|Mount Hekla]]. She then returned to England, before travelling to Sweden where she met with [[Sven Hedin]].<ref name=HP />\n\nOn 15 June 1948 she took the [[Nord Express|Nord-Express]] from Denmark to Germany,<ref name=HP /> where she distributed many thousands of copies of handwritten leaflets encouraging the \"Men and women of Germany\" to \"hold fast to our glorious National Socialist faith, and resist!\" She recounted her experience in ''Gold in the Furnace'' (which has been reedited in honor of her 100th birthday under the title ''Gold in the Furnace: Experiences in Post-War Germany'').<ref name=HP /><ref name=BS />\n\nArrested for posting bills, she was tried in D\u00fcsseldorf on 5 April 1949 for the promotion of Nazi ideas on German territory subject to the [[Allied Control Council]], and sentenced to two years imprisonment. She served eight months in [[Werl Prison]], where she befriended her fellow Nazi and [[SS]] prisoners (recounted in ''[[Defiance (book)|Defiance]]''), before being released and expelled from Germany. She then went to stay in Lyon, France.<ref name=HP /><ref name=BS />\n\nIn April 1953, she obtained a Greek passport in her [[maiden name]] in order to re-enter Germany, and she began a [[pilgrimage]], as she called it, of Nazi \"holy\" sites. She flew from Athens to Rome then travelled by rail over the [[Brenner Pass]] into \"[[German Question#Later influence|Greater Germany]]\", which she regarded as \"the spiritual home of all racially conscious modern [[Aryan race|Aryans]]\". She travelled to a number of sites significant in the life of Adolf Hitler and the [[NSDAP]] (Nazi party), as well as German nationalist and heathen monuments, as recounted in her 1958 book ''[[Pilgrimage (book)|Pilgrimage]]''.<ref name=HP />\n\nSavitri Devi became friends with [[Hans-Ulrich Rudel]], and completed her manuscript of ''[[The Lightning and the Sun]]'' at his home in March 1956. Through his introductions she was able to meet a number of Nazi \u00e9migr\u00e9s in Spain and the Middle East. In 1957 she stayed with [[Johann von Leers]] in Egypt as she traveled across the Middle East when returning home to New Delhi, including stops in Beirut, [[Damascus]], [[Baghdad]], [[Tehran]], and [[Zahedan]].<ref name=HP /> In 1961 she stayed with [[Otto Skorzeny]] in Madrid.<ref name=BS />\n\nSavitri Devi took employment teaching in France during the 1960s, spending her summer holidays with friends at [[Berchtesgaden]]. In the spring of 1961, while on her Easter holiday in London she learned of the original [[British National Party (1960)|British National Party]]. This group emerged after the Second World War when a handful of former members of the [[British Union of Fascists]] took on the name. (The original BNP was absorbed quite quickly into the [[Union Movement]] \u2013 it is not directly connected with the present [[British National Party|BNP]].) She met with the British National Party president [[Andrew Fountaine]]. Beginning a correspondence with [[Colin Jordan]], she became a devoted supporter of the [[National Socialist Movement (UK, 1962)|National Socialist Movement]].<ref name=BS />\n\nIn August 1962, Savitri Devi attended the international Nazi conference in [[Gloucestershire]] and was a founder-signatory of the Cotswold Agreement that established the [[World Union of National Socialists]] (WUNS). At this conference she met, and was greatly impressed by, [[George Lincoln Rockwell]]. When Rockwell became leader of WUNS, he appointed [[William Luther Pierce]] editor of its new magazine: ''National Socialist World'' (1966\u201368). Along with articles by Jordan and Rockwell, Pierce devoted nearly eighty pages of the first issue to a condensed edition of ''The Lightning and the Sun''. Because of the enthusiastic response, Pierce included chapters from ''Gold in the Furnace'' and ''Defiance'' in subsequent issues.<ref name=BS />\n\nAfter retiring from teaching in 1970, Savitri Devi spent nine months at the Normandy home of close friend [[Fran\u00e7oise Dior]] while working on her memoirs; although she was at first welcome, her annoying personal habits began to disrupt life at the presbytery (amongst other traits, she did not take a bath during her stay and chewed garlic continually).  Concluding that her pension would go much further in India and encouraged by Fran\u00e7oise Dior, she flew from Paris to Bombay on 23 June 1971. In August she moved to New Delhi, where she lived alone, with a number of cats and at least one cobra.<ref name=BS />\n\nSavitri Devi continued correspondence with Nazi enthusiasts in Europe and the Americas, particularly with [[Colin Jordan]], [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]], [[Matt Koehl]], [[Miguel Serrano]], [[Anti-Jewish Action League of Sweden|Einar \u00c5berg]] and [[Ernst Z\u00fcndel]]. She was the first to claim to Z\u00fcndel that the [[Holocaust denial|Nazi genocide of the Jews was untrue]]; he proposed a series of taped interviews (conducted in November 1978) and published a new illustrated edition of ''The Lightning and the Sun'' in 1979.<ref name=BS />\n\n==Animal rights activism==\nDevi was a pioneer in [[animal rights]] activism, and was a [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] from a young age and held [[Environmentalism|ecologist]] views in her works. She wrote ''[[The Impeachment of Man]]'' in 1959 in India<ref name=TN /> in which she declared her views on animal rights and nature. According to her, human beings do not stand above the animals; but in her ecologist views, humans are rather a part of the ecosystem and should respect all life, including animals and the whole of nature.\n\nShe always held radical views on vegetarianism<ref name=TN /> and supported the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] for those who did not \"respect nature or animals\". She once broke into laboratories and took animals being held there, releasing them from being used in experiments.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} She believed that [[vivisection]], [[circuses]], [[Animal slaughter|slaughter]] and [[fur]] industries among others do not belong in a civilized society.\n\n==Death==\nBy the late 1970s she had developed cataracts and her eyesight was rapidly deteriorating. A clerk from the French embassy in India named Myriam Hirn looked after her, making regular house visits. She decided to leave India, returning to Germany to live in Bavaria in 1981 before re-moving to France in 1982.<ref name=HP/>\n\nShe eventually died in 1982 in [[Sible Hedingham]], Essex, England, at a friend's home. The cause of death was recorded as [[myocardial infarction]] and [[coronary thrombosis]]. She was ''en route'' to lecture in [[United States|America]] at the invitation of [[Matthias Koehl|Matt Koehl]] at the time. Devi's ashes were shipped to the [[American Nazi Party]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]], where they were purportedly placed next to those of Rockwell in a \"Nazi hall of honor\".<ref name=BS/>\n\n==Works==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Maximine Portas was born two and a half months [[Premature birth|premature]], weighing only 930 grams (2.05 pounds), and was not at first expected to live. She formed her political views early. From childhood and throughout her life, she was a passionate advocate for [[animal rights]]. Her earliest political affiliations were with [[Greek nationalism]].<ref name=\"Black Sun\"/>\n\nPortas studied philosophy and chemistry, earning two [[master's degree]]s and a [[Ph.D.]] in philosophy from the [[University of Lyon]].<ref name=TN /> She next traveled to Greece, and surveyed the legendary ruins. Here, she became familiar with [[Heinrich Schliemann]]'s discovery of [[swastika]]s in [[Anatolia]]. Her conclusion was that [[Ancient Greeks]] were [[Aryan]] in origin. Her first two books were her [[doctoral dissertation]]s: ''Essai-critique sur Th\u00e9ophile Ka\u00efris'' (''Critical Essay on [[Theophilos Kairis]]'') (Lyon: Maximine Portas, 1935) and ''La simplicit\u00e9 math\u00e9matique'' (''Mathematical Simplicity'') (Lyon: Maximine Portas, 1935). Sometime between 1929 and 1934, she was the French tutor of the philosopher [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] (1922\u20131997), as he revealed in a radio interview by Katherine von B\u00fclow (''France Culture'' 20/4/1996).<ref>[http://www.mourningtheancient.com/savitri.htm \"Savitri Devi: The Woman Against Time\"] by R.

Formally adhering to [[Hinduism]], she took the name Savitri Devi (\"Sun-rays Goddess\" in [[Sanskrit]]). She volunteered at the Hindu Mission as an advocate against [[Judeo-Christianity]],<ref name=CF /> and wrote ''[[A Warning to the Hindus]]'' to offer her support for [[Hindu nationalism]] and independence, and to rally resistance to the spread of [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] in India.<ref name=HP /> During the 1930s, she distributed pro-Axis propaganda and engaged in intelligence gathering on the British in India.<ref name=TN /> She claimed that, during World War II, she enabled [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] (leader of the Axis-affiliated [[Indian National Army]]) to make contact with representatives of the [[Empire of Japan]].<ref name=\"rediff\">Shrabani Basu, [http://www.rediff.com/news/1999/mar/27hitler.htm  \"The spy who loved Hitler\"] ''Rediff News'' (first published in ''Sunday'' magazine), March 1999, retrieved 6 November 2012.</ref>\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Savitri Devi, July 1945.jpg|thumb|left|Devi in 1945]]\nDuring [[World War II]], Devi's connection to the [[Axis powers]] led to a clash with her mother, who served with the [[French Resistance]] during the German occupation of France.<ref name=nephews>[http://www.savitridevi.org/article-nephews.html Greg Johnson, 2006, \"Savitri Devi's Communist Nephews\", ''savitridevi.org'']; (6 November 2012).</ref> In 1940, Devi married [[Asit Krishna Mukherji]], a [[Bengal]]i [[Brahmin]] with National Socialist views who edited the pro-German newspaper ''New Mercury''. During 1941, Devi chose to interpret [[Operation Lustre|Allied military support]] for Greece, against Italian and German forces, as an invasion of Greece. Devi and Mukherji continued to gather intelligence for the Axis cause. This included entertaining Allied personnel, which gave Devi and Mukherji an opportunity to question them regarding military matters. The information gathered was passed on to Japanese intelligence officials and contributed to attacks on Allied airbases and army units.<ref name=\"rediff\" />\n\n==Post-war Nazi activism==\n{{Main|Neo-Nazism|Holocaust denial}}\nAfter [[World War II]], she travelled to Europe in late 1945<ref name=BS /> under the name Savitri Devi Mukherji as the wife of a British subject from India, under a [[British Indian passport]]. She stopped briefly in England, then visited her mother in France, and then travelled on to Iceland where she witnessed the [[volcanic eruption|eruption]] of [[Hekla|Mount Hekla]]. She then returned to England, before travelling to Sweden where she met with [[Sven Hedin]].<ref name=HP />\n\nOn 15 June 1948 she took the [[Nord Express|Nord-Express]] from Denmark to Germany,<ref name=HP /> where she distributed many thousands of copies of handwritten leaflets encouraging the \"Men and women of Germany\" to \"hold fast to our glorious National Socialist faith, and resist!\" She recounted her experience in ''Gold in the Furnace'' (which has been reedited in honor of her 100th birthday under the title ''Gold in the Furnace: Experiences in Post-War Germany'').<ref name=HP /><ref name=BS />\n\nArrested for posting bills, she was tried in D\u00fcsseldorf on 5 April 1949 for the promotion of Nazi ideas on German territory subject to the [[Allied Control Council]], and sentenced to two years imprisonment. She served eight months in [[Werl Prison]], where she befriended her fellow Nazi and [[SS]] prisoners (recounted in ''[[Defiance (book)|Defiance]]''), before being released and expelled from Germany. She then went to stay in Lyon, France.<ref name=HP /><ref name=BS />\n\nIn April 1953, she obtained a Greek passport in her [[maiden name]] in order to re-enter Germany, and she began a [[pilgrimage]], as she called it, of Nazi \"holy\" sites. She flew from Athens to Rome then travelled by rail over the [[Brenner Pass]] into \"[[German Question#Later influence|Greater Germany]]\", which she regarded as \"the spiritual home of all racially conscious modern [[Aryan race|Aryans]]\". She travelled to a number of sites significant in the life of Adolf Hitler and the [[NSDAP]] (Nazi party), as well as German nationalist and heathen monuments, as recounted in her 1958 book ''[[Pilgrimage (book)|Pilgrimage]]''.<ref name=HP />\n\nSavitri Devi became friends with [[Hans-Ulrich Rudel]], and completed her manuscript of ''[[The Lightning and the Sun]]'' at his home in March 1956. Through his introductions she was able to meet a number of Nazi \u00e9migr\u00e9s in Spain and the Middle East. In 1957 she stayed with [[Johann von Leers]] in Egypt as she traveled across the Middle East when returning home to New Delhi, including stops in Beirut, [[Damascus]], [[Baghdad]], [[Tehran]], and [[Zahedan]].<ref name=HP /> In 1961 she stayed with [[Otto Skorzeny]] in Madrid.<ref name=BS />\n\nSavitri Devi took employment teaching in France during the 1960s, spending her summer holidays with friends at [[Berchtesgaden]]. In the spring of 1961, while on her Easter holiday in London she learned of the original [[British National Party (1960)|British National Party]]. This group emerged after the Second World War when a handful of former members of the [[British Union of Fascists]] took on the name. (The original BNP was absorbed quite quickly into the [[Union Movement]] \u2013 it is not directly connected with the present [[British National Party|BNP]].) She met with the British National Party president [[Andrew Fountaine]]. Beginning a correspondence with [[Colin Jordan]], she became a devoted supporter of the [[National Socialist Movement (UK, 1962)|National Socialist Movement]].<ref name=BS />\n\nIn August 1962, Savitri Devi attended the international Nazi conference in [[Gloucestershire]] and was a founder-signatory of the Cotswold Agreement that established the [[World Union of National Socialists]] (WUNS). At this conference she met, and was greatly impressed by, [[George Lincoln Rockwell]]. When Rockwell became leader of WUNS, he appointed [[William Luther Pierce]] editor of its new magazine: ''National Socialist World'' (1966\u201368). Along with articles by Jordan and Rockwell, Pierce devoted nearly eighty pages of the first issue to a condensed edition of ''The Lightning and the Sun''. Because of the enthusiastic response, Pierce included chapters from ''Gold in the Furnace'' and ''Defiance'' in subsequent issues.<ref name=BS />\n\nAfter retiring from teaching in 1970, Savitri Devi spent nine months at the Normandy home of close friend [[Fran\u00e7oise Dior]] while working on her memoirs; although she was at first welcome, her annoying personal habits began to disrupt life at the presbytery (amongst other traits, she did not take a bath during her stay and chewed garlic continually).  Concluding that her pension would go much further in India and encouraged by Fran\u00e7oise Dior, she flew from Paris to Bombay on 23 June 1971. In August she moved to New Delhi, where she lived alone, with a number of cats and at least one cobra.<ref name=BS />\n\nSavitri Devi continued correspondence with Nazi enthusiasts in Europe and the Americas, particularly with [[Colin Jordan]], [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]], [[Matt Koehl]], [[Miguel Serrano]], [[Anti-Jewish Action League of Sweden|Einar \u00c5berg]] and [[Ernst Z\u00fcndel]]. She was the first to claim to Z\u00fcndel that the [[Holocaust denial|Nazi genocide of the Jews was untrue]]; he proposed a series of taped interviews (conducted in November 1978) and published a new illustrated edition of ''The Lightning and the Sun'' in 1979.<ref name=BS />\n\n==Animal rights activism==\nDevi was a pioneer in [[animal rights]] activism, and was a [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] from a young age and held [[Environmentalism|ecologist]] views in her works. She wrote ''[[The Impeachment of Man]]'' in 1959 in India<ref name=TN /> in which she declared her views on animal rights and nature. According to her, human beings do not stand above the animals; but in her ecologist views, humans are rather a part of the ecosystem and should respect all life, including animals and the whole of nature.\n\nShe always held radical views on vegetarianism<ref name=TN /> and supported the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] for those who did not \"respect nature or animals\". She once broke into laboratories and took animals being held there, releasing them from being used in experiments.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} She believed that [[vivisection]], [[circuses]], [[Animal slaughter|slaughter]] and [[fur]] industries among others do not belong in a civilized society.\n\n==Death==\nBy the late 1970s she had developed cataracts and her eyesight was rapidly deteriorating. A clerk from the French embassy in India named Myriam Hirn looked after her, making regular house visits. She decided to leave India, returning to Germany to live in Bavaria in 1981 before re-moving to France in 1982.<ref name=HP/>\n\nShe eventually died in 1982 in [[Sible Hedingham]], Essex, England, at a friend's home. The cause of death was recorded as [[myocardial infarction]] and [[coronary thrombosis]]. She was ''en route'' to lecture in [[United States|America]] at the invitation of [[Matthias Koehl|Matt Koehl]] at the time. Devi's ashes were shipped to the [[American Nazi Party]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]], where they were purportedly placed next to those of Rockwell in a \"Nazi hall of honor\".<ref name=BS/>\n\n==Works==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The first step in conducting a systematic review is to create a structured question to guide the review.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors =  Eden J, Levit L, Berg A, Morton S | collaboration = Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Standards for Systematic Reviews of Comparative Effectiveness Research |title= Finding What Works in Health Care: Standards for Systematic Reviews. |date=2011 |pmid=24983062 |doi=10.17226/13059 |isbn=978-0-309-16425-2 | editor1-last = Eden | editor1-first = Jill | editor2-last = Levit | editor2-first = Laura | editor3-last = Berg | editor3-first = Alfred | editor4-last = Morton | editor4-first = Sally }}</ref> The second step is to perform a thorough search of the literature for relevant papers. The ''Methodology'' section of a systematic review will list all of the [[database]]s and [[citation index]]es that were searched such as [[Web of Science]], [[Embase]], and [[PubMed]] and any individual journals that were searched. The searching of different databases is a hallmark of clinical trials. In this regard, more recently there has been increased recognition of the importance of using different search technologies, with artificial intelligence-based tools gaining recognition. The titles and abstracts of identified articles are checked against pre-determined criteria for eligibility and relevance to form an inclusion set. This set will relate back to the research problem. Each included study may be assigned an objective assessment of methodological quality preferably by using methods conforming to the [[Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses]] (PRISMA) statement (the current guideline)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prisma-statement.org/ |title=PRISMA |publisher=Prisma-statement.org |access-date=2013-08-29}}</ref> or the high quality standards of Cochrane.<ref name=CochraneHandbook>{{cite book |date=March 2011 |url=http://handbook.cochrane.org | veditors = Higgins JP, Green S |title=Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions |edition=Version 5.1  |publisher=The Cochrane Collaboration}}</ref>\n\nSystematic reviews often, but not always, use statistical techniques ([[meta-analysis]]) to combine results of eligible studies, or at least use scoring of the levels of evidence depending on the methodology used. An additional rater may be consulted to resolve any scoring differences between raters.<ref name=\"Herman2008\"/> Systematic review is often applied in the [[biomedical research|biomedical]] or healthcare context, but it can be applied in any field of research. Groups like the [[Campbell Collaboration]] are promoting the use of systematic reviews in policy-making beyond just healthcare.\n\nA systematic review uses an objective and transparent approach for research synthesis, with the aim of minimizing bias. While many systematic reviews are based on an explicit [[quantitative research|quantitative]] meta-analysis of available data, there are also [[qualitative research|qualitative]] reviews which adhere to standards for gathering, analyzing and reporting evidence.<ref name=Bearman2013>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bearman M, Dawson P | title = Qualitative synthesis and systematic review in health professions education | journal = Medical Education | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 252\u201360 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23398011 | doi = 10.1111/medu.12092 }}</ref> The [[EPPI-Centre]] has been influential in developing methods for combining both qualitative and quantitative research in systematic reviews.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Thomas J, Harden A, Oakley A, Oliver S, Sutcliffe K, Rees R, Brunton G, Kavanagh J | title = Integrating qualitative research with trials in systematic reviews | journal = BMJ | volume = 328 | issue = 7446 | pages = 1010\u20132 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15105329 | pmc = 404509 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.328.7446.1010 }}</ref> The PRISMA statement<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Liberati A, Altman DG, Tetzlaff J, Mulrow C, G\u00f8tzsche PC, Ioannidis JP, Clarke M, Devereaux PJ, Kleijnen J, Moher D | title = The PRISMA statement for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies that evaluate health care interventions: explanation and elaboration | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 6 | issue = 7 | pages = e1000100 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19621070 | pmc = 2707010 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000100 }}</ref> suggests a standardized way to ensure a transparent and complete reporting of systematic reviews, and is now required for this kind of research by more than 170 medical journals worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prisma-statement.org/Endorsement/PRISMAEndorsers.aspx |title=PRISMA Endorsers |website=www.prisma-statement.org|access-date=1 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nDevelopments in systematic reviews during the 21st century included [[Philosophical realism|realist]] reviews and the [[meta-narrative]] approach, both of which addressed problems of methods and [[heterogeneity]] existing on some subjects.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pawson R, Greenhalgh T, Harvey G, Walshe K | title = Realist review--a new method of systematic review designed for complex policy interventions | journal = Journal of Health Services Research & Policy | volume = 10 Suppl 1 | pages = 21\u201334 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 16053581 | doi = 10.1258/1355819054308530 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Greenhalgh T, Potts HW, Wong G, Bark P, Swinglehurst D | title = Tensions and paradoxes in electronic patient record research: a systematic literature review using the meta-narrative method | journal = The Milbank Quarterly | volume = 87 | issue = 4 | pages = 729\u201388 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 20021585 | pmc = 2888022 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-0009.2009.00578.x | jstor = 25593645 }}</ref>\n\n===Scoping reviews===\n\nScoping reviews are distinct from systematic reviews in a number of important ways. A scoping review is an attempt to search for concepts, mapping the language which surrounds those and adjusting the search method iteratively.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/1364557032000119616|title = Scoping studies: Towards a methodological framework|journal = International Journal of Social Research Methodology|volume = 8|pages = 19\u201332|year = 2005|last1 = Arksey|first1 = Hilary|last2 = O'Malley|first2 = Lisa | name-list-format = vanc |url = http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/1618/1/Scopingstudies.pdf}}</ref> A [[scoping review]] may often be a preliminary stage before a systematic review, which 'scopes' out an area of inquiry and maps the language and key concepts. As it is a kind of review which should be systematically conducted (the method is repeatable), some academic publishers categorize them as a kind of 'systematic review', which may cause confusion. Scoping reviews are helpful when it is not possible to carry out a systematic synthesis of research findings, for example, when there are no published clinical trials in the area of inquiry. Scoping reviews are a helpful method when an area of inquiry is very broad, for example, exploring how the public are involved in all stages systematic reviews.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pollock A, Campbell P, Struthers C, Synnot A, Nunn J, Hill S, Goodare H, Watts C, Morley R | title = Stakeholder involvement in systematic reviews: a protocol for a systematic review of methods, outcomes and effects | journal = Research Involvement and Engagement | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 9 | date = 2017-04-21 | pmid = 29062534 | pmc = 5611627 | doi = 10.1186/s40900-017-0060-4 }}</ref> There is still a lack of clarity when defining the exact method of scoping review as it is both an iterative process and is still relatively new and there have been a number of attempts to improve the standardisation of the method.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Levac D, Colquhoun H, O'Brien KK | title = Scoping studies: advancing the methodology | journal = Implementation Science | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 69 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20854677 | pmc = 2954944 | doi = 10.1186/1748-5908-5-69 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Peters MD, Godfrey CM, Khalil H, McInerney P, Parker D, Soares CB | title = Guidance for conducting systematic scoping reviews | journal = International Journal of Evidence-Based Healthcare | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 141\u20136 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26134548 | doi = 10.1097/XEB.0000000000000050 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Colquhoun HL, Levac D, O'Brien KK, Straus S, Tricco AC, Perrier L, Kastner M, Moher D | title = Scoping reviews: time for clarity in definition, methods, and reporting | journal = Journal of Clinical Epidemiology | volume = 67 | issue = 12 | pages = 1291\u20134 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25034198 | doi = 10.1016/j.jclinepi.2014.03.013 | hdl = 1807/73365 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Arksey|first=Hilary|last2=O'Malley|first2=Lisa | name-list-format = vanc |date=2005-02-01|title=Scoping studies: towards a methodological framework |journal=International Journal of Social Research Methodology|volume=8|issue=1|pages=19\u201332|doi=10.1080/1364557032000119616 |url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/1618/1/Scopingstudies.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/prisma-scr/|title=PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR): Checklist and Explanation {{!}} The EQUATOR Network|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> PROSPERO does not permit the submission of protocols of scoping reviews,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/#aboutregpage |title= PROSPER O| work = Centre for Reviews and Dissemination | publisher = University of York |access-date=2019-02-24}}</ref> although some journals will publish protocols for scoping reviews.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n== Stages ==\nThe main stages of a systematic review are:\n\n# '''Defining a question''' and agreeing an objective method.<ref name=\"Cochrane storyboard\">{{cite web|url=https://cccrg.cochrane.org/animated-storyboard-what-are-systematic-reviews|title=Animated Storyboard: What Are Systematic Reviews?|website=cccrg.cochrane.org|publisher=[[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane Consumers and Communication]]|access-date=1 June 2016}}</ref> It is considered best practice to publish the protocol of the systematic review before initiating it in order to help avoid unplanned duplication and to enable comparison of reported review methods with what was planned in the protocol.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.prisma-statement.org/Protocols/Registration |title=PRISMA|work = Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) |access-date=2019-02-24}}</ref>\n# '''A search for relevant data''' from research that matches certain criteria.

The ''Methodology'' section of a systematic review will list all of the [[database]]s and [[citation index]]es that were searched such as [[Web of Science]], [[Embase]], and [[PubMed]] and any individual journals that were searched. The searching of different databases is a hallmark of clinical trials. In this regard, more recently there has been increased recognition of the importance of using different search technologies, with artificial intelligence-based tools gaining recognition. The titles and abstracts of identified articles are checked against pre-determined criteria for eligibility and relevance to form an inclusion set. This set will relate back to the research problem. Each included study may be assigned an objective assessment of methodological quality preferably by using methods conforming to the [[Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses]] (PRISMA) statement (the current guideline)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prisma-statement.org/ |title=PRISMA |publisher=Prisma-statement.org |access-date=2013-08-29}}</ref> or the high quality standards of Cochrane.<ref name=CochraneHandbook>{{cite book |date=March 2011 |url=http://handbook.cochrane.org | veditors = Higgins JP, Green S |title=Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions |edition=Version 5.1  |publisher=The Cochrane Collaboration}}</ref>\n\nSystematic reviews often, but not always, use statistical techniques ([[meta-analysis]]) to combine results of eligible studies, or at least use scoring of the levels of evidence depending on the methodology used.

As it is a kind of review which should be systematically conducted (the method is repeatable), some academic publishers categorize them as a kind of 'systematic review', which may cause confusion. Scoping reviews are helpful when it is not possible to carry out a systematic synthesis of research findings, for example, when there are no published clinical trials in the area of inquiry. Scoping reviews are a helpful method when an area of inquiry is very broad, for example, exploring how the public are involved in all stages systematic reviews.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pollock A, Campbell P, Struthers C, Synnot A, Nunn J, Hill S, Goodare H, Watts C, Morley R | title = Stakeholder involvement in systematic reviews: a protocol for a systematic review of methods, outcomes and effects | journal = Research Involvement and Engagement | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 9 | date = 2017-04-21 | pmid = 29062534 | pmc = 5611627 | doi = 10.1186/s40900-017-0060-4 }}</ref> There is still a lack of clarity when defining the exact method of scoping review as it is both an iterative process and is still relatively new and there have been a number of attempts to improve the standardisation of the method.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Levac D, Colquhoun H, O'Brien KK | title = Scoping studies: advancing the methodology | journal = Implementation Science | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 69 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20854677 | pmc = 2954944 | doi = 10.1186/1748-5908-5-69 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Peters MD, Godfrey CM, Khalil H, McInerney P, Parker D, Soares CB | title = Guidance for conducting systematic scoping reviews | journal = International Journal of Evidence-Based Healthcare | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 141\u20136 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26134548 | doi = 10.1097/XEB.0000000000000050 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Colquhoun HL, Levac D, O'Brien KK, Straus S, Tricco AC, Perrier L, Kastner M, Moher D | title = Scoping reviews: time for clarity in definition, methods, and reporting | journal = Journal of Clinical Epidemiology | volume = 67 | issue = 12 | pages = 1291\u20134 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25034198 | doi = 10.1016/j.jclinepi.2014.03.013 | hdl = 1807/73365 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Arksey|first=Hilary|last2=O'Malley|first2=Lisa | name-list-format = vanc |date=2005-02-01|title=Scoping studies: towards a methodological framework |journal=International Journal of Social Research Methodology|volume=8|issue=1|pages=19\u201332|doi=10.1080/1364557032000119616 |url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/1618/1/Scopingstudies.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/prisma-scr/|title=PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR): Checklist and Explanation {{!}} The EQUATOR Network|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> PROSPERO does not permit the submission of protocols of scoping reviews,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/#aboutregpage |title= PROSPER O| work = Centre for Reviews and Dissemination | publisher = University of York |access-date=2019-02-24}}</ref> although some journals will publish protocols for scoping reviews.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n== Stages ==\nThe main stages of a systematic review are:\n\n# '''Defining a question''' and agreeing an objective method.<ref name=\"Cochrane storyboard\">{{cite web|url=https://cccrg.cochrane.org/animated-storyboard-what-are-systematic-reviews|title=Animated Storyboard: What Are Systematic Reviews?|website=cccrg.cochrane.org|publisher=[[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane Consumers and Communication]]|access-date=1 June 2016}}</ref> It is considered best practice to publish the protocol of the systematic review before initiating it in order to help avoid unplanned duplication and to enable comparison of reported review methods with what was planned in the protocol.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.prisma-statement.org/Protocols/Registration |title=PRISMA|work = Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) |access-date=2019-02-24}}</ref>\n# '''A search for relevant data''' from research that matches certain criteria.

Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pernilla |first1=Myrne |title=Slaves for Pleasure in Arabic Sex and Slave Purchase Manuals from the Tenth to the Twelfth Centuries |journal=Journal of Global Slavery |date=2019 |volume=4 |pages=196\u2013197}}</ref>\n\nEarly sources indicate that that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pernilla |first1=Myrne |title=Slaves for Pleasure in Arabic Sex and Slave Purchase Manuals from the Tenth to the Twelfth Centuries |journal=Journal of Global Slavery |date=2019 |volume=4 |pages=203}}</ref>\n\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit. [[Faq\u012bh|Islamic jurists]] also describe marriage as a kind of sale where the wife's private parts are purchased.

They require a conversion of these women before sex can take place. [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Ibn Hanbal]] allowed sexual intercourse with pagan and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] female captives if they are forced to become Musim. Many traditions state that the female captives should be forced to accept Islam if they do not convert willingly.

Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pernilla |first1=Myrne |title=Slaves for Pleasure in Arabic Sex and Slave Purchase Manuals from the Tenth to the Twelfth Centuries |journal=Journal of Global Slavery |date=2019 |volume=4 |pages=196\u2013197}}</ref>\n\nEarly sources indicate that that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pernilla |first1=Myrne |title=Slaves for Pleasure in Arabic Sex and Slave Purchase Manuals from the Tenth to the Twelfth Centuries |journal=Journal of Global Slavery |date=2019 |volume=4 |pages=203}}</ref>\n\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit.

{"title_page": "1922 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "The 1922 [[Auckland Rugby League]] was the 14th in its history. There were 68 teams playing across the various grades. [[City Rovers]] won the first grade championship for the 5th time, with [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] winning the Roope Rooster for the 2nd time. [[City Rovers]] also defended the Challenge Shield, warding off efforts from Petone, Tongariro, and Huntly to lift it from them. [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]] set a record for points scored in an Auckland club rugby league season with 116 for [[City Rovers]]. He and his brothers [[Ben Davidson (rugby league)|Ben]] and [[George Davidson (athlete)|George]] between them scored 186 of City Rover's 339 points which was also a competition record for a team in a single season. City scored a further 19 points in the Roope Rooster competition and 85 points in their 3 Challenge Shield matches for 443 points in all official games.\n\nIt was an incredibly busy year for the Auckland representative team. They played more matches than some club teams had played in earlier seasons with ten matches in total. There was also an Auckland Provincial team match against New South Wales, and one Auckland B fixture with the team making the trip down to Cambridge to play the local side.  [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]] also led the representative team in scoring with 37 points.\n\n===Carlaw Park===\nAt a pre-season meeting of the management committee it was discussed that [[Carlaw Park]] needed more \u2018modern equipment\u2019, and it was decided that \u201cthe establishment of more modern methods of dealing with the turf and the purchase of more efficient machinery shall be an early charge on the new season\u2019s funds\u201d.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Management Committee\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIX, Issue 18042\n| date = 1922-03-17\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220317.2.16.6\n| accessdate = 2019-08-26}}</ref> Sufficient money was made from gates at club and rep fixtures at Carlaw Park and the Auckland Domain to begin improvements on the ground at the conclusion of the season.\n\n===New Clubs and Name Changes===\nThe [[Auckland Rugby League]] accepted a new club into the fold, named Central Mangere. They entered a team in the 2nd Grade.\n\nThe Maritime club also changed their name to \u2018Athletics\u2019 and in 1926 they were to change their name again to Grafton Athletic. This was not to be confused with [[Grafton Athletic]] who had existed as a team from 1914-1920 under the leadership of [[Karl Ifwersen]] and were now playing under the name of 'Fire Brigade'.\n\n[[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]] applied for entry into the Senior A Grade competition and this was approved. This made the competition an even 8 teams meaning 4 matches per round and no byes. Unlike most previous seasons there were no byes, no defaults, and no postponed matches meaning 56 matches were played in total, easily the most in the competitions history. Richmond would go on to finish 7th with 3 wins and 11 losses.\n\n{{s-start}}\n        {{s-bef|before=[[1921 Auckland Rugby League season|1921]]}}\n        {{s-ttl|title=14th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n        |years=1922}}\n        {{s-aft|after=[[1923 Auckland Rugby League season|1923]]}}\n        {{end}}\n\n===George Davidson's Return===\n[[George Davidson (athlete)|George Davidson]] played for Maritime (now named Athletics) in the 1919 season but had missed most of the 1920 and 1921 seasons as he was training for and competing at the Antwerp Olympics where he came 5th in the 200m final. He stated that over those two seasons he had only played for Maritime on two or three occasions as he was seeking a transfer to the [[City Rovers]] where his two brothers [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill]] and [[Ben Davidson (rugby league)|Ben]] played. Athletics were denying his request and Davidson appealed to the league who then asked the Athletics club to reconsider his request \"favourably\".

bodies in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Rugby league]]\n", "text_old": "The 1922 [[Auckland Rugby League]] was the 14th in its history. There were 68 teams playing across the various grades. [[City Rovers]] won the first grade championship for the 5th time, with [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] winning the Roope Rooster for the 2nd time. [[City Rovers]] also defended the Challenge Shield, warding off efforts from Petone, Tongariro, and Huntly to lift it from them. [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]] set a record for points scored in an Auckland club rugby league season with 116 for [[City Rovers]]. He and his brothers [[Ben Davidson (rugby league)|Ben]] and [[George Davidson (athlete)|George]] between them scored 186 of City Rover's 339 points which was also a competition record for a team in a single season. City scored a further 19 points in the Roope Rooster competition and 85 points in their 3 Challenge Shield matches for 443 points in all official games.\n\nIt was an incredibly busy year for the Auckland representative team. They played more matches than some club teams had played in earlier seasons with ten matches in total. There was also an Auckland Provincial team match against New South Wales, and one Auckland B fixture with the team making the trip down to Cambridge to play the local side.  [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]] also led the representative team in scoring with 37 points.\n\n===Carlaw Park===\nAt a pre-season meeting of the management committee it was discussed that [[Carlaw Park]] needed more \u2018modern equipment\u2019, and it was decided that \u201cthe establishment of more modern methods of dealing with the turf and the purchase of more efficient machinery shall be an early charge on the new season\u2019s funds\u201d.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Management Committee\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIX, Issue 18042\n| date = 1922-03-17\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220317.2.16.6\n| accessdate = 2019-08-26}}</ref> Sufficient money was made from gates at club and rep fixtures at Carlaw Park and the Auckland Domain to begin improvements on the ground at the conclusion of the season.\n\n===New Clubs and Name Changes===\nThe [[Auckland Rugby League]] accepted a new club into the fold, named Central Mangere. They entered a team in the 2nd Grade.\n\nThe Maritime club also changed their name to \u2018Athletics\u2019 and in 1926 they were to change their name again to Grafton Athletic. This was not to be confused with [[Grafton Athletic]] who had existed as a team from 1914-1920 under the leadership of [[Karl Ifwersen]] and were now playing under the name of 'Fire Brigade'.\n\n[[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]] applied for entry into the Senior A Grade competition and this was approved. This made the competition an even 8 teams meaning 4 matches per round and no byes. Unlike most previous seasons there were no byes, no defaults, and no postponed matches meaning 56 matches were played in total, easily the most in the competitions history. Richmond would go on to finish 7th with 3 wins and 11 losses.\n\n{{s-start}}\n        {{s-bef|before=[[1921 Auckland Rugby League season|1921]]}}\n        {{s-ttl|title=14th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n        |years=1922}}\n        {{s-aft|after=[[1923 Auckland Rugby League season|1923]]}}\n        {{end}}\n\n===George Davidson's Return===\n[[George Davidson (athlete)|George Davidson]] played for Maritime (now named Athletics) in the 1919 season but had missed most of the 1920 and 1921 seasons as he was training for and competing at the Antwerp Olympics where he came 5th in the 200m final. He stated that over those two seasons he had only played for Maritime on two or three occasions as he was seeking a transfer to the [[City Rovers]] where his two brothers [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill]] and [[Ben Davidson (rugby league)|Ben]] played. Athletics were denying his request and Davidson appealed to the league who then asked the Athletics club to reconsider his request \"favourably\". He would eventually have his transfer to City approved.\n\n== First Grade Championship ==\n\n=== Final Standings ===\n{|\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=175

The stated goal of the RRA is the creation and recognition of an independent state of [[Koofur Orsi]],  it was led by [[Hasan Muhammad Nur Shatigadud]]. \n\nThe RRA was found in a ''shir'' assembly at [[Jhaffey]], west of \"[[Baidoa]]\", on 13 October 1995. Col. Hassan Mohamed Nur, \"Shaargaduud\" (Red Shirt) was elected chair, and an executive committee composed of officers, traditional and religious leaders, and intellectuals was established. The formation of the RRA was triggered by the invasion of Baidoa by [[Hussein Mohamed Farrah]]'s militia on 17 September 1995, which overthrew the local government, The Digil-Mirifle Supreme Governing Council, which was established in March 1995. Aideed completed the occupation of Reewin land by capturing [[Huddur]] in the [[Bakool|Bakool Region]].\n\nThe RRA's first major task was to recruit, train, and arm young Reewin men and women. Former officers supervised the training and all Reewin clans contributed men, arms, and money. Early in 1996, the RRA attacked the more important installations held by Aideed in Huddur and Baidoa. When reconciliation efforts, especially the Sodere Declaration and Cairo Accords, failed after the death of Aidid in a street fight and the succession of his son, \"[[Hussein Aidid|Aideed Junior]],\" the RRA insisted that it would not negotiate with those who occupied Reewin land.\n\nIn October 1998, the RRA liberated Huddur and, by early November, Aideed's militia had retreated to Baidoa. This victory consolidated the RRA's military and political status locally and internationally. On 6 June 1999, the RRA liberated Baidoa and continued to fight against Aideed forces in the [[Lower Shabelle]] region. However, the [[Arta, Djibouti|Arta]] Reconciliation Conference of May\u2013August, 2000, which established a transitional national government, suspended further RRA military action. However, within a few months, the RRA broke away from the Arta agreements and began to work towards the establishment of an autonomous state.\n\nUnder Shatigadud's leadership, the RRA planted landmines in many areas under its control in the war, as did many factions in the Civil War.<ref name=LM-REPORT-2002>{{cite news\n|title=LM Report 2002\n|url=http://www.icbl.org/lm/2002/somalia.html\n|publisher=[[Landmine Monitor]]\n|date=August 2002\n|accessdate=2007-02-04 }}</ref> It was also a participant, along with fifteen other factions of the civil war, in the November 11, 2002 Deed of Commitment to ban landmines.<ref name=LM-REPORT-2005>{{cite web\n|title=LM Report 2005\n|url=http://www.icbl.org/lm/2005/somalia.html\n|publisher=[[Landmine Monitor]]\n|date=October 2005\n|accessdate=2007-02-04 }}</ref>\n\nInternal disputes in the RRA erupted in 2002 between Shatigadud, who wished to support the new [[Somalia Reconciliation and Restoration Council]] (SRRC) and his two deputies, [[Sheikh]] [[Aden Madobe]] and [[Muhammad Ibrahim Habsade]], who wished to continue to support the [[Transitional National Government]] (TNG).

On 6 June 1999, the RRA liberated Baidoa and continued to fight against Aideed forces in the [[Lower Shabelle]] region. However, the [[Arta, Djibouti|Arta]] Reconciliation Conference of May\u2013August, 2000, which established a transitional national government, suspended further RRA military action. However, within a few months, the RRA broke away from the Arta agreements and began to work towards the establishment of an autonomous state.\n\nUnder Shatigadud's leadership, the RRA planted landmines in many areas under its control in the war, as did many factions in the Civil War.<ref name=LM-REPORT-2002>{{cite news\n|title=LM Report 2002\n|url=http://www.icbl.org/lm/2002/somalia.html\n|publisher=[[Landmine Monitor]]\n|date=August 2002\n|accessdate=2007-02-04 }}</ref> It was also a participant, along with fifteen other factions of the civil war, in the November 11, 2002 Deed of Commitment to ban landmines.<ref name=LM-REPORT-2005>{{cite web\n|title=LM Report 2005\n|url=http://www.icbl.org/lm/2005/somalia.html\n|publisher=[[Landmine Monitor]]\n|date=October 2005\n|accessdate=2007-02-04 }}</ref>\n\nInternal disputes in the RRA erupted in 2002 between Shatigadud, who wished to support the new [[Somalia Reconciliation and Restoration Council]] (SRRC) and his two deputies, [[Sheikh]] [[Aden Madobe]] and [[Muhammad Ibrahim Habsade]], who wished to continue to support the [[Transitional National Government]] (TNG).

Historically, both encyclopedias and dictionaries have been researched and written by well-educated, well-informed content [[expert]]s, but they are significantly different in structure. A dictionary is a linguistic work which primarily focuses on alphabetical listing of [[words]] and their [[definitions]]. [[Synonym]]ous words and those related by the subject matter are to be found scattered around the dictionary, giving no obvious place for in-depth treatment. Thus, a dictionary typically provides limited [[information]], [[wikt:Analysis|analysis]] or background for the word defined. While it may offer a definition, it may leave the reader lacking in [[understanding]] the meaning, significance or limitations of a [[Term (language)|term]], and how the term relates to a broader field of knowledge. An encyclopedia is, theoretically, not written in order to convince, although one of its goals is indeed to convince its reader of its own veracity.\n\nTo address those needs, an encyclopedia article is typically not limited to simple definitions, and is not limited to defining an individual word, but provides a more extensive meaning for a ''subject or [[list of academic disciplines|discipline]]''. In addition to defining and listing synonymous terms for the topic, the article is able to treat the topic's more extensive meaning in more depth and convey the most relevant accumulated knowledge on that subject. An encyclopedia article also often includes many [[map]]s and [[illustration]]s, as well as [[bibliography]] and [[statistics]].\n\nFour major elements define an encyclopedia: its subject matter, its scope, its method of organization, and its method of production:\n* Encyclopedias can be general, containing articles on topics in every field (the English-language ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' and German ''[[Brockhaus Enzyklop\u00e4die|Brockhaus]]'' are well-known examples). General encyclopedias may contain guides on how to do a variety of things, as well as embedded dictionaries and [[gazetteer]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} There are also encyclopedias that cover a wide variety of topics from a particular cultural, ethnic, or national perspective, such as the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' or ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]''.\n* Works of encyclopedic scope aim to convey the important accumulated knowledge for their subject domain, such as an encyclopedia of [[medicine]], [[philosophy]] or [[law]]. Works vary in the breadth of material and the depth of discussion, depending on the [[target audience]]. \n* Some systematic method of organization is essential to making an encyclopedia usable for reference. There have historically been two main methods of organizing printed encyclopedias: the [[alphabetical order|alphabetical]] method (consisting of a number of separate articles, organized in alphabetical order) and organization by [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] categories. The former method is today the more common, especially for general works. The fluidity of [[electronic media]], however, allows new possibilities for multiple methods of organization of the same content. Further, electronic media offer new capabilities for search, [[Subject indexing|indexing]] and [[cross reference]]. The [[epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] from [[Horace]] on the title page of the 18th century ''Encyclop\u00e9die'' suggests the importance of the structure of an encyclopedia: \"What grace may be added to commonplace matters by the power of order and connection.\"\n* As modern multimedia and the information age have evolved, new methods have emerged for the collection, verification, summation, and presentation of information of all kinds. Projects such as [[Everything2]], [[Encarta]], [[h2g2]], and [[Wikipedia]] are examples of new forms of the encyclopedia as [[information retrieval]] becomes simpler. The method of production for an encyclopedia historically has been supported in both for-profit and non-profit contexts. The ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' mentioned above was entirely state sponsored, while the ''Britannica'' was supported as a for-profit institution. By comparison, Wikipedia is supported by volunteers contributing in a non-profit environment under the organization of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]].\n\nSome works entitled \"dictionaries\" are actually similar to encyclopedias, especially those concerned with a particular field (such as the ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]'', the ''[[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]]'', and ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]''). The ''[[Macquarie Dictionary]],'' Australia's national dictionary, became an [[encyclopedic dictionary]] after its first edition in recognition of the use of proper nouns in common communication, and the words derived from such proper nouns.\n\nThere are some broad differences between encyclopedias and dictionaries. Most noticeably, encyclopedia articles are longer, fuller and more thorough than entries in most general-purpose dictionaries.<ref name=DOLencyclopedia /><ref name=DOLencyclopedicdefinition /> There are differences in content as well. Generally speaking, dictionaries provide [[linguistics|linguistic]] information about words themselves, while encyclopedias focus more on the thing for which those words stand.<ref name=bejoint /><ref name=EB /><ref name=DOLei /><ref name=OHEL22 /> Thus, while dictionary entries are inextricably fixed to the word described, encyclopedia articles can be given a different entry name. As such, dictionary entries are not fully translatable into other languages, but encyclopedia articles can be.<ref name=bejoint />\n\nIn practice, however, the distinction is not concrete, as there is no clear-cut difference between factual, \"encyclopedic\" information and linguistic information such as appears in dictionaries.<ref name=DOLei /><ref name=DOLencyclopedicdefinition>{{cite book|journal= Dictionary of Lexicography|last= Hartmann|first=R.

Today they can also be distributed and displayed electronically.\n\n===Ancient times===\n[[File:naturalishistoria.jpg|thumb|''Naturalis Historiae'', 1669 edition, title page]]\nOne of the earliest encyclopedic works to have survived to modern times is the ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historiae]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]], a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] statesman living in the first century AD. He compiled a work of 37 chapters covering natural history, architecture, medicine, geography, geology, and other aspects of the world around him. He stated in the preface that he had compiled 20,000 facts from 2000 works by over 200 authors, and added many others from his own experience. The work was published around AD 77\u201379, although Pliny probably never finished editing the work before his death in the eruption of [[Vesuvius]] in AD 79.<ref name=naturalis>Naturalis Historia</ref>\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[Isidore of Seville]], one of the greatest scholars of the early [[Middle Ages]], is widely recognized for writing the first encyclopedia of the Middle Ages, the ''[[Etymologiae]]'' (''The Etymologies'') or ''Origines'' (around 630), in which he compiled a sizable portion of the learning available at his time, both ancient and contemporary. The work has 448 chapters in 20 volumes, and is valuable because of the quotes and fragments of texts by other authors that would have been lost had he not collected them.\n\nThe most popular encyclopedia of the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian Age]] was the ''De universo'' or ''De rerum naturis'' by [[Rabanus Maurus]], written about 830; it was based on ''Etymologiae''.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe encyclopedia of [[Suda]], a massive 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia, had 30 000 entries, many drawing from ancient sources that have since been lost, and often derived from medieval [[Christianity|Christian]] compilers. The text was arranged alphabetically with some slight deviations from common vowel order and place in the Greek alphabet.\n\nThe [[Historiography of early Islam|early Muslim compilations of knowledge]] in the Middle Ages included many comprehensive works. Around year 960, the [[Brethren of Purity]] of [[Basra]] were engaged in their ''[[Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity]]''.<ref>P.D. Wightman (1953), ''The Growth of Scientific Ideas''</ref> Notable works include [[Al-Razi|Abu Bakr al-Razi]]'s encyclopedia of science, the [[Mutazilite]] [[Al-Kindi]]'s prolific output of 270 books, and [[Ibn Sina]]'s medical encyclopedia, which was a standard reference work for centuries. Also notable are works of [[universal history]] (or sociology) from [[Asharite]]s, [[al-Tabri]], [[Masudi|al-Masudi]], [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Tabari]]'s ''[[History of the Prophets and Kings]]'', [[Ibn Rustah]], [[Ali ibn al-Athir|al-Athir]], and [[Ibn Khaldun]], whose ''[[The Muqadimmah|Muqadimmah]]'' contains cautions regarding trust in written records that remain wholly applicable today.\n\nThe enormous encyclopedic work in China of the ''[[Four Great Books of Song]]'', compiled by the 11th century during the early [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131279), was a massive literary undertaking for the time. The last encyclopedia of the four, the ''[[Prime Tortoise of the Record Bureau]]'', amounted to 9.4&nbsp;million [[Chinese characters]] in 1000 written volumes. The 'period of the encyclopedists' spanned from the tenth to seventeenth centuries, during which the government of China employed hundreds of scholars to assemble massive encyclopedias.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The library : an illustrated history|last=1948-|first=Murray, Stuart|date=2009|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub.]]|isbn=9781602397064|location=New York, NY|oclc=277203534|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/libraryillustrat0000murr}}</ref> The largest of which is the [[Yongle Encyclopedia]]; it was completed in 1408 and consisted of almost 23,000 folio volumes in manuscript form.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn late medieval Europe, several authors had the ambition of compiling the sum of human knowledge in a certain field or overall, for example [[Bartholomew of England]], [[Vincent of Beauvais]], [[Radulfus Ardens]], [[Book of Sydrac|Sydrac]], [[Brunetto Latini]], Giovanni da Sangiminiano, [[Pierre Bersuire]]. Some were women, like [[Hildegard of Bingen]] and [[Herrad of Landsberg]]. The most successful of those publications were the ''Speculum maius (Great Mirror)'' of [[Vincent of Beauvais]] and the ''De proprietatibus rerum (On the Properties of Things)'' by [[Bartholomew of England]]. The latter was translated (or adapted) into [[French language|French]], Proven\u00e7al, [[Italian language|Italian]], [[English language|English]], [[Flemish]], [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[German language|German]] during the Middle Ages. Both were written in the middle of the 13th century. No medieval encyclopedia bore the title ''Encyclopaedia'' \u2013 they were often called ''On nature (De natura, De naturis rerum)'', ''Mirror (Speculum maius, Speculum universale)'', ''Treasure (Tr\u00e9sor)''.<ref>Monique Paulmier-Foucart, \"Medieval Encyclopaedias\", in Andr\u00e9 Vauchez (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages'', James Clarke & Co, 2002.</ref>\n\n===Renaissance===\n[[File:Margarita Philosopica by Reisch 2.jpg|thumb|Anatomy in ''Margarita Philosophica'', 1565]]\nMedieval encyclopedias were all hand-copied and thus available mostly to wealthy patrons or monastic men of learning; they were expensive, and usually written for those extending knowledge rather than those using it.<ref name=\"dotma\">See \"Encyclopedia\" in ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]''.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Renaissance]], the creation of [[printing]] allowed a wider diffusion of encyclopedias and every scholar could have his or her own copy. The ''[[De expetendis et fugiendis rebus]]'' by [[Giorgio Valla]] was posthumously printed in 1501 by [[Aldo Manuzio]] in [[Venice]]. This work followed the traditional scheme of liberal arts. However, Valla added the translation of ancient Greek works on mathematics (firstly by [[Archimedes]]), newly discovered and translated. The ''Margarita Philosophica'' by [[Gregor Reisch]], printed in 1503, was a complete encyclopedia explaining the [[seven liberal arts]].\n\nThe term ''encyclopaedia'' was coined by 16th-century humanists who misread copies of their texts of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0138%3Abook%3Dpreface%3Achapter%3D3 Pliny the Elder, ''Naturalis Historia'', Preface 14].</ref> and [[Quintilian]],<ref>Quintilian, ''Institutio oratoria'', 1.10.1: ''ut efficiatur orbis ille doctrinae, quem Graeci \u1f10\u03b3\u03ba\u03cd\u03ba\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03bd vocant.''</ref> and combined the two Greek words \"''enkyklios paedia''\" into one word, \u03ad\u03b3\u03ba\u03c5\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29gkuklopaidei%2Fa \u03ad\u03b3\u03ba\u03c5\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek\u2013English Lexicon'', at Perseus Project: \"f. l.

Browne structured his encyclopaedia upon the time-honoured scheme of the Renaissance, the so-called 'scale of creation' which ascends through the mineral, vegetable, animal, human, planetary, and cosmological worlds. ''Pseudodoxia Epidemica'' was a European best-seller, translated into French, Dutch, and German as well as Latin it went through no fewer than five editions, each revised and augmented, the last edition appearing in 1672.\n\nFinancial, commercial, legal, and intellectual factors changed the size of encyclopedias. During the [[Renaissance]], middle classes had more time to read and encyclopedias helped them to learn more. Publishers wanted to increase their output so some countries like Germany started selling books missing alphabetical sections, to publish faster. Also, publishers could not afford all the resources by themselves, so multiple publishers would come together with their resources to create better encyclopedias. When publishing at the same rate became financially impossible, they turned to subscriptions and serial publications. This was risky for publishers because they had to find people that would pay all upfront or make payments. When this worked, capital would rise and there would be a steady income for encyclopedias. Later, rivalry grew, causing copyright to occur due to weak underdeveloped laws. Some publishers would copy another publisher's work to produce an encyclopedia faster and cheaper so consumers did not have to pay a lot and they would sell more. Encyclopedias made it to where middle-class citizens could basically have a small library in their own house. Europeans were becoming more curious about their society around them causing them to revolt against their government.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Loveland|first=J.|date=2012|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241898454|title=Why Encyclopedias Got Bigger \u2026 and Smaller|journal=Information & Culture|volume=47|issue=2|pages=233\u2013254|doi=10.1353/lac.2012.0012}}</ref>\n\n===Traditional encyclopedias===\n[[File:Encyclopedie de D'Alembert et Diderot - Premiere Page - ENC 1-NA5.jpg|thumb|''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'', 1773]]\nThe beginnings of the modern idea of the general-purpose, widely distributed printed encyclopedia precede the 18th century encyclopedists. However, [[Ephraim Chambers|Chambers]]' ''[[Cyclopaedia, or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]'' (1728), and the ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'' of [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] (1751 onwards), as well as ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' and the ''[[Brockhaus encyclopedia|Conversations-Lexikon]]'', were the first to realize the form we would recognize today, with a comprehensive scope of topics, discussed in depth and organized in an accessible, systematic method. Chambers, in 1728, followed the earlier lead of John Harris's ''[[Lexicon Technicum]]'' of 1704 and later editions (see also below); this work was by its title and content \"A Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art, but the Arts Themselves\".\n\nPopular and affordable encyclopedias such as ''[[Harmsworth's Universal Encyclopaedia]]'' and the ''[[Children's Encyclopaedia]]'' appeared in the early 1920s.\n\nIn the United States, the 1950s and 1960s saw the introduction of several large popular encyclopedias, often sold on installment plans. The best known of these were ''[[World Book]]'' and ''[[Funk and Wagnalls]]''. As many as 90% were sold [[door to door]]. Jack Lynch says in his book ''You Could Look It Up'' that encyclopedia salespeople were so common that they became the butt of jokes. He describes their sales pitch saying, ''\u201cThey were selling not books but a lifestyle, a future, a promise of social mobility.\"''  A 1961 ''World Book'' ad said, ''\u201cYou are holding your family\u2019s future in your hands right now,\u201d'' while showing a feminine hand holding an order form.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Onion |first1=Rebecca |title=How Two Artists Turn Old Encyclopedias Into Beautiful, Melancholy Art |url=https://slate.com/human-interest/2016/06/how-two-artists-turn-old-encyclopedias-into-beautiful-melancholy-art.html |website=Slate |accessdate=September 23, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:EncycBrit1913.jpg|thumb|1913 advertisement for ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', the oldest and one of the largest contemporary English encyclopedias]]\nThe second half of the 20th century also saw the proliferation of specialized encyclopedias that compiled topics in specific fields, mainly to support specific industries and professionals. This trend has continued. Encyclopedias of at least one volume in size now exist for most if not all [[academic discipline]]s, including such narrow topics such as [[bioethics]].\n\n=== Rise of digital and online encyclopedias ===\nBy the late 20th century, encyclopedias were being published on [[CD-ROM]]s for use with personal computers. [[Microsoft]]'s ''[[Encarta]]'', published between 1993 and 2009, was a landmark example as it had no printed equivalent. Articles were supplemented with both video and audio files as well as numerous high-quality images.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://encarta.msn.com/guide_page_FAQ/FAQ.html |title=Important Notice: MSN Encarta to be Discontinued |publisher=MSN Encarta |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027213618/http://encarta.msn.com/guide_page_FAQ/FAQ.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nDigital technologies and online [[crowdsourcing]] allowed encyclopedias to break away from traditional limitations in both breath and depth of topics covered. [[Wikipedia]], a crowd-sourced, [[List of Wikipedia language editions|multilingual]], [[Open content|open licence]], free [[online encyclopedia]] supported by the non-profit [[Wikimedia Foundation]] and [[open source]] [[MediaWiki]] software opened in 2001. Unlike commercial online encyclopedias such as [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online|''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' Online]], which are written by experts, Wikipedia is collaboratively created and maintained by [[Wikipedians|volunteer editors]], organized by [[Voting|collaboratively agreed]] guidelines and [[Wikipedia community|user-roles]].

Historically, both encyclopedias and dictionaries have been researched and written by well-educated, well-informed content [[expert]]s, but they are significantly different in structure. A dictionary is a linguistic work which primarily focuses on alphabetical listing of [[words]] and their [[definitions]]. [[Synonym]]ous words and those related by the subject matter are to be found scattered around the dictionary, giving no obvious place for in-depth treatment. Thus, a dictionary typically provides limited [[information]], [[wikt:Analysis|analysis]] or background for the word defined. While it may offer a definition, it may leave the reader lacking in [[understanding]] the meaning, significance or limitations of a [[Term (language)|term]], and how the term relates to a broader field of knowledge. An encyclopedia is, theoretically, not written in order to convince, although one of its goals is indeed to convince its reader of its own veracity.\n\nTo address those needs, an encyclopedia article is typically not limited to simple definitions, and is not limited to defining an individual word, but provides a more extensive meaning for a ''subject or [[list of academic disciplines|discipline]]''. In addition to defining and listing synonymous terms for the topic, the article is able to treat the topic's more extensive meaning in more depth and convey the most relevant accumulated knowledge on that subject. An encyclopedia article also often includes many [[map]]s and [[illustration]]s, as well as [[bibliography]] and [[statistics]].\n\nFour major elements define an encyclopedia: its subject matter, its scope, its method of organization, and its method of production:\n* Encyclopedias can be general, containing articles on topics in every field (the English-language ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' and German ''[[Brockhaus Enzyklop\u00e4die|Brockhaus]]'' are well-known examples). General encyclopedias may contain guides on how to do a variety of things, as well as embedded dictionaries and [[gazetteer]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} There are also encyclopedias that cover a wide variety of topics from a particular cultural, ethnic, or national perspective, such as the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' or ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]''.\n* Works of encyclopedic scope aim to convey the important accumulated knowledge for their subject domain, such as an encyclopedia of [[medicine]], [[philosophy]] or [[law]]. Works vary in the breadth of material and the depth of discussion, depending on the [[target audience]]. \n* Some systematic method of organization is essential to making an encyclopedia usable for reference. There have historically been two main methods of organizing printed encyclopedias: the [[alphabetical order|alphabetical]] method (consisting of a number of separate articles, organized in alphabetical order) and organization by [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] categories. The former method is today the more common, especially for general works. The fluidity of [[electronic media]], however, allows new possibilities for multiple methods of organization of the same content. Further, electronic media offer new capabilities for search, [[Subject indexing|indexing]] and [[cross reference]]. The [[epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] from [[Horace]] on the title page of the 18th century ''Encyclop\u00e9die'' suggests the importance of the structure of an encyclopedia: \"What grace may be added to commonplace matters by the power of order and connection.\"\n* As modern multimedia and the information age have evolved, new methods have emerged for the collection, verification, summation, and presentation of information of all kinds. Projects such as [[Everything2]], [[Encarta]], [[h2g2]], and [[Wikipedia]] are examples of new forms of the encyclopedia as [[information retrieval]] becomes simpler. The method of production for an encyclopedia historically has been supported in both for-profit and non-profit contexts. The ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' mentioned above was entirely state sponsored, while the ''Britannica'' was supported as a for-profit institution. By comparison, Wikipedia is supported by volunteers contributing in a non-profit environment under the organization of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]].\n\nSome works entitled \"dictionaries\" are actually similar to encyclopedias, especially those concerned with a particular field (such as the ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]'', the ''[[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]]'', and ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]''). The ''[[Macquarie Dictionary]],'' Australia's national dictionary, became an [[encyclopedic dictionary]] after its first edition in recognition of the use of proper nouns in common communication, and the words derived from such proper nouns.\n\nThere are some broad differences between encyclopedias and dictionaries. Most noticeably, encyclopedia articles are longer, fuller and more thorough than entries in most general-purpose dictionaries.<ref name=DOLencyclopedia /><ref name=DOLencyclopedicdefinition /> There are differences in content as well. Generally speaking, dictionaries provide [[linguistics|linguistic]] information about words themselves, while encyclopedias focus more on the thing for which those words stand.<ref name=bejoint /><ref name=EB /><ref name=DOLei /><ref name=OHEL22 /> Thus, while dictionary entries are inextricably fixed to the word described, encyclopedia articles can be given a different entry name. As such, dictionary entries are not fully translatable into other languages, but encyclopedia articles can be.<ref name=bejoint />\n\nIn practice, however, the distinction is not concrete, as there is no clear-cut difference between factual, \"encyclopedic\" information and linguistic information such as appears in dictionaries.<ref name=DOLei /><ref name=DOLencyclopedicdefinition>{{cite book|journal= Dictionary of Lexicography|last= Hartmann|first=R.

Today they can also be distributed and displayed electronically.\n\n===Ancient times===\n[[File:naturalishistoria.jpg|thumb|''Naturalis Historiae'', 1669 edition, title page]]\nOne of the earliest encyclopedic works to have survived to modern times is the ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historiae]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]], a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] statesman living in the first century AD. He compiled a work of 37 chapters covering natural history, architecture, medicine, geography, geology, and other aspects of the world around him. He stated in the preface that he had compiled 20,000 facts from 2000 works by over 200 authors, and added many others from his own experience. The work was published around AD 77\u201379, although Pliny probably never finished editing the work before his death in the eruption of [[Vesuvius]] in AD 79.<ref name=naturalis>Naturalis Historia</ref>\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[Isidore of Seville]], one of the greatest scholars of the early [[Middle Ages]], is widely recognized for writing the first encyclopedia of the Middle Ages, the ''[[Etymologiae]]'' (''The Etymologies'') or ''Origines'' (around 630), in which he compiled a sizable portion of the learning available at his time, both ancient and contemporary. The work has 448 chapters in 20 volumes, and is valuable because of the quotes and fragments of texts by other authors that would have been lost had he not collected them.\n\nThe most popular encyclopedia of the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian Age]] was the ''De universo'' or ''De rerum naturis'' by [[Rabanus Maurus]], written about 830; it was based on ''Etymologiae''.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe encyclopedia of [[Suda]], a massive 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia, had 30 000 entries, many drawing from ancient sources that have since been lost, and often derived from medieval [[Christianity|Christian]] compilers. The text was arranged alphabetically with some slight deviations from common vowel order and place in the Greek alphabet.\n\nThe [[Historiography of early Islam|early Muslim compilations of knowledge]] in the Middle Ages included many comprehensive works. Around year 960, the [[Brethren of Purity]] of [[Basra]] were engaged in their ''[[Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity]]''.<ref>P.D. Wightman (1953), ''The Growth of Scientific Ideas''</ref> Notable works include [[Al-Razi|Abu Bakr al-Razi]]'s encyclopedia of science, the [[Mutazilite]] [[Al-Kindi]]'s prolific output of 270 books, and [[Ibn Sina]]'s medical encyclopedia, which was a standard reference work for centuries. Also notable are works of [[universal history]] (or sociology) from [[Asharite]]s, [[al-Tabri]], [[Masudi|al-Masudi]], [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Tabari]]'s ''[[History of the Prophets and Kings]]'', [[Ibn Rustah]], [[Ali ibn al-Athir|al-Athir]], and [[Ibn Khaldun]], whose ''[[The Muqadimmah|Muqadimmah]]'' contains cautions regarding trust in written records that remain wholly applicable today.\n\nThe enormous encyclopedic work in China of the ''[[Four Great Books of Song]]'', compiled by the 11th century during the early [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131279), was a massive literary undertaking for the time. The last encyclopedia of the four, the ''[[Prime Tortoise of the Record Bureau]]'', amounted to 9.4&nbsp;million [[Chinese characters]] in 1000 written volumes. The 'period of the encyclopedists' spanned from the tenth to seventeenth centuries, during which the government of China employed hundreds of scholars to assemble massive encyclopedias.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The library : an illustrated history|last=1948-|first=Murray, Stuart|date=2009|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub.]]|isbn=9781602397064|location=New York, NY|oclc=277203534|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/libraryillustrat0000murr}}</ref> The largest of which is the [[Yongle Encyclopedia]]; it was completed in 1408 and consisted of almost 23,000 folio volumes in manuscript form.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn late medieval Europe, several authors had the ambition of compiling the sum of human knowledge in a certain field or overall, for example [[Bartholomew of England]], [[Vincent of Beauvais]], [[Radulfus Ardens]], [[Book of Sydrac|Sydrac]], [[Brunetto Latini]], Giovanni da Sangiminiano, [[Pierre Bersuire]]. Some were women, like [[Hildegard of Bingen]] and [[Herrad of Landsberg]]. The most successful of those publications were the ''Speculum maius (Great Mirror)'' of [[Vincent of Beauvais]] and the ''De proprietatibus rerum (On the Properties of Things)'' by [[Bartholomew of England]]. The latter was translated (or adapted) into [[French language|French]], Proven\u00e7al, [[Italian language|Italian]], [[English language|English]], [[Flemish]], [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[German language|German]] during the Middle Ages. Both were written in the middle of the 13th century. No medieval encyclopedia bore the title ''Encyclopaedia'' \u2013 they were often called ''On nature (De natura, De naturis rerum)'', ''Mirror (Speculum maius, Speculum universale)'', ''Treasure (Tr\u00e9sor)''.<ref>Monique Paulmier-Foucart, \"Medieval Encyclopaedias\", in Andr\u00e9 Vauchez (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages'', James Clarke & Co, 2002.</ref>\n\n===Renaissance===\n[[File:Margarita Philosopica by Reisch 2.jpg|thumb|Anatomy in ''Margarita Philosophica'', 1565]]\nMedieval encyclopedias were all hand-copied and thus available mostly to wealthy patrons or monastic men of learning; they were expensive, and usually written for those extending knowledge rather than those using it.<ref name=\"dotma\">See \"Encyclopedia\" in ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]''.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Renaissance]], the creation of [[printing]] allowed a wider diffusion of encyclopedias and every scholar could have his or her own copy. The ''[[De expetendis et fugiendis rebus]]'' by [[Giorgio Valla]] was posthumously printed in 1501 by [[Aldo Manuzio]] in [[Venice]]. This work followed the traditional scheme of liberal arts. However, Valla added the translation of ancient Greek works on mathematics (firstly by [[Archimedes]]), newly discovered and translated. The ''Margarita Philosophica'' by [[Gregor Reisch]], printed in 1503, was a complete encyclopedia explaining the [[seven liberal arts]].\n\nThe term ''encyclopaedia'' was coined by 16th-century humanists who misread copies of their texts of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0138%3Abook%3Dpreface%3Achapter%3D3 Pliny the Elder, ''Naturalis Historia'', Preface 14].</ref> and [[Quintilian]],<ref>Quintilian, ''Institutio oratoria'', 1.10.1: ''ut efficiatur orbis ille doctrinae, quem Graeci \u1f10\u03b3\u03ba\u03cd\u03ba\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03bd vocant.''</ref> and combined the two Greek words \"''enkyklios paedia''\" into one word, \u03ad\u03b3\u03ba\u03c5\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29gkuklopaidei%2Fa \u03ad\u03b3\u03ba\u03c5\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek\u2013English Lexicon'', at Perseus Project: \"f. l.

Browne structured his encyclopaedia upon the time-honoured scheme of the Renaissance, the so-called 'scale of creation' which ascends through the mineral, vegetable, animal, human, planetary, and cosmological worlds. ''Pseudodoxia Epidemica'' was a European best-seller, translated into French, Dutch, and German as well as Latin it went through no fewer than five editions, each revised and augmented, the last edition appearing in 1672.\n\nFinancial, commercial, legal, and intellectual factors changed the size of encyclopedias. During the [[Renaissance]], middle classes had more time to read and encyclopedias helped them to learn more. Publishers wanted to increase their output so some countries like Germany started selling books missing alphabetical sections, to publish faster. Also, publishers could not afford all the resources by themselves, so multiple publishers would come together with their resources to create better encyclopedias. When publishing at the same rate became financially impossible, they turned to subscriptions and serial publications. This was risky for publishers because they had to find people that would pay all upfront or make payments. When this worked, capital would rise and there would be a steady income for encyclopedias. Later, rivalry grew, causing copyright to occur due to weak underdeveloped laws. Some publishers would copy another publisher's work to produce an encyclopedia faster and cheaper so consumers did not have to pay a lot and they would sell more. Encyclopedias made it to where middle-class citizens could basically have a small library in their own house. Europeans were becoming more curious about their society around them causing them to revolt against their government.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Loveland|first=J.|date=2012|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241898454|title=Why Encyclopedias Got Bigger \u2026 and Smaller|journal=Information & Culture|volume=47|issue=2|pages=233\u2013254|doi=10.1353/lac.2012.0012}}</ref>\n\n===Traditional encyclopedias===\n[[File:Encyclopedie de D'Alembert et Diderot - Premiere Page - ENC 1-NA5.jpg|thumb|''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'', 1773]]\nThe beginnings of the modern idea of the general-purpose, widely distributed printed encyclopedia precede the 18th century encyclopedists. However, [[Ephraim Chambers|Chambers]]' ''[[Cyclopaedia, or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]'' (1728), and the ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'' of [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] (1751 onwards), as well as ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' and the ''[[Brockhaus encyclopedia|Conversations-Lexikon]]'', were the first to realize the form we would recognize today, with a comprehensive scope of topics, discussed in depth and organized in an accessible, systematic method. Chambers, in 1728, followed the earlier lead of John Harris's ''[[Lexicon Technicum]]'' of 1704 and later editions (see also below); this work was by its title and content \"A Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art, but the Arts Themselves\".\n\nPopular and affordable encyclopedias such as ''[[Harmsworth's Universal Encyclopaedia]]'' and the ''[[Children's Encyclopaedia]]'' appeared in the early 1920s.\n\nIn the United States, the 1950s and 1960s saw the introduction of several large popular encyclopedias, often sold on installment plans. The best known of these were ''[[World Book]]'' and ''[[Funk and Wagnalls]]''. As many as 90% were sold [[door to door]]. Jack Lynch says in his book ''You Could Look It Up'' that encyclopedia salespeople were so common that they became the butt of jokes. He describes their sales pitch saying, ''\u201cThey were selling not books but a lifestyle, a future, a promise of social mobility.\"''  A 1961 ''World Book'' ad said, ''\u201cYou are holding your family\u2019s future in your hands right now,\u201d'' while showing a feminine hand holding an order form.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Onion |first1=Rebecca |title=How Two Artists Turn Old Encyclopedias Into Beautiful, Melancholy Art |url=https://slate.com/human-interest/2016/06/how-two-artists-turn-old-encyclopedias-into-beautiful-melancholy-art.html |website=Slate |accessdate=September 23, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:EncycBrit1913.jpg|thumb|1913 advertisement for ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', the oldest and one of the largest contemporary English encyclopedias]]\nThe second half of the 20th century also saw the proliferation of specialized encyclopedias that compiled topics in specific fields, mainly to support specific industries and professionals. This trend has continued. Encyclopedias of at least one volume in size now exist for most if not all [[academic discipline]]s, including such narrow topics such as [[bioethics]].\n\n=== Rise of digital and online encyclopedias ===\nBy the late 20th century, encyclopedias were being published on [[CD-ROM]]s for use with personal computers. [[Microsoft]]'s ''[[Encarta]]'', published between 1993 and 2009, was a landmark example as it had no printed equivalent. Articles were supplemented with both video and audio files as well as numerous high-quality images.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://encarta.msn.com/guide_page_FAQ/FAQ.html |title=Important Notice: MSN Encarta to be Discontinued |publisher=MSN Encarta |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027213618/http://encarta.msn.com/guide_page_FAQ/FAQ.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nDigital technologies and online [[crowdsourcing]] allowed encyclopedias to break away from traditional limitations in both breath and depth of topics covered. [[Wikipedia]], a crowd-sourced, [[List of Wikipedia language editions|multilingual]], [[Open content|open licence]], free [[online encyclopedia]] supported by the non-profit [[Wikimedia Foundation]] and [[open source]] [[MediaWiki]] software opened in 2001. Unlike commercial online encyclopedias such as [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online|''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' Online]], which are written by experts, Wikipedia is collaboratively created and maintained by [[Wikipedians|volunteer editors]], organized by [[Voting|collaboratively agreed]] guidelines and [[Wikipedia community|user-roles]]. Most contributors use pseudonyms and stay anonymous. Content is therefor reviewed, checked, kept or removed based on its own intrinsic value and external [[Citation|sources]] supporting it.\n\nTraditional encyclopedias' reliability, on their side, stand upon authorship and associated professional expertise.
