The major glands of the endocrine system include the [[pineal gland]], [[pituitary gland]], [[pancreas]], [[Ovary|ovaries]], [[Testicle|testes]], [[thyroid|thyroid gland]], [[parathyroid gland]], [[hypothalamus]] and [[adrenal gland]]s. The hypothalamus and pituitary glands are [[neuroendocrine]] [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]s.\n\n[[File:Endocrine central nervous en.svg|thumb|350px| Endocrine glands in the human head and neck and their hormones]]\n{{Main|Pituitary gland}}\nThe [[pituitary gland]] hangs from the base of the [[brain]] by the [[pituitary stalk]], and is enclosed by bone. It consists of a hormone-producing glandular portion the [[anterior pituitary]] and a neural portion the [[posterior pituitary]], which is an extension of the [[hypothalamus]]. The hypothalamus regulates the hormonal output of the anterior pituitary and creates two hormones that it exports to the posterior pituitary for storage and later release.\n\nFour of the six anterior pituitary hormones are [[tropic hormone]]s that regulate the function of other endocrine organs. Most anterior pituitary hormones exhibit a diurnal rhythm of release, which is subject to modification by stimuli influencing the hypothalamus.\n\nSomatotropic hormone or [[growth hormone]] (GH) is an [[anabolism|anabolic hormone]] that stimulates growth of all body tissues  especially skeletal muscle and bone. It may act directly, or indirectly via [[insulin-like growth factor]]s (IGFs). GH mobilizes fats, stimulates protein synthesis, and inhibits glucose uptake and metabolism. Secretion is regulated by [[growth hormone releasing hormone]] (GHRH) and [[Somatostatin|growth hormone inhibiting hormone]] (GHIH), or somatostatin. Hypersecretion causes [[gigantism]] in children and [[acromegaly]] in adults; [[hyposecretion]] in children causes [[Growth hormone deficiency|pituitary dwarfism]].\n\n[[Thyroid-stimulating hormone]] promotes normal development and activity of the [[thyroid gland]]. [[Thyrotropin-releasing hormone]] stimulates its release; negative feedback of thyroid hormone inhibits it.\n\n[[Adrenocorticotropic hormone]] stimulates the [[adrenal cortex]] to release [[corticosteroids]]. Adrenocorticotropic hormone release is triggered by [[corticotropin]]-releasing hormone and inhibited by rising [[glucocorticoid]] levels.\n\nThe [[gonadotropin]]s\u2014[[follicle-stimulating hormone]] and [[luteinizing hormone]] regulate the functions of the gonads in both sexes. Follicle-stimulating hormone stimulates sex cell production; luteinizing hormone stimulates [[gonadal hormone]] production. Gonadotropin levels rise in response to [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]]. Negative feedback of gonadal hormones inhibits gonadotropin release.\n\n[[Prolactin]] promotes milk production in human females. Its secretion is prompted by [[PRLH|prolactin-releasing hormone]] and inhibited by [[prolactin-inhibiting hormone]].\n\nThe intermediate lobe of pituitary gland secretes only one enzyme that is [[melanocyte stimulating hormone]]. It is linked with the formation of the black pigment in our skin called melanin.\n\nThe [[Posterior pituitary|neurohypophysis]] stores and releases two hypothalamic hormones:\n* [[Oxytocin]] stimulates powerful uterine contractions, which trigger labor and delivery of an infant, and milk ejection in nursing women. Its release is mediated reflexively by the hypothalamus and represents a positive feedback mechanism.\n* [[Vasopressin|Antidiuretic hormone]] stimulates the kidney tubules to reabsorb and conserve water, resulting in small volumes of highly concentrated urine and decreased plasma osmolarity. Antidiuretic hormone is released in response to high solute concentrations in the blood and inhibited by low solute concentrations in the blood. Hyposecretion results in diabetes insipidus.\n\n===Thyroid gland===\n{{Main|Thyroid}}\nThe thyroid gland is located at the front of the neck, in front of the [[thyroid cartilage]], and is shaped like a butterfly, with two wings connected by a central {{wt|en|isthmus}}. Thyroid tissue consists of follicles with stored protein called colloid, containing[thyroglobulin], a precursor to other thyroid hormones, which are manufactured within the colloid.\n\nThe [[thyroid hormone]]s increase the rate of [[metabolism|cellular metabolism]], and include [[thyroxine]] (T4) and [[triiodothyronine]] (T3). Secretion is stimulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone, secreted by the anterior pituitary. When thyroid levels are high, there is negative feedback that decreases the amount of Thyroid-stimulating hormone secreted. Most T4 is converted to T3 (a more active form) in the target tissues.\n\n[[Calcitonin]], produced by the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland in response to rising blood calcium levels, depresses blood calcium levels by inhibiting bone matrix resorption and enhancing calcium deposit in bones.\nExcessive secretion cause hyperthyroidism and deficiency cause hypothyroidism.\n\n===Parathyroid glands===\n{{Main|Parathyroid gland}}\nThe parathyroid glands, of which there are 4\u20136, are found on the back of the thyroid glands, and secrete [[parathyroid hormone]],<ref>[http://www.unomaha.edu/hpa/endocrinehistology.html Endocrinology: Tissue Histology.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204054021/http://www.unomaha.edu/hpa/endocrinehistology.html |date=2010-02-04 }} ''[[University of Nebraska at Omaha]].''</ref> which causes an increase in blood calcium levels by targeting bone, the intestine, and the kidneys. Parathyroid hormone is the antagonist of [[calcitonin]]. Parathyroid hormone release is triggered by falling blood calcium levels and is inhibited by rising blood calcium levels.\n\n===Adrenal glands===\n{{Main|Adrenal gland}}\nThe adrenal glands are located above the kidneys in humans and\nin front of the kidneys in other animals. The adrenal glands produce a variety of hormones including [[adrenaline]] and the steroids [[aldosterone]] and [[cortisol]].<ref name=dictionary>{{cite web|title=Adrenal gland|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/adrenal%20gland|website=Medline Plus/Merriam-Webster Dictionary|accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref> It controls the behaviour during crisis and emotional situations. It stimulates the heart and its conducting tissues and metabolic processes.\n\n===Pancreas===\n{{Main|Pancreas}}\nThe pancreas, located in the abdomen, below and behind the stomach, is both an [[Exocrine gland|exocrine]] and an endocrine gland. The [[alpha cell|alpha]] and [[beta cell]]s are the endocrine cells in the [[pancreatic islets]] that release [[insulin]] and [[glucagon]] and smaller amounts of other hormones into the blood. Insulin and glucagon influence [[blood sugar level]]s. Glucagon is released when blood glucose level is low, and stimulates the liver to release [[glucose]] into the blood. Insulin increases the rate of glucose uptake and metabolism by most body cells.\n\n[[Somatostatin]] is released by [[delta cell]]s and acts as an inhibitor of GH, insulin and glucagon.\n\nKollam Poli sanam\n\n===Gonads===\n{{Main|Gonad}}\nThe ovaries of the female, located in the pelvic cavity, release two main hormones. Secretion of [[estrogen]]s by the ovarian follicles begins at [[puberty]] under the influence of follicle-stimulating hormone. Estrogens stimulate maturation of the female reproductive system and development of the secondary sexual characteristics. [[Progesterone]] is released in response to high blood levels of luteinizing hormone. It works with estrogens in establishing the [[menstrual cycle]].\n\nThe testes of the male begin to produce [[testosterone]] at puberty in response to luteinizing hormone. Testosterone promotes maturation of the male reproductive organs, development of secondary sex characteristics such as beard, hoarse voice, etc. and production of sperm by the testes.\n\n===Pineal gland===\n{{Main|Pineal gland}}\nThe pineal gland is located in the [[diencephalon]] of the brain. It primarily releases [[melatonin]], which influences daily rhythms and may have an [[antigonadotropic]] effect in humans.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} It may also influence the melanotropes and melanocytes located in the skin.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Other hormone-producing structures===\nMany body organs not normally considered endocrine organs contain isolated cell clusters that secrete hormones. Examples include the [[heart]] ([[atrial natriuretic peptide]]); [[gastrointestinal tract]] organs ([[gastrin]], [[secretin]], and others); the [[placenta]] (hormones of pregnancy\u2014[[estrogen]], [[progesterone]], and others); the [[kidney]]s ([[erythropoietin]] and [[renin]]); the [[thymus]]; [[skin]] ([[cholecalciferol]]); and [[adipose tissue]] ([[leptin]] and [[resistin]]).\n\n==Development==\n{{main|Development of the endocrine system}}\n\nEndocrine glands derive from all three germ layers.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe natural decrease in function of the female's ovaries during late middle age results in [[menopause]]. The efficiency of all endocrine glands seems to decrease gradually as aging occurs. This leads to a generalized increase in the incidence of [[diabetes mellitus]] and a lower [[Basal metabolic rate|metabolic rate]].\n\n==Function==\n===Hormones===\n{{main|Hormone}}\nLocal chemical messengers, not generally considered part of the endocrine system, include [[Autocrine signalling|autocrine]]s, which act on the cells that secrete them, and [[Paracrine signalling|paracrine]]s, which act on a different cell type nearby.\n\nThe ability of a target cell to respond to a hormone depends on the presence of receptors, within the cell or on its plasma membrane, to which the hormone can bind.\n\nHormone receptors are dynamic structures. Changes in number and sensitivity of hormone receptors may occur in response to high or low levels of stimulating hormones.\n\nBlood levels of hormones reflect a balance between [[secretion]] and degradation/[[excretion]]. The [[liver]] and [[kidney]]s are the major organs that degrade hormones; breakdown products are excreted in urine and feces.\n\nHormone half-life and duration of activity are limited and vary from hormone to hormone.\n\nInteraction of hormones at target cells\n''[[Permissiveness (biology)|Permissiveness]]'' is the situation in which a hormone cannot exert its full effects without the presence of another hormone.\n\n''[[Synergy|Synergism]]'' occurs when two or more hormones produce the same effects in a target cell and their results are amplified.\n\n''[[Antagonism (chemistry)|Antagonism]]'' occurs when a hormone opposes or reverses the effect of another hormone.\n\n===Control===\n{{main|Endocrine system}}\nThe endocrine glands belong to the body's control system.  The hormones which they produce help to regulate the functions of cells and tissues throughout the body.  Endocrine organs are activated to release their hormones by humoral, neural or hormonal stimuli. Negative feedback is important in regulating [[hormone]] levels in the blood.\n\nThe [[nervous system]], acting through hypothalamic controls, can in certain cases override or modulate hormonal effects.\n\n==Clinical significance==\n===Disease===\n[[File:Endocrine disorders world map - DALY - WHO2002.svg|thumb|[[Disability-adjusted life year]] for endocrine disorders per 100,000&nbsp;inhabitants in 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/entity/healthinfo/statistics/bodgbddeathdalyestimates.xls |title=Mortality and Burden of Disease Estimates for WHO Member States in 2002|format=xls |work=World Health Organization|year=2002 |accessdate=}}</ref>{{refbegin|2}}\n{{legend|#b3b3b3|no data}}\n{{legend|#ffff65|less than 80}}\n{{legend|#fff200|80\u2013160}}\n{{legend|#ffdc00|160\u2013240}}\n{{legend|#ffc600|240\u2013320}}\n{{legend|#ffb000|320\u2013400}}\n{{legend|#ff9a00|400\u2013480}}\n{{legend|#ff8400|480\u2013560}}\n{{legend|#ff6e00|560\u2013640}}\n{{legend|#ff5800|640\u2013720}}\n{{legend|#ff4200|720\u2013800}}\n{{legend|#ff2c00|800\u20131000}}\n{{legend|#cb0000|more than 1000}}\n{{refend}}]]\n{{Main|Endocrine diseases}}\n[[Endocrine diseases|Diseases of the endocrine glands]] are common,<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Kasper\n  | title = Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine\n  | publisher = [[McGraw Hill]]\n  | year = 2005 \n  | pages = 2074\n  | isbn =978-0-07-139140-5\n   }}</ref> including conditions such as [[diabetes mellitus]], [[thyroid]] disease, and [[obesity]].\n\nEndocrine disease is characterized by irregulated hormone release (a productive [[pituitary adenoma]]), inappropriate response to signaling  ([[hypothyroidism]]), lack of a gland ([[diabetes mellitus type 1]], diminished [[erythropoiesis]] in [[chronic kidney failure]]), or structural enlargement in a critical site such as the thyroid ([[toxic multinodular goitre]]). Hypofunction of endocrine glands can occur as a result of loss of reserve, hyposecretion, [[agenesis]], atrophy, or active destruction. Hyperfunction can occur as a result of hypersecretion, loss of suppression, [[hyperplasia|hyperplastic]] or [[neoplastic]] change, or hyperstimulation.\n\nEndocrinopathies are classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary. Primary endocrine disease inhibits the action of downstream glands. Secondary endocrine disease is indicative of a problem with the pituitary gland. Tertiary endocrine disease is associated with dysfunction of the hypothalamus and its releasing hormones.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nAs the [[Thyroid cancer|thyroid]], and hormones have been implicated in signaling distant tissues to proliferate, for example, the [[estrogen receptor]] has been shown to be involved in certain [[breast cancer]]s.

Cushing's disease and Addison's disease are pathologies involving the dysfunction of the adrenal gland. Dysfunction in the adrenal gland could be due to primary or secondary factors and can result in hypercortisolism or hypocortisolism. Cushing's disease is characterized by the hypersecretion of the adrenocorticotropic hormone due to a pituitary adenoma that ultimately causes endogenous hypercortisolism by stimulating the adrenal glands.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Buliman A, Tataranu LG, Paun DL, Mirica A, Dumitrache C | year = 2016 | title = Cushing's disease: a multidisciplinary overview of the clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment | url = | journal = Journal of Medicine & Life | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 12\u201318 }}</ref> Some clinical signs of Cushing's disease include obesity, moon face, and hirsutism.<ref name=\":1\">Vander, Arthur (2008).

Changes in number and sensitivity of hormone receptors may occur in response to high or low levels of stimulating hormones.\n\nBlood levels of hormones reflect a balance between [[secretion]] and degradation/[[excretion]]. The [[liver]] and [[kidney]]s are the major organs that degrade hormones; breakdown products are excreted in urine and feces.\n\nHormone half-life and duration of activity are limited and vary from hormone to hormone.\n\nInteraction of hormones at target cells\n''[[Permissiveness (biology)|Permissiveness]]'' is the situation in which a hormone cannot exert its full effects without the presence of another hormone.\n\n''[[Synergy|Synergism]]'' occurs when two or more hormones produce the same effects in a target cell and their results are amplified.\n\n''[[Antagonism (chemistry)|Antagonism]]'' occurs when a hormone opposes or reverses the effect of another hormone.\n\n===Control===\n{{main|Endocrine system}}\nThe endocrine glands belong to the body's control system.  The hormones which they produce help to regulate the functions of cells and tissues throughout the body.  Endocrine organs are activated to release their hormones by humoral, neural or hormonal stimuli. Negative feedback is important in regulating [[hormone]] levels in the blood.\n\nThe [[nervous system]], acting through hypothalamic controls, can in certain cases override or modulate hormonal effects.\n\n==Clinical significance==\n===Disease===\n[[File:Endocrine disorders world map - DALY - WHO2002.svg|thumb|[[Disability-adjusted life year]] for endocrine disorders per 100,000&nbsp;inhabitants in 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/entity/healthinfo/statistics/bodgbddeathdalyestimates.xls |title=Mortality and Burden of Disease Estimates for WHO Member States in 2002|format=xls |work=World Health Organization|year=2002 |accessdate=}}</ref>{{refbegin|2}}\n{{legend|#b3b3b3|no data}}\n{{legend|#ffff65|less than 80}}\n{{legend|#fff200|80\u2013160}}\n{{legend|#ffdc00|160\u2013240}}\n{{legend|#ffc600|240\u2013320}}\n{{legend|#ffb000|320\u2013400}}\n{{legend|#ff9a00|400\u2013480}}\n{{legend|#ff8400|480\u2013560}}\n{{legend|#ff6e00|560\u2013640}}\n{{legend|#ff5800|640\u2013720}}\n{{legend|#ff4200|720\u2013800}}\n{{legend|#ff2c00|800\u20131000}}\n{{legend|#cb0000|more than 1000}}\n{{refend}}]]\n{{Main|Endocrine diseases}}\n[[Endocrine diseases|Diseases of the endocrine glands]] are common,<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Kasper\n  | title = Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine\n  | publisher = [[McGraw Hill]]\n  | year = 2005 \n  | pages = 2074\n  | isbn =978-0-07-139140-5\n   }}</ref> including conditions such as [[diabetes mellitus]], [[thyroid]] disease, and [[obesity]].\n\nEndocrine disease is characterized by irregulated hormone release (a productive [[pituitary adenoma]]), inappropriate response to signaling  ([[hypothyroidism]]), lack of a gland ([[diabetes mellitus type 1]], diminished [[erythropoiesis]] in [[chronic kidney failure]]), or structural enlargement in a critical site such as the thyroid ([[toxic multinodular goitre]]). Hypofunction of endocrine glands can occur as a result of loss of reserve, hyposecretion, [[agenesis]], atrophy, or active destruction. Hyperfunction can occur as a result of hypersecretion, loss of suppression, [[hyperplasia|hyperplastic]] or [[neoplastic]] change, or hyperstimulation.\n\nEndocrinopathies are classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary. Primary endocrine disease inhibits the action of downstream glands. Secondary endocrine disease is indicative of a problem with the pituitary gland. Tertiary endocrine disease is associated with dysfunction of the hypothalamus and its releasing hormones.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nAs the [[Thyroid cancer|thyroid]], and hormones have been implicated in signaling distant tissues to proliferate, for example, the [[estrogen receptor]] has been shown to be involved in certain [[breast cancer]]s.

The series is based on the [[Lynn Aloysius Belvedere]] character created by Gwen Davenport for her 1947 novel ''Belvedere'', which was later adapted into the 1948 film ''[[Sitting Pretty (1948 film)|Sitting Pretty]]''.<ref name=gwen>{{cite news| title=Gwen Davenport, 92, 'Belvedere' Author| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/15/arts/gwen-davenport-92-belvedere-author.html| work=[[The New York Times]]| date=April 15, 2002| accessdate=December 13, 2013}}</ref> The sitcom stars [[Christopher Hewett]] in the title role, who takes a job as a butler with an American family headed by George Owens, played by [[Bob Uecker]].\n\n==Premise==\nThe series follows posh butler Lynn Belvedere as he struggles to adapt to the Owens household. The breadwinner, George ([[Bob Uecker]]), is a [[sportswriter]] (however, in the [[pilot episode|pilot]], he worked in construction). His wife Marsha ([[Ilene Graff]]) is attending law school. At the show's start, older son Kevin ([[Rob Stone (actor)|Rob Stone]]) is a senior in high school, daughter Heather ([[Tracy Wells]]) is a freshman, and Wesley ([[Brice Beckham]]) is in elementary school. Over the course of the series, George becomes a [[sportscaster]] (a career shared with Uecker, who balanced his role as the longtime play-by-play announcer for the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] while starring in the series), Marsha graduates from law school and starts a career as a lawyer, Kevin leaves for college and gets his own apartment, Heather moves up in high school, and Wesley moves up to junior high.\n\nSeveral episodes deal with the relationship between Wesley and Mr. Belvedere, who are always at odds with each other, with Wesley constantly antagonizing Belvedere. It is shown that deep down, however, they really love each other. In season two's \"Wesley's Friend\" \u2013 one of the series' many [[very special episode]]s \u2013 Danny, one of Wesley's classmates, contracts [[HIV]] via [[Factor VIII]] treatment for [[hemophilia]] (the same way [[Ryan White]] contracted HIV). Danny is taken out of school due to the ignorance and uncertainty that is shared by the parents of many of the other children at Wesley's school. After hearing rumors from his friends about how HIV can be spread, leading them to shun him if he keeps spending time with Danny, Wesley begins to avoid Danny in fear of getting the disease himself. Mr. Belvedere is there for him and the child, and he helps Wesley to shed his fear of the boy and publicly accept him as his friend.\n\nThroughout the series, Mr. Belvedere serves as a mentor of sorts to Wesley as well as to the other children. Being a cultured man with many skills and achievements (having even once worked for [[Winston Churchill]]), he also comes to serve as some sort of a \"counselor\" to the Owens clan, helping them solve their dilemmas and stay out of mischief.  Mr Belvedere is the only one who can tame Wesley.\n\nEach episode, except \"Deportation Part 1\" (Season 3) and \"The Counselor\" (Season 4), ends with Mr. Belvedere writing in his journal, recounting the events of the day (which is heard by the audience via his narration) with the Owens family and what he gets out of it in terms of a lesson.\n\nA frequent gag on the show involves Heather's air-headed best friend Angela ([[Michele Matheson]]), who almost always mispronounces Mr. Belvedere's name (such as calling him \"Mr. [[Bumper sticker|Bumpersticker]]\", \"Mr. [[Bell pepper|Bellpepper]]\", \"Mr. [[Butterfinger]]\" or \"Mr. [[Velveeta]]\"). Belvedere's penchant for junk food is shown in many episodes, often being playfully mocked by other characters. Another frequent gag involves George and Mr. Belvedere butting heads, with George being annoyed with his \"nosy English housekeeper\" always interfering. Yet another recurring gag features George always trying to be initiated into a local charity club, the \"Happy Guys of Pittsburgh\". Wesley's highly acrimonious relationship with the never-seen next door neighbors, the Hufnagels, and the shenanigans he pulls on them is another recurring plot element.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nThe character of Lynn Belvedere was originally created by Gwen Leys Davenport in her 1947 novel, ''Belvedere''. The following year, the title character was portrayed by [[Clifton Webb]] in the film ''[[Sitting Pretty (1948 film)|Sitting Pretty]]'', which told the story of an arrogant genius who answers an employment ad for a [[babysitter]] for three bratty kids. He accepts such employment because he is secretly writing a novel about a community filled with gossips and busybodies. Webb's performance in the film earned him an [[Academy Award]] nomination for Best Actor, and he reprised the role in two more movies, ''[[Mr. Belvedere Goes to College]]'' (1949) and ''[[Mr. Belvedere Rings the Bell]]'' (1951).<ref name=gwen />\n\nAs early as the 1950s, attempts were made to adapt the character to television.

According to Dungan and Stein, Pittsburgh was chosen as the show's setting because \"It was either Pittsburgh or [[Paris]] and Paris doesn't have the [[Pittsburgh Penguins|Penguins]]... we wanted someplace with seasons and sporting activity... A city kinda going through a resurgence... with character and traditions that is moving into the '80s, a blue collar community that is moving into the up and coming, yet with the traditional spirit of the country. From everything we've read, Pittsburgh is moving into high tech.\"\n\nWeeks after choosing Pittsburgh, the city was named by [[Rand-McNally]] as the most livable American city, \"national publicity\" that the producers promised to use. Both Dungan (who hailed from [[Philadelphia]]) and Stein (who is from [[Cleveland]]) admitted to never having been to Pittsburgh prior to developing the series, though Dungan's sister attended [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. \"I remember for four years she talked about how Pittsburgh was changing, and about how different it was from Philadelphia.\" Stein admitted that early on, \"we thought about setting the show in Cleveland, but that's too jokey\" and that \"we're not doing Pittsburgh jokes. We like Pittsburgh. We like the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. That's a classy ballclub. And we like [[Willie Stargell]].\" No scenes from the pilot nor the first season's six episodes were shot in Pennsylvania, however the producers promised if they \"get picked up for fall [1985\u201386] we'll probably come to Pittsburgh.\"<ref name=holsopple>{{cite news| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Z4kcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=z2IEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5523,4976703&dq=mr+belvedere+pittsburgh+dungan+stein&hl=en| title=Pittsburgh Gets a TV Series| last=Holsopple| first=Barbara| date=March 10, 1985| work=[[Pittsburgh Press|The Pittsburgh Press]]| page=5| accessdate=April 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe producers educated themselves on Pittsburgh locales with a promotional calendar provided by the Pittsburgh Media Group (PMG), a consortium of public officials and [[Western Pennsylvania]] media.

In the original pilot, an unidentified studio vocalist sang the theme.\n\nThe song was composed in 1984 for a rejected [[television pilot]] called ''Help'' (which was later resurrected in 1987 as ''[[Marblehead Manor]]'', produced by [[Paramount Television]] and aired in [[first-run syndication]]).  With a minor lyrical rewrite (changing the word \"''arrivals''\" to \"''arrival''\"), it quickly became the theme song to ''Mr. Belvedere''.<ref>{{cite web| title=Bio| url=http://www.garyportnoy.com/bio/| publisher=GaryPortnoy.com}}</ref> In 2007, Portnoy released a never-before-heard full-length version of the theme on his CD, ''Destiny''.\n\nThe show used four different closing themes during its original run:\n# The Pilot and early ABC promos of the show used a rock version of the main theme, with a guitar lead.\n# Seasons 1 and 2 and one Season 3 episode featured an instrumental version of the theme song.\n# Season 3 featured a [[Dixieland]] rendition of the ending theme.\n# Seasons 4-6 employed a jazzier rendition of the ending theme.\n\n===Opening credits===\n\n====First version (Pilot)====\n\nThis sequence consisted of a purple family portrait book, with pictures of the cast (including a picture of George at his Construction job), set to the original version of theme song. This version was only used on the original unaired version of the pilot; the broadcast version used the second variation (see below). It surfaced on Antenna TV in 2015.\n\n====Second version (Season one)====\n\nSimilar to the original unaired Pilot, but now with a beige family portrait book, some of the cast pictures changed (most notably, George at his Construction job), and Leon Redbone singing the theme. The Redbone version would be used in all subsequent variations of the opening. On the Shout! Factory DVDs of Seasons One & Two, this was only seen on the broadcast version of the Pilot.\n\n====Third version (Season two)====\n\nThe opening was overhauled completely beginning with this season. It begins with a stock photo of a British palace, and then zooms in to Mr. Belvedere himself. It was then followed by Belvedere as different people (including a Man on Safari), followed by photos and clips from season one episodes, as well as general photos of the cast from said season. On the Shout! Factory DVDs of Seasons One & Two, this version was kept as is on all the season two episodes, but plastered the season one opening on episodes 2-7. In addition, the show adopted its familiar logo.\n\n====Fourth version (Seasons three through six)====\n\nThe opening was overhauled completely once more in season three. Now, it began with Mr. Belvedere writing in his journal, followed by the camera zooming in to the fictional World Focus magazine, with Belvedere on the front cover for the title card. It was then followed by edited images of Belevedere with famous people from around the world. The photos were updated to reflect how the cast looked in season three, and most of the season one clips were now replaced with scenes from season two episodes. In Season four, the opening was updated to feature new positions of Tracy Wells on the couch. In Season six, it was updated once more to feature clips from season five episodes, and new positions of Brice Beckham on the couch. A short 30 second version was also created, as well. In early Syndication reruns, the short season four/five opening was used on all the episodes, with the exception of season six; early reruns of season six used the short open from said season.\n\n==Ratings and cancellation==\n''Mr. Belvedere'' did not place within [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]]'s Top 30 shows at any time during its six-season run; however it did have a relatively solid ratings base, and often won its time slot.\n\nIts first season (1985) was exempt from the Nielsen ratings as it aired too few episodes before the end of April to be counted.<ref name=\"s1\">{{cite news| title='Dynasty' Ends As No. 1 Series| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8XVEAAAAIBAJ&sjid=dbIMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2365,4460340&dq=primetime+nielsen+ratings+1984&hl=en| date=April 27, 1985| work=[[The Albany Herald]]| page=2B| accessdate=April 25, 2013}}</ref> In its second season (1985\u201386), the series ranked at #45 with a 14.8 rating.<ref>{{cite news| title=Season's Final Ratings| work=[[Sun-Sentinel|Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel]]| page=4E| date=April 23, 1986}}</ref>\n\nDuring season three (1986\u201387), the show fell to 51st place with a 13.7 rating.<ref>{{cite news| title=Year-end ratings| work=[[USA Today]]| page=3D| date=April 22, 1987}}</ref> At the end of the 1986-87 season, ABC decided to cancel the show after three seasons,<ref>{{cite news| title=Parton Show Heads 8 New ABC Fall Series| date=May 16, 1987| work=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]] |page=C1}}</ref> but negative feedback from fans of the series led the network to reverse its decision and order a fourth season that debuted in October 1987.<ref>{{cite web| title=Thank you, ABC, for bringing back \"Mr. Belvedere\"...| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-12-20/news/tv-29829_1_san-pedro-christopher-hewett-mr-belvedere| date=December 20, 1987| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]| accessdate=April 25, 2013}}</ref> In season four (1987\u201388), the show fell to 64th place and an 11.5 rating for the year.<ref>{{cite news| title=Final rankings for the 1987-'88 season| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Df4lAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-vMFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1962,6182197&dq=mr+belvedere+ratings+1987-88&hl=en| work=[[The Miami News]]| page=3C| date=April 20, 1988| accessdate=April 25, 2013}}</ref> For its fifth season (1988\u201389), the show rose to a 12.2 rating, placing it at #47 for the season.<ref>{{cite news| title=Poking Around Through the Rubble Of the 1988-89 Television Season| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YkxTAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QIQDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7054,4727603&dq=poking+around+through+the+rubble+of+the+1988-89+television+season&hl=en| first=Joseph| last=Walker| work=[[The Deseret News]]| page=6C| date=April 26, 1989| accessdate=April 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\nFor its sixth and final season (1989\u201390), ''Mr. Belvedere'' left its longtime Friday night slot (which began its evolution into the long-running [[TGIF (ABC)|TGIF]] block that season) and was moved to 8:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] on Saturday nights.

Believing that Belvedere has kidnapped his family and for some reason wants him dead, Peter rampages across town in an effort to destroy him and save his family.

The series is based on the [[Lynn Aloysius Belvedere]] character created by Gwen Davenport for her 1947 novel ''Belvedere'', which was later adapted into the 1948 film ''[[Sitting Pretty (1948 film)|Sitting Pretty]]''.<ref name=gwen>{{cite news| title=Gwen Davenport, 92, 'Belvedere' Author| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/15/arts/gwen-davenport-92-belvedere-author.html| work=[[The New York Times]]| date=April 15, 2002| accessdate=December 13, 2013}}</ref> The sitcom stars [[Christopher Hewett]] in the title role, who takes a job as a butler with an American family headed by George Owens, played by [[Bob Uecker]].\n\n==Premise==\nThe series follows posh butler Lynn Belvedere as he struggles to adapt to the Owens household. The breadwinner, George ([[Bob Uecker]]), is a [[sportswriter]] (however, in the [[pilot episode|pilot]], he worked in construction). His wife Marsha ([[Ilene Graff]]) is attending law school. At the show's start, older son Kevin ([[Rob Stone (actor)|Rob Stone]]) is a senior in high school, daughter Heather ([[Tracy Wells]]) is a freshman, and Wesley ([[Brice Beckham]]) is in elementary school. Over the course of the series, George becomes a [[sportscaster]] (a career shared with Uecker, who balanced his role as the longtime play-by-play announcer for the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] while starring in the series), Marsha graduates from law school and starts a career as a lawyer, Kevin leaves for college and gets his own apartment, Heather moves up in high school, and Wesley moves up to junior high.\n\nSeveral episodes deal with the relationship between Wesley and Mr. Belvedere, who are always at odds with each other, with Wesley constantly antagonizing Belvedere. It is shown that deep down, however, they really love each other. In season two's \"Wesley's Friend\" \u2013 one of the series' many [[very special episode]]s \u2013 Danny, one of Wesley's classmates, contracts [[HIV]] via [[Factor VIII]] treatment for [[hemophilia]] (the same way [[Ryan White]] contracted HIV). Danny is taken out of school due to the ignorance and uncertainty that is shared by the parents of many of the other children at Wesley's school. After hearing rumors from his friends about how HIV can be spread, leading them to shun him if he keeps spending time with Danny, Wesley begins to avoid Danny in fear of getting the disease himself. Mr. Belvedere is there for him and the child, and he helps Wesley to shed his fear of the boy and publicly accept him as his friend.\n\nThroughout the series, Mr. Belvedere serves as a mentor of sorts to Wesley as well as to the other children. Being a cultured man with many skills and achievements (having even once worked for [[Winston Churchill]]), he also comes to serve as some sort of a \"counselor\" to the Owens clan, helping them solve their dilemmas and stay out of mischief.  Mr Belvedere is the only one who can tame Wesley.\n\nEach episode, except \"Deportation Part 1\" (Season 3) and \"The Counselor\" (Season 4), ends with Mr. Belvedere writing in his journal, recounting the events of the day (which is heard by the audience via his narration) with the Owens family and what he gets out of it in terms of a lesson.\n\nA frequent gag on the show involves Heather's air-headed best friend Angela ([[Michele Matheson]]), who almost always mispronounces Mr. Belvedere's name (such as calling him \"Mr. [[Bumper sticker|Bumpersticker]]\", \"Mr. [[Bell pepper|Bellpepper]]\", \"Mr. [[Butterfinger]]\" or \"Mr. [[Velveeta]]\"). Belvedere's penchant for junk food is shown in many episodes, often being playfully mocked by other characters. Another frequent gag involves George and Mr. Belvedere butting heads, with George being annoyed with his \"nosy English housekeeper\" always interfering. Yet another recurring gag features George always trying to be initiated into a local charity club, the \"Happy Guys of Pittsburgh\". Wesley's highly acrimonious relationship with the never-seen next door neighbors, the Hufnagels, and the shenanigans he pulls on them is another recurring plot element.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nThe character of Lynn Belvedere was originally created by Gwen Leys Davenport in her 1947 novel, ''Belvedere''. The following year, the title character was portrayed by [[Clifton Webb]] in the film ''[[Sitting Pretty (1948 film)|Sitting Pretty]]'', which told the story of an arrogant genius who answers an employment ad for a [[babysitter]] for three bratty kids. He accepts such employment because he is secretly writing a novel about a community filled with gossips and busybodies. Webb's performance in the film earned him an [[Academy Award]] nomination for Best Actor, and he reprised the role in two more movies, ''[[Mr. Belvedere Goes to College]]'' (1949) and ''[[Mr. Belvedere Rings the Bell]]'' (1951).<ref name=gwen />\n\nAs early as the 1950s, attempts were made to adapt the character to television. Three [[television pilot|pilots]] for a proposed series based on the Belvedere character were made during the 1950s and 1960s; a 1956 attempt starring [[Reginald Gardiner]],<ref name=marsh>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w8KztFy6QYwC&dq=%22three+attempts+to+produce+a+series%22&pg=PA904#v=onepage&f=false |first1=Tim |last1=Brooks |first2=Earle |last2=Marsh |title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows - 1946-Present (Ninth edition) |year=2007 |page=904 |publisher=Ballantine Books |section=Mr. Belvedere |isbn=978-0-345-49773-4 |accessdate=28 June 2018}}</ref> a 1959 effort with [[Hans Conried]],<ref name=\"marsh\"/> and a 1965 version starring [[Victor Buono]] in the title role.<ref name=\"marsh\"/> All efforts, however, were unsuccessful until 1985, when ABC picked up ''Mr. Belvedere'' to series to serve as a [[mid-season replacement]], with British actor [[Christopher Hewett]] playing Lynn Belvedere.<ref name=\"proctor\">{{cite news| title=Mr. Belvedere at your service| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZmFPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=I5ADAAAAIBAJ&pg=1744,3306822&dq=mr+belvedere+cancel&hl=en| first=Melanie| last=Proctor| work=[[New Straits Times]]| page=14| date=July 14, 1988| accessdate=April 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Pre-production===\nThe series' co-creators and [[executive producer]]s, Frank Dungan and Jeff Stein, pitched the series as \"a very elegant, very British sophisticate hired to restore order to a chaotic household in a [[Pittsburgh]] suburb.\" The show eventually developed with an upper-middle-class family in suburban [[Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania|Beaver Falls]], [[Pennsylvania]]. According to Dungan and Stein, Pittsburgh was chosen as the show's setting because \"It was either Pittsburgh or [[Paris]] and Paris doesn't have the [[Pittsburgh Penguins|Penguins]]... we wanted someplace with seasons and sporting activity... A city kinda going through a resurgence... with character and traditions that is moving into the '80s, a blue collar community that is moving into the up and coming, yet with the traditional spirit of the country. From everything we've read, Pittsburgh is moving into high tech.\"\n\nWeeks after choosing Pittsburgh, the city was named by [[Rand-McNally]] as the most livable American city, \"national publicity\" that the producers promised to use. Both Dungan (who hailed from [[Philadelphia]]) and Stein (who is from [[Cleveland]]) admitted to never having been to Pittsburgh prior to developing the series, though Dungan's sister attended [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. \"I remember for four years she talked about how Pittsburgh was changing, and about how different it was from Philadelphia.\" Stein admitted that early on, \"we thought about setting the show in Cleveland, but that's too jokey\" and that \"we're not doing Pittsburgh jokes. We like Pittsburgh. We like the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. That's a classy ballclub. And we like [[Willie Stargell]].\" No scenes from the pilot nor the first season's six episodes were shot in Pennsylvania, however the producers promised if they \"get picked up for fall [1985\u201386] we'll probably come to Pittsburgh.\"<ref name=holsopple>{{cite news| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Z4kcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=z2IEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5523,4976703&dq=mr+belvedere+pittsburgh+dungan+stein&hl=en| title=Pittsburgh Gets a TV Series| last=Holsopple| first=Barbara| date=March 10, 1985| work=[[Pittsburgh Press|The Pittsburgh Press]]| page=5| accessdate=April 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe producers educated themselves on Pittsburgh locales with a promotional calendar provided by the Pittsburgh Media Group (PMG), a consortium of public officials and [[Western Pennsylvania]] media. Dungan and Stein used it for story ideas during season one after the PMG pitched several studio groups in Los Angeles in January 1985. \"People were impressed... the calendar has Pittsburgh scenes for each month. The [[Allegheny County Courthouse|Bridge of Sighs]] is February. The [[PPG Place|PPG Building]] is March. [[Three Rivers Stadium]] gets three months.\"<ref name=holsopple />\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Main cast===\n* [[Christopher Hewett]] as Mr. Lynn Belvedere\n* [[Ilene Graff]] as Marsha Cameron Owens\n* [[Rob Stone (actor)|Rob Stone]] as Kevin Owens\n* [[Tracy Wells]] as Heather Owens\n* [[Brice Beckham]] as Wesley T. Owens\n* [[Bob Uecker]] as George Owens\n\n===Recurring cast===\n* [[Casey Ellison]] as Miles Knobnoster, Wesley's best friend, who is always the butt of jokes due to his [[orthodontic headgear]].\n* [[Michele Matheson]] as Angela Shostakovich, Heather's somewhat dimwitted best friend, who always mispronounces Mr. Belvedere's name. \n* Raleigh Bond as Burt Hammond, bombastic and overly talkative chief spokesman and membership director for the Happy Guys of Pittsburgh, a local men's club; he is always trying to recruit George as a member. His final appearance was in the season five episode \"Stakeout,\" as Bond died eight months after the show was taped.\n* [[Jack Dodson]] as Carl Butlam, Mr. Hammond's obsequious assistant. \n* [[Winifred Freedman]] as Wendy, Kevin's overweight, geeky and self-conscious high school friend who has a crush on him.\n* [[Robert Goulet]], legendary singer and actor, who plays himself. Occasionally sings duets with Marsha. George finds him to be irritating.\n* Norman Bartold as Skip Hollings, George's co-anchor at the television station. Prior to the character's first appearance in season four, Bartold played as a hotel clerk in a season three episode.\n* [[Willie Garson]] as Carl, Kevin's best friend, who's always dragging Kevin into one of his schemes. \n* [[Patti Yasutake]] (or by Maggie Han in some episodes) as Tami, one of George's co-anchors at the television station.\n* Laura Mooney as Marjorie, a Junior High student, and one of Wesley's love interests during the final season. Prior to playing the character in season six, Mooney appeared as \"Roberta\" in a season four episode.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Mr. Belvedere episodes}}\n{{:List of Mr. Belvedere episodes}}\n\n==Theme song and opening sequence==\nThe show's [[theme song]], \"According to Our New Arrival,\" was performed by [[ragtime]] singer [[Leon Redbone]]. It was written by Judy Hart-Angelo and [[Gary Portnoy]],<ref>{{cite book| title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946\u2013Present| publisher=Ballantine Books| first1=Tim| last1=Brooks| first2=Earle F.| last2=Marsh| date=October 17, 2007| edition=9| pages=903| isbn=978-0345497734}}</ref> who also co-wrote the theme songs to ''[[Cheers]]'' and ''[[Punky Brewster]]''. In the original pilot, an unidentified studio vocalist sang the theme.\n\nThe song was composed in 1984 for a rejected [[television pilot]] called ''Help'' (which was later resurrected in 1987 as ''[[Marblehead Manor]]'', produced by [[Paramount Television]] and aired in [[first-run syndication]]).  With a minor lyrical rewrite (changing the word \"''arrivals''\" to \"''arrival''\"), it quickly became the theme song to ''Mr. Belvedere''.<ref>{{cite web| title=Bio| url=http://www.garyportnoy.com/bio/| publisher=GaryPortnoy.com}}</ref> In 2007, Portnoy released a never-before-heard full-length version of the theme on his CD, ''Destiny''.\n\nThe show used four different closing themes during its original run:\n# The Pilot and early ABC promos of the show used a rock version of the main theme, with a guitar lead.\n# Seasons 1 and 2 and one Season 3 episode featured an instrumental version of the theme song.\n# Season 3 featured a [[Dixieland]] rendition of the ending theme.\n# Seasons 4-6 employed a jazzier rendition of the ending theme.\n\n===Opening credits===\n\n====First version (Pilot)====\n\nThis sequence consisted of a purple family portrait book, with pictures of the cast (including a picture of George at his Construction job), set to the original version of theme song. This version was only used on the original unaired version of the pilot; the broadcast version used the second variation (see below). It surfaced on Antenna TV in 2015.\n\n====Second version (Season one)====\n\nSimilar to the original unaired Pilot, but now with a beige family portrait book, some of the cast pictures changed (most notably, George at his Construction job), and Leon Redbone singing the theme. The Redbone version would be used in all subsequent variations of the opening. On the Shout! Factory DVDs of Seasons One & Two, this was only seen on the broadcast version of the Pilot.\n\n====Third version (Season two)====\n\nThe opening was overhauled completely beginning with this season. It begins with a stock photo of a British palace, and then zooms in to Mr. Belvedere himself. It was then followed by Belvedere as different people (including a Man on Safari), followed by photos and clips from season one episodes, as well as general photos of the cast from said season. On the Shout! Factory DVDs of Seasons One & Two, this version was kept as is on all the season two episodes, but plastered the season one opening on episodes 2-7. In addition, the show adopted its familiar logo.\n\n====Fourth version (Seasons three through six)====\n\nThe opening was overhauled completely once more in season three. Now, it began with Mr. Belvedere writing in his journal, followed by the camera zooming in to the fictional World Focus magazine, with Belvedere on the front cover for the title card. It was then followed by edited images of Belevedere with famous people from around the world. The photos were updated to reflect how the cast looked in season three, and most of the season one clips were now replaced with scenes from season two episodes. In Season four, the opening was updated to feature new positions of Tracy Wells on the couch. In Season six, it was updated once more to feature clips from season five episodes, and new positions of Brice Beckham on the couch. A short 30 second version was also created, as well. In early Syndication reruns, the short season four/five opening was used on all the episodes, with the exception of season six; early reruns of season six used the short open from said season.\n\n==Ratings and cancellation==\n''Mr. Belvedere'' did not place within [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]]'s Top 30 shows at any time during its six-season run; however it did have a relatively solid ratings base, and often won its time slot.\n\nIts first season (1985) was exempt from the Nielsen ratings as it aired too few episodes before the end of April to be counted.<ref name=\"s1\">{{cite news| title='Dynasty' Ends As No. 1 Series| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8XVEAAAAIBAJ&sjid=dbIMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2365,4460340&dq=primetime+nielsen+ratings+1984&hl=en| date=April 27, 1985| work=[[The Albany Herald]]| page=2B| accessdate=April 25, 2013}}</ref> In its second season (1985\u201386), the series ranked at #45 with a 14.8 rating.<ref>{{cite news| title=Season's Final Ratings| work=[[Sun-Sentinel|Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel]]| page=4E| date=April 23, 1986}}</ref>\n\nDuring season three (1986\u201387), the show fell to 51st place with a 13.7 rating.<ref>{{cite news| title=Year-end ratings| work=[[USA Today]]| page=3D| date=April 22, 1987}}</ref> At the end of the 1986-87 season, ABC decided to cancel the show after three seasons,<ref>{{cite news| title=Parton Show Heads 8 New ABC Fall Series| date=May 16, 1987| work=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]] |page=C1}}</ref> but negative feedback from fans of the series led the network to reverse its decision and order a fourth season that debuted in October 1987.<ref>{{cite web| title=Thank you, ABC, for bringing back \"Mr. Belvedere\"...| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-12-20/news/tv-29829_1_san-pedro-christopher-hewett-mr-belvedere| date=December 20, 1987| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]| accessdate=April 25, 2013}}</ref> In season four (1987\u201388), the show fell to 64th place and an 11.5 rating for the year.<ref>{{cite news| title=Final rankings for the 1987-'88 season| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Df4lAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-vMFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1962,6182197&dq=mr+belvedere+ratings+1987-88&hl=en| work=[[The Miami News]]| page=3C| date=April 20, 1988| accessdate=April 25, 2013}}</ref> For its fifth season (1988\u201389), the show rose to a 12.2 rating, placing it at #47 for the season.<ref>{{cite news| title=Poking Around Through the Rubble Of the 1988-89 Television Season| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YkxTAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QIQDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7054,4727603&dq=poking+around+through+the+rubble+of+the+1988-89+television+season&hl=en| first=Joseph| last=Walker| work=[[The Deseret News]]| page=6C| date=April 26, 1989| accessdate=April 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\nFor its sixth and final season (1989\u201390), ''Mr. Belvedere'' left its longtime Friday night slot (which began its evolution into the long-running [[TGIF (ABC)|TGIF]] block that season) and was moved to 8:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] on Saturday nights.

With the creation of Jackson County, it became the [[county seat]], a role which was transferred to nearby Medford in 1927.\n\nJacksonville was home to the first [[Chinatown]] in Oregon, founded by immigrants from [[San Francisco]]. Physical evidence of this chapter of history was uncovered early in March 2004 when road work uncovered artifacts dating to the 1850s and 1860s. Construction was halted while archeologists performed four days of rescue excavations. Their findings included broken Chinese bowls and tea cups, handmade bottles, and fragments of [[opium]] paraphernalia and [[Chinese coins]].\n\nAs the gold deposits were worked out in the 1860s and the railway bypassed Jacksonville in 1884, the city's economy slowed. This had the unintended benefit of preserving a number of structures, which led to Jacksonville's being designated a [[National Historic Landmark|National Historic District]] in 1966, covering over 100 buildings. It was cited as a \"mid-19th century inland commercial city significant for its magnificent group of surviving unaltered commercial and residential buildings. The city was the principal financial center of [[southern Oregon]] until it was bypassed by the railroad.\"\n\n==Geography==\nJacksonville is in west-central Jackson County, {{convert|5|mi|0}} west of Medford in the valley of Jackson Creek at the base of Miller Mountain.

With the creation of Jackson County, it became the [[county seat]], a role which was transferred to nearby Medford in 1927.\n\nJacksonville was home to the first [[Chinatown]] in Oregon, founded by immigrants from [[San Francisco]]. Physical evidence of this chapter of history was uncovered early in March 2004 when road work uncovered artifacts dating to the 1850s and 1860s. Construction was halted while archeologists performed four days of rescue excavations. Their findings included broken Chinese bowls and tea cups, handmade bottles, and fragments of [[opium]] paraphernalia and [[Chinese coins]].\n\nAs the gold deposits were worked out in the 1860s and the railway bypassed Jacksonville in 1884, the city's economy slowed. This had the unintended benefit of preserving a number of structures, which led to Jacksonville's being designated a [[National Historic Landmark|National Historic District]] in 1966, covering over 100 buildings. It was cited as a \"mid-19th century inland commercial city significant for its magnificent group of surviving unaltered commercial and residential buildings. The city was the principal financial center of [[southern Oregon]] until it was bypassed by the railroad.\"\n\n==Geography==\nJacksonville is in west-central Jackson County, {{convert|5|mi|0}} west of Medford in the valley of Jackson Creek at the base of Miller Mountain.

The paldong is made of [[bamboo]]. Its upper edge is cut away obliquely from the backside, and then cut away slightly from the frontside. The player's lower lip is placed against the cut away surface. The paldong is open at both ends, with a total of four finger holes; three in front, one at the back.\n\nThe melodies played on the lip-valley flute are mostly improvisatory.

Kea can solve logical puzzles, such as pushing and pulling things in a certain order to get to food, and will work together to achieve a certain objective.]]\n'''Bird intelligence''' deals with the definition of [[intelligence]] and its measurement as applied to [[bird]]s. The difficulty of defining or measuring intelligence in non-human animals makes the subject difficult to study scientifically. In general, birds have relatively large brains compared to their head size. The visual and auditory senses are well developed in most species, though the tactile and olfactory senses are well realized only in a few groups. Birds communicate using visual signals as well as through the use of [[bird vocalization|calls and song]]. The testing of intelligence in birds is therefore usually based on studying responses to sensory stimuli.\n\nThe [[Corvidae|corvid]]s ([[raven]]s, [[crow]]s, [[jay]]s, [[magpie]]s, etc.) and [[Psittaciformes|psittacines]] ([[parrot]]s, [[macaw]]s, and [[cockatoo]]s) are often considered the most intelligent birds, and among the most intelligent animals in general; [[pigeon]]s, [[finch]]es, [[domestic fowl]], and [[birds of prey]] have also been common subjects of intelligence studies.\n\n==Studies==\n[[File:FishingCormorants.jpg|thumb|[[Cormorant]]s used by fishermen in Southeast Asia may be able to count]]\nBird intelligence has been studied through several attributes and abilities. Many of these studies have been on birds such as [[quail]], [[domestic fowl]], and [[pigeon]]s kept under captive conditions. It has, however, been noted that field studies have been limited, unlike those of the apes. Birds in the crow family ([[corvidae|corvid]]s) as well as parrots ([[Psittaciformes|psittacine]]s) have been shown to live [[sociality|socially]], have long developmental periods, and possess large forebrains, all of which have been hypothesized to allow for greater cognitive abilities.<ref name=emery>{{cite journal | last1 = Emery | first1 = Nathan J. | year = 2006 | title = Cognitive ornithology: the evolution of avian intelligence | journal = Phil.

Writing in the ''Biological Journal of the Linnean Society,'' she reported that, once their quota of seven fish was filled, the birds \"stubbornly refuse to move again until their neck ring is loosened. They ignore an order to dive and even resist a rough push or a knock, sitting glum and motionless on their perches.\" Meanwhile, other birds that had not filled their quotas continued to catch fish as usual. \"One is forced to conclude that these highly intelligent birds can count up to seven,\" she wrote.<ref>Hoh, Erling Hoh (1988) Flying fishes of Wucheng \u2013 fisherman in China use cormorants to catch fish.

In avian research, performance on simple associative learning tasks can be used to assess how cognitive abilities vary with experimental measures.\n\n==== Associative learning vs. reversal learning ====\nBebus ''et al.'' demonstrated that associative learning in [[Florida scrub jay|Florida scrub-jays]] correlated with reversal learning, personality, and baseline hormone levels.<ref name=\":1\" /> To measure associative learning abilities, they associated coloured rings to food rewards. To test reversal learning, the researchers simply reversed the rewarding and non-rewarding colours to see how quickly the scrub-jays would adapt to the new association. Their results suggest that associative learning is negatively correlated to reversal learning.<ref name=\":1\" /> In other words, birds that learned the first association quickly were slower to learn the new association upon reversal. The authors conclude that there must be a trade-off between learning an association and adapting to a new association.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Neophobia ====\nBebus ''et al.'' also showed that reversal learning was correlated with [[neophobia]]: birds that were afraid of a novel environment previously set up by the researchers were faster at reversal learning.<ref name=\":1\" /> The researchers also found an inverse correlation, where less neophobic birds performed better on the associative learning task, although this correlation was not statistically significant. Opposite results were found by Guido ''et al.'',<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Guido|first=Jorgelina Mar\u00eda|last2=Biondi|first2=Laura Marina|last3=Vasallo|first3=Aldo Ivan|last4=Muzio|first4=Rub\u00e9n Nestor|date=2017|title=Neophobia is negatively related to reversal learning ability in females of a generalist bird of prey, the Chimango Caracara, Milvago chimango|journal=Animal Cognition|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=591\u2013602|doi=10.1007/s10071-017-1083-9|pmid=28343269|issn=1435-9448|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4fe6969c884e86e4c38d91853e7cdc4deef062f5}}</ref> who showed that neophobia in ''[[Chimango caracara|Milvago chimango]]'', a bird of prey native to South America, negatively correlated to reversal learning.<ref name=\":4\" /> In other words, neophobic birds were slower at reversal learning. The researchers suggested a modern explanation for this discrepancy: since birds living near urban areas benefit from being less neophobic to feed on human resources (such as detritus), but also benefit from being flexible learners (since human activity fluctuates), perhaps low neophobia [[coevolution|coevolved]] with high reversal learning ability.<ref name=\":4\" /> Therefore, personality alone might be insufficient to predict associative learning due to contextual differences.\n\n==== Hormones ====\nBebus ''et al.'' found a correlation between baseline hormone levels and associative learning. According to their study, low baseline levels of [[corticosterone]] (CORT), a hormone involved in stress response, predicted better associative learning.<ref name=\":1\" /> In contrast, high baseline levels of CORT predicted better reversal learning.<ref name=\":1\" /> In summary, Bebus ''et al.'' found that low neophobia (not statistically significant) and low baseline CORT levels predicted better associative learning abilities. Inversely, high neophobia and high baseline CORT levels predicted better reversal learning abilities.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Diet ====\nIn addition to reversal learning, personality, and hormone levels, further research suggests that diet may also correlate with associative learning performance. Bonaparte ''et al.'' demonstrated that high-protein diets in [[zebra finch]]es correlated with better associative learning.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Bonaparte|first=Kristina M.|last2=Riffle-Yokoi|first2=Christina|last3=Burley|first3=Nancy Tyler|date=2011-09-19|editor-last=Iwaniuk|editor-first=Andrew|title=Getting a Head Start: Diet, Sub-Adult Growth, and Associative Learning in a Seed-Eating Passerine|journal=PLoS ONE|language=en|volume=6|issue=9|pages=e23775|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0023775|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3176201|pmid=21949684|bibcode=2011PLoSO...623775B}}</ref> The researchers showed that high-diet treatment was associated with larger head width, [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]] length, and body mass in the treated males.<ref name=\":2\" /> In subsequent testing, researchers showed that high-diet and larger head-to-tarsus ratio correlated with better performance on an associative learning task.<ref name=\":2\" /> The researchers used associative learning as a correlate of cognition to support that nutritional stress during development can negatively impact cognitive development which in turn may reduce reproductive success.<ref name=\":2\" /> One such way that poor diet may affect reproductive success is through song learning.

They also failed to find a correlation between physiological growth and associative learning.<ref name=\":5\" /> Though Bonaparte ''et al.'' focused on protein content whereas Kriengwatana ''et al.'' focused on quantity of food, the results seem contradictory. Further research should be conducted to clarify the relationship between diet and associative learning.\n\n==== Ecology ====\nAssociative learning may vary across species depending on their ecology. According to Clayton and Krebs, there are differences in associative learning and memory between food-storing and non-storing birds.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Clayton|first=Nicky S.|last2=Krebs|first2=John R.|date=1994|title=One-trial associative memory: comparison of food-storing and nonstoring species of birds|journal=Animal Learning & Behavior|volume=22|issue=4|pages=366\u2013372|doi=10.3758/bf03209155|issn=0090-4996}}</ref> In their experiment, food-storing [[Eurasian jay|jays]] and [[marsh tit]]s and non-storing [[Western jackdaw|jackdaws]] and [[Eurasian blue tit|blue tits]] were introduced to seven sites, one of which contained a food reward. For the first phase of the experiment, the bird randomly searched for the reward between the seven sites, until it found it and was allowed to partially consume the food item. All species performed equally well in this first task. For the second phase of the experiment, the sites were hidden again and the birds had to return to the previously rewarding site to obtain the remainder of the food item. The researchers found that food-storing birds performed better in phase two than non-storing birds.<ref name=\":3\" /> While food-storing birds preferentially returned to the rewarding sites, non-storing birds preferentially returned to previously visited sites, regardless of the presence of a reward.<ref name=\":3\" /> If the food reward was visible in phase one, there was no difference in performance between storers and non-storers.<ref name=\":3\" /> These results show that memory following associative learning, as opposed to just learning itself, can vary with ecological lifestyle.\n\n==== Age ====\nAssociative learning correlates with age in [[Australian magpie]]s according to Mirville ''et al.''<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Mirville|first=Melanie O.|last2=Kelley|first2=Jennifer L.|last3=Ridley|first3=Amanda R.|date=2016|title=Group size and associative learning in the Australian magpie (Cracticus tibicen dorsalis)|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|language=en|volume=70|issue=3|pages=417\u2013427|doi=10.1007/s00265-016-2062-x|issn=0340-5443|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8fbc9aba5e3b7416b04de1716b94b840f1d1172d}}</ref> In their study, the researchers initially wanted to study the effect of group size on learning. However, they found that group size correlated with the likelihood of interaction with the task, but not with associative learning itself. Instead, they found that age played a role on performance: adults were more successful at completing the associative learning task, but less likely to approach the task initially. Inversely, juveniles were less successful at completing the task, but more likely to approach it. Therefore, adults in larger groups were the most likely individuals to complete the task due to their increased likelihood to both approach and succeed on the task.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==== Weight ====\nThough it may seem universally beneficial to be a fast learner, Madden ''et al.'' suggested that the weight of individuals affected whether or not associative learning was adaptive.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Madden|first=Joah R.|last2=Langley|first2=Ellis J.

Associative learning might be more costly on smaller individuals, thus reducing their fitness and leading to maladaptive behaviours.<ref name=\":7\" /> Additionally, Madden ''et al.'' found that slow reversal learning in both groups correlated with low survival rate.<ref name=\":7\" /> The researchers suggested a trade-off hypothesis where the cost of reversal learning would inhibit the development of other cognitive abilities. According to Bebus ''et al.'', there is a negative correlation between associative learning and reversal learning.<ref name=\":1\" /> Perhaps low reversal learning correlates to better survival due to enhanced associative learning. Madden ''et al.'' also suggested this hypothesis but note their skepticism since they could not show the same negative correlation between associative and reversal learning found by Bebus ''et al.''\n\n==== Neural representations ====\nIn their research, Veit ''et al.'' show that associative learning modified [[Avian pallium|NCL]] (nidopallium caudolaterale) neuronal activity in [[Carrion crow|crows]].<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Veit|first=Lena|last2=Pidpruzhnykova|first2=Galyna|last3=Nieder|first3=Andreas|date=2015-12-08|title=Associative learning rapidly establishes neuronal representations of upcoming behavioral choices in crows|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=112|issue=49|pages=15208\u201315213|doi=10.1073/pnas.1509760112|issn=0027-8424|pmc=4679020|pmid=26598669|bibcode=2015PNAS..11215208V}}</ref> To test this, visual cues were presented on a screen for 600ms, followed by a 1000ms delay. After the delay, a red stimulus and a blue stimulus were presented simultaneously and the crows had to choose the correct one. Choosing the correct stimulus was rewarded with a food item. As the crows learned the associations through trial and error, NCL neurons showed increased selective activity for the rewarding stimulus. In other words, a given NCL neuron that fired when the correct stimulus was the red one increased its firing rate selectively when the crow had to choose the red stimulus. This increased firing was observed during the delay period during which the crow was presumably thinking about which stimulus to choose. Additionally, increased NCL activity reflected the crow's increased performance. The researchers suggest that NCL neurons are involved in learning associations as well as making the subsequent behavioural choice for the rewarding stimulus.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== Olfactory associative learning ====\nThough most research is concerned with visual associative learning, Slater and Hauber showed that [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]] are also able to learn associations using olfactory cues.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nelson Slater|first=Melissa|last2=Hauber|first2=Mark E.|date=2017|title=Olfactory enrichment and scent cue associative learning in captive birds of prey|journal=Zoo Biology|language=en|volume=36|issue=2|pages=120\u2013126|doi=10.1002/zoo.21353|pmid=28198048}}</ref> In their study, nine individuals from five species of birds of prey learned to pair a neutral olfactory cue to a food reward.\n\n===Spatial and temporal abilities===\nA common test of intelligence is the ''detour test'', where a glass barrier between the bird and an item such as food is used in the setup. Most mammals discover that the objective is reached by first going away from the target. Whereas domestic fowl fail on this test, many within the crow family are readily able to solve the problem.<ref>Scott, John P.  1972. Animal Behavior. Univ. of Chicago Press. Chicago, Ill. p.  193.</ref>\n\nLarge fruit-eating birds in tropical forests depend on trees which bear fruit at different times of the year.

These are often dependent upon environmental cues. Birds also are sensitive to [[day length]], and this awareness is especially important as a cue for migratory species. The ability to orient themselves during migrations is typically attributed to birds' superior sensory abilities, rather than to intelligence.\n\n===Beat induction===\nResearch published in 2008 that was conducted with an [[Eleonora cockatoo]] named [[Snowball (cockatoo)|Snowball]] has shown that birds can identify the rhythmic beat of man-made music, an ability known as [[beat induction]].<ref>Patel, Aniruddh D.; Iversen, John R.; Bregman, Micah R.; Schulz, Irena & Schulz, Charles (2008\u20132008), \"Investigating the human-specificity of synchronization to music\", Proceedings of the 10th Intl.

A pigeon was trained to look in a mirror to find a response key behind it which it then turned to peck\u2014food was the consequence of a correct choice (i.e., the pigeon learned to use a mirror to find critical elements of its environment). Next, the bird was trained to peck at dots placed on its feathers; food was, again, the consequence of touching the dot. This was done without a mirror. Then a small bib was placed on the pigeon\u2014enough to cover a dot placed on its lower belly. A control period without the mirror yielded no pecking at the dot. But when the mirror was shown, the pigeon became active, looked into it, and then tried to peck on the dot under the bib.\n\nUntrained pigeons have never been able to pass the mirror test. However, pigeons do not normally have access to mirrors and do not have the necessary experiences to use them. Providing an individual pigeon with this experience in no way guaranteed it would pass the mirror test, since the pigeon never pecked dots on its own body in the presence of the mirror until the final test.\n\nDespite this, pigeons are not classified as being able to recognize their reflection, because those that did were trained to do so and the animal must be able to do this without human assistance: it must also be shown that the birds are able to do this in the wild with no experience, just on their own intelligence. But even when an animal is trained to do this, it is still unknown if they are self-aware, or are just repeating the same movements and commands that they were taught so that they may receive a treat as a reward after they have correctly completed their task.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nSome studies have suggested that birds\u2014separated from mammals by over 300 million years of independent evolution\u2014have developed brains capable of primate-like consciousness through a process of [[convergent evolution]].<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/bies.20280 | last1 = Butler | first1 = Ann B. | last2 = Manger | first2 = Paul R. | last3 = Lindahl | first3 = B.I.B. | last4 = \u00c5rhem | first4 = Peter | year = 2005 | title = Evolution of the neural basis of consciousness: a bird\u2013mammal comparison | journal = BioEssays | volume = 27 | issue = 9 | pages = 923\u2013936 | pmid=16108067}}</ref><ref name=BirdzBC06>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/4134586 | pmid = 17062871 | last1 = Butler | first1 = Ann B. | last2 = Cotterill | first2 = Rodney M.J. | year = 2006 | title = Mamillian and avian neuroanatomy and the question of consciousness in birds | journal = The Biological Bulletin | volume = no. 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 106\u2013127 | jstor = 4134586 }}</ref> Although avian brains are structurally very different from the brains of cognitively advanced mammals, each has the neural circuitry associated with higher-level consciousness, according to a 2006 analysis of the neuroanatomy of consciousness in birds and mammals.<ref name=BirdzBC06/> The study acknowledges that similar neural circuitry does not by itself prove consciousness, but notes its consistency with suggestive evidence from experiments on birds\u2019 working and episodic memories, sense of object permanence, and theory of mind {{crossref|selfref=no|(both covered below)}}.<ref name=BirdzBC06/>\n\n===Tool use===\n{{Further|Tool use by animals#In_birds}}[[File:Camarhynchus pallidus composite.jpg|thumb|A woodpecker finch using a stick to impale a grub, with a second image showing it had successfully captured it]]\nMany birds have been shown to be capable of using tools.

While parrots have the distinction of being able to mimic human speech, studies with the [[grey parrot]] have shown that some are able to associate words with their meanings and form simple sentences (see [[Alex (parrot)|Alex]]). Parrots and the corvid family of crows, ravens, and jays are considered the most intelligent of birds. Not surprisingly, research has shown that these species tend to have the largest [[High vocal center|HVC]]s. Dr. Harvey J. Karten, a neuroscientist at [[University of California, San Diego|UCSD]] who has studied the physiology of birds, has discovered that the lower parts of avian brains are similar to those of humans.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n===Social behavior===\n{{further|Bird#Social systems|Social animal}}\nSocial life has been considered a driving force for the evolution of intelligence in various types of animals. Many birds have social organizations, and loose aggregations are common. Many corvid species separate into small family groups or \"clans\" for activities such as nesting and territorial defense. The birds then congregate in massive flocks made up of several different species for migratory purposes. Some birds make use of teamwork while hunting. Predatory birds hunting in pairs have been observed using a \"bait and switch\" technique, whereby one bird will distract the prey while the other swoops in for the kill.\n\nSocial behavior requires individual identification, and most birds appear to be capable of recognizing mates, siblings, and young. Other behaviors such as play and cooperative breeding are also considered indicators of intelligence.\n\nCrows appear to be able to remember who observed them catching food. They also steal food caught by others.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Emery | first1 = N.J. | last2 = Clayton | first2 = N.S. | year = 2004 | title = The mentality of crows: convergent evolution of intelligence in corvids and apes | url = | journal = Science | volume = 306 | issue = 5703| pages = 1903\u20131907 | doi=10.1126/science.1098410| pmid = 15591194 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.299.6596 | bibcode = 2004Sci...306.1903E }}</ref>\n\nIn some [[fairy-wren]]s such as the [[Superb fairy-wren|superb]] and [[Red-backed fairy-wren|red-backed]], males pick flower petals in colors contrasting with their bright [[nuptial]] plumage and present them to others of their species that will acknowledge, inspect, and sometimes manipulate the petals.

Studies have shown that the intricate territorial songs of some birds must be learned at an early age, and that the memory of the song will serve the bird for the rest of its life. Some bird species are able to communicate in several regional varieties of their songs. For example, the [[Saddleback (bird)|New Zealand saddleback]] will learn the different song \"dialects\" of clans of its own species, much as human beings might acquire diverse regional dialects. When a territory-owning male of the species dies, a young male will immediately take his place, singing to prospective mates in the dialect appropriate to the territory he is in.<ref>Environews: Saddleback Dialects, Radio live (2011) http://www.radiolive.co.nz/Environews-Saddleback-Dialects/tabid/506/articleID/20318/Default.aspx</ref> Similarly, around 300 [[Tui (bird)|tui]] songs have been recorded.<ref>The language of love, Auckland Now http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/6740119/The-language-of-love</ref> The greater the competition in the area, it has been suggested, the more likely the birds are to actually create or make their song more complex.<ref>Tui one of world's most intelligent birds, 3 News (2012) http://www.3news.co.nz/Tui-one-of-worlds-most-intelligent-birds/tabid/1160/articleID/254369/Default.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201174404/http://www.3news.co.nz/Tui-one-of-worlds-most-intelligent-birds/tabid/1160/articleID/254369/Default.aspx |date=1 February 2014 }}</ref>\n\nRecent studies indicate that some birds may have an ability to memorize \"syntactic\" patterns of sounds, and that they can be taught to reject the ones determined to be incorrect by the human trainers.

The difficulty of defining or measuring intelligence in non-human animals makes the subject difficult to study scientifically. In general, birds have relatively large brains compared to their head size. The visual and auditory senses are well developed in most species, though the tactile and olfactory senses are well realized only in a few groups. Birds communicate using visual signals as well as through the use of [[bird vocalization|calls and song]]. The testing of intelligence in birds is therefore usually based on studying responses to sensory stimuli.\n\nThe [[Corvidae|corvid]]s ([[raven]]s, [[crow]]s, [[jay]]s, [[magpie]]s, etc.) and [[Psittaciformes|psittacines]] ([[parrot]]s, [[macaw]]s, and [[cockatoo]]s) are often considered the most intelligent birds, and among the most intelligent animals in general; [[pigeon]]s, [[finch]]es, [[domestic fowl]], and [[birds of prey]] have also been common subjects of intelligence studies.\n\n==Studies==\n[[File:FishingCormorants.jpg|thumb|[[Cormorant]]s used by fishermen in Southeast Asia may be able to count]]\nBird intelligence has been studied through several attributes and abilities. Many of these studies have been on birds such as [[quail]], [[domestic fowl]], and [[pigeon]]s kept under captive conditions. It has, however, been noted that field studies have been limited, unlike those of the apes. Birds in the crow family ([[corvidae|corvid]]s) as well as parrots ([[Psittaciformes|psittacine]]s) have been shown to live [[sociality|socially]], have long developmental periods, and possess large forebrains, all of which have been hypothesized to allow for greater cognitive abilities.<ref name=emery>Nathan J.

They ignore an order to dive and even resist a rough push or a knock, sitting glum and motionless on their perches.\" Meanwhile, other birds that had not filled their quotas continued to catch fish as usual. \"One is forced to conclude that these highly intelligent birds can count up to seven,\" she wrote.<ref>Hoh, Erling Hoh (1988) Flying fishes of Wucheng \u2013 fisherman in China use cormorants to catch fish.

In avian research, performance on simple associative learning tasks can be used to assess how cognitive abilities vary with experimental measures.\n\n==== Associative learning vs. reversal learning ====\nBebus ''et al.'' demonstrated that associative learning in [[Florida scrub jay|Florida scrub-jays]] correlated with reversal learning, personality, and baseline hormone levels.<ref name=\":1\" /> To measure associative learning abilities, they associated coloured rings to food rewards. To test reversal learning, the researchers simply reversed the rewarding and non-rewarding colours to see how quickly the scrub-jays would adapt to the new association. Their results suggest that associative learning is negatively correlated to reversal learning.<ref name=\":1\" /> In other words, birds that learned the first association quickly were slower to learn the new association upon reversal. The authors conclude that there must be a trade-off between learning an association and adapting to a new association.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Neophobia ====\nBebus ''et al.'' also showed that reversal learning was correlated with [[neophobia]]: birds that were afraid of a novel environment previously set up by the researchers were faster at reversal learning.<ref name=\":1\" /> The researchers also found an inverse correlation, where less neophobic birds performed better on the associative learning task, although this correlation was not statistically significant. Opposite results were found by Guido ''et al.'',<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Guido|first=Jorgelina Mar\u00eda|last2=Biondi|first2=Laura Marina|last3=Vasallo|first3=Aldo Ivan|last4=Muzio|first4=Rub\u00e9n Nestor|date=2017|title=Neophobia is negatively related to reversal learning ability in females of a generalist bird of prey, the Chimango Caracara, Milvago chimango|journal=Animal Cognition|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=591\u2013602|doi=10.1007/s10071-017-1083-9|pmid=28343269|issn=1435-9448|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4fe6969c884e86e4c38d91853e7cdc4deef062f5}}</ref> who showed that neophobia in ''[[Chimango caracara|Milvago chimango]]'', a bird of prey native to South America, negatively correlated to reversal learning.<ref name=\":4\" /> In other words, neophobic birds were slower at reversal learning. The researchers suggested a modern explanation for this discrepancy: since birds living near urban areas benefit from being less neophobic to feed on human resources (such as detritus), but also benefit from being flexible learners (since human activity fluctuates), perhaps low neophobia [[coevolution|coevolved]] with high reversal learning ability.<ref name=\":4\" /> Therefore, personality alone might be insufficient to predict associative learning due to contextual differences.\n\n==== Hormones ====\nBebus ''et al.'' found a correlation between baseline hormone levels and associative learning. According to their study, low baseline levels of [[corticosterone]] (CORT), a hormone involved in stress response, predicted better associative learning.<ref name=\":1\" /> In contrast, high baseline levels of CORT predicted better reversal learning.<ref name=\":1\" /> In summary, Bebus ''et al.'' found that low neophobia (not statistically significant) and low baseline CORT levels predicted better associative learning abilities. Inversely, high neophobia and high baseline CORT levels predicted better reversal learning abilities.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Diet ====\nIn addition to reversal learning, personality, and hormone levels, further research suggests that diet may also correlate with associative learning performance. Bonaparte ''et al.'' demonstrated that high-protein diets in [[Zebra finch|zebra finches]] correlated with better associative learning.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Bonaparte|first=Kristina M.|last2=Riffle-Yokoi|first2=Christina|last3=Burley|first3=Nancy Tyler|date=2011-09-19|editor-last=Iwaniuk|editor-first=Andrew|title=Getting a Head Start: Diet, Sub-Adult Growth, and Associative Learning in a Seed-Eating Passerine|journal=PLoS ONE|language=en|volume=6|issue=9|pages=e23775|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0023775|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3176201|pmid=21949684|bibcode=2011PLoSO...623775B}}</ref> The researchers showed that high-diet treatment was associated with larger head width, [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]] length, and body mass in the treated males.<ref name=\":2\" /> In subsequent testing, researchers showed that high-diet and larger head-to-tarsus ratio correlated with better performance on an associative learning task.<ref name=\":2\" /> The researchers used associative learning as a correlate of cognition to support that nutritional stress during development can negatively impact cognitive development which in turn may reduce reproductive success.<ref name=\":2\" /> One such way that poor diet may affect reproductive success is through song learning.

They also failed to find a correlation between physiological growth and associative learning.<ref name=\":5\" /> Though Bonaparte ''et al.'' focused on protein content whereas Kriengwatana ''et al.'' focused on quantity of food, the results seem contradictory. Further research should be conducted to clarify the relationship between diet and associative learning.\n\n==== Ecology ====\nAssociative learning may vary across species depending on their ecology. According to Clayton and Krebs, there are differences in associative learning and memory between food-storing and non-storing birds.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Clayton|first=Nicky S.|last2=Krebs|first2=John R.|date=1994|title=One-trial associative memory: comparison of food-storing and nonstoring species of birds|journal=Animal Learning & Behavior|volume=22|issue=4|pages=366\u2013372|doi=10.3758/bf03209155|issn=0090-4996}}</ref> In their experiment, food-storing [[Eurasian jay|jays]] and [[Marsh tit|marsh tits]] and non-storing [[Western jackdaw|jackdaws]] and [[Eurasian blue tit|blue tits]] were introduced to seven sites, one of which contained a food reward. For the first phase of the experiment, the bird randomly searched for the reward between the seven sites, until it found it and was allowed to partially consume the food item. All species performed equally well in this first task. For the second phase of the experiment, the sites were hidden again and the birds had to return to the previously rewarding site to obtain the remainder of the food item. The researchers found that food-storing birds performed better in phase two than non-storing birds.<ref name=\":3\" /> While food-storing birds preferentially returned to the rewarding sites, non-storing birds preferentially returned to previously visited sites, regardless of the presence of a reward.<ref name=\":3\" /> If the food reward was visible in phase one, there was no difference in performance between storers and non-storers.<ref name=\":3\" /> These results show that memory following associative learning, as opposed to just learning itself, can vary with ecological lifestyle.\n\n==== Age ====\nAssociative learning correlates with age in [[Australian magpie]]s according to Mirville ''et al.''<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Mirville|first=Melanie O.|last2=Kelley|first2=Jennifer L.|last3=Ridley|first3=Amanda R.|date=2016|title=Group size and associative learning in the Australian magpie (Cracticus tibicen dorsalis)|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|language=en|volume=70|issue=3|pages=417\u2013427|doi=10.1007/s00265-016-2062-x|issn=0340-5443|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8fbc9aba5e3b7416b04de1716b94b840f1d1172d}}</ref> In their study, the researchers initially wanted to study the effect of group size on learning. However, they found that group size correlated with the likelihood of interaction with the task, but not with associative learning itself. Instead, they found that age played a role on performance: adults were more successful at completing the associative learning task, but less likely to approach the task initially. Inversely, juveniles were less successful at completing the task, but more likely to approach it. Therefore, adults in larger groups were the most likely individuals to complete the task due to their increased likelihood to both approach and succeed on the task.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==== Weight ====\nThough it may seem universally beneficial to be a fast learner, Madden ''et al.'' suggested that the weight of individuals affected whether or not associative learning was adaptive.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Madden|first=Joah R.|last2=Langley|first2=Ellis J.

Associative learning might be more costly on smaller individuals, thus reducing their fitness and leading to maladaptive behaviours.<ref name=\":7\" /> Additionally, Madden ''et al.'' found that slow reversal learning in both groups correlated with low survival rate.<ref name=\":7\" /> The researchers suggested a trade-off hypothesis where the cost of reversal learning would inhibit the development of other cognitive abilities. According to Bebus ''et al.'', there is a negative correlation between associative learning and reversal learning.<ref name=\":1\" /> Perhaps low reversal learning correlates to better survival due to enhanced associative learning. Madden ''et al.'' also suggested this hypothesis but note their skepticism since they could not show the same negative correlation between associative and reversal learning found by Bebus ''et al.''\n\n==== Neural representations ====\nIn their research, Veit ''et al.'' show that associative learning modified [[Avian pallium|NCL]] (nidopallium caudolaterale) neuronal activity in [[Carrion crow|crows]].<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Veit|first=Lena|last2=Pidpruzhnykova|first2=Galyna|last3=Nieder|first3=Andreas|date=2015-12-08|title=Associative learning rapidly establishes neuronal representations of upcoming behavioral choices in crows|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=112|issue=49|pages=15208\u201315213|doi=10.1073/pnas.1509760112|issn=0027-8424|pmc=4679020|pmid=26598669|bibcode=2015PNAS..11215208V}}</ref> To test this, visual cues were presented on a screen for 600ms, followed by a 1000ms delay. After the delay, a red stimulus and a blue stimulus were presented simultaneously and the crows had to choose the correct one. Choosing the correct stimulus was rewarded with a food item. As the crows learned the associations through trial and error, NCL neurons showed increased selective activity for the rewarding stimulus. In other words, a given NCL neuron that fired when the correct stimulus was the red one increased its firing rate selectively when the crow had to choose the red stimulus. This increased firing was observed during the delay period during which the crow was presumably thinking about which stimulus to choose. Additionally, increased NCL activity reflected the crow's increased performance. The researchers suggest that NCL neurons are involved in learning associations as well as making the subsequent behavioural choice for the rewarding stimulus.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== Olfactory associative learning ====\nThough most research is concerned with visual associative learning, Slater and Hauber showed that [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]] are also able to learn associations using olfactory cues.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nelson Slater|first=Melissa|last2=Hauber|first2=Mark E.|date=2017|title=Olfactory enrichment and scent cue associative learning in captive birds of prey|journal=Zoo Biology|language=en|volume=36|issue=2|pages=120\u2013126|doi=10.1002/zoo.21353|pmid=28198048}}</ref> In their study, nine individuals from five species of birds of prey learned to pair a neutral olfactory cue to a food reward.\n\n===Spatial and temporal abilities===\nA common test of intelligence is the ''detour test'', where a glass barrier between the bird and an item such as food is used in the setup. Most mammals discover that the objective is reached by first going away from the target. Whereas domestic fowl fail on this test, many within the crow family are readily able to solve the problem.<ref>Scott, John P.  1972. Animal Behavior. Univ. of Chicago Press. Chicago, Ill. p.  193.</ref>\n\n\nLarge fruit-eating birds in tropical forests depend on trees which bear fruit at different times of the year. Many species, such as pigeons and hornbills, have been shown to be able to decide upon foraging areas according to the time of the year.

These are often dependent upon environmental cues. Birds also are sensitive to [[day length]], and this awareness is especially important as a cue for migratory species. The ability to orient themselves during migrations is typically attributed to birds' superior sensory abilities, rather than to intelligence.\n\n===Beat induction===\nResearch published in 2008 that was conducted with an [[Eleonora cockatoo]] named [[Snowball (cockatoo)|Snowball]] has shown that birds can identify the rhythmic beat of man-made music, an ability known as [[beat induction]].<ref>Patel, Aniruddh D.; Iversen, John R.; Bregman, Micah R.; Schulz, Irena & Schulz, Charles (2008\u20132008), \"Investigating the human-specificity of synchronization to music\", Proceedings of the 10th Intl.

Next, the bird was trained to peck at dots placed on its feathers; food was, again, the consequence of touching the dot. This was done without a mirror. Then a small bib was placed on the pigeon\u2014enough to cover a dot placed on its lower belly. A control period without the mirror yielded no pecking at the dot. But when the mirror was shown, the pigeon became active, looked into it, and then tried to peck on the dot under the bib.\n\nUntrained pigeons have never been able to pass the mirror test. However, pigeons do not normally have access to mirrors and do not have the necessary experiences to use them. Providing an individual pigeon with this experience in no way guaranteed it would pass the mirror test, since the pigeon never pecked dots on its own body in the presence of the mirror until the final test.\n\nDespite this, pigeons are not classified as being able to recognize their reflection, because those that did were trained to do so and the animal must be able to do this without human assistance: it must also be shown that the birds are able to do this in the wild with no experience, just on their own intelligence. But even when an animal is trained to do this, it is still unknown if they are self-aware, or are just repeating the same movements and commands that they were taught so that they may receive a treat as a reward after they have correctly completed their task.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nSome studies have suggested that birds\u2014separated from mammals by over 300 million years of independent evolution\u2014have developed brains capable of primate-like consciousness through a process of [[convergent evolution]].<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/bies.20280 | last1 = Butler | first1 = Ann B. | last2 = Manger | first2 = Paul R. | last3 = Lindahl | first3 = B.I.B. | last4 = \u00c5rhem | first4 = Peter | year = 2005 | title = Evolution of the neural basis of consciousness: a bird\u2013mammal comparison | journal = BioEssays | volume = 27 | issue = 9 | pages = 923\u2013936 | pmid=16108067}}</ref><ref name=BirdzBC06>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/4134586 | pmid = 17062871 | last1 = Butler | first1 = Ann B. | last2 = Cotterill | first2 = Rodney M.J. | year = 2006 | title = Mamillian and avian neuroanatomy and the question of consciousness in birds | journal = The Biological Bulletin | volume = no. 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 106\u2013127 | jstor = 4134586 }}</ref> Although avian brains are structurally very different from the brains of cognitively advanced mammals, each has the neural circuitry associated with higher-level consciousness, according to a 2006 analysis of the neuroanatomy of consciousness in birds and mammals.<ref name=BirdzBC06/> The study acknowledges that similar neural circuitry does not by itself prove consciousness, but notes its consistency with suggestive evidence from experiments on birds\u2019 working and episodic memories, sense of object permanence, and theory of mind {{crossref|selfref=no|(both covered below)}}.<ref name=BirdzBC06/>\n\n===Tool use===\n{{Further|Tool use by animals#In_birds}}[[File:Camarhynchus pallidus composite.jpg|thumb|A woodpecker finch using a stick to impale a grub, with a second image showing it had successfully captured it]]\nMany birds have been shown to be capable of using tools.

Instead, it seems that birds use a different part of their brain, the medio-rostral neostriatum/hyperstriatum ventrale (see also [[nidopallium]]), as the seat of their intelligence, and the brain-to-body size ratio of psittacines (parrots) and corvines (birds of the crow family) is actually comparable to that of higher primates.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1139/z03-190 | last1 = Iwaniuk | first1 = A.N. | last2 = Nelson | first2 = J.E. | year = 2003 | title = Developmental differences are correlated with relative brain size in birds: A comparative analysis | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Zoology | volume = 81 | issue = 12| pages = 1913\u20131928 }}</ref>\n\nStudies with captive birds have given insight into which birds are the most intelligent. While parrots have the distinction of being able to mimic human speech, studies with the [[grey parrot]] have shown that some are able to associate words with their meanings and form simple sentences (see [[Alex (parrot)|Alex]]). Parrots and the corvid family of crows, ravens, and jays are considered the most intelligent of birds. Not surprisingly, research has shown that these species tend to have the largest [[High vocal center|HVC]]s. Dr. Harvey J. Karten, a neuroscientist at [[University of California, San Diego|UCSD]] who has studied the physiology of birds, has discovered that the lower parts of avian brains are similar to those of humans.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n===Social behavior===\n{{further|Bird#Social systems|Social animal}}\nSocial life has been considered a driving force for the evolution of intelligence in various types of animals. Many birds have social organizations, and loose aggregations are common. Many corvid species separate into small family groups or \"clans\" for activities such as nesting and territorial defense. The birds then congregate in massive flocks made up of several different species for migratory purposes. Some birds make use of teamwork while hunting. Predatory birds hunting in pairs have been observed using a \"bait and switch\" technique, whereby one bird will distract the prey while the other swoops in for the kill.\n\nSocial behavior requires individual identification, and most birds appear to be capable of recognizing mates, siblings, and young. Other behaviors such as play and cooperative breeding are also considered indicators of intelligence.\n\nCrows appear to be able to remember who observed them catching food. They also steal food caught by others.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Emery | first1 = N.J. | last2 = Clayton | first2 = N.S. | year = 2004 | title = The mentality of crows: convergent evolution of intelligence in corvids and apes | url = | journal = Science | volume = 306 | issue = 5703| pages = 1903\u20131907 | doi=10.1126/science.1098410| pmid = 15591194 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.299.6596 | bibcode = 2004Sci...306.1903E }}</ref>\n\nIn some [[fairy-wren]]s such as the [[Superb fairy-wren|superb]] and [[Red-backed fairy-wren|red-backed]], males pick flower petals in colors contrasting with their bright [[nuptial]] plumage and present them to others of their species that will acknowledge, inspect, and sometimes manipulate the petals. This function seems not linked to sexual or aggressive activity in the short and medium term thereafter, though its function is apparently not aggressive and quite possibly sexual.<ref>Karubian, Jordan & Alvarado, Allison (2003): Testing the function of petal-carrying in the Red-backed Fairy-wren (''Malurus melanocephalus'').

Studies have shown that the intricate territorial songs of some birds must be learned at an early age, and that the memory of the song will serve the bird for the rest of its life. Some bird species are able to communicate in several regional varieties of their songs. For example, the [[Saddleback (bird)|New Zealand saddleback]] will learn the different song \"dialects\" of clans of its own species, much as human beings might acquire diverse regional dialects. When a territory-owning male of the species dies, a young male will immediately take his place, singing to prospective mates in the dialect appropriate to the territory he is in.<ref>Environews: Saddleback Dialects, Radio live (2011) http://www.radiolive.co.nz/Environews-Saddleback-Dialects/tabid/506/articleID/20318/Default.aspx</ref> Similarly, around 300 [[Tui (bird)|tui]] songs have been recorded.<ref>The language of love, Auckland Now http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/6740119/The-language-of-love</ref> The greater the competition in the area, it has been suggested, the more likely the birds are to actually create or make their song more complex.<ref>Tui one of world's most intelligent birds, 3 News (2012) http://www.3news.co.nz/Tui-one-of-worlds-most-intelligent-birds/tabid/1160/articleID/254369/Default.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201174404/http://www.3news.co.nz/Tui-one-of-worlds-most-intelligent-birds/tabid/1160/articleID/254369/Default.aspx |date=1 February 2014 }}</ref>\n\nRecent studies indicate that some birds may have an ability to memorize \"syntactic\" patterns of sounds, and that they can be taught to reject the ones determined to be incorrect by the human trainers.

The endogenous metabolome can be further subdivided to include a \"primary\" and a \"secondary\" metabolome (particularly when referring to plant or microbial metabolomes).

The study of the metabolome is called [[metabolomics]].\n\n\n==Origins==\nThe word metabolome appears to be a blending of the words \"[[metabolite]]\" and \"[[chromosome]]\". It was constructed to imply that [[metabolites]] are indirectly encoded by genes or act on genes and gene products.

As a result, an organism's metabolome can serve as an excellent probe of its [[phenotype]] (i.e. the product of its [[genotype]] and its environment). [[Metabolites]] can be measured (identified, quantified or classified) using a number of different technologies including [[NMR spectroscopy]] and [[mass spectrometry]].  Most [[mass spectrometry]] (MS) methods must be coupled to various forms of [[liquid chromatography]] (LC), [[gas chromatography]] (GC) or [[capillary electrophoresis]] (CE) to facilitate compound separation. Each method is typically able to identify or characterize 50-5000 different metabolites or metabolite \"features\" at a time, depending on the instrument or protocol being used. See Figure 2 for an illustration of the relationship between different analytical methods and their sensitivity.  Currently it is not possible to analyze the entire range of metabolites by a single analytical method.\n\n[[NMR spectroscopy|Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy]] is an analytical chemistry technique that measures the absorption of [[radiofrequency]] radiation of specific nuclei when molecules containing those nuclei are placed in strong [[magnetic fields]].  The frequency (i.e. the [[chemical shift]]) at which a given atom or nucleus absorbs is highly dependent on the chemical environment (bonding, chemical structure nearest neighbours, solvent) of that atom in a given molecule.  The NMR absorption patterns produce \"resonance\" peaks at different frequencies or different chemical shifts \u2013 this collection of peaks is called an [[NMR spectrum]]. Because each chemical compound has a different chemical structure, each compound will have a unique (or almost unique) [[NMR spectrum]].  As a result, NMR is particularly useful for the characterization, identification and quantification of small molecules, such as metabolites. The widespread use of NMR for \"classical\" metabolic studies, along with its exceptional capacity to handle complex metabolite mixtures is likely the reason why NMR was one of the first technologies to be widely adopted for routine metabolome measurements.  As an analytical technique, NMR is non-destructive, non-biased, easily quantifiable, requires little or no separation, permits the identification of novel compounds and it needs no chemical derivatization.  NMR is particularly amenable to detecting compounds that are less tractable to [[Liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry|LC-MS]] analysis, such as sugars, amines or volatile liquids or [[GC-MS]] analysis, such as large molecules (>500 Da) or relatively non-reactive compounds.  NMR is not a very sensitive technique with a lower limit of detection of about 5 \u03bcM.  Typically 50-150 compounds can be identified by NMR-based metabolomic studies.\n\n[[Mass spectrometry]] is an analytical technique that measures the [[mass-to-charge ratio]] of molecules.  Molecules or molecular fragments are typically charged or ionized by spraying them through a charged field ([[electrospray ionization]]), bombarding them with electrons from a hot filament ([[electron ionization]]) or blasting them with a laser when they are placed on specially coated plates (matrix assisted laser desorption ionization).  The charged molecules are then propelled through space using electrodes or magnets and their speed, rate of curvature, or other physical characteristics are measured to determine their [[mass-to-charge ratio]].  From these data the mass of the parent molecule can be determined.  Further fragmentation of the molecule through controlled collisions with gas molecules or with electrons can help determine the structure of molecules. Very accurate mass measurements can also be used to determine the elemental formulas or elemental composition of compounds.  Most forms of mass spectrometry require some form of separation using [[liquid chromatography]] or [[gas chromatography]].  This separation step is required to simplify the resulting mass spectra and to permit more accurate compound identification.  Some [[mass spectrometry]] methods also require that the molecules be derivatized or chemically modified so that they are more amenable for [[chromatographic]] separation (this is particularly true for [[GC-MS]]).  As an analytical technique, MS is a very sensitive method that requires very little sample (<1&nbsp;ng of material or <10 \u03bcL of a biofluid) and can generate signals for 1000s of metabolites from a single sample. MS instruments can also be configured for very high throughput metabolome analyses (hundreds to thousands of samples a day).

As a result, an organism's metabolome can serve as an excellent probe of its [[phenotype]] (i.e. the product of its [[genotype]] and its environment). [[Metabolites]] can be measured (identified, quantified or classified) using a number of different technologies including [[NMR spectroscopy]] and [[mass spectrometry]].  Most [[mass spectrometry]] (MS) methods must be coupled to various forms of [[liquid chromatography]] (LC), [[gas chromatography]] (GC) or [[capillary electrophoresis]] (CE) to facilitate compound separation. Each method is typically able to identify or characterize 50-5000 different metabolites or metabolite \"features\" at a time, depending on the instrument or protocol being used. See Figure 2 for an illustration of the relationship between different analytical methods and their sensitivity.  Currently it is not possible to analyze the entire range of metabolites by a single analytical method.\n\n[[NMR spectroscopy|Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy]] is an analytical chemistry technique that measures the absorption of [[radiofrequency]] radiation of specific nuclei when molecules containing those nuclei are placed in strong [[magnetic fields]].  The frequency (i.e. the [[chemical shift]]) at which a given atom or nucleus absorbs is highly dependent on the chemical environment (bonding, chemical structure nearest neighbours, solvent) of that atom in a given molecule.  The NMR absorption patterns produce \"resonance\" peaks at different frequencies or different chemical shifts \u2013 this collection of peaks is called an [[NMR spectrum]]. Because each chemical compound has a different chemical structure, each compound will have a unique (or almost unique) [[NMR spectrum]].  As a result, NMR is particularly useful for the characterization, identification and quantification of small molecules, such as metabolites. The widespread use of NMR for \"classical\" metabolic studies, along with its exceptional capacity to handle complex metabolite mixtures is likely the reason why NMR was one of the first technologies to be widely adopted for routine metabolome measurements.  As an analytical technique, NMR is non-destructive, non-biased, easily quantifiable, requires little or no separation, permits the identification of novel compounds and it needs no chemical derivatization.  NMR is particularly amenable to detecting compounds that are less tractable to [[Liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry|LC-MS]] analysis, such as sugars, amines or volatile liquids or [[GC-MS]] analysis, such as large molecules (>500 Da) or relatively non-reactive compounds.  NMR is not a very sensitive technique with a lower limit of detection of about 5 \u03bcM.  Typically 50-150 compounds can be identified by NMR-based metabolomic studies.\n\n[[Mass spectrometry]] is an analytical technique that measures the [[mass-to-charge ratio]] of molecules.  Molecules or molecular fragments are typically charged or ionized by spraying them through a charged field ([[electrospray ionization]]), bombarding them with electrons from a hot filament ([[electron ionization]]) or blasting them with a laser when they are placed on specially coated plates (matrix assisted laser desorption ionization).  The charged molecules are then propelled through space using electrodes or magnets and their speed, rate of curvature, or other physical characteristics are measured to determine their [[mass-to-charge ratio]].  From these data the mass of the parent molecule can be determined.  Further fragmentation of the molecule through controlled collisions with gas molecules or with electrons can help determine the structure of molecules. Very accurate mass measurements can also be used to determine the elemental formulas or elemental composition of compounds.  Most forms of mass spectrometry require some form of separation using [[liquid chromatography]] or [[gas chromatography]].  This separation step is required to simplify the resulting mass spectra and to permit more accurate compound identification.  Some [[mass spectrometry]] methods also require that the molecules be derivatized or chemically modified so that they are more amenable for [[chromatographic]] separation (this is particularly true for [[GC-MS]]).  As an analytical technique, MS is a very sensitive method that requires very little sample (<1&nbsp;ng of material or <10 \u03bcL of a biofluid) and can generate signals for 1000s of metabolites from a single sample. MS instruments can also be configured for very high throughput metabolome analyses (hundreds to thousands of samples a day).  Quantification of metabolites and the characterization of novel compound structures is more difficult by MS than by NMR. [[Liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry|LC-MS]] is particularly amenable to detecting hydrophobic molecules ([[lipids]], [[fatty acids]]) and [[peptides]] while [[GC-MS]] is best for detecting [[small molecules]] (<500 Da) and highly volatile compounds ([[esters]], [[amines]], [[ketones]], [[alkanes]], [[thiols]]).\n\nUnlike the [[genome]] or even the [[proteome]], the metabolome is a highly dynamic entity that can change dramatically, over a period of just seconds or minutes. As a result, there is growing interest in measuring metabolites over multiple time periods or over short time intervals using modified versions of NMR or MS-based metabolomics.\n\n==Metabolome databases==\nBecause an organism's metabolome is largely defined by its [[genome]], different species will have different metabolomes.  Indeed, the fact that the metabolome of a tomato is different than the metabolome of an apple is the reason why these two fruits taste so different.   Furthermore, different tissues, different [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] and [[biofluids]] associated with those organs and [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] can also have distinctly different metabolomes.  The fact that different organisms and different [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]]/[[biofluids]] have such different metabolomes has led to the development of a number of organism-specific of biofluid-specific metabolome databases.

The [[Human Metabolome Database|HMDB]] contains three kinds of information: 1) chemical information, 2) clinical information, and 3) biochemical information. The chemical data includes >40,000 metabolite structures with detailed descriptions, extensive chemical classifications, synthesis information and observed/calculated chemical properties.  It also contains nearly 10,000 experimentally measured [[NMR]], [[GC-MS]] and [[LC/MS]] spectra from more than 1100 different metabolites. The clinical information includes data on >10,000 [[metabolite]]-[[biofluid]] concentrations, metabolite concentration information on more than 600 different human diseases and pathway data for more than 200 different inborn errors of metabolism. The biochemical information includes nearly 6000 protein (and DNA) sequences and more than 5000 biochemical reactions that are linked to these metabolite entries.  The [[Human Metabolome Database|HMDB]] supports a wide variety of online queries including text searches, chemical structure searches, sequence similarity searches and spectral similarity searches.  This makes it particularly useful for metabolomic researchers who are attempting to identify or understand metabolites in clinical metabolomic studies. The first version of the [[Human Metabolome Database|HMDB]] was released in Jan. 1 2007 and was compiled by scientists at the [[University of Alberta]] and the [[University of Calgary]]. At that time they reported data on 2,500 [[metabolites]], 1,200 drugs and 3,500 food components. Since then these scientists have greatly expanded the collection. The latest version of the [[Human Metabolome Database|HMDB]] (version 3.5) contains >16,000 endogenous metabolites, >1500 drugs and >22,000 food constituents or food metabolites.<ref name=ref_23161693>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wishart DS, Jewison T, Guo AC, Wilson M, Knox C, Liu Y, Djoumbou Y, Mandal R, Aziat F, Dong E, Bouatra S, Sinelnikov I, Arndt D, Xia J, Liu P, Yallou F, Bjorndahl T, Perez-Pineiro R, Eisner R, Allen F, Neveu V, Greiner R, Scalbert A | display-authors = 6 | title = HMDB 3.0--The Human Metabolome Database in 2013 | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 41 | issue = Database issue | pages = D801-7 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23161693 | pmc = 3531200 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gks1065 }}</ref>\n\n====Human biofluid metabolomes====\nScientists at the [[University of Alberta]] have been systematically characterizing specific biofluid metabolomes including the serum metabolome,<ref name=\"ref_21359215\" /> the urine metabolome,<ref name=\"ref_24023812\" /> the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) metabolome <ref name=\"ref_22546835\" /> and the saliva metabolome.  These efforts have involved both experimental metabolomic analysis (involving [[NMR]], [[GC-MS]], [[ICP-MS]], [[Liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry|LC-MS]] and [[HPLC]] assays) as well as extensive literature mining.  According to their data, the human serum metabolome contains at least 4200 different compounds (including many lipids), the human urine metabolome contains at least 3000 different compounds (including 100s of volatiles and gut microbial metabolites), the human [[Cerebrospinal fluid|CSF]] metabolome contains nearly 500 different compounds while the human saliva metabolome contains approximately 400 different metabolites, including many bacterial products.\n\n===Yeast Metabolome Database===\nThe [[Yeast Metabolome Database]] is a freely accessible, online database of >2000 small molecule metabolites found in or produced by [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]] ([[Baker's yeast]]). The [[YMDB]] contains two kinds of information: 1) chemical information and 2) biochemical information. The chemical information in YMDB includes 2027 metabolite structures with detailed metabolite descriptions, extensive chemical classifications, synthesis information and observed/calculated chemical properties. It also contains nearly 4000 [[NMR]], [[GC-MS]] and [[LC/MS]] spectra obtained from more than 500 different metabolites. The biochemical information in [[YMDB]] includes >1100 protein (and DNA) sequences and >900 biochemical reactions. The [[YMDB]] supports a wide variety of queries including text searches, chemical structure searches, sequence similarity searches and spectral similarity searches.  This makes it particularly useful for metabolomic researchers who are studying yeast as a model organism or who are looking into optimizing the production of fermented beverages (wine, beer).\n\n[[Secondary electrospray ionization]]-[[Mass spectrometry|high resolution mass spectrometry]] SESI-HRMS is a non-invasive analytical technique that allows us to monitor the yeast metabolic activities.

Until 1532, it was in the hands of the [[Silesian Piasts]], then it belonged to the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern dynasty]]. After 1623 it was a [[state country]] in the hands of [[Henckel von Donnersmarck|the Donnersmarck family]]. From 1742\u20131945 the town was within the borders of [[Prussia]] and [[Germany]], and played an important role as an economic and administrative centre of the [[Katowice urban area|local industrial region]]. Until the outbreak of [[World War II]], it was the main centre of national, social, cultural and publishing organisations fighting to preserve Polish identity in [[Upper Silesia]].\n\nDuring [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, Nazi Germans burned down the [[Bytom Synagogue]]. In 1942, the [[Beuthen Jewish community]] was liquidated and its members were the first [[Holocaust trains|transport]] to be sent to [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].\n\nAfter the war, decades of the [[Polish People's Republic]] were characterized by a constant emphasis on the development of [[heavy industry]], which deeply polluted and degraded Bytom. After 1989, the city experienced a socio-economic decline. The city is blighted with derelict, dilapidated buildings which are ubiquitous. The population has been in rapid decline since 1999 leading to a number of locals describing the city as a ghost town. Poverty remains rife in Bytom. However, it is an important place in the cultural, entertainment, and industrial map of the region.\n\n==Geology==\nThe bedrock of the Upland of [[:pl:Miechowice|Miechowice]] consists primarily of sandstones and slates. The rocks are punctuated with abundant natural resources of coal and iron ore from the Carboniferous period. In the north part of the upland, in the Bytom basin lays the broad range of the triassic rocks, from sandstones to limestones, with rich ore, zinc and lead reserves. The upper layer is composed of clay, sand and gravel.\n\n==Coat of arms==\nOne half of the [[coat of arms of Bytom]] depicts a miner mining coal, while the other half presents a yellow eagle on the blue field \u2013 the symbol of [[Upper Silesia]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Plackosciuszki.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko|Kosciuszko]] Square in the 1890s]]\nBytom is one of the oldest cities of [[Upper Silesia]], originally recorded as ''Bitom'' in 1136, when it was part of the Medieval [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|Kingdom of Poland]]. Archaeological discoveries have shown that there was a fortified settlement (a ''[[gr\u00f3d]]'') here, probably founded by the Polish King [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]] in the early 11th century.<ref>J. Kramer, ''Chronik der Stadt Beuthen in Ober-Schlesien'', Bytom, 1863, p. 1</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Testament of Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth|fragmentation of Poland]] in 1138, Bytom became part of the [[Seniorate Province]], as it was still considered part of historic [[Lesser Poland]]. In 1177 it became part of the [[Duchy of Silesia|Silesian]] province of Poland, and remained within historic [[Silesia]] since.<ref>Roman Majorczyk, ''Historia g\u00f3rnictwa kruszcowego w rejonie Bytomia'', Bytom, 1985, p. 9</ref> Bytom received [[city rights]] from Prince [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw of Salzburg|W\u0142adys\u0142aw]] in 1254 with its first centrally located market square. The city of Bytom benefited economically from its location on a trade route linking [[Krak\u00f3w]] with Silesia from east to west, and [[Hungary]] with [[Moravia]] and [[Greater Poland]] from north to south. The first [[Roman Catholic]] Church of the Virgin Mary was built in 1231. In 1259 Bytom was raided by the [[Mongols]]. The Duchy of Opole was split and in 1281 Bytom became a [[Duchy of Bytom|separate duchy]], since 1289 under overlordship and administration of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]]. It existed until 1498, when it was re-integrated with the [[Piast dynasty|Piast]]-ruled [[Duchy of Opole]]. Due to German settlers coming to the area, the city was being [[Germanization|Germanized]].\n\nIt came under control of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] of [[Austria]] in 1526, which increased the influence of the German language. The city became part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in 1742 during the [[Silesian Wars]] and part of the [[German Empire]] in 1871. In the 19th and the first part of the 20th centuries, the city rapidly grew and industrialized.\n[[File:GimnazjumPolskiewBytomiu.JPG|thumb|left|190px|Polish Gymnasium in Bytom in the 1930s]]\n[[File:Kalide002.jpg|thumb|The Sleeping Lion at the Bytom's Market Square]]\nBytom was one of the main centers of Polish resistance against Germanization in Upper Silesia in the 19th century, up until the mid-20th century. Polish social, political and cultural organizations were formed and operated here. From 1848, the newspaper ''[[:pl:Dziennik G\u00f3rno\u015bl\u0105ski|Dziennik G\u00f3rno\u015bl\u0105ski]]'' was published here. In 1895, the [[Sok\u00f3\u0142|\"Sok\u00f3\u0142\" Polish Gymnastic Society]] was established, and, during the [[Silesian uprisings]], in 1919\u20131920, Polish football clubs [[Szombierki Bytom|Poniatowski Szombierki]] and [[Polonia Bytom]] were founded, which later on, in post-[[World War II]] Poland both won the national championship. In the interwar period, Bytom was one of two cities (alongside [[Kwidzyn]]) in [[Weimar Germany|Germany]], in which a Polish gymnasium was allowed to operate. In 1923 a branch of the [[Union of Poles in Germany]] was established in Bytom. Before 1939, the town, along with Gleiwitz (now [[Gliwice]]), was at the southeastern tip of German Silesia.\n\nThe [[Bytom Synagogue]] was burned down by Nazi German SS and SA troopers during the [[Kristallnacht]] on 9\u201310 November 1938. During [[World War II]], the [[Beuthen Jewish community]] was liquidated via the first ever [[Holocaust trains|Holocaust transport]] to be exterminated at [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]].<ref>[http://ellisisland.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/translations.html  Jews deported from Beuthen (Bytom), list prepared in 1942] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715230956/http://ellisisland.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/translations.html |date=15 July 2009}}</ref><ref>[http://ellisisland.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/bytom/Bytom1.html  Elsa Drezner, Yizkor Book Project Manager Avraham Groll, Names of Jews deported from Beuthen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726202938/http://ellisisland.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/bytom/Bytom1.html |date=26 July 2011 }}</ref><ref>[http://ellisisland.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/bytom/bytom.html  Translations: deportation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726203021/http://ellisisland.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/bytom/bytom.html |date=26 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1945 the city was transferred to Poland as a result of the [[Potsdam Conference]].

in southern [[Poland]], in [[Silesian Voivodeship|Silesia]], in centre of [[Metropolitan Association of Upper Silesia and D\u0105browa Basin]].\n\nIt is one of the oldest cities in the [[Upper Silesia]], and the former seat of the [[Silesian Piasts|Piast dukes]] of the [[Duchy of Bytom]]. Until 1532, it was in the hands of the [[Silesian Piasts]], then it belonged to the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern dynasty]]. After 1623 it was a [[state country]] in the hands of [[Henckel von Donnersmarck|the Donnersmarck family]]. From 1742\u20131945 the town was within the borders of [[Prussia]] and [[Germany]], and played an important role as an economic and administrative centre of the [[Katowice urban area|local industrial region]]. Until the outbreak of [[World War II]], it was the main centre of national, social, cultural and publishing organisations fighting to preserve Polish identity in [[Upper Silesia]].\n\nDuring [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, Nazi Germans burned down the [[Bytom Synagogue]]. In 1942, the [[Beuthen Jewish community]] was liquidated and its members were the first [[Holocaust trains|transport]] to be sent to [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].\n\nAfter the war, decades of the [[Polish People's Republic]] were characterized by a constant emphasis on the development of [[heavy industry]], which deeply polluted and degraded Bytom. After 1989, the city experienced a socio-economic decline. The city is blighted with derelict, dilapidated buildings which are ubiquitous. The population has been in rapid decline since 1999 leading to a number of locals describing the city as a ghost town. Poverty remains rife in Bytom. However, it remains an important place in the cultural, entertainment, and industrial map of the region.\n\n==Geology==\nThe bedrock of the Upland of [[:pl:Miechowice|Miechowice]] consists primarily of sandstones and slates. The rocks are punctuated with abundant natural resources of coal and iron ore from the Carboniferous period. In the north part of the upland, in the Bytom basin lays the broad range of the triassic rocks, from sandstones to limestones, with rich ore, zinc and lead reserves. The upper layer is composed of clay, sand and gravel.\n\n==Coat of arms==\nOne half of the [[coat of arms of Bytom]] depicts a miner mining coal, while the other half presents a yellow eagle on the blue field \u2013 the symbol of [[Upper Silesia]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Plackosciuszki.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko|Kosciuszko]] Square in the 1890s]]\nBytom is one of the oldest cities of [[Upper Silesia]], originally recorded as ''Bitom'' in 1136, when it was part of the Medieval [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|Kingdom of Poland]]. Archaeological discoveries have shown that there was a fortified settlement (a ''[[gr\u00f3d]]'') here, probably founded by the Polish King [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]] in the early 11th century.<ref>J. Kramer, ''Chronik der Stadt Beuthen in Ober-Schlesien'', Bytom, 1863, p. 1</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Testament of Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth|fragmentation of Poland]] in 1138, Bytom became part of the [[Seniorate Province]], as it was still considered part of historic [[Lesser Poland]]. In 1177 it became part of the [[Duchy of Silesia|Silesian]] province of Poland, and remained within historic [[Silesia]] since.<ref>Roman Majorczyk, ''Historia g\u00f3rnictwa kruszcowego w rejonie Bytomia'', Bytom, 1985, p. 9</ref> Bytom received [[city rights]] from Prince [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw of Salzburg|W\u0142adys\u0142aw]] in 1254 with its first centrally located market square. The city of Bytom benefited economically from its location on a trade route linking [[Krak\u00f3w]] with Silesia from east to west, and [[Hungary]] with [[Moravia]] and [[Greater Poland]] from north to south. The first [[Roman Catholic]] Church of the Virgin Mary was built in 1231. In 1259 Bytom was raided by the [[Mongols]]. The Duchy of Opole was split and in 1281 Bytom became a [[Duchy of Bytom|separate duchy]], since 1289 under overlordship and administration of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]]. It existed until 1498, when it was re-integrated with the [[Piast dynasty|Piast]]-ruled [[Duchy of Opole]]. Due to German settlers coming to the area, the city was being [[Germanization|Germanized]].\n\nIt came under control of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] of [[Austria]] in 1526, which increased the influence of the German language. The city became part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in 1742 during the [[Silesian Wars]] and part of the [[German Empire]] in 1871. In the 19th and the first part of the 20th centuries, the city rapidly grew and industrialized.\n[[File:GimnazjumPolskiewBytomiu.JPG|thumb|left|190px|Polish Gymnasium in Bytom in the 1930s]]\n[[File:Kalide002.jpg|thumb|The Sleeping Lion at the Bytom's Market Square]]\nBytom was one of the main centers of Polish resistance against Germanization in Upper Silesia in the 19th century, up until the mid-20th century. Polish social, political and cultural organizations were formed and operated here. From 1848, the newspaper ''[[:pl:Dziennik G\u00f3rno\u015bl\u0105ski|Dziennik G\u00f3rno\u015bl\u0105ski]]'' was published here. In 1895, the [[Sok\u00f3\u0142|\"Sok\u00f3\u0142\" Polish Gymnastic Society]] was established, and, during the [[Silesian uprisings]], in 1919\u20131920, Polish football clubs [[Szombierki Bytom|Poniatowski Szombierki]] and [[Polonia Bytom]] were founded, which later on, in post-[[World War II]] Poland both won the national championship. In the interwar period, Bytom was one of two cities (alongside [[Kwidzyn]]) in [[Weimar Germany|Germany]], in which a Polish gymnasium was allowed to operate. In 1923 a branch of the [[Union of Poles in Germany]] was established in Bytom. Before 1939, the town, along with Gleiwitz (now [[Gliwice]]), was at the southeastern tip of German Silesia.\n\nThe [[Bytom Synagogue]] was burned down by Nazi German SS and SA troopers during the [[Kristallnacht]] on 9\u201310 November 1938. During [[World War II]], the [[Beuthen Jewish community]] was liquidated via the first ever [[Holocaust trains|Holocaust transport]] to be exterminated at [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]].<ref>[http://ellisisland.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/translations.html  Jews deported from Beuthen (Bytom), list prepared in 1942] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715230956/http://ellisisland.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/translations.html |date=15 July 2009}}</ref><ref>[http://ellisisland.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/bytom/Bytom1.html  Elsa Drezner, Yizkor Book Project Manager Avraham Groll, Names of Jews deported from Beuthen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726202938/http://ellisisland.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/bytom/Bytom1.html |date=26 July 2011 }}</ref><ref>[http://ellisisland.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/bytom/bytom.html  Translations: deportation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726203021/http://ellisisland.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/bytom/bytom.html |date=26 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1945 the city was transferred to Poland as a result of the [[Potsdam Conference]].

The underlying cause was [[secondary antisemitism|resurgent antisemitism]] directed at Jewish [[List of Holocaust survivors|Holocaust survivors]] who demanded the return of property that had been [[Aryanization (Nazism)|stolen]] during the Holocaust. Rumors spread that a local Catholic school would be nationalized and the nuns who taught there replaced by Jewish teachers.\n\nOn the morning of the incident, women demonstrated against the nationalization of the school, blaming Jews. That same day, a Jewish doctor was vaccinating children at the school. He was accused of poisoning non-Jewish children, sparking a riot. The police were unable to prevent it, and a local garrison of soldiers joined in. About forty-seven Jews were injured, and fifteen had to be hospitalized.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the events, international coverage embarrassed the Czechoslovak authorities and the [[Czechoslovak Communist Party]] exploited the riots to accuse the democratic authorities of ineffectiveness.\n\nA 2004 documentary film about the rioting, ''[[Miluj bl\u00ed\u017eneho svojho]]'' (\"Love thy neighbor\"), sparked increased discussion of the history of these events. The next year, the mayor of Topo\u013e\u010dany issued an official apology.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n== The Holocaust ==\n{{further|The Holocaust in Slovakia}}\n[[File:Carpathian Ruthenian Jews disembark from a train at Birkenau.jpg|thumb|[[Carpathian Ruthenian Jews]] arrive at Auschwitz in 1944.]]\n\nOn 14 March 1939, the Slovak State proclaimed its independence from [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] under the protection of Nazi Germany. The persecution of Jews played a key role in the Slovak State's domestic policy.{{sfn|Rajcan|Vadkerty|Hlavinka|2018|pp=843\u2013844}} The Slovak State liquidated some 10,000 Jewish-owned businesses and turned 2,300 over to \"Aryan\" owners, depriving most Slovak Jews of their livelihoods. The September 1941 \"[[Anti-Jewish laws#Slovakia|Jewish Code]]\", based on the [[Nuremberg Laws]], required Jews to wear [[Yellow badge|yellow armbands]], banned intermarriage, and conscripted able-bodied Jews for [[forced labor]].{{sfn|Rajcan|Vadkerty|Hlavinka|2018|pp=845\u2013846}}{{sfn|Fatran|2002|p=144}} In 1942, 57,000 Jews, two-thirds of the Jews in Slovakia at the time, were [[List of Holocaust transports from Slovakia|deported]]. Most of them died in [[Auschwitz]] or other [[death camps]].{{sfn|Kamenec|2002|p=130}} During and after the fall 1944 [[Slovak National Uprising]], Jews were again targeted for extermination; of the 25,000 remaining in Slovakia some 13,500 were deported (largely to Auschwitz) and hundreds murdered in Slovakia.{{sfn|Rajcan|Vadkerty|Hlavinka|2018|p=849}}{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=405}}\n\nThe Jewish community in [[Topo\u013e\u010dany]], a midsize town {{convert|80|km}} east of the capital, [[Bratislava]], was one of the wealthiest in the country. Most Jews made a living in trade or business; they owned 320 of 615 registered businesses.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=126}}{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|2005|p=264}} Other Jews were professionals, making up two-thirds of doctors and 57% of lawyers.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=126}} Of the 12,000 residents of Topo\u013e\u010dany in 1942, some 3,000 were Jewish.{{sfn|Bartov\u00e1|2016|p=520}} On the 1930 census, about one-third of Jews registered themselves as Jewish by nationality, while the remainder declared themselves ethnic Germans, Hungarians, or Slovaks.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=126}} Although there was little social mixing between the predominantly Orthodox Jews and devoutly Catholic Slovaks, there were also few overt antisemitic incidents before the war.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|2005|p=264}} Jews participated in political life, having their own political party{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=126}} and holding seats on the [[town council]].{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|2005|p=264}}\n\nAfter 1938, Topo\u013e\u010dany became a \"bastion\" of the antisemitic, rightwing [[Slovak People's Party]], and the majority of its residents supported the regime's anti-Jewish policies, including deportation.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|2005|p=264}} 89 Jewish businesses were confiscated, mostly by members of the Slovak People's Party. According to Israeli historian [[Robert B\u00fcchler]], most \"Aryanizers\" were not from Topo\u013e\u010dany but opportunistic newcomers.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=127}} However, many neighbors benefited in smaller ways from anti-Jewish persecution, such as buying property at below-market auctions. Czech historians Hana Kub\u00e1tov\u00e1 and Michal Kub\u00e1t quote Holocaust survivors who said that their non-Jewish friends turned on them and profited from anti-Jewish persecution.{{sfn|Kub\u00e1tov\u00e1|Kub\u00e1t|2018|pp=573\u2013574, 577}} Many Jews from Topo\u013e\u010dany were deported in 1942 and murdered, but some managed to survive by agreeing to work as forced laborers at [[Nov\u00e1ky]] camp in Slovakia, which was liberated during the 1944 uprising. The prisoners fled to the mountains and many survived the war in hiding or fighting with the partisans.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|2005|p=264}}{{sfn|Kub\u00e1tov\u00e1|Kub\u00e1t|2018|p=574}} The number of Holocaust survivors returning to the town after the war has been estimated at 550,{{sfn|Bartov\u00e1|2016|p=520}} about 700,{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|2005|p=264}} or 750.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=127}} Most of the survivors had been socioeconomically advantaged compared to other Jews and leveraged their wealth to avoid deportation to extermination camps.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|2005|p=264}}{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=127}} Among the survivors in Topo\u013e\u010dany, there were a disproportionate number of intact families and children compared to other locations.{{sfn|Kub\u00e1tov\u00e1|Kub\u00e1t|2018|p=574}}\n\n== After liberation ==\nTowards the end of the war, the fascist regime tried to incite hatred for their own political ends by fabricating claims that Jews would take violent revenge on those who had stolen property. They also spread false rumors that Jewish property owners had reoccupied estates in [[Sicily]] after [[Allied invasion of Sicily|liberation]] in 1943, and shot Aryanizers.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=141}} After the liberation of Slovakia by the Red Army in March and April 1945, Holocaust survivors from Topo\u013e\u010dany faced a [[secondary antisemitism|resurgence of antisemitism]]. According to Slovak historian [[Ivan Kamenec]], their presence became an \"open and silent reproach\" to those Slovaks who had stood by or supported the persecution of Jews.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=127}} Many survivors attempted to regain the property that they had owned before the war. Those who had stolen Jewish property were reluctant to return it. Former partisans, or individuals claiming to have been partisans, had also appropriated some of the stolen property, in their view a rightful reward for their opposition to Nazism.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|2005|p=263}}{{sfn|Green|2015}} Jana \u0160i\u0161jakov\u00e1 also highlights the fascist regime's propaganda's lingering influence on perceptions of Jews.{{sfn|\u0160i\u0161jakov\u00e1|2008|pp=22\u201323}}\n\nThese two groups mounted a campaign of intimidation\u2014rioting, looting, assaults, and threats\u2014aimed at forcing Jews to leave and to give up their property claims.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|2005|p=263}}{{sfn|\u0160i\u0161jakov\u00e1|2008|p=23}} According to B\u00fcchler, \"the authorities did little to protect\" Holocaust survivors, instead casting their demands for property restitution and equal rights as \"provocative\". Meanwhile, officials ostensibly sympathetic to the Jews advised them to \"behave\" as to avoid inciting violence against them.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|2005|p=263}} One of the first post-liberation riots occurred in the eastern Slovak city of [[Ko\u0161ice]] on 2 May, before the end of the war. The Topo\u013e\u010dany pogrom is considered the most severe{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|2005|p=263}}{{sfn|\u0160i\u0161jakov\u00e1|2008|p=23}} or notorious{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=117}} anti-Jewish riot in postwar Slovakia. Overall, at least thirty-six Jews were murdered and more than one hundred injured between 1945 and 1948 in Slovakia, according to Polish historian Anna Cichopek.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=117}}\n\nFor four weeks prior to the riot, antisemites in Topo\u013e\u010dany distributed anti-Jewish propaganda and physically harassed Jews. In early September, nuns who taught at a local Catholic school for girls heard that their institution was about to be nationalized, and that they would be replaced. Although many Slovak schools were nationalized in 1945, rumors that it was due to a Jewish conspiracy and that Jewish teachers would replace gentiles were unfounded. The mothers of children at the school petitioned the government not to nationalize it and accused Jews of trying to take over the school for the benefit of Jewish children.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=127}} On Sunday, 23 September 1945, people threw stones at a young Jewish man at a train station and vandalized a house inhabited by Jews in nearby [[\u017dabokreky]]. The next day, gentile Slovaks gathered on the streets and chanted antisemitic slogans; a few Jews were assaulted and their homes burglarized. Policemen declined to intervene based on unfounded rumors that Jews had killed four children in Topo\u013e\u010dany. In [[Chynorany]] rumor held that thirty children had been murdered by Jews; at least one Jew was attacked and others were robbed.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=118}}{{sfn|\u0160i\u0161jakov\u00e1|2008|p=25}}\n\n== 24 September riot ==\nAt 8:00 on 24 September in Topo\u013e\u010dany, 60 women\u2014most of them mothers of local children\u2014went to the local district national committee (ONV) to demand that the nationalization be halted and Jewish children expelled from the school.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|pp=127\u2013128}} This was part of a larger pattern in which women, who had been among the most fervent supporters of the Slovak People's Party, played a central role in fomenting antisemitic demonstrations and violence.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=120}} The deputy chair of the ONV allegedly told them \"to take guns and go for the Jews\".{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=128}} Another official in the ONV supposedly said that the proposed nationalization was none of their business. The school inspector for the city intervened, trying to convince the protestors that the rumors of nationalization were not based in fact. By this time, about 160 people had were demonstrating outside of the office and circulating rumors of Jewish teachers replacing the nuns and Jews destroying Christian religious symbols.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=128}}{{sfn|Kub\u00e1tov\u00e1|Kub\u00e1t|2018|p=575}} Other rumors claimed that \"Jews do not work and still enjoy above average lifestyles and are involved in illegal business\".{{sfn|Kub\u00e1tov\u00e1|Kub\u00e1t|2018|p=575}}\n\n{{quotebox|Away with Jews, Jews are guilty of everything, expel Jewish children from our schools, and prohibit Jewish doctors, the Bergers, from vaccinating our children!|source=Antisemitic slogans attributed to the rioters{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=128}}|width=25em|quoted=yes}}\n\nWhen the women left the office, they began to chant antisemitic slogans and headed towards the school. The local police office, consisting of seven men, attempted to disperse them, but failed.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=129}} The women began to accuse a local Jewish doctor, Karol Berger, who was at the school that day to vaccinate seven- and eight-year-old children, of poisoning them instead. This precipitated the large-scale violence that was to follow. When they arrived at the school, the women broke inside. Misinterpreting the cries made by children upset by the rioting, they accosted Berger, shouting \"You Jew, you poison our children!\".{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=128}}{{sfn|Kub\u00e1tov\u00e1|Kub\u00e1t|2018|pp=575\u2013576}} Berger was taken outside and handed over to the crowd. With a Jewish soldier, he managed to escape and hid in the police office before joining other Jewish victims in the hospital later that day. Cichopek and Kamenec estimate that 200 to 300 people of the 9,000 residents of Topo\u013e\u010dany participated in the riot, physically assaulting local Jews on the street and burglarizing their homes.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|pp=128\u2013129}}\n\nJews sheltering at the police station were protected by the policemen. Teachers at the school resisted demands to turn over Jewish children.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=129}}{{sfn|Bartov\u00e1|2016|p=521}} However, when the city council called in twenty{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=129}} or thirty{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|2005|p=267}} soldiers stationed nearby to restore order, most instead joined the rioters. Soldiers had also attacked Jews during the [[Krak\u00f3w pogrom]] a month earlier in Poland.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|pp=125, 129}} According to one report, the commander of the army unit was inexperienced and ineffective, unable to prevent his men from answering the call to \"Soldiers come with us to beat the Jews!\"{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=129}} Offering escort to the police headquarters, soldiers led Jews out of apartments only to turn them over to the rioters. At noon, a special auxiliary unit finally managed to put an end to the violence, and the streets were quiet by 13:00{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=129}} although smaller groups still tried to accost Jews.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|2005|p=267}} Reinforcements of policemen from Bratislava, an hour's drive away, were requested at 9:30 but did not arrive until 18:00, when the riot was already over.{{sfn|Green|2015}}{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=129}} Municipal authorities responded sluggishly to the unfolding events, not denouncing the rumors that had led to violence until 18:45.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=129}}\n\nForty-seven{{sfn|Green|2015}} or forty-eight Jews were injured, and fifteen of them had to be hospitalized.{{sfn|Hrd\u00fd|2013}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{quotebox|[A]ccording to all signs, all these described events are organised, organised by Aryanisers who herewith wanted to prevent the restitution of property.|source=Ondrej Weiss and Ernest Kohn, survivors from a nearby village{{sfn|Kub\u00e1tov\u00e1|Kub\u00e1t|2018|p=576}}|width=25em|quoted=yes|align=left}}\nThe next day, between nine and eleven of the most active rioters were arrested by the policemen from Bratislava; most were young men between the age of seventeen and twenty-four. Later arrests brought the total number to some fifty civilians arrested; most were imprisoned either at [[Ilava]] labor camp or the prison in Topo\u013e\u010dany.  Separately, the military arrested the twenty soldiers who participated in the riot.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|pp=129\u2013130}} An investigation by the Health Commission found that the vaccines delivered by Berger were not harmful.{{sfn|Kub\u00e1tov\u00e1|Kub\u00e1t|2018|p=576}}\n\nAlong with similar incidents elsewhere in Slovakia and in Poland, the rioting in Topo\u013e\u010dany drew international condemnation that embarrassed the Czechoslovak authorities.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|2005|p=267}}{{sfn|\u0160i\u0161jakov\u00e1|2008|p=23}} Only two Slovak newspapers, ''\u010cas'' and ''[[Pravda (Slovakia)|Pravda]]'', published articles relating to the rioting, the first of which was published six days later. The ''Pravda'' newspaper, an organ of the [[Czechoslovak Communist Party]], used the riots to attack the democratic [[Third Czechoslovak Republic]] of being ineffectual unable to govern. In contrast, ''\u010cas'', affiliated with the [[Democratic Party (Slovakia, 1944)|Democratic Party]], focused on the moral bankruptcy of antisemitism as part of a broader postwar moral crisis and called upon Slovak Jews to patiently await the restoration of property by the courts.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|pp=130, 135}}{{sfn|\u0160i\u0161jakov\u00e1|2008|p=27}} ''Pravda'' published an interview with [[Karol \u0160midke]], the leader of the Communists in the [[Slovak National Council]], who emphasized the \"fascist elements\" who were supposedly plotting the destruction of the new order and called on them to be punished harshly in order to root them out.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=135}}\n\n\u0160midke's statements represented the official position of the Czechoslovak and Slovak governments, which concluded that the rioting was not spontaneous, but organized by a fascist conspiracy. The authorities recommended that the government be purged of alleged [[reactionary]] elements. The Slovak police, which stated that the rioting was caused by Catholic elements and the Slovak State's antisemitic propaganda, recommended dismissing the [[Religious sisters|mother superior]] and the Catholic principal of the school. It also highlighted aryanizers as the \"spiritual instigators\" of the violence.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|pp=136\u2013137}} The main concern of the authorities was not the welfare of Jewish citizens, but the failure of the state to maintain order.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|2005|p=267}} Overall, the response was sluggish and many administrators used the incident as an excuse to accuse others of unrelated misbehavior.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=137}} According to Robert B\u00fcchler, the authorities only responded to the rioting because the international coverage embarrassed the postwar government.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|2005|p=267}}\n\n{{quotebox|There are very few people in Topo\u013e\u010dany who would not approve of the events of 24 September 1945.

Accusations that the Jews had provoked the riots due to their \"provocative behavior\" and refusal to integrate with Slovak society were added to later reports. The farther away the reports were produced and the later, the more virulent the blaming of Jews became; a 15 October report by the police commissioner in Bratislava claimed that \"the main blame for the demonstrations rests on the provocative behavior of citizens of the Israelite religion against Christian citizens\".{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|pp=137\u2013138}} Contrary to the wishes of the rioters, very few Jews left in the immediate aftermath of the 1945 pogrom; most remained behind to rebuild their lives and fight for the restitution of property.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|2005|p=267}} By 1948, there were still 344 Jews living in Topo\u013e\u010dany, but many emigrated in 1949 to the newly formed state of Israel, the United States, Australia, Mexico, and other countries.{{sfn|Bartov\u00e1|2016|p=521}} {{As of|2015}}, there are no longer any Jews living in the town.{{sfn|Hrd\u00fd|2013}}{{sfn|Green|2015}}\n\n== Modern interpretations ==\nWriting about postwar anti-Jewish violence in Poland, [[Jan T. Gross]] argued that \"Jews were perceived as a threat to the material status quo, security, and peaceful conscience\" of their non-Jewish neighbors. Cichopek notes that it is impossible to prove what non-Jewish Poles and Slovaks were thinking after the war. Both Gross and Kamenec, in his analysis of the Topo\u013e\u010dany pogrom, focus more on material aspects while previous writers had emphasized the influence of antisemitic stereotypes. Kamenec argued that the consequences of Aryanization caused the resurgence of antisemitism.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|pp=140\u2013141}} According to Kamenec, \u0160i\u0161jakov\u00e1, and Cichopek, the lack of comprehensive legislation and competent administration of property transfer back to Jewish owners also contributed to uncertainty and anti-Jewish sentiment.{{sfn|\u0160i\u0161jakov\u00e1|2008|p=23}}{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=141}} However, Cichopek also emphasizes the role of antisemitic myths, such as [[blood libel]], in fueling violence; she points out that without the vaccination hysteria, the rioting in Topo\u013e\u010dany would not have occurred or could have happened in a different way.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=141}}\n\nCichopek argues that the Tiso regime, by its collaborationism with the Nazis and sending Jewish citizens to death camps, discredited antisemitism in postwar Slovakia. She also points out that the fascist regime also prevented the violence and chaos which had reigned for years in Poland under Nazi occupation, and that there were no extermination camps on Slovak soil. In Slovakia, the [[Judeo-Bolshevist]] canard was not prominent; instead Jews were accused of supporting [[Hungarian irredentism]]. According to Cichopek, these factors partially explain why the postwar anti-Jewish violence in Slovakia was less than that in Poland.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|pp=143}} [[Milan Stanislav \u010eurica]], a nationalist and Catholic theologian, blamed the victims in his analysis of the events.{{sfn | Bartov\u00e1|2016|p=521}} According to B\u00fcchler, the pogrom illuminates  the \"miserable situation\" for Jews in Slovakia after liberation, as well as the indifference of the authorities to \"the existential problems of the Jewish survivors\".{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|2005|pp=263\u2013264}}\n\n== Legacy ==\nA 2004 Slovak documentary film by [[Du\u0161an Hudec]], ''[[Miluj bl\u00ed\u017eneho svojho]]'' (\"Love thy neighbor\") commemorates the riots. During the filming, a resident of Topo\u013e\u010dany stated that \"Jews and Gypsies are the worst scum under the sun\".{{sfn|Balogov\u00e1|2004}} The statement was censored from the final documentary against the wishes of the filmmaker and the Slovak Jewish community.{{sfn|Mal\u00fd|2004}} The documentary was praised by Kamenec for bringing the incident to the attention of a broader audience.{{sfn|Kamenec|2018}} The Slovak writer [[Peter Bielik]] criticized the film, citing contemporary reports claiming that \"the Jews behaved very arrogantly and imperiously, trying to systematically occupy important positions in the economic, public, and political spheres\".

The underlying cause was [[secondary antisemitism|resurgent antisemitism]] directed at Jewish [[List of Holocaust survivors|Holocaust survivors]] who demanded the return of property that had been [[Aryanization (Nazism)|stolen]] during the Holocaust. Rumors spread that a local Catholic school would be nationalized and the nuns who taught there replaced by Jewish teachers.\n\nOn the morning of the incident, women demonstrated against the nationalization of the school, blaming Jews. That same day, a Jewish doctor was vaccinating children at the school. He was accused of poisoning non-Jewish children, sparking a riot. The police were unable to prevent it, and a local garrison of soldiers joined in. About forty-seven Jews were injured, and fifteen had to be hospitalized.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the events, international coverage embarrassed the Czechoslovak authorities and the [[Czechoslovak Communist Party]] exploited the riots to accuse the democratic authorities of ineffectiveness.\n\nA 2004 documentary film about the rioting, ''[[Miluj bl\u00ed\u017eneho svojho]]'' (\"Love thy neighbor\"), sparked increased discussion of the history of these events.

They also spread false rumors that Jewish property owners had reoccupied estates in [[Sicily]] after [[Allied invasion of Sicily|liberation]] in 1943, and shot Aryanizers.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=141}} After the liberation of Slovakia by the Red Army in March and April 1945, Holocaust survivors from Topo\u013e\u010dany faced a [[secondary antisemitism|resurgence of antisemitism]]. According to Slovak historian [[Ivan Kamenec]], their presence became an \"open and silent reproach\" to those Slovaks who had stood by or supported the persecution of Jews.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=127}} Many survivors attempted to regain the property that they had owned before the war. Those who had stolen Jewish property were reluctant to return it. Former partisans, or individuals claiming to have been partisans, had also appropriated some of the stolen property, in their view a rightful reward for their opposition to Nazism.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|2005|p=263}}{{sfn|Green|2015}} Jana \u0160i\u0161jakov\u00e1 also highlights the fascist regime's propaganda's lingering influence on perceptions of Jews.{{sfn|\u0160i\u0161jakov\u00e1|2008|pp=22\u201323}}\n\nThese two groups mounted a campaign of intimidation\u2014rioting, looting, assaults, and threats\u2014aimed at forcing Jews to leave and to give up their property claims.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|2005|p=263}}{{sfn|\u0160i\u0161jakov\u00e1|2008|p=23}} According to B\u00fcchler, \"the authorities did little to protect\" Holocaust survivors, instead casting their demands for property restitution and equal rights as \"provocative\". Meanwhile, officials ostensibly sympathetic to the Jews advised them to \"behave\" as to avoid inciting violence against them.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|2005|p=263}} One of the first post-liberation riots occurred in the eastern Slovak city of [[Ko\u0161ice]] on 2 May, before the end of the war. The Topo\u013e\u010dany pogrom is considered the most severe{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|2005|p=263}}{{sfn|\u0160i\u0161jakov\u00e1|2008|p=23}} or notorious{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=117}} anti-Jewish riot in postwar Slovakia. Overall, at least thirty-six Jews were murdered and more than one hundred injured between 1945 and 1948 in Slovakia, according to Polish historian Anna Cichopek.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=117}}\n\nFor four weeks prior to the riot, antisemites in Topo\u013e\u010dany distributed anti-Jewish propaganda and physically harassed Jews. In early September, nuns who taught at a local Catholic school for girls heard that their institution was about to be nationalized, and that they would be replaced. Although many Slovak schools were nationalized in 1945, rumors that it was due to a Jewish conspiracy and that Jewish teachers would replace gentiles were unfounded. The mothers of children at the school petitioned the government not to nationalize it and accused Jews of trying to take over the school for the benefit of Jewish children.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=127}} On Sunday, 23 September 1945, people threw stones at a young Jewish man at a train station and vandalized a house inhabited by Jews in nearby [[\u017dabokreky]]. The next day, gentile Slovaks gathered on the streets and chanted antisemitic slogans; a few Jews were assaulted and their homes burglarized. Policemen declined to intervene based on unfounded rumors that Jews had killed four children in Topo\u013e\u010dany. In [[Chynorany]] rumor held that thirty children had been murdered by Jews; at least one Jew was attacked and others were robbed.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=118}}{{sfn|\u0160i\u0161jakov\u00e1|2008|p=25}}\n\n== 24 September riot ==\nAt 8:00 on 24 September in Topo\u013e\u010dany, 60 women\u2014most of them mothers of local children\u2014went to the local district national committee (ONV) to demand that the nationalization be halted and Jewish children expelled from the school.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|pp=127\u2013128}} This was part of a larger pattern in which women, who had been among the most fervent supporters of the Slovak People's Party, played a central role in fomenting antisemitic demonstrations and violence.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=120}} The deputy chair of the ONV allegedly told them \"to take guns and go for the Jews\".{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=128}} Another official in the ONV supposedly said that the proposed nationalization was none of their business. The school inspector for the city intervened, trying to convince the protestors that the rumors of nationalization were not based in fact. By this time, about 160 people had were demonstrating outside of the office and circulating rumors of Jewish teachers replacing the nuns and Jews destroying Christian religious symbols.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=128}}{{sfn|Kub\u00e1tov\u00e1|Kub\u00e1t|2018|p=575}} Other rumors claimed that \"Jews do not work and still enjoy above average lifestyles and are involved in illegal business\".{{sfn|Kub\u00e1tov\u00e1|Kub\u00e1t|2018|p=575}}\n\n{{quotebox|Away with Jews, Jews are guilty of everything, expel Jewish children from our schools, and prohibit Jewish doctors, the Bergers, from vaccinating our children!|source=Antisemitic slogans attributed to the rioters{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=128}}|width=25em|quoted=yes}}\n\nWhen the women left the office, they began to chant antisemitic slogans and headed towards the school. The local police office, consisting of seven men, attempted to disperse them, but failed.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=129}} The women began to accuse a local Jewish doctor, Karol Berger, who was at the school that day to vaccinate seven- and eight-year-old children, of poisoning them instead. This precipitated the large-scale violence that was to follow. When they arrived at the school, the women broke inside. Misinterpreting the cries made by children upset by the rioting, they accosted Berger, shouting \"You Jew, you poison our children!\".{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=128}}{{sfn|Kub\u00e1tov\u00e1|Kub\u00e1t|2018|pp=575\u2013576}} Berger was taken outside and handed over to the crowd. With a Jewish soldier, he managed to escape and hid in the police office before joining other Jewish victims in the hospital later that day. Cichopek and Kamenec estimate that 200 to 300 people of the 9,000 residents of Topo\u013e\u010dany participated in the riot, physically assaulting local Jews on the street and burglarizing their homes.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|pp=128\u2013129}}\n\nJews sheltering at the police station were protected by the policemen. Teachers at the school resisted demands to turn over Jewish children.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=129}}{{sfn|Bartov\u00e1|2016|p=521}} However, when the city council called in twenty{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=129}} or thirty{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|2005|p=267}} soldiers stationed nearby to restore order, most instead joined the rioters. Soldiers had also attacked Jews during the [[Krak\u00f3w pogrom]] a month earlier in Poland.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|pp=125, 129}} According to one report, the commander of the army unit was inexperienced and ineffective, unable to prevent his men from answering the call to \"Soldiers come with us to beat the Jews!\"{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=129}} Offering escort to the police headquarters, soldiers led Jews out of apartments only to turn them over to the rioters. At noon, a special auxiliary unit finally managed to put an end to the violence, and the streets were quiet by 13:00{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=129}} although smaller groups still tried to accost Jews.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|2005|p=267}} Reinforcements of policemen from Bratislava, an hour's drive away, were requested at 9:30 but did not arrive until 18:00, when the riot was already over.{{sfn|Green|2015}}{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=129}} Municipal authorities responded sluggishly to the unfolding events, not denouncing the rumors that had led to violence until 18:45.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=129}}\n\nForty-seven{{sfn|Green|2015}} or forty-eight Jews were injured, and fifteen of them had to be hospitalized.{{sfn|Hrd\u00fd|2013}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{quotebox|[A]ccording to all signs, all these described events are organised, organised by Aryanisers who herewith wanted to prevent the restitution of property.|source=Ondrej Weiss and Ernest Kohn, survivors from a nearby village{{sfn|Kub\u00e1tov\u00e1|Kub\u00e1t|2018|p=576}}|width=25em|quoted=yes|align=left}}\nThe next day, between nine and eleven of the most active rioters were arrested by the policemen from Bratislava; most were young men between the age of seventeen and twenty-four. Later arrests brought the total number to some fifty civilians arrested; most were imprisoned either at [[Ilava]] labor camp or the prison in Topo\u013e\u010dany.  Separately, the military arrested the twenty soldiers who participated in the riot.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|pp=129\u2013130}} An investigation by the Health Commission found that the vaccines delivered by Berger were not harmful.{{sfn|Kub\u00e1tov\u00e1|Kub\u00e1t|2018|p=576}}\n\nAlong with similar incidents elsewhere in Slovakia and in Poland, the rioting in Topo\u013e\u010dany drew international condemnation that embarrassed the Czechoslovak authorities.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|2005|p=267}}{{sfn|\u0160i\u0161jakov\u00e1|2008|p=23}} Only two Slovak newspapers, ''\u010cas'' and ''[[Pravda (Slovakia)|Pravda]]'', published articles relating to the rioting, the first of which was published six days later. The ''Pravda'' newspaper, an organ of the [[Czechoslovak Communist Party]], used the riots to attack the democratic [[Third Czechoslovak Republic]] of being ineffectual unable to govern. In contrast, ''\u010cas'', affiliated with the [[Democratic Party (Slovakia, 1944)|Democratic Party]], focused on the moral bankruptcy of antisemitism as part of a broader postwar moral crisis and called upon Slovak Jews to patiently await the restoration of property by the courts.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|pp=130, 135}}{{sfn|\u0160i\u0161jakov\u00e1|2008|p=27}} ''Pravda'' published an interview with [[Karol \u0160midke]], the leader of the Communists in the [[Slovak National Council]], who emphasized the \"fascist elements\" who were supposedly plotting the destruction of the new order and called on them to be punished harshly in order to root them out.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=135}}\n\n\u0160midke's statements represented the official position of the Czechoslovak and Slovak governments, which concluded that the rioting was not spontaneous, but organized by a fascist conspiracy. The authorities recommended that the government be purged of alleged [[reactionary]] elements. The Slovak police, which stated that the rioting was caused by Catholic elements and the Slovak State's antisemitic propaganda, recommended dismissing the [[Religious sisters|mother superior]] and the Catholic principal of the school. It also highlighted aryanizers as the \"spiritual instigators\" of the violence.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|pp=136\u2013137}} The main concern of the authorities was not the welfare of Jewish citizens, but the failure of the state to maintain order.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|2005|p=267}} Overall, the response was sluggish and many administrators used the incident as an excuse to accuse others of unrelated misbehavior.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=137}} According to Robert B\u00fcchler, the authorities only responded to the rioting because the international coverage embarrassed the postwar government.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|2005|p=267}}\n\n{{quotebox|There are very few people in Topo\u013e\u010dany who would not approve of the events of 24 September 1945.

Accusations that the Jews had provoked the riots due to their \"provocative behavior\" and refusal to integrate with Slovak society were added to later reports. The farther away the reports were produced and the later, the more virulent the blaming of Jews became; a 15 October report by the police commissioner in Bratislava claimed that \"the main blame for the demonstrations rests on the provocative behavior of citizens of the Israelite religion against Christian citizens\".{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|pp=137\u2013138}} Contrary to the wishes of the rioters, very few Jews left in the immediate aftermath of the 1945 pogrom; most remained behind to rebuild their lives and fight for the restitution of property.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|2005|p=267}} By 1948, there were still 344 Jews living in Topo\u013e\u010dany, but many emigrated in 1949 to the newly formed state of Israel, the United States, Australia, Mexico, and other countries.{{sfn|Bartov\u00e1|2016|p=521}} {{As of|2015}}, there are no longer any Jews living in the town.{{sfn|Hrd\u00fd|2013}}{{sfn|Green|2015}}\n\n== Modern interpretations ==\nWriting about postwar anti-Jewish violence in Poland, [[Jan T. Gross]] argued that \"Jews were perceived as a threat to the material status quo, security, and peaceful conscience\" of their non-Jewish neighbors. Cichopek notes that it is impossible to prove what non-Jewish Poles and Slovaks were thinking after the war. Both Gross and Kamenec, in his analysis of the Topo\u013e\u010dany pogrom, focus more on material aspects while previous writers had emphasized the influence of antisemitic stereotypes. Kamenec argued that the consequences of Aryanization caused the resurgence of antisemitism.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|pp=140\u2013141}} According to Kamenec, \u0160i\u0161jakov\u00e1, and Cichopek, the lack of comprehensive legislation and competent administration of property transfer back to Jewish owners also contributed to uncertainty and anti-Jewish sentiment.{{sfn|\u0160i\u0161jakov\u00e1|2008|p=23}}{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=141}} However, Cichopek also emphasizes the role of antisemitic myths, such as [[blood libel]], in fueling violence; she points out that without the vaccination hysteria, the rioting in Topo\u013e\u010dany would not have occurred or could have happened in a different way.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=141}}\n\nCichopek argues that the Tiso regime, by its collaborationism with the Nazis and sending Jewish citizens to death camps, discredited antisemitism in postwar Slovakia. She also points out that the fascist regime also prevented the violence and chaos which had reigned for years in Poland under Nazi occupation, and that there were no extermination camps on Slovak soil. In Slovakia, the [[Judeo-Bolshevist]] canard was not prominent; instead Jews were accused of supporting [[Hungarian irredentism]]. According to Cichopek, these factors partially explain why the postwar anti-Jewish violence in Slovakia was less than that in Poland.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|pp=143}} [[Milan Stanislav \u010eurica]], a nationalist and Catholic theologian, blamed the victims in his analysis of the events.{{sfn | Bartov\u00e1|2016|p=521}} According to B\u00fcchler, the pogrom illuminates  the \"miserable situation\" for Jews in Slovakia after liberation, as well as the indifference of the authorities to \"the existential problems of the Jewish survivors\".{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|2005|pp=263\u2013264}}\n\n== Legacy ==\nA 2004 Slovak documentary film by [[Du\u0161an Hudec]], ''[[Miluj bl\u00ed\u017eneho svojho]]'' (\"Love thy neighbor\") commemorates the riots. During the filming, a resident of Topo\u013e\u010dany stated that \"Jews and Gypsies are the worst scum under the sun\".{{sfn|Balogov\u00e1|2004}} The statement was censored from the final documentary against the wishes of the filmmaker and the Slovak Jewish community.{{sfn|Mal\u00fd|2004}} The documentary was praised by Kamenec for bringing the incident to the attention of a broader audience.{{sfn|Kamenec|2018}} The Slovak writer [[Peter Bielik]] criticized the film, citing contemporary reports claiming that \"the Jews behaved very arrogantly and imperiously, trying to systematically occupy important positions in the economic, public, and political spheres\".
