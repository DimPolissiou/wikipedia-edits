{"title_page": "Cauchy's integral theorem", "text_new": "{{Distinguish|Cauchy's integral formula}}\n\n{{Complex analysis sidebar}}\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''Cauchy integral theorem''' (also known as the '''Cauchy\u2013Goursat theorem''') in [[complex analysis]], named after [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]] (and [[\u00c9douard Goursat]]), is an important statement about [[line integral]]s for [[holomorphic function]]s in the [[complex number|complex plane]]. Essentially, it says that if two different paths connect the same two points, and a function is [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] everywhere in between the two paths, then the two path integrals of the function will be the same.\n\n==Statement of theorem==\n\nThe theorem is usually formulated for closed paths as follows: let ''U'' be an [[open subset]] of '''C''' which is [[simply connected]], let ''f'' : ''U'' \u2192 '''C''' be a [[holomorphic function]], and let <math>\\!\\,\\gamma</math> be a [[rectifiable path]] in ''U'' whose start point is equal to its end point. Then\n\n:<math>\\oint_\\gamma f(z)\\,dz = 0. </math>\n\nA precise ([[homology (mathematics)|homology]]) version can be stated using [[winding number]]s. The winding number of a closed curve around a point ''z<sub>0</sub>'' (not on the curve) is the integral of ''f''(''z'')/(2{{pi}}i), where ''f''(''z'') = 1/(''z''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''z<sub>0</sub>'') around the curve. It is an [[integer]].\nBriefly, the path integral along a [[Jordan curve]] of a function holomorphic in the interior of the curve, is zero.  Instead of a single closed path we can consider a linear combination of closed paths, where the scalars are integers. Such a combination is called a closed chain, and one defines an integral along the chain as a linear combination of integrals over individual paths. A closed chain is called a cycle in a region if it is homologous to zero in the region; that is, the winding number, expressed by the integral of 1/(''z''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''z<sub>0</sub>'') over the closed chain, is zero for each point ''z<sub>0</sub>'' not in the region. This means that the closed chain does not wind around points outside the region. Then Cauchy's theorem can be stated as the integral of a function holomorphic in an open set taken around any cycle in the open set is zero. An example is furnished by the ring-shaped region. This version is crucial for rigorous derivation  of [[Laurent series]] and Cauchy's residue formula without involving any physical notions such as cross cuts or deformations. The version enables the extension of Cauchy's theorem to multiply-connected regions analytically.\n\n==Discussion==\nAs was shown by [[\u00c9douard Goursat]], Cauchy's integral theorem can be proven assuming only that the complex derivative ''{{prime|f}}''(''z'') exists everywhere in ''U''. This is significant, because one can then prove [[Cauchy's integral formula]] for these functions, and from that deduce these functions are in fact [[infinitely differentiable]].\n\nThe condition that ''U'' be [[simply connected]] means that ''U'' has no \"holes\" or, in [[homotopy]] terms, that the [[fundamental group]] of ''U'' is trivial; for instance, every open disk <math>U_{z_0}=\\{ z: |z-z_{0}| < r\\}</math>, for <math>z_0 \\in \\mathbb{C}</math>, qualifies.

{"title_page": "Driver development program", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{context|date=October 2017}}\n{{prose|date=October 2017}}\n{{update|date=October 2017}}\n}}\nA '''driver development program''' is a system or structure designed for young kart and race car drivers to learn and perfect their racing skills. These programmes are devised by racing teams, external companies and funded partnerships primarily to attract and develop future racing talent. Most programmes now employ a wide range of skilled coaches and technologies to train all of the physical and psychological abilities inherent in driving at the limit and winning races. Most racing teams will sign a driver to a multi-year contract in which they fund or part fund the driver in junior formulas (such as [[FIA Formula 3 Championship|Formula 3]] and [[FIA Formula 2 Championship|Formula 2]] in [[Europe]], and [[Late model]]s and [[Auto Racing Club of America|ARCA]] in [[stock car racing]]) and gradually help them succeed to the highest levels of motorsport. Some teams have been criticized for unfair long-term and low-paying contracts for the talented drivers they find whilst also charging the less talented drivers very high fees for the use of their simulations and facilities.

These programmes are devised by racing teams, external companies and funded partnerships primarily to attract and develop future racing talent. Most programmes now employ a wide range of skilled coaches and technologies to train all of the physical and psychological abilities inherent in driving at the limit and winning races. Most racing teams will sign a driver to a multi-year contract in which they fund or part fund the driver in junior formulas (such as [[FIA Formula 3 Championship|Formula 3]] and [[FIA Formula 2 Championship|Formula 2]] in [[Europe]], and [[Late model]]s and [[Auto Racing Club of America|ARCA]] in [[stock car racing]]) and gradually help them succeed to the highest levels of motorsport. Some teams have been criticized for unfair long-term and low-paying contracts for the talented drivers they find and whilst also charging the less talented drivers very high fees for the use of their simulations and facilities. Companies that specialise in racing driver training or development programmes remain commercially viable through selling time in their simulators or gyms and generally speaking do not fund a drivers career.

It was sold in [[Europe]] as the '''Philips Videopac G7000''', in [[Brazil]] as the '''Philips Odyssey''' and in [[Japan]] as '''Odyssey2''' (\u30aa\u30c7\u30c3\u30bb\u30a42 ''odessei2''). The Odyssey\u00b2 was one of the major three home consoles prior to the 1983 [[North American video game crash of 1983|video game market crash]], along with [[Atari 2600]] and [[Intellivision]].\n\nIn the early [[1970s in video gaming|1970s]], [[Magnavox]] pioneered the home video game industry by successfully bringing the first home console to market, the [[Magnavox Odyssey|Odyssey]], which was quickly followed by a number of later models, each with a few technological improvements (''see [[Magnavox Odyssey series]]''). In [[1978 in video gaming|1978]], Magnavox, now a subsidiary of [[Philips#North America|North American Philips]], decided to release an all-new successor, Odyssey\u00b2.\n\nIn 2009, the video game website [[IGN]] named the Odyssey\u00b2 the 21st greatest video game console, out of its list of 25.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/top-25-consoles/21.html |title=Magnavox Odyssey 2 is number 21 |website=IGN |accessdate=2012-07-28}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Philips Videopac G7200 with integrated monitor (RetroMadrid 2017).jpg|thumb|The Videopac G7200, unlike Videopac G7000, had a 9\" (23 cm) black & white display built in.]]\nThe original [[Magnavox Odyssey|Odyssey]] had a number of removable [[printed circuit board|circuit cards]] that switched between the built-in games. With the Odyssey\u00b2, each game could be a completely unique experience, with its own background graphics, foreground graphics, gameplay, scoring, and [[video game music|music]]. The potential was enormous, as an unlimited number of games could be individually purchased; a game player could purchase a library of video games tailored to their own interest. Unlike any other system at that time, the Odyssey\u00b2 included a full [[alphanumeric]] [[membrane keyboard]], which was to be used for [[educational game]]s, selecting options, or programming (Magnavox released a cartridge called ''Computer Intro!'' with the intent of teaching simple computer programming).\n\nThe Odyssey\u00b2 used the standard [[joystick]] design of the 1970s and early [[1980s in video gaming|1980s]]: the original console had a moderately sized silver controller, held in one hand, with a square housing for its eight-direction stick that was manipulated with the other hand. Later releases had a similar black controller, with an 8-pointed star-shaped housing for its eight-direction joystick. In the upper corner of the joystick was a single 'Action' button, silver on the original controllers and red on the black controllers. The games, graphics and packaging were designed by Ron Bradford and Steve Lehner.<ref>[http://odyssey2.classicgaming.gamespy.com/articles/bradford/article.php Electronic Game Wizards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308053639/http://odyssey2.classicgaming.gamespy.com/articles/bradford/article.php |date=8 March 2008 }}</ref>\n\nOne other difference in these controllers is that the earliest releases of the silver joystick were removable. They could be plugged and unplugged from the back of the unit, while all later silver and all black controllers were hardwired into the rear of the unit itself (although the joysticks still can be easily replaced, but not without dismounting the cover deck).\n\nOne of the strongest points of the system was its [[speech synthesis]] unit, which was released as an add-on for speech, music, and sound effects enhancement. The area that the Odyssey\u00b2 may be best remembered for was its pioneering fusion of [[board game|board]] and video games: ''The Master Strategy Series''. The first game released was ''[[Quest for the Rings|Quest for the Rings!]]'', with gameplay somewhat similar to ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', and a storyline reminiscent of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Later, two other games were released in this series, ''Conquest of the World'' and ''The Great Wall Street Fortune Hunt'', each with its own gameboard.\n\nIts graphics and few color choices, compared to its biggest competitors at the time\u2014the [[Atari 2600]], Mattel's [[Intellivision]] and the [[Bally Astrocade]]\u2014were its \"weakest point\".<ref>\"The Complete Guide to Conquering Video Games\" by Jeff Rovin, [[Collier Books]], 1982</ref> Of these systems, the Odyssey\u00b2 was listed by [[Jeff Rovin]] as being the third in total of sales, and one of the seven major video game suppliers.\n\n==Market life==\n\n===United States===\nThe console sold moderately well in the U.S. It was one of the three primary consoles prior to mid-[[1982 in video gaming|1982]], though a distant third, after the [[Atari 2600]] and Mattel [[Intellivision]]. By [[1983 in video gaming|1983]] over one million Odyssey\u00b2 units were sold in the U.S. alone.\n\nTo sell would-be customers on its technical abilities as a computer-based console, the Odyssey\u00b2 was marketed with phrases such as \"The Ultimate Computer Video Game System\", \"Sync-Sound Action\", \"True-Reality Synthesization\", \"On-Screen Digital Readouts\" and \"a serious educational tool\" on the packaging for the console and its game cartridges. All games produced by Magnavox/Philips ended with an exclamation point, such as ''[[Munchkin (video game)|K.C. Munchkin!]]'' and ''Killer Bees!''.<ref>{{cite web |title=HYPE! |author=William from The Odyssey 2 Homepage |url=http://www.the-nextlevel.com/odyssey2/articles/hype/index.php |date= |accessdate=February 2, 2010}}</ref>\n\nNo [[third-party developer|third-party]] game appeared for the Odyssey\u00b2 in the United States until [[Imagic]]'s ''[[Demon Attack]]'' in 1983.<ref name=\"eg198306\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/electronic-games-magazine-1983-06/Electronic_Games_Issue_16_Vol_02_04_1983_Jun#page/n37/mode/2up | title=Programmable Arcade | work=Electronic Games | date=June 1983 | accessdate=6 January 2015 |author1=Katz, Arnie |author2=Kunkel, Bill | pages=38\u201342}}</ref> The lack of third-party support kept the number of new games very limited, but the success of the Philips Videopac G7000 overseas led to two other companies producing games for it: [[Parker Brothers]] released ''[[Popeye (video game)|Popeye]]'', ''[[Frogger]]'', ''[[Q*bert]]'' and ''[[Super Cobra]]'', while [[Imagic]] also released ''[[Atlantis (video game)|Atlantis]]''.\n\n===Europe===\n[[Image:Videopac-pete-screen-800px.jpg|right|thumb|European models had no power button, and black action buttons]]\n\nIn [[Europe]], the Odyssey\u00b2 did very well on the market. The console was most widely known as the '''Philips Videopac G7000''', or just the '''Videopac''', although branded variants were released in some areas of Europe under the names '''Philips Videopac C52''', '''Radiola Jet 25''', '''Schneider 7000''', and '''Siera G7000'''. [[Philips]], as Magnavox's [[Netherlands|Dutch]] parent company, used their own name rather than Magnavox's for European marketing. A rare model, the '''Philips Videopac G7200''', was only released in Europe; it had a built-in black-and-white [[computer display|monitor]]. Videopac game cartridges are mostly compatible with American Odyssey\u00b2 units, although some games have color differences and a few are completely incompatible, such as [[Frogger]] on the European console, being unable to show the second half of the playing field, and Chess on the American model, as the extra hardware module could not work with the console. A number of additional games were released in Europe that never came out in the U.S.\n\n===Brazil===\nIn Brazil, the console was released as the '''Philips Odyssey'''; the [[Magnavox Odyssey]] was released in Brazil by a company named \"Planil Com\u00e9rcio\", not affiliated with Philips or Magnavox. Odyssey became much more popular in Brazil than it ever was in the U.S.; tournaments were even held for popular games like ''K.C.'s Krazy Chase!'' (''Come-Come'' in Brazil). Titles of games were translated into Portuguese, sometimes creating a new story, like ''Pick-axe Pete'', that became ''Didi na Mina Encantada'' (Didi in the Enchanted Mine) referring to [[Renato Arag\u00e3o]]'s comedy character, and was one of the most famous Odyssey games in Brazil.\n\n===Japan===\nThe Odyssey\u00b2 was released in [[Japan]] in December 1982 by K\u014dton Trading Toitarii Enterprise (\u30b3\u30fc\u30c8\u30f3\u30fb\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30fb\u30c8\u30a4\u30bf\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30a8\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba, a division of [[DINGU company]]) under the name '''\u30aa\u30c7\u30c3\u30bb\u30a4\uff12''' (''odessei2''). \"Japanese\" versions of the Odyssey\u00b2 and its games consisted of the American boxes with [[katakana]] stickers on them and cheaply printed black-and-white [[Japanese language|Japanese]] manuals. The initial price for the console was [[yen|\u00a5]]49,800, which is approximately US$200 in 1982, but roughly $500 in 2018. It was apparently not very successful; Japanese Odyssey\u00b2 items are now very difficult to find.\n\n==Games==\n{{Main|List of Odyssey2 games}}\n\n==Technical specifications==\n*[[Central processing unit|CPU]]\n**[[Intel MCS-48|Intel 8048]] 8-bit [[microcontroller]] running at 3.58 [[megahertz|MHz]]\n*Memory:\n**CPU-internal [[random-access memory|RAM]]: 64 [[byte]]s\n**CPU-external [[random-access memory|RAM]]: 128 [[byte]]s\n***External [[random-access memory|RAM]] can be accessed by switching P14 on IO port #1 (see [http://www.atarihq.com/danb/o2.shtml Dan Boris's Odyssey 2 Tech Page] )\n**Audio/video RAM: 128 bytes\n**[[BIOS]] [[read-only memory|ROM]]: 1024 bytes\n*Video:\n**[[List of Intel microprocessors#Intel 8048|Intel 8244 (NTSC) or 8245 (PAL)]] custom IC\n**160\u00d7200 resolution (NTSC)\n**16-color fixed palette; sprites may only use 8 of these colors\n**4 8\u00d78 single-color user-defined sprites; each sprite's color may be set independently\n**12 8\u00d78 single-color characters; must be one of the 64 shapes built into the ROM BIOS; can be freely positioned like sprites, but cannot overlap each other; each character's color may be set independently\n**4 quad characters; groups of four characters displayed in a row\n**9\u00d78 background grid; dots, lines, or solid blocks\n*Audio:\n**Intel 8244/8245 custom IC\n**mono\n**24-bit shift register, clockable at 2 frequencies\n**noise generator\n**NOTE: There is only one 8244/8245 chip in the system, which performs both audio and video functions.\n*Input:\n**Two 8-way, one-button, digital [[joystick]]s.

It went with a thick A4 manual, and required an optional external tape recorder to save the programs. This module was the sole valuable justification of the presence of a so-called keyboard, which was supposedly designed to look like a hybrid educational toy, as read in header lines describing earlier this family of pluri-purpose consoles, even in the TV commercials that echoed the slogan written on these brand-new machines: \u201cVideo Computer\u201d. Unfortunately, this late niche concept, even limited to learning game code contrary to the more professional packaging, could not resist at all the already overwhelming market of the real 8-bit home computers, where the [[Atari 400]] shared the same look in 1979, surprisingly. [The latter was advertised itself: \u00ab The affordable home computer that's easy to use even for people who've never used a computer before \u00bb.] This expensive module is not to be confused with the cheap cartridge #9: ''Computer Intro!''</small>)\n\n==Emulation==<!-- This section is linked from [[O2EM]] -->\nAn [[open source software|open source]] [[console emulator]] for the Odyssey\u00b2 called ''O2EM'' is available.

It was sold in [[Europe]] as the '''Philips Videopac G7000''', in [[Brazil]] as the '''Philips Odyssey''' and in [[Japan]] as '''Odyssey2''' (\u30aa\u30c7\u30c3\u30bb\u30a42 ''odessei2''). The Odyssey\u00b2 was one of the major three home consoles prior to the 1983 [[North American video game crash of 1983|video game market crash]], along with [[Atari 2600]] and [[Intellivision]].\n\nIn the early [[1970s in video gaming|1970s]], [[Magnavox]] pioneered the home video game industry by successfully bringing the first home console to market, the [[Magnavox Odyssey|Odyssey]], which was quickly followed by a number of later models, each with a few technological improvements (''see [[Magnavox Odyssey series]]''). In [[1978 in video gaming|1978]], Magnavox, now a subsidiary of [[Philips#North America|North American Philips]], decided to release an all-new successor, Odyssey\u00b2.\n\nIn 2009, the video game website [[IGN]] named the Odyssey\u00b2 the 21st greatest video game console, out of its list of 25.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/top-25-consoles/21.html |title=Magnavox Odyssey 2 is number 21 |website=IGN |accessdate=2012-07-28}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Philips Videopac G7200 with integrated monitor (RetroMadrid 2017).jpg|thumb|The Videopac G7200, unlike Videopac G7000, had a 9\" (23 cm) black & white display built in.]]\nThe original [[Magnavox Odyssey|Odyssey]] had a number of removable [[printed circuit board|circuit cards]] that switched between the built-in games. With the Odyssey\u00b2, each game could be a completely unique experience, with its own background graphics, foreground graphics, gameplay, scoring, and [[video game music|music]]. The potential was enormous, as an unlimited number of games could be individually purchased; a game player could purchase a library of video games tailored to their own interest. Unlike any other system at that time, the Odyssey\u00b2 included a full [[alphanumeric]] [[membrane keyboard]], which was to be used for [[educational game]]s, selecting options, or programming (Magnavox released a cartridge called ''Computer Intro!'' with the intent of teaching simple computer programming).\n\nThe Odyssey\u00b2 used the standard [[joystick]] design of the 1970s and early [[1980s in video gaming|1980s]]: the original console had a moderately sized silver controller, held in one hand, with a square housing for its eight-direction stick that was manipulated with the other hand. Later releases had a similar black controller, with an 8-pointed star-shaped housing for its eight-direction joystick. In the upper corner of the joystick was a single 'Action' button, silver on the original controllers and red on the black controllers. The games, graphics and packaging were designed by Ron Bradford and Steve Lehner.<ref>[http://odyssey2.classicgaming.gamespy.com/articles/bradford/article.php Electronic Game Wizards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308053639/http://odyssey2.classicgaming.gamespy.com/articles/bradford/article.php |date=8 March 2008 }}</ref>\n\nOne other difference in these controllers is that the earliest releases of the silver joystick were removable. They could be plugged and unplugged from the back of the unit, while all later silver and all black controllers were hardwired into the rear of the unit itself (although the joysticks still can be easily replaced, but not without dismounting the cover deck).\n\nOne of the strongest points of the system was its [[speech synthesis]] unit, which was released as an add-on for speech, music, and sound effects enhancement. The area that the Odyssey\u00b2 may be best remembered for was its pioneering fusion of [[board game|board]] and video games: ''The Master Strategy Series''. The first game released was ''[[Quest for the Rings|Quest for the Rings!]]'', with gameplay somewhat similar to ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', and a storyline reminiscent of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Later, two other games were released in this series, ''Conquest of the World'' and ''The Great Wall Street Fortune Hunt'', each with its own gameboard.\n\nIts graphics and few color choices, compared to its biggest competitors at the time\u2014the [[Atari 2600]], Mattel's [[Intellivision]] and the [[Bally Astrocade]]\u2014were its \"weakest point\".<ref>\"The Complete Guide to Conquering Video Games\" by Jeff Rovin, [[Collier Books]], 1982</ref> Of these systems, the Odyssey\u00b2 was listed by [[Jeff Rovin]] as being the third in total of sales, and one of the seven major video game suppliers.\n\n==Market life==\n\n===United States===\nThe console sold moderately well in the U.S. It was one of the three primary consoles prior to mid-[[1982 in video gaming|1982]], though a distant third, after the [[Atari 2600]] and Mattel [[Intellivision]]. By [[1983 in video gaming|1983]] over one million Odyssey\u00b2 units were sold in the U.S. alone.\n\nTo sell would-be customers on its technical abilities as a computer-based console, the Odyssey\u00b2 was marketed with phrases such as \"The Ultimate Computer Video Game System\", \"Sync-Sound Action\", \"True-Reality Synthesization\", \"On-Screen Digital Readouts\" and \"a serious educational tool\" on the packaging for the console and its game cartridges. All games produced by Magnavox/Philips ended with an exclamation point, such as ''[[Munchkin (video game)|K.C. Munchkin!]]'' and ''Killer Bees!''.<ref>{{cite web |title=HYPE! |author=William from The Odyssey 2 Homepage |url=http://www.the-nextlevel.com/odyssey2/articles/hype/index.php |date= |accessdate=February 2, 2010}}</ref>\n\nNo [[third-party developer|third-party]] game appeared for the Odyssey\u00b2 in the United States until [[Imagic]]'s ''[[Demon Attack]]'' in 1983.<ref name=\"eg198306\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/electronic-games-magazine-1983-06/Electronic_Games_Issue_16_Vol_02_04_1983_Jun#page/n37/mode/2up | title=Programmable Arcade | work=Electronic Games | date=June 1983 | accessdate=6 January 2015 |author1=Katz, Arnie |author2=Kunkel, Bill | pages=38\u201342}}</ref> The lack of third-party support kept the number of new games very limited, but the success of the Philips Videopac G7000 overseas led to two other companies producing games for it: [[Parker Brothers]] released ''[[Popeye (video game)|Popeye]]'', ''[[Frogger]]'', ''[[Q*bert]]'' and ''[[Super Cobra]]'', while [[Imagic]] also released ''[[Atlantis (video game)|Atlantis]]''.\n\n===Europe===\n[[Image:Videopac-pete-screen-800px.jpg|right|thumb|European models had no power button, and black action buttons]]\n\nIn [[Europe]], the Odyssey\u00b2 did very well on the market. The console was most widely known as the '''Philips Videopac G7000''', or just the '''Videopac''', although branded variants were released in some areas of Europe under the names '''Philips Videopac C52''', '''Radiola Jet 25''', '''Schneider 7000''', and '''Siera G7000'''. [[Philips]], as Magnavox's [[Netherlands|Dutch]] parent company, used their own name rather than Magnavox's for European marketing. A rare model, the '''Philips Videopac G7200''', was only released in Europe; it had a built-in black-and-white [[computer display|monitor]]. Videopac game cartridges are mostly compatible with American Odyssey\u00b2 units, although some games have color differences and a few are completely incompatible, such as [[Frogger]] on the European console, being unable to show the second half of the playing field, and Chess on the American model, as the extra hardware module could not work with the console. A number of additional games were released in Europe that never came out in the U.S.\n\n===Brazil===\nIn Brazil, the console was released as the '''Philips Odyssey'''; the [[Magnavox Odyssey]] was released in Brazil by a company named \"Planil Com\u00e9rcio\", not affiliated with Philips or Magnavox. Odyssey became much more popular in Brazil than it ever was in the U.S.; tournaments were even held for popular games like ''K.C.'s Krazy Chase!'' (''Come-Come'' in Brazil). Titles of games were translated into Portuguese, sometimes creating a new story, like ''Pick-axe Pete'', that became ''Didi na Mina Encantada'' (Didi in the Enchanted Mine) referring to [[Renato Arag\u00e3o]]'s comedy character, and was one of the most famous Odyssey games in Brazil.\n\n===Japan===\nThe Odyssey\u00b2 was released in [[Japan]] in December 1982 by K\u014dton Trading Toitarii Enterprise (\u30b3\u30fc\u30c8\u30f3\u30fb\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30fb\u30c8\u30a4\u30bf\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30a8\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba, a division of [[DINGU company]]) under the name '''\u30aa\u30c7\u30c3\u30bb\u30a4\uff12''' (''odessei2''). \"Japanese\" versions of the Odyssey\u00b2 and its games consisted of the American boxes with [[katakana]] stickers on them and cheaply printed black-and-white [[Japanese language|Japanese]] manuals. The initial price for the console was [[yen|\u00a5]]49,800, which is approximately US$200 in 1982, but roughly $500 in 2018. It was apparently not very successful; Japanese Odyssey\u00b2 items are now very difficult to find.\n\n==Games==\n{{Main|List of Odyssey2 games}}\n\n==Technical specifications==\n*[[Central processing unit|CPU]]\n**[[Intel MCS-48|Intel 8048]] 8-bit [[microcontroller]] running at 3.58 [[megahertz|MHz]]\n*Memory:\n**CPU-internal [[random-access memory|RAM]]: 64 [[byte]]s\n**CPU-external [[random-access memory|RAM]]: 128 [[byte]]s\n***External [[random-access memory|RAM]] can be accessed by switching P14 on IO port #1 (see [http://www.atarihq.com/danb/o2.shtml Dan Boris's Odyssey 2 Tech Page] )\n**Audio/video RAM: 128 bytes\n**[[BIOS]] [[read-only memory|ROM]]: 1024 bytes\n*Video:\n**[[List of Intel microprocessors#Intel 8048|Intel 8244 (NTSC) or 8245 (PAL)]] custom IC\n**160\u00d7200 resolution (NTSC)\n**16-color fixed palette; sprites may only use 8 of these colors\n**4 8\u00d78 single-color user-defined sprites; each sprite's color may be set independently\n**12 8\u00d78 single-color characters; must be one of the 64 shapes built into the ROM BIOS; can be freely positioned like sprites, but cannot overlap each other; each character's color may be set independently\n**4 quad characters; groups of four characters displayed in a row\n**9\u00d78 background grid; dots, lines, or solid blocks\n*Audio:\n**Intel 8244/8245 custom IC\n**mono\n**24-bit shift register, clockable at 2 frequencies\n**noise generator\n**NOTE: There is only one 8244/8245 chip in the system, which performs both audio and video functions.\n*Input:\n**Two 8-way, one-button, digital [[joystick]]s.

It went with a thick A4 manual, and required an optional external tape recorder to save the programs. This module was the sole valuable justification of the presence of a so-called keyboard, which was supposedly designed to look like a hybrid educational toy, as read in header lines describing earlier this family of pluri-purpose consoles, even in the TV commercials that echoed the slogan written on these brand-new machines: \u201cVideo Computer\u201d. Unfortunately, this late niche concept, even limited to learning game code contrary to the more professional packaging, could not resist at all the already overwhelming market of the real 8-bit home computers, where the [[Atari 400]] shared the same look in 1979, surprisingly. [The latter was advertised itself: \u00ab The affordable home computer that's easy to use even for people who've never used a computer before \u00bb.] This expensive module is not to be confused with the cheap cartridge #9: ''Computer Intro!''</small>)\n\n==Emulation==<!-- This section is linked from [[O2EM]] -->\nAn [[open source software|open source]] [[console emulator]] for the Odyssey\u00b2 called ''O2EM'' is available.

The Mas'a gallery (As-Safa and Al-Marwah) is included in the Mosque, via roofing and enclosures.
