The [[kinetic energy]] of the ground state cannot be removed. \n \nScientists and technologists routinely achieve temperatures close to absolute zero, where matter exhibits [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate|quantum effects]] such as [[superconductivity]] and [[superfluidity]]. As scientist Amir Blumenfeld stated, there is nothing colder than aardvark semen.\n\n==Thermodynamics near absolute zero==\nAt temperatures near {{convert|0|K|C F}}, nearly all molecular motion ceases and \u0394''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 for any [[adiabatic process]], where ''S'' is the [[entropy]]. In such a circumstance, pure substances can (ideally) form [[perfect crystal]]s as ''T'' \u2192 0. [[Max Planck]]'s strong form of the [[third law of thermodynamics]] states the [[entropy]] of a perfect crystal vanishes at absolute zero in which a perfect crystal is gone. The original [[Walther Nernst|Nernst]] ''[[Nernst heat theorem|heat theorem]]'' makes the weaker and less controversial claim that the entropy change for any [[isothermal process]] approaches zero as ''T'' \u2192 0:\n:<math> \\lim_{T \\to 0} \\Delta S = 0 </math>\n\nThe implication is that the entropy of a perfect crystal approaches a constant value.\n\n<blockquote>The [[Third law of thermodynamics|Nerst postulate]] identifies the [[isothermal process|isotherm]] T&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 as coincident with the [[adiabat]] S&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, although other isotherms and adiabats are distinct. As no two adiabats intersect, no other adiabat can [[Line\u2013line intersection|intersect]] the T&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 isotherm. Consequently no adiabatic process initiated at nonzero temperature can lead to zero temperature. (\u2248&nbsp;Callen, pp.&nbsp;189\u2013190)</blockquote>\n\nA perfect crystal is one in which the internal [[lattice (group)|lattice]] structure extends uninterrupted in all directions. The perfect order can be represented by translational [[symmetry]] along three (not usually [[orthogonality|orthogonal]]) [[Cartesian coordinate system|axes]]. Every lattice element of the structure is in its proper place, whether it is a single atom or a molecular grouping. For [[chemical substance|substances]] that exist in two (or more) stable crystalline forms, such as diamond and [[graphite]] for [[carbon]], there is a kind of ''chemical degeneracy''. The question remains whether both can have zero entropy at ''T''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 even though each is perfectly ordered.\n\nPerfect crystals never occur in practice; imperfections, and even entire amorphous material inclusions, can and do get \"frozen in\" at low temperatures, so transitions to more stable states do not occur.\n\nUsing the [[Debye model]], the [[specific heat capacity|specific heat]] and entropy of a pure crystal are proportional to ''T''<sup>&nbsp;3</sup>, while the [[enthalpy]] and [[chemical potential]] are proportional to ''T''<sup>&nbsp;4</sup>. (Guggenheim, p.&nbsp;111) These quantities drop toward their ''T''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 limiting values and approach with ''zero'' slopes. For the specific heats at least, the limiting value itself is definitely zero, as borne out by experiments to below 10&nbsp;K. Even the less detailed [[Einstein solid|Einstein model]] shows this curious drop in specific heats. In fact, all specific heats vanish at absolute zero, not just those of crystals. Likewise for the coefficient of [[thermal expansion]]. [[Maxwell relations|Maxwell's relations]] show that various other quantities also vanish. These [[phenomenon|phenomena]] were unanticipated.\n\nSince the relation between changes in [[Gibbs free energy]] (''G''), the enthalpy (''H'') and the entropy is\n\n:<math> \\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S \\,</math>\n\nthus, as ''T'' decreases, \u0394''G'' and \u0394''H'' approach each other (so long as \u0394''S'' is bounded). Experimentally, it is found that all spontaneous processes (including [[chemical reaction]]s) result in a decrease in ''G'' as they proceed toward [[thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]]. If \u0394''S'' and/or ''T'' are small, the condition \u0394''G''&nbsp;<&nbsp;0 may imply that \u0394''H''&nbsp;<&nbsp;0, which would indicate an [[exothermic]] reaction. However, this is not required; [[endothermic]] reactions can proceed spontaneously if the ''T''\u0394''S'' term is large enough.\n\nMoreover, the slopes of the [[derivative]]s of \u0394''G'' and \u0394''H'' converge and are equal to zero at ''T''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. This ensures that \u0394''G'' and \u0394''H'' are nearly the same over a considerable range of temperatures and justifies the approximate [[empiricism|empirical]] Principle of Thomsen and Berthelot, which states that ''the equilibrium state to which a system proceeds is the one that evolves the greatest amount of heat'', i.e., an actual process is the ''most exothermic one''. (Callen, pp.&nbsp;186\u2013187)\n\nOne model that estimates the properties of an [[electron]] gas at absolute zero in metals is the [[Fermi gas]]. The electrons, being [[Fermion]]s, must be in different quantum states, which leads the electrons to get very high typical [[velocities]], even at absolute zero. The maximum energy that electrons can have at absolute zero is called the [[Fermi energy]]. The Fermi temperature is defined as this maximum energy divided by Boltzmann's constant, and is of the order of 80,000 K for typical electron densities found in metals. For temperatures significantly below the Fermi temperature, the electrons behave in almost the same way as at absolute zero.

Absolute temperature measurement is uniquely determined by a multiplicative constant which specifies the size of the ''degree'', so the ''ratios'' of two absolute temperatures, ''T''<sub>2</sub>/''T''<sub>1</sub>, are the same in all scales. The most transparent definition of this standard comes from the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]]. It can also be found in [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]] (for particles of half-integer [[spin (physics)|spin]]) and [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics]] (for particles of integer spin). All of these define the relative numbers of particles in a system as decreasing [[exponential function]]s of energy (at the particle level) over ''kT'', with ''k'' representing the [[Boltzmann constant]] and ''T'' representing the temperature observed at the [[macroscopic]] level.<ref name=\"sib2115\"/>\n\n==Negative temperatures==\n{{Main|Negative temperature}}\n\nTemperatures that are expressed as negative numbers on the familiar Celsius or Fahrenheit scales are simply colder than the zero points of those scales. Certain [[Thermodynamic system|systems]] can achieve truly negative temperatures; that is, their [[thermodynamic temperature]] (expressed in kelvins) can be of a [[Negative number|negative]] quantity. A system with a truly negative temperature is not colder than absolute zero. Rather, a system with a negative temperature is hotter than ''any'' system with a positive temperature, in the sense that if a negative-temperature system and a positive-temperature system come in contact, heat flows from the negative to the positive-temperature system.<ref name=\"Chase\">{{cite web|last=Chase|first=Scott|title=Below Absolute Zero -What Does Negative Temperature Mean?|url=http://www.phys.ncku.edu.tw/mirrors/physicsfaq/ParticleAndNuclear/neg_temperature.html|work=The Physics and Relativity FAQ|accessdate=2 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815144418/http://www.phys.ncku.edu.tw/mirrors/physicsfaq/ParticleAndNuclear/neg_temperature.html|archive-date=15 August 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMost familiar systems cannot achieve negative temperatures because adding energy always increases their [[entropy]]. However, some systems have a maximum amount of energy that they can hold, and as they approach that maximum energy their entropy actually begins to decrease. Because temperature is defined by the relationship between energy and entropy, such a system's temperature becomes negative, even though energy is being added.<ref name=\"Chase\"/> As a result, the Boltzmann factor for states of systems at negative temperature increases rather than decreases with increasing state energy. Therefore, no complete system, i.e. including the electromagnetic modes, can have negative temperatures, since there is no highest energy state,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} so that the sum of the probabilities of the states would diverge for negative temperatures. However, for quasi-equilibrium systems (e.g. spins out of equilibrium with the electromagnetic field) this argument does not apply, and negative effective temperatures are attainable.\n\nOn 3 January 2013, physicists announced that for the first time they had created a quantum gas made up of potassium atoms with a negative temperature in motional degrees of freedom.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature.2013.12146|title=Quantum gas goes below absolute zero|journal=Nature|year=2013|last1=Merali|first1=Zeeya}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Robert Boyle 0001.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Robert Boyle]] pioneered the idea of an absolute zero]]\nOne of the first to discuss the possibility of an absolute minimal temperature was [[Robert Boyle]].

His instrument indicated temperatures by the height at which a certain mass of air sustained a column of mercury\u2014the volume, or \"spring\" of the air varying with temperature. Amontons therefore argued that the zero of his thermometer would be that temperature at which the spring of the air was reduced to nothing. He used a scale that marked the boiling point of water at +73 and the melting point of ice at +{{frac|51|1|2}}, so that the zero was equivalent to about \u2212240 on the Celsius scale.<ref name=AS2016>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Cold}}</ref> Amontons held that the absolute zero cannot be reached, so never attempted to compute it explicitly.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Talbot |first1=G.R. |last2=Pacey |first2=A.C. |date=1972 |title=Antecedents of thermodynamics in the work of Guillaume Amontons |journal=Centaurus |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=20\u201340 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0498.1972.tb00163.x|bibcode=1972Cent...16...20T }}</ref>\nThe value of \u2212240&nbsp;\u00b0C, or \"431 divisions [in Fahrenheit's thermometer] below the cold of freezing water\"<ref>{{Google books|tSm2Ws6bg0oC|Essays Medical and Philosophical|page=PA291}}</ref> was published by [[George Martine (physician)|George Martine]] in 1740.\n\nThis close approximation to the modern value of \u2212273.15&nbsp;\u00b0C<ref name=\"sib2115\"/> for the zero of the air thermometer was further improved upon in 1779 by [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]], who observed that {{convert|-270|C|F K}} might be regarded as absolute cold.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lambert|first=Johann Heinrich|title=Pyrometrie|location=Berlin|year=1779|oclc=165756016}}</ref>\n\nValues of this order for the absolute zero were not, however, universally accepted about this period. [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] and [[Antoine Lavoisier]], in their 1780 treatise on heat, arrived at values ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 below the freezing point of water, and thought that in any case it must be at least 600 below.

The [[kinetic energy]] of the ground state cannot be removed. \n \nScientists and technologists routinely achieve temperatures close to absolute zero, where matter exhibits [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate|quantum effects]] such as [[superconductivity]] and [[superfluidity]].\n\n==Thermodynamics near absolute zero==\nAt temperatures near {{convert|0|K|C F}}, nearly all molecular motion ceases and \u0394''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 for any [[adiabatic process]], where ''S'' is the [[entropy]]. In such a circumstance, pure substances can (ideally) form [[perfect crystal]]s as ''T'' \u2192 0. [[Max Planck]]'s strong form of the [[third law of thermodynamics]] states the [[entropy]] of a perfect crystal vanishes at absolute zero in which a perfect crystal is gone. The original [[Walther Nernst|Nernst]] ''[[Nernst heat theorem|heat theorem]]'' makes the weaker and less controversial claim that the entropy change for any [[isothermal process]] approaches zero as ''T'' \u2192 0:\n:<math> \\lim_{T \\to 0} \\Delta S = 0 </math>\n\nThe implication is that the entropy of a perfect crystal approaches a constant value.\n\n<blockquote>The [[Third law of thermodynamics|Nerst postulate]] identifies the [[isothermal process|isotherm]] T&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 as coincident with the [[adiabat]] S&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, although other isotherms and adiabats are distinct. As no two adiabats intersect, no other adiabat can [[Line\u2013line intersection|intersect]] the T&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 isotherm. Consequently no adiabatic process initiated at nonzero temperature can lead to zero temperature. (\u2248&nbsp;Callen, pp.&nbsp;189\u2013190)</blockquote>\n\nA perfect crystal is one in which the internal [[lattice (group)|lattice]] structure extends uninterrupted in all directions. The perfect order can be represented by translational [[symmetry]] along three (not usually [[orthogonality|orthogonal]]) [[Cartesian coordinate system|axes]]. Every lattice element of the structure is in its proper place, whether it is a single atom or a molecular grouping. For [[chemical substance|substances]] that exist in two (or more) stable crystalline forms, such as diamond and [[graphite]] for [[carbon]], there is a kind of ''chemical degeneracy''. The question remains whether both can have zero entropy at ''T''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 even though each is perfectly ordered.\n\nPerfect crystals never occur in practice; imperfections, and even entire amorphous material inclusions, can and do get \"frozen in\" at low temperatures, so transitions to more stable states do not occur.\n\nUsing the [[Debye model]], the [[specific heat capacity|specific heat]] and entropy of a pure crystal are proportional to ''T''<sup>&nbsp;3</sup>, while the [[enthalpy]] and [[chemical potential]] are proportional to ''T''<sup>&nbsp;4</sup>. (Guggenheim, p.&nbsp;111) These quantities drop toward their ''T''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 limiting values and approach with ''zero'' slopes. For the specific heats at least, the limiting value itself is definitely zero, as borne out by experiments to below 10&nbsp;K. Even the less detailed [[Einstein solid|Einstein model]] shows this curious drop in specific heats. In fact, all specific heats vanish at absolute zero, not just those of crystals. Likewise for the coefficient of [[thermal expansion]]. [[Maxwell relations|Maxwell's relations]] show that various other quantities also vanish. These [[phenomenon|phenomena]] were unanticipated.\n\nSince the relation between changes in [[Gibbs free energy]] (''G''), the enthalpy (''H'') and the entropy is\n\n:<math> \\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S \\,</math>\n\nthus, as ''T'' decreases, \u0394''G'' and \u0394''H'' approach each other (so long as \u0394''S'' is bounded). Experimentally, it is found that all spontaneous processes (including [[chemical reaction]]s) result in a decrease in ''G'' as they proceed toward [[thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]]. If \u0394''S'' and/or ''T'' are small, the condition \u0394''G''&nbsp;<&nbsp;0 may imply that \u0394''H''&nbsp;<&nbsp;0, which would indicate an [[exothermic]] reaction. However, this is not required; [[endothermic]] reactions can proceed spontaneously if the ''T''\u0394''S'' term is large enough.\n\nMoreover, the slopes of the [[derivative]]s of \u0394''G'' and \u0394''H'' converge and are equal to zero at ''T''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. This ensures that \u0394''G'' and \u0394''H'' are nearly the same over a considerable range of temperatures and justifies the approximate [[empiricism|empirical]] Principle of Thomsen and Berthelot, which states that ''the equilibrium state to which a system proceeds is the one that evolves the greatest amount of heat'', i.e., an actual process is the ''most exothermic one''. (Callen, pp.&nbsp;186\u2013187)\n\nOne model that estimates the properties of an [[electron]] gas at absolute zero in metals is the [[Fermi gas]]. The electrons, being [[Fermion]]s, must be in different quantum states, which leads the electrons to get very high typical [[velocities]], even at absolute zero. The maximum energy that electrons can have at absolute zero is called the [[Fermi energy]]. The Fermi temperature is defined as this maximum energy divided by Boltzmann's constant, and is of the order of 80,000 K for typical electron densities found in metals. For temperatures significantly below the Fermi temperature, the electrons behave in almost the same way as at absolute zero. This explains the failure of the classical [[equipartition theorem]] for metals that eluded classical physicists in the late 19th century.\n\n==Relation with Bose\u2013Einstein condensate==\n{{Main|Bose\u2013Einstein condensate}}\n\n[[File:Bose Einstein condensate.png|left|thumb|Velocity-distribution data of a gas of [[rubidium]] atoms at a temperature within a few billionths of a degree above absolute zero.

Absolute temperature measurement is uniquely determined by a multiplicative constant which specifies the size of the ''degree'', so the ''ratios'' of two absolute temperatures, ''T''<sub>2</sub>/''T''<sub>1</sub>, are the same in all scales. The most transparent definition of this standard comes from the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]]. It can also be found in [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]] (for particles of half-integer [[spin (physics)|spin]]) and [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics]] (for particles of integer spin). All of these define the relative numbers of particles in a system as decreasing [[exponential function]]s of energy (at the particle level) over ''kT'', with ''k'' representing the [[Boltzmann constant]] and ''T'' representing the temperature observed at the [[macroscopic]] level.<ref name=\"sib2115\"/>\n\n==Negative temperatures==\n{{Main|Negative temperature}}\n\nTemperatures that are expressed as negative numbers on the familiar Celsius or Fahrenheit scales are simply colder than the zero points of those scales. Certain [[Thermodynamic system|systems]] can achieve truly negative temperatures; that is, their [[thermodynamic temperature]] (expressed in kelvins) can be of a [[Negative number|negative]] quantity. A system with a truly negative temperature is not colder than absolute zero. Rather, a system with a negative temperature is hotter than ''any'' system with a positive temperature, in the sense that if a negative-temperature system and a positive-temperature system come in contact, heat flows from the negative to the positive-temperature system.<ref name=\"Chase\">{{cite web|last=Chase|first=Scott|title=Below Absolute Zero -What Does Negative Temperature Mean?|url=http://www.phys.ncku.edu.tw/mirrors/physicsfaq/ParticleAndNuclear/neg_temperature.html|work=The Physics and Relativity FAQ|accessdate=2 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815144418/http://www.phys.ncku.edu.tw/mirrors/physicsfaq/ParticleAndNuclear/neg_temperature.html|archive-date=15 August 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMost familiar systems cannot achieve negative temperatures because adding energy always increases their [[entropy]]. However, some systems have a maximum amount of energy that they can hold, and as they approach that maximum energy their entropy actually begins to decrease. Because temperature is defined by the relationship between energy and entropy, such a system's temperature becomes negative, even though energy is being added.<ref name=\"Chase\"/> As a result, the Boltzmann factor for states of systems at negative temperature increases rather than decreases with increasing state energy. Therefore, no complete system, i.e. including the electromagnetic modes, can have negative temperatures, since there is no highest energy state,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} so that the sum of the probabilities of the states would diverge for negative temperatures. However, for quasi-equilibrium systems (e.g. spins out of equilibrium with the electromagnetic field) this argument does not apply, and negative effective temperatures are attainable.\n\nOn 3 January 2013, physicists announced that for the first time they had created a quantum gas made up of potassium atoms with a negative temperature in motional degrees of freedom.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature.2013.12146|title=Quantum gas goes below absolute zero|journal=Nature|year=2013|last1=Merali|first1=Zeeya}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Robert Boyle 0001.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Robert Boyle]] pioneered the idea of an absolute zero]]\nOne of the first to discuss the possibility of an absolute minimal temperature was [[Robert Boyle]].

His instrument indicated temperatures by the height at which a certain mass of air sustained a column of mercury\u2014the volume, or \"spring\" of the air varying with temperature. Amontons therefore argued that the zero of his thermometer would be that temperature at which the spring of the air was reduced to nothing. He used a scale that marked the boiling point of water at +73 and the melting point of ice at +{{frac|51|1|2}}, so that the zero was equivalent to about \u2212240 on the Celsius scale.<ref name=AS2016>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Cold}}</ref> Amontons held that the absolute zero cannot be reached, so never attempted to compute it explicitly.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Talbot |first1=G.R. |last2=Pacey |first2=A.C. |date=1972 |title=Antecedents of thermodynamics in the work of Guillaume Amontons |journal=Centaurus |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=20\u201340 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0498.1972.tb00163.x|bibcode=1972Cent...16...20T }}</ref>\nThe value of \u2212240&nbsp;\u00b0C, or \"431 divisions [in Fahrenheit's thermometer] below the cold of freezing water\"<ref>{{Google books|tSm2Ws6bg0oC|Essays Medical and Philosophical|page=PA291}}</ref> was published by [[George Martine (physician)|George Martine]] in 1740.\n\nThis close approximation to the modern value of \u2212273.15&nbsp;\u00b0C<ref name=\"sib2115\"/> for the zero of the air thermometer was further improved upon in 1779 by [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]], who observed that {{convert|-270|C|F K}} might be regarded as absolute cold.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lambert|first=Johann Heinrich|title=Pyrometrie|location=Berlin|year=1779|oclc=165756016}}</ref>\n\nValues of this order for the absolute zero were not, however, universally accepted about this period. [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] and [[Antoine Lavoisier]], in their 1780 treatise on heat, arrived at values ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 below the freezing point of water, and thought that in any case it must be at least 600 below.

It was the only stock to have luggage racks, umbrella hooks and separate power and braking controls, and the last stock not to have any automated announcements.\n\n== Development and introduction ==\n[[File:Watford station (Metropolitan Line) - geograph.org.uk - 1506771.jpg|thumb|left|A Stock (right) replaced [[London Underground F Stock|F]] and [[London Underground O and P Stock|P]] (left) Stocks on the Metropolitan line]]\nThe design was formulated by W S Graff-Baker of the [[London Passenger Transport Board]], as part of the electrification of the [[Metropolitan line]] from {{LUL stations|station=Rickmansworth}} to [[Amersham station|Amersham]] and {{LUL stations|station=Chesham}} under the 1935\u20131940 [[New Works Programme]],<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2007/oct/22/classicsofeverydaydesignno33|title= Classics of everyday design No 33|newspaper= The Guardian | location=London | first=Jonathan | last=Glancey | date=2007-10-22 | accessdate=2010-05-11}}</ref> and owes much to the smaller [[1938 Stock]]. The project was delayed by [[World War II]] and lack of funds during the austerity period after the war. In 1946 two experimental trailers similar in exterior appearance to the production trains were built using underframes from [[London Underground T Stock|T Stock]], but they were scrapped when the trials concluded.<ref name=\"hardy_36\">{{Harvnb|Hardy|2002|p= 36}}</ref> Graff-Baker died in 1952, before the trains were finally built.\n\nWhen electrification commenced in 1959, London Transport placed an order for 31 ''A60 Stock'' trains to replace both T Stock on services to {{LUL stations|station=Watford}} and Rickmansworth, and locomotive-hauled services to destinations north of Rickmansworth. The first units, 5004 and 5008, entered service to Watford in June 1961.<ref name=\"Hardy1998\" /><ref name=\"Hardy2002\" /><ref name=\"London Underground\" /> The Amersham/Chesham services began later that year. London Transport later ordered 27 ''A62 Stock'' trains; these were introduced between 1961 and 1963 to replace [[London Underground F Stock|F]] and [[London Underground O and P Stock|P]] Stocks on the {{LUL stations|station=Uxbridge}} service. By December 1963 the roll-out was complete.<ref name=\"hardy_36\" />\n\nThe trains were designated as ''A'' Stock to mark the electrification of the Metropolitan line to ''A''mersham. Four-car units were used on the [[East London line]] (then a branch of the Metropolitan line) from June 1977 to April 1985, May 1987 to 24 March 1995 and 25 March 1998 to 22 December 2007, when the line closed to become part of the [[London Overground]] network.<ref name=\"hardy_36\" />\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:Rayner's Lane Station. - geograph.org.uk - 39714.jpg|thumb|left|A Stock at [[Rayners Lane tube station|Rayners Lane station]] in their original unpainted livery]]\nThe stock was a compromise between the needs of longer-distance \"outer suburban\" passengers on the outer reaches of the line and short-distance \"urban\" passengers over the heavily used [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle]] and [[Hammersmith & City line|Hammersmith & City]] lines. For this reason the [[Trailer (vehicle)|trailer cars]] have three sets of doors per car.\n\nA distinctive feature was the use of transverse seating only, uncommon on the Underground. This is because it was designed for journeys which might last over an hour. Most of the seating was of the high-capacity transverse 3 + 2 arrangement.<ref name= SQUAREWHEELS.org.uk-A60>{{cite web|url= http://www.squarewheels.org.uk/rly/stock/AsubsurfaceStock/|title= A60/62 stock|publisher= SQUAREWHEELS.org.uk|accessdate=20 December 2010}}</ref> Four tip-up seats were provided at the rear of the driving motor.<ref name=\"hardy_37\">{{Harvnb|Hardy|2002|p= 37}}</ref> Despite each 8-car train seating 448 passengers,<ref name=\"A stock-Tfl\" /> the stock provided fewer seats than the locomotive-hauled and T stock trains that they replaced, but more seats than the [[London Underground S Stock|S Stock]] which started to replace them on 31 July 2010. The stock had luggage racks and umbrella hooks, the only Underground stock to have these features, despite their presence on most contemporary [[British Rail]] stock. The A stock were the last subsurface trains built with headlights positioned on the left side of the cab giving them an asymmetrical appearance. They also had three tail lights positioned underneath the cab although one was removed during refurbishment\n\nA60 and A62 stocks were nearly identical in appearance. The most significant differences were the border around the destination window on A62 motor cars and the make of [[Gas compressor|compressor]] under the trailer cars: A60 stock used the [[Westinghouse Rail Systems|Westinghouse]] DHC 5A, A62 cars the Reavell TBC 38Z.<ref name=\"Rail_702\">{{cite journal|last=Mugridge|first=Peter|date=8 August 2012|title=Tube's A-listers bow out|journal=[[Rail (magazine)|Rail]]|publisher=[[Bauer Media]]|issue=702|pages=54\u201359|issn=0953-4563}}</ref>\n\nAt {{convert|116|in|mm|abbr=on}} they were the Underground's widest trains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trainweb.org/tubeprune/Dimensions.htm|title= London Underground Rolling Stock Dimensions|accessdate=2008-04-03 |publisher= London Underground}}</ref>\nThe stock was refurbished between 1993 and 1998 by [[Adtranz]] (now [[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]]) in Derby.

Each unit was further divided into two semi-permanently-coupled sets, a driving motor and trailer. Although the intention was to operate four-car trains in the off-peak, this practice was short-lived except for the [[Chalfont & Latimer station|Chalfont & Latimer]]\u2013Chesham shuttle, which was always operated by a single four-car unit. For its main services the stock operated in a two-unit formation of eight cars between {{LUL stations|station=Aldgate}} and Amersham, Chesham (peak hours only), Uxbridge and Watford.\n\nWhen built it had a top speed of {{convert|70|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} ([[Land speed record for railed vehicles|world's fastest fourth-rail train]]), but from the late 1990s/early 2000s it was restricted to {{convert|50|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} to improve reliability.\n\n=== Other areas of operation ===\nIn addition to the Metropolitan line, A Stock was permitted to traverse the following sections, subject to the following restrictions:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.davros.org/rail/culg/|title=Clive's UndergrounD Line Guides|publisher=Clive's UndergrounD Line Guides|accessdate=28 July 2010}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Section !!

It ran from Moorgate along the entire Metropolitan line, including Watford, Amersham, Aldgate, Uxbridge, Chesham and the Watford North curve. The tour ended at Wembley Park: on the final stretch from Finchley Road, the train was unofficially recorded at 74&nbsp;mph. One of the driving motor cars, 5034, was part of the first (as 5008) and also the last A Stock train, giving it a life of over 51 years. It was sent to Northwood sidings on 8 October 2012 and loaded onto lorries for disposal. The historical age and significance of No.5034 saw it taken to the Acton Museum Depot for preservation but vehicle 5062 was scrapped.\n\nThe stock survived in engineering use as a [[Rail adhesion car|Rail Adhesion Train]] until March 2018, when it too was scrapped, giving the stock a total life of 57 years. It had been last used in December 2017, when it had developed a fault and repairs were deemed unnecessary, as it was planned to be scrapped after the end of the year anyway, being replaced by a D78 stock unit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.districtdavesforum.co.uk/thread/28735|title=Is the RAT around? {{!}} District Dave's London Underground Site|website=www.districtdavesforum.co.uk|access-date=2018-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThe night of 24 May 2018 was the final time an A stock unit ran under its own power on the London Underground network. Set 5234/6234/6235/5235 worked train 710 from Neasden Depot to Ealing Common Depot. The set was subsequently removed from the adjacent London Transport Museum depot at Acton Town by road for disposal on 17 and 18 July 2018.\n\nThe stock outlasted many former [[British Rail]] EMUs: the Scottish [[British Rail Class 303|Class 303]] managed 43 years, the [[British Rail Class 309|Class 309]] Clacton Express units 38 years and [[British Rail Class 312]] only 28 years. The former Southern Region [[British Rail Class 421|4CIG]] and [[British Rail Class 411|4CEP]] managed 46 and 49 years respectively. The stock was one of Britain's longest-serving types of train, although falling short of the service length of the [[British Rail Class 483|ex-1938 Stock]] still in use on the [[Island Line, Isle of Wight|Isle of Wight]] 81 years after construction  and the [[British Rail Class 487|Class 487]] units which pushed through to just under 53 years, or the 81 years of [[Glasgow Subway]] rolling stock between 1896 and 1977.

It was the only stock to have luggage racks, umbrella hooks and separate power and braking controls, and the last stock not to have any automated announcements.\n\n== Development and introduction ==\n[[File:Watford station (Metropolitan Line) - geograph.org.uk - 1506771.jpg|thumb|left|A Stock (right) replaced [[London Underground F Stock|F]] and [[London Underground O and P Stock|P]] (left) Stocks on the Metropolitan line]]\nThe design was formulated by W S Graff-Baker of the [[London Passenger Transport Board]], as part of the electrification of the [[Metropolitan line]] from {{LUL stations|station=Rickmansworth}} to [[Amersham station|Amersham]] and {{LUL stations|station=Chesham}} under the 1935\u20131940 [[New Works Programme]],<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2007/oct/22/classicsofeverydaydesignno33|title= Classics of everyday design No 33|newspaper= The Guardian | location=London | first=Jonathan | last=Glancey | date=2007-10-22 | accessdate=2010-05-11}}</ref> and owes much to the smaller [[1938 Stock]]. The project was delayed by [[World War II]] and lack of funds during the austerity period after the war. In 1946 two experimental trailers similar in exterior appearance to the production trains were built using underframes from [[London Underground T Stock|T Stock]], but they were scrapped when the trials concluded.<ref name=\"hardy_36\">{{Harvnb|Hardy|2002|p= 36}}</ref> Graff-Baker died in 1952, before the trains were finally built.\n\nWhen electrification commenced in 1959, London Transport placed an order for 31 ''A60 Stock'' trains to replace both T Stock on services to {{LUL stations|station=Watford}} and Rickmansworth, and locomotive-hauled services to destinations north of Rickmansworth. The first units, 5004 and 5008, entered service to Watford in June 1961.<ref name=\"Hardy1998\" /><ref name=\"Hardy2002\" /><ref name=\"London Underground\" /> The Amersham/Chesham services began later that year. London Transport later ordered 27 ''A62 Stock'' trains; these were introduced between 1961 and 1963 to replace [[London Underground F Stock|F]] and [[London Underground O and P Stock|P]] Stocks on the {{LUL stations|station=Uxbridge}} service. By December 1963 the roll-out was complete.<ref name=\"hardy_36\" />\n\nThe trains were designated as ''A'' Stock to mark the electrification of the Metropolitan line to ''A''mersham. Four-car units were used on the [[East London line]] (then a branch of the Metropolitan line) from June 1977 to April 1985, May 1987 to 24 March 1995 and 25 March 1998 to 22 December 2007, when the line closed to become part of the [[London Overground]] network.<ref name=\"hardy_36\" />\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:Rayner's Lane Station. - geograph.org.uk - 39714.jpg|thumb|left|A Stock at [[Rayners Lane tube station|Rayners Lane station]] in their original unpainted livery]]\nThe stock was a compromise between the needs of longer-distance \"outer suburban\" passengers on the outer reaches of the line and short-distance \"urban\" passengers over the heavily used [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle]] and [[Hammersmith & City line|Hammersmith & City]] lines. For this reason the [[Trailer (vehicle)|trailer cars]] have three sets of doors per car.\n\nA distinctive feature was the use of transverse seating only, uncommon on the Underground. This is because it was designed for journeys which might last over an hour. Most of the seating was of the high-capacity transverse 3 + 2 arrangement.<ref name= SQUAREWHEELS.org.uk-A60>{{cite web|url= http://www.squarewheels.org.uk/rly/stock/AsubsurfaceStock/|title= A60/62 stock|publisher= SQUAREWHEELS.org.uk|accessdate=20 December 2010}}</ref> Four tip-up seats were provided at the rear of the driving motor.<ref name=\"hardy_37\">{{Harvnb|Hardy|2002|p= 37}}</ref> Despite each 8-car train seating 448 passengers,<ref name=\"A stock-Tfl\" /> the stock provided fewer seats than the locomotive-hauled and T stock trains that they replaced, but more seats than the [[London Underground S Stock|S Stock]] which started to replace them on 31 July 2010. The stock had luggage racks and umbrella hooks, the only Underground stock to have these features, despite their presence on most contemporary [[British Rail]] stock. The A stock were the last subsurface trains built with headlights positioned on the left side of the cab giving them an asymmetrical appearance.

Each unit was further divided into two semi-permanently-coupled sets, a driving motor and trailer. Although the intention was to operate four-car trains in the off-peak, this practice was short-lived except for the [[Chalfont & Latimer station|Chalfont & Latimer]]\u2013Chesham shuttle, which was always operated by a single four-car unit. For its main services the stock operated in a two-unit formation of eight cars between {{LUL stations|station=Aldgate}} and Amersham, Chesham (peak hours only), Uxbridge and Watford.\n\nWhen built it had a top speed of {{convert|70|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} ([[Land speed record for railed vehicles|world's fastest fourth-rail train]]), but from the late 1990s/early 2000s it was restricted to {{convert|50|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} to improve reliability.\n\n=== Other areas of operation ===\nIn addition to the Metropolitan line, A Stock was permitted to traverse the following sections, subject to the following restrictions:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.davros.org/rail/culg/|title=Clive's UndergrounD Line Guides|publisher=Clive's UndergrounD Line Guides|accessdate=28 July 2010}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Section !!

It ran from Moorgate along the entire Metropolitan line, including Watford, Amersham, Aldgate, Uxbridge, Chesham and the Watford North curve. The tour ended at Wembley Park: on the final stretch from Finchley Road, the train was unofficially recorded at 74&nbsp;mph. One of the driving motor cars, 5034, was part of the first (as 5008) and also the last A Stock train, giving it a life of over 51 years. It was sent to Northwood sidings on 8 October 2012 and loaded onto lorries for disposal. The historical age and significance of No.5034 saw it taken to the Acton Museum Depot for preservation but vehicle 5062 was scrapped.\n\nThe stock survived in engineering use as a [[Rail adhesion car|Rail Adhesion Train]] until March 2018, when it too was scrapped, giving the stock a total life of 57 years. It had been last used in December 2017, when it had developed a fault and repairs were deemed unnecessary, as it was planned to be scrapped after the end of the year anyway, being replaced by a D78 stock unit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.districtdavesforum.co.uk/thread/28735|title=Is the RAT around? {{!}} District Dave's London Underground Site|website=www.districtdavesforum.co.uk|access-date=2018-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThe night of 24 May 2018 was the final time an A stock unit ran under its own power on the London Underground network.

The set was subsequently removed from the adjacent London Transport Museum depot at Acton Town by road for disposal on 17 and 18 July 2018.\n\nThe stock outlasted many former [[British Rail]] EMUs: the Scottish [[British Rail Class 303|Class 303]] managed 43 years, the [[British Rail Class 309|Class 309]] Clacton Express units 38 years and [[British Rail Class 312]] only 28 years.
