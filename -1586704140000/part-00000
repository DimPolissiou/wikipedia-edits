The album's sound homed in on the [[Appalachia]]n \"high lonesome\" influences evident on Prine's eponymous debut LP and its [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] instrumentation reflects Prine's fascination with early American folk and country music. The album was produced by [[Arif Mardin]] and features Prine's brother Dave on dobro, banjo, and fiddle while [[Steve Goodman]] also contributes on guitar and harmonies. In the ''Great Days: The John Prine Anthology'' liner notes, Prine tells David Fricke that the album was recorded in three days at a cost of $7,200, \"including beer\", and adds \"I just wanted to do ''Diamonds'' the way I was used to playing music at my house with Dave and Steve.  But it's taken me years to figure out how to balance those first two records. About every other record, after making a real studio or rock 'n' roll album, I'd come back and do a ''Diamonds in the Rough''.\"\n\n==Composition==\nThe material on ''Diamonds in the Rough'' strike a musical balance between infectious up-tempo hootenannies and stark, allegorical compositions with recitations that recall [[Hank Williams]]' recordings as Luke the Drifter.{{According to whom|date=August 2016}} In an interview with Paul Zollo for ''Bluerailroad'' magazine, Prine stated that \"Sour Grapes\" and \"The Frying Pan\" were two of his earliest songwriting efforts, explaining that he \"had a girlfriend whose father was a janitor. And the reason I\u2019m telling you that is because he had access to a tape recorder, and nobody else I knew had one. They were really rare. A reel-to-reel. He got it from the language department. It was broken and he fixed it and had it at home. And I sat down and taped three songs for this girl and her sister. And the three songs were 'Frying Pan', 'Sour Grapes', and 'Twist & Shout'...Years later, I ended up marrying that girl. She was my first wife. She found the tape.  It was after I had made the first album, so I put two of those songs on ''Diamonds in the Rough''.  And those were the first songs I remember writing.\" Prine also added that he wrote \"Souvenirs\" in his car, \"a 65 Chevelle. Driving to the Fifth Peg.  Like the 5th or 6th time playing there. I used to play there just Thursdays after they hired me. They hired me from that open stage the very first time I sang for the crowd. They invited me back a week later, and I did it again for an open stage...So about the fifth time I was driving down there I thought, God, the same people are gonna be sitting there. I better have a new song. So I wrote 'Souvenirs' in the car on the way down. And then I thought I\u2019d come up with a melody. And I thought I had come up with a pretty sophisticated melody in my head, and I was surprised to find out it had the same three chords that all my other songs have.  Really surprised.  I thought I had written a [[jazz]] melody.\"  Prine often performed \"Souvenirs\" with his friend and fellow songwriter Steve Goodman, who played on the original recording, and in the same interview the singer confessed, \"Yeah, I can still hear him playing it. He played a back melody, so that you could barely hear the difference of who was playing. On tape or when we did it live. And I realized a large part of what he was doing was making it sound like I was playing the good part.  And that\u2019s basically the kind of guy he was.\"{{Cite quote|date=August 2016}}\n\nPrine admitted to ''Bluerailroad'' that he borrowed the melody for \"The Late John Garfield Blues\" from the [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] song \"Treasures Untold\", stating \"It's a really pretty ballad that he wrote.  I learned that song early on and I always wanted to use that G to the B7.\"  The title track, which was originally recorded by [[the Carter Family]], is sung by Prine, his brother Dave, and Goodman without accompaniment.  Regarding \"Yes, I Guess They Oughta Name A Drink After You\", the John Prine Shrine website quotes the singer: \"I was going for a Hank Williams kind of song. Steve Goodman always told me that if I'd taken another couple of minutes and put a chorus to the song - there isn't any, just a tag line to every verse - that it would have been a hit country song. And I was set in my ways. Once a song was done, it was done.\"  Two songs on the album, \"Take The Star Out of The Window\" and the allegorical protest waltz \"The Great Compromise\", deal with America's involvement with the Vietnam War, with Prine saying of the latter in the ''Great Days'' anthology, \"The idea I had in mind was that America was this girl you used to take to the drive-in movies. And then when you went to get some popcorn, she turned around and screwed some guy in a foreign sports car. I really love America. I just don't know how to get there anymore.\"  The album opener \u201cEverybody\u201d is a rollicking number about the need for human connection that starts with the narrator bumping into Jesus, who happens to be taking a stroll on the ocean, while \u201cThe Torch Singer\u201d and \u201cRocky Mountain Time\u201d may have reflected the whirlwind changes in Prine's life in the past year.{{sfn|Huffman, Eddie|p=61|2015}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 =[[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3.5|5}} <ref name=\"AM\">{{cite web |first=William |last=Ruhlman |title= ''Diamonds in the Rough'' > Review |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id= r15819 |pure_url=yes}} |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref>\n|rev2 = ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|Christgau's Record Guide]]''\n|rev2Score = A\u2013<ref name=\"CG\">{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=089919026X|chapter=Consumer Guide '70s: P|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_chap.php?k=P&bk=70|accessdate=March 10, 2019|via=robertchristgau.com}}</ref>\n}}\n''[[Village Voice]]'' critic [[Robert Christgau]] deemed ''Diamonds in the Rough'' \"Not as rich as the debut, but more artlessly and confidently sung\u2014the gruff monotone avoids melodrama in favor of Prine's own version of good-old-boy...\"<ref name=\"CG\"/>\n\nCritic William Ruhlman of [[AllMusic]] opines, \"John Prine's second album was a cut below his first, only because the debut was a classic and the follow-up was merely terrific...''Diamonds in the Rough'' demonstrated that Prine had an enduring talent that wasn't exhausted by one great album.\"  In 1993 David Fricke wrote, \"It was, in essence, John Prine-in-the-rough, a superb collection of tunes and tales recorded with acoustic, no-frills living room elegance.\" Prine biographer Eddie Huffman observes \"Prine had overcome his stiffness in the studio, but the trade-off was vocal control: He came off like a hell-raising redneck...His voice actually cracked here and there, but the surge of energy and good humor more than compensate for the lack of polish.\u201d{{sfn|Huffman, Eddie|p=69|2015}}\n\n==Track listing==\nAll tracks composed by John Prine; except where indicated\n# \"Everybody\" \u2013 2:43\n# \"The Torch Singer\" \u2013 2:52\n# \"Souvenirs\" \u2013 3:32\n# \"The Late [[John Garfield]] Blues\" \u2013 3:02\n# \"Sour Grapes\" \u2013 2:00\n# \"Billy the Bum\" \u2013 4:41\n# \"The Frying Pan\" \u2013 1:47\n# \"Yes I Guess They Oughta Name a Drink After You\" \u2013 2:08\n# \"Take the Star Out of the Window\" \u2013 2:06\n# \"[[The Great Compromise (song)|The Great Compromise]]\" \u2013 4:57\n# \"Clocks and Spoons\" \u2013 3:10\n# \"Rocky Mountain Time\" \u2013 3:03\n# \"Diamonds in the Rough\" ([[A.

Steve Goodman always told me that if I'd taken another couple of minutes and put a chorus to the song - there isn't any, just a tag line to every verse - that it would have been a hit country song. And I was set in my ways. Once a song was done, it was done.\"  Two songs on the album, \"Take The Star Out of The Window\" and the allegorical protest waltz \"The Great Compromise\", deal with America's involvement with the Vietnam War, with Prine saying of the latter in the ''Great Days'' anthology, \"The idea I had in mind was that America was this girl you used to take to the drive-in movies. And then when you went to get some popcorn, she turned around and screwed some guy in a foreign sports car. I really love America. I just don't know how to get there anymore.\"  The album opener \u201cEverybody\u201d is a rollicking number about the need for human connection that starts with the narrator bumping into Jesus, who happens to be taking a stroll on the ocean, while \u201cThe Torch Singer\u201d and \u201cRocky Mountain Time\u201d may have reflected the whirlwind changes in Prine\u2019s life in the past year.{{sfn|Huffman, Eddie|p=61|2015}}  \n\n==Reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 =[[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3.5|5}} <ref name=\"AM\">{{cite web |first=William |last=Ruhlman |title= ''Diamonds in the Rough'' > Review |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id= r15819 |pure_url=yes}} |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref>\n|rev2 = ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|Christgau's Record Guide]]''\n|rev2Score = A\u2013<ref name=\"CG\">{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=089919026X|chapter=Consumer Guide '70s: P|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_chap.php?k=P&bk=70|accessdate=March 10, 2019|via=robertchristgau.com}}</ref>\n}}\n''[[Village Voice]]'' critic [[Robert Christgau]] deemed ''Diamonds in the Rough'' \"Not as rich as the debut, but more artlessly and confidently sung\u2014the gruff monotone avoids melodrama in favor of Prine's own version of good-old-boy...\"<ref name=\"CG\"/>\n\nCritic William Ruhlman of [[AllMusic]] opines, \"John Prine's second album was a cut below his first, only because the debut was a classic and the follow-up was merely terrific...''Diamonds in the Rough'' demonstrated that Prine had an enduring talent that wasn't exhausted by one great album.\"  In 1993 David Fricke wrote, \"It was, in essence, John Prine-in-the-rough, a superb collection of tunes and tales recorded with acoustic, no-frills living room elegance.\" Prine biographer Eddie Huffman observes \"Prine had overcome his stiffness in the studio, but the trade-off was vocal control: He came off like a hell-raising redneck...His voice actually cracked here and there, but the surge of energy and good humor more than compensate for the lack of polish.\u201d{{sfn|Huffman, Eddie|p=69|2015}}\n\n==Track listing==\nAll tracks composed by John Prine; except where indicated\n# \"Everybody\" \u2013 2:43\n# \"The Torch Singer\" \u2013 2:52\n# \"Souvenirs\" \u2013 3:32\n# \"The Late [[John Garfield]] Blues\" \u2013 3:02\n# \"Sour Grapes\" \u2013 2:00\n# \"Billy the Bum\" \u2013 4:41\n# \"The Frying Pan\" \u2013 1:47\n# \"Yes I Guess They Oughta Name a Drink After You\" \u2013 2:08\n# \"Take the Star Out of the Window\" \u2013 2:06\n# \"[[The Great Compromise (song)|The Great Compromise]]\" \u2013 4:57\n# \"Clocks and Spoons\" \u2013 3:10\n# \"Rocky Mountain Time\" \u2013 3:03\n# \"Diamonds in the Rough\" ([[A.

Created by writer [[Fabian Nicieza]] and artist/writer [[Rob Liefeld]], the character first appeared in ''[[The New Mutants]]'' #98 ([[cover-date]]d February 1991). Initially Deadpool was depicted as a [[supervillain]] when he made his first appearance in ''The New Mutants'' and later in issues of ''X-Force'', but later evolved into his more recognizable [[antiheroic]] persona. Deadpool, whose real name is Wade Wilson, is a disfigured [[mercenary]] with the superhuman ability of an accelerated healing factor and physical prowess. The character is known as the \"Merc with a Mouth\" because of his tendency to talk and joke constantly, including breaking the [[fourth wall]] for humorous effect and running gags.\n\nThe character's popularity has seen him featured in numerous forms of other media. In the 2004 series ''[[Cable & Deadpool]]'', he refers to his own scarred appearance as \"[[Ryan Reynolds]] crossed with a [[Shar Pei|Shar-Pei]]\" (though in the comic, Reynolds' name is misspelled as \"Renolds\".)<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #2, p. 13.

After subsequently appearing in ''[[X-Force]]'' as a recurring character, Deadpool began making guest appearances in a number of different Marvel Comics titles such as ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'', and ''[[Heroes for Hire]]''. In 1993, the character received his own [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]], titled ''The Circle Chase'', written by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and pencilled by [[Joe Madureira]]. It was a relative success and Deadpool starred in a second, self-titled miniseries written in 1994 by [[Mark Waid]], pencilled by [[Ian Churchill]], and inked by [[Jason Temujin Minor]] and Bud LaRosa. Waid later commented, \"Frankly, if I'd known Deadpool was such a creep when I agreed to write the mini-series, I wouldn't have done it.

''Deadpool'' became an action comedy parody of the cosmic drama, antihero-heavy comics of the time. The series firmly established his supporting cast, including his prisoner/den mother [[Blind Al]] and his best friend [[Weasel (Marvel Comics)|Weasel]]. The ongoing series gained [[cult following|cult popularity]] for its unorthodox main character, its balance of angst and pop culture slapstick and the character became less of a villain, though the element of his moral ambiguity remained. The writer Joe Kelly noted, \"With Deadpool, we could do anything we wanted because everybody just expected the book to be cancelled every five seconds, so nobody was paying attention.

After stealing some potentially life-saving chemicals needed by an ailing [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], he is offered membership in the [[Avengers Unity Squad]].<ref>''Avengers'' #0</ref>\n\nIn the course of the following months, Deadpool's popularity skyrocketed after the mercenary Solo impersonated him to piggyback on Deadpool's reputation and take jobs at a higher pay rate. One of Solo's jobs in Washington, D.C. had Deadpool's public opinion drastically change for the better when he saved an ambassador from his telepathically-manipulated agents. After learning of Solo's impersonation, Deadpool came up with the idea to form a group of mercenaries called the Mercs for Money to extend his reach across the globe. However, Deadpool's newfound popularity forced him to leave his family behind, fearing his enemies could endanger them. Deadpool additionally joined the Avengers Unity Division and used his popularity as a means of funding the team, with the profit from merchandise.<ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 4, #1</ref>\n\nMadcap additionally returned to Deadpool's life, though Wade was unaware his experience inside his mind left Madcap emotionally damaged and vengeful. Madcap initially posed as an ally, joining the Mercs for Money, but eventually showed his true intentions after he was discovered impersonating Deadpool to defame and threaten his loved ones. Seeing as he had had enough fun, Madcap used an alien weapon to molecularly disintegrate himself. For his second coming, the villain had Deadpool unwittingly become the carrier of a deadly airborne virus with which he infected his family. Wade found a cure, though had to resort to Cable's evil clone Stryfe to find it. Around this time, tensions between Shiklah's domain and the surface word sparked an invasion of Manhattan from Monster Metropolis, which in turn led to Shiklah divorcing Deadpool, opting to return to Dracula instead.<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol 4 #23-29</ref>\n\nNot long after Wade joined the Avengers Unity Division, the real Steve Rogers was secretly supplanted by an evil fascist counterpart from another timeline that operated as a Hydra sleeper agent within the superhero community. When Phil Coulson became suspicious of Steve, Rogers convinced Deadpool to kill him, claiming that Coulson had gone rogue. A short time afterwards, Captain America's machinations resulted in Hydra rising to power, taking over the United States of America. When Hydra's conquest had barely begun, Preston found out about Coulson's death, and confronted Deadpool about it. The fight ended in Preston's death. As Hydra's empire grew stronger, Wade joined its own version of the Avengers out of blind loyalty for Captain America. Plagued by guilt, Wade held back when tasked with hunting down the rebel alliance known as the Underground, and eventually helped, behind the scenes, to lay part of the foundation of Hydra's eventual defeat. With his mistakes costing the lives of two of his friends, the love of his daughter, and any respect the world had for him, Deadpool turned his back on what little remained of the life he had built.<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol 4 #31-36</ref>\n\n==Characterization==\n===Personality===\nDeadpool is aware that he is a fictional comic book character.<ref name=\"DeadpoolV1Issue34\">{{Cite comic\n| writer = [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Priest, Christopher]]\n| penciller = Paco Diaz\n| inker = Ramos, Rod\n| coinkers = John Holdredge\n| colorist = Blanchard, Shannon\n| letterer = Deschesne, Albert\n| editor = Diaz, Ruben\n| story = Chapter X Verse One: Sending in the Clowns\n| title = Deadpool\n| volume = 1\n| issue = 34\n| date = Nov 1999\n| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]\n| location = [[New York, NY]]\n| page = \n| panel = \n| id = \n}}</ref> He commonly breaks the [[fourth wall]], which is done by few other characters in the [[Marvel Universe]], and this is used to humorous effect.

Created by writer [[Fabian Nicieza]] and artist/writer [[Rob Liefeld]], the character first appeared in ''[[The New Mutants]]'' #98 ([[cover-date]]d February 1991). Initially Deadpool was depicted as a [[supervillain]] when he made his first appearance in ''The New Mutants'' and later in issues of ''X-Force'', but later evolved into his more recognizable [[antiheroic]] persona. Deadpool, whose real name is Wade Wilson, is a disfigured [[mercenary]] with the superhuman ability of an accelerated healing factor and physical prowess. The character is known as the \"Merc with a Mouth\" because of his tendency to talk and joke constantly, including breaking the [[fourth wall]] for humorous effect and running gags.\n\nThe character's popularity has seen him featured in numerous forms of other media. In the 2004 series ''[[Cable & Deadpool]]'', he refers to his own scarred appearance as \"[[Ryan Reynolds]] crossed with a [[Shar Pei|Shar-Pei]]\" (though in the comic, Reynolds' name is misspelled as \"Renolds\".)<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #2, p. 13.

Nicieza gave Deadpool the real name of \"Wade Wilson\" as an inside-joke to being \"related\" to \"Slade Wilson\", Deathstroke.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Classic Marvel Figurine Collection\" #56.</ref>\n\nOther inspirations were [[Spider-Man]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].

If I could tie anything into Wolverine, I was winning.\" Like Wolverine, Deadpool is (or is thought to be) Canadian.<ref>''Marvel NOW Deadpool'' #3.</ref> The original story had him joining the [[Weapon X]] program after being kicked out of the U.S. Army Special Forces and given an artificial healing factor based on Wolverine's thanks to Dr. [[Emrys Killebrew]], one of the head scientists.<ref>''Cable and Deadpool'' #39.</ref>\n\n[[File:2.9.16RobLiefeldByLuigiNovi1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The character's co-creator, [[Rob Liefeld]], holding up a copy of ''New Mutants'' #98, in which the character first appeared, during an appearance at JHU Comics in Manhattan held three days before the release of the film ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]'']]\nIn his first appearance, Deadpool is hired by [[Genesis (Marvel Comics)|Tolliver]] to attack Cable and the [[New Mutants]]. After subsequently appearing in ''[[X-Force]]'' as a recurring character, Deadpool began making guest appearances in a number of different Marvel Comics titles such as ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'', and ''[[Heroes for Hire]]''. In 1993, the character received his own [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]], titled ''The Circle Chase'', written by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and pencilled by [[Joe Madureira]]. It was a relative success and Deadpool starred in a second, self-titled miniseries written in 1994 by [[Mark Waid]], pencilled by [[Ian Churchill]], and inked by [[Jason Temujin Minor]] and Bud LaRosa. Waid later commented, \"Frankly, if I'd known Deadpool was such a creep when I agreed to write the mini-series, I wouldn't have done it.

''Deadpool'' became an action comedy parody of the cosmic drama, antihero-heavy comics of the time. The series firmly established his supporting cast, including his prisoner/den mother [[Blind Al]] and his best friend [[Weasel (Marvel Comics)|Weasel]]. The ongoing series gained [[cult following|cult popularity]] for its unorthodox main character, its balance of angst and pop culture slapstick and the character became less of a villain, though the element of his moral ambiguity remained. The writer Joe Kelly noted, \"With Deadpool, we could do anything we wanted because everybody just expected the book to be cancelled every five seconds, so nobody was paying attention. And we could get away with it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/090716-JoeKellyDeadpool.html|title=2 Great Tastes That Taste Great Together: Joe Kelly/Deadpool|last= Rogers|first=Vaneta|date=July 16, 2009|publisher=Newsarama.com|accessdate=August 12, 2009}}</ref> Reportedly Kelly introduced the [[fourth wall]] breaking gimmick.<ref name=acrithit>{{cite web|url=http://www.acriticalhit.com/you-dont-know-merc-a-history-of-deadpool/|title=You don't know merc: a history of Deadpool|author=Kate Willaert|publisher=A Critical Hit|website=acriticalhit.com|date=July 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe series was taken over by [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Christopher Priest]] who noted that he found Kelly's issues to be \"complex and a little hostile to new readers like me\" and that by issue 37, he realized that \"it was okay to make Deadpool look stupid.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digital-priest.com/comics/deadpool.htm|title=adventures in the funnybook game \u2013 Deadpool|last=Priest|first=Christopher |date=September 2000|publisher=Christopher Priest official site|accessdate=August 15, 2009}}</ref> Kelly may have introduced Deadpool to breaking the fourth wall, but Priest \"could be credited for establishing it as an essential part of the character's personality and worldview.\" Priest left the series after only one year at issue #45.<ref name=acrithit/>\n\n===2000s===\nFor a time, writers who followed generally ignored the fourth wall entirely, until [[Gail Simone]] took over with issue #65.

After stealing some potentially life-saving chemicals needed by an ailing [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], he is offered membership in the [[Avengers Unity Squad]].<ref>''Avengers'' #0</ref>\n\nIn the course of the following months, Deadpool's popularity skyrocketed after the mercenary Solo impersonated him to piggyback on Deadpool's reputation and take jobs at a higher pay rate. One of Solo's jobs in Washington, D.C. had Deadpool's public opinion drastically change for the better when he saved an ambassador from his telepathically-manipulated agents. After learning of Solo's impersonation, Deadpool came up with the idea to form a group of mercenaries called the Mercs for Money to extend his reach across the globe. However, Deadpool's newfound popularity forced him to leave his family behind, fearing his enemies could endanger them. Deadpool additionally joined the Avengers Unity Division and used his popularity as a means of funding the team, with the profit from merchandise.<ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 4, #1</ref>\n\nMadcap additionally returned to Deadpool's life, though Wade was unaware his experience inside his mind left Madcap emotionally damaged and vengeful. Madcap initially posed as an ally, joining the Mercs for Money, but eventually showed his true intentions after he was discovered impersonating Deadpool to defame and threaten his loved ones. Seeing as he had had enough fun, Madcap used an alien weapon to molecularly disintegrate himself. For his second coming, the villain had Deadpool unwittingly become the carrier of a deadly airborne virus with which he infected his family. Wade found a cure, though had to resort to Cable's evil clone Stryfe to find it. Around this time, tensions between Shiklah's domain and the surface word sparked an invasion of Manhattan from Monster Metropolis, which in turn led to Shiklah divorcing Deadpool, opting to return to Dracula instead.<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol 4 #23-29</ref>\n\nNot long after Wade joined the Avengers Unity Division, the real Steve Rogers was secretly supplanted by an evil fascist counterpart from another timeline that operated as a Hydra sleeper agent within the superhero community. When Phil Coulson became suspicious of Steve, Rogers convinced Deadpool to kill him, claiming that Coulson had gone rogue. A short time afterwards, Captain America's machinations resulted in Hydra rising to power, taking over the United States of America. When Hydra's conquest had barely begun, Preston found out about Coulson's death, and confronted Deadpool about it. The fight ended in Preston's death. As Hydra's empire grew stronger, Wade joined its own version of the Avengers out of blind loyalty for Captain America. Plagued by guilt, Wade held back when tasked with hunting down the rebel alliance known as the Underground, and eventually helped, behind the scenes, to lay part of the foundation of Hydra's eventual defeat. With his mistakes costing the lives of two of his friends, the love of his daughter, and any respect the world had for him, Deadpool turned his back on what little remained of the life he had built.<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol 4 #31-36</ref>\n\n==Characterization==\n===Personality===\nDeadpool is aware that he is a fictional comic book character.<ref name=\"DeadpoolV1Issue34\">{{Cite comic\n| writer = [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Priest, Christopher]]\n| penciller = Paco Diaz\n| inker = Ramos, Rod\n| coinkers = John Holdredge\n| colorist = Blanchard, Shannon\n| letterer = Deschesne, Albert\n| editor = Diaz, Ruben\n| story = Chapter X Verse One: Sending in the Clowns\n| title = Deadpool\n| volume = 1\n| issue = 34\n| date = Nov 1999\n| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]\n| location = [[New York, NY]]\n| page = \n| panel = \n| id = \n}}</ref> He commonly breaks the [[fourth wall]], which is done by few other characters in the [[Marvel Universe]], and this is used to humorous effect.

The album features contributions from [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Glenn Frey]], [[Jackson Browne]] and [[Steve Goodman]].  Bassist [[Donald \"Duck\" Dunn]], who played in [[Booker T and the MGs]] with Cropper, plays on \"Forbidden Jimmy\" and \"Saddle In The Rain\".  The album marked the first time Prine recorded an album on Atlantic without producer [[Arif Mardin]], and critics took note the change in the Prine sound.  In the ''Great Days: The John Prine Anthology'' liner notes, Prine insists ''Sweet Revenge'' \"was a really good record, but I didn't want to keep making the same album over and over, do another 'Dear Abby.' I was really reaching on ''Common Sense'', trying to do some different things musically.\"  According to Eddie Huffman's book ''John Prine: In Spite of Himself'', the singer was \u201cperfectly content with the record he cut in Memphis.  But Cropper was moving into the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll big leagues as a producer, working on [[Rod Stewart]]\u2019s next record around the same time.  He decided Prine\u2019s album needed fleshing out.  Despite the singer\u2019s reservations, Cropper took the tapes to [[Los Angeles]] and added the kinds of overdubs Prine said he wanted to avoid...\u201d {{sfn|Huffman, Eddie|p=95|2015}}\n\n==Compositions==\nFor the sleeve to his 1988 release ''John Prine Live'', Prine wrote that he began writing \"Come Back To Us Barbara Lewis Hare Krishna Beauregard\" \"in the summer of '73 during a tour of [[Colorado]] ski towns with [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]].  What I had in mind was this girl who left home, did drugs, did [[religion]], did husbands, and ended up doing diddley.\"  In the ''Great Days'' anthology, Prine explains the idea behind the title track:  \"It's a song about the American dream only existing in the hearts and minds of immigrants until they live here long enough for democracy to make them cold, cynical, and indifferent, like all us native Americans.  It don't make much sense.\"  In the same essay, Prine reveals that \"Saddle In The Rain\" is \"another song about friendships and relationships, and being let down. Ever since I can remember, when I was a small kid, anytime I had a friend who really let me down, it would affect me. The disappointment was always large with me. So I guess that's why that's a theme I go back to every once in a while.\"  \"Saddle In The Rain\" is one of only two songs from ''Common Sense'' to appear on the 1976 Atlantic greatest hits compilation ''Prime Prine'' (the other being \"Barbara Lewis\").\n\nLike \u201cMexican Home\u201d on his previous album, \u201cHe Was in Heaven Before He Died\u201d was partially inspired by Prine's father, who died in 1971, and Prine later reflected on the song's opening line about \u201ca rainbow of babies draped over the graveyard\u201d: \u201cWhere do you go from there?  I consider it a challenge, thought, to paint myself into a corner and then get out.\u201d{{sfn|Huffman, Eddie|p=94-95|2015}}  The musical arrangements were more complex than they had been in the past, with Prine biographer Eddie Huffman noting that \"Common Sense\" used the common I-IV-V chord progression, though Prine \"mixed it up with extra chords, as usual, stretching the music to fit the lyrics,\" while \"Saddle in the Rain\" \"kept his sidemen on their toes, seeming to modulate between D and E minor,\" and \"That Close to You\" shifted from A to D in the bridge like a middle-period [[Beatles]] song.{{sfn|Huffman, Eddie|p=94|2015}}\n\nAs with his previous two LPs, Prine ends the album with a cover song, this time [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"You Never Can Tell\".   Although primarily known as a folk singer-songwriter, Prine was just as captivated by [[rock and roll]] in his youth as he was by American folk and [[country music]], telling Paul Zollo of ''Bluerailroad'', \"I was coming of age just as rock and roll was invented\" and cites Berry as his favorite because \"he told a story in less than three minutes.  And he had a syllable for every beat...Some people stretch the words like a mask to fit the melody. Whereas guys who are really good lyricists, have a meter so that the melody is almost already there.\"\n\n==Reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 =[[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|2.5|5}} <ref name=\"AM\">{{cite web |first=Jim |last=Smith |title= ''Common Sense'' > Review |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id= r15821 |pure_url=yes}} |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref>\n|rev2 = ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|Christgau's Record Guide]]''\n|rev2Score = A\u2013<ref name=\"CG\">{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=089919026X|chapter=Consumer Guide '70s: P|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_chap.php?k=P&bk=70|accessdate=March 10, 2019|via=robertchristgau.com}}</ref>\n}}\n''Common Sense'' received mixed reviews. Writing for [[Allmusic]], critic Jim Smith says of the album: \"Unfortunately, the cloying production overpowers the lyrics and relegates them to an almost cursory notion, and it doesn't help that Prine hasn't come up with much new material of note. His wit is still sharp, but it no longer shines; consequently, ''Common Sense'' has the unfortunate distinction of being the worst of Prine's Atlantic albums.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> ''[[Village Voice]]'' critic [[Robert Christgau]] was more enthusiastic: \"Prine customarily strives for coherence, but this time he has purposely (and painfully) abjured it. He seems to regret this at one point--during a more or less cogent lament for a dead friend \u2014 but the decision was obviously unavoidable.

The album features contributions from [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Glenn Frey]], [[Jackson Browne]] and [[Steve Goodman]].  Bassist [[Donald \"Duck\" Dunn]], who played in [[Booker T and the MGs]] with Cropper, plays on \"Forbidden Jimmy\" and \"Saddle In The Rain\".  The album marked the first time Prine recorded an album on Atlantic without producer [[Arif Mardin]], and critics took note the change in the Prine sound.  In the ''Great Days: The John Prine Anthology'' liner notes, Prine insists ''Sweet Revenge'' \"was a really good record, but I didn't want to keep making the same album over and over, do another 'Dear Abby.' I was really reaching on ''Common Sense'', trying to do some different things musically.\"  According to Eddie Huffman\u2019s book ''John Prine: In Spite of Himself'', the singer was \u201cperfectly content with the record he cut in Memphis.  But Cropper was moving into the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll big leagues as a producer, working on [[Rod Stewart]]\u2019s next record around the same time.  He decided Prine\u2019s album needed fleshing out.  Despite the singer\u2019s reservations, Cropper took the tapes to [[Los Angeles]] and added the kinds of overdubs Prine said he wanted to avoid...\u201d {{sfn|Huffman, Eddie|p=95|2015}}\n\n==Compositions==\nFor the sleeve to his 1988 release ''John Prine Live'', Prine wrote that he began writing \"Come Back To Us Barbara Lewis Hare Krishna Beauregard\" \"in the summer of '73 during a tour of [[Colorado]] ski towns with [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]].  What I had in mind was this girl who left home, did drugs, did [[religion]], did husbands, and ended up doing diddley.\"  In the ''Great Days'' anthology, Prine explains the idea behind the title track:  \"It's a song about the American dream only existing in the hearts and minds of immigrants until they live here long enough for democracy to make them cold, cynical, and indifferent, like all us native Americans.  It don't make much sense.\"  In the same essay, Prine reveals that \"Saddle In The Rain\" is \"another song about friendships and relationships, and being let down. Ever since I can remember, when I was a small kid, anytime I had a friend who really let me down, it would affect me. The disappointment was always large with me. So I guess that's why that's a theme I go back to every once in a while.\"  \"Saddle In The Rain\" is one of only two songs from ''Common Sense'' to appear on the 1976 Atlantic greatest hits compilation ''Prime Prine'' (the other being \"Barbara Lewis\").\n\nLike \u201cMexican Home\u201d on his previous album, \u201cHe Was in Heaven Before He Died\u201d was partially inspired by Prine\u2019s father, who died in 1971, and Prine later reflected on the song\u2019s opening line about \u201ca rainbow of babies draped over the graveyard\u201d: \u201cWhere do you go from there?  I consider it a challenge, thought, to paint myself into a corner and then get out.\u201d{{sfn|Huffman, Eddie|p=94-95|2015}}  The musical arrangements were more complex than they had been in the past, with Prine biographer Eddie Huffman noting that \"Common Sense\" used the common I-IV-V chord progression, though Prine \"mixed it up with extra chords, as usual, stretching the music to fit the lyrics,\" while \"Saddle in the Rain\" \"kept his sidemen on their toes, seeming to modulate between D and E minor,\" and \"That Close to You\" shifted from A to D in the bridge like a middle-period [[Beatles]] song.{{sfn|Huffman, Eddie|p=94|2015}}\n\nAs with his previous two LPs, Prine ends the album with a cover song, this time [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"You Never Can Tell\".   Although primarily known as a folk singer-songwriter, Prine was just as captivated by [[rock and roll]] in his youth as he was by American folk and [[country music]], telling Paul Zollo of ''Bluerailroad'', \"I was coming of age just as rock and roll was invented\" and cites Berry as his favorite because \"he told a story in less than three minutes.  And he had a syllable for every beat...Some people stretch the words like a mask to fit the melody. Whereas guys who are really good lyricists, have a meter so that the melody is almost already there.\"\n\n==Reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 =[[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|2.5|5}} <ref name=\"AM\">{{cite web |first=Jim |last=Smith |title= ''Common Sense'' > Review |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id= r15821 |pure_url=yes}} |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref>\n|rev2 = ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|Christgau's Record Guide]]''\n|rev2Score = A\u2013<ref name=\"CG\">{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=089919026X|chapter=Consumer Guide '70s: P|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_chap.php?k=P&bk=70|accessdate=March 10, 2019|via=robertchristgau.com}}</ref>\n}}\n''Common Sense'' received mixed reviews. Writing for [[Allmusic]], critic Jim Smith says of the album: \"Unfortunately, the cloying production overpowers the lyrics and relegates them to an almost cursory notion, and it doesn't help that Prine hasn't come up with much new material of note. His wit is still sharp, but it no longer shines; consequently, ''Common Sense'' has the unfortunate distinction of being the worst of Prine's Atlantic albums.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> ''[[Village Voice]]'' critic [[Robert Christgau]] was more enthusiastic: \"Prine customarily strives for coherence, but this time he has purposely (and painfully) abjured it. He seems to regret this at one point--during a more or less cogent lament for a dead friend \u2014 but the decision was obviously unavoidable. It results in the most genuinely miserable album I've heard in years.\"<ref name=\"CG\"/>\n\nThe chilly critical response shook Prine and marked the end of his relationship with Atlantic records, with the singer admitting to David Fricke in 1993: \"After ''Common Sense'' it seemed like all there was to write about was what was going on on the road.

He is a founding member of the rap group [[The Click]], and the founder of [[Sick Wid It Records]]. He has released twenty-eight studio albums to date, appeared on numerous movie soundtracks, and has also done guest appearances on a host of other rap albums. Initially an [[Underground music|underground]] artist, his 1995 solo album ''[[In a Major Way]]'' opened him up to a wider audience. Beginning in 1998, he began collaborating with more [[Mainstream#In music|mainstream]] rappers outside the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]]. He rose to even higher mainstream popularity in 2006 with his single \"[[Tell Me When to Go]]\" which was produced by [[Lil Jon]].\n\n==Music career==\n===1986\u201399===\nE-40 made his rap debut in 1986, with the [[Extended play|EP]] ''Let's Side'' as a member of [[The Click]]. The EP was co-produced by Mike Mosley and Al Eaton and was released on [[Sick Wid It Records]], an independent label founded by E-40. In 1992 they released second album, ''[[Down and Dirty (album)|Down and Dirty]]'', and in 1993 E-40 made his solo album debut. ''Federal'', a nine-track LP/14-track CD produced by Studio Ton and released by Sick Wid' It Records in association with SMG (Solar Music Group), a regional distributor. After a talent show at [[Grambling State University]], the emcee and his cousin [[B-Legit]] decided to attempt a career in rap. Together, and with his sister [[Suga-T]], they released their 1993 mainstream radio hit ''Captain Save a Hoe''. They moved back to [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]] and teamed up with D-Shot, E-40's brother, to form the group MVP or Most Valuable Players. E-40's gospel singing uncle (Saint Charles) helped them put out the record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/blog/articles/2005/10/10/left-side|title=Left Side|website=Thefader.com|accessdate=12 January 2015}}</ref> Suga-T was then added to the group to form [[The Click]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westcoast2k.net/interviews/blegit.htm|title=:: -- \u00a6\u00a6 w e s t c o a s t 2 k \u00a6\u00a6 -- ::|website=Westcoast2k.net|accessdate=12 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118112226/http://www.westcoast2k.net/interviews/blegit.htm|archive-date=18 November 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Synonymous with Bay Area rap, E-40 garnered a regional following, and eventually a national one, with his flamboyant raps, while his entrepreneurial spirit, embodied by his homegrown record label, Sick Wid' It Records, did much to cultivate a flourishing rap scene to the east of San Francisco Bay, in communities such as Oakland and his native Vallejo. Along with [[Too Short]], [[Spice 1]], and [[Ant Banks]], E-40 was among the first West Coast rappers to sign a major-label deal, penning a deal with Jive Records in 1994, after years of releasing music independently. Thus, six additional solo albums were to follow, beginning with ''[[In a Major Way]]'' in 1995 as well as remastered versions of E-40's independent Sick Wid It recordings from previous years. ''In a Major Way'' was regionally well-received, with guest spots by such rappers as [[Tupac Shakur]] and [[Mac Mall]], as well as his son [[Droop-E]].\nAlthough having a large following within [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], E-40 did not have a large mainstream audience, so only two of his songs released under Jive Records, \"1-Luv\" featuring Levitti and \"Things'll Never Change\" featuring [[Bo-Roc]], charted on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name=\"allmusic\">[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p38525|pure_url=yes}} E-40 Billboard Singles] on [[AllMusic]]</ref> He had been working nearly exclusively with rappers from the Bay Area until 1997, when he released the double disc compilation ''[[Southwest Riders]]'' featuring exclusively rap acts from the Bay Area and the south.

He is a founding member of the rap group [[The Click]], and the founder of [[Sick Wid It Records]]. He has released twenty-eight studio albums to date, appeared on numerous movie soundtracks, and has also done guest appearances on a host of other rap albums. Initially an [[Underground music|underground]] artist, his 1995 solo album ''[[In a Major Way]]'' opened him up to a wider audience. Beginning in 1998, he began collaborating with more [[Mainstream#In music|mainstream]] rappers outside the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]]. He rose to even higher mainstream popularity in 2006 with his single \"[[Tell Me When to Go]]\" which was produced by [[Lil Jon]].\n\n==Music career==\n===1986\u201399===\nE-40 made his rap debut in 1986, with the [[Extended play|EP]] ''Let's Side'' as a member of [[The Click]]. The EP was co-produced by Mike Mosley and Al Eaton and was released on [[Sick Wid It Records]], an independent label founded by E-40. In 1992 they released second album, ''[[Down and Dirty (album)|Down and Dirty]]'', and in 1993 E-40 made his solo album debut. ''Federal'', a nine-track LP/14-track CD produced by Studio Ton and released by Sick Wid' It Records in association with SMG (Solar Music Group), a regional distributor.

Together, and with his sister [[Suga-T]], they released their 1993 mainstream radio hit ''Captain Save a Hoe''. They moved back to [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]] and teamed up with D-Shot, E-40's brother, to form the group MVP or Most Valuable Players. E-40's gospel singing uncle (Saint Charles) helped them put out the record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/blog/articles/2005/10/10/left-side|title=Left Side|website=Thefader.com|accessdate=12 January 2015}}</ref> Suga-T was then added to the group to form [[The Click]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westcoast2k.net/interviews/blegit.htm|title=:: -- \u00a6\u00a6 w e s t c o a s t 2 k \u00a6\u00a6 -- ::|website=Westcoast2k.net|accessdate=12 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118112226/http://www.westcoast2k.net/interviews/blegit.htm|archive-date=18 November 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Synonymous with Bay Area rap, E-40 garnered a regional following, and eventually a national one, with his flamboyant raps, while his entrepreneurial spirit, embodied by his homegrown record label, Sick Wid' It Records, did much to cultivate a flourishing rap scene to the east of San Francisco Bay, in communities such as Oakland and his native Vallejo. Along with [[Too Short]], [[Spice 1]], and [[Ant Banks]], E-40 was among the first West Coast rappers to sign a major-label deal, penning a deal with Jive Records in 1994, after years of releasing music independently. Thus, six additional solo albums were to follow, beginning with ''[[In a Major Way]]'' in 1995 as well as remastered versions of E-40's independent Sick Wid It recordings from previous years. ''In a Major Way'' was regionally well-received, with guest spots by such rappers as [[Tupac Shakur]] and [[Mac Mall]], as well as his son [[Droop-E]].\nAlthough having a large following within [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], E-40 did not have a large mainstream audience, so only two of his songs released under Jive Records, \"1-Luv\" featuring Levitti and \"Things'll Never Change\" featuring [[Bo-Roc]], charted on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name=\"allmusic\">[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p38525|pure_url=yes}} E-40 Billboard Singles] on [[AllMusic]]</ref> He had been working nearly exclusively with rappers from the Bay Area until 1997, when he released the double disc compilation ''[[Southwest Riders]]'' featuring exclusively rap acts from the Bay Area and the south.

[[Mena Massoud]] played a live-action version of the character in a [[Aladdin (2019 film)|live action adaptation]] of the 1992 film.\n\nWhen Aladdin is initially introduced, he is eighteen years old. He never received a formal education, and has only learned by living on the streets of Agrabah. He has to steal food in the local market in order to survive.<ref name=finch>Finch, Christopher: \"Chapter 11: A Second Flowering\", pages 309-320.

The lineaments of his body are more free-flowing and more rounded than is usual for Disney heroes.<ref name=archive /> He looks like a modern 18-year-old,<ref name=finch /> except for his wardrobe. In the movie, they often describe him as a [[Street people|street rat]].\n\nAladdin is portrayed as quick-witted, and ultimately a caring person. Like most Disney male protagonists, he is a [[hero]]ic young man who seeks to win the affection of many other characters, which demonstrates his insecurity. He is not above lying and stealing, though never with malicious intentions, but in order to survive. The biggest difference from the norm is that, unlike most youthful Disney heroes, he is a doer rather than a passive character.<ref name=archive>{{cite web | work=Disney Archives | title=Aladdin Character History|url=http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/characters/aladdin/aladdin.html}}</ref>\n\n== Appearances ==\n=== ''Aladdin'' ===\n{{Main|Aladdin (1992 Disney film)}}\nIn the first film, street rat Aladdin meets a girl in the marketplace. He falls deeply in love with her at first sight, but he gets into trouble when their meeting is interrupted by guards who arrest him. She reveals that she is actually [[Princess Jasmine]]. Despite Jasmine's efforts to demand the guards to release Aladdin immediately, they tell her that she must first deal with [[Jafar (Disney)|Jafar]] in order to free him.\n\nIn prison, Aladdin meets an old man (who is actually Jafar in disguise) who mentions a cave filled with treasure and that he needs Aladdin to enter it. The old man reveals a secret exit, and Aladdin escapes with him and follows him into the desert. He enters the Cave of Wonders, where he meets a sentient [[Magic Carpet (Aladdin)|magic carpet]] and is commanded to only get a magic lamp. He gets it, but Abu's grabbing of a giant gem causes the cave to collapse. Aladdin, [[List of Disney's Aladdin characters#Abu|Abu]], and the carpet are left in the cave. Abu delivers the lamp to Aladdin, and when he rubs it, a giant blue [[Genie (Aladdin)|Genie]] appears, telling Aladdin he will fulfill three wishes. After leaving the collapsed cave with the Genie's help, he decides to become a prince in order to win Jasmine's heart.\n\n=== ''The Return of Jafar'' ===\n{{Main|The Return of Jafar}}\nIn the first [[direct-to-video]] [[sequel]], ''[[The Return of Jafar]]'' (1994), Jasmine begins to question her love for Aladdin, wondering if he is a duplicitous liar after he saves Iago, Jafar's former pet parrot who had [[torture]]d her father. Meanwhile, Jafar is freed from his lamp by a socially awkward bandit named Abis Mal, and immediately plots his retribution against Aladdin.\n\n=== ''Aladdin'' (TV series) ===\n{{Main|Aladdin (TV series)}}\nAn animated series was created for [[Disney Channel (Asia)|Disney Channel]] and [[Toon Disney]] which aired from 1994 to 1996, based on the original 1992 feature. The series picked up where ''The Return of Jafar'' left off, with Aladdin still living on the streets of Agrabah, engaged to Jasmine.\n\nIn the ''[[Aladdin (TV series)|Aladdin]]'' television episode ''The Lost Ones'' it is shown that he had a childhood friend named Amal. The episode ''Seems Like Old Crimes'' shows that when Aladdin was sixteen, he fell in with a group of circus performers where he met his pet monkey Abu. Abu is a brown little monkey.\n\n=== ''Aladdin and the King of Thieves'' ===\n{{Main|Aladdin and the King of Thieves}}\nIn the second [[direct-to-video]]/DVD movie and third film in the series, ''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]'', Aladdin discovers that his long-lost father, Cassim, is still alive, and sets out to find him. Cassim had left the family shortly after his son's birth. Aladdin's mother died when he was just a child. At the climax of the film, Jasmine and Aladdin are finally wed, and Aladdin reconciles with his father. ''The Return of Jafar'' and ''Aladdin and the King of Thieves'' together serve as bookends to the [[Aladdin (TV series)]] as its [[prologue]] and [[epilogue]], respectively.\n\n=== ''Aladdin'' (2019 film) ===\n{{Main|Aladdin (2019 film)}}\nIn the live action movie-adaptation of the first Aladdin movie of the same name, Aladdin is portrayed by [[Mena Massoud]]. The plot follows the story of human form [[Genie (Disney)|Genie]], as he tells a story to his two children about a street urchin named Aladdin, who falls in love with Princess Jasmine, befriends a wish-granting Genie, and battles the conspiring Jafar.\n\n== In other media ==\nAladdin was formerly a member of the Disney Adventurers franchise targeted at young boys sold by the [[Disney Store]] from 1999\u20132004, which sold various merchandise, mostly including toys.\n\n''[[Hercules and the Arabian Night]]'' is set after the end of ''King of Thieves'' as Jasmine refers to herself as married. He is featured as a guest in [[Disney's House of Mouse]], ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]'' and [[Mickey's House of Villains]]''.\n\nAladdin appears in various video games, including the [[List of Disney's Aladdin video games|game versions of the film]]. Aladdin has also appeared in the acclaimed ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series of games. In all his appearances in the series, he is a playable character or can be added to player's party. He wields a [[scimitar]] as his primary weapon and can utilize Abu to solve puzzles when he is an active party member. In the first game, [[Princess Jasmine]] is kidnapped by Jafar and [[Maleficent (Disney)|Maleficent]]. Aladdin teams up with [[Characters of Kingdom Hearts#Sora|Sora]] to save her. In ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', Aladdin is found experiencing deep [[Depression (mood)|depression]] due to his loneliness after Genie went to see the other worlds. When Genie comes back all is well again.\n\nAladdin appears in the [[Nintendo 3DS]] game \"[[Disney Magical World]].\" Agrabah is one of the four movie worlds accessible to the player, and several characters from the movie appear in the game. The player may also collect a number of Aladdin-themed items and clothing pieces.\n\nAladdin is a [[Player character|playable character]] in ''[[Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes]]'' through [[Downloadable content|DLC]].<ref>{{cite web | work=[[Kotaku]] | title=Aladdin And Princess Jasmine Are Coming To Disney Infinity|url=https://kotaku.com/aladdin-and-princess-jasmine-are-coming-to-disney-infin-1617505649}}</ref>\n\nAladdin also appears at the [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]] as a [[meetable character]]. He is a frequently-seen character, and often accompanied by Jasmine, and occasionally Genie. Though he goes barefoot in the film, he wears moccasins in his street rat clothes. Aladdin, Jasmine, Carpet, Abu and Genie make cameo appearances in the [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] version of [[It's a Small World]].\n\nIn the [[Aladdin (2011 musical)|Broadway musical]] adaptation, Aladdin is played by actor Adam Jacobs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/182186-Adam-Jacobs-and-Courtney-Reed-Will-Co-Star-in-Disneys-Aladdin-Complete-Cast-Announced?tsrc=nx |title=Adam Jacobs and Courtney Reed Will Co-Star in Disney's Aladdin; Complete Cast Announced |publisher=[[Playbill]] |work=playbill.com |date=16 September 2013 |accessdate=11 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213124450/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/182186-Adam-Jacobs-and-Courtney-Reed-Will-Co-Star-in-Disneys-Aladdin-Complete-Cast-Announced?tsrc=nx |archivedate=13 December 2013 }}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Portal|Disney}}\n* [http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/characters/aladdin/aladdin.html Aladdin] at [[Disney]] Archives\n\n{{Disney's Aladdin}}\n{{Disney Princess}}\n\n[[Category:Aladdin (franchise) characters]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Film characters introduced in 1992]]\n[[Category:Adventure film characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional Arabs]]\n[[Category:Fictional viziers]]\n[[Category:Fictional hoboes]]\n[[Category:Fictional outlaws]]\n[[Category:Disney Prince characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional sultans and sultanas]]\n[[Category:Animated human characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional thieves]]\n[[Category:Male characters in animation]]\n[[Category:Teenage characters in film]]\n[[Category:Child characters in musical theatre]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox character\n| color      = #410F8A\n| name       = Aladdin\n| series     = [[Aladdin (franchise)|Aladdin]]\n| image      = Aladdin Disney pose.png\n| caption    = Aladdin as depicted in the 1992 animated film\n| first      = ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' (1992)\n| last       =\n| creator    = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Ron Clements]]\n* [[John Musker]]\n}}\n| portrayer  = {{Plainlist|\n* Adam Jacobs ([[Aladdin (2011 musical)|2011 musical]])\n* [[Mena Massoud]] ([[Aladdin (2019 film)|2019 film]])\n}}\n| voice      = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Scott Weinger]] {{small|(speaking)}}\n* [[Brad Kane]] {{small|(singing)}}\n* Rick Logan (''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]'')\n}}\n| alias      = {{Plainlist|\n* Al {{small|(nickname given by Genie)}}\n* Prince Ali Ababwa {{small|(alter ego)}}\n}}\n| gender     = <!-- only state when not obvious -->\n| family     = {{Plainlist|\n* Cassim {{small|(father)}}\n}}\n| spouse     = [[Princess Jasmine|Jasmine]]\n| children   = Aziz {{small|(son; in ''[[Descendants (2015 film)|Descendants]]'')}}\n| relatives  = {{Plainlist|\n* [[List of Disney's Aladdin characters#The Sultan|The Sultan]] {{small|(father-in-law)}}\n}}\n| nationality = [[Agrabah]]\n}}\n'''Aladdin''' is a [[fictional character]] and the [[Title role#Title character|titular]] [[protagonist]] of [[Walt Disney Pictures]]' 31st animated feature film ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' (1992) based on [[Aladdin]], a folk tale of Middle Eastern origin.

The lineaments of his body are more free-flowing and more rounded than is usual for Disney heroes.<ref name=archive /> He looks like a modern 18-year-old,<ref name=finch /> except for his wardrobe. In the movie, they often describe him as a [[Street people|street rat]].\n\nAladdin is portrayed as quick-witted, and ultimately a caring person. Like most Disney male protagonists, he is a [[Hero|heroic]] young man who seeks to win the affection of many other characters, which demonstrates his insecurity. He is not above lying and stealing, though never with malicious intentions, but in order to survive. The biggest difference from the norm is that, unlike most youthful Disney heroes, he is a doer rather than a passive character.<ref name=archive>{{cite web | work=Disney Archives | title=Aladdin Character History|url=http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/characters/aladdin/aladdin.html}}</ref>\n\n== Appearances ==\n=== ''Aladdin'' ===\n{{Main|Aladdin (1992 Disney film)}}\nIn the first film, street rat Aladdin meets a girl in the marketplace. He falls deeply in love with her at first sight, but he gets into trouble when their meeting is interrupted by guards who arrest him. She reveals that she is actually [[Princess Jasmine]]. Despite Jasmine's efforts to demand the guards to release Aladdin immediately, they tell her that she must first deal with [[Jafar (Disney)|Jafar]] in order to free him.\n\nIn prison, Aladdin meets an old man (who is actually Jafar in disguise) who mentions a cave filled with treasure and that he needs Aladdin to enter it. The old man reveals a secret exit, and Aladdin escapes with him and follows him into the desert. He enters the Cave of Wonders, where he meets a sentient [[Magic Carpet (Aladdin)|magic carpet]] and is commanded to only get a magic lamp. He gets it, but Abu's grabbing of a giant gem causes the cave to collapse. Aladdin, [[List of Disney's Aladdin characters#Abu|Abu]], and the carpet are left in the cave. Abu delivers the lamp to Aladdin, and when he rubs it, a giant blue [[Genie (Aladdin)|Genie]] appears, telling Aladdin he will fulfill three wishes. After leaving the collapsed cave with the Genie's help, he decides to become a prince in order to win Jasmine's heart.\n\n=== ''The Return of Jafar'' ===\n{{Main|The Return of Jafar}}\nIn the first [[direct-to-video]] [[sequel]], ''[[The Return of Jafar]]'' (1994), Jasmine begins to question her love for Aladdin, wondering if he is a duplicitous liar after he saves Iago, Jafar's former pet parrot who had [[Torture|tortured]] her father. Meanwhile, Jafar is freed from his lamp by a socially awkward bandit named Abis Mal, and immediately plots his retribution against Aladdin. \n\n=== ''Aladdin'' (TV series) ===\n{{Main|Aladdin (TV series)}}\nAn animated series was created for [[Disney Channel (Asia)|Disney Channel]] and [[Toon Disney]] which aired from 1994 to 1996, based on the original 1992 feature. The series picked up where ''The Return of Jafar'' left off, with Aladdin still living on the streets of Agrabah, engaged to Jasmine.\n\nIn the ''[[Aladdin (TV series)|Aladdin]]'' television episode ''The Lost Ones'' it is shown that he had a childhood friend named Amal. The episode ''Seems Like Old Crimes'' shows that when Aladdin was sixteen, he fell in with a group of circus performers where he met his pet monkey Abu. Abu is a brown little monkey.\n\n=== ''Aladdin and the King of Thieves'' ===\n{{Main|Aladdin and the King of Thieves}}\nIn the second [[direct-to-video]]/DVD movie and third film in the series, ''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]'', Aladdin discovers that his long-lost father, Cassim, is still alive, and sets out to find him. Cassim had left the family shortly after his son's birth. Aladdin's mother died when he was just a child. At the climax of the film, Jasmine and Aladdin are finally wed, and Aladdin reconciles with his father. ''The Return of Jafar'' and ''Aladdin and the King of Thieves'' together serve as bookends to the [[Aladdin (TV series)]] as its [[prologue]] and [[epilogue]], respectively.\n\n=== ''Aladdin'' (2019 film) ===\n{{Main|Aladdin (2019 film)}}\nIn the live action movie-adaptation of the first Aladdin movie of the same name, Aladdin is portrayed by [[Mena Massoud]]. The plot follows the story of human form [[Genie (Disney)|Genie]], as he tells a story to his two children about a street urchin named Aladdin, who falls in love with Princess Jasmine, befriends a wish-granting Genie, and battles the conspiring Jafar.\n\n== In other media ==\nAladdin was formerly a member of the Disney Adventurers franchise targeted at young boys sold by the [[Disney Store]] from 1999-2004, which sold various merchandise, mostly including toys.\n\n''[[Hercules and the Arabian Night]]'' is set after the end of ''King of Thieves'' as Jasmine refers to herself as married. He is featured as a guest in [[Disney's House of Mouse]], ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]'' and [[Mickey's House of Villains]]''.\n\nAladdin appears in various video games, including the [[List of Disney's Aladdin video games|game versions of the film]]. Aladdin has also appeared in the acclaimed ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series of games. In all his appearances in the series, he is a playable character or can be added to player's party. He wields a [[scimitar]] as his primary weapon and can utilize Abu to solve puzzles when he is an active party member. In the first game, [[Princess Jasmine]] is kidnapped by Jafar and [[Maleficent (Disney)|Maleficent]]. Aladdin teams up with [[Characters of Kingdom Hearts#Sora|Sora]] to save her. In ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', Aladdin is found experiencing deep [[Depression (mood)|depression]] due to his loneliness after Genie went to see the other worlds. When Genie comes back all is well again.\n\nAladdin appears in the [[Nintendo 3DS]] game \"[[Disney Magical World]].\" Agrabah is one of the four movie worlds accessible to the player, and several characters from the movie appear in the game. The player may also collect a number of Aladdin-themed items and clothing pieces.\n\nAladdin is a [[Player character|playable character]] in ''[[Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes]]'' through [[Downloadable content|DLC]].<ref>{{cite web | work=[[Kotaku]] | title=Aladdin And Princess Jasmine Are Coming To Disney Infinity|url=https://kotaku.com/aladdin-and-princess-jasmine-are-coming-to-disney-infin-1617505649}}</ref>\n\nAladdin also appears at the [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]] as a [[meetable character]]. He is a frequently-seen character, and often accompanied by Jasmine, and occasionally Genie. Though he goes barefoot in the film, he wears moccasins in his street rat clothes. Aladdin, Jasmine, Carpet, Abu and Genie make cameo appearances in the [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] version of [[It's a Small World]].\n\nIn the [[Aladdin (2011 musical)|Broadway musical]] adaptation, Aladdin is played by actor Adam Jacobs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/182186-Adam-Jacobs-and-Courtney-Reed-Will-Co-Star-in-Disneys-Aladdin-Complete-Cast-Announced?tsrc=nx |title=Adam Jacobs and Courtney Reed Will Co-Star in Disney's Aladdin; Complete Cast Announced |publisher=[[Playbill]] |work=playbill.com |date=16 September 2013 |accessdate=11 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213124450/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/182186-Adam-Jacobs-and-Courtney-Reed-Will-Co-Star-in-Disneys-Aladdin-Complete-Cast-Announced?tsrc=nx |archivedate=13 December 2013 }}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Portal|Disney}}\n* [http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/characters/aladdin/aladdin.html Aladdin] at [[Disney]] Archives\n\n{{Disney's Aladdin}}\n{{Disney Princess}}\n\n[[Category:Aladdin (franchise) characters]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Film characters introduced in 1992]]\n[[Category:Adventure film characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional Arabs]]\n[[Category:Fictional viziers]]\n[[Category:Fictional hoboes]]\n[[Category:Fictional outlaws]]\n[[Category:Disney Prince characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional sultans and sultanas]]\n[[Category:Animated human characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional thieves]]\n[[Category:Male characters in animation]]\n[[Category:Teenage characters in film]]\n[[Category:Child characters in musical theatre]]\n", "name_user": "Nealbo", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: 1999-2004 \u2192 1999\u20132004", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aladdin_(Disney_character)"}

The next day, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] looks after Maggie instead of Marge, and he takes her to a different park with food trucks. Maggie sees Hudson waiting for her in the adjacent park and desperately tries to get his attention, but Homer pulls her away before she can. That night, Maggie drowns her sorrows in baby formula and becomes despondent over not being able to see Hudson.\n\nThe next day, Homer babysits Maggie again. Before he can take her to the same park as the day before, Maggie grabs hold of the car's steering wheel and steers it into the park where she met Hudson. She sees him boarding a train for children and runs across the park to catch up with him. When Hudson sees Maggie trying to catch up with the train, he reaches out to her with her blue bow, but she fails to catch up before the train pulls away out of her reach. Maggie believes Hudson is gone forever, but the train (running on a circular closed track) loops around to the station at which it started. Maggie and Hudson reunite on the train's cowcatcher, and they exchange pacifiers (in lieu of sharing a kiss).\n\n== Release ==\n''Playdate with Destiny'' was first announced to the public on the show's official Instagram on February 27, 2020.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B9GRqCFnI6M/|title=The Simpsons on Instagram: \u201cMaggie Simpson is speechless...

In 2012, the album was ranked number 452 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.<ref name=\"500-greatest\">{{cite magazine| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-156826/john-prine-john-prine-38560/| year=2012| title=500 Greatest Albums of All Time Rolling Stone\u2019s definitive list of the 500 greatest albums of all time| magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]| accessdate= September 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Recording==\nPrine was offered a recording contract by [[Jerry Wexler]] of Atlantic Records after the record executive saw the singer perform several of his own songs at a [[Kris Kristofferson]] show at [[the Bitter End]].  The song \"Paradise\" was recorded at A&R Studios in New York (with Prine's brother Dave and good friend [[Steve Goodman]] as sidemen) but the remaining cuts were recorded at [[American Sound Studios]] in Memphis.  Produced by [[Arif Mardin]], who had previously collaborated with the likes of [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[King Curtis]], Prine found his new studio surroundings intimidating.  In the ''Great Days: The John Prine Anthology'' liner notes he admits, \"I was terrified.  I went straight from playing by myself, still learning how to sing, to playing with [[Elvis Presley]]'s rhythm section.\"  Initially, the musicians at American, accustomed to playing heavily rhythmic material and funky grooves, were thrown by Prine and his songs.  As recounted in Eddie Huffman's biography ''John Prine: In Spite of Himself'', percussionist Hayward Bishop later recalled, \u201cThere was no evidence of groove whatever, and I was hungry for groove.  Prine came off like a folk poet.  This guy was really nasally, he didn\u2019t have any tone to his voice, and all his songs were in the same key! I thought, \u2018This is gonna be like milking a dag-blasted dog!\u2019\u201d{{sfn|Huffman|2015|p=55}}\n\n==Composition==\n''John Prine'' features some of Prine's most heralded compositions, including \"Sam Stone\", \"Paradise\"  and \"Hello In There\".\n\n\"Sam Stone\", a song about a drug-addicted veteran with a [[Purple Heart]] and his death by overdose, was originally titled \"Great Society Conflict Veteran's Blues\".  The most familiar refrain in the song is \"There's a hole in daddy's arm, where all the money goes.\"  The song is usually interpreted as a reference to the phenomenon of [[heroin]] or [[morphine]] addiction among [[Vietnam War]] veterans (an identical surge of addiction followed the Civil War, where morphine addiction was known as 'Soldiers Disease'). The song does not mention the Vietnam War, saying only that Sam returned from \"serving in the conflict overseas.\"  There is a single explicit reference to morphine but Prine alludes to heroin on several occasions including the use of the term \"habit,\" slang commonly associated with heroin use, and the line \"he popped his last balloon,\" very likely referring to one of the ways in which street heroin is commonly packaged - in small rubber balloons.\n\nPrine wrote \"Paradise\" for his father, recalling the devastating impact of strip mining for coal, whereby the top of the mountain is blasted off with dynamite to reach the coal seam below.  The song is also about what happened to the area around the [[Green River (Kentucky)|Green River]] in [[Kentucky]] because of the strip mining.  \"Paradise\" references the Peabody Coal Company and is named for a now-defunct town called Paradise in [[Muhlenberg County, Kentucky]].  The song has become a bluegrass standard, with Prine telling Jasper Rees of theArtsdesk.com that \"When bluegrass musicians gather together, whenever they're together for more than an hour, I'd say that 'Paradise' is one of those songs that one of them starts to play it and they all know it.  Which is pretty neat cos it's a real close personal song.  It was written for my father about where all my family's from, that doesn't exist any more, and to think a song like that - I wasn't even going to record it because I didn't think anybody would be able to pronounce Muhlenberg.\"\n\nIn the ''Great Days'' anthology liner notes Prine claims that he composed \"Hello In There\" as a tribute to senior citizens, saying he \"always had an affinity for old people. I used to help a buddy with his newspaper route, and I delivered to a Baptist old peoples home where we\u2019d have to go room-to-room. And some of the patients would kind of pretend that you were a grandchild or nephew that had come to visit, instead of the guy delivering papers. That always stuck in my head.  It was all that stuff together, along with that pretty melody. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done a show without singing 'Hello in There'. Nothing in it wears on me.\" In the same essay, Prine explains that the album opener \"Illegal Smile\" was \"not about smokin\u2019 dope. It was more about how, ever since I was a child, I had this view of the world where I can find myself smiling at stuff nobody else was smiling at. But it was such a good anthem for dope smokers that I didn't want to stop every time I played it and make a disclaimer.\"  According to Prine biographer Eddie Huffman, \u201cSpanish Pipedream\u201d is \u201ca hilarious [[Age of Aquarius]] anthem, the hippie commune ideal summed up in less than four minutes.\u201d{{sfn|Huffman|2015|p=49}}\n\nPrine told Paul Zollo of ''BlueRailroad'' that he wrote \"Angel from Montgomery\" after a friend suggested writing \"another song about old people\", referring to Prine's song \"Hello In There.\" Although Prine had \"said everything I wanted to [about seniors] in 'Hello In There'\" he was intrigued by the idea of \"a song about a middle-aged woman who feels older than she is...I had this really vivid picture of this woman standing over the dishwater with soap in her hands...She wanted to get out of her house and her marriage and everything. She just wanted an angel to come to take her away from all this.\"  Prine believes he was likely drawn to [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] as the song's setting by virtue of being a fan of [[Hank Williams]], who had ties to that city.\n\nFor the sleeve to his 1988 release ''John Prine Live'', the singer wrote that the tragic \"Six O'Clock News\" was about a neighborhood kid \"who was always in trouble and chose me as a friend. His brothers pushed him around a lot, and his mother generally ignored him.  Years later as a teenager, still in trouble, he ended up in Juvenile Court and the prosecutor decided to tell my friend that his father was his father, but his mother was his oldest sister. No wonder he was always in trouble.\"  \u201cDonald and Lydia\u201d was originally called \u201cNatural\u201d about two young lovers failing to connect with anybody but themselves and got the characters\u2019 names from a book to help expectant parents name their baby.{{sfn|Huffman|2015|p=50}}  Prine biographer Eddie Huffman notes, \u201cOn the surface the song may have been about masturbation, but on another level Prine aimed at a deeper truth about loneliness and isolation.{{sfn|Huffman|2015|p=51}}  Steve Goodman would cover the song on his self-titled 1971 album.\n\n\"Your Flag Decal Won't Get You into Heaven Anymore\" is an anti-war song which attacks phony [[patriotism]], especially in the context of exhibitionistic [[chauvinism]]. The song was inspired by an edition of ''Reader\u2019s Digest'' featuring a free flag decal, \u201csuitable for sticking on car windows, storm doors, or anywhere else Middle America felt inspired to show its fealty to the U.S. government.\u201d{{sfn|Huffman|2015|p=41}}\n\nPrine has said in several interviews that \"Far From Me\" is his favorite song that he has written, with the John Prine Shrine website quoting the singer explaining that the line ''a broken bottle looks just like a diamond ring'' \"is in reference to my childhood. We were raised close to a junkyard and one of my favorite pastimes was playing in the junkyard breaking bottles. The kids always commented that the fragments of glass looked just like a field of diamonds. The majority of my songs are written from life experiences and a lot of times there is not any symbolism but just words that take me to another place and time.\"\n\n==Album cover==\n\nThe album cover of ''John Prine'' features the singer sitting on a bale of straw. \"I thought they coulda had me on a bus or something\", the [[Chicago]] native remembered to Lloyd Sachs in 2005. Prine admitted that he had never sat on a bale of straw in his life and joked that the photographer probably \"saw the hick in me trying to get out\".{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 =[[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"AM\">{{cite web |first=William |last=Ruhlman |title= ''John Prine'' > Review |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id= r15818 |pure_url=yes}} |website=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref>\n|rev2 = ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|Christgau's Record Guide]]''\n|rev2Score = A<ref name=\"CG\">{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=089919026X|chapter=Consumer Guide '70s: P|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_chap.php?k=P&bk=70|accessdate=March 10, 2019|via=robertchristgau.com}}</ref>\n}}\nAfter the album's release, Karin Berg of ''Rolling Stone'' wrote, \"This is a very good first album by a very good songwriter. Good songwriters are on the rise, but John Prine is differently good. His work demands some time and thought from the listener \u2014 he's not out to write pleasant tunes, he wants to arrest the cursory listener and get attention for some important things he has to say and, thankfully, he says them without falling into the common trap of writing with overtones of self-importance or smugness. His melodies are excellent.\"<ref name=\"RS\">{{cite magazine |title= ''John Prine'' Review |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] }}</ref> ''[[Village Voice]]'' critic [[Robert Christgau]] wrote: \"You suspect at first that these standard riffs and reliable rhythms are designed to support the lyrics rather than accompany them. But the homespun sarcasm of singing that comes on as tuneless as the tunes themselves soon reveals itself as an authentic, rather catchy extension of Nashville and Appalachia--and then so do the tunes, and the riffs, and the rhythms.\"<ref name=\"CG\"/> Writing for [[Allmusic]], critic William Ruhlman says of the album: \"A revelation upon its release, this album is now a collection of standards...Prine's music, a mixture of folk, rock, and country, is deceptively simple, like his pointed lyrics, and his easy vocal style adds a humorous edge that makes otherwise funny jokes downright hilarious. In the original album's liner notes, Kris Kristofferson marveled, \"\"Twenty-four years old and writes like he's two-hundred and twenty.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/>\n\nIn 2009, [[Bob Dylan]] told ''The Huffington Post'' that Prine was one of his favorite writers, stating \"Prine's stuff is pure Proustian existentialism. Midwestern mindtrips to the nth degree. And he writes beautiful songs. I remember when Kris Kristofferson first brought him on the scene. All that stuff about \"Sam Stone,\" the soldier junkie daddy, and \"Donald and Lydia,\" where people make love from ten miles away. Nobody but Prine could write like that.\" Prine biographer Eddie Huffman contends, \"''John Prine'' introduced its namesake to the world like few debut albums before or since.  Everything his fans would come to love about him - drama, humor, memorable characters, great stories, a badass outsider stance offset by a reverence for tradition - could be found, fully developed, in its forty-four minutes and seven seconds.\"{{sfn|Huffman|2015|p=58}} Prine himself states in the ''Great Days'' anthology, \"It's not an easy album for me to listen to, because I can hear in my voice how uncomfortable I felt at the time. But I loved the sound of the record, and I can see how for a lot of people it's their favourite record of mine.\"\n\nMany of the songs on John Prine have been recorded by other artists. \"Paradise\" is one of the singer's most covered tunes, having been recorded by [[Johnny Cash]], [[John Fogerty]], [[the Everly Brothers]] and [[Lynn Anderson]], among many others. \"Angel from Montgomery\" was recorded in 1972 by [[Carly Simon]] in her first session for the ''No Secrets'' album and has also been recorded by [[Bonnie Raitt]], who told ''Performing Songwriter'' magazine in 2000, \"I think 'Angel from Montgomery' probably meant more to my fans and my body of work than any other song.\" \"Hello In There\" has appeared on albums by [[Joan Baez]], [[Bette Midler]], and [[David Allan Coe]]. [[John Denver]] covered \"Spanish Pipedream\" (retitled \"Blow Up Your TV\", on his 1972 album [[Aerie (album)|''Aerie'']] ), \"Paradise\" (on [[Rocky Mountain High (album)|''Rocky Mountain High'']], later the same year), and \u201cAngel from Montgomery\u201d (retitled \"Angels from Montgomery\", on his 1973 album [[Farewell Andromeda (album)|''Farewell Andromeda'']] ).

The song was inspired by an edition of ''Reader\u2019s Digest'' featuring a free flag decal, \u201csuitable for sticking on car windows, storm doors, or anywhere else Middle America felt inspired to show its fealty to the U.S. government.\u201d{{sfn|Huffman|2015|p=41}}  \n\nPrine has said in several interviews that \"Far From Me\" is his favorite song that he has written, with the John Prine Shrine website quoting the singer explaining that the line ''a broken bottle looks just like a diamond ring'' \"is in reference to my childhood. We were raised close to a junkyard and one of my favorite pastimes was playing in the junkyard breaking bottles. The kids always commented that the fragments of glass looked just like a field of diamonds. The majority of my songs are written from life experiences and a lot of times there is not any symbolism but just words that take me to another place and time.\"\n\n==Album cover==\n\n\nThe album cover of ''John Prine'' features the singer sitting on a bale of straw. \"I thought they coulda had me on a bus or something\", the [[Chicago]] native remembered to Lloyd Sachs in 2005. Prine admitted that he had never sat on a bale of straw in his life and joked that the photographer probably \"saw the hick in me trying to get out\".{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 =[[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"AM\">{{cite web |first=William |last=Ruhlman |title= ''John Prine'' > Review |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id= r15818 |pure_url=yes}} |website=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref>\n|rev2 = ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|Christgau's Record Guide]]''\n|rev2Score = A<ref name=\"CG\">{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=089919026X|chapter=Consumer Guide '70s: P|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_chap.php?k=P&bk=70|accessdate=March 10, 2019|via=robertchristgau.com}}</ref>\n}}\nAfter the album's release, Karin Berg of ''Rolling Stone'' wrote, \"This is a very good first album by a very good songwriter. Good songwriters are on the rise, but John Prine is differently good. His work demands some time and thought from the listener \u2014 he's not out to write pleasant tunes, he wants to arrest the cursory listener and get attention for some important things he has to say and, thankfully, he says them without falling into the common trap of writing with overtones of self-importance or smugness. His melodies are excellent.\"<ref name=\"RS\">{{cite magazine |title= ''John Prine'' Review |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] }}</ref> ''[[Village Voice]]'' critic [[Robert Christgau]] wrote: \"You suspect at first that these standard riffs and reliable rhythms are designed to support the lyrics rather than accompany them. But the homespun sarcasm of singing that comes on as tuneless as the tunes themselves soon reveals itself as an authentic, rather catchy extension of Nashville and Appalachia--and then so do the tunes, and the riffs, and the rhythms.\"<ref name=\"CG\"/> Writing for [[Allmusic]], critic William Ruhlman says of the album: \"A revelation upon its release, this album is now a collection of standards...Prine's music, a mixture of folk, rock, and country, is deceptively simple, like his pointed lyrics, and his easy vocal style adds a humorous edge that makes otherwise funny jokes downright hilarious. In the original album's liner notes, Kris Kristofferson marveled, \"\"Twenty-four years old and writes like he's two-hundred and twenty.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/>\n\nIn 2009, [[Bob Dylan]] told ''The Huffington Post'' that Prine was one of his favorite writers, stating \"Prine's stuff is pure Proustian existentialism. Midwestern mindtrips to the nth degree. And he writes beautiful songs. I remember when Kris Kristofferson first brought him on the scene. All that stuff about \"Sam Stone,\" the soldier junkie daddy, and \"Donald and Lydia,\" where people make love from ten miles away. Nobody but Prine could write like that.\" Prine biographer Eddie Huffman contends, \"''John Prine'' introduced its namesake to the world like few debut albums before or since.  Everything his fans would come to love about him - drama, humor, memorable characters, great stories, a badass outsider stance offset by a reverence for tradition - could be found, fully developed, in its forty-four minutes and seven seconds.\"{{sfn|Huffman|2015|p=58}} Prine himself states in the ''Great Days'' anthology, \"It's not an easy album for me to listen to, because I can hear in my voice how uncomfortable I felt at the time. But I loved the sound of the record, and I can see how for a lot of people it's their favourite record of mine.\"  \n\nMany of the songs on John Prine have been recorded by other artists. \"Paradise\" is one of the singer's most covered tunes, having been recorded by [[Johnny Cash]], [[John Fogerty]], [[the Everly Brothers]] and [[Lynn Anderson]], among many others. \"Angel from Montgomery\" was recorded in 1972 by [[Carly Simon]] in her first session for the ''No Secrets'' album and has also been recorded by [[Bonnie Raitt]], who told ''Performing Songwriter'' magazine in 2000, \"I think 'Angel from Montgomery' probably meant more to my fans and my body of work than any other song.\" \"Hello In There\" has appeared on albums by [[Joan Baez]], [[Bette Midler]], and [[David Allan Coe]]. [[John Denver]] covered \"Spanish Pipedream\" (retitled \"Blow Up Your TV\", on his 1972 album [[Aerie (album) | ''Aerie'']] ), \"Paradise\" (on [[Rocky Mountain High (album) | ''Rocky Mountain High'']], later the same year), and \u201cAngel from Montgomery\u201d (retitled \"Angels from Montgomery\", on his 1973 album [[Farewell Andromeda (album) | ''Farewell Andromeda'']] ).
