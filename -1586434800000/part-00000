The players must deal with the pressures of adolescence and their football-obsessed community while having their hard coach on their back constantly. In the small (fictional) town of West Canaan, [[Texas]], football is a way of life, and losing is not an option.\n\nThe film drew a domestic box office gross of $52 million against its estimated $16 million budget despite mixed critical reviews.<ref>[http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=varsityblues.htm ''Varsity Blues''] at Box Office Mojo</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nJonathan \"Mox\" Moxon ([[James Van Der Beek]]) is an intelligent and academically gifted backup [[quarterback]] for the West Canaan High School football team. Despite his relative popularity at school, easy friendships with other players, and smart and sassy girlfriend, Jules Harbor ([[Amy Smart]]), he is dissatisfied with his life. He wants to leave Texas to go to school at [[Brown University]]. He is constantly at odds with his football-obsessed father, Sam ([[Thomas F. Duffy]]), and dreads playing it under legendary coach Bud Kilmer ([[Jon Voight]]), a verbally abusive, controlling authority who believes in winning \"at all costs\". He has a strong track record as coach, remarking in a speech that \"in my thirty years of coaching at West Canaan, I have brought two state titles, and 22 district championships!\" His philosophy finally takes its toll on Coyotes' quarterback, Lance Harbor ([[Paul Walker]]), Mox's best friend and Jules' brother. Lance is manipulated into taking anesthetic shots into an injured knee that finally succumbs to failure and results in even greater injury during gameplay. He is rushed to the hospital, where doctors are appalled at the massive amount of scar tissue found under his knee.\n\nMox, who has accompanied Lance to the hospital, is shocked when Bud feigns ignorance to Lance's doctors about his knee problems, when in fact Bud ordered the trainer to inject the shots. In need of a new quarterback, he reluctantly names Mox to replace Lance as [[team captain|captain]] and starting quarterback. The move brings unexpected dividends for him, one of them being Darcy Sears ([[Ali Larter]]), Lance's beautiful blonde cheerleader girlfriend, who is interested in marrying a football player in order to escape small-town life. She even goes so far as to attempt to [[seduce]] Mox, sporting a \"[[bikini]]\" made of [[whipped cream]] over her otherwise naked body, but he rebuffs her as gently as he can.\n\nDisgusted with Bud and not feeling a strong need to win, Mox starts calling his own plays on the field without Bud's approval. He also chides Sam, screaming at him, \"I don't want your life!\" He had been a football player at West Canaan, and although Bud dismissed him for lacking talent and courage, he still respected and obeyed him. When Bud becomes aware that Mox has won a full scholarship to Brown, he threatens him that if he continues to disobey and disrespect him, he will alter his transcripts in order to reverse the decision on his scholarship.\n\nKilmer's lack of concern for players continues, resulting in a dramatic collapse of Mox's friend, offensive lineman Billy Bob ([[Ron Lester]]), due to a concussion suffered in an earlier game. When running back Wendell Brown ([[Eliel Swinton]]), another friend of Mox's, is injured on the field in the final regular season game, Kilmer pressures him to take a shot of cortisone to deaden the pain from his injury, allowing him to continue even in the face of a permanent injury. Desperate to be recruited by a good college, he grants his consent. At this moment, Mox tells Bud he will quit the team if the needle enters Wendell's knee. Undaunted, he orders Charlie Tweeder ([[Scott Caan]]), a friend of both Mox and Wendell, to replace the former, but he refuses. Mox tells Bud that the only way they will return to the field is without him. Realizing that he will be forced to forfeit the game, he loses control and physically assaults Mox. The other players intercede and then refuse to take to the field. Knowing his loss of control has cost him his credibility, Kilmer tries in vain to rally support and spark the team's spirit into trusting him, but none of the players follow him out of the locker room. He continues down the hall, and seeing no one following him, turns in the other direction and into his office. The Coyotes use a five receiver offense in the second half, and go on to win the game and the district championship without Kilmer's guidance, thanks in large part to Lance calling the plays from the sideline, and Billy Bob scoring a touchdown on a hook and ladder play. \n\nIn a voice-over [[epilogue]], Mox recounts what happens to several characters' after the game. Kilmer cleaned out his office before leaving town and never coached again, although the bronze statue of Kilmer is still at the high school, but only because it was too big to move. Lance became a successful high school coach. Tweeder drank beer, because...Tweeder drinks beer. Billy Bob cried in celebration of winning the game, because...Billy Bob is a crier. And, Mox went on to enroll at Brown University the next fall on an academic scholarship.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Van Der Beek]] as Jonathon \"Mox\" Moxon, an academically successful, yet rebellious backup quarterback. \n* [[Jon Voight]] as Coach Bud Kilmer, the Coyotes 30-year head coach. \n* [[Paul Walker]] as Lance Harbor, the original captain and starting quarterback of the Coyotes. \n* [[Amy Smart]] as Jules Harbor, Mox's girlfriend and Lance's younger sister.\n* [[Ron Lester]] as Billy Bob, an overweight but powerful offensive guard. \n* [[Scott Caan]] as Charlie Tweeder, a wild, cocky and hard partying [[wide receiver]] for the Coyotes. \n* [[Eliel Swinton]] as Wendell Brown, the [[running back]].\n* [[Ali Larter]] as Darcy Sears, Lance's girlfriend and the cheerleader captain.\n* [[Richard Lineback]] as Joe Harbor, Lance's and Jules' father.  \n* [[Thomas F.

He had been a Canon of the Cathedral of Compostella, and under the patronage of Bishop [[Diego Gelmirez]], a Cluniac, he was said to have been a co-author of the ''[[Historia Compostellana]]''.<ref>Flor\u00e9z, p. 57, 68.</ref> In 1103-1104 he was sent to Rome on an embassy for the Church of Compostella, and obtained a bull granting numerous privileges, one of which was the right of the Bishop of Compostella to name Cardinals of Compostella.

He was ordained a priest on the day before Passion Sunday, and was consecrated a bishop on 23 March 1113 by Archbishop [[Antipope Gregory VIII|Mauricio Burdino]] of Braga, another Cluniac.<ref>Flor\u00e9z, p. 59.</ref> As Bishop of Porto he secured from [[Pope Paschal II]], by a bull granted on 15 August 1115, exemption of his diocese from the supervisory control of the Archbishop of Braga.<ref>Flor\u00e9z, pp. 297-299. Burdinus became an antipope of the Emperor V in Rome on 8 March 1118.</ref> He greatly enlarged his diocese and the cathedral patrimony increased by the donations he secured; thus, in 1120, he received from D. [[Theresa, Countess of Portugal|Theresa]] jurisdiction over the City of Porto with all the rents and dues thereof.<ref>Flor\u00e9z, pp. 64, 299.</ref> Bishop Hugo was present at the Council of Compostella in 1114, the Council of Sagunto in 1121 (under the presidency of Cardinal Boso, the papal Legate), and the Synod of Compostella in 1122.<ref>Thomas (da Cunha) ''Historia ecclesiae Lusitaniae'' III, p. 30.</ref>\n\nJohn Peculiar was promoted to [[Braga]] (1138), his nephew, Pedro Rabaldis, succeeding at Porto. Next came D. [[Pedro Pit\u00f5es]] (1145 to 1152 or 1155), D. Pedro S\u00e9nior (d. 1172), and D. Fern\u00e3o Martins (d. 1185). Martinho Pires instituted a chapter, was promoted to Braga, 1189 or 1190. Martinho Rodrigues ruled from 1191 to 1235. He quarrelled with the chapter over their share of the rents of the see. Later on, fresh disagreements arose in which King [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho I]] intervened against the bishop, who was deprived of his goods and had to flee, but was restored by the king when Innocent III espoused the bishop's cause. Another quarrel soon arouse between prelate and king, and the bishop was imprisoned; but he escaped and fled to Rome, and in 1209 the king, feeling the approach of death, made peace with him. His successor, Pedro Salvadores, figured prominently in the questions between the clergy and King [[Sancho II of Portugal|Sancho II]], who refused to ecclesiastics the right of purchasing or inheriting land. Portugal fell into anarchy, in which the clergy's rights were violated and their persons outraged, though they themselves were not guiltless. Finally, Pope Innocent IV committed the reform of abuses to [[Afonso III of Portugal|Afonso III]], brother of [[Sancho II of Portugal|Sancho II]], who lost his crown.\n\nUnder Bishop Julian (1247\u201360) the jurisdiction difficulty became aggravated. A settlement was effected at the Cortes of [[Leiria]] (1254), which the bishop refused to ratify, but he had to give way. When King Afonso III determined (1265) that all rights and properties usurped during the disorders of Sancho's reign should revert to the Crown, nearly all the bishops, including the Bishop of Porto, then D. Vicente, protested; and seven went to Rome for relief, leaving Portugal under an interdict. When the king was dying, in 1278, he promised restitution. Vicente (d. 1296) was one of the negotiators of the [[Concordat of Forty Articles|Concordat of 1289]] and the supplementary Accord of Eleven Articles. He was succeeded by Sancho Pires, who ruled until 1300. Geraldo Domingues resigned in 1308 to act as counsellor of the King's daughter Constan\u00e7a, future Queen of Castile. Tredulo was bishop for two and a half years. The Minorite Frei Est\u00eav\u00e3o was succeeded in 1313 by his nephew Fernando Ramires. Both uncle and nephew quarrelled with King Denis and left the realm.\n\nOwing to the hostility of the citizens, Bishop Gomes lived mostly outside his diocese. When Pedro Afonso became bishop in 1343, he had a quarrel over jurisdiction and, like his predecessor, departed, leaving the diocese under interdict. Six years later he returned, but again the monarch began to encroach, and it was not until 1354 that the bishop secured recognition of his rights. His successor was Afonso Pires. Eg\u00eddio is probably the bishop represented in the old Chronicles as being threatened with scourging by King Pedro for having lived in sin with a citizen's wife The accusation was probably groundless, but Eg\u00eddio left the city, which for twelve years had no bishop.\n\nOther bishops were: John de Zambuja, or Est\u00eav\u00e3o; and Gil, who in 1406 sold the episcopal rights over Oporto to the Crown for an annual money payment, reduced in the reign of D. Manuel to 120 silver marks; Fernando Guerra, who in 1425 was created Archbishop of Braga; Vasco. \u2014 Ant\u00e3o Martins de Chaves, who succeeded Vasco in 1430, was sent by the pope to Constantinople to induce the Greek emperor to attend the Council of Basle. He succeeded, and as a reward was made cardinal. He died in 1447. Succeeding incumbents were: Durando; Gon\u00e7alves de \u00d3bidos; Luis Pires (1454\u201364), a negotiator of the Concordat of 1455 and a reforming prelate; Jo\u00e3o de Azevedo (1465\u20131494), a benefactor of the cathedral and chapter, as was his successor Diego de Sousa, afterwards Archbishop of Braga and executor of King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]]. The see was then held by two brothers in succession, Diogo da Costa (1505-7) and D. Pedro da Costa (1511\u201339), who restored the bishop's palace and enriched the capitular revenues from his own purse; Belchior Beliago; and the Carmelite Frei Baltazar Limpo (1538\u201352), the fiftieth bishop. He held a diocesan synod in 1540.\n\nIn the time of Rodrigo Pinheiro, a learned humanist, Porto was visited by St. Francis Borgia and the Jesuits established themselves in the city. Aires da Silva, ex-rector of Coimbra University, after ruling four years, fell in the [[battle of Alc\u00e1cer Quibir]] in 1578 with King [[Sebastian of Portugal|Sebasti\u00e3o]]. Sim\u00e3o Pereira was followed by the Franciscan Frei Marcos de Lisboa, chronicler of his order. He added to the cathedral and convoked a diocesan synod in 1585. In 1591 another ex-rector of Coimbra, Jer\u00f3nimo de Menezes, became bishop; he was succeeded by the Benedictine Frei Gon\u00e7alo de Morais, a zealous defender of the rights of the Church. He built a new sacristy and chancel in the cathedral. In 1618 Bishop Rodrigo da Cunha, author of the history of the Bishops of Oporto, was appointed. His \"Catalogo\" describes the state of the cathedral and enumerates the parishes of the diocese with their population and income in 1623 and is the earliest account we possess. His successor was Frei Jo\u00e3o de Valadares, transferred from the See of Miranda. Gaspar do Rego da Fonseca, who held the see four years (1635\u201339). King [[Philip III of Portugal|Philip III]] named Francisco Pereira Pinto, but the revolution in 1640 prevented his taking possession; moreover he never received his bulls of consecration and installation from [[Pope Urban VIII]], and therefore he could not be consecrated or installed as bishop.<ref>Gauchat, IV, p. 286, note 7.</ref> The diocese was considered vacant until 1670, being ruled by administrators appointed by the Chapter of the Cathedral (Vicars capitular). In 1641 King [[John IV of Portugal|John IV]] chose D. Sebasti\u00e3o C\u00e9sar de Menezes as bishop, but the pope, influenced by Spain, would neither recognize the new King of Portugal nor confirm his nominations. Next came Frei Pedro de Menezes; Nicolau Monteiro took possession in 1671, Fernando Correia de Lacerda, in 1673, who was succeeded by Jo\u00e3o de Sousa. Frei Jos\u00e9 Saldanha (1697\u20131708), famed for his austerity, never relinquished his Franciscan habit, a contrast to his successor Tom\u00e1s de Almeida, who in 1716 became the first Patriarch of Lisbon. The see remained vacant until 1739, and, though Frei John Maria was then elected, he never obtained confirmation. In the same year Frei Jos\u00e9 Maria da Fonseca, formerly Commissary General of the Franciscans, became bishop. Several European States selected him as arbiter of their differences. He contributed to the canonization of a number of saints. He founded and restored many convents and hospitals.\n\nNext in order were: Frei Ant\u00f3nio de T\u00e1vora (d. 1766), Frei Aleixo de Miranda Henriques, Frei Jo\u00e3o Rafael de Mendon\u00e7a (1771-3), and Louren\u00e7o Correia de S\u00e1 Benevides (1796-8). Frei Antonio de Castro became Patriarch of Lisbon in 1814, being followed at Porto by Jo\u00e3o Avelar. Frei Manuel de Santa In\u00eas, though elected, never obtained confirmation, but some years after his death, relations between Portugal and the Holy See were re-established by a concordat and Jer\u00f3nimo da Costa Rebelo became bishop in 1843. From 1854 to 1859 the see was held by Ant\u00f3nio da Fonseca Moniz; on his death it remained vacant until 1862, when Jo\u00e3o de Castro e Moura, who had been a missionary in China, was appointed (d.1868). The see was again vacant until the confirmation of Am\u00e9rico Ferreira dos Santos Silva in 1871. This prelate was obliged to combat the growing Liberalism of his flock and the Protestant propaganda in Porto A popular lawyer named Mesquita started a campaign against him, because the bishop refused to dismiss some priests, reputed reactionary, who served the Aguardente Chapel; getting himself elected judge of the Brotherhood of the Temple, he provoked a great platform agitation with the result that the chapel was secularized and became a school under the patronage of the Marquis of Pombal Association. In 1879 Am\u00e9rico was created cardinal and on his death the present (1911) Bishop, Ant\u00f3nio Barroso, an ex-missionary, was transferred from the [[see of Mylapore]] to that of Porto.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11260a.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' article]</ref>\n\n===Cathedral===\nThe [[Cathedral of Porto|Porto Cathedral]] was dedicated to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary into Heaven.

He had been a Canon of the Cathedral of Compostella, and under the patronage of Bishop [[Diego Gelmirez]], a Cluniac, he was said to have been a co-author of the ''[[Historia Compostellana]]''.<ref>Flor\u00e9z, p. 57, 68.</ref> In 1103-1104 he was sent to Rome on an embassy for the Church of Compostella, and obtained a bull granting numerous privileges, one of which was the right of the Bishop of Compostella to name Cardinals of Compostella. Hugo became a Cardinal.<ref>Flor\u00e9z, p. 58.</ref> In 1109 he was Archdeacon of Compostella, but at the time of his election to the diocese of Porto although not ordained. He was ordained a priest on the day before Passion Sunday, and was consecrated a bishop on 23 March 1113 by Archbishop [[Antipope Gregory VIII|Mauricio Burdino]] of Braga, another Cluniac.<ref>Flor\u00e9z, p. 59.</ref> As Bishop of Porto he secured from [[Pope Paschal II]], by a bull granted on 15 August 1115, exemption of his diocese from the supervisory control of the Archbishop of Braga.<ref>Flor\u00e9z, pp. 297-299. Burdinus became an antipope of the Emperor V in Rome on 8 March 1118.</ref> He greatly enlarged his diocese and the cathedral patrimony increased by the donations he secured; thus, in 1120, he received from D.

Next came D. [[Pedro Pit\u00f5es]] (1145 to 1152 or 1155), D. Pedro S\u00e9nior (d. 1172), and D. Fern\u00e3o Martins (d. 1185). Martinho Pires instituted a chapter, was promoted to Braga, 1189 or 1190. Martinho Rodrigues ruled from 1191 to 1235. He quarrelled with the chapter over their share of the rents of the see. Later on, fresh disagreements arose in which King [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho I]] intervened against the bishop, who was deprived of his goods and had to flee, but was restored by the king when Innocent III espoused the bishop's cause. Another quarrel soon arouse between prelate and king, and the bishop was imprisoned; but he escaped and fled to Rome, and in 1209 the king, feeling the approach of death, made peace with him. His successor, Pedro Salvadores, figured prominently in the questions between the clergy and King [[Sancho II of Portugal|Sancho II]], who refused to ecclesiastics the right of purchasing or inheriting land. Portugal fell into anarchy, in which the clergy's rights were violated and their persons outraged, though they themselves were not guiltless. Finally, Pope Innocent IV committed the reform of abuses to [[Afonso III of Portugal|Afonso III]], brother of [[Sancho II of Portugal|Sancho II]], who lost his crown.\n\nUnder Bishop Julian (1247\u201360) the jurisdiction difficulty became aggravated. A settlement was effected at the Cortes of [[Leiria]] (1254), which the bishop refused to ratify, but he had to give way. When King Afonso III determined (1265) that all rights and properties usurped during the disorders of Sancho's reign should revert to the Crown, nearly all the bishops, including the Bishop of Porto, then D. Vicente, protested; and seven went to Rome for relief, leaving Portugal under an interdict. When the king was dying, in 1278, he promised restitution. Vicente (d. 1296) was one of the negotiators of the [[Concordat of Forty Articles|Concordat of 1289]] and the supplementary Accord of Eleven Articles. He was succeeded by Sancho Pires, who ruled until 1300. Geraldo Domingues resigned in 1308 to act as counsellor of the King's daughter Constan\u00e7a, future Queen of Castile. Tredulo was bishop for two and a half years. The Minorite Frei Est\u00eav\u00e3o was succeeded in 1313 by his nephew Fernando Ramires. Both uncle and nephew quarrelled with King Denis and left the realm.\n\nOwing to the hostility of the citizens, Bishop Gomes lived mostly outside his diocese. When Pedro Afonso became bishop in 1343, he had a quarrel over jurisdiction and, like his predecessor, departed, leaving the diocese under interdict. Six years later he returned, but again the monarch began to encroach, and it was not until 1354 that the bishop secured recognition of his rights. His successor was Afonso Pires. Eg\u00eddio is probably the bishop represented in the old Chronicles as being threatened with scourging by King Pedro for having lived in sin with a citizen's wife The accusation was probably groundless, but Eg\u00eddio left the city, which for twelve years had no bishop.\n\nOther bishops were: John de Zambuja, or Est\u00eav\u00e3o; and Gil, who in 1406 sold the episcopal rights over Oporto to the Crown for an annual money payment, reduced in the reign of D. Manuel to 120 silver marks; Fernando Guerra, who in 1425 was created Archbishop of Braga; Vasco. \u2014 Ant\u00e3o Martins de Chaves, who succeeded Vasco in 1430, was sent by the pope to Constantinople to induce the Greek emperor to attend the Council of Basle. He succeeded, and as a reward was made cardinal. He died in 1447. Succeeding incumbents were: Durando; Gon\u00e7alves de \u00d3bidos; Luis Pires (1454\u201364), a negotiator of the Concordat of 1455 and a reforming prelate; Jo\u00e3o de Azevedo (1465\u20131494), a benefactor of the cathedral and chapter, as was his successor Diego de Sousa, afterwards Archbishop of Braga and executor of King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]]. The see was then held by two brothers in succession, Diogo da Costa (1505-7) and D. Pedro da Costa (1511\u201339), who restored the bishop's palace and enriched the capitular revenues from his own purse; Belchior Beliago; and the Carmelite Frei Baltazar Limpo (1538\u201352), the fiftieth bishop. He held a diocesan synod in 1540.\n\nIn the time of Rodrigo Pinheiro, a learned humanist, Porto was visited by St. Francis Borgia and the Jesuits established themselves in the city. Aires da Silva, ex-rector of Coimbra University, after ruling four years, fell in the [[battle of Alc\u00e1cer Quibir]] in 1578 with King [[Sebastian of Portugal|Sebasti\u00e3o]]. Sim\u00e3o Pereira was followed by the Franciscan Frei Marcos de Lisboa, chronicler of his order. He added to the cathedral and convoked a diocesan synod in 1585. In 1591 another ex-rector of Coimbra, Jer\u00f3nimo de Menezes, became bishop; he was succeeded by the Benedictine Frei Gon\u00e7alo de Morais, a zealous defender of the rights of the Church. He built a new sacristy and chancel in the cathedral. In 1618 Bishop Rodrigo da Cunha, author of the history of the Bishops of Oporto, was appointed. His \"Catalogo\" describes the state of the cathedral and enumerates the parishes of the diocese with their population and income in 1623 and is the earliest account we possess. His successor was Frei Jo\u00e3o de Valadares, transferred from the See of Miranda. Gaspar do Rego da Fonseca, who held the see four years (1635\u201339). King [[Philip III of Portugal|Philip III]] named Francisco Pereira Pinto, but the revolution in 1640 prevented his taking possession; moreover he never received his bulls of consecration and installation from [[Pope Urban VIII]], and therefore he could not be consecrated or installed as bishop.<ref>Gauchat, IV, p. 286, note 7.</ref> The diocese was considered vacant until 1670, being ruled by administrators appointed by the Chapter of the Cathedral (Vicars capitular). In 1641 King [[John IV of Portugal|John IV]] chose D. Sebasti\u00e3o C\u00e9sar de Menezes as bishop, but the pope, influenced by Spain, would neither recognize the new King of Portugal nor confirm his nominations. Next came Frei Pedro de Menezes; Nicolau Monteiro took possession in 1671, Fernando Correia de Lacerda, in 1673, who was succeeded by Jo\u00e3o de Sousa. Frei Jos\u00e9 Saldanha (1697\u20131708), famed for his austerity, never relinquished his Franciscan habit, a contrast to his successor Tom\u00e1s de Almeida, who in 1716 became the first Patriarch of Lisbon. The see remained vacant until 1739, and, though Frei John Maria was then elected, he never obtained confirmation. In the same year Frei Jos\u00e9 Maria da Fonseca, formerly Commissary General of the Franciscans, became bishop. Several European States selected him as arbiter of their differences. He contributed to the canonization of a number of saints. He founded and restored many convents and hospitals.\n\nNext in order were: Frei Ant\u00f3nio de T\u00e1vora (d. 1766), Frei Aleixo de Miranda Henriques, Frei Jo\u00e3o Rafael de Mendon\u00e7a (1771-3), and Louren\u00e7o Correia de S\u00e1 Benevides (1796-8). Frei Antonio de Castro became Patriarch of Lisbon in 1814, being followed at Porto by Jo\u00e3o Avelar. Frei Manuel de Santa In\u00eas, though elected, never obtained confirmation, but some years after his death, relations between Portugal and the Holy See were re-established by a concordat and Jer\u00f3nimo da Costa Rebelo became bishop in 1843. From 1854 to 1859 the see was held by Ant\u00f3nio da Fonseca Moniz; on his death it remained vacant until 1862, when Jo\u00e3o de Castro e Moura, who had been a missionary in China, was appointed (d.1868). The see was again vacant until the confirmation of Am\u00e9rico Ferreira dos Santos Silva in 1871. This prelate was obliged to combat the growing Liberalism of his flock and the Protestant propaganda in Porto A popular lawyer named Mesquita started a campaign against him, because the bishop refused to dismiss some priests, reputed reactionary, who served the Aguardente Chapel; getting himself elected judge of the Brotherhood of the Temple, he provoked a great platform agitation with the result that the chapel was secularized and became a school under the patronage of the Marquis of Pombal Association. In 1879 Am\u00e9rico was created cardinal and on his death the present (1911) Bishop, Ant\u00f3nio Barroso, an ex-missionary, was transferred from the [[see of Mylapore]] to that of Porto.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11260a.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' article]</ref>\n\n===Cathedral===\nThe [[Cathedral of Porto|Porto Cathedral]] was dedicated to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary into Heaven.

It is bordered with [[Vlora]] to the north, [[Delvina]] and [[Gjirokast\u00ebr]] to the east and with [[Greece]] to the south of [[Ionian Sea]].\nSaranda is a place in the most southern part of Albania. It lies between the hills that descend and reach the Ionian Sea.\nThe district of Saranda has a plain relief which is composed of southern seashore mountains that lie from Borsh to the bay of Ftelia, Vrina Fields and the hills of Saranda, L\u00ebkur\u00ebsi, [[Ksamil]], [[Butrint]] and Konispol. All these units make up the southern part of the [[Albanian Riviera]] where the eye catches the countless bays, beaches, the rocky coastline, hills with olives and citrus, mountains that surround the landscape. Saranda is traversed by Kalasa, Bistrica and Pavlla rivers which flow in the Ionian Sea. \nIn Saranda's hydrograph belongs even Butrinti Lake which is one of the biggest sea lakes in Albania. The Butrint Lake is very rich in sea species and in their waters now are being growing mussels. Its relief, geographical location and subtropical climate create favorable conditions for planting citrus trees and olives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grandhotelsaranda.com/rreth_sarandes-en.html|title=Grand Hotel Saranda|author=|date=|work=grandhotelsaranda.com}}</ref>\n\nThe present municipality was formed at the 2015 local government reform by the merger of the former municipalities [[Ksamil]] and Sarand\u00eb, that became municipal units.

During the summer, temperatures may rise as high as 30 degrees Celsius. However, a refreshing sea breeze constantly blows. Winters are mild and subzero temperatures are uncommon. The wettest months of the year are November and December.

It lies between the hills that descend and reach the Ionian Sea.\nThe district of Saranda has a plain relief which is composed of southern seashore mountains that lie from Borsh to the bay of Ftelia, Vrina Fields and the hills of Saranda, L\u00ebkur\u00ebsi, [[Ksamil]], [[Butrint]] and Konispol. All these units make up the southern part of the [[Albanian Riviera]] where the eye catches the countless bays, beaches, the rocky coastline, hills with olives and citrus, mountains that surround the landscape. Saranda is traversed by Kalasa, Bistrica and Pavlla rivers which flow in the Ionian Sea. \nIn Saranda's hydrograph belongs even Butrinti Lake which is one of the biggest sea lakes in Albania. The Butrint Lake is very rich in sea species and in their waters now are being growing mussels. Its relief, geographical location and subtropical climate create favorable conditions for planting citrus trees and olives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grandhotelsaranda.com/rreth_sarandes-en.html|title=Grand Hotel Saranda|author=|date=|work=grandhotelsaranda.com}}</ref>\n\nThe present municipality was formed at the 2015 local government reform by the merger of the former municipalities [[Ksamil]] and Sarand\u00eb, that became municipal units.
