{"title_page": "T-statistic", "text_new": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:''t''-statistic}}\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2020}}\nIn [[statistics]], the '''''t''-statistic''' is the ratio of the departure of the estimated value of a parameter from its hypothesized value to its [[Standard error (statistics)|standard error]]. It is used in [[statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis testing]] via [[Student's t-test]]. The T-statistic is used in a T test to determine if you should support or reject the null hypothesis. It is very similar to the [[Standard score|Z-score]] but with the difference that T-statistic is used when you either have a small sample size or if you don't know the population standard deviation. Hence, T-statistic is also used in estimating the [[population mean]] from a [[sampling distribution]] of [[sample mean]]s if the population [[standard deviation]] is unknown. It is also used along with [[p-value]] when running hypothesis test where the p-value tells us what the odds are of the results to have happened. A major difference between Z-score and T-statistic is that the latter is used when you don't know anything about a population or if you have a small sample size ( < 30)\n\n==Definition and features==\nLet <math style=\"vertical-align:-.3em\">\\scriptstyle\\widehat\\beta</math> be an [[estimator]] of parameter ''\u03b2'' in some [[statistical model]]. Then a ''t''-statistic for this parameter is any quantity of the form\n: <math>\n    t_{\\widehat{\\beta}} = \\frac{\\widehat\\beta - \\beta_0}{\\operatorname{s.e.}(\\widehat\\beta)}   \n  </math>\nwhere ''\u03b2''<sub>0</sub> is a non-random, known constant which may or may not match the actual unknown parameter value ''\u03b2'', and <math style=\"vertical-align:-.3em\">\\operatorname{s.e.}(\\widehat\\beta)</math> is the [[standard error (statistics)|standard error]] of the estimator <math style=\"vertical-align:-.3em\">\\scriptstyle\\widehat\\beta</math> for ''\u03b2''.\n\nBy default, statistical packages report ''t''-statistic with {{nowrap|''\u03b2''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} 0}} (these ''t''-statistics are used to test the significance of corresponding regressor). However, when ''t''-statistic is needed to test the hypothesis of the form {{nowrap|''H''<sub>0</sub>: ''\u03b2'' {{=}} ''\u03b2''<sub>0</sub>}}, then a non-zero ''\u03b2''<sub>0</sub> may be used.\n\nIf <math style=\"vertical-align:-.3em\">\\scriptstyle\\widehat\\beta</math> is an [[ordinary least squares]] estimator in the classical [[linear regression model]] (that is, with [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] and [[homoscedasticity|homoscedastic]] error terms), and if the true value of the parameter ''\u03b2'' is equal to ''\u03b2''<sub>0</sub>, then the [[sampling distribution]] of the ''t''-statistic is the [[Student's t-distribution|Student's ''t''-distribution]] with {{nowrap|(''n \u2212 k'')}} degrees of freedom, where ''n'' is the number of observations, and ''k'' is the number of regressors (including the intercept){{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}.\n\nIn the majority of models, the estimator <math style=\"vertical-align:-.3em\">\\scriptstyle\\widehat\\beta</math> is [[consistent estimator|consistent]] for ''\u03b2'' and is distributed [[asymptotic normality|asymptotically normally]]. If the true value of the parameter ''\u03b2'' is equal to ''\u03b2''<sub>0</sub> and the quantity <math style=\"vertical-align:-.3em\">\\scriptstyle \\operatorname{s.e.}(\\widehat\\beta)</math> correctly estimates the asymptotic variance of this estimator, then the ''t''-statistic will asymptotically have the [[standard normal]] distribution.\n\nIn some models the distribution of the ''t''-statistic is different from the normal distribution, even asymptotically. For example, when a [[time series]] with a [[unit root]] is regressed in the [[augmented Dickey\u2013Fuller test]], the test ''t''-statistic will asymptotically have one of the Dickey\u2013Fuller distributions (depending on the test setting).\n\n==Use==\n{{Main|t-test{{!}}''t''-test}}\n\nMost frequently, ''t'' statistics are used in [[Student's t test|Student's ''t''-test]]s, a form of [[statistical hypothesis testing]], and in the computation of certain [[confidence interval]]s.\n\nThe key property of the ''t'' statistic is that it is a [[pivotal quantity]] \u2013 while defined in terms of the sample mean, its sampling distribution does not depend on the population parameters, and thus it can be used regardless of what these may be.\n\nOne can also divide a [[Errors and residuals in statistics|residual]] by the sample [[standard deviation]]:\n:<math> g(x,X) = \\frac{x - \\overline{X}}{s} </math>\nto compute an estimate for the number of standard deviations a given sample is from the mean, as a sample version of a [[z-score]], the z-score requiring the population parameters.\n\n===Prediction===\n{{details|Prediction interval#Unknown mean, unknown variance}}\nGiven a normal distribution <math>N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)</math> with unknown mean and variance, the ''t''-statistic of a future observation <math>X_{n+1},</math> after one has made ''n'' observations, is an [[ancillary statistic]] \u2013 a pivotal quantity (does not depend on the values of ''\u03bc'' and ''\u03c3''<sup>2</sup>) that is a statistic (computed from observations). This allows one to compute a frequentist [[prediction interval]] (a predictive [[confidence interval]]), via the following t-distribution:\n:<math>\\frac{X_{n+1}-\\overline{X}_n}{s_n\\sqrt{1+n^{-1}}} \\sim T^{n-1}</math>\nSolving for <math>X_{n+1}</math> yields the prediction distribution\n:<math>\\overline{X}_n + s_n\\sqrt{1+n^{-1}} \\cdot T^{n-1}</math>\nfrom which one may compute predictive confidence intervals \u2013 given a probability ''p,'' one may compute intervals such that 100''p''% of the time, the next observation <math>X_{n+1}</math> will fall in that interval.\n\n==History==\n{{details|Student's t-test}}\nThe term \"''t''-statistic\" is abbreviated from \"hypothesis test statistic\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} In statistics, the t-distribution was first derived as a [[Posterior probability|posterior distribution]] in 1876 by [[Friedrich Robert Helmert|Helmert]]<ref>{{Citation|last=Szab\u00f3|first=Istv\u00e1n|title=Systeme aus einer endlichen Anzahl starrer K\u00f6rper|date=2003|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-61925-0_16|work=Einf\u00fchrung in die Technische Mechanik|pages=196\u2013199|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-540-13293-6|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schlyvitch|first=B.|date=October 1937|title=Untersuchungen \u00fcber den anastomotischen Kanal zwischen der Arteria coeliaca und mesenterica superior und damit in Zusammenhang stehende Fragen|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf02118337|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Anatomie und Entwicklungsgeschichte|volume=107|issue=6|pages=709\u2013737|doi=10.1007/bf02118337|issn=0340-2061}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Helmert|date=1876|title=Die Genauigkeit der Formel von Peters zur Berechnung des wahrscheinlichen Beobachtungsfehlers directer Beobachtungen gleicher Genauigkeit|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/asna.18760880802|journal=Astronomische Nachrichten|language=de|volume=88|issue=8-9|pages=113\u2013131|doi=10.1002/asna.18760880802}}</ref> and [[Jacob L\u00fcroth|L\u00fcroth]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=L\u00fcroth|first=J.|date=1876|title=Vergleichung von zwei Werthen des wahrscheinlichen Fehlers|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/asna.18760871402|journal=Astronomische Nachrichten|language=de|volume=87|issue=14|pages=209\u2013220|doi=10.1002/asna.18760871402}}</ref><ref>Pfanzagl J, Sheynin O (1996). \"Studies in the history of probability and statistics.

It is used in [[statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis testing]] via [[Student's t-test]]. The T-statistic is used in a T test to determine if you should support or reject the null hypothesis. It is very similar to the [[Standard score|Z-score]] but with the difference that T-statistic is used when you either have a small sample size or if you don't know the population standard deviation. Hence, T-statistic is also used in estimating the [[population mean]] from a [[sampling distribution]] of [[sample mean]]s if the population [[standard deviation]] is unknown. It is also used along with [[p-value]] when running hypothesis test where the p-value tells us what the odds are of the results to have happened. A major difference between Z-score and T-statistic is that the latter is used when you don't know anything about a population or if you have a small sample size ( < 30)\n\n==Definition and features==\nLet <math style=\"vertical-align:-.3em\">\\scriptstyle\\widehat\\beta</math> be an [[estimator]] of parameter ''\u03b2'' in some [[statistical model]]. Then a ''t''-statistic for this parameter is any quantity of the form\n: <math>\n    t_{\\widehat{\\beta}} = \\frac{\\widehat\\beta - \\beta_0}{\\operatorname{s.e.}(\\widehat\\beta)}   \n  </math>\nwhere ''\u03b2''<sub>0</sub> is a non-random, known constant which may or may not match the actual unknown parameter value ''\u03b2'', and <math style=\"vertical-align:-.3em\">\\operatorname{s.e.}(\\widehat\\beta)</math> is the [[standard error (statistics)|standard error]] of the estimator <math style=\"vertical-align:-.3em\">\\scriptstyle\\widehat\\beta</math> for ''\u03b2''.\n\nBy default, statistical packages report ''t''-statistic with {{nowrap|''\u03b2''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} 0}} (these ''t''-statistics are used to test the significance of corresponding regressor). However, when ''t''-statistic is needed to test the hypothesis of the form {{nowrap|''H''<sub>0</sub>: ''\u03b2'' {{=}} ''\u03b2''<sub>0</sub>}}, then a non-zero ''\u03b2''<sub>0</sub> may be used.\n\nIf <math style=\"vertical-align:-.3em\">\\scriptstyle\\widehat\\beta</math> is an [[ordinary least squares]] estimator in the classical [[linear regression model]] (that is, with [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] and [[homoscedasticity|homoscedastic]] error terms), and if the true value of the parameter ''\u03b2'' is equal to ''\u03b2''<sub>0</sub>, then the [[sampling distribution]] of the ''t''-statistic is the [[Student's t-distribution|Student's ''t''-distribution]] with {{nowrap|(''n \u2212 k'')}} degrees of freedom, where ''n'' is the number of observations, and ''k'' is the number of regressors (including the intercept){{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}.\n\nIn the majority of models, the estimator <math style=\"vertical-align:-.3em\">\\scriptstyle\\widehat\\beta</math> is [[consistent estimator|consistent]] for ''\u03b2'' and is distributed [[asymptotic normality|asymptotically normally]]. If the true value of the parameter ''\u03b2'' is equal to ''\u03b2''<sub>0</sub> and the quantity <math style=\"vertical-align:-.3em\">\\scriptstyle \\operatorname{s.e.}(\\widehat\\beta)</math> correctly estimates the asymptotic variance of this estimator, then the ''t''-statistic will asymptotically have the [[standard normal]] distribution.\n\nIn some models the distribution of the ''t''-statistic is different from the normal distribution, even asymptotically. For example, when a [[time series]] with a [[unit root]] is regressed in the [[augmented Dickey\u2013Fuller test]], the test ''t''-statistic will asymptotically have one of the Dickey\u2013Fuller distributions (depending on the test setting).\n\n==Use==\n{{Main|t-test{{!}}''t''-test}}\n\nMost frequently, ''t'' statistics are used in [[Student's t test|Student's ''t''-test]]s, a form of [[statistical hypothesis testing]], and in the computation of certain [[confidence interval]]s.\n\nThe key property of the ''t'' statistic is that it is a [[pivotal quantity]] \u2013 while defined in terms of the sample mean, its sampling distribution does not depend on the population parameters, and thus it can be used regardless of what these may be.\n\nOne can also divide a [[Errors and residuals in statistics|residual]] by the sample [[standard deviation]]:\n:<math> g(x,X) = \\frac{x - \\overline{X}}{s} </math>\nto compute an estimate for the number of standard deviations a given sample is from the mean, as a sample version of a [[z-score]], the z-score requiring the population parameters.\n\n===Prediction===\n{{details|Prediction interval#Unknown mean, unknown variance}}\nGiven a normal distribution <math>N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)</math> with unknown mean and variance, the ''t''-statistic of a future observation <math>X_{n+1},</math> after one has made ''n'' observations, is an [[ancillary statistic]] \u2013 a pivotal quantity (does not depend on the values of ''\u03bc'' and ''\u03c3''<sup>2</sup>) that is a statistic (computed from observations). This allows one to compute a frequentist [[prediction interval]] (a predictive [[confidence interval]]), via the following t-distribution:\n:<math>\\frac{X_{n+1}-\\overline{X}_n}{s_n\\sqrt{1+n^{-1}}} \\sim T^{n-1}</math>\nSolving for <math>X_{n+1}</math> yields the prediction distribution\n:<math>\\overline{X}_n + s_n\\sqrt{1+n^{-1}} \\cdot T^{n-1}</math>\nfrom which one may compute predictive confidence intervals \u2013 given a probability ''p,'' one may compute intervals such that 100''p''% of the time, the next observation <math>X_{n+1}</math> will fall in that interval.\n\n==History==\n{{details|Student's t-test}}\nThe term \"''t''-statistic\" is abbreviated from \"hypothesis test statistic\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} In statistics, the t-distribution was first derived as a [[Posterior probability|posterior distribution]] in 1876 by [[Friedrich Robert Helmert|Helmert]]<ref>{{Citation|last=Szab\u00f3|first=Istv\u00e1n|title=Systeme aus einer endlichen Anzahl starrer K\u00f6rper|date=2003|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-61925-0_16|work=Einf\u00fchrung in die Technische Mechanik|pages=196\u2013199|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-540-13293-6|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schlyvitch|first=B.|date=October 1937|title=Untersuchungen \u00fcber den anastomotischen Kanal zwischen der Arteria coeliaca und mesenterica superior und damit in Zusammenhang stehende Fragen|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf02118337|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Anatomie und Entwicklungsgeschichte|volume=107|issue=6|pages=709\u2013737|doi=10.1007/bf02118337|issn=0340-2061}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Helmert|date=1876|title=Die Genauigkeit der Formel von Peters zur Berechnung des wahrscheinlichen Beobachtungsfehlers directer Beobachtungen gleicher Genauigkeit|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/asna.18760880802|journal=Astronomische Nachrichten|language=de|volume=88|issue=8-9|pages=113\u2013131|doi=10.1002/asna.18760880802}}</ref> and [[Jacob L\u00fcroth|L\u00fcroth]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=L\u00fcroth|first=J.|date=1876|title=Vergleichung von zwei Werthen des wahrscheinlichen Fehlers|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/asna.18760871402|journal=Astronomische Nachrichten|language=de|volume=87|issue=14|pages=209\u2013220|doi=10.1002/asna.18760871402}}</ref><ref>Pfanzagl J, Sheynin O (1996). \"Studies in the history of probability and statistics.

Kingston took note of Collette's use of physicality to convey her characters' emotions as in ''Emma'' and ''United States of Tara''. She remarked that Collette's acting method references the components of [[Stanislavski's system|Stanislavski\u2019s System of Acting]]. In studying Collette's typecasting as mothers, Kingston wrote, \"[Collette] selectively chooses roles of women and mothers which she can portray in ways that are multidimensional and different from another.\" She also wrote that Collette makes conscious efforts to break from the typecasting, with leading roles in films like ''Miss You Already'' and ''Lucky Them''. At the end of her analysis, Kingston concluded, \"Collette truly is a chameleon in both the versatility of her acting style and in the kind of roles she is willing to approach with a physicality-based method.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mcgillchannelundergraduatereview.com/2018/04/toni-collette-character-as-craft/|title=Toni Collette: Character as Craft \u2013 The Channel|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\n[[File:Toni Collette by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|236x236px|Collette at the 2015 [[San Diego Comic-Con|San Diego Comic Con]] promoting [[Krampus (film)|''Krampus'']] (2015)|alt=]]\n\nIn her twenties she found it difficult to adapt to being in the media spotlight and, as a result, struggled with [[Bulimia nervosa|bulimia]] and [[panic attack]]s.<ref name=\":1\" /> During this period she travelled extensively, shaved her head five times and bought a flat in [[Brixton]], London.

Gurnam Singh was tasked to fire this explosive charge under simulated battle conditions and was assisted by a party of seven sappers in this task.\n\nWhile Gurnam Singh was in the process of setting up and preparing the Charge Line Mine Clearing for firing, the tail initiator of the charge got prematurely actuated.

It was first staged on 31 October [[1614 in literature|1614]] at the [[Hope Theatre]] by the [[Lady Elizabeth's Men]] [[Playing company|company]].<ref>Gurr (1992, 233).</ref> Written four years after ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]'', five after ''[[Epicoene|Epic\u0153ne, or the Silent Woman]]'', and nine after ''[[Volpone]]'', it is in some respects the most experimental of these plays.<ref>Hibbard, p. xiv.</ref>\n\nThe play was first printed in [[1631 in literature|1631]], as part of a planned second volume of the first 1616 folio collection of Jonson's works, to be published by the bookseller [[Robert Allot]]\u2014though Jonson abandoned the plan when he became dissatisfied with the quality of the typesetting. Copies of the 1631 typecast were circulated, though whether they were sold publicly or distributed privately by Jonson is unclear. The play was published in the [[Ben Jonson folios|second folio]] of Jonson's works in 1640\u201341, published by [[Richard Meighen]].<ref>Jonson's original 1616 folio collection of his works was reprinted in 1640, a volume sometimes called the second edition of the first folio. Meighen's 1641 volume contained later Jonson pieces, including ''Bartholomew Fair''.</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe play is set at [[Bartholomew Fair]], which from 1133 to 1855 was one of London's preeminent summer fairs. It opened on 24 August each year at [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]], in the northwestern part of the city. Smithfield, a site of slaughterhouses and public executions, was a fitting place for a fair that was part commerce and part spectacle. At once a trading event for cloth and other goods and a pleasure fair, the four-day event drew crowds from all classes of English society.\n\nJonson's play uses this fair as the setting for an unusually detailed and diverse panorama of London life in the early seventeenth century. The one day of fair life represented in the play allows Jonson ample opportunity not just to conduct his plot but also to depict the vivid life of the fair, from pickpockets and bullies to justices and slumming gallants. Jonson also uses the characters that he creates as a way to comment on the social, religious and political conflicts of London society in Jacobean England.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe play begins with an extended bit of [[metafiction|metadrama]]; the company's stage-keeper enters, criticising the play about to be performed because it lacks romantic and fabulous elements. He is then pushed from the stage by the book-keeper, who (serving as prologue) announces a contract between author and audience. The contract appears to itemise Jonson's discontentment with his audiences: Members are not to find political satire where none is intended; they are not to take as oaths such innocuous phrases as \"God quit you\"; they are not to \"censure by contagion\", but must exercise their own judgment; moreover, they are allowed to judge only in proportion to the price of their ticket.  Perhaps most important, they agree not to expect a throwback to the sword-and-buckler age of Smithfield, for Jonson has given them a picture of the present and unromantic state of the fair.\n\nThe play proper begins with a proctor and amateur dramatist Littlewit and his friends, Quarlous and Winwife; they are plotting how to win Dame Purecraft (a widow, and Littlewit's mother-in-law) from Zeal-of-the-Land Busy, a canting, hypocritical Puritan.\n\nThis colloquy is interrupted by the entrance of Wasp, the irascible servant of Cokes, a country simpleton who is in town to marry Grace Wellborn. Grace is the ward of Adam Overdo, a Justice of the Peace; Overdo's wife is Cokes's sister. All of these characters are at Littlewit's to get a marriage license; having obtained it, they indulge Cokes's wish to visit the fair.\n\nLittlewit and his friends also plan to go to the fair to see a puppet-show Littlewit wrote. To overcome Busy's likely objections, they pretend that Win (Littlewit's wife) has a pregnant craving for roast pork. The Renaissance audience, familiar with stage satire of [[Puritan]]s, would not have been surprised that Busy, far from abhorring the fair and its debauchery, is ready to rationalise his presence there as allowable and even godly. The first act ends with both groups, the genteel Overdos and the raffish Littlewits, headed for the fair.\n\nThe fair propels these characters through experiences that put their social identities under extreme strain. Justice Overdo, well-read in the \"disguised prince\" tradition, assumes a disguise to ferret out wrongdoing at the fair; he is beaten by Wasp, falsely accused by Edgeworth, a cut-purse, and put in the [[stocks]]. Quarlous and Winwife engage Edgeworth to steal the marriage license from Wasp; he does so when Wasp is arrested after starting a fight. Wasp, too, is put in the stocks. Winwife has abandoned his plan to marry Dame Purecraft; instead, he and Quarlous fight for Grace's hand. Win Littlewit and Mistress Overdo are enlisted as prostitutes by the pimp Whit; Zeal-of-the-land Busy is arrested for preaching without license and put into the stocks. Cokes is robbed several times by Edgeworth and other denizens of the fair. All the imprisoned characters escape when Trouble-All, a seeming madman for whom Dame Purecraft has conceived a sudden passion, fights with the guards.\n\nThe climax of the play occurs at the puppet show. Madame Overdo and Win are brought in, masked, as prostitutes; Madame Overdo is drunk. Overdo is still in disguise, and Quarlous has disguised himself as Trouble-All; in this guise, he stole the marriage license from Winwife and made it into a license for himself and Purecraft. The puppet show, a burlesque of ''[[Hero and Leander]]'' and ''[[Pythias and Damon|Damon and Pythias]]'', proceeds until Busy interrupts, claiming that the play is an abomination because the actors are cross-dressed. The puppets refute him decisively by raising their clothes, revealing that they have no sex. Busy announces himself converted into a \"beholder\" of plays.\n\nAt this point, Justice Overdo reveals himself, intent on uncovering the \"enormities\" he has witnessed at the fair. He is in the process of punishing all of the various schemers and malefactors when his wife (still veiled) throws up and begins to call for him. Abashed, Overdo takes the advice of Quarlous and forgives all parties; Winwife marries Grace, Quarlous marries Purecraft, and all the characters are invited to Overdo's house for supper.\n\n==Puritans==\n{{See also|Antitheatricality#16th and 17th century}}\nZeal-of-the-land Busy is Jonson's second foray, after ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]''{{'}}s Tribulation and Ananais, into a field of satire common in Jacobean drama: satire against Puritans. Various factors combined to make the godly or \"precisians\" obvious targets of ridicule. Though religious violence was comparatively uncommon in Jacobean England, the memory of such violence was fresh enough to make marginal believers or outsiders potential sources of anxiety or threat.  This element of threat was especially notable in the second decade of James's reign, when the tenuous [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] consensus in the English Church began to disintegrate. In this context, stage attacks on the godly may have served to channel and release broader anxieties about social trends.\n\nPlaywrights also had a more immediate reason for this animosity; Puritans had opposed the public theatre almost from its inception. Hostility to drama was not, of course, limited to separatists or Puritans; preachers of all shades of belief denounced the plays as profane and the theatres as sites of theft, drunkenness, and licentiousness. Correctly or not, playwrights treated Puritans as the main source of these attacks. On stage, the Puritan is a hypocritical, judgmental, and long-winded figure, masking his lusts behind a vocal obsession with trivialities; Busy, for example, announces his intention to eat pork at the fair merely to refute the charges of \"Judaism\" he claims are levelled at Puritans, and he ends up consuming two whole pigs.\n\n==Performance history==\nThe induction allows for a more specific date of performance than is usual for Renaissance plays; the premi\u00e8re took place on 31 October 1614 at the [[Hope Theatre]] in [[Bankside]]. Entries in the [[Master of the Revels|Revels]] accounts indicate that the performance was repeated at [[Palace of Whitehall|Whitehall]] for [[James I of England|James I]] the next day. The royal account also lists ten [[pound (currency)|pounds]] paid to [[Nathan Field]] for acting in the play; in the fifth act, Jonson causes Cokes to ask the puppetmaster, \"Which is your best actor now...your [[Richard Burbage|Burbage]]...your Field?\"\n\nThere is no further record of performance until 1661, although it was likely to have remained in repertory to some degree until its anti-Puritan sentiments made it unwise to revive it. ([[William Oldys]] reports a traditional view that the inscription on Jonson's tomb (\"O rare Ben Jonson\") refers to the applause this play received, after the failure of ''[[Catiline]]'',<ref>Herford and Simpson, Vol. 1, p. 183.</ref> indicating some degree of popularity. [[Samuel Pepys]] records seeing it four times in 1661, twice with the puppet show and twice without (8 June 27 June, 31 August and 7 September 1661). The play appears to have been revived intermittently through the earlier part of the eighteenth century; after that, in keeping with the waning taste for non-Shakespearean Renaissance drama in general and for Jonson in particular, the play fell into obscurity. It retained a degree of esteem in the study even as it disappeared from the boards; both [[Isaac Reed]] and [[Horace Walpole]] praised its wealth of invention in their accounts of Renaissance drama. [[John Brown (essayist)|John Brown]] revised the play and offered it to [[David Garrick]]; Garrick refused it, however, and Brown's text is lost.\n\nAs with many long-ignored plays, ''Bartholomew Fair'' returned to the stage in a production by the Phoenix Society\u2014this one, in 1921 at [[the New Oxford Theatre]]. Its first professional revival came in 1949, when [[George Devine]] directed it at the [[Edinburgh International Festival]]; the next year, the same production appeared at the [[Old Vic]]. The puppets in this production were performed by [[George Speaight]]. The [[Bristol Old Vic]] produced the play in 1966.

Copies of the 1631 typecast were circulated, though whether they were sold publicly or distributed privately by Jonson is unclear. The play was published in the [[Ben Jonson folios|second folio]] of Jonson's works in 1640\u201341, published by [[Richard Meighen]].<ref>Jonson's original 1616 folio collection of his works was reprinted in 1640, a volume sometimes called the second edition of the first folio. Meighen's 1641 volume contained later Jonson pieces, including ''Bartholomew Fair''.</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe play is set at [[Bartholomew Fair]], which from 1133 to 1855 was one of London's preeminent summer fairs. It opened on 24 August each year at [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]], in the northwestern part of the city. Smithfield, a site of slaughterhouses and public executions, was a fitting place for a fair that was part commerce and part spectacle. At once a trading event for cloth and other goods and a pleasure fair, the four-day event drew crowds from all classes of English society.\n\nJonson's play uses this fair as the setting for an unusually detailed and diverse panorama of London life in the early seventeenth century. The one day of fair life represented in the play allows Jonson ample opportunity not just to conduct his plot but also to depict the vivid life of the fair, from pickpockets and bullies to justices and slumming gallants. Jonson also uses the characters that he creates as a way to comment on the social, religious and political conflicts of London society in Jacobean England.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe play begins with an extended bit of [[metafiction|metadrama]]; the company's stage-keeper enters, criticising the play about to be performed because it lacks romantic and fabulous elements. He is then pushed from the stage by the book-keeper, who (serving as prologue) announces a contract between author and audience. The contract appears to itemise Jonson's discontentment with his audiences: Members are not to find political satire where none is intended; they are not to take as oaths such innocuous phrases as \"God quit you\"; they are not to \"censure by contagion\", but must exercise their own judgment; moreover, they are allowed to judge only in proportion to the price of their ticket.  Perhaps most important, they agree not to expect a throwback to the sword-and-buckler age of Smithfield, for Jonson has given them a picture of the present and unromantic state of the fair.\n\nThe play proper begins with a proctor and amateur dramatist Littlewit and his friends, Quarlous and Winwife; they are plotting how to win Dame Purecraft (a widow, and Littlewit's mother-in-law) from Zeal-of-the-Land Busy, a canting, hypocritical Puritan.\n\nThis colloquy is interrupted by the entrance of Wasp, the irascible servant of Cokes, a country simpleton who is in town to marry Grace Wellborn. Grace is the ward of Adam Overdo, a Justice of the Peace; Overdo's wife is Cokes's sister. All of these characters are at Littlewit's to get a marriage license; having obtained it, they indulge Cokes's wish to visit the fair.\n\nLittlewit and his friends also plan to go to the fair to see a puppet-show Littlewit wrote. To overcome Busy's likely objections, they pretend that Win (Littlewit's wife) has a pregnant craving for roast pork. The Renaissance audience, familiar with stage satire of [[Puritan]]s, would not have been surprised that Busy, far from abhorring the fair and its debauchery, is ready to rationalise his presence there as allowable and even godly. The first act ends with both groups, the genteel Overdos and the raffish Littlewits, headed for the fair.\n\nThe fair propels these characters through experiences that put their social identities under extreme strain. Justice Overdo, well-read in the \"disguised prince\" tradition, assumes a disguise to ferret out wrongdoing at the fair; he is beaten by Wasp, falsely accused by Edgeworth, a cut-purse, and put in the [[stocks]]. Quarlous and Winwife engage Edgeworth to steal the marriage license from Wasp; he does so when Wasp is arrested after starting a fight. Wasp, too, is put in the stocks. Winwife has abandoned his plan to marry Dame Purecraft; instead, he and Quarlous fight for Grace's hand. Win Littlewit and Mistress Overdo are enlisted as prostitutes by the pimp Whit; Zeal-of-the-land Busy is arrested for preaching without license and put into the stocks. Cokes is robbed several times by Edgeworth and other denizens of the fair. All the imprisoned characters escape when Trouble-All, a seeming madman for whom Dame Purecraft has conceived a sudden passion, fights with the guards.\n\nThe climax of the play occurs at the puppet show. Madame Overdo and Win are brought in, masked, as prostitutes; Madame Overdo is drunk. Overdo is still in disguise, and Quarlous has disguised himself as Trouble-All; in this guise, he stole the marriage license from Winwife and made it into a license for himself and Purecraft. The puppet show, a burlesque of ''[[Hero and Leander]]'' and ''[[Pythias and Damon|Damon and Pythias]]'', proceeds until Busy interrupts, claiming that the play is an abomination because the actors are cross-dressed. The puppets refute him decisively by raising their clothes, revealing that they have no sex. Busy announces himself converted into a \"beholder\" of plays.\n\nAt this point, Justice Overdo reveals himself, intent on uncovering the \"enormities\" he has witnessed at the fair. He is in the process of punishing all of the various schemers and malefactors when his wife (still veiled) throws up and begins to call for him. Abashed, Overdo takes the advice of Quarlous and forgives all parties; Winwife marries Grace, Quarlous marries Purecraft, and all the characters are invited to Overdo's house for supper.\n\n==Puritans==\n{{See also|Antitheatricality#16th and 17th century}}\nZeal-of-the-land Busy is Jonson's second foray, after ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]''{{'}}s Tribulation and Ananais, into a field of satire common in Jacobean drama: satire against Puritans. Various factors combined to make the godly or \"precisians\" obvious targets of ridicule. Though religious violence was comparatively uncommon in Jacobean England, the memory of such violence was fresh enough to make marginal believers or outsiders potential sources of anxiety or threat.  This element of threat was especially notable in the second decade of James's reign, when the tenuous [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] consensus in the English Church began to disintegrate. In this context, stage attacks on the godly may have served to channel and release broader anxieties about social trends.\n\nPlaywrights also had a more immediate reason for this animosity; Puritans had opposed the public theatre almost from its inception. Hostility to drama was not, of course, limited to separatists or Puritans; preachers of all shades of belief denounced the plays as profane and the theatres as sites of theft, drunkenness, and licentiousness. Correctly or not, playwrights treated Puritans as the main source of these attacks. On stage, the Puritan is a hypocritical, judgmental, and long-winded figure, masking his lusts behind a vocal obsession with trivialities; Busy, for example, announces his intention to eat pork at the fair merely to refute the charges of \"Judaism\" he claims are levelled at Puritans, and he ends up consuming two whole pigs.\n\n==Performance history==\nThe induction allows for a more specific date of performance than is usual for Renaissance plays; the premi\u00e8re took place on 31 October 1614 at the [[Hope Theatre]] in [[Bankside]]. Entries in the [[Master of the Revels|Revels]] accounts indicate that the performance was repeated at [[Palace of Whitehall|Whitehall]] for [[James I of England|James I]] the next day. The royal account also lists ten [[pound (currency)|pounds]] paid to [[Nathan Field]] for acting in the play; in the fifth act, Jonson causes Cokes to ask the puppetmaster, \"Which is your best actor now...your [[Richard Burbage|Burbage]]...your Field?\"\n\nThere is no further record of performance until 1661, although it was likely to have remained in repertory to some degree until its anti-Puritan sentiments made it unwise to revive it. ([[William Oldys]] reports a traditional view that the inscription on Jonson's tomb (\"O rare Ben Jonson\") refers to the applause this play received, after the failure of ''[[Catiline]]'',<ref>Herford and Simpson, Vol. 1, p. 183.</ref> indicating some degree of popularity. [[Samuel Pepys]] records seeing it four times in 1661, twice with the puppet show and twice without (8 June 27 June, 31 August and 7 September 1661). The play appears to have been revived intermittently through the earlier part of the eighteenth century; after that, in keeping with the waning taste for non-Shakespearean Renaissance drama in general and for Jonson in particular, the play fell into obscurity. It retained a degree of esteem in the study even as it disappeared from the boards; both [[Isaac Reed]] and [[Horace Walpole]] praised its wealth of invention in their accounts of Renaissance drama. [[John Brown (essayist)|John Brown]] revised the play and offered it to [[David Garrick]]; Garrick refused it, however, and Brown's text is lost.\n\nAs with many long-ignored plays, ''Bartholomew Fair'' returned to the stage in a production by the Phoenix Society\u2014this one, in 1921 at [[the New Oxford Theatre]]. Its first professional revival came in 1949, when [[George Devine]] directed it at the [[Edinburgh International Festival]]; the next year, the same production appeared at the [[Old Vic]]. The puppets in this production were performed by [[George Speaight]]. The [[Bristol Old Vic]] produced the play in 1966. [[Terry Hands]] directed the play for the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] in 1969; this production included [[Ben Kingsley]] as Winwife and [[Helen Mirren]] as Win Littlewit. The production, which cut the long text and freely mixed period and modern properties, received generally negative reviews.  The play was also performed (some time in the 1960s) at the University of California, Berkeley, with Stacey Keach playing Overdo.\n\n[[Richard Eyre]] produced the play for the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]]; his first production as head of the theatre, it was performed on the Olivier Stage in mid-[[Victorian era|Victorian]] costume. [[David Bamber]], [[David Burke (British actor)|David Burke]], and [[Stephen Moore (actor)|Stephen Moore]] were among the cast.
