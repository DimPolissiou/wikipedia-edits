The municipality consists of two small towns: Saalbach and Hinterglemm, which each make up several ''Katastralgemeinden''.\n\n==History==\nThe oldest evidence of settlements in the municipality stems from 1222. The name ''Salpach'' first showed up in 1350. Before 1410 there was a church in the town.

Skiing can be found on both sides of the valley. The runs on the north side of the valley (south-facing side) tend to be preferred by visitors due to their sunny weather. The pistes on the south side of the valley (north-facing side) are normally in the shade, so have better snow cover, particularly in late season, as well as more trees. Much of the off piste skiing is found on the north side, where thigh-deep, untouched powder can be found only metres from many of the pistes. There is a small snowpark in Hinterglemm, but experienced snowboarders and skiers prefer to head to the snowpark in the adjacent valley in Leogang, which boasts superior kickers, as well as rails and jibs. Saalbach-Hinterglemm also features 6 and 8-man [[chairlifts]] with heated seats and retractable covers for use in bad weather.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Salzburgerland]]\n* [[Salzburg]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=\"Notes\"}}\n\n{{reflist}}\n* Weal, John (2003).

The region is a part of the [[Kitzb\u00fcheler Alpen]]. The highest point is [[Spielberghorn]] (2,044 m) in the north and [[Hochkogel]] (2,249 m) in the south. \n\n[[File:Hinterglemm from Zw\u00f6lferkogelbahn 2010-02-09.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Hinterglemm in February 2010.]]\nThe nearest large city is [[Zell am See]], located about 20&nbsp;km away.

(film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (1962)]]\n\nThe '''Joan Crawford filmography''' lists the film appearances of American actress '''[[Joan Crawford]]''', who starred in numerous [[feature film]]s throughout a lengthy career that spanned nearly five decades.\n\nShe made her film debut in ''[[Lady of the Night]]'' (1925) as a [[body double]] for film star [[Norma Shearer]]. She appeared in several other films before she made her major breakthrough playing [[Lon Chaney]]'s love interest in the 1927 [[horror film]] ''[[The Unknown (1927 film)|The Unknown]]''. Her major success in ''[[Our Dancing Daughters]]'' (1928) made her a popular [[flapper]] of the late 1920s. Her first sound film ''[[Untamed (1929 film)|Untamed]]'' (1929) was a critical and box office success.\n\nCrawford would become a highly popular actress throughout the 1930s, as a [[leading lady]] for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. She starred in a series of \"[[rags to riches|rags-to-riches]]\" films that were extremely popular during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era, most especially with women. Her popularity rivaled fellow MGM actresses, including [[Greta Garbo]], [[Norma Shearer]] and [[Jean Harlow]]. She appeared in eight movies with [[Clark Gable]], including romantic drama ''[[Possessed (1931 film)|Possessed]]'' (1931), musical film ''[[Dancing Lady]]'' (1933), romantic comedy ''[[Love on the Run (1936 film)|Love on the Run]]'' (1936) and romantic drama ''[[Strange Cargo (1940 film)|Strange Cargo]]'' (1940) among others.<!-- Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925)\nThe Merry Widow (1925)\nPossessed (1931)\nDance, Fools, Dance (1931)\nLaughing Sinners (1931)\nScreen Snapshots (1932)\nDancing Lady (1933)\nForsaking All Others (1934)\nChained (1934)\nLove on the Run (1936)\nStrange Cargo (1940)\nhttp://www.imdb.com/search/title?roles=nm0001076,nm0000022&title_type=feature,tv_episode,video,tv_movie,tv_special,mini_series,documentary,game,short\n --> In 1937, she was proclaimed the first \"Queen of the Movies\" by ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, but her popularity soon waned. After her films ''[[The Bride Wore Red]]'' (1937) and ''[[Mannequin (1937 film)|Mannequin]]'' (1938) proved to be expensive failures, in May 1938, Crawford \u2013 along with [[Greta Garbo]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Kay Francis]] and many others \u2013 was labeled [[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|box office poison]]; an actor whose \"box office draw is nil\".\n\nCrawford managed to make a comeback in the comedy ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939) opposite an all-star female only cast. On July 1, 1943, Crawford left MGM and signed an exclusive contract with [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]], where she became a rival of [[Bette Davis]]. After a slow start with the studio, she received critical and commercial acclaim for her performance in drama ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' (1945). The film earned her an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. From 1946 to 1952, Crawford appeared in a series of critical and box office successes, including the musical drama ''[[Humoresque (1946 film)|Humoresque]]'' (1946), film noirs ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947, for which she received a second Academy Award nomination) and ''[[Flamingo Road (film)|Flamingo Road]]'' (1949), drama ''[[The Damned Don't Cry]]'' (1950) and romantic comedy ''[[Goodbye, My Fancy]]'' (1951) among others. She received a third \u2013 and final \u2013 Academy Award nomination for her performance in the thriller ''[[Sudden Fear]]'' (1952).\n\nIn 1953, Crawford starred in the musical ''[[Torch Song (1953 film)|Torch Song]]'', her final film role for MGM. Her next film ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' (1954) although not a major hit, is one of Crawford's most popular films among her fans. During the latter half of the 1950s, Crawford starred in a series of [[B-movie]]s, including romantic dramas ''[[Female on the Beach]]'' (1955) and ''[[Autumn Leaves (film)|Autumn Leaves]]'' (1956). In 1962, Crawford was teamed with [[Bette Davis]] in a film adaptation of ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]''. The [[thriller film]] was a box office hit, and briefly revived Crawford's career. Her final film performance was in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[science fiction film]], ''[[Trog]]'' (1970).\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Feature films===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 100%;\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" background: #f9f9f9;\n|+ Silent films\n|- align=\"center\"\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Title\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Role\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Director\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Studio\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Lady of the Night]]'' || Double for [[Norma Shearer]]<ref name=\"uncredited\">Uncredited</ref> || [[Monta Bell]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Proud Flesh (film)|Proud Flesh]]'' || Party Guest<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[King Vidor]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[A Slave of Fashion]]''<sup>\u2021</sup> || Mannequin<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Hobart Henley]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Merry Widow (1925 film)|The Merry Widow]]'' || Ballroom Dancer<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Erich von Stroheim]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Pretty Ladies]]'' || Bobby, a Showgirl<ref name=\"lucille\" /> || [[Monta Bell]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Circle (1925 film)|The Circle]]'' || Young Lady Catherine<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Frank Borzage]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Midshipman]]'' || Extra<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Christy Cabanne]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Exquisite Sinner]]''<sup>\u2021</sup> || Extra<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Josef von Sternberg]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Big Parade]]'' || Extra<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[King Vidor]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925 film)|Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]'' || Chariot Race Spectator<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Fred Niblo]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Old Clothes]]'' || Mary Riley<ref name=\"lucille\">Credited as Lucille LeSueur</ref> || [[Edward F.

(film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (1962)]]\n\nThe '''Joan Crawford filmography''' lists the film appearances of American actress '''[[Joan Crawford]]''', who starred in numerous [[feature film]]s throughout a lengthy career that spanned nearly five decades.\n\nShe made her film debut in ''[[Lady of the Night]]'' (1925) as a [[body double]] for film star [[Norma Shearer]]. She appeared in several other films before she made her major breakthrough playing [[Lon Chaney]]'s love interest in the 1927 [[horror film]] ''[[The Unknown (1927 film)|The Unknown]]''. Her major success in ''[[Our Dancing Daughters]]'' (1928) made her a popular [[flapper]] of the late 1920s. Her first sound film ''[[Untamed (1929 film)|Untamed]]'' (1929) was a critical and box office success.\n\nCrawford would become a highly popular actress throughout the 1930s, as a [[leading lady]] for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. She starred in a series of \"[[rags to riches|rags-to-riches]]\" films that were extremely popular during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era, most especially with women. Her popularity rivaled fellow MGM actresses, including [[Greta Garbo]], [[Norma Shearer]] and [[Jean Harlow]]. She appeared in eight movies with [[Clark Gable]], including romantic drama ''[[Possessed (1931 film)|Possessed]]'' (1931), musical film ''[[Dancing Lady]]'' (1933), romantic comedy ''[[Love on the Run (1936 film)|Love on the Run]]'' (1936) and romantic drama ''[[Strange Cargo (1940 film)|Strange Cargo]]'' (1940) among others.<!-- Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925)\nThe Merry Widow (1925)\nPossessed (1931)\nDance, Fools, Dance (1931)\nLaughing Sinners (1931)\nScreen Snapshots (1932)\nDancing Lady (1933)\nForsaking All Others (1934)\nChained (1934)\nLove on the Run (1936)\nStrange Cargo (1940)\nhttp://www.imdb.com/search/title?roles=nm0001076,nm0000022&title_type=feature,tv_episode,video,tv_movie,tv_special,mini_series,documentary,game,short\n --> In 1937, she was proclaimed the first \"Queen of the Movies\" by ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, but her popularity soon waned. After her films ''[[The Bride Wore Red]]'' (1937) and ''[[Mannequin (1937 film)|Mannequin]]'' (1938) proved to be expensive failures, in May 1938, Crawford \u2013 along with [[Greta Garbo]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Kay Francis]] and many others \u2013 was labeled [[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|box office poison]]; an actor whose \"box office draw is nil\".\n\nCrawford managed to make a comeback in the comedy ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939) opposite an all-star female only cast. On July 1, 1943, Crawford left MGM and signed an exclusive contract with [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]], where she became a rival of [[Bette Davis]]. After a slow start with the studio, she received critical and commercial acclaim for her performance in drama ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' (1945). The film earned her an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. From 1946 to 1952, Crawford appeared in a series of critical and box office successes, including the musical drama ''[[Humoresque (1946 film)|Humoresque]]'' (1946), film noirs ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947, for which she received a second Academy Award nomination) and ''[[Flamingo Road (film)|Flamingo Road]]'' (1949), drama ''[[The Damned Don't Cry]]'' (1950) and romantic comedy ''[[Goodbye, My Fancy]]'' (1951) among others. She received a third \u2013 and final \u2013 Academy Award nomination for her performance in the thriller ''[[Sudden Fear]]'' (1952).\n\nIn 1953, Crawford starred in the musical ''[[Torch Song (1953 film)|Torch Song]]'', her final film role for MGM. Her next film ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' (1954) although not a major hit, is one of Crawford's most popular films among her fans. During the latter half of the 1950s, Crawford starred in a series of [[B-movie]]s, including romantic dramas ''[[Female on the Beach]]'' (1955) and ''[[Autumn Leaves (film)|Autumn Leaves]]'' (1956). In 1962, Crawford was teamed with [[Bette Davis]] in a film adaptation of ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]''. The [[thriller film]] was a box office hit, and briefly revived Crawford's career. Her final film performance was in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[science fiction film]], ''[[Trog]]'' (1970).\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Feature films===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 100%;\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" background: #f9f9f9;\n|+ Silent films\n|- align=\"center\"\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Title\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Role\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Director\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Studio\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Lady of the Night]]'' || Double for [[Norma Shearer]]<ref name=\"uncredited\">Uncredited</ref> || [[Monta Bell]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Proud Flesh (film)|Proud Flesh]]'' || Party Guest<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[King Vidor]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[A Slave of Fashion]]''<sup>\u2021</sup> || Mannequin<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Hobart Henley]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Merry Widow (1925 film)|The Merry Widow]]'' || Ballroom Dancer<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Erich von Stroheim]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Pretty Ladies]]'' || Bobby, a Showgirl<ref name=\"lucille\" /> || [[Monta Bell]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Circle (1925 film)|The Circle]]'' || Young Lady Catherine<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Frank Borzage]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Midshipman]]'' || Extra<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Christy Cabanne]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Exquisite Sinner]]''<sup>\u2021</sup> || Extra<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Josef von Sternberg]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Big Parade]]'' || Extra<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[King Vidor]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925 film)|Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]'' || Chariot Race Spectator<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Fred Niblo]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Old Clothes]]'' || Mary Riley<ref name=\"lucille\">Credited as Lucille LeSueur</ref> || [[Edward F.
