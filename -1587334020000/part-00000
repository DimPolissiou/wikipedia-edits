The club is based in [[Ostend]] and was founded in 1970. The club competes in the top [[Pro Basketball League]] (PBL). Oostende is the most successful basketball club in Belgian history, as the club's honour list includes a record twenty-one [[Ethias League|Belgian League]] championships, a record nineteen [[Belgian Basketball Cup|Belgian Cup]]s and eleven [[Belgian Basketball Supercup|Belgian Supercups]].\n\n==History==\nThe club was founded on May 25, 1970 and started playing as ''Sunair Oostende''. The team colors were blue and yellow. ''BCO'' \u2013 a nickname of the club \u2013 started in the Belgian Second Division but promoted in its first season after it took the title. But in the [[Ethias League|First Division]] the team relegated immediately. But BCO bounced back and promoted once again and got its final spot in the First Division, as they never relegated since.\n\nIn the 1974\u201375 season the club made its first appearance in [[Europe]], when it played 10 games in the [[Kora\u0107 Cup]]. In 1979 the first trophy was won by Oostende: the [[Belgian Basketball Cup]] with Ron Adams as head coach. In 1981 the first national title became a fact for BC Oostende, Roger Dutremble was head coach. The club eventually won 6th straight titles in a row in Belgium. In 1988 the club won the first and only [[BeNeLux Cup]].\n\nBefore the 1999\u20132000 season the club got its first name change, as the name of the club became ''Telindus Oostende'', which referred to the new main sponsor. After the club won some more trophies to add to its honour list, the club got a new arena in the [[Sleuyter Arena|Sea'rena]] \u2013 that was named the Sleuyter Arena after one season<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/article/detail.aspx?articleid=GI010PO65 |title=Sea'rena wordt omgedoopt tot Sleuyter Arena |work=Nieuwsblad.be |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10}}</ref> and had a capacity of 5,000 people \u2013 in 2005.\n\n===Nine consecutive championships (2011\u20132020)===\n[[File:BCO Logo.png|250px|thumb|right|The original BCO logo, used during the 2017\u201318 season]]\nBefore the start of the 2010\u201311 season the club name was changed in ''Telenet (BC) Oostende''.

The club is based in [[Ostend]] and was founded in 1970. The club competes in the top [[Pro Basketball League]] (PBL). Oostende is the most successful basketball club in Belgian history, as the club's honour list includes a record twenty-one [[Ethias League|Belgian League]] championships, a record nineteen [[Belgian Basketball Cup|Belgian Cup]]s and eleven [[Belgian Basketball Supercup|Belgian Supercups]].\n\n==History==\nThe club was founded on May 25, 1970 and started playing as ''Sunair Oostende''. The team colors were blue and yellow. ''BCO'' \u2013 a nickname of the club \u2013 started in the Belgian Second Division but promoted in its first season after it took the title. But in the [[Ethias League|First Division]] the team relegated immediately. But BCO bounced back and promoted once again and got its final spot in the First Division, as they never relegated since.\n\nIn the 1974\u201375 season the club made its first appearance in [[Europe]], when it played 10 games in the [[Kora\u0107 Cup]]. In 1979 the first trophy was won by Oostende: the [[Belgian Basketball Cup]] with Ron Adams as head coach. In 1981 the first national title became a fact for BC Oostende, Roger Dutremble was head coach. The club eventually won 6th straight titles in a row in Belgium. In 1988 the club won the first and only [[BeNeLux Cup]].\n\nBefore the 1999\u20132000 season the club got its first name change, as the name of the club became ''Telindus Oostende'', which referred to the new main sponsor. After the club won some more trophies to add to its honour list, the club got a new arena in the [[Sleuyter Arena|Sea'rena]] \u2013 that was named the Sleuyter Arena after one season<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/article/detail.aspx?articleid=GI010PO65 |title=Sea'rena wordt omgedoopt tot Sleuyter Arena |work=Nieuwsblad.be |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10}}</ref> and had a capacity of 5,000 people \u2013 in 2005.\n\n===Nine consecutive championships (2011\u20132020)===\n[[File:BCO Logo.png|250px|thumb|right|The original BCO logo, used during the 2017\u201318 season]]\nBefore the start of the 2010\u201311 season the club name was changed in ''Telenet (BC) Oostende''.

He was opposed by Sgt. Gardner Grayle and the Atomic Knights, who wore medieval suits of armor that were impervious to the Baron's energy weapons, the armor having been irradiated in the war.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |title=The Atomic Knights |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/atomic_k.htm |website=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref> The other Knights were twins Wayne and Hollis Hobard, Bryndon Smith, the last scientist left on Earth, and brother and sister Douglas and Marene Herald.

Hercules, [[Kamandi]], and the Atomic Knights all inhabited the same comics universe, one in which the [[Great Disaster]] had taken place (references to 1986 became less and less frequent as that date actually approached). ''Crisis on Infinite Earths: Absolute Edition'' had ''two'' Great Disaster realities: Earth-86 (where the Great Disaster was an atomic war) and Earth-295 (where the Great Disaster was natural).  Since the Great Disaster on Earth-295 was natural that reality had no Atomic Knights.\n\nThe entire Great Disaster concept has since been declared to be out-of-continuity in the current DC Universe, although one of the Post-52 alternate Earths (Earth-17) ''does'' feature the world of the Great Disaster. ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #57 attempted to [[retcon]] the Atomic Knights by 'revealing' them to be the dream of Gardner Grayle in a state of suspended animation (during which dream Superman attempts to prevent Grayle from causing a nuclear war). This story is not held to be canon in terms of the Earth of the Great Disaster, and little reference has been made to it after publication.\n\nThe 15 Atomic Knights stories were reprinted in ''Strange Adventures'' #217-231. In 2010 they were collected into a single DC [[hardcover]] volume; their appearances in ''Hercules Unbound'' and ''DC Comics Presents'' had not been reprinted until a 2014 volume entitled ''Showcase Presents The Great Disaster Featuring the Atomic Knights.''\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Gardner Grayle===\n{{Superherobox\n|image=Atomicknight.png\n|image_size=175\n|caption=Atomic Knight '''Gardner Grayle'''\n|real_name=Gardner Grayle\n|publisher=[[DC Comics]]\n|debut=''Strange Adventures'' #117 (June 1960)\n|creators=[[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]]<br>[[Murphy Anderson]]\n|alliances=Atomic Knights<br>[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]<br>[[Forgotten Heroes]]<br>[[Seven Soldiers of Victory]]\n|aliases=[[Shining Knight]]\n|powers=Precognition<br>Wears a suit of armor granting enhanced strength, speed, endurance and blasts of energy, as well as being adaptable to other technology\n}}\nOn Earth-One, '''Gardner Grayle''' was a [[sergeant]] in the army. His platoon was the infamous Platoon 13 and its symbol was a knight. Feverishly opposed to nuclear war, Grayle volunteered for a virtual reality experiment to see how people would react to a post-atomic war world. Within this experiment, Grayle believed that the adventures of the Atomic Knights were only a dream. After emerging from the experiment, Grayle donned a [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] battle suit and declared himself a modern knight in shining armor, briefly becoming the second [[Shining Knight]] and serving with the [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]].<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nAfter a mildly successful career as a superhero, Grayle took a job at S.T.A.R.

There are roughly 125 Atomic Knights, with the main Knights being Grayle, Marene and Doug Herald, Bryndon, and Wayne and Hollis Hobard (based on the original group from the 1960s), who are shown posing as refugees with the help of advanced cloaking technology, and using armor with numerous powers including the ability to record and analyze complex data and fire powerful ballistic and nuclear blasts. At the end of the series, [[Captain Atom]] obliterates the remains of Bl\u00fcdhaven, making way for the departure of S.H.A.D.E. operatives.

Hercules, [[Kamandi]], and the Atomic Knights all inhabited the same comics universe, one in which the [[Great Disaster]] had taken place (references to 1986 became less and less frequent as that date actually approached). ''Crisis on Infinite Earths: Absolute Edition'' had ''two'' Great Disaster realities: Earth-86 (where the Great Disaster was an atomic war) and Earth-295 (where the Great Disaster was natural).  Since the Great Disaster on Earth-295 was natural that reality had no Atomic Knights.\n\nThe entire Great Disaster concept has since been declared to be out-of-continuity in the current DC Universe, although one of the Post-52 alternate Earths (Earth-17) ''does'' feature the world of the Great Disaster. ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #57 attempted to [[retcon]] the Atomic Knights by 'revealing' them to be the dream of Gardner Grayle in a state of suspended animation (during which dream Superman attempts to prevent Grayle from causing a nuclear war). This story is not held to be canon in terms of the Earth of the Great Disaster, and little reference has been made to it after publication.\n\nThe 15 Atomic Knights stories were reprinted in ''Strange Adventures'' #217-231. In 2010 they were collected into a single DC [[hardcover]] volume; their appearances in ''Hercules Unbound'' and ''DC Comics Presents'' had not been reprinted until a 2014 volume entitled ''Showcase Presents The Great Disaster Featuring the Atomic Knights.''\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Gardner Grayle===\n{{Superherobox\n|image=Atomicknight.png\n|image_size=175\n|caption=Atomic Knight '''Gardner Grayle'''\n|real_name=Gardner Grayle\n|publisher=[[DC Comics]]\n|debut=''Strange Adventures'' #117 (June 1960)\n|creators=[[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]]<br>[[Murphy Anderson]]\n|alliances=Atomic Knights<br>[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]<br>[[Forgotten Heroes]]<br>[[Seven Soldiers of Victory]]\n|aliases=[[Shining Knight]]\n|powers=Precognition<br>Wears a suit of armor granting enhanced strength, speed, endurance and blasts of energy, as well as being adaptable to other technology\n}}\nOn Earth-One, '''Gardner Grayle''' was a [[sergeant]] in the army. His platoon was the infamous Platoon 13 and its symbol was a knight. Feverishly opposed to nuclear war, Grayle volunteered for a virtual reality experiment to see how people would react to a post-atomic war world. Within this experiment, Grayle believed that the adventures of the Atomic Knights were only a dream. After emerging from the experiment, Grayle donned a [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] battle suit and declared himself a modern knight in shining armor, briefly becoming the second [[Shining Knight]] and serving with the [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]].<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nAfter a mildly successful career as a superhero, Grayle took a job at S.T.A.R. When he received a premonition from the goddess Cassandra, Grayle proceeded to use his new technical know-how to build his atomic armor.
