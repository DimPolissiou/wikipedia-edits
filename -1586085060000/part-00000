{"title_page": "Jonathan L", "text_new": "{{BLP sources|date=February 2019}}\n[[File:Jonathan L.jpg|right|Radiomoderator]]\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Jonathan l.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Jonathan L in the KUPD studios.|Jonathan L in the KUPD studios.]] -->\n'''Jonathan Leigh Rosen''' (born December 5, 1946 in [[Flatbush, Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]]), better known by his radio handle Jonathan L, is an American radio [[deejay]], [[Radio programming|programmer]], and [[Mass media|entertainment media]] publisher. He organized his first large [[music festival]] for alternative station KUKQ in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] in 1989, years before the launch of festivals like [[Lollapalooza]] and the [[KROQ Weenie Roast]]s. For this reason, he is often called the \"father of all radio festivals.\"\n==History==\nJonathan L left his parents' [[Long Island]] home at age 14 and lived as a [[street urchin]] with a gang of juveniles. After quitting school and being convicted of [[assault]] charges, he spent three years incarcerated in various juvenile institutions. He was out and on [[parole]] shortly before his 18th birthday, and took a job as a parts man for [[Mack Trucks]]. He also began writing for an [[underground newspaper]] in Long Island called ''The Express''.\n\nIn 1973, Jonathan L left New York and headed for [[Berkeley, California]]. He fell ill when he and his wife stopped to visit friends in [[Tucson, Arizona]], and they ended up staying there for the next thirteen years. He began self-publishing a monthly [[popular culture|pop culture]] magazine called ''Newsreal''. The publication was known for its eclectic mix of music artists, putting such stars as [[Joan Jett]] and [[B.B. King]] on the same cover. Begun in 1974, ''Newsreal''\u2019s circulation reached 20,000 before the publication folded in 1985.\n\nWhile on a summer hiatus in 1978 in [[New York City]], Jonathan L was the editor for two issues of ''Drugs & Paraphernalia Digest'', with the former publisher of ''[[High Times]]'' magazine.\n\n==Career in Radio==\nJonathan L's radio career began in March, 1982 in Tucson, Arizona at 96 Rock [[KLPX]] with his creation, \"Virgin Vinyl.\" The show ran for more than four years on Sunday evenings for five hours from 7 p.m. to midnight. Among the many live guests were [[Henry Rollins]] as a co-host, [[Joey Ramone]], [[The Circle Jerks]], [[Huey Lewis]], and [[the Meat Puppets]]. The music encompassed everything from [[Metallica]] to [[Leon Russell]].\n\nIn the summer of 1986, Jonathan moved up to [[Mesa, Arizona]] to start up alternative station KEYX 100.3 with his friend John \"Johnny D\" Dixon, referred to as \"the key to your musical future.\" The station ended in late 1987. Many felt it was far too ahead of its time. Jonathan was the assistant program director and [[music director]], and held down the 7 p.m. to midnight shift Monday though Friday.\n\nIn 1988, Jonathan L was hired by Phoenix rock station 98 KUPD, where he hosted \"Virgin Vinyl\" on Sunday nights until 1992. The show, which included everything from [[Suicidal Tendencies]] to a then-unheard band named [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], was a huge hit in Phoenix, and garnered several \"Best Radio Show\" awards from the ''[[Phoenix New Times]]'', which called Jonathan L \"a thoroughly modern mouthpiece\" who played \"forward-looking wax attacks.\" <ref>3.Phoenix New Times, February 17\u201323, 1988</ref> In 1986, they wrote of \"Virgin Vinyl\": \"When this colorful Sunday night waxfest was imported from Tucson this year, it slapped the lethargic Phoenix radio market right in the face.\"<ref>4.Phoenix New Times: Best of Phoenix, 1986</ref> Simultaneously in 1989, Jonathan L founded and became program director for KUKQ AM, Phoenix's first all-alternative music station.\n\nHe left KUKQ in 1992 to work for station [[KFMA]] in [[Wickenburg, Arizona]]. After a short stint there, he returned to KUKQ to retake over the helm as program director and again did his show \"Virgin Vinyl\" until he left in 1993 to join Phoenix station [[KDKB]], where he did his award-winning \"Virgin Vinyl\" until 1995.<ref>3.Phoenix New Times, February 17\u201323, 1988</ref>\n\nBy the late \u201890s, Jonathan L was considered a national go-to guy for alternative radio, and in a 1996 interview with New York Now, he rightly predicted \"more British and rhythm-driven music shaking up the mid-90s cabal of American-born alterna-rock bands.\" <ref>7.New York Now, November 11, 1996, by Jim Farber</ref>\n\nHe once again returned to KUKQ from mid-1994 to mid-1995<ref>6.R & R, February 5, 1993</ref> to run the station in its wildest [[punk rock]] form. Among his most popular programs was \"The Monday Morning Music Meeting Live,\" which gave listeners a chance to phone in and provide their own input on the music, which was added to the rotation that day.<ref>5.The Arizona Republic, August 29, 1994, by Julie Newberg</ref>\n\nIn August 2005, Jonathan L returned once again to 98 KUPD, where he hosted and programmed \"The Lopsided World of L\" on Saturday mornings and Sunday nights in prime time live. Jonathan L remained there until his [[retirement]] from stateside radio in 2010.\n\n==Album Network Years==\nIn the fall of 1995, Rosen left Phoenix (and radio) to accept an opportunity to become senior editor of the long time, now defunct, music industry trade publication the Album Network. He took control of \"Virtually Alternative\" magazine, one of many music format magazines the Album Network published.\n\nThe monthly was not only informative, but tongue-in-cheek, which Jonathan felt was a must for radio programmers. At the same time, Rosen wrote a weekly column in Album Network, \"Pleasantly Annoying\", a phrase that he has become well known for in both publishing and radio.\n\nRadio wasn't gone totally during his tenure. Through the Album Network's radio syndication he was asked to host radio specials for [[The Cranberries]], [[Social Distortion]], [[Kula Shaker]], and [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] that were run by radio stations throughout the United States. The aggressive mouthpiece of alternative radio was asked to moderate panels at music industry conventions, as he had done before back in the 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nIn 2000, at a convention Album Network put on in New York city dubbed Y2K, Jonathan organized and hosted a panel of musicians to speak about everything from their careers to their personal lives in front of a packed house. The guest speakers were [[Ronnie Spector]] (The Ronettes), [[Glenn Danzig]] (Danzig), and [[Dee Snider]] (Twisted Sister). Jonathan was friends with Spector and Danzig, and thought they had more appeal and more to offer than many of the available alternative artists of that time period. [[Joey Ramone]], also a friend, was the confirmed 4th panelist, but fell ill and couldn't make it.\n\nIn 1999, Jonathan was given Vice President stripes as SFX (and later [[Clear Channel Communications|Clear Channel]]) bought the Album Network and all its properties.\n\nAfter more than six and a half years, Rosen left the Network Magazine Group in 2002 to launch his own independent record promotion company which he operated until 2005. In the summer of that year, Rosen decided to leave [[Los Angeles]] and go back to radio, this time to do \"Lopsided World Of L\" at KUPD-FM in Phoenix.\n\n==Music Festivals==\nIn 1989, Jonathan L organized one of the first large-scale radio festivals in the [[United States]], for KUKQ. The bill included the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] and [[Camper Van Beethoven]]. Subsequent KUKQ festivals (there were two each year) included artists like [[Social Distortion]] and The Meat Puppets (1990), [[Mojo Nixon]] and [[Dead Milkmen]] (1990), and [[Rollins Band]] and [[The Sugarcubes]] (1992). His festivals received national recognition in 1991, when MTV filmed its popular [[alternative music]] show ''120 Minutes'' at that year's KUKQ Q-Fest, which included [[Front 242]] and [[The Sisters of Mercy]].\n\n==Internet and Television==\nIn addition to his work on [[terrestrial radio]], Jonathan L has also hosted several [[Internet radio]] shows, including a two-hour special for WOXY in [[Cincinnati]] in 2003, which included an on-air phone call from Jonathan L's close friend, music legend [[Ronnie Spector]]. In 2000, Jonathan L hosted and programmed the weekly Sunday afternoon show \"Pleasantly Annoying\" for [[Hollywood, California]]-based SpikeRadio.com.\n\nJonathan L appeared on ''[[A Current Affair (U.S. TV series)|A Current Affair]]'' with [[Maury Povich]] in 1991, where he interviewed One Foot In The Grave, \"the world\u2019s oldest punk rock band,\" a group from [[Sun City, Arizona]] with members all over the age of 60. In 2001, Jonathan L appeared on [[MTV2]] in a 23-minute video feature about German rock group [[Rammstein]].\n\n==The Berlin Years==\n\nIn April 2010 Rosen moved to [[Berlin, Germany]] to be with the one true love he ever felt. He and Gaby at first were just pen pals \nmeeting on Myspace in 2005. After a visit to Berlin in September 2009 to meet her in person he decided he knew what his future \nwould be. At the age of 63 he moved permantantly to Berlin. In September 2010 the couple flew to [[Las Vegas]] and were married at the famous [[Little White Chapel]].\n\nFor the first few months he tried to secure opportunities for a live radio gig. He was unsuccessful mainly due to not being able to speak German. \nSo he decided to try and master recording his Lopsided World Of L from their flat in [[Neuk\u00f6lln]], the largest sector in the western part of Berlin.\n\nBack in 2007 when he was doing the show live on 98 KUPD FM in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] the radio station starting streaming anywhere in the world.\nJonathan had already made many friends and contacts from [[Europe]] and other countries and was promoting the show on Myspace. \nHe used those contacts and new ones he made on Facebook in hope that if he was to use the internet, maybe that would give the show an edge and garner new listeners.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2014 he spent the better part of three years going to school three nights a week to learn the [[German language]].\n\nThen the break came in October 2010 when [[Los Angeles]] station Indie1031 asked him on. That was followed in December 2010 by German internet station KING FM also wanted Lopsided World Of L which was followed by Phoenix, Arizona's KWSS FM 93.9 and others from [[Greece]], [[Romania]] and [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]] (the latter\nthree are no longer on-air). The show lasted five years on KING FM until the station went dark\n\nSome of the stations have gone away due to crucial problems inherent due to a lack of advertising and for some personal reasons.\n\nSince then Mersey Radio [[Liverpool, England]], andHow FM 107.5 [[New Zealand]], KFMA Rock1021 FM [[Tucson, Arizona]], and Radio Lantau [[Hong Kong]] joined in bringing the award-winning show to listeners all around the world on various continents.\n\nAlthough on a few FM stations, the show is the most known radio show on the internet for years. Took a few years to get to that status.\n\nAs Mr. L says ''\"I just continue to do what I do for all the musicians that are mostly unknown and what I get out of all the work is keeping active at my age for what I love and do the best\"''.\n\nAs the years go by he made many contacts directly with musicians and record promoters from so many Countries that the show is mostly music that American stations and \u2019Specialty Show\u2019s\u2019 do not play. He feels that sets Lopsided World Of L apart from all the others.\n\nIn describing the show he feels nowadays that is not an \u2018Alternative\u2019 one but more of a progressive free form entity in all styles of music featuring new artists and many older ones that re-enter with new music.\n\n==International Awards and Nominations==\n===At Worldwide Radio Summit in Los Angeles===\n\n* 2014 Nominated \"International Radio Personality\"\n* 2015 Nominated \"International Radio Personality\"\n* 2015 Won \"International Radio Personality\"\n* 2017 Nominated \"International Radio Personality\"\n* 2017 Won \"International Radio Personality\"\n\n<gallery widths=\"120\" heights=\"300\" perrow=\"4\" >\n Jonathan L.

He organized his first large [[music festival]] for alternative station KUKQ in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] in 1989, years before the launch of festivals like [[Lollapalooza]] and the [[KROQ Weenie Roast]]s. For this reason, he is often called the \"father of all radio festivals.\"\n==History==\nJonathan L left his parents' [[Long Island]] home at age 14 and lived as a [[street urchin]] with a gang of juveniles. After quitting school and being convicted of [[assault]] charges, he spent three years incarcerated in various juvenile institutions. He was out and on [[parole]] shortly before his 18th birthday, and took a job as a parts man for [[Mack Trucks]]. He also began writing for an [[underground newspaper]] in Long Island called ''The Express''.\n\nIn 1973, Jonathan L left New York and headed for [[Berkeley, California]]. He fell ill when he and his wife stopped to visit friends in [[Tucson, Arizona]], and they ended up staying there for the next thirteen years. He began self-publishing a monthly [[popular culture|pop culture]] magazine called ''Newsreal''. The publication was known for its eclectic mix of music artists, putting such stars as [[Joan Jett]] and [[B.B. King]] on the same cover. Begun in 1974, ''Newsreal''\u2019s circulation reached 20,000 before the publication folded in 1985.\n\nWhile on a summer hiatus in 1978 in [[New York City]], Jonathan L was the editor for two issues of ''Drugs & Paraphernalia Digest'', with the former publisher of ''[[High Times]]'' magazine.\n\n==Career in Radio==\nJonathan L's radio career began in March, 1982 in Tucson, Arizona at 96 Rock [[KLPX]] with his creation, \"Virgin Vinyl.\" The show ran for more than four years on Sunday evenings for five hours from 7 p.m. to midnight. Among the many live guests were [[Henry Rollins]] as a co-host, [[Joey Ramone]], [[The Circle Jerks]], [[Huey Lewis]], and [[the Meat Puppets]]. The music encompassed everything from [[Metallica]] to [[Leon Russell]].\n\nIn the summer of 1986, Jonathan moved up to [[Mesa, Arizona]] to start up alternative station KEYX 100.3 with his friend John \"Johnny D\" Dixon, referred to as \"the key to your musical future.\" The station ended in late 1987. Many felt it was far too ahead of its time. Jonathan was the assistant program director and [[music director]], and held down the 7 p.m. to midnight shift Monday though Friday.\n\nIn 1988, Jonathan L was hired by Phoenix rock station 98 KUPD, where he hosted \"Virgin Vinyl\" on Sunday nights until 1992. The show, which included everything from [[Suicidal Tendencies]] to a then-unheard band named [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], was a huge hit in Phoenix, and garnered several \"Best Radio Show\" awards from the ''[[Phoenix New Times]]'', which called Jonathan L \"a thoroughly modern mouthpiece\" who played \"forward-looking wax attacks.\" <ref>3.Phoenix New Times, February 17\u201323, 1988</ref> In 1986, they wrote of \"Virgin Vinyl\": \"When this colorful Sunday night waxfest was imported from Tucson this year, it slapped the lethargic Phoenix radio market right in the face.\"<ref>4.Phoenix New Times: Best of Phoenix, 1986</ref> Simultaneously in 1989, Jonathan L founded and became program director for KUKQ AM, Phoenix's first all-alternative music station.\n\nHe left KUKQ in 1992 to work for station [[KFMA]] in [[Wickenburg, Arizona]]. After a short stint there, he returned to KUKQ to retake over the helm as program director and again did his show \"Virgin Vinyl\" until he left in 1993 to join Phoenix station [[KDKB]], where he did his award-winning \"Virgin Vinyl\" until 1995.<ref>3.Phoenix New Times, February 17\u201323, 1988</ref>\n\nBy the late \u201890s, Jonathan L was considered a national go-to guy for alternative radio, and in a 1996 interview with New York Now, he rightly predicted \"more British and rhythm-driven music shaking up the mid-90s cabal of American-born alterna-rock bands.\" <ref>7.New York Now, November 11, 1996, by Jim Farber</ref>\n\nHe once again returned to KUKQ from mid-1994 to mid-1995<ref>6.R & R, February 5, 1993</ref> to run the station in its wildest [[punk rock]] form. Among his most popular programs was \"The Monday Morning Music Meeting Live,\" which gave listeners a chance to phone in and provide their own input on the music, which was added to the rotation that day.<ref>5.The Arizona Republic, August 29, 1994, by Julie Newberg</ref>\n\nIn August 2005, Jonathan L returned once again to 98 KUPD, where he hosted and programmed \"The Lopsided World of L\" on Saturday mornings and Sunday nights in prime time live. Jonathan L remained there until his [[retirement]] from stateside radio in 2010.\n\n==Album Network Years==\nIn the fall of 1995, Rosen left Phoenix (and radio) to accept an opportunity to become senior editor of the long time, now defunct, music industry trade publication the Album Network. He took control of \"Virtually Alternative\" magazine, one of many music format magazines the Album Network published.\n\nThe monthly was not only informative, but tongue-in-cheek, which Jonathan felt was a must for radio programmers. At the same time, Rosen wrote a weekly column in Album Network, \"Pleasantly Annoying\", a phrase that he has become well known for in both publishing and radio.\n\nRadio wasn't gone totally during his tenure. Through the Album Network's radio syndication he was asked to host radio specials for [[The Cranberries]], [[Social Distortion]], [[Kula Shaker]], and [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] that were run by radio stations throughout the United States. The aggressive mouthpiece of alternative radio was asked to moderate panels at music industry conventions, as he had done before back in the 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nIn 2000, at a convention Album Network put on in New York city dubbed Y2K, Jonathan organized and hosted a panel of musicians to speak about everything from their careers to their personal lives in front of a packed house. The guest speakers were [[Ronnie Spector]] (The Ronettes), [[Glenn Danzig]] (Danzig), and [[Dee Snider]] (Twisted Sister). Jonathan was friends with Spector and Danzig, and thought they had more appeal and more to offer than many of the available alternative artists of that time period. [[Joey Ramone]], also a friend, was the confirmed 4th panelist, but fell ill and couldn't make it.\n\nIn 1999, Jonathan was given Vice President stripes as SFX (and later [[Clear Channel Communications|Clear Channel]]) bought the Album Network and all its properties.\n\nAfter more than six and a half years, Rosen left the Network Magazine Group in 2002 to launch his own independent record promotion company which he operated until 2005. In the summer of that year, Rosen decided to leave [[Los Angeles]] and go back to radio, this time to do \"Lopsided World Of L\" at KUPD-FM in Phoenix.\n\n==Music Festivals==\nIn 1989, Jonathan L organized one of the first large-scale radio festivals in the [[United States]], for KUKQ. The bill included the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] and [[Camper Van Beethoven]]. Subsequent KUKQ festivals (there were two each year) included artists like [[Social Distortion]] and The Meat Puppets (1990), [[Mojo Nixon]] and [[Dead Milkmen]] (1990), and [[Rollins Band]] and [[The Sugarcubes]] (1992). His festivals received national recognition in 1991, when MTV filmed its popular [[alternative music]] show ''120 Minutes'' at that year's KUKQ Q-Fest, which included [[Front 242]] and [[The Sisters of Mercy]].\n\n==Internet and Television==\nIn addition to his work on [[terrestrial radio]], Jonathan L has also hosted several [[Internet radio]] shows, including a two-hour special for WOXY in [[Cincinnati]] in 2003, which included an on-air phone call from Jonathan L's close friend, music legend [[Ronnie Spector]]. In 2000, Jonathan L hosted and programmed the weekly Sunday afternoon show \"Pleasantly Annoying\" for [[Hollywood, California]]-based SpikeRadio.com.\n\nJonathan L appeared on ''[[A Current Affair (U.S. TV series)|A Current Affair]]'' with [[Maury Povich]] in 1991, where he interviewed One Foot In The Grave, \"the world\u2019s oldest punk rock band,\" a group from [[Sun City, Arizona]] with members all over the age of 60. In 2001, Jonathan L appeared on [[MTV2]] in a 23-minute video feature about German rock group [[Rammstein]].\n\n==The Berlin Years==\n\nIn April 2010 Rosen moved to [[Berlin, Germany]] to be with the one true love he ever felt. He and Gaby at first were just pen pals \nmeeting on Myspace in 2005. After a visit to Berlin in September 2009 to meet her in person he decided he knew what his future \nwould be. At the age of 63 he moved permantantly to Berlin. In September 2010 the couple flew to [[Las Vegas]] and were married at the famous [[Little White Chapel]].\n\nFor the first few months he tried to secure opportunities for a live radio gig. He was unsuccessful mainly due to not being able to speak German. \nSo he decided to try and master recording his Lopsided World Of L from their flat in [[Neuk\u00f6lln]], the largest sector in the western part of Berlin.\n\nBack in 2007 when he was doing the show live on 98 KUPD FM in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] the radio station starting streaming anywhere in the world.\nJonathan had already made many friends and contacts from [[Europe]] and other countries and was promoting the show on Myspace. \nHe used those contacts and new ones he made on Facebook in hope that if he was to use the internet, maybe that would give the show an edge and garner new listeners.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2014 he spent the better part of three years going to school three nights a week to learn the [[German language]].\n\nThen the break came in October 2010 when [[Los Angeles]] station Indie1031 asked him on.

The server transmits enough data about its internal state to allow its connected [[Client (computing)|clients]] to maintain their own accurate version of the game world for display to players. They also receive and process each player's input.\n\n== Types ==\n\n=== Dedicated server ===\nDedicated servers simulate game worlds without supporting direct input or output, except that required for their administration. Players must connect to the server with separate client programs in order to see and interact with the game.<ref name=weilbacher12 /><ref name=bernier01 />\n\nThe foremost advantage of dedicated servers is their suitability for hosting in professional [[data center]]s, with all of the reliability and performance benefits that entails. Remote hosting also eliminates the [[Lag (online gaming)|low-latency]] advantage that would otherwise be held by any player who hosts and connects to a server from the same machine or local network.<ref name=weilbacher12 />\n\nDedicated servers cost money to run, however. Cost is sometimes met by a game's developers (particularly on [[Video game console|consoles]]) and sometimes by [[Clan (video gaming)|clan]] groups, but in either case, the public is reliant on third parties providing servers to connect to. For this reason, most games which use dedicated servers also provide [[#Listen server|listen server]] support.<ref name=weilbacher12 /> Players of these games will oftentimes host servers for the public and their clans, either by hosting a server instance from their own hardware, or by renting from a game server hosting provider.\n\n=== Listen server ===\nListen servers run in the same [[Process (computing)|process]] as a game client. They otherwise function like dedicated servers, but typically have the disadvantage of having to communicate with remote players over the residential internet connection of the hosting player. Performance is also reduced by the simple fact that the machine running the server is also generating an output image. Furthermore, listen servers grant anyone playing on them directly a large latency advantage over other players and cease to exist when that player leaves the game.<ref name=weilbacher12 /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/259917634/Mammoth-Dedicated-Server-Guide|title=Mammoth Dedicated Server Guide {{!}} Installation (Computer Programs) {{!}} Server (Computing)|url-access=subscription|website=Scribd|language=en|access-date=16 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nHowever, listen servers have the advantage of being essentially free and not requiring any special infrastructure or forward planning to set up, which makes them common at [[LAN Party|LAN parties]] where latency and bandwidth issues are not a concern. They are also common in [[Video game console|console]] games.\n\n==== Host migration ====\n\nIn a listen server arrangement, \"host migration\" is a useful feature. Without host migration, if the player that is currently hosting disconnects for any reason (quitting, crashing, lost network connection, etc.), the current server stops functioning and gameplay ends. A host migration feature allows one of the other players to become designated as the new host, so that the game can continue.\n\n=== Peer-to-Peer ===\nIn the client/server model outlined elsewhere in this article, clients receive processed data from the server and display it without much thought. In the alternative \"peer-to-peer\" model there is no server: each \"peer\" instead receives the raw input streams of each other player and determines the results itself.<ref name=fiedler10 />\n\nPeer-to-peer is generally considered obsolete for action games, but it still common in the [[real-time strategy]] genre due to its suitability for games with large numbers of tokens and small numbers of players. Instead of constantly transmitting the positions of 1000 troops, the game can make a one-off transmission of the fact that 1000 troops are selected and that the player in command of them just issued a move order.<ref name=fiedler10 />\n\nHowever, peer-to-peer has many disadvantages:<ref name=fiedler10 />\n\n* It is very difficult to keep all peers synchronized. Minute differences between peers can escalate over time to game-breaking paradoxes.\n* It is very difficult to support new peers joining part-way through a game.\n* Each peer must communicate with all other peers, limiting the number of connected players.\n* Each peer must wait for every other peer's message before simulating the next \"network frame\", resulting in all players experiencing the same [[Lag (online gaming)|latency]] as the player with the worst connection\n\n=== Listen-peer ===\nMultiple listen servers collectively peer amongst themselves for listen-peer setting. This type of setting avoids the disadvantages of peer-to-peer communications among all clients and is a better alternative to dedicated servers for increased number of clients.\n\n== Tickrate ==\n\nThe rate at which a game server runs simulation steps is commonly referred to as its \"tickrate\". A \"tick\" is a number associated with each simulation step which is broadcast to clients to help them synchronise with the server.<ref name=\"source_networking\"/>\n\nThere are three reasons to limit the frequency of server simulation steps to a predefined tickrate: to conserve server and client bandwidth, to conserve server CPU time, and to allow clients to be certain of how much time has elapsed between each tick. The last point is important for internet games, as network updates from the server can arrive at different intervals or even an incorrect order.<ref name=\"source_networking\"/>\n\n== Customization ==\nServers, particularly those of [[PC game]]s, can generally be customized in ways that still allow unaltered clients to connect to them. These customizations can include tweaks to built-in game settings, content that is downloaded by clients when they join the game,<ref name=custom_files /> and new [[Source code|code]] which changes the way that the server behaves.<ref name=server_plugins />\n\nWhile server customization is popular with server administrators and players, it can be at odds with the desire of developers and other players for the game to be experienced as intended.<ref name=bowling09 /><ref name=Denton12>{{cite web|last=Denton|first=Jon|title=Battlefield 3: How Fan-Run Servers Are Ruining DICE's Game|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-07-04-battlefield-3-how-fan-run-servers-are-ruining-dices-game|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|date=July 4, 2012}}</ref> It can also aggravate players by enabling abusive administrators to lie about what their server offers.<ref name=tf2_server_scores />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lag (online gaming)]]\n* [[Matchmaking (video games)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=bernier01>{{cite web|last=Bernier|first=Yahn|title=Latency Compensating Methods in Client/Server In-game Protocol Design and Optimization|url=http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Latency_Compensating_Methods_in_Client/Server_In-game_Protocol_Design_and_Optimization|publisher=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]]|year=2001|accessdate=17 September 2011}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"source_networking\">{{cite web|title=Source Multiplayer Networking|url=https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_Multiplayer_Networking|work=[[Valve Developer Community]]|accessdate=13 February 2013}}</ref>\n<ref name=fiedler10>{{cite web|last=Fiedler|first=Glenn|title=What every programmer needs to know about game networking|url=http://gafferongames.com/networking-for-game-programmers/what-every-programmer-needs-to-know-about-game-networking/|date=24 January 2010}}</ref> \n<ref name=custom_files>{{cite web|title=HTTP Fast Download|url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9717-HMAP-7066|work=Steam Support|publisher=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]]|accessdate=5 May 2012}}</ref> \n<ref name=server_plugins>{{cite web|title=Server Plugins|url=https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Server_plugins|work=[[Valve Developer Community]]|publisher=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]]|accessdate=5 May 2012}}</ref>\n<ref name=bowling09>{{cite web|last=Bowling|first=Robert|title=Modern Warfare 2 For PC|url=http://www.fourzerotwo.com/?p=745|authorlink=Robert Bowling|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021202340/http://www.fourzerotwo.com/?p=745|archivedate=21 October 2009|date=21 October 2009}}</ref>\n<ref name=tf2_server_scores>{{cite web|last=Walker|first=Robin|title=And that's what ye git fer toochin that!|url=http://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=2338|work=Team Fortress 2 Blog|publisher=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]]|date=12 March 2009}}</ref>\n<ref name=weilbacher12>{{cite web|last=Weilbacher|first=Michael|title=Dedicated Servers in Gears of War 3: Scaling to Millions of Players|url=http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1015337/Dedicated-Servers-In-Gears-of|work=[[Game Developers Conference|GDC]] 2012|publisher=GDC Vault|date=March 2012}}</ref>\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Game Server}}\n[[Category:Multiplayer video games]]\n[[Category:Servers (computing)]]\n[[Category:Video game development]]\n[[Category:Video game platforms]]\n", "text_old": "{{Internet hosting}}\n\nA '''game server''' (also sometimes referred to as a '''host''') is a [[server (computing)|server]] which is the authoritative source of events in a [[multiplayer video game]].

These customizations can include tweaks to built-in game settings, content that is downloaded by clients when they join the game,<ref name=custom_files /> and new [[Source code|code]] which changes the way that the server behaves.<ref name=server_plugins />\n\nWhile server customization is popular with server administrators and players, it can be at odds with the desire of developers and other players for the game to be experienced as intended.<ref name=bowling09 /><ref name=Denton12>{{cite web|last=Denton|first=Jon|title=Battlefield 3: How Fan-Run Servers Are Ruining DICE's Game|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-07-04-battlefield-3-how-fan-run-servers-are-ruining-dices-game|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|date=July 4, 2012}}</ref> It can also aggravate players by enabling abusive administrators to lie about what their server offers.<ref name=tf2_server_scores />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lag (online gaming)]]\n* [[Matchmaking (video games)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=bernier01>{{cite web|last=Bernier|first=Yahn|title=Latency Compensating Methods in Client/Server In-game Protocol Design and Optimization|url=http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Latency_Compensating_Methods_in_Client/Server_In-game_Protocol_Design_and_Optimization|publisher=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]]|year=2001|accessdate=17 September 2011}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"source_networking\">{{cite web|title=Source Multiplayer Networking|url=https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_Multiplayer_Networking|work=[[Valve Developer Community]]|accessdate=13 February 2013}}</ref>\n<ref name=fiedler10>{{cite web|last=Fiedler|first=Glenn|title=What every programmer needs to know about game networking|url=http://gafferongames.com/networking-for-game-programmers/what-every-programmer-needs-to-know-about-game-networking/|date=24 January 2010}}</ref> \n<ref name=custom_files>{{cite web|title=HTTP Fast Download|url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9717-HMAP-7066|work=Steam Support|publisher=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]]|accessdate=5 May 2012}}</ref> \n<ref name=server_plugins>{{cite web|title=Server Plugins|url=https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Server_plugins|work=[[Valve Developer Community]]|publisher=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]]|accessdate=5 May 2012}}</ref>\n<ref name=bowling09>{{cite web|last=Bowling|first=Robert|title=Modern Warfare 2 For PC|url=http://www.fourzerotwo.com/?p=745|authorlink=Robert Bowling|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021202340/http://www.fourzerotwo.com/?p=745|archivedate=21 October 2009|date=21 October 2009}}</ref>\n<ref name=tf2_server_scores>{{cite web|last=Walker|first=Robin|title=And that's what ye git fer toochin that!|url=http://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=2338|work=Team Fortress 2 Blog|publisher=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]]|date=12 March 2009}}</ref>\n<ref name=weilbacher12>{{cite web|last=Weilbacher|first=Michael|title=Dedicated Servers in Gears of War 3: Scaling to Millions of Players|url=http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1015337/Dedicated-Servers-In-Gears-of|work=[[Game Developers Conference|GDC]] 2012|publisher=GDC Vault|date=March 2012}}</ref>\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Game Server}}\n[[Category:Multiplayer video games]]\n[[Category:Servers (computing)]]\n[[Category:Video game development]]\n[[Category:Video game platforms]]\n", "name_user": "112.197.82.36", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_server"}

The work is scored for two [[SATB]] choirs, two [[trumpet]]s, [[bassoon]], [[string section|strings]] and [[basso continuo]]. Its music opens with an instrumental introduction ([[sinfonia]]). Most of the composition's [[movement (music)|movements]] are either choral movements, in which all singers and instruments participate, or [[duet]]s for two singers and a more limited instrumental accompaniment.\n\nThe Magnificat in C&nbsp;major, [[BWV&nbsp;Anh.]]&nbsp;30, is [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s arrangement of Torri's Magnificat. In Bach's version of the work, which originated around 1742, there are an additional trumpet and [[timpani]]. Both Torri's original and Bach's arrangement were recorded in the first decade of the 21st century. Shortly after the second of these recordings was released in 2012, it was discovered that BWV&nbsp;Anh.&nbsp;30 was an arrangement of Torri's Magnificat. Before that, Bach's version had been attributed to various composers, including [[Antonio Lotti]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\nPietro Torri likely wrote his Magnificat in the 1690s, when he was in the service of [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria]].{{sfn|Thielemann|2012|p=218}} In that period Torri followed his employer to the [[Spanish Netherlands]] (1692) and was later deputized to [[Hanover]] (1696), only returning to [[Bavaria]] in 1701.{{sfn|Sadie|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rskiYf4mn7wC&pg=PA245 245]}} In the early 1790s Torri wrote scenic works such as ''L'ambizione fulminata'' and ''Gli amori di Titone e d'Aurora'' for [[Munich]], and ''I Preggi della primavera'' for [[Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici]], [[Electress Palatine]] at [[Leuchtenberg]].{{sfn|Champlin|1888\u201390|loc=III:[https://archive.org/details/cyclopediaofmusi03cham/page/489 489]}}<ref name=operone>[http://www.operone.de/komponist/torri.html Torri, Pietro] at {{url|www.operone.de}}.</ref><ref>{{RISM|450022127}}. {{Retrieved|access-date=2020-01-10}}.</ref>\n{{Panorama\n|image   = File:Wening Residenz M\u00fcnchen.jpg\n|height  = 275\n|width   = \n|alt     = \n|caption = [[Munich Residenz]], the palace of Torri's employer [[Max Emanuel]], around the time when Torri worked there.\n|dir     = \n}}\n''S.

The work is scored for two [[SATB]] choirs, two [[trumpet]]s, [[bassoon]], [[string section|strings]] and [[basso continuo]]. Its music opens with an instrumental introduction ([[sinfonia]]). Most of the composition's [[movement (music)|movements]] are either choral movements, in which all singers and instruments participate, or [[duet]]s for two singers and a more limited instrumental accompaniment.\n\nThe Magnificat in C&nbsp;major, [[BWV&nbsp;Anh.]]&nbsp;30, is [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s arrangement of Torri's Magnificat. In Bach's version of the work, which originated around 1742, there are an additional trumpet and [[timpani]]. Both Torri's original and Bach's arrangement were recorded in the first decade of the 21st century. Shortly after the second of these recordings was released in 2012, it was discovered that BWV&nbsp;Anh.&nbsp;30 was an arrangement of Torri's Magnificat. Before that, Bach's version had been attributed to various composers, including [[Antonio Lotti]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\nPietro Torri likely wrote his Magnificat in the 1690s, when he was in the service of [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria]].{{sfn|Thielemann|2012|p=218}} In that period Torri followed his employer to the [[Spanish Netherlands]] (1692) and was later deputized to [[Hanover]] (1696), only returning to [[Bavaria]] in 1701.{{sfn|Sadie|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rskiYf4mn7wC&pg=PA245 245]}} In the early 1790s Torri wrote scenic works such as ''L'ambizione fulminata'' and ''Gli amori di Titone e d'Aurora'' for [[Munich]], and ''I Preggi della primavera'' for [[Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici]], [[Electress Palatine]] at [[Leuchtenberg]].{{sfn|Champlin|1888\u201390|loc=III:[https://archive.org/details/cyclopediaofmusi03cham/page/489 489]}}<ref name=operone>[http://www.operone.de/komponist/torri.html Torri, Pietro] at {{url|www.operone.de}}.</ref><ref>{{RISM|450022127}}. {{Retrieved|access-date=2020-01-10}}.</ref>\n{{Panorama\n|image   = File:Wening Residenz M\u00fcnchen.jpg\n|height  = 275\n|width   = \n|alt     = \n|caption = [[Munich Residenz]], the palace of Torri's employer [[Max Emanuel]], around the time when Torri worked there.\n|dir     = \n}}\n''S.

Slugs differ from snails in having shells that are too small for the animal to retract inside; the shell-less state has evolved on multiple occasions during the evolutionary development of molluscs, so there is little taxonomic difference between the two, and both slugs and snails do considerable damage to plants. With novel crops being grown and with insect pests having been brought more under control by biological and other means, the damage done by molluscs becomes of greater significance.<ref name=Barker/> Terrestrial molluscs need moist environments; snails may be more noticeable because their shells provide protection from dessication, while most slugs live in soil and only come out to feed at night. They devour seedlings, damage developing shoots and feed on salad crops and cabbages, and some species tunnel into potatoes and other tubers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://gardening.which.co.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/214012325-Slugs-and-snails |title=Slugs and snails |publisher=Which? |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Plants|Plants and plant diseases}}<!--\"Pest plant\", \"Pest plants\", and \"Pest (plant)\" redirect to \"Pest#Plants and plant diseases\".-->\n<!--History of pests with respect to History of agriculture, domestication and diffusion of crops around the world-->\n<!--Effects of climate change-->\n\n=== Weeds ===\n[[File:Alternanthera philoxeroides habit4c (11680147013).jpg|thumb|[[Alternanthera philoxeroides|Alligator weed]], a native of South America, is an [[invasive species]] in many other countries and is considered a [[noxious weed]] as it is harmful to aquatic ecosystems, recreational activities, and favours the spread of [[mosquito]]es.

Slugs differ from snails in having shells that are too small for the animal to retract inside; the shell-less state has evolved on multiple occasions during the evolutionary development of molluscs, so there is little taxonomic difference between the two, and both slugs and snails do considerable damage to plants. With novel crops being grown and with insect pests having been brought more under control by biological and other means, the damage done by molluscs becomes of greater significance.<ref name=Barker/> Terrestrial molluscs need moist environments; snails may be more noticeable because their shells provide protection from dessication, while most slugs live in soil and only come out to feed at night. They devour seedlings, damage developing shoots and feed on salad crops and cabbages, and some species tunnel into potatoes and other tubers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://gardening.which.co.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/214012325-Slugs-and-snails |title=Slugs and snails |publisher=Which? |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Plants|Plants and plant diseases}}<!--\"Pest plant\", \"Pest plants\", and \"Pest (plant)\" redirect to \"Pest#Plants and plant diseases\".-->\n<!--History of pests with respect to History of agriculture, domestication and diffusion of crops around the world-->\n<!--Effects of climate change-->\n\n=== Weeds ===\n[[File:Alternanthera philoxeroides habit4c (11680147013).jpg|thumb|[[Alternanthera philoxeroides|Alligator weed]], a native of South America, is an [[invasive species]] in many other countries and is considered a [[noxious weed]] as it is harmful to aquatic ecosystems, recreational activities, and favours the spread of [[mosquito]]es.

He guided Ireland to the knockout stage of the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] in [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]]. He later managed [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] and [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]].

He spent two years in the basement league, before the club won promotion. Two years later, the team again went up to the (old) Division 2. A strong central defender, he was a virtual ever-present for his hometown club, but departed in December 1983 for fellow Division 2 club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].\n\nThe [[Maine Road]] club won promotion in McCarthy's first full season and he finally had the chance to play at the highest level. His first season in the top flight was steady enough as the club reached midtable, but relegation struck the following year.

After a protracted period of speculation, McCarthy was officially appointed on 5 February 1996, two days after his resignation at the club. Despite sitting a comfortable 14 points clear from the relegation zone at the time of his departure, Millwall would go on to suffer the drop (by virtue of goals scored) after McCarthy's departure.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nHis loan signings of the underachieving [[Russia]]n internationals [[Sergei Yuran]] and [[Vassili Kulkov]] from [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]], who each received a \u00a3150,000 signing-on fee and were being paid five times the wage of the rest of the first team, would later be cited {{by whom|date=November 2018}} as one of the main reasons Millwall were eventually relegated under [[Jimmy Nicholl]], although it cannot be proven.<ref name=\"Bethel\">Bethel, Chris; ''Millwall Football Club 1940\u20132001'' Tempus Publishing Ltd, 2001, p.122; {{ISBN|0-7524-2187-5}}</ref>\n\n===Republic of Ireland===\nIn February 1996, McCarthy became the new manager of the Republic of Ireland football team following the resignation of [[Jack Charlton]].\nMcCarthy's first game in charge of the Republic of Ireland team was a friendly international against [[Russia national football team|Russia]] on 27 March 1996 which finished in a 0\u20132 defeat.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=Rob|date=2019-03-19|title=Where are they now?

Indeed, the narrowness of the elimination meant Ireland were the ninth best performers at the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], and the fifth best among European teams in the competition. In spite of this, the Keane issue remained, with the proportion of blame undecided. Many in Ireland sided with Keane \u2013 particularly following a televised interview in which details of poor preparation were revealed \u2013 and demanded McCarthy's resignation both during and after the tournament. An independent inquiry into the organisation's handling of the squad's preparation later commissioned by the [[Football Association of Ireland|FAI]] created a damning report, leading to general secretary Brendan Menton tendering his resignation.<ref>[http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2002/1112/fai.html \"Menton quits following damning FAI report\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209003252/http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2002/1112/fai.html |date=9 December 2008 }} ''[[RT\u00c9]].ie'', 12 November 2002 (Retrieved: 19 August 2009)</ref>\n\nCriticism of McCarthy in the media became increasingly intense after a poor start to Ireland's [[UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying Group 10|qualifying]] campaign for [[2004 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2004]]. In particular, his persistence with several players and tactics that some perceived to be inadequate did him damage, as did a 4\u20132 away defeat to [[Russia national football team|Russia]] and a 2\u20131 home defeat to [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]].

The Midlands club faced an uncertain future after having to sell the majority of their first-team players, though despite this situation, McCarthy promised [[Premier League]] football at [[Molineux Stadium|Molineux]] within three seasons. From this awkward position, McCarthy managed to collect together a team from the club's youth ranks, and some lower league signings, and free transfers. Despite the lack of expectations, the team managed to make the promotion play-offs in McCarthy's first season, but it was third time unlucky for McCarthy in them as the team lost out to local rivals [[West Bromwich Albion]] over two legs, losing 3\u20132 at [[Molineux Stadium|Molineux]] and 1\u20130 at [[The Hawthorns]].\n\nIn the [[2007\u201308 in English football|2007\u201308 season]] he took the club to within a single placing of a successive play-off finish, ending seventh, losing the coveted sixth place to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] by a goal difference of only one (although another goal would have been required to overcome Watford's superior goals scored record).

football|football]] [[Coach (sport)|manager]], pundit and former player who was most recently the manager of the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]]. Born in [[Barnsley, South Yorkshire|Barnsley]], England with an Irish father, he played for the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] on 57 occasions scoring two goals.\n\nMcCarthy began his playing career at [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] in 1977, and he later had spells at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]], and finally [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], retiring in 1992.\n\nHe went on to manage Millwall, and then the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]]. He guided Ireland to the knockout stage of the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] in [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]]. He later managed [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] and [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. He has also been a television pundit and [[Sports commentator|commentator]], including for the [[BBC]] and for [[Virgin Media Television (Ireland)|Virgin Media Television]]. He began a second tenure as manager of the Republic of Ireland football team in 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2018/1124/1013087-stephen-kenny-to-replace-mccarthy-after-2020-finals/|title=Stephen Kenny to replace McCarthy after 2020 finals|date=2018-11-24|work=RTE.ie|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/sport/soccer/fai-on-verge-of-agreement-for-both-mick-mccarthy-and-stephen-kenny-to-manage-ireland-887588.html|title=FAI on verge of agreement for BOTH Mick McCarthy and Stephen Kenny to manage Ireland|date=2018-11-24|access-date=2018-11-24}}</ref>\n\n==Playing career==\n===Club===\nBorn in [[Barnsley, South Yorkshire|Barnsley, Yorkshire]],<ref name=Hugman/> McCarthy made his league debut for then-Fourth Division [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] on 20 August 1977 in a 4\u20130 win over [[Rochdale F.C.|Rochdale]]. He spent two years in the basement league, before the club won promotion. Two years later, the team again went up to the (old) Division 2. A strong central defender, he was a virtual ever-present for his hometown club, but departed in December 1983 for fellow Division 2 club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].\n\nThe [[Maine Road]] club won promotion in McCarthy's first full season and he finally had the chance to play at the highest level. His first season in the top flight was steady enough as the club reached midtable, but relegation struck the following year.

During the 1995\u201396 season, McCarthy became the prime candidate for the vacant [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] manager's job, after the resignation of [[Jack Charlton]]. After a protracted period of speculation, McCarthy was officially appointed on 5 February 1996, two days after his resignation at the club. Despite sitting a comfortable 14 points clear from the relegation zone at the time of his departure, Millwall would go on to suffer the drop (by virtue of goals scored) after McCarthy's departure.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nHis loan signings of the underachieving [[Russia]]n internationals [[Sergei Yuran]] and [[Vassili Kulkov]] from [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]], who each received a \u00a3150,000 signing-on fee and were being paid five times the wage of the rest of the first team, would later be cited {{by whom|date=November 2018}} as one of the main reasons Millwall were eventually relegated under [[Jimmy Nicholl]], although it cannot be proven.<ref name=\"Bethel\">Bethel, Chris; ''Millwall Football Club 1940\u20132001'' Tempus Publishing Ltd, 2001, p.122; {{ISBN|0-7524-2187-5}}</ref>\n\n===Republic of Ireland===\nIn February 1996, McCarthy became the new manager of the Republic of Ireland football team following the resignation of [[Jack Charlton]].\nMcCarthy's first game in charge of the Republic of Ireland team was a friendly international against [[Russia national football team|Russia]] on 27 March 1996 which finished in a 0\u20132 defeat.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=Rob|date=2019-03-19|title=Where are they now?

Indeed, the narrowness of the elimination meant Ireland were the ninth best performers at the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], and the fifth best among European teams in the competition. In spite of this, the Keane issue remained, with the proportion of blame undecided. Many in Ireland sided with Keane \u2013 particularly following a televised interview in which details of poor preparation were revealed \u2013 and demanded McCarthy's resignation both during and after the tournament. An independent inquiry into the organisation's handling of the squad's preparation later commissioned by the [[Football Association of Ireland|FAI]] created a damning report, leading to general secretary Brendan Menton tendering his resignation.<ref>[http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2002/1112/fai.html \"Menton quits following damning FAI report\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209003252/http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2002/1112/fai.html |date=9 December 2008 }} ''[[RT\u00c9]].ie'', 12 November 2002 (Retrieved: 19 August 2009)</ref>\n\nCriticism of McCarthy in the media became increasingly intense after a poor start to Ireland's [[UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying Group 10|qualifying]] campaign for [[2004 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2004]].
