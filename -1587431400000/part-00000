Although the CBSC determined that Green's conduct had contravened its guidelines on discrimination, it also decided that the station had responded appropriately, and the group did not prescribe any further action. In 2006 and 2008, the council censured Green for his treatment of a Muslim man who challenged Green on the way the radio show host portrays Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|archivedate=21 November 2010|accessdate=2010-11-30|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|archivedate=8 October 2011|accessdate=2009-08-07|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In June 2017, there was controversy as to whether [[Indigo Books and Music]] had pulled Green's latest book, ''Amazing But True!'', from its bookshelves in stores in Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Geoffrey|url=http://www.thewhig.com/2017/06/01/author-battles-censorship|title=Author battles 'censorship'|date=1 June 2017|newspaper=The Kingston Whig-Standard|accessdate=12 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://omny.fm/shows/580-cfra/listen-now-lowell-green-signs-off-for-the-last-tim Lowell Green's final message on CFRA]\n*[https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/video?clipId=781131 CTV Ottawa on Lowell Green's retirement]\n*[https://www.facebook.com/lgreen.ca/ Lowell Green at Facebook]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php CBSC 2008 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php CBSC 2006 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090212100107/http://cbsc.ca/english/decisions/1994/940604.php CBSC 1994 decision]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Green, Lowell}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Canadian non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:Canadian people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Canadian talk radio hosts]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:McGill University alumni]]\n[[Category:Ontario Liberal Party candidates in Ontario provincial elections]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ann Arbor, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ottawa]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Canadian radio personality}}\n{{Use Canadian English|date=February 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{Infobox presenter\n|name        = Lowell Green\n|alias       = \n|image       = Lowell Green.jpg|<nowiki>Lowell Green]]</nowiki>\n|image_size  = \n|caption     = \n|birth_name  = \n|birth_date  = {{Birth date and age|df=yes|1936|07|07}}\n|birth_place = [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], [[USA]]\n|death_date  = \n|death_place = \n|show        = ''The Lowell Green Show''\n|station     = [[CFRA (AM)|CFRA]] Ottawa\n|timeslot    = Weekdays 10 am to 12pm\n|show2       = \n|station2    = \n|timeslot2   = \n|style       = [[Talk radio]]\n|country     = Canada\n|prevshow    = Greenline\n|website     = \n|spouse      = Deborah Green\n|awards      = }}\n\n'''Lowell Green''' (born 7 July 1936) is a Canadian radio personality, journalist, and author, best known as the host of ''The Lowell Green Show'', a conservative morning [[talk show]] that aired on the [[Ottawa]] [[Ontario]] radio station [[CFRA]].

In a 1994 complaint to the CBSC, listeners alleged that Green had been rude and abusive to a caller who identified herself as a Christian. Although the CBSC determined that Green's conduct had contravened its guidelines on discrimination, it also decided that the station had responded appropriately, and the group did not prescribe any further action. In 2006 and 2008, the council censured Green for his treatment of a Muslim man who challenged Green on the way the radio show host portrays Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|archivedate=21 November 2010|accessdate=2010-11-30|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|archivedate=8 October 2011|accessdate=2009-08-07|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In June 2017, there was controversy as to whether [[Indigo Books and Music]] had pulled Green's latest book, ''Amazing But True!'', from its bookshelves in stores in Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Geoffrey|url=http://www.thewhig.com/2017/06/01/author-battles-censorship|title=Author battles 'censorship'|date=1 June 2017|newspaper=The Kingston Whig-Standard|accessdate=12 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://omny.fm/shows/580-cfra/listen-now-lowell-green-signs-off-for-the-last-tim Lowell Green's final message on CFRA]\n*[https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/video?clipId=781131 CTV Ottawa on Lowell Green's retirement]\n*[https://www.facebook.com/lgreen.ca/ Lowell Green at Facebook]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php CBSC 2008 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php CBSC 2006 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090212100107/http://cbsc.ca/english/decisions/1994/940604.php CBSC 1994 decision]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Green, Lowell}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Canadian non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:Canadian people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Canadian talk radio hosts]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:McGill University alumni]]\n[[Category:Ontario Liberal Party candidates in Ontario provincial elections]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ann Arbor, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ottawa]]\n", "name_user": "WildStar", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup, less Lowell, more Green.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell_Green"}

In December 1969, he held the recording sessions for his second album there. Titled ''[[Sweet Baby James]]'', and featuring the participation of [[Carole King]], the album was released in February 1970 and was Taylor's critical and popular triumph, buoyed by the single \"[[Fire and Rain (song)|Fire and Rain]]\", a song about both Taylor's experiences attempting to break his drug habit by undergoing treatment in psychiatric institutions and the suicide of his friend, Suzanne Schnerr. Both the album and the single reached {{numero|3}} on the ''Billboard'' charts, with ''Sweet Baby James'' selling more than 1.5&nbsp;million copies in its first year<ref name=\"time-cover-story\"/> and eventually more than 3 million in the United States alone. ''Sweet Baby James'' was received at its time as a folk-rock masterpiece, an album that effectively showcased Taylor's talents to the mainstream public, marking a direction he would take in following years. It earned several Grammy Award nominations including one for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]]. It went on to be listed at {{numero|103}} on [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]] in 2003, with \"Fire and Rain\" listed as {{numero|227}} on [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]] in 2004.\n\nDuring the time that ''Sweet Baby James'' was released, Taylor appeared with [[Dennis Wilson]] of [[the Beach Boys]] in a [[Monte Hellman]] film, ''[[Two-Lane Blacktop]]''. In October 1970, he performed with [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Phil Ochs]], and the Canadian band [[Chilliwack (band)|Chilliwack]] at a [[Vancouver]] benefit concert that funded [[Greenpeace]]'s protests of [[Amchitka#Milrow and Cannikin tests|1971 nuclear weapons tests]] by the [[US Atomic Energy Commission]] at [[Amchitka]], [[Alaska]]; this performance was released in album format in 2009 as ''[[Amchitka (album)|Amchitka, The 1970 Concert That Launched Greenpeace]]''. In January 1971, sessions for Taylor's next album began.\n\nHe appeared on ''[[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|The Johnny Cash Show]]'', singing \"Sweet Baby James\", \"Fire and Rain\", and \"Country Road\", on February 17, 1971. His career success at this point and appeal to female fans of various ages piqued tremendous interest in him, prompting a March 1, 1971, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine cover story of him as \"the face of new rock\".<ref name=\"time-cover-story\"/> It compared his strong-but-brooding persona to that of ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''{{'}} [[Heathcliff (Wuthering Heights)|Heathcliff]] and to ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'', and said, \"Taylor's use of elemental imagery\u2014darkness and sunlight, references to roads traveled and untraveled, to fears spoken and left unsaid\u2014reaches a level both of intimacy and controlled emotion rarely achieved in purely pop music.\"<ref name=\"time-cover-story\"/> One of the writers described his look as \"a cowboy Jesus\", to which Taylor later replied, \"I thought I was trying to look like George Harrison.\"<ref>''CBS Early This Morning'', musician James Taylor, December 5, 2016</ref> Released in April, ''[[Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon]]'' also gained critical acclaim and contained Taylor's biggest hit single in the US, a version of Carole King's new \"[[You've Got a Friend]]\" (featuring backing vocals by [[Joni Mitchell]]), which reached {{numero|1}} on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in late July. The follow-up single, \"[[Long Ago and Far Away (James Taylor song)|Long Ago and Far Away]]\", also made the Top 40 and reached {{numero|4}} on the ''Billboard'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] chart. The album itself reached {{numero|2}} on the album charts, which would be Taylor's highest position ever until the release of his 2015 album, ''Before This World'', which went to {{numero|1}}, superseding [[Taylor Swift]].\n\nIn early 1972, Taylor won his first Grammy Award for [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance|Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male]], for \"You've Got a Friend\"; King also won [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] for the same song in that ceremony. The album went on to sell 2.5&nbsp;million copies in the United States.\n\nNovember 1972 heralded the release of Taylor's fourth album, ''[[One Man Dog]]''. A [[concept album]] primarily recorded in his home recording studio, it featured a cameo by [[Linda Ronstadt]] along with Carole King, Carly Simon, and [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]]. The album consisted of eighteen short pieces of music put together. Reception was generally lukewarm and, despite making the Top 10 of the ''Billboard'' Album Charts, its overall sales were disappointing. The lead single, \"[[Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight]]\", peaked at {{numero|14}} on the Hot 100, and the follow-up, \"[[One Man Parade]]\", barely reached the Top 75. Almost simultaneously, Taylor married fellow singer-songwriter [[Carly Simon]] on November 3, in a small ceremony at her [[Murray Hill, Manhattan]], apartment.<ref name=\"white-208\">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', p. 208.</ref> A post-concert party following a Taylor performance at [[Radio City Music Hall]] turned into a large-scale wedding party, and the Simon-Taylor marriage would find much public attention over the following years.<ref name=\"white-208\"/> They had two children, [[Sally Taylor (singer-songwriter)|Sarah Maria \"Sally\" Taylor]], born January 7, 1974, and [[Ben Taylor (musician)|Benjamin Simon \"Ben\" Taylor]], born January 22, 1977.<ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 216, 243.</ref> During their marriage, the couple would guest on each other's albums and have two hit singles as duet partners: a cover of Inez & Charlie Foxx's \"[[Mockingbird (Inez & Charlie Foxx song)|Mockingbird]]\" and a cover of The Everly Brothers' \"[[Devoted to You (song)|Devoted to You]]\".\n\n===1973\u20131976: Career ups and downs===\nTaylor spent most of 1973 enjoying his new life as a married man and did not return to the recording studio until January 1974, when sessions for his fifth album began. ''[[Walking Man]]'' was released in June and featured appearances of Paul and [[Linda McCartney]] and guitarist [[David Spinozza]]. The album was a critical and commercial disaster and was his first album to miss the Top 5 since his contract with Warner. It received poor reviews and sold only 300,000 copies in the United States. The title track failed to appear on the Top 100.\n\nHowever, James Taylor's artistic fortunes spiked again in 1975 when the Gold album ''[[Gorilla (James Taylor album)|Gorilla]]'' reached {{numero|6}} and provided one of his biggest hit singles, a [[cover version]] of [[Marvin Gaye]]'s \"[[How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)]]\", featuring wife Carly on backing vocals and reached {{numero|5}} in America and {{numero|1}} in Canada. On the ''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary chart, the track also reached the top, and the follow-up single, the feelgood \"Mexico\", featuring a guest appearance  by [[Crosby & Nash]], also reached the Top 5 of that list. A well-received album, ''Gorilla'' showcased Taylor's electric, lighter side that was evident on ''Walking Man''. However, it was arguably a more consistent and fresher-sounding Taylor, with classics such as \"Mexico\", \"Wandering\" and \"Angry Blues\". It also featured a song about his daughter Sally, \"Sarah Maria\".\n\n''Gorilla'' was followed in 1976 by ''[[In the Pocket (James Taylor album)|In the Pocket]]'', Taylor's last studio album to be released under [[Warner Bros. Records]]. The album found him with many colleagues and friends, including [[Art Garfunkel]], [[David Crosby]], [[Bonnie Raitt]] and [[Stevie Wonder]] (who co-wrote a song with Taylor and contributed a harmonica solo). A melodic album, it was highlighted with the single \"[[Shower the People]]\", an enduring classic that hit {{numero|1}} on the Adult Contemporary chart and almost hit the Top 20 of the Pop Charts. However, the album was not well received, reaching {{numero|16}} and being criticized, particularly by ''Rolling Stone''. Still, ''In The Pocket'' went on to be certified gold.\n\nWith the close of Taylor's contract with Warner, in November, the label released ''[[Greatest Hits (James Taylor album)|Greatest Hits]]'', the album that comprised most of his best work between 1970 and 1976. With time, it became his best-selling album ever. It was certified 11\u00d7 Platinum in the US, earned a Diamond certification by the [[RIAA]], and eventually sold close to 20 million copies worldwide.\n\n===1977\u20131981: Move to Columbia and continued success===\nIn 1977 Taylor signed with [[Columbia Records]]. Between March and April, he quickly recorded his first album for the label. ''[[JT (album)|JT]]'', released that June, gave Taylor his best reviews since ''Sweet Baby James'', earning a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year in 1978. Peter Herbst of ''Rolling Stone'' was particularly favorable to the album, of which he wrote in its August 11, 1977 issue, \"''JT'' is the least stiff and by far the most various album Taylor has done. That's not meant to criticize Taylor's earlier efforts. ... But it's nice to hear him sounding so healthy.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Herbst |first=Peter |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/jt-19770811 |title=James Taylor JT Album Review |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=August 11, 1977 |accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref> ''JT'' reached {{numero|4}} on the ''Billboard'' charts and sold more than 3 million copies in the United States alone. The album's Triple Platinum status ties it with ''Sweet Baby James'' as Taylor's all-time biggest selling studio album. It was propelled by the successful cover of [[Jimmy Jones (singer)|Jimmy Jones]]'s and [[Otis Blackwell]]'s \"[[Handy Man (song)|Handy Man]]\", which hit {{numero|1}} on ''Billboard'''s Adult Contemporary chart and reached {{numero|4}} on the Hot 100, earning Taylor another [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] for his [[cover version]]. The song also topped the Canadian charts. The success of the album propelled the release of two further singles; the up-tempo pop \"[[Your Smiling Face]]\", an enduring live favorite, reached the American Top 20; however, \"[[Honey Don't Leave L.A.]]\", which [[Danny Kortchmar]] wrote and composed for Taylor, did not enjoy much success, reaching only {{numero|61}}.\n\nBack in the forefront of popular music, Taylor guested with [[Paul Simon]] on Art Garfunkel's recording of a cover of [[Sam Cooke]]'s \"[[Wonderful World (Sam Cooke song)|Wonderful World]]\", which reached the Top 20 in the U.S. and topped the AC charts in early 1978. After briefly working on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], he took a one-year break, reappearing in the summer of 1979, with the cover-studded Platinum album titled ''[[Flag (James Taylor album)|Flag]]'', featuring a Top 30 version of [[Gerry Goffin]]'s and Carole King's \"[[Up on the Roof (song)|Up on the Roof]]\". (Two selections from ''Flag'', \"[[Millworker]]\" and \"Brother Trucker\", were featured on the PBS production of [[Working (musical)|the Broadway musical]] based on [[Studs Terkel]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Working: People Talk About What They Do All Day and How They Feel About What They Do|Working]]'', which Terkel himself hosted, and Taylor himself appeared in that production as a trucker; he performed \"Brother Trucker\" in character.) Taylor also appeared on the [[Musicians United for Safe Energy|No Nukes]] concert in Madison Square Garden, where he made a memorable live performance of \"Mockingbird\" with his wife Carly. The concert appeared on both the [[No Nukes (album)|''No Nukes'' album]] and [[No Nukes (film)|film]].\n\nOn December 7, 1980, Taylor had an encounter with [[Mark David Chapman]], who would [[Death of John Lennon|assassinate John Lennon]] just one day later. Taylor told the BBC in 2010: \"The guy had sort of pinned me to the wall and was glistening with maniacal sweat and talking some freak speak about what he was going to do and his stuff with how John was interested, and he was going to get in touch with John Lennon. And it was surreal to actually have contact with the guy 24 hours before he shot John.\" The next night, Taylor, who lived in the next building from Lennon, heard the assassination occur. Taylor commented: \"I heard him shoot\u2014five, just as quick as you could pull the trigger, about five explosions.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11926898 |title=Lennon's death: I was there \u2013 BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=June 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn March 1981, Taylor released the album ''[[Dad Loves His Work]]'' whose themes concerned his relationship with his father, the course his ancestors had taken, and the effect that he and Simon had on each other.<ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 275\u2013276.</ref> The album was another Platinum success, reaching {{numero|10}} and providing Taylor's final real hit single in a duet with [[J.

On the album track \"Only One\", the backing vocals were performed by an all star duo of Joni Mitchell and Don Henley.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.classicrockhistory.com/top-10-james-taylor-songs/|title=Top 10 James Taylor Songs|last=S|first=Amy|date=14 July 2016|website=ClassicRockHistory.com|access-date=24 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nTaylor's next albums were partially successful; in 1988, he released ''[[Never Die Young]]'', highlighted with the charting title track, and in 1991, the platinum ''[[New Moon Shine]]'' provided Taylor some popular songs with the melancholic \"Copperline\" and the upbeat \"(I've Got to) Stop Thinkin' About That\", both hit singles on Adult Contemporary radio. In the late 1980s, he began touring regularly, especially on the summer [[amphitheater]] circuit. His later concerts feature songs spanning his career and are marked by the musicianship of his band and backup singers. The 1993 two-disc ''[[Live (James Taylor album)|Live]]'' album captures this, with a highlight being [[Arnold McCuller]]'s [[descant]]s in the [[coda (music)|codas]] of \"[[Shower the People]]\" and \"I Will Follow\". He provided a guest voice to ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Deep Space Homer]]\", and also appeared later on in the series when the family put together a jigsaw puzzle with his face as the missing final piece. In 1995, Taylor performed the role of the Lord in ''[[Randy Newman's Faust]]''.\n\n===1997\u2013present: Comeback===\n[[File:JamesTaylor 02.jpg|right|220px|thumb|Taylor in concert at DeVos Hall, Grand Rapids, Michigan \u2013 April 2006]]\nAfter six years since his last studio album, in 1997 Taylor released ''[[Hourglass (James Taylor album)|Hourglass]]'', an introspective album that gave him the best critical reviews in almost twenty years. The album had much of its focus on Taylor's troubled past and family. \"Jump Up Behind Me\" paid tribute to his father's rescue of him after The Flying Machine days, and the long drive from New York City back to his home in Chapel Hill.<ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', p. 318.</ref> \"Enough To Be on Your Way\" was inspired by the alcoholism-related death of his brother Alex earlier in the decade.<ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', p. 306.</ref> The themes were also inspired by Taylor and Walker's divorce, which took place in 1996.<ref name=\"White, p. 301\">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', p. 301.</ref> ''Rolling Stone Magazine'' found that \"one of the themes of this record is disbelief\", while Taylor told the magazine that it was \"spirituals for agnostics\".<ref>\"In 'Up From Your Life', you sing, \"For an unbeliever like you/ There's not much they can do.\" In \"Gaia\", you call yourself a 'poor, wretched unbeliever'.\" Interview, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', June 24, 1997.</ref> Critics embraced the dark themes on the album, and ''Hourglass'' was a commercial success, reaching {{numero|9}} on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] (Taylor's first Top 10 album in sixteen years) and also provided a big adult contemporary hit on \"Little More Time With You\". The album also gave Taylor his first Grammy since ''JT'', when he was honored with [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Album]] in 1998.\n\nFlanked by two greatest hit releases, Taylor's Platinum-certified ''[[October Road (album)|October Road]]'' appeared in 2002 to a receptive audience. It featured a number of quiet instrumental accompaniments and passages. Overall, it found Taylor in a more peaceful frame of mind; rather than facing a crisis now, Taylor said in an interview that \"I thought I'd passed the midpoint of my life when I was 17.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2002/08/13/2002-08-13_taylor_s__road__to_happiness.html | title=Taylor's 'Road' to Happiness | first=David | last=Hinckley | newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] | date=August 13, 2002 | accessdate=March 17, 2009 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The album appeared in two versions, a single-disc version and a \"[[limited edition]]\" two-disc version which contained three extra songs including a duet with [[Mark Knopfler]], \"[[Sailing to Philadelphia]]\", which also appeared on Knopfler's album by the same name. Also in 2002, Taylor teamed with bluegrass musician [[Alison Krauss]] in singing \"[[The Boxer]]\" at the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] Tribute to [[Paul Simon]]. They later recorded the [[Louvin Brothers]] duet, \"How's the World Treating You?\" In 2004, after he chose not to renew his record contract with Columbia/Sony, he released ''[[James Taylor: A Christmas Album]]'' with distribution through [[Hallmark Cards]].\n\n[[File:James Taylor at Tanglewood.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Taylor performing at Tanglewood in 2008]]\nAlways visibly active in [[Political ecology|environmental]] and liberal causes, in October 2004, Taylor joined the [[Vote for Change]] tour playing a series of concerts in American [[swing states]]. These concerts were organized by [[MoveOn.org]] with the goal of mobilizing people to vote for [[John Kerry]] and against [[George W. Bush]] in that year's presidential campaign. Taylor's appearances were joint performances with the [[Dixie Chicks]].\n\nTaylor performed \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\" at Game 2 of the World Series in Boston on October 24, 2004, on October 25, 2007, both the anthem and \"America\" for the game on October 24, 2013, and Game 1 on October 23, 2018. He also performed at Game 1 of the [[2008 NBA Finals]] in Boston on June 5, 2008, and at the [[2010 NHL Winter Classic|NHL's Winter Classic]] game between the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] and [[Boston Bruins]].\n\nIn December 2004, he appeared as himself in an episode of ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'' entitled \"[[A Change Is Gonna Come (The West Wing)|A Change Is Gonna Come]]\". He sang [[Sam Cooke]]'s classic \"[[A Change Is Gonna Come (song)|A Change Is Gonna Come]]\" at an event honoring an artist played by Taylor's wife Caroline. Later on, he appeared on [[Country Music Television|CMT]]'s ''Crossroads'' alongside the Dixie Chicks. In early 2006, [[MusiCares]] honored Taylor with performances of his songs by an array of notable musicians. Before a performance by the Dixie Chicks, lead singer [[Natalie Maines]] acknowledged that he had always been one of their musical heroes and had, for them, lived up to their once-imagined reputation of him.<ref name=\"dxchicks\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKka3yYpBaE|title=Musicares Honoring James Taylor|last=Dixie Chicks|year=2006|work=Video of Stage Performance|publisher=Grammy Award Sponsored Musicares|accessdate=December 31, 2008}}</ref> They performed his song, \"Shower the People\", with a surprise appearance by [[Arnold McCuller]], who has sung backing vocals on Taylor's live tours and albums for many years.\n\nIn the fall of 2006, Taylor released a repackaged and slightly different version of his Hallmark Christmas album, now entitled ''James Taylor at Christmas'', and distributed by Columbia/Sony. In 2006, Taylor performed [[Randy Newman]]'s song \"[[Our Town (Randy Newman song)|Our Town]]\" for the [[Disney]] animated film ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]''. The song was nominated for the 2007 [[Academy Award]] for the Best Original Song. On January 1, 2007, Taylor headlined the inaugural concert at the [[Times Union Center]] in [[Albany, New York]], honoring newly sworn in [[Governor of New York]] [[Eliot Spitzer]].\n\nTaylor's next album, ''[[One Man Band (James Taylor album)|One Man Band]]'' was released on CD and DVD in November 2007 on [[Starbucks]]' [[Hear Music]] Label, where he joined with [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Joni Mitchell]]. The introspective album grew out of a three-year tour of the United States and Europe called the One Man Band Tour, featuring some of Taylor's most beloved songs and anecdotes about their creative origins\u2014accompanied solely by the \"one man band\" of his longtime pianist/keyboardist, [[Larry Goldings]]. The [[Surround sound#5.1 Channel Surround (3-2 Stereo) (digital discrete: Dolby Digital, DTS, SDDS, Penteo)|digital discrete 5.1 surround sound]] mix of ''One Man Band'' won a [[TEC Awards|TEC Award]] for best surround sound recording in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legacy.tecawards.org/tec/08winners.html |title=The 2008 TEC Awards Winners |publisher=Legacy.tecawards.org |date= |accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:JamesTaylorApr2011.jpg|thumb|Taylor in April 2011]]\nOn November 28\u201330, 2007, Taylor, accompanied by his original band and Carole King, headlined a series of six shows at the Troubadour. The appearances marked the 50th anniversary of the venue, where Taylor, King and many others, such as [[Tom Waits]], [[Neil Diamond]], and [[Elton John]], performed early in their music careers. Proceeds from the concert went to benefit the Natural Resources Defense Council, MusiCares, Alliance for the Wild Rockies, and the Los Angeles Regional Foodbank, a member of [[America's Second Harvest]], the nation's Food Bank Network. Parts of the performance shown on ''[[CBS Sunday Morning]]'' in the December 23, 2007, broadcast showed Taylor alluding to his early drug problems by saying, \"I played here a number of times in the 70s, allegedly\". Taylor has used versions of this joke on other occasions, and it appears as part of his ''One Man Band'' DVD and tour performances.\n\n[[File:You've Got a Friend JT CK 2010.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Taylor and [[Carole King]] performing \"[[You've Got a Friend]]\" together during their [[Troubadour Reunion Tour]] in 2010]]\nIn December 2007, ''James Taylor at Christmas'' was nominated for a Grammy Award.

In December 1969, he held the recording sessions for his second album there. Titled ''[[Sweet Baby James]]'', and featuring the participation of [[Carole King]], the album was released in February 1970 and was Taylor's critical and popular triumph, buoyed by the single \"[[Fire and Rain (song)|Fire and Rain]]\", a song about both Taylor's experiences attempting to break his drug habit by undergoing treatment in psychiatric institutions and the suicide of his friend, Suzanne Schnerr. Both the album and the single reached {{numero|3}} on the ''Billboard'' charts, with ''Sweet Baby James'' selling more than 1.5&nbsp;million copies in its first year<ref name=\"time-cover-story\"/> and eventually more than 3 million in the United States alone. ''Sweet Baby James'' was received at its time as a folk-rock masterpiece, an album that effectively showcased Taylor's talents to the mainstream public, marking a direction he would take in following years. It earned several Grammy Award nominations including one for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]]. It went on to be listed at {{numero|103}} on [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]] in 2003, with \"Fire and Rain\" listed as {{numero|227}} on [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]] in 2004.\n\nDuring the time that ''Sweet Baby James'' was released, Taylor appeared with [[Dennis Wilson]] of [[the Beach Boys]] in a [[Monte Hellman]] film, ''[[Two-Lane Blacktop]]''. In October 1970, he performed with [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Phil Ochs]], and the Canadian band [[Chilliwack (band)|Chilliwack]] at a [[Vancouver]] benefit concert that funded [[Greenpeace]]'s protests of [[Amchitka#Milrow and Cannikin tests|1971 nuclear weapons tests]] by the [[US Atomic Energy Commission]] at [[Amchitka]], [[Alaska]]; this performance was released in album format in 2009 as ''[[Amchitka (album)|Amchitka, The 1970 Concert That Launched Greenpeace]]''. In January 1971, sessions for Taylor's next album began.\n\nHe appeared on ''[[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|The Johnny Cash Show]]'', singing \"Sweet Baby James\", \"Fire and Rain\", and \"Country Road\", on February 17, 1971. His career success at this point and appeal to female fans of various ages piqued tremendous interest in him, prompting a March 1, 1971, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine cover story of him as \"the face of new rock\".<ref name=\"time-cover-story\"/> It compared his strong-but-brooding persona to that of ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''{{'}} [[Heathcliff (Wuthering Heights)|Heathcliff]] and to ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'', and said, \"Taylor's use of elemental imagery\u2014darkness and sunlight, references to roads traveled and untraveled, to fears spoken and left unsaid\u2014reaches a level both of intimacy and controlled emotion rarely achieved in purely pop music.\"<ref name=\"time-cover-story\"/> One of the writers described his look as \"a cowboy Jesus\", to which Taylor later replied, \"I thought I was trying to look like George Harrison.\"<ref>''CBS Early This Morning'', musician James Taylor, December 5, 2016</ref> Released in April, ''[[Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon]]'' also gained critical acclaim and contained Taylor's biggest hit single in the US, a version of Carole King's new \"[[You've Got a Friend]]\" (featuring backing vocals by [[Joni Mitchell]]), which reached {{numero|1}} on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in late July. The follow-up single, \"[[Long Ago and Far Away (James Taylor song)|Long Ago and Far Away]]\", also made the Top 40 and reached {{numero|4}} on the ''Billboard'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] chart. The album itself reached {{numero|2}} on the album charts, which would be Taylor's highest position ever until the release of his 2015 album, ''Before This World'', which went to {{numero|1}}, superseding [[Taylor Swift]].\n\nIn early 1972, Taylor won his first Grammy Award for [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance|Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male]], for \"You've Got a Friend\"; King also won [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] for the same song in that ceremony. The album went on to sell 2.5&nbsp;million copies in the United States.\n\nNovember 1972 heralded the release of Taylor's fourth album, ''[[One Man Dog]]''. A [[concept album]] primarily recorded in his home recording studio, it featured a cameo by [[Linda Ronstadt]] along with Carole King, Carly Simon, and [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]]. The album consisted of eighteen short pieces of music put together. Reception was generally lukewarm and, despite making the Top 10 of the ''Billboard'' Album Charts, its overall sales were disappointing. The lead single, \"[[Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight]]\", peaked at {{numero|14}} on the Hot 100, and the follow-up, \"[[One Man Parade]]\", barely reached the Top 75. Almost simultaneously, Taylor married fellow singer-songwriter [[Carly Simon]] on November 3, in a small ceremony at her [[Murray Hill, Manhattan]], apartment.<ref name=\"white-208\">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', p. 208.</ref> A post-concert party following a Taylor performance at [[Radio City Music Hall]] turned into a large-scale wedding party, and the Simon-Taylor marriage would find much public attention over the following years.<ref name=\"white-208\"/> They had two children, [[Sally Taylor (singer-songwriter)|Sarah Maria \"Sally\" Taylor]], born January 7, 1974, and [[Ben Taylor (musician)|Benjamin Simon \"Ben\" Taylor]], born January 22, 1977.<ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 216, 243.</ref> During their marriage, the couple would guest on each other's albums and have two hit singles as duet partners: a cover of Inez & Charlie Foxx's \"[[Mockingbird (Inez & Charlie Foxx song)|Mockingbird]]\" and a cover of The Everly Brothers' \"[[Devoted to You (song)|Devoted to You]]\".\n\n===1973\u20131976: Career ups and downs===\nTaylor spent most of 1973 enjoying his new life as a married man and did not return to the recording studio until January 1974, when sessions for his fifth album began. ''[[Walking Man]]'' was released in June and featured appearances of Paul and [[Linda McCartney]] and guitarist [[David Spinozza]]. The album was a critical and commercial disaster and was his first album to miss the Top 5 since his contract with Warner. It received poor reviews and sold only 300,000 copies in the United States. The title track failed to appear on the Top 100.\n\nHowever, James Taylor's artistic fortunes spiked again in 1975 when the Gold album ''[[Gorilla (James Taylor album)|Gorilla]]'' reached {{numero|6}} and provided one of his biggest hit singles, a [[cover version]] of [[Marvin Gaye]]'s \"[[How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)]]\", featuring wife Carly on backing vocals and reached {{numero|5}} in America and {{numero|1}} in Canada. On the ''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary chart, the track also reached the top, and the follow-up single, the feelgood \"Mexico\", featuring a guest appearance  by [[Crosby & Nash]], also reached the Top 5 of that list. A well-received album, ''Gorilla'' showcased Taylor's electric, lighter side that was evident on ''Walking Man''. However, it was arguably a more consistent and fresher-sounding Taylor, with classics such as \"Mexico\", \"Wandering\" and \"Angry Blues\". It also featured a song about his daughter Sally, \"Sarah Maria\".\n\n''Gorilla'' was followed in 1976 by ''[[In the Pocket (James Taylor album)|In the Pocket]]'', Taylor's last studio album to be released under [[Warner Bros. Records]]. The album found him with many colleagues and friends, including [[Art Garfunkel]], [[David Crosby]], [[Bonnie Raitt]] and [[Stevie Wonder]] (who co-wrote a song with Taylor and contributed a harmonica solo). A melodic album, it was highlighted with the single \"[[Shower the People]]\", an enduring classic that hit {{numero|1}} on the Adult Contemporary chart and almost hit the Top 20 of the Pop Charts. However, the album was not well received, reaching {{numero|16}} and being criticized, particularly by ''Rolling Stone''. Still, ''In The Pocket'' went on to be certified gold.\n\nWith the close of Taylor's contract with Warner, in November, the label released ''[[Greatest Hits (James Taylor album)|Greatest Hits]]'', the album that comprised most of his best work between 1970 and 1976. With time, it became his best-selling album ever. It was certified 11\u00d7 Platinum in the US, earned a Diamond certification by the [[RIAA]], and eventually sold close to 20 million copies worldwide.\n\n===1977\u20131981: Move to Columbia and continued success===\nIn 1977 Taylor signed with [[Columbia Records]]. Between March and April, he quickly recorded his first album for the label. ''[[JT (album)|JT]]'', released that June, gave Taylor his best reviews since ''Sweet Baby James'', earning a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year in 1978. Peter Herbst of ''Rolling Stone'' was particularly favorable to the album, of which he wrote in its August 11, 1977 issue, \"''JT'' is the least stiff and by far the most various album Taylor has done. That's not meant to criticize Taylor's earlier efforts. ... But it's nice to hear him sounding so healthy.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Herbst |first=Peter |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/jt-19770811 |title=James Taylor JT Album Review |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=August 11, 1977 |accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref> ''JT'' reached {{numero|4}} on the ''Billboard'' charts and sold more than 3 million copies in the United States alone. The album's Triple Platinum status ties it with ''Sweet Baby James'' as Taylor's all-time biggest selling studio album. It was propelled by the successful cover of [[Jimmy Jones (singer)|Jimmy Jones]]'s and [[Otis Blackwell]]'s \"[[Handy Man (song)|Handy Man]]\", which hit {{numero|1}} on ''Billboard'''s Adult Contemporary chart and reached {{numero|4}} on the Hot 100, earning Taylor another [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] for his [[cover version]]. The song also topped the Canadian charts. The success of the album propelled the release of two further singles; the up-tempo pop \"[[Your Smiling Face]]\", an enduring live favorite, reached the American Top 20; however, \"[[Honey Don't Leave L.A.]]\", which [[Danny Kortchmar]] wrote and composed for Taylor, did not enjoy much success, reaching only {{numero|61}}.\n\nBack in the forefront of popular music, Taylor guested with [[Paul Simon]] on Art Garfunkel's recording of a cover of [[Sam Cooke]]'s \"[[Wonderful World (Sam Cooke song)|Wonderful World]]\", which reached the Top 20 in the U.S. and topped the AC charts in early 1978. After briefly working on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], he took a one-year break, reappearing in the summer of 1979, with the cover-studded Platinum album titled ''[[Flag (James Taylor album)|Flag]]'', featuring a Top 30 version of [[Gerry Goffin]]'s and Carole King's \"[[Up on the Roof (song)|Up on the Roof]]\". (Two selections from ''Flag'', \"[[Millworker]]\" and \"Brother Trucker\", were featured on the PBS production of [[Working (musical)|the Broadway musical]] based on [[Studs Terkel]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Working: People Talk About What They Do All Day and How They Feel About What They Do|Working]]'', which Terkel himself hosted, and Taylor himself appeared in that production as a trucker; he performed \"Brother Trucker\" in character.) Taylor also appeared on the [[Musicians United for Safe Energy|No Nukes]] concert in Madison Square Garden, where he made a memorable live performance of \"Mockingbird\" with his wife Carly. The concert appeared on both the [[No Nukes (album)|''No Nukes'' album]] and [[No Nukes (film)|film]].\n\nOn December 7, 1980, Taylor had an encounter with [[Mark David Chapman]], who would [[Death of John Lennon|assassinate John Lennon]] just one day later. Taylor told the BBC in 2010: \"The guy had sort of pinned me to the wall and was glistening with maniacal sweat and talking some freak speak about what he was going to do and his stuff with how John was interested, and he was going to get in touch with John Lennon. And it was surreal to actually have contact with the guy 24 hours before he shot John.\" The next night, Taylor, who lived in the next building from Lennon, heard the assassination occur. Taylor commented: \"I heard him shoot\u2014five, just as quick as you could pull the trigger, about five explosions.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11926898 |title=Lennon's death: I was there \u2013 BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=June 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn March 1981, Taylor released the album ''[[Dad Loves His Work]]'' whose themes concerned his relationship with his father, the course his ancestors had taken, and the effect that he and Simon had on each other.<ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 275\u2013276.</ref> The album was another Platinum success, reaching {{numero|10}} and providing Taylor's final real hit single in a duet with [[J.

In the late 1980s, he began touring regularly, especially on the summer [[amphitheater]] circuit. His later concerts feature songs spanning his career and are marked by the musicianship of his band and backup singers. The 1993 two-disc ''[[Live (James Taylor album)|Live]]'' album captures this, with a highlight being [[Arnold McCuller]]'s [[descant]]s in the [[coda (music)|codas]] of \"[[Shower the People]]\" and \"I Will Follow\". He provided a guest voice to ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Deep Space Homer]]\", and also appeared later on in the series when the family put together a jigsaw puzzle with his face as the missing final piece.

They later recorded the [[Louvin Brothers]] duet, \"How's the World Treating You?\" In 2004, after he chose not to renew his record contract with Columbia/Sony, he released ''[[James Taylor: A Christmas Album]]'' with distribution through [[Hallmark Cards]].\n\n[[File:James Taylor at Tanglewood.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Taylor performing at Tanglewood in 2008]]\nAlways visibly active in [[Political ecology|environmental]] and liberal causes, in October 2004, Taylor joined the [[Vote for Change]] tour playing a series of concerts in American [[swing states]]. These concerts were organized by [[MoveOn.org]] with the goal of mobilizing people to vote for [[John Kerry]] and against [[George W. Bush]] in that year's presidential campaign. Taylor's appearances were joint performances with the [[Dixie Chicks]].\n\nTaylor performed \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\" at Game 2 of the World Series in Boston on October 24, 2004, on October 25, 2007, both the anthem and \"America\" for the game on October 24, 2013, and Game 1 on October 23, 2018. He also performed at Game 1 of the [[2008 NBA Finals]] in Boston on June 5, 2008, and at the [[2010 NHL Winter Classic|NHL's Winter Classic]] game between the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] and [[Boston Bruins]].\n\nIn December 2004, he appeared as himself in an episode of ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'' entitled \"[[A Change Is Gonna Come (The West Wing)|A Change Is Gonna Come]]\". He sang [[Sam Cooke]]'s classic \"[[A Change Is Gonna Come (song)|A Change Is Gonna Come]]\" at an event honoring an artist played by Taylor's wife Caroline. Later on, he appeared on [[Country Music Television|CMT]]'s ''Crossroads'' alongside the Dixie Chicks. In early 2006, [[MusiCares]] honored Taylor with performances of his songs by an array of notable musicians. Before a performance by the Dixie Chicks, lead singer [[Natalie Maines]] acknowledged that he had always been one of their musical heroes and had, for them, lived up to their once-imagined reputation of him.<ref name=\"dxchicks\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKka3yYpBaE|title=Musicares Honoring James Taylor|last=Dixie Chicks|year=2006|work=Video of Stage Performance|publisher=Grammy Award Sponsored Musicares|accessdate=December 31, 2008}}</ref> They performed his song, \"Shower the People\", with a surprise appearance by [[Arnold McCuller]], who has sung backing vocals on Taylor's live tours and albums for many years.\n\nIn the fall of 2006, Taylor released a repackaged and slightly different version of his Hallmark Christmas album, now entitled ''James Taylor at Christmas'', and distributed by Columbia/Sony. In 2006, Taylor performed [[Randy Newman]]'s song \"[[Our Town (Randy Newman song)|Our Town]]\" for the [[Disney]] animated film ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]''. The song was nominated for the 2007 [[Academy Award]] for the Best Original Song. On January 1, 2007, Taylor headlined the inaugural concert at the [[Times Union Center]] in [[Albany, New York]], honoring newly sworn in [[Governor of New York]] [[Eliot Spitzer]].\n\nTaylor's next album, ''[[One Man Band (James Taylor album)|One Man Band]]'' was released on CD and DVD in November 2007 on [[Starbucks]]' [[Hear Music]] Label, where he joined with [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Joni Mitchell]]. The introspective album grew out of a three-year tour of the United States and Europe called the One Man Band Tour, featuring some of Taylor's most beloved songs and anecdotes about their creative origins\u2014accompanied solely by the \"one man band\" of his longtime pianist/keyboardist, [[Larry Goldings]]. The [[Surround sound#5.1 Channel Surround (3-2 Stereo) (digital discrete: Dolby Digital, DTS, SDDS, Penteo)|digital discrete 5.1 surround sound]] mix of ''One Man Band'' won a [[TEC Awards|TEC Award]] for best surround sound recording in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legacy.tecawards.org/tec/08winners.html |title=The 2008 TEC Awards Winners |publisher=Legacy.tecawards.org |date= |accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:JamesTaylorApr2011.jpg|thumb|Taylor in April 2011]]\nOn November 28\u201330, 2007, Taylor, accompanied by his original band and Carole King, headlined a series of six shows at the Troubadour. The appearances marked the 50th anniversary of the venue, where Taylor, King and many others, such as [[Tom Waits]], [[Neil Diamond]], and [[Elton John]], performed early in their music careers. Proceeds from the concert went to benefit the Natural Resources Defense Council, MusiCares, Alliance for the Wild Rockies, and the Los Angeles Regional Foodbank, a member of [[America's Second Harvest]], the nation's Food Bank Network. Parts of the performance shown on ''[[CBS Sunday Morning]]'' in the December 23, 2007, broadcast showed Taylor alluding to his early drug problems by saying, \"I played here a number of times in the 70s, allegedly\". Taylor has used versions of this joke on other occasions, and it appears as part of his ''One Man Band'' DVD and tour performances.\n\n[[File:You've Got a Friend JT CK 2010.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Taylor and [[Carole King]] performing \"[[You've Got a Friend]]\" together during their [[Troubadour Reunion Tour]] in 2010]]\nIn December 2007, ''James Taylor at Christmas'' was nominated for a Grammy Award.

The first 747-400 Combi, able to carry both passengers and freight, was rolled out in June 1989.<ref name=n86/> The 747-400 Domestic, a short-range variant of the aircraft designed for Japanese intra-island services, first flew on March 18, 1991, and entered service with [[Japan Airlines]] on October 22, 1991. A cargo variant, the 747-400F, was first delivered in May 1993 to [[Cargolux]].<ref name=n86/> By the end of the 1990s, Boeing was producing four versions of the {{not a typo|747-400}}.\n\n===Further developments===\n[[File:Qantas Boeing 747-438ER Spijkers.jpg|thumb|[[Qantas]] placed the Boeing 747-400ER into service in November 2002|alt=Side view of four-engine jet climbing in the sky.]]\n\nThe extended range freighter (ERF) entered service in {{nowrap|October 2002}}. The next month, the extended range (ER) passenger version entered service with [[Qantas]], the only airline ever to order the passenger version of the 747-400ER. Qantas initially used the 747-400ER for the Melbourne to Los Angeles and Dallas to Sydney route allowing the completion of the flight with full passenger load and cargo. Prior to the 747-400ER, Qantas would complete such flights by blocking out 'E' zone of the cabin and limiting passenger numbers and cargo. The 747-400ER featured the ''Boeing Signature Interior'', which was later made available on the 747-400 (either as a retrofit on existing 747-400s or factory installation on new frames).\n\nThe 747-400ER also introduced some flight deck enhancements, including [[liquid-crystal display]]s (LCDs), which replaced the six [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) displays found on the Boeing {{not a typo|747-400}}. LCDs later became standard on the 747-400 as well, and could be retrofitted to earlier aircraft. The three standby flight displays found on the 747-400 were also replaced by a single combined LCD, the integrated standby flight display (ISFD), which also became standard on the 747-400 in late 2003.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/aero_21/747ER.pdf | title=Introducing the 747ER and 747 | date= January 2003 | publisher=Boeing Aero magazine}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2000s, as part of an effort to promote sustainable and alternative fuel development, as well as lower emissions, several 747-400 operators studied the use of oil extracted from the [[jatropha]] plant. [[Air New Zealand]] carried out the first commercial flight using jatropha oil for fuel; the airline's 747-400 had one engine burning a mix of 50% [[jatropha oil]] and 50% jet fuel for two hours during the flight while engineers collected data. [[Continental Airlines]] tested jatropha oil in one of its airliners on January 7, 2009.

As most 747-400s are now more than 20 years old, airlines are beginning to replace them. Airlines using the 747-400 have been retiring the model, replacing it with more fuel efficient aircraft. The main appeal of the 747-400 like its predecessors was its range rather than its capacity, and in most cases it has been replaced by wide-body twin-engine aircraft of similar range, such as the [[Boeing 777]] and [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]]. The change in emphasis from hub and spoke operations to point-to-point flights has also reduced the need for jumbo jets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/boeing-747-heading-retirement/any-other-business/article/1360694|title=The Boeing 747 is heading for retirement|publisher=}}</ref> Airlines such as British Airways and Qantas that plan to maintain the same capacity on routes currently served by 747-400s ordered the [[Airbus A380]] rather than the updated [[Boeing 747-8|747-8]].\n\nFor example, Delta Air Lines reduced the number of flights it operated from the United States to [[Narita International Airport]] that were intended to transfer passengers to other destinations in Asia, switching to twin-engine widebody aircraft operating from an expanded hub at [[Seattle-Tacoma International Airport]].<ref>Schofield, Adriean, et al., Jumbos bow out, Aviation Week and Space Technology, September 15, 2014, pp. 21-22</ref> Total capacity was cut, but load factors improved. In April 2015, Delta announced it would accelerate the retirement of its 747-400s and replace them either with [[Airbus A330]] or [[Airbus A350 XWB|Airbus A350]] aircraft (both of which are twinjets).

Airliners.net</ref> The SUD was almost twice as long as the original 747 upper deck. Besides increased capacity, the 747-300 did not offer any increase in range, nor did it include improvements in flight deck technology or construction materials.<ref name=\"n74\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=74.}}</ref> At the same time, 747s were becoming more costly to operate due to a number of factors, notably conventional flight control systems, three-person flight crews, and fuel costs.<ref name=\"d23\" />\n\nIn 1982, Boeing introduced a two-crew glass cockpit, new engines, and advanced materials on its 757 and 767 twinjets.<ref name=n74/> At the same time, combined sales of the {{not a typo|747-100}}, \u2212200, and \u2212300 models (collectively referred to as the 747 \"Classics\") neared 700, but new orders slowed precipitously.<ref name=d24>{{harvnb|Dorr|2002|p=24.}}</ref> The introduction of the 747-300 did little to stem the decline, and itself faced potential competition from more modern designs. As a result, Boeing began considering a more significant upgrade for its largest passenger jet.<ref name=n74/>\n\nBy early 1984, company officials had identified five development objectives for the latest 747 upgrade: new technologies, an enhanced interior, a {{Convert|1000|nmi|km|lk=in}} range increase, more efficient engines, and a 10 percent reduction in operating cost.<ref name=n74/> In September 1984, Boeing announced development of the newest 747 derivative, the \"Advanced Series 300\", at the [[Farnborough Airshow]].<ref name=n74/> On October 22, 1985, the type was officially launched when Northwest Airlines became the first 747-400 customer, with an order for 10 aircraft.<ref name=d25/> [[Cathay Pacific]], [[KLM]], [[Lufthansa]], [[Singapore Airlines]], and [[British Airways]] also announced orders several months later, followed by [[United Airlines]], [[Air France]], and [[Japan Airlines]].<ref name=d25>{{harvnb|Dorr|2002|p=25.}}</ref>\n\n===Design effort===\n[[File:JAL Boeing 747-446 flight deck.jpg|thumb|The computerized [[glass cockpit]] of the Boeing 747-400|alt=Cockpit of modern jet airliner, showcasing digital displays and instruments.

The first 747-400 Combi, able to carry both passengers and freight, was rolled out in June 1989.<ref name=n86/> The 747-400 Domestic, a short-range variant of the aircraft designed for Japanese intra-island services, first flew on March 18, 1991, and entered service with [[Japan Airlines]] on October 22, 1991. A cargo variant, the 747-400F, was first delivered in May 1993 to [[Cargolux]].<ref name=n86/> By the end of the 1990s, Boeing was producing four versions of the {{not a typo|747-400}}.\n\n===Further developments===\n[[File:Qantas Boeing 747-438ER Spijkers.jpg|thumb|[[Qantas]] placed the Boeing 747-400ER into service in November 2002|alt=Side view of four-engine jet climbing in the sky.]]\n\nThe extended range freighter (ERF) entered service in {{nowrap|October 2002}}. The next month, the extended range (ER) passenger version entered service with [[Qantas]], the only airline ever to order the passenger version of the 747-400ER. Qantas initially used the 747-400ER for the Melbourne to Los Angeles and Dallas to Sydney route allowing the completion of the flight with full passenger load and cargo. Prior to the 747-400ER, Qantas would complete such flights by blocking out 'E' zone of the cabin and limiting passenger numbers and cargo. The 747-400ER featured the ''Boeing Signature Interior'', which was later made available on the 747-400 (either as a retrofit on existing 747-400s or factory installation on new frames).\n\nThe 747-400ER also introduced some flight deck enhancements, including [[liquid-crystal display]]s (LCDs), which replaced the six [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) displays found on the Boeing {{not a typo|747-400}}. LCDs later became standard on the 747-400 as well, and could be retrofitted to earlier aircraft. The three standby flight displays found on the 747-400 were also replaced by a single combined LCD, the integrated standby flight display (ISFD), which also became standard on the 747-400 in late 2003.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/aero_21/747ER.pdf | title=Introducing the 747ER and 747 | date= January 2003 | publisher=Boeing Aero magazine}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2000s, as part of an effort to promote sustainable and alternative fuel development, as well as lower emissions, several 747-400 operators studied the use of oil extracted from the [[jatropha]] plant. [[Air New Zealand]] carried out the first commercial flight using jatropha oil for fuel; the airline's 747-400 had one engine burning a mix of 50% [[jatropha oil]] and 50% jet fuel for two hours during the flight while engineers collected data.

As most 747-400s are now more than 20 years old, airlines are beginning to replace them. Airlines using the 747-400 have been retiring the model, replacing it with more fuel efficient aircraft. The main appeal of the 747-400 like its predecessors was its range rather than its capacity, and in most cases it has been replaced by wide-body twin-engine aircraft of similar range, such as the [[Boeing 777]] and [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]]. The change in emphasis from hub and spoke operations to point-to-point flights has also reduced the need for jumbo jets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/boeing-747-heading-retirement/any-other-business/article/1360694|title=The Boeing 747 is heading for retirement|publisher=}}</ref> Airlines such as British Airways and Qantas that plan to maintain the same capacity on routes currently served by 747-400s ordered the [[Airbus A380]] rather than the updated [[Boeing 747-8|747-8]].\n\nFor example, Delta Air Lines reduced the number of flights it operated from the United States to [[Narita International Airport]] that were intended to transfer passengers to other destinations in Asia, switching to twin-engine widebody aircraft operating from an expanded hub at [[Seattle-Tacoma International Airport]].<ref>Schofield, Adriean, et al., Jumbos bow out, Aviation Week and Space Technology, September 15, 2014, pp. 21-22</ref> Total capacity was cut, but load factors improved. In April 2015, Delta announced it would accelerate the retirement of its 747-400s and replace them either with [[Airbus A330]] or [[Airbus A350 XWB|Airbus A350]] aircraft (both of which are twinjets). Delta could not keep the 747s full without deeply discounting ticket prices; the discounts and increased maintenance required of a four-engine aircraft led to a drag on profits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/stock-analysis/042415/deltas-boeing-747s-are-flying-sunset-ba-dal-ual.aspx|title=Delta's Boeing 747s Are Flying Off Into the Sunset|publisher=Investopedia|date=April 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, economic weakness in air cargo markets has slowed demand for cargo conversions. Since the cost of replacing a 747-400 is high (an airline must purchase or lease another wide-body), some operators choose to fly the {{not a typo|747-400}} to the conclusion of its accepted useful life and then scrap it. The current parts resale value for this aircraft has been reduced to its engines. When a 26-year-old 747-400 owned by Delta flew through a violent hailstorm, the company indicated it was likely the aircraft would be scrapped. George Dimitroff, head of valuations for FlightGlobal, estimated the aircraft's value before the incident at about $8 million.

The album was released [[Independent record label|independently]] by Cicierega on April 27, 2014. Consisting of mashups pairing [[Top 40 Mainstream|Top 40]] hits of the 1980s and 1990s along with [[Smash Mouth]]'s \"[[All Star (song)|All Star]]\", ''Mouth Sounds'' received positive reviews from music critics. It received a second installment, ''[[Mouth Silence]]'', months later, which followed the same mashup format, and a third installment in ''[[Mouth Moods]]'' in 2017.\n\n==Background==\n{{Quote box\n| quote  = \"When I decided to mash up Smash Mouth with John Lennon, of course I was thinking, \u2018This is super blasphemous, this is designed to make people angry.\u2019\"\n| source = \u2014Neil Cicierega explains his thinking behind the creation of the track \"Imagine All Star People\"<ref name=fast />\n| width  = 23%\n| align  = left\n| style  = padding:10px;\n}}\nCicierega began work on the album after discovering multiple raw instrument tracks from songs featured on the [[music video game]] series ''[[Rock Band]]''.<ref name=fast /> Because ''Rock Band'' requires players to control individual instruments for each track, all artists featured in ''Rock Band'' must provide the [[Stem (audio)|stems]] of each song featured in the game. With access to these tracks, Cicierega was able to create mashups of the provided songs. The process was mostly trial and error, where he paired songs together randomly, and kept what sounded good.<ref name=fast /> Cicierega tried to only pull popular songs, explaining \"If you're doing a comedy album with mashups, then you definitely want to use songs that people will recognize.\"<ref name=fast /> The purpose of the album was to make Cicierega laugh, but also to offend fans of the songs and artists he used in the album.\n\n''Mouth Sounds''{{'}} development dates as far back as early 2013, when the song \"No Credit Card\" (a remix of [[Huey Lewis and the News]]' \"[[The Power of Love (Huey Lewis and the News song)|The Power of Love]]\") appeared on Neil Cicierega's [[SoundCloud]] account on February 6, 2013.<ref name=credit>{{cite AV media |people=[[Neil Cicierega]] |year=2013 |title=No Credit Card |medium=audio |url=https://soundcloud.com/neilcic/no-credit-card |accessdate=November 6, 2014 |format=streamed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112110930/https://soundcloud.com/neilcic/no-credit-card |archive-date=November 12, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=neilTwit1>{{cite web |title= Tweet Number 496909166783766528 |url= https://twitter.com/neilyourself/status/496909166783766528 |first= Neil |last= Cicierega |date= 6 August 2014 |accessdate= 13 September 2015 |quote= people forget that Mouth Sounds is mostly just a compilation of joke songs I posted on tumblr over a couple year span |work= [[Twitter]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151112213236/https://twitter.com/neilyourself/status/496909166783766528 |archive-date= 12 November 2015 |url-status= live }}</ref> Over the following year, rougher edits of the songs \"Vivid Memories Turn to Fantasies,\" \"The Sharpest Tool,\" \"Modest Mouth,\" \"Imma Let It Be,\" \"Like Tears in Chocolate Rain,\" \"Melt Everyone,\" and \"Smooth Flow,\" would be uploaded to the same SoundCloud, with the final track, \"Mullet with Butterfly Wings,\" dropping just over a week before Mouth Sounds itself was released.<ref name=mullet>{{cite AV media |people=[[Neil Cicierega]] |year=2013 |title=Mullet With Butterfly Wings |medium=audio |url=https://soundcloud.com/neilcic/mullet-with-butterfly-wings |accessdate=November 6, 2014 |format=streamed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112111054/https://soundcloud.com/neilcic/mullet-with-butterfly-wings |archive-date=November 12, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> In addition, Cicierega posted a [[Music Video]] for \"The Sharpest Tool\" (titled \"MOUTH\") to his main [[YouTube]] channel a year earlier on February 9, 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAsPeY8BsQU|title=MOUTH|last=Cicierega|first=Neil|date=2013-02-09|website=YouTube|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>   \n\nWhile developing the prequel to ''Mouth Sounds'', Cicierega created a setting for both albums, concerning the existence of [[multiverse|parallel universes]]. In the universe with which ''Mouth Sounds'' lies, the band Smash Mouth exists, but not in the parallel universe created for ''[[Mouth Silence]]'' (which lacks any overt Smash Mouth-related mixes). In both universes, Cicierega delineated that a \"war of music\" continues on, explaining the reasoning behind the mashups.\n\nNumerous [[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]] have been found in the digital files for ''Mouth Sounds'' and ''Mouth Silence'' that each relate to \"All Star\". For example, when the metadata of every track on the former is viewed, the creation date of all the files is May 4, 1999 which was the release date of \"All Star.\" On the cover of the album, [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] can be seen on the glasses of Cicierega, referencing how \"All Star\" was used at the beginning of [[Shrek]].\n\n==Reception==\n''Mouth Sounds'' received mostly positive reviews from critics. Katie Rife, writing for ''[[The A.V.

The album was released [[Independent record label|independently]] by Cicierega on April 27, 2014. Consisting of mashups pairing [[Top 40 Mainstream|Top 40]] hits of the 1980s and 1990s along with [[Smash Mouth]]'s \"[[All Star (song)|All Star]]\", ''Mouth Sounds'' received positive reviews from music critics. It received a second installment, ''[[Mouth Silence]]'', months later, which followed the same mashup format, and a third installment in ''[[Mouth Moods]]'' in 2017.\n\n==Background==\n{{Quote box\n| quote  = \"When I decided to mash up Smash Mouth with John Lennon, of course I was thinking, \u2018This is super blasphemous, this is designed to make people angry.\u2019\"\n| source = \u2014Neil Cicierega explains his thinking behind the creation of the track \"Imagine All Star People\"<ref name=fast />\n| width  = 23%\n| align  = left\n| style  = padding:10px;\n}}\nCicierega began work on the album after discovering multiple raw instrument tracks from songs featured on the [[music video game]] series ''[[Rock Band]]''.<ref name=fast /> Because ''Rock Band'' requires players to control individual instruments for each track, all artists featured in ''Rock Band'' must provide the [[Stem (audio)|stems]] of each song featured in the game. With access to these tracks, Cicierega was able to create mashups of the provided songs. The process was mostly trial and error, where he paired songs together randomly, and kept what sounded good.<ref name=fast /> Cicierega tried to only pull popular songs, explaining \"If you're doing a comedy album with mashups, then you definitely want to use songs that people will recognize.\"<ref name=fast /> The purpose of the album was to make Cicierega laugh, but also to offend fans of the songs and artists he used in the album.\n\n''Mouth Sounds''{{'}} development dates as far back as early 2013, when the song \"No Credit Card\" (a remix of [[Huey Lewis and the News]]' \"[[The Power of Love (Huey Lewis and the News song)|The Power of Love]]\") appeared on Neil Cicierega's [[SoundCloud]] account on February 6, 2013.<ref name=credit>{{cite AV media |people=[[Neil Cicierega]] |year=2013 |title=No Credit Card |medium=audio |url=https://soundcloud.com/neilcic/no-credit-card |accessdate=November 6, 2014 |format=streamed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112110930/https://soundcloud.com/neilcic/no-credit-card |archive-date=November 12, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=neilTwit1>{{cite web |title= Tweet Number 496909166783766528 |url= https://twitter.com/neilyourself/status/496909166783766528 |first= Neil |last= Cicierega |date= 6 August 2014 |accessdate= 13 September 2015 |quote= people forget that Mouth Sounds is mostly just a compilation of joke songs I posted on tumblr over a couple year span |work= [[Twitter]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151112213236/https://twitter.com/neilyourself/status/496909166783766528 |archive-date= 12 November 2015 |url-status= live }}</ref> Over the following year, rougher edits of the songs \"Vivid Memories Turn to Fantasies,\" \"The Sharpest Tool,\" \"Modest Mouth,\" \"Imma Let It Be,\" \"Like Tears in Chocolate Rain,\" \"Melt Everyone,\" and \"Smooth Flow,\" would be uploaded to the same SoundCloud, with the final track, \"Mullet with Butterfly Wings,\" dropping just over a week before Mouth Sounds itself was released.<ref name=mullet>{{cite AV media |people=[[Neil Cicierega]] |year=2013 |title=Mullet With Butterfly Wings |medium=audio |url=https://soundcloud.com/neilcic/mullet-with-butterfly-wings |accessdate=November 6, 2014 |format=streamed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112111054/https://soundcloud.com/neilcic/mullet-with-butterfly-wings |archive-date=November 12, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> In addition, Cicierega posted a [[Music Video]] for \"The Sharpest Tool\" (titled \"MOUTH\") to his main [[YouTube]] channel a year earlier on February 9, 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAsPeY8BsQU|title=MOUTH|last=Cicierega|first=Neil|date=2013-02-09|website=YouTube|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>   \n\nWhile developing the prequel to ''Mouth Sounds'', Cicierega created a setting for both albums, concerning the existence of [[multiverse|parallel universes]]. In the universe with which ''Mouth Sounds'' lies, the band Smash Mouth exists, but not in the parallel universe created for ''[[Mouth Silence]]'' (which lacks any overt Smash Mouth-related mixes). In both universes, Cicierega delineated that a \"war of music\" continues on, explaining the reasoning behind the mashups.\n\nNumerous [[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]] have been found in the digital files for ''Mouth Sounds'' and ''Mouth Silence'' that each relate to \"All Star\". For example, when the metadata of every track on the former is viewed, the creation date of all the files is May 4, 1999 which was the release date of \"All Star.\" On the cover of the album, [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] can be seen on the glasses of Cicierega, referencing how \"All Star\" was used at the beginning of [[Shrek]].\n\n==Reception==\n''Mouth Sounds'' received mostly positive reviews from critics. Katie Rife, writing for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', called the mixtape \"brilliant,\" citing its ability to toy with the listener's nostalgia held towards the songs included, and wrapped up her review by suggesting the album to those that enjoy the thought of \"dropping acid at a [[Media Play]] going-out-of-business sale.\"<ref name=avclub>{{cite news|first=Katie|last=Rife|date=April 29, 2014|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/mouth-sounds-punishing-90s-nostalgia-mixtape-world-203927|title=\"Mouth Sounds\" is the punishing \u201990s nostalgia mixtape the world deserves|newspaper=[[The A.V.
